PREFACE. 



SOME writers h.u-5 att'i'-rneti t;i:it rrinnkind arc- all 
born with the fame difpofuions and the lame degree 
of underilandir.g ; and that education, laws, and cul- 
tQins, create all the diiferen- e perceivable between man 
and man. I contels, I can hardly bring m}it'ir to fap- 
pofe that education alone produced the widi* diflimilarity 
which exifts between the charidters of Therfites and 
Achilles, orthofe of Socrates and Anytus : at the lame 
time it will ever be an acknowledged truth, that even 
he wlio is moil indebred to Nature will reap but fmall 
iidvantage froirn h.er gifts, unlcfs they are improved by 
rna:ure and judicious culuvation. 

It is unnecelfary to undertake a ferious dem.onftration 
of a truth univerfally admitted in ail ages and nations ; 
* truth confirmed by daily experience, and the pra<5lice 
of which was the object conliantly aimed at by the la- 
bours both of the pliilofopher and the bulk of mankind. 
7Tje improvement of the latter, as far as it can be effed- 
cd by education, has bee.i more attended to in the pre- 
lenc age than ever it was in any preceding one. If the 
endeavour"; ufed to this pufpofe have not had all the 
luccels that might be expe^ed frotn then^ thty have at 
ieall: excitt'd the attention and directed the minds of men 
towards an objed, the accompiifbnv-nt of which, as it 
is more or Icfs perfeCt, has ever a proportionable effect 
lipo ! the happiiiris of fiimiijes, and conlequently upon 
the ftatc of iociety in general. 

A great genius of the prelect age has contrii)uted,

nre remarked, and the difcufiion of them frequently 
le;ids to' the truth from which they have deviated. Thus 
Mr. Roiifreau's Eniijius v.'ill, in fpite of the falfe opi- 
nions advanced in it, always be a valuable book, both 
on account of the important truths which it contains, 
and thofe which it has caufed to be difcovered ; and it 
would be unjull not to attribute to it at lead a confide- 
rable enlargement in our ideas concerning education. 

To free our ipecies, as far as in I4S lies, from the ail- 
ments and difabiiities to which Nature fubjefls them 
from their very birth, is a great object, but certainly 
not the only one. ic is eifential to fociety that its 
members be found and robuft in conftitution ; but if 
they are not, at the fjme lime, honefl, juft, and good, 
they will be of more prc-judice than advantage to focie- 
ty. Mr, RouiTeau was perfectly I'enfible of this truth ; 
he has paid confiderable attention to it ; but, if I may 
be allowed the alTertion, he was frequently deceived 
both in the nature of locial virtue, and the extent to 
which it fhould be praQifed. While he boldly attacks 
the prejudices under which we are enOaved from our 
infancy, he has., on the other hand, denied, or endea- 
voured CO render doubtful, many valuable truths which 
conftitute our happinefs in a more advanced age. 
While he meant to prune aw-ay the greedy branches that 
impeded the growth of the tree, he has, though per- 
haps without intention, wounded its very root^ 
Whilil he wiilies to allift Nature, he allows Nature too 
.much; and where he thought he found her defective, 
he has not always been able to find the bed means of 
Supplying her defers. In a word, young Emilias is 
the child of Mr. Roulfeau's fancy, not ttie child of 
education. 

Nevcirhclefs, the following work is indebted to that 
of Mr. Rouiieau for the form that it hears. Mr. Campt, 
the author of it, exprciVes himlelf thus : ** I never read 
the follov/ing pallaf.e in the fecond volume of Erui.i us 
without the mA\ ^enfible fatisfailion. Nothing upon 
earth can be fo v.'fcJl calculited to inlpire one wiih ar- 
dour in thK: execution of a plan approved by ib great a 
genius."

** Might there not be found mean?," fays Ronfleau, 
*' to bring together fo many lefions of inf^ruQion that 
lie'fcattered in fo many hooks ; to apply them througli 
a fiiigle obje<^ of a familiar and not uncommon naturf, 
capable of engaging the imitation, as well as roufing 
and fixing the atcention even at i'o tender an age ? If 
one could imagine a fituation, in which all the najural 
wants of man appear in the cleared: light to the under- 
ftanding of a child, and in which the means of fatisfy- 
\ng tbefe wants unfold therafelves fucceffively in the 
fame clear, eafy manner, the lively and natural defcrip- 
tion of fuch a fiare ffcould be the lirft means that 1 would

** I fee thine expand already, thou ardent philofo- 
pher. But be not in pain ; we have found luch a fitua- 
tion. It is defcribed, and no difparagement to your 
talents, much better than you would defcribe it your-- 
f^lf, at leaft with more truth and fimplicity. Since we 
muft have books, there is one that turnilhes, in my opi- 
nion, the befl imagined treatile upon natural education 
that can poffibly be. This book (ball be the hril that I 
will put into the hands cf my Emilius ; this fingly 
fhall for a long time compofc his whole library> and 
indeed Ihall always hold a diftinguilLed place there. It 
(hall be the text to which all our difcourle^ upon natu- 
ral fcience (hall ferve as a commentdry. It Ihall be the 
criterion of our tat"^e and judgment ; and, as long as 
thcfe remain uncorrupted, the reading of it will al- 
ways be agreeable to us. Well, rhen, what is this 
wonderful book ? Is it Ariftotle, tiiny, Buft'^n ? — No: 
it is Robinfon Crulbe. 

** Robinfon Crufoe, alone in his ifland, deprived of 
the allill:ance of his fellow creatures, without * tools 
of any fort, yet providing for his fafety and fubfifience^, 
and even procuring himfelf a fort of happinefs, prelents

t^ie delert ilLud, which 1 ulcd at firft as a comparnbr. 
1 grant, it is by no means the flatc of man as deflincd 
for Ibciety ; nay, probably Emilius might never expe- 
rience fuch a fituation ; nevertheltls, it is that by 
which he fiiould eflimate the value of every other con- 
dition in life. The fureft way to rife fuperior to all 
prejudice, and to form our judgment upon the true re- 
port of thingi, is to placeourlelves in the fituation of a 
man cut off from all fociety, and to judge of every 
thing as that man mull: naturally judge, regard being 
had at the lame time to his own degree of utility in the 
Iphere of exifience.

of, I will have his head run upon nothing elf but 
Robinfon Crufce ; he (hall talk inteliantly about his caf-

for he fliall have no occafion for that. 1 will have him 
(ludy how he (hoi.ld proceed if he happened to be in 
want of this or that receffary j he (hali exaniine his 
hero's conduct, and try if he has left nothing undone, 
or if he v>-t\M the beft way to work about what he has 
clone ; he (hall remark where he is wrong, and take care 
not to fall into the fame miftake himfelf ; for you need 
not have the leaft doubt but he will be for imitating Ro- 
binfon in his whole plan. Nothing, indeed, tan 'be 
better calculated to pleaie the imagination at that calm 
period of life, when, if our wants are fatisfied, and our 
adlions unreilrained, we look no farther for happinefs.

PREFACE. 

** What advantage may not an able ma(^er take of 
this romantic project in a child ! a proje6l to whi.h he 
himfelf has given birth tor the lake of the proticahle 
fruits that may be reaped from it. The child, ever hufy 
and eager to make provifion for his iiland fetclement, 
will be more ready to learn than the mafter to teach. 
He v^'ill defire to know every thing that is ufef':!, and 
nothing more J vou will have no occafion to fpur him 
on — The extreife of the natural arts, for which one 
man alone isfufficient, leads to the invention of the arts 
of iadufirv, which require the co-operation of many- 
hands." 

This paiTage from RoufTeau v/i!| explain, infinitely 
better than I car>, the utility of a hook compofed upoa 
fuch a plar ; it r.ow remains to be feen how far Mr, 
Campe, tne author of the following work, has purfued 
Mr. l^juileau's idea. 

TIi:i pUDiic is pretty generally agreed not to depend 
on the report of tranHitcrs co.icerning the v/orks which 
they tranllate, efpecially if t!;eir judgrr.ent be favoura- 
ble to the original : and I believe this caution is wtli 
founded ; for it is no eafy n:atter to decide with impar- 
tiality where fe'.f-upinion has equal influence with juf- 
tice in pafllng the fcntence. 

Perhaps fome may not think as I do concerning this 
work of Mr. Campe's j particularly, thofe who are 
fond of metaphyrc.'il treatifes ^ipon education, will, no 
doubt, be difappointed to find n(jthing in the New Ro- 
binfon Cruloe but things that are ufeful, introduced in 
an unafi^etled manner, clearly expreifed anddemoiftrat- 
ed without pedantry ; they v/ill be furpnfed to fee chil- 
dren (ppaklike children, and their inftructor alfume the 
fimple language of childhood, in order to make himfelf 
underilood. Thofe who are governed by t!;e fpirit of 
free thinking will find it ftrange that religion is refpefled 
and rendered refpeftable in this work; that God is re- 
prcfenied as the mover of all things, and the principle 
to which all our adions fhould be referred, as well as 
the motives which determine tliem, and the fentimenrs 
which gave them birth. Thefe are, no doubt, parti- 
cularities thit may be remarked: n-^verthelefs, at this

_ ** The Old Robinfon Cnifoe," fays h''. C:'mpe, in 
his Preface to the original of this work, ** irdeptt d^nt 
of its other defeats, is erroneous in one particular fu-^- 
cient todcllroy every advantage that this Hillory ir.ight 
produce, which is, that Rcbinfcn Crufoe is provided 
with all forts of European tools and inftrumenis necef- 
fary to procure him many of thofe c'onvcniencies that 
belong to fociety. Thus the opportunity is loft of af- 
fording the young reader a lively fenle both ofth^ wants' 
cf man in a ftate of iolitiide, and the multiplied happi- 
nefsofa fecial life; another important reafon why I 
thcugl.t proper to depart from the old Hiftory of Robin- 
fon Crufoe. 

** 1 have, therefore, divided the time of my New 
Robinfon Crufoe'sremaining upon the ifland into tiiree 
periods. In the firft he is all alone and dtftirute of any- 
European cool or inftrumenl whatfoever, aihfting him-* 
i'elf merely by his hands and invention; in order to 
Ihew, on the one hand, how helplefs man is in a ftate 
of lolitude, and, on the other, how much reflexion and . 
perfevering efforts can contribute to the improvement of 
our condition. In the fecond peiiod, I give him a 
companion, on purpofe tofiiew how much a man's fitua- 
lion may be bettered by taking even this fmgle ftep to- 
v/ards fociety. Laftly, in the third period, a veffel 
from Europe h flipwrecked on his illund, and gives 
him an cope.' turity thereby of providing hinrifeif uith 
tools ard moft other articles net eifary in common life, 
in ordic.r that the young reader li^ay fee how valuable 
many things are of which we are accufti)med to niykc 
very little account, bccaufe we have never exj.erienced 
the want of thein." 



Thus far the French TranHator's Preface; which 

containing a very ample explanation of the plan and

fabjedil. It only remains for the En;7li(h Tranilator to 
reqtieft the indulgence of the Public, on account of 
the deviations which he has taken the liberty to make 
from the original. Many parages he has found himfelf 
obliged either to omic entirely, or to throw into a new- 
form, according as the diri^erence of national manners 
and charafter feemed abfolurely to require it. He 
hopes, however, that this liberty has never been ufed 
unlefs under circumllances of unavoidable necedity. 
Withthefe advantages, it is hoped, the New Ro- 
binfon Crufoe will tind its way to the fludies of the 
younger clafs of both fexes, and afford them at once 
both innocent entertainment and moral inftrui^ion.

THE 



NEV/ ROBINSON CRUSOE, 



FIRST E VEiNI N G. 

A Gil NTLEMAN, of the name of Billlngfley, 
rcfided lome years ago at Twickenham, who^- 
having a pretty large family, and but a moderate for- 
tune, deter. lijjied to undertake himltif the care of his 
children's education. He propoi'ed, by this plan, on 
the one Imnd, to avoid the enormous expence of keep- 
ing then', at \a hat are called genteel hoarding-fchocls, 
and, on the other, to enjoy the pleafing oblervalion of 
their improvement in learning, I'enfe, and good beha- 
viour. To remark, with filent but attentive eyes, the 
gradual advance of his ca'idren towards the perftdiofi 
of reilbn and virtue ; to aiiilT:,. with his advice and in- 
flru^tion, their endeavours to become more learned, ho- 
ncfi", and wife j.and to have the happy confcioufnels, 
that he Ihould one cay be confidered, what all parents 
ought, as the inlliumentandcaufe of his children's eter- 
nal welfare } ali tiiis, he thought, would be more than 
a fuffi-:icnt reward for wiiatever cares and fatigue he 
ihould undergo in the courle of their education. 

He, theretoie, laid down for them a regular plan of 
ftudy, to which jie afterwards ftrittly adhered. In this 
was inGiuded a couric of reading j and fome book, that .

was at once both ir)r!!uctivc' and entertaining, afTon^ed 
thdn aniilcUiCnt t-vcry evening for two or three hours 
btf.je (u|.'per. But, as this cxercife was meant bv their 
father loicly to encreai'e their fund (>f knowlege, and 
enlarge their underllanding, in order that it might ap*. 
pear rather as a rehixatioo from thtir clofer iludies^ 
than a labour imnofed on them, Mr^ Billingfley, m ge- 
neral, undertook the tahk ot reading hi mfelf. The ff)l- 
lovving Hillory of the N<."vv Robiiilon Cruibe was, dur- 
ing feme weeks, the fubjeft of their evening's enier- 
tainment ; and was thus introduced. 

.Mr. and Mrs. liiilingfley, being fcaud by the parlour 
fire, together with iVlr. Roie and Mr. Meredith, two 
intimate friends of the family, and ail the children, 
whofe names u ill appear facccirively in the courfe of 
the ftory, being alTembled in theii proper pK-ices, Mr, 
Billingfley began his relation as follows : 

Mr, BilhtiijUy, Well, my dear children, I have a. 
fcookfqr your entertainment this evening that contains a 
very. extraordinary llory. Som^; parts of it will miake 
your laair fiai.d on end, and others will perfectly d::light 
;you. 

George, Ah! but do not let it be too melancholy, 
papa, 

Harriet. No, my dear papa, not too melancholy ;. 
for then it v/ill make us all cry, you know» 

Richard, Hold your tongues \. papa knows what to 
lead, 1 warrant you. 

Mr. Bill. Do not be une-fy, my dears. 1 will take, 
care that there fhall not be any tiling too tragical in k. 

There lived in the town of Exeter a peflon cf the 
name of Cruibe, who follov/cd the profcfhon of a brok- 
cr» He had three fons, the eldeil of v/hom, ha\ingaa 
inclination to ferve in the aimy, enlilUd himlelf as a 
Ibldier, went abroad with his regiment to Fianders, and 
was killed at the battle ot Fontenoy. 

The fccond entered the Univerfity of Oxford, and 
made a ccr.ndtrable pro^iefs in learning; but purfuing 
his ftudics witifc too much ea^ernels, he impaired his 
health beyond all poliibiiity of recovering^ and died of 

a coniuroptiwn. 

There 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 13 

There remained, therefore, but the youngefr, whofe 
name was Kobinfon. Id him, as he was now become 
iktir only fon, Mr. and Mrs. Crufoe placed all their 
hopes and expeclatiors. They loved him as the apple 
of their eye, but their love was blind and injudicious. 
G<??, What is the meaning of that, papa ? 
Mr, Bill. I will tell you— your mother and I love 
you all, my dear children, as you well know; but for 
that very rcalbn we keep you clofe at your bu/inefs 
every day, and teach you many things both ufeful and 
agreeable, hecaule we know that to be thQ befl: way to 
make you good and happy. But Robinfon^s parents 
did not ad in the fame manner. They fuffered their 
dear chili to do v/hatever he pleaied ; and as this dear 
chilu liked better to piay than to work or to learn anv 
thing, they let him p!a% almoft the whole day long, by 
which means he learned little or nothing. Now this is 
whi.t we call an irjadicious love in pdrcrits. 
Geo, I underhand now, papa, 

M'\ liW. Robinibn grew up a flout flripling before 
his parents had determined what profeilion they fbould 
give him. fdis father was defirous that he fhould leara 
-: I'ome trade, but the fon had not the leaft inclination that 
* way. 'he, faid he fbould like better to travel, to fee the 
world, and become acouainted uith the various objects 
and culi;.ms that foreign countries .ifford. 

In fpeaking thus, young Crulcefcev/ed his ignorance 
and folly. U he had begun by !j}ingin a good frock of 
karning, it would have been another matter. But 
v;iuic profit could a raw, ignorant boy, like him, gain 
b) ieeing forefgn countries? When a man wiflDes to 
make h'3 way in the world, be it in v.-hat country it will, 
he ought to be provided beforehand with a tolerabie 
fliare uf Knowledge ; but this was what Robinfor never 
thought V f . 

He was now feventeen years of age. The greateil 
pa.tof this time he had mifpent in fauntering about 
and pluming in the Itreets of Exeter. Every day he 
was teazin^.his father for leave to go and tiaveJ. But 
hi. fa.hcr roid him that he did not know his own mind,

playfellows, whole fatlier was captain of a fhip trading 
CO Anifterdam, and wh<> had juft come down from Ply- 
mouth to ft e fome of his relations thi't lived at Exeter. 
Itie told Robinfcn that he was to let oif with his father 
in a day or two for AmrEerdam. 

CharhttF. What, papa, by the (la^e ? 

Henry. No, Charlo te, but in a fir p j for yoii mud 
crofs the fea to go to AmHierdam. Well, papa. 

Mr. Bill. He afKed Rohinfon if he ftiould like to go 
with him. ** Yes, very wel',"' replied he, but my pa- 
rents will not content to it.'' ** Pooh !" (did the oiher, 
** come off with me as you are, juft for the frolick. We 
111 all be back again in a month or ilx wee\s ; and as lo 
your father and mother, you have only to let chem 
know v/here you are gone." ** Bur," favs Rubinfon, 
*' I have no money in my pocket." ** You will net 
want any," replied his conipanion ; " but if yau il ould 
when we-arrive at AnUlerdam, I'll fupply you.'* 

Young Crulbe hefitattd a few moments, as if con- 
fidering what relol-tion he fhouid take; at lafl, flap- 
ping his coTTipanicn's hand, he cried, ** Agreed, my 
boy ! I will go along with you : let us fct off this mo- 
ment for Plymouth." Ac the fam.e time he comm'iii- 
oned one of his acquaintances to Jet his father know 
(after the expiration of a few hours), that he was only 
gone to fee the citv of Axmfttrdam, in Holland, and 
ihat he lliould be back in a wee .- or two. 

Rich, I do not like this Mr. Robiiifon Crufoe. 

Edw. Nor I neither.

are not many young perfcns now fo ignorant as not to 
know their duty towards their parents. 

Ednv, What ! are there other boys, then, like Robln- 
fon Crufoe ? 

Mr, Rc/r. \ have not yet found any ; but one thing 
I know for certain, which is, that no good can ever 
come of voung people who behave like him. 

Rich. Well, let us hear what becomes of Robinfon. 
Mr. Bill. A fhort time afier Robinfon and the cap- 
tain's fen were got on board, the failors weighed an- 
chor and fet their fails. The wind blew frefib, and they 
cleared out of the harbour, bidding adieu to Plymouth 
for a fliort while. Young Crufoe was upon the deck 
with his friend, and alm.oll: out of his wits with joy 
that he was at length going to begin his travels. 

The evening was fine, and the breeze blew fo favour- 
ably, that they foon loft fight of the town and harbour 
of Plymouth. They were now on the open fea, and 
Robinfon ftared with admiration when he law nothing 
before him but the fl;y and the water. By degrees they 
began to lofe fight of land,, and as niglic came on, they 
could fee nothing on that quarter but the Eddiilonelighs- 
houfe. This alfo drlappeared in a very Cncvl time, and 
from that moment Robinfon law nothing above h'm but 
the £ky, nor before, behind, and all round him, but the 
fea. 

Geo, That mufl be a prcfpedl ? 

Mr. Me/ed. It is not impoihble but you may fee fuch 
a one before it be long. 

Geo. Oh ! {hall we go upon the fea ? 
Mr. Mereci. if you will be very attentive while you 
are learning geography, fo as to know which courfe you 
mufl: take to go from one place to anoihtr. 

Mr. Bill. Yes, and if by working conftantly, and be- 
ing temperate in your victuals, you make your bodies 
hardy enough to bear the fatigue of fuch a voyage, we 
may, perhaps, forae day in fummer, take a boat down 
the rivet as far as London, where fome of you have ne- 
ver been yet.

Harriet, But it is very far, is not it, papa? Perhaps

Harriet. That was a good boy ; was not he, papa ? 

Mr._ Bill. Yes, he was a good boy for being To oblig- 
incr as to do us a kindnefs, though he had nevcf (ic^n us 
before. 

Hanlel, However, you gave hira fomething, I fup- 
pcfe. 

Mr, Bill. Certainly, my dear, I gave him fomething^ 
for every one likes to reward thole that are obliging — 
But we forget R.ob'nlbn Cruibe. We mull: make hafle 
to overtake him, or elfe we (ball lofe fight of him, for he 
is going at a furious rate. 

For tv/o days they had confbantly good weather, and 
a favourable wind* The third da}^ the fky was dark- 
ened with clouds, the wind blew with uncommon vio- 
lence, and the air grew every moment darker and darker. 

In Oiort, it was a dreadiul fiorm. Ac one time the 
lightning fiafned as if the (ky .vas on fre j.the^i'ucceed-

to fled the fea about in fach a manner that the waves 
fwelled and rofe mountain high. 

Then it would have been worth while to fee how the 
fhip went fee-law. One time a large wave carried it, 
as it were, up to the clouds ; another time it dipped' 
dov/n as if it was going to the bottom of the deep; 
then it rolled to one fide and the other, and lay down 
fo flat that at times its very mails feemed to touch the 
water. 

What a noife was amongft the ropes ! what a clatter- 
ing :>;pon the deck ! The tailors v/ere obliged, each of 
them, to hold fail: to fomething or other tor fear of be- 
ing ivafhed overboard. Robinfon Crufoe, who had ne- 
ver been accuftomed to all this, grew giddy, feltafick- 
nefs at his ftomach, and was fo bad that he thought he 
fbould have vomitted to death. They call it fea-fick- 
nefs. 

Rich. That is what he has gained by running away, 

Mr. Bill. ** Oh I my poor parents I my poor father 
and mother !" cried he inceiTantly ; " '••hey will never 
feemem.ore! Oh miferable fool that I am to have 
brought this afiii^ion on them !" 

vCracic! went fomething on the deck. '* Heaven 
have mercy on us j" cried the failors, turning as pale 
as death, and clafping their hands together. " What 
is the matter ?" alked Robinfon, who was half-dead 
with affright. 

** Ah ! v/eareaJl lofl !" anfwered one of the fea- 
men ; '* the lightniii-g has ihivered our mizen-matl ta 
pieces,'' (thatis, tise hindmofc of the three mails that 
are \n a fljip,) ** and the main-mall: {lands by fo llender

board." 

** We are all loil !'* cried out another voice froni 
below ; ** ihe fljip has fprung a leak, and thereare 
four feet water in the hold.'* . 

/U thefe words Robinfon, who was fitting down oo 
the cabin floor, fell backwards void of fenfe and mo- 
tion. All^jEhe reft ran to the pumps, in order, if poOi- 
ble, to keep the \ elfel afloat. At lall, one of the fail*

thing for t!ie prcfervation of the fljip, hut lie there 
ftretched at his IcDgtli while all the reft of the people 
worked until they were not able to ftand. 

Ke tried, therefore, to rife, weak as he was, and took 
h's place at one of the pumps. In the mean (ime the 
captain ordered fome guns to he fired as a fign .1 of dif- 
trefs to other Oiip?. if there fliould happen to be any 
within hearing capable of adifling them. Robinfon, 
who d'd not know the meaning of thefe fliots, thought 
the vellel was fplirting in pieces, and fainted away 
again. One of the Tailors, wlio took his place -at the 
pump, puflx-d h"m on rne fide witli his foot, and left 
him there ftretched at full length, imagining that he 
was dead. 

They pumped with all their ftrength; nevertbelefs 
the water frill gained upon theni in the h(Id, and now 
they only v/i:ted for the moment when ti.e veifel vvuuld 
fink. In order to lighten her, thty threw overboard 
every thing that they could pofiioly fpare, as the guns, 
bales of goods, hogiliead^, &c. But all that was ofno 
irianner of lervice. 

However, another fliip had heard their Hgnals of dif- 
trefs, and, as the ftoim began about this time to 
abat^^ confiderably, ventured to fend out her boat, in 
order, if poirible, to lave the crev/. But the beat 
could not come near, the waves running too high. At 
length, hovv^ever, they came near enough to throv/ a 
rope to the people who were on board, by means of 
which they towed the boat clofe under the Ihip's ftern, 
and then every one who could make ufe of his legs 
eagerly jumped into it. Robinfon, who could not 
ftand upon lib, was tumbled in haftily by fome of the 
feamen more companionate than the reft. 

They had hardly rowed m.any minutes, before the 
(hip, which was ftill pretty near them, lunk be ore their 
eyes. Happily the ftorm was ijow almolt totally abated, 
otherwife the waves would inevitably have fwallowcd 
up the boat, which was thei\ as full of people as it 
could hold. After many dangers it got fate at length 
to the fbip, where they were all taken in. 

Geo. Ah! well, I am glad, however, that the poor 
people were not drowned. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. ig 

Edvj. I was ladly in pain for them. 

Harriet. Weil, this will teach mafter Robinfon never 
to be fo naughty again, 

Mrs. Bill. That is jull: my opinion too. Let us 
hope that he will be the better for this d .nger. 

Henry. Well, what became of him after ? 

Mr. Bill. The Ihip that had taken him and the red of 
the crew in, was bound to London. In four days fl-se 
arrived at theNore, and the next day canie to anchor in 
. the river. 

Charlotte. What is the Nore, papa ? 

Mr. Bill. The Nore is a fmall fandy bank at the 
mouth of the Thames, where a velfel is conftuntly fta- 
tioned, which hangs up two lights every night to be a 
guide tofliips that enter the river. 

They now landed, and happy was each one to have 
thus efcaped the dangers of the fe-i. As to Robinfon, 
his firll care was to fee Londun, and for this purpofe he 
Ipent a day or two in rambling all over the city, where 
Le met with fuch a variety of new objeds as entirely 
put the remembrance of pall dangers out of his head, 
as well as all thoughts of the future. Hajipening one 
day £0 meet rhe captain with whom he had iti far! from 
Plymouth, he received an invitition Co dine with Lim, 
which was very agreeable to Robinfon, as he had fpent 
what little money he had borrowed from the captain's 
fen, and his pocket now was not able to aftord him a 
finglemeal. At dinner the captain alked him what par- 
ticular iiiotivc he had for going to Amflcrdain, and what 
he intended to have done therv.-. Robinfon anrvvcred 
him frankly, that he had noching in view but his amufe- 
ment ; that be had come oH' unknown to his father and 
mother, and at prefent did not know what to do with 
himfelf. 

" Unknown to your father and mother !" cried the 
captain, laying down his knife and fork : " Good hea- 
vens I why did not I know that before? Believe me, 
imprudent young man, if 1 had known fo much at fly- 
mouth, J would not have taken you on board of my 
fhip, \i you had offered me a million of money." 

Robinfon fat with down-caft eyes blufliing for Ibajne, 
"and unable to anfwer a fingle word. 

The

The honed captain conrinued to reprcfent to him the 
folly that he had been guilty of, and told him that he 
could never be happy unlefs he repented of what he 
bad done, and obthi.ned forgivencfs of his parents. At 
thcfe words Robinfon wept bitterly. 

^ ** Bat \A hat can I do now ?" cried he at length, fob- 
bing heavily : ** Return to your parents, fall on your 
Jinees before them, and, like a fenfihlc and dutiful lad, 
implore their pardon for your imprudence : that is what 
you can do, and what you ought to do." 

Harriet. Ah, p3pa. Hike this captain much ; he was 
a very good man. 

Mr. EilL My dear, he did what- every one ought to 
do when he fees his fellow* creature fall into an error j 
he endeavoured to bring this young man back to his 
duty. 

** Will you take me with you to Plymouth again ?" 
faid Rol^infoj]. 

** Who, 1 ?'' faid the captain : *' Have you forgot,- 
then, that my Ibip is loft ? It may be a confiderable 
time before 1 return there in a Ihip of my own : but as 
for you, there is not a moment to Icfe ; you fhould go 
aboard of the very firft velTel that fails for Plymouth, if 
it W'ere even to-day. 

*' But," fays Robinfon, ** I have no money," 

** Well," laid the honeftcaptain, *' I willlend you 
a couple of guineas out of the little that I have to fpare. 
Go down to the river, and get aboard of fome veifel 
that is bound for Plymouth, unlefs you rather chufe to 
travel by land. If yourrepentance is fincere, God will 
blefs your return, and make it happier tlian youroutfet 
has been." With thefe words, having made an end of 
dinner, he (Look Robinfon by the hand, and wilhed 
him a good voyage, who parted from him with many- 
thanks for his kindnefs and good advice. 

Ediv. What, is he going bnck home again already ? 
I thought the ftory uas only beginning. 

Mrs. bill Are not you fatished, then, n)y dear Ed- 
v^ard, that he Ihould go home to his parents, and put 
an end to the forrow and diftrefs that they fuffer on his 
account ?

or three ftreets of London !'' 

This thcugiir made him flop (hort. One moment he 
feemed determined not to go home yet ; again, he re- 
-fle6tedon what tlie captain had told him, that he would 
never be happy unlefs he returned to his parents. For 
a long time he was at a lofs what to refolve on. At 
length, hov.ever, he went down to the river ; but there 
he learned, to his great fatisfaCtion, that there was not 
a ungle veffel in the river bound for Plymouth. The 
pcrfon who gave him this information was a captain of 
a iliip in the African trade, who was ihortly to fet fail 
•for the coaft cf Guinea. 

Charlctte. Where is the coaft of Gi'inea, papa? 

Mr. Bill. Henry can tell you that j he knows where 
it lies. 

Henry. Don't you remember there is a country called 
Africa ? Very well ; one part of the coaft—— 

Charl.tie. Coail I Wjiat is that ? 

Henry, The land that lies along by the fea-fide. 
Hold, here's Fenning's Geographv : look at this fttie

that the ''O) age would be exceedingly pleafant ; that, 
fo far fram coiling him any thing, it might turn out a 
very proHtiible adventure, Robinlbn's eyes began to

breall with fuch force that he immediately forgot every 
ads ice v/liich the honefl: Plymouth captain had given 
J)im, and all the good refolutions that he himfelf had 
taken but fo fliort a time before. 

** But," faid he, after confidering a while within 
himfclf, ** 1 have only two guineas in the world ; what 
ufe can I make of fo fmall a Turn in trading at the place

" I will lend you five more,"' faid the captain j 
*' that will be quite fufficient to purchafe you goods, 
which, if we have but tolerable iuccels, may make 
your fortune." 

** And what fort of goods mufl I purchafe ?" faid 
Robinfon. 

*' All forts of toys and playthings," anfwered the 
captain ; ** glafs, beads, knives, Iciirars, hatchets, 
ribbands, guns, &c. of which the negroes of Africa are 
fo fond that they will give you a hundred times the va- 
lue in gold, i^ ory, and other things." 

Robinfon was not able to contain himfelf for joy. 
He forgot, at once, his parents, friends, and country, 
** Captain," laid he, ** 1 am willing to go along with 
you when you pleafe." 

** Agreed !" replied the other, taking him by the 
hand, and thus the matttr was fettled. 

Rich, Well, now it is all over ; 1 (ball never have

Mr. Bil. No pit;, Richard ? 

Rich, No, papa : why is he fuch a fool as to forget a

Heaven prL-ferve you and every one of us from that 
nioft terrible of all punilhments, to feel that we alone 
have cau fed our own wretchednefs ! But whenever we

that he is our brother, our poor deluded brother ; we

All were filent for a few jroments ; after which Mr, 
BilUngfley continued in the following words : 

Robinfon made hafte to lay out his feven guineas. 
He purch'ifed with them fuch articles as the captain had 
mentioned to him, and had them carried on board. 

After fome days, the wind being favourable, the 
captain weighed anchor, and they itt fail. 

Henry. What courfe fliould they hold to arrive at 
Guinea ? 

Mr. Bill. Here, you have Fenning's Geography:,! 
fliould think you cannot be at a lofs to know, as you 
pointed out to your fifter the Coaft of Guinea juft now. 
However, I will ihew you tlieir courfe. You fee,

into the Downs. Afterwards they fteer Weft, through 
the Britill) Channel, and enter the the great Atlantic 
Ocean, in which they continue their courfe- here ciole 
hy the Canary Iflands, until at lail they land herea- 
■bouts on the Coaft of Guinea. 

Henry. But at what particular fpot will they land? 

Mr. Bill. Perhaps there, near Cape Caftle. 

Mrs. Bill. Well, now I think it is high time for us

SECOND EVENING. 

THE next evening the whole company having 
taken their places as before,' Mr. Billingfley con- 
tinued his ftory in the following terms: 

Robinlon's fecond voyage began as favourably as the 
firft. They had already cleared the Channel without 
any accident, and" v/ere now in the middle of the At- 
lantic Ocean : here they met v/ith fuch contrary winds 
for feveral days fuccellively, that they found themfelves 
driven a considerable way towards the coafl: of America. 
Here, my dear children, I have brought you a large 
map, which willfhew you much better than a fmall one 
the courfe v/hich the fhip (hould have held, and that 
which the v/ind obliged her to take. They wanted to 
fteer do-vnall along this way, fo ; but becauie they 
had a iide wind from that quarter, they were driven, in 
fp'te of themfelves, towards this part, where you fee 
America lie. I will la) it dov/n here on the table that 
we may all call our eyes upon it v/henever there is oc- 
cafion. 

One evening the rr'^frfman declared that he faw a tire 
at a great dillance, and that he heard the firing of guns 
from the fame quarter. All hands immediately haftened 
Upon deck, where they both faw the fire and could di- 
ftindlly hear the report of feveral guns. The captain 
examined his maps, and found there was no land on 
that quinter withi.n the diftance of a hundred leagues ; 
and they all unaniiLouliy concluded that what they faw 
could be nothing elfe but a fbjp on tire. 

It was immediately refolved to allift theveffei in dif- 
trcfs, and they accordingly ileered that way. In a very 
fhort time thtir conjectures were verined ; for they be- 
held a large fi]!p aii in flinis^s, and burning with the 
greated fury. 

The captain infiantly ordered five guns to be iired as 
a (ignai to the poor people who were on board the burn- 
ing (hip, that help was at hand. Scarcely was this or- 
der put in eiccutioii, betore they faw, with terror and 

ailonilhmerjt. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 25 

afloninnTient, the fiiip which had been on fire blow up 
with a dreadful explofion j and immediately after every 
thing funk, and the fire was iecn no mere. It is to be 
obferved, that the flames had, at length, reached the 
powder room, and this was the caufe of the fhip's blow- 
ing up. 

Nobodv could tell as yet what was become of the 
poor people behinging to her. There was a p'oflibility 
that they might have taken to their boats before the vei- 
fel blew up; for which reafon the captain continued 
firing guns the whole night, in order to infuimi them on 
what quarter the fhip was that defired to aflitl them. 
He alio ordered all t!ie lanterns to be hung out, that 
they mi^hthave a chance of keing the fiiip in the night 
time. 

At break of day they difcovered, by means of 
their glalTes, two boats full of people, tolling about at 
the me[<;y of the waves. They couid perceive that the 
wind was againil them, but that they rowed with all 
their force tov/ards the (h'p. Immediately the captain 
ordered the colours to be hoifted as a fignal that he faw 
their difbrefs, and was ready to relieve them. At the 
(ame time the (hip made all the fail polfible towards 
them, and in tlie fpace of half an hour happily carae 
up with them. 

There v/ere fixty in the boats, men, women, and 
children, who were all taken on board. It was an af- 
fefling fcene to behold the aftions of thefe poor people 
when they faw themleives fo happily delivered. Some 
lobbed and wept for joy, others lamented as if their 
danger was but juil begun; i'ome jumped about upon 
the deck as if th<'y had loft their wits, others were 
wringing their hands, and as pale as death; feveral cf 
them viore laughing like m^^d people, and danced and 
{houtedfcr joy; others, on the contrary, ftocd ftock- 
ftill as if fpcechiefs ard infenfible, and could not utier 
a fingle word. 

Somelines one or two amongd them feil on their 
knees, lifted up their hands to Heaven, and with a loud 
vo'ce returned tljcini^s to God, whole providence had 
lo miraculoufly laved them from perifhing, 

B Some 



20 T H E N L VV 

Some of them acrain would flart up, dance about 
like children, tear their cIoatHs, cry and fall down in 
fainting htc, from v/hich they could uith difficulty be 
recovered. There was none of the fln'p's crew, though 
c\'er fo hardened, that could help lledding tears at the 
fjght of thefe poor people's extravagant behaviour. 

Among thtui happened to be a young prieft, who 
a£ted with more firmnefs and dignity than any of the 
refi-. As foon as he fet his foot upon the deck, he fell 
upon his face, and fecmed to have loft all lenfe and 
motion. The captain went to alTift him, thinking that 
he h?.d fwooned away ; but the clergyman calmly 
thanked him for his good-nature, and faid, *' Allow 
me firtr to return thanks to my Creator for our deliver- 
ance ; I will afterwards endeavour to (hew you how 
lively a fenfe I entertain of your extreme kindnefs to 
us." Upon th's the captain politely w^'thdrew. 

The prieft remained a few minutes in this potlure of 
humble proftration ; after which, fifing chearfully, he 
went to the captain to teftify his gratitude to him for 
the civility that he had ihev/n to hini and his people. 
This done, he turned to his companions in misfortune, 
and faid, ** My dear friend?, calm the agitation of 
jour minds. The Being v/ho is fupremely good^ hatli 
vouchfafed toftretch out a father's hand over you. You 
lijculd lift up your hearts to him, and thank him with- 
out delay for the unexpefted prefervation of your lives." 
There were fcveral of them who a6lc.d in conformity to 
his exhortations, and immediately began to return 
thanks to Heaven with fervour and devotion. 

After this tiie prieft gave the captain an account who 
'they were, and what had happened to them. 

The (hip that was burnt was a large French mer- 
chantman, bound for Quebec — Here, you fte ; this 
fpot in America — The hre broke out m the fail room, 
and burned with fuch rapidity as baffled all their endea- 
vours to ftop it. They had barely time to fire fome 
guns as figHttls of their diftrefs, and then to take to their 
boats, uricertain of the deftiny that awaited them. 
The moft likely profpe<5t before them in that moment 
of horror was, that, upon the leaft fwell of the fea, the 
waves would fwailcv/ up them and their boats, or eife

that long and difmal ni^,ht between hope and ft ar, ex- 
erting all tlieir ftrength to get to the fnip, but continually . 
driven back by the winds and waves. At length, how- 
ever, the long-w.iihed-for appearance of day puc an end 
to their difiief'. 

Robinfon all this time had been filled with the mofl: 
dreadful refedions. " Heavens '" faid he to himtx-lf,

many good and devout perfons, liave lufrered i'o greac

with his hands clafped tog-ther, and fcarcely daring

no regard to his prayers. 

The people who werefaved from the boats, and were 
almotl exhaufted with fatigue, had now taken lome rc- 
frelhment, v.-hen their captain, holding n large purfe full 
of money in his hand, came up to the (hip's captain, 
and told him thrft whatevt^r money they had been able 
to fave from their 'lip ^^^'^i in that purfe, vvhich he beg- 
ged him to accept as allight markol the gratitude which 
they all eotercained towards hiin for the prefeivation of 
their lives. 

" God forbid," anfvv'ercd the captain, *^ that I 
fiiouid accept )our offers ! I have done no more than

would have done the fame thing if yoix had bCwn in our •

In vain did the Frenchman prefs him to accept t!>c 
purfe ; the cjptain perfifted in refilling it, and begged 
him to lay no more about it. — It was now debated 
where the) fliould land the people that had been faved. 
To carry tlieni to Guinea did not appear advifeaiile for 
two reafon?. In the firft place, why fliould thofe poor 
people be obliged to make lb long a voyage to a country 
where they had not the leaft bufinefs in the world ? And 
bef.des there were not provifions enough aboard for io 
many people to hold out until they fliould arrive at 
Guinea. 

At length the captain generoufly refolved to go a 
hundred leagues out of his way for the fake of thefe 
poor people, and to carry them to Newfoundland, where 
they might have an opportunity of returning to France 
in ibnle of the (hips employed in the cod (ifliery. 
Harr.ef, What is that? 

Rich. Do not you remember what papa has told us 
about the cod fifli ; how they come down from the North 
ieas to the very banks of xNewfoundland, where people 
fifl: for them and catch them in fuch quantities ? 
Harriet, Oh, yes \ now I recollect. 
Rich, Look here on the map : this is Nevi^foiindland 
up here, near to America, and thofe dotted ipots are 
the banks where they fiih for the cod. 

Mr. Bill, To New/oundland, therefore, they bent 
their courfe; and as it happened to be the middle of 
the hilling ieafon, they found feveral French velTels 
th.ere, which took on board the people of the fliip that 
had blown up. Their gratitude to th^ Englifli captain 
was too great to be exprefled in woi'ls. 

As he had now, therefore, conducted ihem to ftiips 
of their own nation, he returned with a favourable 
wind, in order to continue his own voyage to theCoall 
of Guinea. The fti'p cut the waves with the fwiftnels 
of a bird that wings its airy way through the fliies, and 
in a ftiorc time they had failed fome hundred leagues. 
This was what Rohinlbn Crufoe liked; things never 
could go too faft for him, as he was of a reftlefs, un- 
letiled difpofition. 

Their courfe now was moftly directed to the South- 
ward. One day as they were fleering in thai diredtioM, 

they

tliey perceived a large fiiip making up towards them. 
Preiently after they heard them fire fome guns of dif- 
trels, and could difcern that they had loft their forc- 
mafl and their bowCprir, 

Ediv, Bowfprit ? What is that ? 
Mr. BUI. Why, iurely, you cannot have forgot what 
that is. 

Edw. Ah! right! It is a little mafl that does not 
ftand llraighs up like the refi, but comes out floping, 
fo, from the fore-part of the fl;ip. 

Mr, Bill Very well. They (leered their courfe to- 
wards the fl-ipthat was in diftrefs, and when they were 
within hearing of each other, ih<^ people aboard of her 
cried out, ** For Heaven's lake have compailion on us, 
and fave our lives! We are at the lafl- extremity, and 
nuift perifh if you do not relieve us." 

The captain, therefore, afked thenr in what confift- 
ed their diilrefs J when one of their number anfwered 
thus: 

** We are Englifhmen, bound fur the French Jiland 
of Mirtinico" — See, children; here it lies in the Weft 
Indies — " We took in a cargo of coffee there; and 
while we were King at anchor, and juft ready to de- 
part, our captain and mate, with moft of the (hip's 
crew, went afhore one Jay to get in a few things for 
the (hip's ufe. In their abfence, there arofe fo vio'ent 
a ftorm that our cable was broke, and we were driven 
out from the harbour into the open fea. The hurri- 
cane" 

Geo. \Vhat is that, papa? 

Mr. Bill. It is a kind of whirb.vind occafioned by 
many winds blowing from dlFereni quarters, one againft 

the other. 

" The hurricane," continued he, ** blew furioufly 
three days and three nights. We loft our mafts, and 
weie diiven fome hundreds of leagues out to i'ea. Un- 
fortunately we are moll of us paflengers, with but one 
leaman and a boy or two on board to work the (hip ; 
fo that for nine weeks we have beeji driven about at the 
mercy of the winds aud waves ; all our provjfions are 
gone, and many of us are \^ this moment, -jying^witli 
hunger."

3© 'i' H L N E W 

Immediately the good cnptain ordered out Iiis boat, 
took lome pr .vificns, and went aboard the (hip, ac- 
ccm.panied by RoHinfon Criifoc. 

The\ found the crev/ reduced to the moft deplorable 
condition pollible; they iill looked as if they were 
ftar\cd, and many of them could hardly Aand. But 
wlien they v.-ent into the cabin — Heavens! what a 
blocking fpe^acle they beheld ! A mother, with her 
Ion and a young maid fervant, were ftretched on the 
floor, and, to all appearance, ftarved to death. The 
mother, already quite ftiiF, was fitting on the ground 
between two chairs tied together, with her face leaning 
againfi one of the planks of the Hiip's fide. The maid 
fer\snt was firetched at her length bcfide her miftrefs, 
and had one of her arms clafped round the foot of the 
table. As to the young man, he was laid upciia bed, 
and had Pdll in his mouth a piece of a leather glove, of 
which he had gnawed away the greatefl: part. 

Harriet. Oh! papa, what a fljocking account this is ! 
Mr. Bill. Right — 1 had forgot that you did not wiHi 
to hear any thing melancholy. Well, then, I will pufs 
by this ftorx'. 

Ail. Uh no ? Oh no ! Dear papn, let us have the 
whole of \i nov/. 

iX^r. }^ilL ' Asyou pleafe. I mufl tell you t])en, in 
the fird place, who rliefe poor people v^ere ih it \z)' 
flretched m tliis deplorable manner. 

They were com.mg paifengers in this ft^jip fom Ame- 
rica to England. The whole crew faid that (hey were 
very wortny pe';ple. T^-e morher was fo rema'kably 
fond of htr Ion, that flje refufed all manner of nourilh- 
irient purpofcly that her fon might have fomething to 
eat, and this excellent young man had done the fame 
thing, in order to rel'erve every thing for his rricther. 
The faithful maid fervant v.'as mere concerned for her 
niafier and miiirefs than for herfelf. 

They were thought to be dead, all three, but, on 
examinaiion, appeared to have fome remains of life; 
for, after a few drops of broth had been forced into their 
iTiouths, they began, by degrees, to open their eyes. 
But the mot er was now too weak to fwallowany thing ; 
and ibe made fgns that they (hould coijfine their attcn-

tions to her Ton. In efFed, lie expired a few minuieG 
after. 

The other t<Aro were brought to themfelves by the 
force of cordials, and as they were in the flower of their 
age, the captain, by his attentive care, fjcceeded in re- 
floring them to life. But when the young man turned 
his eyes upon his mother, and faw that (he was dead, 
the (liock made him fall again intoafwoon, from which 
it was very difficult to recover him. Howevet, they 
were fortunate enough to bring hirp to his fenfesagani, 
and he wasj in a ihort time, perft6lly re^efiabli^Lccl ; 
as was ahb the fervanc maid. 

The captain furnifted the fliip in diftrefs with all the 
provifions that he could poflibly fpare ; he ordered his 
carpenter to put up marts for them in the roQm of thofe 
that had been broken, and gave the crew proi)er inftruc- 
tions for conveying chemfel vet, to the nearell Und, which 
was that of the Madeira iflands. He bent nis courfe 
thither alfo, on purpofe to take in more provifions. 

One of thefe idands, you know, is called Madeira,. 
from which the reft take their name. 

He;jry, Yes, 1 know it ; they belong to the PortU' 
guefe. 

Ruk From them the fine Madeira wine comes ; does 
it not ? 

Geo, And the fugar canes. 

Mr. BHI. The fame. At this ifiand the captain cafl 
anchor ; and RobTnfon went afhore with him in the af- 
ternoon. 

He could never fufficiently admire the beautiful prof- 
peft which this fertile ifle affords. As far as his eyes 
could fee, the mountains were all covered with vines. 
How his mouth watered at the fight of the delicious 
grapes that hung on them ! and how did he regale him- 
lelt when the captain paid for him that he might have 
leave to eat his till ! 

They underfrood from thofe who were in the vine- 
yards, that in making wine they did not prefs the grapes 
here in a wine prefs, as they do in other countries. 

Geo. How then ? 

Mr, BilL They tumble the grapes into a large tub, 
B 4 iind

and th-en tread upon them with their feet, or bruife rhem 
with their'elhows. 

Hatii^,\ Oh fie ! I fhall not like to drink Madeira 
wine for the future. 

Riib. Now I (hould not like to drink it, if it were 
even made \^ifh the wine preis. 

Chariot fe. Why? 

Rich. Ah ! you were not h^re when papa fliewed ua 
that wine is not good for young people. If you were 
10 know cill the harm that it can do them ! 

Chill lottf. Is he in earneft, papa ? 

Mr. B II. Yes, my dear ; nothing can be more true. 
Children that drink wine or other ftrong liquors often, 
bccon-se weak and filly. 

Charlotte. Gracioas! Til never drink wine any more. 

Mr. Hill. You will ad very wifely, my dear. 

As the captain v/as obliged to ftop here fome time to 
repair his (hip vvliich had received a little damage, poor 
Kobinfon, at the end of a few days, began to grow 
tired of his fituation. His refilefs temper wanted fome 
change, and he wi(l;ed to have wings that he ri,ight fij 
all over the world in as fhort a time as poilibler 

Jufl at th's interval arrived a Fortuguefe Ihip that came 
from Lilbon, and was bound for Brazil, in South America. 

Henry ( i^oiniir.g to the map J. Is it not this country 
tere, belonging to the Portuguefe, and where fo mucli 
gold duft and precions- flones arc found ? 

/;//•. Bill. The very fame. 

Robinfon get acquainted v.-ith the captain of this fljip, 
and hearing him talk of gold-dufi and precious flcnes, 
he would have given the world to m.ake a voyage to 
Brazil, where he thought he fhouid till his pockets with 
d.amonds. 

Ediv. He did not know, I fuppofe, that ;n t:,at country 
nobody dares to gather goid dull: or precious (tones, 
which are the (ble property of the king of i'ortugal. 

Mr. Bill. And the reafon that he did not know wa-?, 
bccaufe when he was young he would never learn mvj 
thing. 

Finding therefore, that the Portuguefe captain was 
dii'poftd to take him along with him as one of his crew, 
ii:d that the EngiiOi (hip would be obliged to (top at leail 

a for. night 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 33 

a fortnight longer, he could not refift his defire of ram- 
bling. He, therefore, told his good friend, the Englifh 
captain, bluntly, that he was going to leave him, and to 
take a voyage to Brazil. The captain, who had learn- 
ed from Robinfon himfelf, a (hort time before, that he 
was rambling thus about the world without the know- 
ledge orconfent of his parents, was ghd to get rid of 
him. He agreed to take Rohinibn's venture, which con- 
fined of toys and hardware, for the money that he had 
lent him in England, and gave him befides all manner of 
good advice. 

Robinfon, therefore, went aboard the Portuguefe 5. 
and now behold him failing for Brazil. They palTed 
pretty near the ifle of Tenerilf, 

Harriet. Where that high mountain is to be feen,.call- 
cd the Peak of TenerifF; eh, papa ? 

Rich. Aye, aye, don't interrupt. 

Mr. Bill. It was an admirable profpe£l, even long 
after fun-fet in the evening, when all the fea was cover- 
ed with gloomy darknefs, to fee the top of that moun- 
tain, one of the higheft in the whole world, (bine with 
the rays of the fun as if it had been all on fire. 

St)me days after they faw another fight upon the fea, 
which was very agreeable. A large number of flying 
fifnesrofe upon the furface of the water. They gliilen- 
ed like polilhed filver, lb that they threw forth a flrong 
light from their bodies, as it were in rays. 

Charlotte, What, are there fifties that fly ? 

Mr. Bill.. Yes, Charlotte ; and 1 think, on a certain 
day, you and I faw one. 

Geo. Ah, yes ; that was when we were in town lad 
•Whitfuntide: but for alL that,.papa, it had neither fea- 
thers Ror wings.. 

Mr.BilK But it had a couple of long fins, which, 
ferve it as v^ings when it rifcs above the furface of the;- 
water. 

Forfeveral days fuccelfively the voyage was as fine as 
polfible J but all of a fudden a violent hurricane arofe 
from the South- Eafi. The waves frothed and rofe moun- 
tain high, tolfing^ the veflel to and fro. This dreadful 
ftorm continued for (ix days fuccefiively, and carried the 
(Kip .0 far out of her way, that neither, the captain nor 
5 any 



54 T H E N E W 

any perfon on hoanl Icnew where they were. However, 
by their reckoning, they luppoied that they could not 
be far from the Caribbee Iflands. They lie hereabouts. 

The feventh morning, exa6lly at day-break, one of 
the failors threw the whole crew into a fit of extrava- 
gant joy, by crying out from the mall head, Land ! 

Mrs, BilL Tin's call comes very fcafonably, for fup- 
pcr is almoft ready in the next room* To-morrow we 
ihdll hear the refl-. 

(tcc. O dear mama, only let us hear how they landed, 
and what happened to them afterwards. I ihould be con- 
tented with a bit of ilry bread, if papa would but go on. 

A/r. Bi^l. Well, my dear, as your mama only fays 
that fupper is aifMj? ready, perhaps there may be a few 
n:inutes to fpare. If (he will indulge you until fupper 
is quite ready, I am content. 

A'Irs. Bill. 1 have no objection : fo that you may go 
on until I call you, which iball be when every thing is 
perfeftly ready. 

^r 

Ing } 

Mr. Bill. To proceed, therefore, with my ftory : 

The whole crew haften<;d upon deck to fee what land 
this v/as 5 but in the very moment their joy was chang- 
ed into terror and confterriation : the (hip ftruck and 
all thofe who were upon the deck received fo \iolen.t a 
fiiock as alrr^ofi to throw them backwards. 

Fic6. What was the iuatter ? 

//ir. BilL ^*he (hip had run upon a fand bank, and 
ftuck fad as fuidf.niy as if it had been naiied to the fpct.. 
Then the fu^iming waves dafhed over the deck with iuch 
violence, that they v/ere ali obliged to take refuge m the 
cabin and betwesr. decks, for fear of bciiig carried over- 
board. 

Nothing v.-r'.s now to be heard amongft the crew but 
lamentable cries, grodp.s, and hghs, that would have 
foftened a heart of llcne. Some wer^ praying, others 
wept aloud ; fome tore their hair like people m defpair, 
others v/ere half dead, and flupidly infcnfbL. Amongft 
this iaft clafs was Robinfon Crufoe, who w^s literally 
mors cie?^d than alive. 

Stidtely 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 35 

-Suddenly fome one cried out that the fiiip had fplit, 
Thefe dreadful tidings brought them all to new life. 
They ran haltily upon deck, lowered the boat as fad 
as pollible, and all jumped into it with the moft precipi- 
tate hafte. 

But there were now fo many people in the boat, that 
its fides were fcarcely four inches above the. water. 
The land was ftill far off, and the ftorm {o violent, that 
every one thought it impoilible to reach the (hore. Ne- 
verthelefs, they exerted their whole fbrength in rowing, 
and fortunately the wind drove them towards land. All 
at once they beheld a wave, mountain high, rolling.to- 
v/ards the boat. 

At this dreadful fight the whole crew fat motionlefs, 
and dropped their oars. The huge wave ftrikes the 
boat, overfets it, and all are at once iwallowed up in the 
enraged deep I 

Here Mr. BilHngOey made a flop ; the whole corn- 
pany remained fiient, and many of them could not help 
iighing with compailion for the [ate of the poor Teamen. 
At length Mrs. billingfiey arriving with the news that 
tiipper v/as ready, put an end to thefe melancholy ideas. 



THIRD EVENING. 

QEORCE. Dear papa, is poor Rjbinfon Crufce lofc 
fcr good ? h he deed ? 

Mr. liz'U We left hitn lail: night in the raoft imminent 
danger oflofing his'life, the boat being overfet. 

Robinlbn w^s fvvallowed up in the iea along with the 
red of the fliip'^s company; but the fame wave, that 
tireadtul wave, which had buried him in the deep, at its 
return drew him along with it, and dafijed him tou'ards 
the fi]ore. He was ihrov/n with fuch violence upon a 
piece cfa rock, that the pain occafioned by thejoj't rouf- 
ed him from the date 'ofalmofi infenfibiiity tint he was 
in before. iJe o^en^ed his eyes, and feeing hin.fcif, con- 
trary to all f.xptdation, upon drv ground, he e;.trted 

the 



36 T H E N E VV 

the laft efforts of his flrcngth to gain tie top of tht 
bcrich. 

He ranched it at length, but the rriomcnt that he ar- 
rived at rliis fpot of lafety he fainted away with fatigue, 
and remained a long time v\ithout fenfe or motion. 

When he recovered, he opene 1 his eyes and looked 
round. Heavens, what a profpefl ! The ftiip, the boat, 
liis companions, all loft ! There was nothing to be {(^en 
but a few broken planks, which the waves drove to- 
wards the fhore. He alone was faved out of the whole 
ftiip's company. 

Trembling at once with fear and joy, he fell upon hi* 
knees, lifted up his hands towards Heaven, and, while 
he ihed a flood of tears, returned thanks aloud to the 
Maker of Heaven and Earth for his miraculous prefer- 
vaiion. 

Kith. But, papa, why did God Almighty fave Ro- 
binfon Crufoe alone, and fuffcr the reft to perifti ? 

Mr. Bill, My dear Richard, are you always able to 
difcover the reafons why we who are fo much older than 
you, and who love you tenderly, z&. towards you in 
this manner or that ? 
Rich. No. 

Mr. Bill. Lately, for inftance, when the day was fo 
fine, and we had ali fo great a fancy to go on a nutting 
party, what did I do ? 

Rich. I have not forgot it. Poor Edward was obliged 
to flay at home and keep houfe, and the rel\ of us were 
' forced to go to Richmond, and not on the nutting 
party. 

Mr, Bill. But why was 1 fo cruel to poor Edward, 
not to let him go with us ? 

Ed^, Ah, 1 know the reafon of that. James came 
prefently after, and took me to Lady Caftleton's. Fre- 
derick, my oid playfellow, was juft come home from 
fchcol, and begged his mama to fend for me. 

Mr. Bill. And was not that better than to go a nut- 
ting? _ 
tdvj. Oh yes, a hundred times. 
Mr. Bill, i had fent word before to Lady Caflleton, 
ihac you fliould ^Q and fee her ion, as iht requefted ; 

and 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 37 

anH therefore it was that I ordered you to flay at home. 
And, Richard, what did you meet at Richmond ? 

Rich. I met you there, papa, and my mama. You 
were there before me. 

Mr. Bill, That too I knew ; and, therefore, I made 
you for that time go to Richmond, and not on the nut- 
ting party. My intention in all this never once entered 
your heads, for you did not know my reafons. But why 
did not I tell you thefe reafons ? 

Rub. That you might alTord us an unexpected plea- 
fure. 

Mr. Bill. Juft fo. Well, my dear children, do you 
Mot think that our heavenly Feather loves his children, 
that is to fay, all mankind, as much as we love }ou ? 
Gee, Certainly, and more. 

Mr, Bill. And have you not learnt long ago, thai 
God knows all things better than we poor mortals do, 
wfiofe knowledge is fo contracled, and who can fo fel- 
dam tell what is really for our own advantage ? 

Rich. Yes ; I believe it. G-d has a knowledge that 
is without bounds, and, therefore knows every thing 
that will come to pafs ; a knowledge that we have no 
idea of. 

Mr. Bill. Since, therefore, God loves all mankind as 
his children, and is at tlie fame time fo wife that he 
alone knows what is really ufeful for us, it is impoifible 
but he (bould do what is bell for our intereft. 

Geo. Without doubt, ard fo he does continually. 
Mr, Bill. But are we always able to dilcover the rea- 
fons why God doth any action that affeds us in one par- 
ticular manner rather than in another? 

Rich. To dilcover them, we fhould have as much 
knowledge and wifdom as God himfelf. 

Mr. Bill, Well, my dear Richard, do you will] nov7 
to repeat the queftion that you alked me juft now ? 
Rich. What queftion ? 

Mr, Bill. Why the Supreme Difpofer of things favcd 
only Robinfon Crufoe, and fuffered the reft to perifti ? 
Riih. No. 

Mr. Bill, Why not? 

Rich. Becaufe I fee now that it was an unreafpnable 
•jueftion, 

Mr. 



33 T H E N E W 

Mr. Bill. Unreafonable ! How ? 

Rich. Becaufc our Maker knows very well why he 
docs any action, and we are not capable of knowing it. 

Mr. Bill. The Ruler of the Univerfe had therefore 
reafons which were wife, excellent, and worthy of him- 
felf, for luftering the whole crew lo perifii, and faving 
only the life of Uobinfon Crufoe. But thefe reafons are 
infcrutable to us. We may, indeed, carry our conjec- 
tures to a certain length, but we ought never to flatter 
ourfelves that we have hit upon the truth. 

For inftance, infinite wifdom might forefee that a 
longer life would be more hurtful than advantageous to 
thofe whom he fu.Tered to perifli : they might fall into 
great diflrtlTes, or even become wicked : for that rea- 
fon, perhaps, he removed them from this world, and 
conducted their immortal fouls to a place v,'here they 
arc' happier than here. As for Robinibn Crufoe, proba- 
bly his life was preferved to the end that affli(S.ion might 
be a I'chool of wifdom to him ; for God, being a kind 
fither, a^l w'fe and all jull:, fends adverf ty to turn the 
hearts of men, when they are blindly infenfible to his 
gojdnels and fupport. 

Keep this in renwimbrance, my dear child, through 
the courfe of your life. You may meet with accidents 
and revtrfes in which you cannot perceive the dehgn of' 
Providence. Tiien, inftead of rafMy endeavouring to 
reafon or explain the feeminginconfiilency, lay to your- 
felf, ** God knows better than I what is for my good j 
I will, therefore, furFer with chearfulnefs this misfortune 
which he fends me as a trial. I am convinc<d that his 
clifpenfations of good and evil are ever intended to ren- 
der us better than we are*, I, for my part, v/iil there- 
fore labour to become (ot and ctrtairdy God will biels- 
an I reward my endeavours." 

Henry, Did Robinfon thinkib upon that occafion ? 

Mr. Bill. Yes, then when he hud been in ib great 
danger of perifiiiog, c.nd faw himfelf cut oit fi*m all the 
world, then he f^it fmcerely how unjuft and blameable 
his conduit had been j ihtn lie praved to Heaven, on 
his knees, for pardon j and then he lOok the ftedfalt re- 
foluiion cf amerding his life, and of never doing any ac- 
tion contrary to the v/arniri^ ofhis conicience. " *. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 59 

Ed-jtj, But what did he do after that ? 
Mr. BilL When the joy that he felt on his happy 
deliverance had a little fublided, he began to reflefl on 
his fituation. He looked about him, but could fee no- 
thing except trees and thickets ; he could not perceive, 
on any fide, ihe leaft mark that the country was inha- 
bited. 

This was a dreadful neceflity impofed upon him ; to 
live all alone in a ftrange country ! But his anxiety was 
ftill more dreadfully increaftd when this reflection oc- 
curred to him. What, if there ihould be wild beafls or 
fa\ ages here, fo that I Ihould not be able to live a mo- 
ment in fafety .' 

Charktte, What are favages, papa ? 

Rich. Savages are wild men. Have you never heard 

talk of them, Charlotte? In countries, a great, great 

way off" from this, there are men nearly as wild as beads. 

Geo. That go almoft naked — What do you think of 

that ? 

FleKty. Aye, and know fcarce any thing in the wcrld. 
They cannot build themfelves houfes, nor make gar- 
dens, norfow and plant, as vvedo. 

Harriet, And they eat raw meat and raw filh. I heard 
my papa tell of them — Did not you, papa ? 

Rich. And would you think it? Theie poor crea- 
tures are entirely ignorant of their Maker, becaufe 
they never had any pcrfon to inftrutt them. 

Henry, It is for that reafon too that they are fo barba- 
rous. You would liurdly believe that fome of them eat 
human flefli. 

Chathtte. Oh I what wicked men ! 
Mr. Bill, What poor unhappy men ! you fhould fay, 
Alas! thefe poor people are lufficiently to be pitied, 
that they huve been brought up in this ignoriince, and 
live like brutes. 

Lharlcite. Do they ever come here ? 
Mr. Fill. No: the countries v;here thefe unfortunate 
people live are fo far off, that they never come here.' 
Their number alio grows lefs every day, becaulb otiicr 
civilized men, who come araongft'them, endeavour to 
inlhud aad civilize them, 

H.mj,

Henf-y. Were tbere, then, any cf thofe favages In 
thecountry Vv-here Robinlbn Crulbe was thrown by the 
ftorm ? 

Mr, Bill. Tliat he could not tell himfelf as yet. But 
having formerly heard that there were favages in the 
iflands and in this part of the woi-ld, he thought it very 
poilible that there might be fome on the particular fpot 
where he now was ; and in this thought railed fuch an 
apprehenfion of danger in his mind, that every bone of 
Lis body Hiook for fear. 

Geo. I do not doubt it. Tt would be no very pleafant 
mitt^r to meet with favages. 

Mr. BilL Fear, at firft, rendered him motionlefs ; he. 
did not dare to ftir ; the lead noife terrified him ; his 
heart was frozen : but a burning third forced him at 
length from tliis fearful date of inadion, ajid fent him 
up and down in fearch of fome brock or fpring to quench.

water where he might refrclh himfelf to his utmod wiQi.- 
Oh ! what a delicious treafure for a. man who was.

Robinfcn returned thanks to God for it, hoping, at. 
the fame time, that he would alfo vouchfafe him food.. 
** He who feeds the fowls of the air,'* faid he^. ** will- 
not fuder rce to perifti with hunger." 

I'lideed, hunger Vv^as^ not very prefl'ing on him at this- 
time ; fear and anxiety had taken away his appetite. 
He longed for red more than any thing elfe. His pain: 
and vexation of mind had fo overpov>?ered him that he 
could fcarce dand upon his legs. 

However, the quedion was, Where m.ud he pafs the' 
night? On the ground, under the open air ? Tbere 
he would be expofed to favages or wild beads that 
would devour him. Houfe, or cabin, or cave, he faw 
no figns of. He knew not what to do;, his didrefa-. 
brought tears into his eyes ; he cried heartily^ At 
length he refolved to imitate the birds, and like them 
to ieek a retreat in fome tree. Prefently he difcovered 
one, the boughs of which were fo thick and fo clofely 
interwoven, that he could fit amongd them, and even 
lay himfelf at his length very convenienily.. He. climbed. 

up 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 4' 

up this tree, offering up an earned prayer to his MaLer, 
then lettled himfelf, and fell faft afleep in a moment. 

While he ftept, his heated imagination repreiented to 
him afrelh the tranfaclions ot" the preceding day. Dif- 
turbed with tumultuous dreams, he fancied he ftill law 
the waves fwelling round him, and the fiiip linking. 
The cries of the feamen ftill foundetl in his ears. A/ter 
this, he imagined himlelf iranfported into the prefence 
of his parents : they appeared overwhelmed with fof- 
row and diftrefs for the lols of their beloved fon : they 
fighed, wept, lifted up rheir hands to Heaven, and were 
utterly deftitute of comfoTt. A cold i'vveat broke out 
all over his body : he cried aloud, ** 1 am not loft, my 
dear parents; I am reftored to you once more :*' and 
with thefe words, making a motion in his fleep as if 
to embrace his parents, he loft his feat amongft the 
branches, and fell down out of the tree. 
Harriet. Oh poor Robinfon ! 
Gee. J fuppofe he is killed now, 
Mr. llilL Fortunately for him, he had not fixed him- 
felf far up in the tree ; and the grafs was foJiigh upon 
the ground that his fall was not very fevere. In erieft, 
the ilight pain which it occafioncd him he hardly f^Xiy 
in comparifon to the anguifn he had fuffered in the con- 
flicts of his dream, a!)d which Hill agitated his whole 
body. I-fe, therefore, climbed up once more into the 
tree, and lay there quietly until fun-rife. 

He then began earneitly to confider how he fiiould 
procure himfelf food. He had no fort of victuals fuch 
as we ufe \n this part of the world, neither bread, nor 
meat, nor vegetables, nor milk j and, had he even 
been mafter of a joint of meat, he had neither fire, 
nor fpit to roaft it on, nor pot to boil it in. All the 
trees that he had {'ten hitherto were logwood-tiees, 
which never bear any fruit. 

Rich. What fort of trees are they, papa ? 
Mr, Bill. Thefe are trees the wood of which is of con- 
fiderable ufe in dying. They grow in fome countries 
of South America, and much of the logwood is brought 
to Europe. When it is boiled, the water turris of a 
reddifti black colour, and dysrs make ufe of it to give a 
fbade to ether colours. 

But 



42 T n E N E W 

But to return to JRobinfon Crufpe. 

Still uncertain what he fliould do, he came down from 
the tree. As he had eaten notliing the d.iy before, hun- 
ger begnn to be exceedingly troublefome to him. He 
rambled about for fc'veral miles, but found nothing, ex- 
cept grafs, and trees that bore no fruit. 

It v/as impoHiMe now to ddd to his diftrcfs : '* Mufl 
I, then, perifli with hunger at laft !" cried he, fobbing 
and looking up towards Heaven. However, neceifity 
reanimated him with frefli ft-ength (o go and learch 
carefully along the (hore fr r fometl-iing eatiible. 

But in vain : nothing but logwood-trees and Indian 
willow ; notMng but grafs and fand. At length, fa- 
tigued, v/eakened, and exhaufled, he threw himfelf 
down with his face to the ground, burd into tears, and 
wi(hed that he had periPjed in the waves of the Tea ra- 
ther than be prcTerved only to die a milerable death by- 
hunger. 

He thought of nothing therefore, now but of wait- 
ing in his forlorn fituation for the flow and dreadful ap- 
proach of death ; when, returning by chance, he faw 
a cormorant de\ ouring a fift that he had taken. Imme- 
diately he recollefled that he had fomewhere read the 
follov»'ing words : 

The Lord, who feeds with bounteous hand 

The feather'd tenant? of the air. 
Will furely over man expjnd • 

The v.-ings of his paternal care. 

He then reproached himfelf v/ith having put fo' 
little trull in Divine Providence; and, riling haftily, 
he determined to walk as far as ever his ftrength u'ould 
permiit him. He fuaped his courfe therefore, along the 
Chore, and looked narrowly about to difcover, if poih- 
ble, fomething that might ferve him for food. 

At length he perceived a number of oyfier fliells lying 
on the fliore. He ran eagerly tov;ards the fpot where 
they were, and carefully examined all round it, hoping 
to find oyfters thereabouts. He did find fome, and his 
joy was inexprelhble. 

FJck, 



ROBINSON CRUSOE: 43, 

Rick, Are there oyflers on land then ? 
Mr. Hill. Why no, not properly. On the contrary, 
they belong to the iea and live in it. There they faften 
themlelves to rock?, one upon another, in iranienfe 
quantities. Such a hean of them is called a bed of oyf- 
ters. Now, the wa/es,' indafliing againfl: this, loofens 
fpveral of the oyfters, and the tide cariies them towards 
the (hore. Afterwards, when the tide ebbs, and it is 
low water, thefe oyfiers are hk on the beach, where it 
is then dry. 

Ckarloite, You fay when the tide ebbs, papa, what 
is that? 

Harriet. What, don't you know that? !•■ is when the 
water that was fo high before, runs back, and grows 
quite fhallov/. 

Charlotte. W1iat v/ater ? 

Harriet. Why, the fea water, or a river like our 
Thames, where the tide comes up. 

Mr. Mrred. Charlotte, make your brother Richard 
explain that to yoii. He will be able to give you a 
clear idea of it. 

Rick. Who, I? Well, I will do my bed. Have 
you never obferved that the v^'ater of the Thames rifes 
fometimes pretty high at the bottom of our garden ; 
and then, after a while, falls bick and ieaves the ground 
dry ; fo that one can walk where it was but a little time 
before covered with v,;ater. 

Charlotte. Oh ! yes, now I remember to have {ttxi ft. 

Rick. We/I, when the water rifes in that manner, it 

is called the tide, or the flowing of the tide ; and when 

it falls back and leaves the ground dry, it is called the 

ebb. Thus we fay the tide ebbs and fl:;w3. 

Mr, hill, Befides this, you mull know, my deir 
Charlotte, that, in the courfe of four and twenty hours 
the water of the fea rifes thus twice, and falls twice. 
It continues to rife for a little more than fix hours, and 
then to fink for a little more than fix hours, The hours 
during Vi^hich it rifes, are called the time of the flow, 
and the hours during which it falls, are called the time 
of the ebb, Ho you underhand ic now ? 

Char hue. 



44 T H E N E W 

Charlotte. Ye? ; but why docs the fca always rife To ? 

Ce3. I think I have heard the reafon. It is faid, the 
moon attradls the waters in fuch a manner, that they are 
obliged to rife. 

Ed-^. Oh ? we have often hp:ird that. Let papa go 
on. 

Mr. Bill. Another time, Charlotte, I will tell you 
more upon this fubje6^. 

Robinfon was alnioft out of his wits for joy at having 
found fomeching to appeafe his raging hunger. The 
oyfters that he found did nor, it is true, lerve to fill his 
belly ; but he was fatisfied with having found fomething 
which barely made him forget his hunger as it were. 

His greaceft uneafinefs was next to know where he 
fliould dwell for the future, to be free from all dread of 
lavages and wild bcafls. His firft bed had been ^o 
inconvenient, that he could not tliink of his condition 
without iliuddering, if he fhould be obliged to pafs aU 
his nights in tiie fame manner. 

Geo. Oh ! 1 know very well what I would have done.. 

Mr, Bill. Well, what would you have done? In^ 
form us. 

Geo, In the fird: place, I would have built a houfe, 
with walls as thick ai that, and with iron gates — fo 
fcrong ! — And then 1 would hp.ve m.ade a ditch all round 
v.'ith a drawbridge, and this drawbridG^e I would have 
lifted up every night, and then the lavages mufr be 
pretty cunning if they could have done me any harm 
while I was afieep. 

Mr. Bill. Here is fine talking f It is a p'ty that you 
had not been there. You would have been able to give 
poor Robinfon excellent advice. — But — anfwer me on« 
thing — Have you ever carefully obferved how carpen- 
ters and mafons go about building a houfe ? 

Geo. Oh! yes, many a time. 1 he mafon begins 
v;ith preparing the lime and mixing fand with it. Then 
he lays one Itone upon anotKer, and with his trov/el 
puts mortar between them to keep them firmly together. 
Next the carpenters, with thtir hatchets, cut out the 
rafters and place them carefully. Then, by means of a 
puily, they raife the beams to the height of the wall 
and join them. Afterwards they faw th«i boards for 

ihe 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 4i 

the floors, and make laths, which they nail to the raf- 
ters in order to place tl-.e tiles. And then — 

Mr. Bill. I lee you have taken particular notice how 
the7 go about building a houfe. But then a mafon 
tiiakes ufe of lime, and a trowel, and bricks ; or elfe 
ftones, which mu'T; firlr be cut into form : and carpen- 
ters have occaflon for hatchers, and faws, and chiliels, 
and nails, and hammeis. Where would }0u have found 
all thele, if you had been in Rohinfon*s placu^ ? 

Geo. Why— really I don'c know. 

Mr. Bill. Neither did Robin fon, and for that reafon 
he was obliged to give up the fcheme of building a real 
houfe. He had not a finglc too! in the world : no- 
thing but his tv/o hands, and wirh thtiQ alone people 
do not build fuch houfcs as we live in. 

Ed-w. Why, then, he had only to make himfelf a lit- 
tle hut v/iih the branches that he could have plucked 
from the trees. 

Mr. Bill. And could a little hut, made of branches, 
have defended him from lerpents, wol' es, tigers, pan- 
thers, lions, an^ other iierce bealls of prey ? 

Rich. Ah! poor Robinlon, how will ;ou manage in 
this dirtrefsful fituation ? 

Ediv. Could he fhoot ? 

Mr. Bill. Yes, if he had only a gun, with powder and 
ball ; but once more 1 tell you, the poor lad had no- 
thing — ablblutely nothing but his two hands to de- 
pend on. 

When he viewed bis fituation, and faw that all re- 
Iburces failed him, he fell again into his former defpon- 
dency. *' To what purpole," faid he within himfelf, 
** have I hitherto efcaped periiliing v.'icli hunger, Hnce, 
perhaps, this very night wild beafis will tear me to 
pieces ?" 

He even fancied (fuch is the force of the imagination) 
chat a furious tiger was before him, with ita dreadful 
jaws open and ready to devour him. ThinLmg that the 
tiger had him already by the throat, he criird out, ** Oh! 
my poor father and mother,*' and fell to the ground half 
dead. 

Afrer having lain there fome time in an agony of grief 
and defpair, he recullctlcd a hymn which he had heard 

his 



46 -^ 1^ H E N E \V 

his excellent mother fometimcs fing, wlien fhe had anj 
prelFure of affli6tion on iier mind. It began thus ; 

He who beneath H^aven'sguardian wing 

Hath vvilelyiixt his place. 
May to his foul tlius freely fing, 

When ibrrows come apace : 

In God's eternal Providence 

My hope redemption fees : 
Bleft with To pow'rful a defence, 

iVIy foul, be thou at eafe. 

The refle(5lions contained in thefe words flrengthencd 
him confiderabh-. Two or three times he repeated thefe 
beautiful lines to himfelf with much devotion ; after 
which he. exerted his (Irength to rife, and went upon 
another fearch, endeavouring to find fome cave that 
might ferve hi mas a fafe retreat. 

But in what part of the world was he? In South 
Americc^, or elfewhere ? Was he upon an illand or a 
continent ? This was more than he could tell as yet 
himfelf; but he faw a pretty high hill at a difcance, and 
he walked towards it, 

■7 As he went along, he made this forrowful difcovery, 
that the whole country produced nothing but grafs and 
trees which bore no fruit. It is ealy to iniagine what 
gloomy ideas a fight like this infpired him with. 

He climbed up, with feme difficulty, to the top of 
the hill, which v;as pretty high, and from which he could 
fee ail round him to the diftance of feveral leagues. To 
his great mortihcation, he perceived that he was really 
in an iHand, within fight of which there appeared no 
ether land, except two or three fmall iflandi^ that rofe 
out of the lea at the diftance of a few leagues. 

** Poor ui'.happy wretch that I am !" eried lie, lifJng 
flowly his tfeutbiing hands towards Heaven : '* I am, 
then, feparatvd, cut off from all men, and have no hopes 
of being ever delivered from this favage place. Oh I my 
poor afflicted parents, I (hall, then, never fee you more f 
I Hiall never be able to alk you forgivenefs for my folly I 
Never Ihali I hear the Iweet voice of a friend, of a mim ! 

But 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 47 

But I deferve my fate," continued he, " Oh Lord, 
thou art jult in all thy ways ! I iliould but deceive my- 
Telf were I to .complain. It is I mylelfthat have made 
my lot Co niiferable." 

In this mournful filence he continued on the fpot, 
with his eyes fixed, as it were, to the ground. *' Cut 
off from God and m:in !" was the only reflection that 
poffefled his mind. 'At length, however, thoughts more 
rational and confoling came to his relief He threw hira- 
felf upon his knees, lifted up his heart to Heaven, pro- 
mi fed to be patient and reiigned to his diflrelfes, and 
prayed for flrength to fupport them. 

Harrier. It was a good thing, however, that Robin- 
fon could fay his prayers in the time of diftrefs. 

Mr, Bill. Certainly it was happy for him. What 
would become of him, then, if he had not known that 
God is the Father of all mankind ; that he is fupremely 
good, almighty, and omniprefent ! He would have 
funk under his terror and deipair, if he had not formerly- 
been taught thefe great and comfortable truths. But 
the idea of his heavenly Father's goodnefs gave him 
conftantly frelh courage and confolation, whenever his 
diftrefles were upon the point of overpowering his refo- 
lution. 

He now found himfelf much ftrengthened^ and began 
to travel round the hill. All the fearch was, for a long 
time, ufflels : he could find no place where he might 
be in fafety. At length, he came to a little hill, 
which, in front, was as fi:eep as a wall. In examining 
this fpot attentively, he found a place that feemed to be 
hollowed in under the hill, with a pretty narrow en- 
trance to it. 

If he had had a pickixe, a crow, and other tool5, it 
would have been an ealy matter to hollow out a com- 
plete dwelling ur.der the rock, which was partly done 
by nature; but he had none of thefe tools. The quef- 
tion was, then, how he Ihould fupply the v/ant of tiiem. 

After puzzling his head a long time, he began to re- 
fled in this manner: '* Some of the trees that I iee here 
are like the willows of my country, which are eafiiy 
tranfplantcd. I v.'ill pluck up a number of chefe young 
trees, and here, before this hole, I will plant them 

cloie 



4? T II E NT E VV 

rlofe together, fo that they may form a fort of wall. 
When tliey grow up prerr- high, I (hall be able to fleep 
within this inclofure as ufely as if I was in a houfe ; 
forl)ehind, the fteep wall of this rock will fccure me, 
and in front, as well as on both fidcs, the clofe row of 
trees will keep off all danger." 

This happy thought pleafed him very much, and he 
inimcdiarely let about putting it in execution. ' His joy 
was dill greater when he faw, not far from that fpot, a 
beautiful and clear fpring bubbling out from the fide of 
the hill. He haftened to quench his thirft at it, being 
extremely dry, as he had run about a good deal during 
the hotrefl time of the day. 

Geo. Was it fo very warm, then, in the ifland ? 

Mr, Bill, Yes, you may eafily imagine that it was 
warm. Look here, (pointing to the map,) that is ihe 
coafl: of South America, near which, probably, was 
fituated the idand on which Robinion was caft away. 
Now, you fee, this part is not far from the equinuCti^iI 
lint, whe e the fun is fometimes direilly over people's 
head?. It is, therefoie, natural to fuppofe that all that 
^^uarter muil be extremely hot. 

Robinion now let about plucking up out of the 
ground, with his hands, fome of the young trees that I 
mentioned before, which he effesSled with a great deal 
of trouble, and carried them to the place that he had 
deftincd for his dwelling. Here again he w.jS obliged 
to fcrdtch a bule in the ground for each of his trees, 
and as this v/ork v^ent on but very flowly, the day 
clofed by the time that he had fixed hve or fix of them. 

After he had hnifljcd his work, hunger obliged him 
to walk down towards the fnore in order to fearch for 
oyfters ; but, unfortunately, the tide was up, lb that 
he found none, and was forced for this time to go to bed 
fupperlefs. But where was his bed ? — He determined, 
until he could tiniih for himfelf a complete and fecure 
habitiition, to lie every night in the tree in which he 
had lain the lafc night. 

But, that he mig!u not^be expofed to the fame acci- 
dent as had then difiurbed him, he took his garters, 
tied them round his body, and faftened himleif tightl)' 

t* 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 49 

to the branches on which he lay; and then, recommend- 
ing hinifelf to his Creator, he fel! afleep. 

Rich. Thzt was uiiely done of Jiim to tie himfelf fo. 

Mr. Bill. Why, necelFity is the mother of invention. 
She teaches us many things which v/e ftiould not know 
but for her. It is to this intent that our Creator hath 
formed us, and this earth that we inhabit, in fuch a 
nianher, that we have diiFerent want% which we cannot 
fatisfy unlefs by the manifold etiorts of invention, if 
ever we are maders of good fenfe and an active under- 
{landing, it is to thefe wants that we are indebted for 
then*! : for if larks fell down out of the air into our 
mouths ready roafted j if houfes, beds, deaths, viQuals, 
and every tiling elie necelTary for the prefervation and 
comfort of our lives, grew up of their own accord out- 
of the ground or on the tops of trees, quite ready and 
-prepared to our hand, certainly we fliould do nothing elfe 
but eat, drmk, and ileep, and be as llupid as brutes as 
long as we lived. 



FOURTH EVENING. 

\f^' ^^^l' Well, my desrs, v;here did we leave Ro- 
binfon Crufoe luit night ? 

Rich, We left him like a bird perched in a tree to take 
his night's reft. 
' Mr. Bill. Very well. To proceed, then, with his 
ftory : Every thing v/ent on that night as well as poili- 
ble ; he had no fail, and flept loundly till morning. 

At break of day, the Hr ft tiling that he did was to feC 
otr towards the Ihore to look foroyfcers, intending after- 
wards to return to his work. He happened this time to 
go another way, and, as he walked along, v/as overjoyed 
to find a tree which bore large fruit. It is true, iiu did 
not as 5'et know wMiat they might he; but he. hoped to 
iind t.hem good for eating, and therefore, to m^keatTialii 
ii^ knocked down one. *" "'•'' 

C Tt 



Sc* T H E N E W 

It was a large ir.it, fometliing of a triangular form, 
and as big as a young child's head. The outward rind 
was compofed of filaments, or llringy folds, as if made 
of hemp. The fecond huik or fljell w.isy on the con- 
trary, almoft as hard as the fljell of a^torioife, and Ko- 
hinfon foon perceived tiiut it would fer^e Jiim far a cip. 
This fl.ell is fo large that it lometiraes aiTords a place of 
retirement to the litt'e long-tailed American monkey. 
The fruit within was a fort of juicy kernel, which tai'^ed 
like a fweet almond, and in the middle of this kernel, 
which was hollow, he found a moft delicious and finely 
flavoured milk. This was a mofl: agreeable treat for 
poor Robinfon, who was half ftarved. 

Hio empty fiomach was not fatisned with one nut, 
he knocked down a fecond, which he ate with equal 
greedinefs. His joy at having difcovered this excellent 
fruit brought tears into his eyes, and he looked up to 
Heaven with fenfations of the warmeft gratitude. 

The tree was tolerably large, and quite hang with 
fruit ; but alas ! it was the only one in the whole ifiand. 

Geo. What fort of a tree might it be, then ? We have 
none fuch here. 

Mr. Bill. It was a cocoa-nut tree. They grow chiefiy 
there, in the Eaft Indies ; and here, in the South Sea 
iflands. There are fome of them found in the Weil In- 
dies ; indeed^ they are pretty common there. 

Though Robinfon's hunger v/as now fatisfied, yet he 
did not omit going down to the iLore, to fee what (hew 
the oyflers made that day. He found a few, indeed, 
but far too kw to afford him a hearty meal. He had, 
tiierefore, great reafon to thank God for having this day 
furnilhed him with another fort of food ; and he did io 
with a heart full of gratitude, 

He carried home for his dinner the oyflers that he 
had found, and went chearfuUy about his yefterduy's'v 
work again. 

He had picked up on the beach a large fliell, which 
ferved him inllead of a fpade, and advanced his work 
confidefably. A little after he diicovered a plant, the 
ilalk of which was full of threads, like fiax or hem n. 
At another time he would not have paid any atten 
to fuch matters, but, at prefent, nothing was indiS'i 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 51 

to him. He examined every thing, and reflected on 
every thing, in order, if poiiible, to apply every thing 
to advantage. 

Having Ibme hopes that this plant might be ufed in 
fhe fame manner as flix or hemp, he plucked a quantity 
of it, tied it up in fmall bundles, and left them to foak 
in water. Having obferved, at the end of a few days, 
that the thick outfide ficin was fufnciently foftened by 
the u'ater, he drew out the bundles, and fpread them 
thinly on the grafs before the fun, the ftalks being now 
quite foft. As foon as ever they were properly dried, 
lie made a trial with a large Pdck to pound them and 
bre.ik them like flax, and he fucceeded. 

Immediately he endea\oured to turn tlie ftringy pirt 
of ihe!e plants to ufe by miking fmall cords of it. It is 
true they were not fo well twifted as thofe made by our 
rope-makers here, for he had neither a wheel nor a fecond 
perfon to aJiill him. Hov/ever, they were ftrongtnough 
to fiRen his great fliell to the end of a flick, by which 
means he was now mafter of an inftrument not much un- 
like a gardener's fpade. 

He then went on with his work very diligently, and 
planted tree clofe by tree until he had completely pa!i- 
fdded the fpace that was before his intended dwelling.. 
But, as one fingle row of a tiee fo very pliable did noi- 
feem a fufficient wall of defence, he fparcd no labour, 
but planted a fecond row round thw firli. He then in- 
terwove the branches of the two rov/s togetlier, and, ac 
laft, hit upon the idea of filling up with earth zhQ dif- 
tance that was between them. This completed his v/all, 
fo folid that it would have required a conliderablc force 
Co pulh it in. 

Every morning and evening he v/atered his little plan- 
tation with water from the neighbouring fpring, which 
he took up in his cocoa fliell ; and he had very foon the 
latiifa^lion of feeing his young treesfprout up and flourilh 
lb as to aftbrd a charming view to the eye. 

V/hen he had ahnoil entirely fmiilied his hedge, he 
fpent a whole day in making a number ot thick cords, 
oat of which he formed, as well as he could, a ladder of 
ropeT. 

C 2 HeKry, 



52 T HE N E W 

Henry, What wnn fhat for ? 

i\h:. HVl. VW tell you. His dcfign wis \.o make no 
door to his habitation, but to plant more treea, and lo 
llop up even the opening that remained- 

Henry. How, then, was he to go in and out ? 

PAr. Bill. By the aHi.lance of his ladder of ropes. 

It is to be obferved, ijjat the rock which hung over 
Ills habitation was about as high as the fecond (lory of a 
houie, and on the top of the rock was a tree. To this 
lit failened his ladder of ropes, and let iL,hang down to 
the ground. He then tried to climb up by it, and fuc- 
teeded to admiration. 

All this being fiiiiilied, he ccnfidered by what rreans 
he might make the little hoilow under the r(5ck large 
enough to fervehim for a habitation. He faw very well, 
that with his hands-alone he lliould never be aMe to ma- 
nage it. Vv hat was to be done, then ? He m.uti; tind out 
feme tool or inftruiiient for the purpofe. 

With this deiign he repaired to a Ipot Vv'here he h^d 
ittn a great number of hard green ftones fcattered on the 
ground. Having fearched amongft them carefully, he 
ac lail: found one, the very fight of which made him 
jump for joy ; for, in efFetl, this ftone had the very form 
c*f a hatchet, and even a hole to fit the handle in. Ro- 
binfonfaw, at hrft view, that it would make an excel- 
lent hatchet, if he could but enlarge the hole ever fo 
little. After a world of pains he at lengtlv happily ac- 
complifhed this by means of another {xqt,^ ; then fixed 
a pretty thick (lick \v, it, by way of handle, and with 
fome of the cord which he had made hiaifelf, he faficned 
it as firm, as if it had been nailed in. 

He nou- tried to fell a fmall tree, and the attempt 
proving no Icfs fuccefsful, filled him \yith inexpreilible 
joy. Had any one ofTertd him one hundred pounds for 
his hatchet, he v,7ould not have parted with it, fuch vail 
advantages did he promife himlelf from the ufe of it. 

Searching ftill among thofe gre.en fiones, he found two 
more equally fit for ufe. The one had nearly the forr. 
of a malle:, fuch as is ufed by carpenters and fton 
cutters; the other was ftiaped like a fioux- fhort blue; 
gcon, having an edge or corner at the ^\-\<^., Rorin^V'

carried them both to his habication, intending to _,. .^ 
<work with them iaimediatelv. 

He fucce.dtd to his wifh. La}ing (be edge of the 
one uone upon the earth and rock, and Priking it with 
the other reiembling a mallet, he knocked off feveral 
pieces of the rock, and, in a few days, was fo far ad- 
tariced in clearing out the hollow, that k fecr.ied 
la"ge enough for him to lie in at his eafe. 

He had before this plucked up with his hands a quan- 
tity of grafs, which he had fpread before the fwn tomake 
bay of it. This being now fufficiently dried, he car- 
ried it to his cave to make himfelf a gcod b.d. 

From this time he was able to fleep like a human crea- 
ture, without being obliged, as he had for ir;any nights 
before, to perch like a bird up in a tree. Vvhac a 
luxury h- was to him to ftretch his weary limbs upon 
a foft bed of hay ! He thanked God, and faid withiit 
himfelf, *' Oh! if my countrymen knew what it is to 
pafs, as I have done, feveral nights fuccefiivelyjfeated 
upon a hard branch of a tree, how happy would they 
count ihemfclves to be abl^ to enjoy the refrefiinient of 
fleep in convenient beds, fecure from accidents by. fall- 
ing or otherwife ! Certainly they would not let flip a 
day v>7ithout fincerely than: ing Providence for all the 
conveniencies and delights which they enjoy. 

The following day was Sunday, Robinfcn dedi- 
cated it to reft, to prayer, and meditation. He fpent 
whole hours on his knees, with jiis eyes turned towards 
heaven, praying to God to pardon his fins, and to blefs. 
and comfort his poor parents. Then, with tears of joy, 
he thanked his Maker for the providential afliftanc^ that 
he had experienced in a fituation in which he was cur 
off from the whole world ; he promifed to grow bettet 
every day, and -to petfevere in his filial obedience. 

Hiirrie!. Well, I think mailer Robinfon is grown 
much better than he was. 

Mr, Bill. Providence forefaw that, he would grow 
better under afliiction, and, therefore, fuffered him to 
undergo the triil of it : for thus our heavenly Father 
a^s towards us aih 1: is not in 'his anger, but in his 
tender mercy, that he fends us misfortunes : he knows 
that they art neccir.:rv to us, in order to r;i"der us hum-

bier and better. Far from being hurtful to ii", thty 
become faiutnry remedies in his beneficent hands. 

That he miglit not forget the order of days, hiit know 
regularly on uhat day Sunday would fall, Robinfoii 
thought of making himfciran almanack. 

.VrV/f. An almanack ? 

Air. Bill, Yes ; not a printed one, it *s true, nor 
quite \o exai.^ as thofe that we have in Europe, but 
iliil an almanack by which he was able to count the 
days regularly. 

P.ich. And how did he manage that ? 

Mr. Bill. Having neither paper nor any thing elfc 
reqnintc for writing, he thojc four trees that were clofe 
befide each other, and prttty fniooth on rhe bark. On 
the largefl of the four he marked every evening a notch, 
to fignify that a day was pafl". When he had made feven 
:)0tches, the week was expired. Then he cut in the 
next tree another notch, to exprefs a week. As often 
as he had completed in the fecond tree four notches, he 
m-irked on the third, with a notch of the fume fort, the 
revolution of a whole month ; and, lallly, when thefe 
rr-arksthat flood for months amounted to twelve in num- 
ber, he made a fccie on the fourth tree, to denote that 
the whole year was expired. 

Henry. But all the nion.ths are not equally long : 
fome have thirty-one days, others but thirty : how then 
eould he mark exaQly the number of days in each ? 

Mr. Bill. That he could reckon on his fingers. 

Rich. On his lingers ? 

Mr. Bill. Yes ; and, if you chufe, I will (hew you 
how too. 

All the children. Oh ! dear papa, do. 

Mr. Bill. Well, then, obferve. He (hut his left hand 
fo ; then, with the fore finger of his right hand, he 
touched one of the knuckles or finger joints of the left, 
and then the hollow that is befide it, and fo on, naming 
the months in their order. Every month that fails upon 
a knuckle has thirty-one days, whereas the others which 
fall upon the hollows between the joints have only 
thirty ; excepting the month of February alone, which 
has notfo much as thirty, but twenty-eight, and O" 
every four years twenty-nine. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. <^ 

T-fc began, therefore, with the knuckle of tlie fore 
Tinger and touching that, he named the firft month of the 
year, January. How many days then has January ? 

Rich. Thirty-one. 

Mr. BilL I will go on, then, reckoning the months 
upon the knuckles of my fingers, and do you, Richard, 
as I name each, ttil me the nuniber of days chat it con- 
tains. In the i<?cond place, therefore, February ? 

Rich. Siiould have thirty days, but ;t has only iv/enty* 
eight, and fometimes twentv-ninc. 

Mr. Bill. March ? 

Rich, Thirtv-one. 

Mr. BilL April ? 

Rich. Thirty. 

Mr. BilL May? 

Rich, Thirty-one. . 

Mr. BilL June? 

Rich. Thirty. 

Mr. BilL July ? 

Rich, Thirty one. 

Mr. Bill. A'jguft (pointing to the knuckle of ch-j 
thumb) ? 

Rich, Thirty-one. 

Mr. BilL September ? 

Rich. Thiity. 

Mr, BilL October ? 

Rich. Thirty-one. 

Mr. Bill. November ? 

Rich, Thirty. 

Mr. Bill, December ? 

Rich. Thirty-one days. 

Mr. BilL Well, Henry, you have reckoned along 
with us in your pocket almanack, have we made it cue 
right? 

Henry. Yes, papa, you have not miffed a tittle. 

Mr. Bill. Such little matters as ihefe are worth re- 
membering, becaui'e you have not always an almanack 
at hand, and yet there is occafion for you fometimes to 
know how many days there are in this or that month. 

Rich, Oh, ril warrant I fiiall not forget. 

Henry, Nor I, for I have taken particular notice. 

C 4 Mr. 



T ri E N E W 

Mr. Bill. It was thus, then, that our friend Rohrnfon 
took care not to lofe the order of time, but to know- 
on what days the Sabbath fell, that he might keep ic 
holy, after the manner of Chrillians. 

In the mean time, he ha-J ufed the greatsfc part of the 

ocoanuts ihat he had itored up,.having diicovered but 

ne tree of t'le kind as yet, and the fliore furniflied him 

with lb few ojfiers, that they were not fuiHcient to 

keep him aiivc. He began, therefore, to bf uneafy 

r.^ain concerning- the article of food. 

Hitherto fearful and . autious, he had not dj»red to go 

':y great diilance from hrs dwelling. The dread of 

nils, or of men not much more civilized, if any were to 

. found io the country, kept him at home ; but necefTity 

- : length obliged him to conquer his reludance, and to 

V aik a little further into the ifland, in order, if poifible, 

J d^fcover a new flock of provif ons.. With this intent 

;.e refolved, the following day, with God's blefling and 

j^roteftion, to traverfe the whole ifiand. 

Bui, in order to defend himfelf from the excefTivc heat 
of the fun, he fpenc ihe whole evening making an um- 
brella. 

Ea'iv. Where did he find filk and whale-bone ? 
Mr, Bill. He had neither filk nor whale-bone; nor 
■i-id he either knife, fciifurs, netdle, or thread ; and yet 

' but how do you think he fet about making an am- 

brella ? 

luhv. Th-.t I cannot tell. 

Mr. Bill. Fie Vv'ove the top of it with fprigs of vvillow, 
ike a large round bafket, not very deep: in the middle 
of this he fixed a ftick, which he tied v>?ith his pack- 
thread, and then heAveflt to the cocoa-nut tree for fome 
arge leaves, which he faftened with pins to the out- 
.:de. 

kid. With pins ? Where had he thofe pins ?.- 
Mr. Bill.- Guefs. 

Harriet. Oh, 1 can tell. He found them among the 
fwceping^, or between the chinks cf the floor. 1 find 
a 7ocd many tliere. 

Rich. A v*ife difcovcry I As if one cculd find pine 
^here there v.as nobod.y to lofe them! Befide?, wh:

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 57 

fvveepiiigs could there be, or v/Iiat floor in Robinfon's 
little cave ? 

Mr. Bill, Well, wlio can guefs ? How would you 
do if you wanted to faden any thing and had no pins? 

Rick, I wouid ufc thorns, fuch as^row on the haw- 
thora tree. 

Ge.. And I would ufc thofe flrong prickles that we fee 
on goofeberry bullitfs. 

Mr. Ei'.l. Pretty well both j however, I muil tell 
}oU, that Robinibn uied neither the one nor the other, 
by reafcn that he never faw either hawthorn or goole- 
berry tree in all his ifland. 

Rich, What then did he ufe ? 

Mr. Bill. Fi(h bone?. The fea threw dead fiihes up 
on the beach, t^rom time to time, and when their bodies 
rotted away or were devoured by birds' of prey-', their 
bones remained dry. Of thefe RobinTon had gathered 
Ibnie of the firongefl and (harped: to ufe as pins, 

JBy means of them he contrived to make up an um- 
brella {q clofe that not a Tingle ray of the fun could pe- 
netrate it. Whenever any new ptece of wnrkfjcceeded 
with him, his joy was inexpreifible ; then he u fed to 
fay to himlelf, ** Have not I been a great fool to pals 
the beil part of my youth in idlen^fs ? Oh ! if I were 
in Europe now, and had ail thofe tools at my coauriand 
that are fo eafily to be procured there, v.hat tilings I 
could make f^/r myfelf ! And what a pleafure it would 
be to me to mike up myfelf the greatell part of my fur- 
niture, and the working tooh that 1 fuould have occa- 
fion for ! 

As it was not very late, he bethought hin>felf of try- 
ing to make a bag tha: might hold his provifion, if he 
fhould be fo lucky a^^ to find any in his excurfion. He 
turned this fcheme in his thoughts for a Vv-hile, and at 
length fucceeded in finding means to accoraplifh it. 

You mull know, he had made a tolerable good flock 
of packthread j of this he refolved to weave a piece of 
retwork, and of the network to make a bag. 

Now it was thus he fet about it. He fallened acrofs, , 

between two trees that were little more than a yard af^n- 

der, feveral threads, one under the other, and as clofe 

as'pofiible. This refembled exadly what v/eavers call 

C 5 the 



58 THE N E W 

the ivarp. In the next place, he joined regularly, 
from top to bottom, tiiread with thread, flill as ciofe as 
poUible, knotting the thread that wert down with each 
tiiread that went acrofs, cxaiSlly in the lame manner a3 
when one weaves a net. Thele threads, therefore, that 
went downwards formed what is called the iiccj \ and 
by this Ibrt of workmanfhip he in a fhort time completed 
a piece of netting not unlike fuch as fiflicrmen ufe. 
He next (lipped off the ends of the threads rom the 
trees to which they v/ere faftene'', and joined the fides 
of the netting together, clofing up the bottom ; thus he 
left no part open but the top. Here was a bag or pouch 
complete, which he hung by his f de, having faftered 
both ends of a ftout piece of packthread to the mouth, 
and flipping the loop over his neck. 

The happy fuccei's of his labour filled him with fo 
much joy that he was fcarce able to clofe his eyes all 
night. 

Geo, I (hould like to have fuch a bag as that. 
Ediv. So Itould 1 too, if we had only fome pack- 
thread. 

Mrs. Bill. If you wifhed to enjoy as much fatisfac- 
tion from your work as Robinlbn did from his, you 
fbould begin with making the packthread yourfelves, 
and you yourfelves (liould prepare the hemp or the flax, 
for that purpofe ; but as there is neither flax nor hemp 
ripe at this time of the year, I will turnifli you with 
packthread. 

Gee, Oh ! dear mama, will you be fo good ? 
Mrs. Bill, Yes, my dear, if you defire it. 
Geo, That is delightful. 

Harriet. You are doing what is very right ; for if ever 
you Ihould happen to be in an iflajid where there was not 
a living foul but yourfelf, you know beforehand how to 
let about fuch things; eh, papa? 

Mr. Bill. Right. Well, make a trial. As to Robin- 
Ion, we will let him fleep till to-morrow. In the mean- 
lime, we (hall fee if it Js -not poflible to be as cunning as 
he^ and to make an umbrella.

FIFTH EVENING. 



TH E next evening, the company being aneni!)Ied 
in the ufual place, Edward came ftrutting in with 
a pouch of network that he made himfelf, and which 
drew the eyes of the whole company upon him. Inftead 
of an umbrella, he had borrowed a fieve from the cook, 
and ftuck a broomftick f-hrough it. This he held over 
his head as he came in, and marched up to the table 
with a great deal of importance and folemnity. 

Mrs. Bill. Bravo, Edward ! why this is excellent \ 
I had almofi: taken you for Robinfon Crufoe himfelf. 

Rich. Ah ! if I had but had a few minutes more 
time to fiuilh my bag, I could have come in the fame 
manner. 

Geo. So could I too. 

Mrs, Bill. Well, Edward has fhewn that other peo» 
pie can make pouches of network a3 v/ell as Robi n(bn 
Cruloe. But, my man, your umbrella is not worth a, 
farthing. 

Edvj. Oh, papa, I only make fhift with this for the 
prefent, becaufe I was not able to hnifh another in the 
time. 

Mr. Billing/ley (opening a clojet doory and fetching cut 
en umbrella ivkich he had made himfelf J, What lay 
you to this, Mr. Robinfon Crufoe ? 
Ed'vj, Ah ! that is a fine one. 

Mr. Bill. I keep it until we come to the end of the 
ftory. Then he who (hall have befl: performed the fe- 
veral pieces of work mentioned in it, fiiall be our Ro- 
binfon Crufoe, and I will make him a prefent of the um- 
brella. 

Geo. And muft he really make a cave too, or a hut ? 
Mr, Bill. Why not ? 
. All the children. Oh, that is excellent, that is de- 
lightful. 

Mr. Billt Robinfon could fcarce wait for the day- 
light. He rofe before the fun, and prepared for \{\'^ 
journey. He flipped his pouch firing over his neck, put 
a ftron^ cord round his wuilt by V7ay of girdle, in which 

he 



T H E N E VV 

li.: Aiick his lutchet inftead of fword, tcolc his iim- 
brclla upon his flioulder, and lb courageoufly began hia 
march. 

He ftril: paid a viiit to his cocoa-nut tree, to furrifh 
his bag with a nut or two. Provided with ibme of this 
excellent food, he went ftraight down to the fea-fide to 
feek alfo fonie oylters ; and, having got a I'niall (lore of 
thefe two articles, in cafe of necellicy, he took a Hight 
br^akfafl, with a drink of freih water from his fpriiig, 
and marched off. 

The morningwas delightful ; the fun was juft then 
riling in ail his ?,lory, and leemed as if he afcended out 
cf the Tea. A choufand- birds, of different forts, and the 
greatefl: variety of admirable plumage, were then fing- 
ing their morning iong, and rejoicing at the return of 
iiglit. The air was as pure and asfrefti as if it had beea 
but then c eated, and the plants and flowers exhaled the 
moir exqviiiite perfume. 

Robinfon kit his heart expand with joy and gratitude. 
*' Even here," faid he, *' even here doth the Creator 
cf the Univerfe (hew hijnfelf the raoit^ beneficent of be- 
ings ! — He then mixed his voice with the melody of the 
birds, and fung a m.orning hymn, which he had formerly 
iearnt, and fl ill retained in memory. 

As his fear of wild animals, wl;ether men or beafiSj^. 
was not yet entirely diffipated, he avoided, in his walk, 
£s much as poflible", all foretl sand thickets, cbufmg, or. 
the contrary, fuch grounds as allowed him an open prof- 
fe,d on every fide ; but unfortunately thefe grounds 
^verethe barrtneil: parts of the Vv'hole idand, fo that he 
h'dd rTone a pretty long way without finding any thing 
that could repay him for his trouble^ or be the leal: fer- 
viceable to him. 

Atldft^he obferved a parcel of plant', v hich he re- 
Iblved to infpe(5ta little clofer : they were growing to- 
gether in tufts, and foriued a kind of little coppice. 
Some had reddilh blollcms, others white; a third fort, 
inftead of bloifom^, were covered Vvith little green ap- 
ples, about the fize of a cherry. 

He eagerly \ it one of thefe apples, but found it l 
for eating, which fo vexed him, that he plucked up 
whole tuft, (ind was going to fling ic away, with all 

fori 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 6i 

ce, wbcn he perceived, to Ms great uirprire, a n lim- 
ber of round knobs hanging from t-he roois of the tuft. 
He immed^'atei} fufpefted that thefe were properly the 
fruit of the piant, and, therefore, bcL^an to examine 
tlem. ^ , ^ 

lilt, however, this time his tafie difappointed him ; 
tl.e fruit was hard and difagreeable to the palate. Ro- 
binfon had a mind to throw the whole away ; but for- 
tunately he recollefled that a thing fliould not be rec- 
iioned abfolutely ufelefs, becaufe we cannot all at once 
dilcover the utility of ir. fie, therefore, put a few of 
theie knobbedfruit into iiis pouch,, and continued his 
,.:i!k. 
I^:c/p. I know what thefe knobbed fruit were. 
Mr^ Bill. Come, what do you think they v/ere ? 
Rich. Why, they were potatoes ; they grow exadly 
as \ou have defcribed thefe knobs. t 

Henry. And America is their original foil too. 
Geo. Aye. it was from that country that Sir Francis 
Drake brought them. But Robinfon was very ftupid 
net to know potatoes. 

ivJr. Bill. Would you know them? 
Geo. Law I I have feen potatot-s, and eat of them a 
hundred times. I am very fond of them. 

Mr. Bill. But Robinfon had, perhaps, never feen anyr 
of them ; at leaft, as they grow in the ground. 
Geo. No ? 

Mr. Bill. No: confide;, thai was forty or fifty years 
ago, wher^ they were by no means fo comnion in fome 
parts of England as they are at prefent., 
GVj. Oh! then 1 beg his pardon. 
Mi\ Bill, You fee, -my dear George, how wrong it is- 
to be top hafty in bltming other-\ We Ihould always 
put ourlelves in their place, and fjrft afk the queftion if 
v/e could have done better than they. If you yourfelf 
had n"e\ er ften potatoes, nor heard in what iranner they 
fiiould be drefr, you would ha\e been as mu.ch puzzled 
as Robinfjn to find cut tUe ufe of ihem. IJet il;is teach 
you never to think youri'elf cleverer than ether people. 
Gf. }t fliail, papa. ' 

Mr. Bill. Robinfon continued his v;alk, but very 
fiOv/ly, and with a great deal of caution. The kait

noife, made by tlie wind in fliaklng tlie trees and the 
thickets, ftartled him, and made him put his hand to his 
hatchet to defend himfelf in cafe of need. But he al- 
ways law, to his great joy, that his fright was without 
foundation. 

At length he arrived on the banks of a rivulet, where 
he refolved to make his dinner. Hefeated himfelfat the 
foot of a large branchy tree, and was juil' going to re- 
gale himfelf heartily, when, all at once, a noife, at adil- 
tance, threw him ag^in into a terrible fright. 

He looked round, with terror in his countenance, and, 
at length, perceived a whole troop of • 

Edzi'. oil la ! favages, I fuppole. 

Geo. Orelfe lions and tigers. 

Mr. BHi. Neither one nor the other; but a troop of 
wild animals which hive fome refemblance to ourfheep, 
except that on their back they bear a fmall bunch like 
that of a camel. As to their (ize, they were very little 
larger than a (heep. If you v/ould wilh to know what 
thefeanimals were, and how they were called, 1 wilhell 
you. 

Rich, Oh! yes, papa,if you pleafe. 

Mr. BilL They are called lamas; their country is 
properly that part of America which belongs to the Spa- 
niards, and is caUed Peru. There, before the difcovery 
of that extenfive country by Francis Pizarro and Alroa- 
gro, the Peruvians had tamed this animal, and were ac- 
cuftomed to load it, and ufe it for a beaft of burden, 
as we do horfts and mules. Of its wool they made fluffs 
for cloathing. 

Rich. Then the people of Peru were not fo favage as 
the other Americans. 

Mr. Bill. Not by a great deal. They lived in houfes 
properly built ; as did alfo the Mexicans (here in North 
America); they had built magnificent temples, and 
were governed by kings. 

Geo. Is it not from this country that the Spaniards 
drav/ all that gold and f-her for which they go every 
y\earto America, in their galleons, as you have told us ? 

Mr. BilL The fame.— Robinibn, feeing thefe lamas 
approach, feh a violent defire to eat fome roaft meat, 
which he had nouuiled for a long time. He thought, 

there* 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 65 

therefore, of killing one of thefe lamas ; and for that 
purpofe he ftood dole befide che tree, with his hatchet 
of flint in his hand, waiting until the beaft fliould, per- 
haps, pafs lb cl-jfe to him, that he might ftrike it with 
his hatchet. 

It h.^ppened as he expeded. Thefe animals, walking 
on without fufpicion, and probably having never been 
difturbed by any living creature, palfed by, f^ee from 
the lead dread of danger, clofe to the tree where Ro* 
binfon ftood in ambufcade ; and one of the fmall'eft of 
them coming within his reach, he gave it fo effectual a 
ftroke on the nape of the neck, that he laid it dead in a 
moment. 

Harriet. Oh ^)- ! how Could he do fo ? The poor lit- 
tle fheep ! 

Mts. Bill, And why (hould he not, Harriet? 
Harritt. Nay, the poor little thing had done him no 
harm, however; and fo he might very well have let it 
live. 

Mrs, Bill, Certainly, he might fo ; but he had occa- 
fion for the flefii of this animal for his food and nourifti- 
ment ; and doft thou not knov/ that God hath permitted 
us to make ufe of animals whenever v/e have the like 
occallon ? 

Mr, Bill. To kill any living creat-iire without necef- 
fity, or to torture it, even barely to teaze it, is cruelty, 
and no good perfon will do fo ; but to draw all the ad- 
vantage poflible from ihem, and even to kill them and 
ufe their fieih for our nourilhmenr, is not forbidden. 
Befides, do not ycu know, as I explained to you the 
other day, that it is ^ ery weil for animals thut we ILould 
deal thus with them ? 

Rich. Ah .' very true ; if we had no occafion for ani- 
mals, we (hou'd not take care of them, and in chat cafe 
they would not be near fb weil off as at prcfenr. How ma- 
ny of them would be ftarved to death in a hard winter ! 
Henry, Ycs ; and they would I'ulter ftill more if they 
were not killed, but XtU to die of ficknefs and old-age, 
becaufe they cannot aifift each other as men do. 

Mr, Bill. Again, we nriuft not fuppofe that the death 
to which we put animals caufes them a great deal of 
pain. They aie net icnfibl!: beforehand that they are 

going 



64 THE N E W 

r-'Aug to be killed, fo that tliey are quiet and contented 
to the very lall moment ; and the feeling of px.n, while 
they are killing, is foon paft. 

PvobinCon never thought of allying himfelf jjow he was 
to drefs the (klli of this young lama, until the moment 
that he had killed it. 

Ihiftiet. Dear nie ! could not he Hoil or roaft it ? 
Mr. Hill. Thatsi^ what he would have done v-'ith all 
his heart, but, unfortunately, he hud not a fingle article 
for the purpofe ; he had neither pot nor fpit, and, what 
is worfe, he had not even f.re. 

Harriet. No fire ? Why, then, ail he had to do 
was to light one. 

Mr. Bill. True, if he had a flint and fieel, tinder 
and matches ; but he had none of them. 
Ric/:>. I know what 1 would haye doiic. 
Mr. h-tli. What, pray ? 

A'iV/f. I would have rubbed two bits of dry wood 
one againft the other, until they took fire. I recolledl, 
that is the method ufed by fome lavage people. VIq

Mr. Bill. Robinfcn had exadly the fame idea. He 
took up the lama, therefore, upon his iboulders, and 
turned his ll:eps homewards. 

On the way, he made another difcovery, which af- 
forded him infinite joy. This was a number o'f lemon- 
trees, feven or eight, rour.d which, on the ground, he 
found feveral ripe ones that had fallen. He gathered 
them up carefully, marked the fpot where theie trees 
grew, and, quite happy and content with his acquifition, 
haftened home to his habitation. 

There his firll: bufmefs was to fkin the young lama. 
He effected this by means of a fnarp flint, which ferved 
him for a knife. He ftretched the fkin in the fun as well- 
as he could, in order to dry it, becaufe he forefavv that 
it might be of fervige to him. 

Ricb. Why, what could he make of that ? 
Mr. Bill. Oh ! a great many things. In the firft 
place, his fnoes and ftockings began already to be full 
o^ holes. He thought that, when his (hoes were quite 
gene, he might make fcles of this fkin, and faften th "" 
under his feet, fo as not to be gbliged Co walk quite b;

foot. Beddes, the thouglits of winter troubled him not 
a little, and he was glad thac he had found a way to fur- 
nifh himfelf with fur agatnfl: the feverity of the cold. 

It is true, he might have Ipured himfelf this uneafi- 
ncfs ; for, in the country where he now was, there was 
never any v/rnter. 

G^;. Never any winter ? 

Mf. Bill. The cold of winter is feldom felt in any of 
thofe hot climates between the tv/o tropics. I was 
fpeaking to you about them lately ; have you forgot 
how they are called ? 

Wwy. The Torrid Zone. 

Mr, Bill. Right — However, to make amends for this 
want of winter, they have, during two or three months 
of the year, inceifant rains- As to Robinfon, he knew 
nothing of all that, becaufe, in his youth, he would 
not fuffer .himfelf to be properly inftru6led. Hiftory, 
geography, and every other improving fcience, were 
tireibme and hateful to him. 

Rich. But, papa, I think, for all that, that we have 
read once how very Iiigii mountains, like the Peak of 
TeneriiTj are always covered with fnow ; and how, on 
that ridge of mountains which bounds Chili on the Eaft, 
and extends from Peru to the Straits of Magellan, fnow 
is to be feen the whole year. It mufl: certainly be al- 
waysr winter there j and yet thcfe places are between the 
tropics. 

Mr. Bill. You are righr,my dear, Richard. Situations 
very high and mountainous are an exception ; for upon 
rhe tops of cbefe high mountains there is commonly a 
perpetual fnow. Do you remember too what I told you 
of lome countries in the i'all Indies, when we lately 
went over them on the map ? 

Rich. Yes ; that, in feme countries there, fummer 
and wir.ter are but two or' three leagues afunder. la 
the Ifland of -Ceylon, which belongs to the Dutch ; ?.nd 
there alio — where — where 'was it r 

Mr. Bill. In the peninfula on this (■\d<i of the Ganges:

fMCcareairo in thelflanc] of Ceram, one ofthe Moluccas, 
u!iere a man needs only to travel three leagues to get out 
of vvlnttr inio funimer, or out of fumnier into winter. 

But hers lia\ e we tniveiled very far from our friend 
Robi;ifon. OMcrve how, at one fpring, our thoughts 
can tranfport ihemfclves in the twinkling of an eye to 
places dilhnt from us hy many thoufands of leagues. 
Frcm America wc? have taken a fli^>ht to Alia, and now 
— take care — hey pafs ! we are back again in America, 
at Robinicn Cruibe's iiland. Is not this wonderful! 

After he had Ikinned the lama, taken out its bowels, 
and cur off a hind quarter to roafl, his firfl: care was to 
provide a fp't. For this he cut down a young (lender 
willow- tree, peeled off the rind, and made it Hiarp at 
one end ; alter which he ch'bfe a couple of forked 
branches to hold up the fpit. Having cut them of an 
equal length, and (harp at the ends, he ftuck them into 
the ground, oppofi.te to each other ; put the joint on the 
fpit, which he then laid on the t\vo forked llicks ; and 
great indeed was his joy when he faw how w^ell his ipit 
went round. 

He wanted nothing now but, what is mofl necefTarjr 
of all, fire. In order to produce it by rubbing, he cut 
two pieces of wood from a dry trunk, and immediately 
fell to work. He rubbed fo brifkly, that the fweat ran 
down his face in great drops ; but he could not accom- 
plirti his purpofe : for v/hen the wood was heated until 
it fmoked, jud: then he found himfelf fo fatigued, that 
he was under an abfoUite neccility to ftop a few mo- 
ments and recover ftrength ; in the mean time, the wood 
cooled a little, and his v>^hole labour became ufelefs. 

Here again he had a lively inftance of the helpleflnefs 
tf njan in a ftate of folitude, and what mighty advan- 
tages the fociety of other men affords us. 

He wanted but another man to go on rubbing whea 
he was tired, and then he certainly would have fet the 
piece of wood on fire i but thofe interruptions, which 
he could not avoid, rendered the thing impoHible. 

Rich. And yel I always thought that the lavages pro- 
duced fire by rubbing. 

Mr. Bill. So they do. But then thefe favages are 
generally much ftronger than we Europeans, who are

brought up a great deal too delicatelv. In the next 
place, they know better how to fet about it. They take 
two pieces of diiferent wood, one foft, the other hard, 
and they rub the latter with a great deal ot rapidity 
againft the former, 'JS'hich, at length, takes fire. Or eife, 
again, they m?.ke a hole in one of the bits of wood, into 
which they put the end of the other, and then turn it 
between their hand?, with fo quick and inceffant a mo- 
tion, that at length it begins to bum. 

Of all this Robinlbn knew not one tittle, and there- 
fore did net fucceed. 

At laft he threw away the pieces of wood, fat dowa 
upon his bed of hay in a melancholy mood, fupporting 
his head upon his hand, and, fighing heavily, caflaloolc 
now and then upon the fine joint of meat which was 
likely now to remain on the fpit without roafting. Then 
fuddenly reflefling what would become of him in win- 
ter if he had no fire, he felt fuch piercing anxiety at 
the thought, that he was obliged to rife precipitately 
and walk about, in order to breathe more at h s eaie. 

As his fpirits were a good deal agitated, he grew 
thirfty, and went to the fpring with a cocoa-nut (hell to 
fetch fome water. With this he mixed the juice- of a 
lemon, v»^hich made a inofc excellent drink, and alTorded 
him unfpeakable rtfrelhment in a moment when he flood 
extremely in need of ir. 

In the mean time, the fight of his me.U upon the fpit 
made his mouth v;ater; he ardently longed for a little 
nice of it. He recollecbd at length to have heard that 
the Tartars put the meat which they mean to eat un- 
der their hoifes fuddles, and fo bake it, as it were, at 
full gallop. This, faid he to himfeJf, might be done as 
well by another metiicd, and he refolved to try. 

No fooner faid ihsn done. He went to feek two 
pieces of flonc, pretty broad and fm.ooth, of the fame 
lort as that of which his hatchet was made. Between 
iLefe two Hones he placed a piece of meat that had no 
bones, and began immediateiy to flrike witiiout inter 
miiiion upc n tiie uppermoft ftone with his (lone mallet. 
After he hcd done this for five or fix mini.tes, the Itone 
began tf> grow hot, which made him continue to ftrike 
wih redoubled activity i (o thu in Itfs than half an

hour, the meat, partly by ilie h?at of the fl:one, and part- 
ly hy tlie prellure and weight of tl.c blows, was grown 
quite tender and fu to eat. 

No doubt the talle of it was not altogether To good as 
ifit had been properly roafced ; buc'o Robinfon, who 
had been lb long a time without tailing meat, it was a 
delicious morfel, *' O >ou," he cried, ** O you aniongil 
my countrymen, whole delicate llomachs are often 
qualmifli at the Hght of the beil food in the world, ifit 
does Eot exactly fuit the depraved fenAulity of your 
appetites, if you were only a week in my place, how 
contented would you be ail the refl: of your lives with 
whatever food Providence ftiould fend you! How care- 
ful would 30U be ofdefpillnggood victuals, and of dew- 
ing year ingratitude to the all-nouriihing bounty of 
Heaven !'' 

In order to make this meat moreuvoury, he fqueezed 
a liltie lemon jjice upon it, ar.d then he made fuch a 
meal, as he h:id net n:ade for a- long time. Neither did 
he forget to thank, from the bottom of his heart, the 
Author of all Goodnefs for this new benefit. 

When he had made an end of eating, he debated ia 
his own mind what work v/ould be themoft neceflary to 
fet about. The dread of winter, whi&h had but a lit* 
lie before affliiSted hiii io f^rongiy, made him think of 
taking or killing a great number of iijiias, merely to pro- 
vide hiinfelf with ikins ; and, a^ rheie animals feemed to 
be exceedingly tame, he hoped to accompliOi this intent 
v/ithoutmuch trouble. 

With this hope he went to bed, and found refrefhing 
fleep repaid- him richly for all his fatigues cbring the 
day.

MR. BILLINGSLEY continued the flory of Ro« 
binlbn Crufoe in tliefe words : 

Our friend Robinfoii flept till it was pretty far in ths 
day. He v/as frightened, when he awoke, to find it i'o 
lare, and, rinng brifkiy, he was going diredly to take the 
field agdinft the lamas ; but the heavens did not permit 
him. 

For no fooner did he put his head out of the cave, 
than he was obliged to draw it in again. 

j'/arrief. How was that, papa? 

Mr. Bill, h rained as hard as it could pour, fo that 
tliere was no pouibility of going out. He refuived, 
therefore, to wait until tlie ihower v^a-j over. 
/- But there appeared no likelThood of this ; on the con- 
trary, it grev/ more violent. It v/as accompanied alfo 
with lightni^ng fo bright, that his cave, which commonly 
was pretty dark, feemed to be all in a blaze ; and then 
the flailies were followed by fuch claps of thunder as he 
had- never heard. The earth trembied under the ftorm, 
rmd the echoes of the mountains repeated the ibund of 
the thunder ib of;en, that the treiiit-ndoas roar fetmed 
to be without end. 

As Kobinfoii had not received a good education, it 
was -natural enough tor "hira to be fooliihly afraid of 
the ilorm. 

Gee. What, afraid of thunder and lightning? 

Mr. Biti. Yes, fo fiightened, that ha did nu: .luov/ 
where to hide himfeif. 

Gee. Vvjiy, it is ibmething grand; how could it 
fiighten him? 

Mr. Bill. I cannot well aflign a reafon for this fear, 
Perhdps it is, that the coliection of fulphur, fait, and 
nitre, which produces the explohon of tiiunder, by tak- 
ing fire, does, lometimes, in its^courte^^ fet buildings 
on jiie, and delVoy the live: / ' ' j .-ci-d

Mr. 



70 T H E N J- W 

Mr. BilL Befulcs, ]iow many advantages does the 
ftorm bring with it! h purges the air of fu!phureou3 
vapours ; it renders the air much pur<;r and fitter to pro- 
mote the vegetation of plants; the Jurning lieat of the 
vi'e^ther it renders cool and reniperate j and, laft of all, 
it prefents us with the grandeft: and rr.ofl awful fpectacle 
in nature. 

Harriet. I love to fee the lightning dearly. Papa, 
will you let us go out with you when it thunders, that 
we may Gbfervc the courfe of the Jightning. 

Mr. BilL With all my heart. — Robinfon, as you re- 
rr.embcT, had been ili-indrufted in his youth. This 
n'as the realbn why he knew not how great an advantage 
jlormsare; how they clear the air, and make every 
thirg grov/ better in the fields and gardens; and hov/, 
confequently, they contribute to refrdb and give, as it 
were, new life to both men and arjiraals, trees and 
plaiiie. 

During the Rorm, he fit in a corner of his cave, with 
his hinds clufped together, and opprelTed with moit 
dreadful anxiety. The rain, mean while, ran down in 
ftreanis, the lightning flaflied, and the thunder roared in- 
celfantlj. It was almofl: noon day, and the violence of 
the florm h^d not, in the lead, abated. 

Robinfon was not hungry; his terror had entirely 
taken av/ay his appetite; but h's imagination was dif- 
quieted with the inotl frightful idca^. 

** The time is come," fciid he to himfelf, ** when 
Gcd wdl make me fuffer the puniiliment due to my 
tranfgrefllons. He has withdrawn from me his fatherly 
protedion. I fiiall perilL ; I {hall never behold my poor 
parents again." 

M*-. Mered, I mufl: confefs, 1 am not well pleafed rt 
all with my friend Robinfon this time. 
Edvj. Why not. Sir ? 

Mr. Meied. Had not his merciful Creator done enough 
alreadv in his favour, to convince him that he never for- 
fakes thcfe who truft in him fincerely, and vvhofe con- 
trition is undiffembled ? Had he not laved him frpm 
the moft imminent peril of death ? Had he not a' ready 
afliflcd him in fuch a manner, that he had ample reafon 

never 



ROB-IN SON CRUSOE. 71 

never to fear perifhing with hunger ? — And yet to be fo 
delponding ! Fy, fy ! It has not a good afpe6L 

Mrs. Hill. I am of your opinion, Mr. Meredith ; ne- 
verthelels, let us b^ve compailion on the poor youth. 
It was but very lately that he began to think at all, and, 
confequently, it was impOiTible for him to have made 
lb great a progrefs as one who had rtudied from his ear* 
lieft years to become always wifer and be:ter. 

Mr, Bill, My dear, you are right. Your compaflion 
for poor Robinfon is as jufl: as it is worthy of your ten- 
der nature. I myfelf begin to have, a confiderable re- 
gard for him, as he has been fome time pa^l in the right 
way. 

While he fat thus defponding, overwhelmed with 
trouble and difquiet, the ilorm, at length, began to 
abate. As the claps of thunder became lefs loud, and 
ihQ rain came down lighter, hope by degrees revived ia 
his breaft. He thought he Ihould now be able to fet out 
on his expedition againfl: the lamas, and was goi ig to 
take his hatchet and his bag, when, all at once — what 
do you think? — he fell backwards quite ftunjicd and 
fenfclefs. 

A'/VZ?. Hey-day ! What v/as the matter v/ith him, 
then ? 

Mr. Bill, Exaftly over his' head there burft the terribleO: 
noife imaginable: the earth trembled, and Robinfon 
was thrown backwards, and fell like a dead man. It feems 
the lightning had ftruck againft the tree which grew on 
the top of the cave, and (battered it all in pieces, wirh 
a found fo tremendous as deprived poor Robinfon of his 
fenfes, and he adually thought he was killed. 

He remained on the ground a confiderable time befjre 
he recovered his fenfes. At length, perceiving that he 
was fell alive, he rofe up, and the Hr!t objett that he 
beheld before the door of his cave was part of the tree 
which the lightning had torn in pieces, and thrown 
down. A fred) misfortune for RoMnfon ! How was he 
now to fiiften his hd'A^'^ of ropes, if the whole tree was 
broken dov/n, as he thought it was ? 

As the rain lad now totally ceafed, and the thunder 
was no longer heard, he took courage at lafr, to go out ; 
and then v/hat did he fee } 

That 



rz T Pi E N E W 

That vviiicli, in a moment, filled him with gratltucl<!r 
and love towards his Creator, and covered him with 
confufion for lliffering himlelf to fail into defpondency, 
as he had done. You mufl: know, fae trunic of thetree 
whi».:h liad been ilruck by the lightii?ng was all on Hre, 
Thus Robinibn found himfelf, in a moment, mafter of 
that which he had mofl; wanted, and thus Divine Pro- 
vidence had taken the moll particular care of him, ex- 
actly at the moment when he imagined, in his defpa^r, 
that he was entirely abandoned. Full of inexprelhble 
feelings of joy and gratitude, he lifted up his hands 
towards Heaven, ?.nd, fhedding a flood of tears, he 
thanked, with a loud voice, the affeftionate Father of 
the Univerfe, who governs all, and who, even when 
he permits the mofc terrif}ing events to tal'-e place, acts 
ever by the wiieft and moft charitable jeafons. ** Oh !" 
faid he, *' what, then, is man, this poor worm of the 
earth, whofe views are fo confined? What is he, to 
ddre to murmur againft that which God hath brought to 
pafs by means infcriuable to^iill mankind?" 

From that tim.e he had fire, without having had the 
leail: trouble in lighting it ; from that time it was eaf}' 
for him to keep the nre in ; and from that time he had 
reafon to be lefs uneafy about his fubfiftence in this de- 
fe/t iOand. The defign that he had upon the lamas was 
dropped for to-dry, becaufe RobinfoTi was defirous to 
• hike ufe of the fire immediately and roaft his meat, 
v/hich had been upon the fpit evet fince yelterday. 

As the nre had not yet reached the lower part of the 
tree, to which i\\Q ladder of ropes was fiiftened, he 
could mount in perfect fee urity. . He did fo, took a 
burning fplinter of the tree, d.:;fc^nded again in:o the 
cnclofure before his cave, kindled a good fire tinder hi? 
meat, and then climbed up once more to put out that 
which was ftill burning in the trunk of the tree. "I his 
he effected in a O^ort time. 

And novv he id about performing the duty of a cook. 
He Lcndt;j the fire and turned the fpit \ ery carefully. 
The fight of the hre rejoiced him infiLltely j he looked 
up'jn it a'o a precionc. gifc which God iiad fent him from 
the clouds, and whilt he reflected on the great i-dvan- 
rages that he fhould enjoy from thepoiieiriau pi it, his 

eye3 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. f^ 

Cyes were often turned with gratitude towards Heaven. 
And during the refl: cf his life, as often as he Taw or 
thought of fire, he never failed to lay within himfelf, 
** That alio God qa^ve me.'''' 

Mr. Mered. Fire, whicli prefervcs all that breathe en 
this earth, is an emblem of the Divinity ; it is the no- 
bleft of all elements. 

Mr. Bill. Hence it is th-it the woiftjip of firehath beea 
very common amongfi: the ignorant Pagans. At RoiT.e 
It was preferved in the temple of V'cfta ; at Athens, in 
that of Vlinerva ; at Delphi, in that of Apollo ; and you 
niufi: remember how much it was reverenced in Perfia. 

Mr, Mered. Yes, but thank Heaven we are better in- 
ftru6led, and i-:now that fire is not God, but a gift of 
God's bounty, like water, earth, and air, Vv'hich he hath 
created from the love he bears us. 

Mr. Bill. Robinfon, during his repafl: the day before, 
liad only regretted the want of fait, which would have 
improved the tafte of the meat that h,^ dreffed by blo'.vs 
of the mallet. He hoped, however, in time to find Tome 
fait in his ifland ; for the pre fen t he contented himfelf 
with going to tlie (hore, and bringing home, in a cocoa- 
nut-fliell, fome fea water, v>/ith which he iprinkled his 
meat feveral times, falting it in this manner, in default of 
a bf cter. 

His meat was no.w done. The joy with which he 
cut off the firft flice, and put the firfi bit into his mouiii, 
cannot be delcribed, but by one, who, like him, (hould 
not have taftcd for a month before a fingle mouthful of 
meat properly drcll, and who (hould have almoft given 
up the hopes of ever taking any lu'ch again. 

After th:s, the main point u as how to keep in- his fire 
al'vavs. 

G^o. That he could eafily manage by ad-, ing con- 
flantly frefli wood. 

Mr. Bill. Very good. But at night, while he was 
afleep, it there came a fudden Oiower, what was he to 
do then ? 

Harriet. But, papa, I'll tell you what ; I would 
have made the tire m my cave where the rain could 
not come. 

D Mr, 



74 T H E N E W 

Mr, BilL No bad thought. But, unfortunately, his 
cave was (o fmall, that it juft lerved him to lie down in : 
and, then, chimney he had none ; fo that the fmoke 
would have been exceedingly inconvenient to him ; he 
could not have borne it. 

Harriet, Nay, in that cafe I do not know how to afllft 
him. 

Rich, What a terrible fituation ! There muH: always 
happen fomething to puzzle poor Robinlon. One would 
think, now and then, that he was made completely 
happy ; but, } our humble fervant, fomething new 
comes all at once to crofs him. 

Mr, Bill. This may (hew you how extremely difficult 
it is for one man fingly to provide for all his own necef- 
(Ities, and how great the advantages are that we enjoy 
from civil life. My dear children, we (hould be but 
poor miferable beings, if we were obliged each of us to 
live by himielf, and if nobody -vere to receive any affifl- 
ance from his fellow-creatures. A thoufand hands are 
not fufficient to prepare what each of us wants every 
day. 

Rich. Oh ! papa ! — 

Mr, BilL What, do you think that incredible ? Well, 
]et us reckon how many things you havit had occafion 
for this day. In the firll place, you have 'flept till fun- 
rife this morning, and that on a good bed. 

Rich, With a mattrefs underneath. - 

Mr, Bill. Very well. Mattrelfes are tluffed with 
horfe-hair : this horfe-hair requires two hands to cut it, 
two more to weigh and fell it, two to pack it up and 
fend it off, two to receive it and unpack \ty and two, 
again, to fell it to theladdler or uphoKkrer : laftly, the 
*upi.oiuerer's hands hnd employment in picking it and 
fillinfT the mattrefs with it. The cover of this mattrefs 
is tickling ; where has that been made ? 

Rich. At the weaver's. 

Mr. Bill. And how ? 

Rich. In a loom, v.ith thread, and a fhuttle, and 
paue, and — 

Mr. Bill, That is enough. How many hanJs did it 
take to make the loom? Let us be moderate, and fay, 
fonnftance, twenty, Pai'te is made of flour. Wat a 

number 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 75 

number of things mufb be done before we can have 
flour f How many hundreds of hands t»uft be moved, to 
make every thing that belongs to a mill, where wheat is 
ground into flour ! — Hut to return to the weaver: thread 
is what he principally ufes ; where does he get this ? 

Rich. From the women who Ipin it. 

Mr. Bill. Out of what ? 

Rich. Flax. 

Mr, Bill. And do you know, again, through how 
many hands flax muft pafs before it can h(f fpua ? 

Rich. Oh yes, we were reckoning that lately. In the 
firft place, the hufbandman fifts the flax feed, that it 
may not be mixed with tares : then the land muft be 
dunged and ploughed twice i,afrer which they fow, and 
then harrow. Next, when the flax begins tofprout up, 
a number of women am girls come to weed it. Again, 
when it grows to a proper height, they pluck up the 
ftalks, and ripple them in order to pull off the little 
round heads that contain the feed. 

E(kv. Yes, and then they tie the ftalks together in 
bundles, and fteep them in water. 

Henry. And when the bundles have been fteeped long 
enough, they take ihem up out of the water. 

Geo. And fpread them in the fun to dry. 
Chdf I'Jte. Then they clear the flax from the hulls with 

a break, 

Harriet. Not yet, my dear Charlotte ; it muft be 
well pounded firft. 

Charlotte. Very true, and then they breah it, and 
then 

Rich. And then iheyfcutch it, and then they hackle it 
to fcparate it from the cow. 

Mr. Bill. Now, p'». together all thefe things, which 
muft necefl*arily be done before we can have linen ; 
confider, alio, how many forts of diff^erent labours are 
required to make the inftrnments ufed by the huib^nd- 
man, the flax-dreifer, and thj fpinner ; and you muft 
own I do not exceed the truth in faying, that more than 
a ti;oufand hands have been employed in the making of 
your mattrefs. 

Geo, A thoufand hands ! It is wonderful, and yet \t 
is veiv true. 

D z Mr, 



76 T H E N E W 

Mr. Bill. Tn the next place, confider Iiow many 
tliingsyou havedaily occafion for, and tlien pruy tell me, 
(liould it TurpriCe us that Robinf n Cruloe found him- 
Iclfevcry now and then puzzled ind at a ftand, when 
not another hand in the world hut his own worked for 
Iiim, and when he hiid not a Hngle one of tliofe inftru- 
irents by means of which things in this part of the 
world are fo eafily and expeditioufly made. 

Ac this time, therefore, what puzzled him was tlie 
finding of fome method or other to hinder his dear fire 
from goir>^ out. Sometimes he feratched his head as if 
lie woi Id liave plucked a lucky thou j;ht out ot it ; ag^in, 
letting his hands fall, he would walk backwards and for- 
wards in his enclofure, not knowing what to have re- 
courfe to. At laft he fixed his eyes by chance on the 
rock at the edge of his cave, and that moment the 
thought firuck him how he v/as to a6l. 
Henry, Eh ! how was that ? 

Mr. Bill. There proje6ted out of the rock, about a 
yard from the ground, a very large and thick ledge of 
ftone. 

Chaihtte. How large might it be ? 
Mr. Bill. Vvhy really I have not been able to pro- 
cure the exaft proportions of it ; but 1 will luppofe, at 
a guefs, that it was about as long as 1 am, its breudih 
and thicknefs might be a yard and a half. 

Though i.t iiad rainetl very hard, the ground under 
this large piece of tht rock was perfectly dry. Robin- 
ion faw at once that this fpot v/ould anlwcr every pur- 
pofe of a fire-place, being completly (lielteied from all 
accidents; but he faw, moreover, that it would require 
no great trouble to make a proner kitchen under the 
ftonc, together wiih hearth and c imney, and therefore 
refolved to go immicdiately to work about it. 

With his Ipade he hollowed the ground under the 
great ftone about a yard deep. After that, lie conceived 
the idea of enclofing this gr<jund, at the fide, v^ith two 
fmall walls reaching up to the ftone itfelf. 
Geo. JBut how could he make wails ? 
Mr. bill. He had been accuftomed, you know, mi- 
nutely to remark every thing that he met with, and he 
always afked himfelf the queftion, ** What uie maybe 

made 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 77 

made of this ?" He had, amongfl: other things;, obferved 
a particular fort of clay in one part of his illand, upon 
fight of which he ir^med'ately laid to himfelf, ** Per- 
haps this clay would make good bricks, if ever 1 fhould 
have occafion to build a wal!." 

At that moment he recollecled the clay, and, having 
nearly finilhed hollowing out his kitchen, he took his 
fpade and his knife of flint, and repaired to the fpot 
where this clay was to be found, in order to fet about 
th€ work without delay. 

The heavy rain had made the clay fo fofr, that he 
found no difficulty in fhaping it to the form of bricks, 
and cutting it fmoolh with his knife. After preparing a 
pretty good number of thefe bricks in a lliort time, he 
placed them, befide each other, in a ipot where the fun 
fhone ail day. He determined to go on v^^ith this work 
the next day, and in the mean time returned home to 
eat the reft of his roaft meat, the eagernefs with v/hich 
he had worked having (harpened his appetite. That he 
might regale himielf in a princely manner on fucli a day 
of rejoicing as the prefent, he indulged himfelf by add- 
ing to his lupper a cocoa-nut from the fraall number of 
thofe that ftill remained. 

The repaft v/as excellent. '* Ah !" faid Robinfon,. 
(ighing from the bottom of his heart, which was parti v 
content and partly forrowful, *' Ah I how happy fhould 
I be at this moment, if I had but one fmgle friend, mere- 
ly a man, were it the mod miferable beggar in the world, 
to bear me company j one fingle man, whom I might 
call my friend, while I profelfed to him an equal friend- 
fhip! Had I, at leaft, the happinefs of being mafber of 
fome tame animal, a dog or car, to whom I might fliev/ 
kindnefs in order to gain its affection ! liut to live thus 
ibiitary, abfolutely cut off from every living creature, 

and as if I were the only being upon earth ! Here a 

few tears dropped down his ciieeks. 

He then recalled to memory the time, when, having it 
in his power to enjoy the fweel fociety of his brothers 
and other companions, he neverthelefs had frequently- 
quarrelled and difputed with them: the recollection of 
this filled him with b'tter forrow. ** Ah!'' faid he to 
himfelf^ ** how little I then knew the value of a friend, 
D 3 and 



78 T R E N E W 

and the impofTihility of doing without the love and 
efleern ofour neighbours, if we would live happy ! Oh, 
if I could now begin to pafs thole days over again, with 
what comphiifance and good-narure would I behave to- 
wards my brothers and other children ! How patiently 
would I put up w ith Imall offences, and how would I 
exert myfelf to charm every body with my gentlenefs 
and good behaviour, and force them to love me in their 
turn ! Heavens I Why did [ n( t know how to value the 
happinefs of friendfhip until I had loft that happinefs — 
ala!' ! loft h for ever r" 

V.'ith thefe words he turned his eyes accidentally to- 
wards the entrance (/fnis little lodge, and perceived a 
fpider v;hich had fpread its web in a corner. The 
thought of lying under the lame roof with fome living 
creiture fo filled him with joy, that he did not trouble 
bimlHfin the leaft about the fpecies of the animal. He 
refolved to catch flies every da\ for this fpider, to fliew 
It that it lived in a place of freedom and friendfliip, and 
in order to make it tame? if it Wiis pofiible. 

As it wasftillday, and the air, freftiened by the ftorm, 
was infinitely agreeable to the fenfe, Robinfon did not 
chule to go to bed yet, and, that he might employ the 
time in iomewhai ufeful, he took up his fpade again, 
and began to hollow out the ground for his kitchen. In 
doin^Mhi,^. hcftruck ali at once upon fomethinghard that 
was in the; earth, and was very near breaking his Ipade. 

He took it at fir ft for a ftone; but what was his afto- 
nifliment, Vv-hen, having drawn out a great heavy lump 
gt fomething, he difco\ ered it to bt — pure gold ! 

Rui: Gracious ! Well, he certainly has furprifing 
luck, this Mr. Robinfon Crufce. 

Mr, Bill. Surprifuigluck, indeed ! This mafs of gold 
was lo thick, that, had it been coin'vd, it would hive 
produced upwards ofio,cool. Behold hrm, thertf^re, 
, at.p.efent, a man of vaft fortune! What a number of 
things could he procure hiuilclf now ! He could bui!d 
himlelfa fine houle, he could have a carriage, horfes, 

footmen, ape?, monkies ; he could 

Geo. Ay ; but v/here v;a3 lie' to have all th fe things 
^nhisifland? There was nobody there that had any 
thing to fell. <^

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 79 

Afr, Bill. Oho ! I had forgot, — Rohinfon, however, 
did not ; i'o that, inftead of rejoicing for the treafure 
tha' '^e had found, he kicked it from him with contempt, 
and faid, " Lie tiiere, mif'erable metal, which men in 
general covet To grecdilv, and which they purchafe with 
{0 many bafe a(^ions and even crimes ! Of what ufe art 
thou to iiie? Oh! tha', '" thy place, I had found a 
good lump of iron, with which I might, perhip?, have 
made myfelf a hatchet or a knife! How willinglj 
would \ give t!iee for u handful of iron nails, or for 
fome ufeful indrumenr !"— He left, therefore, all this 
precious treafure lying negletled on the ground, and 
afterwards, as he paffed by, fcarce thought it worth a 
look. 

Harriet. I'll tell you what, papa. He did exadly as 
the cock did. 

Mr. Bill. What cock ? 

Hafriet. Oh ! do you forget the fable that you read 
to us one day ? Once upon a time there was a cock — 

Mr Bill. What next ? 

Harriet. That fcratched upon a dunghill, and found 
a — what was it ? 

Mr. Bill. A pearl ? 

Harriet. Ah ! yes ; a pearl — And then he faid, " Of 
what life art thou to me with all thy brightnefs > If I 
had found, inftead of thee, a grain of barley, it wouid- 
have been of much more fervice to me." Saying this,, 
he left the pearl on the ground, and went away without 
taking any farther notice of it. 

Mr. Bill. Very good. Juft lb did Robinfon with the 
• lump of gold. 

Night now came on. The fun had for fome time 
funk beneath the main — 

Gic. What, in the fea ? 

Mr. HilL So it appears to thofe who live in an ifland, 
and fee nothin'g round the.m but water. The fun, in 
fa<5l, feems to them to finl: down into t'le fea at night 
v/hen he lets ; and, therefore, people foroetimes exprefs^ 
tbemfelves thus, as if the thing were really fo.

Harriet. Ch ! look, look, dear papa ; our moon too 
begins to appear yonder. 

Rich. Oh ! what an enchanting fight ! how mild her 
light is ! how pleafing ! 

Mr. Sill, Well, my dears, Robinlon is alleep, while 
his fire, kept up by large pieces of wood, continues to 
bLrn Oowly. Now, what do you think of doing in the 
iviean time ? 

Ediv. I think, at lead, that I {"hall hardly fleep much

loa's adventures. 



SEVENTH EVENING. 

TH E following evening, before Mr. Billlngflev be- 
gan the contiiiuuioii of Kobiiilbn Crufoe's hiftory, 
he expreffed himlelf chu5 : i hope, my dear children, 
that, in relating this hiilory to yo'i, 1 do not detain yoa 
from any employmenc more agreeable or improving, I 
would not pur the leatr condraint on you ; fo that when- 
ever our {hend Robinlon grows tirelume to you 

Edv^\ Tireibme, papa? It is impolFiblc, 

Mr. Bill, However, 1 obfeived Ibme of yon, yefler- 
day evening, gape and yawn a good deal. 

Geo. Oh ! papa, the realon of that v/as, that v/e had 
worked ^ery hard in our gardens all the afternoon, fo 
that it was no wonder if we were a little fleepy towards 
night. 

Ejvj. To-day we have only been weeding and water- 
ing our'lettuce beds, fo that we are quite freih. 

Harriet. Oh 1 quite frelb, papa i look how 1 can 
^ump. 

Mr. Bill. Well ; you have only to tell me whenever 
this ftory begins to grow heavy or dull. 

Ricr. Ohf never fear J Til warrant you. 

Mr. BdL Then I proceed. 

As 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 8i 

As the heat was exceflive in Robinfon's iOand during 
the diy tinie, he wa? obliged, whenever he undertook 
anv thing lahorious, lo work at it very early in the morn- 
ing, or elfe in the cool of rhe evening. He role, there- 
fore, before the fun, put frefli wood to his fire, and ate 
the half of a cocoa nut that he had left fince the even- 
ing before. A^ttr this he intended to have put another 
joint of his lania on the fpit ; but he found the fiefh al- 
ready tainted, on account of the extraordinary heat. He 
was, therefore, obHged to go without the pleufure of eat- 
ing meat for that day. 

Upon this, he prepared to fet out for the clay-pit ;■ 
ard, putting on his pouch, he found ilill remaining 
in it the potatoes which he had brought home two 
davs before. He refolved to try the experiment of 
drelung them ; fo put them down clofe by his fire, and 
having covered them with hot a(hes, he fet out. 

He worked fo hard, that before twelve o'clock he 
had prepared as many bricks as -he thought he fhould, 
have occafion for, to complete the wall of his kitchen. 
He next went dovv'n to the beach to look for fome 
oyders ; but inftead of oyders, of which he found only 
very few, he difcovered, to his great joy, another fort of 
food, much better than any that he had found yet. 

Rich, What was that, papa ? 

Mr. B II. it was an animal, the HeOi of which, it is 
tri-e, he had never tailed; but he had f-equently heard 
that it was the moft whoiefome and delicious imagin- 
able.- 

Rich. Well, then, what was it ? 

Mr. r.ill. A turtle, and fo large, that it is rare to feg 
th^ like in thofe parts. It might weigh loolb. 

Geo.. Why, it mufthave been a monfter of a turtle. 
Are there really fuch great ones ? 

Rich. Oh! \es; and much larger flill. Have you 
forgot what papa read from Captain Cook's Voyages. 
The turtle that his people found in the South beas 
weighed 3polb. 

Geo. joolb. — aflonifhing ! 

Mr, Bill. l^oSmfon loaded his fiioulders with h:^ 

prize, and nrarclied ilovvly homewards. — When he ar^ 

rived at his cell, iiis liril care was to come at the flc'h 

D5 ff 



Sz THE NEW 

of the turtle, which he did, at length, by cutting open, 
witii hi^ hiirchet, the lower fl:ell that covered its belly ; 
he then kiiltd it, and cut olf a gcod part of it to roaft, 
which, having hxed upon the fpit, he vv:iited with im- 
patience until it was done, for his Vv'ork had confiderably 
ftjarpened his appetite. 

While lie turned the fpit, he confidercd with himfelf 
what he niuft do with the reft of the turtle, to keep it 
from tainting. To iak it would have been the only 
efieclual way, but then he had neither tub nor fait. 

It filled him with concern to think that all that fine 
turtle, the fitfh of which ^A/•ouId nourilh him for more 
than a week, muft be unfit to eat the next day j and 
yet he could not think of any expedient to fave it. All at 
once a thought firuck him. The upperfnell of the turtle 
was (haped like a large bowl. ** That," laid he, 
**n^ali ferve me for a trough to fait it in — but where' 
is the fait ? 

** Only think, what a great fool I muft he !" cried 
he, ftriking his hand againft his head ; ** cannot 1 fteep 
this meat in lea-water, and will not that have the fame 
effect, or nearly i'o, that brine would ha*- e ? A lucky 
thought ! a lucky thoughr I" cried he ; and his joy made 
hiiT: turn the fpit twice as fad as before. 

His turtle was now nicely done. ** Ah I" faid Ro- 
binfon, fighing, afiey he had tafted, with iiiuch fatisfac- 
tion, a fmall bit of it which he thought very favoury, 
•* if one had the leafl; morfel of bread with this ! How 
ftupid was J, in my youth, not to know that we (hould 
thank God for a bit of dry bread ! I was feldom con- 
tented if my bread was not loaded with butter, and even 
then, perhaps, I mufthave cheefe. Oh idiot that I was ! 
How happy ihould I now be with a piece of the biackeil 
rye bread chat ever was made in my country ?" 

While he was taken up with thefe refledtions, he re- 
coUecied the potatoes that he had left in the afhes be- 
fore he went out in the morning. ** Let us fee," faid 
he, ** how they will turn out;'* and he took up one of 
them. 

Here was new caufe of rejoicing I The fruit, which 
was before fo hard, was now become quite tender; and 
when he opened it, the fmell was fo pleafing, he never 

hefitatcd 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 83 

hefitated to conclude that the tafte muft be equally {o. 

In effefl, this root tailed as agreeable — as agreeable as 

Eh ? Who will help me out with a fimile ? 

Mr. Mereci. As agreeable as a potatoe. 

Mr. Bill. Even fo. That fettles it all in one word. 
In (hcrt, Robinfon perceived hat this root, which was 
io agreeable to the tafve, would fupply the place of 
bread. 

He made, therefore, a magnificent repaft ; after which, 
ar. the fun was burning hot, he threw himfelf on the bed 
for a while, to confuier at his eafe what work he Ihould 
begin when the violence of the heat was over. 

'** What piece of work,'* faid he, ** fhould I under- 
take at prefc-nt ? The fun muft harden my bricks be- 
fore I can begin my wall. The beft way then, certain- 
ly, will be to go and kill a couple of lamas. — But what 
am 1 to do with fuch a quantity of meat ? — What, if I 
fnould hang up fome of it to dry in the fmoke of my 

kitchen? -Excellent!" cried he; and with thefC' 

words he bounced from his bed, and fat down in the 
front of his intended kitchen, to deliberate on che means 
of fucceeding in this plan. 

He prefently faw thdt the thing might be done well 
enouh. He had only to leave two holes in the walls 
that h- was to build, and through them to run a large 
flick acrofs. Ic was an eaiy matter to hang his hams 
and flitches upon this, an-d the fmoke of the chimney 
would do the relh This happy thought was near turn- 
ing his head with joy. What would he have given 
that his bricks were already hard enough, that he might 
begin the grand work that very moment! But there 
was no help for it j lie muft be content to wait until the 
fun hardened his br:cks. 

Something, however, muft be done to employ the 
time. While he meditated what that Ihould be, a frelh 
thought ftruck h'm, which by far i'urpalfed, in clever- 
nefs, all that he had hitherto conceived. And he was 
afiou'lhed at his folly in n..t having hit upon it before. 
Rico, What was it, then ? 

Mr Hill. No more than this $ he refolved, in order that 
he might have compsny, and at the fame time provide 
^cr hu fubfiltence, to bring up Ibme tame animals. 

Geo, 



84 T H E N E W 

C^o. Ah ' fome of the lamas, I dare fay. 

Mr, ^/7/,-Right. In fact, thtfe were the only animals 
that he had feen hitherto. As thefe lamas appeared al- 
ready to be extremely tame, -he hoped he (hould fuccecd 
. in taking a couple of ihem alive. 

Geo. Oh I that would be delightful. I fhould like to 
be along with him, to have another couple. 

Mr. Bill Bur pray, George, how would you con- 
trive it ? They were hardly ib tarae as to let themfelves 
be caught. 

Geo, Then how did Robinfon mean to do ? 

Mr. PJit. That was the very point that Rob^n^on 
bad many long and fcrious deliberations upon. But 
man, w!:ere an undertaking is not in itftlfabfolutely im- 
polhble, man needs but to 1:7// ferioufly and with per- 
ieverance, and nothing is infurmountable to his under- 
flanding and induHry ; fo great and manifold are the 
faculties with which our good Creator hath endow- 
ed us \ 

Attend to this, my dear children, and never de- 
fpair of fuccefs in any labour or difrtculty whatfoever, 
provided you take the firm refolution of not giving over 
imtil you ha\e accomplifhed n. Unwearied applica- 
tion, conftant refie6tion, and a courage that perfevcres 
in fpite of every obflacle, have often brought enterprizes 
to a period which were at firft deemed impra6ticable. 
Never, therefore, fuf?er yourfelves to be difcouraged by 
the difficulties which you will meet with in the affairs of 
life ; but always refie<5t that the more exertion it has ccft 
to bring a bufinefs to a happy iifue, the more joy one 
feels at having accomplifl;ed it. 

Robinfon ibcn fucceeded in hitting upon a method 
to take the lamas alive. 
^ick. What was it? 

Mr. Bill. He propofed to make a noofe upon a cord^ 
and, hiding himfelf behind a tree, to throw the noofe 
over the head of the firft lama that fhould approach. 

With this intent, he twifted a pretty ftrong cord, and 
■;n a few hours the cord and the noofe were completed: 
he made a trial or two to fee whether the noofe would 
catch wellj and it anfwered perfedly to his wilL 

A? 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 85 

As the place by which the lamas were accuftom.ed to 
p'afs, in their way to the water, was pretty far off", and 
becaufe he was not lure whether they would pals by 
there that evening, as it was about noon that he faw 
them go to drink before, he put off till next day the ex- 
ecution of his projed : in the mean time he made the 
preparations requillte for the journey. 

That is to fay, he went to the fpot where the pota- 
toes grew, and filled his bag with them. Part of them 
he put down in. the warm afbes to roaft, and the reft he 
threw into a corner of his cave for a future ftcre. In the 
next place, he cut off a pretty large piece of his turtle 
to ferve for fupper and the next morning's breakfafl:, and 
fteeped what remained in fea water, which he hud 
brought with him for the purpofe. 

LalUy, he dug a fmall hole in the ground, which was. 
to be his celiar, for want of a better. In it he pluced 
his turtle fhell with the faltcd meat, placed over that the 
piece that he meant to roaft for fupper, and then covered 
the whole with fmall branches of trees. 

For the rell: of the afternoon, in order to refrefti his 
fpir'ts, he indulged himi'eif with an agreeable walk along 
the fea fide, where there blew a fine frcfb eafterly breeze, 
which rendered the air agreeably cool. His eyes tra- 
verfed with pleafure the immenfe ocean, whofe furface 
was then gently agitated by fmall waves following each 
other in (low fucceftion to the fnore. He turned his 
eyes fondly towards the part of the world where his 
dear country was fituated, and a few trembling tears 
trickled down his cheeks at the remembrance of his be- 
loved parents. 

** What are they doing now, thofe poor difconfolate 
parents?" cried he, bathed in tears, and clafping his 
hands together. *' If they have furvived the bitter for- 
rov/ which I unhappily have caufed them, alas ! what 
grief confumes their days ! How muft they figh to be- 
hold themfelves childlefs ; to fee their laft, their only 
fon, become a traitor to their love, and abandoning thein 
for ever ! Oh my deareft, beft of fathers ! my tender, 
affedtionate mother I pardon, ah, pardon your unhappy 
ion for thus afflicting you ! And thou, O Heavenly 
father, at prefent my pnly father, my only fociety, my

onlv fupport and protC(5lor ! — [here he threw himfelf 
upon his knees in the pollure of adorutionj — Oh, my 
Creator, (hed thy mod precious bleOing, fljcd al) the 
happinefs which thou hafl dellinfd for me, and of which 
I have rendered myfcJf unworthy, died them upon my

thus con.fole them for their fuiTerings. Ah ! liow chear- 
fully will I endure wl:acever difpenfation it fhali pleaie 
thy wifdom and mercy to appoint for me in order to my 
future amendment, could but my poor parents, who are 
innocent, be made happy !'■• 

He remained a little longer on his knees, looking up to 
Heaven in filent grief, hikI hi^: eyes fwimming in tears. 
At length he rofe, and, with his kn'fe of flint, he cut 
out upon the tender bark of a tree that was at hand, the 
rauch-loved names of his parent?. Over them he placed 
thefe words, *' God blefs you !" and below, ** Mercy 
to your loft Ton :" Afcer that, his lips, v;arm with af- 
fection, kilfed the names which he had cut out, and he 
bedewed them with hio teare. He afcerv^'ards engraved 
the!e fame names, which were io dear to him, upon a 
number of other trees in other parts of the idaid, and, 
frooi that lime forward, be generally offered up his 
prayers at the foot of one of thefe iiees, and never failed 
to remember his parents in them = 

Geo. For once, 1 think, he behaved well. 
Mr, Bill* He is, at prel'cnt, in the fairefc train io be- 
C )mean honefland good man, and for this he' is indebt- 
ed to the wife Providence of Heaven which conducted 
him hither. 

Geo, He might nov/, therefore, return to his parents, 
if Providence thouglit fit. 

Mr. 'lilt. God, v/ho forefeet every thing that v/ill 
happen, knows bell: v/hatisfor tlie advantage of any man, 
and will regulate the events ofhi^ life accordingly. It is 
true, circumftances have kindled a fpark of vii tue in Ro- 
binfon's bieafl;, but who can tell if other circumftances 
would net qaickly extinguifn this fpark again ; and if he 
wis at this moment taken from his iOand, and ref^oredco 
his t'sitlier's houie^ v/ho knows whether the infeQion of 

exam- 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 87 

exaiiiple and profperity would not corrupt him once 
more ? Oli, my cJiildren, how juft is this precept, ** Let 
him that ilandeth take heed left he fall !" 

While Robinlbn walked backwards and forwards on 
the beach, it occurred to kirn that he would do v;ell to 
bathe himfelf. He therefore took off h's cloaths ; but 
how was he territied on feeing the condition of his fhirt, 
the only one that he had ! As he had worn it without 
Ihifting for fo long a time, and in io hot a climate, one 
could icarceiy perceive that the linen had ever been 
Vv^hite. Wherefore, before he bathed himfelf, he took 
care to wafh this fhirt as well as poflible, and, having 
hung it upon a tree to dry, he jumped into the water. 

He had learned to Iwim pretty early, fo that, b^ing 
perfect mailer of the exercife, he amufed himfelf with 
Iwimming out to a good diliance from the ihore towards 
a neck of land that extended pretty far into the fea, and 
upon which he had never been yet. 

0>ar/cfc. A neck of land ? V^hat is that ? 
Mr. FiU. We give that name to a long piece of land, 
one end of which joins an illand or a continent, and 
the other ft etches out into the fea. You underftand ? 
Charloite, Oh, perfedly. 

Mr, Bill. This thought of Robinfon's was very 
Iuck\ ; for he found that rhe neck of land was, during 
the time of high water, entirely covered, and that, on 
the ebbing of the tide, a con/derabie quantity of tur- 
tles, oylters, and mufcles, were left behindi This 
time, indeed, he could net carry any of them away, 
neither did he want them at prelent, as his kitchen was 
fufficientl) ftored : however, the difcovery of them 
afforded him no fmall degree of Iktisf.tlion. 

That part of the fea in which he Iwam abounded 
with tiih ib plentifully that he could almoll have caught 
them with his hands, if he had had a net he inight 
have taken them by thoufands ; however, though he 
had none, he hoped, as he had been hitherto fo fortu- 
nate in all his undertakings,/ that he might one day or 
other be mafter of a tiihing net. 

Satisfied with thefe di'coveries, he came out of the 
water, after having been a full hour in it. The heat of 

the 



88 T H E N E W 

the fun had entirely dried liis Oiirt, and he had the plea" 
fure once mere of putting on clean linen. 

But, as he irid contra-^^ed the hahit of reflc6ling upon 
every thing, he confidered that this pleifure could not 
lad: vcrv long ; for, having but one (hirt, he was obliged 
to wear it conflantly, and, when it was worn out, he 
bad none to replace it. This reflection damped his joy 
a good deal ; nevcrlhel fs, he took courage, and after 
he had drelled himiclf, returned to his habitation, fre- 
quendy refieat! ng to himlelf, *' The Lord be prailVd for 
allthl^g^:!" 

Rich, He is right now not to fufFer himfdf to be ca^ 
down ordefpond, but to put a reafonable tTuft in Pro- 
vidence. 

liani^t. Oh how I flaould like to fee Robinfon. I ana 
very fond of him. 

Gfo. If papa would only give me paper, I fhould like 
to write h.im a letter. 
Edvj. So would I too. 

Rich. And I ; it would give me great pleafure to 
write to him.

fay to him ; 1 v/il! write for you. 

Martiit. Oh, thank ye, mama, that will do charm- 
ingly. 

Mrs, Btlh Come, then, I Vv-ill give you all paper. 
Upon this, they retired to the next room for about 
half an hour, at the end of which time they all returned 
in great fpirits, with each his letter in his hand. 

Haniet, Here, papa, here is ray letter; pray be fo 
good as to read it.

thefe letters, it won't be in my power to fend them. 

Geo. La ! why not ? 

Mr. BilL By reaibn that P.obinfon has been long 
fince in heaven, and his body is returned to dull:. 

G>5. Ah ! what, is he dead ? and but juft now he has 
been bathing himfelf! 

Mr. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. qi 

Mr. Bill. You forger, my dear George, that what I 
relate to you concerning Robinfon Cruibe, happened 
fifty years ago : ib that he muft have been dead a long 
time. But i am now writing his hiftoryj and fliall take 
care to have your letters printed along with it. 

Harriet. Oh ! that will be charming. But in tht 
mean time, I fuppole, papa, you will go on tilling us 
•fomething of hini. 

Mr. Bill. With pleafure. I have things to tell you 
flill that will pleal'e you as well as what you have al- 
ready heard. But for this evening, I think, we have 

had enough. Robinfon, after bathing himlelf, went 

home to his dwelling place, ate his fupper, laid his 
prayers, and went to reft contentedly. 
And it is time for us to do fo too. 



EIGHTH EVENING. 

\/TR' Bill> Well, where did we leave off lad nfght ? 
Henry. Where Rohinion went to bed after bathing. 
Mr. Bill. Oh ! right. — Well, then» Robinfon rofe 
the next morning early, and prepared for the chace. He 
furnifhed his pouch ivi:h plent) of roaued potatoes, and 
a good large llice of roafttd turrle, which he wrapped up 
in the leaves of the cocoa-nut tree. Next he flung his 
hatchet by hh fide, tied the cord, Vv'hich he had made 
the day before for catching the lamas, round his waift, 
took his umbrella in his hand, and began his march. 

It was very early; he re'iulved, therefore, for this, 
time, to take a round, in order to make hinifelf ac- 
quainted withfome other parts of his ifland. Amongll: 
the numbers of various birds that flutter about the trees,, 
he remarked fome parrots, the colours of whofe plumage 
were extraordinary beautiful. How did he wifli to have 
one of them that he might tame it, and have it for his 
companion! But the old ones were too cunning to be 
caught, and he could no v.'here difcover a ne ft with- 
young ones. He was obliged, therefore, to put ofF 

the 



«2 T H E N E W 

the gratification of this wi(h until fome other oppor- 
tunirv. 

In return for this difjppointment, he difcoxcred, in 
the conrl'e of his wal'c, a thing much more neceTary ro 
him than a parrot ; for, getting to the top of a hill near 
the l?a-<'ide, and looking down betvv'een the cracks of 
the rock, he faw fomething lie on the ground which ex- 
cited his curiofity. iie let hi; fcjf down by the alhri:- 
ance of his feet i»nd hand.^, and found, to his great fa- 
tisfa(5^ion, chat it it was— what do you. think ? 

henry. Pearls, perhaps. 
^ Ric'\ Yes, trulv, the fight of pearls would have given 
him great lati^fadion I Perhaps it was iron. 

Eiki'. Nay, do not you know that iron is not to be 
found in hot climates? It was, perhaps, another lump of 
gold. 

Harriet. Nonfenfe ! Would that have made him glad ? 
Gold was of no ufe to him, you heard before 

Mr, Bill. I fee you will not be able to guefs, then; I 
will tell you. What he found was — I'alt. 

Hitherto he had, it is tiue, in fome refpe£l, fupplied 
the want of fait with fea- water ; but, after all, that was 
rot fait. The fea-water lias a bitter tafte which is veiy 
difagreeable; and, befsdes, it was a miftake to think that 
meat ialted in this manner would keep; becaufefea- 
water, as well as that of a fpring or river, grows (linking 
after it has flood fome tim". L was, therefore, a very 
lucky thing that he fjund f jme real fair, and he filled 
both his pockets with it, in order to fupply himfelf with 
a {lock for immediate ufe. 

Gffc. How did that fait come there, papa ? 

Mr. Bill. Then you do not remember what I told you 
one day concerning the original of fait ? 

Rich. Oh \ yes ;. I vccoIle(5l it ftill. Some they take . 
out of th^ earth, fome they make of falt-v/ater that flows 
in fprings, and fome again, is made from fea-water. 

Mr. Bill. Now, the fa't made from fca- water is either 
prepared by men or by the fun, 

Geo. The fun ? 

Mr. Bill. Yes; for when any lea-water is left upon 
the land, after a high tide, or a i4ood, the fun makes the 

water 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 93 

water by de2;rees to evaporate, and what remains on the 
ipot is then fait. 

Hartift. Weil, that is comical. 

Mr. Bill. See with what kindness F^eaven provides for 
us ! That v/hich we can lea*! do without, does always 
require the leaft prepiratioii bj' art, and is alwavs found 
in the greatertabunda':ce. 

Robinfon went in high fpirits to the place where he 
hoped to noofe a lama. When he came there, he faw 
none ; but then it was not quite noon. He fat down, 
therefore, at the foot of a tree to regale himfelf with his 
roalled turtle and potatoes. How much more favoury 
did they tafte to him nowxhat he had a Little fait to eat 
wich them ! 

Juft as he had finiflied his meal, the lamas appeared at 
adiftance, coming towards him with fkips and bounds. 
Robinfon quickly placed himielf in a pofture of attack, 
and waited with his noofe ready for the approach of one 
of the lamas. Several had palfed him beyond his reach ; 
but, all at once, there came up one fo near to him, that 
he fcarce needed more than to drop the noofe to have 
him fafi: in it. He did fo, and that moment the lam.a 
was his prifoner. 

The poor bead would have bleated, but left that 
fliould frighten the reii, Robinfon pulled the noofe fo 
tight, that the lama was completely filenced. He then 
dragged it 33 fa ft as he could into a thick coppice to 
•hide it ;rom the reft. 

This iama was a female, and had two young ones, 
which followed her, to the great facisfadion of Robin- 
fon, and did not appear to be the leaft afraid of him. 
He patted the pretty little things, and they — juft as if 
they would have begged of him to let their motner go — 
licked his hands. 

Geo. Well, then, I think he might have let her go. 

Mr. BilL He would have been a great fool in do- 
ing (o. 

Geo Nay, the poor creature had done him no harm 
iiowever. 

Mr. Bill. But he had occafion for it ; and you know, 
ms dear George, v/e are permitted to make ufe of ani- 
mals in cule of need, provided wc do not abuiie them. 

Robinfon 



f 4 T H E N E VV 

Robfnfon was tranfported with joy at having fo hap- 
pily attained his ohjeCt. Hqcdragged the creature along 
vviili all his (Irenglh, though he jumped and flcipped a 
good deal to get from him, and the two little ones fol- 
lowed quietly behind. The (horteft way was now the 
beft f( r Robinfon, and, purfuing that, he at length ar- 
rived happily at his dwelling place. 

But here flarted a difficulty. How was he to get the 
lama into his enclofure, which, as we have faid before, 
was fo flrongly barricaded all round ? To fling it down 
from the top of the rock, by means of a cord, was not 
at all advifeable ; the poor animal might be ftrangled in 
the way. Robinfon refolved, therefore to make up a 
little (iable near his place of abode, and there to keep 
the lama and her young ones, until he fhould be able 
to fuit his conveniency better. 

In tlie mean time he faftened the animal to a tree, 
and immediately fell to work ; that is to fay, he cut 
down with his hatchet of flint a number of young trees, 
and fixed them in the ground, fo clofe, one befide the 
other, that they formed a pretty ftro.ng wall. While 
thi? was doing, the lama hy down through wearinefs, 
and the little ones, no way troubled at their bejng pri- 
foners, were fucking quite unconcerned, and feafting 
themfelves at their eafe. 

What a pleafing fight was this to Robinfon! Above 
a dozen times he fropped from his work to look at the 
pretty little creatures, and thought himlcif beyond mea- 
sure happy in having fome animated beings to bear him 
compr.ny. From this moment his life ieemcd no longer 
foiitary, and the joy which he felt from this refledtion, 
gave him fuch firength and a6\ivity, that his fiable was 
very foon hnifbed : he then put the lama and her young 
©nes into it, and clofed up the lad opening with 
branches firmly interwoven. 

What was his fatisfattion now ! It is impolTible for 
words to defcribe it. Befides the company of the lamas, 
which ofitfelf was a valuable thing, he promifed him- 
felfmany other great advantages, and with much rea- 
i'ovi : iOT in time he might perhaps learn to make fome 
Ibrt of cloathiog with the wool of thefe animals ; he 
n.ight uie their milk for food, he might make butter and 

cheeie 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 95 

checfe of ft. It is true, he did not yet know by what 
means lie {hould attain thele ohje^s, which were ftill fo 
far dilUnt ; but he had already experienced that no man 
(toiild defpaJr of his fkill Oi' performance, provided he 
gives his whole mind to the work, anJ applies to it 
with pt^rfevv ring attention. 

Theie wanted ftil! one thing to complete his happi- 
nefs : he wiflied to be in the fame enclufure with his 
dear iamas, that he might have them always before his 
eyes when he was at home, and enjoy the tatisfad^ion of 
feeing them grow fond of his company. 

He puzzled himfelf a long time to find how he (liould 
accompliih this : at length, his determination was to 
break down one fide of his wall of trees, not grudging 
whatever labour it might cofi: him, and to make another 
wall that would take in a large fpace. This alteration, 
befides, would give him more room, and make him more 
at his eafe. But in order to be fecure from all accidents 
while he was working at his new hedge, he prudently 
refolved not to break the old wall until he had finiflied 
the new. 

Thanks to his indefatigable pains, the work was 
finilbed in d fev/ days, and then Robinfon had the fatrf- 
faction of being in the fame habitation with his three do- 
meftic companions. This, however, did not make him 
forget his firft companion, the fpider, v;hich he provid- 
ed every day with gnats aiid fliis. The fpider, foon 
perceiving that he uled her as a friend, grew {o tame, 
that, whenever he touched her web, Ihe would come 
out and receive from his hand the fly that he held to 
her. 

The lama alfo and its young ones foon grew fond of 
his fociety. As often as he returned home, they came 
jumping to meet hin ; they would Imeij about him to 
find whether he had brought them any thing, and grate- 
fully lick his hand whenv.^ver he gave them frclh grafs or 
young branches to car. 

After this he weantd the young one?, and then began 
tomiikthedam regularly morning and evening. His 
cocoa-nut iheils ferved him for pails and miJk pans, 
and this miik, which he ufed partly Ave-^ and 
partly curdled, contribiiicd not a liitle, by its agree- 

abie 



96 T H E N E W 

ahle tafi:e and nourifhing quality, to render his folitary 
life ftill more tolerable. 

As his cocoa-nut tree was iifcful to him in Co many 
refpefts, he was extremely dcfirous to find a method of 
producing more of them. Eut how was he to contrive 
it ? He hrid often heard of grafting trees, but the man- 
ner in which it was done had never excited his curiofity. 
*' Oh," faid he to himfelf, ** how little is the advan- 
tage that I liave reaped from the years of ray childhood, 
when 1 hid time and opportunitj to have learnt fo 
much ! Ah ! if I had known my own intereft better, 
ll:ould I not have taken notice of every thing that I faw 
or heard ? And if my capacity did not allow me to ar- 
rive at the heic^ht of learning vihich many men attain, I 
fliouldat lead have come near it ; and how ufeful would 
every thing that I could have learnt be to me at this 
prefent moment! Oh ! if I could grow young again, 
how attentive would. I be to every thing that is executed 
by the hands or induftry of men ! There is not a trade 
ijcr an art of which I would not have endeavoured to 
learn fome part." 

But of what ufe were thefe wishes ? The misfortune 
was now paft remedy. It was, therefore, his bufinefs 
to exert hinifelf in ilipplying by his oun invention what 
he wanted in (kill j and this, in efFett, was the ccurfe that 
he took. 

Without knowing Vv'hethcr he was right or wrorg, he 
cut off the tops of two or three youn^ trees; in the 
middle of the trunk he made a fmall (lit, in which he 
flruck a young twig from the cocoa-nut tree; he then 
covered round with thin irark the place where he had 
made the flic, and waited with impatience for the ref'jlt 
of his labour. This, too, fuccecded with him. After 
fome time the fuckers began to bud, and now he had 
found a miethcd to produce a whole grove of cocoa-nut 
trees. 

Here was a- frefh caufe fo-- rejoicing, and for enter- 
taining the moll lively gratitude towards our Creator, 
v/ho has implanted in the narure of things fuch virtues 
and qualities, that living creatures are no where in want 
of means tf preferve thunfelves, and render their coii- 



a.'ioii agreeable. 



Both 



i 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 97 

Both the old lama and the young were in a fhort time 
grown as tame as dogs. He .began, therefore, by little 
and little, as occafion required, to make them ferve for 
carrying burthens, efpecially whenever he went out for 
any thing that would have been too much trouble for 
himfelf to carry. 

Rich. Ay ; but how could he take them with him 
when there was no way for them to go out of the en- 
clofure ? 

Mr. Bill. I forgot to tell you, that, in the new wall, 
at a part where it touched a dole thicket, he had left 
an opening where a lama could barely fqueeze itfelf 
out. This hole was not to be feen from without, and 
every evening Robinfon clofed it up with branches 
ftrongly interwoven together. 

It was delightful to fee Robinfon coming home to his 
habitation, and his lama walking before him. She was 
foon able to find the way as well as her mafter, and 
xvhen (he came to the little door Ihe flopped firft to be 
unloaded, and then crept in upon her beilvj Robinfon 
following by the fame pHiTagc, Then was the joy of 
the young lamas complete ; they exprefied their fatif- 
f3<5lion by jumping and bleating, and would run firtl to 
their mother to welcome her home, then to their mailer 
to carefs him alfo. Robinfon, on fuch occaiions, would 
mix his joy with theirs, as a father rejoices over his 
children when he clafps them in his arras once moreaftei" 
an abfence of feme time. 

Mr. Rcfe. \z mull be confefTed, there is foraething 
very inuruftive, and affeiSting in this gratitude of ani- 
mals towards a man who has done them a kindnefs. 

Mr. hill. There are fevcral examples of it which are 
extremely firiking, and would almoil induce us £0 believe 
that feme beafts are really endued viith thought like 
men, if we had .'ict, on the other hand, proofs of the 
contrary. 

Hfury. Ay i for inflance, the Hon and the man men- 
tioned in the Spectato;^, and in bANDfOiiD and 
Me R. TON — what was che man's name i 
Rich. Androcies. 

Henry. The fame. He had plucked a thorn out 
ihe lion's piw. 



95 T H E N E W 

Cro. There was a good Hon! lie was fo fond of 
i^ndrocles, who had done him that fervice ; that ever 
after, in return, he did the man no harm when he had 
it in his power to devour him. If they were all like 
him, 1 fliould like to have a lion myfelf. 

Rich. For my part, I like much better the dog that 
belonged to a Swifs. 

Harriet. What dog ? 

/\/V/'. Have you forgot him? The dog that favcd the 
lives of two men. 

Harriet. Dear Richard, tell us that ftory. 

Rich. There was once a man in Switzerland, where 
thofe high mountains the Alps are. Well, the man 
climbed up to the top of one of them, which was pro- 
digious high ; Oh, it was as high, as high — as if you 
were to put St. Paul's upon itfelf ten times over. 

Geo. You leave out one thing, brother; he took a 
guide with him. 

Rich, Certainly, he took a guide — well, and the 
guide took his dog. Now, when they had reached the 
top of the mountain 

Gl'O. Yes, and the mountain was covered with 
fnow 

Rich. Pray hold your tongue — [ — Well, then, the 
mountain was covered with fnow. Now, when they 
were almoft at the top, the gentleman flipped, and the 
guide going to his aliiftance flipped too, and fo then 
they both flipped and Aid until they were within a f.^w 
yards of the edge of the precipice, from which they 
would have fallen down almofl: a little before they 
touched the bottom. But then the good dog feized his 
mafter by the Ikirt of his coat, and held him fafl:, fo 
that he could not flip any t'arther, and he held the gen- 
tleman until they both got up. 

Geo. Well, now you mufl: tell us what the gentle- 
man faid; I have not forgot it. 

Rich, Nor I neither. He invited the guide to come 
and fee him as often as he pleaftd to his houfe, and 
charged him never upon any account to forget bringing 
his dog, as he intended, whenever he came, to give 
him a good belly- full. 

Harriet. 



R O B I N S^ N CRUSOE. 99 

Harriet. And did the gentleman do fo ? 

Rich. Yes, cert.iinlv : as often as the guide vifited 
him, he entertained him in the beft manner he could, 
and was always fure to give the dog a full belly. 

Harriet. That was well done. 

Mr. Bill. Well, my dear children, we have loil fight 
of Robinfon. Shjll we fiop here for this evening ? 

Geo, Oh, dear papa, no. A little more of Robinfon, 
let it be ever i'o little. 

Mr. Bill. By ti;is time his bricks were hard enough 
to be ufed. He looked, therefore, tor ibme chalky 
earth, with which, infleid of lime, he intended to 
make mortar for his wall ; and he found fome. In the 
next place, lie made himfelf a trowel oi" a fint ftone, 
and, b^ing refolved to have every thing complete that 
belongs to a bricklayer, he went lb far a;' even to make 
a fquare and a plummet, but not in a bungling manner ; 
as perfed as poliible. You know, I fuppofe, what 
thofc things arc ? 

Ed^. Oh, as to that matter, we have feen them 
pretty often. 

Mr. Bill. Having, therefore finil}:ed all the prepara- 
tives neceffary for his maibnry, he made his lama bring 
home the bricks that- he had occafion for, 

Riih, But how was he.able to put the 'bricks upoit 
the lama? 

Mr. Bill, Why, indeed you would not eafily gueff 
how he cantfived it, therefore 1 think it befi; to tell you 
at once. 

He had long obferved that it would be a, ver-" great 
advantage to him to know foaiething of the ufeful art of 
weaving wicker panniers ; but he had taken Jo lirle no- 
tice in his youth of the manner in which ba.fker -makers 
work^ that he knew as much of this art, which, never- 
theltfs, is tolerably eal"y,*as he did of all the other ufeful 
arts, that is to fay, he knew nothing abopt it. 

However, as he had once fucce^ed in making an 
umbrella by this fort of weaving, he frequenth after- 
wards araufcd himfelf in his leifure hours with trials of 
the fame kind, by dint of which he difcovered at length 
the uhole myflery of the art, fo as to be stbTe to make 
ct[j eight pannier. Two of thefc he had woven on 

£ i DU-Oofc 



loo T H E N E W 

purp fe for Ms lama to carry. He faftened them toge- 
ther vviih a ftriiifT, and laid them upon the lama in fuch 
a manner that they hung down one on each fide. 

G(fj. Oh, papa ! I (hould like to learn ba(ket-making. 

A/r. RilU Well, then, 1 will fpeak to a bafket-makcr, 
the firft time I meet one, to come here and give you 
fome leflbns. 

Geo. Oh, that will be charming? And then I will 
make a beautiful little work baflcet for Harriet. 

H.in-iet, And I will learn to make them too, papa, 
(han't I ? 

Mr. Bill. By all means ; It can do you no harm. In 
efFefl, we fometimes have an idle hour upon our hands, 
when this bafket-making would come in quite feafon- 
ably. 

Robinfon then fell to his bricklaying, in which he 
fucceeded tolerably well. He had now built up one of 
the fide walls of his kitchen, and laid the foundation of 
the other, v;hcn all of a fudden there happened fome- 
thing which he had never dreamt of, and which terribly 
difappointed all his plans. 

Rich. 1 wonder what that accident was. 

Harriet. Qh ! I know it. The favagea came and 
ate him up. 

Gee. Mercy on us ! was It that, papa ? 

Mr. Bill. No, it was not that. But it was fomethlng 
that frightened him almoft as much as if the favages were 
come to road him alive. 

Mich, Dear me ! what was it? 

Mr. Bill, It was night, and Robinfon on his bed of 
hay flept foundlj, with his lamas at his feet. The 
moon flbone out in all its fplendor, the a'r was clear 
and calm, and a profound filence reigned over all nature. 
Robinfon, fatigued with the toils of the day, was fallen 
into a fweet flumber, and dreaming, as ufual, of his 

dear parents, when fuddenly but let us net clofe 

th'S evening's entertainment v^ith an event fo full of 
terror; we might, perhaps, dream of it, and have our 
Heep difturbed. Rather let us turn our thoughts to 
fomething more agreeable, that we may end the day in 
joy and gratitude to our good Father who is in Heaven. 

NINTH' 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. ioi 



NINTH EVENING. 



MR. BILLINGSLEY having brought the hiAory 
of the New Robinson Ci^ usoe down to the 
end of the preceding evening, it now happened that 
bufinefs indilpenfabiy called hisn away for fevera! even- 
ings fuccellively, and prevented him from refuming the 
flory, much to the drfappointment of his young fa- 
mily. 

They were quite impatient to know what this was 
that had happened to poor Robinfon, and they v/Culd" 
any of them have given their favourite play.hing to be 
informed of the events of tiiat dreadful ni'.;nt, concern- 
ing which Mr. Billingfley had fo long kept fiience. Un- 
fortunately, it was not in the power of any other perfon 
but tlieir father to inform them, and he thought proper to 
fay nothing of it until he fbould have time to continue 
the ftory regularly as ufual. 

Their conjectures wert endlefs, and only ferved to 
puzzle them more and more. One guefTed this thing, 
another that ; but none of their guelfes agreed entirely 
with the circumllatices which they already knew of this 
myfterious adventure. 

" But why fl-oiild we not know the whole r" faid 
fome of them, in a very piteous tone. 

" I have my reafons," anfwered their father. 

The children were, by a prudent education, accuf- 
tomed to be facished with this anfwer, and therefore 
preiTed no farther, but with a guarded impatience for the 
moment "when the caufe of their father's fiience Ihould 
no longer exift. Mean t^me, as it is eify for a grown- 
up perfon to read the thoughts of children, Mr. Bil- 
lingfley could clearly perceive what paPfed in their 
minds. The following refiedion was written, as it 
were, upon the forehead of, each of them : **Why 
does our papa refufe us this fatisfaCtion ? What reafons 
can he have for not gratifying our curiofity ?" He 
thought proper, therefore, upon diis occafion, to con- 
\ince them once more that he did not v/ant the inclina- 
E 5 tioa 



ic^ T II E i\ K W 

tfon to make them as happy as lay in liis power, and to 
fliew them that he Iiad rcalbns of importance for not 
continuin the ftory. 

*' Prepare yourfelves/' faid he, '' to fet off to-mor- 
row morning very early en a party down the river for 
Greenwich. You have often wifiied to fee it, and to- 
morrow I propofe to indulge you." 

*' Down the river ? — To Greenwich ? — In a l)oat ? — 
What I, papa?— Shall I go ?— And I ?" art;ed all the 
children with one voice ; and a general *' i'tj" having 
iatisfied all their quellions, they ran, quite tranlported 
with joy, to communicate the news to their mama, and 
10 make the neceffary preparations for their voyage. 

** To Greenwich! to Greenwich! V7here are my 
half- boots ? Jenny, where are my gloves ? Quick ! rhe 
brufl) ! the comb \ We are going to Greenwich ! Quick ! 
quick !" Nothing was to be heard all over the houfe, 
but thefe expreilions of joy and impatience. 

Every thing, therefore, was prepared for the next 
<;ay*3 party ; and the young travellers, in the fulnefs of 
their joy, jilked a thouf^nd qiieftions, without waiting 
for a dnglQ anfwer. They v/ere, at length, however, 
prevailed on to go to bed 'or that nighr, their irrTpsti- 
t-nce being fo great, that they v;ere already wiHiing for 
the mornjpg to ict out on their jburnoy. 

At length the morning appeared, and the whole houfe 
was in niotion. Nothing was h^p^rd bat knocking at 
c-.ich other's bed rooms ; Co that they were ali very icon 
obliged to rife :^nd diefG themfeives. 

,Wh.en the whole party, oid and young, were afTeni- 
led, arid the former were almoft devoured with ca- 
rtiies by the latter ; Mr. Biiiingfley rubbed his eyes, 
and i'n a tone of, voice which breathed mod ibrrov^^ful 
-difccrd to the accents of univerfal joy, he faid ** My 
dear children, if you would do me a favour, you would 
excufe me to-riavfrom perfurmin^ my promile.*'. 

** What promiJe ?^ what promife r" — and each mouth 
that afked this quefiion remained open in anxious ex- 
pectioon, accompinicd with a fort of fright. •

The adionifliment and confufion of the younger part 
-of the company was comolete. Not one could utter a 
liable. 

Mr. Bill. I have been thinking Jaft night that we 
(bould do wrong to <^o on this party to day. 

7he Clildrcn. Why fo,- papa? and they could 

hardly fpeak for fobs. 

Mr. Bill, \ will tell yo-j, and then leave it to your- 
felves to judge. In the firil place, we have h-.d, for 
fome time pau, aneafterly wind (and, 1 find, it is in the 
fame point this morninj^), which makes the river ex- 
tremely rough, anci mull be very dil'agreeable to a p^rty 
that are going duv.n. 

The Chiluren. But, papa, the wind may change ni'L 

Mr. Bill. Eefidfcs, 1 coniideied, that, if we were to 
, {lop another month, we fhould lee many of the E;i(l In- 
dia fliips, that are to fail this }ear, dropping down to 
Deptford ; and I know two or three captains of them ; 
we might perhaps, dine aboard of one, Vv'hich would 
be very agreeable — would it not ? 

The Chiluren. Yes, papa — but 

Mr. Bill. But I have dill a ftronger reafon. You 
know, Charles and Arthur Stanfield, your firft Coufins, 
■whom you have never feen yet, are to come out ofChe- 
(hire (hortly, and fpend a month* v*7it.h us j would it not 
be infinitely better to wait for their coming, and take 
them with us ? Would they not, as often as we fhould 
fpeak to them of the agreeablenefs of our party, figh 
and wifti that they had been there too ? And, in that 
cafe, would the remen^brance of our day's pleafure caufe 
much fatisfiftion ? No; certainly not. On the con- 
trary, we (hould always be forry within ourfelves, that 
we had not done by them as we could v/ifn them to do 
with regard to us, weie v/e actually in their place and 
they in ours. Therefore, what fay you ? 
A profound filence. 

Mr. B;llir.yjl'^y gcei On. You know, I never broke my 
word with you •, lb that, if you infill upon it, we {hall 
let off. But ifyou would, of your own accord, acquit me 
of my promile, you would do me a kindnefs ; and you 
would do your coufins a kindnefs, and yourselves. 
Therefore fpeak — What is to be done ?

** We will wait," was the anfwer ; and, confequent- 
Iv, the fine party of pleafure was put off till another 

tiinc. 

It was eafy to be fcen that this vi\5^ory over thcrnfelves 
had colt fon^e of them dear: thefe v/ere far from being 
as chearful as ufual the rcfl of the day. Mr. BillingOej 
took occafion, therefore, towards evening, when thej 
were all aflemblcd, to ipeak to them in this manner: 

** My dear children, what has happened to you to- 
day, will happen to you frequently in the courfc of your 
lives. You will expect to enjoy this or that earthly ad- 
vantage ; your hopes will appear as well founded as 
poTible, and you will burn with impatience to realize 
[ :em ; but, in the very moment v/hen you think to 
touch this long-expe6ted happinei's. Divine Providence, 
which is fupremely wife, will, in an inftant, difappoint 
■ .'ur-deHgns, v/hen you fliall lead exped it ; and thus 
. ?u will hnd your too languine hopes many, many a 
iiiefadly fruftrated. 

** The realbns which yourTieavenly Father will have 
to "^tt thus vvith you, will feidom apj)ear to you fo 
clearly and diuincljy as you hd\c het^rd my reafons this 
morning for pu'tting^ oh our party to Greenwich : for 
God, being infinitely wife, looks to the mofi re;note fu- 
turity ; and often, for our advantage, futfers things to 
happen/the good elFetls of which we do not experience 
until long after, perhaps <;ven in another world. 

*' Now, if every thing were co happen perfe^Stly to 
your vviih vvhile you are young, and if you always ob- 
tained, at the exact moment, whatever v/as the object 
of your hopes, 04 ! my dears, how much the worfe 
would it be for you during the remainder of your lives ! 
JioT7 would your hearts be corrupted by luch profperi- 
ty; and how unhappy would your alfections, thus cor- 
rupted, make you at a time when things ihould not go 
quite to your liking! And fuch a tinue will come, my 
dears ; it will con>e as certainly for you as U comes tor 
all other men; for hitherto there has never been a man 
in the world, who could fay that things have always 
lucceeded with him cojriplecely, and according to the 
fulncjs of his wiiLcs. 

"In 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 105 

** In this cafe, t>.en, v/hat are we to do, my dear 
children? — No more than this; accuftom yourfelves, 
while you are young, tt) deprive yourfclves frequently of 
a plealure which you would ha", e given the world to en- 
joy. This victory over yourfelves, often repeated, will 
ftrengthen your underllandings and }our affeflions in 
fuch fort, tint for the future, you will be able to fup- 
port, with undiaken fortitude, whatever a wife and be- 
nevolent God lliall appoint for your good. 

** ^hat I have laid, will teach you, my dear child- 
ren, to interpret many inftances of our behaviour, which 
to you appear unaccountable, and which we, who are 
advanced in years, commonly adopt with regard to you. 
You have, no doubt, often been furprifed at our re- 
fufing you a gratification for which, perhaps, you longed 
ardently. Sometimes we have told you the reafons of 
our refufal ; that is, when jou were capable of under- 
franding them : and foraetimes, on the other hand, we 
have not told you them; for inftance, when you were 
too young to be able to underftand them. And why- 
did we do fo? Often merely on purpole to Qxercife your 
patience and modera;ion, virtues lb necelfary to all men, 
and- to prepare you for the fubfequent accidents of your 
lives. 

*' You know now, alfo, why, for thefefew days pail, 
I have forborne the recital of Robinfon Crufoe's Hif- 
tory. ''I might certainly have found, at lead:, fuiiicient . 
time to clear up to you the adventure with which I left 
-oft'", and. concerning which you have been, ever fince, 
in ff difagreeable uncertainty : but, you fee, I did not 
tell you another word about it, though you frequently 
afked me, and it is always againft my will that i refute 
you any thing. Now, why did I do thus, Harriet ?'* 

Harriet. Becaufe, papa, you had a mind to teach us 
patience. 

Mr; Bill, Very right ! And m.oft certainly, if ever 
you have caufe to thank me for any thing, it'will be for 
accufroming yoii thus to give up v/ithout regret any 
thing of which you hive before ardently delired the 
pofreifion. ' , m 

A few days more pafied without any talk of going on 

with the ftory of Robinfoa-Crufoe ; but, at len^ih, the

hour Co earnertly longed for arrived, when Mr. Billingf- 
ley was no longer prevented by hullnefs or ofherwilc 
from latisfying the general wifli. He went on, therefore, 
without interruption, in thele words: 

It was night, as I told you at n\y leaving off, and 
Robinf'ip was quietly (Iretched on his bed of dry grafs, 
with his faithful lamas at his feet. A deep calm over- 
rpread all the face of nature, and Kobinfon, according to 
biscuftom, was dreaming of his parents, when, all at 
once, the earth (hook in an uncommon manner, and a 
rumb ing noife was heard, together with dreadful cracks, 
as if fivmy ftonns burft forth all at once. Robinfon 
ftarted up in a fn^hr, and jumped out of bed without 
Jcnowing what was the matter, nor where he was going. 
At this moment happened a dreadful (hock of the earth, 
which was fucceedcd by feveral others equally violent. 
1'he rumbling noife alio continued, which fecmed to 
con.t from underground. At the fame time arofe a fu- 
rious hurricane, v/hich tore up trees, and even rocks, and 
agitated tlie very depths of the roaring fea. All the ele- 
ments feemed to be a: war with each other, and aature to 
approach her final diirolution. 

Robinfon, almoft frantic with terror, ran out of his 
cave into the fpace before it, and the frighted lamas fol- 
lowed. Scarce v/ere they out, Vv'hen a piece of the rock, 
which relied over the cave, fell down upon the bed 
which Robinfon had juil feft. Fear, now, lent him 
wings; he fled with precipitation through the fraall 
opening in his wall of trees, and the lamas, no lefs ter- 
rified, w'ere clofe at his heels. 

His firft intention was to fecure himfelf upon a neigh- 
bouring mountain, on the top of which was a plain per- 
fectly open, that he might not be in danger of the falling 
trees. He v,'as going to run thither, when fuddenly he 
beheld, to his infinite terror and (urprife, that very fame 
fpot of the mountain open with a huge gap, and vomit 
forth fmoke, fire, cinders, Aones, and a burning ftream of 
what 13 called ia-va. He could fcarcejy icll which way 
to run from this dreadful eruption, as the burning lava 
rolled down the hill like a river, and great fragments of 
rock were hiirled itito the air, in every diredion, and 
fell as " ■ hail. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 107 

He ran towards the fea-fide; but here he beheld a 
new fcene no lefs terrible. A dreadful whirlwind, 
which blew from all quarters of the fl<y, had driven to- 
gether a large quantity of clouds, and heaped them, as 
it were, one upon the other. Their own weight burft 
them at length, and the confequence was fuch a deluge of 
rain, as, in a moment, laid the whole country under 
water. 

Robinfon faved himfelf with difficulty by climbing 
npatree; but his poor lamas were carried off by the 
violence of the flood. Ah ! how it went to his heart to 
hear their plaintive bleating; and how willingly would 
be, at the riik of his own life, have endeavoured to fave 
them, but that the rapidity of the torrent had already 
carried them far beyond his reach ! 

The earth continued to fl:ake fxill for a few minutes, 
after which there fell, all at once, a dead calm. The 
winds fubfided ; the opening of the mountain ceafed by 
degrees to vomit fire ; the rumbling under ground was 
heard no more; the flcy cleared up, and all the waters 
ran oiF in lei's than a quarter of an hour. 

Geo. (fighing heazily ) Ah ! thank God, it is all over ! 
Poor Robinfon and the poor lamas ! 

Ha>riet, For my part, I was terribly frightened. 

Charlotte. What occafions thc-fe earthquakes, papa ? 

Rich. Papa has explained that to us long ago, but you 
were not here. 

Mr. Bill, Tell her, Richard. 

Rich. There are a number of great holes under the 
Cirrh, like caverns, and thefe are filled with air and ex- 
halaticnf. Beildes, there are within the earth all manner 
of things that eafily take fire, as fulphur, pitch, nitre, and 
the like. Thele begin fometimcs to heat and take tire, 
when moillure happens to accompany them. 

Geo. Moillure ? Can wetneis, then, occafion any 
thing to take fire ? 

Rich. Certainly. Have you never feen, whenmafons 
throw cold v/ater upon burnt lime-ilones, how they 
begin immediately to boil and fmoke as if they were 
Upon the fire, and yet there was no fire nf&r them ? 
Well, in the fame manner things take fire un^ ground 
.3 ibon as water penetrates to them j and th^ji^ when 

ihey 



loS THE NEW 

they burn, tbe air which Is in thc<e great caverns ex- 
pands to prodi^ioully that there is no longer room to 
contain it, lb that firiving forcibly to find a pafTage out, 
it fl'akes the earth, until, at length, it makes an opening 
Jbmeu'herc, and tlirough this opining it comes forth like 
a hurricane, drawing with" it a quantity of burning and 
melted matter. 

Mrs. Hill. And this matter, which conflds of flones, 
mineral?, and un6tuous bodies, all melted together, is 
vhat we call lava. I have ibmewhere read that a man 
might make a little mountain for himfelf that would vo- 
mit fire. If you fhould like that, we will make the ex- 
periment fome day. 

7he Lhildren. Oh, yes, by all means, dear papa. 

Rich, And how is that done ? 

Mr, Bill. You need only dig a hole in the ground 
where it is moift, and put into it fome iblphur and filings 
of iron. This mixture will heat and take fire ofitlelf, 
and then you have a burning mountain in miniature. 
We will make a trial of it the firll: idle day. 

While Robinfbn was coming down from the tree on 
vhich he had faved himfelf^ his n.ind was fb deprelled ' 
with the calamity which had jufh fallen on him, that be 
never once thousrht of thanking for his frelh deliverance 
that Being who had before, more than once, preierved 
him when in the moil im.minent danger of perilhing. His 
fituation was, indeed, now, to the full as miferable as 
ever it had been. His cave, the only place of refuge 
that he had hitherto found, was in all probability, a 
heap of ruins ; his dear and faitli'^'ul lamas he had {'ten 
with his own eyes, carried off by the flood, and without 
doubt they mud have perifl^ed ; all his pair labours were 
demoliflifcd, and his plans for the f'lture difappointed .' 
The m.ountain, it is true, had cealed 'to throw up fire, 
but from the gulph, which was frill open on the top of 
it, there iiTued forth a, thick black fmoke, and it was 
very pollible that this mountain might now continue to 
be always a volcano. In that cafe, how was Robinlbn 
to enjoy one moment's fecurity ? Might he not realon- 
a'.ly dread a frefh earthquake, or a freib eruption, every 
day? 

Tl^efe melancholy ideas completely overpowered 
him. 'He funk under the vv eight of his milerits, and, in- 

lUad 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 109 

ftead of turning hinnfelf towards God, the only fource of 
true conf'olation, he thought ofnothing but his future 
mifery, which appeared to him infinite both in weight 
and duration. 

Exhaufted with anguilh and difcomfort, he leaned 
againft the tree, and, from his pained breafr, he uttered 
fighs, or rather deep groan?, of diftrefs. He remained 
in this pofition, the pi6lure of defpair, until the dawn 
told the approach of day. 

Geo. (to Mr. Meredith). I fee now that my papa was 
right. 

Mr. Mered. In what ? 

Geo. I was thinking lately that Robinfon was altoge- 
ther reformed, and that Providence might fafely order 
things for his deliverance from the ifland ; but in anfwer 
to that my papa obferved, that our heavenly Father 
knew every thing bed, and that it was not for us to 
judge in fuch cafes. 

Mr. Mered. And now ? 

Geo. Why, now I fee plainly that he had not the con- 
fidence in his Maker which he ought to have had, and, 
therefore, that God did well in not delivering bim yet. 

Eciix'. So 1 think too. 1 mufl: own, 1 am far from 
liking him now fo well as I did fome time ago. 

Mr. Bill. Your obfervation, my dear children, is per- 
fe(5tly juft. It is true, we fee plainly that Rol.>infan has 
not that firm, unalterable filial confidence in his Makt-r 
which he naturally ought to have after fo many proofs 
of his wifdom andgoodnels as he had experienced j but, 
before we condemn him on this head, let us firftputour- 
lelves in his place for a moment, and alk our own hearts 
if we (hould have adted better under i\ie fame circum- 
ftances. What think you, Edward? If you had been 
Robinfon, would you have had more courage than hit ? 

Edx'j. ( hejhating.) I Can't iay, 

Mr. r-iil. Recoiled: the time when you had fore eyes, 
and we put blifiers behind your ears. Do you remer.i- 
ber \xo\w difpirited }ou Vv'ere at times ? And yet it Vv-as 
but a (Lort-iivcd pain ; it lafied but two days. 1 know, 
indeed, that you have more ftnfe now, and would bear 
the pain better ; but could you alfo bear v^ith fi:ial fub- 
niilTiori every thing that Robinfon was forced to under- 
go? 



no T H E N E W 

^0 ? — VVIiat think yon, my dear? Have I rot fome rea- 
Ibn for doubtincj upon that fcorc- ? 

Your filence is the bell anfwer to my queflion. As, 
thank Heaven, you have never been in a fitnation like 
that of our poor friend Robinfon, you cannot tell what 
would be your fentimentsif you were; there-fore, all that 
we can do at prcfcnt is to accuAom ourfeh es, in the 
flight misfortunes which we perhaps mull: experience, to 
turn our eyes towards Heaven, and be ever patient and 
full of confidence. Our hearts will then be more and 
more firengthened every day, fo as to bear with due re- 
signation even the grcatcft fufferings, if our heavenly Fa- 
ther fiiall think proper to appoint them to us. 

At length the day appeared, and its new-born light, 
while it fpread joy over all nature, found poor Robinfon 
ftill leaning ag.infl the tree, in a (ituation truly deplo- 
rable. Sleep had never clofed his eyelids; one gloomy 
thought alone abforbed his whole foul ; he had a(ked 
himiVlf a thoufand times the forrowful quefiion, ** What 
will become of me?" At length he Ttt himfelf in mo- 
tion, and daggering as he walked, like a man who is 
half afieep, he arrived, after fome time, at the ruins of 
his habitation. Bat what joyful emotions feized his 
breaft, v.'hen, all at once, as he came up towards the 
willow enclofure— what think you ? — his dear lamas, 
fife and found, came jumping to m.eel him ! At firft he 
could not believe his eyes, but his doubts were foon fa- 
• tished. The lamas ran up to him, licked his hands, 
and exprelled their joy at Iceing him again by bleating 
and i"kipping about. 

Rubinlon's heart, which, until that moment, had 
feem.ed infenfible and frozen, was nov/ awakened. He 
looked at his lamas, then up to Fieaven ; and tears of 
joy, gratitude, and repentance for his want o- faith, be- 
dewed his cheeks. He now patted and careiled his old 
friends a thoufand times, and, accompanied by them, 
went to fee what was become of his liabitation. 

Henry. But how were the lamas faved ? 

Mr. BilU We m.ay fuppofe that the flood had carried 
them to fome riling ground where the vvateis were n^ ; 

qui.. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. in 

quite fo deep, and as they ran off afterwards as rapidly 
as they had fallen from the clouds, the lamas were very 
foon able to return to their habitation. 

Robinfon then flood in the front of his cave, and, to 
add to his confufion, found the damage here alfo by no 
means fo confiderable as, in the height of his defpon- 
dency, he had imagined it. The cieling, which confid- 
ed of one piece of rock, had, it is true, tumbled down, 
and in its fall brought fome of the neareft earth along 
with it ; yet, after all, it appeared not impollible to 
clear the cave of thefe ruins, and then his dwelling- 
place became tv;ice as fpacious and convenient as it was 
before. 

To this mud: he added another circuraflance, which 
plainly demonftrated that Divine Providence had ordered 
events thus, not to punifh Robinfon, but rather exprelT- 
ly for his prefervation : for when he had more clofely 
examined the fpot where the pieces of rock had been fuf- 
pended, he, to his no fmali terror, perceived it to be 
iurrounded on every fide by a foft earth, and, confe- 
quently, that it could never have been firmly placed; 
it was, therefore, likely enough to fall down by its own 
weight fooncr or later. Now this Divine Providence 
forefaw, and perhaps, moreover, forefaw that the piece 
of rock, would fall precifcly at a time when Robinion 
was in the cave. But, as the all wife and good Creator 
had appointed to this man a longer life, he had, from the 
creation of the world, fo formed the earth, that exactly 
at that time, and in that illand, there (hould be fuch an 
earthquake. Even the rumbling noile under ground, 
and the roaring of the hurricane, how terrible foever 
they had founded in the ears of Robinfon, werecircum- 
llances that contributed to lave him ; tor, had the earth- 
quake come on without any noife, Robinfon, in all like- 
lihood, would not have awakened, and then the fall 
of the rock v/ould certainly have put an end to his 
lil^. 

Thus, my children. Heaven took care of him at a 
time when he thought himfelf forfaken, and even made 
thefe dreadful accidents, which Robinfon looked upon 

as 



M2 T H E N li W 

s his grcateft niisfortunc, contribute wholly to his pre- 
fcrvation. 

This happy experience of hravenly mercy you will 
have frequent opportunities of gaining, if you v/ifh to 
remarl: the ways by which Providence will conduct you. 
In all the unfortunate fituations of life which it may be 
your lot to fall into, you will find thefe two things 'ever 
true; namely. 

In the firft place, men always rcprefent to themfclves 
the evil which happens as greater than it really is.

TENTH E V E N I N G. 



J[yfR. BIL LINGS LE T goes cn.-^Rohlni'on, who 
for fome time paft had u fed the cufrom ofjoir.ing 
prayer v^iih his labour, began by throwing himftlf oa 
his knees to thank God for his l^te deliverance; after 
v/hich he chearfully fet about his work, which was to 
clear his cave of the ruins. It was but a flig/it tafk to 
remove the earth and gravel, but there remained ftill the 
great piece of rock, which had been under all. It is true, 
it was broken in two ; but even in this flateit feemed 
to require more than the ilrength of one man to dif- 
IcJge it. 

He tried to roll out the fmalleft of the tv/o piece?, 
but in vain : the tafk was too much for his Rrength- An 
attempt fo far from fucceeding dii'couraged him once 
iKoie. He did not know what to try next. 

K:c/r. Oh, 1 know what I fiiouidhave done. 

Mr. hilL What ? 

Rkb, 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 113 

Rich. I would have made a lever, or a crow, fiich as 
the men had the other day when, they rolled a great 
beam into the barn-yard. 

Geo. I was not by then. What is a lever, or a crow, 
as you call it ? 

Rich. It is a long ftout pole ; one end they put un- 
der the beam or the ftone that they wifli to move, and ' 
then they place a little block or ftone under the lever, 
but as cloie as poflible to the beam or whatever q\^q is 
to be rolled along ; then la} ing their hands on the 
other end of the lever, which they prefs with all their 
force upon the block, the beam is thus raifed up, and 
may be rolled without much trouble. 

Mr, Bill. 1 will explain to you the reafon of that 
another time : at prefent liften and hear what Robin- 
ion did. 

After having meditated i3pon the matter a long time 
to no purpole, the idea of the lever ftruck, him too at 
laft. He recolk6led that when he was young he had 
fometimcs leen workmen make ufe of this inllrument 
when they wanted to move very heavy tbads, and he 
haftened to make a trial of it. 

This fucceeded. In half an hour he rolled the two 
pieces of (lone quite out o^theca^e, which four men 
with their hands alone could not have ftirred from their 
pLices ; and then he had the (atisfadlion of feeing his 
dv^-elling twice as fpacious as before, and, what was of 
infinitely more conlequence, quite fecure as far as the 
eye could examine: for now both the walls and the 
cieling confided ofone hollow rock, in which there could 
r.o where be difcovered the fmalleft crack. 

Edv,'. But, papi, what was become of his fpider? 

Mr. Bill. 1 am glad you put me in mind of it. Poor 
fpider! I had almoft forgot it. But, in truth, I can tell 
you nothing about it, unlels that, according to all ap- 
pearance, it was buried under the ruins of the cieling; 
at lead, Robinfon never faw it again : however, his other 
friends, the lamas, made him amends for ifs lols. 

He nov/ ventured to turn his fieps towards the vol- 
cano, from which a black Imoke llili continued to rife. 
He was aftoniibed at the quantity of melted matter that 
had run from it on all fides \ part of which was not cold 



114 T H E N E W 

yet. For this time, therefore, he only admired, at a 
diilance, the grand, but dreadful fight of the finoaking 
gulf, hecaule fear, and the lava, which was dill too hot, 
hindere'd him from approaching nearer. 

Having remarke.l that the principal flream of lava 
had taken i:s courfe towards the fpot where his pota- 
toes grew, he was much terrified at the idea that this 
torrent of fire miglit, perhaps have laid wafle the whole ] 
place; nor could he be eafy until he fatisfied himlelt* " 
on this head. He went, therefore, to the fpot, and 
found, to his great joy, the whole plantation fafe and 
found. From that moment, he refolved, at all hazards, 
to phnt potatoes in many different parts cf this idand, 
in order to prevent the misfortune of feeing himfelf de- 
prived of fo admirable a ftuit by ibme unlucky accident 
or other. It is true, winter, according to his reckoning, 
was now jufl: at hand; ** but," faid he to himfelf, 
** who knows v/hether thefe plants are not of the fort 
that will ftand the winter?" 

Having put this defign into execution, he began again 
to work upon his kitchen. Here alfo the terrible con- 
vulfion of nature which had jufl: happened, was the 
rneans of procuring him a great advantage ; for, you 
muft know, that the burning mountain had, amongft 
other things, thrown up a confiderable quantity of lime- 
Hones. Thefe are commonly burnt in a kiln before 
lime can be made' of them ; but here that was not necef- 
fary, for the burning mountain had already been as good 
as a lime kiln to them. 

Robi.nfon, therefore, had only to gather a fmall heap 
of thefe ftones, to throw water upon them, and then to 
ftir the heap well about. Thus the lime was flaked, 
and made proper for the mafon's ufe. He then mixed 
with it a little land, fell to work immediately, and had 
reafbn to be p leafed with h''s own clevernefs. 

In the mean time, the mountain had ceafed fmoking, 
and Robinfon ventured to approach the gulf. Hefound 
the fides and the bottom covered with cold lava ; and 
as he could not perceive the leafl: fmoke come out any 
where, he had reafon to hope that tht fubterraneous fire 
was entirely extinguiihcd, and that, for the future, he 
tiOLiId have no eruptions to dread. 

This, 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 115 

This hope having given him frefli ftrength and fpirits, 
he turned his thoughts towards laying in a ftore of pro- 
vifions againfl: the winter. With this intent he caught, 
one after another, eight lamas, in the fame manner as he 
had caught the firft. All thefe he killed, except one 
ram, which he kept alive to be company for his three 
tame lamas; and he hungup the greated part of the 
flefh in his kitchen to fmoke. But nrtl he had let it h'e 
fomedays in fair, becaufe he had remembered to have 
{een his mother do fo at home, when fhe made bacon. 

Here was a pretty good ftock of provifions ; yet ftill 
he dreaded left he fhould fall Ihort if the winter was fe- 
vere and lafted long. For this reafon, he would have 
taken more lamas, but he found this method would no 
longer anfwer ; for the creatures had, at length, taken 
notice of his manner of noofing them, and were, there- 
fore, on their guard : (o that he was obliged to invent 
lome new way of taking them. 

This way he loon found : fo inexhauftibic are thQ.re- 
fources o- the humun mind, if properly exerted, in pro- 
viding for its wants, and encreafing its happinefs. He 
had obferved that the lamas, wlienever they perceived 
him near the fpring, ran fwiftly' towards a neighbouring 
cop'ce, in their way to which they paifed over a little 
hill. The farther fide of this hill was hedged as it were, 
with fmall thickets 5 and clofe behind this hedge there 
was a deicent as f^eep as a wall, and about a couple of 
yards deep. The lamas, in their flight, always jumped 
clean over the hedge, and landed at the bottom of the 
hill ; and this obfervation determined him to dig a deep 
hole on this fpot, where the lamas jumped down, that 
they might fall into it and be taken. His indefatigable 
labour finilhed in a day and a half this new work of his 
invention. The pit he covered over with green branches, 
and the next day had the fatisfadion of feeing two tole- 
rable large lamas- ta'.;en in it. 

He nov/ thought h'mfelf fufficiently provided with 
meat. He would have been puzzled where to lay it all 
up during the winter, if the earthquake had not furnilhed 
him with a cellar in every refped complete : for clofe by 
his cave another piece of the hillock had funk about two 
tdthoni in depth, and thereby formed a fccond cavern, 

opening. 



i'6 T H E N E W 

opening, as well as the firfl, into his enclofure. He had 
now his dwelling apartment, kitchen, and cellar, all ad- 
joining each other, and placed as conveniently as if they 
had been planned and laid out by art. 

There now remained three things more, which done, 
he was to count himfelf fully guarded and provided 
againft the e;(pe6tcd approach of winter : hay was to 
be made for his lamas ; a ftock of wood to be laid up 
for firing; and all his potatoes were to be dug up, and 
lodged in the cellar. 

Hay he had collected in a pretty large quantity, and 
(lacked it up in his court-yard, as haymakers do here ; 
and whenever he put frefii hay on it, he trod it down {o 
hard that the rain could not eafily foak into it. But here 
experience taught him a little more of haymaking, the' 
at the cxpence of feme labour and Crou' le. 

You muft know, he had not taken care to dry the hay 
perfectly. Whenever this happens, and it is at the fame 
time prelTed down tightly in the ftack, it begins to heat, 
next to fmoke, and at length it takes fire. This was a 
matter that Robinfon had never heard of when he was 
young ; for he had never much troubled his head about 
farming bufinefs; but in his prefent fituation he iearned 
how ufeful it is to remark every thing, and to collect as 
much information as podible, even though we cannot 
forefeehow far it may, one day or other, become ufeful. 

His furprlfe was great, indeed, v;hen he faw, all of 
a fudden, his hdvccck begin to fmoke ; but he was ftili 
much more afbonilhed, when, on thrufting his-hard into 
it, he found the infide burning hot. He could not per- 
fuade himfelf but that the hay was on fire, though he 
could not polfibly conceive how the fire could get in 
there. 

He took down the haycock, therefore, as fail: as pof- 
fible ; but was very much furprized to find no fire, and 
to fee that the hay was every where extremely hot and 
moift. He was, therefore, at lall, convinced, (as was 
rea.ly the cafe,) that the moiftu^-e alone caufed tne hay 
to heat, though he could, in no wile, conceive how 
that (hould be. 

Rich. I muft ov.'n I find it hard to imagine how wet- 
nefs alone can make any thing heat. 

Mr. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. tij 

Mr, Bill My dear Richard, there are a thoufatid fuch 
cfFe(5l3 as this in nature; and human reafon, which hath 
been refle6l!n'g on them for many ages, hath clearly dif- 
covered the true caufes of- many of them. Thefe ufual 
difcoveries are comprifed in a fcience, of which, ^per- 
haps, you do not know the name. It is called Natural 
Philofophy, There you may find the reafon of this 
remarkable effedl of moiilure, as well as many other ap- 
pearances in nature that are extremely fingular. And 
if you continue to apply yourfelf properly to the fci*- 
cnces which you are learning at prefent, I will teack 
you alfo that of natural phiiolophy> which will give 
you inexpreflible pleafure. Here it would be to no 
purpofe to introduce it, becaufe you could not under- 
hand v/hat I fliould fay to you. 

Robinfon then dried his hay afrefb, and made it up 
into a fre(h haycock, which could ftand fecure againft 
both wind and rain. To render it dill more fecure, he 
topped it with a covering of reeds, fcarce inferior in 
firmnefs to our thatch roofs. 

For fome days following, he employed himfelf \n 
gathering as much dry wood as he judged he fiiould 
want. After this, he dug up his potatoes, and found 
them a very confiderable ftcck. Thefe he laid up care- 
fully in his cellar. Laftly, he (book the lemon-tree, 
and brought home as many of the fruit as were ripe, to 
preferve them too againft the winter; and now he was 
freed from all apprehenfions of want during the bad 
weather. 

But though it was almofl: the end of Oclober, the 
cold, which had made Robinfon fo uneafy, was not to 
be felt irx the leail. Inftead of that, the weather turned 
to rain, and it rained fo inceffantly that the air feemed 
to be changed into water. He did not know what to 
think of it. For a fortnight together, he never put his 
foot outfide of his cave, unlefs to go to the cellar, the 
hayftack, or the fpring, to fetch victuals and water for 
himfelf and his lamas. The reft of the time he was 
obliged to pals like a prifoner. 

How heavily the hours crept on! Nothing to do, 
and all alone ! My dear children, it is impoliible for 
you to imagine a greater mifery ! If any body could 

have 



Ii8 T HE N E W 

have given him a book, or pen, ink, and paper, he 
would, with great chearfulnefs, have given one day of 
his life for every Iheet of paper. ** Oh !" faid he now 
and then to himfelf, with a heavy figh, ** how filly was 
I in my younger days to look upon reading and writing 
as fomething tircfome, and idlenefs as fomething agree- 
able! The mofb tedious book in the world would now 
be a treafure to me, and I would prefer a (heet of paper, 
with pen and ink, to the pofTefTion of a kingdom." 

During this wearifome time, receility forced him to 
have recourfe to all forts of employments which he had 
nouhitherto tried. He had been meditating a long time 
whetlier it would not be polTible for him to make an 
earthen pet and a lamp ; things which would have ren- 
dered his fituation incomparably better. — He ran, 
therefore, in the middle of the rain, to look for potter's 
earth ; and, having found a fufficient quanticy of it, he 
immediately began to work. 

The making of earthen veifels did not fucceed with 
him all at once : he made many inefTeftual trials at firft ; 
but, having nothing elfe to do, as often as his work 
was finifhed, and not to his liking, he amufed himfelf 
with breaking it to pieces, and beginning afrefh. He 
Ipent a few days in this manner, his work alFording him 
amuferaent rather than trouble, until, at length, his 
pot and lamp were finiihed fo com.plete, that it v/ould 
have been ill- nature to break them again. He placed 
them, therefore, in his kitchen, not far frorn the fire, 
to dry gradually. After this, he went on making other 
pots, pans, and pipkins, of different fhapes and fizes ; 
and the more he pra(^ifed this work, the more ready he 
became at it. 

The rain continued, in the mean time, without inter- 
ruption. Robinfon, theiefcre, fau' himfelf under the 
necelTity of inventing other doraeftic labours to keep 
himfelf from the unpleafant effeiSts of having nothing to 
do. His firft tail; was to make a tifning net. He had 
laid in, beforehand, a pretty good frock of packthread, 
which came now very feafonably into ufe. As he took 
time enough, he had the patience to try a thing ti:n 
times or more, which did not fucceed with him at firff, 
he found, at lengrh, the true method o^ making the 

knots. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 119 

knots, and he became as clever at the work as any 
woman or girl in this country who prattife making nets 
or purfesTfor he had invented alfo an inl^rument of 
wood, which he cut with his knife of flint, fomething 
in the form of a fpit ; and with tliis he contrived to 
make a ner, which, forgoodnefs and real ufe, was little 
inferior to our common liQiing nets. 

It next came into his head to try whether he could 
not make a bow and arrows. The thought of this fet 
him all alive, when he confidered the many great advan- 
tages that a bow would procure him ! With a bow 
and arrows he could kill lan:as, he could flioot birds, 
and — what was by far more important — with thefe he 
could defend himfelf in his dwelling place, if ever the 
favages came to attack him. He was all impatience to 
fee the bow finisljed, and ran, notwithftanding the rain 
and the wind, to look for the proper wood. 

For it was not every fort of wood that was fit for the 
purpofe ; it (hould be at the fame time hard and fupple, 
that on the one hand it might be bene without raucli 
difficulty, and on the other, when bent, might endea- 
vour to return to its former ftate. 

Rick. It fiiould be elaftic, papa ; fhould it not ? 

Mr, Bill, The very thing. I did not know that you 
remembered the fignilkation of that word, and, there- 
fore, I did not chtjfe to make ufe of it. 

Having, therefore, found and cue a piece of this fort 
of wood, he carried it home, and beg.^n immediately to 
work upon it. But, alas! how oid he then feel the 
want of a proper knife ! He was obliged to cut twenty 
times to bring oft as much wood as we could cut at 
once with a knife of fteel. Though he worked from 
the rifing to the fetting of the fun at this taik without 
the leafl: intermiifion, he was obliged to be eight whole 
days about it. I know fome people who would not 
have had fuch patience. 

Geo, (/!? the other children) Papa means us now. 

Mr. Bin, George, you have jufl gueffcd it ; and do 
not you think that 1 am right? 

Geo, Why, yes, papa. But, for the future, I will 
take care to go on with whatevc-r work I once begin. 

Mr, 



120 T H E N E W 

M-. BtlL You will do well. Robinfon, at leaft, 
found the advantages of doing fo. He had the inex- 
preflible joy of feeing his bow finidicd on the ninth day ; 
and now he wanted nothin:^ but a llring and arrows. 
If he ,liud thought of it when he killed the lamas, he 
would have tried, perhaps, to make (Irings of their 
guts ; for he knew that, in Europe, it is common to 
make them of fiieeps guts. For want, therefore, of 
catgut, he twifted a firing of packthread, and made it 
as Qrong as pollible. After this, he proceeded to make 
his arrows. 

What would he have given f®r a fmall piece of iron 
to point his arrows with! But wifbing was to no pur- 
pole. As he ftood at the door of his cave, confidering 
how he might fupply the want of iron points to his ar- 
rows, he turned his eyes, by chance, on the lump of 
gold which lay there ftill on the ground as a thing of 
no ufe. ** Go," faid he, fpurning it with his foot, 
** go, ufelefs metal, and become iron, if you wilh 
that I (hould value you!" And, with thefe words, 
he turned away from it, not deigning to look at it 
again. ' 

By dint of thinking on the fubjedl over and over 
again, he, at length, remembered to have heard that the 
favages of fome nations make ufe of nfli bones and fiiarp 
flones to point their lances and arrows-; and he refolved 
to imitate them in this refpe*5l : at the fame time he 
formed the defign of making a lance-or fpear. 

Thefe two things were mimediacely put into execu- 
tion. He ran to the fca-Ode, and was lucky enough to 
find fome hfn bones and fliarp flints, exactly fuch as he 
wanted. After this, he cut a long, flraight flafF for the 
fpear, and returned home wet to the very fkin. 

In a few days the fpear and the arrows were finilhed. 
He had- pointed the fpear with a ftjarp flone, and the 
arrows with frrong fillj- bones ; to the other end of his 
arrows he tied feathers, to make them fly the better. . ^ 

H^ then tried how his bow would flioot : though it 
wanted a number of things, which be could not poliibly 
add to it for v/anc of iron tools, he found it, however, 
tolerably handy for fhooting birds, or other fniall ani- 
Uials. He did not even doubt bu-: he Ihould^e able, 

with 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 121 

this bow, to wound a naked fdvage dangercufly, pro- 
vided the favage would let him come near enough. He 
had ftill better reafon to be pleafed with his fpear. 

His earthen pots and his lamp feenried now to be fuffi- 
ciently dry. He refolved, therefore to make ufe of 
them. In the firfl: place, he^put into one of his new 
pipkins a lump of ht, which he had taken out of the 
lamas that he killed.' This fat he intended to melt, and 
ufe as oil f .r his lamp. But he had the mortification lo 
perceive tl ..t the Ldt, as foon as melted, foaked through 
the pipkir , and filtered out, drop by drop, fo that very 
little remained in- the pipkin. He concluded from 
thence, that the lamp and pots would have the fame 
defeat, and con'equently never be of any ufe to him ; a 
conjecture which experience very foon verified. 

What a difagreeable accident I He had made himfelf 
fo happ-f/ in thinking that he (hould foon fpend the even* 
ings pkafantly by the light of a lamp, and be able once 
more, to tafce a difli of broth j but now all thefe fine 
hopes feemed to vaniih in a moment. 

Henry, It was certainly a great vexation to fee fo 
much trouble loll. 

Mr. Fill. Without doubt it was fo ; and fome people, 
that I know, would have been provoked to fling all the 
work away, and never meddle with pot-making again. 
But Robinfon wasiiiby this time, pretty well praftifed 
in patience, and had taken it ftrongiy in his head that a 
thing fliould never be done by halves, while it was pof- 
fible to finifh it completely. 

He fat down, therefore, in his fludying comer (for fo 
he called one of the corners of his cave, where he ufed 
to fit down when he had a mind to exercife his inven- 
tion), and there he rubbed his forehead. ** Whence 
comes it," faidhe to himfelf, '* that the pots in Europe, 
which are made of earth as v/ell as mine, are, neverthe- 
]efs, much more compaiSt, and do not foak through ? — 
Why, that is becaufe they are glazed — Hum ! Glazed ? 
Now, what may that be properly, and how is it done ? 
— Aha ! I think I know now ! Yes, it mud be fo ! Have 
not I read fomewhere, that fand and feveral other fub- 
lUnces, fuch as earthen vefl'els, are of the nature of glafs, 
and might be turned into real glafs by a flrong lire ? It 
F muft 



122 T H E N E W 

mufl certainly be fo that tliey manage it : they put the 
earthen ware into a hot fjinace, and when it begins to 
melt, they tak^^ it out Icll it fliould be entirely changed 
into glals. Yes, yts, that is the whole art. 1 muli do 
in the fame manner." 

No iboncr laid than done : he Undled a good fire in 
his kitchen, and w hen it was in full blaze, he put one 
of the pipkins into the \ery middle of it. However, it 
was net long there before — crack it went, and fplit in 

pieces. ** Heyday I" faid Robinfon, ** who would 

have thought it ?" 

He fat down again in his ftudying corner. ** What 
could have been the reaibn of this ?" faid he to him- 
lelf. — ** Have I ever met wich any thing fimilar to this 
before ? — Eh ! certainly 1 have, in winter-time, when 
we have put a tumbler fall of cold w ,ter or beer on a 

warm (love, did not the giafs break immediately ? ^ 

Has it ever happened that the giafs did not break ? Yes, 
when it was put on the ll:ove before it was quite hot, or 
when we put a pie*.e ot paper under.it. ^ Vtr) well : I 
am pretty fure of one thing : ay, ay, that muft be the 
cafe. I maft take care not to put it upon the nre all at 
once, but to let it grow warm hrfl. 1 muil tn-ce care 
alio that the fire do not come to one of the ends of it — 
A lucky thought I" crieu he, quite overjoyed, and llirt- 
ing up to make a fecoud trial. ^ 

This fucceeded ramer better. The pipkin did not 
fplit; but, then^ on the otiier hand, jf was not glazed 
neither. 

*'^ Hov/ comes this ?" faid Robinfon to hirnfelf, 
** And yet I thought the fire was hot enough. What 
can it.polUbly want ilill ?" After meditating a long time 
upon the matter, he thought, at length, he had hit upon 
the reafon. He had made the experim.ent with a tire 
which was rot clofed up in a ftcve or oven, but buined 
in the open air. This fire loll its force too foon, and 
was too much fpread on every (ide to heat the earthen 
ware fufficiently for glazing it. Robinfon, therefore, 
determined to (lick to his principle of not doing things 
by halves, and to conftruct a proper oven or furnace like 
thofe in the potteries ; but lor this it was requifue that 
Ciie weather Ihould be more favourable. 

For^ 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 123 

For, you mufl: know, it rained ll:ill incefTintly ; nor 
did the fky, ac Uft, begin to clear jp fill af^er the expi- 
ration of two aionths. Robinlbn thought new that the 
winter Wris g ^ng to fet in ; whereas, behold ye, the 
winter -vas pail ! He could fcarce believe his eyes, when 
he faw every appearance of I'pring — the grafs grten and 
tender, the trees budding out and blolfoming, and frefli 
flowers beginning ever\ where to blow \ and yet it 
really was fo. The thing was beyond his comprehen- 
fion, though he ("aw it clearly before his eyes. ** This 
will be a warning to me," laid he, ** never, for the fu- 
ture, to deny any thing haftily that I do not under- 
lland." 

AJrs. BilL Did|not he goto bed when he had faid fo ? 

Gee. Oh ! mama, we are none of us the leatl fleepy, 

Mr. BilL I am not very pofuive whether he did or 
not ; my info^malion fails me in tha: refpc^cl. However, 
as 1 find nothing elle remarkable in this day's otcur- 
rences, as they appear in the old hiPcory of Robinfon's 
adventures on the ifland, I prefume that, after thefe 
, word?, he a6tually did go to bed. And we will do 
the fame, that, like him, we may rife to-morrow with 
the fun. 



ELEVENTH EVENING. 

QEORGE. Papa, I (hould like to be in Robinfon's 
place now. 

Mr. Bill. Would you really ? 

Geo Yes; for now he has every thing that he 
wants, and lives in a nne country wheie there is nevet 
any winter. 

Mf, Bi.'l. Every thing that he wants, has he ? 

Gfo. Yes : has not he pot3toc?and meat, and fait and 
lemons, and fi(h and turtle, and oyftv^rs ; and do not the 
Ia;nas give him milk? He can make butter and cheefe 

F Z Mr^

^Jr. Bill. So he has too, for fome time pad:, though I 
forgot to mention it. 

irec. Well, and then he has a bow and arrows, and a 
fpear, and a fnug p!ace to live in. What more could he 
wifli ? 

Mr. BUI. Robinfon knew very well the value of all 
thcfe good things, and thanked God for them ; nevcrthe- 
lefs, he would have given the half of his remaining life 
for the arrival of afliip that would carry him to his own 
country. 

Gee. Ay ! why what did he want dill? 

Mr, Bill. Many things ; an infinite deal of things, not 
to fay every thing. He wanted thofe blelfings without 
which there can be no true happinefs here below, as fo- 
ciety, friends, beings of his own fpecies, whom he might 
love, and by whom he might be, in his turn, beloved. 
Far from his parents, whom he had fo feverely afflicted ; 
far from his friends, whom he could not hope ever to 
lee again ; far from men, from all men, from all the 
world ; alas ! in this melancholy, what joy could he 
tafte, had he even the richeft abundance poffible of all 
the good things which this earth affords? Try, my lit- 
tle friend, try only once, but for one fingle day, to be 
quite alone in a foiitary place, and then you will know 
what a life of lolitude is ! 

Befides, Robinfon was far from having his many other 
wants gratified. His cloaths were falling by degrees all 
to rags ; nor did he know how he was to have new 
cloaths when thefe fhould be paft ufe. 

Rich. Oh ! as to cloaths, he might very well do with- 
out them in an ifland where it was fo hot, and where 
there was no v/inter. 

Harriet. Oh fie ! Would you have him go naked ? 

Mr. Bill. It is true, he had no occafion for cloaths to 
protc6l him from the cold; but he had much occafion 
for them to guard his body from the infers with which 
this ifland (warmed, particularly mullcitoes. 

Eci-^jj. What are thcfe creatures, thefe mufkitoes ? 

Mr. Bill. A fort of flies, v/hofe fting is much more 
painful than that of ours. In whatever country they are 
found, they torment the natives exceedingly ; for their 
ftiags produce almofl: as painful fwellings as thofe of 

bees 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 125 

bees or wafps do with us. Robinlbn's face and hands 
were almolt always fwelled with them. Now, what 
muft he expefl to fuffer when once his cloaths were 
worn out ! and that time was coming very fafl:. 

This, together with his earneil: and longing defire to 
behold his parents, and fociety in general, once more 
drew many a figh from him, when (landing on the fea- 
fhoie, and looking, v/ith moiilened eyes, over the bound- 
lefs ocean, he could dillinguifli nothing but the fea and 
l]cy. How did his heart fometimes flutter with empty 
hope, when, in the riiflant horizon, he perceived afmall 
cloud, which his imagination reprefented to him as a (Lip 
in full fail ! And v,?hen, at length, he difcovertd his mif- 
take, how the tears v/ould trickle from his eyes, and his 
heart feem ready to burft as he returned home flowly to 
his habitation I 

Harriet, He lliould have prayed for the coming of a 
fliip ; perhaps his prayers might have been heard. 

Mr, Bill. He did (b, my dear Harriet. He prayed 
night and day for his deliverance from the defert illand ; 
hut he never forgot at the fame time, to add, ** Not 
Hiine, O Lord ! but thy will be done." 

Harriet. V/hy did he add that ? 

Mt \ Bill. Becaufe he was now perfef^ly convinced 
that the Supreme Being knows much better than v/e do 
what is for our interefts. He reafoned thus : " If it be 
the good pleafure of my heavenly Father to let mere- 
main here longer, he certainly has very good reafons for 
it, though I cannot fee them ; confeouently, I ought to 
pray for my liberty, barely on condition that his wiidom 
ihall think h to be for my advantage." 

Left a ve/fel Ihould happen any day to pafs or cad 
anchor near the ifland, at a time when he was not near 
'■ tiie fea-(hore, he refolved to fix, on the neck of land 
which jutted out towards the fea, a (ignal by which all 
who (hould come in (ight might be informed of his dif- 
treO. This iignal was no more than a pole, on the top 
of which he fallened a banner. 

E(hv. Ay ! Where did he get the banner? 

Mr. Bill, I am going to tell you. His ftirt was then 

in fuch a-ftate, that it was impoffible to wear it longer. 

He took, thererore, the largeft flip of it, Qiaped it into a' 

F 3 kind 



J26 T H E N E W 

l:\nc\ of banner or flag, and fixed it on the pole that he 
was to Aick up. 

He would have been very glad to put i!p alfo, on his 
pole, a la!)el, with an infcription, to give a clearer idea 
t'f his dillrcls ; hut how v.'as this to be done ? The r>nly 
wav in his -jower wa? to cut out the letters with his knife 
of flint. Ne\t to this the queflion was, in what lan- 
guage the inlcription fiiould be. jf it v/ere EngliHi, 
tliere might come by dips of other nations, as Dntch, 
Spanill', or French, and ihe people m'jrht happen not to 
underOand it. Luckily he recollected fome Latin words, 
by which he could exprcfs whai he wifl^ed. 

C>:, But would iVan^en underfUnd lii it ? 

/./'•. BilL The Latin language, you know ia conimoa 
in all countries of Europe, and moft men who have re- 
ceivtd any education, ^know, at leaft, fomethingof it. 
fierce Robinfon hoped, that, in whare'.er fijip pafTed 
that wav, there might be one or two, at leaft, who 
would i.nderdandh's infcription. He, therefore, put it up, 

J-';J.\ V/batwas it, then ?

Ceo, les, papa. Help th:' unfortunate Robinfon / 

yk/rj. Bill His greatf.fl: inconvenience now was the 
want of fi^oes and Rocking^-. They were fallen to p'eces, 
and the mufkitoes did fo furioudy attack his naked legs, 
thai he knew not where to fly from them. His face, his 
hands, ard his feet, were fo fwelied by the rings of 
rhvrfe infedts, fince the raining feafon, during whicr. they 
had multi.Llied prodigioufly, that he feemtdno longer to

How often did he fit down in his (ludyinj cotnir, to 
think of iome way to cover himlelf! but always to no 
purpofe. He had neither inftruments nor fkill to provide 
himfejf with what he wanted, and what he found fo in- 
difpenfhblv necelfary. 

7'he fkins of the lamas that he had killed appeared tfee 
readied means whereby he might clothe him'elf; but 
jflj'ns were ^^'11 raw and fuft, and unfortunately he had 
Ecver troubled himfelf concerning the manner in v.'Iiich 
tanners and curriers prepared the raw hides ; and even if 
he kFiCVv how to ^o this, he had rieither needle not

Henry. In fadl, to wliat purpofe were thefe mifera- 
ble infefls created, fince they are only a trouble and 
torment to us ? 

Mr, Bill, Why, I might, in -my turn, afk you, to 
what purpofe were we created, you, and I, and other 
men ? 

Henry, On purpofe that we might be happy in the 
world. 

Mr. bill. And whafcould have induced our Creator 
to propofc th'S ohjt6l to himfelf in creating us ? 

Henfy. His goodnefs, which is fo great that he did net 
defire to be hippy alone. 

Mr. Bill. Very well, and do you not think that thefe 
infefts alfo enjoy a fort pf happinefs ? 

Henry. Yes, that I can eifily imagine. We fee hov/ 
they rejoice when the fun fiiines and it is pretty hot. 

Mr. Bill. Right ; and does not this realon give you to 
underdand to what purpofe they were created ? Name- 
ly, that they alfo may rejoice upon the earth, and be as 
happy as their nature will permit them. Is not this 
purpofe perfcCllv confiilent with in6nite goodnefs ? 

Het.ry. Yes; only I think that the Supreme Bt:ing 
might have created fuch animals alone as do harm to 
nobody. 

Mr. Bill. Be thankful tQ your Creator that he has 
done no fuch thing. 

Henty. Why ? 

Mr. Bill. Becaufe, otherwife, neither you nor I, nor 
any of us, would ever have exifted. 

Henry. How fo ? 

Mr. Bill. Becaufe we belong precifely to the moft 

devouring and defirudive fpecies of animals in the 

vorld. All the other creatures of the earth are not 

or.iy our flave', but we evea kill them at our pleafure 5

fomeiimes to eat their fiefh ; fometimes to have their 
llcins; lometimcs becaulc they are in our way ; feme- 
times for other reafons which we could not cafily juf- 
tify. How much more caufe, therefore, would the in- 
ieii\s have to aflc why thut cruel animal nun was creat- 
ed ? NovA', what would you anfwer to a fly that fhould 
alk you this quedion ? 

He'ity ( hejitating). Why — indeed! don't know. 

Mr, Bill, Now, for my pait, I would fpeak to him in 
thele words : "My fiiend, Mr. Fly, your queflion is 
very inconfiderate, and (hews that you have not a think- 
ing head, and that you know not the art of refledion ; 
ocherwife you would eafily have difcovered, with the 
fmallell grain of thought, that the Supreme Being hath, 
merely of his gocdnefs, created feveral of his creatures 
in fuch a manner that one is obliged to live upon others: 
for, if he had not done lb, he could not have created by 
one half fo many Ipec'es of animals as he has, becaufe 
grafs and the fruits of the earth would have been fuffi- 
cient but for a few fjpecies of living creatures. To the 
end, therefore, that all nature might be animated — that 
there might be every where, in the water, in the air, and 
on the earth, living animals which (hould rejoice in their 
exiftence, and to the end that one fpecies of creatures 
might not multiply too much to the dcftru6.ion of ano- 
ther, it was necelfary that our wife and gooi Creator 
fliould deftine fome of his creatures to furnifh the fub- 
fjftence of others. 1 hou thyfelf, friend fly, doll fcaft on 
the blood of other animals, and even on ours. Why 
ihouldfl: thou take it amifs if the fpider catch thee in her 
web, or the fwallow devour thee as a fweet morfel ?" 

What think you, Henry ? Would not the fly, if it 
were vv'ife, be contented with this anfwer ? 

Henry, I don't know, papa. I am contented. 

My. Bill. Well, now we will return to our friend 
Robinfon. 

Neceliicy forced him to help hjmfelf the beft he could. 
He took the fkins, therefore, and cut out of them with 
his knife of flint, but not without a great deal of trou- 
ble, firil a pair of fhoes, and then a pair of (lockings. 
He could not few either of them j he was obliged, 
therefore, Co content himfelf with making eyelet-holes in 

them;

them, and lacing them to his legs and feet with a flring ; 
which was no doubt fubjeft to great inconveniencies : 
for though lie turned the hair outwards, he flill felt a 
violent heat in his feet. Befides, the fkin, which was 
ftifFand hard, bliftered his feet, and took the (kin off at 
the leaft attempt, that he made to walk, and (o raufed 
him very great pain. However he chofe to endure this 
rather than the flings of the mufkitoes. 

Of another piece of fkin, which was very ftitf and a 
little bent, he made a mafk, cutting in it two f mall holes 
for the eyes, and another for the mouth, that he might 
be able to breathe. 

And, fince he had begun this work, he refolved not to 
quit it until he had finifbed with making himfelf a jacket 
and trowfers of lamas fkin. It is true, this talk was 
much more difficult ; but have we any thing without 
trouble ? and v/hat is there in which we do not fuccced 
at lafl, with the requifite patience and application ? 
Thus he alio accompliflied his defign, which filled bim 
with inexpreflible joy. 

The jacket was compofed of three pieces, which were 
joined to^tlier by ftrini^s. Two of ihefe pieces ferved 
for the arms, and the third for the body. The trowfers 
confifled of two pieces, one before and one behind, and 
they were laced at the fides. When the jacket arid 
trowfers were fmifhed, he put them both on, v^ith the 
refplution never to drefs himfelf again in his old Euro* 
pean cloaths, which were half torn to pieces, except 
upon the birthdays of his father and mother, which he" 
celebrated as folemn feftivals. 

His drefs v/as then the nioft fingular that can be ima- 
gined ; fiom head to foot covered in ik'ins, \v\th the hair 
outwards ; inllead of a fvord, a large hatciiet of flone 
by his fide ; on his back a pouch, v.7ith a bov/ and 
quiver of arrows ; in his right hand a fpear almoll: twice 
as long as himfelf, and in his left a wicker umbrella, co- 
vered with leaves of the cocoa-nut tree: laftly, upon his 
head, inltead of a hat, a cap of wicker-work, riung in 
a point, and covered in the fame manner with ficins, the 
hairs outward. Imagine to yourfelves what a iigure all 
this mull cut ; nobody that law him accoutercd in this

man creature; nay, he could not help laughing at him- 
felf, when, being on the Innk of a livulet, he law his 
image in die water in this drefs for the firft time. 

/\fur this, lie refumed his pottei's work. The oven 
was foon tiniflied, and then he liad a mind to try whe- 
ther, by force of an exceeding great fire, he could not 
produce a fort of glazing on his pots. He put them> 
therefore, and his pipkins into it, after which he made 
up by degrees fo great a fire, that the oven was red hot 
from one end to the other. This violent fire he kept up 
until evening, luf/ering it then to go out by degrees, and 
being very curious to know the refult of his labour. But 
what, think ye, was the refulc of it? The firft pot that 
he took out was not glazed, notwithfianding all that he 
had done, nor the fecond neither, nor, in fbort, any of 
ihem. But, at laft, in examining one of his pipkins, he 
perceived, with equal joy and lurprile, that this, and this 
•alone, was covered at bottom with a real glazing. 

This Vv/as to him a riddle Vv'hich he could by no means 
folve. ** What reafon in the world could there be,'* 
faid l.e, ** why this fingle pipkin is a little glazed, and 
not one of the other veffels, though they were all made 
of the fame earth, and baked in one and the fame oven ?" 
i-je thought and thought again, but he was a long time 
before he could fee the leall: giimpfe of any thing that 
feemcd likely to explain the myfiiery. 

At length, he recollefted that there had been a little 
fait in this pipkin when he put it into the oven. He 
could not help thinking, therefore, that the fait alone 
muft be the caufe of the glazing. 

R/c6, But was it really the fait, papa, that produced 
this effea ? 

Mr. Bill. Yes : wliat Robinfon now difcovered by 
chance has been long known in Europe ; the addition 
of fait is the true caufe v.'hy many things turn to glafs in 
the fire : i'o that he only need have rubbed the earthen 
ware with felt water, or barely, have throwa^a litde ialt 
into tlie oven when heated, and immediately all his pots 
would have been properly glazed. 

This, therefore, he refolved to try the next day. And 
now tlie fire blazed under his oven, and already he had 
rubbjd Ibme of his vefllls with fait wt.ter, and put dry

fait fn others, on purpofe to make the two experiments 
at the fame time, when, in the midil ofhis work, he was 
interrupted by an accident v.'hich he had dreaded a long 
time — he v/as taken ill. 

He felt pains in his breafl and head, and a great weari* 
nefs all over his limbs, and was threatened with the mod 
terrible lituation that a man can pollibl y expt^r'ence. 

** Good Heaven !" laid he to himfelf ; ** what will 
become of me if I cannot rife out of my bed ! if there is 
no compufiionate being to take care of me, and come to 
iny aifiiVance in my illnefs ! no friend to wipe off" the 
fweat of death from my forehead, or offer me any refrefb- 
ment ! — Heavens ! what will become of me !" 

Sinking under the weight of his diftrefs, as he faid 
thefe words he fell to the ground, quite exhaufted. 

Ah ! it was in this moment: of trial thnt he had more 
occafion than ever to podefsa firm and filial confidence 
in his heavenly Father, who is every where prefcnt, and 
lupremely good. Deprived of all human affiftance, fcr- 
faken by his own flrength, what remained to prevent his 
dying in milery ? Nothing but the affiftiince of God ; 
no other fupport had he to expert in the whole world. 

He was on the ground in on agony of diftrefs ; his 
hands were clafped firongly together; and, unable to 
ipeak, unable to think, lie looked ftedfaftly up towards 
heaven. *' Oh, Lord ! Oh, Lord ! Mercy!" was all 
that he could utter now and then, fetching at the fame 
lime moll heavy fighs and groans. 

But this ftate of unxiety did not fufFer hi-m long to re- 
main inactive. He mu lie red up what ftrength he had 
ftill remaining, in order, if pollibie, to place near his 
bed whatever he fl^ould moft want for refrelhment, that 
he might not be entirely defiitute of it, in cafe the fick- 
nefs abfolutely prevented him from rifmg. He was 
barely able to carry a couple of cocoa-nut lliells full of 
water, and place them befide his bed. He next laid 
ibme roafted potaitoes there, and four len»ons which he 
had fiill remaining, and then, not able to ftir an inch 
farther, he fell dow^n with wearinefs on his miferable 
bed. 

If it had pleafed his Maker to take him out of the 
world by a ludden dea:h, how contentedly would he 

iiavc 



1.32 THE NEW 

Iiave yielded up his life ! He even prayed that it might 
Ih; io } hut very foon he refledcd that this prayer was 
not reafonahle. " Am I not a child of God ?" faid he 
to himfelf; " Am 1 not the work of his hands? Is he 
not my father, and a tender, wife, and almighty father? 
How h:^vc I then the boldnefs to prefcribe to him what 
he fljould do witli me? Doth he not know befl what is 
good for me, and will he not a6t fo as to allot me that 
which is good ? Yes, he will ; God is benevolent, mer- 
ciful, and almighty. Be at rell,then, O my foul ; turn 
thee to thy Maker in thofe moments of difcomfort — to- 
wards thy God— who delivers from all diflreffes ! He 
will affift thee, he will prefcrve thee, whether in life or 
in death !'' 

4fter thefe words he was fomewhat encouraged, and 
raifing himfelf upon his knees, he prayed with all the 
earnellnefs pofTible, fa}ing, ** I refign myfelfto thee, 
O my heavenly Father ; I refign myfelfto thy fatherly 
guidance .' Difpofe of me according to thy good plea- 
iire. I Vv'ill bear contentedly whatfoever thou allotteft- 
ne ; only grant me Rrength to bear — it is all that I aik 
ofth^e. O merciful Father, grant me patience under 
iT)y afflidions, and an unfbaken confidence in thee. 
Hear this prayer, this only earnefl: prayer of thy poor 
child who Js in mifery ; hear it for thy tender mercy's 
fake!" 

At the fume time he was attacked with a violent ague. 
Though he co\ered himielf all over with the dried lama 
r^ins, ytt he could not keep himfelf warm. This cold 
tt lafied full two hours, and was fucceeded by a hot 
fir, which was like a burning fire through his veins. His 
hreaft, by the violent beating cf his pulfe, heaved and 
funk like the breail qf a perfon that is out of breath 
with running, in this terrible fituation he had fcarce 
ftrength enough to lift the cccoa-nut fteil, with the 
water in it, to his moi th, that he might cccl his lurning 
tongue. 

At length a violent fv;eat broke out all over his body 
in ?reat drop?, and that afforded h^m fome eafe. When, 
iit'the end of about an hour, it abated, he recovered 
\.\b ipirits a little, and then he was diftreffed with the idea 
ihut'hts fire would go out if frefb v/ocd was not put on. 

He 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 133 

He crept, therefore, weak as he was, upon all fours, 
and threw as much wood upon the hearth as would be 
fufficient to keep in the fire until the next morning ; for 
night was now approaching. 

It was the worft night that ever he paffed in his life. 
The cold and hot 6t of his ague followed each other 
without irtermiflion. He had a violent and continual 
pain in his head, and could not clofe his eyes the whole 
night. All this weakened him fo much, that in the 
morning he was fcarcely able to crawl towards the heap 
of wood to replenilh his fire. 

Towards evening his illnefs encreafed afrefh ; he 
tried again to go as far as the hearth, but for this time 
he found himfelf unable. He was obliged, therefore, 
to give up all thoughts of keeping in his fire; and this, 
in effe6l, foon became a matter of indifference to him, 
as he now expe£>ed death to approach in a (hort time. 

This night he was as reftlels as the lafl. In the mean 
time the fire went out ; the remainder of the water that 
was in the cocoa-nut (hells began to fpoil, and Robin- 
fon was no longer able to turn himfelf inJiis bed. He 
thought he felt the approach of death, and his joy on. 
this account afforded him fufficient f:rcngth to prepare 
himfelf for his laft jourjicy with a devo'it prayer. 

He again humbly afked forgivenefs of God for his 
fins, and then thanked him for the bleifings thai he had 
vouchfafed him — unworthy as he was — during the 
whole courfe of his life. But, particularly, he tlunked 
him for the affli6lions which had been fcnt him for his 
amendment, and he acknowledged fincerely how whole* 
fome they had been to him. Lallly, he prayed for the 
comfort and happinefs of his poor parents ; after which, 
he recommended his immortal foul to the eternal mercy 
of his God and Father. — He then fettled himfelf, and 
waited for death with joyful hope. 

And, indeed, death feemed to advance fafl : hispains 
encreafed, his breaft began to rattle, and his bieathing 
became more and more difficult. Ah ! behold tlte 
wi(hed-for moment ! It feems to come at length. A 
pain, fuch as he had never felt before, feized his breafl: ; 
he fuddenly flopped breathing, felt a conyulfive fljud-

dering, funk down on his bed, and was deprived of 
fcnfe and motion. 

All the young company remained filent for a pretty 
long time, and by their forrow ftiewed the refpe(^ that 
they bore to the mem iry of their friend whom they had 
never fecn— ** Poor Robinfon!" cried fome of them, 
fighing. ** Heaven be praifed !" faid others ; " he is 
now delivered out of all his pain !" And thus they fe- 
parated for that evening, rather more quietly and with 
more appearance of thoughu'fuincfs than ufua!. 



TWELFTH E V E N 1 xN G. 

QRARLOTrE. Well, papa, what wi!l you read 
us this evening ? 

Mr. BilL You all feem to expect, my dears, that I 
{hould read you fomething inftrattive and amufmg for 
this evening. "What lay ye ? Shall I go on with the 
adventures of Robinfon Crufoe ? 

Charlotte. How ! why Robinfon is dead. 

Rich, Do not be in a hurry, Charlotte. He may 
have recovered. Don't you remember that we thought 
him dead once before ? and yet he was alive, 

Mr. Bill. We left Robinfon, after his convulfivc 
Ihuddering, fallen into a fwoon, deprived cf lenle and 
motion, and in fliort, more dead than alive: neverthe- 
lefs, he came to himfelf again, and recovered his fenfes 
and faculties. 

The Children, Ah ! that is right — we are all of us 
glad that he is not dead. 

Mr. Bill. The firll: token of his breathing again was a 
deep ligh. He ope; s his eyes, looks round him to know 
where he is. At that moment he doubts his being alive ; 
but his doubts arc Toon removed. He, then, falls into 
a tit of melancholy, and, in his prefent fituation, would 
have preferred death to life. 

He teels himleif \ery weak, but free from all trouble- 
feme pain. The burning lieat, which tormented him 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. I53 

before, is now fiicceeded by a kindly fwe.U all over his 
body. To encourage it, he covers hiiTifelf well up 
with n^ins, and before half an hour was at an end, he 
found himfelf confidrrahly relieved. 

But now he was Icized with a violent third:. The 
water that remained was no longer drinkable : luckily, 
he thought of his lemons : he put oneof them to his 
mouth, and fo weak was he that his teeth could fcarcely 
enter it ; but when he had fucked a little of the juice, 
he found himfelf greatly refreflied, and his thirll: quench- 
ed. He now compofed himfelf to reft, his perfpiration 
ftill continuing, and enjoyed an agreeable flumber until 
funrife. 

Hov/ pleafing was the fenfe of his exigence at prefent, 
compared with what he had felt the day before ! The 
violence of his diforder was entirely abated; nothing 
remained of it but an exceilive vveaknefs. He found his 
appetite return already ; he took a roafted potatoe, and 
fprinkled it with a drop of lemon juice, to render it lefs 
inHpid and more refrefning. 

For two days pad he had taken no notice of his lamas ; 
they now afforded a moving fight : forae of them looked 
at him, and feemed to afk if he were recovered yet. 
Fortunately thefe animals, as well as cancels, can do 
without drinking for feveral days, otherwife they v^ould 
have been very badly off, having ne\ er wet their lips for 
two days. Befides, Robinfon being yet too weak to 
rife 2nd fetch them water, they were likely to be de- 
prived of it for fome tim.e. 

The eldeil of the lamas having come np clofs to him, 
he exerted the little ilrength he had in milking her, that 
fne might not go dry. Her milk, no doubt, allifted 
Robinfon's recovery ; for, afcer drinking it, he found 
himfelf confderably better. 

i^fier this, he fell afleep again, enjoyed a mofb re- 
frefliing flumber, and did not awake uniil funfet. He 
perceived that his appetite was encreafed r he fatisfied 
It again with fome potatoes fprinkled with lemon-juice, 
and then went to Ocep once more. 

^ This calm, this uninterrupted fleep, together with 
his good conftitution, contributed fo etfe6tually to the 
recovery of his fl:rength, thit the very next morning he 

was 



136 T H E N E W 

was able to tKc and attempt to walk a few (lops, though 
he rtill daggered with weaknefs-. 

He crawled out of his cave into the fpace before it. 
There he lifts up his eyes to Heaven. Some beams of 
the rifing fun, piercing through the leaves of the trees 
that furrounded him, fhone agreeably on his face, and 
rc-animated him with their pleafing warmth. He 
thought he ffit himfelf receive new life. ** Eternal 
fource of being 1" cried he, " God of my life f what 
thanks fliall I render thee for giving me to behold, once 
more, the bright ftar of div, and by its light the won- 
derful works of thy hands ! Receive my gratitude, for 
that thou didft not forfake me, when all forfook me; 
for that thou haft reftored me to life afrefb, doubtlefs, 
in order that I may have more time to devote tore- 
pentance, and that I may not wafte a moment of my 
remaining life without forwarding that work, the only 
one thinly needful, that I may ever be found ready to take 
my flight towards the place of man's eternal deftination, 
•where each Itall receive the rev/ard of his good or bad 
a^Stions." 

From thefe effufions of gratitude towards his Creator, 
he naturally pafTed to the admiration of the creatures. 
His locks wandered, fometime?, over the immenfities of 
Heaven's azure vault ; fometiraes over the frelh and 
fmiling verdure of the trees and (hrubs, befprinkled 
with pearly dev/; fometimes on his lamas, which, by 
crowding round him, feemed to carefs him and exprefs 
their joy. He felt a pleafing emotion, like that of a 
traveller, who, after a long abfence, enters, once more, 
the bofom of his beloved family. His heart being 
mO\ed Vv'ith tendernefs, and overflov/ing with the kindeft 
fentiments, which fought, as it were, to expand them- 
felves. he (lied a fiood of tears, but they were tears of 
the pureft: ]oy, 

The advantage of being able to take the air, and the 
ufe of milk mixed v/ith fpring water, together with the 
contentednefs of his m/ind, contributed to his perfect 
recovery. In a few days all his ftrength returned, and 
he found himfelf in a capncity iq begin again his former 
occuDutions. 

He 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 137 

He went firfl: to examine his new-made earthen ware, 
and to fee how it had (ucceeded. As foon as he opened 
the oven, what an agreeable furprife ! All his veffels ^ 
were as well glazed as if they had been the work of an 
experienced potter. In the height of his joy for this 
luccefs, he does not perceive that his ware is of no ufc 
to him ; he forgets that his fire is out. When, at length, 
he recoUettcd this circumftance, he flood motionlefs for 
a while, and hanging his head, fixed his eyes, fonie- 
times on his pots, fometimes on his fire-place, and 
ended with heaving a deep figh. 

Neverihelefs, he was able this time to moderate hit 
vexation, and to contain it within due bounds. ** The 
fame good Providence," faid he to himfelf, *' whicS 
before provided you with fire, has always more than one 
way at hand to provide you with it again, and you will 
not be deprived of it, if Heaven thinks fie," Befides, 
he was already taught that he had not the rigors of win- 
ter to fear J and though he was accuftomed, from his 
childhood, to live chiefly on meat, yet he hoped to be 
able, and not inconveniently, to do without it, and 
live upon fruits and the milk of his lamas. 

Charlotte. Why, he might have ufed his fmoaked 
meat for viduals ; there would have been 00 neceflity 
for drefling it. 

Mr. Bill. That is true; but how v/as h.;- to have 
fmoaked meat ? 

Charlotte. Oh ! I forgot that. 

Mr. Bill. After all, he was not forry that he made the 
pots and pans : they were convenient to hold his milk, 
and the largeft he intended for a very particular ufe. 
Rich. What is that? 

Mr. Bill. He thought, if his potatoes were accom- 
panied with butter, he (hould relilli them better than 
without. 

Rich, I fuppofe fo. 

Mr. Bill. Not being able to make a churn of wood, 
he had a mind to try whether he could not churn butter 
in a large earthen pot. He gathered, therefore, as much 
cream as he thought would be fufilcient. He (haped out 
alfo a round fine piece of wood, in the center of which 
li-aude a hole to receive a fuck. This inftrument he 

held 



Jj^ T H E N E W 

held upri^^ht in tlie cream por, and mo\ed it with an in- 
ceirant motion up and down, until the butter was, 
at length, feparatcd from the? bjtter-milk. He then 
waOicd the butter in clean fpring water, and made it up 
N\ith a liitle Uh. 

He was now, once more, happy in the accomplifli- 
mtnt of his delln;n ; huiy at the very moment when he 
was going to reap the fruits of his induflry and perfe- 
verance, he recollected that he muft think no more of 
potatoes, for want of fire to roaft them ; a circumdance 
which, in the warmth of executing his delign, he had 
never once thought of. He has butter, but he can 
make no ufe of it ; he looks at it, he wjflies for it, he 
pu!s it from him, he groves forrowful. Difappointcd 
in his hopes, he finds himfelf juft as he was at tirft, in 
danger of wanting every thing. It is true, the oyfiers, 
the milk, the cocoa-nuts, and flefb, eithef raw or dried 
in the fun, might afford him nourifbmcnt ; but was it 
certain that no accident would deprive him of thefe re- 
Iburces ? And the moft deplorable of all was, that he- 
couid invent no means to render his unhappy lot betttir 
or more fecure. 

What (ball he undertake now ? Whatever his hands, 
w'tuout ihe help of tools, were capable of performing, 
he has already executed ; and it feccns now as if he had 
nothing left to do bu: to pafs the rernainder of hi:^ life in 
idlenefs und fieep. Dreadful defiiny I He cannot bear 
the thought of it. He was now become To accuflomed 
to work, that he could not live without employing his 
time in feme ufeful occupation. In the latter part of hia- 
life, be would often fay, that his reformation was prin- 
cipally owing to this fingle circumfrance ; that he was 
coiiurdirjed,. v;hen in folitude, and deprived of all af- 
fj fiance, to provide for his wants himfeif by p.rfevering 
labour;, and he would add, ** Confiant employment is 
the mother of a crov/d of virtues, as habitual idlenefs 
is the fource of all vice." 

Rich. He was very right ; when one has nothing to 
do, one thinks of nothing but follies and nonfenfe. 

Mr. Bill. It is even fo ; and, therefore, young per- 
fonaare advifed to accurtom the-rifelves early to empioy- 
ri;ent. The character that v;e chieiiy put on when w£ 

are 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 139 

are young, as idlenel's or indudry, activity or flownefs, 
virtue or wickednefs, generally remains with us all our 
lives. 

Eihv. We ftiould apply that to ourfelves. 

Mr, Bi'l. Do (o, my dear children, and condu6l 
yoLirlelves accordingly : you will never repent it. Our 
unfortunate Robinron turned and turned again on every 
fide, to try what he might undertake if. order to avoid 
idlenefs. At length he found an employment. Can you 
guefs what it was ? 

Rich. Were I in his place, 1 know what I would have 
done. 

Mr. lull. Ay ! Let ud hear your plan. 

Rtch^ I would have undertaken to tan the lamas fkins^ 
that their ftiniiefs might not hurt me when I put them.- 
on. B.fidcjs tlie hair mufl: be very inconvenient in a 
country wh re the heat is fo exceffive. 

Mr. Bill, Hov/ would you have fet about it ? 

Rich. Oh ! I know very well how the tanners do. 
We have been more than once to fee them at work. 

Mr. Btll. Well. 

Rich. Firft they put the raw hides in water, and let 
them fteep there for fome days; from thence they carry 
them to the teg^ on which they fcrape them, to force 
out the water in wh ch they are fbaked. After fprinkiing 
them v.ith fait, they cover them up carefully to keep the 
air from them. This they call fiventing the Ikins. In 
fadt, they do fweat while in this fituation : it is eafy to 
perceive a fteam iffue from them. Thus prepared, they 
are eafily deprived of their hair, v^^hich is done by fcrap- 
ing them again. After this part of the work, they put 
the fkins into what is called the tan, compofed of leaven, 
the bark of birch tree, and a iharp liquor made with oak 
bark. Lafdy, they place them in the tan vat, where 
they fprinkle them v.'ith a liquor made alfo of oak bark, 
and' from hence they rake them out to cu^ry or d>efi 
them ; in a word, to put the hnifhing hand to them. 

Mr. Bill. Very well, my little friend ; but do you 
know for what ufe (kins thus prepared by the tanners are 
intended ? 

Rich. Oh ! yes : they are made into flioes, boots, 
coach 'harnefs, and many other things, 

Mr. 



Uo T H E N E W 

Mr. BiU. Other things which do not require fo foft 
and pliLible a leather as that, fur inftance, of which 
gloves are made. 
Rich. Ohr no. 

Mr. Bill. Who is it, then, that prepares this fort of 
leather ? 

Rich. The Prcinner or fellmonger : but we have never 
been in the worklhop of any of thole who follow that 
bufinefs. 

Mr. Bill. Robinfon was nearly in the fame predica- 
ment. He had never been in the wcrkfljop either of 
tanner or fcllnionger, confequently he could not endea- 
vour to imitate either of tiiem, 

Edvj. Then how does the fellmonger manage his 
(kins ? 

Mr, Bill. He begins like the tanner, with this diffe- 
rence, that he does not fteep the fkins either in tan or 
in lime, (for this is aifo ufed by the tanners,) but he 
makes ufe of warm water, with bran and leaven, and 
afterwards a lee of aOies : — but we will go fome day 
and fee them at wcr':. 

Rich. If he had knov/n the biifinefs even as well as 
any {kinner, he could not have atcenipted to drefs Ikins 
for want of bran and leaven. 

Mr, BilU That 13 clear : fo that he was obliged to 
give up all thoughts of it, 

Edw. But haw* then, did he intend to employ him- 
felfi* 

Mr, hill. His thoughts v/ere employed night and day 
about building a little boat. 

Rich, What ufe did he intend lo make of \x ? 
Mr, Bill. Do you afk what ufe ? To try, by means 
of it, to return amongft his feilow-c-eatures, and to 
deliver himfelf from the folitude to which he was con- 
fined againft his will, and which was becone moredif- 
mal to him ever fmce he was deprived of fire. He had 
reafon to think that the eoncinent of America»^was not 
far off; and he was determined, if he had a canoe, be 
it ever fo fliglit, to face every danger, and land, if pof- 
fible, on this continent. Full of this idea, he haftened 
out one day to feek and make choice of a tree, which 
he might convert into a boat, by hollowing out the 

trunk 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 141 

trunk of it. With this defign he traverfed feveral parts 
of the ifland where he had never been before, and re- 
marked, on his way, feveral plants that were unknown 
to him, and on which he refv^Ived to make experiments, 
to find whetiier they would anfwer the purpofe of food. 
Amongfl others, he obfcrved fome ftalks of maize, or 
Indian corn, as it is called. 

Edvj. What, that fort of corn of which you have 
two fine ears hanging up in the back parlour ? 

Mr, BilL The fame. He admired the largenefs of the 
heads, or, more properly fpeaking, the ears, on each of 
which he reckoned more than two hundred large grains, 
clofely ranged, one befide the other, and refembling 
grains of coral. He had not the leall doubt but this 
corn might be ufed for food, or even for bread. But how 
was it to be ground ? How was the flour to be feparated 
from the bran ? How was it to be made into bread, or, 
indeed, into food of any fort, without the help of fire ? 
Notwichftanding all thde confidcrations, he carried off 
ibme ears of it with him., intending to fow the grains. 
** How do I know," faid he, ** but I may reap confi- 
derable advantage from thefe in the end ?" 

A little farthi;r on he dilcovered a fruit tree of a fpe- 
cies quire new ic him^ From mis tree hung vaft num- 
bers of large hulks, one of which he opened, and found 
in it about fixty nuts of a particular fort. Though 
ihey were not very agreea'.^Ie to the tatle, yet he put 
one 0: two of the ripeft hufes into his pouch. 

Rich, But what fruit might that be ? 

Mr. BilL They were cocoa-nuts, of which they 
make chocolate. 

Edvj. Ah f now he may have chocolate for the fu- 
ture. 

Mr. Bill. Not fo faft. In the hril place, he dees not 
know that he has chocolate-nuts in his polfeffion : be- 
fides, thele nuts fhould he roalled, then bruiHsd, and 
ground up with (ugar, and, we all know, he v/as as lit- 
tle provided with fugar as wifh fire. In order to im- 
prove the flavour of the chocolate, they commonly add 
different forts of fpices, as cardaruum, \anil!a, and 
cloves : but thefe were unneceffary niceties to be de- 
prived 



Mi T H E N E W 

prived of, which'^gdve him not ''the lead concern tn 
coinpuiifop witli He want of lire. 

At le:\^th he •'Jtne to another tree, which was as lit- 
tle known to him as the former. The friiit of it was as 
larp^e as that of the cocoa-nut tree, riu had neither hulk 
nor (ht'll : the whole was eatabk and of an exqcifite fla- 
vour. This tree was a'ib quite differently fhaped from 
the cocoa-nut tree. It did not confift, like the latter, of 
a trunk which riles ftrai.jit up its whole heipht, and 
bear? a topping of thick foliage ; but this had branches 
and leaves, like thofe of our fruit trees. He learned 
afterv. ards that it was the bread tree, fo called becaufe 
its fruit ferves the natives for bread, fon etimes juflfas it 
glows, but more commonly pounded and made into a 
fort of dough. 

He obferved, that the trunk of this tree, from its great 
age, was alt'^idy a lit:ie hollowed! on one Hde ; and im- 
mediately he thought 't would a: fwer for the boat that 
he had in contemplation, if he could only find me'n<; to 
ci.t it down and h llo^'. it fufficientf . But then to cut 
down fo ufefui i trte, while, or the r.rlier hand, it was 
uncertain whether be O-ould ever be ab'e to raa'e a 
canoe of it! — this tho'ght ftartled him. After weigh- 
ing every thing for and againfl i[,\in h^s own mind, for a 
long time, he c?rtfi:liy marked the Ipot, that he might 
find it ag;in, and went away without having determined 
upon any thing. 

In his walk he found, whjt he had long wiftjed for, 
a parrot's neft The dilcovery gave him a great deal 
Lff pleafure. He went towards it without the ^eall: noife, 
and was ftretching out his hands to clap them on the 
nefi, when the young parrots, which were ftrong and 
well fledged, took to Might, and efcaped froir^ him all 
but one, more Oov.' tlin the reft, which co'.'.d not gei: 
av.ay, and remained his prifoner. He haftened, t.'.ere- 
fore, home to Jiis habitation, more pkafed t^ian if he 
had found a treafure, 

£div. But what g: - idvantage did he expeiSt iVoni a 
parrot ? 

lilr. Bill. He hopi J , teach hin^ to pronouncL- lome 
words, that he m'.ghi » .< ^' th<' fatisi £tion of hearing a 
voice v;hich imitated that of man. As to us who live in 

ibciety. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 143 

fociety, who enjoy the happinefs of feeing men every- 
day, and hearing them, and converfing with them, we, 
perhaps, may look upon it as a very trifling and v.hlldi(li 
fatisfjftion which Rohinfon promifed to himfel^ from 
hearing the parrot's chatter ; but if we place ourfclves 
in the lame circumftances with him, wc (hall ea-ly be 
fenfible, that what to us, in our prefent condition, ap- 
pears but a (hadow of pkafure, muft afford fubflantial 
^tisfa<^\ion to poor Rohinfon in his ftate of folitu^e. 

When he came home, he made a cage as well as he 
could, in which he lodged his new gueft, placed it on 
one fide of his bed, and went to refl with a ^nind as hap- 
py and rejoiced as that of a man who had gained a new 
friend. 



.THIRTEENTH EVENING, 

j\/f^' ^i''- i have afTem' led you this evening fooner 
than ufual, becaufe, nrfy dears, I inte^ d to hold 
a confultation with yu before 1 go on wch the ilory, 

Tbe Children. Weil, papa, we are now all in our 
places. Whjt is to be the fuojecSt ? 

Mr. Bill it is a quellion whiud h^s difturhed Robin- 
fon's t\ 'nd ail night, and has not fulfered him to clofe 
•his eyes « moment, 

Ths O..^Uren. What could it be ? 

Mr. Bill. It is this. Shili he cut down the bread 
tree whic'i he faw the day before, or leave it (landing as 
it is, uncertain whether he Ihould ever be able to make 
a boat oi it ? 

Rich. I ihould be far from meddling with it, 

Edv:. For my part, I would cut it down. 

Mr. Bill. H'ir^ are two oppofite votes, one for cut- 
ting down, the other for prefer-'ing the tree. Ler us 
hear thofe who li-^.^ e not fpoken yet on the lubje<!^. 

Geo. I am of the lame way of thinking with Richard, 

Charlotte, And lb am i, papa ; we muft let tlie tree 
:^2ad. 



M4 THE NEW 

IJfury, No ; it mufl be cut down ; the unfortunate 
RoUinlon niuft Iiave a canoe. 

lUrriet. Indeed I think fo too. 

Mr\ Bill, The voices are divided, and equal on both 
t;des. Let thoie who are for cutting dov/n the tree 
come on my right hand, and thofe who are of the con- 
trary opinion on my left. Very well ; both parlies 
face each other. Let us now hear the reafons that each 
U'ill advance in favour of his opinion. Richard fljall 
fpeak firft, and tell us why he is forfaving the tree. 

Rich. Becaufe it bears a valuable fruit, and the 
fpecies is rare upon the ifland. 

EUnju. It is but an old tree ; the advantage of gather- 
ing fruit from it wiil not laft long. 

Rich. How can you tell that ? It has but a flight hol- 
ovv in it is as yet ; and bow many trees do we fee, the 
rrunks of which, though hoilcv/, do ntt hindel" them 
from bearing fruit for many years ? 

Harriet, Let Rohinfon only graft a few flips of this 
tree, he will be fure to prefervethe fpecies, 

Geo, Ay I Do they grow up and bear fruit fo Toon ? 
Four or five years may very well pafs before he has any 
uit. 

Henry, And is it not better to have a canoe, and re- 
turn to the fociety of men, than to fl:ay in his ifland, 
though he were to feed ever (o plentifully upon the f 
bread made of the fruit of this tree ? 

Rich. 'Why, ay, if the canoe could be finifiied fo very 
ibon. But how is he to cut down this tree ? How is he 
no hollow \t out, with nothing but a ftone hatchet ? 

Edvj. Let him \^ork with perfeverance ; let him not 
be impatient : I dare lay he wiil accomplilh it at laft. 

Geo, But he has no fail. What voyage can he un- 
dertake \i\ an open boat ? 

Harriet, He may ufe oars. 

ChatUtte, A pretty notion indeed ! Do not you re- 
member when we were in a boat down the river, near 
Putney, and one of the watcrmen"'s oars broke, he was 
obliged to go afhore and borrow another, as he faid we 
could not be rowed home with only one ? 

Ednv, Oh ! that was a large boat, and there were nine 
or ten of us in it. But Robinloa, in his little ficifF, wants 

«,^ nothing 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 145 

HOthing but a pair of oars to guide himfelf happily far 
away from his prefent folitary habitation. 

Mr. Bill, You fee, my dear ciiildren, the queftion is 
not fo eafy to refolve. N'>ne of the reafons that you 
have mentioned on both fides had efcjped Robin'bn's at- 
tention, hie had pafled the whole night in reflecting ; 
for to examine whether it be more convenient to do' a 
thing, or not to do it, is called rejle^ing. Ever fince 
Robinfon had felt the hitler confcquences of his hal^y 
refolution to travel, he had made it a law Vv^ich himfelf 
never to undertake any thing without firfl maturely re- 
flecting upon it ; and in the prefent caie, alfo, he deter- 
mines to obferve that law. Having turned the qaellioa 
and examined it in every point of view, he found it 
came to no more than this : Whether it be reafonable to 
facrihce a Oight, but certain advantage to a gre. t one, 
but uncertain ? Here he recollefled the fable of the dog, 
which, fwiramingacrofs a li.er with a piece of meat in 
hi^ mouth, loft it by endcivouring to fnatch at the re- 
flection of it in the water. He remembered, or. (h^: other 
hand, the cufiom of huibandmen, who facrifice grain 
which they might make ufe of, but do it wiih the hope 
of being richly reodid i>y a plentiful harveft. 

** Yes," faid he to himfelf, " the dog's greedinefs 
was folly ; he catthed at a vain {hadow, which it v/as 
iiripollible for him to polfefs. But the hope of the huf- 
bandman, on the other hand, is well founded, and his 
conduct fenfible ; he has in viev/ a real advantage, 
though, it is truc, fome accidents may hinder him irora 
obtaining it. 

'* Am I not, therefore, in the fituation of the farmer ? 
V/ith perfevering labour, may 1 not hope to fiicceed, at 
length, in making a canoe out of this old tree ? And if 
my hrft undertaking fucceeds, does reafon forbid me to 
expecEt th.tl may efcape from this folitary illand, and 
arrive, by means of my canoe, at fome place inhabited 
by men ?'* 

This thought, fo flattering to his warmeil; willies, 
made a lively impreilion on him \ fo that he itarted up 
that moment, took his hatchet, ran to the tree, and cut 
into it. 

G If 



146 T H E N E VV 

If ever he undertook a long and troiiblefome tafV, 
was certainly diis. A tlioiilhnd other men would have 
been diCcouraged ; the hatchet would have fallen out of 
their hands after the hrft ftroke ; they would have looked 
upon the undertaking, if not extravagant at lead as im- 
polfible. But we have feen already, that Robinfon made 
it a rule never to fufter himfelf to be turned from his 
purpofe when he had well confidered it ; he was, there- 
fore, unfha ken in his refolution of going through with 
this enterprize. Were it to coft him twice the time and 
fntigue that it required, yet the thought of giving it up 
would never enter his head. From the fun's rifing till 
about noon, he never ceafed working, and then his hand 
would have covered or filled up the hole that he had 
made in the trunk by the thoufands of ftrokes which he 
\au\ on it. From this we may form fome idea how long 
a time it will require him to cut down a tree of fuch a 
thicknefs, and to make a boat of it. 

Being convinced that it would be a work of fome 
years, he thought proper to regulate his occupations and 
divide his time, fo that each part of the day might have 
Its own work allotted to itl'elf. Experience had taught 
him, that, in a life of labour, nothing helps induftry to 
much as regularity, and a methodical diflribution of the 
work to the different hours of the day. I will give you 
an account of the divifion that he made of his time and 
hi^ occupations, each of which had its peculiar poitiori 
of the day to itfelf. He rofe at break of day, and v/ent 
directly to the fpring, where he waflied hi-s head, hands, 
bread, and feet. Having no linen to wipe himfelf dry, 
he let the air dry his body, and alFiiled it by running, as 
he generally did, Itraight home to the top of the hillock 
at the foot of v/hich his cave was fituated. His fight be- 
ing then hindered by no obje6t, he traverfed, at one 
view, all the beauties of nature that u^ere comprifed in 
this vaft Iio-rizon. The fight ele\ated his loul. 'In the 
pofture, therefore, which he thought moft refpedful, 
and in the fincerit; of his heart, he worlhipped and 
prayed to the Author of all Things j and never failed 
particularly to entreat that he would make his parents 
happy, whom, though he had foriaken, he never for- 
got. He then returned to his cave, and milked his 
lamas, which were nov/ encreafeJ in number to a little 

flock. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 147 

flock. He breakfaded on fome of the new milk, and the 
reft he put up in his cellar. Theie were the carts that 
employed the firft hour of the day. 

Now, being provided with whatever was neceffary to 
his fecurity or his convenience in working, he went 
down, if it was low v;ater, to the fea fide, where he ga- 
thered what oyfters he could fi^j/for his dinner ; if 
not, he repaired immediately to the tree of which he in- 
tended to make a canoe. His lam.as generally followed 
him, and grazed about while he was at work. 

About ten o'clock the heat was generally fo excefTive 
that he was obliged to quit his work. He then went to 
the fea-fide to look for oyfters, if he had not found any 
in the morning, and at the fame time to b.ithe, which he 
did regularly twice a day. Before noon he returned 
home with his flock. 

He now milked his lamas a fecond time, prepared a 
fort of cheefefrom the milk wh ch had curdlrd, and then 
laid out his dinner, which being tolerably frugal, was 
foon done. It confifte^l of new cheefe dipped in milk, 
fome oyfters, and half a cocoa-nut. There was one 
circumftance of which he had noreafon to complain, and 
that v/as, that he ha:^ not by half fo great an appetite in 
this hot country as people generally have in Cf.ld cli- 
mates : yet as he was accuftomed from his childhood to 
eating meat, he longed f^r it, and, in order to facisfv his 
wifli as far as v.-as p'-fti'^Ie, had recourfe to his fchcme of 
drying it in the fjn. At dinner rime, Jje amufed him- 
felf with his purot 5 he fpoke to it, and frequently .re- 
peated certain words, with the hope of hearing it pro- 
nounce fome -f them one day or another. 
Il^nry. ' What Ci\A he feed it with ? 
Mi\ Bill. Parrots, when they are wild, generally ^hqA 
upon cocoa-nuts, acorns, the feed of gourds, and other 
fuch matters : when tame, they are ftd v.'ith whatever is 
fit for a man to eat: fo that Robinfon was very well 
able to keep h s with cheefe and cocoa nuts. 

After dinner, he commonly repofed, himfelf, for an 
hour, either under the O.ade in the open air, or elfe in 
his cave furround-.d by his lamas, and with his parrot at 
his fide, bomeiimes, as he fit, he would fix his eyes 
upon thefe arimals, and fpeak to them (like a child that 
fpeaks to its dol!}, as if he expe^Sled them to underftand 
G i what 



148 T H E N E W 

what lie faiJ. So neccffary did he find it to communi- 
cate Iiis ideas and his (cntiments to living creatures, that 
he often forgot the impoHihility of his being underftood 
by the animals which furrounded him. When his par- 
rot, \Aliicli he called E^oll, repeated a word dillindly, in 
the height of his joy he would imagine that he had heard 
tlie voice of a man. He forgot ifland, lamas, panot, and 
all ; his fancy made him fuppofe himfelf in the midfl: of 
human creatures again. But foon recovering from this 
pleaHng illufion, and finding himfelf in a difmal folitude, 
he would Hgh heavily, and breathe forth this (hort ex- 
preifion of complaint, ** Poor Robinfon !" — About two 

o'clock 

Edvj. How could he always tell what hour it was ? 
Mr. Bill* He did as hulbandmen fometimes do; he 
obferved the height of the fun, and judged from thence 
that it was fuch or fuch an hour nearly. — About two 
o'clock he returned to the tree to work at his grand de- 
fign. He continued two hours each time at this labo- 
rious talk, and then returned to the beach to bathe him- 
f-lf again, and to gather more oyfters. The rell of the 
da) he fpent in working at his garden. Sometimes he 
fowed maize, or planted potatoes, hoping that, if he 
(hould ever have fire again, they might botl; be of great 
advantage to him. Sometimes he grafted from the bread 
tree; fometimes he watered the young grafts j fome- 
times he would plant a quickfet hedge to enclofe his 
garden ; fometimes he cropped the willows which fur- 
rounded the fpace oefore his cave ; he bent and fixed 
their branches in fuch a manner, that as they grew they 
might form a kind of bower. 

Much to Robinfon's grief, the longed day was, in his 
ifland, but thirteen h. urs. In the m.iddle uf fummer it 
was night at feven o'clock. V/hatever requited day- 
light for the performance of it, muft be finilhed before 
that time. Therefore, as night drew on, that is to fay, 
about fix o'clock, if he had no other more important bu- 
fmefs upon his hands,, he wenttiirough his exercife. 
Rich. Whdt does that mean, papa ? 
Mr. tilk It .iieans that he exercifed himfelf at flioot- 
ing with the bow, aid throwing the fpear, tha'. he might 
be able to defend iiimfelf if he fliould happea to meet 

with 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 149 

with a favage or a wild beafl: ; for he was never perfefl- 
ly free from the dread of thefe. Bj decrees, he ac- 
quired fo great a degree of dexterity in both the exer- 
cifes above mentioned, that he feldom mifTed a mark of 
the fize of a crown, though at a pretty good didance 
from him. When night came orr, he went home to miik 
his lamas for the tliird time, and took a moderate fup- 
per-by the light of the moon or (lars. 

Laftly, he crowned the labours of the day by medi- 
tating at night upon his own conduiit. Sometimes he 
v/ent to fit upon the top of the hillock, from whence he 
could bthoki the ftarry vault of heaven at one view, and 
contempLite it with admiration. Sometimes, alfo, he 
look a v/alk upon the Tea- fide, to breathe the air fre'.lien- 
ed by the evening breeze. Then he \yould afk him- 
felf — ** How have you fpent the day ? Having received 
freOi mercies, have you blefled the divine fource from 
which they flowed ? Has your heart beei filled with Io\ e 
and gratitude to your heavenly Benefaflor ? In your 
trouble have you put your confidence in him ? In your 
gratifications have you forgot him ? Have you rejected 
the evil thoughts that offered themfelves to your imagi- 
nation ? Have you fupprelTed the extravagant wifhes 
that rofe in your breaft? In a word, are you become 
reall}- better than you were ?" 

Whenever to thefe or the like queftions his confcience 
could return a good anfwer, and teftify that the ftate of 
his Ibul was comfortable, he fung a hymn to the praife 
of the Supreme Being who hadaflit^ed him in advancing 
one ftfp in the road to virtue. When, on the contrary, 
he had reafon to be not fo well pleafed with himfelf, the 
thoughts of having thus loft a day filled hiio with for- 
row ; for he counted the day loft when he had thought 
or done any thing which he could not approve at night. 
Whenever this was the cafe, then clofe by the notch 
that he made every day upon the tree which lerved him 
by way of aim mack, he made two notches croliing each 
other ; and this ferved to put l.'im in mind of his t^ult, 
that for the future he might be better on his guard, and 
not fall into the fame error. 

Thus, my dear children, Robinfon laboured to cor- 

re(Sl himfelf and to become better every day. Do you 

G 3 alfo 



150 T H E N E W 

alfo fincerely refolvc ro form your Iicarts to virtue? 
ndviCe you to follow the example that he now gives you. 
Lii^e him, referve an hour privately every evening, to 
give an account to yourfelves in tilence of the manner 
in which you have ipent the day ; and, if you find, 
cither in your thoughts, words, or actions, any thing 
which your conlciences dare not avow, keep a book 
wherein you may marie down the fame, to put you in 
mind of it from time to time, that, having before your 
eyts the fault of which you have once been guilty, you 
may ever afterwards take more care to avoid it. By 
thus labouring to improve yourfelves every day, you 
will alfo continually encreafe your own fatisfd6lion and 
happinels. 

My dear children, I doubt not that you will afford me 
every proof of your attention and docility, and this very 
night begin to put in practice the good advice which I 
have juft now given you. 



F O U R T i: E N T H EVENING. 

/i^/v. BILL. Yeilerday I gave you the particulars 
of Robinro.i'*s manner of living. Three years pafT- 
ed away, and it v/as ftill the lame. In all that time, 
and with fuch p-Jrfevering conftancy in labour, hov/ 
far do ye think he advanced in the making of his canoe ? 
Aias I he had fcarcely cut thiough half the trunkof the 
trs^e, and it ncv.' feemed a niatter of doubt to him whe- 
ther he couid cut down the tree in lefs than three or 
four years more, though he were to work with the fame 
cciiilant regularity as before. 

In" the mean time he never (lackened the work. What 
elfe, indeed, could he have undertaken ? '\nd, then, he 
was neither willing nor able to remain idle. One day 
the thcught ftruck him, that as long as he had lived in 
this ifliod, he had ^fitn but a very fmall part of it. He 
was angry vinh himfelf for his own weaknefs, when he 
rvflettcdthat fear was thecaufe which prevented him 
from traverfing the v^^hole of it, ** rerbaps," laid he, 

** had 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. iSi 

** had I been lels afraid, I niight Jiave difcovered many 
things which would at preil-nt be very uleful to me." 

This Cvonfideration determined him to let out the very 
next morning by day-break in order to take a \iew of 
the whole ifland. 

Eu<uj. How large might this ifland be ? 

Mt. Rill. Perhaps much about the extent of the county 
of Middlelex. I'hc fame day he m;:de every requifite 
preparation for his departure ; and the next morning, 
having loaded one of his ianias with provifions for four 
days, having armed and accoutered hirnlelf, and prayed 
for th^ Divir.c prottclion, he let out on his journey with 
conhdence. His defign was to keep as much as poiH- 
ble to the fea-fide, and to avoid forefls, that he might 
be lefs liable to meet with wild beads. 

His firll day's journey was remarkable for no extra- 
ordinary accident. He travelled about twenty miles. 
The farther he went the plainer he could perceive that 
the fituacion of his dwelling-place was in the barreneft 
part of the ifland. In many parts he found trees, luch 
as he had never feen before, which appeared to bear 
fruits capable of furnifljing him with a nourifhment as 
whokfome as it was agreeable. It was not until fome 
time after that he knew the ufefulnefs of them, and learn- 
ed their names. 

Amongft thefe trees was one called the paper mulber- 
ry tree, the bark of which is wrought into a fine fort of 
paper by the people of Japan, and makes a handfome 
fummer ftuff for the inhabitants of Otaheite. I will fliew 
you a piece of it, which I received as a prefent from a 
gentleman who had been with Captain Cook. Robin- 
fon flept the firft night in a tree, that he might be the 
more fecure from wild beafts, and at the fuftdawn of day 
he fet out again. 

He had not travelled far before he found him felf at 
the Southern extremity of the ifland. In fome places 
the Ibil was fandy. He had a mind to walk out upon a 
neck of land which extended pretty far into the fea, but 
fuddenly ftarting back, he grew as pale as death. He 
looked round him all in a tremble, and then, hanging 
bis head, fl:ood ftock flill and incapable of motion, as if 
he had been ftruck by a thunderbolt. 

G 4 Rich* 



152 THE NEW 

Rich» What was ilie matter with \vv.\ ? 
Mr. hill. His eye^jdilcovered what he never expeft- 
fd to find there, the tracks of n-jen's fett imprinted in the 
land. 

E(kv. What I does that frighten him ? I think he 
fliould rejoice at the figltt. 

Mr. Bill, I will exphin to you the reafcn of his 
fright. Upon his fiift beholding thefc bracks, he did 
rot reprefcnt to himfelf the men, whofe fteps had left 
the iniprelTions he faw, as civilized, numane, compaf* 
fionaie beings, ever ready to alliil their fellow creatures 
according to their power ; but he imagin^'d them to be 
barbarous, cruel, ferocious, ready, if they met him, to 
fal! upon him, cut his throat, and devour him: in a 
word, he did not fuppofe that civilized Europeant had 
been upon the fpot, but favages and cainiHals ; that is, 
as 1 before explained it to you, and which you could not 
hear without being fliccked, men whofe horrible cuflom 
it was to ft^d upon human fleO]. 

Rich. That idea is enough, indeed, to (hock one. 
Mr. Bill. It would have been better for Robinfon, 
had he been accuiicmed from his childhood not to give 
way to the impulfe of terror, even in the greateft dan- 
gers, and had he, at this moment, preferved more cool- 
iiefs and prefence of mind. We can all bring ourfelves 
to ir, if v/e will but pay an early and conftant attention 
td the rendering of our bodies, as well as our minds, 
found ar.d vigorous. 

Rich. But I do not rightly underfLand how we can 
bring ouifelves to this temper. 

Mr. Bill. By fortifying our bodies with fobriety, re- 
gi'i^ritv, and exercife, conformably to the intent ofna- 
ture, and by prefcrving our minds free from blemilh, by a 
lleadv and enlightened piety. 1 bus fortined, wefl-all be 
able to bear every change of fortune, and look upon danger 
W!fh an eye of indiiierence. Thus, my dear children, if 
"vou will always temperately confine yourfelves to thofe 
iorts offjod which are by fomiuch tlie more wholefome, 
as they are more plain and natural than others, and pre- 
pared with lefs luxurious nicety; if you will abftain 
nioie and more every day from delicacies, thofe poiions 

in 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 153 

in difguife, as pernicious to the health as they are agree- 
able to the tafte ; if you will avoid idlenefs, which is 
equally dertru6live to the body as the foul ; if, as far as 
lies in your power, you will accuftom your minds to a 
habit of attention and reflexion, and ftrengthen your 
bodies with a degree of exercife that inures you to mo- 
tion without exhaufting you ; if fometimes, on purpofe, 
and of your own free choice, you will abftain from a 
thing which would be very agreeable to you, which 
you even defire, and which it is perfectly in your own 
power to procure }ourfelvcs; if, upon other occafions, 
you contentedls bear with things thatfeem difagreeable, 
though you could avoid doing fo ; if, farther, you con- 
tTiS. the habit of not having recourfe to others, but, on 
tlie contrary, of finding in yourfeh'es a refource for all 
your want-, thus, as far as lies in your power, doing 
without the alfiftance of other hands, and ufing your 
own'^idgments in order to receive from your own fa- 
cuitits advice and afliftance in every trouble and diffi- 
culty ; if, lafily, you labour with care to acquire and 
preierve to }0urfelves the precious treafure of a confci- 
ence free from reproach, which alfures you of the pro- 
tectiun and favour of the Almighty: then, my dear 
cii Idren, you will gain, and you will feel yourfelves 
p'jfTcired of, ai the ftrength of body and mind that 
yov! are capable of poiYeAing. The mofi whimfical and 
nu'l undeferved changes of fortune will not trouble nor 
dWcomp.^e your fouls. The moft difagreeable events 
may cauie you Tome furf rife, but will liof'have power^ 
to fhrike your fortitude, nor to alter the ferenicy of your 
ruinds; ptriuaded that, under the government of Pro- 
vidence as wiie as powerful, nothii^g can poiiibly hap- 
pen v/iiich will not turn to your greateft advantage. 

RaSi fen, as you lee, had not yet reached, by iiis pro- 
grefs In true piety, that degree oftortitude fo necelUry 
to his happircfs and repole. This may be imputed, to 
the life which he had Jed for feme years, io trar^quii and 
fo unexpofed to danger?. In a flate of ^ on iiajxt tran- 
quillity, (mark well nis truth, my dear children,) in a 
fituation of perfecl fecuriiy, man never acquires all the 
cn.igy nor all the courage cf which his mind is fufcrp- 
tible. Dots it f J happen that he is fuddeuly pUced m

hygy riole trials which Heaven lends us from time to

ot knowing, of exercifing, and fircngthcning our courage 
by experience. 

'i ou remember into what a confiernation the unex- 
pe(5t(rd Tight of fome tracks of men's feet threw the poor 
aftrighcd Robinfon. He looks round to ever quarter j 
at the noife of every leaf he feels frefti terror. In the 
confufion of his fpiiits, he knows not what to refolve 
on: at lafl:, muftering up all his ftrength, he takes to 
flight, with the utmoft precipitation, like a man who is 
purfuedj and fo great is his terror, that he dares not, 
even once, look bjck. But fuddenly he flops ; his^fear 
is changed into horror. What an object rtrikes his eye f 
Ah ! my dear children, prepare yourl'elves for the moft 
ihocking fpedlacle in nature; the horrible confequences 
of man's depraved flate when totally abandoned to him- 
feir, and deprived of all education. ,He faw a round 
hole, in the middle of which was a fpace whereon a fire 
feemed to have been kindled, though it was then out. 

All round this hole — I ftudder while I relate it he 

perctived hands and feet, fculls, and other human bones, 
fcattered about, which prefented the horrible remains 
of an unnatural feaft, where a human body had been 
devoured. 

•7/6f ChiiJre}?. How fljocking ! What, by men? 

Mr. Bill. Can they be called men r They have only 
the outfide of men : without education, degraded, ren- 
dered brutalj and like the moft ravenous animals, nei- 
thtr the loathing which fuch an aflion would naturally 
produce, nor the compaffionate feelings of humanity, 
prevent them from following the abominable cuftom of 
murdering their fellow-creatures to feed on them. I hefe 
were their prifoners of war, on whom, after they had 
cut their throats and roafted them, they made a horrible 
feaft, in which their favage joy manifell:ed itfelf by 
dances and iongh or rather the howlings of gorged can- 
nibals. ^, ,

Cha>ht:e. Ob! the dcteflable creatures I 

Mr. Bill. Let us, my dear Charhtte, detefl their 
atrocious manners, and not their perfons : they have 
received no education, no inftrudlion. If you had 
been fo unfortunate as to have received your birth 
amongft tliefe favage people, you would, like them, run 
about naked in the woods, without the leafl (hame, ftu- 
pid and fierce as a brute bead: : you would paint your 
bodv and your face with various .olours, particularly 
red : you would make holes in your nofe and ears, and 
be very proud to carry in them» for ornament, birds 
feathers, fea (hells, and other trifles : you would, then, 
make one at the abominable fcaRs of your depraved rela- 
tions, and there take your fhare with as much pleafure 
as you do now at our bed: dinners. Rejoice, therefore, 
all of you, and blefs God that you belong to parents 
who were born and bred up in poiiflied fociety, where 
thev have leained, from therr infancy, to be humane, 
civil, police, and fiiendly, and not to negleft any thing 
that may render you alfo mild, agreeable, companionate, 
and fufcepcible of every virtue. Pity the unhappy lot 
cf thole men who being left to themfelves, fiill lead a 
favage life like that of wild beafts in the woods. 

henry. And are there any fuch ftill ? 

Rich. Far off, very far q^ from hence, in an ifland 
called Nev/ Zealand. Papa read us fomething about it 
IjCI: winter in Captain Cook's Voyages. The natives of 
that illand eat human fiefh j but, it is to be hoped, their 
intercourfe with our people will, by degrees, bring them 
to leave off fo barbarous acuftom. 

Henry. That would be well done. 

Mr. Bills Robinfon turned his eyes away from the hi- 
deous fpeftacle, i it made him quire lick, and he would, 
in all likelihood, have fainted, if nature had not relieved 
herlelf, by forcing him to throw up whatever was 
upon his ftomich. As foon as he was a little recover- 
ed, he fled away again Vv-ith fo much precipitation, that 
his lama could fcarcely keep up with him ; for this 
faithful animal followed clofe at his heels wherever he 
went. Fear hid fo taken poflTeffion of Robinibu's facul- 
ties, that he quite forgot iiis lama, and, hearing itsfleps 
dole by him, as he ran, had not the Icau doubt but 

ther-i 



1 56 T H E N E VV 

tlK^rc was a cannibal bcliind in clofc purfuit of him. 
Fil!<.u wJLh tills notion, he fled with redoubled fpecd, to 
efcapc from the imaginary lavage at his heels, and, in 
ordir to h<j lefs encumbered and ligliter in his flight, he 
threw away his Ijear, his bow, his arrows, and his 
hatchet. This might have been the moment to make ufe 
of them, but he never once thought of doing fo i in 
flight alone he placed all his dependence. But, in his 
fiiiiJ.i, he forgets whither he is running ; he regards not 
which way lie takes : the opened; ground is that which 
he prcfeis, let it led him wliere it will. Thus, after he 
had run for near an hour, it happened that he made a 
circuit, which brought him back to the very fpot from 
whence he had fet out. 

Here was new terror ! new perplex'ty ! He forgot the 
place ; he had no idea that it was the fame which he had 
leen before ; he takes it for a fecond proof of the horri- 
ble cruelty, the fight of which he was endeavouring to 
avoid. He turns away, therefore, from the fpot, and 
continues his flight as long as he has ftrength to carry 
him. At length, quite exhaufted, he falls dovvu with- 
out fenfe or motion. Here his lama, having ovcrtuken 
him, lies down befidehim, fpcnt with atigue. By mere 
chance it was the very fpot where Robinlbn had thrown 
away his arms; and ti.efe were the firft objeds ihat 
(Iruck his eyes the moment he opened them. Seeing 
his arms fcattered about on the grifs, he imagined him- 
felf in a dream, and that whatever had palTed was no 
more. He could not conceive by what means they were 
conveyed there, ncr how he came there himfelf; fo 
much had his fright difturbed all the faculties of his 
mind. 

He rofe now to leave the place, but his confufion be- 
ing Ibm.evvhat abated, he was pot fo imprudenr as to for- 
get his arms : he gathered them up, and iirmly relulved 
to part no more v/ith the on^^' means of his defence. He 
was fo weakened, that it was impoliible fot hiuj now to 
make fo much hafie as before, though equally urged by 
fear. He had-no appetite for the remainder of the day, 
and he never flopped but once, whic!i was only for a 
moment, at a Ipring, to quench his thiril. 

He 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 157 

He hoped to be able to get home that fame day, but 
found it impoffible. At night fall he was within a 
couple of miles of his own dwelling, at a place which 
he called his country feat. It was a pretty laree en- 
clofure, which he had chofen as a kind of park for one 
part of his flock, becaufe the grafs was better there than 
in the nirlghbo-Thood of his cave. The year before, he 
had lain there feveral nights in the fummer time, being 
grievoufly tormented with mufl^itoes Jt his old dwelling- 
place. For this realon he called the fpot his country 
feat. His ftrength beirig quite gor.e, he was not able to 
go any farther. Whatever danger there might be in 
palling the night in fo unfafe a place, necelTity obliged 
him t') ftop there. Quite worn out with fatigue, and 
his mind ilill agitated v.'ith fear, he lay down to take 
fome repoie; but fcarcely was he half afleep, when a 
frefb fubje^t cf terror "had nearly deprived him of his 
fenfes once more. 
. Rich, Poor fellow ! to what alarms he is expofed \ 

E'4iu, What was the matter, then? 

Mr. I'.ill, He heard a voice in the air, which very 
diilinctly uttered thefe words, ** Robinf:n, poor Ro- 
binfon ! where have you been ? How came you here ?" 

Rich, Blefs me! what could it be ? 

Mr. Bill. Robinlon fiarted up, all in a tremble, not 
knowing what to think. He hears the fame words re- 
peated ; he ventures to turn his eyes towards the quar- 
ter from which the voice came, and finds what 

think ye ? 

7 he Children. Nay, we can't tell. 

Mr, Bill, He found, what a coward, if^he would 
take the pains to examine before he gave way to his 
fears, would always find— that he had no reafon to be 
alarmed ; he found that it was no voice in the air, but 
the voice ot his own parrot, which was perched upon 
the branch 0I a tree dole by. 

The Lhil ren. Ha ! ha ! ha ! that is droll enough. 

Mr, Bill, No doubt the bird wd« tired of being left 
alone in the cave, and as it had many a time before fol- 
lowed icS mafter to the place where he now was, it 
came thither to ii?ek him, and pronounced the fame 

words 



158 T H E N E VV 

words which Robinfon had repealed to it hundreds 
of times. 

His fright war. now turned to joy at having found out 
the caufe of the falfe alarm. Robinfon flretches out his 
hand and calls ** Poll!" The bird flies to him, and 
welcomes him with a hundred fond carelfes, all the 
while crying, ** Robinfon! poor Robinfon! where 
have you been ?" 

Still reftlefs and apprehenfive, Robinfon fcarce clofed 
his evfs the whole night. He had for ever before Jiitri 
the horrid fpot which firfl occafloned his fright. He 
drove, but in vain, to banifli it from his imagination ; 
all his endeavours were to no purpofe. When once the 
irflagination receives a violent ftock, to what extremities 
does it caufe a man's thoughts to Vv'ander ? What a cloud 
of darknels does pilfion fpread over his rc-afon ? Robin- 
fon thought of a thoufand plans for hi"5 future fecurity, 
every one more extravagant than the other. Amongft 
the reft — would you believe it ? — be had formed the re- 
Iblution ot detlroying, as foon as it was day-light, all 
the works thit he had made, and net to leave a trace re- 
in..ir:ing ofal! that had coft himfo much labour. The 
copfe in which he now lay, and the hedge enclofing the 
whole park, were to be deilroyed j his lamas turned 
loofc ; his dwelling-place at the cave, and the Vvillow 
row, to be all demoiifhed ; his garden and trees to be 
grubbed up ; in fliort, every t'nng was to be facrihced 
to his iV.fety. He Vv'ould rot have the fmnllefl appear- 
ance reiitaining of any thii)g that might feera lo be the 
work of man's hands. 

Rich. For what reafon ? 

Mr. kill. That, if the favages Hiould chance to pay

compofe ourfelvcs to reft without having any thing to 
fear from the barharit)' of inhuman favages. 

The Children. Good night, papa ; much obliged to 
you. How agreeable has this evening's entertainment 
been ! 



FIFTEENTH EVENING. 

MY dear children, it is a good proverb which ad- 
vifes us to confidt our piltozv before we take any 
important refolution. Robinfon found the advantage of 
conforming to this advice. 

Y©u remember the ftrange refolutions which ' his ex- 
ceflive fear made him form. He was very happy that 
he pur" off the performance of them until the next day. 
Scarce had the mild light of morning dilperfed the (hades 
of night, when he faw things in quite a dirferent view. 
What he before judged prudent and neceffary, appears 
to him a fenfelefs and extravagant projeft. In a word, 
he rejedls all the hafty fchcmes that fear had put in his 
head, and he forms other plans which his fober judgment 
approves. 

Let his example teach you, that, in affairs which may 
be put off, you (hould not pafs from refolving immedi- 
ately to performing ; defer this latter till the next day, 
as often as you conveniently can. 

Robinfon now faw and acknov/Iedged that his fright, 
the day before, had been carried to an extravagant pitch. 
** I have been here," faid he, ** a long time, and no 
favage has ever yet come near my habitation, which is 
proof enough that t , y are not lettled in this ifland. It 
is moft likely that ey are inhabitants of another ifland, 
from whence fome of them come here now and then, to 
celebrate their vidtoiies by a hoirible feall: ; and proba- 
bly they never land but at the Southern point of the 
ifland, and return to their own country without having 
the curiofu) to come any farther. Ic is, ti.crefore, by 
the particular direQion of Heaven that 1 have been 

thfowfl 



i6o T H E NEW 

thrown on tliis part of the coaft, the lead fertile in the 
whole ifland. 'I'his very difadvantage is now the caufe 
of mv fccuritv. 

** Why fliouM I not hope that the fame good Provi- 
dence will continue to protect me againft all dangers, 
fince I hi\c hitherto been fo remarkably prcfcrvcd from 
the greatell ?" He then reproached himlelf bitterly for 
having the night before fliewn To little conhdence in his 
heavenlv Father. Filled with forrow and repentance, 
he threw himlclf proilrate on the gri->und,to implore pjr- 
don for this new fault. Having now recovered his 
ftrengih, he walked towards his cave to put in execution 
the new deligns which he had juH: formed. 

Rich. What did he propofe to do ? 

Mr. Bill. He intended to take fome proper mea" 
fures for his greater fecurity, which was very reafon- 
able : for although it be our duty to depend on Provi- 
dence, being peifuaded, that, while we conform our 
lives to the d vine precepts, we frail not be forfaken in 
time of need, yet, on our fides, we Oiould negle<St no- 
thing that may contribute to our happinefs or Iccuiity ; 
fur we certainly were never endowed with reafon, nor 
cur miads, nor even our bodies, enriched with fu<:h va- 
rious faculties and powers, for any other purpofV, but 
that we (hould, as far as in us lies, make them all unite 
towards rendering us more fecurely happy. 

The lirii thing that he did, was to plant, without 
f.de, at a fmall diTtance from tiie trees which enc'lofed 
the front fpace before his cave, a thick wood which 
niight cover it at a difiance, and hinder it from being 
L-en. ..,. 

With this dcfign, he planted, one after another, near 
two thoufand (lips of that fort of wijlov/ which he had 
before obferved to take-root and grow up in fo fhort a 
time. He took good care not to plant them in rows: 
on the contrar}', he avoided all regularity, on purpofe to 
give the whole the appearance of a nacural grov/th ra- 
ther than of artiticial arrangement. He refolvcd next to 
dig a fubterrarieons pafTage from the bottom of his case 
t& the other fide of the hill, that, 'm\ a cafe of extremit}, 
as, for inftance, when the enemy ihould have fcaL-d iiis 
bairicade, he might have a back-way to efcape by. 

Tins 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. i6i 

This was alfo a troublefome and tedious talk ; and you 
n-iufl: underftand, that, in order to have leifure for it, be 
was obliged to give up the making of the canoe for a 
while. 

Fn opening this fubterraneous pafTage, he began ex- 
actly as miners do, who firft dig a pit, and then a gal- 
lery. 

Geo. What fort of a gallery ? 

Rich, Do you forget ? I can tell you. The miners, 
in making a mine, firft dig into the earth ftraight down, 
as thofe do who are digging a well ; and this perpendi- 
cular opening they call a pit. When they are come to 
a certain depth, they begin to hollow it out horizontal- 
ly ; and this pallage they call a gallery. Thus they go 
on from pits to galleries, and from galleries to pits, until 
they come to the vein or bed of metal which they are 
feeicing. 

Mr. Bill, Very well explained. Obferve, that, when 
they dig thus fideways, or horizontally, the earth which 
is over their heads would foon crumble down, if they 
did not take care, as they went on, to keep it up : this 
they do by means ofcrofs planks, which reach from one 
fide of the paffage to the ether, and reft upon uprights. 
Robinfon took the fame precaution. 

Whatever earth he cleared out of it, he carried clofe 
to the hedge, and took care to level it. Thus, by de- 
grees, he raifed a terrace, about ten feet high, and al- 
moft eight thick. At convenient diftances, he had left 
openings, or port-holvs, that he might fee the out- 
country. He bad, bel'ides, made fteps to go up to the 
top of the terrace, in cafe he fiiould, one day or other, 
be obliged to defend his little fort from the top of his 
rampart. 

He feemed now fufficiently fecured agai»ft a fudden 
or ihort attack. But, then, if ihe enemy ftiould be ob- 
ftinate, and block him up for fome time, what are lo be 
his relources ? 

This blocking up was not a vain fancy : it was by no 
means impolhbie that fuch a thing might happen fom.e 
day or other. He thought it, therefore, necelTary to 
provide alio againftfuch an event, and to contrive means 
whereby he might avoid the neceihty of furreadering 

for 



i62 T H E N E W 

for want of proviHonf, or elfc dxingof hunger. To 
prevent any fuch extremity, he refblved to keep con- 
ftantiy within the enclofure, at lead, one of his lamas 
that gave milk-, and to have, by way of referve for the 
lopport of this animal, a (mall rick of hay, which was 
not to htr touched unle's in cafe of necelTity. , He was 
moreover relblved to lay upa ftock of cheel'e, fruits, and 
oyflers, and recruit it from day today, according as the 
one or the orlier became unlit to keep. 

He had thought of another defign, but was obliged to 
give it up, forefeeing that it would be too tedious intlie 
execution. He was denroua that the water of the neigh- 
bouring fpring, which farmed a fmall rivulet, might be 
conveyed, if pciFible, to the very door of his cave, that, 
in cafe of a fiege, he might not be deprived of fo necef- 
iary a conveniency. To effeft this, he would have 
been obliged to cut through a fmall hill, which, how- 
ever, was large enough to require a very confiderable 
time before the labour of a fingle man could complete 
fuch a cut. He thought it, therefore, better to give up 
the idea, and return to the making ofhis canoe. 

For iome years there happened nothing worth rela- 
ting. I haften now to an event which had more influ- 
ence on the lot of Robin fon, than all that had happened 
to him in his ifland as yet. 

One fine clear morning, as^he was working at his 
canoe, he perceived a very thick fmoke rifing at a dif- 
tance. The terror with which he was at firll: feized 
upon fight of this, gave way to curiofity. He haften- 
ed to the top of his little hillock to difcover the true 
caufe of the fmoke. Scarcely was he arrived there, 
when he was ftruck with confternation at the fight of 
five or fix canoes drav;n upon the beach, and a Icore 
or two of ravages dancing round a great tire, with 
the moil fantaltic motions and horrid cries imagina- 
ble. 

Though Robinfon ought to have expected fuch a 
fight one time or other, )et here again he was near 
falling into a iwoon with terror. However, this time 
he quickly recovered his fpirits, by placing his confi- 
dence in his Maker. He ran dovv'n the hrll to put him- 
felf in a pofture of defence, took his arms, implored 

the 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 163 

the afTilliance of Heaven, and firmly reiblved to defend 
his life to the laft extremity. Fortified in this refoliition 
by his piety, he found himfelf mafter of fufficient cou- 
rage and prelence of mind to go up again by his ladder 
of ropes to the top of the hill, from whence he was de- 
firous of viewing all the enemy's motions. 

Prefentiy his indignation and horror was raifed to the 
highert pitch, when he beheld them drag two unfortu- 
nate wretches from ihe canoes towards the place where 
the fire was. He fufpeaed, at firfi: fi;- ht, that they 
were going to difpatch them; and he very foon found 
that he was not miftaken. Some of thefe monfters kill 
one of the captives, and two others fall upon him, no 
doubt, in order to cut him into pieces, and prepare their 
abominable feaft. During this (hocking execution, the 
other priloner fat a melancholy fpedator of what was 
doing, in the expeflation of very foon receiving the 
lame treatment in his turn. But while theie barbarians 
were bufily taken up with the butchery of his compa- 
nion, he watches a moment when no body had an eye 
upon him, and, with the hope of efcaping death, he 
iuddenly ftarts away, and, flies with afloniftiing fwift- 
uefsdiredtly towards Kobinfon's dwelling-place. 

Joy, hope, fear, and horror, alternately feized on 
Robinibn's heart; they appeared fucceffively in his 
countenance, v/hich was pale and red by turns. He 
felt a joy mingled with hope, when he obferved the pri- 
foner to gain ground confiderably on his purluers : he 
was filled with tear and horror when he faw both parties 
coming as ftraight as pollible towards his habitation. 
They were feparated from it only by a fmall cieek, 
which the favage, who fled, muft crofs, by fwimming, 
to avoid falling into the enemy's hands. As foon as he 
came to the bank of it, he thew himfelf in without hefi- 
tation, and croffed it with the fwiftnefs that he had ex- 
erted in running. Two of thofe who were nearefl: to 
him threw themlelves in after him, and all the reft return- 
ed to their abominable feaft. Robinfon perceived, with 
much fatisfadtion, that thefe two laft were not, by a 
great deal, fuch expert fwimmers as he whom they pur- 
lued. He was landed before they had half crolTed the 
creek. At this moment, Robinfon was animated with a 

courage 



i64 T H E N E W 

courage and zeal, fuch as he had never felt before : his 
evfs Iparkled ; his heart throbbed, and feemed to urge 
him to the afllflance of the weaker party. He lakes his 
fpear, and, without hefitating, runs down from the 
top of the liiilock. In the twinkling ofan e}e he pafTes 
through the :^,rove, and, coming out on the other fide, 
finds htmtclf jull between the purfuers and the purfued. 
He cries to t!ie latter, " Stop ! flop !" but he, turning 
about, is terrified at the looks of Robinfon dreft up in 
(kins i he takes him for fome fuperior being, and hefitates 
whether to fnll at his feet or run away from him. Ro- 
binfon, ftretching out his hand, gives him to underftand, 
by figns, that he was his friend, and then,turning about, 
marches towards the enemy. When within reach of the 
foren^oit favage, he throws his fpear at him, and (Irikes 
him to the ground. The other favage, being about 
one hundred yards behind, Oops, quite furprifed, fixes 
an arrow to his bow, and difcharges it at Robinfon, who 
was coming up to him. The arrow ftruck him on the 
left breafl, where the heart lies; but luckily it came 
with no great force, and the (kins kept it off as 
well as a coat of armour could have done. The ar- 
rov/ fell at Robinfcn's feet, and he felt not the fmallefl: 
hurt from if. 

Our hero does not give his enemy time to flioot a fe- 
cond arrow ; he ruihes upon h'm, and, before the fa- 
vage can draw the bow-iUing, Robinfon lays himlife- 
lefs in the duft. 

He now turns towards him whom he had prote6led, 
and fees him dill on the fame fpoc motionlefs, betwixt 
hope and fear, doubting v/hether the action that he had 
juil been witnefs to, was meant for his prefervation, or 
whether he himfelf muft fall, in his turn, beneath the 
mighty blows of this unknown being. The conqueror 
calls him ; makes him underhand, by figns, that he is to 
come nearer. He at firll obeys, then itops, walks on a 
little way, flops again, advances flowly with evident 
mark.s of fear, and in the attitude of a fuppliant. Ro- 
binfon makes him every fign of friendfhip po!hble, and 
invites him to come clofe up to him. The favage ap- 
proaches ; but at every ten fteps prodrates himfelf on 

the 



ROBINSON CRUSOE, 165 

the ground, at the fame time to thank him and to teftify 
his fuSmiirion to him. 

Ro^ infon takes off his qialk, and Ic'ks at him with a 
mild, humane and frien^'v air. At thi? fight the 
fa\age hefirates no more, but flies CoWjr-^> his deiiverer, 
proftrates himlelf, kiffes the jound, takes one of Ro- 
bifilbn's feet and puts it on his neck, to fignifv that he 
was his flave. Bat our hero, who inew that he had 
more occafion for a ^riend than a flave, qui> kly hfld 
out his hand to him in a friendly manner, raifed aim up, 
and endeavoured, by ail the means imaginable, to con- 
vince him that he (honld be vi^ell ufed. However, there 
ilill remained fomething to he done. 

The firfl favage was wounded, but not killed. Be- 
ing now come to himself, he was gathering herbs arnd 
applying them to his wound to flop the blood. Robin- 
fon made the favage, who ftood near him, obferve this, 
who immediately fpoke fome words in return. • hough 
Robinfon did not unde^ftynd them, yet they plealed his 
ear by their novel' y, being the firfl (bund of the huiraa 
voice that he had heard for many years. The Indian, 
fixing his eyes aiternately upon Robinfon and his hu- 
chet, pointing to it with his finger, and then drawing 
his hand back again ftily, gave him 10 unde ftai«d that 
he defircd this weapon to difpatch the enemy. Our hero, 
thougli lotii to {bed human blood, yet ienfible ofthe ne- 
celiity of killing the wounded favage, gives his hatchet, 
and turns his eyes from feeing the bloody ufe that is 
going to be made of it. The Indian runs up to his ad- 
verfary, ftrikes off his head at a b'ow, and returns wi;-h 
the cruel fmiie of gratified revenge. Then, mak'iig 
a tiiouland wry aces, and throwing himfclfinto athou- 
(and odd poftures, he lays at Robinfon's {*iQt, by way of 
a trophy, the hatciitt, together with the bleeding head 
of the favage he had killed. 

Ro infon made ligns to him to gather up the bows 
and arrows of the ilrM^ and to follow him. The In- 
dian, in return, gave hiiU to underftand, by figns, that, 
before tliey went away, it would be proper to bury the 
two dead lavages m the fand, Lh*t, if the:r companions 
fhould afterwards come to feek them, they might not find 
any remains of them. 

Robinfon 



i66 T H E N E W 

Robinfon having fignifitd that he approved this pre- 
caution, the Indian fell to work with the aiUflance only 
of his hands, but with ih much aftivity and dilpatch, 
that in lei's than a quarter of an hour the two bodies 
Were buried. They then fct out together towards 
Robinfon's abode, and went up to the top of the hil- 
lock. 

Charlotte. But, papa, was not Robinfon guilty of 
murder? 

Henry. Oh ! thofe that he had killed were favages ; 
there was no harm in killing them. 

Chari'Aic. Yet ftill they were men. 

Mr, Bill. Certainly they were men, my dear Henry ; 
favages or civilized is not the point. The que(tion is. 
Had Robinfon a right to take away their lives? 

Rich. I think he did very right. 

Mr. Bill. And why ? 

Rich. Becaufe they were inhuman creatures, and 
would have murdered a poor wretch who perhaps 
had never done them any harm, 

Mr. Bill, How did Robinfon know that ? Might not 
the i'avage who was purfaed have deferved death ? The 
others were, perhaps, officers cfjuriice, acting under the 
authority of their fuperiors. Bcildes, who had made 
Robinfon judge between then^i ? 

Echv, If! chad not killed them, they would have 
difcovtied his retreat, and have told all their compa- 
nions of it. 

Geo. And they would all have come in a body, and 
have murdered our poor Robinfon. 

Henry. And devoured his body. 

Mr. bill. Why that is a pretty good reafon. You 
are not far wrong : he hid a right to do it tor his fecu- 
rity. Euc,-am 1 exculable in taking away another man's 
life that J n)ay prefer ve my own ? 

The U.Hureiu Yes, certainly. 

Mr, Bill. V/hy fo ? 

Rich, Becaule it is the will of our Maker that we 
preferve our lives as long as it is in our power : when- 
ever, therefore, any one goes about to deprive u-s of life, 
ic mull certainly be jull to prevent Iiim by taking away 
his, if there be no other means. 

Mr. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 167 

Mr. Bill. Without douht, my dear children, fuch a 
forced defence of ourfelves is aIIov/ab!e by all laws di- 
vine and human ; provided, hov;e^er, that we have ab- 
folutely no other means of laving our lives, than by de- 
priving the unjud: aggrelTor of his. But if, on the other 
hand, we dcftroy our enemy, when we have it in our 
power to prelerve ourfelves without doing fo, either by 
flight, or by the proredion of others, or, laftly, by put- 
ting it out of his power to hurt us, we are then guilty 
of murder, and amenable to the law. 

Remember, my dear children, to thank God that you 
were born in a country where the government has taken 
fuch proper fteps for the fecurity of our perlbns, that 
there is icarcely one in one hundred thoufand under the 
difagreeable nereflity of ufing fuch a legal defence for 
the prefervation of his life. 

This is enough for to-day. When we afiemble to- 
morrow evening, I lliail, perhaps, find fomething more 
to relate to you. 



SIXTEENTH EVENING. 

,^^A\ BILL, What (ball I read to you this even- 

The Child' en. The \ew Rob nfon Crufoe I 
Mr. Bill. Robinibn's lot, my dear children, in Vv^hich 
we are all fo de^^ply concerm?d, is Rill very uncertain. 
He went up, as 1 told you ycllerday evening, along 
wich the favage whom he had juft delivered, to tb.Q top 
of the hill behind his dwelling, being both of them ex- 
ceedingly uneafy as co what might iHil befai them. 
■^Ihe puiiure of their affairs was dangeroL;s and critical ; 
for, was it not very likely, that the fava.i^es, aff^rtjieir 
horrible feaft-, would Ui out to ierk their two compa- 
nions who were milling, ts weil as the vidini that had 
efcaped from them? iw Inch a cale, it cjuld not be 
doubted but they would difcover Ro'cin:oii's habita- 
tion. 



i68 T H E N E W 

tion, and, unirlng all their force?, have broken into it, 
and niair.icred Iiiin, together with his new companion. 

All ihele thoughts came into his mind, while from the 
top of a hillock and (heltered hy a tree, he took a view 
of (he favages, who, by their extravagant dances and 
horrid howlings, exprefTcd the joy that they kit after 
their barbarous feaO", He deliheruted how he fljould 
aft; whether to fly, or fhut himfelf up in his fort. His 
thoughts rifing to the Almighty Proteftor of Innocence, 
he foand in himfelf courage and refolution enough to 
choofe the latter determination. In order not to be per- 
ceived, he flipped behind the bufhes, crept to his ladder 
of ropes, made a fign to his companion to follow him 
and do as he did, and very foon they were both at the 
bottom. 

The Indian, feeing the commodious arrangement of 
every thing in h's deliverer's dwelling-place, was feized 
with furprife. His eyes had never beheld any thing fo 
well laid out. He felt the fame fort of admiration which 
a hufbandman would, who, from the wildeft part of the 
cou;nry, fliould hnd himfelf all of a fudden in the midil 
©fa palace. 

Robinfon endeavoured by figns to make him under- 
Aand what they had to fear from the lavages, if united, 
and that, in cafe they Ibould come to attack him, he was 
relolved to defend himfelf to the laft extremity, and 
even to death. The Indian undcrftood him, and imme- 
diately, with a refolute air, brandiOiesthe hatchet, which 
be (iill held, feveral times over his head, looks wich a 
threatening countenance towards the enemy as if chal- 
lenging then: to combst, and thus endeavours to alTure 
his deliverer that he was ready to defend hinifell cou- 
rageoufl). Robinfon appliuded thefe marks of ii.trepi- 
dicy, armed the Indian with a fpear, a bow and arrov/s, 
and placed him fentinel at a kind ot port-hole which he 
had made in his terrace, that he mi.;ht have a view of 
wlirttever palled in the empty fj.ace between that and 
the wood which he had planctd. 

About an hour afterwards, they heard, all at once, 
firarge and drt^adfui cries at a ditL.nce, which feemed to 
ccme from iri;ny fivages tcgeiher. They both prepared 
for combat, and, by their looks, mutually encouraged 

each 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 169 

cacli other to make the mofl: vigorous defence. The 
cries ceafed — prefently they began again, louder and 
nearer — they are fucceeded by a deep filcnce. — Quite 
near at hand — 

Chadotte. Oh ! papa, if they come I (liall run away. 

Henry. What nonienfe ! 

Geo. Do not be uneafy, Charlotte; Robinfon will 
contrive to defend himlelf. I am not in pain for him. 

Charlotte. You will fee ; they are goi-ng to murder 
him. 

Rich. Pfhaw, hold your tongue. 

Mr. Bill. Quite near at hand (houted a terrible hoarfe 
voice, which was repeated by the echo of the hillock. 
Already our two champions were in a pofture of de- 
fence; already their bows were bent : the hrd favage 
that ihewed himfelf mul> infallibly have received a mor- 
tal wound. Their eyes, all attention and fparkling with 
courage, were fixed on that quarter of the wood from 
whence the voice had been heard. Here I ftop. 

T?:^ Children. But what is the reafon of this long fi- 
lence ? Why does not papa go on with the tlory ? 

Mr, Bill, ^o furnifh you with a frelli opportunity of 
exerciUng yourfclves in the art of conquering your de- 
fires. You are all impatient to know the fuccefs of the 
bloody fight in which Robinfon feems on the point of 
engaging. If you abfolutely defire it, I am ready to 
fitisfy Your curiofity. But let me fee, fuppofe you 
were- your own accord, to fuipend it for to-day ; fup- 
pofe y v'vere freely to give up the gratification of your 
curiofity until to-morrow ? However, you are at per- 
fed liberty to do as you pleaie, and decide either way. 
Speak ; do you confent or not ? 

The Lhiluren. Yes, papa, we agree to it. — We (hall 
be in fome pain about Robinfon — but never mind, to- 
morrow evening will make amends — Heaven preferve 
poor Robinfon ! 

Mr. Bill. Your compliance, my dear children, fills 
me with joy. Amufe yourfclves, for the remainder of 
the evening, in whatever way is mod agreeable to you. 
1 am never apprehenfive that your time will hang heavy 
on your hands ; on die contrary, I r ther fuppcfe that 
}ou will think the call for fupper too wrly.

t:o T H L NEW 



S E V £ N T E E N T 11 E V E N I N G. 



Jlf^' BILL.. We laft night left Robinfon and his 
companion on the watch, to obferve whatever 
might be going forward on the outfide of the barricade. 
They continued on guard till it was almoft night ; but 
having perceived no enemy, nor heard any voice for 
Ibme hours, it Teemed very probable, that the favages, 
difappointed in their fearch, had returned to their canoes, 
and were gone back to their own ifland. They laid 
down their arms, therefore, and Robinfon brought out 
fometliing for fupper. 

As this day, fo particularly remarkable in the adven- 
tures of our hero, happened to be a Friday, he refolved, 
in fome meafure, to perpetrate the remembrance both 
of the da-y and the events which diftinguiflied it by giv- 
ing to the favage, whofe life he had faved, the name of 
Friday. 

Till now, Robinfon had fcarce time to look at him 
with attention. He was a we!I-made young man, about 
twenty years of age ; his complexion was fwarthy, his 
hair black and long, not woolly like that of the negroes ; 
his nofe v/^s (hort, though not very fiat, his lips fraall, 
and his teeth as white as ivory. In his ears he wore va- 
rious feathers and fhells, an ornament on which he 
feemed to lay no fmall value ; in other refpe<5ts he was

Robinfon, who had a proper regard for decency, 
would not go to fupper, though hunger called him prelF- 
ingly, until he had fitted a fkin for his new gueil, which 
ferved him by way of apron. He then made jigns to 
him to fit down belide him and eat his fupper.. Friday, 
as we fliall now call him, approaches Robinfon with all 
t\\e tokens imaginable of refpe6tand gratitudel'Jie falls 
down on his faeexjeibre him, and places the fodr«tf his 
deliverer on his own neck, as he had done before. .

have been ghdtc expreis it by a thouiand marks of Icirid- 
refs ; bur, not knowing the characSlcr of his new gueft, 
he thought it prudent, for his own fecurity, to keep him 
in a flate of refpedful fubje6lion, to receive his homage 
as due to. him, and, in a word» to a6l a^^ his fovere'gn for 
fome time. He made Ivm^ therefore, underftandby fignf; 
that he would take him under his protedion, but on con- 
dition, of perfetl obedience; that he fiiould perform 
whatever he was ordered, and abilain from every thing' 
which he, his lord and mafter, ihould, of his good wilt 
and pleaiure, forbid him. \¥hile he inftrudted him thus 
by fign?, he pronounced the word '''aciqu^. Fortunately 
he remembered to have once heard that the favages of 
South America call their chiefs and princes by thac 
name. 

By this word Friday under-locd, much better than by 
the figns which accompanied it, v/bat his mafter meant ; 
and, to fiiew that he accepted the condition of obeying, 
he repeated the word 'i'acijue feveral times with a loud 
voice, intimating thst he applied it to Robinfon, and 
fell down proftrate at his {^tt once more. To Hgnify 
what refpe<5t he bore to the royal authority, he put a 
, fpear into Robinfon's hands, and fixed rhe point againft 
his own breaft, (liewmg and acknowledging thereby that 
, his mailer had the puv/er oflife and death o v^er him. Ro- 
binfon, with the dignity of a morjarch, held out his 
hand to him, affuringhim of his protection, and ordered 
him again to he down befide him and eat his fupper, 
Friday, oat of refpeft, fat down on the ground, while 
Robinfon was placed on a (eat of turf. 

Here, my dears, you may^ fee an example of the fird 
beginning of kingly power in the world. Men, who 
excelled others in wifdom, ftrength, and courage, were 
the firft kings. Weak men implored the prote^lion and 
help of theftronger, either to defend them from the dan- 
ger of wild btafts, which were-, in early times, more 
numerous than at prefent, or to fecure themfelves againft 
the injuftice of -/iolent men. In retJjrn, they promifed 
to fubhiit entirely to them, and to pay them every year 
a certain part of their fruits and fiock'-, that the protec- 
tors, not having 16 provide for the:'r own lubliilence, 
:night be wholly at ieifure to defend their fubjefts. This 
H 2 yearly

Teaily payment, Vv'Iiich the iubjeCls oMiged thcmfelves 
to n*ake good to their king, was called by the name of 
trihutcy imp'^py public /ja^j, and the like. Such is the 
oiigiii both of the power and riches which all the differ- 
ent fort of rulers in the world enjoy, and of the duty 
and fubmillion which their fubjefis pay them. 

Robinfon was now, iherefore, in effed a king. The 
illand was his kingdom, his lamas and his fruits were 
his treafure, and Friday his fubje£t j his only ne, it is 
-true, but a valuable one. His parrot was ■ only 
courtier that he had, and almoft ufelefs in that charac- 
ter. Nevcrthelefp, his majefty of the illand vouchfafed 
^tj^to defcend even to his vafTal as far as his dignity would 
^-,^rpermit him. 

Henry. What is a vaiTal ? 

Mr, ^ML The fame as a {lave. — After fupper, it 
pleafed his majefty very grscioufly to give orders con- 
cerning every thing that he chole to haveoblerved in the 
ceremony of going to bed. It was not prudent that Fri- 
day, whe had been fo lately advanced .to the ftations of 
h]s/u6jed znd prime minijiery his commander in chief and 
his vShole crmy, his mnftir of the korje ^ndfleitard oj the 
houfeh&lc/,\\\^ chamberlain SiTid ^room of the /hie \ it was 
not prudent, I fay, that this nev/ fervant fbould fo foon 
repofe in the fame chamber with his majefty. He, there- 
fore, judged it proper that he (bould pais the night, not 
in the cave, but in the cellar. How could he refolve 
to trufl his life, and the fecret of the fubterraneous paf- 
fage, to a flranger, whofe fidelity, having not been yet 
fufficiently tried, was far from being eftablifhed ? He 
therefore ordered Friday to make up a bed of hay for 
himfelfin.thecellaf, vvhilft his majefty took the wife 
precaution to carry, with his own hands, all the wea- 
pons into his bed-chamber. 

Afterwards he was not afhamed to appear publicly, 
before all his people, in the moft humble and ruftic em- 
ployment polhble. This adlion, perhaps the only one 
of its kind, v;ill no doubt furprife you, and you would 
hardly believe it^ if I did not alfure you that it is found 
in clear and exprefs terms in, the annals of Robinfon's 
reign, which have been made public to the whole world 
mSny years ago, Robinfoa Crufoe, king of a whole 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 173 

ifland, abfolute mafier of the life and death of all his' 
fubjetls, did not bluft, in the leafh, to defcend, in tlie 
prel'ence of Friday, to a fervile office. He went to the 
lamas that were kept in his enclofure, and with his own 
kingly hands began to milk them. It was mdant for the 
infl:ru£tion of his prime miniOier, and to (hew him hov/ 
to do the fame, as h<2 intended, for the future, to com- 
mit the care of this bufinefs to him. 

Friday, with all his attention, could not underdand • 
what his mafter was doing ; for neither he nor his ftupid' 
countrymen had ever fulpe6led that the milk of ani«ials 
might be proper food for man, and as wholefome a? it 
was nourifhing. He had never talked any, and was agree- 
ably furprifed atthe fweetnefs of it, when Robinfon per- 
fuaded him to put fome to his lips for a trial. 

After the fatigues which they had fuffered during the ^ 
day, they both found themfelves in want of repofe. 
Robinfon, therefore, ordered his flave to go to the place 
of reft which he had pointed out to him, and lay down, 
himfelf, bleffing Heaven for having, in one day, pre- 
ferved him from fo many dangers, and given him one cf 
bis fellow-crea.tures to be his companion, and, perhaps^ 
bis friend.

EIGHTEENTH EVENING. 

I CH A R D. I am curious to know what Robinfort 
will undertake now with his man Friday. 
• EdvL\ Now, that he has affiftance, he v/ill be able to 
perform many things which he could not before. 

Mr. hill. My dear children, you will fee every day 
more clearly what great advantages man derives from fo- 
ciety, and what reafon we have to thank Heaven for 
having fo deeply engraven on our hearts the inclination 
that leads us 10 feek the company and friendfhip of our 
fe-ilow-creatures. 

The firft thing that Robinfon did the next morniflg, 

v/a^ to go with Friday and examine the fpot v/here the 

H 3 favages 



174 T H E N E W 

favarres had held their abominable feaft the day before. 
Jn their walk, they came to the place where the t^A'o 
Indians were buried whom they had flain the day before. 
Friday pointed it out to his maOer, and plainly hinted 
that he was defirous of digging up the dead I oJics and 
fatisfying his unnatural appetite upon them. Robinfon, 
with a look of detedation and horror, (hewed him how 
much hedifliked fuch an inclination, and, lifting up his 
l^^ear in a threatening raann.^r, fignificd to him that he 
pj^ji'ould run it through his body if ever he touched them, 
^-iday underdood his mafler's threatening, and fubmit- 
^^tcd', without befitation, to his orders ; yet he could net 
conceive wh) he was forbidden to talle a fort of food, of 
♦ which, from his earlieft youth, he had always been ex- 
tremely fond. 
^ They foon arrived at the place of the feafl. What a 
fight ! The ground iUined with blood ! Bones fcattered 
about ! Eiobinfon turns his eyes away from it, and or- 
ciered Friday .immediately to make a hole, and bury thefe 
loathlome remairs of barbarous voracity. 

Vv'hile Friday was at work, according to his orders, 
Robinfon was carefully llirring the afljes backwards and 
forv/ards, in the hopes of ficding fi^ie fire fiill amongft 
them : but to no purpofe; the whole was extinguilbed, 
much to Robinfon's diiTdtisfailion, .who, next to the 
valuable gift vvhich Heaven had lately made him in his 
companion, had now fcarce any thing left to wifh for, 
except a fire. While he hung his head and looked for- 
rowlully upon ihefe allies, the remains of fire totally ex- 
tinguifhed, Friday, feeing him fo melancholy, made fe- 
veral figns which Robinibn did oot at ail con)prehend ; 
then he fnstches up the harchet, flies off like lightning, 
dc\n:, into the wood, and leaves Robinibn, v/ho knew noc 
iH's defign, in the greateft aftonifiiment poi^ble. 

Havingfo}lov,'ed him v.-ith hiseyesas long as he could, 
** What car: this mean r" faid he; " Can the ungrate- 
ful fellow intecd to forfake me ? Can he be treacherous 
erfough to take poffeifion ot my dwtlling-p.'ace, and 
keep me out of it by force ? Or would he liave the bar- 
barity to deliver me up by ftratagem to his favagc coun- 
trymen ?" — Korr^d tiiought l-^Tranfported with rage, 
he feizes his fpear, a: d fcts cut in purfuit of the un-

grateful traitor, at once to punifli and prevent his hafe 
attempts. Already he was running fu!! fpeed, when, 
fuddenly, he perceived Friday returning as fafl:. Ro- 
binfon ftops in a furprife ; he fees, to his no fmall afto- 
nifbment, the imaginary traitor holding up in the air a 
fmall bundle of dried grafs, v/hich firft appeared to 
fmoke> and then to be on fire. Friday throws it down, 
and haftily gathers round it other grafs and dried 
branches, and kindles a bright clear fire, which fiils Ro- 
binfon with joy and aftonifbment. He then underftood 
the reafon of Friday's fudden abfence. Not able to con- 
tain his joy, he flies, with tranfport, to Friday, embraces 
him v;tth ardour and afi^ection, and, In his own mind, 
afks him pardon, a thoufand times for the injurious fuf- 
picions that he had entertained of him. 

EJw. But where could Friday have found fire ? 

Mr, Bill, He had haftened into the wood on purpofe 
to cut two dry branches. Thefe he had rubbed toge- 
ther with fuch dexterity and dlipaich, that they took fire 
quickly. He then wrapped them up in dry grafs, and, 
running fwiftly v.ith his bundle held up in the air, the 
fire foon kindled the grafs, and broke out in a blaze. 

Mr. Mered, Here, again, Robinfon appears to me to 
be very much to blame. 

Rich, In what refpeft, pray ? 

Mr, Mered, In this ; that, without having any fuffi^ 
,cient proof of Friday's treachery, he forms, in an inftant, 
the blackeft fufpicion of him. How is it poflible to be 
io excelFively difiirufiful ? 

Rich, What he feared might very well be true ; fo 
that he had a right to be upon his guard againft 
Friday. 

Mr. Mered, Underlland me right, ray dear little 
friend. I do not blame Jiim either for thinking it pol- 
fjble that he was betrayed by Friday, or for running after 
him to prevent the fatal defigns that he might have form- 
ed. This precaution was allowable, nay necelTary, 
v/ith refpe<5t to a perfon totally unknown to him. But 
what I am angry with hiai for, is, that he never doubt- 
ed a moment the truth. of his odious fufpicions j that he 
fuftertd himfelf to be franfforted with rage; that he 
v/as fo wholly maftered by this palnon, as never even 
H 4 once 



176 T H E N E W 

once to think that Friday's intentions might beharmlefs. 
Now, our dilbufl of other men (hould never go fo far as 
that, unlefs we had already received certain proofs of 
their rtcachery. In a doubtful cafe, let us fee the evil 
of another man — till then let us judge well of him. 

Mr. Bill. A good maxim. Attend to it, my dear 
children, that you iiiay put it in practice hereafter. 

Robinfon, as I told you, was traniported with joy to 
find his ill fu'picions groundiofs, and himfeif once more 
in pofTclTion of tire, of which he had been fo long de- 
prived, and which he had fo longand l"o earneftly wilted 
for. He delights to bthold the waving motion of the 
flames. At laft he fnatches up a burning branch, and 
haflens with Friday to the cave. 

He inftantly lights up a large fire, and places pota- 
toes round it to roafl. He next runs to his flock, chufes 
out a young lama, kills it, and, having flcinned and cut 
it up, puts a quarter of it on the fpit, which he inftru6ts 
Friday how to turn. 

While he is thus employed, Robinfon cuts off a piece 
from the breaft of the lama. He then peels a few po- 
tatoes, bruifes and grinds fome maize between two fiat 
ffonts to make flour of it, and puts the vihole into one 
cf his pots, which, after he had poured in a fuflScient 
(luantity of water, not forgetting lalt, he fets over the 
lire. 

Ge/!, I know what he was going to make — fome 
broth. 

' Mr. Eilh The very thing. He had not tafl:ed any 
for e ght years paft. You may guefs how much he 
10 ged for fome. 

Friday looked on while all thefe preparations were 
making, but did not underfiand to what purpofe they 
v.'ere nade. He was acquainted, indeed, with the cuf- 
tou^ cf roafiing meat ; but, as ta all the reft of Robin- 
fori's cookery, he was entirely in the dark. He knew 
not even the elfeil whicii fire would produce on a veffel 
full of water. The pot began to boil jurt as Robinfoa 
went into the cave upon fome occafionor other. Friday,' 
farpiifed at this odd appearance, had no idea what could 
thus put the water in motion. But when he faw it bub- 
ble up and boil over the fidesjTie imagined, in the Hm 

plicif 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 177 

pllcity of his heart, that there mufl: be fome living crea- 
ture at the bottom of the pot, which occafioned this tu- 
mult in the water ; and, therefore, led it fnould boil 
away entirely, he put his hand in to feize the creature, 
whatever it was ; but, inftead of finding that, he felt 
fomething wjiich made him roar loud enough to flmke 
the whole hillock. 

Robinfon was ftartled, on hearing him cry out. Mis 
notion was that the favages had furpiifed them, and that 
Friday was already taken. Fear, and the natural inftin6l 
cf felf prefervation, urged him to efcape, and lave his 
life by the fecret paflage under ground ; but he quickly 
rejefled this idea, confidering hov/ bafe it would be thus 
to abandon his fubje6l, or rather friend. Without hefi- 
tating, therefore, he Tallied forth from the cave, firmly 
refolved to (bed the laft drop of his blood, if nccefTary, 
in refcuing Friday, once more, from the hands of his 
barbarous enemies; 

Mr. Mered. Now I like you, my friend Robinfon. 

Mr, Bill, He fpiings out, with his fpear in his hand ; 
but, to his utter aftonilbmenr, finds Friday ail aloni>, 
crying, twifiing himielf about, and uiaking a tiioufand 
wry faces. Robinfon flood motionlefs, not knov.'in;^ 
what to think ; at length he found, aft^r a few figns by 
way of explanation, that all this out-cry was occafioatd 
by poor Friday's fcaldinghis hand. 

Robinfon had no fmall difficulty in quieting him. But 
that you may knov/, what Robinlon did not learn unijil a 
year after, when they vyere both able to undcrOand each 
other ; that you may know, I fay, why Friday had made 
fach a nolle and fo much ado, I mull fiifl: inform you 
what notions ignorant people, in fome eounrries, who 
have had no inliruCtion in their childhood, commonly 
■ entertain.when an accident happens to them of whicli 
they know not the reafon. 



ein?" 



£■' 



Thefe poor people imagine that fome invIGble b 
cr fome fpirir, is the caufe of every thing for which they 
cannot affign a reafon. According to chem, this fpint 
never does any thing but by the orders of a perfon to 
whofe fervice it is bound. They diftinguilh, by a par- 
ticular name, thofe whom they fuppx)re to poifefs fucha

power over one or more fpirits ; if it be a man, thev 
call him a conjurer ; if a woman, a witch. 

For inOante, in Ibme places, if an ignorant country- 
man has cicht-r of his citi'.c fill fuddenly ill, and cannot 
guefs its diforder, lie, pt?ihaps, will be weak enough to 
thinlc that loir.e old p^^ri'on in the ncighbouihocd has be- 
witched the bead ; that is, made it full Hck by means of 
'an evil fpirir. 

Charlotte. Yes, papa ; jufl: fo Nanny, our dairy- 
maid, laid the other day, when one of the cows v/ent 
dry all of a fudden. 

Mr. Bill. My dear Charlotte, you fhould try to con- 
vince the poor girl of her error; it will certainly be bet- 
ter for her to be undeceived. 

If, on the one hand, ignorant people give credit to 
thefe filly notions, there are not wanting, on the other, 
impoflors who turn fuch credulity to their own advan- 
tage, and cunningly trick thofe out of their money who 
are ih ws-akas to believe in vritchcraft, or conjuring : 
for, by pretending to the art, they confirm the others 
in the notion that there is really fuch a thing. Under 
the name of conjurers and fortune-tellers, they proniife, 
V. rth an air of confident gravity, to br^ak the charm, and 
force the evil fpirit to Icofe its hold; but they always 
demand, for their trouble, a certain recomp'jnce, v. hicli 
as to be paid them before-hand. In return for this, they 
amufe thtir eiDployers with empty words, ridiculous gri- 
^7!aces, unn-eining geftures, and nonfenfical mummery, 
if the beatl's illnefs eeafes of its own accord, the for- 
tune-teller tnumphs, and the cretlulous man, whom he 
i,as deceived, h difpofed, m.orc than ever, robe the dupe 
of fuch impoliure. O^ the contrary, if the ficknefs gets 
i)riQ better, and the beall; dies, the conjurer v/ill, by his^ 
evsHonsand unintelligible cant, impofe on the ignoranC 
cv/ner, who v/ill afterwards be as ready as ever to con- 
sult a fortuue-teller upon ihe iame occafion. 

\n proportion as men's underftandings are narrowed 
by prejudice and darkened by ignorance, the more they 
iire inclined to this ridiculous fuperftition : you may 
ia.agine, therefore, that it is pretty generally received 
amongft fava.e nations. Whatever crofs accidents hap- 
pen to theiii, of which their weak reafon cannot point

out the caufe, they attribute them to evil fpirits; and 
this was exatStly Friday's cafe. 

l-je had never heard it faid, nordifcovered by his own 
experience, that v/ater coulH be made to boil ;' nor had 
he ever felt the effeft of it in thit llate, by putting his 
hand into it; fo that he could not conceive whence that 
acute and fudden pain proceeded, which he felt on 
touching the boiling water, and, tiierefore, firmly be- 
lieved that there was enchantment in it, and that Ro- 
binfon was a conjurer, 

I am going to put you on your guard, my dear child- 
ren, that you may not be deceived in ihefe matters. You 
will often, in the courfe of your lives, have occafion to 
fee effeCls of which you will not be able to difcover the 
cauies. You will meet with jugglers, perfons who deal 
in fleightofhand, who will frequently furprife you with 
the ingenious tricks and devices that they fhcw, but 
oftener by the dexterity wiih which they perform them. 
For inftancc, they will change, to all appearance, a 
bird into a raoufe; they will cut a bird's head off, and 
afterwards Ibew it to you alive and well ; in fhort, they 
will perform feveral tricks of the fame nature,- and you 
Ihali never be able, with the greateil ariention, to find 
out the manner of perfurming them, ir, on fuch occa« 
fions, you fhould be tempted to believe that there is 
witchcraft in the matter, remember Friday, and be af* 
lured that you are in the fame error with him, and take 
that for fupcrnatural, which, when explained, appears 
perfectly natural and eafy. But, to give you a proper 
idea of this fubject, we will, at fom.e convenient oppor- 
tunity, (hev/ you one or tv/o of thele tricks, and, at the 
fame time, explain to you how they arc performed, chat 
you liiay be able to form a judgment of aJl ©th>;rs of the 
lame nature. 

Robinfon, as I told you before, did noteafily fucceed 
in comforting Friday, and perfuading him to take liis 
place again at the fpit. He conlented co it, hov/ever, at 
laft, but could not help looking dill at the pot with a 
mixture of curiqfity and horror. As to Pvobinlon, whom 
he took for a fupernatural being, he could not lift his 
eyes towards him v/ithout fljewing the mofc timorous 
refpe6l. What confirmed hiia in his opinioo was' his 

mafter's 



iSo T H E N E W 

mafler's ruddy complexion and long beard, which gave 
him an ajrpearance fo diflerent from that of Friday and 
his tawny, bedrdiefs countrymen. 

Ediv. Muve the fuvages of South America no beard ? 

Mr, Bill. No ; and it has been long thought that they 
were beardlels by nature. But Tome pretend lately to 
have obiervedihat the realon of their feeming to have no 
beard, is their taking the greateft care imaginable to 
pluck it up as it grows. 

But the broth, the potatoes, and the road meat, were 
row ready. As they had no fpoons, Rohinlbn poured 
out the broth in two pipkins, but nothing could induce 
Friday fo much as to talk it ; he had not the leaft doubt 
cfits being an enchanted liquor. It made him Ihudder to 
lee Robinion fip it with io much appearance ^of fatil- 
faftion ; but he iielped himfelf to the road meat and po- 
tatoes, which made him amends. 

You may cafjly imagine how delicious thefe nourifii- 
ing victuals drefi properly on the fire, muft feem to Ro- 
hinlbn. I'hey made hirn forget all his paft troubles and 
hardfl^'p?. He imagined himlelf not in a defert ifland, 
but traniported to lonie populous country. Thus Pro- 
vidence, in an iniVant, by a flow of unexpected hap- 
pinet?, cures thofe wounds which ha'fe been made in 
our heart?, and which, though intended for our good, 
tjje I'enfe of prefent pain makes us ever regard as the moil 
incurable evils. J hardly need tell you, that Robinfon, 
in chat happy moment, remembered the Giver of all 
good Things, and thanked hirn from the bottom of his 
heart. 

1 !;e meal being finifhed, R.obinfon retired to mcdl- 
rate ftrioully on the happy change of his fituaticn. 
iivery thing round him wore a more fmiling fate. He 
was no longer folifary j he had a companion, with whom, 
it is true, he was not able to converte as yet; but the 
very company of this man was fome faiisfaftion to him, 
^ud promifcd to afford him the mod valuable afliilaace. 
^Befides, being no longer deprived of fire, he might en- 
joy as wholef.m.e and agreeable vi<5tuals as he could 
wifli. ** What is there to hinder you now," faid he, 
** from li\ing contented and happy ? Enjoy in peace 
th<f n^any benefits which you have received frcm Hea-

ven. You have fruits in abundance, and a numerous, 
flock, which will always be more than fufficicnt to fur- 
ni(h yowr table with whatever you defire. Make amends 
to yourfeir, now, by eafe and good cheer, for the fatigues 
you have lufi'ered, and the fcantinefs of your provilions 
for thefe feveral years paft. Let Friday, who is young^ 
and flout, work for you. His fervices you have a right 
to claim, as you have faved his life at the rilk of y6ur 
ov/n." 

Here an idea occurred to him which totally changed 
the complexion of his thoughts. 

** But,"faid he to himfelf, ** what, if you were very 
fcon to fee an end of all this profpetity ? If Friday were 
to die ? If your fire were to go out again ?" This re- 
flection made his blood curdle with horror. 

** And if, moreover, by being accuftomed to an eafy, 
delicate, inactive life, you were to render }ourlelf inca- 
pable of fupporting a hard, folitary, and laborious vfay 
of living, fuch as you have already experienced? If 

you dioiild be forced to return to it? He fighed 

heavily. 

** To what, then, are you principally indebted for 
getting rid of the many faults and weaknel?es which once 
difgraced you ? Is it not a fober and laborious life which 
circumflances forced you to purfue ? And now, by in- 
dulging youfelf in fenfuality and idlenefs, you would 
run the ri(k of lofing that health and ftrength of body 
and mind which temperance and exercife have procured 

you. Heaven forbia I" With thefe word?, he role 

haflily, and walked about in a thoughtful mode before- 
the mouth of his cave. iMean tirne, Friday put away 
the remains of the dinner, and, by his maRci^s order, 
went to milk the la«ias. 

Robinibn continued to reafon with himfelf. ** If 
you were to renounce labour and temperance, you would 
loon forget both the adverfity which you furmounted, 
and the friendly hand which affifted you. Very foon 
you would become ungrateful, prefumptuous, and, per- 
haps, impious." Horrid idea! and falling on his face 
to the ground, he prayed to be prtferved from fo dread- 
ful a (late of depravation. Tliis led him to take a refo- 
lution as prudent as it wi2 unalterable.

** I will/' faid he, ** partake of the gifts of Heaven,

fiinple victuals fhall be my favourite food, let my provi* 
fions be ever ib abundant and various. I will pcrfevere 
in my labours with the fame afliduity, though they will 
no longer be fo neceflary to me as formerly. One day 
in each week 1 will live on the fame cold victuals with 
which I have hitherto fubfifted my felf; and the lafl: day 
of each month I will confine myfelf to the fame folitude

Ihall pafs that day there." 

Having formed thefe refolutions of felf-denial, he felt 
the pleafing and pure fatisfa6tion which ever accompa- 
nies the elforts that v/c make to attain a higher degree 
of perfedion. Be forefaw the happy confcquences of 
thefe voluntary facrifices; his countenance, therefore, 
becoming more ferene, fpoke the pleating fentiments of 
a heart overflowing wirhjoy. But he was fufficiently 
acquainted, from experience, with the inconftancy of the 
human heart, not to be on his guard againft the (kkle- 
nefs of his own. He thought it beft to make fome vifi- 
ble mark, which, frequently meeting his eyes, might 
make him recolleiSt his laudable refolutions every day. 
For this purpofe, he engraved, with his hatchet, in the 

rock over the entrance of bis cave, thefe words Za- 

botir and Temperance. 

My dear children, I give you until to-morrow to re- 
flect upon thefe inftrudtive particulars in the life of our 
friend Robinfon. Try if you cannot find fome amongll

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 



NINETEENTH EVENING. 

ROBINSON had never been in fo happy a fitua^ 
tion fince his arrival on the ifland as he was now. 
'1 he onlv ihing that remained to trouble him, was his 
apprehenfron left the favages lliouid return to leek for 
their two counlryraen, in which cafe he might probably 
be ex poled to the ntcellity of fliedding blood. He fhud- 
dered at the thought of being reduced, once more, to 
the dreadful choice of either deftroying his fellow-crea- 
tures or perilhing cruelly himfelf. 

Things being, therefore, in this iituation, it was in- 
cumbent on him to labour for his fecurity, and put him- 
felf into a ftate of defence. He had long been defirous 
of fortifying his habitation full more ; but, while he was 
alone, the execution of this defign appeared impoifible. 
Now, with the alTiftance of a companion, he thought 
himfelf capable of undertaking it. He mounts, there- 
fore, to the top of his hillock, to form a plan of further 
fortification, which he very foon did, as his fjtuation 
enabled him to have the Vv'hole ground under his eyes at 
one view. He refolved, therefore, on ths cutfide of the 
barricade of trees which enclofed his habitation, to dig 
a broad deep trench, the inner bank of v.hich fhouid be 
defended with a ftrong row of paling. . 

He, moreover, conceived the deilgn of dividing the 
neighbouring rivulet into two branches, one of which 
ihould run in this trench, and the other through the 
middle oi' the enclofed fp^ce before his cave, that, la 
caife of a ilege, he might not be in want of wa-ter. 

Ic was not eafy to make Friday comprehend, by figns, 
the whole of this plan ; i)Ut as foon as he had fome idea 
of it, he ran to the fea-fide, and came back loaded wich 
great (hell?, ajid with flat and fharp flones, tit to ferve 
tbr digging. They both, therefore,' fell to work imme- 
diately. 

I dare fay you can eafily imagine that this was no 
flight undertaking. The trench, to be of any ufe, mull 
be, at leaft, ilx feet deep and eight broad ; the length 
might be about four fcorc or one hundred varda. 

To 



184. T H E N E W 

To execute fuch an undertaking as this v/ithout anj 
inflrument ofiron — no pickaxe — no (hovel — think what 
a difficulty it muft l>e. Befides, it required little lefs 
than four hundred pales; to cut thefe and flmpe them 
with only one hatchet of (lone, was a laborious tafk. 
Laftly, in order to turn ihe rivulet into this trench, there 
was a neceli'ity of dig^in-^ a canal, which, in one placed 
muft crofs a rifing ground ; and lhi=T, to crown the diffi- 
culty of the work, it was abfolutely necefTary to cut 
through. 

All thefe obflacles did not difcourage our friend Ro- 
binfon, who had taken a refolution that was not to be 
Hiaken. By leading a life of temperance and continual 
labour, he was, in the execution of difficult undertak- 
ings, mailer of a degree of courage which is net pof- 
feiTed by men brought up in idlenefs, ufed to delicate 
living, and enervated by elTerainacy. IVith Gsa''s help, 
end -j,>ith perfe^oerance, was his motto, in beginning a 
work of labour and tinie ; and, you know, when once 
he was determined < n a matter, he never refled until he 
had completely finilljed it. 

He was the fame on this cccafion. Friday and he 
worked every day v/ith equal pleafure and earneftnefs, 
from funrife to funfet ; fo that, in fpire of the awkward- 
nefs of their inftruments, they advanced the work every 
day furprifingly. Fortunately, during two whole months, 
thefavages never appeared; a contrary wind hindered 
them from coming over to Robinfon's ifland. All this 
time he was aMe to work without being obliged to take- 
any precautions againft the fear of an attack. . 

Robin fon, who v/js earneuiy defirous of being able to 
converfe with Friday, took the opportunity to teach him 
a few words of Engjiih every day, while they were both 
employed at work; and Friday, on his part was fo atten- 
tive, that in a lliort time he made a confiderable pro* 
grefs. Robinfon took the moft natural and eafy way to 
communicate the language to him: whenever it could 
conveniently be done, he placed the object before his 
eyes, and then pronounced the name of it diftindiy ; but 
when it' was neceifary to communicate the names of 
things which could not be made perceptible in this man- 
ner, Robinfon accompanied the name with gefures and 

figns 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 185 . 

figns fo expreflive that Friday coj'd not poiTibW mifun- 
derftand. And, by thcfe means^ in Irfs than iix months 
he was able to explain himfelf tolerably well in Eng- 
lifh. 

This was a frefli addition to Robinfon's happiiefs. 
Hitherto Friday had been no better than a dumb man 
to him ; now they are :\ble to communicate their 
thoughts to ea(?h other as friends. How frivolous did 
the pleafure feem which Robinfon ufed fo enjoy in the 
fenfelefs chattc of his parrot, in comparifon to the real 
fatisfa£lion which he felt at prefent I 

The more he knev/ Friday, the more h€ liked him. 
The young man was frank and good natured, and had 
the gre-itefl affe<^ion poffible for his mailer : (o that Ro- 
binfon grew fonder of him every day, and madehinv 
take fhare of his cave, that they might pals the nights 
together. 

In lefs than two months they finiflied the trench ; and 
now theyfaw themfelves capable of defying the favages, 
or even of beating them ofFftould they venture to attack 
them ; for before any one of them could crofs the trench 
and the paling, it wasan eafy matter for the two bcneged 
to fend an arrow or a fpear through his body. They 
looked upon themfelves, therefore, as fufficiently guard- 
ed againft all danger of this fort. 

Robinfon and Friday, being one day near the fea-fide 
upon a rifingground, from whence they had an extenfive 
profped all over the Tea, perceived, at a diilance, fome 
iilands, which appeared like Ima'l clouds. Friday fixed 
his eyes attentively on that quirter; All of a fudden he 
ftarts up, falls a dancing, and throws himlllf into fo 
many extravagant attitudes, that Robinfon thought he 
was feizcd with a fudden -frenzy. ** Good ! good!" 
cried he, ftill cci,tinuingto (kip about. Robinfon afked 
liim the caufef^f this extraordinary tranfport. *' Yonder 
is my coKntj-y !" anfwertd he, almoll breathlefs with 
joy; ** that is v/here my people live!" His counte- 
nance, his t, yes, his geftures, all exprefledthe love which 
he bore hi'^ country, and his dcfire to fee it once more. 
Robinlbn was not at all pleated with this difpofition of 
Friday's . it was certainly a laudable one, as it (hewed 
that he loved his country, his friend?, and his relations ; 

never- 



iS6 T H E N E W 

neverthelefs, Robinfon feared left he fliould leave him 
fome day or other, and return to his own ifland. In or- 
der to be certified on this head, he rcfclved to found his 
intentions, and, therefore, began the following conver- 
fation, which will fliew }ou the excellent difpofition of 
Friday. 

Robinfon. Would you be glad, then, to return to 
your countrymen, and live amongfl ihem? 

Friday, Oh, yes ; I (hould be very glad to fee them 
again. 

Rob. Perhaps you long to eat man's ficfti with them 
again ? 

Frid. No, certaiiil V. I would teach them not to be 
favages, but lo live on miik arid the fleih of animals, 
and, above all, to abflain from eating men. 

FKob. But, perhaps, they would eat yourfelf ? 

Frid. No, they will never do fo. 

Rob. And yet they have devoured many men, and 
will many more ftill. 

Frid. Ay, but only their enemies. 

Rob. Couid you make a canoe that would carry you 
to them ? 

Frid. Yes, certainly. 

Rsb. Well, then, make one, and fet out when you 
pleafe. — How! you look down ! What is the matter 
with you ? Vhy do you look fo forrowful ? 

Fijd. Becaufe my dear mailer is angry with me. 

Rob, Angry ! What makes you think fo? 

Frid. Bcoaufe he wants to iawA me away. 

Rob, Well, but iid not you wiih juft now to be \% 
your own country ? ' 

Frid. Yes ; but if ifv maf^'r does not go there, I 
v/ill not go — no — no nrort-. 

Rob. Your people u'ould take nv t r an enemy and 
eat me, fo that you mull go by yourfelf —But, what is 
the meaning of this? Why do you draw" tlie hatchet 
from my fcle, and put it into my hsnd >' Why do you 
lay dov/n your head, and ftretch out your '^cck — What 
would you have me do ? 

- Frid. Kill mt : I would rather die than ' : ^nt away 
fronj you. 

Saying thefe words he Q.ed a ficod of tears. 

'Robinfon 



R O B I N S O N C R U S O E. 1S7 

Robinfon was melted v/ich tendernefs, and embraced 
him. Be comforted, my dear Friday ; I love you too 
well to wifli a reparation from you : what I laid was 
only to try you, and to know if your Friendfbip v/as 
equal to mine. Thefe tears of joy and affe6tion whii:h 
you fee me fiied, are pledges of my (incerity. Come 
to my arms onGf more. Let us dry up our tears, and 
never part. 

To dilllpate tfie forrowful ideas that he had exciied 
in Friday's mind, he fpoke to him again of a canoe, and 
afiicd him feveral queflions tipon that fubje6l. Being 
latished with his anfwers he took him by the hand, and 
led him to fee the canoe that he had begun fome ye«rs 
ago. Friday, on examining it, laughed heariily to find 
the work To little advanced for the time. The tree was 
fcarce cut into the third part of its thicknefs. Robin- 
fon afked him what fault he found in the work. Friday 
anfwered, that he could fee a vafl: deal of time had been 
loft, and labour thrown away, which might have been 
fpared ; for that a tree like this could be hqljowtd in a 
few days with fire, and that much better than by any 
other means whatfoever. At thefe words Robinfon 
was tranfported with joy : he fancied the canoe already 
finifliLd } he fancied himfcif already failing in it on the 
open fea i already, after a happy voyage, he fancied 
himlelf landed on the continv-nt, and converfing with 
Europeans. How delightful were all thefe ideas ! He 
refojved that the work OiOuld be begun the very next 
morning by break of day. 

GV(5. Ah! then our amufement will foon be at an 
end. 

Mr. Bill. How fo ? 

Geo, When he has a boat he will foon fet fuil, and 
then, when he comes home, papa will have nothing 
more to tell us about Robijiibn. 

Mr. Bill, And vs^ould you not give up that amufe- 

.nt for Rohinfon's fake? Would jou not freely pro- 
cure him, at that fmall price, relief from the hardihips 
he labours under in his defert (lie ? 

Oeo. Vv'hy, yes — very true — I did not think of 

Mr, 



i88 THE NEW 

Mt\ Bill. Bcfides, who knows what may Iiappen ? 
Whether he may not be obliged to put of}" the working 
at the canoe, or his own departure ? The future is very 
uncertain ; it brings with it ^o many changes, that, for 
the moil p:irt, it deceives our expeflations. We oTten 
fee our bed founded hopes difappcinted, and it is the 
part of wildom to expect and be preparedhfor thefe vicif- 
fitudes. 

Robinfon, who had experienced them feveral times 
already, returned home, perfeftly refigned to whatever 
a good and wife Prov'dence Ihould order with retpedl to 
the accompiifhment of his wi(h, being pcrfuaded that his 
heavenly Futher knev/ better than hs what was for his 
real incereft ; and fuch, 1 hope, would be our way of 
thinking in finiilar circumdances. 



TWENTIETH EVENT N G, 



M^ 



'R. B I L L, My de?r children, I mentioned to you 
lafl: night, that, in the affairs of life, thebeft found- 
ed hopes frtcuentiy vanilh 2nd end in difappointment. 
The adventures cf Robinfon Crafoe have farniQied you 
with frequent inftances cf this truth, and you have learn- 
ed, I hope, fiom them, aad the inftrudtions th»t I have 
given you, to bear calmly whatever events may happen 
contrary to your expe6tdtions. But I have fomeching 
farther to propofe to you, Vv^hiie we are upon thefubje<3:. 
of felf-denia!, as proper to accompany the practice of 
that virtue. It is an ex<^rcife of the greateii utility, 
and, with yourconfent, 1 will mention it. 

The Ciildren, Oh, ye?, papa ! yes, papa ! 

Mr, Bill, if, then, you defire in the future part of 
your lives to labour in flrengthening y&ur bodies, and 
exalting the powers of your minds, to the end that you 
may become diilinguifned ch^rafters, and capable of 
contributing efl'c6l'jaiJy to the happinels of your fellow- 
creatures, and thereby to. enhance your own, I offer to 
you, for that purpofc, the following plan. 

I will. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 189 

I will, on my (Ide, read to )'on, for your indruftion, 
the writings ot the anctent philofophers who were pre- 
ceptors to the illuflrious peribns whom you lb much ad- 
mired when I went over the ancient hiftory with you, 
Thefe writings contain the precepts which luch philo- 
fophers gave to their Icholars, and by the obfervance 
of which their fcholirs became ;great men. Every 
week 1 will write down one of thefe precepts upon a 
lable covered with white paper ; I will explain it to 
you, and (hew you how, in the courfe of the wt^ek, you 
may acquire, in an eafy and agreeable manner, the prac- 
■fice of it. Yec, you muft not expeclH: that this cai» be 
done without fometimescoft-ng you u licrihce: you niufl:^ 
2t one time, refolve to deprive yourfelf of a favourite 
amulement ; at another, to bear with things .very dif- 
-zgreeable. This is the true way to acquire that mafcu- 
line courage which i? to ailifl us in conquering our ir- 
i-egular inclinations, and in prefervinga prudent equa- 
nimity upon all occafions of lols, difappointment, and 
danger. As to us, who are advanced in life, we ftall 
not be contented with merely pointing out the path to 
vou, ^/e will wdlic in it ourfelves, and be your guides : 
i;i (hort, we fhall advife you to nothing of wiiich we fhall 
not at the fame time fljew you t!ie example. What fay 
you, m.y dear children, to this propolal ? 

T/je Chilaren. We agree to it; v/e agree to it. 

Mr. Bill, Very well, then welhali begin the hrd con- 
venient day. It is now time to return to Robinfon. 
What I hinted to you yefierday merely as polfible, did, 
however, happen in reality. 

The Children, What was that, papa ? 

Mr. Btll. I faid, that, whatever reafon Robinfon 
rijight have to hope fur a probable and fpeedy departure 
from his iflnnd, there might, nevertbelefs, happeafome 
unfwrefeen oblhcle, which would caufe him to remain 
on it longer. This obftacle appeared the very next day. 

On that day the rains began, and fet in with great vio- 
lence. Robinlon, during his fiay on the illand, had re- 
mar ed that they ta' e place reguhuly twice a year, and 
a]wa)S about the time of tJie equinoxes. During this 
rainy feafon, which generally lafled a month or two, it 
was impoliibie to do any work in die open air, it rained 
h hard and fo inceifantly. He had aUb experienced, 

that 



190 T H iL N E W 

tlivit nothing was more prcjudicia] to tlie health than to 
go much out of doors, or to get v/cc during this fcafon. 
\Vhat was lie to <lo now ? He found it abfolutely ne- 
ceflary to put oH' the building of the boat, and to find 
i'owQ employment w'thout going out of his cave. 

What uhappinef^ for Robinfon, during thefe wet day? 
and the long dark ev^iings of this feafon, to have fire 
and light, hcfides the company of a friend, with whom, 
M'hile they were both at work together, he might con- 
verfe familiaily, and fill up the wearifome hours with 
agreeable employment ! Formerly, he ufed to pafs thefe 
dull evenings all alone, in the dark, and without any 
thing to do ; whereas, now, fitting with Friday before 
a good fire, and chea'red with the light of a lamp, he 
converfes v/ich u fellow-creature, and is not afruid ol 
time hanging heavy upon his hands. 

He learned from Friday all the methods which the 
favages have for procuring themfelves any conveniency, 
and ixobinlon, in his turn, taught him a thoufand things 
of Vv'iiich favages have not the leall idea. Thus they 
both enlarged the extent of their knowledge and induf- 
try. i3y mutual aiiiltance, each exerting his particular 
talenf, they fucceeded in making feveral fmail pieces of 
v/ork which would have^^een impoiiibte to either of them 
lingly ; and this convinced them how infinitely advan- 
tageous it is for men to be united by fociety, and held 
together, as it were, by the bonds of focial aiiettion and 
love of their fellow-creatures, in comparifon to being 
difperfed, and wandering on the earth, each by hiin- 
lelf, like brute beafts. 

Of the bark of trees Friday could make mats of a 
texture fufHciently fine and firm at the fame time to 
make a fort of ftufF proper for cloathing. Robinfon, 
having learned the manner of this work, made, in con- 
junction with Friday, a ilock f.ifficient for cloathifig 
them both. And it was no {mall fatisfa6tion to him that 
he was now able to quit tbofe inconvenient garments 
made of hard raw hides, which he had hitherto been 
obliged to wear, 

Friday had alfo the art of making cordage out of the 
fti-jngy covering of the cocoa-nut and the bark of planctj 
refeaibling flax ; and this cordage was far fuperior to 

any 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 191 

any that Robinfon could make. He had, alfo, a par- 
ticular method of making nets with thread; an occa- 
pation which Teemed to render many an evening iljort 
ihat would otherwife have been infupportably te- 
dious. 

During thefefedentary emplovments, Robinfon took 
pains to clear up the darknefs of his friend's underftand- 
ing. He endeavoured, particularly, to give him juft 
ideas of the Supreme Being. You will eafily judge 
how great v/as Friday's ignorance and how grofs his 
errors upon the article of religion, from the following 
dialogue between Robinfon and him. 

Rohinjon, Tell me, Friday, do you know v;ho made 
the fea, the land, yourfclf, and all living creatures ? 

Friday. Oh, yes, very well. Toupan made every 
thing. 

Rob, Who is Toupan P 
Friil. He that makes the thunder. 
R'b. Well, then, v>/ho is he that makes the thun- 
der ? ^ , . ' 

FiiiL It is a very, very old man, that lived before 
any thing elle in the world, and he makes the tb under. 
He is older than the fun, moon, or ftars^; and all the 
creriCures in the world fay O to him (that is, according 
to Friday's meaning, worfniphim). 

Rob. Where do your countrymen go when they 
die? 

Frid. They go to Toupan. 
Rob. And v^here is Tonpan ? 
Frid, He lives upon the high mountains. 
Rob. Has any man ever feca liim upon thefe high 
mountains ? 

Frid. None but the Owokakeys (that is the priefts) 
are allowed to go up to him. They fay O co him, and 
then they bring us word what he fays to them, 

Rob. Do thofe enjoy any happinefs who go to him 
after they die ? 

Frid. Oh, certainly, if they have killed and eaten a 
great many of their enemies. 

Robinfon fuudJered at this difcovery of aji opinion as 
erroneous as it v/as bdrbarous, and from that moment 
he laboured ferioufly to give him juftcr notions both o: 

the 



191 THE NEW 

the Supreme Being and of a future Cute. He taught 
him that God is an in\ifible being, alrnigbty, infinitely 
wile and good ; that he treated all thing?, governs and 
upho'dj? all things ; that he hinifelf is without begin- 
ning, is every where prefenr, known ail our thou^uts, 
hears our words, and fees all our anions ; that he de- 
lights in good, and abhors evil, and that he will make 
happy in this life, and in that which is to con^e, ihofe 
who endeavour, with all their heart, and w rh 2II their 
flrength, to Ittcoine better and better every day. 

Friday heard thefe fublime and comforting doctrines 
w^ith a reipe<5tful attention, and lodged them deep!\ in 
his memory. As the zeal of the mafter to infirucl vas 
equal to the fcholar's defire to learn, the latter was very 
foon clearly convinced uf the orincipal truths of reli- 
gion, at Icalt as far as the former was capable of explain- 
ing them to him. From that moment Friday efteemei 
himfelf infinitely happy in having been tranfportcd from 
his own country to this idand; nor did the refieQion 
elcape him, that the intentions of Providence towards 
him were favourable in fuffering him to fall into the 
hands of his enemies, fince, had it not been for that 
event, he fliouid never have known Robinibn. " Thus," 
tidded he, ** I fuould alvva\s have lived in ignorance of 
the being who is all-good and all-powerful.'" 

Ever afterwards Robinfon accuftom.ed himfelf to pray 
in Friday's pretence ; and it would have been an affcdt- 
ing fight to fee with what joy and devotion mixed the 
poor Indian repeated the v/ords of his matter's prayers. 
They were now both of them as happy, in their v/ay of 
life, as two men can be who are totally feparated from 
the rell of the human fpecies. 

The dull rainy feafon palFed away without appear- 
ing heavy to them. The fKv nuw cleared up, the winds 
abated, the ftoimy clouds were difperied ; Robinfon 
and his companion once more breathed the mild and 
temperate air of fpring, and felt their Ipirits eniivened 
afrelli : they now, therefore, joyfully fet about the im- 
portant work which they "had defigned before the rains 
came on. 

Friday, as being head carpenter in this bufinefs, hol- 
lowed the trunk of the tree by means of fire. This 

method 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 193 

method was (o cffedaal and expeditious, that Robinfon 
"Could not help blaming his ov/n (Cupidity for never hav- 
ing thought of. it, But he fatished himfelf by faying, 
** Yet, if I had thought of it, I could not have made 
ufe of it, as I had no fire.'* 

You win excufe me from defc.ribing to you the daily 
progrefs that they made in this work, as an account fo 
•particular would have nothing in it either entertaining or 
inlltudlive. I fhal! only tell you, that the boat, whicli 
Robinfon alone would fcarce have finiflied in feve- 
ral years, was entirely completed, with the alliftance of 
Friday, in two months. Nothing was wannng now but 
a fail, which Friday undertook to provide, and oars, 
which Robinlbn promifed to furnilh. 

Ric/j. Ay I how could he make a fail ? He fliould 
have cloth for that. 

Mr. Bill. He certiinly did not knov/ how to make 
cloth ; nor had he a loom ; but, as I told you before, 
he could make mats of the bark of tree?, and this mat- 
ting the lavages ufe for fails. 

I'liey both finirtied their talks nearly at the fame time; 
Robinfon the cars, and Friday tlitt \V\\. But now, 
though the canoe was finifhed, it was ftill to be launch- 
ed. 

Ilcnry. Wiiat is that, papa? 

Mr, Bill. Were not }ou v^ich your uncle once to fee 
a fliip launched at Deptford ? 

Hcwy. Oh! vcs ; I remember. 

Mr. Bill. I'hen you mult have oMerved, that \\iQ 
{hip refts upon a hollow frame oi vvood-wurk, which is 
called the llocks. When they firike away the fide ftays 
tliar keep rhe velfcl froiti moving, it Aides along the

Unfortunately, ih-i p'ace where ihey had made the

wete they to get it thit'ier? M ift th^y carry ir, or drag 
it, or I oil ir along ? Each of t!)eie ways feemed equally 
imprafticable ;, the canoje was too heavy to be fo ma- 
n:)ged. What are they to Aq} H-re they were at a 
ful! f.op : how v/c-re i'-:ev to get ( ver it ?' 



194 T H E N E W 

Edzu. Wliy, Robinfon need only have made a couple 
of levers, like that u'ith which he rolled two great pieces 
of rock our of his cave when he was all d'one. 

Mr. 'Bill, He had not forgot the ufe that might be 
nrade of fo fimple an inftrument ; in fa<5t, he had re- 
courfe to it upon this occafion ; but the method was fo 
tedious, that Robinfon expelled to be a month before he 
Ihould convey the canoe to the fea-fide. Fortunately, 
he thought of another method, to the full as fimple, 
which is ufcd by carpenters and other tradefn:en in 
Europe, for carrying the heavieft burthens. They ule 
rollers for the purpoie. 
. Henry. Vv'hat are rollers ? 

Mr, Rill. They are pieces of wood made long and 
round, fomething like a rolling- ftone. They are placed 
under the loads which are to be conveyed from one place 
to another. A man pulhes the load at one end, which 
yields without much refinance, and moves on towards 
the place whicher it is to be conveyed, the rollers turn- 
ing under it all the while, as if of themfelvcs. 

Robin on no fooner made a trial of this method, but 
he was highly pleafed to fee with whateafc and difpatcli 
the boat could be moved along, and in two days time 
it was launched in the fea. His joy was doubled v/hea 
he i'aw that it iailed wiih the greatell ileadinefs. 

Ic only remained now to make preparations for their 
departure; that is, to lay in a fiock of provifions bs 
much as the boat could carry, and then to let fail, b:. th 
being equally eager to begin the voyage. But where 
were they to go ? Friday's wiilies were to return to 
his native idand ; Robinfon, for his part, wo«ld have 
been glad to land on the continent of South America, 
where he hoped to meet either with Spaniards or other 
Europears. Friday's ifland vv-as only about four miles 
ofiT, and the continent was more than a dozen or four- 
teen, if they landed hrft on his ifland, they went fume 
miies farther off from the continent, and, by fo doing, 
encrcafed the danger of failmg thither aftei v.'ards. Fri- 
day knew notliing uf the fea thereabouts^, but barely to 
fail towards his own iliand ; he v/as quite unacquainted 
wit'i the palfage to rhe continent, and Kobinfon i.ncw ic 
n© better, having never failed upon thefe leas. 

' At 



ROBINSON C R U S O E. 195 

At length Robinfon's uncertainty gave place to a fixed 
defire of feeking to land on Ibme civilized country. la 
Ipite of all P'riday's objections, and wliatever he could 
urge, it was determined that tliey fljould prepare to de- 
part the next morning, and let Tail, under God's protec- 
tion, with the lirfl: fivourable wind, for that quarter 
where Friday expected the nearell part of the continent 

lay- 

But this is enough tor to-day. It is time for us to 
make our preparations for retiring to reft. 



T W E N T Y - F I R S T EVENING. 

^AR. Bill- Rohinfon and Friday have now put all 
their proviiions on board the canoe, and the wind 
is favoLirable to them ; lb that, my dear children, you 
have now to bid thera farcwt-il, perhaps, for ever. VVho 
knows if we llali ever (ce thc-m again, or more pro- 
perl) rpeakiiigj v.hethcr we Ihall ever hear of them 
more ? 

The Chikh-fn. Oh I how lorry we are that they are 
going avi-ay ! 

... hill. Such is the lot- of men. They cannot flat- 
ter themfelves that they Ihall alv/ays live with thole who 
are moft dear to them. I'hey mulr, perhaps, more than 
once, endure the torments of inevitable kparaticn. It 
is, th^refcre, wife to prepaie one's I'elf befcrehaiid for 
tittle p'artings, which areas painful as they are, at times, 
indii'penjable. 

RoI)infGn, on comirgc ut of his cave for the lad: time, 
flopped upon the top ot the [jlicck to indulge medita- 
tion for a monnnt, and fuffcrc-d his conipanion to go oa 
before him. He reviewed, m his c,\v!i mind, the vari- 
ous fituations in which he i}:id''hcfn during his folitary 
Itay on this ifland ; and when he recollected t'lC lingu- 
lar care with v/hich ['.oviatnce had iiipported hiru in 4 
molt extraordinary maMncr, his heart was moved with 

. :iucie. He ih^^ t.a'-s cfjoy, and, li'''ting up his 
i I hand3 



»y6 r n E j\ E w 

hands and eyes to Heaven, lie addrcfTcd the Almighty 
with tlie mofl fervent devotion. 

" Oh I heavenly Father, how fliall I fufliciently 
thank thee for all that thou haft hitherto done for me ? 
Unable as I am to exprcfs in words the whole ardor of 
my thoughts, fuflcr me to manifefl: them alfo by the 
lowly poilure of adoration. On my knees, or proftratc 
■with my fice to the ground, or rolling in the dufl;, let 
me, as it were, fink into nothing before thee. But 
every thing is open to thy eyes; thou readeft my heart ; 
•thou feell it filled with inexprelhble fentiments of the 
liveliefi gratitude. This heart, which thou hafi: vouch- 
fafed to amend, and which breathes but for thee ; this 
Jie:.rt, fo often .filled with forrow, and often comforted 
by thee; this heart. Oh Lord ! is all that I can offer 
thee in return for thy innumerable kindnelTes: accept it, 
therefore, accept it whole, and finifli the work which 
thou haft begun in it. Oh! heavenly Father, receive 
me in thy arms, to which I commit myfelf Math confi- 
dence, and dilpofe of me according to thy fatherly mer- 
cy. May 1 never forfdke the road of virtue in which 
thy goodnefs has placed me ! Suffer me not. Oh Lord ! 
to abandon it. In this hope I yield myfelf up to thee ; 
govern me according to thy wife and good pieafure j I 
will go wherever thou flialc conduct me, I go, witii 
equal tranquillity and confidence in thee, to expofe my- 
felf, perhaps, to frefh dangers. Vouchfafe ftill to ac- 
company me, and grant me thy invifiblf, but efteclual 
I'afeguard ! Watch over my immortal foal, and ftrengthen 
k \n the trials to which it may be expoled ! Frefervemy 
heart from v/eaknefs, impatience, and ingratitude towards 
thee ! Oh, h^^avenly and eternal objed of ray foul's love, 
my Creator, my Prei'erver, my all, my God!" 

Here the power of utterance yielded in Robinfon to 
the force of bis feelings : with his face to the ground, 
he had only flrength to weep. Encouraged, however, 
at length, by fecret confolacions from above, he rofe up 
and cart his eyes once more upon the country which he 
was going to leave, and which fcemed, on that account, 
to become more dear to him. Like a man who is quit- 
ting his native land without hopes of ever feeing it 
irgain, his moift and forrowful eyes wandered ftill wiin

affedion over every tree which Iiad once afT'orded him 
(belter cr an agreeable (bade, and over every one ofthofe 
works which owed their being to the labour of his hands 
and the Ivveat of his brow. All thcfe objeds feemcd 
like fo many friends from whom he was going to be fe- 
parated. What were Lis feelings, when he perjjeived 
his lamas feeding at the foot of the hillock ! if he had 
not quickly turned his eyes from thefe dear animals, his" 
refolution to depart would have been fljaken. 

However, at length, his fortune got the better of bis 
tendernefs ; he recovered his courage. With his am^s 
open and flretclied out towards the country, a^ if he 
would have euibraccd it, together with all the (jbjccts 
that it contained, ** Farewell," cried he, with a loud 
voice, ** farewell, ye witnelTes of my pall fufrerin,:TS ; 
for the la ft time farewell .'■' But this laft farewell was 
loft in fobs. Lifting, once niore, his eyes to Heaven, he 
went on without farther hefitation towards the Tea fide. 
As he went along, he perceived his faithful Foil, who 
accompanied him, flying befide him from tree to tree. 
He felt an irrehfiible defire to taking Poll with him : he, 
therefore,, held out his hand, and calls the parrot by its 
name.. Poll comes flying' to him as fwift as an arrow,, 
lights upon his hand, runs fwiftiy up his arm, and refts 
upon his iboulder. Robinfon now overtook Friday, 
who was waiting for him with impatience ; and they 
both went aboard without farther delay. 

It was the 30th of November, at eight o'clock in the 
morning, the ninth year of Robinfon's ftay uponthis de- 
fert ifland, that they fet fail, with clear weather and a 
frelh and favourable breeze. They had hardly got a few 
miles out to fea before they met with a reef of rocks. 

Harriet. Oh ! dear, let us know firft what a reef of 
rocks is. 

Mr. Bill. Seamen give thi? name to a number of rocks 
joined tog.rher, and either entirely covered with water, 
or in fome places, rifmg above it. This reef or chain of 
rocks reached from a promontory of the ifland more than 
four leagues out into the fea. It feemed dangerous to 
fail over thefe rocks : they, therefore, tacked -, that is, 
placed their fail in another pofition, that, by taking a 
fweep round, they might get on iheoutfide of the reef. 
I 3 Uw* 



193 T H E N E W 

E:hv. But if rlie water covered this reef, how could 
they know how far it readied into the fea ? 

lilr. Bill. They could jud^e of tliat by tlic waves 
which they fav/ break o\er it ; for in places where there 
are hidden rocks under the water, the waves rife highiCr, 
and appear whiter with foam, bccaufe thcfe rocks, in 
flopping tlicm, make them riie and break them. 

Scarte ii2d they gained the outmoft point of the reef, 
when, all at once, their canoe was carried away with as 
much rapidity as if they had many fails fer, and^went be- 
fore a ftrong gsle of wind. They were both terrified, 
and made hafre to furl their fail, becaufe they thought 
they had been furprifed by a fmart breeze. But tli s 
was in vain ; for the canoe was csrried over the billows 
ro lefs rapidly than before ; and from thence they con- 
cluded that they were in the middle of a ftrong currert, 
which forced them along. 

Ileury, What ! are tiierc currents in the Tea ? 

Mr. kill. The bottom of the fea is no lefs rugged 
if.d uneven than the I'urface of the land ; and under the 
v- atei- (here a?e mountains, hilh^, and vallies as well as 
v.^on land. Now, the water naturally runs with more 
fwiftnef? towards the parts that are lower ; whence it 
comes to pafs, that there are currents in i.\\Q fea as large 
as the Thames, and often exceedingly rapid. It is very 
ciarigerous for fmall boats lo fail into thtle currents, be- 
caufe they find it dinkult, not to lay impoifible, to get 
out of thtm again ; io ti.at they are frequently carried a 
hundred ieaiues out of rheircojrfe. 

Rich. Ah ! po.or Robinfo/i, what is to become of you 
now ? 

Harrier. Why ^'d he not fiay in this illand ? I 
rliought foHiething v.'ould happen to him. 

Mr. Bill. In undertaking this voyage, he cannot be 
acculed eiiiicr of levity or ralhnefs. He was moved to 
it by reafons cf the greatefl; prudence, anu' ^jol^ ma- 
turely weighed. Whatever happens to him now, he 
iTiay look upon as a decree cf Frovidence, and lo that 
he ref'^gns hiu'deif entirely. 

They tried, in vain, to force themfelves out of the 
current by rowing, an irrefifiible power carried thciu 
tlong wifh the ivviftr:efs of an arrow j and they were 

. nov/ 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 199 

now Co far out at Tea as to have led fight oft'.e coafi of 
their ifland. Their deriru(5tion appeared ine\ itable •, for, 
in lefs than half an hour more, they would Icle fight oF 
the tops of the higlieft hilh upon the iflard : after that, 
let the impetuofity of the currenf ceafe fooner or later, it 
was all over witli them ; for ihcy couid not poiTihly re- 
cover the ifland, havingt no cciupafs to diredt their 
courfe. 

Henry, What fort of compiifs ? 

Mr. Bill. A mariner's compafs, Edv>'ard, who has 
jnade choice of a fea life, will tell you what it is. 

E^Iw. (Lu2^hing) I will; I knew (.very thiiig that a 
good failor fiiould know as well as I do ihar. A compjii;, 
Henry, is a magnetic needle in a round bcx. 

Henry, But what is a magnetic needle ? 

E.iw» It is a long thin pie.e of fieel that has been 
touched and ruhbed with a fort of frone called a viagnetj 
or loadftone ; from which rubbing it acquires this fur- 
prifing property, that, if balanced upon a proper pivot, 
one end of it will turn confiantly tov.'ards the North. 
By means of this compafs navigators can (leer their pro- 
per courfe, even when they fee nothing but the (ky and 
the fea ; otherwife they would foon lofe therafelves^and 
not know which way to fail. 

Mr, Hi. I. ■ Do you unde-rftand, Henry ? 

Henry. Pretty well. But to reiurn to the boat in 
danger. 

Air. Bill. Robinfon, having no compafs, could not 
poffibly recover the ifland, if once he loft fight of it,. 
What a dreadful fjtuation was he threatened with ! To 
be rolled and tolTed about upon a vaft ocean, in a flight 
fkiff with pro\i(ions only for a few days! Can any- 
thing be imagined more hopelefs of fafety ? It then ap- 
peared clearly that a true piety and a confcience void of 
reproach are an ineflimable treafure in time ofdiftrefs. 
Without this valuable refource, how could Robinfon 
have lupported the weight of defpair which threatened 
to overwhelm him ? He would have aded as a pcifon dtf- 
titute of hope, and, perhaps, deprive himfeif of life, 
to avoid the dreadful alternative of perilhing with 
hunger, >

20O THE NEW 

1 lis coinpanion, whofe piety was neithw Co (irmly 
enabliflicd, nor fo well tried by the number and dura- 
tion of his diflreflcs, as that of his mailer, was in the 
teight of deipair. Unable to work, and abfolutcly be- 
reft of all courage, he refts his oar, looks at his maAer 
wirh a hopelel?, difconlolate air, and afks him whether 
they fliall plunge thcmfclves into the fca, to prevent at 
once, by a fpecdy de.ith, the cruel terrors of that linger- 
ing one which feemed inevitably to await them. Ro- 
binfon, at firft-, fpoke to him affeclionately, and endea- 
voured to re -animate his courage : lie, then, mildly rc- 
proaclied him for not putting his truft in the v/ifdom of 
Providence, which difpo.fes of every thing for the beft ; 
and briefly ren^inded him of all that he had already 
taught him upon thisfubjed. ** Is it only upon land,'* 
laid he, ** that we are in the hands of the Almighty ? 
Is he not alio mafter of the ocean ? If he thinks right, 
can he not order thefe wave?, which are now fo dan- 
gerous to us, to carry us to a place of lafety ? Do yoa 
rhink, that, by throwing yourfelfinto the Tea, you could 
cfcape from the lot to.v/hichhe has def!:ined you ? Learn, 
incon/ideratc young man, that your immortal foul will, 
during eternity, be under the boundlefs empire of the 
Aliiiight} , and that ic cannot hope for ha^-pinels, if, re- 
bellious CO i.s iuvertign, it cous'teracts his orders, by 
Confenting violendy to break tlie bonds which unite it 
to the body." ^ 

Friday was renHbiy affeSied with the truth of th^ft 
Vkholefome exhortations, and bluHicd for his ov*'n v/eak- 
nefs. He immediately cook up his oar again, and they 
both continued to row, although they had not the 
fmalleft hope that all their eiTorts could lave them. Ro- 
binfon faid, " We are but doing our duty ; for while 
we have a Ipark of life remaining, weaie bound to do 
every thing in our power to fave it. If we fail, we die 
with the co:t;fortable aflurance that fuch is the will of 
the Supreme Being ; and his v/ill, my dear friend,*' 
added he, railing his voice to a tone of generous anima- 
tion, ** his will is ever wile, even when we, miferable 
worms, cannot interpret it." 

The rapidity of the cuirent continued ftill the fame : 
they couid now fee no more of the illand ;Iian the tops

of the hills ; and now, even of them, they could dif-' 
cover but one, the very higheft, and that was leflening 
to their view very fail : in fiiort, all hope of being 
faved was vani/l.'ed. 

But when all human allillance fails, when the diftrefs 
of the unfortunate is at its height, then, my dear child- 
ren, then comes in aid the pov»'erful hand of Him who 
governs all things; and the man who was on the point 
of perifliing, is placed wholly out of danger, by means 
which he never would have forefeen. This appeared 
in the prt-lcnt critical moment. Robinfon had loft all 
hope of avoiding a fpeedy death ; but at the very mo- 
ment when, exhaufted with fatigue, he was obliged to 
ceafe rowing, he perceived t'lat the fwiftnefs of the 
boat's motion abated all at once: he obfer\ed alio, that 
the water did not appear fo muddy as before ; and, call- 
ing his eyes over the furface of the fea, he farther re- 
marked that the current parted into two unequal 
branches, the largefr of which ran violently towards the 
North, Vv'hiJe the other, lefs rcipid, turned fliort to the 
South ; and in I'iis latter the canoe happened to take its 
•CO'Jrfc. 

Traniported with jov, he addrelTes himfelf to his 
companion, who was half dead with fear. *•' Courage,. 
Fridiy ! It is the will of Heaven that we {hall fliilbe 
preferved!" And in^raediately he pointed out to him 
the circumflances upon which he founded his hope. 
They both, therefore, took up their oars again, vv'hich 
fatigue hdd made them )er go. Re-animated with the 
fweet and unexpected hope of efcapingfrom death, they 
e;.erted their hii efforts ro get out of the current, and 
law, with ir.n.'iite fdtisfa^tion, that, for once, their la- 
bour was not iDcftectual. Robinfon, who, from a long. 
4eries of difappoiniirients, was accuftomcd to let nothing 
flip his attention, obferved, at this moment, that the 
wind would be ot Tervice to them ; he, therefore, quick-« 
ly unfurled the fail, which, catching the breeze, helped, 
together with thtir redoubled extrcions in rowing, to 
carry them verv loon out of the cuirent into a fmooth 
lea. 

Friday was ready to jump for joy ; he role up to em- 
brace his mailer, who, Iiowcvtr, begged him to lulpcnd

his tranfports for a moment, as there remained a good 
de.il dill to be done before they could think thcmfelvcs 
completely out of danger. In fa£t, they had been carried 
out to fea l"o far, that they could barely perceive their 
iOand, like a very Imall cloud in the fartheft extremity 
cf the horizon. 

Henry. Horizon ? What is that ? 

Mr, Bill, When you are in an open country, does 
not the flcy feem, like a great arch, to touch the ground 
before you, vi^hich v^ay Ibever jou turn ? 

Henry. Yes, it does. 

Mr,-Bill. Well, then, the circle which thus bounds 
our view on all fides, vi^here the earth feems to end and 
the fky to begin, is called the horizon. You will foon 
learn more about this. 

Our two intrepid failors rowed with fo much perfe- 
verance, and a profpcrous breeze puftied them on fo fa- 
vourably towards the Eaftern coaft of the ifland, for 
which ihey were making, that they very foon began to 
fee the mountains again. ** Come, my friend," laid 
Robinfon to Friday, who fat toward the head of the 
boat, with his back to the illand, ** come, Friday, we 
are near the end of our toil." He had fcarce finilhed 
thefe v/ords before the canoe received fo violent a 
fl}Ock, that the two rowers were thrown from their feats, 
and fell down at their length in the bottom of the boar, 
which now fiuck faft, and was foon covered tvith waves 
that broke over it. 

Mrs. Bill, Well, my dear children, 1 would give up 
my fupper, and, I fuppofe, you would do the fame, to 
lave our poor friend ; but it is all over with him. Come,

TWENTY-SECOND EVENING. 



CEVERAL of the Children at once. Well, papa,, 
let us know quick -'what is become of poor Ro- 
binfon. 

Mr. Bill. You remember, that, at the very moment 
when he thought himfelf free from every clanger, he fell 
into a frefli one, of a much more threatening nature thaa 
that from which he had juft efcaped. The canoe ftuck. 
faTi: all at once, and the waves broke over it. If'ii has 

flruck upon a rock, there is no more to be faid our 

friends are loft. 

Robinfon mad;; hafle to feel all round the canoe with 
his oar, and finding no more than about two feet depth 
of warer, and a tolerably hard bottom, he jumped, with- 
out more ado, into the fea. Friday did the fame, 
ard they both recovered their fpirits, on finding that 
tlie canoe had flruck upon a bank of fand, and not upon 
a rock. They united their ftrength to free the boat 
from the fand, by pufl^ing it towards that fide where the. 
Water was deep^nl:. They fucceeded, an«l when it was 
afloat they got into it again. 

hLvriet. But poor Robinfon will catch cold — he his 
wetted his feet. 

Mr. Bill. Tvly dear, when a man has (Irengthened his 
conftitution by a fimple and laborious life, as Robinfon 
had, he does not fo eafily catch cold : fo do not be un-- 
f3i{'j on that account. 

Rick. Vv'e ourfelves do not fo eafily catch cold as 
formerly. How often had we our feet wet laft winter, 
without feeling the leaft inconvenience from it ? 

Mr, Bill. A proof that your manner of living has al- 
ready ftrengthencd you a little. 

After they had emptied the boat of the water that was 
in It, ufing for that purpofe their oars and the hollow of 
their hands, as well as they could, they relblved to be 
more careful, and to ufe only their oars without a^ iail, 
that they might be better able to guide the boat at their 
pieafure. They rowed, therefore, to clear the find 

ban'v.

bank, keeping clofe by the fide of it, in hopes of foon 
coming to its end. This, however, they did not reach 
till after four hours rowing, to Tuch a length the bank 
extended from North to South. Robinfon remarked that 
it reached to tlie very Ipot where he was Ihipwrecked 
liinc years before, and, indeed, that this bank was really 
the fame upon which the fhip had llruck. 

Henry, Struck, how ? 

Rich, Oh ! you are always interrupting. 

Mr. Bill. He does right in wifhing to be informed, 
and you are wrong, my dear Richard, to take his qucf- 
tions amifs. Do ^o no more. A fhip ftrikes, Henry, 
when it comes full againft a fand bank, or a nock, from 
v/hich it cannot difengage itfelf. 

Henry, Thank you, papa, for the explanation. 

Mr, Bill, At length, as they were come into a part of 
the lea that was open and navigable, they rowed with all 
their ftrength to arrive at the ifland, which they now faw 
pretty near them, They came up to it juft as the lun 
U'as letting, and his beams only to be leen upon the 
tops of the hills ; and they landed, quite fpent with fa- 
tigue, but infinitely pleafed to be out of danger. 

They had neither of them taken any food the whole 
day } therefore, without waiting until they Ihould ar-' 
rive at the cave for a refreljiment lb abfolutely neccf- 
fary to them, they fat down upon the beach, and ate 
heartily of the provifions that they had put into the boat. 
When their meal was ended, they drew up the boax into 
a creek. You know, I iuppofe, what that is ? 

Rich. Oh, yes : it is a fmall opening, as it were, 
in the (bore, lomewhat referabling the Ihape of a bay 
or gulf. 

Mr. Bill, Yes, but with this difference, that a bay 
is much larger, and a gulf Oill more \^o. — They drew 
up their canoe in a cretk, and fet out for their habita- 
tion, carrying back every ihmg that they had before put 
aboard the boat. 

Ediv, Come, the ftory is not quite finifhed yet. 

Mr, Bill, Robinfon and Friday are gone to bed. Fri- 
day is by this time fail afleep ; Robinlon, after return- 
ing God hearty thanks for this frefh in fiance of preier- 
vation, is preparing alio to compoft himfeil to reft. We

might very well do the fame, but as it is not late, 1 will 
tell you what happened the next day. 

Robinfon, at breakfaft time, fpoke to his companion 
thus: '* Well, Friday, do you find yourfelf difpofed 
to make a fecond attempt with me to-day, like that 
which we made yefterday ?" 
Frid. Heaven forbid ! 

Rob. Then you are determined to fpend your days 
with me in this ifland ? 

I'rid, Ah ! if my father was here with us ! 
Rob» Then your father is dill alive ? 
Frid, Unlefs he has died fince I left him. 
Here Friday, who was deeply affected, let fall the po- 
tatoe tliat he held in his hand, and, fitting molionlefs, 
he flied a flood of tears. Nor could Robinfon contain 
his, when he thought of his parents. Loft in the ten- 
der recolledtion of former fcenes, they both maintained 
a long and deep filence, 

Rob. Be comforted, Friday ; your tatner is probably 
flili alive. We will go and find him out the firll con- 
venient day, and bring him hither. • 

This was joyful news for Friday : it put him almoft 
befide himfelf : his exclamations, his attitudes, were 
fuch as exprelTed the tranfports of his joy : he falls at 
Robinfon's (ttt to thank him, but, in the fulnefs of his 
heart, he is not able to utter a word. 

Mrs. Bill. Ah, my dear children, what an admirable 
pattern is this of filial love in a favage, who has received 
no education, no inftrudlion from his father ; who is in- 
debted to him for nothing but barely life, and even that 
a life which is really miferable. 

Mr. Bill, So true it is that God has engraven in the 
hearcs of all men principles of affection and gatitiide to 
their parents. Alas ! what a horrible monller mull: that 
man be, if it were pollible for fuch to exift amongfi us 
civilized beings, who fliould ftifle in his heart thefe firft 
workings of nature, who fliould feel no more than indif- 
ference for his parents, and who flioujd knowingly give 
them caufe of iorrow and vexation! If ever you meet 
with fuch a monfter, ray dear children, remain not with 
him under the fame roof; avoid him, he is the peft of 
Ibciety i he is capable of the moft dreadful crimes, and 

will 



2o6 T FI E N E W 

will not fail to experience the terrible effefts of heavenly 
vengeance. 

When the tranfports of Friday's joy were a little 
calmed, Robinf'on afked him if he knew tlie paffige over 
to his father's ifland To well as to be certain, that if they 
undertook it, they (hould not be expofed to dangers like 
thofe u'hich they had experienced the day before. Fri- 
day aflured him that he knew the palfage perfeftiy, and 
would undertake it with confidence even by night ; 
that he had failed it feveral times with his country- 
men, when they came to this illand to feafl: after their 
victories. 

Rcb. Then you were amongfi them when they killed 
men and ate them ? 

Frid, Certainly. . 

Rcb, And you took your fliare with them too ? 

Frid, Alas ! 1 knew not that there was any harm 
in it. 

Rcb, On which fide of the ifland did you generally 
land? 

rrid. Always on the South fide, as bc'ng neareft to 
our ifland, and alfo becaufe cocoii-nuts are to be found 
there in plenty. 

This was an additional proof to Robinfbn that he had 
good caufe to thank God for having fuftertd him to be 
fliipv.'rec-ked rather upon the Northern coatl: than the 
Souihein, as in this latter cafe, he would foonhave fallen 
a prey to the favages. He then repeated his promife to 
Friday that he would fhoitly crcfs over Vvith him to his 
ifland, and endeavour to find his father. He made him 
fenfible, however, that this wjs not to be done imme- 
diately, as the prefent feafon wa5 prccifely the feafon for 
working in the garden, and this important bufinefs would 
by no means permit them to be abfent. 

They, therefore, let about this vv'ork without delay. 
Pvobinfon and Friday f rove to furpafs each other in the 
art of digging. During the intervals of reft, they em- 
ployed theuifelves in finding out means to improve their 
gardening tools. Robinfon, whofe patience and inven- 
tion were equally inexhauflible, fucceeded in making a 
rake, though he had no more than a fliarp-pointed fione 
to make the holes which were to receive the teeth : from 

the 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 207 

t!ie nature of the inftrument that he ufed, one may gucfs 
how long he was in making them. Friday, for his part, 
contrived with a (harp ftone to make two fpades of fo 
very hard a wood, that they were nearly of the fame 
ftrength and effedt as if they had been made of iron. 

Robinfon vras not content with providing merely for 
his wants ; he thought of making fome improvements 
about his habitation, and, by degrees, of ornamenting it. 
Such, my dear children, has ever been the natural con- 
fequence of the progrefs of the arts. While men were 
obliged to think of nothing but ihc means of provid- 
ing for their lubfiftence and fccurity, they had not the 
lead idea of cultivating thofe arts which fcrve merely to 
adorn the objedsthat furround them, or to procure them 
pleafures more refined than thofe which they enjoy in 
common with other animals ; but no fooner were they 
aflured of their fubiiftence and fafety, than they fought 
to unite the agreeable with the neceliary, the beautiful 
with the ufeful. Hence arofe, and were gradually 
brought to perfection, architecture, fculpture, painting, 
and all the other arts known by the general denomina- 
tion 01 the fine arts. ' 

Robinfon began by improving and ornamenting his 
garden. He divided it regularly into different quarters 
by pretty broad walks, which he marked out with a line. 
He planted hedge-rows, and made fummer-houfes and 
dark walks. One quarter was defigned for a flower gar- 
den, another for a kitchen garden, and the third for an 
orchard. This laft he enriched with all the beftofthe 
young lemon- trees that he found fcattered over the 
iiland, btfides a variety of other young trees, which he 
grafted with fcions from the bread-tree. I had forgot 
to cell you, that in one of his walks he had difcovered a 
fecond tree of this fpecies. Friday, who was prefent at 
the operation of grafting, could not fufficientiy exprels 
his furprife ; he had no idea of the intent of it, and 
would have doubted its fuccefs, had any other perfon 
but Robinfon mentioned it to him. 

They planted potatoes and fowed maize, both in great 
quantities; and, as the foil had probably lain fallow 
fince the creation of the world, whatever they fowed 

fprung 



2oS T H E N E W 

fprung up as favourably as the}' could wiilj and brought 
them a plentiful crop. 

At times they went a fifhing with the nets wliich Fri- 
day had made during the rainy feafon, and always 
caught more of the finny trihe than they could con- 
fume : they, therefore, releafed thofe which they thought 
fuperfluous, throwing them back into their own element. 
** It is kbuHng God's gifts," Robinfon Icnfibly ob- 
ferved, ** to grafp at fiiore than is necelTary to liitisfy 
our wants ; and it is an odious cruelty to take away the 
lives of harmleis animals, when we are about to ule 
them for our nourlfhment." 

After fifhing they generally bathed. Robinfon could 
not lufficienriy admire Friday's clevernefs in fwimming 
and diving. He commonly chole fome lleep rock againft 
which the waves broke. He would call himlVlf head- 
long from the top of this rock into the lea, remain fome 
minutes under water, and by the time that Robinfon was 
become uneafy about him, he would pop his head up all 
at once, and then throw himfelfinto a thoufand dilfer- 
ent pofitions : now llretched on his back, he let the 
waves roll him about ; at another time — but, were I to 
tell you the particulars ot his performance, it would :il- 
raoft appear incredible to you. On th fe occaHons 
Robinfon reHe£led with admiration upon the furprifing 
diverfty of men's natural difpofitions, capable, in^ 
manner, of arriving at any perieclion, if rightly exerciicd 
from their infancy. 

Som.etimes they went a fowling or hunting. FriJay 
was no lefs ftdlied in uling the bow and artow than ia 
making thera. They kilkd birds and young lamas, but 
nevermore than were requifice for their table. Ro- 
binfon, I obferved before, confdered as a very blame- 
able degree of cruelty the odious paffion of killing any 
animal whatfoever for mere amuitmtnt, and without a 
view to conveniency. 

V/h-itever fuperionty Robinfon might have over Fri- 
day with reipedto underftanding and induiiry, the lat- 
ter, in his turn, v/as poffelicd of much (kill and dexteri- 
ty, to which his mafi:cr had hitherto been a llranger, but 
which, however, were of inhnrte fervice to them. He 
had the an of making, cut of bones, {bells, fLoncs,&c. 

all 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 209 

all forts of tools, which he ufed very dexterouflyin 
carving v^^ood, the Vv^ork of which feemed almofr as well 
executed as if it had been cut with iron. For inftance, 
having found a long bone, he made a chifel of it ; of a 
branch of coral he made a rafp ; a knife he made out of 
a (hell, and a hie of a fifli's fkin, Vvkh thefe tools he 
provided for their apartment many little pieces of furni- 
ture, which contributed to render their fituatioil much 
more commodious. 

The art of reducing the fruit of the bread-tree into a 
kind of parte or dough, was of the greateli importance. 
This pafte was as nourifhing as our bread, and had nearly 
the fame tafte. The favages ufe this pafte raw, but 
Robinfon gave it a little toarting on the fire, which made 
it eat as agreeable as any bread. 

He learned, alfo, from Friday, the ufe of the choco- 
late-nuts, which having formerly found in one of his 
excurfions, he had brought home a fmall ilock of them 
for trial. When they were roafted before the fire, they 
afforded a food very agreeable to the tafle, and as whole- 
Ibmeas it was nouiifning. 

Robinfon, who was fond of making experiments, 
pounded a few handfuls of thefe nuts between tv/o flat 
ilones, and, having reduced them to powder, he boiled 
rhem with milk. What an agreeable furprile ! The mo- 
ment he tafted it he knew it to be chocolate. 

Henry. Ay ! 

Mr. Bill. ,YcSf like our chocolate in every refpec^, 
but that he had no fugar v/ith it. Thus every day Ro- 
binfon found new relburces to fupply his wants and 
gratify his palate. But I muft fay, to his praife, that 
he perfevered neverthelefs in his refolution and habit of 
living temperately, and ©f confining hirafelf to the 
plaineft ibrts of food. 

From this t%ne they began to undertake longer and 
more frequent excurfions all over the ifland, parti- 
cularly when they obferved that thevv'ind was unfavour- 
able for the favages to come over. In thele excurfions 
they made leverai difcoveries which they eafily turned 
to their advantage. 

When their work in the garden was finilhed, they 
fixed upon a day to go in c^uell of Friday's fdther i but 

the 



2W T H E N E W 

the nearer the time approached, the more Rohinfon's 
anxiety encrcaicd. ** What if ihcfe lavap'es," laid he 
to himfelf, ** ftjould treat you as an enemy? V\'hat if 
they fliould pay no regard to any thing that Friday could 
lay ? In (hort, what if you fliouid fail a prey to their 
inonflrous appetites ?" He could not help communica- 
ting all thcfe apprehenfions to his friend. Friday pro- 
telled to him, by every thing the moft facred, that thefc 
fears were ill founded ; that he knew his countrymen 
well enough to alfure him that they were incapable of 
ufing thofe ill who were not their enemies. Robinfon 
was convinced that Friday would by no means fpeak fo 
pofitively, if there was the fmallert room for doubt. He, 
therefore, banifiied all fear and ilifpicion, depended upon 
Friday's goodfaidi, and refolved tofet fail the very next 
day. 

With this intention they again floated their canoe, 
which had been drawn up on the beach, and moored it 
to a ftake fixed in the ground. The fame evening they 
roaded a quantity of potatoes, and prepared other pro- 
vifions, intending to lav in a ftock for at lead eight days. 
Friday (hewed upon this occaficn that he was not ig- 
norant in the art of cookery. As they had juft killed a 
young lama, he propofed to his mafter a method of 
roafting it whole in iefs time than they could on the 
fpit, and he engaged that its flelli Ihould eat morQ 
tender and juicy when dreft after this manner. He 
v/ent to worfeithus. 

He dug a- hole in the ground about two feet deep ; 
this he filled with feveral layers alternately of dry wood, 
and flat ftones. Here he m.ade the fire, over which he 
held the lama, to finge it, or burn its hair entirely oflf : 
he then fcraped it with a (bell, and made it as clean as if 
it had been fcalded in boiling water. With the fame 
fnell he cut it open, and then took out the bowels. In 
the mean time the wood was burnt to charcoal, the hole 
was completely heated, and the ftones red hot. He 
took out the wood and the ftones as faft as poflible, only 
leaving as many of the latter as were fufiicient to cover 
the bottom of the hole. On thefe ftones he fpread a 
layerofleaves of the cocoa-nut-tree, and on thcfe leaves 
placed ths lama, which he covered again with other 

leaves j 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 2U 

^"aves ; and, laftly, over thefe he laid what remained of 
^he hot iiones. The whole was covered with earth. 

When they took up the lama after ft had Iain there 
fome houvs, Robinfon was curious to tafte it, which he 
did, and found that the meat of it was really more ten- 
der, more juicy, and more favoury than if ic had been 
roafted on the ipit. From that time, therefore, he con- 
frantly ufed this method. 

Rich. It is ej;:i<5tly thefame way that the people of 
Otaheitg bake their dogs. 

Mr, Bill. Very true. 

Geo. Their dogs ? Do they eat their dogs ? 

Rich, Certainly. We read of them lafl: winter. 
Captain Cook's people tafted fome of the flefti of their 
dogs dreft in this manner, and found it excellent. 

Hiirriet. Excellent indeed ! 

Mr. Bill, You know, I fuppofe, that thefe dogs do 
rot feed as ours ; they do not eat fleih, but fruits ; fo 
that the meat of them may tafte quite different from the 
fie(h of our dogs. 

Well, children, all the preparations for the voyage 
are made. Let our two voyagers reft for this night, 
and to-morrow evening we (hall fee what may have hap- 
pened to them. 



TV/ENTY-THIRD EVENING. 

ROBINSON and Friday might have been afleep 
about half an hour, when the former was fuddenly 
a'Ap.kened by a violent iiorm, which began and was at 
the height almoft in the fame inftant. The roaring of 
the wind was dreadful, and the earth (hook v.'ith repeat- 
ed claps of thunder. ** Do you hear this?" faid Robin- 
fon to Friday, av,'aking him. ** Heavens !" replied he, 
** what would have become of us if we had been fur- 
prifed at fea in fuch weather ?" Juft at that moment 
ihey heard the report of a gun at a great diftance. 

Friday 



ill T H E N E W 

Friday thought it was thunder ; Robinlon was firmly 
perfuadcd that a gun had been fired, and this belief filled 
him with joy. He lUrts up from bed, runs to the fire- 
place, bids Friday follow hin), fnatches up a burning 
piece of wood, and mounts his ladder of ropes. Friday 
followed his mailer's example, without knowing what 
his intentions were. 

Robinfon made hafle to kindle a large fire upon the 
top of the hillock, to fignify to the people at fea in dif- 
trels that they would find a fafe refuge upon that illand ; 
for he had not the leall doubt that there was fonie ftjip 
In diftrefs near at hand, and that the report of the gun 
which he had heard was a fignal of their danger. But 
fcarce had the fire begun to blaze up before there cams 
fuch a fliower of rain as put it out in a jmoment, Ro- 
binfon and Friday were obliged to haden to the cave, 
for fear of being carried away by the water, which ran 
in floods. The whirling of the wind, the roaring of 
the loud burfts of thunder, all found with redoubled tu- 
mult; and though, in the midft of this tremendous agi* 
ration of the elements, Robinfon thought he could dif- 
tmguifli now and then fome reports of cannon, yet hs 
doubted whether they mght not be the burning of 
thunder at a diftance. However, notwithftanding his 
doubts, he indulged himfelf with the flattering thought 
that there m.ight h^ a (hip near at hand, the captain of 
uhich. If he efcap,.^ the danger of this dreadful ftorm, 
might take him and his faithful Friday on board, arnd 
carry them to Europe. Ten times he attempted to 
light the fire, ^and ten times the rain put it out. All that 
remained in his pov^^er to do for the unfortunate people 
who were flruggling againft fhipvvreck and death, he 
did : he prayed for them wiih the greateft devotion. 

/?/V/A. He was not afraid, then, of the ftorm, as 
formerly ? 

Mr. Bill. No; you fee him now perfcvStly cured of 
that fenfelefs fear. But how was this cure wrought ? 

Rich. By his having a clear confcience, which re- 
proached him with no crime, 

Mr. Bill. Right ; and, moreover, by a firm perfua- 
fion that the Almighty is a being of the purell bei>evo- 
knce, and that, confequently, nothing happens to thofe 

who 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 213 

v^ho are endowed with true piety and virtue but what 

conduces tinally to their greateft happinefs. It was 

day-break before the ftorm ceafed. As foon as it wa^ 
clear, Robinfon, fufpended betweenhope and fear, went 
to the lea- fide, accompanied by Friday, to afcertain 
whether his conjectures were well or ill founded. But 
the firft difcovery that they made filled Robinfon with 
grief, and almoft plunged Friday into defpair. The 
wind had driven their boat out to fea. It would have 
melted any one with compaffion to be witnefs of Fri- 
day''o exceffive grief, when he faw himfelf dilappointed 
in the pleafing hope of foon returning to his father. 
His natural complexion forfook his face, and was fuc- 
ceeded by a ghailly palenefs : he could not utter a fingle 
word ; hiseyes were mournfLiIly fixed upon the ground ; 
his v/hole body was agitated as if his foul were ftriviog 
to part from it, and to break the bonds which held them 
united. Suddenly his grief burfts forth in a flood of 
tears, and he beats his bread and tears his hair, fobbing 
all the while as if his heart would break. 

Robinfon had learned, from his own misfortunes, to 
feel for thofe of others, and particularly to calm and 
footh the forrowsof the afflided. He was touched with 
Friday's excels of grief; he felt for his fituation, and 
endeavoured to comfort him by exhortations full of ten- 
dernefs and good fenfe. ** Who knows," faid he, 
** whether the lofs of our canoe may not be for our ad- 
vantage ? Or who can tell of what fervice this ftorm, 
which has carried away our boat, may be in its confe- 
quences eiiher to us or to others?'* ** What fervice !" 
laid Fridav, tartly ; ** it has deprived us of our canoe, 
that is all.'" 

** Becaufe neither you nor I, narrow-minded, fhort- 
fi.^hted beings as vve are, can perceive any other effeft 
of the ftorm chan the lofs of our canoe, do you fuppofe 
that GdW, whole wildom is unbounded, had no other 
purpofe ia view when he ftirred up this tempeft ? Hov/ 
can thy feeble underftanding dare to judge of and limit 
the iiumenfe defigns of Omnipotence !" ** Tha^s 
right," faid Friday, **' in a general view ; but, as to us 
in particular, of what fervice can the ftorm be to us ?" 
" You muft not alk nie that queftion. Nothing lefs 

thaa 



2 14 T H E N E W 

than oninifcience can comprehend the boundlefs plans 
of that Euing who rules the Univerfe. I may, indeed, 
exhauO: mylelf in conje^lures, but who will futisfy me 
whether they are juft or not? Perhaps there might 
have been raifcd or gathered over our idand fo great 
a quantity of dangerous exhalations, that nothing Itfs 
than fuch a Aorm could difpcrfe them, and thusprelerve 
us (fither from lome violent diftemper or even from death 
itielf. Perhaps this boat, the lols of which grieves us 
fo much, might only have ierved to convey us to our 
ruin. Perhaps — But why all ihefe perhapies ? Is it not 
fufficientfor us to know that it is God who rail'es and 
lays the temped at his will, and that in him all crea- 
tures liave a wife and tender father ?" 

Friday, recovering his compofure, was altamed ofhis 
error, repented of his murmurs, and fubmitted to the 
decree of Providence. In the mean time, Robinfon did 
not ceafe to caft his eyes round to every part of the vafu 
ocean that was open to his view ; he could not help 
looking out for fonie veflel ; but there was not the 
fmaileft appearance of one. He concluded, therefore, 
that he Imd been miftaken, and that Vv'hat he had iup- 
pofcd to be the report of guns had certainly been 
tiuinder. Grieved at the thought of giving up lb agree- 
able a hope, he returned forrowfully towards his ha- 
bitation. 

But even here he was not at eafe : his fincy dill ran 
upon a veilei at anchor near t!)e iiland. He went up, 
therefore, to the top of the hillock, from whence there 
was a full view of all the Vveftern coad, but he 
could diliiern nothing that flattered his hopes. Still 
vexed and uneafy, he went to a very high h;ll, from 
tiic top of v^hich he could view the Eadern coalt, and 
climbing vv iih all fpeed up to the fummir, he cafls his 
eyes round the fea — But heavens ! v;hat is his joy when 
ht' difcovers chat he has not been midaken ! • 

The ChiUren. Oh dear ! 

Mr. Bill. He fees a fnip, and, notwithdanding the 
did.;nce, he fees it fo diflindly as to be convinced that 
it is one, and of pretty "large buithen. You will cxcufe 
me, my dears, if I forbear attempting to defcribc the ex- 
ctliive tranipoits of his joy. He flies like lightning to 

hir 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 215 

Iiis cave, and arrives quite out of breath. He fnatches 
up his arms, without which he never wQBt to any great 
dirtance, and unable to fay any more to Friday, who 
was altonifbed to fee him in fuch a hurry, than thefc 
words, ** There they are ! quick ! quick. !" he re- 
mounts the ladder of ropes, and fets off again with 
the utmoft precipitation. 

From his mailer's hurry and confufion, and the few 
words that he fpoke, Friday fuppofed the favages to be 
at hand ; taking up his arms, therefore, he followed him 
with all fpecd. 

They had at leall; twelve miles to go before they came 
to that pare of the fliore off which the veffel feemed to 
lie at anchor ; nor did Friday learn the caufe ofliis maf<« 
ter's hurry until he arrived at this fpot. Robinfon (liev/- 
ed him the (hip at a diftance. Fiiday could not conceal 
his arconidjment ; for, notwithftanding the diftance, he 
guelTed it mud be at lead a hundred times bigger than 
any thing which he had ever feen of the kind. 

Robinion exprelled hi'; joy in a thoufand different 
ways ; ibmetimes he danced, fometimes he embraced 
Friday with fears in his eve=5, and congratulated the 
good foff^ne of both. Now, indeed, they Ihould fet 
olF for Europe, and come to England ! Now Friday 
(Ijould fee how the people live in that country ! what 
houfes they inhabit, and how they pafs their time in 
peace, enjoying all the conveniencies and pleafures of 
life ! Thus he ran on without uopping, and would 
pe:!i:ip3 have talked for an hour, \ud he not recoUeQed, 
that to iofe the precious time in ufelefs words was now 
particularly unreafonable, and that he ought, by every 
method in his power, to endeavour to make himfelf vifi- 
ble to the people in the fliip. But how was this to be 
done? Here was what puzzled him. 

He endeavoured to make them hear him, but to no 
purpofe, though the u'ind had changed during the llorm, 
and blew, at prelent, off the iOand tO'v\'ards the ihip. 
He then begged his friend to make a fire diredly, which 
might be \cq^ by>the. people on board. This was quick- 
ly done ; and they kindled a blaze that role as high as 
the t )ps of the ^rees. He had his eyes conlUntly fixed 
•upon the fflip, expecting e\ery mv^ment to fee them 

lower 



2i6 T H E N E W 

lower a boat, and fend it towards the (Lore. But his 
expe<5\ations were all in vain. 

At laft, as the fire had been lighted now more than an 
hour without any appearance of a boat, Friday offered 
to fwim to the fliip, notwithflanding its diftance, and in- 
vite the crew to come on (hore. Robinfon joyfully 
confented to this, on condition, however, that heOiould 
take care not to expofe himfelf rallily, nor negleft any 
thing for the prefervation of his life. Immediately Fri* 
day drips off his cloaths of matting, cuts a branch, and, 
holding it between his teeth, fprings l)oldly into the 
waves. Robinfon accompanied him with his eyes and 
mofl: friendly wiflics. 

Charlotte. But why the branch, papa ? 
^:^■. Bill. A green branch is, among the favages, a 
(\gn of peace. He who approaches them with a bough 
in his hand, has nothing to fear from them. It was for 
his fecurity, therefore, that Friday took this precau- 
tion. 

He arrived h^Q at the veHel, andTwam round it twice 
cr thrice, calling the people, but nobody anfwered. 
Perceiving the ladder at the fijip's fide, he went up by it, 
holding the branch in his hand. 

When he was high enough to fee all over the deck, 
he was frightened at the fight of an animal, fuch as he 
had never leen in his life j it was covered with black 
woolly hair, and as foon asitlaw Friday, it uttered iuch 
noifes as perfedly furprifed him. However, it foon 
ceafed crying out, and appeared fo mild and fo engag- 
ing, that Friday was now no longer afraid of Mi the 
ereafure approached in a manner fo hun>ble, and crept 
alon^ v/acr^ins^ its tail and whinin^ fo plaintively, that 
Friday luppoftd it to be entreating his help and protec- 
tion. When it had crept clofe up to h'm, and flopped, 
Friday ventured to pat ir,and the creature feemed tranN 
ported with joy» Friday wjlktd ail over the deck, 
CJ^lling the people, but nobody appeared. VV'hiie he was 
loft in admiration of the many firprifing dbjefts that he 
faw on the deck, and was llanuing with his back to the 
hatch-way, he received, all of a fiidden, fo violent a 
blow behind, tiiat he fell flc;t on his f.ce. Getting up in 
a great flight, he looks round him, and (rands petribed

with condernation, on bcliolding a creature of a pretty 
Urge fize, with crooked liorn^s, and a long bufhy beard, 
rearing it("e)f upon it^ hind Icgs^ and prep;tring, with 
a threateuing air, to make a fecond attack upon him. 
Friday roared out as^ud as he was able, and junipcd 
into the fca. 

The tirll of thcfe animals, wjiich was black, and 
which I nved not nnnie, as, no doubt, you know what 
it is, from the defcription that I have given you of it — 

Rich, Oh ! it was a water fpaniel. 

Mr. Bill, You have guclfed it. The fpaniel, in 
imitation of Friday, jumps alio into the water, and 
fwims after him. Friday, hearing the noife of fome- 
thing that foil into the water behind him, imagined the 
horned monfter to be purfni^g him. }Ie was fo terrined

As to ihc fl)ip, lie concluclc-d that it was fad uj5on a rock 
or fiind ban!:, and tluit the crew, fearing to be wrecked, 
h.id quitted it, and taken to thtir boats for I'afety, but 
he cuuld not conceive what was become of them. If 
they !?ad reached the illand, the Ipot where he then flood 
with Friday was the mofl; likely place for their landing ; 
but he cquld perceive no traces of them. If they had 
peridied, y'et either iheir bodies or their boats, or both, 
wou'd, in ail probability, have been thrown upon fome 
part of the (liore. However, at length, he recolIe(5ted 
that the wind had chmged during the liorm, and, from 
an Eafterly j^ale, had fhifted fuddenly to the Weft. 
This circumftance feemed to explain to him what he 
found lo mucii difficulty in comprehending at firft. 

** Certainly," faid he to himfelf, " the people who 
took to their boats, muft have been driven by the Weller- 
ly gale from reaching this (horj ; the wind mufl: have 
carried them Eallward ; fo that, perhaps, they have 
perilLed in the open lea ; perhaps they were carried 
away by fome current ; or, perhaps, before the Ihifting 
of the wind, they might have touched on one of the 
in.u^.d3 to the Weflward. Heaven grant that this lad 
conje61ure be true !'^ cried he, with afigh. And he com- 
municated his opinion to Friday, who thought it not 
improbable. 

*' But what are we to do ?" faid Robinfon. ** Whe- 
ther the crew have perilhed, or are only tolled about by 
the winds, in either caie v/e'can do nothing better than 
unload the iLip of v/hatever efteds we can move. But 
how are v^e to attempt this now that we have no carioe ?" 
At that moment he feit for ihe lofs-of his canoe almoft 
as much as Friday had a few hours before j' he thoujjit 
of every nnethod poilible either to replace i^ or to lub- 
fiitute fomething eiie in its room ; but he was a long 
time without hitting upon any thing that would an- 
fwer. To build another canoe, v/ould t^keup too much 
time. To Iwim to the fljip, was an attempt that he durtl 
not undertake on accouiit of the diihuice. Bendes, 
what could he expert to I'ive by doing lo ? 

Rse^. 1 know very well what i would have done. 

Mr. Bill. Well, what vv-ould you have done ? 

Ric/?. I would have made a raft. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 219 

Mr. Bill, That was precliely the idea that flruck 
Robinfon at lafl:. ** A raft," laid he to hijiiielf, ** will 
be foonefi: made." 

Hiiiry, Now, what is a raft ? 

Rich. A raft is a numb^^r of beams tied clofe toge- 
ther, lb that one can walk upon them, and tliis will carry 
you upon the water as well as a boat. 

/V/r. bill. You are very right; and juft fuch a raft 
did Robinfon intend to make to carry him to the ihip, 
that he might fave whatever gotxis he couW bring away. 
It was refolved that one of them Ihould go to i^{\.'z cave, 
and bring back provifions for a day, as v/eil as all the 
cordage and tools that he (liould tind. As Friday v/.is 
the more active of the two, he was charged with this 
bufinefs ; and while he performed it, Robinfon cut down 
trees ptoper for the raft. 

Friday could nor be back before night -fa'I : in the 
mean time Robinfon was much delighted with the 
fpaniel, for which he felt a kind regard as coming from 
Europe. 

The fpaniel, for its part, feeired perfe6tly happy in 
meeting wit!i fo good a m^fter, and played a number of 
/am.ufing tricks befjre Robinfon. At Friday's return, 
Robinfon gave the fpaniel part of his fupper,.thougli 
this w^as the firit food t!uc he had tafted himfelT the 
whole day. Luckily it happened to be a moon-lit:ht 
night ; they boch, therefore, worked without ceafing till 
near midnight, when they t'ound themfclvcs fo over- 
powered wiLii deep, that tiiey could no longer re '■;.. Us

Edxv. I do not wonder at that ; they had r.ot flept '

Geo. Befides, they had been fiiriing about fo :;iueh .

THE N'E W 



TWENTY-FOURTH EVENING. 



yl,y/\. BILI.. Scarce Iiail ihe riuldy morning begun 
to appear in the Eaftcin part of the horizon, when 
the wakeful Robinfon roufcd his companion to goon 
with the work which they had begun the day before. 
They worked fo incefiantly the whole day, that the raft 
was finiflied that very evening. 

They had joined a double row of trunks oftrees to- 
gether in fuch a manner with cords and willow twigs, 
that it formed, as it were, a folid floor, fit to lie even on 
ilie water, and about twenty feet long, with nearly the 
fame breadth. They had alio been careful to conflruCl 
this raft upon rollers clofe to the beach, that they might 
the more eafily fet it afloat without lofs of time. 

Fortunately, the tide was on the ebb about break of 
day. They did not delay a moment in launching their 
raft, that they might have the advantage of the ebb, 
which, like a current, would carry them out towards the 
(hip. They pulli ofi", are now upon the open fea, and 
in lefs than half an hour come along-fide of the fliip. 

What were Robinfon's feelings when he approached 
this European veffel ! He would have kiifed it, and glued 
hi.: )ins to every part of it if poflible ! That it came from 
E'lr^ipe, was built, manned, and conveyed thither by 
Europeans, were circumftances which could not fail to 
render it dear to him. But, alas! thefe Europeans 
lineinielves had difappeared — perhaps had been (wallow- 
ed, up by the waves ; an afliitting furmife to Robinfon, 
who wouh' ci^cf/ftJlly have facfihced half of the da) s 
that he I:acl %il ro live, on condition of finding- 
the crew, and fetting i^'l with them for Europe. 
But as he was obligea to ^i ye up this hope, it only re- 
mained fcr him now tofave"' •' much of the goods out oi" 
the fliip as he could for his >'v " uk-. 

Gee. But could he tak^ pcaieifion of goods that did 
not belong to him r 

Mr. LiiL What think 'r;^> Richard, could he do f 



ROBINSON CRUSOE.- 221. 

Rich. He might, to be fure, take them out of the il:ip, 
and carry them aOicre ; but if the owners appeared, he 
was obliged to rel^ore them. 

Mr. hill. Thus juilice decrees certainly. If he did 
not take oul; the goods, they would be I'poiled by de- 
grees in the ■ lea-water ; he had, therefore, Tome right 
to the uie of them ; he might, without any Icrupie^ 
take to himfelf whatever he found mod: necelTary, and 
keep it, booking upon it as a recompenfe, which rhb 
owners, if ever i\i<:y appeared, could not jullly retufe 
him for the troub-s that he had taken in faxing the re- 
mainder of the cargo. 

As to what concerns (liipwrecks in general, ihe fol- 
lowing cuftoins are obferved in fome civilized ftates. 
The iiiipwrecked goods are genierally divided into three 
parts ; the firft: for the owners, if living, or, if not, for 
their heirs ; the fecond is given to thofe who have laved 
the goods ; and the laft belongs to the Ibvereign of the 
country. 

Edvj. The fovereign ! Why has he a fliare ? 

/l/r. BilL That is a queilion to which I cannot, at 
prefent, give you a very iatisfadtory anfwcr; hovi'ever, 
I will inform you of every thing on the fubje6l that is 
within your comprehenfion. The prince or fovereign 
of the country, by whatever title he is ftyled, maintains 
upon his coafls a number of perfons who are obliged, by 
their ftation to look after (hipwrecked goods, that none 
of them be carried off, but that whatever is faved may- 
be lodged in a place of fecurity. Without this pre- 
caution, the merchant, to whom the cargo belongs, 
would feldom recover any part of it, becaufe the goods 
would alwavs be either ftolen or fpoiled, N^w, as the 
fovereign is at the charge ofmaintaining thefe people, it 
is but jufl that he lliould he indemnified by thofe who 
reap the advantage of fo expenllve an eflabliOiment. 
For this reafon, it has been regulatv;d in fome countries, 
that the third pai of ihipwrecked goods fhould belong 
to the fovereign 01 the place. 

Confequently, Robinfon v/as authorized to appropri- 
ate to himfclf two-thirds of the goods tPia'. he might 
be able to recover out of :he lliip, and to apply them 
K 3 to

iMf . hill. Yes; one-third for his pains and troiihlp, 
and the other, as ht^rng tlic onlv lawful fovcreign of the 
iflanil ' f^r which the vcffel had been wrecked. 

^' But v\ ho made him foverci^n of the ifland ?

elie, which lias no owr.er, naturally "belongs to him 
who firft lakes pcflciTion of it ; and luch was exatlly the 
cgfe here. 

When R'-binfon was a little recovered from the cx- 
cef^; of ;oy wi^ich he felt at the fight of an European 
Htip, his f rft wiisj was that it might not prove to be da- 
maged, hilt cnpable of being fee afloat. In this cafe he 
was r-'folved to em.bark in it with Friday, and fct fail, 
if noi r;r Europe, at lead: f^r fome European colony in 
^o>)ih America, or the Wefl: Indies, notwithftanding the 
danger of being on the open fea in a (hip without fu(H- 
cient hands to work it., and v;ithouc ha\ing the know- 
ledge of navigation which a fea-voyage re<juires. He 
f-<-led round the fhip on his raft, and examined the 
dtpih of water about it, but had the morfific^uion to 
be con\incid that he muft nev«r expect to fee it afloat 
again. 

1 he fiorm h.-'d Indgrd it between two rocks, where it 
vvas j:imnied in fo fad, thst there was not the lead pofii- 
bility of nioving it ofie way or the other, and it was 
iikeiy to remain in ics prefeht fituation until the force of 
the waves ilou'd difengage it by daOiing it in piece?. 
Difappcinted in all his hooes for the prefervation of the 
Ihip, Robinfon haflened aboard to examine the cargo, 
and lee whether that was damaged. Friday fiill remen^- 
bercd his fright fo ftrongly, that he coufd fcarce per- 
fuade himfelf lo accom.pany his mafter upon deck. He 
ventured, however, at laft, though not withrut trem- 
.^ling, us the nrfc objed that met hise^cs was the teniBle 
'■orned monfter. 

But he was no longer fo fierce as before : he was Iain 
down, and feemed exceedingly weak and hardly able to

with the iiifideofa (};ip,he was not long in finding wliat 
he fought, and had the pleafure to fee the g.- at devour 
with tiie g;reateft eagernefs what he brouglu it; while 
Friday, for his part, could never fufHcienrly adiviire the 
odd figure of the animal^ 3^5 he thought it, having never 
feenany thing like it before. 

R<.binlbn began next to ta e a furvey of the flii,) ; hj 
went from deck to deck, and from cabin to cabin, and 
found exery where a thoufand things, which, in Europe, 
one would fcarce think worth looking at, but which to 
him were of infinite importance. In one parr was a 
fleck of bifcuit, rice, flour, corn, wine, gunpowder, balls 
and ;r;ot ; in another place were (hip cannon, mufkecs, 
pifto1s,1 words, hangtrs, and cutlaffts j elfewhere there 
were hatchets, faws, pincers, gimblets, ralps, planes, 
hammers, iron bars, nails, knives, Iciffar?, needles, and 
pins. Farther on, he fees pots, porringers, plates, 
Ipoons, tongs, bellows, fire-fbovels, and other kitchen 
iitenfils, forne of wood, others of iron, tin, and copper. 
LaClly, he finds cheils full of cloaths, linen, ftockings, 
Iboes, boots, and a number of other things, for any fitigle 
one of which, if it had been offered to him. f.)r faie, Ro- 
binfon would freely have given his lump of gold, which 
he had long fince forgotten. 

Friday was loft in amaze at the fiiht of To many ob- 
jeds, all equally unknov/n to him, and the ufes of which 
he could not fo much as guefs. Robinfon, on the other 
hand, could not contain himfelf; he wept for joy : like 
a child, he touched every thing, fnatched upevery thing, 
but laid it down as foon as he faw any thing elfe that 
he liked better. He was going, at laft, down to the hold, 
but found a confiderable quantity of water in it ; a proof 
that there v*'as a leak in the fiiip's bottom. 

He confidered v/hat he had bell carry adiore in this his 
"firft trip, and found fome diliiculcy in making his choice. 
Now he thought one thing moft indifpenfably necelfary, 
now another, and frequently rejeils what he hadjuft 
preferred, and makes it give place to anotJier, which is

alfo rejected in its turn. Al length, however, his choic.- 
was fixed upon the following ohjed?;, as being to him 
the nioft valuable of any that he could carry away : i ll. 
two barrcis, one of gunpowder, tlie other of fhot j 2d, 
two inufkets, two brace of pillols, two hangers, and two 
cutlaffcs ; 3d. two fuits of cioaths, complete, for him- 
felfand Friday; 4th. two dozen of il:irt3 ; ijth. tv/o 
hatchet?, two fiiws, two planes, two iron bars, fome 
luiirmersj and feveral other iron tools; 6ch. fome books, 
p:iper, pens, and ink : 7th. a tinder box, with matches, 
ilint, and fieel ; 8th. a hogfliead of bifcuit; gtb. ibme 
pieces of fail cloth ; loth. and lafc, the goat. 

Henry. The goat ? Oh ! he could have done without 
the goar. 

Mr. Bill. That is very true> Henry ; but the goat 
could not fo well have done v,^ithout him. Rcl.infbn 
>vas too compafllonaie to leave the poor creature ex- 
poied to the danger of perilhing with the P.iip, which 
luight be funk before he came back. Ecfides, there was 
room for her (for it v. as a fte-goat) on the raft afi.er it 
h:id been loaded v.'ith every thing that feemc'd to claim 
his greateft regard. No! be did not forget tlic- poor

But he difdained- to thke many articles which i .

diamonds, he found ambngfi the captain's effects, bat 
was in no wife teu'pted to take them away, as they could 
nctpofilbly be of any fervice to him. 

He had employed fo much fnie in examining f.h^ 
ftiip, in opening and en?ptying the chelb, in indulging 
his joy and admiraLicn, in chuiingaisd placing upon the 
raft wh:it he had a mind to carry away, that, when all 
was done, he had only an hour to fpare before the tide 
woula begia to flow agair. They were obliged to

V,d(^, they would hardly be able to gain the ftiore. Ro- 
bjnlon fpenc this hour in dining after the European fa-

Friday and he fat down upon cluirs. The very cir- 
cumihnce of dining at a table, fitting on chairs, having 
plates, helping themfelves with knives and forks; in 
(hort, of making a meal with the advantage of fo many 
European coh\ enicncies, gave Robinfon a pleafure that 
it would be impolfible to expreis : not to mention the 
victuals, particularly the bread, which had been fo often 
in vain, the object of his wifhes. You cannot imagine 
how delicious they tafled to his palate. One fliould, 
like him, be deprived for nine years lucceflively of all 
thofe forts of food, and all thofe conveniencies, in or- 
der to conceive, in its full extent, the luxury that he 
enjoye h 

Friday, vAw l.new notliing of the European manner 
of eating, was very mni.-h puzzled in handling his knife, 
and ftill more his tork. Robinfon fliewed him how to 
bfe them ; hut Friday, endeavouring to iinitate him, 
and to put a bit of meat into his mouth with the fork, 
from pure habit lifed up his hind with the liandie of 
the fork to his lip=?, while the piece of meat v/ent offto- 
wa-ds bis ear. Robinfon having made Friday tafte the 
wine, he hrmly refufed to drink any of it : accuftomed, 
»-s he v/as, to fpring water, his palate could not bear the 
fitjry (Irength of a fermer.ted liquor. Thebifcuii on the 
other hand, v.'as quite to his talie. 

Tiie tide now beginning to fiow, they get upon the 
rafc, puQi oft, and are carried gently towards the riland* 
In a Siort time they come to ftiore, and haften to land the 
goods with which the raft was loaded. 

Fridiv was very curious to know the mean-ing of all 
thole tiiings, and their ufes. To facisfy his curioficy, 
Robinfon goes out of fight behind a- bufh, and dreifes 
himfelf in a (hirr, ftockings, and ihoes, together with 
an officer's uni:brm complete ; then, patting a laced 
hat upon his head, and a fword by his fide, he comes, 
all at once, and Ihevv^s himfeif to Friday. Sei^zed with 
aftonidiment, Friday ftarts back a few paces, doubtin;/, 
at firft fight, wliether it were really his nialler, or fome 
being above the human fpecies. Robinfon could noc 
help laughing at his amazement ; he held his hind 
out to him in a friendly manner, alfuring himihu'is

had undergone a chanf;e ofdrcfs, and, in fome mcafure, 
of fortune. He gave him a fuit of I'tilor's cloaths, (hew- 
ed Mm the ufe of each part, anddefircd him alfo to retire 
behind the tliicket and change his drcfs. 

Friday went accoidingly; but how long was he drefT- 
jng I anil how many trials did he ma!:e ! He put on each 
part of the drels wrong: for infUnce, he put his two 
legs through the fleeves of the fhirt, ran his two arms 
into the breeches, covered his head with the feat of them, 
and tried to button the jacket behind. What awkward 
attempts at drelling ! However, he was fortunate enough 
to correct all his miftakes, and, at length drelfed himfcif 
properly at all points. 

He jumped for joy, like a child, when he faw how 
well he was clotlied, how convenient and eafy this drtfs 
\vas to the body, and how proper to defend him from the 
iiings of mufkitoes. The (hoes alone, were difagreea- 
nle to him ; he thought them inconvenient and ufelefs. 
He begged leave, therefore, to put them oil, and Robin- 
ion gave him full permiJion to do in that refpect v/ha£- 
ever he pleafed. 

He aifo (liewed him the ufe of the hatchets and feve- 
nl other tools, with which he was quice delighted. 
They began to make immediate ufe of them, in cutting 
a mail for their raft, that, with the help of a fail, they 
might, for the fjtnre, be able to go to and from the fliip 
without being obliged to w?.it for the ebb and flow of 
?he ride. Robinfjn undertook this tafk alone, and lent 
•riday to his dwelling-place to milk the lamas, which 
ihey had neglected for two days pafl:. 

During his ablence, Robinfon loaded one of themuf- 
k':;ts. He propofed to have the pleafure of furprifing his 
friend v/irh the aftonijliing effeds of gunpowder. As 
Friday, at his return, was admiring the difpatch with 
v/hich Robinfon had finiflied his work, the latter per- 
ceived a fea-gull fi}ing av/ay with a fidi that he had ieiz- 
ed out of the v/ater. He fnatches up his mufeet, and 
■•'ys to Friday, *' Do you Ite that lea-gull ? He Oiall 
fall this moment." And fo faying, he levels at the bird, 
draws the trigger, and fires. I'he fea-gull falls. 

Imagine, if you can, Friday's terror and furprife. He 
fell down as if it were himfdf that had been (hot. Im-

mediately his old fuperflition revived concerning- To//- 
pati, who produces tlie thunder. Alloni(hed and confufed 
as he was, he took his mafler for Toiipan, He raifed 
himfelfupcn his knees, and held out his hands in a 
trembling and fupplianc manner, towards Robinfon, 
without bting al)le ro utter a llngle v/ord. 

Robinfon was far from making a joke of any thing 
that concerned religion, though ever fo erroneous. The 
moment, therefore, thar he falpec^ed Friday's fuperfii- 
tious notions, he was vexed that he had not previoufly 
inforn:ed him of what he was going to do when he fired, 
and, therefore, hadened to clear up his miftake. He 
raiftd him in a friendly manner, emb'aced him affedion' 
ately, bid him take courage and ceafe trembling ; and 
added, that he vv'ould teach him, in a moment, how to 
make the lame thunder and lightning ; for there was no- 
thing but whit was perfediy n^itu^ai in every thing \\<i 
had itQn and heard. He explained to him the nature 
and effeQs of gunpowder ; (hewed him the conftructioii 
©f the gun } and, loading it in iiis prfence, gave it to him, 
that he might tire it off. But Friday was fiill in too 
great a fright, and begged Robinfon to try the experi-- 
nient in his ilcad. He, therefore, {tt up a mark about 
a liundrcd yards olT, anxi fired, v/hile Friday flood by his 
fide. 

He was very near fulling a fecond time, fo terrible did 
what he faw and heard appear to him.. There^were fe- 
veiai grains offliot in the mark, which had entered pretty 
deeply into the wood. Robinfon, having remarked this 
to hiin, made him perceive how fecure they mu(i be for 
the future againfc all attacks'of the favages, v/hile they 
had this artificial thunder and lightning in their power. 
What he was now v;itnefs to, and what he had it^n in 
the fliip, iiifpircd him with fo profound a veneration for 
Europeans in general, and Robinlon in particular, that 
for fome days he could not recover that air of fam.iliarity 
which he had ufuaily kept up with his friend. Night 
coming on put an end to the agreeable labours of this

He had not e\er fince his coming to the idand enjoy-

had not feen himfelf fo happy as at prefent ; and never 
was man more touched with love and gratitude towards

had vouchfafed him ! Nor was he content with feeling 
thefe fentiments of gratitude himfelf, he endeavoured 
alfo to communicate them to Friday. With this view, 
he taught him, before they vvei«t to reft, a prayer of 
thankfgiving, which they both repeated with foftened 
and grateful hearts, to the praife of the Supreme Being, 
the Univerfal Father of Niiture. 

The next morning ihey rofe pretty early, and carried 
all their goods into a coppice, where they covered them 
with boughs of trees to lecure them from the rain it it 
ihould fall, and then let off with the tirft ebb to return to 
the wreck. 

I forgot to tell you that tliey had provided themfelves 
with cars, lb that this trip was made in much iefs time 
than the former, and to the full as fortunately. They 
took care, in the iBrft place, to lower down upon their raft 
all the planks that they could find in the ibip, wirh which 
they mi^l t cover the raft as it were with another floor, 
and fokeep the goods much drier than thofe which they 
h?.d carried av/ay the day before, 

Kobinfon examined the cargo afrtfb, to chufe what-^ 
ever he fnould think prtferable in fu great a quantity of 
goods, which he could not carry away aH at once. He 
was ret, indeed, (o much puzzled this time, as he had 
already fee ured the racft iieceffary articles; however, 

he

he chofe nothing v/ithout fully weighing the value 
of it. 

Amongfl: other things he refolved to carry away one 
of the fix fmall carriage guns that were in the fhip. 

Rich. A gun ! I think he might have carried away 
fomething more ufefbl. 

Mr. Bill. Yes, fo we may thinic who fee things at a 
diftance. Robinfon, on the contrary, who judi^ed of 
his fituation from a nearer view of ir, thought this gua 
a very neceflary article, v/ere ir only for his eafe and 
lecurity. 

Ric/.\ How fo ? 

Mr. Bill. The part of the fhore, v. here he was obliged 
for the prefent to ledge what goods he had brought cut 
c>f the fliip, was open on every ilde, and, unfortunately, 
at no great diftancefrom the fpot where the fa\agesufed 
to land. He might, indeed, depend with tolerable fe- 
curity upon the u(e of his guns and piftols, in cafe of 
an attack, but the idea that he (houid be thereby reduced 
to the cruel necefiity of ki'ling fome of thole unhappy 
favages, made him (hudder whenever he thought of ir. 
His defvgn was, therefore, in having a piece of cannon 
on the fliore, to fire a ball over their heads when they 
approached the ifland iu their canoes, and fo terrify them, 
and make them perhaps flieer off and return to their own 
country. 

You fee now, my dear Richard, how liable we are to 
be miftaken, v.'hen we take upon us to give an opinion 
concerning the behaviour of other perfons. We verv 
feldom know all the motives that it duce a man fo a6t : 
how can we, therefore, be fo prt-fumptuous as to fet up 
for judges of his adions? A wife man thinks rhat he can 
never be too circumfpeft in thejudgment wh'ch he palfes 
upon the condud of other perlons ; he even fer'.ears-to 
give an opinion unltfs he be obliged ; he is fenfb.'ethat 
he has enough to do to look to hinifelf and his own 
affairs ; and thus, my dear children, we v.ili endeavour 
to act for the future. 

Befides the pieceiof caonon, they placed alfo upon 
the raft the foUov.ing articles : iff. three fmall bags, one 
of rye, another of barley, and the lall of peafe; 2d. a 
cheft of nails and fcrev/s j 3d. a dozen uf hucchets ; 4rh. 

a barrel 



230 T H E N E VV 

a barrel of gunpowder, with ball.i and (Lot ; 5th. a fall % 
6tli. a grindllone. 

J^icl'. Why that? 

Mr. Bill, To fliarpcn knives, hatchets, and other 
tools, when they required it. 

Rich* Were there no ftoucs upon the iHand ? 

Mr. Hilt. Yes, plenty ; but none fit for fharpening 
their inilruments. Ua\e not you ohlervcd, that thole 
ftones which are ulcd for that purpof'e are of a particular 
lort, and jnucli fofter than moll others ? 

Rich. Yes, I have. 

Mr. Bill. Well, Rohinfon had never yet found upon 
hts ifland any of that fort of (lone, which has leis hard- 
nefs than ftone in general, and I'eems compofed of grains 
of fand. But a grindtlone is not only exceediugly utc- 
ful, but indiipenf.ibly necelFary to thofe who make ufe 
of fbarp iron tools. He preferred it, therefore, without 
hefitation, to the goM-duft and diamonds, which he had 
valued fo li.ttle before, and had left behind him in his 
tiril trip to the vcilcl. 

Before he fet off to return, Rohinfon examined the 
condition of the fiiip. He found tiut the leak was gain- 
ing ground, ard that the rubbing of her fides againlt the 
rock, occafioned by the motion of the waves, had already 
loofened and fvarted feveral planks. He forefaw, there- 
fore, that the firil gufi: of wind would da(b the"{}iip to 
pieces, and concluded that he mull: be expeditious if he 
wiflied to fave much more of the cargo. 

As the wind blew then towards Ihore, they were able 
to reach it folely by ihe aiTitlance of their fail and oars, 
though the -ebb, which had fcarce run half down, was 
apainft them.. In their way to the fhore, Robinlon 
blamed himfelf much for one thing. His way of think- 
ing here proves him to have been a perfed lover of 
juftice. 

Eclvj. For what did he blame himfelf, papa ? 

Mr. Bill, For not carrying away the goid-dufi and 
diamonds, 

Edw. What would he have done with them ? 

Mr. Bill. He had no view of ufmg thel'e chings him- 
felf, but he rculjned thus : ** it is not abfolutely impof- 
f.ble," fa'd he, ** that the captain of the veflU may be 

f " 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 231 

ftill alive, and come fome day or other to examine whe- 
ther he cannot fave part of the cargo. If a gale of wind 
were to rife and dafh the (Lip to pieces before you could 
go back to it, and thus the diamonds and gold-dud were 
to be loft, how could you juilify yourfelfto the owner 
and to your own conl'ciencc, for having thought merely 
of faving what might be o'" ufe to yourfeif, without pay* 
ing the leaft attention to his intereft by faving the goods 
that would be moft valuable to him? Perhaps his for- 
tune, and that of many other perfons, depend on this 
llight inftance of attention which you have negieded to 
pay them. Robinfon f Robinfon !" cried he, highly 
diiTatisfied v/ith himfelf, ** how far art thou Hill from 
being as jufl as thou oughteft to be !" 

He was on the point of pulliing back again before he 
landed, his confcience was fo touched at his negle<^inga 
duty which he with reafon looked upon as facred. 

In the mean time they approached the ftore, and, juH: 
as they were about to land, they ran the rifk of feeing 
all their goods loft in the fea ; for, as it continued ftill 
to ebb, and the depth of the water leflened every mo- 
inent, the headmoft part of the raft was foon upon the 
dry fand, and, confequently, higher than the fternmoft, 
which was fupported by the v/ater, that was falling 
every inftant. Luckily Robinfon and Friday were 
both aftern, and, therefore, able to ftop the goods 
which were flipping off, and to keep them from roiling 
into the fea. 

After they had made all things fteady, they were 
obliged to walk in the water and mud up to the knees 
before they could get them afliore. By iheir care and 
precaution in this bufinefs, nothing was cither loft or da- 
maged, and they were ready to put to fea again before 
the return of the tide. 

Robinfon was no fooner aboard the fhip but he haft- 
«ned to convey upon the raft the barrel of gold-duft and 
the caiket of jewels ; and, having thus relieved his con- 
fcience of a load which lay upon it, he thought he had 
now a right to think of himfelf. 

In this trip he carried away, among other articles, fome 
wheel-barrows which happened to be aboard, i know 
not for what ufe > a great qua^ncity of cloatbs and linen ; 

• r a numbef 



232 THE NEW 

a nuniber of touls and pieces of furniture ; a lantern^ 
and all the papers chat were in tlie captain's cabin. 
As the tide was now flowing up, they let fail, and hav- 
ing the advantage of wind and tide, they were quickly 
aftiore. 

Robinfon fpcnt the refl of the day in taking a precau^ 
tion which he thought indifpcrfary necetfary. He trem- 
bled at the idea, r'r.at, were a heavy fhower to come on, 
he fliould be difabled from iif/ng what he counted tlie 
mofl valuable of all his efrefts, namely, his gunpowder. 
To prevent fuch an accident, he refolved that very day 
to make a tent of a large fail-cloch which he had faved, 
and to lodge his tre-jfure under it, where it would be 
fafely i\ eltered from the rain. 

As he was now picvided with fclTars and with needle 
and thread, this v.'ork was fcon fini'ned, and Friday was 
not long before he knew enough of it to be able to afliil: 
liim. He could nor fufficiently admire the admirable 
invention of the needle and fciifdr? ; and frequently de- 
clared, that, in compiriion of the indufLfiouj Euro- 
peans, he andjiis councrNmen were no bttcer than poor 
idiots. 

They fini/licd the tent before fan-fQtf and Robinfon 
had uill time to fijew Friday the eFed of a great gun> 
He charged it with a ball, and pointed the muzzle to- 
wards the fea, that the ball might ilim the furface of the 
water, and Friday might fee dtuinctly how far the g^n 
would carry. Robinfon put fire to the touch-hole, and 
though Friday was already in fome meafure prepared for 
u by two fr>ots from the mufket, yet the explofion being 
now much louder, tcrrined hira lb much, that he trem- 
bled from head to foot. The ball marked its courfe en 
the furface of the water by lightly dipping and rebound- 
ing until it was out of light. Friday affirmed, that a 
fingle fliot like this v/oula be fu.Oicient to turn his v/hole 
nation ofcountr)men to fudden flight, if they were even 
approaching by tlioufands ; becaufe they woald not 
have a doubt that he who could produce fuch thunder 
muft ctnd\nly be Toupan. 

After night-fall, Robinfon put a light f.i his lantern 
to cafl: an eye over the papers that he had laved, in or- 
tier to difcover the li»ip's dcflinaticn, and to whoui fte 

belonged ; 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 233 

clanged: but, unfortunately, all tbefe papers, as well" 
as the books, were written in a language that he did not 
underdand. Here, therefore, he had frefli occafion to 
be forry for having neglected the fludy of foreign lan- 
gusges when he might have learnt them. But this for- 
low, coming too late, was of no ufe. 

Two circumftances, however, which he obferved, 
gave him fome informaticn concerning the fliip's defti- 
nation, and the object of her voyage. _ He found, 
among^ others, feme letters for perfons in Barbadoes, 
an ifland in the Weil: Indies, where there is a great traf- 
fic for flaves. 

Henry. Traffic for Haves, papa ? . . 

Mr. Bill. I Vv'iil explain it to you. In Africa — yoa 
remember, I fuppofe, v/hich way that quarter of the 
v^orld lies r 

Hehty. Oh, ye? ; towards the South. 

Mr. Bill. In Africa, which is the country cf the 
liC-groe?, men, in ignorance and flupidity, do not feeiu 
to diifer much from the brutes. Their chiefs or kings, 
who are a^ fa^'ageas themfelves, treat them accordingly. 
If any Europeans r.rrive on their coails, whole crowds 
cf bracks are cffcred to them for fale, as w? fell cattle 
here in a market. Even fathers bring their children, 
and exchange them for trifles. Thus the Europeans 
every year purchafe a great number of negroes, and 
csrry them to the Wefl; Indies, where they are forced to 
work at the hardefc labour, and are treated in every re- 
ipQt\ widi a great deal of feverity. The l©t cf fuch :i 
il::^e (for io thefe unfortunate people are called by theif 
;.(irclufer) is truly v/retched, nor can we v.'Onder that 
Muny have even preferred death to it. 

Rick. Jt is not well done to ufehum.an beings in that 
manner. 

Mr. Bill. Certainly it is very unjufl; and we have 
hopes that in time this iniquitous traffic of flaves will by 
abolilhed. 

Robinfon found alfo, among the papers, an account 
from which he gathered that the ihip was bound for 
Birbadoes, and iwd a hundred Haves aboard. Having 
communicated this circumftance to Friday, he addedj 
** Who knows if thele poor wretches are not indebted

for their liherty to the ftorm which occa/ioned the (liip 
toftrike? Who knows whether they have not faved 
then.l'elves hy the boats, and landed on fome ifland, 
where, their tyrants having no longer any power over 
them, they now live after their fa-l^ion, happy and con- 
tented ?" Friclav agreed that this cor)je61iire was not 
wholly improHablc ** Well then, my friend," replied 
Robinfon, with fome warmth, ** could vou now repeat 
the qucllion that you lately aiked me ?'* 

Frid. Wh.;t queftion ? 

Rob, You alked me, of what ufe could the Horm be 
that carried aw-ty our canoe ? 

Friday looked down, quite aOjamed r.nd confounded ? 

** Oh ! Friday," faid Robin<on, animattd with pious 
2eal, *' acknowledgf, here, the hand of anall-pcwe-fjl 
and all- wife God, v, hich has appeared 'enfibly in this 
affair. ConTder what the flonr 'us given us, in return 
for the little that it has taken awa) . Cail yuur eyes on 
all thefe diiTerent articles ; tiiey are fuch as render life 
commodious and happy. Whence (Ijould wc have had 
them were it not for the llorm ? It is, indet,d, an un- 
pleafant thing to owe one's happiufs to the misfortunes 
of another ; yet, the greaced numlier of thofe v/ho were 
in the fuip are now, perhaps, better ofT than before ftie 
ftruck. As this fuppchiion is not wholly void of pro- 
bability, v.'hat think you now of the pov^^er which go- 
verns the Vv-orld ?" 

** 1 think," anfwered Friday, ** the wifdom and 
goodnefs of that power are inexprelTible, and I was a 
fenfelefs idiot in faying what 1 did." At the fame time, 
he lifted up his hands and eyes towards Heaven, and 
implcred pardon for the fault which he had committed 
through ftupidity. 

Robinfon took as much care of the papers which he 
had been looking over, as of the diamonds and gold-duft, 
that, if ever he returned to Europe, he might, by means 
of them, difco\er the perfons to whom he fliould reftore 
the treafure that he had faved out of the (hip. 

For fix days fuccelUvely they made two or three trips 
a day to the wreck, and brought to land every thing they 
could podibly convey away. A thoufand little matters 
which we would Icar.cely think it worth while to pick:

t;p, becaufe we have never felt bow difagreeabfe the lofs 
of them is, were of infinite value to them, and, there- 
fore, they did not neglect to take them away. One 
part of the cargo confided of elephants teeth ; thofe they 
did not touch, becaufe they could make no ufe of them. 
They alio left bthind feveral hogfljcads of coifee ; as 
Robinfon was determined not to fall again into the ha- 
bit of ufing pernicious fuperfluities though ever fo agree- 
able : but they tore up and carried away as many of the 
Itip's planks as they could, becaufe they feemed likely 
to be ufeful, and, confequently, valuable. They took 
away even the remaining five pieces of cannon, together 
with all the iron that they either found loofe or could 
loofen from the flhip^s works. 

After they had made eiglneen trips, all v/ith good fuc- 
cefs, chey obferved, as they were on board the nine- 
teenth time, tliat a ftorm v/as rifmg very faft. They 
made hafte, therefore, to load the raft and pufti off, 
hoping to gain the fi-jore by rowing before the ftorm 
/hould gather ibength. But in vain 5 th-y were fcarce 
half way cavv-ards the fhore when a violent gale of 
wind, accompanied u ith thunder, lightning, and rain, 
fv/elied and agitated the fea in fuch a manner, that the 
v/avcs, rolling over the r^ft, carried off all the gocds 
that were upon :r. As to ihtmfelves, they held pretty 
clofe fcr fome time to the maft, fo that the waves could 
not w aO] them awa}', chough at times they went clean 
over their heads. 

At length, the flightnefs of the raft began to give way 
to the fury of the v/uves. The cordage and oiier bind- 
jiigs, which held the pieces of it together, being loofen- 
cd, all the beams of which it confifccd quickly came 
afunder. 

Hanist, Heavens ! what v/ill become of poor Ro- 
binfon ? 

The Children, Softly ! have patience ! 

Mr, Bill. Friday fought to fave himfejf by fwimming, 
and Robinfon feizeda piece of wood, with which he was 
ibmetimes plunged into the deep, and fomctimes rods 
Upon the ridge of the v/aves. But, being longer under 
water than above, he had loft his breath, and could nei- 
ther fee ir&r hear. His (Irength now forfook him, and 



236 T HE N E W 

he was alrroft infenfible ; he utters a weak cry, and iinks 
down, opprclfcd by a Iiuge wave, which carries away 
ihe beam that Inpportcd him. 

Happily his faithful Friday was not far from him, 
though he might have fuved himfelf and gained theftiore 
iboncr if he had chofen to do fo. When he faw him 
fmlc, he, without hefitating a moment, dived down, 
fcized him with his left hand, and by means of his 
right, rofe with him again to the furface of the 
water. He then exerted himfelf with fo much fuccefs, 
that, in a few minutes, he reached the (hore with his 
maflei^s body. 

T/.^e Childrefi, Ah ! his body ! 

Mr. Bill, You all fecm to be alarmed. I ufe the 
word body becaufe Robini'on fhewed no fignsof life. 

Friday, v;ho v/as dillraded at his malUr's prefent 
condition, carried him a little farther up on the beach, 
hung over him, called him with a loud voice, fhook 
him, rubbed him, and joined his lips to his mouth to 
communicate breath to him if pofTible. At length he 
had the inexpreifible fatisfad^ion to perceive figns of life 
in him ; he, therefore, continued his exertions, and 
Pv.obinfon quickly recovered the ufe of his faculties. 

Opening his eyes, he afked, in a weak and trembling 
voice, " Where ami ?" ** In my arms, my dear 
niailtr !'* anfwcred Friday, with tears in his eyes. An 
affecting fcene now took place between, them. Ro- 
binfon thanked Friday at houfand times, and called him 
his lavicur : Friday, for his part, through joy at feeing 
himreftored to himfelf, was almofc ready to run wild. 

My dear children, we cannot hnith the account of that 
day's adventures with any circumilance more intereftingf

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 237 



TWENTY-SIXTH EVENING. 

71^/?. BILL, Well, my dear childreqtj our friend 
Robinfon is refiored to life once more. A good 
night's deep \r\ his tent, upon a bed that he had faved 
from the wreck, recovered him fo well, that he was up ~ 
at day-break ; he felt himfelf poffefled of his ufual 
ftrength, and returned thanks to God for having pre- 
ferved both his life and health. The ftorm had conti- 
nued the whole night, and he waited, with impatience, 
until it was broad day-light, to fee what was become of 
the fliip. 

The fun was now above the horizon, and Robinfon 
faw, to his grief, that th3 Ihip had difappeared. Planks 
and timbers, fcuttered here and there upon >he beach, 
were fufficient tokens that the ftorm had daflhed it to 
pieces. This being the cafe, he found fome reafon to 
applaud his own forefight in faving every part of the 
cargo that be could. Happy the man whofe prudence 
and caution always regulate his condudl, and who, in all 
the accidents which deprive him of any advantage, caa 
fay to himfelf, v/ith truth, as Robinfon could upon this 
occafion, thatjt was not his fault! How much this in- 
ward fatisfaclion will lighten the misfortunes, which, 
without it, would be accompanied with the greateft 
vexation ! 

Robinfon and Friday were particularly careful to ga- 
ther all the remains of the wreck together on one fpoc 
of the beach. They furefaw tliat every plank and every 
fplinter might be of ufe another time. When they had 
finiihed every thing that concerned the wreck, they 
formed a regular plan of the employments which were 
to take place next. 

The objedl v/as, at prefent, to convey all thefe goods 
to their dwelling-pliice i but they thought it dangerous, 
while (hey carried one parcel, to be at fo gredt a dif- 
tance from th.e reft. Robinton fettled it, therefore, that 
ihey ihouid carry the goods and Hand guard alternately, 

the 



233 T H E N E W 

the one In tlie morning, the other in the afternoon. He 
loaded ihc carriage guns, ranged ther^feyefide each other, 
iilvc a h.itttry, and pointed them towaras the fea. They 
kindled a fire, which he who ftood fentinel was to take 
care to keep up ; and tliey placed a match befide the 
gun^, that they might be ready to fire whenever the cafe 
required it. 

Robinfon made t^e firft journey to carry the goods 
home. In order to Ipare his befl: cloaths, he had dreil 
himfelflike a Tailor j and, inflead of the weapons that 
he formerly wore, he had now a cutlafs by his fide, and 
two loaded piilols in his girdle. He began by loading 
his v.hcel-barrow with feme cafks of gunpowder, and 
other articles which were mod in danger from the rain. 
The water-fpaniel, which had never quitted him, was, 
by no means, a ufelels companion on this journey. Ro* 
binfon harnelfed him to the wheel-barrow, and the c '^ 
was of confiderable fervice to him in conveying the bur^ 
then forward. As thefc fpaniels are very docile, and 
capable of being taught many things, this dog was foon 
trained to his new employment, and acquitted himfelf 
in it as well as any beafi: accuftomed to the draught, 
lie carried alfo a parcel in his mouth, which he had 
betn taught to do by thofe to whom he formerly be- 
longed. 

At his return, Robinfon brought all his Iamr.s, ready 
Iiarnelfifd for carrying burthens, in order to ufe them for 
that purpofe. As there were leven ot them, and each of 
them wa:s able to carry one hundred and fifty pounds 
weight, you may eofily calculate the weight ot goods 
uhich they, all together, convejed home every jour- 
ney. 

So many articles could not all be flowed in Robin- 
fon's cellar. He haCened, therefore, to pitch another 
large tent in the encloled ground before his cave. Ihis 
wai> m..eant as a llo'e-reni for the prelent, nnril ether 
means ftould ba contrived forfecuring the things, la 
eight days the whole was carried home, except a num- 
ber of boaids and timbers which they ilieltered as well as 
they could v.'ith thickets and bruilnvood. 

H'lnief. But, papa, you have not cold us any thing 
more about the goat. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 239 

Mr. Bill. Ah ! very true ; I J^ad nearly forgot her. 
Well, the goat, as you may fuppofe, was brought home 
alfo, and put into a little park along with the tame lamas, 
and (he agreed very well with them. 

Whit agreeable cmplo)ments have Robinfon and 
Friday now before them I They fcarce knew where to 
begin. However, Robinfon, who had contracted 3 tafte 
for regularity, as well as the habit of it, quickly ditlin- 
guifhed the more neceflary labours from thoie which 
Vv'ere lefs fo, and did not hefitate in giving the prefer- 
ence to the former. The mod important of all was the 
building of a fiied, or ftorehoule, to (h.t-'lter the goods, 
which could not be put into the cellar, more fecurely 
than they were under the tent. Here it was neceffary 
to do the bufmefs of a houfe-carpenter, to which rhey 
had neicher of them ferved an apprenticelhip.v But, 

What could be difficult to the induflrious and perlever- 
ing Robinfon nov/ that he was provided with all forts of 
tools ? The moft troublelbrae pieces of work, and thofe 
in which he had the lealt experience, were no more than 
a play to him who had happily fucceeded in fo many 
others without alPiftance or proper tools. The cutting 
down and hewing out of the trees, the fquaring of the 
beams and rafters, the joining and fitting of them, build- 
ing o^ brick walls, making of a double roof, one of 
boards, and the other of the leaves of the cocoa-nut 
tree — were all executed v^'ith furprifmg difpatch. 

The little building, when fi iilhed, was not much Un- 
like one of our country cottages. Robinfoi had taken 
care to bring away with him the fliip's cabin windows; 
they ferved to give light to the building, wichout the 
inconveniency of holes that would let in the wind. The 
ghifs was an objedt of particular aduiiration to Friday ; 
he had never iQ(:n any before, and he learnt, by experi- 
ence, the commodious purpofes that it lerves. 

When all was put under cover and in "proper order, 
Robinf in thought of contriving for himfelf a convenient 
way of entering iiis fortrefs without weakening it. The 
nioft fccure method for the purpofe was' by means of a 
common g.ite ana a drav/jridg<.. Being pravid.d with 
every recc.i'ary for ihi,> undeiialiing, as nails, chains,' 
hingi-s^ lo^ks, and iron work of all forts, he imiieiiately 

be^an 



240 T H E N E W 

began upon If. They firft made the gate and the draw- 
bridge ; and, afterwards, they made an opening in the 
terrace and palifade fufficient for the width of the gate, 
which they next reared up in its place; then they laid 
down the bridge in liich a nmnner, that, when raifcd, it 
n.ight lie againft the gate, and cover it. Lailly, they 
loaded the guns, and placed them upon the terrace, in 
luch pofuions, that two of them fiiould defend the right 
flank, two the left, and two the front ot their fortifica- 
tion : fo that henceforward they might be ^uite at their 
cafe as to the attacks of the favages, and had, befides, 
the advantage of an eafy and^convenient way for going 
in and our. 

W hen harveft time was come, Robinfon made ufe of 
an old hanger, inflead of a fickle, to cut down his maize, 
and his wooden fpade ferved him for digging his pota- 
toes. How eafily was the work performed with fuch 
inftruments ! It would have been a pleafure to fee iheni 
garher their harvefi, and fiill more to afTiii them. 

Ihmy. Oh ! 1 wifh i had been there ! How 1 would 
have worked ! 

Fflui'. Nay, you have no occafion to go fo far as Ro- 
binfon Crufoe^'s ifland for work. Papa will find you 
plenty, if you are fond of it. There is wood to k^ 
fawed, to be fplit, and to be carried ; there are pikts in 
the garden to be dug up ; there is weeding and water- 
ing of the fiower^ i and, in fhort, you will aKvajs find 
enough to do. 

Mr, Bill. Why do I fet you to work at thtfe differ- 
ent employments? 

Rich, To accuftom us never to he idle, to flrengthen 
cur bodies, and preferve us in good beaich. 

Geo. For my part, 1 like it, and you flial! always 
fiad me, papa, as diligent and induftrious as Robinlon 
himfelf. 

Mr, EilL Well v.'e fijall fee that. W^e are very (tn- 
fibie that Robinfon was the better for it, and every one 
of us alio experiences more and more the happy effects 
cf an active v.'By ot life. 

When tiie harveft v/as gathered, P>obirfon:made two 
flails. Fiiddv fcon learned the ufc of them, and in onq 
day they tlirtihed all their maize, it filled two facks 

v/hicK 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 241 

which might contain about (Ix bufhels. They had a 
ftock of bifcuits which would laft fome months ; but as 
' it mufl:, ofcourfe, leifen every day, Robinlbn refolved to 
Ibpply its place occafionally with bread, which he in- 
tended to make himfelf. 

He had brought a hand mill from the fLip,and want- 
ed nothing. but a fieve to bolt the flour, and an oven 
for baking the bread. He found expedients for both. 
Some fine muOin, of which there was a whole piece 
amongfl: the goods faved from the (hip, fcrved him to 
make the bottom cf his iieve ; and the building of the 
oven gave him very little trouble; fo that the whole v/as 
finiihed before the rainy feafon came on. 

He made, by way of trial, two forts of bread, one of 
rye flour, and the other-of maize. The rye bread was 
by far the better tailed of the two, whidi determined 
Robinfon to give it the preference. He propofed to 
fow the greateft part of his land with rye, inftead of 
maize, that he might always have a ftock of grain fuffi- 
cient to fupply them with bread ; nor did this feem an 
undertaking beyond his power to accomplifh, ailifted as- 
he Vv'as by his man Friday, fince in this ifland they might 
have two crops in thecourfe of the year. 

There .was one article that would have been exceed- 
ingly ufeful to them, but, unfortunately, they could 
hnd nothing of the fort amongfl the goods in the fliip ; . 
and that was an iron fpadc. Jt is true, Friday had made 
one of hard wood that might ferve upon occafion, but 
' dill they found room to wilh for a better ; for it is cer- 
-tain, that an iron f{)ade is, after all, more handy and ef- 
fedive for breaking up the ground, than a wooden one 
can polhbly be. Robinfon, therefore, who dete; mined, 
for the future, to make agriculture his principal employ- 
ment, as being, of all forts of labour, the moft agreeable 
nnd moft uleful, conceived the defign of fixing up a forge 
to make fpad^-s himfelf, and, polhbl), other inftruments 
befides. 

This defign was not {o extravagant as perhaps you 
maythinkir; for every thing neceifary for a forge was 
to be found in his ftorehoufe. There was a fmali anvil, 
fcveral pair of pincers, a pretty large pair of bellov/s, and 
fuch a Itock ol iron, both wrought and in bars, as would 
L probably 



24* 



HE NEW 



probably be fufTicient to keep him in werk all his life* 
time. This plan was, therefore, immediately put in 
execution. 

By means of a large boarded roof, which they put 
over the kitchen, it was fo extended that they were able 
to hx up a forge in it, and to work at it even during the 
rainy feafon. Part of this feafon, therefore, they Ipent 
in working fmiths work ; and if they fucceeded upon 
the whole, it was not without fome dil'appointments 
and unruccefsful trials. When the fpades were finifhed, 
Robinfon had a mind to go a little farther, and to try 
his abilities at making a plough ; and in this alfo, to his 
inexpreflible joy, he perfectly fucceeded. 

This plough was, you may fuppofe, very different 
from ours. It confilled of a fingle branch of a tree ; one 
end of which, bending down, refted on the ground, and 
was fumilhed with a fock, and alio a handle, by means 
of which the perlon who ploughed might guide it at 
pleafure : at the other end they were to harnefs their 
o»en, or horfes; but as they had none, they were 
obliged themfelves to fupply their places. In a word, 
this plough was exadly like that in ufe amongft the an- 
cient Greeks, at their firft: undertaking the practice of 
agriculture. I can give you a (ketch of it here. 




Henry. Really, it is a very curious plough. 

Geo. Had it no wheels ? 

Mr. Bill, No: you lee it had not. All inllruments 
were at firli as fimple in their make as this plough. By 
decrees men made additions for greater convenience: fo 
bv altering and improving, they encreaied the utility 
and commodioufnefs of the tools neceflary for.th^i^- dit' 
ferent labours. 

la 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 243 

In the mean time, Robinfon had every reaibn to be 
proud of this invention ; it was wholly his own, for he 
had never feen a plan of it. By all that we can learn 
from hiftory, many ages of the world elapfed before men 
arrived at the inventios even of fo fimple a machine as 
this plough J and the inventors of it were looked upon 
by poflerity as men of fuch exalted wifdom, that, after 
their death, they were paid divine honours. Richard, 
you remember the name of him to whom the Egyptians 
attribute the invention of the plough. 

Ric/j, Yes ; it was Ofiris, whom, for that reafon, 
they afterwards worfhipped as a god. 

Mr. Bill, The Phoenicians afcribed this ufeful in- 
vention to one Dagon, whom they alio regarded as a be« 
ing of fuperior order, and called the Son of Heaven. 

Edrxf. But could not Robinfou make the lamas draw 
the plough ? 

Mr. Bill. At firft he doui:)ted whether they vVere fit 
for this work, as they feemed rat.'ier.beafts of burthen 
than of draught; however, he determined to make a 
trial of them, and the fuccefs of it exceeded his hopes. 
They became gradually accuitomed to the work, v/hich, 
^t length, they performed in every re fpecl as perfeCUy 
as if Robinf)n and Friday had been brought up plough- 
men, and the iamas had been trained like our bcalts of 
drau_,ht. 

To fow their field according to all the rules of art, 
there wanted but one imlrument, whicli t'ley could 
fcarcely do without, and which they had not fjund in 
the (hip. 

H^nrj. I can guefs what that was. 

Mr. Bill. What do you tiiink ? 

Hsff-y, A harrow, 

Mr. Bill. You arc right. Without it tillage would 
be imperfetSl. By means of it we break* the clods, 
throw che grains of corn into the furrows, and cover 
them, without which they would never ipring up, but 
be devoured by the birds. 

In the firft place, Robinlon made as many iron teeth 

as be thought would be neceilar) for i\u h^irrow. After 

fome unfuccefsful attempts, he, at length, fuuceeded in 

i- -s makin? 



244 THE N E VT 

nnk-ing the wooden frame in which thefe iron teetii 
were to be fixed. Lallly, he made as many holes in the 
frame as it was to contain teeth, and when he had 
driven them in, and clinched them, the harrow was 
fiPiinitd. 

The rainy feafon being over, he fowed two bufliels of 
rye, one of barley, and half a bufhel of peafe ; and, at 
the end of the five months, he had the fatisfadtion to 
gather a crop of twelve times as much feed as he had 
i'owp.f namely, twenty-four bufhels of rye, twelve of 
barley, and fix of peaie ; a (lock more than fufticient 
to laft them fix months. Eut like a pruder.i oeconomifl:, 
he was willing to have a fupcrabundance of every 
thing, bccaiife there might come on a feafon of fcarcity ; 
befides, hail ct other accidents riiight deftroj his crops. 
He refolved, therefore, to have a barn, which being 
filled, every half year, might alwaxs cont:iin a fufficient 
flock, in cafe a crop fiiould happen to fail. 

With this intention, v/hen the weather was fettled 
fair, they unroofed the ftore-houi'e, in order to add ano- 
ther (lory to it, vvhich might ierve as a granary. The 
building of this required more (kill and labour than that 
of the ground floor ; but their indefatigable perfever- 
ance triumphed over all difficulties, and the v/ork was 
foon happily completed. 

During thefe tranfaftions, the goat yeaned tv/o young 
ones ; {o tliat the fpecies n.ight now be multiplied and 
kept up on the ifland. The fpaniel ferved as a guard 
by night, and Foil, t.'e parrot, am u fed them at table, 
and pretty often alio v.'hen they w^ere at work. On the 
other hand, the iamas were become more valuable to 
them than ever; as, befides affording milk, butter, and 
cheefe, they aififted in tilling the grcund. In order, 
therefore, to be perfectly happy, Robinlbn wanted no- 
thing now but- guefs. 

Rich. To be with his 'ather and mo'.her. . 

Mr. Bill. And to have lomc more companions. Be- 
ing only two upon the uland, ihey m.uft expect, iooner 
or later, one of them to die before the ouier, wno would 
then remain a poor hermit, ieparated from all. the reft of 
mankind. Yei Robinfon Icol-.ed upon it as a blameuble 
weakncis to makeoii;'$ lik miierab;e by the dread of 

evils 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 245 

evils rhat are pofiible, but fl:i!l concealed in futuiity. 
** The Time power,"' thought he, ** who has !;ithcrto 
pro^•ided for me in all things with fuch unexaniplfid 
hounry, will flill continue to exert it in my favour.** 
Thus nis life palfed in tranc|uillity and content. He 
enjoyed inwirdly peace of mind ; and, without, every 
thing promifed him the moll: perfect fecuritv. Happy 
ftate ! May God grant you ail to enjoy the fame ! 

*' Amen," faiii Mrs. Billinglley ; and the company 
feparated. 



TWENTY-SEVENTH EVENING, 

\/TR' Bill. Well, my dear children, I have a gieat 
number of things to relate to you this evening. 

The Children, Oh! fo much the better! that is 
charming I 

Mr, BilL Provided only that I find myfelf able to 
do it. 

The Children, Oh ! dear papa, we (hall take care not 
to interrupt you, fo that }QU will certainly be able to 
get through it. 

Mr. Bill, Well, I fiiall try ; but prepare yourlelves 
for a frefli fcene of horror, the event of which cannot 
be fore fee n — By your motions, 1 can nearly perceive 
what your conjsftures are ; the fequel will fcew v.'hether 
they are ju(h 

If I v;ere to go on now enumerating to you all that 
Robinfon performed every day by the help ot the tools 
with which he was provided, the recited would rot amufe 
you very much. 

Rich. It might be agreeable enough; but we can 
eufily imagine all that. 

Mr, Bill, I can only inform you, that they fuccef- 
fively attempted many different arts, and imitated mofb 
forts of tradefmen— the baker, the blacklmith, the tay- 
lor, the fhoemaker, the carpenter, the joiner, the wheel- 
^'i\^t, the potter, the gardener, the butcher, the hfber- 
*" L 3 man. 



846 T H E N E W 

man, and feveral ethers ; they imitated them, 1 fay, 
with fo much rucccfs, that they were foon able to make 
Dp a hundred things, for which we indolent Europeans 
require as many different workmen. Their ftrength en- 
creaicd in proportion as they exerted it, and tlieir minds, 
b« ing in a ilate of conftant a6tivity, and always in fearch 
of foipe ulciiil (bjeft, were improved every day more 
and more. May not tliis be regarded as a proof that we 
were created for the fame afli\ ity, fince health, virtue, 
and happinefs, are the neceffary confequenccs of it ? 

Six months palfed away in thefe agreeable employ- 
jnents, during ail which time Friday durft not revive the 
fcheme of faking a vo\ age to his own country ; but fre- 
quently, after tinifljing his tafk of work, he would go up 
the hill from whence he could fee his native ifland, and, 
there, buried in profound thoughtfulnefs, he lamented 
ihc misfortune of being feparated from his father, per- 
iiaps for ever. Kohinion, for his part, had avoided 
fpeaking on tj)e fubjeci, becaufe it was not in his power 
to comply with his friend's wi(h while the neceilary ar- 
rangements, which their new way of living required, 
were ftill unfiniOied. 

At prefent the mofl inoifpenfable parts of the bufinefs 
were completed, and Robinfon was the firft to propofe 
the building of another boat, to go and leek Frida}'s 
lather. At this propofai, the young man's icy was as 
great as formerly on the fame otcafion, and histbankful- 
nefs to Robinfon appeared in the fame manner. The 
work was begun the very next day, and, with tire help. 
of good hat' licts, v/as fmifbed, as you may cafily ima- 
gine, much better and much Iboner than the firfl time. ' 

One morning that Robinfon was engaged in the ordi- 
nary cares of his habitation, he fent Friday to the fea- 
fide for fome turtle, which was now become a rarity to 
theff. After a fnort abfence, he came back running at 
full fpeed. Out of breath with running and with fright 
together, he could butjuft ftammer out thefe words, 
•* Here they are ! here they are !" 

Robinfon, in a fright, afKed him hal'lily whom he 
fneant. ** Oh! mafter! mafter!" anfwcred Friday, 
*' one, two, three — fix canoes !" In his flurry he couldl 
fciircely bring out the number fix. -^ 

Rol^i'n^l 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 247 

Robiiifon ran haftil y up to the top of the hillock, and 
faw, not without fliuddering, that Friday had counted 
right. He perceived fix canoes full of favages, jail 
ready to land. Coming down immediately, he bid Fri- 
day be of good courage, who ftood trembling all the 
while J and he afked him, whether, if they (houid come 
to an engagement with the enemy, he would (land by 
him faiihiully, to the beft: of his power. 

** Yes,*' anfwered he, *' to the laft drop of my 
blood i'* for, having had time to recover himfelf, he felt- 
his courage mount by degrees to its ufual pitch. 
** Well," faid Robinfon, ** let us endeavour to prevent 
thefe mongers from executing their horrible defigns. I 
will explain my intention to )ou as we go along; this 
is not the time to talk — we muft a6t." 

With thefe words, he wheeled down one of the car- 
riage guns, took fix mufkets, tv^^o brace of piftols, and 
two hangers. Each of them put a brace of piftols in his 
girdle, a hanger b) his fide, and three muftcets on his 
ihoulder, and when they had taken a fufficient quanti- 
fy of powder and ball, they harneffed themfelves to the 
gun, and with a firm countenance took the field under 
all that formidable and warlike apparatus. 

Having pafTed the drawbridge, they halted. Friday 
went back into the fort to raife the bridge and fhut the 
gate, and then, by means of the ladder of ropes, which 
always hung to the rock, he came out again, and joined 
his general. Robinfon thought this precaution necef-. 
fary, that in cafe their undertaking fiiould not fucceed, 
the enemy might not be able to get pofleflion of his 
fortrefs. 

Here Robinfon explained to Friday the plan that he 
had formed. ** We will go round the hillock," faid 
he, ** and walk through the thickeft part of the wood, 
that we may not be perceived by the enemy ; and, then, 
crofling amongft the thickets, which extend almoft to 
the fea-fide, we (hall approach the favages without be- 
ing perceived by them. When v/ithin reach of them, 
we will fire the great gun, and the ball palling over their 
heads, no doubt, will terrify the barbarians, make 
them abandon their prey, and take to flight in iheir 
canoes." 

L 4 Friday 



^43 T fl E N E W 

Friday thought the plan not impraflicable. *' Thus," 
continued Robinfon, ** we Iball have the fatisfa6lion of 
laving the unfortunate wrcrtlics whcm they intend to 
devour, without Ihedding a drop of blood. But if, 
contrary lo our expcclations, they (hould be encou- 
raged by their number?, and not take to flight, then, 
ray dear Friday, we mull fi;evv that we are men, by 
bravely facing the danger to which we (Tiall expofe our- 
lelvcs from the moll lauda^ble intentions. He, from 
whom nothing is hid, fees what induces us to endanger 
our lives ; he will prcferve them ific be for our advan- 
tage : therefore, his will be done." 

And lb fa}iag, he gave his har»d to his companion, 
and they mutually promifcd to alFift each other to the 
hi\ drop of their blood. 

flaving arrived without nolle almoft at the hfl of the 
thxkets, they there made a halt. Robinibn, in a lo'/f 
voice, defir.d Friday to fleai with all poilible circura- 
ipedion behind a large tree which he fiiewed hiir., and 
then to come back and inform him whether he could 
dilcover the enemy from that fpot. Hi:r brought word 
back that they were eafily to be feen fitting round a 
large tire, and picking the bones of one pri loner whom 
they had already di /'patched ; that, not far from them, 
he faw another lying on the ground, and tied hand and 
foot, who feemed to be a white man, and had the ap- 
pearance of a beard ; and that, in ail probability, he wus 
going loon to fijare the fame fate. 

Kubinfon was (lirtled at . Js report, efpecially when 
he heard mention cf a Vv'hite man. Having a profpeft- 
glafs about him vVhich he h^d fouad aboard the Ihip, he 
went to the tree himfeif, and from thence, by the help 
of this inllruraent, could dilcover that Fridax's account 
was perfectly true. He law about htiy favages fitting 
round a tire, and could clearly dillipguilh the priibaer 
jto be an European. 

i He could icarcely contain hiraf^If ; his heart thro':- 
ted, his blood boiled. If he were to yield to the fury 
of his firfi; paliion, and fall upon thefe barbarians at once, 
it woDld be the way to ihed much blood- But, as the 
ilind inlunct ofpalFion ihould never get the better of 

reaion.

reafon, he rclrjins his tranfports in order to avoid tirac 
unpleafing necelTuy 

At. t;:ere was a Ipot fiirther on equally flieltered with 
thick' ts, he went behind a buili pretty near the lavages, 
and which iiad an opening in the middle of it large 
enough to ice throu ^h, though not to be remarked at a 
d'ftance; there he points his cannon in luch a manner 
that the bill would pal's ofer the heids of the fa\ ages 
high enough nor to hurt tnem. Then he told Friday, 
in a low voice, to imitate exatlly what he ftould fee 
him do. 

He lays down two of his mufliets on the ground, and' 
holds the third in his hand ; Friday d.;e3 fijje fame : he 
then applies n lighted match to the toucli-hole of the- 
cannon, and fires it off. 

At the noife of the report, the favages fell backwards' 
on the grafs as if they liad been all fiioc at once. Ro- 
binfon and Friday, on their fide, attentive- to. what pa(i- 
ed, and uncertain what might be the^ event, prepared for' 
engaging if that ihould happen to be necellary. In li^U 
than a minute the lavages riie o.Tthe'ground, recovering 
from thtir aftor.i0-jment; the moft feajt'ul run to their 
canoes, but the buldel^ take, up their arms. 

Thev had been frighted merely by the noift 0^ the 
cannon j 'hrifcrtunatc-ly, ,they did no: perceive tliQ tire, 
nor' hear the whi'.lling of the ball. The fright was, 
therefore, noi near fj great as had been expeTred. After 
,'looking round nn cv*-ry lide without diicovering any 
thing that coald^ terrify ihim again, ihey gathered cou- 
rage, and thcfe who were running away prcfearly re- 
turned. They all let up a dreadful ycil, and bega-i 
their dance, Ihaking rheir weapons with furious lojks 
afid^ geftufes, 
■^^ Robinfon was undetermined what to do ; bu: o'jftrv- 
ing with furprile, that, v/hen t'^e dance was ended, the 
whole coinpany of the favages not only took tii.i.- ^?rices ^ 
again, but lent two of their number to llize the unfortu- 
nate European, he could not contain himftlf any long^rr. ' 
He looks at Friday, and fays to hiu), in a lov/ \oice, 
** Vou Ctke the right, I the k-ft, and Heaven be our dc- 
feriCe.'*' So faying, he prefents and fires; Friday doc^ 
the fiiie. '

250 THE NEW 

The man took much better aim than the mafker; for 
on tl,e enemy's left there fell five, and on the right only 
three: of thefe eight th.ree were killed, the rell: wound- 
ed. The conllernation with which thofe who were not 
hurt took to flight, cannot be defcribed. Some ran one 
wavjlbme another, all of them yelling in the moll hide- 
ous manner. Robinfon was going to lally out from be- 
hind the buflies, Iword in hand, in order to take advant- 
age of their rout, and deliver the unfortunate European, 
V'ho lay bound hand and foot; but he faw, with aflo- 
jjifhment, a party of the runaways rally dll of a fudden, 
and ftand upon their defence. He made haf^e to take 
up a lecond mulket, and Friday doing the lame, they 
both fired at on^e. 

At this difcharge there fell only two of the enemy ; 
but feveral of them being wounded, ibme more, fome 
lefs dangeroudy, began to run away, howling dread- 
fully ; prefently, three of them fell down, but llill with 
Ibme remains of life. 

Robinfon, when he hid down the gun that he had 
juft fired, to take up the third, which was ftill loaded, 
laid to Fridav in a loud voice, ** Now let us fliew our- 
lelves :" at the fame inftant, they both ftatt from their 
concealment, and appear before the favages, Robinfon 
flies to the unfortunate p/ifoner, to fhew him that relief 
was at hand ; but as he approaches him, perceives that 
fome of the favages, who before were running away, 
nov/ that they dilcovtred their enemy, flopped fhort, 
and rallied to prepare for combat. He noticed this 
EG Friday, who perfe(5lly undcr/lood his mafter's mean- 
ing, advanced a little Way, fired, and faw one of the In- 
dians fall. 

In the mean time, Robinfon, v/ith his knife, cut the 
hu'.rufnes v.'ith which the prifoner's hands and feet were 
tied, and afking him in Englilh and Latin who he was, 
fhe man anfwcred in Lutin, Lhriijian s, Hifpanus ; that 
js, a Chriflian and a Spaniard. His ^xceffive weaknefs 
hindered him from faying any more. Fortunately, Ro- 
binfon had taken care to provide a bottle of wine, m cafe 
of being wounded. He gave tlie Spaniard a littie, which 
revived him exceedingly, \o that he foon began to re- 
move- his fuength, Robinfon then furnilVitd him with a 

h-.r.ger

hanger and a piftol, that he might help them to com- ■ 
plete the defeat of the favages, and, mean time, Friday 
was ordered to bring all the mufliets, that they might be 
loaded afrefh. 

The moment the Spaniard was armed with a hanger 
and a piflol, he fell furioufly upon his enemies, and dil- 
patched two of them in the twinkling of an eye. Fri- 
day, with the fixth mudcet, which had not been fired 
yet, advanced to fupport hiii', while Robinfon was 
haftening to load the other five. The two champions 
found lome refiflance at firft, and were foon f<.'parated ; 
for the Spaniard came to clofe engagement v.iili 
a very flout Indian, and Frida} , on the other hand, atter 
firing his laft mufkei, purlued, fword in hand, a vviiole 
party of runaways, fom.e of whom fell beneath his arm, 
others jumped into the Tea to fwim to their canoes, and 
^he reft fied and hid themfelves amongfl the bufhes. 

But the Spaniard was now hard put to it. He had, it 
is true, at firil, notwithftanding his weaknefs, attacked 
Ik's Indian with great impetuofity, and given him two 
wounds in the heid with his hanger: but this lb en- 
raged the lavage, that with his heavy ft-one falchion he 
was near cutting the Spaniard down,, who found it as 
much as he could do to parry off his blows: nor, in- 
deed, could he at length prevent the furious Indian from 
ieizing him by rlie middle, throwing him to the ground, 
and twilling the hanger out of iiishand ; b^it in the verv 
moment that he v/as going to cut off his head, Kobin- 
Ibn, perceiving the Spaniard's danger, fired at the la- 
\age, and kiUtd hiui on the fpot. 

Iicarce was the Spaniaid railed from the grouqd be- 
fore he feised a 1 jaded mulket, 'dud went with Friday in 
purluic of the lavages who had fled into the coppice. 
As they were few in number, and for t!ie moil part 
wounded, Robinien though: it bell to remain on the

*' But if we fu ffcr them to efcape," replied Friday,

** Well," anfwered Robinfon, clapping him on the

Mr, EiU. It was certainly acting with prudence and- 
humanity. It would have been too cruel to kill,, with-- 
outneceflity, a fingle one of thefe unfortunate wretches,, 
who had nc^ the leaft fufpition that there was any harm 
in what they were doing, and who, on the contrary,

Mr. Bill, M) dear friend, how could they have

Edux\ Hey-day ! Why any little child knows that 
it is not right to kill a man and then eat him. 

Mr, Eill, But how does the little child know this? 
Is it not by being early lb inllru6ted ? 

Ednjj. Yes, certainly* 

Mr, Bill, And if he had never been inHructed on the

he ought to love and refpeO:, had always told him that 
it is a very laudable action to kill one's enemy, and eat. 
his body ? 

Edvj. Nay, v^hy — to be fure— then

good and evil, jaflice and injuflice. 

Our hero, the friend of human kind, (bed tears of

twenty men, and the victorious army, far from havingloll 
any, had only one wounded ;. the Spaniard, when he 
was thrown down, had received a fevete bruife. 

Harriet. But how came this Spaniard amongft the 
favages, papa ? 

Mr. Bill. That is more than Robinfon himfelf has

TV/ENT Y-EIGHT H EVENING,

what brought him amongft the favages ? 

Mr. Bill, Have a little patience, and you fiiall hear. 
Some incidents happened in the meaji time wliich I 
inuft f rft rehte to you. 

Rich. Indeed! well, that roufes my curiofity. 

Mr. Bill, Robinfon, having a mind to e:<arnine one cf 
the two canoes which the favages had Itk behind them, 
went towards it, and, to his great aftonilbm.ent, he 
found in it another unfortunate creature, tied hand and 
foot as the Spaniard had been, ard lookij.'g more dead 
than alive. 

Robinfon m.adehafle to cut his cords, and would have 
lifted him up, but he was net able either to. Hand or 
fpeuk. He lay groaning, no doubt, under the apprehen- 
fioa that they were going :o put him to d^-Alh. 



-54 THE NEW 

As he was an Indian, not an European, Robiiifon call- 
ed I'rida} , who \v;is then biify in burying the dead bo- 
dies, to Ipe^k to hiiu in his native tongue. Scarce had 
he caft eyes on the prilbner before Kobinfon and the 
Spaniard law a Iccne take place wliich drew from thcin 
tears of benevolent i^nipachy. Friday, all of a fuddeu, 
like a man befide hin;ielf, Hies to the prifoner, embraces 
him, locks him in his arms, cries, lauglis, jumps, dances, 
roars, clafps his hands, flrikes liimfclf on the face and 
breaft, cries out again, and, in Ihort, a6ts like oiie that 
is delirious. It was fome time before Rubinfon, who 
queftioned and urged him rt peatedly, could draw fioin 
him this flioH anlV/er, ** It i3 my UthK^v !'* 

It would be difficult to defcribeall the marl:s of filial 
love and afPeclicn which this excellent young man fliew- 
e6 upon this occafioii. Twenty times he je.mped out 
cf the canoe upon land, and from the land into the 
canoe again, bcmttimes, fitting tiown, he opened his 
j-acket, and preffed his father's head to his Hofom ta 
warm it -, at others, he rubbed the joints of his arm* 
and legg, which were numbed by having been fo tight- 
Iv bound ; and now he em^'^aced hiui again, and cover- 
ed hiui with kilfes. RubiiU'un, who had dill fome wine 
in his bottle, gave it to h'm to walli his father's limbs, 
which were grievouHy fwelled. He then Hepped afide to 
let Friday indulge his joy with more freedom. 

Returning after feme time, he alked him if he had 
made his father take any nouriOiment. *' The glutton." 
anfwertd he, pointing t j hiuiLeif, '* had before eaten 
up all." Robinlon gave him his breakfiift, which he had 
nor touch<.d, and Friday gave it to his father, bcarce 
had he received it when hi; Ion Itarted out of the canoe 
in a hurry, and went oft (o quick, chat before Robinfon 
had time to fay. Where are you going, Ftidiiy was aU 
ready out of nght. 

He foon appeared again, but did not come back witli 
quite fuch expedition. When he was pretty n<.ar,they 
co'jld leethathe had a pitcher of water in one hand, and 
Ibme victuals in the other. He gave the v/ater to his 
father, and the victuals to his mailer in return for the 
breakfafi which he had received from him. The cold 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 255 

water afforded vifible refreftiment to the old man, who 
was ready to faint with thirft. 

Robinlbn then turned towards the Spaniard, who, ex- 
haufted with fatigue, was lying ftretched upon thegrafs. 
He made Friday help him alfo to fome refrefliment. The 
Spaniard, by his looks, endeavoured to exprefs his gra- 
titude. He flrove to rife, but was not able, being pre- 
vented by the pain that he felt in the joints of his hands 
and feet, which were fwelled from haung been bound fo 
very tightly. Friday was ordered to fit down befide him, 
to bathe his arms and legs with wine, and to take the 
fame care of him as he had of his fither. 

It was truly moving to behold this afFedionate fon, 
who, while he attended, the i:paniard, turned his head 
every moment towards his fatlier to fee how he was. At 
one time, when the old man, in order to repofe himfelf, 
lay down at full length, Friday, quite uneafy, fiew to 
hin; without fpeaking a word ; but when he faw that his 
father had only lain down fo be more at his cafe, he re- 
turned in a moment, and continued his attention to the 
Spaniard. Robinfon now had a mind to try whether 
lie could not, with Friday's afiiflance, convey the Spa- 
niard to the canoe; but Friday, who was young and 
flrong, took that talk upon himfelf alone, and c.inied 
him with eafe upon his (houlders. When they had 
placed in the other canoe, not only the cannon and the 
mufkets, but alfo all the arms of the conquered Indians, 
Friday quickly entered the firft, and, though the wind 
began to frelhen, and was rather againft him, yet he made 
fuch fpeed, by dint of rowing, that Robinfon, who ran 
on foot along the fea-fide, could by no means equal the 
fwiftnefs of the canoe. He was fcarce halfway home 
when he fdvv Friday returning, who palfed by him ia 
his way to fetch the other canoe; and before Robin- 
Ibn could get up to the lirll:, where the Spaniard and 
Friday'^ father were, Friday was there with the fecond : 
with fuch rem.arkable fwiftnefs did he row. 

They Vvere now oppofiTe their dwelling place. Ro- 
binfon haftened thither for fome planks and poles, which 
he put together in the form of a litter or bier, to convey 
the difabled men to his habitation witli more eafe. He 
and Friday carried them up, one after the other. What

a trciifure was here fur RoMiifon* who longed for no-

the future, he need not apprehend bein^ forced to lead 
a life of folitude ajjin. His T tisfadion was complete.. 
As the two invalids feenied co hi\e occafion fur nothing 
fo much a3 red:, Robinfon prefently warmed fon^e wine 
to bathe their bruiftd li.ubs, while Friday made them 
up a bed, on which, wlien ready, they delayed not to 
repole themielves. 

The two hofis then prepared a good fuppcr. Friday 
was ordered to go to the park-, and tring home a young 
lanvi ; Robinfon undertook all the reft. He could not 
help Imiling frequently at the thought that he (hould' 
nowrefcmble a king l^ill more than ever. The whole' 
ifland was under his cloiv.inion j all his fubjefts were in- 
debted to him for their lives, acknowledged his will as 
their fuprejrie law, and were bound to expofe theni- 
felves in iiis caufe to the greatef: dangers if necelfary- 
One circumftance was remarlcal'le, that he counted in- 
his dominions as Uiany different fe(5t3 of religion as he 
h-id fubjeds. Friday had ad. pted hii mailer's rel^gion^ 
which v/as the Prutcfta'nt ; the Spaniard was a Roman 
Catholic, and Frida\'s fither was an idolater: 

** What is to ledone in this miatter ?" faid Robin- 
fon to himfelf : *' have I not a right to oblige them all 
to enibrx? the belief which I think bell?" He was fome 
time reticcjng on this fubjetl, becaufe it was one that- 
had never erig-ged his thoiights before.

Rich, 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 2^-7 

Rich, What would be the confequence ? When a. 
man is forced to believe, he becomes neither the ho- 
nefier nor the wifer for ir. 

Mi\ Bill. That is true, for violence can never con- 
vince hi.Ti thai he was in an error before ; and o^ what 
ufv? can profeliing be, when it does not proceed from 
con^i6l!o^. Bellde?, how is a man certain that he w!;om

Henry. Certainlv, that might be the cafe, 
■ Mr. Bill. How'ib ? 

Henry. Becaufe every rnan is Hubie to be deceived. 

'Mr, Bill. Coafcquently, no man has a light to ad- 
vance his opinions as inconteiliable truths. 

In fine, my dear children, it belongs to God alone to 
be the infallible judge of our belief: he alone can de- 
cide on the truth or falfehood of our opinions: none:' 
but he can know perfedly whether our fearch after the 
truth has been earneft and fincere, or Cight and negli- 
gent ; nor is there any but he who can judge how far 
our errors are to be imputed to us* 

Robinfon faw this matter nearly in the fame light. 
*' Far from me,'* faid he, " be the indifcreet zeal' 
which endeavours to force men into its beli-'f! Far 
from me be the blind frenzy ofperfecuting and torturing 
fellow-creatures, merely becaule they have the misfor- 
tune to be deceived, or the virtue to refafe profefHng 
publicly that of which they are not convinced inwardly. 
In my illand, at leaft, fuch injuftice {hail never find a 
pfece. 1 will do every thing in my power to enlighten 
my new fubjedb; but if \ am not happy enough to 
convince them of their errors, or of the truth of my reli- 
gion, then I (ball leave them to beiieve what they can 
believe, and to give an account of their faith, not to me, 
who am their equal, and liable to error, but to God- 
alone, the lineiring judge of all.*' 

He, therefore, reiolved, that all, Vv^ithout diiKnflion, 
(houid enjoy the free exercile of their religion, if it 
fhould fo happen, that, notwiihflanding previous in- 
fcru<S>!on, ihty could not agree amongd tlieuiftives upo.i-

Friday 



3s8 T H E N E W 

Friday being now returned, they forthwith proceeded 
to get ready the fupper. " Let us celebrate this day," 
faid Robinfon, ** as a double feftival : on the one hand, 
we have relcucd two fellow-creatures from the vora- 
city of thofe raonflers in human f})apej on the other 
hand, you have found your fatJier.'* 

Friday had no occafion to be exhorted to rejoice; in- 
deed, his heart had never experienced fuch joy before, 
ind he Qiewed it continually, by finging, jumping, and 
laughing, all the while that he performed whit he had 
to do with equal diligence and exaftnefs. Chearful- 
nefs and gaiety, far from being a fault, is ever an ami- 
able quality, when, inftead of making us abfent and ncg- 
leftful, it chears us in ou/ labours. 

The two guefts now awoke. Although they fiill felt 
fome pain, yet they found themfelves confiderably re- 
lieved, and able, with the alfiftance of Robinfon and 
Friday, to rife and fit at table. The old Indian feemed 
as much ftrack and afloniflied at every thing that he be- 
held, as his fon had formerly been on his firft feeing the 
cffeds of European induftry. 

Friday a£ted as interpreter in theconverfation that his 
mafter had with the old man and the Spaniard. 

Geo. Did Friday underfland Spanifb ? 

Mr, Bill. No ; but the Spaniard, who had been fix 
months amongft the favages, could fpeak the language 
of Friday's country tolerably well, ib that he could un- 
derhand him. The following is the fubfiance of his 
account : 

■ ** Our fliip was bound to the Coaft of Africa for 
flaves. We were returning from thence, having ex- 
changed all our goods for gold duft, elephants teeth, 
and negroes. We had taken a hundred flaves on board, 
and were carrying them to Barbadoes to fell th^^m : 
twenty of them died on account of our ftowing ihein 
too clofe one upon another. A violent gale of wind, 
which lafted fevcral days, drove us out of our courfe, 
and carried us towards the Coaft of Brafil. Our ftiip 
fprung a leak, fo that v/e durfi not trufbourielves out to 
fea again, but coaft along the main land. Suddenly we 
were attacked by another gale from the Wed, that car- 
ried us off ihe coart, and, in the night, we ilruck upon 

fome 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 259 

fome rocks not far from an ifland. We fired feveral 
guns, and made other (ignals of diftrefs, being refolved 
not to quit the (hip until the laft extremity. We fet 
the blacks free, that they might afTifl: us in pumping, 
as the fl)ip leaked in more places than one ; but the mo- 
ment they faw themfelves at liberty, they, with one ac- 
cord, feized our boats, being determined, by means of 
them, to favc their lives, and efcape from their mailers. 

* What could we do ? It was impofiible for us to have 
recourfe to force ; we were but fifteen againft four fcore, 
and befides, the greateft part of them were armed. On 
the other hand, how could we think of remaining oa 
board a wreck without a fingle boat ? This w^ould have 
been expofing ourfelvcs to certain death. We remon- 
ftrated with them, and even entreated them ; we endea- 
voured, by our fupplications, to prevail or. thofe, who 
had lately been our flaves, either to remain with us or 
take us with them. Here I cannot help fpeaking fn th^ 
higheft terms of the humanity and generoGty of thefe 
blacks. Though they had received the moft rigorous 
treatment from us, yet they were moved with compaf- 
fion, and fuffered us to get into the boats, on conditioa 
that we gave up our arms. Wc jumped in, therefore, 
difarmed, and the boats were fo over-loaded that weex- 
peded to fink every moment. 

* However, we did every thing in our power to reach 
the ifland, but fuddenly the wird changed, and carried 
us out to fea in fpite of the laborious exertions of the 
rower?. Our deftruftion now appeared no longer a 
matter ofdoubt : neverthelefs, the boats, though over- 
loaded and toft about by the moft violent waves, ftill 
had che good fortune to live ; and, contrary to all ex- 
pectation, without lofing a fingle man, we were carried 
to an ifland perfedtly unknown to us, where the inhabi- 
tants, fimple and humane, received us with the moft 
hofpitable benevolence. 

* We have lived with them ever fince, in the beft man- 
ner we could, but ftill very indifferently. Thefe poor fa- 
vages have nothing themfelves to fubfift on but fiftiing, 
and a few fruits which the ifland produces fpontaneoufly. 
They ftiared their little ftockof provifions with us chear- 
fully, and ftiewed us their manner of fiftiing, that we 

might

m]ght odrfulves provide a partofoiir fubfiflence. T'he ne^ 
grofs were net lb iil oft" as we, both becaure they were 
?.c. u'lomed nearly tj the fliine way of living, and alfo 
bcc.;ufe they had recovered their frecriom. 

* Some d•i,l^ ^go, this illand was invaded by a nation 
tfjieighbourinpr Indians. Every one took up arms, and 
we fliould have thought ou!rQ;Iyes vv;anting in tfi'e moft 
elfential duty of fociet) li vv:e had not' afTi'lled people 
from whom we had received fuch , friendly 'entertain- 
ment, i fcTught by the fide of thi^ fir'av'e ol'tf man, who, 
iii;e an enraged lion, threw himfelf' into the hottefi: of 
the combat. I {nw liim fui rounded, and would have 
relcued him, but had the misfortune to be made pri- 
foner along witli him. • ". .. 

* In this dreadful captivity we paireil.twp days aqd two 
nights, bound hand and foot, without resjei ving any 
nourilLment. They now 'and then threw us pieces of 
fiinking fill), fuch as the fea lefc dead on the beach ; and 
thefe ihcy cafl to us v. iih as much difdain as If wc had 
been the vilefc of animals. 

* This morning, at break of daj;,^ we were dragged to 
the canoes in order to be conveyed to the place where 
thefe barbarians were accullomtd to .devour th_ir vic- 
tims. Providence brougiit you to our a^fifrance ; ge* 
nerous men ! you delivered us; fo that we Kave re- 
ceived more at your hands than ever we fhall be able to 
repay you.'V 

Here the Spaniard was filent ; being penetrated ulLh 
gratitude, he (bed ab^indance of tears. Robinfo'n, for 
his part,, was delighted to tind that his former conjec- 
tures were amply connrmed, and Friday joijied him in 
admiring the wildom and goodnefs of Providence. 

The Spaniard, on being afried who owned the fliip's 
cargo, a:-fwered, that the velTel had been fitted out by 
tw^o merchants of Cadiz ; that one of chem had given ah 
order for the purchafe ot" !iav-r, but the other, deteftiog 
this traffic, deHred to have gold-dull in retarn for his. 
goods. 

Upon this, Robinfon took the Spaniard by the hand, 
led him to his cellar, then to the il;orehou!e, and (ji^wed 
him the mofc valuable effcds of the wreck fafely iiov/ei 
in both places. FriJay took upon him to recite the par- 
ticulars 



ROBINSON CRUSOE, 261 

^iculars .concerning them, and the Spaniard was fo 
liruck wic!i a(loni(bmeiit that he could ("carce utter a 
word. 

Rob'nfon enquired alfo in refjiedt to the owner of the 
diamonds and tlie officer's die fs. He was told that they 
were both part of the efTcfts of an ^ngl''nb officer, who, 
having rcHded many years in the Laft Indies, was re- 
lurn'ng to Hngland, but, falling fick on his way home, 
he defired to be fet aOiore on the coaft of Africa, where 
he died, and his effects were put on board the Spanifh 
fbip, to he conveyed to Larbadoes, whence they were 
afterwards to be fent to England. 

Robinfon fbewed him alio fhe papers that he had 
taken out of the fhip ; by means of which the Spaniard 
learnt the name of the merchant to whom the gold-dufl: 
belonged, and alfo that of the officer's v/idow to whom 
the diamonds and cloaths fhould be reflored. From that 
moment Robinfon looked upon the gold- dull", the dia- 
monds, and the papers, as a lacrcd depoHt entrufted to 
his care. 

Night approaching, all parties found tbemfelves fo- 
exhaulled by the fatigues and dangers of the day, that 
eaffh one had occafion to retire earlier than ufual to feck 
refrenment in lleep. They did, therefore, what we 
(hall alfo do as foon as we have returned thanks to God 
for having this day permitted us to enjoy uninterrupted 
happinels and tranquillity.

JT^y?. BILL, The next morning Robinfon afTem- 
bled all the (Irength of his empire, in order to per- 
form an office which required this jundlion, and which 
could not be put off. There was reafon to ft- a r that the 
ftench of the dc-ad bodies of th^: Indians iliiin t\\& day 
l)efore might have a dangerous eHett up-jn the air : they 
provided themfcives, therefore, ea^h with a ' hatchet, 
and repaired to this fcene of horror. 



//'■'.'7. Wirb hatchets 



Mr. HdL Yes; not to dig graven: if that ijad been 
the dcfi^ii, they would have provided themfelves with

(hovels, fpades, and pickaxes ; but they intended to cut 
down wood, and make a pile to burn all the bodies to 
aflies. 

Rich. That was the cuftom of the Romans. 

Mr. Bill. And many other nations belides. Robinfon 
did not chufe to imitate the imprudence of his country- 
men, who, at that time, buried their dead in the midft 
of towns, and even within their churches, where confe- 
quently the living muft breathe an air infedted by the 
diforders of the dead. 

Harriet. Hey ! why they do fo (lill, papa. 

Mr, Bill. Yes, unfortunately, they do lb. Let this ex- 
ample make you fenfible how difficult it is for men to 
abolifh ancient cuftoms, though univerfally acknow- 
ledged to be pernicious: wherefore, I advifc you, by 
early application, to acquire wifdomand virtue. If once 
we adopt error and vice, if unfortunately we become 
familiar to them, how difficult is it to get rid of them, 
even when we are fenfible of their danger .' 

Every body knows in this age that the (lench of dead 
bodies is poifon to the living ; and yet nobody fcru- 
ples to depofit them in burying-grounds in the midft of. 
cities^ or even in the vaults of churches, where they are 
not fo much as covered with earth. Another century 
and more will elapfe before people will think ferioufly 
of abolilhing fo pernicious acuftom. 

Henry. 1 wi(h 1 were a perfon in Authority ! I (houtd 
fettle that matter. 

Mr. Biil, This, ray dear, is one of the principal mo- 
tives that fhould induce you to acquire all the good qua- 
lities and all the merit pollible : then, dillinguifhed by 
your countrymen, they will honour you with their con- 
fidence, and confer on you dignities which will autho- 
rize you to reform dangerous abufes, and to introduce 
wholelbme culloms. Heaven feems to intend each of 
you to be one day of the number of thofe who are en- 
trultcd with the power of promoting your country's 
happinefs. Every thing that is neceifary for your attain- 
ing lb exalted a trurt, (he goodnels ofProvidence has be- 
ftowed upon tou. You are born of enlightened and 
virtuous parents, who enjoy the confidence and love of 
their country ; you are endowed with the happiert qua- 

lihcations 



ROBINSON CRUSOE, 263 

lifications of body and mind, which have never yet been 
Ipoiled J and, I may venture to affirm, that you are re- 
ceiving an education which few men have the happi- 
nefs to receive. It would be a difgrace to any of you 
to fruftrate the good intentions of Providence, which 
has done every thing to enable you to become men of a 
iuperior clals, and capable of the greatefl: things. Your 
behaviour affords not the fmalleft doubt in that refpett* 
If, as I hope, you fhould fulfil your honourable deftiny, 
if you (hould arrive one day or other at the rank of thole 
powerful men whofe anions affedt the happinefs of fo 
many thoufands, make ufe of the authority entrufted 
to you to leiTen the evils and promote the good of your 
fellow-creatures ; fcatter round you joy, profperity, 
and happinefs. Remember then, alfo, what has now 
given rife to this paternal exhortation, and, if poflTible, 
prevail upon your countrymen to bury the dead ia 
places where the ftench of their bodies may not injure 
the health of the living. 

Ediv> Have patience ! Let me try what I can do. 
When i go to town, I will fpeak of ic to mj grand-papa 
and my uncles ; they will take care to manage it, 

Mr. Bill. Do, my dear. Robinfon and his com- 
panions, having burned the dead bodies, returned to the 
dwelling-place. In the mean time, Friday informed 
his father of the horror wherewith civilized nations look 
upon the eating of hum?.n fle(h ; which appeared very 
ftrange to the old man. But Friday, having repeated to 
him all that he had hi-nfeif learned from his mafter on 
the lubje6l, gave him at length a difgull to the barbarous 
curtom. As the fon wa3 called Friday, Robinfon gave 
the father the name 0^ Thurfday, and thus we (hall call 
him for the future. 

Robinfon fummoned them all to council, where Fri- 
day ll:ill ferved as interpreter, and his matter, as chief, 
opened the aifembly with the following fhort I'peech : 

** My dear friends, all who are prelent fee themfelves 
now in poffellion of whatever can contribute to render 
their lives peaceable and commodious : neverthelefs, I 
feel, that, m the enjoyment of thefe good things, my 
heart will never tind latisfadion while 1 know that there 
are perfons who have a greater right to them than I 

have. 



264 THE N E W 

have, antl yet largullli in tJie want of them. I fpeak of 
vour countrymen, my deur friend, my dear Eu'opean ; 
I fpcak of the SjKiniards who are now amongO the fa- 
vagcr. I wilh that each of you would communicate to 
me his advice and opinion concerning' the properefi: 
means for bringing thofe unfortunate people hithet, and 
making them fbare the fame lot with us." 

After he had tinifhed, each gave his opinion in his 
turn. Thf" Spaniard tirft offered to go for them, all 
alone, in one of the canoes that they had taken from the 
Indians. Thurfday declared that he was ready to un- 
dertake the fame expedition. Friday was of opinion, 
that his father, on account of his age, (hould remain on 
the ifland, and that he himfelf, who was fitter for tU^ cn- 
terprize, fljould accompany the Spaniard. A generous 
conteft arole between the father and fon, which of them 
fl]ould expofe his life; and Robinfon was obliged to in- 
terpcfe, and terminate it by a decision to which they 
fubjTiitted without murmuring. He pronounced, that 
Thurfday and the Spaniard Ihould mak-e the projected 
attempt, and that Friday Ihouid remain wit-li him. 

Charhtte. But why d'.d not he fend Frida; , papa, ra- 
ther than the poor old man ? 

Mr. hill. His atieclionate friendfliip for Friday would 
not permir him. to expofe him to a danger which he 
himlclfdid not fiiare with him. Befidcs, the father 
knew the fea, and could navigate it better than the 
fon. As to the Spaniard, there was a necelhty that he 
iiiould go, becaufe, it he did not, his countrymen would, 
perhaps, not accept Robinion's invitation 

it was, therefore, agreed, that they IliOald fet fail to- 
gether as foon as they all four had nnilhed ploughing 
and fowing a field at leafl ten times larger than that 
which ihey cultivated before, becaufe the encreafe of 
the colony would neceliarily occafion a greater con* 
I'jniption of food. 

Each of them, therefore, turned ploughman for fome 
weeks, and as they all laboured with a good will, the 
work was both \ery well and veiy fpeedily performed. 
At the end of a fortnight they were ready to prepare for 
the vovage. 

Before 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 265 

Before their departure, die Spaniard gave a proof not 
only of his honefty and gratitude towards Robinson, 
but alfo of his prudence and circumfpcflion. He re- 
prefented, that the other Spaniards were, like himCelf, 
no more than common Tailors, and, confequently, peo- 
ple without education ; that he did not know ihem 
fufficiently to anfwer for their behaviour ; and that, 
therefore, he was of opinion, that Robinfon, as malier of 
the ifland, lliould draw up an agreement, exprefling the 
conditions upon which they fhould be received, and that 
none fhould be admitted without previoufly accepting 
his terms. 

Robinfon, delighted with this proof of his n^ew fub- 
jedl's fidelity, immediately purfued his advice. The 
agreement which he drew up in confequence of it, was 
worded as follows : 

** All perfons who are defirous of refiding in Robin- 
fon Crulbe's ifland, and of enjoying there the conveni- 
encies of life which they are invited to (hare, muft 
confent, 

** In the firft place, to conform in every thing to the 
will of the lawful mafter of the ifland, and to fubmit 
chearfully to whatfoever laws and regulations the faid 
mafter (hall judge necedary for the good of the ter- 
ritory. 

*' Secondly, to be atllve, fober, and virtuous ; for no 
idle, drunken, vicious peribn will be tolerated in this 
ifland. 

*• Thirdly, to abftain from all quarrels, and, in cafe 
of receiving offences, by no meass to become judges in 
their own caufe, but to carry their com.plaints before the 
niafter of the ifland, or the perfon to whom he ihall de- 
legate the office of judge. 

" Fourthly, to join, without murmuring, in all the 
labours which the good of the community Ihajl require, 
and, in cafe of necelfity, to aflift the mafter of the ifland 
at the hazard of their lives. 

*' Fifthly, fliould any perfon prefume to oppofe any 
one of thefe jufl laws, all the other members of the 
community fhall be bound to unite againft him, either 
to oblige him to return to his duty, or to baniih him for 
ever from the ifland. 

M «« Every 



^66 T H E N E W 

** Every one Is advifed to confider thefe articles ma- 
turely, and not to fign them (which would be equal 
to the obligation of an oath), unlefs he is firmly re- 
solved to abide by the conditions of them. 

Signed Robi nson Crusoe," 

It was fettled that the Spaniard (hould tranflate this 
agreement into his native language, and take pen and 
ink with him, that his countrymen might fign it before 
they embarked. 

They next chofe the bed of the canoes, and prepared 
for their departure. 

Geo. But was there room in one canoe for all the 
Spaniards? 

Mr, Bill. No.j they only wanted this canoe to fail 
to (he other iHand: for their return they could ufe the 
boats belonging to the Spanilh (hip, v/hich, as the Spa- 
niard declared, were ftill in very good condition. 

When their provifions were laid in, the wind being 
favourable, the two deputies fet fail, after taking a 
friendly leave of Robinfon and Friday. The latter was 
fo afiefted at the feparation, that even the day before 
his forrow had caufcd him to (hed tears for hours toge- 
ther, and took from him all defire of nourilhment. At 
the moment of his father^'s departure he became incon- 
folable. Every now and then he embraced him, and 
bedewed him with his tears. It was not without forae 
difficultv that the old man could efcape from him to 
enter the canoe, and, even after they had pufhed off 
from (hore, Friday threw himfelf into the fea, and fwam 
to the fide of the boat, to fhake hands with his father 
once more, and give him his laft farewell, which was 
almoft ftified with fobs. On his return alhor.e ht fat 
down upon a rifing ground, where he remained fighing 
and (bedding tears with his eyes fixed upon the canoe, 
which fcudded before the wind until he had entirely loft 
fight of it. 

Robinfon, to amufe hinx, fpent .the red o{ the day 
with him in itooting game, and travcrfing the hills. 
They had not gone very far, when the fpaniel, that ac- 
companied them, (topped at the foot ot a rock all over- 
^«)wn with bulhes, and fell a barking, They went up 

to 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 267 

to him, and obferved a hole in the rock, which a man 
could not enter without creeping. 

RobinfoHjWho loved minutely to examine every thing 
that drew his attention, defired Friday to try if he could 
get into the hole, who, in making the trial, had fcarce put 
his head withinfidc, before he drew it out again in a hur- 
ry, uttered a dreadful roar, and ranawa\ with thegreatefl 
terror and precipitation, never once liilening to Hobin- 
fon's voice, who called him back repeatedly. At length, 
overtaking him, Robinfbn alked, with much fii'-prife, 
why he had run away. ** Ah !" replied he, fcarce 
able to fpeak, ** ah ! my dear mailer, let us run, let us 
fave ourfelves with the utmoft fpeed. In that cave is a 
moft terrible monfter; his eyes are like burning fire, 
and his throat fo wide that he could fwallow us both at 
once." 

** A monftrous throat indeed !" fald Robinfon : *^ I 
fhould be curious to fee it." 

*' Ah!" cried Friday, failing on his knees, *' for 
Heaven's fake do no fuch thing. The monfter would 
infallibly devour you, and then poor Friday would have 
no mafter." ** Has it devoured you ?" faid Robinfon, 
fmiling. Here Friday hefitated to anfwer. His matler, 
therefore, defired him to haften to the dwelling-place, 
and fetch a lantern. In the mean time, he went back to 
the rock, and ftood fentinel before the hole, with his 
mufket in his hand. 

Robinfon faid to himfelf, ** What could Friday have 
feen to terrify him fo? Was it a wild bead? a lion ? a 
tiger? a panther ? or any fuch animal ? In that cafe it 
would certainly be rafh of me to enter the hole. But 
if there were fuch animals in this ifland, I fliould have 
feen forae of them long before now. Belides, if it had 
been one, Friday could not have efc^ped its claws. No, 
no; it is no luch thing. His fearful nefs has deceived 
him, and made him fancy he faw what really was not 
there to be feen. I will know what it is, were it only to 
cure this good young man of his childiih aptnefs to be 
frightened. 

Friday now arrives with the lantern lighted. He en- 
deavoured once mere, with tears in his eyes, to dilFuade 
his mafter from expofing himfelf to a dang-.-r which he 

M 2 laid 



26S r% E N E W' 

!uid was To evident, and in which he would inevitably 
meet his ruin. Robiiifon was a (Iranger to fear ; when 
he had once determined upon a ftep from mature reflec- 
tion, he was afterwards immoveable : exhorting Friday, 
therefore, to take courage, he advanced boldly to- 
wards the cavern, with a lantern in one hand, and a load- 
ed pirtol in the otlier. 

His head was fcarce withinfide of tliehole, when, by 
the feeble light of the lantern, he perceived an objeft 
which really made him fliudder ; neverchelefs, he did 
not run away. Holding his lantern farther in, the bet- 
ter to difcovcr this unknown moiifter, he found it to be 
a lama that was dying of old-age. Looking round, and 
perceiving no other animal but this harmlefs lama, he 
crept entirely into the Ciivern, and bid Friday follow 
him. 

The poor fellow was all of a tremble, yet he could 
not think of abandoning his mafter ; he, therefore, made 
a noble effort to overcome his fear, and, in Ihort, had 
the courage to creep into the hole after him, where he 
law with aflonifliment how much his fright had deceived 
him with regard to the great fiery eyes and huge throat 
of the animal. 

As he entered, Robinfon faid to him, fmiling, 
" Well, Friday, you fee what fear can make us be- 
lieve. Now, where are the great blazing eyes ? Where 
is that prodigious throat that you faw ?" 

Fnd. And yet I really thought I fav/ them ; nay, 1 
could have fworn it. 

Roi>. That you thought fo I have not the leaft doubt; 
but you ought to have known how deceitful fear is, and 
that its dfclufions make us feem to fee a thoufand things 
which never exifted. Believe me, Friday, it is the 
foundation of all (lories concerning ghofls, and I know 
not what idle fancies of the fame fort. The firft tellers 
of thefe abfurd tales were fearful old women, or coward- 
ly men of the fame fhmp. They imagined, like you, 
that they faw fomethi g which they did not fee; and, 
like you too,jultnow, tiiey would have fworn that they 
faw what they did not fee. Be a man, Friday j for the 
future alv/ays look twice ; and baniih from your breaft 

this 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 269 

this fearfulnefs, which would be fcarce excufable in a 
girj. FriHa}' proniifed to do his heft. 

While they were talking, the old lama expired. Ro- 
binibn and Friday dragged it out of the hole, in order 
to bury it. They next more attentively examined the 
fpot where thev were, and found it to be a very ipaci- 
ous and agreeable cave, which they might in future tura 
to advantageous ufes. It appeared as if hewn cut by 
defign : it was cool without the leail dampnefs, and the 
walls, which feemed to be of cryilal, refle*Sted the light 
from all fides with as much fplendour as if it had beta a 
drawing-room brilliantly li^ht d up. - 

Robinfon refolved to convert it into an agreeable re- 
treat, where he might enjoy a refreOiing coolnefs during 
the hotter parr of the day, and alfo lodge any of his pro- 
vifions that were liable to be fpoiled by the heat. Lucki- 
ly it was no more than a (hort mile from the dwelling- 
place, whither Friday prefently repaired, and brought 
back tools, with which they both fell to work to enlarge 
the entrance. They intended to make a door, and this 
tafk employed them agreeably during the abfence of their 
two deputies* 



THIRTIETH EVENING. 

7^ D W A R D. Every time now that papa fits' down 
to continue the flory I feel a dread over me. ' . 
Mr, Bill. What are you afraid of, my dear? 
Edw. That it will be the lall evening. 
Geo, If I v.cre papa, I would make it laft fo long-' 
that it (hould n^ : tinifli at nil. 

Mr. BilL My d -ar children, all our pleafures here 
below are bounded: this mu ft alio have an end, and 
you will do well to prepare yourfelves before-hand for 
the conciufion of Robinfon's adventures. However, 
even now a ftorm is nfing, as you will fbon fee ; I can- 
not anfwer for the confequences of it j be on your 
guard. 

M 3 A week 



270 T H E N E W 

A week was now clapfed without any appearance of 
the deputies. They began to be uneafy about them. 
Friday ran twenty times a day to the top of the hillock 
or !he fea-fidc, and wearied his eyes to no purpofe in 
FooJcing out for them. One day when Robinfon was 
bufy at the dwelling place, Friday came towards him 
full Ipeed, ringing, jumping, and bawling like a mad- 
man, while he was flill as far off as he could fee his 
niafler — ** They are coming ! — they are coming !'* 

At thefe agreeable tidings Robinfon took his prof- 
peft ghfs, and haftened to the top of the hillock. With 
his naked eye he could perceive at a diftance a boat 
making fail towards his ifland ; but when he put the 
profpeifl glafs to his eye, the joy that was in his coun- 
tenance difappcared, and he faid to Friday, (liaking his 
head, *' 1 doubt whether thole are the people that we 
wifted for.'* Friday at thefe words turned pale. 

Robinfon looked at the object a fecond time, and his 
doubt was now changed into uneafinefs. At laft, be- 
ir^g convinced that they v, ere not his friends who were 
in the boat, he communicated his alarm'- to Friday, who 
was already much difqiiie:eJ, " My friend,'' fud he, 
** they are neither the Spaniards nor your father ; it is 
an En.;iini boar, with lirglift) iailors in it." Friday 
began to tremble from head to foot. " Follow me,'* 
faid Robinfon, taking the road to an emiinence from 
whence they could bctttr diicover the Northern coaft. 
Scarce had they reached it and looked out to fea, when 
they were ilruck motionlefs, and, as it were, petrihed 
with aftonifumtnt. They perceived, at the diftance of 
about a couple of leagues, a large Engltlh ih p lying at 
anchor. 

Surprife, fear, and joy, feized Robinfon's bread by 
turns : joy, at the fight of a lliip which might perhaps 
carry him to his own country ; furprile and fear, be- 
caufe he could not conceive what had brought an Eng- 
lilh fhip upon thefe coafts. It could not be a ftorm ; the 
weather had been quite calm, for fome weeks. Nor 
could the fliip's courfe have occalloned her to come that 
way. What reafon could the captain have for failing 
towards parts of the v.'orld where the Englifh have nei- 
ther 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 271 

tber fettlements nor trade ? He apprehended, therefore, 
that they might be pirates. 

Henry, What are they ? 

Mr. Bill. There are men to be found, who have been 
foill inftrucled in their earlier years as not even to knpw 
that theft is a crime. Thefe wretches make no Icruple 
of taking away other people's property, either by fraud 
or violence. If they do this on land, they are called 
thie^esy or rcbbers ; if on r<^, they are called/iVtj/o^/ri?^- 
bQotersy and the like, 

Ediv* Biit thefe were Englifhmen, 

Mr, Bill. So they appeared to be, it is true ; but it 
was pofTible that they might be outlaws and pirates, who 
having feized upon an Engliili (hip, had drefTed them- 
felves in Englifh cloathing. Befides, England has at 
all times produced as many thieves and robbers as other 
countries. During the firfl years of his folitary fojourn- 
ing in this ifland, deprived of all mantierof help and fo- 
ciety, Robinfon would have thought himfelf happy, had 
he fallen into the hands of pirates, been carried away a 
flave, and thus reftored once more to the fociety of men ; 
but now that his fituation was much more agreeable, he 
trembled at the idea of being carried away by fuch ma- 
rauders. He imparted his apprehenfions to Friday, and ' 
they retired in order to obferve, at a diftance, thofe who 
were coming in the boat, and endeavour to difcover their 
defign, 

Robinfon and Friday pofted themfelves on a rifing 
ground that was covered with trees and underwood, from 
whence, without being perceived, they could have an 
eye upon whatever pafled. They faw the boat, with 
eleven men in it, come to land at a part of the Ihore that 
was fmooth and fancfy, and about a mile from the place 
where they were. The Grangers landed j eight of them 
were armed, and the other three tied neck and heels. 
Thefe they unbound as foon as they were upon the 
beach. By the countenance and adti'ons of one of them 
in particular, they judged that he was foliciting the 
compaflion of thofe who were armed : he fell at their 
feet in the pofiure of a fuppliant.^ The other two now 
and then lifted up their hands to Heaven, as if to im- 
plore luccour and deliverance, 

M 4 Robinfon, 



%-}! ' T H E N E W 

Robinfon, n)Oclced and grieved at this figlif, Vnt"^ 
rot what to refolve on : meantime, Friday approached 
him with an air of triumph, and whifpcred,, ** Well, I 
tind, niaPter, your countrymen eat their prifoners too." 
** rfhaw !'' fdid Kohinfbn, a lityle out of humour, 
** they will do no fuch thing;" and he continued to 
obferve them with his prol'ped glafs. 

It was not without flinddcring tliat he faw fome of 
thole who were armed lift u|*>their hangers feveral times 
over the head of him who was on his kneeS" before 
them. At lalt, he obfervcd that the prifoners were left 
alone, while the others difperfcd themfelves in the 
woods. 

All three fat down with forrowful and defponding 
hearts on the fj^^^t where the reft left them. 

This fight reminded Robinfon of his own deplorable 
fituation the day he was caft afljore upon the ifland, and 
it infpired him with the refolution of rilking every thing 
for the prefervation of thefe unfortunate people, if they 
fhould prove deferving of it. Having thus determined, 
he fenc Friday home v/ith orders to bring as many guns, 
piftols, hangers, and as much ammunition, as he could 
carry. 

Harriet W h a t i 3 a m m u ii i t i o n ? 

Mr\ Fill. Fovvdcr and ball. Kobinfun thought pro- 
per to ilay upon the fpcc and obferve what palftrd. Fri- 
day having perfoimed his errand, and all the fire-arms 
being charged, they obferved w^ith fatisf.i6tion that the 
failois, being Icattered about, were lain down in the 
fiiade, here ai'd there, to fleep, during the violent iieat 
of the noon-day. Robinfon, having waited a quarter of 
an hour, advanced confidently towards the three pri- 
foners, Vv'ho were ftill fitting in the fame fpot with their 
back to him. When Robinfon, approaching them, call- 
ed outfuddenly, ** Whoare you ?" they were all three 
thunder-frruck. 

They ftarted up, and v/ere going to run away ; but 
Robinfon bade them fear nothing, for he was come to 
alfift them. ** You are, then, fenc from Heaven,'* faid 
one of them, caking off his hat refpeitfully, and fufvey- 
ing him wich the greateil aftonifhment,- '* AH affift- 
ance comes from Heaveii,'* replied Robinfon i ** but, 

noc 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 273 

not to lofe time, tell me in what conlifts your diftrefs, 
and how I can relieve you." ** I am captain of that 
fiiip," faid one of them ; then pointing to his compa- 
nions, ** this," continued he, " was my mate, and that 
gentleman a pafTeng^r. My failors mutinied and feized 
the ftip ; their incention at firfl was to Icill me, and 
thefe my two companions, for finding fault with their 
behaviour ; however, they have at length yielded to our 
entreaties, and iparedour lives ; but this boon is almoft 
as bad as death iiielf. They expole us on this defert 
iflnnd, where, being in want of every thing, we arefurc 
to perilh milerably." 

*' On two conditions," faid Rohinfon, *' I will ri(k 
my blood and my life to relieve you from this extre- 
mity." 

** Generous man ! let us but know what they are," 
faid the captain. 

•* They are thefe: While you remain upon this 
ifland, you fhall conform in every thing to my will; 
and, if I facceed in recovering for you the poflefTion of 
your fliip. you (lull give me and my companion a free 
palfage to England." ** We, the fliip, and all that it 
contains, fiiail be wholly at your dilpofal," replied 
the captjin, 

'* Very well," faid Rohinfon, " I put a mufket and 
a fv.'ord into each of your hands, on condition that you 
Oiall not ufe them until I think proper. Your alfaiiins 
are now alleep and difperied one from the other; 
come; let us try and ma^er them without fpilling any 
blood." 

They fet forward. Friday carried with him the cords 
V. hich had been taken off the three prifoners. The firil 
lailor that they came up to lay with his face to the 
ground, and ilept fo found! y that they feized him by 
the hands and ftec, and crammed a handkerchief into 
his mouth, before he was well awake. They tied his 
hands behind his back, and commanded him to remain 
on the fpot without ftirringuR in'i, ormakinij the leait 
noife, on pain of^ being put to death that moment. They 
made him turn his head towards the fea, that he might 
not obferve what was pafling amongll; his comrades. 

Ms The 



274 T H E N E VV 

The fecond met with the fame treatment ; he was 
tied hand and foot, turned, and threatened in the lame 
manner. Fortune, or, more properly (peaking. Provi- 
dence appeared on this occafion the proteftor of inno- 
cence and avenger of villainy. Six of them were nov^ 
tied, but the two laft awoke, llarted up, and took thsir 
arms. ** Wretches !" cried Kobinfon to them, " fee 
where your companions lie ; be aiTured we are fuperior 
to you in force ; lay down your arms this very inlUnt; 
the leaft delay may coft you your lives !" 

They threw down their arms, and, in their turn, fell 
upon their knees to entreat iheir captain's pardon. 
Their hands being tied in tlie fame manner as thofe of 
the refl:, they were all condu(5led to the cavern which 
had been lately difcovered, there to be confined. They 
were then informed that the guard who was to have the 
care of them would fhoot the firll man through the head 
who Ihould attempt to come out at the door. It was alio 
thought expedient to take their knives away. 

After this, Robinfon and Friday, with their new 
friends, went down to the boat : they drew it up on 
the beach, and bored holes in its bottom to render it for 
the prefent unfit for ufe. 

Hftiry. Why did they do fo ? 

Mr» Bill. They forelaw, that when the firft boat did 
not return, the people aboard would fend a fecond. 
They chole, therefore, to put it out of their power to 
take back the firft« 

What they expe6^ed happened accordingly. About 
three o'clock in the afternoon, the Ihip fired a gun for 
the failors who were on (hore to return. This fignal 
not being obeyed, tiiough thrice repeated, they faw 
another boat put off from the (hip towards the ifland, 
Robinfon, with his companions, retired to a rifing 
ground, in order from thence to obferve what rceafures 
circumrtances might require them to purfue. 

The boat having come to land, the men jumped out 
and ran to the firft, but were not a little furprifed to fee 
it drawn up a good way on the beach, and with holes in 
its bottom. 1 hey looked all round, and called their 
companions by their names, but nobody anfwered. 
Ihey were tea in number, ail well armed. 

Robinfon, 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 27S 

Robinfon, being informed by the captain, that, 
amongft thole whom they had made prifoners, there 
were three who from fear alone had joined in the mu- 
tiny, fent Friday and the mate, fcr them immediately. 
On their appearance, the captain, to whom Rohinlon 
had commuiiicated his defign, after reproaching them a 
little for their hchasiour, afked them, whether, if he 
Ihould pardon ihem, they would remain faithful to him 
for the future. ** To the laft moment of our lives," 
thty laid, crembling, and falling on their knees. " Be- 
fore this mutiny," continued tiie captaiuy '* I always 
took you for honed men, and am willing to believe that 
\GU were forced to take a part in it. I hope, however, 
you will make amends for the paii by being fteady and 
jliiihful in future/' I he threfe iailors, heartily repent- 
ing of their folly, (hed tears of joy on being forgiven. 
Ilie captain gave them bdck their arms, and defired 
tiicni to yield a punctual obedience to their common 
cf7ief. 

Jn the mean time,, the people of the fecond boat were 
contiimally calling out, and now and then firing their 
guns, with the cxpeitaiion that their fcattered comrades 
would hear and join them. At lad, finding all their re- 
fearthes u (clefs, and the day now drawing to aclofe, they 
bt-gan to feajT for themfelves;, chey put off, therefore, in- 
tending to lie at anchor about a hundred }ards from the 
fliore. The captain and Robinfon were apprehenfi\e left 
they Ihould go back 10 the (hip, and the crew fliould 
tike the rcfulution of ft. tting fail and going off witti 
the vellel, and not wait longer to fearch for their Gray- 
ed companions. This apprehenfion filled Robinfon and 
the reli v/ith much anxiety. 

Luckily achoughtfi:ruckhim,from which they promifed 
themfelves great luccefs. He ordered Friday and one of 
the fdilors to go behind the thickets, about a mile from. 
th^ boat, and anfvver the men whenever they called ; 
then, as foon as they perceived that the others heard 
them, they were to go farther in by degrees araongft 
the underwood, in order to draw the failurs after them 
to 33 great a diftance as polFible from Ihore > and, ha.vmg 

duag 



2:6 T H E N E W 

done this, Friday and thefdilor were to refurn as quick 
as they could by another way. 

This ftratagem lucceeded completely. No fooner 
did the failurs in the boat hear a voice anfwer them, than 
they haftened to land again, and, taking their mufkets, 
ran towards that quarter from whence they heard the 
voice. Two were left to guard the boat. 

Friday and his companion performed their part admi- 
rably. They drew the lailors after them amongft the 
thickets about three miles from the (hore, and then they 
haftened back with all fpeed to join their commanders. 
In the mean time, Robinfon had unfolded to the captaia 
his whole plan for mafteringthefe people without blood- 
Ihed. 

Night now came on, and it grew by degrees darker 
and darker*- Robinfon and his companions advanced 
filently towards the boat, till within about twenty yards 
of it, unperceived by the two failors who guarded it ; 
then they all fhewed themfelves at once, and, with 
nuich noife and clattering of their arms, threatened the 
two men with inflant death if they dared to ftir a ftep. 
They begged for quarter, upon which Robinfon's party 
went up to them, and tied their hands. This done, 
they made hafie to draw up the boat to a confideiable 
difiance from the water, led away their two prifoners, 
and concealed themfelves behind the bulhes, to wait 
for the return of the other failors. They came back drag- 
gling one after another, and all exceedingly fatigued with 
their unfuccefsful expedition. Their aftonifliment and 
vexation at not finding the boat is iinpofiible to be ex- 
prefled. As foon as there were five of them together, 
one of thofe who had been pardoned was fent to them to 
alk whetherthey chofe to lay down their arras and far- 
render that moment without murmuring i adding, that, 
in cafe of their refulal, the governor of the ifland had 
pofted a detachment of fifty men not thirty yards oft, 
whofe fire could not polTibly mils them though it was 
dark ; that the governor's people had already taken their 
boats, and made all the reii of their companions pri- 
foners i fo that there was no choice left them but either 
to Surrender or die, 

Ac 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 277 

At the fame time Robinfon and his company made a 
clattering with their arms, to confirm the failor's ac- 
count of their number. ** Can we hope for pardon f" 
faid one of them. The captain, who was unfeen, an- 
Iwered, " Thomas Smith, you know my voice ; lay 
down your arms inflantly, and you fhall all be fpared 
your lives, except Atkins." He, it feems, was the prin- 
cipal ringleader of the mutiny, 

They all immediately threw down their arms. Atkins 
begged for mercy, entreated the captain's compaffion, 
and reprefented to him that he was not more guilty than 
the reft. The captain anfwered him, that all he could do 
was to intercede for him with the governor, and he muft 
wait the effect of that interceflion. Then Friday and 
the three Tailors were fent to tie their hands; and the 
other three mutineers returning at the fame time from 
theii ramble among the thickets, they were informed of 
what had parted, and, dropping all thoughts of refin- 
ance, fubinitted to be tied with the reft. 

Upon this, Robinfon, as one of the governor's cfHcers, 
came forward to the prilbners. The captain, who ac- 
companied him, chofe out thofe whom he thought capa- 
ble of a fincere repentance : thefe were fent to be lodged 
near the entrance of the dwelling-place ; the others were 
put into the cavern. Amongft thole who had been put 
there before, there were two whom the captain thought 
to be equally dilpofed to return iairhfully to their duty, 
and thefe were ordered to be brought to him. 

To-morrow evening, my dear children, you Hull have 
the fequel of this adventure. 



T H I R T Y-F I R S T EVENING. 

][/fR> BILL. My dear children, we now draw 

near the conclufion : Robinion's lot will foon be 

decided : a few hours more and our friend will know 

whether he is lencenced co remain in his iflund without 

hopes 



27S T H E N E VV 

hopes of quitting it, or whether he (hall be able to gratify 
his moft earneft wi(h of again feeing his parents. 

This depends on the captain's lucccrs. Will he, or 
will he not, with the alliflance of the failors who have 
returned to their duty, be able to make himfelf mafter 
ofthefliip? If he can. all our friend's anxiety will be 
at an end ; if not, things will remain as they are, and 
he mull not think of leaving the illand. 

Thole whole lives had been promifed them, were 
lodged, as bctore mentioned, near the entrance of the 
dwelling-place ; they were ten in number. Robinl'on 
informed thtm, as from the governor, that, their offeree 
being mutiny, they iliould not receive a full pjrdon, but 
on the condition of alfiPiing their lawful coivima'ider to 
recover polTellion cf his fliip. They all protelled that 
they would perform this condition with the grcatell 
chearfulnels and fidelity. Robinion added, that, if they 
acquitted themfclves properly of this juft and reafonahle 
duty, they would not only exempt themfelves from all 
mariner of puniflimenr, but alio lave the lives of their 
comradts in prilon, who, if the lihip was not recovered 
that very night, were all to be hanged the next morning 
at l-reak of day. 

1 his was alio told to the prlfoners : they were then 
left together for a while, that, in this interview, the cri- 
minals threatened with fpeedy death might confirm the 
others in their fidelity, which was the only poilible 
means that could Uvt their lives. 

In the mean time, the chip's carpenter was ordered 
i iimediately to repair the boat that had been Icutcled ; 
and, as foon as this was done, they launched them both. 
It was agreed, that the captain fnould command one, and 
the mate the other, the crew being equally divided be- 
tween them. Every man was provided with arms and 
ammunition. Robinfon took the captain by the hand, 
and wilLed him good fuccefs. The two boats now 
fetfail. 

Euzv. I wonder that Robinlon did not go wich them. 
Mf. Bill. It was not for want of courage i bat pru- 
dence did not permit him to go upon this expedition. 
The {.n'oners in his abfence might elcape, and make 
ihctnitives mafters of his dwelling-place. This, being 

his 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 279 

his only retreat in cafe of clanger, and containing all his 
refources, was of too much confequence to him that he 
(hould imprudently run the ri(k of lofing it. The cap- 
tain himfelffaw the propriety of this conlideration, and 
was of opinion that Robinfon and Friday (hould flay and 
guard their little fortrefs. 

Robinfon, whofe deftiny was now going to be decid- 
ed, felt an anxiety and agitation of mind that did not 
fuffer him to refi. 

Sometimes he fat down in the cave, fometimes he 
walked about upon the terrace, and iK)metimes he went 
up the ladder of ropes to the top of the hillock, to take 
advantage of the filence of the night, and lillen whether 
any thing was 10 be heard from that quarter where the 
(hip lay. Though he had fcarce taken any nouri(h- 
ment the whole day, he could not prevail upon himfelf 
to do it now. His anxiety was continually encreafmg, 
becaufe he expected the fignal that had been agreed up- 
on between them : three guns were to be the token of 
the captain's fuccefs, and it was already midnight. He 
at length reflefted, that he was wrong to flutluate be- 
tween hope and fear, fo tremblingly ali've to both j and 
he fcafonably recollected a maxim with which he had, 
not long ago, endeavoured to fortify his man Friday, 
** In a doubtful cafe," faid he, ** always expect the 
worfr. If this worft does not happen, fo much the bet- 
ter for you ; if it does, you are prepared for it, and 
have already dehroyed half its power to hurt." 

Confequently, Robinlbn conHdered as indubitable 
the ill fuccefs of the expedition. He mufttred up all 
his fortitude and refignation to Providence, to enable 
him to fupport this misfortune. He now gave up all 
hope — when, fuddenly the deep and diftant found of a 
gun was heard. As if he had been roufed out of his 

fleep, he liftens a fecond report then a third ! 

There is no longer any room for doubt : the captain has 
recovered the ihip, and will very fpeedily fet fail for 
Europe. 

Intoxicated with joy, he flies, he Aides down the lad- 
der, throws his hands round Friday's neck, who lay 
afleep upon the graify (lope of the terrace ; he prelfes 
hira to his «olum, and bedews hiia with his tears, i n- 

£bl5

able to litter a fingle word. ** What is the matter, my 
dear mafler P'* faid Friday, opening his eyes, and terri- 
fied at all this hurry and ludden overflow of affet^lion, 
** Ah ! Friday !" was all the anfwer that Robinlbn, in 
the fiilnefs ofhis joy, could return. 

** Heaven have companion on my poor mafler*s 
head!" faid Friday to hinilelf, imagining him to have 
loft his fenfes. *' You mnft go to bed, my dear ma- 
fter ;" and at the fame time he was taking him by the 
arm to lead him to the cave. Robinfon, in a tone of 
voice which exprelTed his trimfport, cried, ** Me ! me 
to bed ! Friday, at the very moment when Heaven is 
crowning the only wifli that my heart has cheriflied (o 
long ! Did you not hear the three guns ? Know you not 
that they are happily maflers of the fliip ?" 

Friday, on being informed of this fortunate event, re- 
joiced, it is true, but more on his maker's account than 
his own. The thoughts of loon quilting his native cli- 
mate for ever, damped the fatisfadtion which he would 
otherwile have enjoyed in going v/ith Robinfon and his 
father to a country from whence To many wonderful 
things had already been prefented to his viev/, and where 
he expe6\ed to fee others ftill more marvellous. 

Robinfon was never fo affected with the tranfports of 
joy before. Sometimes he v/ent up to the top of the 
hillock, threw himl'elf on his face, lifted up his eyes to- 
' '«'ards the ftarry vaults and returned God thanks for hav- 
ing at length procured him the means of departing trom 
this defert illand; prcfently he v/ould go down again, 
fliake his dear Friday by the hand, talk of nothing but 
Plymouth and Exeter, and begin to pack up the goods. 
In this agitation he palftd the night without once think- 
ing of repofe. 

At the hi ft peep of dawn his eyes were turned to- 
wards that quarter where the (hip lay at anchor. He 
waited with impatience for the moment when broad day- 
light ihould give him a full view of the inftru.ment ofhis 
deliverance. The moment comes — Heaven ! is it pcf- 
fible ? — Dreadful i(ftd !— He fees, without the fmalleft 
roou! for doubt — that the (hip is no longer th'.'re. He 
ftiri\':s. and falls down in a fwoon, 

Friday 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 281 

, Friday ran to him, but was a long time before he could 
comprehend what was the matter with his maOer. At 
length, Robinlbn, ftretching his trembling hand tov/ards 
the Tea, ** Look there !" (aid he, with a feeble and al- 
moft inarticulate voice. P'riday no fooner turned his 
head that way than he difcovered the caufe of his ma- 
rker's grief. 

I fee, my dear children, you know not which fenti- 
ment to indulge. You are divided between joy and 
compaflion. " You hope that this incident will prolong 
the ftory ; but our friend's melancholy fituation mode- 
rates and reftrains the livelinefs of your fatisfa6"tion. 
You all maintain a profound filence ; I will take advan- 
tage of it, and go on. 

Robinfon (hews us here, by his example, how care- 
ful even the bell men (hould be not to fuffer their paf- 
fions to get the better of them. If he had not at ftrll 
indulged an immoderate joy, he would not afterwards 
have fallen into an excefTive degree of forrow, which en- 
tirely darkened hisreafon; he vv'ould have been fenfibic 
that he ought to fupport the fhock with refignation, 
though it dfftroyed his dearctl hopes ; he would have 
reflefted that Providence has means to refcue us from 
dirtrefs, even when we think it impoffible. This rejec- 
tion would have contributed to refrore him to tranquil- 
lity. Once niore, my dear children, you fee how much 
remains to be am.ended even in perfons the moft for- 
ward in the path of virtue. 

While Robinfon was defponding, and Friday endea- 
vouring to comfort him, they fuddenl}' heard a noife at 
the back of the hillock as of ieverai people walking. 
They rife in a hurry, and looking on that fide from 
whence the noife came, they were agreeably furpriied 
to behold the captain coming up the hillock, accompa- 
nied by fome of his people. Robinfon fprung forward 
to take him by the hand, and happening to turn hirafelf 
that v.'ay, he perceived the ftjip at anchor in a creek on 
the Weftern fide of theilland. ^udge whether his grief was 
banillied ir. a moment. This light informed him at once 
that the captain had changed his ftation before the break 
of day, and moored the fhip in that fafe and commodi- 
ous harbour, 

Robinfon 



2%2 T H E N E W 

Robinfon was fo ovcrjo) ed that he could not quit the 
caprain, '.vho or his fide was no le!s delighted. They 
thanked a\ d congratulated each other a thoufand times. 
The captain related tiie manner of his becoming maftcr 
of the fliip without killing or wounding a fingle perfon. 
The night wa', fo dark that the mutineers never faw 
him, and fo made i:Qt the leafldifficulty in receiving thofe 
on board who accompanied him. The moft refraftory 
were going, it is true, to fland upon their defence, but 
their reliilance would have been vain ; they would im- 
n^ediately have been overpowered and laid in irons. 
When he had finifhed his rt jital, he indulged his feel- 
ings ofgraritude to his deliverer. ** It is you," faid 
be, with tears in his eyes, ** it is you, generous man ! 
who by your compalTion and prudence have faved me 
and reftored my (hip. It is now yours ; you (hall dif- 
pofe both of that and me at your plealure.'* He then 
ordered the men to lav on the table fome refrefhments 
that he had brought from the fliip, and the whole com- 
pany, with hearts full of joy, fat down to an excellent 
breakfall. 

In the mean time, Robinfon related his ftrange ad- 
ventures, w hich more than once excited the captain's 
higheft admiration. The latter entreated Robinfon to 
leli him what he (hould do for him. " Befides what I 
ftipulated yefterday," anfv/ered he, ** in return for the 
alTiftance that I attbrded you, I have three things more to 
defireofyou. In the firft plcice, I requefl vou to wait 
the return of the Spaniards and my man Friday's father ; 
2dly, to receive aboard your (hip, not only me and my 
people, but alfo all the Spaiiiards, whom you will land 
in their own country, failing to Cadiz for that purpofc : 
laftly, to pardon the principal mutineers, and to punifli 
them no otherwife than by letting them remain here on 
my illand, as I am perfuaded that it will be the bed way 
to reform them." 

The captain, having alTured him that thefe articles 
(hould be punt'tually performed. Tent for the prifoners, 
picked out the moft guilty, and told them their fentence, 
which they heard with a degree of fatisfadion, very 
well knowing that by law they were liable to be put to 
death, Robinfon, ever full of humanity, gave them in- 

ftruftiofls 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 283 

f^ru^lions concerning the manner of procuring them- 
felves fubfiftence, and promifed to leavt them what was 
his beft treafure in the ifland, namely his tools, his fur- 
niture, and his cattle. At the fame time he recommend- 
ed to them, over and over, to put their truft in Heaven, 
to agree together, and to be induftrious, alfuring them 
that the practice of thefe virtues would not a little con- 
tribute towards rendering their confinement in this ifland 
agreeable. 

He was flill fpeaking, when Friday, out of breath, 
brought the pleafing news that his father was coming 
with the Spaniards, and that they were that moment 
landing. All the company prepared to go and meet 
them. Friday flew to the fea fide, and embraced his 
father again and again, before. the reft came up. 

Robinfon faw with furprife, that, amongil thofe who 
came in the boats, there were two women. He quef- 
tioned Thurfday concerning them, who told him that 
they were natives v/hom the two Spaniards had mar- 
ried. As foon as thefe tv/o Spaniards Je^rned that Ro- 
binfon was going away, and intended to leave fome fai- 
lors behind him upon the itiar d, they requeued permil- 
fion to remain there aifo with their wives, alledging, 
that, after the accounts which they hnd fceard of this 
ifland, they could not deilre a better eftabliOiraent. 

Robinfon, charmed at their requeft, mofi readily con- 
fented to it. He was veil plcuied that two men ihould 
rem^iin upon his ifland, of whom all their comrades gave 
the moft excellent chaiacler, as it was poffible that they 
might bring back the mutineers, with whom they were 
left, CO a regular and peaceable life. With this view he 
refolved to give the Spaniards a degree of authority 
over them. 

Thole who were to be left on the ifland were fix Eng« 
iifl-imen, and two Spaniards with their wives. Robin- 
fon called the whole together, and declared his will to 
them in the following words : 

** 1 hope none of you will difpute my right to do as 
I pleale with the property of this 'fland and all that be- 
longs to it. I wilh equal happinefs to all of you who 
remain hereafter me. To lecure it, there muft: be a 
certain order and fubordination amongft you, which it 

belong! 



2^4 T H E N E W 

belongs only fo me to prcfcribe. I declare, therefore, 
that I appoint the t^vo Spaniards as fubftitutcs in my 
place, and that they fliall for the future he the lawful 
inaHLrs of the ifland. You fljall all pay them the flrift- 
ell obedience; they alone fliall have poffeflion of the 
little fort and live there; they alone fliall have under 
t'lelr care all the arms, ammunition, and tools, but 
which they will lend you, whenever you have occafion 
for them, provided you be quiet and peaceable. In 
all dangers you fljall unite for the common defence. 
Your labours both in the- garden and the field fhall be 
performed in common, and every crop be equall) divid- 
ed amongll: you all. Perhaps one day or other I may 
have an opportunity of hearing from you. Perhaps* I 
may even rtfolve to come and finifli my days in this 
ifland, fuch an afteclion do I feel for it even at this mo- 
mtr-r. Then woe be to him who fliall have infringed 
my regulations ! He fliall be fliewed no compaliion, but 
let adrift in a flight boat, to take his chance upon the 
open fea, let the weather be ever fo unfavourable." 

They all agreed to thefe regulations, and promifed 
the moil perfect obedience. 

Robinfon then took an inventory of the few goods 
that he intended to carry away vAth him, and which 
were to be immediately put on board the fliip. They 
were, ift, the drefs of Ikins that he had made for him- 
f(:lf, together with the umbrella and the malk : 2dly, 
fhe rpear, t!ie bow and arrows, and the ftone hatchet, 
which v/ere alio his own workmaiifl^ip : 3dly, Poll, the 
fpaniel, and two lamas : 4thly, feveral utenfils and 
pieces of furniture, which he had made while he was 
alone : 5thly, the gold-dufl and diamonds : and laflly, 
the lump of gold which was his own property. 

All thefe articles being carried aboard, and the wind 
favourable, their departure was fixed for the next day. 
Robinfon and Friday prepared a dinner, by way of en- 
tertainment before their departure, for the captain and 
thofe who were to compofe the future colony on the 
iflind. They ferved up the beft of every thing that 
was amongfi: thdr provifions, and the vicluals were fo 
well prepared, that th^ captain could not fufticiently alfj?- 
mire Robinfon's Ikili in entertaining his company. ' The 

captain^ 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 285 

captain, to imitate the generofity of his hofl:, and to con- 
tribute in feme meafure to the welfare of the new inha- 
bitants of the iiland, ordered a quantity of provifions to 
be brought from the fliip, together with gunpowder, 
iron, and working tools ; all which he beftowed as a 
prefent on the colony. 

Towards evening, Robinfon made his excufes, slv^ 
begged permilhon to be alone for an hour, dlieJcjng that 
there remained fome important bufinefs which he wifhed 
to fettle before his departure. Every one withdrawing, 
he went to ihe top of the hillock ; there he revolved in 
his mind the feries of events that had happened during 
his abode upon the ifland, and his heart, full of the live- 
lieft filial gratitude, opened itf If in thankfgiving to his 
Supreme Benefadlor. How fhall I exprefs his pious ac- 
knowledgments ? But hearts like his will rind in their 
own feelings the expreffion of thofe fentiments which I 
want words to interpret. 

The time of their departure be^'ng arrived, Robinfon 
affeclionately exhorted the colony to be unanimous, in- 
dudrious, and, above all, religious ; and, bearing in his 
bread a regard for the welfare of the whole, he recom- 
mends them as his brothers to that divine prote(Slion 
which he had alv/ays wonderfully experienced. He 
looks round once more with inward fatisfd'Stion : acrain 
he thanks Heaven both for delivering him at prefent by 
a miracle ofgoodnefs and vvifdom : for the lall time, he 
bids farewell to the inhabitants whom he leaves in the 
ifland, but in a voice fcarcely to be heard. At length 
he goes aboard, accompanied by Thurfday and Fri- 
day. 

Sc/;2e of the Children^ Now the flory is ended. 

Rich, Pray, have patience ; who knows whether 
fome oblUcle may not yet happen to hinder his depar- 
ture ? * 

Mr, Bill. The wi id was freOj, and blew (o favoura- 
bly that the iflind feeined to withdraw from them very 
fall. As long as it was in fighc, Robinfon, ftandi ng 
upon the deck in mournful filence, kept his eyes fixed 
upon che fpot, which, from h;s h.;ving lived upon it for 
twelve years, and experienced and lurmounted many 
diitrelfes there, was become almoll as dear to him as his 

own 



3186 T H E N E W 

own native country. At length, having loft fight ofthe 
ifland, and the top of its higheft hill, he retired into the 
cabin with Thurfday and Friday, in order to relieve the 
oppreffion of his thoughts in the amufement of friendly 
converfation. 

They had a very fine voyage, and in twenty-four 
days caft anchor in the harbour of Cadiz, where they 
landed all their Spanifh paflengers. Robinfon went into 
the town to enquire for the merchant to whom the bar- 
rel of gold-duft belonged which he had faved from the 
wreck. He was fortunate enough to find him, and to 
learn that the honeft merchant, by recovering this gold, 
would be extricated from the greateft difficulties. The 
lofs of his ihip had been followed by the moft difagree- 
able confequences : it had thrown his affairs into fuch 
confufion that ht failed. 

Henry, Failed ? how ? 

Mr. Bill, When a man owes more than he can pay, 
fee gives up whatever property he has remaining to be 
divided proportionably amongft his creditors, who thus 
lofe each of them more or lefs ;and in this cafe, a man 
is faid to become a bankrupt, or to fail. 

The barrel of gold-duft was more than fufficient to 
pay off the merchant's debts. Penetrated with grati- 
tude, he wiflied to beftow the remainder upon his bene* 
fa6lor. Robinfon, far from accepting it, declared that 
he was aheady too well rewarded in the fatisfadtion of 
having prevented tke ruin of an honeft merchant. 

From Cadiz they fet fail for England. In this part 
ofthe voyage a melancholy event happened- Thurfday 
fell fuddenly ill ; all the affiftance that could be given 
him was of no fervice. You may imagine what Friday 
fuffered, and what was his excels of grief on the death 
of a father whom he loved beyond expreftion. The two 
lamas, alfo, being no longer able to endure the voyage 
and the fea air, died foon after. 

Thefliip arrived without any accident at Portfmoutb% 
Robinfon hoped to find there the widow to whom he 
was toreftort; the diamonds. He found her, indeed, ac- 
cording to the direction that he had received for her, but 
in very low ciicumftances. Having received neither 
remittances nor even tidings from India for two years, 

Ihe 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 2S7 

ihe and her children were reduced to very great diftrefs ; 
in (hort, they were almoft in rags, and poverty was 
painted in the countenance of each perfon of the family. 
Robinfon, therefore, once more experienced the fatisfac- 
tion,fo delightful to every man of benevolence, of be- 
ing an inftrument in the hands of Providence to dry up 
the tears of the unfortunate, and put an end to their 
diftrefles. He gave her the diamonds ; and as a plant 
that is almoft, parched in ftalk and branches recovers its 
ftrength and verdure after a kindly and refrefhing (hower, 
he faw this family, through returning plenty, and the 
fatisfadlion naturally accompanying it, lift up their 
heads once more, make a proper figure in fociety, and 
enjoy a happinefsarifing from independence which they 
had long fince defpaired of attaining, 

Ab RobinfoTi found here a linalJ veffel going to Ply- 
mouth immediately, he took iea^eof his captain, not 
chufing to go by land, and haftened with Friday 
aboard the Plymouth veflel, which fet fail that fame 
evening. 

This (hort palTage was foon performed. They were 
already in fight of the Eddiftone light-houfe, when all 
of a fudden a violent ftorm arofe, which carried the 
veffel to the Weftward. All that fkilland aiStivity could 
do was put in praflice to tack and keep out to fea, but 
to no purpofe : a furious guft of wind rendered all their 
exertions ufelefs ; it forced the .fhip upon afand-bank 
with fuch violence that Ihe bulged. 

The water came pouring in fo fall that they had not a 
thought of faving her : in fa6t, the people Ijad fcarce 
time to take to their boats, which was the only retource 
they had to preferve their lives. 

They fortunately reached (hore at a pl^ce not fir 
from Plymouth. Robinfon and the Ihip's crew' immedi- 
ately {leered their courfe ih ther; he, like a poor tra- 
veller, now twke fliipwrecked, and faving out of 
all his eff"e6ts nothing but bis faithful fpanicl, who fwam 
afrer the boat, and Poll, his parrot, which flew upon

tiflierman for a trifling gratuity. As to his great wedge 
of gold, it was loft irrecoverably. 
Rich. Poor Robinfon ! 

Mr, RilL He is now exa6lly as rich as when he form- 
erly fet fail from Plymouth. Perhaps Providence per- 
mitted this lofs, to prevent any ra(h young perfon from 
being dazzled by Robinfon's example, and traverfing the 
world, like him, in the hope of returning with a trea- 
fure found by chance. As co Robinlon, the lofs gave 
him very little concern. Propofing, as he did, to live, 
all the reft: of his days, as foberly and with the fame per- 
feverance in labour, as he had whilft upon his ifland, he 
found a lump of gold to be quite unnecefTary in the 
prolecution of fuch a plan. 

He now took the coach for his native city Exeter. He 
had already learned at Portfmouth that his mother was 
dead, that affectionate and tender mother, and he had 
bitterly lamented her lofs. Buried in melancholy on 
account of this event, he attended very little to the ac- 
cidents of the road, and pafted through the towns of 
Brent, Alhburton, and Chudleigh, without taking the 
fmalleft notice of them. At length he ftops in Exeter : 
his heart beating with joy, he fprings out of the coach, 
and il it had not been for the numbers of people in the 
ftreet, whofe prefence fomewhat abafhed him, he would 
have fallen on his face to kifs the ground of his native 
city. 

Going into the inn at which the carriage flopped, he 
chole to fend to his father, in order to prepare him by 
degrees for the unexpected return of his Ibh. The man 
who was charged with this meft'age had orders to teil the 
old gentleman, at^tirft, that a perfon defired to fpeak with 
him, who brought him agreeable news from his, ion : he 
was, after lume time, to add, that his fon was coming to 
Exeter ; and, laftly, to declare that the bearer of thefe " 
agreeable tidings was his fon himfelf. Without this 
preparation, the good old man might have been feized 
with fuch an excefs of joy as would have coft him his 
life. 

After this precaution, Robinfon, who fi:ill knew the 
(Ireet perfcttiy well, files to his father's houfe. As

foon as he arrived there, in atranfport ofinexprefllble ex- 
tacy he throws himfelf into his father's arms, who trem- 
bled all over. ** Oh, my father !"— «^ My dear fon !" 
— was all that they could fay. Throbbing and fpeech- 
lefs, they remained fome time locked in each other's 
arms ; at length, a feafonable flood of tears relieved both 
their breafts, which were almofl: fufFocated with joy, 

Friday, whom the multitude of different objedts that 
he faw, filled with furprife was ftaring about in filence. 
His eyes could never have enough. The firfl: day he 
faw nothing, I may fay : he was dazzled, confounded, 
and could fix on no objeft. 

In the mean time, the noife of Robinfon Crufoe's re- 
turn and his furprifing adventures was fpread rapidly- 
through the city of Exeter. He was the fole fubje6t of 
converlation, and every body crouded to fee him, every- 
body defired to hear him relate his adventures himfelf. 
His father's houfe was for ever full of people, and Ro- 
binfon was employed in relating his ftory from morning 
to evening ; in the courfe of which he never forgot to 
addrefs to the fathers and mothers who heard him ths 
following exhortation, *' If you love your children, I 
pray you, teach them, in their early years, to be godly, 
fober, and laborious :" and if there happened to be 
young perfons prefent, he was careful to give them this 
wholefome advice, '* My dear children, obey your pa- 
rents and your teachers j learn diligently whatever yoa 
have a capacity to learn ; fear God, and be careful — oh, 
be careful to avoid idlenefs f It is the mother of every 
vice." 

Rcbinfon's father was by profefilon a broker, and he 
wiflied to lee his fon apply to his own bufinefs, in order 
to take it up a ter his death ; but Robinfon, long accuf- 
tomed to the pkafure of manual labour, begged his per- 
miifion to learn the trade of a carpenter, and his fuher 
not oppofing his inclination, he put himfelf, together 
with Friday, apprentice to that bufinefs, in which ihey 
madefuch proficiency, that, before the end of the year, 
they could vior with as much neatneis and diipaichas

After fome time, they opened the bufinefs in partner-

<-oi;ld not have paiTcd even half a day in idlencfs or loole 
ving. Jn remembrance of ilieir former folitary way of

the fame n,anner as they ufed in their ifland, as far p/6 
that could be done. Concord between themfelves, in- 
dulgence for the faults of others, bent-ficence towards 
thofe whom they knew, and humanity to all men, were 
virtues f> habitual to them, that they could not conceive 
how any one who negled^ed the practice of them could 
be happy. They were particularly diftinguiflied by a 
pure, fincere, and a6\ive piety. Joy and love were 
Jfeen to fparkle in their eyes, whenever they pronounced 
the name of the Supreme Being ; and they were in paia 
M'h( 'icver they heard this facred name uttered in vain 
and from mere levity. Therefore, the bleHing of Hea- 
ven vif.bly crowfied all their endeavours. Being always 
aiflively employed about fomething ufeful, they, reach- 
ed a very a'dvunced age in health and peace ; and the 
remcted pofterity will refpeft the memory of two men, 
who by their example, have (hewn to the world in what 
manner we may belt work out our temporal welfare in 
this life, and our eternal happinefs in the next.
