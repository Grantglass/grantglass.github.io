COME, gather round melt-I little ones, :For many things he there had found

And hearken unto me, '1'th he could bringr ashore,
And you shall hear u. taile about Upon the raft that he had made,
A lad that Went to sch;-- And carry to his store;
About a lad that run mi'ny, Two kittens and a. fhithful dog,
0h, many years ago, With powder, guns, and shot,

And left his home and parents donr--- Three cheeses and a. chest of tools,

Young Robinson Crusoe! 'Mong other things he got.

Now when this led grew up :1 man, And now he bravely went. to work,

It. came about one day, i Made tables, chains, and stools,
That he was cast upon a. reek-- And shelves around his little home,
An island far away. On which to lay his tools.

 

And there to shield him from the storm, He set a cross up on the beach,

And keep him safe and sound, Lest time should go astray,

lie built. a. house, and thuteh"d it o'er, 'And with his knife he cut a notch,

And fenced it rmmd and round. To mark each passing day.
Fur ofl' upon a sandy bank He caught and tamed a. little kid,
llis ship lay all a wreck; That trotted at his heels;
And ott-times when the sea. was low And with his dog and cats at home,

man
Yet sometimes he grew very sad,
And then he sat him down
Upon the shore, and thought his God

Looked on him With a frown.

And he would gaze upon the sea,
Across the. billows wild;
And wring his hands and cry aloud,

And weep like any child.

He thought upon his father's words--.

His mother's prayers and tears;
[low they would grieve for h im, I-h eirson,

Away so many years!

Then he would fiill upon his knees,
And clasp his hands in prayer,
And ask his (:'rod, with many tears,

His wicked life to spare.

At times, with gun upon his baek,
He roamed the island round,
Where melons, grapes, and sugar--canes,

All growing wild he found.

A parrot, that. some years before
He artfully had caught,

Would hop upon his thumb, and shriek
The lessons it; was taught.

g

IAnd so, to keep it snug, he made
A cage to put it. in:

And he made a. big; umbrella, too,
And all his clothes of skin.

if not he was the strangest sight
That ever you might see;
In jacket, brooches, cap, and shoes,

A hairy mun looked he.

.Wit-h big umbrella. o'er his head,
His sword hung :11} his side,
His gun and axe upon his back,

He rumbled for and wide.

 

:Now on the island herds of' goats

, Were running wild and free;

:But when he tried to catch the things,
Away they all would flee.
And, so to get them in his power,

He dug pits in the ground;

And there one mom at break of day,

A goat and kids he found.

The goat he let away again,
1" or it was fierce and strong;
The little kids he tied with strings,
And took with him along.

And then from running wild again,
His little flock to keep,

A piece of ground he Fenced aroundI

Where they might. feed and sleep.

His crops of barley and of rice,
Now rich and ripe had grown;
For seeds he found upon the wreck,

He lontr awo had sown.
D D

The corn he pounded into meal,
And made it into bread;
l'he rice he baked in little cakes,

At times to eat instead.

At length he longed when days were fine,
Upon the waves to float;
:So with his tools he went to work,

And made a little boat.

He set a mast- and sail before,
I A rudder, too, behind;

And with his dog and gun on board,

Ilc sped before the wind.

One summer morning as he walked-

 

Abroad; with gun in hand,
Ille stood aghast as he beheld

A footprint in the sandl

rl'hough many years had passed away,

Since to that lonely plaee

 

He came, yet he had never caught

A sight of human fitee.

He dreamt about them in the night,

And thought of them by (la-y;

But ere his enemies hull time

A hand on him to lay,

Tie seamcewould stir,lesl thuylry chance He turned and bounded like a, me,

Should come across his'wuy.

At last one day he climbed a hill;
Where oft ho used to lie,
And took with him his telescope,

To see What he could Spy.

And looking oll' towards the shore,
A sight he did behold,
That set his very hair on end,

And made. his blood run cold.

A band of painted savages,
He saw to his. dismay,
All dancing round a fire, on which

A human body lay.

He. saw them kill a helpless man,
And one was standing by,
All in an agony of fear,

For he, too, was to die.

Away away - away.

Across a. stream he swam with speed,
Close followed by his then;
But he was saved by our good friend

rl'he man in hairy clot-hes!

A young and comely man he was,
So timid and so shy,
Willi lnwny skin and hair of jet,

And mild and beaming eye.

And oil. he paused and looked around

 

And knelt as if in fear;

lBut (lru'soe made. him signs to come,

g'l'hen Crusoe named him Friday therei

; And ever called him so,

lBret-alum) upon that very day

He sawed him from the foe.
And Friday quickly learned to work, Then Crusoe bade him bring the guns,
For ready hand had he; And prime without delay;

And helped, in time, to build a boat And soon they beat the savages,
And launch it in the sea. - And drove them all away.

[lis master taught him many things, Tn one canoe upon the sands,
0f Grod he told him, 1300, Half dead and strongly bound,
Who made the sun and moon and stars, All read)r for to kill and eat,

 

And watches all we do. A poor old man they found.
A tone-hing sight it was to see, 'When Friday saw his Face, he paused,
Poor Friday kneel to pray---- 5 Another look to lake, LWOpt,
To hear him cry to God for help, ,Then laughed and oried,und sobbed and
In his poor broken way. As if his heart would break.

 

Where'er he was, in house or field, He clasped the old mun round the neck,

.
I
i And kissed him o'er and o'er;
l

He ever was the same;
Obeyed his master with a smile, =And leapt and danced Wit-ll very joy,
And feared his Maker's name. J To see that face once more.

One morning Friday (rune in haste, :He gave him food,hc brought him drink,
1n trembling; and in awe, i He out his bonds in twain;
And told his lmlsterthree canoes ,The dear old father that he loved,

Upon the beach he saw. | N or thought. to see again.
0R USOE.

Poor Friday, though his skin was black, Once more on board an English shlp,

His heart was warm and kind--
Hy little ones, a lesson this,

For all to bear in mind.

N ow eight and twenty weary years,
Had Crusoe been ashore,
Upon his island, night and day,

Nor thought to leave it, more.

Then oh; what joy was his; to see
One mom a spreading sail
Come dancing o'er the waters blue,

Before the swelling gale.

He watched with Friday from a hill,

Though distant) many a mile,
Until he saw a boat put ofl'

And row towards the isle.

And new at last, his trials o'er,
With grateful heart he trod

i And bowed in thanks to God.

His faithful Friday went with him;
His Friday, true and kind;

Who loved him more than all on earth,

He eould not. leave behind.

iHis big umbrella1 too, he took,
I Hie hairy cap as well;
And parrot with its. noisy tongue,

Of other days to tell.

And then With heavy hen-rt. he turned.
To bid his home adieu;
And soon} as onwurd sped the ship,

It faded from his; View.

And when old England's short' he saw,
Oh, he shed many tears;

For he had been away in all

 

Full five and thirty years.
