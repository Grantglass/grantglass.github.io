REMARKS.
Ifcohuuson Crusoe.
As it is with our friends, so it is with our bookt—the
companions of early life we greet with fond remembrance,
when, after long parting, chance or design brings us once
more together. For how many pleasing hours are we
indebted to Robinson Crusoe—not only in our boyish
days, but when experience had matured our judgment,
and the realities of life left us but a short interval for
the charms of fiction? There is no stage of existence,
from the first dawn of reason to its last glimmeriug,
that this romantic yet simple narrative cannot instruct
and delight. What an example of patience and forti-
tude, of firm reliance on the goodness of Providence,
and gratitude for past deliverances,does it present! We
remember no work more calculated to lead the imagina-
tion captive, to inspire cheerful resignation and devout
hope, and "justify the ways of God to man/1 than
Robinson Crusoe. From its first appearance to the
present moment, its popularity has hardly been exceeded
by any other book in the language—it has received the
approbation of the most profound critics, and what is
better, the universal assent of mankind.—" Yet," (said
Doctor Johnson to Piozzi) " was there ever any thing
written by mere man, that was wished longer by its
readers, except Don Quixotte, Robinson Crusoe, and
Pilgrim's Progress?'
It has been said that De Foe had surreptitiously ap-
propriated the papers of Alexander Selkirk, a Scotch
mariner, who having lived solitarily on the Isle of Juan
Fernandez four years and four months, was relieved on
the 2nd of February, 1708 9, by Captain Woodes Rogers,
in his cruising voyage round the world.—The whole story
of Selkirk is told in the captain's voyage, which he
published in 1712: whence it appears, that Selkirk had
preserved no pen, ink, or paper, and had lost his lan-
guage - so that he had no journal or papers, which he
A3
could communicate, or by others could be stolen. There
is an account of Selkirk in The Englishman, No. 26. It
is also related in Captain Cook's voyage into the South
Sea, which was published in 1712. And Selkirk's tale
was told in the Memoirs of Literature, vol. 6, page 118.
So that the world was fully possessed of Selkirk's story
in 1712, seven years prior to the publication of Crusoe's
adventures. >Ior were his adventures singular; for
Ringrose mentions, in his account of Captain Sharp's
voyage, a person who had escaped singly from a ship
that had been wrecked on Juan Fernandez, and who
lived alone five years before he was relieved: and Dam-
pier mentions a Mosquito Indian, who having been ac-
cidentally left on this island, subsisted three years soli-
tarily, till that voyager carried him off. From which of
these De Foe borrowed his great incident, it is not
easy to discover. In the preface to The Serious Re-
flections, he indeed says, "that there is a man alive and
well known, the actions of whose life are the just sub*
ject of these volumes, and to whom most part of the
story directly alludes." This turns the scale in favour
of Selkirk. Nor was the name of Crusoe wholly ficti-
tious; for, among De Foe's contemporaries, John Dun-
ton, in his Life and Errors, speaks of Timothy Crusoe,
"who was called the golden preacher, and was so great
a textuary, that he could pray two hours together in
scripture language; but he was not arrived at perfec-
tion; as appeared by his sloth in tying the conjugal
knot: yet his repentance was sincere and public, and I
fear not but he is now a glorified saint in heaven."
No dishonour can therefore attach to De Foe by a clan-
destine appropriation of Selkirk's materials, which had
been long before the world, and at the mercy of every
writer who might choose to turn them to his own ad-
vantage. Mr. Chalmers justly remarks that the adven-
tures of Selkirk had been thrown into the air, in 1712,
for literary hawks to devour; and De Foe may have
catched a common prey, which he converted to the uses
of bis intellect, and distributed for the purposes of his
interest Thus he may have fairly acquired the funda-
mental incidents of Crusoe's life; but he did not borrow
the various events, the useful moralities, or the en-
gaging style. The first part of Robinson Crusoe was
published in April, 1719, and in tne August following
he produced the second volume of Surprising Adventures,
fcfeMAIUtS. 7
With similar success. In August, 1720, appeared
Serious Reflections during the Life of Robinson Crusoe,
with his vision of the Angelic World; and in the same
year, The Life and Piracies of Captain Singleton, It is
hardly dispraise to say that the two last works were
less popular than their predecessors. A New Voyage
round the World, by a Course never sailed before, appeared
in 1725.—It is an interesting, and delightfully written
narrative; but it cheats us not into the belief of its
reality, like Robinson Crusoe.
Daniel De Foe was one of the most voluminous
authors of his time. He appears in the various charac-
ters of poet, novelist, polemic, commercial writer, and
historian. As a poet he occupies (by comparison) a
subordinate station—he is forcible and argumentative;
but his numbers want sweetness, precision, and polish.
As a polemic, he was a bold and intrepid champion of
freedom—not the freedom of the present day,—licentious*
ness and infidelity—but just and upright laws; and re*
ligion, free from superstition and intolerance* In his
other characters, he stands eminently distinguished, and
deserves the lasting admiration and gratitude of posterity.
He began his literary career with politics, and closed it
with a performance that cannot be too highly praised,
his treatise on The Use and Abuse of the Marriage Bed,
We regret that Pope should have installed him in the
Dunciad, and associated him with a blockhead who was
his adversary, and every way contemptible :—
"Earless, on high stood unabashed De Foe,
And Tuchin, flagrant from the scourge, below."
A cruel allusion to an unjust and vindictive sentence.—
We would have stood in the pillory to have been author
of the Hymn, The greatest blot in Pope's incomparable
poem, is the introduction of this honest, well-intentioned,
laborious, persecuted, and happy genius.
Daniel De Foe was born in London, about the year
1663, educated at a dissenting academy at Newington
Green, and died (shame to the ungrateful age in which
he lived !) in penury, in April, 1731, within the parish
of St. Giles, Cripplegate, leaving a widow and six
children*
We have repeatedly recommended playwrights to
select well-known popular stories; because not only is
the plot already laid down, the characters drawn, and

the dialogue, in a great part, supplied—a material sating
to wits who have to cudgel their brains (without always
making a hit) for the public entertainment; but that the
name of old acquaintance bears a peculiar charm—it is
sure to attract the young, who may be curious to see a
living representative of their school companions j while
those of mature age will be glad to lose the care and
turmoil of the busy world, in the deep solitudes of Juan
Fernandez; and recall the time when their hearts
trembled at the print on the shore; when the voice of
the parrot was as music in the wilderness; when they
shared the dangers of the lonely mariner, and joined in
praises for his deliverance. Mr. Pocock has done
wisely in launching Robinson Crusoe on the dramatic
ocean; where, after his many perils by sea and land, he
is likely to make a prosperous voyage, and return home
rich in golden opinions, and other articles of the self-
same metal. Mr. Farley played Robinson Crusoe—his
goat-skin jacket and beard were truly dramatic. Joe
Grimaldi may challenge the best actor, any day in the
week, for a better representative of Friday. To com-
plete the cast, Emery, Tokely, and Blanchard, acted
Bluff, Windlass, and Nipcheese.
Robinson Crusoe was produced for the first time at
Covent Garden, on Easter Monday, 1817.

ACT I.
SCENE I. That part of the Island which Robinson
Crusoe calls his Farm—a steep hill at the backnn.t in
the side of which is the mouth of the cave, defended in
front by an inclosure of stakes, whicht having taken
root, forms an impenetrable hedge, r. u. e.—a gentle cfe-
clivity intersected with trees, at the roots of which lits
the trunk of a cedar, partly formed into a canoe, but al-
most concealed by plants peculiar to the soit, l. u. e.—
the horizon exhibits the open Sea, and part of the shore
—near the front a hollow tree—the curtain rises to Music,
A vessel discovered crossing in the distance, r. u. e.—
Friday appears on the palisade, looks out for his master,
and, putting over a ladder, descends with a basket, from
which he produces a cake, a bunch of raisins, and a small
bottle of rum, intended for Crusoe—he throws aside the
bushes, l. u. E.f and places the provisions on the bow o,
the canoe—a dog barks, h. s. E.
Fri. Ah! he coma I dere Massa Crusoe.
[Music.—The dog runs on, bearing a bird, L. s. E.—Friday
takes it, throws it over the inclosure, r. u. e., and the
dog bounds up the ladder.
Enter Crusoe, l. s. e,, dressed and armed as described in
his history, with an umbrella, on the top of which is
perched the parrot—Friday welcomes Crusoe with ex-
travagant joy, and takes the umbrella,
Cru. Faithful, affectionate Friday I
Par. Friday! Friday!
Cru. Ha, ha, ha! go home, Poll.
IThi Parrot flies into the inclosure, R. u. E.—Friday takes
off the umbrella and returns.
Cru, Friday, Friday! take my gun. [Music—Friday
alarmed, yet fears to disoblige his master*] Courage, cou-
rage! the thunder, as you call it, hurts only the wicked:
why should you be terrified ?—Would you not use it to
defend your master 1—Remember, it was with this gun
I saved your life, when the ferocious cannibals had
doomed you to the stake, the victim of a horrid sacrifice.
[Music,—Friday intimates his gratitude, and, taking the
gun resolutely, carries it with the other articles up the lad'
derand into the inclosure,*. v. e.] What a treasure did
heaven bestow, when it made me its humble instrument
in saving that poor Indian from destruction !—For years
no human form had blessed my sight—no voice, except
the sad and fearful echo of my own, had struck upon my
almost palsied ear. Now, a fellow being, an intellectual
associate, cheers my solitude, and I am content! happy!
Happy, did I say—no, no, my wife! my son! whom
now, if yet he lives, must have reached man's estate.
Grant, oh, grant, he may never know his father's misery.
[Calling.] Friday I [Music,
Fri, [From the palisade,"] Massa!
Cru, [Calls again.] Friday 1 [Music,—Crusoe puts aside
the branches which conceal the canoe, L, u. E„ and prepares
himself for labour—three small canoes pass in the distance
from r. to l.] For two years past a portion of each day
has been allotted to complete this almost hopeless labour;
but for the assistance of that faithful creature, I had
abandoned the attempt. [He perceives the bottle, %c]
Ah, this is well—accustomed to my wants, he anticipates
them all. [Music*—The dog leaps the palisade^ R. u.e., with
a basket, from which Crusoe takes a hatchet,] Even my
poor dog does not neglect his duty: shall I alone des-
pair 1—No, visions of home and liberty revive and
strengthen in my heart.
[Music,—The dog obeys the signal of Crusoe, and dis*
appears as he begins to work—Friday appears on the
hill, r, v, e., and starts at observing some unexpected
object,
Fri, Massa! massa5
Cru, Whatuow?
Fri, Canoes! canoe*I
Cru. Canoes!

arrived close to his master,} Why do you tremble ? [Music,
—Friday describes the arrival of Indians, by imitating
their march; then their purpose, by crossing his hands, as
if bound at the wrists like a prisoner; lastly, their inten*
(ion, by theactUn of despatching the victim and devouring
Aim.] Savages! [Music,'] a prisoner! a sacrifice! [Fri-
day assents to each exclamation,] Horrible!—May not
your terrors have deceived you ?—[Music,—Friday in-
slantly draws Crusoe aside, and points to the shore] Ha!
'tis even so—they approach land!—Quick, remove every
object that may betray us—[The dog barks, R. u. E.] and,
above all, secure the dog. [Music, piano,] Fear, nothing
—conceal yourself in the canoe, and stir not—speak not,
on your life. [Friday jumps through the bushes, and looks
out, first at his master, then towards the approaching In-
dians—Crusoe prepares his gun, §c9 and ascends the lad.
der,] From the heights I shall command them—they
land!
[He signs to Friday to keep his head away, who instantly
draws back—Crusoe draws the ladder up, and is seen
on the second ladder immediately—this he draws up
also after him, then lies flat.
Music, forte.—Enter Pauiboo, the Cannibal Chief, l.s.e.
—he examines the spot, and beckons forward his troop,
who, having made a circuit of the stage, place their pri-
soner Iglou against a stake, c, and at this instant Fri-
day exclaims, from the palisade, r. u.e., "Father!"
—the Savages pause in alarm—Pariboo brandishes his
club, and the rest immediately regain confidence—Iglou
runs forward, and implores his life—he is again seized,
and, as Pariboo advances to despatch him, Friday throws
forward the flask of rum, c.—the group look round with
surprise, (ill the Chief, impatient at the interruption,
rushes with savage impetuosity to the sacrifice—Crusoe
at this instant fires from r. v, u.—the Indians rush off,
yelling with apprehension, i.—Pariboo, more resolute,
appears to mark the spot from whence the fire proceeded
—Crusoe again fires, and the Chief bounds off, l.—-
Friday springs from his concealment, and raises his
Father, who trembles with his face to the earth in the
utmost terror—Crusoe arrives in front.
Fr'u [Kneeling over Iglou,] Oh, massa, massa! thun-
der kill him.
Cru. (r.) Not so—Ifiredbeyona them, aopae|£ Jui?-
[Lively Music,—Friday jumps up, rejoiced, runs for the
bottlet supports Iglou, and puts it to his mouth.] What
means this unusual agitation ?—He must have seen this
man before. Do you remember him, Friday?
Fri. Oh, iuassa, him Iglou, Friday father.
Cru. His father! Providence, I thank thee 1 [Kneels.]
Even in this solitude, I do not live in vain—I have re-
stored a parent to his offspring. [Rises.] He'll soon re-
cover—lead him to the cave, whilst I observe these mon-
sters in their flight, and see that none remain.
[Music*—Iglou recovers—starts at the appearance of
Crusoe—Friday explains to him the obligation they
are under to his master—Iglou falls at the feet t>f
Crusoe—Friday, on the opposite side, embraces his
knecc—Crusoe raises them, and exit, L., pointing his
gun—as Friday and Iglou are ascending the ladder,
tableau—scene closes,
SCENE II.—The Entrance of a Wood near the Shore.
Enter Swivel and Nipcheese, u
iSivi, Come, master steward, let out a reef and freshen
your way: you lag astern as if you were afraid of being
boarded.
Nip. (l.) So I am afraid, and no wonder, considering
the cursed scrape I have got into. Plague on the mu-
tiny, I say, instead of saving an honest penny, I may be
hanged like a dog, and lose all. Did you say the mate
had turned the boatswain ashore?
Swi. (r.) I did; he would not join us, so we set him
adrift without rudder or compass. He straggled off to
seek a berth here in the woods; but what argufies that?
you are not afraid of a man without arms, are you?
Nip, No! but he has two devilish long arms, to my
certain knowledge, and a couple of thumping fists at the
end of them, too. I shouldn't like him to settle accounts
with me just now.
Stci. Well, don't stand palavering here—'twas this
way we heard the gun. [Pointing, r.
Nip Was it 1 Then I think we had better go the other.
[Moving off, l.
Swi. What, sheer oft'!
Nip. Oh, I'm not ashamed to confess my failings; I
always have more satisfaction in escaping danger than
meeting it
Swi. Ay, ay, Master Nipcheese, we know you'd rather
grub in the bread-room than go aloft.
Nip. I am glad of it: the worse you know of me, the
less chance you'll have of being disappointed. Courage
is all very proper in a gunner, but what have I to do
with it, that am only shipsteward and supercargo 1
Swi. Why, you chicken-hearted ungrateful cur, won't
you save all your slops and bread-bags by it 7
Nip. That's very true; I shouldn't like to lose my
little property.
Swi, Then brace up your heart, and be a man.
Nip* Well, I will, I will j give me your hand.—
Zooks I I've p;ot some mettle in me, though I don't brag
of it. [The Savages yell without, l.] What the devil's
that?
Swi. Eh! we shall have a squall presently.
[The Savages shout, i,
Nip, A squall with a vengeance! Zounds! they are
savages!
Swi, And bearing down upon us I
Nip. Lord save us and bless us!
[Exeunt, running into the wood, L. s. e.
Enter Savages, l.—they rush across in confusion, from l. to
r.—Pariboo, following, turns to see if he is pursued—
Nipcheese comes forth to see if there are any others, and
suddenly facing Pariboo, is petrified with alarm—Swi-
vel appears, makes a blow at the Chief, who avoids it
with agility, and rushes out, R.—Nipcheese applies a
case-bottle to his lips,
Swi, [Looking off, r.] They are all off.
Nip. Most happy to hear it.
Swi. (r.) There was a jolly crew of them.
Nip. (l.) Yes, very jolly! I shouldn't like to have
improved my acquaintance, though, with their long-
legged first lieutenant.—Never saw such a ferocious-
looking dog in my days.
Swi. They are Caribs, I take it, that cross over from
the main, to sacrifice, and so forth,
Nip, To do what?
Sufi, Belike, you are not up to their rigs.
Nip. No—can't say I am.
Swi, Why, when they take any of their enemies in
battle, d'ye see, they just pitch upon a little quiet spot,
like this, and have a fea*t.
b2
f *
Nip, A feast! cannibals! are you quite sure they
won't come back, and give u» tin invitation?
Swi, Not they; they are more frightened than you
are.—See, they are making along shore, like a fleet of
colliers. [They turn and look out, R.
Music—Enter Robinson Crusoe, l., as if tracing the
retreat of the Indians—he starts at observing strangers.
Nip, They embark! they get aboard their canoes.
Wind and tide be with 'em! Phew! bless us all, what
an awkward thing it would have been, to have made
one at their mess! [Drinks,
Cru, Europeans! Englishmen! Let me be cautious.
[Retires, l. s. e., and watches,
Nip* But where's the boatswain?—where's Windlass
all this time, with our prisoners 1
Cru, [Apart.] Prisoners! what can they mean?
Swi. He'll soon heave in sight; perhaps the woman
ha3 been troublesome.
Nip, I never knew a woman that wasn't, my wife in
particular; but is she to be left ashore, too?
Swi. To be sure; we must have no tell-tales when
we run the vessel into a strange port.
Cru, They are mutineers, pirates!
Swi. Besides, what should Ave get by parting Diego
from his mother?
Cru. Diego! his mother! Merciful powers! can it
be possible?
Swi, 'Twas the only way of getting rid of our diffi-
culties,
Nip, Humph! and a pretty sure one of putting an
end to theirs. However, she'll care less for the loss of
her property, than her disappointment in not finding this
man—this what-d'ye-call him, that was lost so many
years ago.
Swi. Robinson
Nip. Ay, the same—Robinson Crusoe.—Egad! there's
not one wife in a thousand, that would run half the
world over, as she has done, in search of an old hua-
banrU [Scuffle without, l.
Windlass. [Without.] Bring him along, I say!
Swi, They make resistance—see. [Whistle heard, 1.]
Bear a hand—that's the boatswain's whistle.
[Exit Swivel, u
JcENEII.j HofilSiON CRUSOE. 17
Nip, T know it—I wish 'twas his last whistle, with
all my soul! That fellow frightens me more than Mrs.
Nipcheese. Oh, that I was safe under her command
again 1 any torment would he better than such a life of
jeopardy.
Win. [Without, L.] Does the rascal skulk I Jump
upon deck, here. [Another whistle, l.
Nip. I'm coming! hull-dog! Oh!
[Exit Nipcheese, L.—Music.
Cru. Does my sight mock me! these tears, perhaps—
no! 'tis real—my faithful heart at once acknowledges a
kindred soul! It is—it is my wife! what's to be done?
To attack them singly would be madness! I'll regain my
habitation by the short path through the wood—watch
in secret the departure of these ruffians, then spriug
into her arms, and seek no home beyond them.
[Exit to the wood, R.—Music.
Diego. [Without, L.] Traitor, unhand me!
Win. [Without.] No words—bear them along!
Music.—Enter Ikes and Diego in chains, forced on with
violence by a party of the Mutineers, l., Swivel and
Nipcheese following—Windlass, the boatswain, acting
'as commander.
Die. (r.) Infamous, abandoned wretches! will not
one victim serve? Lost as you are to every sense of
honour and of duty, do not add cruelty to insult, do
not forget that you are men!
Win. (c.) 'Tis too late to parley, captain: we have
taken our course and must stick to it,—if it's a bad one,
that's our look-out You shan't be left destitute, but we
are too far on our way now, to ware ship.
Die. 'Tis not for myself I ask.—I know too well, your
guilty project makes compassion for the man you thus
have injured, hopeless.—Behold that female, defenceless
and forlorn! if you are not dead to every feeling of
humanity—if the prayers of the unfortunate can reach
your hearts, ere it be too late, show mercy to a woman,
and spare, oh, spare and save my mother!
[Music.—Ines expresses, by appropriate action, her de»
termination not to be separated from her son.
Ines. Plead not for me, my son: if death is thy portion,
thy mother will meet it with thee.
Win. No more piping, we've had enough for one spell.
Where's the steward 1 [Crossest r,
• 8
Nip* [Advancing, R.] Here.
Win. Lead them up the hill, and take off their irons.
Nip. Me!
Win. Yes, it's all you are fit for. We'll bring along
the stores. Swivel, you bear him company, and mind
the milk-sop doesn't let 'em slip.
Nip. What! do you doubt my firmness in the cause 2
Win. No growling—out with your cheese-toaster, if
you are not afraid of the sight on't.
Nip. [Drawing his cutlass.'] Afraid!—there, stony-
hearted rascal! [Aside.] How I should like to run him
through the paunch.
Win. Now then, off with you, while I collect the
stragglers. [Retires tip, c.
Nip. I must put a good face on it [ With assumed
consequence.] Come, we can't wait here all day.
Die. Must I submit without a struggle? Wretch I
these chains, that bind my hands, have not subdued my
spirit.
Nip. [Alarmed, R.] Come, come, captain, no swag-
gering; it won't do with me. Don't you see Fm resolute?
lues. [To Diego.] Be calm, my son
Die. Let me not fall without a blow—I have strength
to make these fetters instruments of vengeance, and
thus
[Music.—He catches up his chains to make a blow at
Nipcheese, who starts back—Windlass and the rest
spring for ward, and arrest the arm of Diego.
Ines. [Interposing.] Not so, not so—till heaven itself
deserts ns, why should we despair?
Die. Well, I submit; but think not, guilty and ob-
durate men, such crimes will pass unpunished. The
prayers of the unfortunate will be heard even in a
desert.
Win. Away with them. [Music.—Exeunt Diego, Ines,
Swivel, and Nipcheese, R.] Now, my lads, as I am Cap-
tain, it behoves me to make a bit of an oration, just that
we may understand each other.—I'm told there are some
aboard, that would rather stick to their old commander,
than sail under Jack Windlass and a free flag; but the
first that mutinies shall be run up to the yard-arm with-
out mercy, by way of example like to the rest. You
that are jolly boys, shall share alike in all we have, and
all we may have! We'll sink the banian days, sleep
eight hours instead of four, work little, eat a great deal
and drink a double allowance of grog every Saturday
night.
Mut. Hurra!
Win. What, you like that, do you? I thought I
should make you show your grinders at last—heave
along the lumber!—With the next tide we'll sail, turn
our freight to cash, and then hurra for plunder and the
bold buccaniers I
GLEE and CHORUS.
When the anchor's a-peak,
And the ship under weigh,
The wide ocean we'll seek,
Like a shark for its prey.
We'll take what we can, boys
Wherever we steer;
Friend or foe, 'tis all one
To a bold buccanier.
Let the signal be heard
That a sail is in sight;
Sword and hand, we must boar
If they dare us to fight.
No danger shall daunt us,
No odds make us fear,
We must conquer or die
Like a bold buccanier.
Music continues.—The Mutineers assist each other with
the stores intended far the captives, and bear them
off, R.—as they depart, Pariboo appears, L.t ex-
pressing rage at the cowardice of his tribet who have
paddled off in their canoes, and left him alone on the
island—he suddenly marks the retreat of the Mutineers,
and follows them, with a determination to regain pos-
session of his lost victim, Iglou.
SCENE III.—Crusoe's Farm, as before.
Robinson Crusoe, Iglou, and Friday, discovered.
Cru. [To Friday.] You tell me that-in a few hours
your father may return with some people of whom he is
the chief. {Friday assents—Iglou expresses impatience at
not understanding them.] The small canoe in which 1
surveyed the island, though insufficient for my escape,
will serve {lis purpose in crossing to the main? [Friday
again assents—Iglou more impatient.] Good1, should the
wind bold, he and his friends promise to regain this
shore by daybreak.
[Music*—Friday describes to Iglou, the dawn, paddling
of a canoe, and the march of their tribe, to which Iglou
assents with vehemence, enforcing his anxious wishes,
by appropriate action, to serve Crusoe,—Friday starts
at seeing a strange object, R., and Iglou at the same
time grasps his tomahawk—Crusoe directs his atten-
tion towards the point to which Friday signs,
Fri, [ Exclaiming,] Massa, see da!
Cru, Silence! His one of those strangers whom I told
you of—unless he should perceive us, let hira pass—
they may not all be guilty.
[Music,—Iglou and Friday conceal themselves behind
the canoe, t. u. e.—Crusoe conceals himself behind a
tree, r. o. e.
Bluff. [Singing without, r.] '< Billy Tailor was a brisk
feller, full of mirth and full of glee,
And his true love he did diskiver to a lady fair and
free."
Enter Bluff, r., with a cudgel under his arm, and a to-
baccQ»hox in his hand.
Bluff, Ah, it won't do—I may sing for my allowance
long enough now, before the boatswain pipes to dinner.
My heart is sunk five fathom—many a losing voyage
have I made in *ray time, and weathered many a rough
gale; but it's d—d hard to be taken aback at last by a
set of swabs—it's all along with Jack Windlass the
boatswain—I was the man that taught him to hand, reef,
and steer—and now the dog leaves me like a wreck on
a lee shore, at the mercy of wind and weather. Well,
[Taking a quid.] it's all one—" a light heart and a thin
pair of bree" [Seeing Crusoe.] ey!
Cru. [Advancing.] Til venture.
[Friday and Iglou appear from behind the canoe.
Bluff, (l.) Who the devil!—what cheer, ho ?—Where
are you bound 1 from whence came you?
Cru. Do not shun me,—we are fellow-sufferers, and
should assist each other.
Bluff, Indeed! well, I have seen strange sights afore
now—but, smite my timbers, such a cruiser as you
Cm. I am a seaman like yourself, cast on an unknown
cpast,
Bluff. Like enough—your rigging has seen some ser-
vice: but mayhap you take me for a buccanier—no such
thing—my name's Harry Bluff, as true a heart as ever
broke biscuit. I'm a true friend to the service, and an
enemy to all mutineers; so, if you are in the piccaroon.
ing Hue, you'd best put about, d'ye see, and let me shoot
clear a-head of you.
Cru. I was not mistaken—we must be friends.
Bluff. Ay, ay! there's two words go to that bargain,
though—sheer off, or I'll be foul o'your top-lights.
[Music.—Friday and Iglou, at the appearance of conten-
tion, start forward toe.
Cru. (r.) Hold! touch him not!
Bluff. Whew! am I to be run down by a fleet of
small craft?—Hark'ee, brother, three to one are long
odds, but if you, or any squadron, offer to board me
without provocation, dam'me if I don't scuttle some of
your nobs before I strike.
[Friday and Iglou are again about to strike, but Crusoe
checks them.
Cru. Do not mistake £ though you have not seen, you
surely must have heard of Crusoe.
Bluff. What, Robin?
Cru. The same.
Bluff. Why, you don't mean to say—you, ey!
Cru. Yes, Robinson Crusoe, the father of Diego, the
husband of Ines, those unfortunate beings whom an
abandoned set of miscreants now drag in chains. [Music.
Bluff. [Running across to Crusoe^] I know! say no
more. Ods*heartt I hav'ntbeen better pleased—here,
lend us a cutlass; if your shipmates are jolly boys;
we'll be too strong for 'em yet.
Cru. That, must depend on circumstances: we must
run no risks; if they are necessary, I have arms and
ammunition in abundance.
Bluff. Why, have you, though?—Well, an1 how are
you?
Cru. Friday \
[He gives directions to fetch arms—Friday goes up the
ladder for them.
Bluff. Ecod 1 I shall sing to some tune yet—** A light
.heart and a thin pair of"—here, take a bit o' baccy.
[Crusoe declines the offer.] Well, as you like. [Iglou und
Friday bring arms over the palisade.'} Henceforth we'll
cruise in the same latitudes. Hang me if t don't stick
by you as long as I can carry a rag of canvass.
[Friday and Jglou run forward with amir.
Bluff* I say$ Robin, this loblolly-boy of yours seems a
hearty sort o* chap * give us your fist, blacky—there's
the hand of a seaman for you, you dog!
[Shakes hands with Friday, who is greatly pleased with
his new alliance, till Bluff's hearty gripe changes his
countenance—his grimace fully evinces the seaman's
strength—Iglou is angry;
Cru, Now listen to my purpose.
Bluff. Heave away 1
Cru. My first object is to insure the safety of Ines and
her son—if they attempt to injure them, we fire.
Bluff. Ay, a broadside!
Cru. If they leave their captives unmolested, we must
create no alarm, but let them depart.
Bluff. What! with ship and cargo! and leave us to
drive under bare poles, without a mess o* provision
aboard?
Cru. Their numbers must eventually overpower us.
Bluff. Well, well, you are commanding-officer; but if
I come athwart Master Windlass in a snug corner, he'd
better be in Greenland, that's all. rCrosses, L.
Cru* They come!
Bluff. All hands to quarters, then.
Cru. Close, close!
[They conceal themselves, r. and t. u. e.
Enter Ines and Diego, in deep dejection, attended by
Swivel and Nipcheese, r.
Nip. (§..) Ah, this appears to me a very pleasant re-
tired sort of a spot, where a man may reflect on the
vicissitudes of human life without much fear of interrup-
tion. What do you think, Master Gunner, ey?
Swi. (r.) Ay, ay, this will do; they'll have nobody
to overhaul 'em, here.
Nip. [Aside.] Except the savages. Well, then, take
ofT his bracelets. [Swivel takes off his chains.] 1 could
find in my heart now to do the poor creatures a kindness.
I certainly possess a great deal of compassion, bul
somehow I require so much pity for myself, that I never
have any to spare for other people.
Swu Now then, let's join our messmates.
Nip. Pho! you know they'll join us presently.
[Retires up.
Die. [To Ines.] A last effort, mother! [Ines by action
expresses the uselessness of the attempt.!—One moment.
. Nip. Ey!
Die. Hear me: on the score of humanity t perceive
you are inexorable;—not so to your interest, or your
personal safety. Think what must be your fate, should
justice overtake you.
Nip. Excuse me, I'd rather not.
Die* There are some in the ship who contemplate this
crime with detestation and abhorrence; aid them to
quell the mutiny, succeed in accomplishing our rescue,
I not only guarantee your pardon, but promise, on my
oath, to recompense your fidelity with a sum far greater
than you can ever hope to gain by persevering in an act
of guilt.
Nip. Indeed! will you? well, I
Swi. What!
Nip. Oh, no—it—it's impossible!
Swi. [Crossing to Diego.] Would you bribe us?
Nip. Ay, would you bribe us ?—1*11 get the gunne*
out of the way, and then sneak back—pardon and re-
ward! [Aside.] Must have an eye to business.
Die. Speak!
[While Diego directs his attention to Swivel, Nipcheese
steals upf and conceals himself in the hollow tree, R. s. e.
Swi. Not I; a man can't serve below and aloft at the
same time, Captain.* [Crosses, r.] I wish you no ill, for
my part, but we have hoisted the red flag, and I must
stick to it, sink or swim. [Exit, n.
Die. 'Tis done, and not a hope remains I Oh, mother!
we are lost for ever! [Sinking into the arms of Ines.
Ines. Not so; till heaven itself deserts us, why should
we despair 1
Cru. [Advancing with Bluff, l.] I can resist no longer.
Bluff*. Mind what you're at, though—drop gently along-
side, or you'll frighten her out of her seven senses.—You
may ha' been a good-looking chap once, but I'll be shot
if you're so now.
Cm. Ines.
[Music.—Ines clasps her hands in mingled surprise and
alarm—Diego starts from his abstraction
Ines. Ah! what prodigy is this? [Pause.
Cru. Has the unrelenting hand of time so tiansformed
24 KOBIN80K ctuisos* [act I.
me, that I live not in the memory of her who knew and
loved me best?
Ines. Ah! that voice
Cru. In absence still have I blessed thee, Ines 1
Ines. Crusoe!
Cru. She knows me!
Ines* Merciful heaven! 'tis he! it is my husband!
Die. My father! [Both rusk to the embrace of Crusoe,
Ines. To meet you thus
Cru. I know—I have beard it all—our present se-
curity must be effected—hereafter our escape.
Bluff. [To Diego.) Captain!
Die. [Crowing.J Bluff!
Bluff. Ay, captain, here am I, all my timbers repaired,
new rigged, and ready for another cruise, as you see.
Come, mistress, don't be down-hearted; swab the spray
from your bows, and coil up your spirits. Our enemies
have more hands, 'tis true, and superior weight o' metal;
what then? fortune is not always with the strongest, you
know.
Die* (l. c.) Worthy fellow! as bold a seaman, and
as true as ever set face to weather.
Bluff* (L0 Belay, belay, captain! I'm no such won-
der; bless you, there's many as good a man as I, and
amongst these ragamuffins, too, if they dared but show
themselves.
Cru. (r. c.) Indeed! are you sure of that?
Bluff. I know it Windlass and the gunner carry it
with a high hand, to be sure—but as to that thief, Nip-
cheese, he'd sooner steal eggs out of the hen-coops, than
run his thick skull against a brace o' bullets at any time.
But only let me get sight of him! I'll make his head
sing and simmer like a pot of chowder.
Nip. [From the tree, a. s. eJ Curse my curiosity!
JB/i#Ey!
Die. What now?
. Bluff. I thought* I heard somebody speak, didn't you 1
Die. Where? which way I
Bluff. Here, close at hand!
Cru. We must be sudden, then. Come, prepare!
[Calling.] Friday!
Mvsic—Re-enter Friday and Iclou, r. u. b,, running
forward—Ines starts.
Bluff. Nay, don't be scared! that's Robin's loblolly
boy, and Mother's his powder-monkey, I take it—both
rated on his books as able-bodied men.
Cru. Now, mark me: unless we can secure their party
without alarm, it must not be attempted. An unsuccess-
ful effort would destroy us—if you hear my signal, spring
upon them at the instant, but even then reserve your fire
till I give the word.
Die, Enough; we'll obey precisely.
Cru* Friday, may I trust you 1
Fri. [Nodding assent.] Me no afraid now, massa.
[Crosses to Crusoe*
Cru. You comprehend. [Friday assents.] Let all dis-
pose themselves to advantage.
Bluff'. I think that hollow tree would be no bad place.
[Nipcheese terrified,
Cru, *Tis too confined; Friday shall ascend it, and
give us notice of their movements. [Lies snatches a sword
from Friday.] Ines, what would you do r
[Seeing her armed with the sword,'
Ines* I hope, nothing; yet if a woman's feeble aid is
needful, doubt not my resolution.
Nip. [From the tree.] Why, they're quite an army, I
declare.
[Diego joins his mother, and expostulates—Ines is de-
termined, and Diego selects a spot where he may be
useful, and at the same time shield her from danger.
Bluff. [Taking his station, t.] This will do for me.
[Music.—Nipcheese, peeping out, sees the black, and pops
down in dismay—Friday mounts the tree—Igloucrosses
with ail the circumspection of a savage, to the foot of
the tree, and is anxiously wailing the report of Friday
—as Friday looks off, r., a whistle is heard, he claps
his hands, makes a sign to his master, and rapidly de-
scends.
Bluff. The whistle! d'ye hear?
Cm. Hush! Close, close!
[Music—They all disappear, p.. and t. u. e.
Windlass. [Without.] Swivel \ Nipcheese! Hillioh!
[Whistle, r.

ner! plague on you, where are you 1

£et jlown the grub.
[The Seamen place the chest and the bags at the foot of
the tree.
Block, Look! [Seeing, and taking tip the fetters,"]
they've been safe moored, however; but they've left
their silk stockings behind them.
Win. Slipped their cables! I don't like this—who's
with the boat?
Block. Gunwale, and the coxswain.
Win. All's well, then; Swivel's a true man—he must
have lost his reckoning in this outlandish navigation;
but, if that land-shark, Nipcheese, has played false, he
shall smart for it—Hillioh!
Block. It's no use to hail them here, we should have
brought speaking trumpets; our voices are lost among
these woods*
Win. We must make ourselves heard, or leave 'em to
make the best on't; Nipcheese would be no loss, but we
can't spare Swivel—the tide ebbs fast, too, and it looks
squally.—I have it,—fire a volley—'twill be answered
from the ship—and if that signal doesn't bring 'em to,
nothing will.
Block. Right.
Win. All ready? Present! [Without placing them-
selves immediately in rank, they are so disposed as not to
injure each other, by pointing to different directions, con-
sequently to the imminent peril of the concealed party, r.
and l,] Steady! don't level so low, 'twill deaden the re-
port.—In the air, lads? fire 1 [The Sailors allfire, R. and I.
Cru. Upon 'em!
[Music.—The instant the discharge takes place, the con-
cealed party rush forward—Windlass encounters Crusoe,
and the rest are variously engaged—Nipcheese escapes in
the confusion—Ines rescues her husband, who has been
disarmed, while Bluff, having disabled his antagonist,
rushes forward, and with his cudgel fells the Seaman,
who instantly encounters Crusoe, when he recovtrs his
sword—Friday at the same moment overpowering
Windlass—Diego and Iglou likewise subdue their an-
tagonists, and the curtain falls on the tableau.

ACT IL
SCENE I.—The Interior of Crusoe*s Cave—the entrance,
L. F.—a door near the front, L., which leads to a subtena*
neous passage, made of a flat stone, and adapted to the
cavity, so as to escape notice until it is opened—various
shelves, upon which are goods and utensils taken from
the wreck—likewise other articles, which the industry
of Crusoe has fabricated for his use and convenience—an
open chest, c.—two chairs and a rude table, n. c, covered
with skins, and a lamp hanging at the side*
Diego discovered eagerly examining the different objects—
Crusoe and Ines in conversation*
Cru* Yes, Ines, such were the reverses which befell a
man, once possessed of every luxury, erery comfort that
domestic happiness could give—'tis past, forgotten!—
this joyful meeting has repaid me all.
Ines. More, tell me more! I could listen to the tale
for ages.
Cm* I was the only being that escaped with life; and
the desire to preserve it aiding the resources of my mind,
with time and patience, I constructed this dwelling*
Ines* But your arms, your stores?
Cru* They were taken from the wreck of the vessel,
which for three months held together. During that
period, I recovered those articles, valuable beyond all
calculation J—beneath that table is a cell, where I con-
cealed my powder, and matters of equal importance.
Die. (r.) Where do you repose?
Cru* There I [Throws open the tecretdoor, l.
Ines* In that dungeon, so dark and damp?
Cru* It possessed a quality to me more serviceable
than light or warmth—safety! it has two separate out-
lets; one in the wood close without the cave, the
other among the rocks upon the beach. I trembled lest
the Caribs should in time discover my abode, and re-
solved, in case of a surprise, to make retreat certain.
Accident completed what the united efforts of Friday
and myself scarcely could accomplish. We discovered
an excavation leading to the spot where I was fint
washed on shore. But, come, we must prepare for our
c2
departure. While we have time, let us secure tbote
things that now may be of service.
[Music.—Goes into the dormitory f t.—Ines following f
stops at the entrance—retreats in alarm, and falls on
the neck of Diego.
Die. So fearless in danger,—yet so apprehensive in
safety.—Dismiss these idle terrors, they will unnerve
ray father. The villains are confined in the outer cave,
and guarded by the faithful Friday.
Cru. Now, then, we have nothing to detain us.
[Returning from the cell, l., and giving a casket to Diego,
Ines. [Recognising it.] A casket!
Cru. You well remember it, Ines—'tis the same I took
from San Salvador, when last we parted.
[Diego places the casket on the table.
Die* What have you there 1
Cru. The journal of my exile! a treasure far more
useful to my fellow creatures than that splendid dross,
—it tells them never to despair,—it teaches them to place
their trust in that power, who can befriend the wretched
outcast, when the whole world abandons him. There,
boy, take it—treasure it, as thy father's legacy.
[Gives Diego the journals, who places it on the chest.
Die* [Pointing to the cell.] By that pass we shall avoid
all chance of observation from the stragglers.—Bluff has
doubtless secured the boat, and must be waiting for us
with impatience. But Friday—your faithful Friday!
Cru, He shall not be forgotten. [Surveying the cave]
Farewell, scenes of my sorrows and my sufferings, a long,
a last farewell! [Pressing away a tear.
Bluff. [Without, L. F.] Hillioh!
Die. Hark! some one calls
Bluff. Hillioh, captain 1
Cru% Tis the seaman.
Die, [Running to the back.] Bluff! what can have
happened? Holloa! here!
Ines* If they should have discovered your retreat—
[Music.—lnis shows alarm*
Cru. Be patient, all may be well.
Bluff advances from the entrance in flat, u
Die. (r.) Now, your news?
Bluff, (r. c.) Bad enough—might ha* been worse.—
I've fallen in with the enemy's cruisers, and was obliged
to scud. [Ines expresses anxiety*
Cru. But the boat?
Die. Is it in our possession?
Bluff. No, it was sunk in action.
Ines. Sunk! destroyed!
Bluff. [To Ines.'] Nay, don't strike your colours yet:
it isn't so bad as all that comes to.
Ines. Explain!
Cru. Speak!
Bluff. It's soon said: according to orders, I made the
best of my way along shore, and got aboard the boat
snug enough, when, who should heave in sight but Gun-
wale and the coxswain.—Come, thinks I, I can manage a
couple of you, and prepared my small arms accordingly.
Die. Quick! the event!
Bluff. All on a sudden, in the wake o* them I saw
two more; what's to be done now, says I? (A man is
but a man, you know,) down I lay—howsomever, they
soon spied me, and began cracking away—being pretty
dark, I didn't value their shot a. pinch of oakum, but
knowing it was all up with us if they got possession of
the boat, with one blow I stove a plank in her bottom—
she filled—I jumped asliore—dashed through their
squadron, kept up a running fight, and here I am.
Cru. 'Twas well done!
Ines. May they not recover the boat?
Bluff. No; but we can, and repair it, too—there's
comfort for you—at low-water she'll be high and dry
again.
Cru. Did they pursue you far?
Bluff. Yes, close under the land here.
Cru. So near?
Ines. We're lost!
Die. Who were the two lastt -
Bluff. The gunner, Swivel, and that old bum-boat-
woman, Nipcheese; he was upset in the scuffle directly,
and there I left him sprawling, like a frog in a fit.
Cru. Let the Wdrst happen then, we can match them.
Bluff. Match 'em! why, bless you, Nipcheese has no
more heart in him than a rotten ratline, and as to the
coxswain, I've a strong notion my last fire carried away
some of his rigging. I saw him make an awkward sort
of a bow, like, at parting, as much as to say, thank you,
that will do, I've got quite enough.
[Music.—The dog barks^-the group in consternation*
c 3
Enter Friday, terror-struck, l. f.
Fri. [Rushing down, c] Oh, massa, massa! white
man free!
Cru. Escaped!
Bluff. What, broke from their lashings? This looks
bad;
Cru. Those who pursued you, have discovered and
released the rest.
Ines, Then all is lost!
Bluff. No such thing! [To Ines.} We may surmount
the futtock shrouds of despair yet; you shall never
founder till old Bluffs a sheer hulk.
[Friday explains the accident to Crusoe.
Cru, Separated! in search of our concealment? Then
we may still avoid them—should we be driven to ex-
tremity, remember the secret pass. [Diego throws it open,}
Collect more ammunition, Friday, quick !—You, Diego,
hasten to the shore and kindle a fire on the rock—'twill
direct the friendly Caribs to the spot where we most may
need them.
Die. It shall be done. [Crossing, l.] But my mother—
Cru. Must remain here, under the charge of Friday,
while myself and Bluff endeavour to decoy our enemies
further from the cave. If we can elude their vigilance
till Iglou and his party land, all danger ceases. Away,
Diego! and remember my instructions.
[Music—Friday has drawn the tabic aside, and opens a
trap beneath it, r, c.,from whence he brings cartridges,
and distributes them rapidly—Ines clings to her son,
who with difficulty quits her embrace, and exit at the
secret pass, l.—Crusoe, greatly distressed at her situa-
tion, directs Friday to protect her, and beckoning to
the seaman, leaves the cave, l. f.—Friday has closed
the trap, replaced the table, and extinguished the lamp
—Ines sinks on a part of the rock—the moon, sinking
over the trees without, gives a sombre light.
Enter Nipchezse, up.
Nip. So I have got out of harm's way at last—[Fri-
day perceives Nipcheese, and conceals himself behind the
table.]—sneaked out o' the battle gloriously—yes, I shall
be snug here.—What a night have I passed! buffeted by
one party, and abused by the other!—They set no more
value on my precious life, than they would on a mouldy
biscuit. [Taking out his bottle.] This is the only friend I
have in the world, but I've drawn upon him for comfort
so often, I fear he won't honour my drafts much longer.
[Drinks*—Ines revives, and observes Nipchecse—she
looks round the cave for Friday, but does not perceive
him,
Ines. [Aside.] Alone! deserted!
Nip, I shouldnever keep my spirits up, without pour-
ing spirits down.:—What's here? A table and a box—ey f
why, this must be the very place the boatswain ordered
us to seek! It is the cave of Crusoe I Lord! I hope
he's not at home t I suppose the firing, just now, alarmed
the whole family! It did me, I know.—I wonder what's
in this box, it's monstrous heavy—as I'm an honest man,
here's the key fastened to it, with a bit of rope-yarn.
[Opening the box.'} Money! yes, by ray curiosity, gold I
and—a case of jewels! precious stones!—Now, if I
don't take care of it, Windlass and the rest will commit
a robbery, and call it lawful spoil!—they shan't say I'm
greedy.—I'll manage it as most prize-agents do—pocket
the best part, for the trouble of dividing the rest.
[ines directs her attention to the treasure, and prepares
to address Nipcheeset when the exclamation of Friday
arrests her,
FrL [Unable to contain his rage,} He dam rogue!
[Music.
Nip, Ey! [Slapping down the lid of the box in terror,]
Who's there? Who's that spoke?
Swivel. [Without,L. f.] Twas I, Swivel! Where are
you? [ Music ceases,
Nip, I'm just in time. [Secures the case] It's the gun-
ner—he always calls me rogue—so I'm satisfied. [Turns
and sees Ines, who is seeking concealment.] Ines! Fire
and faggots! If she tells those fellows, I'm a dead man,
Ines. [Aside.] Heaven now direct me! by fixing their
attention, I may gain time
Enter Swivel and Gunwale, l. f.
Swi. Well, have you fouud out where he swing! his
hammock?
Nip. Yes, in this cave, and there stands the mistress,
Swi. His wife!
Nip. I'm glad they're come,—I should never have
managed that she dragon by myself.
Swi. Where is the captain?
Jnes. Safe! safe on board the vessel.
Swi. Escaped to the ship! impossible!—Is Crusoe
with him?
Jnes. No—he vowed never to quit this spot, and in-
sisted on my remaining with him.—But, oh! swear to
restore me to Diego's arms, and at once you gain his
favour and a mine of wealth.
Nip. Convey you to your son? I thought 'twas your
only wish to recover your old husband.
[She dissents and shows the casket,
Sivi. [A mazed, c] Money!
Gun. (l.) Gold!
Nip. [Aside.] I'm glad she doesn't miss the jewels.
[The seamen are astonished when they open the box.
Ines. [Looking round."] Look—behold! release me,
and more—all—all shall be yours.
Nip. [Aside.] Zounds! is there more?
Gun* Swivel.
Swi. What's the boatswain to us?
Nip. Every man for himself, say I. [Taking the casket.}
What say you?
Gun. But how to get her off? The boat's sunk.
Nip. Wait in the wood till daybreak.
Swi. And then hail the vessel—so we can.
Ines. Are you resolved?
Swi. We'll do it.
Nip. Never fear us, we'll do any thing for money.
[Friday by accident lets fall the lid of the chest—hies
screams.
Nip. What the deuce was that? Why do you look so
terrified? .
> Swi. Be quick, our comrades will come alongside,
else.
[Music,—lnes points to the table—the seamen put %t
hack,
Nip. Ah! a cell! an excavation!
[They raise the trap—Gunwale descends, and Swivel
stands a step down—Friday remains behind the chest.
Swi. Zounds! what a cargo of riches I
Nip. Fair play, my lads, below! We share alike, re-
member.
Swi. Look you there's no foul play aloft; you remain
and keep guard here.
Nip. I will,
Ines. {Greatly distressed, and looking again for aid,
catches the eye of Friday.] He sees me,—he under-
stands -j
Nip. How devilish dark it is. [Looking down.] Is it
very deep? I'll not trust the rascals—they'll Be helping
themselves—holloa! '•*; *
[Music.—Nipcheese having descended a step ^or two,
Friday springs suddenly forward, and driven him down
the trap-~Ines drops on her knee in thankfulness, and
turning, catches the hand of Friday, who is now greatly
delighted. ~
Enter Bluff, pale and disordered, t.f.'
Ines. Ah! what new calamity?
Bluff. All's lost! you must not remain here an instant!
Ines. My husband I speak!
Bluff. 1 canH speak—I'm choaked! he is taken by
that devil, Windlass.
Ines. [In despair.] Then he is lost!
[Friday is in an agony of grief.
Cru. [Without,l.] Ines—my wife!
Ines. 'Tis his voice!—Husband! Crusoe!
Bluff. [Dragging her off by the secret pass, u] Come,
come!
Win. [ Without, i..] This way! force him along!
Cru. [Without, l.] Oh, Ines! oh, my wife!
Ines. Oh, let us begone! his only comfort now will
be in my safety—for him I have lived, with him I'll die.
[Music.—Ines breaks away from Bluff, who goes into
the secret pass, l., and rushes into the arms of Crusoe,
whot secured by Windlass and another, has forced his
way into the cave—they are dragged off together—
Nipcheese ascends from the cell, r. c.—Friday seizes
him by the collar, and encounters Gunwale—during
the combat Swivel ascends—Nipcheese is tumbled into
the chest by Friday—he disables Swivel, who flies—the
combat continues—Nipcheese watches his advantage,
and escapes, L. f.—Friday is disarmed, and contrives
to avoid the blows aimed at him till he gains a pistol,
with which he shoots the Mutineer, it., and, jumping
on the chest, looks down on the body in a mingled
emotion of alarm and joy.
SCENE II—Fori o/Jfte Odar Wood, and one of the
Outlets from the Subterraneous Pass,
Enter the Cannibal Chief, Pariboo, who has been left
oh the island—he appears skulking about on the watch
Jor Crime—hearing a step within the cave, t. in r., he
rehires, r., with 'expressions of vengeance,—Enter
Bluff, hastily, l.f., having missed the avenue that
leads to the shore.
Bluff. [Pausing and listening.] All's quiet, there's no
pursuit!—O, that I had but saved her!—that I had but
died with her, rather than bear such heavy tidings to her
son—it will be his turn next—poor souls! they've had a
stormy passage through the royage of life !—Ey! how's
this? [Looking round."] I see no rock, no shore—yet
'twas by that passage that the captain—[ Voices without,
i..] hark! I hear them!
Enter Friday, hastily, from the cave, u f.—he rushes out,
l.—Pariboo re-appears, r., and follows in a crouching
attitude, watching him off, i.
t Bluff. They are quarrelling amongst themselves!
there's hope in that! [Noise repeated, L.] Yes, they are
divided one against the other. I must find the captain,
any how,—Under Providence, there may be a chance
.yet. [Music—Exit Bluff, r.
;SCENE III'.—Part of the Coast on which Crusoe was
wrecked~-rin the front, r. is a pole, on which is affixed
'this inscription, ** I was cast on this Island, Sep-
. tember SOth, 1659, Robinson Crusoe."— On this pole
are perceived the notches, by which means he counted the
time—a steep rock in the distance, r. u, em with an ascent
to ityoverlooking the $ea—-the whole of the right occupied
with a wood of cedar-trees, which is in the form of an
amphitheatres-rocks under the wood, and a chasm distin-
. guishes the opening to the secret pass, l.—the sea, c.—
the whole sombre, extensive, and wildly picturesque—it
is early dawn, which gradually increases.
Music.—Diego discovered, increasing the fire, which flames
on the summit of the rock, n. v. e.
Die. [Coming down,"] I watch in vain! in vain I feed
the beacon's fires: no sound, no signal, is returned that
speaks approaching aid, cr cheers expiriug hope. These
Indians, on whom we have relied, dreading a conflict
so unequal, have possibly detained their more courage*
ous chief, and all again is doubt, suspense, and agony.
[Coming forward.} What can have happened 1— The
early dawn already" shows the dark gray line of the
horizon, yet my father comes not, or my friend; they
surely must be safe"—had the secret passage been dis-
covered, ere now these wretches had explored it. At
intervals, confused and distant sounds have broke upon
the stillness of;the night, and through this, vaulted chasm,
accents of supplication^-and complaint have seemed to
float upon the wailing blast—again 1 hark! it is not
fancy! oh, mother! mother 1
EnUr Bluff, l. v. e
Bluff. So, IWright atlast. [Diego starts'and tistens.]
Diego! Captain'
Die* (r.) Bluffi my friend! then all is well. I must
have been deceived.
Bluff (jl.) Hush! not so loud I—Have the Indians
appeared? have they arrived?
Die. No: since midnight I have watched incessantly
—but tell me
Bluff We must extinguish that fire.
Die, Why so?—You know its purpose'*
Bluff. I do; but—it—it may be a guide for foes as
well as friends.
Die. Foes! my heart misgives me—I dread to ask—
Bluff. You shall know all, but first
Die* Silence!
Enter Friday, at the mouth of the cave, 1.
Fri. Massa Diego!
Bluff. 'Tis Friday. [Mustc.—Diego runs eagerly acros
to Friday, who meets htm with great delight, till inquiries
are made, when his expression instantly varies, and he
describes in action the situation of Ines and Crusoe—ob-
serving them.] I say, Blackee! what do you turn up the
white of your eyes, and keep bailing out bad luck there
for ?—Be alive, my lad, and smother the flame, quick \
Die, They are lost, inevitably lost! nothing now can
save them.
Bluff. Nothing! you forget, you forget J courage,
captain 1 do not shame your mother! she lias a heart as
feeling as your own, but as fearless as your father's t
remember how he was saved, how wonderfully found.
Never believe the hand that preserved him then means
to desert him now—perhaps at this very moment
[The tow and lengthened note of a conch is heard, i. u. e.
—Bluffy Diego, and Friday become fixed with asto*
nishment—a second sound is heard*
Fri. [ With the most extravagant gestures.} 'Tis Iglou!
'tis de Carib 1
[He run* up the rock, and extinguishes the fire.
Bluff. 1 said it, I was sure on't!
Die* Yes, I see—I acknowledge the innocent are
never friendless.
[Music.—The dawn advances, as to make all the objects
distinct—the march of the friendly Indians is heard.
Enter Iglou, l. v. e., giving a signal of command to the
rest to advance* and is welcomed by Friday and Diego—
Iglou points off to his Warriors, and intimates their tn-
* tention to stand by him and Crusoe to the last.—Enter
the Indians in march, i. V. e.
Bluff* (l.) [Looking at the Warriors with surprise and
satisfaction.] Ecod! they are a set of clean-made fel-
lows. I say, Captain, what a pity 'tis they can't abide
the smell of gunpowder—if they could but stand fire,
we should be a match for a score of such fellows as
Windlass*
Die* (R.) Friday informs me, that Iglou has selected
from his tribe those who, by a slight intercourse with
Europeans, have become acquainted with our arms, and
the manner of using them.
Bluff. Ay, ay!
Die. Our method of attack and defence they meet by
- stratagems peculiar to themselves, as snares, ambush,
and sudden assault.
Bluff. Why, they are at it now. ,
Die* Observe.
[Music.—Friday has been explaining to the Savages the
use of his pistols, persuading them not to be alarmed, ifc.
—Iglou has ordered his people to the wood, r., and they
are seen lopping down branches with their tomahawks,
each man returning with a bough-~Iglouf by a 'signal,
causes the Indians to crouch behind their branches, and
not one appears in sight—Iglou in front, with his ear to
the ground*
Die. Some one approaches! 'tis a single step*-we
must act as occasion justifies.
[Music*—Bluff retires to the chasm, h.t from which he
observes what passes—Diego, Friday, and Iglou re'
tire up, c.
Enter Nifcheese, r„ tipsy,
Nip, Oh, dear, oh, dear t when will all my troubles
end ?—Every thing I do iuakes bad worse. I thought
to dispel fear by drinking; instead of that, it makes me
see danger double. [The Indians move slowly, and form a
line behind Nipcheese, still concealed by the branches,] I
can't move an inch without meeting some accommodating
body, ready and willing to blow out my brains—it's
really very unpleasant. First, I was beset with savages,
then nearly buried alive, and presently, I suppose, 1
shall—ey! [The Indians, screened by the branches, file,
one by one, past each other, and encompass him, so that
wherever Nipcheese turns, his view and progress are ob-
structed.'] Now, whether my head runs round, or those
trees have run round, rot me if I can tell. I have it—this
island is enchanted—I shouldn't be surprised if I am
transformed as Crusoe is, and look for all the world
like an old he goat on his hinder legs—lord! what will
Mrs. Nipcheese say then! however, I'll hide my jewels
in the crannies of that rock, till it's time to embark, and
then [He approaches the chasm, l.—Bluff starts for-
ward with a pistol presented.] Another pistol! don't, don't
fire, you'll oblige me exceedingly.
Bluff, Another word, and 'tis your last.
[Music.—Nipcheese makes an effort to get away—the In-
dians shout and drop their branches—Nipcheese falls on
his knees, Diego and Friday starting forward at the
same instant, to prevent an attack from Iglou.
Die. Tell me instantly the plans of your accomplices.
Nip. I'll tell you every thiug, give you every thing,
[Holding out the case of jewels, which Friday snatches.]
only save me from being roasted, and made a meal of.
Die. Where is my mother?—Where is Ines and
Crusoe 1
Nip. In the cave—they'll be here presently,
pie. And Windlass?
D
Nip. He'll be here, too—you may kill him and wel-
come.
Die. What's his intent?
Nip. To make somebody swim to the ship, and tell a
parcel of lies to the crew—I was afraid he'd pitch upon
me, and having no stomach for water, got out of his
way, and tumbled into your's.
Bluff. The ship! well thought on—I'll be beforehand
with them. They, have warped her close in shore, and-
I can soon paddle one of the canoes there. Giro us a
shove off, Friday; and, in less time than the turning of a
capstan, I'll give 'em a broadside shall shiver these rocks,
like the topsails in a hurricane, in the Bay of Biscay,
my lads; so heave a-head.
[Gets into Iglou's canoe, and Friday pushes it off, l.
Die, Now aid us to protect my father, assist in pre-
serving my mother, and you will save yourself.
Nip, I will, I will, as I'm a sinner, and hope to be
saved.
Die, Do not think we shall lose sight of you; not a
word you utter will escape us. If I observe the least
attempt at treachery; though I perish iu the act, that
moment is your last.
Nip* You needn't doubt me; I always have an eye to
business, and make it a rule to stick by the strongest.
Die. When they have brought hither, and secured
their prisoners, decoy them from the spot, as you may
best be able—remember! [Retires,
[Music,—Iglou forms the Indians into separate concealed
clusters, resembling clumps of bushes, n. and L,—Diegc
takes his station near l. s. e.
Fri. See, da I poor Massa Crusoe come!
Enter the Party, with Crusoe and Ines, bound, r.
Win. Now, then, belay them to those stakes, [The
Mutineers are binding them to the stake, R.] while the
gunner hails the vessel from the rock. [Observing the
Mutineers.] The woman to that. [Pointing to one, l.,
more distant from Crusoe, to which they fasten her,"] Swi-
vel, take your station on the rock. [He sees Nipcheese.]
So, you landlubber, where have you been skulking?
Nip (l.) Skulking! I've been waiting for you: 'twas
no use to hail the ship before 'twas light, so I amused
myself by reading an almanack.
Win, (r.) What, read in the dark, you drunken
scoundrel!
Nip. I beg your pardon, I've been sober this five mi-
nutes, and the book that I was examining is in large
text hand—only look.
[Crosses, R., pointing to the inscription.
Win, It's a rum sort o' log-book, sure enough, mess-
mates! what's that writing at the top I
Nip, That's what I can't make out,

c.—Swivel ascends the rock, a. u. e., and makes signal
to the ship—at the call of Windlass, the Mutineers come
forward—Iglou appears, and attempts to cut the cords
that confine the captives—at this moment the Parrot

are left without them—previous to this movement, and
the instant the Sailors quit their Stations, Diego shows
himself, «»d makes Crusoe and Ines understand his in-
tention.
Block, This is the way he kept his reckoning, I sup-
pose. [Music,
Win, We know* that well enough.
Parrot [Calls from the top of the slake,] Poor Robin f
Win, Robin! who said Robin? [To Block, next him,]
Did you say Robin?
Block, No, I didn't say Robin.
Win, [Crossing to Nipcheese.] Did you say Robin?
Nip, No, I said nothing about robbing anybody.
Win. I'm sure somebody said Robin; but look aloft,
tell us what's on the cross-trees!
Block, [Reading.] "I came to this t—s—land"
Win, Island, you dunce—'* I came to this island,"
isn't that it? [To Nipcheese,
Nip. Yes, that's plain enough. [Aside,] 1 don't think
you'll leave it, though, in a hurry. [Music,
Win, But what comes next 1
[The Parrot flies off, i., and in passing Friday, who is on
the watch near Ines, cries, "Friday, poor Friday!"
Win, [Sharply to Block.] Friday, who said Friday?
Block, I didn't say Friday.
Win, [To Nipcheese.] Did you say Friday?
• a
Nip. -Not I; I didn't mention any day in the week.
Win, [Advancing again to the inscription."] Well,
what do all those pot-hooks and hangers stand for?
Nip. Let me try again—I can see much clearer than
I could just now. * I came to this island Sevtember $Qth,
1659, Robinson Crusoe"
Win, He has been on this station a plaguy long time,
then.
Nip. Yes, but, I think he has quitted his statiou by
this time.
Swi. [From the rock, R. u. E.] They return the signal,
—I see the launch and jolly-boat putting off.
Win* That's well—be ready.—Now, then, for the
prisoners—ey! sdeath and fire! where are they?
Block, The prisoners are all gone!
Nip, The prisoners! bless my soul, they are gone
sure enough! and the trees are gone, too!
Win. Careless scoundrels! pursue instantly!
Swi, Keep your ground! I see them, they are pro-
ected by a swarm of Indians 1
Win. Indians! pshaw! a single shot will disperse a
thousand—follow me!
Nip. Follow I hurra, my boys '.-—hurra! [Music.—
Exeunt Windlass and the whole of the Mutineers, t. s. e.]
I'll remain here as a corps de reserve. [Shouting without,
i. u, e.] There's work! [Gunsfired without, l. s.E.,and
another yell by the Indians,"] there's chopping and lopping!
If they fire at random, they'll be sure to hit me! [Another
jell, and shouts, I. u. e.] By the lord, they're coming
back again.

and dashing down his pistol, as having missed his
object, draws his cutlass, and is attacked by Crusoe—

PROSCENIUM AND DROP SCENE.
S=»IC*OSO:0:iXriTX3MC,—A most effective Proscenium can be
formed by^utilising the paper made for this purpose. Three pieces of wood are
merely required,shaped according to the above design,and covered with the paper;
the proscenium having the appearance of puffed satin panels, in gold frames,
with Shakespeare medallion hi the centre. ..',. ^^
Puffed satin paper, light blue, size 20 inches by 30 inches, per sheet, Is.
Imitation GoloTBordering, per sheet Is., making 14 feet.
Shakespearean Medallion, 18 inches in diameter, 2s.
DROP SOBSra. —The picture shown above Is an illustra-
tion of this scene. It comprises four sheets of paper which are to be pasted in
thecentre of any sized canvas that may be requisite for the drop curtain. Size
6*feet by 6 feet Price 10s. 6d. .. -
.—These comprise three sheets of paper each, and can be
hid either for drawing-room or cottage purposes. Size, 7 feet by 8 feet. Price,
complete, 5s. each.:
"'I^'arafiTDO'lTir---™8 k a parlour window formed with two sheets
of paper, and could be made practicable to slide up and down by mo anting
on two pieces of wood, allowing one to groove into the other at the sides. • The
introduction of cnrtalns each side would make it very effective. Size 8 feet by ,41
feet. Price 4s., complete.
X"JEUE12iarCOBC XJ€TXHnOO"\^. — Ckmsiflttog of foui
sheets of paper, representing a window containing four large ornamental
frosted glass panes with coloured glass round. Size 6J feet Ugh by 6 feet.
Price7s. 6d. • .,....* > <
p]fp.TrPT.. AfmJ-This is also made with two sheets of paper.
The fire is lighted; but should this not be required a fire-paper can be hung over
it. It will be found most useful in many farces wherein a character has to climb'
up achimney, and many plays where a fireplace is indispensable. By purchasing
a door, window, and fireplace an ordinary room scene could easily be constructed
with the addition of some wall-paper. Size 8 feet by 4} feet. Price, complete,*!..
All canvas, calico, or other material used for scenery should be sewn In'hori-
zontal strips, this prevents racking when rolled up.'
The Proscenium Paper, Medallion, Drop Scene, and French
•Window, can be seen mounted at 89, Strand, London.
