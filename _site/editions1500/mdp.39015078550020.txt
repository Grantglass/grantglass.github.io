THE
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
OF
ROBINSON CRUSOE.
I WAS born at York, in the year 1632, of a
reputable family. My father was a native
Bremen, who, by merchandizing at Hull for
some time, gained a very plentiful fortune-
He married my mother at York, who received
her first breath in that country: and as her
maiden name was Robinson, I w$s called
Robinson Kruetznaer, which not being easily
pronounced in the English tongue, we are"
commonly known by the name of Crusoe.
^ I was the youngest of three brothers. The
eldest was a lieutenant-colonel in LoekhartV
regiment, but slain by the Spaniards; what
became of the other I could never leara.
A 2;

No charge nor pains were wanting in my
education. My father designed me for the
law, yet nothing could serve me but I must
go to sea, both against the will of my father,
the tears of my mother, and the intreaties of
friends. One morning my father expostulated
very warmly with me. What reason, says he,
have you to leave your native country, where
there must be a more certain prospect of con-
tent and happiness, to enter into a wandering
condition of uneasiness and uncertainty? He
recommended to me Agur's wish, Neither to
desire poverty y nor riches; that a middle state
of life was the most happy; and that the high
towering thoughts of raising -our condition by
wandering abroad, were surrounded with mi-
sery and danger, and often ended with con-
fusion and disappointment. I entreat you,
nay, I command you, (says he,) to desist
from these intentions. Consider your eldest
brother, who laid down his life for his honour,
or rather lost it for his disobedience to my
will. If you will go, (added he,) my prayers
shall however be offered for your preservation;
but a time may come, when, desolate, op-
pressed, or forsaken, you may wish you had
taken your poor despised father's counsel.—.
He pronounced these words with such a mov-
ing and paternal eloquence, while floods of
tears ran down his aged cheek's, that it seemed
to stem the torrent of my resolutions. But
5
this soon wore off, and a little after I informed
my mother that I could not settle at any busi-
ness, my resolutions were so strong to see the
world, and begged she would gain my father's
consent only to go one voyage; which if it
did not prove prosperous, I would never at-
tempt a second. But my desire was as vain
as my folly in asking. My mother passionately
expressed her dislike of this proposal, telling
me, That as she satv that I was bent on my ouon
destruction, contrary to their xvill and my duty,
she mould say no morey but leave me to myself
to do voliatsoever I pleased.
I was then, I think, nineteen years old when
one time being at Hull, I met a school-fellow
of mine going along with his fcither, who was
master of a ship, to London, and acquainting
him with my wandering desires, he assured
me of a free passage, and a plentiful share
of what was necessary. Thus, without im-
ploring a blessing, or taking farewell of my
parents, I took shipping on the first of Sep-
tember 1651. We set sail soon after, and our
ship had scarce left the Humber a-stem, when
there arose so violent a storm, that; being ex-
tremely sea-sick, I concluded the judgments
of God deservedly followed me for my diso-
bedience to my dear parents. It was then I
called to mind the good advice of my father,
iiow easy and comfortable was a middle state
of life; and I firmly resolved, if it pleased.
6
God to set me on dry land once more, I would
return to my parents, implore their forgive-
ness, and bid a final adieu to my wandering
inclinations.
Such were my thoughts while the storm
continued; but these good resolutions de-
creased with the danger; more especially wlien
my companion came to me, clapping me on
the shoulder: What, Bob, said he, sure yon
was not frightened last night with scarce a cap-
fid of wind?—And do you, cried I. call such &
violent storm a capful of wind? A storm, you
fool you, said he, this is nothing I a good ship
and sea-room always baffles such a foolish squall
of wind as that: but you re a fresh water sailor
Come,, hoy, turn out, see what fine weather we
JiQve now, and a good bowl of punch will drown
all, our past sorrows. In short, the punch,
was made, I was drunk, and in one night's
time drowned both my repentance and my
good resolutions, forgetting entirely the vows
and promises I made in my distress; and
whenever any reflections would return on me,
what by company, and what by drinking, I
soon mastered those fits, as I deridingly called
them. But this only made way for another
trial, whereby I could not but see how much
I was beholden to kind Providence.
Upon the sixth day we came to an anchor
in Harwich road, where we lay wind-bound
with some Newcastle ships; and there being
7
a go®d anchorage, and our cables seund, the
seamen forgot their late toil and danger, and
spent the time as merry as if they had been
on shore. But on the eighth day there arose
a brisk gale of wind, which prevented out
tiding it up the river; and still increasing, our
ship rode forecastle in, and shipped several
large seas.
It was not long before horror seized the
seamen themselves, and I heard the master
express this melancholy ejaculation, Lord
have mercy upon us, ive sliall be all lost and
undone! For my part, sick unto death}. I'kept
my cabin, till the universal and terribly dreads
ful apprehensions of our speedy fate made me
get upon deck, and there I was affrighted in-
deed. The sea went mountains high.: I coul^l
see nothing but distress around nsi two ships
had cut their masts on board, and another'was
foundered; two more that had rost their an-
chors, were forced out. to the mercy of th§
ecean; and, to save our lives, we were forced
to cut our foremast and mainmast quite away.
Who is there so ignorant as not to judge of
my dreadful condition? I was but a fresh
abater sailor, and therefore seemed more ter-
rified. Our ship wras very good, but over-
loaded; which made the sailors often cry out,
She mil founder: words I then was ignoratit
of. All this while the storm continuing, and
rather increasing, the master and the moxe
8
sober part of the men went to prayers, ex-
pecting death every moment* In the middle
of the night one cried out, We had sprung a
leak: another, That there was Jour feet water
in the hold. I was just ready to expire with
fear, when immediately all hands were called
to the pump; and the men forced me also in
that extremity to share with them in their la-
bour. While thus employed, the master espy-
ing some colliers, fired a gun as a signal of dis-
tress ; and I not understanding what it meant,
smd thinking that either the ship broke, or
some dreadful thing happened, fell into a swoon.
Even in that common condition of woe, no-
fcody minded me, excepting to thrust me aside
vith their feet, thinking me dead; and it was
a great while before I recovered,
Happy it was for us, when, upon the signal
given, they ventured out their boat to save our
Jives. All our pumping had been in vain, and
Irain had all our attempts been, had they not
come to our ship's side, and our men cast them
a rope over the stern with a buoy to it, which
after great difficulty they got hold of, and we
hauling them to us, got into their boat, and
left our ship, which we perceived sink within
less than a quarter of an hour; and thus 1
learned what was meant by foundering at sea,
.&nd now the men incessantly laboured to re-
cover their own ship; but the sea ran so high,
and the wind blew so hard, that they thought
9
it convenient to bale within shore, which with
great difficulty and danger at last we happily
effected, landing at a place called Cromer, not
far from Wintevton light-house; from whence
we all walked to Yarmouth, where, as objects
of pity, many good people furnished us with
the necessaries to carry us either to Hull or
London.
Strange! that after all this, like the pro-
digal son, I did not return to my father; who,
hearing of the ship's calamity, for a long time
thought me entombed in the deep. No doubt
but I should have shared in Ms fatted calf, as
the scripture o;prcsseth it; but my wayward
disposition sttil pushed me on, in spite of the
powerful convict ions-of reason and conscience.
When we hail been at Yarmouth three days,
I met my old companion, who had given me
the invitation to go on board along with his
father. His behaviour and speech was altered,
and in a melancholy manner asked tme how I
did? telling his father who I was, and how I
Iiad made tt;is ^oyage'for a trial only to pro-
ceed farther abroad. Upon which the old gen-
tleman turning to me, said, Young man, you
ought never to go to sea any more, but to take
this for a certain ^ign, that you xvill never jwos-
fer in a sea-faring condition* Sir, answered I,
will you take the same resolution? It is a dif-
ferent case, said he, it is my calling, andco?ise-
quently my duty j but as you have made this
A 3
JO
voyage for a trial, you see wJipi- Wl luckheaven
has set before your eyes; and perhaps our Tttise-
ries have been on your account, tike Jonah in the
ship of Tarshish. But pray what are you, and
on what account did you go to sea? Upon which
I very freely declared my whole story; at the
end of which he made this exclamation, Ye
sacred Powers! what had I committed, that
such a wretch should enter into my ship, to
heap upon me such a deluge of miseries! But.
soon recollecting himself, Young man, said he,
if you do not go bach, depend upon it, wherever
you go you will meet with disasters and disap*>
pointpimts till your father s words are fulfilled
Upon you. And so^ve parted.
I thought at first to return home; but shame
opposed that good notion, as thinking I should
be laughed at by my neighbours and acquaint-
ances. So strange is the nature of youth, who
are not ashamed to sin, but yet ashamed to re-
pent; and so far from being ashamed of those
factions for which they may be accounted fools,
they think it folly to return to their duty, which
is the principal mark of wisdom. In short, I
travelled up to London, resolving upon a voy-
age, and a voyage I soon heard of, by my ac-
quaintance with a captain who took a fancy to
me, to go to the coast of Guinea. Having
some money, and appearing like a gentleman,
I went on board, not as a common sailor or
foremast man; nay. the commander agreed I
11
-sliould ge that voyage with him without any
expense; that I should be his messmate and
companion, and that I was welcome to carry-
any thing with me, and make the best merchan-
dise I could.
I blessed my happy fortune? and humbly
thanked my captain for his offer, and acquaint-
ing my friends in Yorkshire, forty pounds were
sent me, the greatest part of which my dear
father and mother contributed, with which I
bought toys and trifles, as the captain directed
me. My captain also taught me navigation,
how to keep an account of the ship's course,
take an observation, and led me into th#know-
ledge of several useful branches of the mathe-
mati<?ks. And indeed this voyage made me
both a sailor and a merchant; for I brought
home five pounds nine ounces of gold dust,
for my adventure, wMch produced, at my re-
turn to London, almcWt three hundred pounds;
but in this voyage I was extremely sick, h^hlg:
thrown into a violent, fever through excessive^
heat, trading upon the coast from the latitude
of fifteen degrees north, even to the line itself.
But, alas 1 my dear friend the captain soon
departed this life after his arrival. This was a
sensible grief to me ; yet I resolved to go ano-
ther voyage with his mate, who had now got
command of the ship. This proved a very un-
successful one; for though 1 did not carry a
hundred pounds^of my late acquired wealth?
12
(so that I had two hundred pounds left, which
I reposed with the captain's widow, who was
an honest gentlewoman), yet my misfortunes
in this unhappy voyage were very great* For
our ship sailing towards the Canary Islands,
we were chased by a Salee rover; and in spite
of all the haste we could make, by crouding
as much canvass as our yards could spread, or
our masts carry* the pirate gained upon us,
so that we prepared ourselves to fight. They
had eighteen guns, and we had but twelve.
About three in the afternoon there was a des-
perate engagement, wherein many were killed
and wounded on both sides: but finding our-
selves overpowered with numbers, our ship dis-
abled, and ourselves too impotent to have the
least hopes of success, we were forced to sur-
render; and accordingly we were all carried
prisoners into the port, of Salee. Our men
were sent to the Empe court to be sold
there.; but the pirate captain taking notice of
me, kept me to be his own slave.
In this condition I thought myself the most
miserable creature on earth, and the prophecy
of my father came afresh into my thoughts.
However, my condition was better than I
thought it to be, as will soon appear. Some
hopes indeed I had that my new patron would
go to sea again, where he might be taken by a
Spanish or Portuguese man of war, and then
I should be set at liberty. But in this I wa$.
13
mistaken; for he never took me with him, but
left me to look after his little garden, and do
the drudgery of his house, and when he re-
turned from sea, would make me lie in the
cabin, and look after the ship. I had no one
that I could communicate my thoughts to,
which were continually meditating my escape.
No Englishman, Irishman, or Scotchman here
but myself; and for two years I could see no-
thing practicable, but only pleased myself with
the imagination.
After some length of time, my patron, as I
found, grew so poor, that he could not fit out
his ship as usual; and then he used constantly,
once or twice a week, if the weather wastair,
to go out a fishing, taking me and a young
JVIoresco boy to row the boat; and so much
pleased was he with me for my dexterity in
catching the fish, that he would often send me
with a Moor, who was one of his kinsmen, and
the Moresco youth, to catch a dish of fish for
him.
One morning as we were at sport, tl^ere
arose such a thick fog, that we lost sight of
the shore; and rowing we knew not which way,
we laboured all the night, and in the morning
we found ourselves in the ocean, two leagues
from land. However, we attained there at
length, and made the greatest haste,, because
qui- stomachs were exceeding sharp and hun-
gry. In order to prevent such disasters for
1*
the future, my patron ordered a carpenter to
build a little stale-room or cabin in the middle
of the long boat; with a place behind it to
steer and hale home the main sheet, with other
conveniences to keep him from the weather,
as also lockers to put in all manner of provi-
sions; with a handsome shoulder-of-mutton
sail, gibing over the cabin.
Ill this he frequently took us out a fishing;
*and one time inviting two or three persons of
distinction to go with him laid in provisions ex-
traordinary; providing also three fusees, with
powder and shot, that they might have some
sport at fowling along the sea-coast. The next
morning the boat was made clean, her ancients
and pendants out, and every thing ready; but
their minds altering, my patron ordered us to
go a fishing, for that his guests would certainly
sup with him that night.
And now I began to think of my deliverance
indeed. In order to this, I persuaded the Moor
to get some provision on board, and to procure
some powder and shot, pretending to kill sea-
curlieus, which he innocently and lvadilv agreed
to. In short, being provided with all things
necessary, we sailed out.
When we had passed the castle, we fell to
fishing; but though I knew there was a bite, I
dissembled the matter, in order to put farther
out to sea. Accordingly we ran a league far-
ther, when, giving the boy the helm, and pre-
15
tending to stoop for something, I seized Muley
by surprize, and threw him overboard, Afc he
was an excellent swimmer, he soon arose, and
made towards the boat; upon which I took
out a fusee, and presented it at him: "Muley,"
said I? "I never yet designed to do you any
"harm, and seek nothing now but my redemp-*
Ci tion. I know you are able enough to swim
"to shore, and save your life; but if yoti^are
"resolved to follow me to the endangering 6f,
lc mine, the very moment you proceed I will,
<fi shoot you through the head." The harmless
creature, at these words, turned himself from
me, and I make no doubt got safe to land.
Then turning to the boy Xury, I perceived he
trembled at the action; but I put him out of
all fear, telling him, that if he would be true
and fa ithful to me, I would-do well by him;
"and therefore^' said I, "you nurst stroke
"your face to be faithful, and, as the Turks
i4 ha^e taught you, swear by Mahomet, and
"the beard of your father, or else I will throw
<z you into the sea also." So innocent did the
child then look* and with such an obliging
smile consented, that I readily believed him,
and from that day forward began to love him
entirely.
We then pursued our voyage, I kept to the
southward, to the truly Barbarian coasts but
iii the dark of the evening I changed my course,
that I might keep near the shore; and having
16
a fresh gale 'of wind, with a very pleasant
smooth sea, by three o'clock next day I was
150 miles beyond the Emperor of Morocco's
dominions, i continued sailing for five days
successively, till such time as the wind shifting
to the southward, made me conclude, that if
any vessel was in chace of me they would pro-
ceed no further.
After so much fatigue and thought, I an-
chored at the mouth of a little river, I Knew
not what, or where, neither did I then see any
people. What I principally wanted was fresh
water; and I was resolved about the dusk of
the evening to swim ashore: but no sooner did
the gloomy clouds of night begin to succeed
the declining day, when we heard such'bark-
ing, roaring, and howling of wild creatures,
that one might have thought the very strongest
monsters of nature had their residence there.
Poor Xury, who was almost dead with fear,
entreated me not to go on shore that night.
"Suppose I don't, Xury," said I, "and in the
"morning we should see men who are worse
"than those we fear, what then?" "O den
"we may give dem de shoot gun," said he,
laughing, "and de gun make dem all run
"away." The wit, and broken English which
the boy had learned among the captives of our
nation, pleased me entirely; and to add to his
cheerfulness, I gave him a dram of the bottle.
We pouid get but little sleep all the night for
17
the terrible howlings they made; and indeed
we were very much affrighted.
The next morning I was resolved to go on
shore to get in fresh water, and venture myself
among the beasts or savages, should either at-
tack me. Xury said he would take one of the
jars, and bring me some, I asked him why he
would go and not I? The poor boy answered,
"If wild mans come, they eat me, you go
"away," This indeed increased my affections
to the child. "Well, dear Xury," said I,
"we will both go ashore, both kill wild mans,
"and they shall eat neither of us." So giving
Xury a piece of bread to eat and a dram, we
waded ashore, carrying nothing with us but
our arms, and two jars for water. I did not
go out of sight of the boat, as dreading the
savages coming down the river in their canoes:
but the boy seeing a low descent or vale about
a mile in the country, he wandered to it; and
then running back to me with great precipita-
tion, I thought he was pursued by some savages
or wild beasts; upon which I approached, re-
solving to perish, or protect him from danger.
As he came nearer to me, I saw something
hanging over his shoulders, which was a crea-
ture he had shot like a hare, but different in
colour, and with longer legs; however, we were
glad of it, for it proved wholesome and nou-
rishing meat; but what added to our joy was,
my boy assured me there was plenty of water,
18
and that he "saw no wild mans." And greater
still was our comfort, when we found fresh
water in the creek where we were when the
tide was xmt, without going so far up into the
countay.
In this place I began to consider that I
should meet some of the English trading ves-
sels, who would relieve and take us in.
The place I was in was, no doubt, that wild
Country, inhabited only by a few, that lies be-
tween the Emperor of Morocco's dominions
and the negroes. It is filled with wild beasts,
and the Moors use it for hunting chiefly. From
this place I thought I saw the top of the moun-
tain Teneriffe in the Canaries, which made me
try twice to attain it, but as often was 1 drove
back, and so forced to pursue my fortune along
shore.
Early one morning we came to an anchor
under a little point of land, but pretty high;
and the tide beginning to flow, we lay ready to
go further in; but Xury, wrhose youthful and
penetrating eyes were sharper than mine, in a
soft tone, desired me to keep far from land,
Test we should be devoured; "For look yon-
"der, mayster, and see de dreadful monster
"fast asleep on de side of de hill." Accord-
ingly looking where he pointed, I espied a
fearful monster indeed. It was a terrible great
lion that lay on shore, covered as it were by a
shade of a_ piece of the hill. "Xury," said I,
"you shall go on shore and kill him." But
the boy looked amazed. '* Me kill him 1" says
he, "he eat me at one mouthmeaning one
mouthful. J Upon which I bid him lie still, and
charging my biggest gun with two slugs, and a
good charge of powder, I took the best aim I
could to shoot him through the head; but his
leg lying over his nose, the slug broke his
knee-bone. The lion awaking with the pain,
sot up, but soon fell down, giving the most
hideous, groan I ever heard; but taking my se-
cond piece, I shot, him through the head, and
then he lay struggling for life. Upon this Xury
took; heart, and desired my leave to go on
shore. Go then, said L Upon which, taking
a little gun in one hand, he swam to shore with
the otlieiv and coming close to the lion, put a
period to his life> by shooting him again through
the head* • ,
But this was spending our ammunition fti
vain,, the flesh not being good to eat. Xury
was like a champion, and comes on board for
a hatchet to cut off the head of his enemy;
hut wanting strength to perform it, he cut oi£
and brought me a foot. I bethought me, how-
ever, that his skin would be of use. This
v. cost Xury and me a whole day: when spread-
ing it on the top of our cabin, the hot beams
of the sun effectually dried it in two days time,
m<& it afterwards served me for a bed to lie oa*
20
And now we sailed southerly, living spar-
ingly on our provisions, and went no oftener
on shore than* we were obliged for fresh water,
in hopes to meet some European ship. If Pro-
vidence did not favour me, my next course was
to seek for the islands, or lose my life among
the negroes; in a word, either I must meet with
some ship, or certainly perish.
One day as we were sailing along, we saw
people stand on the shore looking at us; we
could also'perceive they were black, and stark
naked. I was inclined to go on shore; but
Xury cried, No, no; however, I approached
nearer, and.I found they ran along the shore
by me a long way. They had no weapons in
their hands, except one, who held a long
stick, which Xury told me was a lance, with
which they could kill at a great distance. I
talked to them by signs, and made them sen-
sible I wanted something to eat; they beckoned
to me to stop my boat, while two of them ran
up into the country, and in less than half an
hour came back, and brought with them two
pieces of dry flesh, and some com, which we
kindly accepted; and to prevent any fears on
either side, they brought the food to the shore,
laid it down, then went and stood a great way
off, till we fetched it on board, and then came
close to us again.
But while we were returning thanks to them»
being all we could afford, two mighty cres*»
21
tures came from the mountains, one as it were
pursuing the other with great fury, which we
were the rather inclined to believe, as. they
seldom appear but in the night, and both these
swiftly passing by the negroes, jumped into
the sea, wantonly swimming about, as though
the diversion of the waters had put a stop to
their fierceness. At last one of them coming
nearer to my boat than I expected, or desired,
I shot him directly through the head, upon
which he sunk immediately, yet rising again,
he would have willingly made to the shore, but
between the wound and the struggling of the
water, he died before he could reach it.
It is impossible to express the consternation
the poor negroes were in at the firing of my
gun; much less can I mention their surprise,
when they perceived the creature to be slain by
it. I made signs to them to draw near it with
a rope, and then gave it to them to hale on
shore. It was a beautiful leopard, which made
me desire its skin; and the negroes seeming
to covet the carcase, I freely gave it to them.
As for the other leopard, it made to shore,
and ran with a prodigious swiftness out of
sight. The negroes having kindly furnished
me with water, and with what roots and grains
their country afforded, I took my leave, and,
•after eleven days sail, came in sight of the
Cape de Verd. But the great distance I was
from.it, and fearing contrary winds would pre-
22
vent my reach of them, I began to grovr rne*»
> laneholy and dejected, when upon a sudden,
X^:y cried out, *< Master, master," looking as
affrighted as if it was his master's ship sent ia
search of us. Bat I soon discovered she was
'a Portuguese ship. Upon which I strove for
life to come up to them. But in vain had it
been, if through*the.ir perspective glasses, they
had not perceived us, and shortened their sail
to iet us come in. Encouraged at this, I set
up my patron's ancient, and fired a gun, both
#s signals of distress; upon which they very
kindly lay to, so that in three hours time I came
tip with them. They spoke to me in Portu-
guese, Spanish, and French, but none of
these did 1 understand, till at length a Scots
gailor called, and then I told him I was an En-
glishman, who had escaped from the Moors at
Salee, upon which they took me kindly on
board, with all my effects.
Having a pleasant voyage to the Brazils, we
arrrived in the Bay de Todos los Santos, or All
Saints Bay, in twenty-two days after. And
here I cannot forget the generous treatment of
the captain. He would take nothing for my
passage, gave me twenty ducats for the leo-
pard's skin, and thirty for the lion's. Every
thing he caused to be delivered, andwhat I
could sell he bought. In short, I made 220
pieces of my cargo, and with this stock I en*
23
tered once more, as I may say, into the scene
of life.
But being recommended to an honest planter,
I lived with him till such time as I was informed
of the manner of their planting and making
sugar; and seeing how well they lived, and
how suddenly they grew rich, I was filled with w
a desire to settle among them.
To be brief, I bought a settlement nextdoor
to an honest and kind neighbour, born at Lis-
bon, of English parents, whose plantation join-
ing to mine, we improved very amicably toge-
ther. Both our stocks were low; and for twd
years we planted only for food; but the third
year we planted some tobacco, and each of us
dressed a large piece of ground the ensuing
year for planting canes.
Having none to assist me, my father's words
came into my mind; and I used to ask myself,
If what I sought was only a middle station of
life, why could it not as well be obtained in
England as here? When I pondered on this
with regret, the thoughts of my late deliverance
forsook me. I had none to converse with but
my neighbour, and no work done but by my own
hands; which often made me say my condition
was like to that of a man cast upon a desolate
island. So unhappy are we in our reflections,
so forg#ful of what good things we receive our-
selves, and so unthankful for our deliverance
from those calamities that others endure.
24
I was in some measure settled, before the
captain who took me up departed from the Bra-
zils. Qne day I went to him, and told him what
stock I had in London, desiring his assistance
in getting it remitted; to which the good gen-
tleman readily consented, but would only have
me send for half my money, lest it should mis-
carry, which, if it did, I might still have the
remainder to support me; and so taking letters
of procuration from me, bid me trouble myself
no further about it.
And indeed, he not only procured the money
I had drawn for upon my captain's widow, but
sent me over a servant, with a cargo propor-
tionable to my condition. He also sent me
over tools of all sorts, iron work and uterlils
necessary for my plantation.
Wealth now accumulating on me, and un-
common success crowning my prosperous la-
bours, I might have rested happy in that mid-
dle state of life my father so often recom-
mended; yet nothing would content me.
Having lived four years in Brazil, I had not
only learned the language, but contracted ac-
quaintance with the most eminent planters, and
even the merchants of St. Saivadore, three of
whom came one morning^ to me, saying they
had a secret proposal to make. After enjoining
me to secrecy, they told me they b$d a mind
to fit out a ship to go to Guinea, in order to
stock the plantation with negroes? which, M
25
they could not be publicly sold, they would di-
vide among them; and if I would go their su-
percargo in the ship, to manage the trading
part, I should have an equal share of the ne-
groes, without providing any stock. The thing
indeed was fair enough, had I been in another
condition: But I could not resist the proposal,
but accepted the offer, upon condition of their
looking after my plantation.
The ship being fitted out, and all things
ready, we set sail the first of September 1659.
We sailed northward upon the coast, from
whence going farther into the ocean out of the
sight of landj. we steered as though we were
bound for the island Fernand de Norenba, leav-
ing the islands on the east, and then it was we
met with a terrible tempest, which continued
for twelve days successively, so that the winds
carried us wheresoever they pleased. In this
perplexity one of our men died, and a man
and a boy were washed overboard. When the
weather cleared up a little, we found ourse%es
upon the coast of Guiana. Upon this the cap-
tain gave reasons for returning; which I op-
posed, counselling him to stand away for Bar-
badoes, which, as I supposed, might be at-
tained in fifteen days. So altering our course,
we sailed north-west and by west in order to
reach the Leeward Islands; but a second storm
succeeding, drove us to the westward, so that
we were justly afraid of falling into the hands
26
of cruel savages, or the paws of devouring
beasts of prey.
In this great distress, one of the men, early in
the morning, cried out, Land, land! which
he had no sooner cried than our ship struck
upon a sand bank, and in a moment the sea
broke over her in such a manner that we ex-
pected we should have perished immediately.
We knew nothing where we were, or upon
what land we were driven, whether an island
or the main, inhabited or not inhabited, and
we Giould not so much "as hope that the ship
would hold out many minutes, without break-
ing in pieces, unless the wind by a miracle
should turn about immediately. While we
stood looking at one another, expecting death
every moment, the mate lays hold of the boat,
and with the1 help of the rest got her flung over
the ship's side, and getting all into her, being
eleven of us, committed ourselves to God's
mercy, and the wild sea. And now we saw
that this last effort would not be a sufficient
protection from death ; so high did the sea rise,
that it was impossible the boat should live.
As to making a sail, we had none, neither if
we had could we make use of any. So that
when we had rowed, or rather were driven
about a league and a half, a raging wave, like
a lofty mountain, came rolling a-sterh of us,
and took us with such fury, that at once it
overset the boat. Thus being swallowed 4p m
 
>
o
w
to
27
a moment, we had hardly time to call upon
the awful name of God; much less to im-
plore, in dying ejaculations, his infinite mercy
to receive our departing souls.
Men are generally counted insensible when
struggling in the pangs of death; but while I
was overwhelmed with water, I had the most
dreadful apprehensions imaginable, for the joys
of heaven, and the torments of hell, seemed
to present themselves before me in these dying
agonies, and even small space of time, as it-
were, between life and death. I was going I
thought I knew not whither, in a dismal gulph
unknown, and as yet unperceived, never to
behold my friends, nor the light of this world
any more! I strove however to the last extre-
mity, while all my companions were over-
powered and entombed in the deep: and it was
with great difficulty I kept my breath till the
wave spent itself, and retiring back, left me
on the shore half dead with the water I had
taken in. As soon as I got on m}^ feet I ran as
fast as I could, lest another wave should pur-
sue me, and carry tue back again. But for all
the haste I made, I could not avoid it, for the
sea came after me like a high mountain, or a
furious enemy; so that'my business was to
hold my breath, and by raising myself on the
water, preserve it by swimming. The next
dreadful wave buried me at once twenty or
thirty feet deep, but at the same time carried
B 2
28
«ie with a mighty force and swiftness towards
the shore, when raising myself, I held out as
well as possible, till at length the water, hav-
ing spent itself, began to return, at which I
.struck forward, and feeling ground with my
feet, I took to my heels again. Thus being
served twice more, I was at last dashed against
a piece of rock in such a manner as left me
iSenseless, but recovering a little 'before the re-
turn of the wave, winch no doubt would then
•overwhelm me, I held fast by the rock till those
succeeding waves abated; and then fetching
another run, was overtaken by a .small wave,
which was soon conquered. JBut before any
more could overtake me, I reached the main
land, where clambering up the .cliffs of the
shore, tired and almost spent, I sat down on
the grass, free from the danger of the foaming
ocean.
No tongue can express the transports that
my soul felt at this happy deliverance. It was
Jike a reprieve to a dying malefactor, with a
halter about his neck and ready to be turned
% <off. I was wrapt up in contemplation, and
.often lifted up my hands, with the profoundest
humility, to the divine .power for saving my
life; when the rest of my companions were all
drowned. And now I began to cast my eyes
around, and to behold what place J was in, and
what I had next to do. I could see no house
nor people; I was wet, yiet had no clothes to
 
PAGE 28
29
shift me; hungry and thirsty, yet had nothing
to eat or drink, no weapon to destroy any
creature for my sustenance, nor defend myself
against devouring beasts; in short, I had no-
thing bat a knife, a tobacco pipe, and a box
half filled with tobacco. The darksome night
coming upon me, increased my fears of being
devoured by wild creatures, my mind was
plunged in despair, and having no prospect, as
I fhblight, of life before me, I prepared for
another kind of death than what I had lately
escaped. I walked about a furlong to see if I
could find any fresh water, which I did, to my
great joy ; and taking a quid of tobacco topre^
vent hunger, I got up into a thick bushy tree,
and seating myself so that I could not fall, a
deep sleep overtook me, and for that night
buried my sorrows in a quiet repose.
It was broad day the next morning before I
awoke, when I not only perceived the tempest
was ceased, but saw the ship driven almost as
far as the rock before mentioned, which was
about a mile from the place where I was*
When I came down from my apartment in the
tree, I perceived the ship's boat two miles dis-
tant on my right hand, lying on shore as the
waves had cast her. I thought to have got to
her; but there being an inlet of water about
half a mile's breadth between it and me, I re-
turned again towards the ship, as hoping to
find something for my more immediate subsist
B 3
so
ence. About noon, when the sea was so calm
that I could come within a quarter of a mile
of her, it was to my grief that I perceived,
that if we had kept on board all our lives had
been saved. These thoughts and my solitude
drew tears from my eyes, though all in vain.
So resolving to get to the ship, I stripped and
Jeaped into the water; when swimming round
her, I was afraid I could not get any thing to
lay hold of; but it was my good fortune to espy
a small piece of rope hang down so low, that,
by the help of it, though with great difficulty,
I got into the ship. Here I found that the ship
was bulged, and had a great deal of water in
her, her stern was Jifted up against a bank, and
her head almost in the water. All her quar-
ter, and what was there, were free and dry.
The provisions I found in good order, and,
losing no time, ate while I was doing other
things. I also found some rum, of which I
took a hearty dram; and now I wanted for no-
thing except a boat, which indeed was all, to
carry away what was needful for me.
Necessity occasions a quickness of thought.
We had several spare yards, a spare top-mast
or two, and two or three large spars of wood.
With these I fell to work, and slung as many
of them over board as I could manage, tying
every orie of them with a rope that they might
not drive iaway, 'jThis done, I went down the
chip's side? and tied four of them fast together
31
at both ends, in form of a raft, and laying two
or three short pieces of plank upon them cross-
ways, I found it would bear me, but not any
considerable weight. Upon which I went to
work again, cutthig a spare top-mast into three
lengths, adding them to my raft with a great
deal of labour and pains. I then, first laying
upon it^all the planks and boards I could get,
next lowered down three of the seamen's chests,
after I had filled them with bread, rice, three
Dutch cheeses, five pieces of dried goat's flesh,
and some European corn, wha> little the rats
had spared; and r&r liquors, I found several
cases of bottles, in which were some cordial
wnters, and four or five gallons of rack. By
this time, the tide beginning to flow, I per-
ceived my coat, waistcoat, and shirt, swim
away, which I had left on shore; as for my
linen breeches and stockings, I swam with them
to the ship; but I soon found clothes enough,
though I took no more than I wanted for the
present. My eyes were chiefly on tools to
work with, and after a long search, I found out
the carpenters chest, which I got safe down
on my rait. I then looked for arms and ammu-
nition, and in the great cabin found two good
fowling pieces, two pistols, several powder
horns filled, a small bag, of shot, and two rusty
swords. I likewise found three barrels of pow-
der, two of which were good, but the third
had taken water, also two or three broken oars,
32
two saws, an ax, and a hammer. • I then put
to sea, and in getting- to shore had three en-
couragements. 1. A smooth calm sea: 2. The
tide rising and setting in to the shore: 3. The
little wind there was blew towards land. After
1 had sailed about a mile, I found the raft to
drive a little distance from the place where I
first landed, and then I perceived an opening
of the land, with a strong current of the tide
running into it, upon which I kept the middle
of the stream. But great was my concern,
when on a sudden the forepart of my raft ran
aground. But after some time the rising of
the water caused th« raft to float again, and
coming up a little river, with land on both
sides, I landed in^ a little cave, as near the
mouth as possible, the better to discover a sail,
if any such providentially passed that way.
Not far off, I espied a hill of stupendous
height, surrounded with lesser hills about it,
and thither I was resolved to go and view the
country, that I might see what part was best
to fix my habitation in. Accordingly, arming
myself with a pistol, a fowling piece, powder,
and ball, I ascended the mountain. There I
perceived I was in an island, encompassed by
the sea, no distant lands to be seen, but scat-
tering rocks that lay tox the west; that it seem-
ed to be a barren place, and as I thought, only
inhabited by wild beasts. I perceived abund-
ance of fowls, but ignorant of what kind,
33
whether good for nourishment. I shot one of
them at my return, which occasioned a con-
fused screaming among the other birds, and I
found it, by its colour and beak, to be a kind
of hawk, but its flesh was perfect carrion.
When I came to my raft, I brought my
effects on shore, which work spent that day en-
tirely ; and fearing that some cruel beasts might
devour me in the night time while I slept I
made a kind of hut, or barricado, with the
chests and boards I had brought on shore.
That night I slept very comfortably; and the
next morning my thoughts were employed to
make a further attempt to the ship, and bring
away what necessaries I could find, before ano-
ther storm should break her in pieces. Accord-
ingly I got on board as before, and prepared a
second raft far more nice than the first; upon
which I brought away the carpenter's stores,
two or three bags full of nails, a great jack-
screw, a dozen or two of hatchets, and a grind-
stone. I also took twro or three iron crows,
two barrels of musket bullets, another fowling
piece, a small quantity of powder, and a large
bag full of small shot. Besides these, I took
all the men's clothes I could find, a spare fore-
top-sail, a hammock, and some bedding; and
thus compleating my second cargo, I made all
the haste to shore I could, fearing some wild
beast might destroy what I had there already.
Rut I only found a little wild cat sitting on one
34
of the chests, who not seeming to fear me, or
the gun that I presented at her, I threw her a
piece of biscuit, which she instantly eat and
departed.
When I had gotten these effects on shore, I
went to work, in order to make me a little tent
with the sail and some poles, which J had cut
for that purpose, and having finished it, what
things might be damaged by the weather I
brought in, piling all the empty chests and
casks in a circle, the better to fortify it against
any'sudden attempt of man or beast. After
this I blocked up the doors with some boards,
and an empty chest turned the long way out,
I then charged my gun and pistol, and laying
my bed on the ground, slept as comfortably
till the next morning as though I had been in
a christian country.
Now, though I had enough to subsist me a
longtime, yet despairing of a sudden deliver-
ance, or that both ammunition and provision
might be spent before such a thing happened,
I saved as much as I could, and so long as the
ship remained in that condition, I daily brought
away one necessary or other; particularly, the
rigging, sails, and cordage; some twine, a bar-
rel of wet powder, some sugar, a barrel of
meal, three casks of rum, and indeed what
was most welcome to me, a whole hogshead of
bread.
35
The next time I went I cut the cables in
pieces, carried off a hauser whole, with a great
deal of iron-work, and made another raft; but
this being so unwieldy, by the too heavy bur-
den I had upon it, and not being able so dex-
terously to guide it as the former, both my
cargo "and I were overturned. For my part, all
the damage I sustained was a wet skin ; and at
low water, after much labour in diving, I got
most of the cables, and some pieces of iron.
Thirteen days had I now been on the island
and eleven times on board, bringing away all
that was possible. As I was going the twelfth
time, the wind began to rise; however I ven-
tured at low water, and rummaging the cabin,
in a locker I found several razors, scissars, and
some dozens of knives and forks, and in ano-
ther thirty-six pounds in pieces of eight, silver
and gold. I wrapt the money up in a piece of
canvas, and began to think of making another
raft; but I soon perceived the wind began to
arise, a fresh gale blowing from the shore, and
the sky overcast with clouds and darkness. So
thinking a raft to be in vain, I let myself into
the water with what things I had about me;
and it was with much difficulty I got ashore,
when soon after it blew a fearful storm.
That night I slept very contentedly in my
little tent, surrounded with all my effects; but
when I looked out in the morning, no more ship
was to seen. This much surprised me for
36
the present: yet, when I considered that I had
lost no time, abated no pains, and had got
every thing useful out of her, I comforted my-
self in the best manner, and entirely submitted
to divine Providence.
My next thoughts were, how I should de-
fend and secure myself from savages and wild
beasts, if any such were in the island.
When I considered the ground where I was,
that it was moorish, and had no fresh water
near it, my resolutions were to search for a soil
healthy and well watered, where I might not
only be sheltered from the sun's scorching heat,
but be more conveniently situated, as well to
be secured from wild men, and beasts of prey,
as move easily to discover any distant sail,shouid
it ever so happen.
And indeed it. was not long before I had my
desire. I found a little plain near a rising hill,
the front towards which being as steep as a
house-side? nothing could descend on me from
the top.
On the side of this rock was a little hollow
place, resembling the entrance or door of a
cave. Just before this place, on the circle of
the green, I resolved my tent should stand.
This plain did not much exceed a hundred
yards broad, and about twice as long, like a
delightful green before my door, with a pleas-
ing, though irregular descent every way to the
low grounds by the sea side, sheltered from the
37
excessive heat of the sun. After this I drew
a semi-circle, containing ten yards in its semi-
diameter, and twenty yards in the whole, driv-
ing down two rows of strong stakes not six
inches from each other. Then with the pieces
of cable which I had cut on board, I regularly
laid them in the circle between the piles up to
their tops, which were more than five feet out
of the earth, and then drove another row of
piles looking within side against them, between-
two or three feet high, which made me conclude-
it a little impregnable castle For men and beasts.
And for my better security I would have no
door, but entered in and came out by the help
of a ladder, which 1 also made.
Here was my fence and fortress, into which
I carried all my riches, ammunition, and stores.
After which, working on the rock, what with
the dirt and stones I dug out, I not only raised
my ground two feet, but made a little cellar to
my mansion-house ; and this cosfme many days*
labour and pains. One day in particular a
shower of rain falling, thunder and lightning en-
sued, which put me in terror lest my powder
should take fire, and not only hinder my neces-
sary subsistence, by killing my food, but even
blow up me ^nd my habitation. To prevent
which, I fell to making boxes and bags,| inj or-
der to separate it, having by me near 150 lb,
weight. And thus being established as king of
the island, every day I went out with ray guix
38
to see what I could kill that was tit to eat. I
soon perceived numbers of goats, but very shy;
yet having watched them narrowly, and seeing
I could better shoot off the rocks than when in
the low grounds, I happened to shoot a she-goat
suckling a young kid; which not thiirfcirig
its dam slain, stood by her uconcerned; and
when I took the dead creature up, the
young one followed me even to the inclosure.
I lifted the kid over the pales, and would wil-
lingly have kept it alive, but finding it could
riot be brought to eat, I was forced to slay it
also* for my own subsistence.
Thus, entered into as strange a state as ever
any man was in, I had most melancholy appre-
hensions concerning my deplorable condition;
and many times the tears would plentifully run
down my face, when I considered how I was
debarred from all communication with human
kinciv Yet while these desponding cogitations
would seem to make me accuse Providence,
other Igood thoughts would interpose and re-
prove pe after this manner: " Weil, supposing
"you are desolate, is it not better to be so
"than totally perish? Why were you -sin-
"gle(l out to be saved, and the rest destroyed?
"'Why should you complain, when not only
"yopr life is preserved, but the ship driven in-
"to (your reach, in order to take what was ne-
*j ce&sary out of her for a subsistence?" But to
proceed: It was, by the account I kept, tjie
 
\
39
30th of September when I first landed on this
island. About twelve days after, fearing lest
I should lose my reckoning of. time, nay even
forget the sabbath days, for want of pen, ink,
and paper, I carved with a knife upon a large
post, in great letters, and set it up, in the simi-
litude of a cross, on the sea shore where I
landed, / came on shore, Sept. 30. 1659. Every
day I cut a notch with my knife on the sides of
the square post, and that on the Sabbath was
as long again as the rest, and every first day of
the month as long again as that long one. In
this manner I kept my calendar, weekly,
monthly, or yearly reckoning of time. But had
I made a more strict search (as I did after-
wards.) I need not have set up this mark.
Tor among the parcels belonging to the gun-
ner, carpenter, and captain's mate, I found
those very things I wanted; particularly pens,
ink, and paper; also I found two or three com-
passes, some mathematical instruments, dials,
perspective glasses, books of navigation, three
English bib'&s, and several other good books,
which I carefully put up. Here I cannot but
call to mind our having a dog and two cats on
board, whom I made inhabitants with me in my
castle. Though one might think I had all thfe
necessaries that were desirable, yet still I found
several tilings wanting. My ink was daily
wasting: I wanted needles, pins, thread to
mend or keep my clothes together: and partiv
C*2
40
cularly a spade, pick-ax, or shovel, to remove
the earth. It was a year before I finished my
little bulwark; and having some intervals of re-
laxation, after my daily wandering abroad for
provision, I drew up this plan alternately, as
creditor and debtor, to remind me of the mise-
ries and blessings of my life, under so many
various circumstances.
EVIL.
I am cast upon a
desolate island, having
no prospect of a wel-
come deliverance.
How miserable am I
singled out from the
enjoyment or company
of all mankind-
Like an hermit (ra-
ther should I say a
lonely anchoret) am
I forced from human
conversation.
My clothes after
some time will be worn
out, and then I shall
feave none to cover
me.
GOOD.
But yet I am pre-
served while my com-
panions are perished
in the raging sea.
Yet set apart to
be spared from death.
And He, who has so
preserved me, can de
liver me from this con-
dition.
However I have
food to eat, and even
a happy ^3rosp<jet of
subsistence whilst life
endures.
At present I enjoy
what absolutely is
needful; and the cli-
mate is so hot, that
had I never so many,
I should hardly we^r
them.;
4i
When my ammuniti-
on is wasted, then shall
I remain without any
defence pgainst wild
men and beasts.
I have no creature,
no soul to speak to;
none to beg assistance
from Some comfort
would it be to resound
my woes where I am
understood, and beg
assistance where I
might hope for relief.
Yet if it does, I see
no danger of any to
hurt me, as in Africa;
and what if I had been
cast away upon that
coast?
Is there not God to
converse to, and is not
he able to relieve thee?
already has he afforded
thee sustenance, and
put it in thy power to
provide for thyself till
he sends thee a deli*
verance.
And now easing my mind a little by these
reflections, I began to render my life as easy
as possible.
1 m»st here add to the description I have
given of my habitation, that having raised a
turf wall against the outside of it, I thatched
it so close as might keep it from the inclemency
of the weather; I also improved it within, en-
larged my cave, and made a passage and a
door in the rock, which came out beyond the
pale of my fortification. I next proceeded to
make a chair and table, and so began to study
such mechanical arts as seemed to me practi-
cable. When Ijjppmted a plank or a board, I
Jitnved down a tree with &} hatchet, making is
42
as thin with ray ax as possible, and then
smooth enough with an adze to answer my de-
signs: yet though I could make no more this
way than one board out of a tree, in length of
time I got boards enough to shelter all my
stores, every thing being regularly placed, and
my guns securely hanging against the side of a
rock. This made it a very pleasant sight to
me, being the result of vast labour and great
diligence; which leaving for a while, and me
to the enjoyment of, I shall give the reader an
account of my journal from the day of my
landing till the settling of my habitation, as
heretofore shewn.
JOURNAL.
SEPTEMBER 30th, 1659, I unhappy
Robinson Crusoe, having suffered shipwreck,
was driven on this desolate island, which I
named the Desolate Island of Despair, the rest
being swallowed up in the tempestuous ocean.
The next day I spent in consideration Vf nry
unhappy circumstances, having no prospect
but of death, either to be starved with hun-
ger, or devoured by wild beasts or merciless
savages.
Oct. 1. That morning, with great comfort, I
beheld the ship drove ashore. Some hopes I
43
1*ad, that when the storm was abated, I might
be able to get some food and necessaries out of
her; which I conceived were not damaged,
because the ship did stand upright. At this
time I lamented the loss of my companions,
and our misfortune in leaving the vessel. When
I perceived the ship as it were lie dry, I waded
through the sands, then swam aboard, the wea-
ther being very rainy, and with scarcely any
wind.
To the 14-th of this month my time was em-
ployed in making voyages every tide, getting
what 1 could out of the ship. The weather
very wet and uncertain.
Oct. 25. My raft, and all the goods thereon
were overset; yet I recovered most again at
low water.
Oct. 25. It blew hard, and rained night and
day, when the ship went in pieces, so that no-
thing was seen of her but the wreck at low wa-
ter. This day I secured my goods from the
inclemency of the weather.
Oct. 26. I wandered to see where I could
find a place convenient for my abode: I fixed
upon a rock in the evening, marked out a half
moon, intending to erect a wall fortified with
piles, lined within with pieces of cables, and
covered with turf.
Nov. 1. I erected my tent under a rock, arid
took up my lodgings very contentedly in a ham-
mock for that night-
44
Nov. 2. This day I fenced myself in with
timber, chests and boards.
Nov. 3. I shot two wild-fowl, resembling
ducks, which were good to cat, and in the af-
ternoon made me a table.
Nov. 4. I began to live regularly. In the
morning I allowed myself two or three hours
to walk out with my gun; I then worked till
near eleven o'clock; and afterwards refreshed
myself with what 1 had to eat. From twelve
to two I would lie down to sleep. Extreme
sultry weather. In the evening go to work
again.
Nov. 5. Went out with my gun and dog,
shot a wild cat with a soft skin, but her flesh
„ was good for nothing. Trie skins of those kil-
led I preserved. In my return I perceived
many wild birds, and was terrified by some
seals which made off to sea.
Nov. 6. Completed my table.
Nov. 7. Fair weather. I worked to the
y S^iW^th, kufc omitted the 11th, which according to
Any calculation, I supposed to be Sunday.
J Nov. 13. Rain in abundance, which, how-
ever, much cooled the earth, with thunder and
lightning, caused in me a terrible surprise The
weather clearing, I secured my powder in se-
parate parcels.
Nov. 14, 16. I made little boxes for my
powder, lodging them in several places. I also
45
shot a large fowl, which proved excellent
meat.
Nov. 17. I began to dig in the Tock, yet
was obliged to desist, for want of a pick ax, sho-
vel and wheel-barrow Iron crows I used to
supply the place of the first, but with ail my
art I could not make a wheel-barrow.
Nov. 19. It was my fortune to find a tree
resembling what the Brazilians call an iron tree*
I had like to have spoiled my ax with cutting
it, being very hard, and exceeding heavy; yet
with much* labour and industry I made a sort
of spade out of it.
Nov. 23, These tools being made, I daffy
carried on my business; eighteen days I allowed
for enlarging my cave, that it might serve me,
not only for a ware house but kitchen, parlour,
and cellar. I commonly lay in the tent, unless
the weather was. so rainy that I could not lie dry..
So wet would it be at certain seasons, that I
was obh'gcd to cover all within the pale with
long poles, in the form of rafters, leaning
against the rock, and load them with flags and-
large leaves of trees resembling a thatch.
Dec. 10. No sooner did I think my habita-
tion finished, but suddenly a great deal of the
top broke in, so that it was a, mercy I was not
buried in the ruins. This occasioned a great
deal of pains and trouble to me before I could
make it firm and durable.
Dec. 17. I nailed up some shelves, aiui
C3
46
drove nails and staples in the wall, and posts
to hang every thing out of the way*
Dec. 20. Every thing I got into its place,
4 X - ^en mac^e a sort °f dresser, and another table.
Dec. 24s 25. Rain in abundance.
Dec. 26. Very fair weather.
Dec. 27. I chanced to light on some goats,
shot one, wounded another; I led it home in a
string, bound up its leg, and cured it in a little
time; at length it became so tame and familiar
as to feed before the door, and follow me where
I pleased. This put me in mind to bring up
tame creatures, in order to supply me with food
after my ammunition was spent.
yJ JL-jayDec. 28, 29, 30. The weather being exees-
t$ sive hot, with little air, obliged me for the most
part to keep within doors.
Jan. 1. Still sultry. However, obliged by
necessity, I went out with my gun, and found
a great store of goats in the vdjeys; they were
exceeding shy, nor could jHEfrdog hunt them
_— down.
? ^an* to ^* emp'°yment this tim°
/ was to finish the wall before described, and
0 search the island. I discovered a kind of pi-
geons, like our house pigeons, in a nest among
the rocks. I brought them home, nursed them
till they could fly, and then they left me, Af-
J~ , $u-ter this I shot some, which proved excellent
{ \ food. Some time I spent vainly contriving to
make a cask, I may well say it wasis vain, be-
 
47
cause I could neither joint the staves, nor fix:
the heads, so as to make it tight: So leaving
that, I took some goat's tallow I had by me,
and a little oakhum for the wick, and provided
myself with a lamp, which served instead of
candles.
But now a very strange event happened. For
being in the height of my search, what should
come into my hand, but a bag which was used
to hold corn (as I supposed) for the fowls; so
immediately resolving to put gunpowder in it,
I shook all the husks and dirt upon one side of
a rock, little expecting what the consequence
would be. The rain had fallen plentifully a few
days before; and about a month after, to my
great amazement, something began to look out
very green and flourishing; and when I came
to view it more nicely, every day as it grew,
I found about ten or twelve ears of green barley
appeared in the very same shape and make as
That in England.
i can scarce express the agitation of my
mind at this sight. Hitherto I had looked
upon the actions of this life no otherwise than
only as the events of blind chance and fortune.
But now, the appearance of this barley, flou-
rishing in a barren soil, and my ignorance m
not conceiving how it should come there, made
me conclude, that miracles were not gel ceased:
nay, I even thought that God had appointed
it to grow there without any seed, purely-for
48
my sustenance in this miserable and desolate
island. And indeed such great effect had this
upon me, that it often made me melt into tears
through a grateful sense of God's mercies ; and
the greater still was my thankfulness, when I
perceived about this little field of barley, some
rice stalks, also wonderfully flourishing.
While thus pleased in mind, I concluded
there must be some more corn in the island;
and therefore made a diligent search narrowly
among the rocks.; but not being able to find
any, on a sudden it came into my mind, bow I
had shaken the husks of corn out of the bag,
and then my admiration ceased, with my grati-
tude to the divine Being, as thinking it was but
natural, and not to be conceived a miracle:
though even the manner of its preservation
might have made me own it as a wonderful
event of God's kind providence.
It was about the latter end of June when the
ears of this corn ripened, which I laid up very
Carefully, together with 20 or 30 stalks of rice,
expecting one day I should teap the fruit of
my labour; yet four years wer,e expired before
I could allow myself tp eat any barley bread,
and m uch longer time before I had any rice.
After, this with, indefatigable pains and indus-
try {hrjhvee or four months, at last I finished
lyiySik^fton the 14th of April, having JJg^vy
to go into it, but by a ladder against tlie^'ssalJ.
April 16. I finished my ladder, and ascend^
49
ed it; afterwards pulled it up, then let it clown
on the other side, and descended into my new
habitation, where I had space enough, and so
fortified-, that nothing could attack me without
scaling the tSJftfef
But what does all human art and industry
avail, if the blessing of God does not crown
our labours? Or who can stand before the Al-
mighty, when he stretcheth forth his arm? For
one time as I was at the entrance of my cave,
there happened such a dreadful earthquake,
that not only the roof of the cave came tumbling
about my ears, but the posts seemed to crack
terribly at the same time. This put me in a
great amazement - and running to the ladder,
and getting over the waft, I then plainly knew it
was an earthquake, the place I stood on sus-
taining three terrible shocks in less than three
minutes. But judge of my terror when I saw
the top of a great rock roll into the sea; I then
expected the island would be swallowed up
every moment; And what made the scene still
more dreadful, was to see the sea thrown into
the most violent agitations and disorders by this
tremendous accident.
For my part I stood like "a criminal at the
place of execution ready to expire. At the
moving of the earth, I was, as it were sea-
sick; and very much afraid lest the rock, lin-
ger which was my fence and habitation, should,
overwhelm me and it in a lasting tombP
50
When the third dreadful shock had spent
itself, my spirits began to revive; yet still I
would not venture to ascend the ladder, but
continued sitting, not knowing what I should
do. So little grace had I then, 4£'only to say,
Lord have mercy upon me I and no sooner was
the earthquake over, but that pathetic prayer
left me.
It was not long after, when a horrible tem-
pest arose, at the same time attended with a
hurricane of wind. Three hours did this storm
continue, and in so violent a manner as to tear
the very trees up by the roots, which was suc-
ceeded by abundance of rain,. When the tem-
pest was over I went to my tent; but the rain
coming on in a furious manner, I was obliged
to take shelter in the cave, where I was forced
to cut a channel through my fortification to
let the water out. It continued raining all that
night, and some time the next day. These ac-
cidents made me resolve, as soon as the wea-
ther cleared up to build me a little hut in some
open place, walled round to defend me from
wild creatures and savages; not doubting, but,
at the next earthquake, the mountain would
fall on my habitation and me, and swallow
up all in its bowels,
April 16,—c20. These days I spent in con-
triving how and in what manner I should fix
my place of abode. All this while, I was un-
der the most dreadful apprehensions. When
52
I looked round my habitation, every thing I
found in its proper place. I had several reso-
lutions whether I should move or not; but at
length resolved to stay where I was, till I
found out a convenient place where I rraght
pitch my tent.
April 22. When I began to put my resolu-
tions in practice, I was stopped for want of
tools and instruments to work with. Most of
my axes and hatchets were useless, occasioned
by cutting the hard timber that grew on the
inland. It took me up a full week to make my
grindstone of use to me; and at last I found
out a way to turn it about with my foot, by
help of a wheel and a string.
April 28 and 29. These days were spent in
grinding my tools.
April 30. My bread falling short, I allowed
myself but one biscuit a day.
May 1. As I walked along the sea shore, I
found a barrel of gunpowder, and several
pieces of the wreck which the sea had flung
up. Having secured those, I made to the ship,
whose stern was torn off, and washed a great
distance ashore; but the rest lay in the sands.
This I suppose was occasioned by the earthn
quake. 1 now resolved to keep my old place
of abode: and also to go to the ship that day,
but then found it impossible.
May 3. This day I went on board, and with
my saw sawed off one Qf the beams, which kept
52
her quarter-deck. I then cleared the sand till
flood.
v May 4. I caught some fish, but they were
not wholesome. The same day I also catched
a voting dolphin.
May 5. This day I also repaired to the
wreck, and sawed another piece of timber;
and when the flood came, I made a float of
three great planks, which were driven ashore
by the tide.
May 6, 7, 8, 9. These days I brought off
the iron bolts, opened the deck with the iron
crow, and carried two planks to land, having
tnade a way into the very middle of the wreck.
May 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. All this time 1
spent in bringing off great quantities of iron
and timber.
May 15. Took with me two hatchets on pur-
pose to cut off some lead from the roil, bat
all in vain, for it lay too low under water.
May 16. I omitted going to the wreck this
day; for employing myself in looking for pi-
geons, I outstaid my time.
May 17. I perceived several pieces of the
wreck blown ashore, which I found belonged to,
the head of the ship.
May 24. To this day I worked on the wreck,
and with great difficulty loosened some things
so much with the crow, that at the first blow-
ing tide, several casks floated out, and several
Of the, seamen's che&ts; yet that day nothing
53
came to land but pieces of timber, and a hogs-
head which had some pork in it. I continued
working to the 15th of June; (except neces-
sary times for food and rest) and had I known
how to have built a boat, I had timber and
planks enough; I had also near 100 weight of
sheet lead.
June 16. As I was wanderiug towards the
sea-side, I found a large tortoise or turtle, being
the first I had seen on the island, though, as
I afterwards found, there were many on the
other side of it.
June 17. This day I spent in cooking it,
found in her three score eggs, and her flesh
the most savory and pleasant I ever tasted in
my life.
June 18. I staid within this day, there being
a continual rain: and it was somewhat more
chilly and cold than usual.
June 19. Exceeding bad, taken with a
trembling and shivering.
June 20. Awake all night, my head racked
with pain and feverish.
June 21. Sick unto death, and terrified
with dismal apprehensions of my condition.
Prayed to God more frequently, but very con-
fusedly.
June 22. Something better, but still uneasy
in my mind.
June l~;3. Again relapsed much as before,
June 24. Mended a second time.
54
June 25. A violent ague for seven hours,
cold and hat fits, succeeded with faint sweats.
June 26. Better, but very weak; yet I
scrambled out, shot a she goat, brought it
home, and broiled some of it: I would wil-
lingly have stewed it, and made some broth,
but had no pot.
June 27. All this day I was afflicted with an
ague; thirsty, yet could not help myself to
water: Prayed to God in these words: Lord in
pity', look upon me; Lord have mercy upon me!
have mercy upon me! After this I fell asleep,
which I found had much refreshed me when I
awaked. I fell asleep a second time, and fell
into this strange and terrible sort of dream.
Methought I was sitting on the same spot,
of ground at the outside of the wall where I
sat when the storm blew after the earthquake;
and that \ saw a man descending from a great
black cloud, and light upon the ground. He
was all over bright as a flash of fire that a little
before surrounded him; his countenance in-
conceivably terrible: the earth as it were trem-
bled when he stept on the ground, and flashes
of fire seemed to fill al) the air. No sooner I
thought him landed upon the earth, but with a
long spear, or other weapon, he made towards
me; but first ascending a rising ground, his
voice added to my amazement, when I thought
I heard him pronounce these clreadful words,
Unhappy xvretch! seeing all these things have
55
not brought thee to repentance, thou shaft imme-
diately die* In pronoueing this dreadful sen-
tence, I thought he went to kill me with the
spear that was in his hand.
Any body may think it impossible for me to
express the horrors of my mind at this vision:
and even when I awaked, this very dream made
a deep impression upon my mind.
I rose up in a pensive manner, being so
thoughtful that I could not go to sleep; and
fearing the dreadful return of my distemper,
it caused me to remember, that the Brazilians
use tobacco for almost all diseases. I then
went to my chest, in order to rind some, where
heaven no doubt, directed me to find a cure
both for soul and body; for there I found one
of the bibles, which, till this time, I had nei-
ther leisure nor inclination to look into; I took
both the tobacco and that out of my chest, and
laid them on the table. Several experiments
did I try with the tobacco: First, I took a piece
of leaf, and chewed it; but it being very green
and strong almost stupified me: Next I steeped
it in some rum an hour or two, resolving when
I went to bed to take a dose of it: and, in the
third place, I burnt some over a pan of fire,
holding my nose over it so long as I could en-
dure it without suffocation.
In the intervals of this operation, though my
head was giddy and disturbed by the tobacco*
I took up the bible to read. No sooner did I
56
open it, but there appeared to me these words,
Call on me in the day of trouble^ and I will de-
liver thee and tfwit shah glorify me.
At first this sentence made a very deep im-
pression on my heart; hat it soon wore off*
again, when I considered the word deliver was
foreign to me. And as the children of Israel
said, when they were promised flesh to eat.
Can God spread a table in the wilderness? in
the like manner I began to say, Can God him-
self deliver me from this desolate island? How-
ever, the words would still return to my mind,
and afterwards made a greater impression upon
rue. As it now was very late, and the tobacco
had dozed my head, I was inclined to sleep;
but before I would lie down, I fell on my
knees, and implored the promise that God
had made to me in the holy scriptures, that if
I called on him in the day of trouble^ he tvould
deliver me. With much difficulty I after drank
the rum wherein I had steeped the tobacco,
which flying into my head, threw me into such
a profound sleep, that it was three o'clock the
next day before I awoke; or, rather, I believe,
I slept two days, having certainly lost a day in
my account, and I could never tell any other
way. When I got up, my spirits were lively
and chearful; my stomach much better, being
very hungry; and in short no fit returned the
next day, which was the 29th, but found my-»
$ elf much altered for the better.
57
* July 3. The fit quite left me, but very
weak. In this condition, I often thought of
these words, I unit deliver thee; and while at
some times I would think of the impossibility
of it, other thoughts Would reprehend me, for
disregarding the deliverances I had received,
even from the most forlorn and distressed con-
dition. I asked myself, what regard have I
had to God for his abundant mercies? Have I
done my part? He has delivered we, bid I have
not glorified him; as if I had said, 1 had not
owned and been thankful for these as deli-
verances, and how could I expect greater? So
much did this sensibly touch my hean, that I
gave God thanks for my recovery from sick-
ness in the most humble prostration.
July 4. This morning I began seriously to
ponder on what is written in the New Testa-
ment, resolving to read a chapter every morn-
ing and night as long as my thoughts would
engage me. As soon as I set about this work
seriously, I found my heart deeply affected
with the impiety of my past life; these words
that I thought were spoken to me in my dream
revived, All these things have not brought thee
to repentance. After this, I begged of God to-
assist me with his Holy Spirit in returning ta
my duty. One day, in perusing the scriptures,
I came to these words He is exalted a Prince and
a Saviour, to give repentance, and to give '-remit*
sion: Immediately I laid down the book, and,.
58
with uplifted hands to heaven, loudly cried,
0 blessed Jesus, thou son of David, Jesus, thou
exalted Prince and Saviour, give me repent-
ance: And now indeed I prayed with a true
sense of my condition, and a more certain hope,
founded on the word of God. Now I had a
different sense of these words, Call on me, and
1 xvill deliver thee, that is, from the dreadful
load of guilt, which oppressed my sinful soul,
and not from a solitary life: In a word I came
to this conclusion, that a deliverance from sin
was a much greater blessing than a deliverance
from affliction.
To the 14th of July, I walked about with my
gun, little and little at a time, having been re-
duced to the greatest extremity of weakness.
The applications and experiments I used were
perfectly new: neither could I recommend
them to any ones practice. For though it car-
ried off the fit, it very much weakened me; mid
1 had frequently convulsions in m}^ nerves and
limbs for some time. From hence I learned,
that going abroad in rainy weather, especiaUy
when it was attended with storms and hurri-
canes of wind, was most pernicious to health.
I had now been above ten months in the
island; and as I never had seen an}' of the hu-
man kind, I therefore accounted myself as sole
monarch; and as I grew better, having se-
cured my habitation to my mind, I resolved
59
to make a tour round my kingdom, In order te
make new discoveries.
The 15th of July I began my journey, I first
went to the creek, where I had brought my
rafts on shore; and travelling farther, found
the tide went no higher than two miles up,
where there was a little brook of running water,
on the bank of which were many pleasant sa-
vannahs or meadows, smooth, plain and covered
with grass. On the rising parts, where I sup-
posed the water did not reach, I perceived a
great deal of tobacco growing to a very strong
stalk. Several other plants I likewise found,
the virtues of which I did not understand. I
searched a long time for the Cassava root which
I knew the Indians in that climate made their
bread of; but all in vain. There were several
plants of aloes, though at that time I knew not
what they were; likewise I saw several sugar
canes, but imperfect for want of cultivation.
With these few discoveries I came back that
night and slept contentedly in my little castle*
The next day, being the 16th, going the
same way, but farther than the day before, I
found the country more adorned with woods
and trees. Here I perceived different fruits in
great abundance. Melons in plenty lay on the
ground, and clusters of grapes, ripe and very
rich, spread over the trees. You may imagine
I was glad of this discovery, yet ate very spar-
Ingly, lest I should throw myself into a ilux or
GO
fever. The grapes I found of excellent Use;
for when I dried them in the sun, which pre-
served them as dried raisins are kept, they
proved very wholesome and nourishing, and
served me in those seasons when no grapes were
to he had.
The night drawing on apace, I ascended
up a tree, and slept very comfortably, though
it was the first time I had slept out of my ha-
bitation. And when the morning came I pro-
ceeded with great pleasure on my way, travel-
ling about four miles, as I imagined, by the
length of the valley. At the end of this valley
I came to an opening, where the country
seemed to descend to the west; there 1 found
a spring of fresh water, proceeding out of the
side of the hill, with its crystal streams running
directly east. And indeed here my senses
were charmed with the most beautiful land-
scape nature could afford; for the country ap-
peared so flourishing, green and delightful,
that to me it seemed like a planted garden. I
then descended on the side of that delicious
vale, when I found abundance of cocoa, orange,
lemon, and citron trees, but very wild and
barren at that time. As for the limes, they
were delightful and wholesome, the juice of
which I after used to mix in water, which
made it very cool and refreshing. And now I
was resolved to carry home and lay up a store
of grapes, limes, and lemons, against the. ap~
61
poaching wet season. So laying them up in
separate parcels, and then taking a few of each
with me, I returned to my little castle, after
having spent three days in this journey. Before
I got home, the grapes were so hruised that
they were utterly spoiled; the limes indeed
were good, but of those I could bring only a
few.
July 19- Having prepared two bags, I re-
turned thither again, but to my great surprise,
found all the grapes spread about, trod to
pieces, and abundance eaten, which made me
conclude there were wild beasts thereabouts.
To prevent this happening again, I gathered
a large quantity of the grapes, and hung them
upon the out branches of the tree, both to
keep them unhurt, and that the might cure
and dry in the sun: and having well loaded
myself with limes and lemons, 1 returned once
more to my old place of residence.
And now contemplating on the fruifulness
of this valley, the pleasantness of its situation,
its security from storms, and the delightful-
ness of the adjacent woods, I concluded I
was settled in the worst part of the country,
and therefore was thinking to remove my habi-
tation.
But when I considered again, that though
it was pleasant, it was off from the sea-side,
where there was a possibility, some time or
other, a ship might either be driven or sail by;
62
and that to inclose myself among hills and
woods must certainly put an end to my hopes
of deliverance;- I resolved to let my castle re-
main where Providence had first assfgned it.
Yet so delighted was I with this place, that I
made me a little kind of bower, surrounding it
with a double hedge, as high as I could reach,
well staked and filled with bulrushes: and
having spent a great part of the month of
July, I think it was the first of August before
I began to enjoy my labour.
Aug. 3. Perceiving my grapes to be dry
I took them from the trees, and they proved
excellent good raisins of the sun: the most of
which I carried to my cave; and happy for me
I did so, by which I saved the best part of my
winter food.
Aug. 14. This day it began to rain; and
though I had made me a tent like the other,
yet having no shelter of a hill to keep me from
storms, nor a cave behind me to retreat to, I
was obliged to return to my old castle, the
rain continued more or less every day, till the
middle of October; and sometimes so violently,
that I could not stir out of my cave for several
days. This, season I found my family to in-
crease; for one of my cats that ran away from
me, and which I thought had been dead, re-
turned about August, with three kitteos at her
heels, like herself; from these cats proceeded
suqh numbers, that 1 was forced to kill and
63
destroy them as I would do wild beasts or
vermin.
To the 26th of this month, I could not stir
out, it raining incessantly; when beginning to
want food, I was compelled to venture twice,
the first of which I shot a goat, and afterwards
found a very large tortoise. The manner of
my regulating my food was thus: a bunch of
raisins served me for my breakfast; a piece of
goat's flesh or turtle boiled for my dinner, and
two or three turtle eggs for my supper. While
the rain lasted, I daily worked two or three
hours at enlarging my cave, and by degrees
worked it on towards one side of the hill, and
made a door or way out, which came beyond
my fence or wall, and so I came in and out
this way. But after I had done this, I was
troubled to see myself thus exposed; though
I could not perceive any thing to fear, u goat
being the biggest creature I had seen upon this
island.
Sept. 30. Casting up my notches on my
post, amounted to 365, I concluded this to
be the anniversary of my landing; and, there-
fore, humbly prostrating myself on the ground,
confessing my sins, acknowledging God's righ-
teous judgments upon me, and praying to Jesus
Christ to have mercy upon me, I fasted for
twelve hours till the going down of the sun;
and then eating a biscuit and a bunch of grapes,
laid me on a bed, and with great comfort took
D 2
G4
my night's repose. Till this time I never had
distinguished the Sabbath-day; but now I
made a longer notch than ordinary for the days
of rest, and divided the weeks as well as I
could, though I found I had lost a day or two
in my account. My ink failing soon after, I
omitted in my daily memorandum things of an
indifferent nature, and contented myself to
write down only the most remarkable events
of my life. The rainy and dry seasons ap-
peared now" regular to me, and experience
taught me how to provide for them; yet in
one thing I am going to relate, my experience
very much failed me. You may call to mind,
what I have mentioned of some barley and rice
which I had saved; about thirty stalks of the
former, and twenty of the latter; and, at that
time, the sun being in its southern position,
going from me, together with the rains, made
me conclude it a very proper season to sow it.
Accordingly I dug up a piece of ground, with
my wooden spade, and dividing it in two parts,
sowed about two thirds of my seed, preserving
by me a handful of each. And happy it was
I did so; for no rains falling, it was choked
up, and never appeared above the earth till
the wet season came again, and then part of
it grew, as if it had been newly sown.
I was resolved still to make another trial;
and seeking for a moister piece of ground near
my bower, I there sowed the rest of my seed
jn February, which having the rainy months
65
of March and April to water it, yielded a no-
ble crop, and sprang up very pleasantly. I
had still saved part of the seed, not daring to
venture all; and by the time I found cut the
proper seasons to sow it in, and that I might
expect every year two seed-times and two har-
vests, my stock amounted to above half a peck
of each sort of grain.
No sooner were the rains over, but the
stakes which I had cut from the trees, shot
out like willows the first year after lopping
their heads. I was ignorant of the tree I cut
them from; but they grew so regularly beau-
tiful, that they made a most lively appearance,
and so flourished in three years time, that I
resolved to cut more of them; and these soon
growing made a glorious fence, as afterwards
I shall observe.
And now I perceived that the seasons of tlie
year might generally be divided, not into sum-
mer and winter, as in Europe, but into wet
and dry seasons, as in this manner:

The wet seasons would continue longer or
shorter, as the wind would continue to blow.
But having found the ill consequences of being
abroad in the rain, I took care before hand to
furnish myself with provisions: and, during
the wet months, sat within doors as much as
possible. At this time I contrived to make
many handy things that I wanted, though it
cost me much labour and pains, before I could
accomplish them. The first I tried was to
make a basket; but all the twigs J could get,
proved so brittle, that I could not then per-
form it. It now proved of great use to me,
that when a boy, I trok great delight in stand-
ing at a basket-maker's in the same town,
where my father lived, to view them at work:
and, like other boys, curious to see the manner
of their working these things, and yery officious
to assist, I perfectly learned the method of
it, and wanted nothing but the tools. And it
coming into my mind that, the twigs of that
tree of which I made my stakes, might be ax
tough as a sallow willow, or osiers growing ir*
67
England, I resolved to make an experiment,
jind went the next day to my country seat,
and found some fit for my turn; and after cut-
ting down a quantity with my hatchet, I drkd
them in my pale, and, when fit to work with,
carried them to my cave, where I employed
myself in aiaking several sorts of baskets, in-
somuch that I could put in whatsoever I pleased.
Jt is true, they were not cleverly made, yet
they served my turn upon all occasions.
But still I wanted two necessary things. I
had no cask to hold my liquor, except two al-
most full of rum, a few bottles of an ordinary
size, and some square case bottles; neither hard
I a pot to boil any thing in, only a large kettle,
unfit to make broth, or stew a bit of meat: I
wanted likewise at the beginning of this dry
season a tobacco -pipe; but for this I afterwards
found an expedient.
I kept myself emp^ed in planting my se-
cond row of stakes. But remembering that
when I travelled up to the brook I had a mind
to see the whole island, Inow resumed my in-
tention, and taking my dog, gun, hatchet, two
biscuit cakes, a great bunch of raisins, with a
larger quantity of powder and shot than usual,
I began my journey. Having passed the vale
where my bower stood, I came within view of
the sea lying to the west; when, it being a
viear day, T fairly descried land, extending
ixani tbfcW, to the*S. W. about 10 or 15 leagues,
68
as I concluded; but could not say whether it
was an island or a continent. Neither could I
tell what this place might be; only thought it
Ayas part of America, and where I might have
been in a miserable condition had I landed.
Again I considered, that if this was the Spa-
nish coast, certainly, one time or the other, I
should see some ship pass by; and if it was not,
then it must be the savage coast, between the
Spanish country and Brazil, which abounds
with cannibals or man eaters.
As I proceeded forward, I found this side of
the island much more pleasant than mine; the
fields fragrant, adorned with sweet flowers and
^verdant grass, together with several very fine
woods. There were parrots in plenty which
made me long for one to be my companion;
Jbut it was with great difficulty I could knock
one down with my stick; and I kept him at
home some years, before I could get him to call
me by my name.
In the low grounds I found various sorts of
hares and foxes as I took them to be, but much
different from those in England. Several of
these I killed, but never ate them; neither in-
deed had I any occasion; for abounding with
goats, pigeons, turtle, and grapes, I could defy
any market to furnish me a better table. In
this journey I did not travel above two miles a
day, because I took several turns and wind-
ings, to see what discoveries I could make, re-
69
turning weary enough to the place where I de-
signed to rest all night, which was either in a
tree, or to a place which I surrounded with
stakes, that no wild creature might suddenly
surprize me. When I came to the sea-shore, I
was amazed to see the splendor of it. Its, strand
was covered with shells of the most beautiful
fish, and constantly abounding with innumerable
turtles, and fowls of many kinds, which I was
ignorant of, except those called penguins- I
might have shot as many as I pleased, but was
sparing of my ammunition, rather choosing to
kill a she-goat, which I did with much diffi-
culty, on account of the flatness of the country,.
Now, though this journey produced the most
pleasing satisfaction, yet my habitation was so
much to my liking, that I did not repine at my
being seated on the worst part of the island.
I continued my journey, travelling about twelve
miles further towards the east, where I set a
great pile on the shore for a mark, concluding^
that my next journey should bring me to the
other side of the island, east from my castle,
and so round till I came to my post again.
As I had a constant view of the country, I
thought I could not miss my wa}'; but scarce
had I travelled three miles, when I descended
into a very large valley, so surrounded with
hills covered with wood, that I having no guide
but the sun, nor even then, unless I knew well
the position of the sun at that time of the day;
70
and to add to my misfortune, the weather prov-
ing very hazy, I was obliged to return to my
post by the sea side, and so backwards the
same way I came. In this journey my dog
surprized a kid and would have killed it, had I
not prevented him. As I had often been think-
ing of getting a kid or two, and so raising a
breed of tame goats to supply me after my am-
munition was spent, I took this opportunity of
beginning: and, having made a collar for this
little creature, with a string made of rope yarn,
I brought it to my bower, and there inclosed
and left him ; and having spent a month in this
journey, at length I returned to my old habi-
tation.
Nobody can doubt of my satisfaction, when
I returned to my little castle, and reposed my-
self in my hammock. After my journey I
rested myself a week, which time I employed
in making a cage for my pretty poll. I now
began to consider of the poor kid I had left in
the bower, and I immediately went to fetch it
home. When I came there, I found the young
creature almost starved; I gave it some food,
and tied it as before: but there was no occa-
sion, for it followed me like a dog; and as I
constantly fed it, it became so' loving, gentle,
and fond, that it commenced one of my do-
mestics, and would never leave me.
The rainy season of the autumnal equinox
being now come, I kept the 30th of Septeiu-
71
ber in the most solemn manner, as usual, it
being the third year of my abode in the island.
I spent the whole day in acknowledging God's
mercies, in giving thanks for making this soli-
tary life as agreeable, and less sinful, than that
of human society; and for the communica-
tions of his grace to my soul, in supporting
comforting, and encouraging me to depend
upon his Providence, and hope for his eternal
presence in the world to come.
Indeed, I often did consider how much more
happy I was, in this state of life, than in that^
accursed manner of living I formerly used, and
sometimes when hunting, or viewing the coun-
try, the anguish of my soul would break o\x%
upon me, and my very heart would sink within
me, to think of the woods, the mountains, the
deserts I was in; and how I was a prisoner
locked up within the eternal bars and bolts of
the ocean, in an uninhabited wilderness, with-
out hopes, and without redemption. In this
condition I would often wring my hands, and
weep like a child: And even sometimes in the
middle of my work this fit would often take
me; and then I would sit down and sigh, look-
ing on the ground for an hour or two together,
till such time as rny grief got vent in a flood oif
tears.
One morning, as I was fully employed m
this manner I opened my Bible, when imme-
diately I fixed my eyes upon these words, I
'72
tvill never leave thee, nor Jbrsakc thee! Surely,
thought I, these words are directed to me, or
else why should they appear just at a moment
when I am bemoaning my forlorn condition?
and if God does not forsake me, what matters
it, since he can make me more happy in this
state of life, than if I enjoyed the greatest
splendour in the world? And whenever I
opened or shut the Bible, I blessed kind Pro-
vidence, that directed my good friend in Eng-
land to send it among my goods without my
order, and for assisting me to save it from the
|>e>wer of the raging ocean.
And now beginning my third year, my se-
veral daily employments were these: First*
My duty to Heaven, and diligently reading the
holy Scriptures, which I did twice or thrice
every day, Secondly, Seeking provisions with
my gun, which commonly took me up, when
it did not rain, three hours every morning,
Thirdly, The ordering, curing, preserving, and
cooking what I had killed, or catched for my .
fcupply, which took me up a great part of the
day; for ia the middle of the day, the sun
being in its height, it was so hot, that I could
not stir out; so that I had but four hours in
the evening to work in: and then the want of
tools, of assistance, and- skill, wasted a great
deal of time to little purpose, I was no less
than two and forty days making a board fit for
a long shelf, which two sawyers, with their took
73
and saw-pit, would have cut out 6f the same
tree in half a day. It was of a large tree, as
ray board was to be broad. I was three dayg
in cutting it down, and two more in lopping
off the boughs, and reducing it to a piece of
timber. Thus I hacked and hewed off each
side, till it became light to move; then I turn*
ed it, made one side of it smooth and flat as a
board from end to end, then turned it dowm*
ward, cutting the other side, till I brought the
plank to be about three inches thick, and smooth
on both sides. Any body may judge my great
labour and fatigue in such a piece of work;
but this I went through with patience, as also
many other things that my circumstances made
necessary for to do."
The harvest iPonths, November and Decem-
ber, were now at hand, in which I had the
pleasing proipeet of a very good crop. But
here I met with a new misfortune; for the goats
and hares, having tasted of the sweetness of
the blade, kept it so short that it had - no
strength to shoot up into a stalk. To prevent
this, I enclosed it with a hedge, and by day
shot some of its devourgrs; and my dog which
I had tied to the field-gate keeping barking all
night, so frightened these creatures that I got
entirely rid of them.
But, no sooner did I get rid of these, than
other enemies appeared, to wit, whole flocks of
several sorts of birds, who only waited till my
£
 
74
back was turned, to ruin me. So much did
this provoke me, that 1 let fly, and killed three
of the malefactors ; and afterwards served them
as they do notorious thieves in England, hung
them up in chains as a terror to others. And,
indeed, so good an effect had this, that they
not only forsook the corn, but all that part of
•the island, so long as these criminals hung
there.
My corn having ripened apace, the latter end
of December, which was my second harvest, I
reaped it with a scythe, made of one of my
broad swords. I had no fatigue in cutting
down my first crop, it was so slender. The
fears I carried home in a basket, rubbing it out
with my hands, instead of freshing it; and
when my harvest was over, found my half peck
of seed produced near two burets of rice,
and two bushels and a half of barley. And
now I plainly foresaw, that, by God's good-
ness, I should be furnished with bread; but
yet I was concerned, because I knew not how
to grind or make meal of my corn, nor bread,
neither knew how to bake it. I would not,
however, taste any of the crop, but resolved
to preserve it against next season, and, in the
mean while, use my best endeavours to provide
myself with other food.
But where were my labours to end? the want
of a plough to turn up the earth, or shovel to
dig it, I conquered by making me a wooden
 
PAGE 75
75
spade. The want of a harrow I supplied my-
self, with dragging over the corn a great bough
of a tree. When it was growing, 1 was forced
to fence it; when ripe, to mow it, carry it
home, thresh it, part it from the chaff, and
save it. And, after all, I wanted a mill to
grind it, sieve to dress it, yeast and salt to
make it into bread, an oven to bake it. This
set my brains to work to find some expedient
for every one of these necessaries against the
next harvest.
And now having more seed, my first care was
to prepare me more land. I pitched upon two
large flat pieces of ground near my castle, for
that purpose, in which I sowed my seed, and
fenced it with a good hedge. This trok me up
three months: by which time the wet season
coming on, and the rain keeping me within
doors, I found several occasions to employ my-
self; and, while at work, used to divert myself
with talking to my parrot, teaching him to know
and speak his own name Poll> the first welcome 1
word I ever heard spoke in the island. I had
been a long time contriving how to make
earthen vessels, which I wanted extremely;
and when I considered the heat of the climate,
I did not doubt but if I could rind any such
clay, I might botch up a pot, strong enough,
when dried in the sun, to bear handling, and to
hold any thing that was dry, as corn, meal,
and other things.
E 2
76
To be short, the clay I found; hat it would
occasion the most serious person to smile, to
see what awkward ways I took, and what ugly
mishapen things I made; how many either fell
out or cracked by the violent heat of the sun,
and fell in pieces when they were removed; so
that I think it was two months before I could
perfect any thing; and even then but two
clumsy things in imitation of earthen jars.
These, however, I very gently placed in wicker
baskets, made on purpose for them, and be-
tween the pot and the baskets, stuffed it full of
rice and barley straw; and these, I presumed
would hold my dried corn, and perhaps the
tneal, when the corn was bruised. As for the
smaller things, I made them with better suc-
cess; such as little round pots, flat dishes,
pitchers, and pipkins, the sun baking thern
very hard.
Yet still I wanted one thing absolutely neces-
sary, and that was an earthen pot, not only to
hold my liquid, but also to bear the fire, which
none of these could do. It once happened,
that as I was putting out my fire, I found
therein a broken piece of one of my vessels
burnt hard as a rock, and red as a tile. This
made me think of burning some pots; and
having no notion of a kiln, or of glazing'them
with lead, I fixed three large pipkins, and two
or three pots in a pile one upon another. The
fire I piled round the outside, and dry wood on
the top, till I saw the pots in the inside red-
hot, and found that they did not crack at all i
a*ul when I perceived them perfectly red, I Jet
one of ihem stand in the fire about five or six
houvs* till the clay inched by the extremity of
the heat, and would have run to glass had I
suffered it; upon which I slacked my fire by de-
grees, till the redness abated; and watching,
tbem till the morning, I found I had three very
good pipkins, and two earthen pots, as well
burnt and fit for my turn as J could desire.
The next concern I had was to get me a stone-
mortar to beat some corn in, instead of a mill
to grind it. Here indeed I was at a great loss*
as not being fit for a stone-cutter; and many
days 1 spent to find out a great stone big enough
to cut hollow and make fit for a mortar, and
strong enough to bear the weight of a pestily
that would break the corn without filling it with
sand. But all the stones of the island being
of a mouldering nature, rendered my Search
fruitless; and then I resolved to look out*a
great block of hard wood ; which having found*
I formed it with my axe and hammer, and then
with infinite labour made a hollow in it, just as
the Indians of Brazil make their canoes. When
I had finished this, I made a great pestil of
tromvood, and then laid them up against my
succeeding harvest.
My next business was to make me a sieve, ta
sift my meal and part it from the bran aixdbusk*
78
Having no fine thin canvas to search the meal
through, I could not tell what to do. What
linen 1 had was reduced to rags; I had goat's
hair enough, but neither tools to work it, nor
did I know how to spin it. At length I remem-
bered I had some neck-cloths of callico or
muslin of the sailors, which I had brought out
of the ship, and with these I made three small
sieves proper enough for the work,
I come now to consider the baking part.
The want of an oven I supplied by making
some earthen pans very broad, but not deep.
When I had a mind to bake, I made a great
fire upon my hearth, the tiles of which I had
made myself; and when the wood was burnt
into live coals, I spread them over it, till it be-
came very hot; then sweeping them away, I
set down my loaves, and whelming down the
earthen pots upon them, drew the ashes and
coals ail around the outsides of the pots to con-
tinue the heat; and in this manner I baked my
barley loaves, as well as if I had been a com-
plete pastry-cook, and also made of the rice
several cakes and puddings.
It is no wonder that all these things took me
up the best part of a year, since what inter-
mediate time I had, was bestowed in managing
my new harvest, and husbandry; for in the
proper season I reaped my corn, carried it
home, and laid it up in the ear in my large
baskets, till I had time to rub, instead of
79
threshing it. And now indeed my com en-
creased so much, that it produced me twenty
bushels of barley, and as much of rice, that I
not only began to use it freely, but was think-
ing how to enlarge my barns, and resolved to
sow as much at a time as would be sufficient for
a whole year.
All this while, the prospect of land, which I
had seen from the other side of the island, ran
in my mind. I still meditated a deliverance
from this place, though the fear of greater mis-
fortunes might have deterred me from it. For
allowing that I had attained that place, I raii
the hazard of being killed and eaten by the
devouring cannibals; and if they were not so,
yet I might be slain, as other Europeans had
been, who fell into their hands. Notwith-
standing all this, my thoughts ran continually
upon that shore. I now wished for the long
boat with the shoulder of mutton sail. I went
to the ship's boat, that had been cast a great
way on the shore in the late storm. She was
removed but a little; but her bottom being
turned up by the impetuosity and surge of the
waves and wind, I fell to work with all the
strength I had, and with levers and rollers I
had cut from the wood, to turn her, and repair
the damages she had sustained. This work
took me up three or four weeks, when finding
my little strength all in vatin^ I fell to under-
mining it by digging away the sand, an<d §o to
80
tnake it fall down, setting pieces of wood to
thrust and guide it in the fall. But after this
was done, I was still unable to stir it up, or to
get under it, much less to move it forwards
towards the water, and so I was forced to give
it over.
This disappointment, however, did not frighten
\e. I began to think, whether it was not pos-
sible for me to make a canoe or Perigua, such
as the Indians make of the trunk of a tree.
But here I lay under particular inconveniences;
want of tools to make it, and want of hands to
move it into the water when it was made. How-
ever, to work I went upon it, stopping all the
enquiries I could make with this very simple
answer I made to myself, let's first make it,
I'll warrant I'll find some way or other to get
it along when it is done.
I first cut down a cedar tree, which was five
feet ten inches diameter at the lower part next
the stump, and four feet eleven inches diameter
at the end of twenty-two feet, after which it
lessened for a space, and then parted into
branches. Twenty days was I hacking and
hewing it at the bottom, fourteen more in
cutting off the branches and limbs, and a
whole month in shaping it like the bottom of
a boat. As for the inside, I was three weeks
with a mallet and chissel, clearing it in such
a manner, as that it was big enough to carry
26 rneri, much bigger than any canoe I ever
SI
yaw in my life, and consequently sufficient ta
transport me and all my effects to that wished
for shore I so ardently desired.
Nothing- remained now, but, indeed, the
greatest difficulty, to get it into the water, it
tying about 100 yards from it. To remedy the
first inconvenience, which was a rising hill be-
tween this boat and the creek, with wonderful
pains and labour I dug into the surface of the
earth, and made a declivity*. But when this
was done, all the strength I 1il4 was as insuf-
ficient to move it, as it was when I attempted
to more the boat, I then proceeded to mea-
sure the distance of ground, resolving to make
a canal, in order to bring the water to the ca-
noe, since I could not bring the canoe to the
water. But as this seemed to be impracticable
to myself alone, under the space of eleven or
twelve years, it brought me into some sort of
consideration : so that I concluded this also to
|>e impossible, and the attempt vain. I now
s,aw, and not before, what stupidity it is ta
i>egin work before we reckon its costs, or judge
rightly our own abilities to go through with it$
performance.
in the height of this work my fourth year ex«*
pired from the time I was cast on this island*
At this time I did not forget my anniversary;
but kept it with rather greater devotion than
!>efore. For now my hopes being frustrated* I s
ooked upon this world as a %Mug 1 had nothing'
ES
82
to do with; and very well might I say, as fa-
ther Abraham said unto Dives, Between, me,
and thee there is a gulph fixed. And indeed I
was separated ftom its wickedness too, having
neither the lust of the flesh, the lust of the
eye, nor the pride of life; I had nothing to
covet, being lord, king and ernperor over the
whole country I had in possession, without
dispute and without contronl: I had loadings
of corn, plenty pf turtles, t-Hnber in abund-
ance, and grapes above measure. What was
all the rest to me? the money I had, lay by me
as despicable dross, which I would freely have
given for a gross of tobacco pipes or a hand-
mill to grind my corn: in a word, the nature
and experience of these things dictated to me
this just reflection, That the good things of
this world are no further good to us, than they
are for our use; and that whatever we may
heap up to give others, we can but enjoy as
much as we use, and no more.
These thoughts rendered my mind more easy
than usual. Every time I sat down to meat, E
did it with thankfulness, admiring the provi-
dential hand of God, who in this wilderness
had spread a table to me. And now I con-
sidered what I enjoyed, rather than what I
wanted, compared my present condition with
what 1 at first expected it should be; how I
should have done, if I had got nothing out of
the ship; that I must1 have perished before I
83
had caught fish or turtles; or lived, had I
found them like a mere savage, by eating them
raw, and pulling them to pieces with my claws*
like a beast. I next compared my station to
that which I deserved: how undutiful I had
been to my parents; how destitute of the fear
of God; how void of every thing that was
good; and how ungrateful for those abtuMjant
mercies I had received from heaven, being fed,
as it were, by a miracle, even as great as
Elijah's being fed by ravens; and cast on a
place where there.are no venemous creatures to
poison or devour me; in short, making God s
tender mercies matter of great consolation, I
relinquished all sadness, and gave way to con-
tentment.
As long as my ink continued, which with wa-
ter I made last as long as I could, I used to mi-
nute down the days of the month on which any
remarkable thing happened.
The next thing that wasted after my ink, was
the biscuit, which I had brought out of the ship;
and though I allowed myself but one cake a day
for above a twelvemonth, yet I was quite out
of bread for near a year, before I got any com
of my own.
In the next place, my clothes began to $e-
cay, and my linen had been gone long befbf ft
However, I had preserved .about three do&&i
of the sailors chequered shirts which proved a
great refreshment to me, when the violent
 
84*
Beams of the sun would not suffer me to bear
any of the seamen's heavy watch-coats; which
made me turn tailor, and, after a miserable
botching manner, convert them to jackets. To
preserve my head, I made a cap of goatskins,
with the hair outwards to keep out the rain;
which indeed served me so well, that after-
wards I made a waistcoat and open-kneed
breeches of the same: And then I contrived
a sort of an umbrella, covering it with skins,
which not only kept out the heat of the sun,
but the rain also. Thus being easy and settled
in my mind, my chief happiness was to con-
verse with God, in most heavenly and com-
fortable ejaculations.
For five years after this, I cannot say any ex-
traordinary thing occurred to me. My chief
employment was to cure my raisins, and plant
my barley and rice, of both which I had a
year's provision before-hand. But though I
was disappointed in my first canoe, I made it,
at intermediate times, my business to make a
second of much inferior size; and it was two
years before I had finished it. But as 1 per-
ceived it would in no wise answer my design of
sailing to the other shore, my thoughts were
confined to take a tour round the island, to see
tyhat further discoveries I could make. To
this intent, after having moved her to the wa-
ter, and tried how she would sail, I fitted up
m little mast to my boat, and made a sail of the
$5
ship's sails that lay by me. I then made lock-
ers or boxes at the end of it to put in neces-
saries, provision and ammunition, which would
preserve them dry either from the rain, or the
spray of the sea; and in the inside of the
boat, I cut me a long hollow place to lay my
gun, and to keep it dry made a flag to hang
over it. My Umbrella 1 fixed in a step in the
stern, like a mast, to keep the heat of the sun
ofF me. And now resolving to see the circum-
ference of my little kingdom, I victualled my
ship for the voyage, putting in two dozen of my
barley bread loaves, an earthen pot full of
parched rice, a little bottle of rum, half d
goat, powder and shot, and two watch coats.
It was the 6th of November, in the 6th year
of my reign, or captivity, that I set out in this
voyage; which was much longer than I ex-
pected, being obliged to put farther out, by
reason of the rocks that lay a great way in the
sea.
And indeed so much did these rocks vsurprise
me, that 1 was for putting back, fearing that
if I ventured farther, it would be out of my
power to return : in this uncertainty I came to
anchor just off the shore, to which I waded
with my gun on my shoulder, and then clinib^
ing up a hill, which over-looked that poipfc^ fc
saw the full extent of it and so resolved "to
all hazards,
86
In this prospect from the hill I perceived a
Violent current running to the east, coming
very close to the point; which I the mor ^\ve-
fully observed, thinking it dangerous, and that
when I came to, it, I might be drove into the
§ea by its force, and not able to return to the
island: and certainly it must have been so,
had I not made this observation; for on the
other side was the like current, with this dif-
ference, that it set off at a greater distance;
and I perceived there was a strong eddy under
the land; so that my chief business was to
work out of the first current, and conveniently
get into the eddy. Two days I staid here-
the wind blowing very briskly E. S. E. whicn
being contrary to the current, leaves a great
breach of the sea upon the point; so it was
neither fit for me to keep too near the shore,
on account of the breach; nor stand at too
great a distance for fear of the streams. That
night the wind abating, it grew so calm, that
I ventured out; and here I may be a monu-
ment to all rash and ignorant pilots: for I
was no sooner come to the point, and not
above the boat's length from shore, but I was
got into a deep water, with a current like a
mill, which drove my boat along so violently,
that it was impossible for me to keep near the
edge of it, but forced me more and more out
from the eddy to the left of me; and all I
 
87
#)nld do with my paJdlers was useless, there
Jfeing no wind to help me,
Now I began to look upon myself as quite
Tost, since, as the current ran on both sides o£
€i<2 island, I was very certain they must join
*£am, ai>d then I had no hopes but of perish-
ing for want in the sea, after what provision I
had was spent, or before, if a storm shoulpt
happen to arise.
Who can conceive the present anguish of
ary mind at tins calamity? with longing eyes
did I look upon my little kingdom, and thought
the island the pleasantest place in the uni-
verse. Happy, thrice happy desert, said I,
shall I never see thee more? Wretched creaT
ture! whither am I going? Why did I rqurl
mm at my lonesome condition-, when now I
w^uld give the whole wofld to be thither
again? While I was thus" complaining, I
found myself to be driven about two leagues
ilito the sea: however, I laboured till my
strength was far spent, to keep my boat as far
niorth as possibly I could, to that side ©f the
current where the eddy lay on. About n$ol|
I perceived a little breeze of wind spring up
from the S. S. E. which overjoyed my heart*
andjfl was still more elated, when, in about
half an hour, it blew a gentle fine gale. Ha^l
my thick weather sprung up, I had been lost
another way: for having no compass on board]
1 should never have found the way to stcej;
88
towards the island, if once it had disappeared!;
but it proving the contrary, I set up my mast
again, spread my sail, and stood away north-
ward, as much as I could, to get rid of the
current. And no sooner did the boat begin
to stretch away, but I perceived, by the clear-
ness of the water, a change of the current was
near; for, where it was strong, the water was
foul; and where it was clear, the current
abated.
They who have experienced what it is to be
reprieved upon the ladder, or to be saved from
thieves, just going to take away their lives, or
^uch as have been in the like calamities with
my own, may guess my present excess of joy,
how heartily I ran my boat in the stream of
thi§ eddy, and how joyfully I spread my sail
to the refreshing wind, standing cheerfully be-
fore it, with a smart tide under foot. By the
assistance of this eddy, I was carried above
"league home again, when, being in the wake
of the island, betwixt the two currents, ^!
found the water to be in a sort of a stand.
||ftbout four o'clock in the afternoon, I reached
Vwithin a league of the island, and perceived
the points of the rock, which caused th^dis-
aster, stretching out, asl observed before^ to
tfhe southward, which throwing off the current
more southwardly, had occasioned another
eddy to the north. But having a. fair brisk
gale I stretched across this. eddyK and in an
89
hour came within a mile of the shore, where I
soon landed to my unspeakable comfort; and
after an humble prostration, thanking God for
my deliverance, with a resolution to lay all
thoughts of escaping aside, I brought my boat
safe to a little cove, and laid me down to take
a welcome repose. When I awoke, I was con-
sidering how I might get my boat home; and
coasting along the shore I came.to a good bay,
which ran up to a rivulet or brook, where,
finding a safe harbour, I stowed her as safe as
if she had been ift-a dry dock made on purpose
for her.
I now perceived myself not far from the
place where before I had travelled on foot; so-
taking nothing with me, except my gun and
umbrella, I began my journey, and in the
evening came to my bower, where I again laid
me down to rest. I had not slept long before
I wakened in great surprize, by a strange
voice that called me several times, Robins
Robin, Robinson Crusoe, poor Robin! Where
are you, Robinson Crusoe f Where are you?
Where have you been?
So fast was I asleep, at first that I did not
awake thoroughly; but half asleep and half
awakej! thought I dreamed that somebody
spoke To me. But as the voice repeated
Robinson Crusoe several times, being terribly
alFrightened, I started up in the utmost con-
cision; and, no sooner were my eyes fully*
90
€>pen, but I beheld my pretty poll sitting oft
the top of the hedge, and soon knew that it
was he that called me; for just in such be-
wailing language I used to talk and teach
him; which he so exactly learned, that he
would sit upon my finger, and lay his bill
close to my face, and cry, Poor Robinson
Crusoe, tvhere are you? where have you been?
how came you here? and such like prattle I
had constantly taught him. But even though
I knew it to be the parrot, it was a great time
before I could adjust myself; being amazed
how the creature got thither, and that he
should fix about that place, and no where else,
But now, being assured it could be no other
than my honest Poll, my wonder ceased, and
reaching out my hand, and calling familiarly
Poll, the creature came to me, and perched
upon my thumb, as he was wont, constantly
prating to me with Poor Robinson Crusoe, and
how did I come herey and tvliere had 1 been?
as if the bird was overjoyed to see me; and
so I took him home along with me. I was
now pretty well cured of my rambling to sea;
yet I could wish my boat, which had cost me
so much trouble and pains, on this side the
island once more, but which indeed was im-
practicable. I therefore began to leaR* very
retired life, living near a twelvemonth in a very
contented manner, wanting for nothing bu|
conversation. As to mechanic labours, whidji
91
nty necessities obliged me to, I fancied I could,
upon occasion, make a tolerable carpenter,
were the poor tools I had to work withal but
good- Besides as I improved in my earthen
ware, I contrived,to make them with a wheel,
which I found much easier and better, making
my work shapely, which before was rude and
w£ly. But, I think I was never so elevated
with my own performance or project, than for
being able to make a tobacco pipe, which,
though it proved an awkard clumsy thing, yet
it was very sound,- and carried the smoke per-
fectly well, to my great satisfaction.
1 also improved ray wicker ware, made me
abundance of necessary baskets, which, thougfo
not very handsome, are very handy and eon*
venient to fetch things home in, as also for
hqlding my stores, barley, vice, and other pr§*
visions.
My powder beginning to fail, made me
examine after what manner I should kill the
goats or birds to live on after it was all gone.
Upon which I contrived many ways to ensnare
the goats, and see if I could cateh them alive,
frticularly a she-goat with young, >
At last I had my desire; for, making pit-
fklls an^ traps baked with barley and rice, I
tfound, one morning, in one of them, an oi& he-
|oat, anHin the other three kids, tme male,
e other two females. <
So boisterous was the old one, that I could
92
not bring him away. But I forgot the old
proverb, That hunger voill tame a lion: For,
had I kept him three or four days without
provisions, and then given him some water,
with a little corn, he would have been as tame
as a young kid. The other creatures I bound
with strings together; but I had great diffi-
culty before I could bring them to my habi-
tation. It was some time before they would
feed; but, throwing them sweet corn, it so
much tempted them, that they began to be
tamer. From hence I concluded, that if I
designed to furnish myself with goat's flesh,
when my ammunition was spent, the tamely
^||peeding them up, like a flock of sheep, about
riiy settlement, was the only method I could
take. I concluded also I must separate tfas
wild from the tame, or else they would"always
run wild as they grew up; and the best way
for this, was to have some inclosed piece of
ground, well fenced, either with a hedge or
pale, to keep them so effectually, that those
within might not break out, or those without
break in. Such an undertaking was ve^y
great for one pair of hands; but as there w&s
an absolute necessity for doing it, my fir^t
care was to find a convenient piece of^grouncl
where there was likely to be herbage for thera
to eat, water to drink, and cover to Ijiep then*
from th#sun, 1
93
f
Here again I gave another instance of my
ignorance and inexperience, pitching upon sl
piece of meadow land so large, that had I
enclosed it, the hedge or pale must have been
zx least two miles about. This thought came
into my head, after I had carried it on, I be-
lieve, about fifty yards: I therefore altered
Biy scheme and resolved to inclose a piece of
ground about 150 yards in length, and 100 in
breadth, sufficient enough for as many as would
xnaintain me, till such time as my flock in-
creased and then I could add more ground.
I now vigorously prosecuted my work, and it
took me about three months in hedging the
first piece; in which time I tethered the three .
kids in the best part of it; feeding them 3
near me as possible, to make them familiar:
and indeed I very often would carry sonjie
•ears of barley or a handful of rice, and feed
them out of my hand; by which they grew so
tame, that when my inclosure was finished,
and I had let them loose, they would run after
me for a handful of corn. This indeed an-
swered my end i and in a year and a half's
time I had a flock of about twelve goats, kids
and all; and in two years after, they amounted
to forty-three, besides what I had taken* and
killed for my sustenance.
After which I inclosed five several pieces of ^
ground to feed them with pens to drive^
94?
them into, that I might take them as I had
-occasion.
In this project I likewise found additional
blessings; for I not only had plenty of goat*s
flesh, but milk too, which in my beginning, [
did not so much as think of. And, indeed,
though 1 had never milked a cowymuch lea
a goat, or seen butter or cheese made, yet,
after some essays and miscarriages, I made me
both, and never afterwards wanted.
How mercifully can the Almighty comfort
his creatures, even in the midst of their greatest
calamities? How can he sweeten the bitterest
evils, and give us reason to magnify him in
dungeons and prisons; what a bounteous table
was here spread in a wilderness for me. when)
I expected nothing at first but to perish foi
hunger?
Certainly any one would have smiled to see
ltie at dinner. There sat my royal majesty,
an absolute prince and ruler of my kingdom,
attended by my dutiful subjects, whom if I
•pleased, I could either hang, draw, quarter,
giv0 them liberty, or take it away. When I
dined, I seemed a king, eating alone, none
daring to presume to do so till I had done.
Poll, as if he had been my principal court fa-
vourite, was the only person permitted to talk
with me. My.old but faithful dog, 410 w grown
exceeding crazy, continually sat on my righc
hand; while my two cats sat on-each side 0/
the table, expecting \\ bit from my hand, as a
95
principal mark of my royal favour. These were
not the cats I had brought from the ship ; they
had been dead long before, and interred near
my habitation by mine own hand. But a
couple of their young I had made tame; the
rest run wild into the woods, and in time grew
so impudent as to return and plunder me of
my stores, till such time as I shot a great
many, and the rest left me without troubling
me any more. In this plentiful manner did I
live, wanting for nothing but conversation.
One thing indeed concerned me, the ivant of
my boat: I knew not which way to get her
round the island. One time I resolved to go
along the shore by land to her; but had any
one at home met such a figure, it would either
have affrighted them, or made them burst into
laughter; nay, I could not but smile myself
at my liabit, which I think in this place will
be very proper to describe.
The cap I wore upon my head, was great,
high, and shapeless, made of a goat's skin,
with a flap or pent-house hanging down be-
hind, not only to keep the sun from me, but
to shoot the rain off from running into my
neck, nothing being more pernicious than the
rain falling upon the flesh in these climates.
I had a short jacket of goat's skin, whose hair
hung down such a length on each side, that it
reached down to the calves of my legs. As
for shoes and stockings,' I had none, but made
96
a resemblance of something, I knew not what,
to call them; they were made like buskins,
and laced on the sides like spatterdashes, bar-
barously shaped like the rest of my habit. I
had a broad belt of goat's skin dried, girt
round me with a couple of thongs, instead of
buckles; on each of which, to supply the
deficiency of sword and dagger, hung my
hatchet and saw. I had another belt, not so
broad, yet fastened in the same manner, which
hung over my shoulder, and at the end of it,
under my left arm, hung two pouches, made
of goat's skin, to hold my powder and shot.
My basket I carried on my back, and my gun
on my shoulder; and over my head a great-
clumsy ugly goat's skin umbrella, which, how-
ever next to my gun, was the most necessary
thing about me. As for my face, the colour
was not so swarthy as the Mulattoes, or as
might have been expected from one who took
so lit tie care of it, in a climate within nine or
ten degrees of the Line. At one time my
beard grew so long that it hung down above
a quarter of a yard; but as I had both razors
and scissars in store, I cut it all off, and suf-
fered none to grow, except a large pair of
Mahometan whiskers, the like of which I had
seen worn by some Turks at Salee, not long
enough indeed to hang a hat upon, but of such
a monstrous size, as would have amazed any ii&
England to have seen.
97
But all this was of no consequence here,
there being none to observe my behaviour or
habit. And so, without fear and without con-
trol, I proceeded on my journey, the prosecu-
tion of which took me up five or six days. I
first travelled along the sea shore, directly to
the place where I first brought my boat to an
anchor, to get upon the rocks; but now hav-
ing no boat to take care of, I went over-land
a nearer way to the same height that I was
before upon ; when looking forward to the point
of the rock, which lay out, and which I was
forced to double with my boat, I was amazed
to see the sea so smooth and quiet, there being
no ripling motion, nor current, any more than
in other places. And now I was convinced,
that by observing ebbing and flowing of the
tide, I might easily bring my boat round the
island again. But when I began to think of
putting it in practice, the remembrance of the
late danger struck me with such horror, that I
changed my resolution, though more labo-
rious; and this was to make another canoe,
and so have one for one side of the island, and
one for the other.
I had now two plantations in the island; the
first my little fortification, fort, or castle, with
many large and spacious improvements: for
by this time I had enlarged the cave behind
nie with several little c.ives, one within ano-
ther, to hold my baskets, corn, and straw*
V
98
The piles with which I made ray wall were
grown so lofty and great as obscured my habi-
tation. And near this commodious and plea-
sant settlement, lay my well cultivated- and
improved corn fields, which kindly yielded me
their fruit in the proper season. My second
plantation was that near my country-seat, or
little bower, where my grapes flourished, and
where, having planted my stakes, I made in-
closures for my goats, so strongly fortified by
labour and tine, that it was much stronger
than a wall, and consequently impossible for
them to break through. As for my bower
itself, I kept it constantly in repair, and cut
the trees in such a manner, as made them
grow wild, and form a most delightful shade.
In the centre of this, stood my tent, thus
erected. I had driven four piles in the ground,
spreading over it a piece of the ship's sail;
beneath which I made me a sort of a couch
with the skins of the creatures I had slain, and
Hither things; and having laid thereon one of
the sailor's blankets, which I had saved from
the wreck of the ship, and covering myself
with a great watch coat, I took up this pkice
for my country'retreat.
Very frequently from this settlemsnt did I
use to visit my boat, and keep her in very good
order. And sometimes would I venture in her
a cast or two from shore, but no farther. But
now I intreat your attention, whilst I proceed
 
PAGE 99
99
to inform you of a new, but most surprising
scene of life which here befel me.
You may easily suppose, that, after having
been here so long, nothing could be more
amazing than to see a human creature. One
day it happened, that going to my boat, I saw
the print of a man's naked foot on the shore,
very evident on the sand, as the toes, heels,
and every part of it. Had I seen an appari-
tion, in the most frightful shape, I could not
have been more confounded. My willing ears
gave the strictest attention. I cast my eye§.
around, but could satisfy neither the one or
the other I proceeded alternately to every
part of the shore, but with equal effect; neither
could I see any other mark, though the sand
about it was as susceptible to take impression,
as that which was so plainly stamped. Thus,
struck with confusion and horror, I returned
to my habitation, frightened at every bush and
tree, taking every thing for men; and pos-
sessed with the wildest ideas! That night
my eyes never closed. I formed nothing but
the most dismal imaginations. In a word, all
my religious hopes vanished, as though I
thought God would not now protect me by his
power, who had so wonderfully preserved me so
long.
What various chains of events are there in
the life of man? How changeable are our affec-
tions, according to different circumstances?
I od
We love to day, what we hate to-morrow; we
shun one hour, what we seek the next. This
was evident in me in the most conspicuous
manner: For I, who before had so much la-
mented my condition, in being'banished from
all human-kind, was now ready to expire,
when I considered that a man had set his foot
on this desolate island. But when I considered
my station of life, decreed by the infinitely
wise and good providence of God, that I ought
nbt to dispute my Creator's sovereignty, who
had an undoubted right to govern and dispose
of his creatures as he thinks convenient; and
that his justice and mercy could either punish
or deliver me: I say, when I considered all
this, I comfortably found it my duty to trust
sincerely in him, pray ardently to him, and
humbly resign myself to his divine will.
One morning, lying on my bed, these words
of the sacred writings came into my mind,
Call upon me in the day of troubleand I will
deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me* Upon
this sentence rising more chearfully from my
bed, I offered up my prayers in the most hea-
venly manner: and when I had done, taking
up my Bible to read, these words appeared
first in my sight: Wait on the Lord) and be of
good cheer, and he shall strengthen thy heart:
Wait, I say, on the Lord, Such divine com-
fort did this give me, as to remove all cause of
sadness upon that occasion.
101
Thus, after a world of apprehensions and
fears, for three days and nights, I at last Ven-
tured out of my castle, and milked my goats,
one of which was almost spoiled for want of it.
I next, (though in great fear) visited my
bower, and milked my flocks there also ; when,
growing bolder, I went down to the shore
again, and measuring the print of the foot to
mine, to see perhaps whether I myself had not
occasioned that mark, I found it much supe-
rior in largeness; and so returned home, ab*
solutely convinced, that either some men had
been ashore, or that the island must be inha-
bited; and therefore that I might be surprised
before I was aware.
1 now began to think of providing for my se-
curity, and revolved in my mind many diiferent
schemes for that purpose. I first proposed to
cut down my inclosures, and turn my tame
cattle wild into the woods, that the enemy
might not find them, and frequent the island
in hopes of killing the same, Secondly, I was
for digging up my corn-fields for the very same
reason, And, lastly, I concluded to demolish
my bower, lest, seeing a place of human con-
trivance, they might come farther, and find
out and attack me in my castle.
Such notions did the fear of danger suggest
to me; and I looked I thought like the unfor-
tunate king Saul, when not only oppressed by
the Philistines, but also forsaken by God him-
F3
102
self. And it is strange, that a little, before
having entirely resigned myself to the will of
God, I should now have little confidence in
him, fearing those more who could kill this
fading body, than him who could destroy my
immortal soul.
Sleep was an utter stranger to my eyes that
night; yet nature, Spent and tired, sub milted
iq a silent repose the next morning, and then
|oining reason with fear, I considered, that
this delightful and pleasant island might not be
so entirely forsaken as I might think ; but that
the inhabitants from the other shore might sail,
either with design, or from necessity, by cross
winds; and, if the latter circumstance, I had
reason to believe they would depart the first
opportunity. However, my fear made me
think of a place of retreat upon an attack.
J now repented that I had made my door to
come out beyond my fortification; to remedy
which, I resolved to make me a second one;
I fell to work, therefore, and drove betwixt
that double row of trees, which I planted above
twelve years before, several strong piles, thick-
ening it with pieces of timber and old cables,
and strengthening the foot of it with earth
which I dug out of my cave; I also made me
seven holes, wherein I planted my muskets
like cannon, fitting them into frames resembling
carriages. This being finished with indefati-
gable industry, for a great way every where,
' F2.
10S
I planted sticks of osier J ike a wood, about
twenty thousand of them, leaving a large space
between them and my wall, that I might have
room to see an enemy, and that they migh^
not be sheltered among the young trees, if
they offered to approach the outer wall. And
indeed, scarce two years had passed over my
head, when there appeared a lovely shady
grove, and in six years it became a thick wood,
perfectly impassible. For my safety, I left no
avenue to go in or out; instead of which I set
two ladders, one to a part of the rock which
was low, and then broke in, leaving room to
place another ladder upon that; so that when
I took those down, it was impossible for any
man to descend without hurting himself; and
if they had, they would still be at the outside
of my outer wall. But while I took all these
measures of human prudence for my own pre-
servation I was not altogether unmindful of
other affairs. To preserve my stock of tame
goats, that the enemy should not take all at
pnce, I looked out for the most retired part of
the island, which was the place where I had
lost myself before mentioned, and there finding
a clear piece of land, containing three acres,
surrounded with thick woods, I wrought so
hard, that in less than a month's time, I fenced
it so well round, that my flocks were very well
secured in it, and I put therein two he goats
and ten she ones.
104
All this labour was occasioned purely by
fearful apprehensions, on account of seeing the
print of a man's foot. And not contented yet
with what I had done, I searched for another
place towards the west point of the island,
where I might also retain another flock. Then
wandering on this errand more to the west of
the island than ever I had yet done, and cast-
ing my eyes towards the sea, methought I per-
ceived a boat at a great distance; but could
not possibly tell what it was for want of my
perspective glass. I considered then it was no
strange thing to see the print of a man's foot;
and, concluding them cannibals, blessed God
for being cast on the other side of the island,
where none, of the savages, as I thought, ever
came. But when I came down the bill to the
shore, which was the S. W. point, of the island,
I was soon confirmed in my opinion; nor can
any one describe my horror and amazement,
when I saw the ground spread with sculls,
hands, feet, and bones of human bodies; and
particularly, I perceived a space like a circle,
in the midst of which had been a fire, about
which I conjectured these wretches sat, and
unnaturally sacrificed and devoured their fellovv*
creatures.
The horror and loathsomeness of this dread-
ful spectacle, both confounded my senses, and
made me discharge from my stomach in an ex-
cessive manner. I then returned towards my
105
habitation; and in my way thither shedding
floods of tears, and falling clown on my bended
knees, gave God thanks for making my nature
contrary to these wretches, and delivering me
so long out of their hands.
Though reason and my long residence here
had assured me, that these savages never came
up to the thick woody part of the country,
and that I had no reason to he apprehensive of
a discovery, yet sucli an abhorrence did I still
retain, that, for two years after, I confined
myself only to my three plantations; I mean
my castle, country seat, and inclosure in the
voods, though in process of time, my dread-
ful apprehensions began to wear away.
Thus my circumstances for some time remain-
ed very calm and undisturbed: though indeed,
the terror which the savages had put me in,
spoiled some inventions for my own convenient
cies. One of my projects was to brew me
some beer; a very whimsical one indeed, when
it is considered, that I had neither casks suf-
ficient, nor could I make any to preserve it in;
neither had I hops to make it keep; yeast to
make it work nor a copper or kettle to make it
boil. Perhaps, indeed, after some years, I
might bring this to bear, as I had done other
things. But now my inventions were placed
another way; and day and night 1 could think
of nothing but how I might destroy some of
these cannibals, when, proceeding to their
106
bloody entertainments; and so saving a victim
from being sacrificed, that he might after be-
come my servant. Many were my contri-
vances for this purpose, and many more objec-
tions occurred, after I hatched them. I once
contrived to dig a hole under the place where
they made their fire and put therein five or six
pounds of gun powder, which would conse-
quently blow up all those that were near it;
but then I was loath to spend so much upon
them, lest it should not do that certain execu-
tion I should desire, and but only affright and
not kill them. Having laid this design aside,
I again proposed to myself to lie privately in
ambush in some convenient place, with my
three guns double loaded, and let fly at them
in the midst of their dreadful ceremony; and
leaving killed two or three of them at every
shot, fall upon the rest suddenly with my three
pistols, and let not one mother's son escape.
This imagination pleased my fancy so much
that I used to dream of it in the night time.
To put my design in exeution, I was not long
seeking for a place convenient for my purpose,
where unseen I might behold every action of
the savages. Here I placed my two muskets,
each of which was loaded with a brace of slugs,
and four or rive smaller bullets about the size
of pistol bullets; the fowling-piece was charged
with near a handful of the largest swan shot,
and in every pistol about four bullets. And
107
thus all things being prepared, no sooner would
the welcome light spread over the element, but,
like a giant refreshed with wine, as the scripture
has it, would I issue forth from my castle, and
from a lofty hill, three miles distant, view if I
could see any invaders approach unlawfully to
my kingdom. But having waited in vain two
or three months, it grew very tiresome to
me.
1 now argued with myself, it was better for
me never to attack, but to remain undiscovered
as long as I possibly could; that an opposite
conduct would certainly prove destructive;
for as it was scarcely to be supposed I could
kill them all, I might either be overpowered
by the remaining, or that somt) escaping might
bring thousands to my certain destruction.
And, indeed, religion took their part so much
as to convince me how contrary it was to my
duty to be guilty of shedding human blood,
innocent blood, innocent as to my particular,
whatever they are to one another; that 1 had
nothing to do with it, but leave it to the God
of all power and dominion, as I said before, to
do therein what seerapd convenient to his hea-
venly wisdom. And, therefore, on my knees
I thanked the Almighty for delivering me from
blood guiltiness, and begged his protection that
I might never fall into their hands."
Thus giving over an attempt which I had
rashly begun, I xiever ascended the hill on that
10S
occasion afterwards; I only removed my boat,
which lay on the other side of the island, and
every thing that belonged to her, towards the
east, into a little cove, that there might not
be the least shadow of any boat near, or habi-
tation upon the island. My castle then be-
came my cell, keeping always retired in it,
except when I went out to milk my she-goats,
and order my little flock in the wood, which
was quite out of danger: for sure I was, that
these savages never came here with expecta-
tion to find any thing, and consequently never
wandered from the coast; however, as they
might have several times been on shore, as
well before as after my dreadful apprehensions,
I looked back with horror to think in what
state I might have been, had I suddenly met
them slenderly armed, with one gun only
leaded with small shot.; and how great would
have been my amazement, if, instead of seeing
the print of one man's foot, I had perceived
fifteen or twenty savages, who, having once
set their eyes upon me, by the swiftness of
their feet, would have left me no possibility
of escaping f These thoughts would sink my
very soul; so that I would fall into a deep me-
lancholy, till such time as the consideration of
my gratitude to the divine Being moved it
from my heart. I then fbil into a contempla-
tion of the secret springs of Providence; and
li©w wonderfully we are delivered, when inscti-
109
sible of it; and when in uncertain mazes or
labyrinths of doubt or hesitation, what secret
hint directs us, in the right way when we in-
tended to go out of it; nay, perhaps contrary
to our business, sense, or inclination.
Anxieties of mind, and the care of my pre-
servation, put a period to all future inventions
and contrivances, either for accommodation,
or convenience, I now cared not to drive a
nail, chop a stick, fire a gun, or make a fire>
lest either the noise should be heard, or the
smoke discover me. And on this account I
used to burn my earthen ware privately in a
cave which I found in the wood, and which I
made convenient for that purpose; the princi-
pal cause that brought me here was to make
charcoal, so that I might bake and dress my
bread and meat without any danger.
At that time a curious accident happned me,
which I shall now relate.
While I was cutting down some wood for
making my charcoal, 1 perceived a cavity be-
hind a very thick branch of underwood. Cu-
rious to look into it, 1 attained its mouth, and
perceived it sufficient for me to stand up-
right in.
But when I had entered, having crept upon
my hands and feet through this strait, I found
the roof higher up, I think about twenty feet.
J3ut surely never mortal saw such a glorious
sight before! the roof and walls of this cava
110
reflected a hundred thousand lights to me from;
my two candles, as though they were indented
with shining gold, precious stones, or spark-
lifig diamonds. And indeed it was the most
delightful cavity or grotto of its kind that could
be desired, though entirely dark. The floor"
was dry and level, and had a kind of gravel
upon it; no nauseous venemous creatures to
be seen there, neither any damp Or Wet about
it. I could find no fault but in the entrance,
and I began to think that even this might he
very necessary for my defence, and therefore
resolved to make it my principal magazine. I
brought hither two fowling pieces and three
muskets, leaving only five pieces at my castle,
'planted in the nature of cannon. In a barrel
of gunpowder, which I took out of the sea, I
brought away about sixty pounds of good pow-
der, which wras not damaged; and this, with a
great quantity of lead for bullets, I removed
from my castle to this retreat, now fortified
both by art and nature,
I fancied myself now like one of the giants
of old, Who Were said to live in caves and holei
fcfnong the rocks, inaccessible to any but them-
selves, or, at least, most dangerous to attempt.
And now I despised both the cunning and
strength of the savages, either to find me out
Or to hurt me.
I think I was now in the twenty-third yea?
my reign, and my thoughts much, easiei
Ill
than formerly, having contrived several pretty
amusements, and diversions to pass away the
time in a pleasant manner. By this time my
pretty Poll had learned to speak English, and
pronounce his words very articulately and
plain; so that for many hours we used to chat
together after a very familiar manner, and he
lived no less than twenty-six years. My dog
which wa3 nineteen years old, sixteen of which
he lived with me, died some time ago, of meie
old age. As for my cats, they multiplied so
fast, that I was forced to kill or drive them into
the woods, except two or three which became
my particular favourites. Besides these, I
continually kept two or three houshold kids
about me, which I taught to feed out of my
pund, and two more parrots which could talk
indifferently, and call llobinson Crusoe, but
not so excellently as the first, by my not tak-
ing so much pains with them. I had also se-
veral sea fowls which I had wounded and cut
their wings; and growing tame, they used
to breed among the low trees about my cas-
tle-walls, all of which made my abode very
agreeable.
But what unforeseen events suddenly destroy
the enjoyments of this uncertain state of
when we least expect them! It was now the
month of December, and the particular time
of my harvest, which required my attendance
in the fields; whea goings out pretty early in
112
the morning, before it was daylight, there ap-
peared to me from the sea shore, a flaming
light, about two miles from me at the east end
of the island, where I had observed some sa-
vages had been before, not on the other side,
but to my great affliction it was on my side the
island.
Struck with a terrible surprise, and my usual
apprehensions, that the savages would perceive
my improvements, I returned directly to my
castle, pulled the ladder after me making all
things look as wild and natural as I possibly
could. In the next place I put myself in a
posture of defence, loading my muskets and
pistols, and committing myself to God's pro-
tection, I resolved to defend myself till my
last breath. Two hours after, impatient for
intelligence, I set my ladder up to the side of
the hill, where there was a flat place, and then
pulling the ladder after me, ascending to the
top, where laying myself on my belly, with my
perspective glass I perceived no less than nine
naked savages, sitting round a small rire, eat-
ing as I supposed, human flesh, with their two
canoes haled on shore, waiting for the flood
to carry tliem off again. The consternation I
wAs in at1, this sight, especially seeing them
near me was very great; but.when I perceived
their comitig must be always with the current
of the ebb, I became more easy in my thoughts^
being fully Jponvinced, that I might go abroad
1
113
with security all the time of flood, if they were
not before landed. And, indeed, this proved
just as I imagined; for no sooner did they all
take boat and paddle away, but the tide made
$J. W. When I saw them gone, I took two
guns upon my shoulders, and placing a couple
of pistols in my belt , with my great sword hang-
ing by my side, I went to the hill, wrhere at
first. I made a discovery of these cannibals, and
then -saw thwre had been three canoes more
of the savages on shore at that place, which
with die rest, were making over to the main
land,
But nothing could be more horrid to me,
when going to the place of sacrifice, the blood,
the bones, and other mangled parts of human
bodies appeared in my sight: and so fired was
I with indignation, that I was fully resolved to
be revenged on the first that came there, though
J lost my life in the execution. It then ap-
peared to me, that the visits which they make
to this island are not very frequent, it being
fifteen months before they came again: but
still I was very uneasy, by reason of the dis-
mal apprehensions of their surprising me una-
wares; nor dared I offer to fire a gun on that
side of the island where they used to appear,
lest, taking the alarm, they might return with
many hundred canoes, and then God only
knows in what manner I should have made my
114?
end. Thus was I a year or moire before I saw
^any of these devouring cannibals again.
But to wave this, the following accident,
which demands attention, for a while, eluded
the force of my thoughts in revenging myself
on those Heathens.
On the 16th of May (according to my
wooden calendar) the wind blew exceeding
hard, accompanied with abundance of thunder
and lightning all day, and succeeded by a very
stormy night. The seeming anger of the
Heavens made me have recourse to my Bible.
Whilst I was seriously pondering upon it, I
was suddenly alarmed with the noise of a gun,
which I conjectured was fired upon the ocean.
Such an unusual surprise made me start up in
a minute; when, with my ladder ascending the
mountain as before, that very moment a flash
of fire presaged the report of another gun,
which I presently heard, and found it was from
the part of the sea where the current drove me
away, I could not but then think, that this must
be a. ship in distress, and that these were the
melancholy signals for a speedy deliverance.
Great, indeed, was my sorrow upon this occa-
sion; but my labours to assist them must have
proved altogether vain and fruitless. How-
ever, I brought together all the dry wood that
was at hand, and making a pretty large pile,
set it on fire on the hill. I was certain they
plainly perceived it, by their firing another
115
gun as soon as it began to blaze/ and after tiiat
several more from the same quarter. All night
Jong I kept up my fire; and when the air
pi eared up, I perceived something a great way
a£ sea, directly E. but could not distinguish
what it was, even with my glass, by reason the
weather was so very foggy out at sea, Howr
ever, keeping my eyes directly fixed upon it, and
perceiving it did not stir I presently concluded
it must be a ship at anchor, and so very hasty
I was to be satisfied, that, taking my gun, I
went to the S. W. part of the island, to the
same rocks where I had been formerly drove
away by "the current; in which'"'time the wea-
ther being perfectly cleared up, to my great
sorrow, I perceived the wreck! of a ship cast
away upon those hidden rocks Informd when I
was out with my boat; and whicfr, by making a
kind of an eddy, were the occasion of my pre-
servation.
When I considered seriously every thing
concerning this wreck, and could perceive no
room to suppose any of them saved, I cannot
explain, by any possible force of words, what
longings my soul felt on this occasion, qften
breaking out in this manner. O that there
had been but two or three, nay even one per-
son saved, that we might have lived together,
conversed with, and comforted one another!
and, so much were my desires moved, that
when I repeated these words, ^ Oh! .that
116
tc there had been but one f* my hands would
so clench together, and my fingers press the
palms of my hands so close, that, had any
soft thing been between, they would have crush-
ed it, while my teeth would strike togethery
and set against each other so strong, that it re-
quired some time for me to part them.
Till the last year of my being on this island,
I never knew whether or not any had been
saved out of this ship. I had the affliction,
some time after, to see the corpse of a drowned
boy come on shore, at the end of the island
which was next the shipwreck; there was no-
thing on him jbut a seaman's waistcoat, a pair
of open-kneed jinen drawers, and a blue linen
shirt, but no particular mark to guess what
nation he was of. In his pocket were two
pieces of eigfy;, and a tobacco pipe, the last
of which I preferred much more than I did the
first. And now the calmness of the sea tempt-
ed me to venture out in my boat to this wreck,
not only to get something necessary out of the
ship, but perhaps, some living creature might
be on board, ,whose life I might preserve. This
had such an influence upon my mind, that im-
mediately I went home, and prepared every
thing necessary for the voyage, carrying on
board my boat provisions of all sorts, with a
good quantity of rum, fresh water, and a com-
pass: so putting off, I paddled the canoe
along the shore, till I came to the N. E. part
117
of the island, from whence I was to launch
into the ocean; but here the current ran so
violently, and appeared so terrible, that my
heart began to fail me; foreseeing, that if I
was driven into any of these currents, I might
be carried not only out of the reach or sight of
the island, but even inevitably lost in the boil-
ing surges of the ocean.
So oppressed was I at these troubles, that I
gave over my cnterprize, sailing to a little
creek on the shore, where, stepping out, I sat
me down on a rising hill, very pensive and
thoughtful. I then perceived that the tide was
turned, and the flood come on, which made
it impracticable for me to go out for so many
hours.
That night I reposed myself in my canoe,
covered with my watch coat instead of a blan-
ket the heavens being my tester. I set out with
the first of the tide full north, till I felt the
benefit of the current, which carried me at
a great rate eastward, yet not with such impe-
tuosity as before, as to take from me all
government of my canoe; so that in two hours
1 came up to the wreck, which appeared to
me a most melancholy sight. It seemed to be
a Spanish vessel by its building, stuck fast be-
tween two rocks; her stern and quarter beaten
to pieces by the sea; her main-mast and fore-
mast were brought off by the board; thatig :_.
broken short off. As I approached nearer^ I 7
G3
118
perceived a dog on board, who, seeing me
coming, 3relped and cried; and no sooner did
I call him, but the poor creature jumped into
the sea, out of which I took him up almost
tarnished with hunger and thirst; so that when
I gave him a cake of bread, no ravenous wolf
could devour it more greedily; and he drank
to that degree of fresh water, that he would
have burst himself had I suffered him.
'The first sight I met with in the ship, were
two men drowned in the cock-room or forecas-
tle, inclosed in one another's arms: hence I
very probably supposed, that when the vessel
struck in the storm, so high and incessantly did
the waters break in and over her, that the mei\
not being able to bear it were strangled by the
constant rushing of the waves. There were
several casks of liquor, whether wine or brandv
I could not be positive, which lay in the lower
hold, as were plainly perceptible by the ebbing
out of the water, yet were too large for me to
pretend to meddle with: likewise I perceived
several chests, which I supposed belonged to
the seamen, two of which I got into my boat,
without examining what was in them. What
became of the rest of the sailors I could not
certainly tell; and all her riches signified no-
thing at that time to any body.
^Searching farther I found a cask, containing
about twenty gaIlons:full of liquor, which, with
£ome labour I got into my boat; in a cabin
119
were several muskets, which I let remain there;
but took away with me a great powder horn,
with about four pounds of powder in it. I
took also a fire shovel and tongs, with two
brass kettles, a copper pot to make chocolate,
and a grid-iron; ah which were extremely ne-
cessary to me, especially the fire shovel and
tongs. And so with this cargo accompanied
with my dog, I came away, the tide serv-
ing for that purpose; and the same evening,
about an hour within night, I attained the
island, after the greatest toil and fatigue ima-
ginable.
That night I reposed my wearied lirmbs in
the boat, resolving the next morning to har-
bour what I had gotten, m my new found sub-
terraneous grotto; and nol carry my earga
home to my ancient castle. Having refreshed
myself, and got ail my effects an shore, I next
proceeded to examine the particulars; and so
tapping the cask I found the liquor to be a
kind of rum, but not like what we had at the
Brazils, nor indee^l near so good. At the
opening of the chest, several things appeared
very useful to me; for instance, I found in
one a very ftne case of bottles, containiag the
finest and best sort of cordial waters; each
bottle held about three pints, curiously tipt
with silver. I found also two pots full of the
choicest sweet meats, and two more which the
water had utterly 6poiled. There were likewise.
120
several good shirts, exceeding welcome to me,
and about one dozen and a half of white linen
handkerchiefs, and coloured neckcloths, the
former of which was absolutely necessary for
•wiping my face in a hot day; and, in the till,
J found three bags of money, in one of which,
decently wrapt up in a piece of paper, were six
doubloons of gold, and some small bars and
ivedges of the same metal, which I believe
might weigh near a pound. In the other chest
I only found some clothes of very little value,
except about two pounds of fine glazed pow-
der, in three flasks, kept as I believe, for
charging their fowling pieces on any occasion,
so that, on the whole I made very little of this
voyage. The money was indeed as mere dirt
ato me, useless and unprofitable, all which I
would have freely parted with for two or three
pair of English shoes and stockings, things
that for many years I had not worn, except
those which I had lately taken off the feet, of
those unfortunate men I found drowned in the
wreck, yet not so good as English shoes either
for ease or service. I found no gold in the se-
cond chest; so concluded that what I took
from the first belonged to an officer, the latter
appearing to have a much inferior person for-
ks owner. However, as despicable as the mo-
ney seemed, I likewise lugged it to my cave,
laying it up securely, as I did the rest of my
cargo: and after 1 had done all this, I re-
121
turned back to my boat, rowing or paddling
her along till I came to my old harbour, where
I carefully laid her up, and so made the best
of my way to my castle. When I arrived
there, every thing seemed safe and quiet: so
that now my only business was to repose my-
self after my wonted manner, and take care of
my domestic affairs. But though I might have
lived very easy, as wanting for nothing abso-
lutely needful; yet still I was more vigilant
than usual upon account of the savages, never
going much abroad; or, if I did, it was to the
#ast part of the island, where I was well as-
sured that the savages never came, and where
I might not be troubled to carry that heavy
load of weapons for my defence, as I was
obliged to do if I went the other way.
Two years did 1 live in this anxious condi-
tion, in all which time, contrary to my former
resolutions, my head was filled with nothing
but projects and de-signs how I might escape
from this island; and so much were my wan-
der ifl^|h oughts bent upon a rambling disposi-
Liofl|pi|at had I had the same boat that I went
troiipPi&lee in, I should have ventured once
moli| to the uncertainty of the raging ocean.
I cannot however but consider myself as one
of the unhappy persons, who make themselves
wretehed by their dissatisfaction with the sta-
tions which God has placed them in; for, not
to take a review of my primitive condition, and
 
122
my father's excellent advice, the going con-
trary to which was, as I may say, my original
siti, the following mistakes of the same nature
certainly had been the means of my present
unhappy station. What business had I to leave
a settled fortune, and a well stocked planta-
tion, improving and increasing, where, by this
time, I might have been worth a hundred thou-
sand moidores, to turn supercargo to Guinea, to
fetch negroes, when time and patience would
have so enlarged my stock at home, as to be
able to employ those whose more immediate
business it was to fetch them home, even to my
own door?
But as this is commonly the fate of young
heads, so a serious reflection upon the folly of
it ordinarily attends the exercise, when the
dear bought experience of time teaches us re-
pentance. Thus wras it with me; but notwith-
standing the thoughts of my deliverance ran so
strongly in my mind, that it seemed to check
all the dictates of reason and philosophy.
Having retired to my castle, after my late
voyage to the ship, my frigate laid up and se-
cured, as usual, and my condition Jhe same as
before, except being richer, though I hajf as
Kttle occasion for riches as the Indians of Peru
had for gold, before the cruel Spaniards came
among them: one night in March, being the
rainy season, in the four and twentieth year of
my solitude, I lay down to sleep, very well hi
125
health, without distemper, pain, or uncommon
uneasiness either of body or mind; yet not-
withstanding I could not compose myself to
sleep all the night long. All this tedious while
it is impossible to express what innumerable
thoughts came into my head. I traced quite
over the whole history of my life in miniature,
from my utmost remembrance of things till I
came to this island; and then proceeded to
examine every action and passage that had oc-
curred since I had taken possession of my
kingdom. In my reflections upon the latter, I
"was comparing the happy posture of my affairs^
in the beginning of my reign, to this life of
anxiety, fear, and concern, since I had disco*
vered the print of a foot in the sand; that while
I continued without apprehension, I was inca-
pable of feeling the dread and terror I now
suffered. How thankful rather ought I to have
been for the knowledge of my danger, since
the greatest happiness a man can be possessed
of is to have sufficient time to provide against
it? How stupendous is the goodness of Provi-
dence, which sets such narrow bounds to the
sight and knowledge of human nature, that
wrole men walk in the midst of so many dan-
gers they are kept serene and calm, by having
the events of things hid from their eyes, and
knowing nothing of those many dangers that
surround them, till perhaps they are dissipated
and vanished away.
124
When I came more particularly to consider
of the real danger I had so many years escaped;
how I had walked about in the greatest secu-
rity and tranquillity, at a time, perhaps, when
even nothing but the brow of a hill, a great
tree, or the common approach of night, had
been between me and the destructive hand of
cannibals, who would devour me with as good
an appetite, as I would a pigeon or curlew;
surely all this, I say could not but make me
sincerely thankful to my great Preserver, whose
singular protection I acknowledged with the
greatest humility, and without, which I must
inevitably have fallen into the cruel hands of
those devourers.
About a year and a half after, one morning
early I was very much surprized by seeing no
less than five canoes all on shore together, on
my side of the island, and the savages that be-
longed to them all landed, and out of my sight.
Upon which, much dispirited and perplexed, I
lay still in my castle; which, however, I put
in a proper posture for an attack; and, having
formerly provided all that was necessary, was
soon ready to enter upon an engagement, should
they attempt it. Having waited for some tifffe,
my impatient temper would let me bear it no
longer ; I set my guns at the foot of my ladder,
and, as usual, ascended up to the top of the
hill at two stages, standing, however, in such
a manner, that my head did not appear above
125
the hill, so that they could not easily perceive
me: and here, by the assistance of my per-
spective glass, I observed no less than thirty in
number around a fire, feasting upon what meat
they had dressed : how they cooked it, or what
it was, I could not then perfectly tell; but they
were all dancing and capering about the flames,
using many frightful and barbarous gestures.
But while, with a curious eye, I was behold-
ing these wretches, my spirits sunk within me,
when I perceived them drag two miserable crea-
tures from the boats, to act afresh the dread-
ful tragedy, as I supposed they had done be-
fore. It was not long before one of them fell
upon the ground, knocked down, as I suppose,
with a club or wooden sword, for that was their
manner; while two or three others went imme-
dtately to work, cutting him open for their
cookery, and then fell to devour him as they
had done the former: while the last unhappy
captive was left by himself, till such time as
they were ready for him. The poor creature
looked round him with a sorrowful eye, trem-
bling at the thoughts of death: yet, seeing
himself a little at liberty, nature, that very mo-
ment's it were, inspired him with hopes of life:
He started away from them, and ran, with in-
credible swiftness, along the sands, directly to
that part of the coast where my antient and
venerable castle stood.
126
You may well Imagine, I was dreadfully af-
frighted, upon this occasion, when, as I thought
they pursued him in a whole body, all running
towards my palace. And now, indeed, I ex-
pected, that he would certainly fly to my grove
for protection. However, my spirits beginning
to recover, I still kept upon my guard; and 1
now plainly perceived, there were but three
men out of the number that pursued him. I
was infinitely pleased with what swiftness the
poor creature ran from his pursuers, gaining so
much ground upon them, that I plainly per-
ceived could he thus hold it out for half an
hour, there was not the least doubt but he
would save his life from the power of his
enemies.
Between them and my castle there was a
creek, the very same which I sailed into with
all my effects from the wreck of the ship, on
the steep banks of which I very much feared
the poor victim would be taken, if he could
not swim for his escape: But soon was I out of
pain for him, when I perceived he made no-
thing of it, though at full tide, but, with an
intrepid courage, spurred on by the sense of
danger, he plunged into the flood, swimming
over in about thirty strokes, and then landing,
ran with the same incredible strength and
swiftness as before. When the three pursuers
came to %he creek, two of them, who I per-
ceived could not swim, happily for themselves.
127
returned to their company, while the other,
with an equal courage, but much less swiftness,
attained the other side, as though he was re-
solved never to give over the pursuit. And
now or never I thought was the time for me to
procure me a servant, companion, or assistant:
and that I was- decreed by Providence to be the
instrument to save this poor creature s life.
I immediately .descended my two ladders with
the greatest expedition; I took up my two
guns, whichj I said before were at the bottom
of them: and, getting up again with the same
haste towards the hill, I made nearer the sea.
In a word, taking a short cut down the hill, I
interposed between the pursuer and pursued,
hallooing aloud to the latter, who, venturing
to look back, was, no doubt, as much terrified
at me as at them. I beckoned to him, with
my hand, to return back, in the mean time ad-
vancing towards the pursuer. I was very un-
willing to fire lest the rest should hear, though
at that distance, I questioned whether they
could or no; and, being out of sight of the
smoke, they could not easily have known what
to in alee of It. The savage stopped as if he
had been amazed: when, advancing toward*
him, I could perceive him take his bow from
his back, and, fixing an arrow to it, was pre-
paring to shoot at me, and, without dispute
might4 Jiave lodged the arrow in my breast; but
in this absolutely necessary case of self-preser*
128
vation, I immediately fired, and shot him dead,
just as his hand was going to draw the fatal
string. All this while, the savage who had fled
before stood still, and had the satisfaction to
see his enemy killed, as he thought, who de-
signed to take away his life: so affrighted was
lie with the fire and noise of my piece, that he
stood as it were like Lot's wife, fixed and im-
moveable without either sense or motion. This
obliged me to halloo to him again, making the
plainest signs I could to him to draw nearer. I
perceived he understood these tokens by his
approaching to me a little way, when, as if
afraid I should kill him too, he stopped again.
Several times did he advance, and as often stop
in this manner, till, coming more to my view,
I perceived him trembling, as if he was to un-
dergo the same fate. Upon which 1 looked
upon him with a smiling countenance, and still
beckoning to him; at length he came close to
me, and kneeled down, kissed the ground, laid
his head upon it, and taking me by the,foot,
set it upon his head; and this, as 1 understood
afterwards, was a token of swearing to be my
slave for ever. I took him up, and making
mucli of him, encouraged him in the best man-
ner I could.
The greatest astonishment that my new ser-
vant conceived, was at the manner of killing
the savage at such a distance, without a bow
and arrow; and such was his longing desire to
129
know it, that he first pointed to the dead car-
case, and then made signs to me to grant him
leave to go to it. Upon which I bid him go,
and as well as I could, made him sensible I
granted his request. But when he came there,
how wonderfully was he struck with amaze-
ment! First he turned it on one side, then on
another, wondering he could perceive no quan-
tity of blood, he bleeding inwardly : and after
sufficiently admiring the wound the bullet had
made in the breast, he took up his bow and ar-
rows, and came back again; upon which I
turned to go away, making signs to him to fol-
low, lest the rest missing their companion,
might come in pursuit of him, and this I found
he understood «rery well, by making me to un-
derstand that his design was to bury it, that
it might not be seen if it happened; and
which by signs again I made him sensible I very
much approved of. Immediately he fell to
work, and never was grave-digger more dex-
trous in the world than lie was; for in an in-
stant, as I might say, he scraped a< large hole
in the sands with his hands, sufficient to bury
it in; there he dragged it, and without
any ceremony he covered it over. I then
called him away, and instead of carrying him
directly to my castle at first, I conveyed him to
my cave on the farther part of the islan'd.
Weary and faint, hungry and thirsty, un-
doubtedly must this poor creature be, sup-
130
ported chiefly by the vivacity of spirit, and un«
common transports of joy that his deliverance
occasioned. Here I gave him bread and a
bunch of raisins to eat, and water to drink, on
which he fed very cheerfully, to his exceeding
refreshment. I then made him a convenient
bed, with a parcel of rice straw, and a blanket
upon it, (a bed which I used myself sometimes)
and then pointing to it, made signs for him to
lie down to sleep, upon which the poor crea-
ture went to take a welcome repose.
Indeed he was a very comely, handsome,
young fellow, extremely well made, with
straight long limbs, not too large, tall and
well shaped, and as near as I could reckon
about twenty-six years of age. His counte-
nance had nothing in it fierce or surly, but ra-
ther a sort of majesty in his face; and yet
especially when he smiled, he had all the
sweetness of an European, His hair was not
curled like wool, as many of the blacks are,
but long and black, with the most beautiful,
Vet careless, tresses spreading over his shoul-
ders. He had a very high and large forehead,
with a great vivacity and sparkling sharpness in
his eyes. His skin was not so tawny as that
of the Americans; but rather of a light dun,
olive colour, that had something agreeable in
it, though not very easy to give a description
of. His face was round and plump, with a
small nose, very differ eat from the fiatnsss of
131
the negroes, a pretty small mouth, thin lips,
fine teeth, very well set, and white as the
driven snow. In a word, such handsome fea-
tures, and exact symmetry in every part, made
me consider, that I had saved the life of an
Indian prince, no less graceful and accom-
plished than the great Oroonoko, whose memo-
rable behaviour and unhappy contingencies of
life have charmed the world, both to admira-
tion of his person, and compassion to his suf-
ferings.
He had not, I think, slept above an hour,
when he awakened again, and while I was
milking my goats hard by, out he runs from
the cave towards me in my inclosure, and lay-
ing himself down on the ground in the lowest
prostration, made all the antic gestures ima-
ginable, to express his thankfulness to me for
being his deliverer. I confess, though the
manner of his behaviour seemed to be ludi-
crous enough to occasion laughter; yet I wras
very much moved at his affection, so that my
heart melted within me, fearing he might die
away in excess of joy, like reprieved malefac-
tors; especially as I was incapable either to let
him blood, or administer physic. It were to be
wished, that Christians would take example by
this Heathen, to have a lasting remembrance
of the benefits and deliverances they have re-
ceived, by the kind mediation and powerful in-
texposition of their benefactors and deliverersf-
132
and it would likewise be happy for mankind,
were there no occasion to blame many, who,
instead of thankfully acknowledging favours
and benefits, rather abuse and contemn those
who have been the instruments to save them
from destruction.
But, leaving these just reflections, I return
to the object that occasioned them ; for my man,
to conclude the last ceremony of obedience,
laid down his head again upon the ground, close
to my foot, and set my other foot upon his
head, as he had done before, making all the
signs of subjection, servitude, and submission
imaginable, to let me understand he would
serve me as long as his life endured. As I un-
derstood him in many things, 1 made him sen-
sible I was very well pleased with him; and, in
a little time, I began to speak to him, and teach
him how to talk to me again.
In the first place, I made him to understand
his name was to be Friday, because it was upon
that day I saved his life; I then taught him to
say Master, which I made him sensible was ta
be my name; 1 likewise taught him to say Yes
and No, and to know what they meant. 1 gave
him some milk in an earthen pot, making him
view me while I drank it betbre him, and soaked
my bread in it; I gave him a cake of bread,
and caused him to soak it likewise, to which he
readily consented, making signs of the greatest,
satisfaction imaginable.
133
All that night did I keep him there; but no
sooner did the morning light appear, than I
ordered him to arise and come along with me,
with certain tokens that I would give him some
cloaths like mine, at which he seemed very
glad, being stark naked, without the least co-
vering whatever. As we passed by the place
where the man had been interred, my man
pointed directly to his grave, shewing me the
marks that he had made to find it again, giving
me to understand, by signs, that we should
dig him up, and devour him. At this I ap-
peared extremely displeased, expressed my ut-
most abhorrence, as if I would vomit at the
apprehensions of it, beckoning witb my hand
to come away, which he did with the greatest
reverence and submission. After this I con-
ducted him to the top of the hill, to view if the
rest of the savages were yet remaining there;
but when I looked through my perspective
glass, I could see no appearance of them, nor
of their canoes; so that it was very evident
they never minded their deceased companion
whom we had slain; which if they had, they
would surely have searched for, or left one hoat
behind for him to follow, after he returned from
his pursuit.
Curiosity, and a desire of satisfaction, ani-
mating me with courage to see this scene of
barbarity, I took my man Friday with me to the
place of their bloody entertainment. JBut wheu
H
1S4.
I came there, I was struck with the utmost
horror at so dreadful a spectacle, whilst Friday
was no way concerned about it, being no doubt
in his turn, one of these devourers. Here lay
several human bones, there several pieces of
mangled flesh, half eaten, mangled and scorch-
ed, whilst streams of blood ran promiscuously
as waters from a fountain. As I was musing
on this dreadful sight, Friday took all the pains
he could by particular signs, to make me un-
derstand, that they had brought over four pri-
soners to feast upon, three of whom they had
eaten up, and that he was the fourth, pointing
to himself: that there having been a bloody
battle between them and his great king, in the
just defence of whom he was taken prisoner,
with many others; all of these were carried off
to different places to be devoured by their con-
querors; and that it was his fortune to be
brought hitiler by these wretches for the very
same purpose.
After I was made sensible of these things, I
caused Friday to gather those horrid remains,
and lay them together upon a heap, which I
ordered to be set on fire, and burnt them to
ashes: my man, however, still retained the na-
ture of a cannibal, having a hankering stomach
after some of the flesh: but such an extreme
abhorrence did T express at the least appear-
ance of k, that he durst not but conceal it; for
135
1 made him very sensible, that if he offered any
such thing, I would certainly shoot him.
This being done, I carried my man with me
to my castle, and gave him a pair of linen
drawers, which I had taken out of the poor
gunner's chest before mentioned; and which,
with a little alteration, fitted him very well: in
the next place I made him a jerkin of goat
skin, such as my skill was able to manage, and
indeed I thought myself then a tolerable good
tailor. I gave him also a cap, which I made
of a hare's skin, very convenient and fashion-
able. Thus being clothed tolerably well, my
man was no less proud of his babit, than I was
in seeing him in it. Indeed he went very awk-
wardly at first, but by using himself to them,
at length he took to them very well.
My next concern was, where I should lodge
him : and that I might do well by him, and yet
be perfectly easy myself, I erected a tent for
him in the vacant place between my two forti-
fications in the inside of the last, and the out-
side of the first; and as there was an entrance
or door into my cave, I made a formal framed
door-case, and a door to open on the inside ; I
barred it up in the night time, taking in my
ladders too, so that, was my man to prove
treacherous, there could be no way to come at
me in the inside of my innermost wall, without
making so much noise in getting over that it
must needs waken me; for my first wall had
II \i
136
now a complete roof over it of long poles,
spreading over my tent, and leaning up to the
«ide of the mountain, which was again laid
across with smaller sticks instead of laths, and
thatched over to a great thickness with the rice
straw, which was as strong as reeds; and at the
hole of the place, left on purpose to go in or
out by the ladder, I had placed a kind of a
trap door, which, if it had been attempted on
the outside, would not have opened at all, but
have fallen down, and made a great noise; and
as to my weapons, every night I took them all
to my bed side.
But there was no occasion for this precau-
tion; for surely never master had a more sin-
cere, faithful and loving servant than Friday
proved to me. Without passion, sullenness,
or design, perfectly obliging and engaging, his
affections were as much tied to me, as those of
a child to his parents; and I might venture to
say, he would have sacrificed his life for the
saving of mine, upon any occasion whatsoever.
And indeed the many testimonies he gave me
of this, sufficiently convinced me that I had no
occasion to use these precautions.
I had not been above two or three days re-
turned to my castle, but my chief design was,
how I should bring Friday off from his horrid
way of feeding; and, to take from him that in-
human relish he by nature had been accustomed
to, I thought it my duty to let him taste other
137
flesh, which might the rather tempt him to the
same abhorrence I so often expressed against
their accursed way of living. Upon which,
one morning I took him out with me, with an
intention to kill a kid out of the flock, and
bring it home, and dress it. As I was going,
I perceived a she goat lying down in the shade,
and two young kids sitting by her. Imme-
diately I catched hold of my man Friday, and
bidding him stand still, and not stir, I pre-
sented my piece and shot one of the kids.
My poor servant, who had at a distance per-
ceived me kill his adversary, and yet did not
know by what means, or how it was done,
stood trembling and surprised, and looked so
amazed, that I thought he would have sunk
into the earth. He did not see the kid I
aimed at, or behold I had killed it, but ripped
up his waistcoat to see if he was not wounded,
thinking my resolution was to kill him; for
coming to me, he fell on his knees, earnestly
pronouncing many things which I did not
understand the meaning of; which at length
I perceived was, that I would not take away
his life.
Indeed I wag much concerned to see him
in that condition, where nature is upon the
severest trial, when the immediate hand of
death is ready to put for ever a period to this
mortal life: and indeed so much compassion
had I to this creature, that h was with diffr-
II 3
138
culty I refrained from tears. But, however,
as another sort of countenance was necessary,
and to convince him that I would do him no
harm, I took him, smiling, by the hand, then
laughed at him, and pointing to the kid which
I had slain, made signs to him to fetch it,
which accordingly he did. No less curious
was he in viewing how the creature was killed,
than he was before in beholding the Indian;
which, while he was admiring, I charged my
gun again, and presently perceived a great
fowl like a hawk, perching upon a tree within
shot; and, therefore, to let Friday understand
what I was going to do, I called him to me
again, pointing at the fowl, which I found to
be a parrot. I made him understand that I
would shoot and kill that bird; accordingly I
fired, and bade him look, when immediately
he saw the parrot fall down. Again he stood
like one amazed, notwithstanding all I had
said to him: and the more confounded he was,
because he did not perceive me put any thing
into my gun. Undoubtedly a thing so utterly
strange, carrying death along with it, far or
near, either to man or beast, must certainly
create the greatest astonishment to one who
never had heard such a thing in his whole life:
and really his amazement continued so long,
that had I allowed it, he would have prostrated
himself before me and my gun, with the greatest
worship and adoration. As for the gun m
139
particular, he would not so much as touch it
for several days after; but would come and
communicate his thoughts to it, and talk to
it, as if the senseless piece had Understood
and answered him; all this I could perceive
him to do, when he thought my back was
turned, the chief intent of which was, to desire
it not to kill him, as I afterwards came to
understand.
I never strove to prevent his admiration,
nor hinder him from these comical gestures he
used on such occasions; but when his asto-
nishment was a little over, I made tokens to
him to run and feteh the parrot that I had
shot; which accordingly he did, staying some
time longer than usual, by reason that the bird,
not being quite dead, had fluttered some way
farther from the place where she fell. In the
mean time, as he was looking for her, I took
the advantage of charging my gun again, that
so I might be ready for any other mark that
offered; but nothing more occurred at that
time. So I brought home the kid, and the
same evening took off the skin/ and divided
the carcase as well as I could. Part of the
flesh I stewed and boiled, in a pot I had for
this purpose. And then spreading my table,
I sat down, giving my man some of it to eat,
who was wonderfully pleased, and seemed to
like it very well: but what was the most sur-
prising to him was to see me eat salt with it:
HO
upon which he made me understand, that the
salt was very bad for me ; when putting a little
into his mouth, he seemed to nauseate it in
such a manner, as to spit and sputter at it,
and then washed his mouth with fresh water:
but to shew him how contrary his opinion was
to mine, I put some meat into my mouth with-
out salt, and feigned to spit and sputter as
much for want of it, as he had done at it;
yet all this proved of no signification to Fri-
day; and it was a long while before he could
endure any salt m his meat or broth, and even
then but a small quantity.
Thus, having fed him sufficiently with boiled
meat and broth at that time, the next day I
was resolved to feast him with a roasted piece
of the kid. And having no spit to fasten it,
nor jack to turn it, I made use of that com-
mon artifice which many of the people of
England have, that is, to set two poles upon
each side of the fire, and one cross on the top,
hanging the meat thereon with a string, and
so turning it round continually, roast it in the
same manner as we read bloody tyrants of old,
cruelly roasted the holy martyrs. This prac-
tice caused great admiration in my man Fri-
day, being quite another way than that to
which the savages were accustomed. But
when he came to taste the sweetness and ten-
derness of the flesh, he expressed his entire
satisfaction above a thousand different ways.
14i
And as I could not but understand his mean-
ing, you may be sure I was as wonderfully
pleased, especially when he made it also very
plain to me, that he would never, while he
lived, eat man's flesh more.
It was now high time I should set my new
servant to work; so next day I put him to
beat out some corn, and sift it in the same
manner as I had done before. And really the
fellow was very quick and handy in the exe-
cution of any thing I ordered him to go about.
I made him understand that it was to make
bread for us to eat, and afterwards let him
see me bake it. In short, he did every thing
as I ordered him in a little time as well as I
could perform it myself.
But now considering that I had two mouths
to feed instead of one, it was necessary that I
must provide more ground for my harvest,
and plant a larger quantity of corn than I
commonly used to do; upon which I marked
out a larger piece of land, fencing it in the
same manner as I had done before; in the
execution of which I must give Friday this
good word, that no man could work more
hardy, or with better will than he did: and
when I made him sensible that it was for
bread to serve him tfs well as me, he then very
passionately made me understand, that he
thought I had much more labour on his ac-
count, than I had for myself; and that no
142
pains or diligence should be wanting in him,
if I would but direct him in those works
wherein he might proceed.
I must certainly own, that this was the most
pleasant year I ever had in the island; for
after some time Friday began to talk pretty
well, and understood the names of those things
which I was wont to call for, and the places
where I used to send bin). So that my long
silent tongue, which had been useless so many
years, except in an exclamatory manner,
either for deliverance or blessings, now began
to be occupied, in teaching, and talking to
nry man Friday; for indeed I had such a sin-
gular satisfaction in the fellow himself, so in-
nocent did his simple and unfeigned honesty
appear more and more every day, that I really
began entirely to love him; and for Ins part
I believe there was no love lost, and that his
nature had been more charmed by my exceed-
ing kindness, and his affections more placed
upon me, than any other object whatsoever
among hi?, own countrymen.
I once had a great inclination to try if he
had any hankering inclination to his own
country again : and by this time having taught
him English so well, that he could give me
tolerable answers to any question which I de-
manded, I asked him whether that nation to
which he belonged ever conquered in battle?
This question made Friday to smile, and to
H3
which he answered yes, yes, ur ahvays fight th'e
better; as much as to say, they ahvays got
the better in right. Upon which we proceed-
ed on the following discourse: You say, said
I, that you always tight the better; why then,
Friday, how came you to be taken prisoner?
Friday. But for all that, my nation beat
much.
Master, How, say you, beat! if your na-
tion beat them, how came you to be taken?
Friday. They more many mans than my
nation in the place where me was, they take
one, two, three, and me: my nation much
overheat them in the yonder place where me
no was, there my nation mans beat one, two,
three great thousands.
Master, Then why did not your men re-
cover you from the hands of your enemies?
Friday. They run one, two, or three, and
me; they make all go into the canoe; my na-
tion have no canoe that time.
Master, 'Tis very well, Friday; but what
does your nation do with the prisoners they
take? Do they carry them away and eat
them as these have done?
Friday. Yes, yes, my nation eat mans *too,
eat up all.
Master, To what place do they carry them
to be devoured?
Friday. Go to other nations where they
think.
144
Master. Do they bring them hither?
Friday. Yes, come over hither, come over
other place.
Master. And have you been with them here,
Friday?
Friday. Yes, me been here, (pointing to the
northxvest of the island, being the side where
they used to land J
Thus having gotten what account I could
from my man, I plainly understood, tjiat he
had been as bad as any of the rest of the can-
nibals, having been formerly among the sa-
vages who used to come on shore on the
farthest part of the island, upon the same
bloody occasions as he was brought hither for:
and some time after 1 carried him to that place
where he pointed; and no sooner did he come
there, but he presently knew the ground, sig-
nifying to me that he was ,once there when
they ate up twenty men, two women and a
young child; but as he could not explain the
number in English, he did it by so many
stones in a row, making a sign to me to count
them.
This passage I have the rather mentioned,
because it led to things more important and
useful for me to know: for after I had this
satisfactory discourse with him, my next ques-
tion was, how far it was from the island to the
shore, and whether the canoes were not often
lost in the ocean? to which he answered,
145
there was no danger; that no canoes were
ever lost; but that after a little way out to
the sea there was a strong current, and a wind
always one way in the afternoon This I
thought at first to be no more than the sets of
tide, of going out or coming in; but I after-
wards understood it was occasioned by the
great draught and reflux of the mighty river
Oroonoko, in the mouth or gulph of which I
imagined my kingdom lay; and that the land
which I perceived to the W. and N- W. must
be the great island Trinidad, on the north of
the river. A thousand questions (if that would
satisfy me) did I ask Friday, about the na-
ture of the country, the sea, the coasts, the
inhabitants, and what nations were nearest
them; to which questions the poor fellow de-
clared all he knew, with the greatest open-
ness, and utmost sincerity. When I demand-
ed of him the particular names of the various
nations of his sort of people, he could only
answer me in general that they were called
Carabe* Hence it was I considered that these
must be the Caribbees, so much taken notice
of by our maps, to be on that part of Ame-
rica. Then Friday proceeded to tell me, that,
up a great way beyond the moon, as much as
to say, beyond the setting of the moon, which
must be W. from their country, there dwelt
white bearded men, such as I was, pointing to
146
my whiskers, and that they kill much man^
I was not ignorant with what barbarity the
Spaniards treated these creatures; so that I
presently concluded it must be them, whose
cruelties had spread throughout America, to
be remembered even to succeeding genera-
tions.
Well, you may be sure, this knowledge,
which the imperfect information of my man
had led me to, was very comfortable to me,
and made me so curious as to ask him, how I
might depart from this island, and get amongst
those white men? He told me, Yes, yes, I
might go in two canoes. In two canoes, thought
I, what does my man mean? And, indeed it
was a long time before I understood his mean-
ing, which was, that it must be a large boat,
as big as two canoes, able to bear with the
waves, and not so liable to be overwhelmed as
one must be.
I believe there is no state of life but what
may be happy, if people would but endeavour
for their part to make it so. He is not the
happiest man that has the most riches, but he
that is content with what he hath. Before I
had my servant, 1 thought myself miserable
till I had him; and now that I had enjoyed
the happy benefits of him, I still complained,
and begged a deliverance from a place of re-
tirement, ease and plenty, where Providence
had sufficiently blessed me. In a word, from
147
this time I entertained some hopes, that one
time or other I might find an opportunity to
make my escape from this island, and that
this poor savage might be a great furtherance
thereto.
All the time since my man became so in-
telligent as to understand and speak to me, I
spared no pains nor diligence to instruct, him
according to my poor share of knowledge in
the principles of religion, and the adoration
that he ought to pay to the True God. One
time, as I very well remember,' 1 asked him
who made him? At first the innocent crea-
ture did not understand what I meant, but ra-
ther thought I asked him who was his father?
upon which I took another way to make him
sensible, by demanding from him an answer to
tills question. Friday, said I, who is it that
made the sea, this ground whereon we walk,
and all these hills and" woods which we be-
hold? And here, indeed, I did not miss my
intention: for he told me it was old Bena-
muckee (the God whom I supposed these sa-
vages adored) who lived a great way beyond
all. But as for his attributes, poor Friday
was an utter stranger. He could describe no-
thing of this great Being ; and all that he could
say was, that he was very old, much older
than the sea and land, the moon, or the stars.
Friday, said I again, if this great and old per-
son has. made all things in the world, how
12
148
comes it to pass, that all things, and you m
particular, do not adore and worship him?
Upon this, looking very grave, with a perfect
sweet look of innocence, he replied, Master,
all things say 0 to him, by which it may be
reasonably supposed he meant adoration-—
And where, said I, do the people of your coun-
try go when they die? He answered to Bena-
muekee. What, and those people that are
eaten up, do they go there? Benamudcee,
said he, love eem dearly; tne pray to Bena-
muckee in de canoe, and Benamuckee would love
me tvhen dey eat me all up.
Such discourses as these had I with my
man, and such made me sensible, that the true
God is worshipped even by savages, though
under imperfect similitudes.
1 now began to instruct my servant in the
saving knowledge of the true Deity, in which
the directions of God's holy Spirit assisted me.
I lifted up my hands to heaven, and pointing
thereto* told him, that the great Maker of
heaven and earth lived there:, that as his in-
finite power fashioned this world out of a con-
fused chaos, and made it in that beautiful
frame which we behold, so he governs and
preserves it by his unbounded knowledge, so-
vereign greatness, and peculiar providence:
that he was omnipotent, could do every thing-
for us, and take every thing away from us:
that he was a rewardei* and punisher of good
149
and evil actions: that there was nothing but
what he knew, no thoughts so secret but what
he could bring to light; and thus, by degrees,
I opened his eyes, and described to him the
manner of the creation of the world, the situa-
tion of paradise, the transgression of our first
parents, the wickedness of God's peculiar
people, and the universal sins and abomina-
tions of the whole earth. When, things were
implanted in his mind, I told him, that as
God's justice was equal to his mercy, he re-
solved to destroy this world, till his son Jesus
Christ interposed in our behalf, and, to pro-
cure our redemption, obtained leave of his
heavenly Father to come down from heaven
into the world, where he took human nature
upon him, instructed us in our way to eternal
life, and'died as a sacrifice for our sins; that
he was now ascended into heaven, mediating
lor our pardon, delivering our petitions, and
obtaining all those good benefits whilh we
ask in his name, by humble and hearty
prayers, all which were heard at the throne of
heaven. As very frequently I used to incul-
cate things into his mind, Friday one day told
me, that if our great God could hear us be*?
yond the sun, he must surely be a greater god
then their Benamuckcc, who lived but a little
way off, and yet could not hear them till they
ascended the great mountains where he dwelt,
to speak to him. What, said I, Friday, dicj
150
you go thither to speak to him too? He an-
swered, No, they never went that were young
men, none but old men, called their Oowakakee*
meaning the Indian priests, who went to say 0+
(so he called saying their prayers), and they
returned back, and told them what Benanuwkec
said.
Friday, said I, you must know, that before
this world w is made, there was an Almighty
Power existing, by whoo- power all things
were made, and whose majesty shall have no
end. To be glorified and adored by beings of
a heavenly nature, he created angels and arch-
angels, that is, glorified spirits resembling him-
self, to encompass his throne, eternally sing-
ing forth his praise in the most heavenly
sounds and divine harmony.
I found it easy enough to imprint the right
notions in his mind of God: for nature assisted
me in all" my arguments, to shew to him plain-y
the necessity of a great first, cause, and over-
ruling, governing power, of a secret directing
providence, and of the equity and reasonable-
ness of paying adoration to our Creator.
I then entered into a long discourse with
him, upon the subject of the world's redemp-
tion by the Saviour of it, and the doctrine of
repentance preached from heaven, together
with an holy faith in our blessed Redeemer
Jesus Christ: and next I proceeded to ex-
plain to him, according to my weak capacity,
151
the reason why our Saviour took not on him
the nature of angels, but rather the seed of
Abraham; and, lastly, that lie came only to
the lost sheep of the house of Israel, and the
like. God knows I had more sincerity than
knowledge in ail the ways I took for this poor
Indian s instruction; and, I must acknow-
ledg, what I believe every body that acts
upon the same principle will find, that in lay-
ing heavenly truths open before him I informed
and instructed myself in many things that
either I did not know, or had not perfectly
considered before; so that, however this poor
creature might be improved by my instruc-
tions, certain it is, that I myself had great
reason to be thankful to Providence for send-
ing him to me. His company allayed my
grief, and made my habitation comfortable;
and, when I reflected that the solitary life to
which I had been so long confined, had made
me to look further towards heaven, by making
me the instrument, under Providence, to save
the life, and, for ought I know, the soul of
this poor savage, by bringing him to the know-
ledge of Jesus Christ, it caused a secret joy
to spread through every part of my soul; and
I frequently rejoiced, that ever I'Aas brought
to this place, which 1 once thouJ|£;the most
miserable part of the world.
In this thankful frame of mind did I after*
wards continue, while I abode on the island,
152
and for three years did my man and I live in
the greatest enjoyment of happiness, Indeed,
I believe the savage was as good a Christian as
I; and I hope we were equally penitent; and
such penitents as were comforted and restored
by God's Holy Spirit; for now we had the
wprd of the Lord to insrruct us in the right
way, as much as if we had been on the Eng-
lish shore.
By the constant application I made of the
Scriptures, as I read them to my man Friday,
I earnestly endeavoured to make him under?
stand every part of it, as much as lay in my
power. He also, on the other hand, by his
very serious questions and inquiries, made me
a much better proficient in scripture know-
ledge, than I should have been by my own
private reading and study. I miist \\Qt omit
another thing, proceeding from the experience
I had in my retirement; it was that infinite
and inexpressible blessing, the knowledge of
God through Jesus Christ, which was so plain
and easy to be understood, as immediately to
direct me to carry on the great work of sin-
cere repentance for my'sins, and laying hold
of a Saviour for eternal life.
You may well suppose, that, by the frequent
discourse we had together, my man and I be-
came most intimately acquainted, and that
there was but very little that I could say, but
what Friday understood; and indeed, he spokp
153
very fluently, though it was but broken Eng-
lish. I now took a particular pleasure in re-
lating all my adventures, especially those that
occurred since my being cast on this island.
I made him understand that wonderful mys-
tery, as he conceived, of gunpowder and bul-
let, and taught him how to shoot. NI also pre-
sented to him a knife, which pleased him ex-
ceedingly, making him a belt, with a frog
hanging thereto, like those in which we wear
hangers in England; and, instead of a hanger
to put in the frog, I gave him a hatchet, which
was not only as good, but even a better wea*
*pon upon many occasions. In a-word, my
man thus accoutred, looked upon himself as
great as Don Quix'ote, when that celebrated
champion went to combat the windmill.
I next gave him a very particular descrip-
tion of my misfortune in being shipwrecked,
showing him, as near as I could, the place
where the ship lay, which had been gone long
before; but 1 brought, him to the ruins of my
boat, which before my whole strength could
not move, but now *was almost rotten and
fallen to pieces. I observed my gian Friday
to view this boat with an uncommon curiosity;
which, when he had done, he stood pondering
a great while, and said nothing. At last, saia
I, Friday, what makes you ponder'so much ?
Fie replied, 0 master^ me sec like boat come to
place at my nation.
154.
It was some time, indeed, before I under-
stood what my man meant; but examining
strictly into it, I plainly found, that such ano-
ther boat, resembling mine, had come upou
the country where he dwelt; that is to say,
by his farther explanation, that the boat was
driven there through stress of weather. It
then came into my mind that some European
ship having been cast away, the poor dis-
tressed creatures were forced to have recourse
to the boat to save their lives; and being all,
as I thought, drowned, I never concerned
myself to ask any thing concerning them, buc
my only enquiry was about the boat, and
* what description my man could give of it.
^ Indeed Friday answered my demands very
well, making every thing plain to my under-
standing; but beyond measure was I satisfied
when he told me with great warmth and ar-
dour, O master, zve save ivhite mans from drown;
upon which I immediately asked him, if there
were any white mans, as he called them, in the
boat; Yes, yes, said he, the boat fill very full
of ivhite mans. How many, Friday, said L
Hereupon he numbered his fingers, and count-
ed seventeen. And when I asked him what
became of them all, and whether they lived
or not? he replied, Yes, master, they all live,
they be live among my nation. This informa-
tion put fresh thoughts into my head, that
these must be thodo very men who before I
155
concluded had been swallowed up in the
ocean, after they had left their ship, that had
struck upon the rocks of my kingdom, and
after escaping the fury of the deep, landed
upon the wild shore, and committed them-
selves to the fury of the devouring Indians.
The manner of their cruelties to one ano-
ther, which consequently, as I thought, must
be acted with greater barbarity to strangers,
created in me a great anxiety, and made me
still more curious to ask Friday concerning
gjhem He told me he was sure they still lived
tnere, having resided among them above four
years, and that the savages gave them victuals
to live upon. But pray, Friday, said I, whence
proceeded all this good nature and generosity?
How came it to pass that they did not kill
and eat them, t« please their devouring ap-
petites; and occasion so splendid an enter-
tainment among them? No, no, said Friday,,
they not kill 'em> they make brother uohk 'em;
by which I understood there was a truce be-
tween them. And then I had a more favour-
able opinion of the Indians, upon Friday's ut-
tering these words: My nation fothfr nation
Tio eat mans, bid xvhen mans make toar Jight:
as though he had said, that neither' those of
his kingdom, nor any*other nations that hg
knew of, ever ate their fellow-creatures, but"
such as their law of arms allowed to be de-
voured; that is, those miserable cap&kes,
156
whose misfortune it should be to be made
prisoners of war.
S >me considerable time after, upon a very
pleasant day, in most serene weather, my man
and I stood upon the top of an hill, on the
island, whence I had once before beheld the
continent of America. I could not tell imme-
diately what was the matter; for suddenly
Friday fell a jumping and dancing as if he
had been mad; and upon my demanding the
reason of his behaviour, Ojoy, said he, 0 glad!
there see mi/ country, there wy nation, there
ivhtie mans get her. And indeed such a rap-
turous sen^e of pleasure appeared in his coun-
tenance, that his eyes had an uncommon
sparkling and brightness, and such a strange
eagerness, as if he had a longing desire to be
in his own country again. This made me not
so well satisfied with my man Friday as be-
fore; for by this appearance, I made no dis-
pute, but that if he could get back thither
again, he would not only be unmindful of
what religion I had taught him, but likewise
of the great obligation he owed me for his
wonderful deliverance: nay, that he would
not only inform his countrymen of me, but
accompany hundreds of them to my kingdom,
and make me a miserable sacrifice like those
unhappy wretches taken in battle.
Indeed I was very much to blame to have
these cruel, and unjust suspicions, and nmsi
157
freely own I wronged the jipor creature very
much, who was of a quite contrary temper.
And had he had that discerning acuteness
which many Europeans have, he would cer-
tainly have perceived nay coldness and indif-
ference, and also have been very muclji con-
cerned upon that account.
As we were walking up the same hill ano-
ther day, when the weather was so hazy at
sea, that I could not perceive the continent,
Friday, said I, don't, you wish yourself to be
in your own country, your own nation, among
your old friends and acquaintances? Yes,
sai<d he, me much 0 glad to be at my otvn
nation. And what would you do there Fri-
day? Would you turn wild again, eat man's
flesh, and be a savage as you were formerly I
Noy no, (answered he, full of concern, and
shaking his head) Friday now tell them to live
good, tell fhem pray God, tell them to eat com
bread, cattle, Jlesh, milk, no eat man again. But
surely, replied I, if you should offer to do all
this, they will kill you; and to manifest their
contempt of such instruction, eat you up when
they have done. He then put on a grave, yet
innocent and smooth countenance, saving, Aro,
they no hill me, they willing love learn ; that is,
that they would be very willing to learn : addfe,
ing withal, that they had learned very muc% of,
the bearded mans that came in the boat. Willf
jou; said I, go back again, Friday? flu
15$
smiled at that, and told me, that he could not
swim so far. But said I, I will make a canoe
for you: Yes, master', said he, me go ifyou go,
me no go if you stay. I go, Friday! why,
would you have them eat me up, and devour
your kind master? No, no, said he, me make
them no eat master, and me make them much love
you; that is, he would tell them how I had
slain his enemies, and thereby saved his life,
for which reason he would make them love me:
and then he related to me, as well as he was
able, how exceeding kind those of his nation
were to the white, or bearded men, as he
called them, who in their great calamity, were
driven into their country.
It was from this time, indeed, I had strong
inclinations to venture over, and use my ut-
most efforts, if possible, to join with these
white bearded men, who undoubtedly were
Spaniards or Portuguese; for, thought I, it
must be certainly a better and safer way to
escape when there is a good company, than
for me alone, from an island forty miles off
the shore, and without any assistance. Some
days after, Friday and 1 being at work, as
usual, ftfc the same time diverting ourselves
with various discourses, I told him I had a
*t)oat which I would bestow upon him, when-
ever he pleased to return to his own nation:
"aad to convince him of the truth of what I
said, I took him with me to the other side of
159
the island, where my frigate lay, and then
taking it from under water (for I always kept
it sunk for fear cf a discovery) we both went
into it to see how it would manage such an
expedition.
And really never could any be more dex-
trous in rowing than my faithful servant, mak-
ing the boat go as fast again as I could. Well,
now, Friday, said I, shall we now go to your
much desired nation? But, instead of meet-
ing with that cheaifulness I expected, he
looked very dull and melancholy at my saying
so; which indeed at first surprised me, till he
made me sensible, that his concern was about
the boat's being too small to go so far a voy-
age. Upon which I let him understand I had
a much bigger; and, accordingly the next
day went to the place where the first boat
lay, which I had made, when all the strength
I had, or art I could use, failed me in my at-
tempt to get it into the water: but now it hav-
ing lain in the sun two and twenty years, ancf
no care being taken of it all that while, it be-
came in a manner rotten. My man told me,
that, such a boat would do very well for the
purpose, sufficient to carry enougivvitilr> dring>
bread, for that was his manner of talking. In
*hort, my mind being strongly fixed upon my
design of going over with him to the conti-
nent, I very plainly told him, that we would
both go and make a boat full as big, and more
16<X
proportionable than that, wherein he might
safely return to his own nation.
These words made Friday loot? so very pen-
sive, that I thought he. would, have fallen at my
feet. It was some time before he could speak
a word, which made me ask him, what was the
matter with him? He replied, in a very soft
and moving tone, What has poor Friday done?
why are you angry mad with poor servant?
what me done, O what me done? Friday, said
I, you never yet have offended me: what
makes you think I am angry with you, when I
am not angry at all? You no angry, no angry,
said he several times; if you be no angry, why
den send Friday over great water to my own
nation? Why, surely, Friday, answered I,
did not you wish to be there, when, from a
mountain, you beheld the place where you
was born? and is it not to satisfy your desires
that I am willing to give you leave to return
thither? Yes, yes, said Friday, me wish be
ihere sure enough, but me den wish master there
to; no wish Friday there, no master there. In
short, he could not endure the thoughts of go-
ing there without me. I go there, Friday,
said I, what shall I do there? He answer-
ed very quickty, 0 master you do great deal
much good, you teach all de wild mam to be good
tame mans: you learn dem to be sober, live good
life, to know. God, and pray God, Alas! poor
Friday, said I, what can I do against their
161
priests of Benamuckee, or indeed what good
can I make your nation sensible of, when I
myself am but a poor ignorant man? No, no,
master, said he, i/ou be no ignorant, you teachee
me good, you teachee dem good. You shall
go without me, Friday, said I, for 1 don't care
to accompany you thither; 1 would rather
live in this solitude than venture among such
inhuman savages.
Go your way, since you desire it, and leave
me alone by myself, as 1 was before I saved
your life.
Never was an}' creature more thunderstruck
than Friday was at these words. Go me aiwy>
leave master atuay, said he, after a long*silence,
no, no, Friday die, Friday live not master gone;
as though he had said, I neither can nor will
live, if my master sends me from him. And
here I cannot but take notice of the strong
ties of friendship, which many times surpass
those of consanguinity. Friday felt towards
me the greatest gratitude, and the most sin-
cere love; he found me not only his deliverer,
but his preserver and comforter; not a severe
and ""cruel tyrant, but a kind, loving, and affa-
ble friend. He wanted for no manner of sus-
tenance; and when he was ill, or out of order,
I was his physician, not only for his body, but
his soul; and therefore no wonder was it, that
guch an innocent creature, long since divested
of his former natural cruelty, should have aai
162
uncommon concern at so cruel a separation
from me, which pierced him to the very soul,
and made him desire even to die, rather than
live without me.
After I had told Friday, in a very careless
manner, that he should be at his liberty as
soon as the boat was made, the language of
his eyes expressed all imaginable confusion;
when, immediately running to one of his
hatchets, which he used to wear as a defensive
weapon, he gives it into my hand, with a heart
so full, that he could scarcely speak. Friday,
said I, what is it you. mean? what must I do
with this? Only kill Fridaysaid he, Friday
care not live long. But what must I kill you
for? replied I again. Ah, dear master, xvhat
made you Friday save from eat a me up, so keep
long Friday, make Friday love God, and not
love Benamuckeey and notv Friday send away,
never see Friday more* As though the poor
creature had said, Alas, my dearest kind mas-
ter, how comes it to pass, that, after having
ventured your precious life to save me from
the jaws of devouring cannibals like myself,
after such a tender regard to provide for me
such a comfortable nourishment, and continu-
ing so long a kind master, and a most sincere
friend; and after making me forsake the false
notion of an Indian deity, and worship the
true God in spirit and in truth; after all this,
how ccwnes it now, that you are willing to send
163
me away to my former course of living, by
which means undoubtedly we shall be dead
to each other; but greater must be my mis-
fortune, that I shall never behold my best
friend J have in the world any more. And
this undoubtedly though he could not express
himself so clearly, must be his sentiments;
for the tears ran down his cheeks in such a
plentiful manner, that I had much ado to re-
frain from weeping also, when I beheld the
poor creature's affection: so that I was forced
to comfort him in the best manner I could,
which I did, by telling him, if he was content
to abide with me, 1 should be ever willing to
keep him.
After Friday's grief was something abated,
more fully to convince me of his affection, he
said, 0 master, me not care to be in my nation^
leave you here, me desire nation learn goody
that's all; meaning, that his desire was for the
conversion of that barbarous people ; and that
he wished me to go with him. And indeed.
I began to desire to go also, from my lati
discourse with Friday, about these seven-
teen white bearded men, that had been driven
upon the barbarian coast; whom I designed to
join, as the only means to further our escape.
To which intent my man and I went to search
for a proper tree to fell, whereof we might
make a periagua or canoe, to undertake the
voyage; and, indeed, we were not long iu
164?
finding one fit for our purpose, there being
enough of wood in the island to have built a
fleet of large vessels, but the thing we prin-
cipally wanted, was, to get one so near the
water, that we might launch it after it was
finished, and not commit so horrid a mistake
as I had done once before.
Well, after a great search for what was best
and most convenient, Friday at last, whose
judgment in such affairs was much superior to
mine, pitches upon a kind of wood the most
fitting for it. But though my man exceeded
me in the knowledge of the most proper tree,
yet I shewed him a much better and cleaner
way to make a canoe than ever he knew before:
for he was for burning the hollow or cavity of
the tree, in order to make this boat; but I then
told him how we might do it with tools, teach-
ing him at the same time how to use them,
jvhich indeed he did very dexterously; so that
jn a month's time we finished it, making it
very handsome, by cutting the outside in the
true shape of a boat- After this it took us a
full fortnight before we could get her into the
water, which we did, as it were, inch by inch.
Upon great rollers: but when she was in, she
would have carried twenty men, with all the
ease imaginable.
As I was very well pleased, you may be
#ure at the launching of this' man of wur of
f#ine,"I was no less amazed to behold with what
16.5
dexterity my man would manage her, turn
her, and paddle her along. Well, Friday,
said I, what do you think of it now? Do
you think this will carry us over? Yes, master,
said he, me venture over xoell, though great bloxv
nmnd. But my design was yet farther, which
he was insensible of; and that to make a mast
and a sail, and that to provide her with an
anchor and cable. As to a iriast, that was
no difficult thing at all to procure: so fixing
upon a straight young cedar-tree, which I
found near the place, . great plenty of it
abounding in the island; and setting Friday
to cut it down, I gave him particular direc-
tions how to shape and order it; but as to the
sail, that I managed myself. I very well
knew I had some old ones, or pieces of sails
enough, which had lain six and twenty years
by me; but not being careful to preserve
them, as thinking I should have no occasion
to use them any move, when I came to look
over them, I found them almost all rotten;
except two; and with these I went to work,
and after a great deal of pains and awkward
tedious stitching for want of needles, at length
I finished a three-cornered ugly thing like that
we call in England a shoulder of mutton sail,
to go with a boom at bottom, and a little
small sprit at the top, like these whioh our
long-boats use, and which I very wel^ knew
how to manage; especially since it was like
166
that which I had in my patron's fishing boat,
when with my boy Xury, I made my escape
from the barbarian shore.
It was near two months, I think, before I
completed this work, that is, the rigging, and
fitting my mast and sails; and indeed they
were nicely done, having made a small stay*
and a sail, or foresail to it, to assist, if we
should turn to the westward; and, which was
still more, I fixed a rudder to the stern of her,
to steer with; and though I was but a very
indifferent shipwright, yet, as I was sensible
of the great usefulness and absolute necessity
of a thing like this, I applied myself to it with
such a constant application, that at last I ac-
complished my design; but what with the many
dull contrivances I had about it, and the failure
of many things, it cost me as much pains in.
ordering as in making the boat. Besides
when all this was done, I had my man to
teach what belonged to its navigation; for
though he very well understood how to pad-
dle a canoe alone, he was an utter stranger to
a sail and a rudder, and was amazed when he
saw me work the boat to and again in the sea,
by them, and how the sail gibbed and filled
this way or that way, as the course we sailed
changed. After some time, and a little use,
I made all these things very familiar to him,
so that he became an expert sailor, except in
relation to the compass, and that I could make

him understand but little of. But as it hap-
pened, there was seldom occasion for it, there
being but little cloudy weather, and scarce
any fog in those parts; the stars were always
visible in the night and the shore by day, ex-
cept in the rainy season, which confined every
one to his habitation. Thus entered into the
seven and twentieth year of my reign or cap-
tivity, which you please, (the last three of
which, blessed with the company of my m&n
Friday, ought not to be reckoned) I kept the
anniversary of my landing here with the same
thankfulness to God, for his tender mercies,
as I did before: and certainly, as I had great
cause for thankful acknowledgment for my
deliverance at first; I had much greater now
for such singular and additional testimonies of
the care of Providence over me, in all my dis-
tresses of both body and mind, and the great
hopes I had of being effectually and speedily
delivered; for I had a strong impression upon
my mind, that I should not be another year
in this island. But, however, I still continued
on with my husbandry, digging, planting, and
fencing, as usual; gathering and curing my
grapes, and doing all other things that were
necessary,
And now the rainy season beginning to
come on, obliged me to keep the longer within
doors; but before this, 1 brought my new ves-
sel into the creek, where I had landed mj
168
rafts trom the ship; so we waited for the?
months of November and December, in which
I designed to venture over the ocean.
No sooner did the seasonable weather be-
gin to draw near, but so much was I elevated
with this new designed adventure, that 1 daily
prepared for the voyage. The first thing I
thought on was, to lay by a certain quantity of
provisions, as a sufficient store for such an
expedition, intending in a week or a fort-
night's time to open the dock, and launch out
the boat for that purpose. But one morning
as I was very busy upon something necessary
for this occasion, I called Friday to me, and
bid him to go to the sea shore, and see if he
could find a turtle or tortoise, a thing which
we commonly had once a week, as much upon
account of the eggs, as for the sake of the
flesh. He had not been long gone, but he
came running back, as though he was pur-
sued for life, and as it were flew over my
outer wall, or fence, like one that felt not the
ground, or steps he set his feet on; before I
had time to enquire the reason of his precipi-
tation, he cries out, 0 dear master, 0 sorrow!
sorrow! Bad! 0 bad / Why, what's the
matter, Friday? said I. 0, yonder yonder,
said he, there be one, two, or three canoes! two,
three.
Surely (thought I) there must be six, by my
man's way of reckoning; but on a stricter en*
169
quiry, I found there were but three, -Wei?,
Friday, said I, don't be terrified. I warrant
you we will defend ourselves against them.-—
But though I comforted him in the best man-
ner I could, the poor creature trembled so,
that I scarce knew what to do with him: 0,
master, said he, they come look Friday, cut
pieces Friday, cut a me up.
Why, Friday, said I, they will eat me up,as
well as you, and my danger is as great as-
yours. But since it is so, we must resolve to
fight for our lives. What say you? can you
fight, Friday? Yes, said he, very faintly, me
shoot, me kill what I can, but there come great
many number\ That's no matter, said I again,
our guns will terrify those that we do not kill;
I am very willing to stand by you to the lasS
drop of my blood.
Now, tell me, if you will do the like by me,
and obey my orders in whatsoever I command?
Friday then answered, 0 master, me lose life
for you, me die when you hid die. Thus con-
cluding all questions concerning his fidelity,
immediately I fetched him a good dram of
rum, (of which I had been a very good hus-
band) and gave it him to comfort his heart.
After he had drank it, I ordered him to take
the two fowling pieces, which we always car-
ried, and load them with large swan shot, as
big as* small pistol bullets; then I took foui?
muskets and loaded them with two slugs, and
170
five small bullets each; charging my two pis-
tols each with a brace, I hung ray great sword,
as customary, naked to my side, and gave Fri-
day his hatchet, as a most excellent' weapon
for defence.
Thus prepared, I thought as well of myself
as any knight-errant that ever handled a sword
and spear. I took my perspective glass, and
went up to the side of the hill, to see what I
could discover; and 1 perceived very soon, by
my glass, that there were one and twenty sa-
vages, three prisoners and three canoes, and
their chief concern seemed to be the trium-
phant banquet upon the three poor human
bodies, a thing which by this time I had ob-
served was very common with them. Upon
which I called to Friday; and shewing him a
great tree, that was just at the corner of the
wood, near which they were, I ordered him to
repair thither, and bring me word, if he could.
plainly perceive their actions; accordingly, he
did as I commanded him, and came back with
this melancholy story, that they were all about
their fire, eating the flesh of one of their pri-
soners; and that another lay bound upon the
sand, a little distant from them, which they de-
signed for their next sacrifice; and this he
told me, was not one of their nation, but one 
of those very bearded men, who was driven by
a storm into their country, and whom he had
so often spoken to me about. You may be
171
sure, that upon hearing this, ray soul was
read}7 to sink within me: when ascending up
into a tree I saw plainly, by my glass, a white
man, who lay upon the beach of the sea, with
his hands tied with flags or things resembling
rushes, being covered with clothes, and seem-
ed to be an European. From the tree where I
took this prospect I perceived another tree,
and a thicket beyond it, about fifty yards
nearer to them than where I was, which, by
taking a small circle round, I might come at
undiscovered, and then I should be within half
a shot of these devourers. And this consider-
ation made me withhold my passion, though I
was enraged to the highest degree imaginable;
when going back about twenty paces, I got
behind some bushes, which held all the way
till I came to the other tree; and then I as-
cended to a little rising ground, not above
eighteen yards distance, and there I had a full
view of these creatures, and could perceive
all their actions.
Such a sight did then appear, as obliged
me not to lose a moment's time. No less than
nineteen of these dreadful wretches sat upon
the ground, close huddled together, express-
ing all the delight imaginable at so barbarous
an entertainment; and they had just sent the
other two to murder this poor unhappy Chris-
tian, and bring bim limb by limb to their fire;
for they were then just going to untie the
K 2
172
bands from his feet, in order for death, as the
fetters are knocked oft' the malefactors before
they go to the place of execution. Hereupon,
immediately turning to my man, Now, Friday,
feaid I, mind what I say, fail in nothing, but do
exactly as you see me do. All which he pro-
mising he would perform, I set down one of
my muskets, and the fowling piece upon the
ground, and Friday did the same by his; and
with the other musket I took my aim at the
savages, bidding him to do the like: Are you
ready, said I; Yes master, said he, why then
fire at them said I; and at that very moment
I gave fire likewise.
I only killed one and wounded two ; but my
man Friday, taking his aim much better than
I, killed two, and wounded three. You may
be-sure they were in a dreadful consternation,
at such an unexpected disaster; and those
who had yet escaped our penetrating shot,
immediately jumped upon their feet, but were
in such a confusion, that they knew not which
way to run or look; not knowing from whence
their destruction came. We threw down our
pieces, and took up others, giving a second
dreadful volley; but as they were loaded only
with swan shot, or small pistol bullets, we
perceived only two of them fall; though many
were wounded, who ran yelling and screaming
abour like max} creatures. Now, Friday, said
I, lay down your piece, and take up the mus-
ket, and follow me. He did so, with great
173
z courage, when shewing ourselves to the sa-
vages, we gave a great shout, and made directly
to the poor victim, who would have been sa-
crificed, had not our first fire obliged the
butchers, with three others, to jump into a
canoe. By my order, Friday fired at them,
at which shot I thought he had killed them
all, by reason of their falling to the bottom of
the boat; however he killed two and mortally
wounded a third. In the mean time I cut the
flags that tied the hands and feet of the poor
creature, and lifting him up, asked him in the
Portuguese tongue What hexcas? he answered
me in Latin, Christianus: but so very weak
and faint that he could scarce stand or speak.
Immediately I gave him a dram and a piece of
bread to cherish him, and asked him, What
countryman he was? He said Fspaniola, aaid
then uttered all the thankfulness imaginable
for his deliverance. Signior, (said I with as
much Spanish as I was master of) let us talk
afterwards but fight now; here, talre this
sword and pistol, and do what you can. And
indeed, he did so with such courage and in-
trepidity, that he cut two of them to pieces
in an instant. I ordered Friday to run for
those pieces we had left at the tree, which
he brought me with great swiftness, and then
I gave him my musket, while I loaded the rest.
But now there happened a fierce encounter
between the Spaniard and one of the savages,
K 3
174
who made at him with one of their wooden
swords; and though the former was as brave
as could he expected, having twice wounded
his enemy in the head; yet being weak and
faint, the Indian had thrown him upon the
ground, and was wresting my sword out of
his hand, which the Spaniard very wisely
quitting, drew out his pistol, and shot him
through the body before I could come near
him though I was running to his assistance.
As to Friday, he pursued the flying wretches
with his hatchet, dispatching three, but the
rest were too nimble for him. The Spaniard
taking one of the fowling pieces, wounded
two, whom running into the wood, Friday pur-
sued and killed; but the other, notwithstand-
ing his wounds, plunged himself into the sea,
arid swam to those who were left in the canoe,
which with one wounded, were all that escaped
out of one and twenty. The account is as
followsv:

The savages in the canoe worked very hard
to get out of oar reach, and Friday was as
eager in pursuing them; and, indeed, I was
no less anxious about their escape, lest, after
the news had been carried to their people,
they should return in multitudes, and destroy
us. So being resolved to pursue them, I
jumped into one of their canoes, and bid Fri-
day follow me; but no sooner was I in, than,
to my surprise, I found another poor creature,
bound hand and foot for the slaughter, just
as the Spaniard had been, with very little life
in him. Immediately I unbound him, and
would have helped him up; but he could nei-
ther stand nor speak but groaned so piteously,
as thinking he was unbound in order to be
slain. Hereupon 1 bid Friday speak to him,
and tell him of his deliverance; when pulling
out my bottle, I made the poor wretch drink a
dram, which, with the joyful news he had re-
ceived, so revived his heart, that he .sat up in
the boat. As soon as Friday began to hear
him speak, and look more fully in his face, it
would have moved any one to tears to perceive
his uncommon transports of joy; for he kissed,
embraced him, hugged him, cried, laughed,
hallooed, jumped about, danced, sung, then
cried again, wrung his hands, beat his face
and head, then sung and jumped about again,
like a distracted creature: so that it was a
great while before 1 could make him speak to
17G
me, or tell me what was the matter with him;
but when he came to the liberty of his speech,
at last he told me it was his father.
Here indeed I was infinitely moved to see
that dutiful and tender affection this poor sa-
vage had to his aged parent. He would sit
down by him in the boat, open his breast, and
hold his father's head close to his bosom, half
an hour together, to cherish him : then he took
Ms arms and ancles, which were stiff and numb-
ed, with binding, and chafed and rubbed them
•with his hands; by which means, perceiving
-what the case was, I gave him some rum, which
proved of great benefit, to him.
While we were busy in this action, the sa-
vages had gotten almost out of sight; and
happy it was we did not pursue them: For
there arose from the north west, which con-
tinued all night long, such a violent storm, that
I could not suppose otherwise but that they
were all drowned. After this I called Friday
to me, and asked him, if he had given his fa-
ther any bread? He shook his head, and said,
None., not one bit, me eat a up all; sq I gave him
a cake of bread out of a little pouch I carried
for this end. 1 likewise gave a dram for him-
self and two or three bunches of raisins for his
father. Both these he carried to him, for he
would make him drink the dram to comfort
liitm
Away he then runs out of the boat as if he
177
was bewitched, with such an extraordinary
swiftness, that he was out of sight as it were
in an instant; but, at his return I perceived
him slacken his pace, because he had some-
thing in his hand. And this I found to be, as
he approached nearer, an earthen jug with
some water for his father, with two more cakes
of bread, which he delivered into my hands.
Being very thirsty myself, I drank some of the
water, of which w^hen his father had drunk suf-
ficiently, it more revived his spirits than all the
rum I had given him.
I then called Friday to me, and ordered him
to carry the Spaniard one of the cakes, and
some water, who was reposing himself upon a
green place under the shade of a tree, but so
weak, that though he exerted himself, he could,
not stand upon his feet. Upon which I ordered
Friday to rub and bathe his ancles with rum,
as he did his father's. But every minute he
was employed in this he would cast his eyes
towards the boat, where he left his father
sitting; who suddenly disappearing, he flew
like lightning to him, and finding he only laid
himself down to ease his limbs, he returned
back to me presently, and then I spoke to tha
Spaniard to let Friday help him, and led him
to the boat, in order to be conveyed to my
dwelling, where I would take care of him.
Upon which Friday took him upon his back,
and so carried him to the caijoe, setting him
178
close by his father; and presently stepping out.
again, launched the boat off, and paddled it
along the shore faster than I could walk, though
the wind blew very hard too; and having
brought them safe to the creek, away he runs
to fetch the other canoe, which he brought to
the creek almost as soon as I got to it by land,
when wafting me over, he took our newr guests
out of the boat; but. so weak were they, that
I was forced to make a kind of a hand-barrow;
and when I came to my castle, not being wil-
ling to make an entrance into my wall, we
made them a handsome tent, covered with old
sails, and boughs of trees, making two good
beds of rice straw, writh blankets to lie upon
and cover them. Thus, like an absolute king,
over subjects who owed their lives to me, I
thought myself very considerable.
To get provisions for my poor weak subjects,
I ordered Friday to kill me a yearling goat;
which when he had done, I cut off the hinder
quarters and chopping it into small pieces,
boiled and stewed it putting barley and rice
into the broth. This 1 carried into their tent,
set a table, dined with them myself, and en-
couraged them. Friday was my interpreter to
his father, and indeed to the Spaniard too,
who spoke the language of the savages pretty
well. After dinner I ordered Friday to fetch
home all our arms from the field of battle, and
the next day to bury the dead bodies, which he
did accordingly.
179
And now I made Friday enquire of his fa-
ther whether he thought those savages had
escaped the late storm in their canoe; and if
so, whether they would not return with a force
too great for us to resist? He answered, that
he thought it impossible they could outlive the
storm: or if they were driven southwardly*
they would come to a land where they would
as certainly be devoured, as if they were
drowned in the sea. And suppose they had ,
attained their own country, the strangeness of
their fatal and bloody attack, would make them
tell their people, that the rest of them were
killed by thunder and lightning, not by the
hand of man, but by two heavenly spirits
(meaning Friday and me) who were sent from
above to destroy them. And this, he said,
he knew, because he heard them say the same
to one another. And indeed he was in the
right on't; tor I have heard since, that these
four men gave out, that whoever went to that
in chanted island, would be destroyed by fire
from the gods.
No canoes appearing some time after, as I
expected, my apprehensions ceased; Instead
of which my former thoughts of a voyage cook
place, especially when Friday's father assured
me I should have good usage in his nation. As
to the Spaniard, he told me that sixteen more
of his countrymen, and Portuguese,, who had
been shipwrecked made their escape thither;
180
that though they were in union with the sa-
vages, yet they were very miserable for want
of provisions and other necessaries. When I
asked him about the particulars of his voyage,
he answered, that their ship was bound from
JRio de la Plata to the Havannah; that when
the ship was lost, only five men perished in the
ocean; the rest having saved themselves in the
boat, were now landed on the main continent.
And what do they intend to do there? said I.
• He replied, they have concerted measures to
escape by building a vessel, but that they had
neither tools nor provisions, so that all their
designs came to nothing. Supposing (said I)
1 should make a proposal, and invite them here,
would they not carry me prisoner to Nexv Spaiii?
he answered no; for he knew them to be such
honest men, as would scorn to act with such
inhuman baseness to their deliverer: That if I
pleased, he and the old savage would go over
to them, talk with them about it, and bring me
an answer: That they should all swear fidelity
to me as their leader, upon the holy sacrament;
and, for his part, he would not only do the
same, but stand by me to the last drop of his
blox)d, should there be occasion.
These solemn assurances made me resolve to
grant them relief, and to send these two over
for that purpose; but when every thing was
ready, the Spaniard raised an objection, which
carried a great deal of weight in it: You know,
181
Sir, said he, that having been so?ne lime with
you, I cannot but be sensible of your stock of rice
and corfi, sufficient, perhaps, for us at present,
but not for them, should they come over pre-
sently; much less to victual a vessel for an in-
tended voyage. Want might be as great an oc-
casion for them to disagree and rebel, as the chil-
dren of Israel did against God himself, when they
wanted bread in the wilderness. And, therefore9
?ny advice is, to wait another harvest, and in the
mean time, cultivate and imp-ove some more land9
whereby we may have plenty qf provisions, in or-
der to execute our design.
This advice of the Spaniard's I approved ex-
tremely; and so satisfied was I of his fidelity,
that I esteemed him ever after. And thus we
all four went to work upon some more land, and
against seed-time we had gotten so much cured
and trimmed up, sufficient to sow 22 bushels of
barley on, and 16 jars of rice, which was in
short all the seed we had to spare. As we
were four in number, and by this time all in
good health, we feared not an hundred of In-
dians, should they venture to attack us; and
while the corn was growing, I pitched upon
some trees, fit to build us a large vessel, in
case the Spaniards came over; which being
marked, I ordered Friday and his father to cut
them down, appointing the Spaniard, who was
now my privy counsellor, to oversee and direct
the work, I likewise encreased my flocks pf
182
goats, by shooting the wild dams, and bring-
ing home th£ir kids to my inclosure: Nor did
I neglect the grape-season, but cured them as
usual, though I had such a quantity now, as
would have filled 80 barrels with raisins.
And thus all of us being employed, they in
working, and I in providing for them, till har-
vest came, God Almighty blessed the encrease
of it so much, that from twenty-two barrels
of barley, ive threshed out two hundred and
twenty, and the like quantity of rice,'suffi-
cient to victual a ship fit to carry me and all the
{Spaniards to any part of America.
Thus the principal objection being answered,
by a sufficient stock of provisions, I sent my
,4wo ambassadors over to the main land, with a
regal authority to administer the oaths of alle-
giance and fidelity, and have an instrument
signed under their hands, though I never asked
whether they had pen, ink or paper; when giv-
ing each of them a musket with eight charges
of powder and ball, and provisions enough for
eight days, they sailed away with a fair gale,
0}\ a day when the moon was at full.
Scarce a fortnight had passed over my head;
but, impatient for their return, I laid me down
to sleep one'morning, when a strange accident
happened, which was ushered in by my man's
coming running to me, and calling aloud, Mas-
ter, master, they are come, they are come* Upon
which? not dreaming of any danger, out I jump*
185
ed from my bed, put on my clothes, and hur-
ried through my little grove; when looking to-
wards the sea, I perceived a boat about a league
and a half distant standing in for the shore,
with the wind fair. I beheld they did not come
from the side where the land lay on, but from,
the southernmost end of the island. So these
being none of the people we wanted, I ordered
Friday to lie still, till such time as I came down
from the mountain, which, with my ladder 1
now ascended, in order to discover more fully
what they,were; and now, with the help of my
perspective glass, I plainly perceived an English
ship, which I concluded it to be, by the fa-
shion <?f its long-boat; and, which filled me
with such uncommon transports of joy, thatfj
cannot tell how to describe; and yet some se-
cret doubts hung about me, proceeding from'I
know not what cause, as though I had reason
to be qii my guard.
Not long it was, before I perceived the boat
to approach the .shore, as though they looked
for a plaee where they might conveniently land;
and at last they ran their boat on shore upon
the beach, about half a mile's distance; which
proved so much the happier for me, since, had
they come into the creek, they had landed just
at my door, and might not only have forced me
out of my castle, but plundered me of all I
had in the world. Now I was fully convinced
they were all Englishmen, three of whom were
L 2
184
unarmed and bound; when immediately the
first four or five leaped on shore, and took
those three out of the boat as prisoners; one
of whom I could perceive used the most pas-
sionate gestures of entreaty, affliction and de-
spair, while the others, in a lesser degree,
shewed abundance of concern.
Not knowing the meaning of this, I beckon-
ed to Friday, who was below to ascend the
mountain, and likewise view this sight. O mas-
ter, said he to me, you see English mans eat
prisoners as well as Savage mans. And do you
think they will eat them, Friday? said L Yes,
said Friday they eat a all up. No, no, said I,
Friday, I am much more concerned lest they
murder them; but as for eating them up, that
I am sure they will never do.
And now I not only lamented my misfortune
in not having the Spaniard and Savage with
me, but also that I could not come within shot
of them unperceived, (they having no fire arms
among them) and save these three men, whom
I thought they were going to kill with their
swords. But some comfort it was to me, that
I perceived they were set at liberty to go where
they pleased, the rascally seamen scattering
about as though they had a mind to see the
place: and so long did they negligently ram-
ble, that the tide had ebbed so low, as to leave
the boat aground. Nor were the two men
that were in her more circumspect: for having
185
drunk a little too much liquor, they fell fast
asleep; but one of them waking before the
other, and perceiving the boat too fast aground
for his strength to move it, he hallooed out to
the rest, who made all possible expedition to
come to him; but, as Providence ordered it,
all their force was ineffectual to launch her,
when I could hear them speak to one another,
Why, Let her alone, Jack, cant ye, shell fioat
next tide: by which words I was fully con-
vinced they were my own countrymen. I this
while lay very quiet, as being fully sensible
it could be no less than ten hours before the
boat would be afloat, and then it would be so
dark, that they could not easily perceive me,
by which means I should be at more liberty to
hear their talk, and observe all their motions;
not but that I prepared for my defence: yet
as I had another sort of enemy to combat with,
I acted with more caution. I took two fusees
on my shoulder, and gave Friday three mus-
kets; besides, my formidable goat skin, and
monstrous cap, made me look as fierce and ter-
rible as Hercules of old, especially when two
pistols were stuck in my belt, and my naked
sword was hanging by my side.
The three poor distressed creatures, to0
anxious to' got anjr repose, were, however,
seated under the shade of a great tree, about
& quarter of a mile from me.
186
Upon which, without any more ado, I ap7
preached towards them, with my man follow-
ing behind me, and, before I was perceived, I
called aloud to them in Spanish, what are ye
gentlemen?
At these words they started up in great con-
fusion, when they beheld the strange figure I
made; they returned no answer, but seemed as
if they would fly from me: Gentlemen, (said I
in English) dorit be afrai^, perhaps you have a
friend nearer than you esppcU He must be
from Heaven, said one of them, gravely pulling
off his hat, for we are past all help in this
world. All help is from Heaven, said I, but Sir,
as I have perceived every action between you and
these brutes since yofir landing, only inform me
how to assist you, and I will do it to the utmost
of my power* •
Am I talking with God or man? said he, in
melting tears. Are you of humar^ kind, or an
angel? Sir, said I, my poor habit will tell you
I am a man, and an Englishman, %v%lling to
assist you, having but this servant only, here ar^
mrms and ammunition: tell freely your condi-
iio?i, can tye save you? The story, said he, is
too long to relate, since our butchers are so
#ear: but, Sir, I was master of that ship, my
men have mutinied, and it is as a favour they
J?ave put my mate, this passenger, and me, on
shore without murdering us, though we expect
nothing but perishing here. Are your enemies
187
gone? said I. No, replied he (pointing to a
thicket,) there they lie, while my heart trem-
bles, lest, having seen and heard us, they should
murder us all. Have they fire-arms? said I.
They have but two pieces, said he, one of
which is left in the boat. He also told me,
there were two enormous villains amongst
them, that were the authors of this mutiny,
who, if they were killed or seized, might in-
duce the rest to return to their obedience.
Well, well, said I, let us retire farther under
the covering of the woods; and there it was I
made these conditions with him.
I. That while they staid in the island, they
should not pretend to any authority; but should
entirely conform to my drSers, and return me
the arms which I put into their hands.
II. That, if the ship was recovered, they
should afford Friday and myself our passage
gratis to England.
When he had given me all the satisfaction I
could desire, I gave him and his two compa-
nions each of them a gun, with powder and
ball sufficient, advising them to fire upon them
while they were sleeping. The Captain rao»
destly said, that he was sorry to kill them;
though, on the other hand, to let these villainy
escape, wh© were all authors of his misery,
might be the ruin of us all.—Well, said he, do
as you think fit: and so accordingly I fired,
killed one of the Captain's chief enemies, and
188
wounded the other, who eagerly called for as-
sistance; but the Captain (who had reserved
his piece) coming up to him, Sirrah, said he,
His too late to call, for assistance, you should ra-
ther cry to God to pardon your villainy: and s<>
knocked him down with the stock of his gun ,
three others were also slighty wounded, who,
at my approach, cried out for mercy. This,
the Captain granted, upon condition that they
would swear to be true to him in recoveiing
the ship, whi$h they solemnly did: however!
obliged the Captain t<rkeep them bound. After
which I sent Friday and the Captain's mate to
secure the boat and bring away the oars and
sail; when the men, seeing their late distressed
Captain, now their conqueror, submittal tp be
bound also. And then it was, that having
more liberty, I related the adventures, of my
whole life, whicb he heard with a serious at-
tention. After this I carried him and his twp
companions into my little fortified castle, shew-,
ed them all my conveniences, and, when thi'st
was over, we began to consider about regain^
ing the ship: he said that there were twenty
six hands on board, who knowing their live%
were forfeited by the law, for conspiracy and
mutiny, were so very hardened, that it would
be dangerous for our*£mall company to attack
them. This was a reasonable inference, in-
deed; but something we must resolve on, and
fjprqediately put in execution: we therefore
.-3,
lieaved the boat upon the beach so high that"***'
she could not shoot off at high water mark, and
"broke a hole in her not easy to be stopped; so
that all the signals they gave for the boat to
come son board were in vain. This obliged
them to send another boat ashore, with ten
men^irmed, whose faces the Captain plainly
descried, the boatswain being the chief offi-
cer; but he said there were.three honest lads
among them, who were foiled into the conspi-
racy. Hereupon I gave him fresh courage,
(for I had perceived he was in concern) in the
mean while securing our prisoners, except two,
whom we took to our assistance, we thought
ourselves able enough to endure a battle.
When the sailors lande1|, and beheld their
boat in that condition, %ey not only hallooed,
but fired, for their ^coinpanior^g to hear, yet
they received no answer.. This struck them
with horror and amazement, thinking their
companions were murdered, they made as if
they would return to the ship. I could per-
ceive the Captain's countenance change at this>
till, of a sudden three men were ordered to
look after the boat, while the other seven leapt
on shore, in order to search for their compa-
nions: and, indeed, they came to the brow 0?*'
the hill, near jmy antient castle, from whence
they couteNee to a great distance in the wToods,
and there shouting and hallooing till tired and
wea:"\, thev at length seated themselves under

near as possible; and, when the boatswain ap-
proached in sight, so eager was the Captain,
that he fired, and killed him on the spot; Fri-
day wounded the next man, and a third ran
away. Hereupon I advanced with my whole
army; and, it being dark, I ordered the man.
we had surprised in the boat, to call them by
their names, and to parley with them. Ac-
cordingly he called out aloud Tom Smithy Tom
Smith/ He answered, Who's that; Robinson*
answered the other, For GocPs sake, Torn, sur-
render immediately, or yoiCre all dead men.
Who must we surrender to? says Smith. To
our Captain and ffty men here, who have taken
vie prisoner, wounded Will Frye, and killed the
hoaUwain. Shall we have quarters then? said
he. Hereupon the Captain calls out, You
Smith, you know my voice, surrender immedi-
ately, and you shall have your lives granted^
except Will Atkins. Hereupon Atkins cries
out, What, have 1 done, Captain, more than the
rest, who have been as bad as me; but that was
a lie, for he was the person that laid hold of
him, and bound him. However he was or-
dered to submit to the governor's mercy, for
such was I called. And so laying down their
arms, we bound them all and seized on their
boat,
After this, the Captain expostulated with
them, telling them that the governor was an
^Englishman, who might execute them th^re^
192
hat he thought they would be sent to England,
except Will Atkins, who was ordered to pre-
pare for death next morning. Hereupon At-
kins implored the Captain to intercede for his
life, and the rest begged they might not be
sent to England, This answered our project
for seizing the ship. For after sending Atkins,
and two of the worst, fast bound to the cave,
and the rest being committed^to my bower, I
sent the Captain to treat with them in the go-
vernor's name, offering them pardon if they
would assist in recovering the ship. Upon
which they all promised to stand by him till
the last drop of their blood; and whoever
acted treacherously should be hanged in chains
upon the beach. They were all released on
these assurances: and then the Captain re-
paired to the other boat, making his passenger
Captain of her, and gave him four men well
armed; while himself, his mate, and five more,
went in the other boat. By midnight they came
within call of the ship, when the Captain or-
dered Robinson to hail her, and tell them that
with great difficulty they had found the men at
last. But while they were discoursing, the
Captain, his mate, and the rest entered, and
knocked down the second mate, and carpenter,
secured those that were upon the deck, by
putting them under hatches, while the other
boat's crew entered and secured the forecastle;
they then broke into the round house, whera 3

ilje mate, after some resistance, shot the pirate
Captain through the head, upon which all the
rest yielded themselves prisoners. And thus
the ship being, recovered, the joyful signal
was fired, which 1 heard with the greatest joy
imaginable: nor was it long before he brought
the ship to an anchor at the creek's mouth,
where coming to-me unawares, There, says he,
my dearest friend and deliverer, there is your
ship, and tve are your servants; a comfort so
unspeakable, as made me swoon in his arms,
while, with gratitude to heaven, we were ten-
derly embracing each other.
Nothing now remained, but to consult what
we should do with the prisoners, whom he
thought it was not safe to take on board.
Hereupon concerting with the Captain, I
dressed myself in one of his suits, and sending
for them, told them, that as I was going to
J.eave the island with all my people, if they
would tarry there, their lives should be -spared;
if not, they should be hanged at the first port
they came to. They agreed to stay. Here-
upon I told them my whole story, charging
them to be kind to the Spaniards that were ex-
pected, gave them all my arms, and informing'
them of every thing necessary for their subsist-
ence, I and my man Friday went on b.oard.
But the next morning two of the men came
.swimming to the ship's side, desiring the Cap-,
tain to take them on board, though he hanged
them afterwards, complaining mightily how bar-
barously the others used them. Upon which I
prevailed with the Captain to take them in; and
being severely whipt and pickled, they proved
more honest for the future. And so I bid fare-
well to this island, carrying along with me my
money, my parrot, umbrella, and goat skin cap;
setting sail December 12, 1668, after twenty-
eight years, two months, and nineteen days re-
sidence, and landing in England, June 11,1687,
after five and thirty years absence from my
own country, which rendered me altogether a
stranger there.
FINIS,
VERSES
SUPPOSED TO BE WRITTEN BY ALEX. SELKIRK,
DURING HIS SOLITARY ABODE IN THE
ISLAND OF JUAN FERNANDEZ;
IN WHICH HE HAD LIVED QUITE ALONE
DURING UPWARDS OF FOUR YEARS.
I.
I AM monarch of all I survey,
My right there is none to dispute;
From the centre all round to the sea,
I am lord of the fowl and the brute.
Oh, Solitude! where are the charms
That sages have seen in thy lace?
Better dwell in the midst of alarms,
Than reign in this horrible place.
II.
I am out of humanity's reach,
I must finish my journey alone,
Never hear the sweet music of speech;
I start at the sound of my own.
The beasts, that roam over the plain,
My form with indifference see;
They are so unacquainted with man,
Their tameness is shocking to me.
Society, friendship, and love,'
Divinely bestow'd upon man,
Qh, had I the wings of a dove,
How soon would I taste you again I
My sorrows I then might assuage
In the ways of religion and truth,
Might learn from the wisdom of age,
And be cheer'd by the sallies of youth.
Religion! what treasure untold
Resides in that heavenly word!
More precious than silver ana* gold, t
Or all that this earth can afford.
But the sound of the summoning bell
These vallies and rocks never heard,
Ne'er sigh'd at the sound of a knell,
Or smil'd when a sabbath appear'd.
V.
Ye winds, that have made me your sport,
Convey to this desolate shore
Some cordial endearing report
Of a land I shall visit no nfotc..
My friends, do they now and then send
A wish or a thought after me?
Q tell me I yet have a friend,
Though a friend I am never to see.
VI.
How fleet is*a glance of the mind!
Compared with the speed of* its flight,
The tempest itself lags behind,
And the swift winged arrows of light
When I think of my own native land,
In a moment I seem to be there;
But, alas! recollection at hand
Soon hurries me back to despair.
VII.
But the sea-fowl is gone to her nest.
The beast is laid down in his lair,
Ev'n here is a season of rest,
And I to my cabin repair.
There's mercy in every place;
And mercy, encouraging thought!
Gives even affliction a grace,
And reconciles msai to his lot.
