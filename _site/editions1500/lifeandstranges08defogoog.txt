Hands or of the Head, not fold to the Life of Sla- 
very for daily Bread, or harrafs'd with perplexed 
Ofcomftances which rob the Soul of. Peace, and 
t^Biyiy of BeA ; not enrag'd with the Paffion of 
Enry, or fecret burning Luft of Ambition ibr great

of Circumftances or Confequences,and in anill Hour^ 
God knows, on the firft oi September 1^51, I went 
on Board a Sliip bound for Lmdm : Never any young 
Adventurer's Misfortunes, I believe, began fooner» 
or continued longer than mine. The Ship was na 
fooner gotten out of the Humbery but the Wind be- 
gan to blow, and the Sea to rife in a mbft frightful 
manner ; and as I had never been at Sea before, I was 
moft inexpreffibly fick inBody, andterrifyMin Mind: 
I began now ferioufly to refieft upon what I had 
done, and how juftly I was overtaken by the Judg* 
ment of Heaven for my wicked leaving my Father ^ 
Houfe, and abandoning my Duty ; all the good 
Counfelof my Parents, my Father's Tears, and m« 
Mother^s Entreaties came now frelh into my Mind ; 
and my Confciencc, which was not yet come to the 
Pitch of Hardnefs to which it has been fince, r©^ 
proach'd me with the Contempt of Advice, and the 
Breach of my Duty to God and my Father. 

All this while the Storm encreas'd, and the Sea^ 
which I had never been upon before,went very high, 
tho' nothing like what I have feeA many timed 
fince ; no, nor like what I faw a few Days after : 
But it was enough to afife& me then, who was but 
a young Sailor, and had never known any thing o^

Agony of Mind, I nude many Vows and Refdu^ 
tions, that if it would pleafe God l^re to fpare 
my Life this one Voyage, if ever I got once my 
Foot upon dry Land again, I would go dircdly 
home to my Father, and never fct it. into a Ship a- 
gain while I liv'd; that I would take his Advice, 
and never run my felf into fnch Miferies as diefe a- 
ny more* Now I faw plainly the Goodiiefs of his 
Obfervations about the middle Station of Life, 
how eafy, how comfortably he had liv'd all his 
I>ays, and never had been exposed to Tcmpefts at 
Sea, or Trouble^^on Shore ; and I refolv'd that I 
would, like a true repenting Prodigal, go home to 
my Father. . 

Thcfe wife and fober Thoughts continued all the 
while the Storm continued, and indeed fome time 
after ; but the next Day the Wind was abated and 
the Sea cahner, and J began to be a little innur^d 
to it : However, I was very grave for all that Day, 
being alfo a little Sea fick ftill ; but towards Night 
the Weather cleared up, the Wind was quite over, 
a charming fine Evening followed ; the Sun went 
down. perfedly clear, and rofe fo the next Morn-

Sea, the Sun ihining upon it, the Sight was, as I 
thought, the moft delightful that ever I faw. 

I had flept well in the Night, and was now no 
more Sea^ck, but very chearful, looking with 
Wonder upon the Sea that was fo rough and terri^

pleafant in fo little time after. And now Icaft my

which 1 had fo apparently trampled upon, and hai*- 
^dcn'd my felf againft: I thought the Bittemefs erf 
Death had' been paft, and that this would be ii*>-

up out of my Cabbin, and look'd out ; but fuch a

'high, and broke upon us every three or fourMf* 
nutes : When I could look about, I could fee nor 
thing but Diftrefs round us t Two Ships that rid 
near us, we found, had cut their Mafts by* the 
Board, being deep leaden,- andpurMencry*dout, 
that a Ship which rid about a Mite a-Head of us 
was foundered. Two mon? Ships being driven fix>m 
their Anchors, were run out of the Roads to Sea, 
at all Adventures, and that with not a Maft ftand-

labouring in the Sea > but two or three of them 
drove, and came clofe by us, running away with 
only their Sprit^fail out before the Wind. 

Towards Evemng the Mate and Boatfwain 
bcgg'd the Matter of our Ship to let them cut a^ 
way the Fore-maft, which he was very unwilling 
to ; But the Boatfwain proteftingto him, that if he 
did not, the Ship would founder, he confented ; 
and when they had cut away the Fore-maft, the 
Main-maft flood fo loofe, and (hook the Ship fo 
•much, they were obliged to cut her away alfo, iuid 
make a clear Deck.

tenfold more Horror, of Mind upon Accounp of my 
former Convidions, and the having returned from 
.them to the Refolutions t had wickedly taken at firft> 
than I was at Death it feif ; and thefe ^dded to the 
Terror of the Storm, put me into fuch ^ Condition, 
.that I can by no words describe it. But the woiift 
was not come yet, the Storm continued with fuch 
Fury, that the Seamen themfelves acknowledged 
they had never known a worfe. We had a good ^hip, 
but (he was deep loaden, and wallowed in the Sea, 
-that the Seamen every now and then cried out, (he 
would founder. It was my advantage in one refped> 
that I did not know what they meant by Founder, 
till I enquir'du However, the Storm was fo vior 
lent, that I faw what is not often feen, the Ma/ler^ 
the Boatfwain, and fome others more ienfible than 
the reft, at their Prayers, and cxpeding every Mo- 
ment when the Ship would go to the Bottom. In 
the Middle of the Night, and under all the reft of 
dFour Pifirefles, one of the Men that had been 
down on Purpofe to fee, cried out we had fprung a 
J,eak ; another faid there was four Foot Water in 
the Hold. Then all Hands were called to the Pump. 
At that very Word, my Heart, as I thought, died 
within me, and I fell backvs^ards upon the Side of 
jmy Bed where I fat, into the Cabin, However, 
the Men rpufed me, and told me, that I that wa;^ 
able to do nothing before,, was as well able to 
pump as another i at which I ftirr'd up, and went 
to thC'^Pump and worked very heartily. While this 
was doing, the Mafter feeing fome light Colliers, 
who not able to ride out the Storm, were obliged 
to flip^nd run- away to Sea, and would come near 
ws, ordjer-dto fire a Gun as a Signal of Diurefs. I

Head of us, ventured a Boat out to help us.. It wa? 
with theutmoft hazard the Boat came near us, but 
it was impoifible for us to get on Board, or for tbe 
Boat to lie near the Ship Side, till at \a& the M^

with a Buoy to it, and then vered it out a great 
Length, which they after great Labour an4 Hazatd^ 
took hold of, and we hawl'd them clofe under qui;

iand there, as well as on the Road, had many Strug* 
gles with my felf, what Courfe of Life Ilhould take, 
and whether I fliould go Home, or go to Sea.

had m my DeHres to a Return wote off with it, till 
at laft I quite laid afide the Thoughts of it, and 
looked out for a Voyage. 

• That evil Influence which carried me firft away 
from my Father's Houfe, that hurried me into the. 
wild and indigefted Notion of raifing my Fortune ; 
and that impreft thofe Conceits fo forciby upon 
me, as to make me deaf to all good Advigp, - and 
to the Entreaties, and even Command of my Fa*

prefented the moft unfortunate of all Enterprizes 
to my View ; and I went on Board a VelTel bound 
so the Coaft o( Africa ; or as our Sailors vulgarly 
call it, a Voyage to Guiney. 

It was my great Misfortune that in all thefe 
Adventures I did not fhip my felf as a Sailor ; 
whereby, tho^ indeed I might have worked a little 
harder than ordinary, yet k the fama time I had 
Icam'd the Duty and Office of a Fore-maft Man ; 
and in time might have qualifyM my felf for a 
Mate or Lieutenant, if not for a Mafter. But as: 
rr was always my Fate to choofe for the worfe, 
fo I did here ; for having Money in my Pocket, 
and good Cloaths upon my Back, I would always 
go on Board in the Habit of a Gentleman ; and (o 
I neither had any BuHnefsin the Ship, or learn'd 
to do any. 

It was my Lot flrft of all to fall into pretty good 
Company in London, which does not always hap-

Yet even in this Voyage I had my Misfortones

upon the Cdaft» ifrom the Latitude of 15 IJ^gcees,

and I embark'd in the fame VciTel with one who was 
his Mate in the former Voyage, and had now g06 
the Command of the Ship. This was the unhap-

not carry quite 100 /.o£ my new gain'd Wealth j

Pikes, Powder-Chefts, and fuch like, and clcar'd 
bur p^ck:of them twice. However, to cut fliort 
this melancholy Part of our Story, our Ship being 
difabkd^ and three of our Men kill'd, and eight 
woYinded, we were obliged to yield, and were; car- 
ry 'd 'all Prifoners into iSalieey a Port belonging to 
the Moors. 

The Ufage I had tlierc was not fo dreadful as at 
lirft I apprehended, nor was I carried up the Coun- 
try to the Emperor's Court, as the reft of our Men 
were; but was kept by the Captain of the Rover, 
as his proper Prize, and made his Slave, being 
young and nimble, and^fit for his Bufineis. At this 
furpriziiig Change of my Gircnmftanccs from a 
Merchant to a miferable Slave, I was pcrfeftly o- 
verwhelmed ; and now I took^d back upon my Fa-

good Meat ; but the great Joy that ippor -Sjifi/ 
came with, was to tell me he had fougdgood War 
.ter and fecn no wild Man^. , . 

But we four^d afterwards that we need not take 
fuch Pains for Water, for a little higher up the

when the Tide was out, which flowed but* .little

Haoe we had. killed, and prepared to go on Qur

Creature in tb^t part of the Country, 

As I had b^en ope Voyage to this Coaft before^ 
I knew very well that the Iflands of the Canaries,

from the Coaft. But as I had no Inflruments tp 
take an Obfervation to know what Latitude w^ 
were in, and not exaftly know, or at leafl to re-

nothing but a waft uninhabited Country, by Dayi 
and heard nothing but Howlings amd Roaring of

Once or twii»e in the Day tinae, I thought I faw

Several times I was obliged to land for frdh Wal-

Time. 

• 1 now gave ovct any mote Thoughts of the 
Ship, or of any Thing out of her, exce()t what 
might drive on Shore from her Wreck, as indeed 
'divers Pieces of her afterwards did ; but rhc^e 
Thmg$ were of t mail ufc tb me. ' 

My Thoughts were now wholly tmphy'd A- 
boatfecaring my felf either againft Savages, ifa- 
' rty fttoirld lppear,or wild Beafts, if any were iri the 
.Ifiand iatrd 1 had mafty Tho^ights of the Method 
howto dochij^nd whit kind ofO^elling to maker, 
whether 1 Ihould m^ke rate a Cave in the Earthy or 
m- Tent apon the Eirth : And, in fliort, I refoly/fl 
upon both, the Manner and Defcription of wh^ 
it may Oot beintyproper to give an Account of. 
'I t fowiibnnd the Place I was 5n was not for my 
Settlement^ particularly bccaiife it was upon a low 
"moorffli Ground near the Sea, and I beh'cv'd 
woufd not be wholefome, and more particularly 
becaufe there was no frcfh Water near it, fo I re- 
/olvM tofinda more healthy and more con venictic 
Spot of Ground. 

I confulted . fcveral Things in my Situation 
which t found would be proper for me, i ft. Health, 
'and frefli Water 1 juft now mentioned, adly, Shel- 
ter from the Heat of the Sun. 3dly, Security from 
ravenous Creatures, whether Men or Beafts. '4thly, 
a View to the Sea, that if God fcnt any Ship ip 
Sight, 1 rfiight not lofe any Advantage' for my 
Deltversince, of which I was not willing to baniih 
all myExpeftation yet. 

In fearch of a Place proper for thii, I found a

ilicrc was a hollow Place worn a little Way ki 
like the Entrance or Door of a Cave, but there was 
not really any Cave or Way into the Rock at al|. 

On the flat of the Green, juft before this hoHoJur 
Place, I refolv'd to pitch my Tent : This Plain was 
not above an hundred Yards broad, and about 
twfce as long, and lay like a Green before my 
Door, and at the End of it defcended irr^ularly 
every Way down into the low Grounds by thic 
Sea-fide. It was on the N.NilV. Side of the Hill, 
To that I was (hehet'd from the Heat every Dfty, 
till it canie to a IF. and by S. 5un, oc tfiereabouts, 
which in thofe Countries is neat the Setting, 

Before I fet up my Teiu^ I drew a halfCircIc 
before the hollow Place^ which took in about ten 
Yards in its Semi*diamcter from the Rockf and 
twenty yards in its Diameter^ from i(s Bf^inning 
and Ending. 

In this half Circle I pitched two Rows of ftrong 
Stakes, driving them into the Ground till thejr 
flood, very fit m like Pilcs^ the biggeft End being 
out of the Ground about five Foot and and anhalf^ 
and (harpen'd on the Top ; the two Rows did not 
ftand above fix Inches from one another* 

Then I took the Pieces of Cable which I bad cut 
iti the Ship, and laid them in Rows one upon 
another, within the Circle between thefe two 
Rows of Stakes, up to the Top, placing other 
Stakes in thelnfide^ leaning againft them, about 
two Foot and a half hfgb, like a Spur to a Poft, 
and this Fence was fo ffrong, that neither Man or 
Bcaft could get into ft or over it : This cpft me 
agreat deal of Time and labour, efpccially to cut 
the Piles in the Woods, bring tncra to the Place^ 
and drive them into the Earth. 

The Entrance into this Place I made to be not 
by a Door^ hit by a ihort Ladder, to go over.

which I had brought on Shore, but in a Ham*- 
^IIKk:Ic, which was indeed a very good one, and be* 
vlopg*d to the Mate of the Ship. 

Into this Tent I brought all my Proviiions, and 
every Thing that would fpoil by the Wet, and ha- 
.ving thus enclosed all my Goods, I made up the 
Entrance, which till now I had left open,* and fa 
pafs'd md repafs'd, as I (aid, by a ihort Ladder.

Stones that I dug down out thro' my Tent, I laid

This gave me not only Egrefs and Regreft, as

low a great while, now I took a Survey of it, and 
rcduc'd myfelf to one Bisket-cakc a Dayy which 
m^dc my Heart very heavy. 

May I . In the Morning looking towards the 
Sea-fide, the Tide beingiow, I fawfomechine lit 
6h the Shore bigger than ordinary 5 and it look*d 
like a Cask } when I Came to it, I found a fmati 
Barrel, and two or three Pieces of the Wreck 6( 
the Ship,- which were driven on Shore by the late 
Hurricane 5 and looking towards the Wreck itftl^ 
I thought it fcem'd to lie higher out of the Water, 
that it us'd to do ; I examined the Barret which 
was driven- on Shore, and foon found it waiS il 
Barrel of Gun-powder > but it had taken 'Watei*^ 
and the Powder was cak'd as hard as a Stone 3 how- 
ever I roird it farther on Shore for the prefent,and 
went on upon the Sands^as near as 1 could^to tht 
Wreck of the Ship to look foi- more.

^ulte ap to her when the Tide was out ; I Was fur- 

Eriz'd with this at firft, but foon concluded it muft 
e done by the Earthquake : And as by this Violence 
the Ship was more broken open than formerly, fo 
many Things came daily on Shore, which the Sea 
had lopfen'd, and which the Winds and Water rol- 
led by degrees to the Land. 

This wholly diverted my Thoughts from the 
Dcfign. of removing my Habitation J and I bufied 
myfelf mightily, that Day efpecially, in fearching 
whether I could make any way into the Ship 5 but I 
found oothine was to be expe&ed of that kind, for 
that all the Infide of the Ship was choak'd up 
with Safid i However, as I had learnt not to defpair 
of any thing, I refolv'd to pull every thing to 
piQces that 1 could of the Ship, concluding, that 
every thing I could get from her, would be of fome 
Ufc or other to me. 

. . May 3. I begun with my Saw, and cut a Piece 
of aBe$p thro', which I thought held feme of the 
upper Part or Quarter-Dcck together, and when 
I had cur it thro', I clear'd away the Sand as well 
-as I coukl from the Side which lay highefts but 
the Tide coming in, 1 was obliged to give over 
for that Time. 

May 4. I went a fifliing, but caught not one Fifli 
ihat I durft eat of, till I was weary of my Sporty 
when juft going to leave off, I caught a young 
'Dolp^n. I had made me a long Line of fome 
Rope Yarn, but I had no Hooks, yet I ^'ccfuently 
caiUght.Fiih enough, as much as I car'd to eatj 
^U which I dry'd in the Sun, and eat them dry. 
, jMacuf. Work'd on the Wreck, cut another 
.Beam jafunder, and brought three great Fir Planks

Bolts out of her, and other Pieces of Iron- work > 
work'd very hard, and Came Home Very much 
tir'd, and had Thoughts of giving it over. 

May J. Went to the Wreck again, but with ad 
Intent not to work j but found the Weight of the 
Wreck had broke itfelf down, the Beams being cut i 
that feveral Pieces of the Ship feem'd to^ie loofe^ 
and the Infide of the Hold lay fo open, that I 
could fee iqto it, but almoft full of Water and Sand. 
. May 8. Went to the Wreck, and carry*d an Iron 
Crow to wrench up the Deck, which lay novr 
quite clear of the Water or Sand^ I wrench'd open 
two Planks, and brought them on Shore ^Ifoyrith 
the Tic^e: I left the Iron Grow in the Wreck jfor 
next Day. 

May 9. Went to the Wreck,and with the CroW 
made Way into the Body of the Wrecks and felc 
fcveral Casks, and loofen'd them with the Crow^ 
but could not break them up^ I felt aMb the Roll 
of EngUJb Lead, and could (lir it, but it w^s too 
heavy to remove. 

May 10^ 1 1, 1 z, I }, 14. Went every Day to thd

of Iron.

could not cut a Piece off of the Roll of Lead$ by 
placing the Edjje of one Hatchet, and driving ic 
Vith the other > but as it lay about a Foot and a 
half in the Water^ I could not make any Blow to 
drive the Hatchet.

May 17. I faw fome pieces of the Wreck Mown 
dn Shore, at a great Diftance, near two Miles off 
me, but refolv'd to fee what they were, and found 
it was a Piece of the Head, but too heavy for mc 
to bring away. 

May 14. Every Day to this Day Iwork'd on 
the Wreck and with hard Labour I loofen'd fomc 
Things fo much with the Crow, that the firft 
blowing Tide feveral Casks floated out, and two 
of the Scamens Chefts 5 but the Wind blowing from 
the Shore, nothing came to Land that Day, but 
Pieces of Timber^ and a Hogdiead which had fome 
Brazil Pork in it, but the ^t- water and the Sand 
had fpoird it. 

I continued this Work every Day to the if th of 
June J except the Time neceflary to get Food, 
which I always appointed, during thisrartof my 
Employment, to be when the Tide was up, that I 
might be ready when it was cbb'd out j and by thi^ 
Time I had gotten Timber, and Plank, and Iron-

came to a rifing Ground, at fome Difhnce, he

the Imprdlion that remain'd upon my Mind, when 
I awak'd, and found it was but a Dream. 

I bad alas ! no divine Knowledge 5 what I had re- 
ceived by the good Inftrudion of my Father was then 
worn out by an uninterrupted Series, for 8 Years, of 
feafartng Wickednefi,' and a conilant Cooverfation 
with nothing but fuch as were like myfelf, wicked 
and propbane to the laft Degret : I do not remem- 
ber that I had in all that time one Thought chat fo 
much as tended either to looking upwards toward 
God, or inwards towards a Refleaion upon my 
own Ways : Bat a certain Stupidity of Soul, with- 
out Defire of Good, or Confcience of Evil, had en- 
tirely overwhelmed me, and I was all that the moft 
hardned, unthinking, wicked Creature among our 
common Sailors can be fuppos'd to be, not having 
the leaft Senfe, either of the Fear of God in Dan- 
ger, or ofThankfulnefsto God in Deliverances. 

In the relating what is already pad of my Story, 
this will be the more cafily believed, when I fliall 
add , that thro' all the Variety of Miferies that 
had to this Day befallen me, I never had (b miich 
as. one Thought of it being the Hand of God, or 
that it was a juft Punifhment for my Sin, my re- 
bellious Behaviour againft my Father, or my prc- 
fent Sins which were great 1 or fo much as a Puniih- 
ment for the general Courfe of my wicked Life. 
When I was on the defpei ate Expedition on the de- 
fert Shores oi Africa^ 1 never had fo much as one 
Thought of what would become of me \ or one 
Wifli to God todireft me whither I (hould go, or co 
keep me from the Danger which apparency fui- 
rounded me, as well from voracious Creatures as 
cruel Savages : But I was mecrly thoughtlefs of a 
God, or. a Providence j aftcd like a mecr Brute 
from the Principles of Nature, and by the Diftatcs 
p£ common Seme only, and indeed hardly that.

My pondition began now to be, tho^^otliefs mi-' 
fcrabfc as to my Way of living, yet much eafier 
to tny Mind j and my Thoughts being diredcd^by 
a conftanc reading the Scripture and praying to 
God, to things of a higher Natures I had agrei^t 
deal of Comforr within, which till now I knew no- 
thing of 5 alfo, as my Health and Strength returned, 
I beliir'd myfelf to furnilh myfclf with every thing 
that I wanted, and make my Way of livii^g as re- 
jgular as I could. 

From the 4th of July to the 14th, I was chiefly 
employed in n^alking ^bout with, my Gun in my 
Hand, a little and a little at aTin?e, as a Man 
that was gathering up his Strength after a Fit of 
Sicknefe: For it is hardly to be imagined, how low 
I was, and to what Weakncfs I was reduce. The 
Application which I made Ufe of was perfeftly 
new, and perhaps what had never cur'd an Ague 
before, neither can I recommend it to any one to 
praftife, by this Ejcperimcntj and tho' it did carry 
off the Fit, yet it rather contributed to weakening 
roe 5 for I had frequent Convulfions in my Nerves 
and Limbs for fome Time. 

I learnt from it alfo this in particular^ that be- 
ing abroad in the rainv Seafon was the moft pernici- 
ous thing to my Health that could be, efpecially.in 
thofe Rains which came attended with Storms gnd 
. Hurricanes of Wind > for as the Rain which came 
in the dry Seafon was always moft accompany'd 
with fuch Storms, fo I found that Rain was much 
..Jooredangerous than the Rain which fell in &^ 
tember and OSlober. 

I had been now in this u&happy liland almoft 10 

Months, all PolSbility of Deliverance from this 

Condition feem'd to be entirely taken from me^

ttiy|iabita^ipit^ as I thought^ fully to B^y Mind, I 
had agreat Dcllre to maKc a more perfed Difco- 
vcry of the Iflmd, ahd to fee what .other Prod^uc- 
lions 1 might find, which I yet knew npthing 

of- •'.:-.. 

It was the ifth o(Juty that I began to takq a 
mbre particular Survey bf the Ifland it fiflf : I went 
ug thq Creek firtt, where, as 1 hinted, I brought 
my Raft$ on Shore j .X found after Lcame about 
two Miles up, that the Tide did not flow any 
higher, and that it ^^ no more than a little 
Brook of running Water, and very frcih and good % 
but this being the dry Seafon, there was hardly any 
Water in foitie Parts of k, at leaft, not enough to 
run in any Stream, fo as it could be perceiv'd. 

On the 3ank of^this Brook I found many plea- 
fant Savana\ or Meadows, plain, ^fmooth, and 
cover'd with Grafs j and on the rifing Parts of 
them next to the higher Grounds, where the Wa- 
ter, as it might be fuppofed,^ never overflowed, 
1 found a great deal of Tobacco, green and growing 
to a great and very ftrong Stalk 5 there were di- 
vers other Plants which I had no Notion of, or Un- 
derllanding about, and might perhaps have Vir- 
tues of then* own, which 1 could not find out. 

I fearehcd for the Caffava Root, which the /»- 
dians in all that Climate make their Bread oJ^ut I 
could find none. I faw large Plants of Aloes, but 
did not then underftand thqm. 1 faw feveral Sugar 
Canes, but wild, and for want of Cultivation, im- 
perfect. I contented mjffelfwith thefe Difcoveries 
for this Time, and came back mufing with my 
felf what Courfc I might take to know the Virtue 
and Goodqefs of apy of thtj Fruits or Plants which 
I fliould difcover J but could bring it to no Con-

might ferve me to any Purpofe now in my Di(^ 
tre(5; ^ , '. . 

. The next Day, the iiith;, I went up the iarne 
Way again, and after going fomcthing farther than 
I had ^gone the Day before, I foiiiidthe Brook, and 
the Savam^s began to ceafe, and the Country be- 
came more woody than before 5 in this Part I foimd 
different Fruits, and particularly I fobnd Melons 
upon the Ground in great Abundance 5 and Grapes 
lipon the Trees j the Vines had fpread indeed over 
tbq Trees, and the Clufters* of Grapes were juft 
now in their Prime, very ripe and rich: This w^s a 
furprifing Difcoyery, and I was exceeding glad of 
them 5 but I was warn'd by my Experience to eat 
fparingly of them, remembring, that when I was 
aihore in BarAaryyfhc eating of Grapes kilPd feveral 
of oMx Englijh Men who were Slaves there, by 
throwing them into Fluxes and Fevers: But I 
found an excellent Ufe foi* the Grapes,' and that 
Wiis to cure or dry them in the Sun, and keep 
them as dry'd Grapes or Raifins are kept, which 
1 thought would be, as indeed they were, as 
wholefome as agreeable to eat, when no Grapes 
could be had. 

I fpent all that Evening there, and went not 
bacl%|to my Habitation, which t^ the way was 
the firft Night, as I might fay, I had lanrfroni 
Home. In the Night I took my firft Contrivance,

Vale, ftirveying it with a fecret Kind-of Pleafure, 
(iho' mixt with my other afflifting Thoughts) to 
think that this \vas all my own, that I was- King

had a Right of Pofleflionj and ifl could convey it, 
I might have it in Inheritance, hs .cotxtpleatly as

Abundance of Cocoa Trees, Orangi^,"'and: Le-

only plealknt to eat, but very wholefome j and I 
mix'fl their Juice afterwards with Water, which 
made \t very wMcfoipe, and very cool, ^nd re-

carry Homcj and I refolvM .to lay up a Score, as: 
well of Grapes, as Limes ?nd Lemons, to fm niflx 
m)felf for the Wet SeaTon, which I knew, was ap- 
proaching. 

In iorder to this, I gather'd a great Heap jof 
Gripe« in one Place^ and a kfler.Heap inanother 
P]«Cf:,.and a great Parcel of Limes and Lemons in: 
another Pkce 5 and taking a fpw of each \<^ithme^ 
I travell'd- homeward, and refolv'd to.Come again,

Grapes were fpoil'd,' the Richnefs of the Fruits, 
and the Weight of the Juice having broken them, 
and bruis'd them, they were good for little or no- 
thing} as. to the Limes they were good, but I 
could bring but a few. 

The next Day, being the ipth, I went back, 
having made me two fmall Bags to bring Homi^ 
my Harvcft; But I was furpriz'd, when coming 
to my Heap of Grapes, which were fo rich and 
fine when I gathered them, I found them all fprcad 
about, trod to Pieces, and drag'd about, fomc 
here, foroe there, and ^Abundance eaten and de- 
vour'd : By this I concluded, there were fome wild 
Creatures thereabouts, which had done this j- but 
what thcy,were I knew not. 

However, as I found that there was no laying 
them up on Heaps, and no carrying them away in 
a Sack, but that one Way jthey would be deftroy'd, 
and the other way they would be crufh^d with 
their own Weight, I took another Courfe > for I 
gathered a large Quantity of the Grapes, and hung 
them up upon the out Branches of the Trees, that 
they might cure and dry in the Sun 5 and as for 
the Limes and Lemons, I carry'd as mai)y back a^ 
I could well Itand under. 

- When I came Home f]j*om this Journey 5 I con- 
templated with great Pleafure the Frujtfulnefs of 
that Valky,' and the Pleafantnefs of the Situation, 
the Security from Storms on that Side the Water, 
and the Wood, and concluded, that Lhad pitch'd 
vpcw> a Place to fix my Abode, which was by far 
the worft Part of the Country. Upon the whale 
I began to confider of removing ray Habitation j 
and to look out for a Place equally fafe, as where? 
I now was fituate, if pofiibid, -in' Ih^t pkafant 
fruitful Part of the Iflatid.'

I had all this Tirht obfcrv'd no Sabbath-Day i 
for as at firll I had no Scnfe of Religion upoo my 
Mind, I had after fomc Time omitted to diftin*- 
guilh the Weeks, by making a loftger Notch thatv 
ordinary for the Sabbath-Day, and lo did not reaHy 
krfdw what any of the Days wcrC} but now having 
Caft up the Days, as ibove, I found I had been 
Ihfcre a Year^ fo I divided it into Weeks, and fet 
apart every feventh Day for a Sabbath j though I 
found at the End of my Account I had loll a Day 
6r two in my Reckoning. 

A little after this my Ink began to fail me, and 
fo I contented myfelf to ufe it more fparingly, and 
to write down only the mpft remarkable Events of 
itay Life, without continuing a daily Memorandum 
of other Things. 

The rainy Seafon, and the dry Sealbn, began now 
to appeal" regular to me, and I learnt to divide 
f him ib, as to provide for them accordingly. But 
I bought all my Experience before I had it 5 and 
this I am going to relate, was one of the moft dif- 
couraging Experiments that I made at all. I have 
mentioned that I had fav'd thfc few Ears of Barley 
And Rice, which I had fo furprizingly found fpring 
Op, as I thought, of themfdvcsi and believe there 
were about thirty Stalks of Rice, and about twenty 
of Bartey 5 and now I thought it a proper -Time 
to fow it after the Rains, the Sun being iq its 
Southern Pofition going from'ttle.. 

Accordingly I dug up a Piece of ^Ground as well 
as I could withttiy wooden Spade, and dividing it 
into two Parts, I fow'd my Graiii 5 but as I was 
fowing, it cafually occurM to iny Thoughts, that 
I -would not fow it all at firft, becaufe I did not

Accordingly the next Day I went to my Coun*

Plenty of them j thefe I fct up to dry within my 
Circle or Hedge, and when they were fit for Ufe^. 
I carried them to my Caye, and here during the 
neji^t Seafbn I employed my {elf in making, as welf

Earth, or to carry or lay up any Thing as I had 
cccafion. And tho' I did not finifh them very hand^r

I never travelrd in this Journey above two^Milcs '

Pole upon the Shore for a Mark, I concki(kd I 
would go home again ; and that the next Journey 
I took ihould be on the other Side of the Iflanfl^ 
Ea0 from my Dwelling, and fo round till I came 
to my Poft again : Of which in its Place. 

I took another Way to come back than that I 
went, thinking I could cafily keep all the Ifland (b 
much in my View, that I could not mifs finding 
my firft Dwelling by Viewing the Country; but I 
found my fclf miftaken ; for being come about two 
or three Miles, I found my felf defccnded into a 
very large Valley > but fo furroundcd with Hills, 
and thofe Hills covered with Wood, that I could 
not fee which Was my Way by any.Direftion but 
that of the Sun, nor even then, unlefslkncw very 
well the Pofition of the Sun at that Time of the 
Day. 

It happened to my farther Misfortune, Th^tthc 
Weather prov'd hazcy for three or four Days, 
while I was in this Valley j and not being able to 
fee the Sun, I wander'd about very uncomfortably, 
and at laft was obliged to find out the Se^ Side,' 
look for my Poft, and come back the lame Way I; 
went 3 and then by eafy Journeys I turn'd Home- 
ward, the Weather being exceeding hot, and my 
Gun, Ammunition) Hatchet, and other Things 
very heavy. 

In this Journey my Dog furpriz'd a young Kid, 
and feiz'd upon it, and I running in. to take hold 
of it, caught it, and fav'd it dive from the Dog : 
I had a great mind to bring it home if I could ; 
fori had often been raufing. Whether it might ndc

The rainy Scafon of the Autumnal Equinox was 
how come, and I kept the 30th of September in the 
fame folcmn manner as before, being the Anniver- 
fary of my Landing on thelfland, having now been 
there two Years, and no more Profpc6l: of being de- 
livered than the firft Day I came there. Ifpent the 
whole Day in humble and thankful Acknowledg- 
ments of the many wonderful Mercies which my So- 
litary Condition was attended with, and without 
which it might have been infinitely more miferablc. 
I gave humble and hearty Thanks that God had 
been pleafcd to difcover to me, even that it w;as 
poffiblc I might be more happy in this Solit2\i*y 
Condition, than I fhould have been in a Liberty of 
Society, and in all the Pleafurcs of the WorM. That 
He could fully make up to me the Deficiencies of 
my Solitary State, and the want of Humane So- 
ciety, by his Prefence, and the Communications of 
his Grace to my Soul, fupporting, comforting, and 
encouraging me to depend upon his Providence 
here, arid hope for his eternal Prefence hereafter. 

It was now that I began fenfibly to feel how 
much more happy this Life I now led was, witli 
all its miferablc Circumftances, than the wicked, 
curfed, abominable Life I led all the paft Part of 
my Days J and now I changed both my Sorrows 
and my Joys > my very Defires alter'd, my AifiriSki- 
ons changed their Gufts, and my Delights were 
perfeftly new, from what they were at my firft 
Coming, or indeed for the two Years paft. 

Before, as I walk'd about either on my Hunt- 
ing, or for viewing the Country, the Anguifh of 
my Soul at my Condition, would break oox. ujton 
xne on a fuddcn, and my very Heart wouk) die 
within me, to think of the Woods, the Mountains, 
the Defarts I was inj and how I was a Prifoner 
lock'd up with the eternal Bars and Bolts of the

Opean, in an uninhabited Wildernefs, without Re- 
demption : In the midll of thegreateft Compofures 
of my Mind, this would break out upon me like a 
Storm, and make me wring my Hands, and weep 
like a Child : Sometimes it would take mc iilf the 
middle oFmy Work, and I would immediately fit 
down and figh, and look upon the Ground for an 
Hour or two together > and this was ftill worfe to 
me ; for if I could burft out into Tear^, or vent 
my felf by Words, it would go off, and the Grief 
having exhaufted it fclf, would abate. 

But now I began to exercife my felf with new 
Thoughts J I daily read the Word of God, and ap- 
ply'd all the Comforts of it to my prefent* State. 
One Morning being very fad, I open'd the fiiblc 
upon thefe Words, I will never ^ never leave thee^ 
wr for fake thet j immediately it occurr'd, That ihefe 
Words were tome, Why elfefliould theybcdired- 
cd in fuch a Manner, jufl: at the Moment when I 
was mourning over my Condition, as one forfaken 
of God and Man? Well then, faid 1, if God does 
not forfake me, of what ill Confequence can it be, 
or. what matters it, though the World fhoulti all 
forfake mc, feeing on the other hand, if I had all 
the World, and mould lofe the Favour and Blef- 
fing of God, there would be no Comparifon in 
the Lofs ? 

From this Moment I began to conclude in my 
Mind, That it was poOible for me to be more 
happy in this forfaken Solitaiy Condition, than it 
w» probable I fliould ever have been in any other 
particular State in the World | and with this 
Thought I was going to give Thanks to God for 
bringing me to this Place. 

I know not what it was, but fometbing (hock'd 
my Mind at thac.Thought, and I durll not Ipeafc 
the Words : How canft thou be fuch a Hypocrite,

|-»ife,, and to mourn foj my Wickcdnefs, and repent. 
i never 6pcn'd the Bible, or fhut it, but my very

no^on. 

To this' fhort Time allow'd for Labodri I defire 
maybe added the exceeding Laborioufnels of my 
Work ', the many Hours whi<ih for want of Tpols^ 
vrmt of Help , and want of Skill } every Thjng I 
did, took up out of my Time. For example, I 
^as full two and forty J>ayfe making me a Board for 
a long Shelf, which I wanted in my Cave; where- 
as two Sawyers with their Tools, and a Saw-Pit* 
would have cut fix of them out of the fame Tree 
in half a Day. 

My Cafe was this : ' It was to be a large Tree^ 
which was to be cut down, becaufe my Board was 
to be a broad one. This Tree I was three Days 
a cutting down, and two more cutting off tne 
Bows,' and Veducing it to a Log or Piece of Tim- 
ber. With inexprcflible hacking and hewing I 
rcduc'd both the Sides of it into Chips, till it be- 
gun to be light enough to rtjove 5 then I tum'd it, 
and made one Side of it fmooth and flat as a 
Board, from End to End 5 then turning that fide 
downward, cut the other Side, till I brought the 
Plank to be about three Inches thick, and fmooth 
on both Sides. Any one may judge the Labour of 
my Hands in fuch a piece of Work j but Labour 
and Patience carry'd me through that and mariy 
other things : I only obferve this in particular, to 
fheW thd Reafon why fo much of my Time went 
away with/o little Wofk, viz. That what might be 
a little to be done with Help and Tools, was a vaft 
Labour, and required a prodigious Time to do alone, 
and by hand. 

Bur notwithftanding this, with Patience andLa- 
bour! went through many things J and indeed eve-

itoc to do, as will appear by what follows.

After this Experiment, I need not fay that I 
wanted no fort dt Earthen Ware for my Ufe j but 
I muft needs fay^ as to the Shapes of them, they 
were very indifFercnr, as any one may fuppofe, 
when I had no way of making them ^ but as illc 
Children make Dirt-Pies, or as a Woman woilkkl 
makes Pics that never learn'd to raife Paft^. 

No Joy at a Thing of fo mean a Nature Wto 
ever equal to mine, when I found I had made an 
Earthen Pot that would bear the Fire 5 and I had 
hardly Patience to ftay till they were cold, before 
I fet one upon the Fire again, with fome Water in 
it, to boil me fome Meat, which it did admirably 
well ; and with a piece of a Kid I made fome very 
good Broth, though I wanted Oatmeal, and feve- 
ral other Ingredients requifite to make it Co good 
as I would have had it been. 

My next Concern was, to get me a Stone Mor- 
tar to flamp or beat fome Com in > for as to the 
Mill, there was no thought at arriving to that Per- 
fe&ion of Art, with one pair of Hands, To fup- 
ply this Want I was at a great Lo(s $ for of all 
Trades in the World I was as perfe£tly tmqpalificd 
for a Stone- Cutter, as for any whatever j neither 
had I any Tools to go about it with. I fpent many 
a Day to find out a great Stone big enod^ to cut 
hollow, and make fit for a Mortar, and oould 
find none at all, except what was in the folid Rock, 
and which I had noway todig or cut out ^ nor in- 
deed were the Rocks in the l{land of HardneCs luf-

forty five Fathom of Land, where it lay, to fet it a-

cfpecially When in about half an Hour more, it 
blew a pretty fmall gentle Gale. By this Time 1 
was gotten at a frightful Diflance from the Ifland,

However, I ikcr'd roy Trap, and, not to trouble 
you with Particulars, going one Morning to fee my 
Trtp^ I found in one of them f lame oldHe-Gqtt, 
and in one of the other three Kids, a Male, aMi 
two Females. 

• As to the old one, I knew not what to do with 
him, he was fo fifercc I durft not go into the Pit to 
him I that is to fay, to go about to bring him away 
alive, which was what I wanted. I could have 
ktird him, but that was not my Budnefs, nor would 
it tn(wer my End. So I e'en let him out, and he 
ran away as if he had been frighted out of. 
hia Wits : But I had forgot then what I recoUcfted 
afterwards, that Hunger will tame a Lyon., If T 
bad let him ftay there three of four Days without 
Food:, and then had carry*d him fomc Water to 
drink, and then a little Corn, he would have been 
^a^tame as one of the Kids, for they are mighty 

SM^rioOs tradable Creatures where they are wcU 
cd- . 

. Hbwcv^r, for the prefentllcthimgo, knowing 
no better at that time % then I went to the three 
Kids, and uking them one by one, I tyed them 
^itfai Strings together, and with fome Difficulty 
brought them all home. 

It Was a. good while before they would feed, but 
throwing them fomefweetCom, it tempted them, 
and they began tp be tame : and now I found that^ 
iflexpefted to fopply my felf with Goat-Flefh 
^hen I had norowder or Shotl^ breeding fomc 
lip tame was my only Way, when perhaps t 
might hive them about my Houfe like a Flock pf^ 
Sheep. 

But then it prefently occurM to me, that I muit 
keep the Tame from the Wild, or eUe tbey wouU

Sca-Shorc^dircftly to t^ic Place whcrcl firft brought ' 
my Boat to an Anchor, to get up upon the Rocks % 
and bavittg noBoat now to take care of, I went o- 
vcr the Land a nearer Way, to the fame Height chat ' 
I was upon before j when looking forward to the 
Point of the Rocks which lay out, and which Iwas ' 
dblig'd to double with my Boat, as is faid above^ 
1 was furpriz'd to fee the Sea all fmooth and quiet, > 
no Ripling, no Motion, no Current, any more there 
than m other Places. ' 

I was at a ftrange Lofs to underftand this, and- 
icfolv'd to fpepd fomc Time in the obfervlng it^ to^ 
fte if nothing from the Sets of theTide had occa-- 
iion'd it } but I was prefcntly convinced how it was,* 
viz. That theTide of Ebb fetting from the fTefi^^ 
and joining with the Current of Waters from fomc 
great River on the Shore, muft be the occafion of 
this Current i and that according as the Wind bJcw 
more forcibly from the ^eftj or from the Nortb^ 
this ^Current came near, or went farther from 
Shore 5 for waiting thereabouts till Evening, I went 
ijp to the Rock again, and then the Tide of £bb 
being made, I plainly faw the Current again as be^ 
fore, only, that it run farther off, being near half ^' 
League from the Shore j whereas in my Cafe, jn 
iet clofe upon the Shore, and hurried me and my 
Canoe along with it, which at another time it 
would not have done. 

Th is Obfervation convinced me. That I had nof 
tiling to do but to obferve the Ebbing and the 
Flowihg of the Tide, and I might, very cafily bring* 
my Boat about the Ifland again: But when I be^^ 
gan to think of putting it in pradice, I had fudi a 
Terror upon my Spirits at the Remembrance of 
the Danger I had been in, that I could not think 
6i it again with any Patience 5 but on the comrarr,

that" ^s to fay, beyond wnere my Wall joined to 
the. Rock, was all fiird up with the large Earthen 
Pot^, of which I have given an Account, and with 
fourteen or fifteen great Baskets, which would hold

by this Time grown fo big, and fpread fb yaf 
much , that there was not the leafl: Appearance to 
any one*s View of any Habitation behind them. 

Near this Dwelling of mine, but a little farther 
within the Land, and upon lower Ground, lay my 
two Pieces of Corn- Ground, which I ket)t duly 
cultivated and fow'd, and which duly yielded me 
their Harveft in its Sea^n 5 and whenever I had

that I had furnifli'd my felf with a tanae Breed ^E/ 

6oats, that I needed, not hunt any more about the 

Woods, or ihoot at them ; and if I did catch any 

of them after thi5, it was by Trap3, and Snares, 

as I had done before ; fo that for two Years after 

.this, I believe I never fiir'd my Gun once offi thoM 

never went out without it ; ' and which was more, as 

I' had fav'd three Piftols out of the Ship, I always 

ea%ried them out with me» or at ieaft two of them, 

ftieking them in my Goat-Skin Belt ; alfo I (uvhiQxd

imong Mankind, at any Condition of Life, if Peo-

thofe that are worfe, in order to be thankful, than 
be always comparing them with thofe which are 
better, to affift their Murmarings anil Complain-

As in my prefent Condition there were not really

that the Frights I had been inabout thefe favagc

own Prefervation, had taken off the Edge of my In- 
vention for my own Conveniences,' and I had dropM 
a good Defign, which I had once bent my Thoughts 
too much'upon i and that was, to try if I could not 
mate fome of my Barley into Malt, and then try 
to brew my felf fome Beer : This was really a wl^im- 
(ical Thought, 'and I reprov'd my felf often for the 
Simplicity of it ,• for I prefently faw there would 
be the Want of feveral Things heceffary to the 
making my Beer, that it would be impoffible for 
me to fupply : As Firft, Casks to preferve it in, 
which was a Thing, that as I have Obferv'd alrea-

no Copper or Kettle to make it boil ; and yet all 
thefe Things,notwithftanding,I verily believe, had 
not thefe Things intervened, I mean the Frights apd

do among them, when'perhaps there might be 
twenty [or thirty of them tqgether , wich\their

could flfoot as true to a Mark, as I could with my

tlmc^ that I vas juft goiag to let fly at them in ihy^

iftaploy'd my felf feveral Days to mi4 out' proper,

twenty or thirty of them to the Sword, as I may

Well, at length I found a Place in jhe Side of the 
Hill, where I was fatisfy'd I might fccurely'wait, 
till I faw any of their Boats coming, and mighr 
then, even before they would be ready to come oh 
Shore, convey my felf unfeen into Thickets 5f Trees, 
in one of which there Wi^s a Hollow large enough 
to conpeal me entirely ; and where I might fit, and 
pbferve alj their bloody Doings, and take my fulf

cond and third Charge^ I prcpar'd my felf for my 
Expedition. 

* After I had thus laid the Scheme of my Defign/ 
^txd irl my Imagination put it in Praftfce, I contf^: 
nuaHy m^de )ny Tour every Morning up to the- 
Top of the Hill, which was from my Caftic, as T 
caird it, about three . Miles, or mote, to fee if I 
could <)bferve any Boats upon the Sea, coming near 
the. ffland, or ftanding over towards it ; but T be- 
gan to tire of this hard Duty, after I bad for two' 
or three Months conftantly kept my Watch ,- but 
came always back without any Difcovery, rhcrc 
having not in aH that Time been the leaft Appear-' 
lance, not only ,on, or near the Shore ; but not op- 
the whole Ocean, fo far as my Eyes or Glafl'es could' 
reach every Way. 

As long as I kept up my daily Tour to the Hill 
to look Out, fo long alfo I kept up the Vigour of 
my Defign, and my Spirits feem*d ta be all the 
while in a fuitable Form, for fo outragious an Exe- 
cution as the killing twenty or thirty naked Savages, 
for an Ofence which I had not at all entred into z 
Difcuffien of in my Thoughts, any further than my

ly Morjaing-.in.vain, fomy,pfiniptt of thcAdian 
itfelf began tq ^tcc^ and I began with cooler smi 
calmer Thoughts to confider what it was I w^s gpr 
ing to engage in. What Auth.ocity .or Call, fjiad, 
io pretend to be Judge and Execuapner upon thcfe 
Men as CrixninaJs^ whom Heaven had thougiht' fit 
^icib many Agi^s to iu&r, unpuniCt'd, to go.on^ 
a«i4;to be/ as it were,' the Executioners of his Judg- 
ments , one upon another. How £ir. thefc People 
were. Oflfenciers againfTme, and what Right I had 
tp-engage in the Quarrel of, that Blood, which they 
fixed promifcuoufly one upon another. I debated 
this very often with my fejf thus; How do I know 
what God himfclf judges in this particular Cale 5:, it 
h certain thefe People do not conimit this i^"i 
Qrip^e ; it is ,not ag^ainU their own Confciences re- 
proving, or their Light reproaching them* Thej 
4o not know it to be an Ofience, and then conunit 
it in Defiance of divine Juftice, as we do in almoft 
all the Sins we commit. They think it no more a 
Crime to kill a Captive taken in War, than we do 
to kill an Ox ; nor to eat humane Fleih, than we 4p 
to eat Mutton* ^ / ' 

When I had confider^d this a little, it foUowU ric- 
iqeffarily, that I was certainly in the Wrong in it ; 
that thefe People were not Murderjers in the Senfe 
that I had before condemned them in my Thoughts ; 
^ny more than thofe Chriftians were Murderers, who 
qi^cn put to Death the Prifoners taken in Battle ; 
qt more frequently, upon many Occafions^ put 
whole Trpops of Men to the Sword, without gi- 
ving Quarter, tho* they threw down their Atxns 
and fubmitted. 

In the next Plkce it occur*d me, that albeit the 
Ufage they thus jgave one another was thus brutifii 
and inhumane ; yet it "was really nothing to me : 
Thefe People had done me no Injury. That if they

diaje Prefcrvation to fall upon thepi, foinething

their Power, and they had reaUy no Knowledge of 
m^, and confequently no Defign upon me ; and t)iere-: 
lore it cbuld qot be juft for me to fall upon them; 
That this .would juftify the Condu&of the ^amards^ 
iti all their Barbarities praftis'd in Amerkay where 
they deftroy^d Millions of thefe People, whQ, how- 
ever they were Idolaters and Barbarians, zt\A bad Se- 
veral bloody and barbarous Rites jn their CuAonis; 
fuch as facrificing humane Bodies to their Idols, 
were yet, as to the Spaniardsy very innocent Peop^l 
4nd thit the rooting them out of the Country^- is 
fpoken of with the utmoft Abhorrence and Deteft^ 
tion, by eventl^ Spaniards thpmfclves, at thii^iv^e^ 
and by all other Chriftian Nations of Eurofei ^s a 
mere Butchery, a bloody and unnatural PiC^ of 
Cruelty, utjuftifiable either to Qod or Man \ tnd 
fuch, as for whiph the very^amc of a Sfaniari is 
rdckon'd to be frightful and terrible to all Peoffc of

the Produ(ft of a Race of Men, who. were without 
Principles of Tendemefs, or the common Bowels of 
Pity to the Miferable, which is reckoned to be s 
Mafk of generous Temper in the Mind. 

Thefe Confiderations really put me to a Paufe 
and. to a kind ol a full Stop ; and I bega^ by little 
and little to.be off of my Defign, and to conclude, I 
had taken wrong Meafure^ in my Refolutions to at'*

I iave but enjoy'd the Certainty, that no Savages 
would come to the Place to diffurb me, I could 
have been content to have capitulated for (pending 
the reft of my Time there, even to the laft Mo-

Goat in the Cave. I h^d alfo arriv d to fome little 
Divecfions and Awufepients, which made the Time 
pafs more pleafantly with me a great deal, than 
it did befoi:e ; as firft, I had taught my Poff^ as I 
iu)ted before, to fpeak ; and he did it fo femuiarly, 
and talked fo articulately and plain, that it was 
very pleaftntto me : and he liv'd with me no Icfs

live afterwards, 1 know not ; tho' I know they

of "ardent Wifiies, and of ftrong Ideas forin'd in njy

inight be ufefiil to me ; but that did not altoget.l^er

ing ittL Thatfuch Rint^ and Notices ate given 
us, I believe fe\r that' have made any Obfcrvati- 
OBftof 'Things c»n deny •, that they are certain Dil^ 
coyeries of an invifihle World, and a Convcrfe of 
Spirits, we cannot doubt •, and if the Tendency 
of them feenis to be to warn us of Dai^er, why 
flionld we not fuppofe they are from feme friendly 
Agent, (whether fupreme;, or inferior and fuborn 
dinate,' is not. the Queftion) and that they are gi4 
ven tor our G6od ? 

The 4)refenfcQp€ftion abundantly confirms me ihf 
thejufticc of tl)is. Reafoning r^Q^. had I not been 
mad^ cautious by this fecret Adi^riitioh, com&it 
from whence it will, I had been undone inevitably, 
and in a fax worfe Condition tfian before, a$ you 
will fee prefently. . j ; 

I had. not kept my felf long in thisPofture, b»t 
I faw the Boat draw near the Shore, is if they 
looVd for a Creek to.thmft in at for. the Gortve«ri 
ence. of Landings however, as. they did not coihii 
quite fer enough, tbcy did not fee the little Inlib 
where I : formerly landed my Rafts.; but nm theia 
Boat on Shore upon, the Beach, at about half k 
Mile from me, which was very happy for tne^ for 
otherwife thej would have landed juft, as I may 
fay, at my Door, and would ibon have beaten mo 
out of myCaftle, and, perhaps, have plunder d me 
of all I had. 

When they were on Shore, I was fully fatify'd 
that, they were EngUfl) Men •, at leaft moft of them^ 
one or two I thought were Dutch \ but it did not 
prdve fo : There were dn all eleven Men, wheceof 
three 6f them I found were unarmed, and, as i 
thought, bounds and whert the firft four or five of 
them were junap!d on Shore, they took thofe three 
out of the Boat as Prifoners : One of ihe three I 
could perceive ufing the moil pafTionate Gefiures of

When we had talk'd a while, the Captain told 
me^ he had kought me feme little Reirefhment, 
fuch as the 5hi^ afforded, and furh as the Wretches 
that bad been lo long his Mailers had not plundered 
him of: Upon this he call'd aloud to the Boat, and 
VIA his Men bring the Things a-Shore that were for 
thfe Governour^ and indcea it was a Prefent, as if 
1 had been one not that was to be carry'd away 
akttig with them, but as if 1 had been to dwell 
upon the Ifland ftill, and they were to go without 
me/ 

Firft he had brought me a Cafe of Bottles full 
of tezctllent Cordial Waters^ fix large Bottles of 
Misieru Wine^ the pottles held two Qarts apiece i 
two Pound rfexcetlent good Tobacco, twelve good 
FS6ce« of the Ship's Bpdf, and fix Pieces of Pork, 
^tfi a Bag of Peafe, and about a hundred Weight 
/of Bilket. 

He Jbwught ngie aMb a Box of Sugar, a Box of 
Flower, a Bag full of Lemons, and two Bottles of 
Lime-juice, and abundance of other Things: Bilt 
befides thcfe, and what was a thoufand times more 
xi^hA to me, he brought me fix clean new Shirts, 
fix very good Neckcloaths, two Pair of Gloves, 
dtte Paff of Shoes, a Hat, and one Pair of Stock- 
ittigs, and a; tirttj good Suit ofCloaths of his own ^ 
which had been worn ^tot very little : In a Word, 
he doathed me from Head to Foot. 

It was a very kind and agreeable Prefent, as any 
one may imagine, to one in my Circumftances : 
But never was ai^y thing in the World of that Kind 
lb unplealant, awkard, and uneafy, as it was to 
me to wear fuch Qoaths at their firft putting on.

We knew to be incorrigible and refractory to the

were Tuch Rogues, that there was no obliging 
them, and if he did carry them away, it muft be 
in Irons, as Malefadors to be delivered over to Ju*

the Bag of Peafe which the Captain had brought

By the fame Fleet, my two Merchant Truftee$ 
fliipp*d me 1 200 Chefls of Sugar, 800 Rolls of To- 
bacco, and the reft of the whole Accompt in Gold. 

I might well fay, now indeed. That the latter 
End of Job was better than the Beginning- . It is 
impofTible to exprefs the Flutterings of my very 
Hearty when I lodk'd over thefe Letters, and ef- 
pecially when I found all my Wealth about me; for 
as the Brafil Ships come all in Fleets, the fame 
Ships which brought my Letters, brought my 
Goods ; and the Eflfefts \x ere fafe in the River be- 
fore the Letters came to my Hand. In a Word, I 
turned pale , and. grew fick ; and bad not the old 
Man run and fetched me a Cordial, I believe the 
fudden Surprize of Joy had overfet Nature, and I 
had dy'd upon the Spot, 

Nay after that, I continuM very ill^^ and was f« 
Tome Hours, ^till a Phyfician being fent for , and 
fomething of the real Caufe of my Illnefs being 
known, he orderM me to be let Blood; after 
which, I had Relief, and grew well : But I verily 
believe, if it had not been eas^d by a Vent given 
in that manner, to the Spirits, I fliould have 
dyM. 

I was now Matter , all on a fuddefl , of above 
5000/. Sterling in Money, and had an Eftate, as 
I might well call it^ in the Bmjils, of above a 
thoufand Pounds a Year, as fure as an Eftate of 
Lands in England : And in a Word, I was in a 
Condition which I fcarce knew how taunderftandj 
or how to compofe* my felf , for the Enjoyment 
©fit. 

The firft thing I did, was to recompenfe my 0- 
riginal Benefactor, my good old Captain, who 
had been firft charitable to me in my Iliftrefs, 
kind to me in my BeginiiAig, and honeft to me at 
the End .- I flicw'd higa all that was fent me, I

told him, that next to the Providence of Heaven, 
which difpofes all things, it was owing to him j 
and that it now lay on me to% reward him, which 
I would do a hundred fold : So I firft returned to 
him. the hundred Moidores I had receiv-d of him,- 
then I fent for a Notary, and caufed him to draw 
up a general Rekafe or Difcharge for the 470 
Moidores, which he had acknowledged he owM 
me in the fulleft and firmeft Manner poiTible ; ^ af- 
ter which, I caufed a Procuration to be drawn, 
impowering him to be my Receiver of the annual 
Profits of my Plantation, and appointing nay Part- 
ner to accompt to him, and liiake the Returns by 
the ufual Fleets to him in my Name ; and a Claufe 
in the End, being a Grant of 100 Moidores a 
Year to him, during his Life, out of the EflFefts, 
and 50 Moidores a Year to his Son after him, for 
his Life : And thus I requited my old Man. 
' I was now to confider which Way to fleer ^my 
Courfe next, and what to do with*the Eflate that 
Providence had thus put into my Hands ; and in- 
deed I had more Care upon my Head now, than 
I had in my filent State of Life in the Iflandy 
where I wanted nothing but what I had, and 
had nothing but what I wanted : Whereas I had 
now a great Charge upon me, and my Bufinefs 
was how to fecure it. I had ne-er a Cave now to 
hide my Money in, or a Place where it might lye 
without Lock or Key, ^till it grew mouldy and 
tamifh'd before any Body would meddle with it : 
On the contrary, I knew not where to purjt, or 
who to trufl with it. My old Patron, the ' Cap- 
tain, indeed was honefl, and that was the only Re- 
fuge I had. 

In the next Place, my Intereil in the ^Brajth 
fecmM to fummon me thither, but now I could 
not tell, how to think of going thither, 'till I had

fettled my, Affairs, and left my EflFefts in fome fafc 
Han'ds behind me^ At firft I thought of my old 
Friend the Widow, who I knew was honeft, and 
would be juft to me; but then flie was in Years j 
and but poor; and for ought I knew, might be in 
Debt; u) that in a Word, I had no way but to 
go back to England my felf, and take my Efi^ds 
with nie. 

It was fome Months however before I refolve^ 
upon this; and therefore, as I had rewarded the 
old Captaiii fully, and to his Satisfa^ion, who had 
been my former Benefador, fo I began to think of 
my poor Widow ^ whofe Husband had been my 
firft Benefa&or, and fte, while it was in her Pow- 
er, my faithful Steward and Inftrudor. So' the firft 
thing I did, I got a Merchant in Lisbon to write to 
his Correfpondent in Lon4(fny not only to pay a 
Bill, but to go find her out, and carry her in Mo^ 
Bey, an hundred Pounds from me, and to talk with 
her, and comfort her in her Poverty, by telling her 
flie fhould, if I liv'd^ have a farther Supply: At 
the fame time I fept my two Sifters in the Coun- 
try, each of them an hundred Pounds, they being, 
though not in Want, yet not in very good Circum- 
ftances; one having been marry 'd, and left a Wi- 
dow ; and the other having a Husband not Co kind 
to her as he Ihould be. 

But among all my Relations, or Acquaintances, 
I could not yet pitch upon one , to whom I durft 
commit the Grofs of my Stock, that I might go a- 
way to the Brafils^ and leave things fafe behind 
me; and this greatly perplexed me. 

I had once, a Mind to have gone to the Brafilsj 
and have fettled my felf there ; for I was , as it 
xvere, naturalized to che Place ; but I had fome lit- 
tle Scruple in my Mind about Religion, which iir 
fenfibJy dr^w mc back, of. which I ihaU fay

more prefently. However, it was riot Religion 
that kept me from goii>g there for the prefent; 
and as I had made no Scruple of being openly of 
the Religion of the Country^ all the while I was 
among them, fo neither did I yet j only that now 
and then having of late thought more of it, (than 
formerly) when I began to think of living and dying 
among them, I began to regret my having profefs d 
my felf a Papift, and thought it might not be the 
beft Religion to die with, 

But,as 1 have faid,this was not the main thing that 
kept me from going to the Brajils, but that reah 
ly I did not know with whom to leave my Effefts 
behind me ; fo I refolv'd at laft to go to England 
with it, where,^ if I arrived, I concluded I fhould 
make fome Acquaintance, or find fome Relations 
that would be faithful to me;^ and accordingly I

In order to prepare things for my going Home, I 
firft, the Bra/il iFlect being juft going away, refolved 
to give Anfwers fuitableto the juft and faithful Ac- 
count of things I had from thence j and firft to the 
Prior o^ St. Auguftind wrote a Letter full of Thanks 
for their juft Dealings, and the Offer of the Syz 
Moidores, which was indifpofcd of, which I dcT 
fir'd might be given 500 to the Monaftery, and 
372 to the Poor, as the Prior fliould direft, defi- 
ring the good Padres Prayers for me, and the like. 

I wrotd next a Letter of Thanks to my two

much Juftice and Honcfty callM for ; as for fen-

left with my old Patron^ to whom I defir'd him to 
feud whatever became due to me, 'till he fhould 
bear fpom me more particularly,- afTuring him that 
it was my Intention, not only to come to him, but 
to fettle my felf there for the Remainder of my 
Life : To this I added a very handfom Prefent of 
fome/iftf//^ Silks for his Wife, and two Daughters,

with two Pieces of fine Englijh Broad-Cloatb, the 
beft I could get in Lishny five Piece$ of black Bays,

Having thus fettled my Affairs, fold my Cargoe, 
and turned all mys Eftefts into good Bills of Ex- 
change ; my next DiJEculty was, which Way to go 
to England : I had been accuftom'd enough to the 
Sea, 'and yet I had a flrange Averfibn to going to 
England by Sea at that time; and though I could 
give no Reafon for it, yet the Difficulty encreas'd 
upon me fo much, that though I had once fhipp'd 
my Baggage, in order to go, yet I altered my Mind, 
and that not once, but two or three times. 

It is true^ T had been very unfortunate by Sea, 
and this might be fome of the Reafons : But let 
no Man flight the ftrong Impulfes of his own

Ships which I had fingl'd out to go in, I mean,

is to fay, fo as in one of them to put my things on 
Board, and in the other to have agreed with the 
Captain ; J fay, t^o of thefe Ships mifcarry'd, w'x* 
one was taken by th^ Algerines^ and the other was 
caft away on the Start near Torhy, and all the Peo-

VelTels I had been made miferable ; and in which

Having been thus harafs*d injnfiy Thoughts, my 
old pilot, to whom I communicated every thing, 
prefs'd me earneftly not to go by Sea, but &th^i^ 
to go by Land to the Groyae^ and crofs over tb^i 
pay of Bifcay to Rochelly from whence it was but 
an eafy and fafe Journey by Land to Paris^ and fo 
to Calais and Dover; or to go up to l\Jadri4y and 
fo all the Way by Land thro' France. 

In a Word, I was fo prepoflefs^M againft my going 
by Sea at all, except from Calais to Dover^ that 
\ refolv^d to travel all the Way by Land ^ which 
as I was not in Hafte, and didiiot value the 
Charge, was by much the pleafanter Way; and to 
make it more fo, my old Captain brought an £«- 
glijh Gentleman, the Son of a Merchant in Ushon^ 
Virho was willing to travel with me : After which, 
we pick'd up two more Englijb Merchants alfo, and 
two yoiing Portuguefe Gentlemen, the laft going to 
Paris ,only y fo that we were in all fix of us^ and 
five Servants; the two Merchants and the two 
Portuguefey contenting themfelves with one Ser- 
vant between two, to five the Charge ; and as for 
me, I got an Englijh Sailor to travel with me as 
a Servant, bcfides my yi^n Friday^, who was too 
much a Stranger to be capable of fupplying the 
Place of a Servant on the Road. ' 

In this Manner Ifet'out from l^iskn; and our 
Company being all very well mounted and armed, 
Wc made a little Troop, whereof they did me the 
Honour to call me Captain, as well becaufe

pcn*J to us in this tedious and difficult Journey, I 
muft not omit. 

When we came to Madrid, we being all of us 
Strangers to Spairiy "were willing to ftay feme time 
to fee the Court of Spain, and to fee what was 
worth obferving ,• but it being the latter Part of 
the SummeF, w^ haften'd away, and fet out from 
Madrid about the Middle of Ochier: But when we 
came to the Edge of Navarre, we were alarm'd at 
feveral Towns on the Way, with an Account, that 
fo much Snow was fallen on the French Side of the 
Mountains, that feveral Travellers were obliged 
to come back to Pampeluna, after having attem^ 
pted, at an extream Hazard to pafs on. 

When we came to Pampeluna it felf, we feund it 
fo indeed ; and to me that had been always ufcd 
to a hot Climate, and indeed to Countries where 
we could fcarce bear any Cloaths on, tlie Cold was 
> infuffc|;,able ; npr indeed was it nwre painful than 
it was furprizing, to come but ten Days before out 
of the Old Cafiile, where the Weather was not only 
warm, but very hot; and immediately to feel a 
Wind from the Pw»e'/2« Mountains, fo very keen, 
fo feverely cold, as to be intollerable, and to en- 
danger benumbing and pcrifliing of our Finger^ 
and Toes. 

Poor Friday was really frighted when he faw the 
Mountains all covered with Snow, and felt cold 
Weather, which he had never feen or felt "^before 
in his Life. 

To mend the Matter, when we came to Pant" 
feluna, it continued fnowing with fo much Vio- 
lence, and fo long, that the People faid. Winter 
was come before its time, and the Roads which 
were difficult before, were now quite impaflable: 
For in a Word, the Snow lay in feme Places -too 
thick for us to travel i and beine not hard frojsen, as

IsthcCkfc in Northern Countries: 1*here was no 
going without being in Danger of being bury'd 
alive every Step. We ftaid no lefs than twenty 
Days at Pamfeluna ; when feeing the Winter com- 
ing on, and no likelihood of its being better; for 
it was the fevercft Winter all over Europe that had 
been known in the Memory of'Man. I proposed 
that we Ihould all go away to FomerabiUy and there 
take Shipping for Bourdeauxy which was a very 
little Voyage. > 

But while we were confidering this, there came 
in four French Gentlemen, who having been ftopp'd 
on the French Side of the Paffcs, as we were on 
the Spanijh, had found out a Guide, who traverfing 
the Country near the Head of l^nguedocy had 
brought them over the Mountains by fuch Ways, 
that they were not much incommoded with the 
Snow," and ^h ere they met with Snow in any 
Quantity, they faid it was frozen hard enough to 
bear them and their Horfes. 

We fent for this Guide, who toJd us, he would 
undertake to carry us the fame Way with no Ha- 
zard from the Snow, provided we were armed fuf- 
ficiently to proteft us from wild Beafts; for he 
faid, upon thefe great Snows, it was frequent for 
fome Wolves to (how themfelves ar the Foot of 
the Mountains, being made ravenous for Wane 
of Food, the Ground being covered with Snow : 
We told him, we were well enough prepared for 
fiich Creatures as they were, if he would enfure 
us from a Kind of two-legged Wolves, which we 
were told, we were in moft Danger from, efpeci-; 
ally on the French Side of the Mountains. 

He fatisfy'd us there was no Danger of that kind 
in the Way that we were to go ; fo we readily a^ 
greed to follow him, as did alfo twelve pther Gen-^

were oblig'd to come bfick again. 

Accordingly, we all fcr out from Pampeluna^ with 
oui: Guide, .on the htteentii ol* Novrnt^er; and in- 
deedjL I was furpriii 'd, when inftead of going for- 
ward, he came directly back with us, on the fkme 
Road that' w6 cam? from Mi4drid^ above twenty 
Miles X when being pafs'd two Rivers, and come 
into the plain Country, we found our felves in a 
warm Giinate again, where the Country was plea- 
fant, and no Siiow to be feen \ but on a fuddea, 
turning to the left, he appro^ch<l the !{j^ountaii)| 
another Way ? and though it is true,, the Hflls and! 
Frccipiccs look'd dreadful, yet he made fo many 
TToiirs, fuch Meanders, and led us by fiich wind- 
ing Ways, that we were infenfibly pafs'd the 
Height of the .Mountains, without beinjg much 
iincumbred with the Snow; aqd all on a fudden, 
he ihew'd us the pleafant fruitful Provinces o( Latt- 
gu'edoc and Gafcoign, all green and flourifliing; tho' 
indeed it wasat a great Diftance, and we had fome 
rough Way to paf^ yjet. 

We were a little uneafy however, when we found 
it fnow'd one whole Day, arid a Night, fo faft, 
that we could not travel i but he bid us be eafy, 
we fhould foon be- paft it all : We found indeed, 
that we began to defcend every Day, a.nd to come 
more North than ^fore^ and fo depending upoii 
our Guide,' we went on. 

It was about two Hoars before Night, when 
our Guide being fomething before us, and riot juft 
in Sight, out rulhed three monftrous Wolves, and 
4fter them a Bear, out of a hollow Way, adjoyn- 
ing to a thick Wood ; two of the Wolves flew up-

being next to me, I bid l\im rid^ up,' and'fte what 
Vas the Matter ; ais fobn as Friday came in Sight 
of the Man, he hdlow <i as loud as t other, O Mi- 
fter! O Mifier! But like a bold Fellov^, rode di- 
ifceftly up to the poor Man, and w;ith bis Piftol 
(hot the Wolf that attacked him into the Head. 

It was happy for the poor Mari^. that it was my 
Man Friday ; for he having been us'd to that kind 
of Creature in his Country, had no Feat upotv 
him 5 but went elofe up to him, and fhot him as 
above; whereas any of us, would have ifir'd at a 
ferther Diftance, and have perhaps either miis'd 
the Wolf, or endanger^ ihpoting the Man. 

But it was enough to have terrify 'd a bolder 
Man than I, and indeed it alarm'd all our Compa- 
ny, when with the Noife of Fridays PiUol, we 
heard on both Sides the difmalleft Howling of 
Wolves, and the Noife redoubled by the Ecchq of 
the Mountains, that it was to us as if there had 
been a prodigious Multitude of them; and per- 
haps indeed there was not fuch a Few, as that we 
had no Caufe of Apprehenfions. 

However, as Fr/^;' had kilfd this Wolf, the o-

mediately, and fled ; Iiaving happily faftned upon 
his Head, where the Bofles of the Bridle had ftugk

fliot the Wolf. 

It is eafy to fuppofc^ that at the Noife of Pri- 
day*s Piftql, we all mended our Pace, and rid up as 
fiift as the Way (which was very difficult) would 
give us leave, to fee what was the Matter; as foon 
as we eame clear of the Trees, which blinded us 
before, we faw clearly what had been the Cafe, 
and how Friday h^tA difengag'd the poor Guide; 
though we did not prefently difcern what kind o£ 
Cfcature it was he had kill a. 
'*'But never wjis a Fight managM fo. hardily, and 
in fuch a furprizing Manner, as that which foilow'cf 
between Frid0 and the Bear, which gave US' all 
(though ^t firft wc were furpriz'd and afraid for 
him) the greateft Diverfion imaginable : As the 
Bear is a heavy, clumfey Qrc^ture, and dofes^ not 
gallop as the Wolf does; Vho' is JTwift, and light j 
lo he has two particular Qualities, which generally 
are the Rule of his Adions; Firft, As to Men, who 
^rc not his proper Prey; I (ay, not his proper Prey j 
becaufe tho I cannot fay wh^t excefliveHunger might 
do, which was now their Cafe, the Ground being all • 
cover'd with Snow; but as to Men, he does notii^ 
fually attempt them, unlefs they firft attack him : 
On the contrary, if you meet him in the Woed^, if 
you don't meddle with him, he won*c meddle with 
, you ; but then you muft take Care to be very civil 
to him, and give him the Road; for he is a very 
nice Gentleman, he won^t go a Step out of his Way 
iFor a Prince ; nay, if you are really afraid, your 
beft way is to look another Way, and keep going 
on ; for fometimes if you ftop, and ftand ftill, and 
look fteadily at him, he takes it for an Affront ; but 
if you throw or tofs any Thing at him, and it hits 
him, though it were but a bit of a Stick, as big as 
your Finger, he takes it for an Affront, and fets all

he will have Satisfadibn in Point of Honour ^ that 
is hiij firft Quality: The nei^t is. That if he be 
once aflrontcd, he will never leave you. Night ©r 
Day, till he has his Revenge ; but follows at a good 
round rate, till he overtakes you. 

My Man Friday had delivered our Guide, and 
when we came up to him, he was helping him off 
from his Horfc i for the Man was both hurt and" 
frighted, and indeed the laft more than the firft; 
\Vhen on the fuddcn, we/pyM the Bear come out of 
the Wood, and a vaft monftrous one it was, the big- 
geft by far that ever I faw. We were all a little fur- ^ 
prized when we faw him ,• but when Friday faw him, 
it was eafy to fee Joy and Courage in the Fellow's 
Countenance; 0! O! 0! [ays Friday, three times, 
pointing to him ; O Mafter ! Tou give me te Leave, me 
fiakee te Hand with him ; me make you good laugh. 

I was furpriz'd to fee the Fellow fo pleasM,- Tou 
Fool youy fays I, he will eat you up: Eatee me up! 
Eatee me uf!^ fays Friday, twice over again,- Me 
eatee him up,: Me make you good laugh: Tou all ftay 
here, me Jhow- you good laugh i fo down he fits, and 
gets his Boots off in a Moment, and put on a Pair 
of Pumps, (as we call the flat Shoes they wear) 
and which he had in his Pocket, gives my other Ser- 
vant his Horfe, and with his Gun away he flew 
fwift like the Wind. 

The Bear was walking foftly on, and offer'd to 
meddle with no Body, till Friday coming pretty 
near, calls to him, as if the Bear could undcrftand 
himi Hark ye, hark ye, fays Friday, me fpeakeewit 
you: We follow^ at a Diftance; for now being 
come down on the Gafcoign fide of the Mountains", 
we were entred a vaft great Foreft, where the 
Country was plain, and pretty open, though many 
Trees in it fcatter'd here and there.

Prtdayy who had as we fay, the Heels of the Bear; 
came up with him Jquickly, and takes up a great 
iStone, and throws at him; iind hit him juft on the 
Head; but did him no more harm, than if hehatt' 
thrown it againft a Wall ; but it anfwcr*d Fridays 
End ; for the Rogue was fo void of Fear, that he 
did it purely to make the Bear follow him, and 
fhow us fome Laugh as he caird it. 

As foori as the Bear felt the Stone, tind law him, 
he turns about, and comes after him, taking Devi- 
lifli long Strides, and fliuffling along at a ftrangc 
Rate, fo as would have put a Horfe to a midling Gal- 
lop ; away runs Friday^ and takes his Courfe, as if 
he run towards us for Help ; fo we all refolv'd to 
fire at once upon the Bear, and deliver rny Man ; 
though I was angry at him heartily, for bringing 
the Bear back upon us, when he was going about 
his own Bufinefs another Way; and efpecially I 
was angry that he had turned the Bear upon us, and 
then run away ; and I call'd out, Tou Vog, faid I, is 
this your making us laugh ? Come away, and take youir 
Horfe, that we mas Jhoot the Creature ; he hears me, 
and crys out. No Jhoot, no Jhoot, Jland Jlill, you get 
much Laugh. And as the nimble Creature tun two 
Foot for the Beaft's one, he turned on a fudden, oil 
one fide of us, and feeing a great Oak-Tree, fit for 
his Purpofe, he beckon'd to us to follow, and dou*- 
bling his Pace, he gets nimbly up the Tree, laying 
his Gun down upon the Ground, at about five or 
fix Yards from the Bottom of the Tree. 

The Bear foon came to the Tree, and we fol- 
lowed at a Diflance ; the firft Thing he did, he 
flopped at the Gun, fmelt to it, but let it lye, and 
up he fcrambles into the Tree, climbing like a Cati 
though fo monftroufly heavy : I was amaz'datthc

When wc came to the Tree, there was Friday 
got out to the fmall End of a large Limb ^ of the 
Tree, and the Bear got about half way to him"; 
as foon as the Bear got out to that part where the 
Limb of the Tree was weaker. Hay fays he to us, 
nov) you fee me teachee the Bear dance ; fo he falls a 
jumping and fliaking the Bough,, at which the Bear 
began to totter, but. ftood ftill, and began to look 
behrtid him, to fee how he fliould get back ; theti 
indeed we did laugh heartily i But Firiday had not 
done with him by a great deal ; when he fees him 
(land ftill, he calls out to him again; as if he had 
ftipposM the Bear could fpeak Englijb ; Whaty ym 
no come farther? Pray you come farther ; fo he left 
jumping and (baking the Trees; and the Bear, juft 
as it he had underftood what he faid, did come a 
little farther, then he fell a jumping again, and the 
Bear ftopp'd again. 

We thought now was a good time to knock him 
on the Head, and I call'd to Friday to ftand ftiH, 
and we would fhoot the Bear ; but he cry*d out 
earneflly, O pray J Opray! No Jbooty me Jho$t ty and ' 
then-y he would have faid, by and by. However, to 
fliorten the Story, Friday danc'd fo much, and 
the Bear flood fo ticklifh, that we had laughing 
enough indeed, but ftill could not imagine what 
the Fellow would do; for iirft we thought he de- 
pended upon Ihaking the Bear off; and we found 
the Bear was too cunning for that too; for he 
would not go out far enough ro be thrown down, 
but clings faft with his great broad Claws and 
Feet, fo that we could not imagine what would 
be the End of it, and where the Jeft would be «
