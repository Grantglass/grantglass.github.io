THE 



LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

OK 

ROBIXSOS 7 CRUSOE. 



WITH permission, reader, I will 
relate to you the particulars of my 
life, and as but few persons, I fancy, 
ever experienced more difficulties, it 
will probably be in my power to en- 
tertain you. 

I was born in the year 16*32, at 
York ; my father, Mr. Crusoe, having 
acquired a very considerable fortune 
as a merchant, cho^e that city -to 



6 



spend the residue of his life comfort- 
ably in ; but alas, how imperfect is 
-worldly happiness ! when we fancy 
ourselves at the very eve of posses- 
sion, up starts an unexpected some- 
thing which embitters the whole ; for, 
good soul, he had, with the highest 
reputation to himself, surmounted all 
the difficulties in trade. Happy to 
see me growing up promisingly, when 
On a sudden all over was spread the 
most horrible gloominess ; he disco- 
vered my resolution of going to sea. 
One morning he called me into his 
chamber, and with tears in his eyes, 
expostulated with me very freely on 
the subject, "What can possess thee, 
my child," said he, < ( for wishing to 
leave thy native kingdom ? Depend 
on it, travel where you will, by land 



7 



or by water, never will you put foot 
into any country where the blessings 
of life are more generously disposed 
among all ranks of people, and their 
lives and liberties more preserved ; or 
into a climate more adapted to thy 
constitution, than is enjoyed in the 
very country you live so unhappily 
in, and which you now acknowledge 
to me you have resolved upon leav- 
ing. If the advice of a father," said 
lie, " is in your opinion worth follow- 
ing, by all means banish from your 
mind such a foolish scheme ; you 
must be laughed at for it by the 
whole world, as a lad wanting capa- 
city ; nay, yourself must confess the 
idea preposterous ; such a resolution 
is madness in you, which possibly 
might be prudence in another lad, for 



s 



instance, was you the son of a poor 
man, and had got into bad company, 
wherein your character had suffered, 
in that instance the resolution of go- 
ing into strange countries, with the 
intention of retrieving your character 
and fortune would be commendable: 
but as you are by my industry, placed 
above the probability of want, and I 
am convinced you are as much re- 
spected by your acquaintance as ever 
boy was, what can possess thee to 
think of leaving such happiness ; and 
take my word child, if you per- 
sist in the resolution, It will bring you 
many an aching hear/;' which words 
J had too much reason to remember. 

However I was obstinate, and the 
fust, ship that sailed from Mull, car- 
ried me to London. 1 was then about 



9 



nineteen years of age, and being with 
some captains, I said in conversation, 
it was my desire to see the world ; 
one of them answered, he would take 
me with him passage free, if I chose 
to go his voyage, which was to 
Guinea ; I readily accepted this offer, 
and in about seven days the ship 
sailed. We had very boisterous wea- 
ther from the time we left the Downs, 
and at last was taken prisoner by a 
Moorish Rover, who carried us into 
Sal lee ; the cruelty I experienced in 
this country made me resolve to stU 
tempt an escape the first opportunity, 
but it was full three years before I 
had the least chance of effecting it. 

About that time, our governor 
coming into the cells one morning, 
said, he wanted some fisji for a grand 



10 



entertainment, and if either of the 
European slaves understood the art of 
fishing, he should have the liberty of 
going with the negro and his boy in 
a pinnace ; now, as it was always my 
favourite diversion, I answered, if he 
would suffer me to go, I had no doubt 
of bringing home double the quantity 
offish he wanted. He consented, and 
while the negro and his lad were 
getting the boat ready, I was busy in 
carrying in provision, thinking this no 
bad opportunity for me to escape. 
The boat was presently got ready, 
away she sailed, and at the distance of 
two leagues from the shore, the old 
negro prepared to fish, and stooping 
over the side of the pinnace to place 
the net properly, i suddenly took 
hold of his legs and threw him head- 



11 



long into the sea ; then taking up one 
of the muskets (which were always 
kept loaded in the boat) I levelled it 
at his head, and I vowed, that unless 



12 

he immediately turned round and 
swam towards the shore, (for he was 
attempting to get into the boat again) 
I would blow his brains out, and as 
he was an excellent swimmer, I knew 
it was in his power to reach it. The 
weÂ£rro finding me resolute, turned to- 
Wards the shove, and immediately I 
turned to the boy who was steering 
the boat, and told him, that if he 
would obey my orders, lie should fare 
as I* did, which he agreed to, and we 
now stood out to sea. As there was 
a very brisk wind, I presently found 
myself out of the Emperor of Moroc- 
co's dominions. 

Next day as the boat was sailing 
under the shore of some country I was 
a stronger to, on a sudden we heard a 
dreadful howling near us; I must 



13 



pontes I was much frightened, but 
move so on seeing a monstrous beast 
dash himself into the water and swim 
towards us; when he was within 
about ten yards of the boat, I levelled 
my gun at his head and fired, which 
must I think very near have killed 
him, as he was a considerable time m 
returning to the shore. 

The negro boy advised me to turn 
the boat and follow him, but as we 
had so providentially escaped being 
devoured, I thought it not proper to 
run into more danger than was neces- 
sary, so I ordered him to keep his 
course, and directly loaded my gun 
again, for there was plenty of am- 
munition in the boat: we now felt the 
want of nothing but fresh water, and 
that article we were horridly distress- 



ed for. I was exceedingly ple&Wd 
with the lad, for he cheerfully offered 
to go on shore with a great pitches 
and try to find some, but by no 
means would I suffer that, till he had 
made the boat fast and I was ready to 
go along with my two guns ; we tr&i 
veiled full a mile up the country, and 
at last was fortunate enough to fi nd 
an excellent spring ; we were filling 
the pitcher, when on a sudden the 
lad cried, see, Masscr, see, I turned 
round, and at about fifty yards dis- 
tance, under the shade of a hill, sat 
the greatest lion my eyes ever beheld, 
just on the point of darting at us ; 
my guns I had laid on the grass, but 
instantly snatched up the nearest, 
fired, and found I had wounded him. 
It was lucky I had two guns with me, 



15 



blse I had never lived to relate these 
strange adventures, for, instead of 
the lion running away, after I had 
wounded him, he jumped from his 
cave in the greatest anger, towards us, 
and I had but iust time to level the 
second gun which despatched him. 



16 




I was very thankful to God for my 
wonderful escape, and having found 
what we came on shore for, intended 
to make the utmost haste to the boat. 



17 



but the lad pointing to the lion's coat 
and to my body, put it into my head 
to skin him, which we did in two 
hours, and got safe on board the boat. 
I found the skin, when dry, exceeding 
warm and comfortable, it lasted me 
many years, indeed, in the moment I 
am writing these adventures, part of 
that very lion's skin, my waistcoat is 
made of. We now kept sailing on, 
quite ignorant where we were going 
to, till the most dreadful storm sur- 
rounded us, surely, which ever man 
beheld : in a few minutes the sky 
turned black as night, though half an 
hour before the sun told me it was 
noon, the sea rolled mountains high, 
every instant we expected to be our 
last; one moment we were lifted at 
the top of a wave five times higher 



18 



than St. Paxil's, and the next plunged 
as low. At last the poor boy, quite 
exhausted with fatigue, was \vashed 
overboard and lost I was too much 
agitated myself to admit a thought 
respecting him, for in a few minutes 
afterwards the boat went to the bot- 
tom. The first thing I recollect was 
lying on the shore, and seeing the 
water roll towards me and taking me 
about a mile into the sea; another 
took me out to sea again ; in this 
manner was I suspended between 
life and death, till a very large wave 
driving into shore, carried me so far 
on the sands, that the next did not 
reach me, and the storm abating, 
there was I left, till by degress I re- 
covered the use of my reason, and the 
first act I applied it to, was to thank 



19 



God my life was saved, and in a case 
wherein there was some minutes be- 
fore scarce any room to hope. 

Though I had so wonderfully es- 
caped the dangers of the ocean, I now 
had the fear of wild beasts before me, 
a proof this life is intended only as a 
life of trouble, for I am fully persuad- 
ed, none living, let their fortunes, 
friends, health, &c. be ever so exten- 
sive and valuable, can truly assert 
they are now perfectly happy. 

When I had recovered strength to 
rise, I walked into the country and 
had got about three miles from the 
sea, without seeing any thing but 
goats, hares, and an immense number 
of wild fowls, when reaching a very 
high hill, 1 had there the opportunity 
of viewing the country. J found it 



to be an island about ten miles long, 
five miles broad, and very woody ; a 
hundredgloomy ideas presented them- 
selves at this instant I began to fancy 
providence preserved me from the 
dangers of the water, duly to torture 
me with a more cruel and tedious 
death ; but this reflection I was an- 
gry at, so I jumped from the ground, 
and with a thought full of industry, 
said, God has done such wonderful 
loudnesses for me, it is infamous and 
ungrateful in me to complain; hereare 
fowls, goats, and hares in abundance, 
and it is strange if I cannot hunt for 
food ; all I have to pray for is, that 
it is not inhabited by wild creatures 
that will devour me, which, thank 
God, was not the case. 

No human creature but myself was 



01 

X 

on the island, or any offensive animal 
to molest roe. On this island I lived 
fifteen years, subsisting the whole time 
on milk (for I had caught some young 
goats and brought them up tame) and 
what fowls I caught in the woods by 
laying springs and traps in the night, 
and with the assistance of some fire arms 
which I saved from the wreck of a ves- 
sel soon after my being cast on shore. 

One dav about noon sroing into the 
woods after some of my bird-traps, I 
thÂ»uffht I should have sunk into the 
ground through fear, every joint of 
me trembled at the sight, it was the 
print of a man's foot, Good God ! O! 
what did I see, I was confident it was 
not the mark of my own, for besides 
it being a deal larger, I had not 
been in that part for a month, and 



that print was quite fresh, [ ran like 
lightning to my home, which was Â« 
Kind of cave overgrown with tree 
mid threw myself dov/n. on a parcel of 
dry leaves, which for some years had 
served me as a bed, there I lay three 
days and nights, without a morsel of 
food or sleep, so distressed was I at 
discovering there was on the island 
more human creatures than myself, 
who I feared would murder me- 
hunger at last obliged me to look for 
food, and surely never poor creature 
ventured out of his hiding place with 
so much fearfulness as I did out of 
my cave. 

I was terrified at every leaf that 
moved, but having no farther reason 
to fancy my fears well grounded I 
concluded the mark was from my 



23 



own foot, so was tolerably easy ; but 
soon afterwards I was thoroughly con- 
vinced of the contrary, for ranging 
through the woods as was my usual 
custom, for food, I discovered, one 
day, five canoes full of savages, within 
half a league of the shore, and mak- 
ing to it as fast as they possibly could. 
I secreted myself near enough to dis- 
cover what they were about, and 
found the canoes landed all the In- 
dians, but two of them were chained 
together, who cried piteously ; they 
presently made a large fire, cut the 
throat of one of the two, broiled his 
flesh on the fire, and eat it: never did 
1 behold a sight that filled me with 
horror equal to this, however shocked 
as 1 was, prudence kept me quiet. 
When they had eat as much of the 



2* 

poor creature as they chose, they were 
preparing to despatch the other, but 
just as they had unbound him, and 
going to give the finishing stroke, by 
the greatest agility I ever beheld, he 
slipped under their arms, and ran into 
the woods; he made towards the 
place where I lay concealed, and on 
that account 1 was alarmed for my 
own safety ; three of the savages I 
saw follow him, and I knew nothing 
but a stout resistance on my part 
could be of service, J presented my 
loaded piece which I had then with 
me, and prepared to receive them * 
presently the savage who was to have 
been roasted, came running quite out 
oi breath, he was ready to die at the 
mght of me, thanking he had only 
run twin one danger to another, so 



on 

endeavoured to avoid me, but that I 
prevented; he then fell on the ground, 
and taking hold of one of my feet, put 
his head to the earth and my foot up- 
on it, which I considered as a token 



2() 

of his wish to be my servant ; it turned 
out so, Â«nd a more faithful, diligent 
fellow never lived ; his pursuers soon 
gave him up, and returned to their 
own country. 

Ever since I left England, every 
day I have made a notch in a piece of 
wood, to act as my almanack, by that 
means I was informed, even in this 
melancholy island, which was the 
Sabbath, and most part of that day, 
on my knees 1 spent in prayer. This 
wooden almanack now told me it was 
Friday the savages came, so having 
no other name at hand, I christened 
him Friday. I soon taught him to 
understand me, and as he was an in* 
dustrious fellow, I now lived with 
less trouble than before I had him, 
for he easily killed game enough for us 



27 



both. In this state five years passed 
without having another visit from 
the barbarians ; at that time we dis- 
covered several canoesmakingtowards 
our shore-, Friday said he was sure 
they were on the same business again, 
so I ordered him to fetch my two 
fowling pieces from my cave, and 
said, <f Â°now Friday, will you standby 
me and help me to prevent these hor- 
rid savages from accomplishing their 
cruel purpose." Fie quickly answered, 
(( Ycs indeed Masser, yes hukedMaster, 
we will, ?ve mill" As \ knew the man 
to be honest, I could depend upon 
him, so I resolved to do all in my 
power to prevent the scene they were 
going to exhibit. When Friday rev 
turned, the savages were got out of 
their canoe*, so I found no Uric was 



28 



to be lost; away we ran, each having 
an excellent fowling piece and placed 
ourselves behind a very large tree 
entirely unseen, and at the distance,' 
of about fifty yards ; five prisoners 
were chained, and eight savages 
pulling them out of the canoes, and 
placing them in a row. I saw the 
fire kindling, "now," said I, " Friday 
do your best and discharge your piece 
as soon as I have fired mine." We 
fired, and reloaded ; in less than five 
minutes six of the wretches lay dead 
upon the sands, and the other two. 
leaping into the sea, no doubt were 
drowned. I then turned to the five 
poor souls who stood trembling, and 
c-rpecting me to serve them as I had 
the others ; but presently I convinced 
themof my friendship. I now thought 



29 



poor Friday was really distracted, till 
I learned his joy was occasioned by 
the sight of his father, who was one 
of thefive we happily saved. 



30 



The other four were Spaniards, all 
prisoners taken in war a few days 
before, by the savage nation, and their 
practice was to eat all those who fell 
into their hands. 

We were now seven in number, and 
very fortunately an English merchant 
ship, homeward bound, was by con- 
trary winds drove near our island; 
we made a large fire in the woods one 
night to convince the crew of the 
ship the island was inhabited ; next 
morning twenty sailors came on shore 
well armed, we soon convinced them 
of oar friendship, and treated them 
with the best the island produced; 
in return they generously took us on 
board to Liverpool, from thence I 
went to York, but was greatly shocked 
at the news I received ; my rambling 



31 



disposition, I found, had brought my 
dear father and mother to their graves, 
they both died soon after I left Hull. 

I cannot express the agony it causes 
in me ; I consider myself as the au- 
thor of their deaths ; and though pro- 
perty sufficient is left for me to live 
like a gentleman, I cannot have peace 
to enjoy it ; and at this moment I 
really believe myself the most miser- 
able object living, and heartily I re- 
pent giving way to that restless dis- 
position which made me leave my 
parents, as from that hour I date all 
the subsequent misfortunes of my life. 

THE END.
