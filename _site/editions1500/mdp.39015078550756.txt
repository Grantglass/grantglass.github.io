THE LIFE OF DANIEL DE FOE.
THE original author of Robinson Crusoe was Daniel Foe,
which, from caprice, or some other motive, he lengthened
with a prefix, calling himself De Foe. He was a native of
London, born in the year 1600, of humble parentage, his
father, James Foe, exercising the occupation of a butcher.
Daniel De Foe, in the commencement of his career, engaged
In trade: from the business of a hosier he passed to that of
a pantile maker, without any good fortune. Either from
want of prudence, or from dislike to his occupations, the
only reward of his schemes was embarrassment and distress.
In the speculations of the literary world he was more for-
tunate. In 1701, when King William, during the violence
of parties, was censured for his attachment to, and employ-
ment of foreigners, De Foe espoused the cause of his monarch,
and ridiculed his enemies in a satirical poem, called "The
True-born Englishman." This production was honoured
with an enormous sale : and he was encouraged to write
another satire, entitled, "Reformation of Manners," in
which he attacked the vices of some persons of eminent rank.
A pamphlet, called "The Shortest Way with the Dis-
twas so mistaken, or so misrepresented, that it was
declared by the House of Commons to be of a libellous na-
ture. De Foe, for his offence, was subjected to fine, impri-
sonment, and even the pillory. He did not give his enemies
much reason to exult over his despondence; for the subject
which he took to amuse his prison hours, was "A Hymn
to the Pillory." During his confinement he also undertook
enriched our language with essays of incomparable beauty.
De Foe was employed in promoting the union of England
and Scotland, of which event he also wrote the history.
Whatever glory he gained from interfering in the bitter
differences of politics, he gained little solid satisfaction. A
second imprisonment, which he suffered, taught him the
fate which he was to expect from the animosity of political
opponents. He began to take a more quiet and useful path
of literature in 1715, and published a religious work, called
Vi. LIFE OF DANIEL DE FOE.
*' TheFamily Instructor." Of the multitude of his other
productions specific notice is scarcely necessary. It is suffi-
cient to mention " The History of the Plague in I60S;" a
novel, entitled, " The History of Colonel Jack"—"A 7teie
Voyage round the World, by a Company of Merchants,"—
-" The History of Roxana,"—" The Memoirs of a Cava-
lier,"—" The History of Moll Flanders," and a book, en-
titled *' Religious Courtship," which has passed through
numerous editions.
But De Foe's reputation, in the present day, rests ch:cfly
upon his "Robinson Crusoe," a work which almost every
one has read in h:s childhood, and the pleasing impressions
of which are scarcely obliterated from the memory in old
age. Its simple and perspicuous style is admirably suited
to the capacity of youth; it possesses enough of the mar-
vellous to seize and delight the imagination; and the senti-
ments which it inspires are such as need not be renounced
or corrected in mature age. Respecting this work there is
a story which it is incumbent to relate, although it has never
been fairly authenticated. It has been affirmed, (says the
Encyclopedia Britannica,}that when Captain Woodes
Rogers touched at the island of Juan Fernandez, in the
South Sea, he brought away Alexander Selkirk, a Scotch
man, who, having been left ashore there, had lived upon
the island in desolate solitude for the space of four years.
When Selkirk returned to England, it is said, that he wrote
a narrative of his adventures, and put the papers into the
hands of De Foe, to digest for publication; but that he un-
generously converted the materials into the celebrated
"History of Robinson Crusoe." Part of this story may be
true, and part false. That De Foe might have had the in-
spection of Selkirk's journal, is very possible; and by his
powers of description, and skill in composition, he might
have expanded into an entertaining narrative, what in its
original form was a dull and awkward composition. But
that he was guilty of any fraud or injustice towards Selkirk,
is a suspicion which his character of general integrity should
Induce us to reject. As there is no credible proof against
him, we are bound to give him an acquittal, both because
he is not able to vindicate himself, and one who has so
entertained the rising generation, hus more than an ordinary
right not to be condemned upon doubtful accusation.
Daniel De Foe died at Islington, in the year 1731. His
daughter was respectably settled in life, by marrying Henry
Baker, an eminent naturalist.
ROBINSON CRUSOE.
I WAS born in the year 1632, in the city of York,
of a good family, though not of that country, my
father being a foreigner of Bremen, who settled first
at Hull. He got a good estate by merchandise, and,
leaving off his trade, lived afterwards at York: from
whence he had married my mother, whose relations
were named Robinson, a very good family in that
country, and from whom I was called Mobimon
Kreu.tzr.aer; but, by the usual corruption of words
in England, we are now called, nay, we call ourselves,
and write our name, Crusoe; and so my companions
always called me.
I had two elder brothers; one of whom was
lientenant-colonel to an English regiment of foot in
Flanders, formerly commanded by the famous Colonel
Lockhart, and was killed at the battle near Dunkirk
against the Spaniards. What became of my second
brother I never knew, any more than my father or
mother did know what became of me.
Being the third son of the family, and not bred to
any trade, my head began to be filled very early with
rambling thoughts. My father, who was very an-
cient, had given me a competent share of learning,
as far as house-education and a country free-school
generally goes, and designed me for the law; but I
would be satisfied with nothing but going to sea;
and my inclination to this led me so strongly against
the will, nay, the commands of my father, and
against all the entreaties and persuasions of my
mother «and other friends, that there seemed to be
something fataHn that propension of nature, tending
directly to that life of misery which was to befal me.
My father, a wise and grave man, gave me serious
and excellent counsel against what he foresaw was
my design. He called me one morning into his
chamber, where he was confined by the gout, and
expostulated very warmly with me upon this subject.
He asked me what reasons, more than a mere wan-
dering inclination, I had for leaving my father's
house, and my native country; where I might be
well introduced, and had a prospect of raising my
fortune by application and industry, with a life of
ease and pleasure. He told me it was men of des-
perate fortunes on one hand, or of aspiring superior
fortunes on the other, who went abroad upon adven-
tures, to rise by enterprise, and make themselves
famous in undertakings of a nature out of the common
road; that these things were all either too far above
me, or too far below me; and that mine was the
middle state, or what might be called the upper sta-
tion of low life, which he had found, by long expe-
rience, was the best state in the world, the most
suited to human happiness, not exposed to the mise-
ries and hardships, the labour and sufferings, of the
mechanic part of mankind, and not embarassed with
the pride, luxury, ambition, and envy of the upper
part of mankind. He told me I might judge of the
happiness of this state by this one thing, viz. that
this was the state of life which all other people en-
vied; that kings have frequently lamented the miser-
able consequences of being born to great things, and
wished they had been placed in the middle of the
two extremes, between the mean and the great; that
the Wise Man gave his testimony to this, as the just
standard of true felicity, when he prayed to have
neither poverty nor riches.
He bade me observe it, and I should always find,
that the calamities of life were shared among the
upper and lower part of mankind; but that the mid-
dle station had the fewest disasters; and was not
exposed to so many vicissitudes as the higher or
lower part of mankind; nay, they were not subjected
to so many distempers and uneasinesses, either of
body or mind, as those were, who, by vicious living,
luxury, and extravagancies on one hand, or by hard
labour, want of necessaries, and mean or insufficient
diet, on the other hand, bring distempers upon them-
selves by the natural consequences of their way of
living; that the middle station of life was calculated
for all kind of virtues, and all kind of enjoyments;
that peace and plenty were the handmaids of a
middle fortune; that temperance, moderation, quiet-
ness, health, society, all agreeable diversions, and all
desirable pleasures, were the blessings attending the
middle station of life; that this way men went
silently and smoothly through the world, and com-
fortably out of it; not embarrassed with the labours
of the hands, or of the head; not sold to a life of
slavery for daily bread, or harrassed with perplexed
circumstances, which rob the soul of peace and the
body of rest; nor enraged with the passion of envy,
or the secret burning lust of ambition for great things;
but in easy circumstances, sliding gently through the
world, and sensibly tasting the sweets ofliving, with-
out the bitter; feeling that they are happy, and learn-
ing by every day's experience to know it more sensibly.
After this, he pressed me earnestly, and In the most
affectionate manner, not to play the young man, nor
to precipitate myself into miseries, which nature, and
the station of life I was born in, seemed to have pro-
vided against; that I was under no necessity of
seeking my bread; that he would do well for me,
aud endeavour to enter me fairly into the station of
life which he had been just recommending to me;
and that if I was not very easy and happy in the
world, it must be my mere fate, or fault, that must
hinder it; and that he should have nothing whatever
to answer for, having thus discharged his duty in
warning me against measures which he knew would
be to my hurt. In a word, that as he would do very
kind things for me, if I would stay and settle at home
as he directed, so he would not have so much hand
in my misfortunes, as to give me any encouragement
to go away; and to close all, he told me, I had an
eldrer brother for an example, to whom he had used
the same earnest persuasions to keep him from going
into the Low Country wars, but could not prevail, his
young desires prompting him to run into the army,
where he was killed ; and though he said he would
not cease to pray for me, yet he would venture to say
to me, that if I did take this foolish step, God would
not bless me; and I would have leisure hereafter to
reflect upon having neglected his counsel, when there
might be none to assist in my recovery.
I observed in this last part of his discourse, which
was truly prophetic, though I suppose my father did
not know it to be so himself, I say, I observed the
tears run down his face very plentifully, especially
when he spoke of my brother who was killed; and
that when he spoke of my having leisure to repent,
and none to assist me, he was so moved that he broke
off the discourse, and told me his heart was SO full
he could say no more to me.
I was sincerely affected with this discourse, as
indeed who could be otherwise? And I resolved not
to think of going abroad any more, but to settle at
home according to my father's desire. But, alas! a
few days wore it all off; and, in short, to prevent
any of my father's farther importunities, in a few
weeks after I resolved to run quite away from him.
However, I did not act so hastily neither, as the first
heat of my resolution prompted; but I took my
mother at a time when I thought her a little plea-
santer than ordinary, aud told her, that my thoughts
were so entirely bent upon seeing the world, that I
should never settle to any thing with resolution
enough to go through with it; and my father had
better give me his consent, than force me to go without
it; that I was now eighteen years old, which was too
late to go apprentice to a trade, or clerk to an attor-
ney, that I was sure, if I did, I should never serve
out my time, but I should certainly run away from
my master before my time was out, and go to sea;
and if she would speak to my father to let me go one
voyage abroad, if I came home again and did not like
it, I would go no more, and I would promise by a
double diligence to recover the time I had lost.
This put my mother into a great passion. She
told me, she knew it would be to no purpose to speak
to my father upon such subject; that he knew too
well what was my interest, to give his consent to any
thing, so much for my hurt; and that she wondered
how I could think of any such thing, after the dis-
course I had had with my father, and such kind and
tender expressions, as she knew my father had used
to me; and that, in short, if I would ruin myself,
there was no help for me; but I might depend I
should never have their consent to it; that, for her
part, she would not have so much hand in my de-
struction, and I should never have it to say, that my
mother was willing when my father was not.
Though my mother refused to move it to my father,
yet I heard afterward that she reported all the dis-
course to him; and that my father, after showing a
great concern at it, said to her, with a sigh, "That
the boy might be happy, if he would stay at home;
but if he goes abroad, he will be the most miserable
\vretchthateverwasborn: lean give no consent to it."
It was not till almost a year after this that I broke
loose, though in the mean time I continued obsti-
nately deaf to all proposals of settling to business,
and frequently expostulating with my father and
mother about their being so positively determined
against what they knew my inclination prompted me
to. But being one day at Hull, whither I went casu-
ally, and without any purpose of making an elope-
ment at that time; but, I say, being there, and one
of my companions being going by sea to London, in
his father's ship, and prompting me to go with them,
with the common allurement of a sea-faring man,
that it should cost me nothing for my passage, I con-
sulted neither father nor mother any more, nor so
much as sent them word of it, but leaving them to
hear of it as they might, without asking God's bless-
ing, or my father's, without any consideration of cir-
cumstances or consequences, and in an ill hour, God
knows, on the first of September, 1051, I went on
board a ship bound for London. Never any young
adventurer's misfortunes, I believe, began sooner, or
continued longer, than mine. The ship was no sooner
got out of the Humber, but the wind began to blow,
and the sea to rise in a most frightful manner ; and,
as I had never seen the sea before, I was most inex-
pressibly sick in body and terrified in mind. I be-
gan now seriously to reflect upon what I had done,
and how justly I was overtaken by the judgment of
heaven, for my wicked leaving my father's house, and
abandoning my duty. All the good counsel of my
parents, my father's tears, and my mother's entreaties,
came now fresh into my mind, and my conscience,
which was not yet come to the pitch of hardness to
which it has been since, reproached me with the
contempt of advice, and the breach of my duty to
God and my father.
All this while the storm increased, and the sea
went very high, though nothing like what I have seen
many times since, no, nor what I saw a few days after.
But it was enough to affect me then, who was but a
young sailor, and had never known any thing of the
matter. I expected every wave would have swallowed
us up, and that every time the ship fell down, as I thought it did, in the trough or hollow of the sea, we
should never rise more. In this agony of mind, I
made my vows and resolutions, that if it pleased God
to spare my life in this one voyage, if ever I once got
my foot upon dry land again, I would go directly
home to my father, and never set it into a ship again
while I lived; that I would take his advice, and ne-
ver run myself into such miseries as these any more.
Now I saw plainly the goodness of his observations
about the middle station of life, how easy, how com-
fortable, he had lived all his days, and never had been
exposed to tempests at sea, or troubles on shore;
and, in short, I resolved that I would, like a true
repenting prodigal, go home to my father.
These wise and sober thoughts continued all the
while the storm continued, and, indeed, some time
after; but the next day the wind was abated, and
the sea calmer, and I began to be a little inured to it.
However, I was very grave for all that day, being
also a little sea-sick still; but towards night the
weather cleared up, the wind was quite over, and a
charming fine evening followed; the sun went down
perfectly clear, and rose so the next morning, and
having little or no wind, and a smooth sea, the sun
shining upon it, the sight was, as I thought, the most
delightful that ever I saw.
I had slept well in the night, and was now no more
sea-sick, but very cheerful; looking with wonder
upon the sea, that was so rough and terrible the day
before, and could be so calm and so pleasant in so
little a time after. And now, lest my good resolu-
tions should continue, my companion, who had, in-
deed, enticed me away, comes to me—" Well Bob,"
said he, clapping me upon the shoulder, " how do you
do after it? I warrant you were frightened, wa'n't
you call that a storm?" Why it was nothing at
all; give us but a good ship and sea-room, and
we think nothing of such a squall of wind as that;
but you're but a fresh-water sailor, Bob. Come, let
us make a bowl of punch, and we'll forget all that.
D'you see what charming weather 'tis now 1" To
make short this sad part of my story, we went the
way of all sailors; the punch was made, and I was
made half drunk with it, and in that one night's
wickedness I drowned all my repentance, all my re-
flections upon my past conduct, and all my resolu-
tions for the future. In a word, as the sea was re-
turned to its smoothness of surface, and settled calm-
ness, by the abatement of that storm, so the hurry of
my thoughts being over, my fears and apprehensions
of my being swallowed up by the sea being forgotten,
and the current of my former desires returned, I en-
tirely forgot the vows and promises that I made in
my distress. I found, indeed, some intervals of re-
flection, and the serious thoughts did, as it were,
endeavour to return again sometimes; but I shook
them off, and roused myself from them, as it were
from a distemper; and, applying myself to drinking
and company, soon mastered the return of those fits, (for so I called them): and I had, in five or six days,
got as complete a victory over conscience, as any
young fellow that resolved not to be troubled with it
could desire. But I was to have another trial for it
still, and Providence, as in such cases it generally
docs, resolved to leave me entirely without excuse,
for, if I would not take this for a deliverance, the
next was to be such a one as the worst and most
hardened wretch among us would confess both the
danger and the mercy.
The sixth day of our being at sea, we came into
Yarmouth Roads, the wind having been contrary,
and the weather calm, we had made but little way
since the storm. Here we were obliged to come to
an anchor, and here we lay, the wind continuing con-
trary, viz. at southwest, for seven or eight days;
during which time a great many ships from Newcastle
came into the same roads, as the common harbour
where the ships might wait for a wind for the river.
We had not, however, rid here so long, but we
should have tided it up the river, but that the wind
blew too fresh, and, after we had lain four or five
days, blew very hard. However, the roads being
reckoned as good as a harbour, the anchorage good,
and our ground-tackle very strong, our men were
unconcerned, and not in the least apprehensive of
danger, but spent the time in rest ana mirth, after
the manner at sea; but the eighth day in the morn-
ing the wind increased, and we had all hands at work
to strike our topmasts, and make every thing snug
and close, that the ship might ride as easy as possi-
ble. By noon the sea went very high indeed, and
our ship rid forecastle in, shipped several seas, and
we thought once or twice our anchor had come home,
upon which our master ordered out the sheet anchor,
so that we rode with two anchors a-head, and the
cables veered out to the better end.
By this time it blew a terrible storm indeed, and
now I began to see terror and amazement in the faces
even of the seamen themselves. The master, though
vigilant in the business of preserving the ship, yet,
as he went in and out of his cabin by me, I could
hear him, softly to himself, say several times, " Lord
be merciful to us! We shall be all lost; we shall be
undone!" and the like. During these first hurries
I was stupid, lying still in my cabin, which was in
the steerage, and cannot describe my temper. I
could ill resume the first penitence, which I had so
apparently trampled upon, and hardened myself
against. I thought the bitterness of death had been
past, and that this would be nothing, too, like the
first. But when the Inastcr himself came by me, as
I said just now, and said we should be all lost, I was
dreadiullyfrightened. I got up out of my cabin, and
looked out; but such a dismal sight I never saw;
the sea went mountains high, and broke upon us
every three or four minutes. When I could look
about, I could see nothing but distress around us.
Two ships that rid near us, we found had cut their
masts by the board, being deep loaden; and our men
cried out, that a ship, which rid about a mile ahead of us, was foundered. Two more ships, being driven
from their anchors, were run out of the roads to sea,
at all adventures, and not a mast standing. The
light ships fared the best, as not so much labouring
in the sea; but two or three of them drove, and came
close by us, running away, with only their sprit-sail
out before the wind.
Towards the evening the mate and boatswain beg-
ged the master of our ship to let them cut away the
fore-mast, which he was very unwilling to do; but
the boatswain protesting to him, that if he did not,
the ship would fo under, he consented; and when they
had cut away the fore-mast, the main-mast stood so
loose, and shook the ship so much, they were obliged
to cut her away also, and make a clear deck.
Any one may judge what a condition I must be in
at all this, who was but a young sailor, and who had
been in such a fright before at but a little. But, if I
can express at this distance the thoughts I had about
me at that time, I was in ten-fold more horror of
mind upon account of my former convictions, and the
having returned from them to the resolutions I had
wickedly taken at first, than I was at death itself;
and these, added to the terrors of the storm, put me
into such a condition, that I can by no words describe
it. But the worst was not come yet; the storm con-
tinued with such fury, that the seamen themselves
acknowledged they had never seen a worse. We had
a good ship, but she was deep loaden, and so wallowed
in the sea, that the seamen every now and then cried
out she would founder. It was my advantage, in one
respect, that I did not know what they meant by
founder, till I inquired. However, the storm was so
violent, that I saw what is not often seen, the master,
the boatswain, and some others, more sensible than
the rest, at their prayers, and expecting every mo-
ment when the ship would go to the bottom. In the
middle of the night, and under all the rest of our distresses, one of the men that had been down on
purpose to see, cried out we had sprung a leak, ano-
ther said there was four feet water in the hold. Then
all hands were called to the pump. At that very
word my heart, as I thought, died within me, and I
fell backwards upon the side of the bed where I sat,
into the cabin. However, the men roused me, and
told me, that I that was able to do nothing before.
was as well able to pump as another; at which I
stirred up, and went to the pump, and worked very
heartily. While this was doing, the master, seeing
some light colliers, who, not able to ride out the
storm, were obliged to slip and run away to sea, and
would come near us, ordered a gun to be fired as a
signal of distress. I, who knew nothing what that
meant, was so surprised, that I thought the ship had
broke, or some dreadful thing happened. In a word,
I was so surprised that I fell down in a swoon. As
this was a time when every body had his own life to
think of, nobody minded me, or what was become of
me, but another man stepped up to the pump, and,
thrusting me aside with his foot, let me lie, thinking
I had been dead; and it was a great while before I
came to myself.
We worked on, but the water increasing in the
hold, it was apparent that the ship would founder,*
and though the storm began to abate a little, yet as
it was not possible she could swim till we might run
into any port, so the master continued firing guns
for help, and a light ship, who had rid it out just
a-head of us, ventured a boat out to help us. It was
with the utmost hazard that the boat came near us, but it was impossible for us to get on board, or for
u
the boat to lie near the ship-side, till at last the men
rowing very heartily, and venturing their lives to
save ours, our men cast them a rope over the stern
with a buoy to it, and then veered it out at a great
length, which they, after much labour and hazard,
took hold of, and we hauled them close under our
stern, and got all into their boat. It was to no pur-
pose for them or us, after we were in the boat, to
think of reaching to their own ship, so all agreed to
let her drive, and only to pull her in towards the
shore as much as we could; and our master promised
them, that if the boat was staved upon shore, he
would make it good to their master. So partly
rowing, and partly driving, our boat went away to
the northward, sloping towards the shore, almost as
far as Wintertonness.
We were not much more than a quarter of an hour
out of our ship, but we saw her sink, and then I
understood, for the first time, what was meant by a
ship foundering in the sea. I must acknowledge I
had hardly eyes to look up, when the seamen told me she was sinking, for, from that moment, they
rather put me into the boat, than that I might
be said to go in; my heart was, as it were, dead
within me, partly with fright, partly with horror of
mind, and the thoughts of what was yet before me.
While we were in this condition, the men yet la-
bouring at the oar to bring the boat near the shore,
we could see (when our boat mountingthe waves, we
were able to see the shore) a great many people
running along the strand to assist us when we should
come near. But we made but slow way towards the
shore; nor were we able to reach the shore, till,
being past the light-house at Winterton, the shore
falls off to the westward towards Cromcr, and so the
land broke a little the violence of the wind. Here we
got in; and, though not without much difficulty, got
all safe on shore, and walked afterward on foot to
Yarmouth, where, ai unfortunate men, we were used
with great humanity, as well by the magistrates of
the town, who assigned us good quarters, as by parti-
cular merchants and owners of ships; and had money
given us sufficient to carry us either to London, or
back to Hull, as we thought fit.
Had I now had the sense to have gone back to
Hull, and have gone home, I had been happy, and
my father, an emblem of our blessed Saviour's para-
ble, had even killed the fatted calf for me; for, hear-
ing the ship I went away in was cast away in Yar-
mouth roads, it was a great while before he had any
assurances that I was not drowned.
But my ill fate pushed me on now with an obsti-
nacy that nothing could resist; and though I had
several times loud calls for my reason and my more
composed judgment, to go home, yet I had no power
to do it. I know not what to call this; nor will I
urge, that it is a secret overruling decree, that hur-
ries us on to be the instruments of our own destruc-
tion, even though it be before us, and that we push
upon it with our eyes open. Certainly, nothing but
some such decreed unavoidable misery attending,
and which it was impossible for me to escape, could
have pushed me forward against the calm reasonings
and persuasions of my most retired thoughts, and
against two such visible instructions as I had met
with in my first escape.
My comrade, who had helped to harden me before,
and who was the master's son, was now less forward
than I. The first time he spoke to me after we were
at Yarmouth, which was not till two or three days,
for we were separated in the town to several quar-
ters; I say, the first time he saw me, it appeared
his tone was altered; and, looking very melancholy, and shaking his head, asked me how I did: and
telling his father who I was, and how I had come
this voyage only for a trial, in order to go farther
abroad; his father turning to me with a very grave
and concerned tone, " Young man," says he, "you
B 2
ought never to go to sea any more; you ought to
take this for a plain and visible token, that you are
not to be a seafaring man."—" Why, sir," said I,
"will you go to sea no more?"—"That is another
case," said he; "it is my calling, and therefore my
duty; but as you made this voyage for a trial, you
see what a taste Heaven has given you of what you
are to expect if you persist: perhaps all this has
befallen us on your account, like Jonah in the ship
of Tarshish. Pray," continued he, "what are you?
and on what account did you go to sea?" Upon that
I told him some of my story ; at the end of which he
burst out with a strange kind of passion, " What had
I done," says he, "that such an unhappy wretch
should come into my ship? I would not set my foot
in the same ship with thee again for a thousand
pounds!" This, indeed, was, as I said, an excursion
of his spirits, which were yet agitated by the sense
of his loss, and was" farther than he could have
authority to go. However, he afterwards talked
very gravely to me, exhorting me to go back to my
father, and not tempt Providence to my'ruin; told
me I might see a visible hand of Heaven against me:
"and, young man," said he, " depend upon it, if you
do not go back, wherever you go, you will meet with -
nothing but disasters and disappomtments, till your
father's words are fulfilled upon you."
We parted soon after; for I made him little answer,
and I saw him no more: which way he went, I know
not, As, for me, having some money in my pocket,
I travelled to London by land, and there, as well as
on the road, had many struggles with myself what
course of life I should take, and whether I should go
home, or go to sea.
As to going home, shame opposed the best motions
that offered to my thoughts; and it immediately oc-
curred to me how I should be laughed at among the
neighbours, and should be ashamed to see, not my
father and mother only, but even every body else.
From whence I have since often observed how incon-
grnous and irrational the common temper of mankind
is, especially of youth, to that reason that ought to
guide them in such cases; viz. that they are not
ashamed of the action for which they ought justly to
be esteemed fools, but are ashamed of the returning,
which only can make them esteemed wise men. In this state of life, however, I remained some
time, uncertain what measures to take, and what
course of life to lead. An irresistible reluctance
continued to going home; and, as I stayed awhile,
the remembrance of the distress I had been in wore
off; and as that abated, the little motion I had in my
desires to return wore off with it, till at last I quite laid
aside the thoughts of it, and looked out for a voyage.
That evil influence which carried me first away
from my father's house, which hurried me into the
wild and indigested notion of raising my fortune, and
that impressed those conceits so forcibly upon me as
to make me deaf to all good advice, and to the en-
treaties, and even the commands, of my father; I
say, the same influence, whatever it was, presented
the most unfortunate of all enterprises to my view,
I went on board a vessel bound to the coast of Africa,
or, as our sailors vulgarly call it, a voyage to Guinea.
It was my great misfortune, that, in all these ad-
ventures, I did not ship myself as a sailor; whereby,
though I might indeed have worked a little harder
than ordinary, yet at the same time I had learned
the duty and office of a fore-mast man, and in time
might have qualified myself for a mate or lieutenant, if not for a master. But as it was always my fate
to choose for a worse, so I did here; for, having
money in my pocket, and good clothes on my back,
I would always go on board in the habit of a gentle-
man, and so I neither had any business in the ship,
nor learned to do any.
It was my lot first of all to fall into pretty good
company in London, which does not always happen
to such loose and unguided young fellows as I then
was; the devil, generally, not omitting to lay some
snare for them very early; but it was not so with
me. I first fell acquainted with the master of a ship
who had been on the coast of Guinea, and who,
having had very good success there, was resolved to
go again. This captain, taking a fancy to my con-
versation, which was not disagreeable at that time,
hearing me say I had a mind to see the world, told
me, if I would go the voyage with him, I should be
at no expense; I should be his messmate, and his
companion; and if I could carry any thing with me,
I should have all the advantage of it that the trade
would admit; and perhaps I might meet with some
encouragement.
I embraced the offer, and, entering into a strict
friendship with this captain, who was an honest
plain-dealing man, went the voyage with him, and
carried a small adventure with me, which, by the dis-
interested honesty of my friend the captain, I increased very considerably; for I carried about 40/. in such
toys and trifles as the captain directed me to buy.
This 401. I had mustered together by the assistance
of some of my relations whom I correspondedwith, and
who, I believe, got my father, or at least my mother,
to contribute so much as that to my first adventure.
This was the only voyage which I may say was
successful in all my adventures, and which I owe to
the integrity and honesty of my friend the captain,
under whom I also got a competent knowledge of the
mathematics, and the rules of navigation; learned
how to keep an account of the ship's course, take an
observation, and, in short, to understand some things
that were needful to be understood by a sailor; for,
as he took delight to instruct me, I took delight to
learn; and, in a word, this voyage made me both a.
sailor and a merchant; for I brought home five
pounds nine ounces of gold dust for my adventure,
which yielded me in London, at my return, almost
Mot.. and this filled me with those aspiring thoughts
whichTiave since so completed my ruin.
Yet, even in this voyage, I had my misfortunes too,
particularly that I was continually sick, being thrown
into a violent calenture by the excessive heat of the
climate, our principal trading being upon the coast,
from the latitude ot 15 deg. N. even to the line itself.
I was now set up for a Guinea trader; and my
friend, to my great misfortune, dying soon after his
arrival, I resolved to go the same voyage, and had
now got the command of the ship. This was the un-
happiest voyage that ever man made; for though I
did not carry off quite 10(M. of my new-gained
wealth, so that I had iiOOZ. left, and which I lodged
with my friend's widow, who was very just to me.
yet I fell into terrible misfortunes in this voyage; and
the first was this, viz. our ship, making her course to-
wards the Canary islands, or rather between those
islands and the African shore, was surprised in the
gray of the morning by a Moorish rover of Sallee, who
gave chase to us with all the sail she could make. We
crowded also as much canvas as our yards would spread, or our masts carry, to have got clear; but,
finding the pirate gained upon us, and would cer-
tainly come up with us in a few hours, we prepared
to fight, our ship having twelve guns, and the rogue
eighteen. About three in the afternoon he came up
with us, and bringing to, by mistake, just athwart
our quarter, instead of athwart our stern, as he in-
tended, we brought eight of our guns to bear on that
side, and poured in a broadside upon him, which
made him sheer off again, after returning our fire,
and pouring in also his small shot from near two
hundred men, which he had on board. However, we
had not a man touched, all our men keeping close.
He prepared to attack us again, and we to defend
ourselves; but, laying us on board the next time
upon our other quarter, he entered ninety men upon
our decks, who immediately fell to cutting and
hacking the decks and rigging. We plied them with
small shot, half-pikes, powder chests, and such like,
and cleared our decks of them twice. However, to
cut short this melancholy part of our story, the ship
being disabled, and three of our men killed and eight wounded, we were obliged to yield, and were carried
prisoners into Sallee, a port belonging to the Moors.
The usage I had there was not so dreadful as at
first I apprehended; nor was I carried up the coun-
try, to the emperor's court, as the rest of our men
were, but was kept by the captain of the rover as his
proper prize, and made his slave, being young and
nimble, and fit for business. At this surprising
change of my circumstances, from a merchant to a
miserable slave, I was perfectly overwhelmed; and
now I looked back upon my father's prophetic dis-
course to me, that I should be miserable, and have none to relieve me, which I thought was now so
effectually brought to pass, that I could not be worse;
that now the hand of Heaven had overtaken me,
and I was undone without redemption. But, alas!
this was but a taste of the misery I was to go through,
as will appear in the sequel of this story.
As my new patron or master had taken me home
to his house, so I was in hopes that he would take
me with him when he went to sea again, believing
that it would be some time or other his fate to be
taken by a Spanish or Portugal man of war, and that
then I should be set at liberty. But this hope of
mine was soon taken away; for when he went to
sea. he left me on shore to look after his little garden,
and do the common drudgery of slaves about the
house; and when he came home again from his cruise,
he ordered me to lie in the cabin to look after the ship.
Here I meditated nothing but my escape, and what
method I might take to effect it, but found no way
that had the least probability in it. Nothing pre-
sented to make the supposition of it rational, tor I
had nobody to communicate it to that would embark
with me, no fellow slave, no Englishman, Irishman,
or Scotchman there, but myself; so that for two
years, though I often pleased myself with the imagi-
nation, yet I never had the least encouraging prospect
of putting it in practice.
After about two years, an odd circumstance pre-
sented itself, which put the old thought of making
some attempt for my liberty again in my head. My
patron lying at home longer than usual, without
fitting out his ship, which as I heard was for want
of money, he used constantly once or twice a week,
sometimes oftener if the weather was fair, to take
the ship's pinnace, and go out into the road a fishing;
and as he always took me and a young Maresco with
him to row the boat, we made him very merry, and
I proved very dexterous in catching fish; inasmuch,
that sometimes he would send me with a Moor, one
of his kinsmen, and the youth the Maresco, as they
called him, to catch a dish of fish for him.
It happened one time, that going a fishing with
him in a calm morning, a fog rose so thick, that
though wewere not half a league from the shore, we
lost sight of it; and, rowing we knew not whither,
or which way, we laboured all day, and all the next
night; and when the morning came, we found we
had pulled off to sea, instead of pulling in for the
shore, and that we were at least two leagues from
the land. However, we got well in again, though
with a great deal of labour and some danger, for the
wind began to blow pretty fresh in the morning:
but particularly we were all very hungry.
But our patron, warned by this disaster, resolved
to take more care of himself for the future; and,
having lying by him the long-boat of our English
ship which he had taken, he resolved he would not
go a fishing any more without a compass, and some
provision: so he ordered the carpenter of his ship,
who was also an English slave, to build a little state
room or cabin in the middle of the long-boat, like
that of a barge, with a place to stand behind it to
steer. and haul home the main sheet; and room be-
fore for a hand or two to stand and work the sails.
She sailed with what we call a shoulder-of-mutton-
sail; and the boom jibbed over the top of the cabin,
which lay very snug and low, and had in it room for
him to lie, with a slave or two, and a table to eat on,
with some small lockers to put in some bottles of such
liquor as he thought fit to drink, particularly his
bread, rice, and coffee.
We were frequently out with this boat a fishing;
and as I was most dexterous to catch fish for him,
he never went without me. It happened one day
that he had appointed to go out in this boat, either
for pleasure or fish, with two or three Moors of some
distinction, and for whom he had provided extraor-
dinarily, and had therefore sent on board the boat
over night a larger store of provisions than usual;
and had ordered me to get ready three fusils with
powder and shot, which were on board his ship1, for
that they designed some sport of fowling as well as
fishing.
I got all things ready as he had directed, and
waited next morning with the boat washed clean, her
ancient and pendants out, and everything to accom-
modate his guests; when, by and by, my patron
came on board alone, and told me his guests had put
off going, upon some business that fell out, and ordered
me with the man and boy, as usual, to go out with
the boat and catch them some fish, for that his friends
were to sup at his house. He commanded me, too,
that as soon as I had got some fish, I should bring it
home to his house. All which I prepared to do.
This moment my former notions of deliverance
darted into my thoughts, for now I found I was like
to have a little ship at my command; and i»y master
being gone, I prepared to furnish myself, not for
fishing business, but for a voyage; though I knew
not, neither did I so much as consider, whither I
would steer, for any where to get out of that place
was my way.
My first contrivance was to make a pretence to
speak to this Moor to get something for our subsist-
ence on board, for I told him we must not presume
to eat our patron's bread. He said, that was true;
so he brought a large basket of rusk or biscuit, of
their kind, and three jars with fresh water, into the
boat. I knew where my patron's case of bottles
stood, which, it was evident by the make, were taken
out of some English prize, and I conveyed them into
the boat, while the Moor was on shore, as if they had
been there before for our master. I conveyed also a
great lump of bees wax into the boat, which weighed
about half a hundred weight, with a parcel of twine
or thread, a hatchet, a saw, and a hammer, all of
which were of great use to us afterward: especially
the wax to make candles. Another trick I tried
upon him, which he innocently came into also. His
name was Ismael, whom they called Muley, or Mo-
ley; so I called to him: "Moley," said I, "our
patron's guns are all on board the boat; can you not
get a little powder and shot? it may be we may kill
some alcomies (a fowl like our curlews) for ourselves,
for I know he keeps the gunner's stores in the ship."
"Yes," says he, "I'll bring some." Accordingly he
brought a great leather pouch, which held about a
pound and a half of powder, or rather more; and
another with shot, that had five or six pounds, with
some bullets, and put all into the boat. At the same
time I had found some powder of my master's in the
great cabin, with which I filled one of the large
bottles in the case, which was almost empty, pouring
what was in it into another, and thus furnished with
every thing needful, we sailed out of the port to fish.
The castle, which is at the entrance of the port, knew
who we were, and took no notice of us; and we were
not above a mile out of the port, before we hauled in
our sail, and sat us down to fish. The wind blew
from the N.N.E., which was contrary to my desire;
for had it blown southerly, I had been sure to have
made the coast of Spain, and at least reached to the
bay of Cadiz; but my resolutions were, blow which
way it would, I would be gone from that horrid place
where I was, and leave the rest to fate.
After we had fished some time, and catched nothing
(for when I had fish on my hook I would not pull
them up, that he might not see them), I said to the
Moor, "This will not do; our master will not be
thus served. We must stand farther off." He,
thinking no harm, agreed; and being in the head of
the boat, set the sails, and, as I had the helm, I run
the boat out near a league farther, and then brought
her to, as if I would fish; when, giving the boy the
helm, I stepped forward to where the Moor was, and
making as it I stooped for something behind him, I
took him by surprise with my arm under his twist,
and tossed him clear overboard into the sea. He
rose immediately, for he swam like a cork, and called
to me, begged to be taken in, told me he would go
all over the world with me. He swam so. strong
after the boat, that he would have reached me very
quickly, there being but little wind; upon which I
stepped into the cabin, and fetching one of the fow-
ling-pieces, I presented it at him, and told him I had
done him no hurt, and, if he would be quiet, I would
do him none. "But," said I, " you swim well enough
to reach the shore, and the sea is calm; make the
best of your way to shore, and I will do you no harm;
but if you come near the boat, I'll shoot you through
the head, for I am resolved to have my liberty." So
he turned himself about, and swam for the shore,
and I make no doubt but he reached it with ease, for
he was an excellent swimmer.
I could have been content to have taken this Moor
with me, and have drowned the boy, but there was
no venturing to trust him. When he was gone, I
turned to the boy, whom they called Xury, and said
to him, " Xury, if you will be faithful to me, 111
make you a great man; but if you will not stroke
your face to be true to me," that is swear by Maho-
met and his father's beard, " I must throw you into the
sea too." The boy smiled in my face, and spoke so in-
nocently, that I could not mistrust him, and swore to
be faithful to me, and go all over the world with me.
While I was in view of the Moor that was swim-
ming, I stood out directly to sea with the boat, rather
stretching to windward, that they might think me
gone towards the Strait's mouth (as indeed any one
that had been in their wits must have been supposed
to do); for who would have thought we were sailed on to
the southward, to the truly Barbarian coast, where
whole nations of Negroes were sure to surround us with
their canoes, and destroy us, where we could never go
once on shore, but we should be devoured by savage
beasts, or more merciless savages of human kind?
But as soon as it grew dusk in the evening I
changed my course, and steered directly south and
by east, bending my course a little towards the
east, that I might keep in with the shore; and,
having a fair fresh gale of wind, and a smooth quiet
sea, I made such sail, that I believe, by the next day
at three o'clock in the afternoon, when I first made
the land, I could not be less than 150 miles south of
Sallee, quite beyond the emperor of Morocco's domi-
nions, or indeed of any other king thereabouts, for
we saw no people.
Yet such was the fright I had taken at the Moors,
and the dreadful apprehensions I had of falling into
their hands, that I would not stop, or go on shore, or
come to an anchor, the wind continuing fair, till I
had sailed in that manner five davs; and then the
wind shifting^ to the southward, I concluded, also,
that if any of our vessels were in chase of me, they
also would now give over; so I ventured to make to
the coast, and came to an anchor in the mouth of a
little river, I knew not what or where, neither what
latitude, what country, what nation, or what river.
I neither saw nor desired to see any people: the
principal thing I wanted was fresh water. We came
into this creek in the evening, resolving to swim on
shore as soon as it was quite dark, we heard such dreadful noises of the barking, roaring, and howling
of wild creatures, of we knew not what kinds, that the
poor boy was ready to die with fear, and begged of
me not to go on shore till day. "Well, Xury," said
I, "then I won't; but it may be we may see men by
day, who will be as bad to us as those lions." '' Then
we may give them the shoot gun," says Xury, laugh-
ing, " make them run away. Such English Xury
spoke by conversing among us slaves. However, I was
glad to see the boy so cheerful, and I gave him a
dram (out of our patron's case of bottles) to cheer
him up. After all, Xury's advice was good, and I
took it. We dropped our little anchor, and lay still
all night; I say still, for we slept none; for in two
or three hours we saw vast great creatures, we knew
not what to call them, of many sorts, come down to
the sea shore, and run into the water, wallowing and
washing themselves for the pleasure of cooling them-
selves; and they made such hideous howlings and
ycllings, that I never indeed heard the like.
Xury was dreadfully frighted, and indeed so was
I too; but we were both worse frighted when we
heard one of the mighty creatures come swimming
towards our boat; we could not see him, but we
might hear him by his blowing to be a monstrous
huge and furious beast. Xury said it was a lion, and
it might be for aught I knew. Poor Xury cried
out to me to weigh the anchor and row away. "No,"
says I, " Xury, we can slip our cable with a buoy to
it, and go to sea; they cannot follow us far." I had
no sooner said so, but I perceived the creature (what-
ever it was) within two oars' length, which something
surprised me: however, I immediately stepped to
the cabin door, and taking up my gun, fired at him,
upon which he immediately turned about, and swam
towards the shore again.
But it was not possible to describe the horrible
noises, and hideous cries and bowlings, that were
raised, as well upon the edge of the shore as higher
within the country, upon ^he noise or report of a
gun, a thing I have some reason to believe those
creatures had never heard before. This convinced
me that there was no going on shore for us in the
night upon that coast, and how to venture on shore
in the day was another question too; for, to have
fallen into the hands of any of the savages, had been
as bad as to have fallen into the paws of lions and
tigers; at least we were equally apprehensive of the
danger of it.
Be that as it would, we were obliged to go on shore
somewhere or other for water, for we had not a pint
in the boat; when or where to get it was the point.
Xury said if I would let him go on shore with one
of the jars, he would find if there was any water, and
bring some to me. I asked him why he would go,
why I should not go, and he stay in the boat. The
boy answered with so much affection, that made me
love him ever after. Says he, "If wild mans come,
they eat me up; you go away." "Well, Xury," said
I, "we will both go; and if the wild mans come, we
will kill them; they shall eat neither of us." So I
gave Xury a piece of rusk-bread to eat, and a dram
out of our patron's case of bottles, which I men-
tioned before, and we hauled the boat in as near the
shore, as we thought'was proper, and waded on shore,
carrying nothing but our arms, and two jars for water.
I did not care to go out of sight of the boat, fearing
the coming of canoes with savages down the river;
but the boy seeing a low place, about a mile up the
country, rambled to it, and by and by I saw him
come running towards me, I thought he was pur-
sued by some savage, or frighted with some wild
beast, and I ran forward towards him to help him;
but when I came nearer to him, I saw something
hanging over his shoulders, which was a creature that
he had shot, like a hare, but different in colour, and
longer legs. However, we were very glad of it, and
it was very good meat; but the great joy that poor
Xury came with, was to tell me he had found good
water, and seen no wild mans.
But we found afterward that we need not take
such pains for water, for a little higher up the creek
where we were, we found the water fresh when the
tide was out, Which flows but a little way up; so we
filled our jars, and feasted on the hare we had killed,
and prepared to go on our way, having seen no foot-
steps of any human creature in that part of the
country.
As I had been one voyage to this coast before I
knew very well that the islands of the Canaries, and
the Cape de Verd islands also, lay not far off from
the coast. But as I had no instruments to take an
observation to know what latitude we were in, and
did not exactly know, or at least, not remember what
latitude they were in, I knew not where to look for
them, or when to stand off to sea towards them,
otherwise I might easily have found some of these
islands. But my hope was, that if I stood along this
coast till I came to that part where the English
traded, I should find some of their vessels upon their
usual design of trade, that would relieve and take
us in.
By the best of my calculation, that place where I
now was, must be that country which, lying between
the Emperor of Morocco's dominions and the Negroes
lies waste and uninhabited, except by wild beasts,
the Negroes having abandoned it, and gone farther
south, for fear of the Moors: and the Moors not
1 hinkinu; it worth inhabiting, by reason of its bar-
renness, and indeed both forsaking it because of the
prodigious numbers of tigers, lions, leopards, and
other furious creatures which harbour there, so that
the Moors use it for their hunting only, where they
go like an army, two or three thousand men at a
time, and, indeed, for near a hundred miles together
upon this coast we saw nothing but a waste, unin-
habited country by day, and heard nothing but how-
ling and roaring of wild beasts by night.
Once or twice in the day time, I thought I saw the
Pico of Teneriffe, being the high top of the mountain
Teneriffe in the Canaries, and had a great mind to
venture put in hopes of reaching thither; but, having
tried twice, I was forced in again by contrary winds, the sea also going too high for my little vessel; so I
resolved to pursue my first design, and keep along
the shore.
Several times we were obliged to land for fresh
water, after we had left this place; and once in par-
ticular, being early in the morning, we came to an
anchor under a little point of water, which was pretty
high, and the tide beginning to flow, we lay still to
go farther in. Xury, whose eyes were more about
him, it seems, than mine were, calls softly to me, and
tells me that we had best go farther on the shore,
'" For," says he, " look, yonder lies a dreadful mon-
ster on the side of that hillock, fast asleep." I looked
where he pointed, and saw a dreadful monster indeed,
for it was a terrible great lion, that lay on the side
of the shore, under the shade of a piece of the hill,
that hung as it were a little over him. "Xury," said
I," you shall go on shore and kill him. Xury looked
frightened, and said, "Me kill'. He eat me at one
mouth!" one mouthful he meant. However, I said
no more to the boy, but bade him be still, and took
our biggest gun, which was almost musket-bore, and
two slugs, and laid it down, then I loaded another
gun with two bullets, and the third (for we had three
pieces) I loaded with five smaller bullets. I took
the best aim I could with the first piece, to have
shot him into the head; but he lav so with his leg
raised a little above his nose, that the slugs hit his leg
c
about the knee, and broke the bone. He started up
growling at first, but finding his leg broke, fell down
again, and then got upon three legs, and gave the
most hideous roar that ever I heard. I was a little
surprised that I had not hit him on the head; how-
ever, I took up the second piece immediately, and,
though he began to move off, fired again, and shot
him into the head, and had the pleasure to see him
drop, and making but little noise, he lay struggling
for life. Then Xury took heart, and would let me
have him go ashore. "Well, go," said I. So the
boy jumped into the water, and taking a little gun in
one hand, swam to shore with the other hand, and
coming close to the creature, put the muzzle of the
piece to his ear, and shot him into the head again,
which despatched him quite.
This was game indeed to us, but this was no food,
and I was very sorry to lose three charges of powder
and shot, upon a creature that was good for nothing
to us. However, Xury said he would have some of
him; so he comes on "board, and asked me to give
him the hatchet. "For what, Xury?" said I. ""Me
cut off his head," said he. However, Xury could not
cut off his head, but he cut off a foot, and brought it
with him, and it was a monstrous great one.
I bethought myself, however, that perhaps the skin
of him might one way or other be of some value to
us, and I resolved to take off his skin if I could. So
Xury and I went to work with him; but Xury was
much the better workman at it, for I knew very ill
how to do it. Indeed it took us up both the whole
day, but at last we got off the hide of him, and
spreading it on the top of our cabin, the sun effectually
dried it in two days' time, and it afterwards served
me to lie upon.
After this stop, we made on to the southward con-
tinually, for ten or twelve days, living very sparingly
on our provisions, which began to abate very much,
and going no oftener into the shore than we were
obliged to for fresh water. My design in this was to
make the river Gambia or Senegal, that is to say,
any where about the Cape de Verd, where I was m
hopes to meet with some European ship; and if I did
not, I knew not what course to take, but to seek for
the islands, or perish there among the Negroes. I
knew that all the ships from Europe, which sailed
either to the coast of Guinea, or to Brazil, or to the
East Indies, made this cape or those islands, and, in
a word, I put the whole of my fortune upon this
single point, either that I must meet with some ship
or perish.
When I had pursued this resolution about ten days
longer, as I have said, I began to see that the land
was inhabited, and in two or three places, as we sailed
by, we saw people stand upon the shore to look at
us; we could also perceive they were quite black,
and stark naked. I was once inclined to have gone
on shore to them, but Xury was my better counsellor,
and said to me, " No go, no go." However, I hauled
in nearer the shore, that I might talk to them, and
I found they ran along the shore by me a good way.
I observed they had no weapons in their hands, ex-
cept one, who had a long slender stick, which Xury
said was a lance, and that they would throw them a
great way with good aim; so I kept at a distance,
but talked with them by signs for something to eat.
They beckoned to me to stop my boat, and they
would fetch me some meat. Upon this I lowered
the top of my sail, and lay by, and two of them ran
up into the country, and in less than half an hour
came back, and brought with them two pieces* of dry
flesh and some corn, such as is the produce of their
country, but we neither knew what the one or the
other was; however, we were willing to accept it.
But how to come at it was our next dispute, for I was
not for venturing on shore to them, and they were as
much afraid of us, but they took a safe way for us
all, for they brought it to the shore, and laid it down,
c 2
36 ROBINSON CRUSOE. and went and stood a great way off, till we fetched
it on board, and then came close to us again.
We made signs to thank them, for we had nothing
to make them amends; but an opportunity offered
that instant to oblige them wonderfully; for while
we were lying by the shore, came two mighty crea-
tures, one pursuing the other (as we took it) with
great fury, from the mountains towards the sea;
whether it was the male pursuing the female, or
whether they were in sport or in rage, we could not
tell any more than we could tell whether it was
usual or strange, but I believe it was the latter, be-
cause, in the first place, those ravenous creatures
seldom appear but in the night, and, in the second
place, we found the people terribly frighted, especially
the women. The man that had the lance or dart did
not fly from them, but the rest did. However, as
the two creatures ran directly into the water, they
did not seem to offer to fall upon the Negroes, but
plunged themselves into the sea, and swam about as
if they had come for their diversion; and at last one
of them began to come nearer our boat than at first
I expected; but I lay ready for him, for I had loaded
my gun with all possible expedition, and bade Xury
load both the others. As soon as he came fairly
within my reach, I fired, and shot him directly
through the head. Immediately he sunk down into
the water, but he rose instantly, and plunged up and
down as if he was struggling for life, and so indeed
he was. He immediately made to the shore, l>uI.
between the wound, which was his mortal hurt, ana*
the strangling of the water, he died just before he
reached the shore. It is impossible to express the astonishment of
these poor creatures, at the noise and fire of my gun:
some of them were ready even to die of fear, and fell
down as dead with the very terror. But when the?
saw the creature dead, and sunk into the water, mid
that I made signs for them to come to the shore, they
took heart and came to the shore, and began to
search for the creature. I found him by his blood
staining the water, and by the help of a rope, which
I flung round him, and gave the Negroes to haul,
they dragged him on shore, and found it was a most
curious leopard, spotted and fine to an admirable
degree; and the Negroes held up their hands with
admiration, to think what it was I killed him with.
The other creature, frighted with the flash of fire,
and the noise of the gun, swam to the shore, and ran
up directly to the mountains from whence they came,
nor could I at that distance know what it was. I
found quickly the Negroes were for eating the flesh
of this creature, so I was willing to have them take
it as a favour from me, which, when I made signs to
them that they might take him, they were very
thankful for. Immediately they fell to work with
him, and though they had no knife, yet with a sharp-
ened piece of wood they took off his skin as readily,
nay, much more readily, than we could have done
with a knife. They offered me some of the flesh,
which I declined, making as if I would give it them,
but made signs for the skin, which they gave me
very freely, and brought me a great deal more of
their provision, which though I did not understand,
yet I accepted. Then I made signs to them for some
water, and held out one of my jars to them, turning
its bottom upward, to show that it was empty, and
that I wanted to have it filled. They called imme-
diately to some of their friends, and there came two
women, and brought a great vessel made out of
earth, and burnt, as I suppose, in the sun: this they
set down for me, as before, and I sent Xury on shore
with my jars, and filled them all three. The women
were as stark naked as the men.
I was now furnished with roots and corn, such as
it was, and water; and, leaving my friendly Negroes,
made forward for about eleven days more, without
pfefing to go near the shore, till I saw the land run
38 ROBINSON CRUSOE. out a great length into', the sea, at about the distance
of four or five leagues before me, and, the sea being
very calm, I kept a large offing to make this point;
at length, doubling the point at about two leagues
from the land, I saw plainly land on the other side
to seaward; then I concluded, as it was most certain
indeed, that this was the Cape de Verd, and those
islands, called from thence Cape de Verd islands.
However, they were at a great distance, and I could
not well tell what I had best to do; for if I should
be taken with a fresh wind, I might' neither reach
one nor other.
In this dilemma, as I was very pensive, I stepped
into the cabin, and sat me down, Xury having the
helm, when on a sudden the boy cried oat, " Master,
master, a ship was a sail!" and the foolish boy was
frighted out of his wits, thinking it must needs be
some of his master's ships sent to pursue us, when I
knew we were gotten far enough out of their reach.
I jumped out of the cabin, and immediately saw not
only the ship, but what she was, viz. that she was a
Portuguese ship, and, as I thought, was bound to
the coast of Guinea for Negroes. But when I ob-
served the course she steered, I was soon convinced
they were bound some other way, and did not design
to go any nearer to the shore, upon which I stretched
out to sea as much as I could, resolving to speak
with them if possible.
With all the sail I could make, I found I should
not be able to come in their way, but that they would
be gone by before I could make any signal to them;
but after I had crowded to the utmost, and began to
despair, they, it seems, saw me by the help of their
perspective glasses, and that it was some European
boat, which they supposed must belong to some ship
that was lost; so they shortened sail to let me come
up. I was encouraged with this, and as I had my
patron's ancient on board, I made a waft of it to them
as a signal of distress, and fired a gun, both of which they f&vr, for they told me they saw the smoke,
though they did not hear the gun. Upon these sig-
nals they very kindly brought to, and lay by for me,
and in about three hours time I came up with them.
They asked me what I was, in Portuguese, and in
Spanish, and in French, but I understood none ot
them; but at last a Scots sailor, who was on board,
called to me, and I answered him, and told him I
was an Englishman, that I had made my escape out
of slavery from the Moors at Sallee. Then they bade
me come on board, and very kindly took me in, and
all my goods.
It was an inexpressible joy to me, that any one
will believe, that I was thus delivered, as I esteemed
it, from such a miserable and almost hopeless condi-
tion as I was in. I immediately offered all I had to
the captain of the ship, as a return for my deliver-
ance; but he generously told me, he would take
nothing from me, but that all I had should be deli-
vered safe to me when I came to the Brazils. "For,"
says he, " I have saved your life on no other terms
than as I would be glad to be saved myself; and it
may one time or other be my lot to be taken up in
the same condition. Besides," says he, " when I
carry you to the Brazils, so great a way from your own country, if I should take from you what little
thither in charity,and these things will help you to buy
your subsistence there, and your passage home again."
As he was charitable in' this proposal, so he was
just in the performance to a tittle; for he ordered the
seamen that none should offer to touch any thing I
had: then he took every thing into his own possession, and gave me back an exact inventory of them, that
I might have them again, even so much as my three
earthen jars.
As to my boat it was a very good one. and that he
saw, and told me he would buy it of me for the ship's
use, and asked me what I would have for it. I told
him he had been so generous to me in every thing,
that I could not offer to make any price of the boat,
but left it entirely to him; upon which he told me he
would give me a note of hand to pay me 80 pieces of
eight for it in Brazil, and when it came there, if any
one offered to give more, he would make it up. He
offered me also 60 pieces of eight for my boy, Xury,
which I was loath to take; not that I was not willing
to let the captain have him, but I was very loath to
sell the poor boy's liberty, who had assisted me so
faithfully in procuring my own. However, when I
let him know my reason, he owned it to be just, and
offered me this medium, that he would give the boy
an obligation to set him free in ten years, if he turned
Christian. Upon this, Xury, saying he was willing
to go to him, I let the captain have him.
We had a very good voyage to the Brazils, and
arrived in the Bay de todos los Santos, or All Saints
Bay, in about twenty-four days after. And now I
was once more delivered from the most miserable of
all conditions of life, and what to do next with my-
self, I was to consider.
The generous treatment the captain gave me I can
never enough remember; he would take nothing of
me for my passage, gave me 20 ducats for the leopard's
skin, and 40 for the lion's skin, which I had in the
boat, and caused every thing I had in the ship to be
punctually delivered to me; and what I was willing
to sell, he bought, such as the case of bottles, two of
my guns, and a piece of the lump of bees wax, for I
had made candles of the rest; in a word, I made
about 220 pieces of eight of all my cargo, and with
this stock I went on shore in the Brazils.
I had not been long here, but being recommended
to the house of a good honest man like himself, who
had an ingenio, as they call it, that is, a plantation
and a sugar-house, I lived with him some time, and
acquainted myself by that means with the manner of
their planting and making of sugar; and seeing how
well the planters lived, and how they grew rich sud-
denly, I resolved, if I could get license to settle there,
I would turn planter among them; resolving, in the
mean time, to find out some way to get my money
which I had left in London remitted to me. To this
purpose, getting a kind of letter of naturalization, I
purchased as much land that was uncured as my
money would reach, and formed a plan for my plan-
tation and settlement, and such a one as might be
suitable to the stock which I proposed to myself to
receive from England.
I Lead a neighbour, a Portuguese of Lisbon, but
born of English parents, whose name was Wells, and
in much such circumstances as I was. I call him
neighbour, because his plantation lay next to mine,
ana we went on sociably together; my stock was but
1 low as well as his, and we rather planted for food
than any thing else for about two years. However,
we began to increase, and our land began to come
into order, so that the third year we planted some
tobacco, and made each of us a large piece of ground
ready for planting canes in the year to come, but we
both wanted help; and now I found, more than
before, I had done wrong in parting with my boy,
Xury.
But, alas! for me to do wrong that never did right,
was no great wonder. I had no remedy but to go
on. I was gotten into an employment quite remote
to my genius, and directly contrary to the life I de-
lighted'in, and for which I forsook my father's house,
and broke through all his good advice; nay, I was
coming into the very middle station, or upper degree
of low life, which my father advised me to before,
and which, if I resolved to go on with, I might as
well have staid at home, and never fatigued myself
in the world, as I have done; and I used often to say
to myself, I could have done this as well in England
among my friends, as have gone five thousand miles
off to do it among strangers and savages in the wil-
derness, and at such a distance as never to hear from
any part of the world that had any knowledge of me.
In this manner I used to look upon my condition
with the utmost regret. I had nobody to converse
with, but now and then this neighbor ; no work to
be done but by the labour of my hands; and I used
to say, I lived just like a man cast away upon a doselate island, that had nobody there but himself. But
how just hag it been, and how should all men reflect,
that when they compare their present conditions with
others that are worse, Heaven may oblige them to
make the exchange, and be convinced of their former
felicity, by their experience! I say, how just has it
been, that the truly solitary life I reflected on in an
island of mere desolation should be my lot, who had
so often unjustly compared it with the life I then
led, in which, had I continued, I had, in all proba-
bility, been exceedingly prosperous and rich.
I was in some degree settled in my measures for
carrying on the plantation before my kind friend,
the captain of the ship that took me up at sea, went
back, for the ship remained there in providing her
loading, and preparing for her voyage, near three
months -j when, telling him what little stock I had
left behind me in London, he gave me this friendly
and sincere advice : "Signor Inglese," says he (for
so he always called me), "if you will give me letters,
and a procuration here in form to me, with orders to
the person who has your money in London, to send
your effects to Lisbon, to such persons as I shall
direct, and in such goods as are proper in this country,
I will bring you the produce, God willing, at my
return; but, since human affairs are all subject to
changes and disasters, I would have you give orders
for 100?. sterling, which you say is half your stock,
and let the hazard be run for the first, so that if it
come safe, you may order the rest the same way, and
if it miscarry, you may have the other half to hare
recourse to for your supply.
This was such wholesome advice, and looked so
friendly, that I could not but be convinced it was the
best course I could take; so I accordingly prepared
letters to the gentlewoman with whom I had left my
money, and a procuration to the Portuguese captain,
as he desired.
I wrote the English captain's widow a full account
of all my adventures, my slavery, escape, and how I
had met with the Portugal captain at sea, the hu-
manity of his behaviour, and what condition I was
now in, with all other necessary directions for my
supply; and when this honest captain came to Lisbon,
he found means, by some of the English merchants
there, to send over not the order only, but a full ac-
count of my story, to a merchant at London, who
presented it effectually to her; whereupon she not
only delivered the money, but out of her own pocket
sent the Portugal captain a very handsome present
for his humanity and charity to me.
The merchant in London vested this 100?. in
English goods, such as the captain had written for, and
sent them directly to him at Lisbon, and he brought
them safe to me to the Brazils; among which,
without my direction (for I was too young in my busi-
ness to think of them), he had taken care to have all
sorts of tools, iron-work, and utensils necessary for
my plantation, and which were of great use to me.
When this cargo arrived I thought my fortune
made, for I was surprised with the joy of it; and my
good steward, the captain, had laid out the 51. which
my friend had sent him for a present for himself, to
purchase, and bring me over a servant, under a bond
for six years service, and would not accept of any
consideration, except a little tobacco, which I would
have him accept, being of my own produce.
Neither was this all; but my goods being all
English manufactures, such as cloth, stuffs, baize, and
things particularly valuable and desirable in the
country, I found means to sell them to a very great
advantage; so that I may say, I had more than four
times the value of my first cargo, and was now in-
finitely beyond my poor neighbour, I mean in the
advancement of my plantation; for the first thing I
did, I bought me a negro slave and a European ser-
vant also; I mean another besides that which the
captain brought me from Lisbon.
But as abused prosperity is oftentimes made the
very means of our greatest adversity, so was it with
me. I went on the next year with great success in
my plantation; I raised fifty great rolls of tobacco
on my own ground, more than I had disposed of for
necessaries among my neighbours, and these fifty
rolls being each of above lOOlb. weight, were well
cured and laid by against the return of the fleet from
Lisbon. And now increasing in business and wealth,
my head began to be full of projects and under-
takings beyond my reach, such as are, indeed often
the ruin of the best heads in business.
Had I continued in the station I was now in, I had
room for all the happy things to have yet befallen
me, for which my father so earnestly recommended
a quite retired life, and which he had so sensibly
described the middle station of life to be full of; but
other things attended me, and I was still to be the
wilful agent of all my own miseries; and particularly
to increase my fault, and double the reflections upon
myself, which in my future sorrows I should have
leisure to make, all these miscarriages were procured
by my apparent obstinate adhering to my foolish in-
clinatiou of wandering abroad, and pursuing that
inclination in contradiction to the clearest views of
doing myself good in a fair and plain pursuit of those
prospects and those measures of life, which nature
and Providence concurred to present me with, and
to make my duty.
As I had once done thus in breaking away from
my parents, so I could not be content now; but I
must go and leave the happy view I had of being a
rich and thriving man in my new plantation, only to
pursue a rash and immoderate desire of raising faster
than the nature of the thing admitted; and thus I
cast myself down again into the deepest gulf of
human misery that any man fell into,or,perhaps, could
be consistent with life, and a state of health in the
world.
To come, then, by just degrees to the particulars
of this part of my story; you may suppose that
having now lived almost four years in the Brazils,
and beginning to thrive and prosper very well upon
my plantation, I had not only learned the language,
but had contracted acquaintance and friendship among
my fellow-planters, as well as among the merchants
of St. Salvador, which was our port, and that, in
my discourses among them, I had frequently given
them an account of my two voyages to the coast of
Guinea, the manner of trading with the negroes
there, and how easy it was to purchase upon the
coast, for trifles, such as beads, toys, knives, scissors,
hatchets, bits of glass, and the like, not only gold-
dust, Guinea grains, elephants' teeth, &c, but negroes
for the service of the Brazils in great numbers.
They listened always very attentively to my dis-
courses on these heads, but especially to that part
which related to the buying of negroes, which was a
trade at that time not only not far entered into, but, as
far as it was, had been carried on by the assientos, or'
permission of the kings of Spain and Portugal, and
engrossed in the public stock, so that few negroes
were bought, and those excessive dear.
It happened, being in company one day with some
merchants, and planters of my acquaintance, and
talking of those things very earnestly, three of them
came to me the next morning, and told me they had
been musing very much upon what I had discoursed
of with them the last night, and they came to make
a secret appeal to me, and, after enjoining my secrecy, they told me they had a mind to' fit out a ship to
Guinea ; that they had all plantations as well as I,
and were straitened for nothing so much as servants;
that as it was a trade that could not be carried on,
because they could not publicly sell the negroes when
they came home, so they desired to make but one
voyage, to bring the negroes on shore privately, and
divide them among their own plantations; and, in a
word, the question was, whether I would go their
supercargo in the ship, to manage the trading part
upon the coast of Guinea; and they offered me that
I should have an equal share of the Negroes, without
providing any part of the stock.
This was a fair proposal, it must be confessed, had
it been made to any one that had not had a settle-
ment and plantation of his own to look after, which
was in a fair way of coming to be very considerable,
and with a good stock upon~it. But for me that was
thus established, and had nothing to do but go on as
I had begun for three or four years more, and to have
sent for the other 1007. from England, and who, in
that time, and with that little addition, could scarce
have failed of being worth 3 or 40007. sterling, and
that increasing too; for me to think of such a voyage
was the most preposterous thing that ever man, in
such circumstances, could be guilty of.
But I, that was born to be my own destroyer, could
no more resist the offer, than I could refrain my first
rambling designs, when my father's good counsel
was lost upon me. In a word, I told them I would
go with all my heart, if they would undertake to
look after my plantation in my absence, and would
dispose of it to such as I should direct, if I miscar-
ried. This they all engaged to do; and I made a
formal will, disposing of my plantation and effect, in case of my death, making the captain of the ship
that had saved my life, as before, my universal heir,
but obliging him to dispose of my effects as I had
directed in my will; one half of the produce being
to himself, and the other to be shipped to
England!
In short, I took all possible caution to preserve my
effects, and keep up my plantation. Had I used half
as much prudence to have looked into my own in-
terest, and have made a judgment of what I ought
to have done, I had certainly never gone away from
so prosperous an undertaking, leaving all the pro-
bable views of a thriving circumstance, and gone
'upon a voyage to sea, attended with all its common
hazards, to say nothing of the reasons I had to ex-
pect particular misfortunes to myself.
But I was hurried on, and obeyed blindly the dietates of my fancy, rather than" my reason; and,
accordingly, the ship being fitted out, and the cargo
furnished, and all things done as by agreement by
my partners in the voyage, I went on board in an
evil hour again, the 1st of September, 1659, being the
same day eight years that I went from my father
and mother at Hull, in order to act the rebel to their
authority and the fool to my own interest.
Our ship was about 120 tons burden, carried six
guns, and fourteen men, besides the master, his boy.
and myself. We had on board no large cargo of
goods, except such toys as were fit for our trade with
the Negroes; such as beads, bits of glass, shells, and
odd trifles, especially little looking glasses, knives,
scissors, hatchets, and the like.
The same day I went on board, we set sail, stand-
ing away to the northward upon our own coast, with
design to stretch over for the African coast, when
they came into about ten or twelve degrees of nor-
thern latitude, which, it seems, was the manner of
their course in those days. We had very good wea-
ther, only excessive hot all the way upon our own
coast, till we came to the height of Cape St. Augiis-
tino, from whence keeping farther off at sea, we lost
sight of land, and steered as if we were bound for
the Isle of Fernand de Norouba, holding our course
N. E. by N. and leaving those isles on the east. In
this course we passed the line in about twelve days'
time, and were, by our last observation, in 7 degrees,
22 minutes, northern latitude, when a violent tornado
or hurricane took us quite out of our knowledge; it
began from the south-east, came about to the north-
west, and then settled into the north-east, from
whence it blew in such a terrible manner, that for
twelve days together we could do nothing but drive;
and scudding away before it, let it carry us wherever
fate and the fury of the winds directed; and during
these twelve days, I need not say that I expected
every day to be swallowed up, nor did any in the
ship expect to save their lives.
In this distress we had, besides the terror of the
storm, one of our men died of the calenture, and one
man and the boy washed overboard. About the
twelfth day, the weather abating a little, the master
made an observation as well as he could, and found
that he was in about 11 degrees of north latitude,
but that he was 22 degrees of longitude difference
west from Cape St. Augustino, so that he found he
was got upon the coast of Guinea, or the north part
of Brazil, beyond the river Amazones, towards that
of the river Oroonoque, commonly called the Great
River; and now he began to consult with me what
course he should take, for the ship was leaky, and
very much disabled, and he was for going directly
back to the coast of Brazil.
I was positively against that; and, looking over
the charts of the sea-coast of America with him, we
concluded there was no inhabited country for us to
have recourse to, till we came within the circle of
the Caribbee Islands, and therefore resolved to stand
away for Barbadoes, which by keeping off at sea, to
avoid the indraught of the Bay or Gulf of Mexico,
we might easily perform, as we hoped, in about fifteen
days sail; whereas we could not possibly make our
voyage to the coast of Africa, without some assist-
ance both to our ship and ourselves.
With this design we changed our course, and
steered away N. \V. by W. in order to reach some of
our English islands, where I hoped for relief; but
our voyage was otherwise determined ; for, being in
the latitude of 12 degrees 18 minutes, a second storm
came upon us, which carried us away with the same
impetuosity westward, and drove us so out of the
very way of all human commerce, that had our lives
been saved, as to the sea, we were rather in danger
of being devoured by savages, than ever returning to
our own country.
In this distress, the wind still blowing very hard,
one of our men, early one morning, cried out," Land!"
and we had no sooner run out of the cabin to look
out, in hopes of seeing whereabouts in the world we
were, but the ship struck upon a sand, and, in a mo-
ment, her motion being so stopped, the sea broke
over her in such a manner that we expected we
should all have perished immediately; and we were
even driven to close quarters, to shelter us from the
very foam and spray of the sea.
It is not easy for any one, who has not been in the
like condition, to describe or conceive the consterna-
tion of menin such circumstances. Weknew nothing
where we were, or upon what land it was we were
driven, whether an island or the main, whether in-
habited or not inhabited ; and as the rage of the wind
was still great, though rather less than at first, we
could not so much as hope to have the ship hold many
minutes without breaking in pieces, unless the wind,
by a kind of miracle, should turn immediately again
In a word, we sat looking upon one another, and ex-
pecting death every moment, and every man acting
accordingly, as preparing for another world, for there
was little or nothing more for us to do in this; that
which was our present comfort, and all the comfort
we had, was, that contrary to our expectation the
D
ship did not break yet, and that the master said the
wind began to abate.
Now, though we thought that the wind did a little
abate, yet the ship having thus struck upon the sand,
and sticking too fast to expect her getting off, we
were in a dreadful condition indeed, and had nothing
to do but to think of saving our lives as well as we
could. We had a boat at our stern just before the
storm, but she was first staved by dashing against
the ship's rudder, and in the next place she broke
away, and either sunk or was driven off to sea, so
there was no hope from her. We had another boat
on board, but how to get her off into the sea, was a
doubtful thing. However, there was no room for
debate, for we fancied the ship would break in pieces
every^minute; and some said she had broken already.
In this distress, the mate of our vessel lays hold of
the boat, and with the help of the rest of the men,
they got her flung over the ship's side, and getting
all into her, let go, and committed ourselves, being
eleven in number, to God's mercy, and the wild sea;
for though the storm was abated considerably, yet
the sea went dreadfully high upon the shore, and
might well be called "Den mid zee," as the Dutch
call the sea in a storm.
And now our case was very dismal indeed, for we
all saw plainly that the sea went so high, that the
boat could not escape, and that we should be inevi-
tably drowned. As to making sail, we had none;
nor, if we had, could we have done any thing with
it; so we worked at the oar towards the land, though
with heavy hearts, like men going to execution; for we all knew, that when the boat came near the shore,
she would be dashed in a thousand pieces by the
breach of the sea. However, we committed our souls
to God in the most earnest manner, and the wind
driving us towards the shore, we hastened our de-
struction with our own hands, pulling, as well as we
could, towards land.
What the shore was, whether rock or sand, whether
steep or shoal, we knew not; the only hope that
could rationally give us the least shadow of expecta-
tion, was, if we might get into some bay or gulf, or
the mouth of some river, where, by great chance, we
might have run our boat in, or got under the lee of
the land, and perhaps made smooth water. But
there was nothing of this appeared; but as we made
nearer and nearer the shore, the land looked more
frightful than the sea.
After we had rowed, or rather driven, about a
league and a half, as we reckoned it, a raging wave,
mountain-like, came rolling astern of us, and plainly
bade us expect the "coup de grace." In a word, it
took us with such a fury, that it overset the boat at
once, and separating us as well from the boat as
from one another, gave us not time hardly to say,
"OGod!" for we were all swallowed up in a moment.
Nothing can describe the confusion of thought
which I felt when I sunk into the water, for though
I swam very well, yet I could not deliver myself
from the waves so as to draw my breath, till that
wave had driven me or rather carried me, a vast way
on towards the shore, and having spent itself, went
back, and left me upon the land almost dry, but half
dead with the water I took in. I had so much pre-
sence of mind, as well as breath left, that seeing my-
self nearer the main land than I expected, I got upon
my feet, and endeavoured to make on towards the
land, as fast as I could, before another wave should
return and take me up again. But I soon found it
was impossible to avoid it, for I saw the sea come
after me as high as a great hill, and as furious as an
enemy, which I had no means or strength to contend
with - my business was to hold my breath, and raise
myself upon the water, if I could, and so by swimming
to preserve my breathing, and pilot myself towards
the shore, if possible; my greatest concern now being
that the wave, as it would carry me a great way to-
D 2
wards the shore when it came on, might not carry me
back again with it, when it gave back towards the sea.
The wave that came upon me again buried me at
once twenty or thirty feet deep in its own body, and
I could feel myself carried with a mighty force and
swiftness towards the shore a very great way; but
I held my breath, and assisted myself to swim still
forward with all my might. I was ready to burst
with holding my breath, when, as I felt myself rising
up, so, to my immediate relief. I found my head and
hands shoot out above the surface of the water; and
though it was not two seconds of time that I could
keep myself so, yet it relieved me greatly, gave me
breath and new courage. I was covered again with
water a good while, but not so long but I held it out,
and finding the water had spent itself, and began to
return, I struck forward against the return of the
waves, and felt ground again with my feet. I stood
still a few moments to recover breath, and till the
water went from me, and then I took to my heels,
and ran with what strength I had farther towards
the shore. But neither would this deliver me from
the fury of the sea, which came pouring in after me
again, and twice more was I lifted up by the waves and carried forwards as before, the shore being very
flat.
The last time of these two had well near been fatal
to me; for the sea having hurried me along as before,
landed me, or rather dashed me, against a piece of rock, and that with such force, as it left me senseless,
and indeed helpless, as to my own deliverance; for
the blow taking my side and breast, beat the breath,
as it were quite out of my body, and had it returned
again immediately, I must have been strangled in
the water; but I recovered a little befor the return
of the waves, and seeing I should be covered again
with the water, I resolved to hold fast by a piece of
the rock, and so to hold my breath, if possible, till
the wave went back. Now, as the waves were not
so high as at first, being near land, I held my hold till
the wave abated, and then fetched another run, which
brought me so near the shore, that the next wave,
though it went over me, yet did not so swallow me
up as to carry me away; and the next run I took I
got to the main land, where, to my great comfort, I
clambered up the cliffs of the shore, and sat me down
upon the grass, free from danger, and quite out of
the reach of the water.
I was now landed, and safe on shore, and began to
look up and thank God that my life was saved, in a
case wherein there was some minutes before scarce
any room to hope. I believe it is impossible to ex-
press to the life what the ecstacies and transports of
the soul are when it is so saved, as I may say, out of
the very grave: and I do not wonder now at that
custom, viz. when a malefactor, who has the halter
about his neck, is tied up, and just going to be turned
off, and has a reprieve brought to him; I say, I do
not wonder that they bring a surgeon with it, to let
him blood that very moment they tell him of it, that
the surprise may not drive the animal spirits from
the heart, and overwhelm him:—
"For sudden joys, like griefs, confound at first." I walked about on the shore, lifting up my hands,
and my whole being, as I may say, wrapt up in the
contemplation of my deliverance, making a thousand
gestures and motions which I cannot describe, reflect 'ing upon all my comrades that were drowned, and
that there should not be one soul saved but myself;
for, as for them, I never saw them afterward, or any
sign of them, except three of their hats, one cap, and
two shoes that were not fellows.
I cast my eyes to the stranded vessel, when the
breach and froth of the sea being so big, I could hardly
see it, it lay so far off; and considered, Lord! how
was it possible I crtuld get shore!
After I had solaced my mind with the comfortable
part of my condition, I began to look round me, to
see what kind of place I was in, and what was next
to be done, and I soon found my comforts abate, and
that, in a word, I had a dreadful deliverance; for I
was wet, had no clothes to shift me, nor any thing
either to eat or drink to comfort me, neither did I see
any prospect before me but that of perishing with
hunger, or being devoured by wild beasts: and that
which was particularly afflicting to me was, that I
had no weapon either to hunt and kill any creature
for my sustenance, or to defend myself against any
other creature that might desire to kill me for theirs.
In a word, I had nothing about me but a knife, a
tobacco-pipe, and a little tobacco in a box: this
was all my provision, and this threw me into terrible
agonies of mind. that for a while I ran about like a
madman. Night coming upon me, I began with a
heavy heart, to consider what would be my lot, if
there were any ravenous beasts in that country, see-
ing at night they always come abroad for their prey.
All the remedy that offered to my thoughts at that
time was, to get up into a thick bushy tree, like a
fir, but thorny, which grew near me, and where I re-
solved to sit all night, and consider the next day what
death, I should die; for, as yet I saw no prospect of
life. I walked about a furlong from the shore, to see
if I could find any fresh water to drink, which I did
to my great joy; and having drank, and put a little
tobacco in my mouth to prevent hunger, I went to
the tree, and getting up into it, endeavoured to place
myself so as that, if I should sleep, I might not fall;
and having cut me a short stick, like a truncheon,
for my defence, I took up my lodging; and having
been excessively fatigued, I fell fast asleep, and slept
as comfortably as, I believe few could have done in my condition, and found myself the most refreshed
with it that I think I ever was on such an occasion.
When I waked it was broad day, the weather clear,
and the storm abated, so that the sea did not rage and swell as before; but that which surprised me
most was, that the ship was lifted off In the night,
from the sand where she lay, by the swelling of the
tide, and was driven up almost as far as the rock
which I first mentioned, where I had been so bruised
by dashing me against it. This being within about a
mile from the shore where I was, and the ship
seeming to stand upright still, I wished myself on
board, that at least I might save some necessary
things for my use.
When I came down from my apartment in the tree,
I looked about me again; and the first thing I found
was the boat, which lay as the wind and sea had
tossed her upon the land, about two miles on my
right hand. I walked as far as I could upon the
shore to have got to her, but found a neck or inlet of
water between me and the boat, which was about
half a mile broad; so I came back for the present,
being more intent upon getting at the ship, where I
hoped to find something for my present subsistence.
A little after noon I found the sea very calm; and
the tide ebbed so far out, that I could come within a
quarter of a mile of the ship; and here I found a
fresh renewing of my grief; for I saw evidently that
if we had kept on board we had been all safe, that
is to say, we had all got safe on shore, and I had not
been so miserable as to be left entirely destitute of
all comfort and company, as I now was. This forced
tears from my eyes again; but as there was little
relief in that, I resolved, if possible, to get to the
ship; so I pulled off my clothes, for the weather was
hot to extremity, and took the water; but, when I
came to the ship, my difficulty was still greater to
know how to get on board, for as she lay aground,
and high out of the water, there was nothing within
my reach to lay hold of. I swam round her twice,
and the second time I espied a small piece of rope,
which I wondered I did not see at first, hang down
by the fore chains, so low as that with great difficulty
I got hold of it, and, by the help of that rope, got
up into the forecastle of the ship. Here I found that
the ship was bulged, and had a great deal of water
in her hold, but that she lay so on the side of a bank
of hard sand, or rather earth, that her stern lay
lifted up upon the bank, and her head low almost to
the water; by this means all her quarter was free,
and all that was in that part was dry; for you may
be sure my first work was to search and to see what
was spoiled, and what was free: and first I found
that all the ship's provisions were dry and untouched
by the water: and being very well disposed to eat,
I went to the bread-room, and filled my pockets with
biscuit, and eat it as I went about other things, for I
had no time to lose. I also found some rum in the
great cabin, of which I took a large dram, and which
I had indeed need enough of, to spirit me for what
was before me. Now I wanted nothing but a boat
to furnish myself with many things which I foresaw
would be very necessary to me.
It was in vain to sit still, and wish for what was
not to be had; and this extremity roused my appli-
cation. We had several spare yards, and two or
three large spars of wood, and a spare top-mast or
two in the ship; I resolved to fall to work with these,
and flung as many of them overboard as I could
manage for their weight, tying every one with a rope
that they might not drive away. " When this was
done, I went down the ship's side, and pulling them
to me, I tied four of them fast together at both ends
as well as I could, in the form of a raft; and laying
two or three short pieces of plank upon them cross-
ways, I found that I could walk upon them very
well, but that it was not able to bear any great
weight, the pieces being too light: so I went to work,
and with a carpenter's saw I cut a spare topmast into three lengths, and added them to my raft, with
great labour; but the hope of furnishing myself
with necessaries encouraged me more than I should
have been able to have done upon another occasion.
My raft was now strong enough to bear any rea-
sonable weight. My next care was what to load it
with, and how to preserve what I laid upon it from
the surf of the sea: but I was not long considering
this; I first laid all the planks or boards upon it that
I could get, and having considered well what I most
wanted, I first got three of the seamen's chests,
which I had broken open and emptied, and lowered
them down upon my raft. The first of these I filled
with provisions, viz. bread, rice, three Dutch cheeses,
pieces of dried goat's flesh, which we lived much upon,
and a little remainder of European corn, which had
been laid by some fowls which we brought to sea
with us, but the fowls were killed. There had been
some barley and wheat together, but, to my great
disappointment, I found afterwards that the rats had
eaten or spoiled it all. As for liquors, I found several
cases of bottles belonging to our skipper, in which
were some cordial waters, and in all about five or six
gallons of rack : these I stowed by themselves,
. there being no need to put them into the chest, nor
any room for them. While I was doing this, I found
the tide began to flow, though very calm, and I had
the mortification to see my coat, shirt, and waistcoat,
which I had left on shore upon the sand, swim
away; as for my breeches, which were only linen,
and open-knee'd, I swam on board in them and my
stockings. However, this put me upon rummaging for
clothes, of which I found enough, but took no more
than I wanted for present use, for I had other things
which my eye was more upon: as first, tools to work
with on shore, and it was after long searching that
I found out the carpenter's chest, which was indeed
a very useful prize to me, and much more valuable
than a ship-loading of gold would have been at that
time. I got it down to my raft, even whole as it was, without losing time to look into it, for I knew in
general what it contained.
My next care was for some ammunition and arms.
There were two very good fowling pieces in the great
cabin, and two pistols; these I secured first, with
some powder-horns, a small bag of shot, and two old
rusty swords. I knew there were three barrels of
powder in the ship, but knew not where our gunner
had stowed them, but with much search I found them,
'two of them dry and good, the third had taken water;
those two I got to my raft, with the arms. And now
I thought myself pretty well freighted, and began to
think how I should get to shore with them, having
neither sail, oar, or rudder, and the least capful of
wind would have overset all my navigation.
I had three encouragements; first, a smooth and
calm sea; secondly, the tide rising and settling in to
the shore; thirdly, what little wind there was blew
me towards the land. And thus, having found two
or three broken oars belonging to the boat, and be-
sides the tools which were in the chest, I found two
saws, an axe, and a hammer, and with this cargo I
put to sea. For a mile or thereabouts my raft went
very well, only that I found it drive a little distant
from the place where I had landed before, by which
I perceived there was some indraught of the water,
and consequently I hoped to find some creek or river
there, which I might make use of as a port to get to
land with my cargo.
As I imagined, so it was; there appeared before
me a little opening of the land. I found a strong
current of the tide set into it, so I guided my raft as
well as I could, to keep in the middle of the stream.
But here I had like to have suffered a second ship-
wreck, which, if I had, I think verily would have
broken my heart; for, knowing nothing of the coast,
my raft ran aground, at one end of it, upon a shoal,
not being aground at the other, it wanted but a little
that all my cargo had slipped off towards that end
that was afloat, and so fallen into the water. I did
my utmost by setting by back against the chests, to
keep them in their places, but could not thrust off the
raft with all my strength; neither durst I stir from
the posture I was in, but, holding up the chests with
all my might, stood in"that manner near half an hour,
in which time the rising of the water brought me a
little upon a level, and, a little after, the water still
rising, my raft floated again, and I thrust her off
with the oar I had into the channel, and then driving
up higher, I at length found myself in the mouth of
a little river, with land on both sides, and a strong
current of tide running up. I looked on both sides
for a proper'place to get to shore, for I was not willing
to be driven too high up the river, hoping in time to
see some ship at sea, and therefore resolved to place
myself as near the coast as I could.
At length I spied a little cove on the right shore of
the creek, to which with great pain and difficulty I
guided my raft, and at last got so near, as that,
reaching ground with my oar, I could thrust her
directly in; but here I had liked to have dipped all
my cargo in the sea again, for that shore lying pretty
steep, that is to say, sloping, there was no pla':c to
land, but where one end of the float, if it ran on
shore, would lie so high, and the other sink lower as
before, that it would endanger my cargo again. All
that I could do was to wait till the tide was at the
highest, keeping the raft with my oar, like an anchor,
to hold the side of it fast to the shore, near a flat
piece of ground, which I expected the water would
flow over, and so it did. As soon as I found water
enough (for my raft drew about a foot of water), I
thrust her upon that flat piece of ground, and there
fastened or moored her, by sticking my two broken
oars into the ground, one on one side near one end,
and one on the other side near the other end; and
thus I lay till the water ebbed away, and left my
raft and all my cargo safe on shore.
My next work was to view the country, and seek
a proper place for my habitation, and where to stow
my goods to secure them from whatever might hap-
pen. Where I was I yet knew not, whether on the
continent or on an island; whether inhabited, or not
inhabited; whether in danger of wild beasts or not.
There was a hill not above a mile from me, which
rose up very steep and high, and which seemed to
overtop some other hills, which lay as in a ridge from
it northward. I took out one of the fowling pieces,
and one of the pistols, and a horn of powder, and
thus armed, I travelled for discovery up to the top
of that hill, where, after I had with great labour and
difficulty got up, I immediately saw my fate, to my
great affliction; viz. that I was in an island, en-
vironed every way with the sea, no land to be seen,
except some rocks, which lay a great way off, and
two small islands less than this, which lay about
three leagues to the west.
I found also that the island I was in was barren,
and, as I saw good reason to believe, uninhabited,
except by wild beasts, of which, however, I saw
none; yet I saw abundance of fowls, but knew not
their kinds, neither, when I killed them, could I tell
what was fit for food, and what not. At my coming
back, I shot at a great bird, which I saw sitting upon
a tree, on the side of a large wood. I believe it was
the first gun that had been fired there since the
creation of the world. I had no sooner fired, but
from all parts of the wood there arose an extra-
ordinary number of fowls, of many sorts, making a
confused screaming and crying, every one according
to his usual note; but not one of them of any kind
that I knew. As for that creature I killed, I took
it to be a kind of a hawk, its color and beak re-
sembling it, but it had no talons or claws more than
common: its flesh was carrion, and fit for nothing.
Contented with this discovery, I came back to my
raft, and fell to work to bring the rest of my cargo
on shore, which took me up the rest of the day.
What to do with myself at night I knew not, nor
indeed where to rest; for I was afraid to lie down on
the ground, not knowing but some wild beast might
devour me, though I afterward found there was really
no need for those fears.
However, as well as I could, I barricaded myself
round with the chests and boards that I had brought
on shore, and made a kind of hut for that night's
lodging: as for food, I yet saw not which way to
supply myself, except that I had seen two or three
creatures; like hares, run out of the wood where I shot the fowl.
I now began to consider that I might yet get a
great many things out of the ship which would be
useful to me, and particularly some of the rigging
and sails, and such other things as might come to
hand, and I resolved to make another voyage on
board the vessel if possible; and as I knew that the
first storm that blew must necessarily break her in
pieces, I resolved to set all other things apart till I got every thing out of the ship that I could get:
then I called a council, that is to say, in my thoughts,
whether I should take back the raft, but this
appeared impracticable, so I resolved to go as before,
when the tide was down, and I did so, only that I stripped before I went from my hut, having nothing
on but a checkered shirt, a pair of linen drawers,
and a pair of pumps on my feet.
I got on board the ship as before, and prepared a
second raft; and having had experience of the first,
I neither made this so unwieldy, nor loaded it so
hard; but yet I brought away several things very
useful to me ; as first, in the carpenter's stores I found
two or three bags full of nails and spikes, a great
screw jack, a dozen or two of hatchets, and, above
all, that most useful thing called a grindstone: all
these I secured, together with several things belong-
ing to the gunner, particularly three iron crows, and
two barrels of musket bullets, seven muskets, and
another fowling-piece, with a small quantity of pow-
der more; a large bag full of small shot, and a great
roll of sheet lead, but this last was so heavy, I could
not hoist it up to get it over the ship's side.
Besides these things, I took all the men's clothes
that I could find, and a spare fore-topsail, hammock, and some bedding, and with this I loaded my second
raft, and brought them also safe on shore.
I was under some apprehensions, during my absence
from the land, that at least my provisions might be
devoured on shore; but when I came back, I found
no sign of any visitor, only there sat a creature like
a wild cat upon one of the chests, which, when I came
towards it, ran away to a little distance, and then
stood still. She sat very composed and unconcerned,
and looked full in my face, as if she had a mind to be
acquainted with me. I presented my gun at her, but
as she did not understand it, she was perfectly un-
concerned, nor did she offer to stir away; upon which
I tossed her a bit of biscuit, though I was not very
free of it, for my store was not great. However, I gave her a bit; she smelled of it, eat it, and looked
for more; but I thanked her, and could spare no
more, so she marched off.
Having got my second cargo on shore (though I was fain to open the barrels of powder, and bring
them by parcels, for they were too heavy, being large
casks), I went to work to make a little tent with the
sail and some poles which I cut for that purpose;
and into this tent I brought every thing that I knew
would spoil, either with rain or sun; and I piled all
the empty chests and casks up in a circle round the
tent, to fortify it from any attempt from man or beast.
When I had done this, I blocked up the door of the
tent with some boards within. and an empty chest
set up on an end without, and spreading one of the
beds upon the ground, laying my two pistols just at
my head, and my gun at length by me, I went to
bed for the first time, and slept little, and had la-
boured hard all day, as well to fetch those things
from the ship, as to get them on shore.
1 had the largest magazine of all kinds now that
ever was laid up, I believe, for one man; but I was
not satisfied still, for while the ship sat upright in
that posture, I thought I ought to get every thing
out of her that I could: so every day, at low water,
I went on board, and brought away something or
other. But particularly the third time I went, I brought away as much of the rigging as I could, as
also all the small ropes and rope-twine I could get,
with a piece of spare canvas, which was to mend the
sails upon occasion, and the barrel of wet gunpowder. In a word, I brought away all the sails first and last,
only that I was fain to cut them in pieces, and bring
as much at a time as I could, for they were no more
useful to me for sails, but as mere canvas only.
But that which comforted me more still was, that
at last of all, after I had made five or six such voy-
ages as these, and thought I had nothing more to
expect from the ship that was worth my meddling
with, I say, after all this, I found a great hogshead
of bread, three large runlets of rum or spirits, a box
of sugar, and a barrel of fine flour: this was surpris-
ing to me, because I had given over expecting any
more provisions, except what was spoiled by the
water. I soon emptied the hogshead of that bread,
and wrapt it up, parcel by parcel, in pieces of the
sails which I cut out; and, in a word, I got this safe
on shore also, though at several times.
The next day I made another voyage; and now,
having plundered the ship of what was portable, and
fit to hand out, I began with the cables; and cutting
the great cable into pieces, such as I could move, I got two cables and a haulser on shore, with all the
iron work I could get; and having cut down the
sprit-sail-yard, and the mizen-yard, and every thing
I could to make a large raft, I loaded it with all
those heavy goods and came away. But my good
luck began "to leave me, for this raft was so unwieldy
and so overloaded, that after I was entered the little
cove where I had landed the rest of my goods, not
being able to guide it so handily as I did the other, it
overset, and threw me and all my cargo into the
water. As for myself, it was no great harm, for I was near the shore; but as to my cargo, it was great
part of it lost, especially the iron, which I expected
would have been of great use to me. However, when
the tide was out, I got most of the pieces of cable
ashore, and some of the iron. though with infinite
labour, for I was fain to dip for it into the water, a
work which fatigued me very much. After this I went every day, and brought away what I could.
I had now been thirteen days on shore, and had
been eleven times on board the ship, in which times
I had brought away all that one pair of hands could
well be supposed capable to bring, though I believe
verily, had the calm weather held, I should have
brought away the whole ship piece by piece. But
preparing the twelfth time to go on board, I found
the wind began to rise; however, at low water, I went on board; and though I thought I had rum-
maged the cabin so effectually as that nothing more
could be found, yet Ifdiscovered a locker with draw-
ers in it, in one of which I found two or three razors
and one pair of large scissors, with ten or a dozen
good knives and forks; in another I found about
thirty-six pounds value in money, some European
coin, some Brazil, some pieces of eight, some gold,
some silver.
I smiled to myself at the sight of this money. "O
drug," said I aloud, " what art thou good for? Thou
art not worth to me, no, not the taking off the ground.
One of those knives is worth all this heap. I have
no manner of use for thee, even remain where thou
art, and go to the bottom as a creature whose life is
not worth saving!" However upon second thoughts
I took it away, and wrapping all this in a piece of
canvas, I began to think of making another raft;
but while I was preparing this, I found the sky over-
cast, and the wind began to rise, and in a quarter of
an hour it blew a fresh gale from the shore ; it pre-
sently occurred that it was in vain to pretend to make
a raft with the wind off shore, and that it was my
business to be gone before the tide of flood began,
otherwise I might not be able to reach the shore at
all: accordingly, I let myself down into the water,
and swam across the channel which lay between the
ship and the sand, and even that with difficulty
enough, partly with the weight of the things I had
about me, and partly the roughness of the water, for
the wind rose very hastily, and before it was quite
high water it blew a storm.
But I was gotten home to my little tent, where I
lay with all my wealth about me very secure ; it
blew very hard all that night, and in the morning,
when I looked out, behold no more of the ship was
to be seen. I was a little surprised, but recovered
myself with this satisfactory reflection, viz. that I
had lost no time, nor abated any diligence, to get
every thing out of her that could be useful to me:
and that, indeed, there was little left in her that I
was able to bring away, if I had had more time. I
now gave over any more thought of the ship, or of
any thing out of her, except what might drive on
shore from her wreck, as indeed divers pieces of her
afterwards did; but those things were little use to me.
My thoughts were now wholly employed about se-
curing myself against either savages, if any should
appear, or wild beasts, if any were in the island; and
I had many thoughts of the method how to do this,
and what kind of dwelling to make, whether I should
make me a cave in the earth, or a tent upon the earth,
and, in short, I resolved upon both; the manner and
description of which I will give an account of.
I soon found this place was not for my settlement,
particularly because it was low moorish ground near
the sea, which I thought would not be wholesome,
and more particularly because there was no fresh
B
water near it: so I resolved to find a more healthy
and more convenient spot of ground.
I consulted several things in my situation. which
I found would be proper for me; first, health, and
fresh water, as I just now mentioned; secondly,
shelter from the heat of the sun; thirdly, security
from ravenous creatures,either man or beast; fourthly,
a view of the sea, that if God sent any ship in sight,
I might not lose any advantage for my deliverance,
for which I was not willing to banish all hopes.
In search for a place proper for this, I found a little
plain on the side of a rising hill, whose front towards
this little plain was as steep as a house-side, so that
nothing could come down upon me from the top.
On the side of this rock there was a hollow place,
worn a little way in, like the entrance or door of a
cave, but there was no cave or way into the rock.
On the flat of the green, just before this hollow
place, I resolved to pitch my tent. This plain was
not above a hundred yards broad, and about twice as
long, and lay like a green before my door, and at the
end it descended irregularly every way down into the
low grounds by the seaside. It was on the N. N.
W. side of the hill, so that it was sheltered from the
heat every day, till it came to a W. and by S. sun, or
thereabouts, which in those countries is near setting.
Before I set up my tent, I drew a half-circle before
the hollow place, which took in about ten yards in
semi-diameter, from its beginning and ending.
In this half-circle I pitched two rows of strong
stakes, driving them into the ground till they stood
very firm like piles, the biggest end being out of the
ground about five feet and a half, and sharpened on
the top; the two rows stood about six inches apart.
Then I took the pieces of cable which I had cut
in the ship, and laid them in rows upon one another,
within the circle between the two rows of stakes, up
to the top, placing other stakes in the inside, leaning
against them, about two feet and a half high, like a
spur to a post, and this fence was so strong that
neither man nor beast could get into it. This cost
me a great deal of time and labour, especially to cut
the piles, bring them, and drive them into the earth.
The entrance into this place I made to be, not by
a door, but by a ladder over the top;. which ladder,
when I was in, I lifted over after me, and so I was
completely fenced in, and fortified, as I thought,
from all the world, and consequently slept secure in
the night, which otherwise I could not have done.
though, as it appeared afterwards, there was no need
of all this caution.
Into this fence, or fortress, with infinite labour, I
carried all my riches, all my provisions, ammunition,
and stores; and I made a large tent also, which, to pre-
serve me from the rains, that in one part of the year are
very violent here, I made double, viz. one smaller
tent within, and one large tent above it, and covered
the uppermost with a large tarpaulin, which I had
brought on shore from among the sails.
And now I lay no more for awhile in the bed that
I had brought on shore, but in a hammock, which was
a very good one, and belonged to the mate.
Into this tent I brought all my provisions, and every
thing that would spoil by the wet; and having thus
enclosed all my goods, I made up the entrance, which, till now was left open, and so passed by a ladder.
When I had done this, I began to work my way
into the rock, and bringing all the earth and stones
out through mv tent, I laid them up within my fence
in the nature of a terrace, so that it raised the ground
within about a foot and a half, and thus I made me a
cave just behind my tent, which served for a cellar.
It cost me much labor, and many days, before all
these things were brought to perfection; and, there-
fore, I must go back to some other things which took
up some of my thoughts. At the same time it hap-
pened, after I had laid my scheme for setting up my
tent, and making the cave, that a storm of rain fal-
E 2
ling from a dark thick cloud, a sudden flash of light-
ning happened, and after that a clap of thunder, as
is naturally the effect of it. I was not so much sur-
prised with the lightning, as with the thought which
darted into my mind:—O my powder! My heart
sunk within me, to think that at one blast all my
powder might be destroyed; on which, not my de-
fence only, but the providing me food, as I thought,
entirely depended; I was nothing near so anxious
about my own danger; though had the powder took
fire, I had never known who had hurt me.
Such impression did this make upon me, that after
the storm was over, I laid aside all my works, my
building and fortifying, and applied myself to make
bags and boxes to separate my powder, and to keep
it a little and a little in a parcel, in hopes, that what-
ever might come, it might not all take fire at once,
and to keep it so apart, that it should not be possible
to make one part fire the other. I finished this work
in about a fortnight, and my powder, which in all
was about 1401b. weight, wasdivided.into no less than
a hundred parcels. As to the barrel that had been
wet, I did not apprehend any danger from that, so I
placed it in my new cave, which in my fancy I called
my kitchen, and the rest I hid in the rocks, that no wet
might get to it, carefully marking where I laid it.
In the interval of time while this was doing, I went
out once every day with my gun, as well to divert
myself, as to see if I could kill any thing fit for
food, and, as near as I could, to acquaint myself
with what the island produced. The first time I
went out, I discovered that there were goats in the
island, which was a great satisfaction to me; but
then it was attended with this misfortune, viz. that
they were so shy, so subtle, and so swift of foot, that
it was the difficultest thing in the world to come at
them, but I was not discouraged at this, not doubting
but I might now and then shoot one, as it soon hap-
pened, for after I had found their haunts a little, I
laid wait in this manner for them: having observed,
if they saw me in the valleys, though they were upon
the rocks, they would run away in a terrible fright ;
but if they were feeding in the valleys, and I was
upon the rocks, they took no notice of me; from
whence I concluded, that by the position of their
optics, their sight was so directed downward, that
they did not readily see objects that were above them;
so I always climbed the rocks first to get above them,
and then had frequently a fair mark. The first shot
I made among these creatures, I killed a she-goat
which had a little kid by her, she gave suck to, which
grieved me heartily; but when the old one fell, the
kid stood stock still by her till I came and took her
up; and not only so, but when I carried the old one
upon my shoulders, the kid followed me quite to my
enclosure; upon which I laid down the dam, and took
the kid in my arms, and carried it over my pale, in
hopes to have bred it up tame; but it would not eat,
so I was forced to kill it, and eat it myself. These
two supplied me with flesh a great while; for I ate
sparingly, and saved my provisions (my bread espe-
cially) as much as I possibly could.
Having fixed my habitation, I found it absolutely
necessary to provide a place to make a fire in, and
fuel to burn; and what I did for that as also how I en-
Jarged my cave, and what conveniences I made, I
shall give a full account of in its place ; but I must
first give some little account of myself, and of my
thoughts of living, which were not a few.
I had a dismal prospect of my condition; for as
I was not cast away upon that island without being
driven, as is said, by a violent storm quite out of the
course of our intended voyage, and a great way, viz.
some hundreds of leagues, out of the ordinary course
of the trade of mankind, I had great reason to con-
eider it as a determination of Heaven, that in this
desolate place, and in this desolate manner, I should
end my life. The tears would run plentifully down
my face, when I made these reflections; and some-
times I would expostulate with myself, why Provi-
dence should thus completely ruin its creatures, and
render them so absolutely miserable, without help,
abandoned, and so entirely depressed, that it could
hardly be rational to be thankful for such a life?
But something always returned swift upon me to
check these thoughts, and to reprove me; and parti-
cularly one day, walking with my gun in my hand
by the sea-side, I was very pensive upon the subject
pi' my present condition, when reason, as it were, put
in, expostulating with me the other way, thus :—
Well, you are in a desperate condition, it is true, but
pray remember, where are the rest of you? Did not
you come eleven of you into the boat? where are the
ten? why were not"they saved, and you lost? why
were you singled out? is it better to be here or there?
And then I pointed to the sea. Al l evils are to be
considered with the good that is in them, and with
what worse attended them.
Then it occurred to me again, how well I was fur-
nished for my subsistence, and what would have been
my case, if it had not happened, which was a hundred
thousand to one, that the ship floated from the place
where she first struck, and was driven so near to the
.shore, that I had time to get all things out of her?
What would have been my case, if I had been to have
lived in the condition in which I at first came on
shore, without necessaries of life, or any means to
supply and procure them? Particularly, what would
I have done without a gun, without ammunition,
without any tools to make any thing, or to work
with? without clothes, bedding, a tent, or any man-
ner of covering ? And that now I had all these to
a sufficient quantity, and was in a fair way to provide
myself in such a manner, as to livewithout my gun
when my ammunition was spent, so that I had a
tolerable view of subsisting without any want as long
as I lived, for I considered from the beginning how I
would provide for the accidents that might happen,
'and for the time that was to come, even not only
after my ammunition should be spent, but even after
my health or strength should decay.
I confess I had not then entertained any notion of
my ammunition being destroyed at one blast, I mean
my powder being blown up by lightning; and this
made the thoughts of it so surprising to me, when it
lightened and thundered, as I observed just now.
And now, being to enter into a melancholy relation
of a scene of silent life, such, perhaps, as was never
heard of in the world before, I shall take it from its
beginning, and continue it in its order. It was, by
my account, the S'Jth of September, when, in the
manner aljove-said, I first set foot upon this horrid
island, when the sun being to us, in its autumnal
equinox, was almost just over my head; for I reck-
oned myself by observation, to be in the latitude of
9 degrees 22 minutes north of the Line.
After I had been here about ten or twelve days, it
eame into my thoughts, that I should lose my reck-
oning of time for want of books, and pen and ink, and
should even forget the Sabbath days from the work-
ing days; but to prevent this, lent it with my knife
upon a large post, in capital letters, and, making it
into a great cross, I set it up on the shore where I
first landed; viz. I came on shore here the 30th of
Sept. Ifiofcl. Upon the sides of this square post I cut
every day a notch with my knife, and every seventh
notch was as long again as_ the rest, and every first
day of the month as long again as the long one, and
thus I kept my calendar, or weekly, monthly, and
yearly reckoning of time.
In the next place we are to observe that among
many things which I brought off the ship in the
several voyages, which, as above-mentioned, I made
to it, I got several things of less value, but not at all
less useful to me, which I omitted setting down be-
-fore, as in particular, pens, ink, and paper, several
parcels from the captain's, mate's, gunner's, and Carpenter's keeping, three or four compasses, some
mathematical instruments, dials, perspectives, charts,
and books of navigation, all which I huddled toge-
ther, whether I might want them or no; also I found
three very good Bibles, which came to me in my
cargo from England, and which I had packed up
among my things, some Portuguese books also, and
among them two or three Popish prayer-books, and
several other books, all of which I carefully secured.
And I must not forget that we had in the ship a dog
and two cats, of whose eminent history I may have
occasion to say something in its place, for I carried
both the cats with me, and as for the dog, he jumped
out of the ship of himself, and swam on shore to me
the day after I went on shore with my first cargo,
and was a trusty servant to me many years. I wanted
nothing that he could fetch me, nor any company
that he could make up to me, I only wanted to have
him talk to me, but that he could not do. As I ob-
served before, I found pens, ink, and paper, and I
husbanded to the utmost: and I shall show, that
while my ink lasted, I kept things very exact; but
after that was gone, I could not; for I could not
make any ink by any means that I could devise.
And this put me in mind that I wanted many things;
and of these, this of ink was one, as also a spade,
pick-axe, and shovel, to dig or remove the earth;
needles, pins, and thread; as for linen, I soon learned
to want that without much difficulty.
This want of tools made every work I did go on
heavily, and it was near a whole year before I had
entirely finished my little pale, or surrounded habi-
tation; the piles, or stakes, which were as heavy as
I could well lift, were a long time cutting and pre-
paring in the woods, and more by far in bringing
home, so that I spent sometimes two days in cutting
and bringing home one of these posts, and a third
day in driving it into the ground; for which I got a
heavy piece of wood at first, but at last bethought
myself of one of the iron crows, which, however,
though I found it, yet made driving those posts or
pales very laborious and tedious work.
But what need I have been concerned at the tedl-
ousncss of any thing I had to do, having time enough
to do it in? Nor had I any other employment, that
I could foresee, except seeking for food.
I now began to consider seriously my condition,
and the circumstance I was reduced to, and I drew
up the state of my affairs in writing, not so much to
leave them to any that were to come after me, for I
was like to have but few heirs, as to deliver my
thoughts from daily poring upon them, and afflicting
my mind; and as my reason began now to master
my despondency, I began to comfort myself as well
as I could, and to set the good against the evil, that
I might have something to distinguish my case from
worse; and I stated it very impartially, like debtor
and creditor, the comforts I enjoyed, against the
miseries I suffered, thus :—
EVIL. GoOD.
I am cast upon a horrible
desolate island, void of all
hope of recovery.
I am singled out, and se-
parated, as it were, from all
the world, to be miserable.
I am divided from man-
kind, a solitary one, banished
from human society.
I have no clothes to cover
me.
I am without any defence
or means to resist any vio-
lence of man or beast.
But I am alive, and not
drowned, as all my ship's
company was.
But I am singled out, too,
from all the ship's crew, to
be spared from death; and
he that miraculously saved
me from death, can deliver
me from this condition.
But I >un not starved, and
perishing on a barren place,
affording no sustenance.
But I am in a hot climate, where, if I . had clothes, I
could hardly wear them.
But I am cast on an island,
where I see no wild beasts
to hurt me, as I saw on the
coast of Africa; and what if I
had been shipwrecked there 1
I have no soul to speak to, But God wonderfully sent
or relieve me. the ship near enough to the
shore, that I have gotten out
so many necessary things as
will either supply my wants,
or enable me to supply my-
self, even as long as I live. i
Upon the whole, there was an undoubted testimony,
that there was scarce a condition in the world so
miserable, but there was something negative, or
something positive, to be thankful for in it; and let
this stand as a direction from the experience of the
miserable of all conditions in this world. that we may
always find in it something to comfort ourselves
from, and to set, in the description of good and evil,
on the credit ^»de of the account.
Having now brought my mind a little to relish my
condition, and giving over looking out to sea, to see
if I could spy a ship; I say, giving over these things,
I began to apply myself to accommodate my way of
living, and to make things as easy to me as I could.
I have already described my habitation, which was
a tent under the side of a rock, surrounded with a
strong pale of posts and cables, but I might rather
call it a wall, for I raised a kind of wall up against
it of turfs, about two feet thick on the outside, and
after some time (I think it was a year and a half) I
raised rafters from it, leaning to the rock, and thatch-
ed or covered it with boughs of trees, and such things
as I could get to keep out the rain, which I found at
some times of the year very violent.
I have already observed how I brought all my
goods into this pale, and into the cave which I had
made behind me; but I must observe too, that, at
first, this was a confused heap of goods, which, as they
lay in no order, so they took up all my place; I had
no room to turn myself; so I set myself to enlarge
my cave, and worked farther into the earth, for it
was a loose sandy rock, which yielded easily to the
labour I bestowed on it; and so, when I found I was pretty safe as to the beasts of prey, I worked sideways
to the right hand into the rock, and then turning to
the right again, workedquite out, and made me a door
to come out on the outside of my pale or fortification.
This gave not only egress and regress, as it was a
back way to my tent, and to my storehouse, but
gave me room to stow my goods. -
And now I began to apply myself to make such
necessary things as I found I most wanted, particu-
larly a chair and a table, for without these I was not
able to enjoy the few comforts I had in the world:
I could not write or eat, or several things, with so
much pleasure without a table.
So I went to work; and here I must needs ob-
serve, that as reason is the substance and original of
the mathematics, so by stating and squaring every
thing by reason, and by making the most rational
judgment of things, every man may be, in time,
master of every mechanic art. I had never handled
a tool in my life, and yet, in time, by labour, appli-
cation, and contrivance, I found, at last, that I could
have made any thing, especially if I had had tools;
however, I made abundance of things, even without
tools, and some with no more tools than an adze and
a hatchet, which, perhaps, were never made that way
before, and that with infinite labour. For example,
if I wanted a board, I had no other way but to cut
down a tree, set it on an edge before me, and hew it
flat on either side with my axe, till I had brought it
to be as thin as a plank, and then dub it smooth
with 'my adze. It is true, that by this method I
could make but one board out of a whole tree; but
this I had no remedy for but patience, any more than
I had for the prodigious deal of time and labour
which it took me up to make a plank or board; but
my time or labour was little worth, and so it was as
well employed one way as another.
However, I made me a table and a chair, as I ob-
served above, in the first place, and this I did out of
the short pieces of board that I brought on my raft
from the ship; but when I had wrought out some
boards, as above, I made large shelves of the breadth
of a foot and a half, one over another, all along one
side of my cave, to lay all my tools, nails, and iron-
pieces into the wall of the rock to
hang my guns, and all things that would hang up.
So that had my cave been to be seen, it looked like
a general magazine of all necessary things; and I had
every thing so ready to my hand, that it was a great
pleasure to me to see all my goods in such order, and
especially to find my stock of all necessaries so
great.
And now it was when I began to keep a iournal of
every day's employment: for, indeed, at first I was
in too much hurry, and not only hurry as to labor, but in too much discomposure of mind, and my jour-
nal would have been full of many dull things. For
example, I must have said thus:—September the 30th,
After I got on shore, and had escaped drowning, in-
stead of being thankful to God for my deliverance,
having first vomited with the great quantity of salt
water which was gotten into my stomach, and re-
covering myself a little, I ran about the shore, wring-
ing my hands, and beating my head and face, ex-
claiming at my misery, and crying out, I was undone!
undone! till, tired and faint, I was forced to lie down
on the ground to repose, but durst not sleep for fear
of being devoured.
Some days after this, and after having been on
board the ship, and got all I could out of her, yet I
could not forbear getting up to the top of a little
mountain, and looking out to sea, in hopes of seeing
a ship, then fancy at a vast distance, I spied a sail,
please myself with the hopes of it, and then, after
looking steadily till I was almost blind, lose it quite,
and sit down and weep like a child, and thus increase
my misery by my folly.
But having got over these things, in some measure,
and having settled my household stuff and habitation,
made me a table and a chair, and all as handsome
about me as I could, I began, I say, to keep my
journal, of which I shall here give you the copy
(though in it will be told all these particulars over
again), as long as it lasted, for at last having no
more ink, I was forced to leave it off.
THE JOURNAL.
September 30, 16o9.—I, poor miserable Robinson
Crusoe, being shipwrecked during a dreadful storm
in the offing, came on shore on this dismal unfortunate
island, which I called the Island of Despair, all the
rest or the ship's company being drowned, and myself almost dead.
All the rest of the day I spent in afflicting myself
at the dismal circumstances I was brought to, viz. I
had neither house, food, clothes, weapon, or place to
fly to, and nothing but death before me, either that
I should be devoured by savages, or starved to death
for want of food. At the approach of night, I slept
in a tree, for fear of wild creatures.
Oct. 1.—In the morning I saw, to my surprise, the
ship had floated with the high tide, and was driven
on shore again much nearer the island, which, as it
was some comfort on one hand, so, on the other hand,
it renewed my grief at the loss of my comrades, who,
I imagined, if we had all stayed on board, might have
saved the ship, or, at least they would not all have
been drowned, as they were; and that, had the men
been saved, we might, perhaps, have built us a
boat out of the ruins of the ship, to have carried us
to some other part of the world. Seeing the ship
almost dry, I went upon the sand as near as I could,
and then swam on board. This day continued rainy,
though with no wind at all.
From the 1st of Oct. to the 24th.—All these days
entirely spent in making several voyages to get all I could out of the ship, which I brought on shore. Much
rain also in these days, though with some intervals of
fair weather; but, it seems, this was the rainy season.
Oct. 24.—1 overset my raft, and all the goods I had got upon it, but being in shoal water, and the
things being chiefly heavy, I recovered many of them
when the tide was out.
Oct. M.-- It rained all night, and all day, with
some wind, during which time the ship broke in
pieces, and was no more to be seen, except the^reck
of her, and that only at low water. I spent this day
in covering and securing the goods which I had
saved, that the rain might not spoil them.
Oct. 20.—I walked about the shore almost all day
to find out a place to fix my habitation, greatly con-
cerned to secure myself from any attack in the night, either from beasts or men. Towards night I fixed
upon a proper place under a rock, and marked out a
semicircle for my encampment, which I resolved to
Strengthen with a wall, or fortification, made of double
piles, lined within with cable, and without with turf.
From the 2(>th to the 30th, I worked very hard in
carrying all my goods to my new habitation, though
some part of the time it rained exceeding hard.
The 31st, in the morning, I went out into the
island with my gun, to see for some food, when I
killed a she-goat, and her kid followed me home,
which I afterwards killed, because it would not eat.
Nov. 1.—I set up my tent under a rock, and lay
there for the first night, making it as large as I could,
with stakes driven in to swing my hammock upon.
Nov. 2.—I set up all my chests and boards, and
the pieces of timber which made my rafts, and with
them formed a fence round me, a little within the
place I had marked out for my fortification.
Nov. 3.—I went out with my gun, and killed two
fowls like ducks, which were very good food. In the
afternoon, went to work to make me a table.
Nov. 5.—This morning I began to order my times
of work, of going out with my gun, time of sleep, and
time of diversion; viz. every morning I walked out
with my gun, for two or three hours, if it did not
rain; then employed myself to work till about eleven
o'clock; then eat what I had to live-on ; and from
twelve to two, I lay down to sleep, the weather being
excessively hot, and then in the evening to work again.
The working part of this day and the next were
wholly employed in making my table, which I did
not finish.
Nov. 5.—This day I went abroad with my gun and
dog, and killed a wild cat, her skin pretty soft, but
her flesh good for nothing. Every creature I killed,
I took off the skins and preserved them. Coming
back, by the sea-shore, I saw many sorts of sea-
fowls which I did not understand; but was surprised
to see two or three seals, which, while I was gazing
at, got into the sea, and escaped me for that time.
Nov. 0.—After my morning walk I went to work
with my table again, and finished it, though not to
my liking; and I soon learned to mend it.
Nov. 7.—Now it began to be settled fair weather.
The 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, and part of the 12th (for the
llth was Sunday, according to my reckoning,) I took
wholly up to make me a chair, and, with much ado,
brought it to a tolerable shape, but never to please
me; and even in the making I pulled it to pieces
several times. ' Note.—I soon neglected keeping my
Sundays, for, omitting my mark for them on my post,
I forgot which was which.
Nov. 13.—This day it rained, which refreshed me
exceedingly, and cooled the earth; but it was accom-
panied with terrible thunder and lightning, which
made me fearful of my powder. When it was over,
I resolved to separate my powder into as many little
parcels as possible, to prevent danger.
Nov. 14,15, IB.—These threcdays I spent in making
little square chests or boxes, which might hold about
a pound, or two, of powder; and so putting the pow-
der in, I stowed it away in places as secure and re-
mote from one another as possible. On one of these
three days I killed a large bird that was good to eat,
but I knew not what to call it.
Nov. 17.—This day I began to dig behind my tent
into the rock, to make room for my farther conveni-
ency. Note.—Three things I wanted exceedingly
for this work, viz. a pick-axe, a shovel, and a wheel-
barrow, or basket. As for the pick-axe, I made use
of the iron crows, which were proper enough, though
heavy; but the next thing was a shovel or spade;
this was so absolutely necessary, that indeed I could
do nothing effectually without it, but what kind of
one to make I knew not.
Nov. 18.—The next day, in searching the woods, I found a tree of that wood, or like it, which, in the
Brazils, they call the iron-tree, for its exceeding
hardness; of this I cut a piece, and brought it home
with difficulty, for it was exceeding heavy. The ex-
cessive hardness of the wood made me along while
upon this machine, but I worked it effectually by
little and little, into the form of a shovel or spade,
the handle exactly shaped like ours in England, only
that the broad part having no iron shod upon it at
bottom, would not last me so long; however, it
served well enough for the uses which I had occasion
to put it to. I was still deficient, for I wanted a
basket, or a wheelbarrow; A basket I could not
make by any means, having no such thing as twigs
that would bend to make wicker-ware; and, as to
the wheelbarrow, I fancied I could make all but the
wheel; but that I had no notion of, neither did I
know how to go about it, so I gave it over: and so,
for carrying away the earth which I dug out of the
cave, I made me a thing like a hod, which the labour-
ers carry mortar in to serve the bricklayers. This
was not so difficult to me as the making the shovel;
and yet this, and the shovel, and the attempt which
J made in vain to make a wheelbarrow, took me up
no less than four days: I mean always, excepting
my morning walk with my gun, which I seldom
failed, and nearly always brought something home
fit to eat.
Nov. 23.—My other work having stood still because
of my making these tools, when they were finished I went on; and, working every day as my time and
strength allowed, I spent eighteen days entirely in
widening and keeping my cave, that it might hold
my goods commodiously. Note.—During all this
time, I worked to make this room, or cave, spacious
enough to accommodate me as a warehouse or maga-
zine, a kitchen, a dining-room, and a cellar: as for a
lodging, I kept to the tent, except that sometimes
in the wet season of the year it rained so hard, that
I could not keep myself dry; which caused me after-
wards to cover all my place within my pale with long
poles, in the form of rafters, leaning against the rock,
and load them with flags, and large leaves of trees,
like a thatch.
Dec. 10.—I began now to think my cave or vault
finished, when, on a sudden, a. great quantity of
earth fell down from the top and one side, so much
that, in short/it frighted me, and not without reason
too; for if I had been under it, I should never have
wanted a grave-digger. Upon this disaster, I had a
great deal of work to do over again; for I had the
loose earth to carry out, and, which was of more
importance, I had the ceiling to prop up, so that I might be sure no more would come down.
Dec. 11.—This day I went to work with it accord-
ingly, and got two shores, or posts, pitched upright
to the top, with two pieces of boards across over
each post. This I finished the next day; and setting
more posts up with boards, in about a week more I had the roof secured; and the posts^ standing in rows,
served me for partitions to part offmy house.
Dec. 10.—From this day to the 20th 1 placed
f
shelves, and knocked nails into the posts, to hang
every thing up that could be hung up.
Dec. 23.—Now I carried every thing into the cave,
and began to furnish my house, and set up some
pieces of boards like a dresser, to order my victuals
upon; but boards began to be very scarce with me.
Made another table.
Dec. 24,25.—Much rain both these days, and no
stirring out.
Dec. 26.—No rain, and the earth rather cooler
than before, and pleasanter.
Dec. 27.—Killed a young goat, and lamed another,
so that I catched it, and led it home in a string, and
bound and splintered its leg, which was broke. N. B.—I took such care of it that it lived, and the
leg grew well, and as strong as ever; but by nursing
it so long it grew tame, and fed upon the little green
at my door, and would not go away. This was the
first time that I entertained a thought of breeding
up some tame creatures, that I might have food
when my powder and shot was all spent.
Dec. 28, 20,00.—Great heats and no breeze, so that
there was no stirring abroad, except in the evening
for food. This time I spent in putting all my things
in order within doors.
Jan. 1.—Very hot still; but I went abroad early
and late with my gun, and lay still in the middle of
the day. This evening, going farther into the valleys,
which lay to the centre of the island, I found there
were plenty of goats, though exceeding shy, and hard
to come at: however, I resolved to try if I could not
bring my dog to hunt them down.
Jan. 2.—Accordingly the next day I went out with
my dog, and set him upon the goats, but they all
faced about upon the dog, and he knew his danger
too well, for he would not come near them.
Jan. 3.—I began my fence or wall, which, to pre-
vent attack, I resolved to make very thick and strong.
[N. B.—This wall being described before, I pur-
posely omit what was said in the journal: it is nuffi-
cient to observe, that I was no less than from the 3d
of Jan. to the 14th of April, working, finishing, and
perfecting this wall, though it was no more than
about 24 yards in length, being a half circle, from one
place in the rock to another place about eight yards
from it, the door of the cave being in the centre
behind it]
Al l this time I worked very hard, the rains hin-
dering me many days, nay, sometimes weeks toge-
ther; but I thought I should never be perfectly
secure till this wall was finished: and it is scarce cre-
dible what inexpressible labour every thing was done
with, especially bringing piles out of the woods, and
driving them into the ground, for I made them much
bigger than I needed to have done.
When this wall was finished, and the outside double
fenced, with a turf wall raised up close to it, I per-
suaded myself, that if any people were to come on
shore there, they would not perceive any thing like
a habitation: and it was very well I did so, as may
be observed hereafter, upon a remarkable occasion.
During this time I made' my rounds in the woods
for game every day, when the rain permitted me,
and made frequent discoveries in these walks of some-
thing or other to my advantage; particularly I found
a kind of wild pigeons, which built not as wood-
pigeons in a tree, but rather as house-pigeons, in the
holes of the rocks; and taking some young ones, I
endeavoured to bring them up tame, and did so; but
when they grew older, they all flew away, which
perhaps was at first for want of feeding them, for I
had nothing to give them; however, I frequently
found their nests, and got their young ones, which
were very good meat.
And now, in the managing my household affairs,
I found myself wanting many things which I thought
at first impossible for me to make, as indeed as to
'some of them it was: for instance, I could never make
F 2
84 ROBINSON CRUSOE. a cask, to be hooped. I had a small runlet or two,
as I observed before, but I could never arrive to the
capacity of making one by them, though I spent many
weeks about it; I could neither put in the heads, or
join the staves so true to one another, as to make
them hold water, so I gave that also over.
In the next place, I was at a great loss for can-
dles, so that when it was dark, which was generally
by seven o'clock, I was obliged to go to bed. I re-
membered the lump of bees wax with which I made
candles in my African adventure, but I had none of
that now: the only remedy I had was, that when I
had killed a goat, I saved the tallow, and with a little
dish made of clay, which I baked in the sun, to which
I added a wick of some oakum, I made me a lamp;
and this gave me light, though not a clear steady
light like a candle. In the middle of all my labours.
it happened, that, rummaging my things, I found a
little bag, which, as I hinted before, had been filled
with corn, for the feeding of poultry, not for this veryage, but before, as I suppose, when the ship came
from Lisbon; what little remainder of corn had been
in the bag was all devoured by the rats, and I saw
nothing in the bag but husks and dust; and being
willing to have the bag for some other use (I think it
was to put powder in, when I divided it for fear of
the lightning, or some such purpose), I shook the
husks of corn out of it, on one side of my fortification
under the rock.
It was a little before the great rains, just now men-
tioned, that I threw this stuff away, taking no notice
of any thing, and not so much as remembering that I
had thrown away there; when, about a month after, or
thereabouts, I saw some stalks of something green
shooting up on the ground, which I fancied might be
some plant, I had not seen; but I was surprised, and
perfectly astonished, when, after a little longer time,
I saw about ten or twelve ears come out, which were
perfect green barley, the same as English barley.
It is impossible to express the astonishment and
confusion of my thoughts on this occasion; I had
hitherto acted upon no religious foundation at all;
indeed, I had very few notions of religion in my head,
nor had entertained any sense of any thing that had
befallen me, otherwise than as a chance, or, as we
lightly say, what pleases God; without so much as
inquiring into the end of Providence in these things,
or his order in governing events in the world; but,
after I saw barley grow there, in a climate which I
knew was not proper for corn, and especially that I
knew not how it came there, it startled me strangely,
and I began to suggest that God had miraculously
caused this grain to grow, without any help of seed
sown, and that it was so directly purely for my sus-
tenance in that wild miserable place.
This touched my heart a little, and brought tears
out of my eyes, and I began to bless myself that such
a prodigy of nature should happen upon my account;
and this was the more strange to me, because I saw
near it still, all along by the side of the rock, some
other straggling stalks which proved to be stalks of
rice, and which I knew, because I had seen it grow in
Africa, when I was ashore there.
I not only thought these the pure productions of
Providence for my support, but, not doubting but
that there was more in the place, I went all over that
part of the island where I had been before, peering
m every corner, and under every rock, to see for more
of it, but I could not find any; at last it occurred to
my thoughts that I had shaken the bag of chicken's
meat out in that place, and then the wonder began to
cease; and I must confess, my religious thankfulness
to God's providence began to abate too, upon my dis-
covering that all this was nothing but what was com-
mon, though I ought to have been as thankful for so
strange and unforeseen providence as if it had been
miraculous; for it was really the work of Providence to me, that should appoint that ten or twelve grains
of corn should remain unspoiled (when the rats had
destroyed all the rest), as if it had been dropped from
heaven; as also that I should throw it out in that par-
ticular place, where, it being in the shade of a high
rock, it sprang up immediately; whereas, if I had
thrown it any where else at that time, it had been
burnt up and destroyed.
I carefully saved the ears of this corn, you may
be sure, in their season, which was about the end of
June; and laying up every corn, I resolved to sow
them all again, hoping in time to have some quantity
sufficient to supply me with bread: but it was not
till the fourth year that I would allow myself the
least grain of this corn to eat, and even then but spa-
ringly, for I lost all I sowed the first season by not
observing the proper time, for I sowed just before the
dry season, so that it never came up at all, at least
not as it would have done.
Besides this barley, there were, as above, twenty
or thirty stalks of rice, which I preserved with the
same care, and whose use was of the same kind, or
to the same purpose; viz. to make me bread, or rather
food; for I found ways to cook it up without baking,
though I did that also, after some time. But to re-
turn to my journal.
I worked excessive hard these three or four months
to get my wall done; and the 14th of April I closed
it up, contriving to go into it, not by a door, but over
a wall by a ladder, that there might be no sign on the
outside of my habitation.
April 16.—I finished the ladder, so I went up with
it to the top, and then pulled it up after me, and
let it down on the inside. This was a complete
enclosure to me; for within I had room enough, and
nothing could come at me from without, unless it
could first mount my wall.
The very next day after this wall was finished, I had almost had all my labour overthrown at once, and
myself killed. The case was this: as I was busy in the inside of it, behind my tent, just at the entrance
into my cave, I was terribly frighted with a most
dreadful surprising thing indeed, for all on a sudden,
I found the earth came tumbling down from the roof
of my cave, and from the edge of the hill over my
head, and two of the posts I had set up in the cave
cracked in a frightful manner. I was heartily scared
but thought nothing of what really was the cause,
and, for fear I should be buried in it, I ran forward to my ladder; and, not thinking myself safe there
neither, I got over my wall for fear of the pieces of
the hill, which I expected might roll down upon me.
I was no sooner stepped down upon the firm ground,
but I plainly saw it was a terrible earthquake; for
the ground I stood on shook three times, at about
eight minutes distance, with three such shocks as
would have overturned the strongest building that
could be supposed to have stood upon the earth; and
a great piece of the top of a rock, which stood about
half a mile from me next the sea, fell down with
such a terrible noise as I never heard in all my life.
I perceived also the very sea was put into a violent
motion by it, and I believe the shocks were stronger
under the water than on the island.
I was so amazed with the thing itself, having never
felt the like, or discoursed with any one that had,
that I was like one dead or mangled; and the motion
of the earth made my stomach sick, like one that was
tossed at sea; but the noise of the falling of the rock
awakened me, as it were, and, rousing me from the
stupefied condition I was in, filled me with horror, and
I thought of nothing then but the hill falling upon
my tent, and all my household goods, and burying all
at once; and this sunk my soul within me again.
After the third shock was over, and I felt no
more for some time, I began to take courage.
and yet I had not heart enough to get over my wall
again, for fear of being buried alive; but still sat
upon the ground, greatly cast down, and disconsolate,
not knowing what to do. All this while I had not
the least serious religious thought, nothing but the
common " Lord, have mercy upon me!" and when
it was over, that went away too.
While I sat thus, I found the air overcast, and it
grew cloudy, as if it would rain; and, in less than an
hour, it blew a most dreadful hurricane of wind. The
sea was all on a sudden covered with foam and froth,
the shore was covered with the breach of the water,
the trees were torn up by the roots, and a terrible
storm it was; this held about three hours, and then
began to abate; and then in two hours more it was
calm, and began to rain very hard.
All this while I sat upon the ground, very much
terrified and dejected; when, on a sudden, it came
into my thoughts that these winds and rain, being
the consequence of the earthquake, the earthquake
itself was spent and over, and I might venture into
my cave again. With this thought my spirits began
to revive, and the rain helping also to persuade me,
I went in, and sat me down in my tent, but the rain
was so violent, that my tent was ready to be beaten
down by it, I was forced to go into my cave, though
very much afraid. for fear it should fall on my head.
This violent rain forced me to a new work, viz. to cut
a hole through my new fortification like a sink, to let
the water go out, which would else have filled my
cave. After I had been in my cave some time, and
found still no more shocks of the earthquake follow,) began to be more composed; and now, to support my
spirits, which indeed wanted it very much, I went to
my little store, and took a small sup of rum, which I did very sparingly, knowing I could have no more.
It continued raining all that night, and great part
of the next day, so that I could not stir abroad; but,
my mind being more composed, I began to think
what I had best do; concluding that if the island
was subject to these earthquakes, there would be no
living for me in a cave, but I must consider of building
me a little hut, In an open place, which I might sur-
round with a wall, as I had done here, and so make
myself secure from wild beasts or men, but concluded,
if I staid where I was, I should be buried alive.
With these thoughts, I resolved to move my tent,
from the place where it stood, which was just under
the hanging precipice of the hill, and which, if it
should be shaken again, would certainly fall upon my
tent. And I spent the two next days, being the 19th
and 20th of April, in contriving where and how to
remove my habitation.
The fear of being swallowed up alive made me that
I never slept in quiet; but still, when I looked about,
and saw how every thing was put in order, how plea-
santly concealed I was, and how safe from danger, it
made me very loath to remove.
In the mean time it occurred to me, that it would
require a vast deal of time for me to do this, and that
I must be contented to rim the venture where I was,
till I had formed a camp for myself, and had secured
it so as to remove to it. So, with this resolution, I composed my self for a time, and resolved that I would
go to work, with all speed, to build me a wall with
piles and cables, &c. in a circle as before, and set my
tent up in it when it was finished; but that I would
venture to stay where I was till it was finished, and
fit to remove to. This was.the 21st.
April 22.—The next morning I began to consider of
means to put this resolve in execution; but I was at
a great loss about my tools. I had three large axes,
and abundance of hatchets, but with much chopping
and cutting knotty wood, they were all full of notches,
and dull; and though I had a grindstone, I could not
turn it, and grind my tools too. At length, I con-
trived a wheel, with a string, to turn it with my foot,
that I might have both my hands at liberty. Mote.—
I had not seen any such thing in England, or at least
not to take notice how it was done, though since I have observed, it is very common there. This
machine cost me a full week's work to bring it to
perfection.
April 28,29.—These two whole days I took up in
grinding tools; my machine for turning my grind-
stone performing very well.
April 30.—Having perceived my bread had been
low a great while, I reduced myself to one biscuit
cake a day, which made my heart very heavy.
May 1.—In the morning, looking towards the sea-
side, the tide being low, I saw something lie on the
sea-shore, bigger than ordinary, and it looked like a
cask: when I came to it, I found a small barrel, and
two or three pieces of the wreck of the ship, that
were driven on shore by the hurricane, and looking
towards the wreck itself, I thought it seemed to lie
higher out of the water than it used to do. I ex-
amined the barrel which was driven on shore, and
soon found it was a barrel of gunpowder, but it had
taken water, and the powder was caked as hard as a
stone; however, I rolled it farther on shore for the
present, and went on upon the sands, as near as I could to the wreck of the ship, to look for more.
When I came down to the ship, I found it strangely
removed: the forecastle, which lay before buried in
the sand, was heaved up at least six feet; and the
stern, which was broken to pieces, and parted from
the rest by the force of the sea, soon after I had left
rummaging of her, was tossed, as it were up, and cast
on one side; and the sand was thrown so high on that
side next the stern, that I could now walk quite up
to her when the tide was out. I was surprised with
this at first, but soon concluded it must be done by
the earthquake, and as by this violence the ship was
more broken open than formerly, so many things
came daily on shore, which the sea had loosened, arid
which the winds and water rolled by degrees to land.
This wholly diverted my thoughts from the design
of removing my habitation; I busied myself mightily
that day especially, in searching whether I could get
into the ship; but I found nothing was to be expected
of that kind, for all the inside of the ship was choked
up with sand. However, I resolved to pull every
thing to pieces that I could of the ship, concluding
that every thing I could get from her would be useful.
May 3.—I began with my saw, and cut a piece of
a beam through, which I thought held some of the
upper part, or quarter-deck, together; and when I had cut it through, I cleared away the sand as well
as I could from the side which lay highest, but the
tide coming in, I was obliged to give over.
May 4.—I went a fishing, but caught not one fish
that I durst eat of, till I was weary of my sport, when
just going to leave off, I caught a young dolphin. I had made me a long line of some rope yarn, but I had
no hooks; yet I frequently caught as much fish as
I cared to eat; which I dried in the sun, and eat dry.
May 5.—Worked on the wreck, cut another beam
asunder, and brought three great fir planks off from
the decks, which I tied together, and made swim to
shore when the tide of flood came on.
May 6.—Worked on the wreck, got several iron
bolts out of her, and other pieces of iron work.
May 7.—Went to the wreck again, but with an
intent not to work; but found the weight of the
wreck had broken itself down, the beams being cut,
that several pieces of the ship seemed to lie loose, and
the inside of the hold lay so open, that I could see
into it; but almost full of water and sand.
May 8.—Went to the wreck, and carried an iron
crow to wrench up the deck, which lay now quite
clear of the water or sand. I wrenched open two
planks, and brought them on shore also with the tide.
I left the iron crow in the wreck for next day.
May 9.—Went to the wreck, and with the crow
made way into the body of the wreck, and felt several
casks, and loosened them with the crow; but could
not break them up. I felt also the roll of English
lead, but it was too heavy to move
May 10, 11, 12, 13,Lt.--. Went every day to the"
wreck and got many pieces of timber and boards, or
planks, and two or three hundred weight of iron.
May 15.—I carried two hatchets, to try if I could
not cut a piece off the roll of lead, by placing the edge
of one hatchet, and driving it with the other; but as
it lay about a foot and a half in the water, I could
not make any blow to drive the hatchet.
May 10.—It blew hard in the night, and the wreck
appeared more broken by the force of the water; but
I stayed so long in the woods to get pigeons for food,
that the tide proventedme going to the wreck that day.
May 17.—I saw some pieces of the wreck blown on
shore, at a great distance, two miles off me; but re-
solved to see what they were, and found it was a piece
of the head, but too heavy for me to bring away.
May 24.—Every day, to this day, I worked on the
wreck, and with hard labour I loosened some things
so much with the crow, that the first flowing tide
several casks floated out, and two of the .seamen's
chests; but the wind blowing from the shore, nothing
came to land that day but pieces of timber, and a
hogshead that had some Brazil pork in it, but the
salt water and the sand had spoiled it.
I continued this work every day to the 15th of June,
except the time necessary to get food; and, by this
time, I had gotten timber and plank, and iron work
enough to have built a good boat, if I had known
how; and also I got at several times, and in several
pieces, near one hundred weight of the sheet lead.
June 16.—Going down to the seaside, I found a
large tortoise or turtle; this was the first I had seen,
which, it seems, was only my misfortune, not any
defect of the place, or scarcity; for, had I happened
to be on the other side of the island, I might have
had hundreds of them every day, as I found afterward;
but, perhaps, had paid dear enough for them.
June 17.—I spent in cooking the turtle. I found
in her threescore eggs; and her flesh was to me at
that time the most savoury and pleasant that ever I tasted in my life, having had no flesh but of goats and
fowls, since I landed in this horrible place.
June 18.—Rained all day, and I staid within. The
rain at this time felt cold, and I was something chilly,
which I knew was not usual in that latitude.
June 19.—Very ill, and shivering, as if the weather
had been cold.
June 2(1.—No rest all night; violent pains in my
head, and feverish.
June 21.—Very ill> frighted almost to death with
the apprehensions of my sad condition, to be sick,
and no help. Prayed to God for the first time since
the storm off Hull; but scarce knew what I said, or
why; my thoughts being all confused.
June 22.—A little better; but under dreadful ap-
prehensions of sickness.
June m..--. Very bad again, cold and shivering, and
then a violent headache. June 24.—Much better.
June 25.—An ague very violent; the fit held me
seven hours, cold fit and hot, with faint sweats after it.
June 26.—Better; and having no victuals to eat,
took my gun, but found myself very weak; however,
I killed a she-goat, and, with much difficulty, got it
home, and broiled some, and eat it.
June 27.—The ague again so violent, GU 1 lay
a-bed all day, and neither eat nor drank, I was ready
to perish with thirst, but so weak, I had not strength
to stand up, or get myself any water to drink; prayed
to God again, but was light-headed; and when I was
not, I was so ignorant, that I knew not what to say:
only 1 lay, and cried, "Lord, look upon me! Lord,
pity me! Lord, have mercy upon me!" I suppose
I did nothing else for two or three hours, till the fit
wearing off, I fell asleep, and did not wake till far in
the night. When I waked, I found myself much
refreshed, but weak, and exceedingly thirsty; how-
ever, as I had no water in my whole habitation, I was forced to lie till morning, and went to sleep again.
In this second sleep I had this terrible dream:—
I thought that I was sitting on the ground, on the
outside of my wall, where I sat when the storm blew
after the earthquake, and that I saw a man descend
from a great black cloud, in a bright flame of fire,
and light upon the ground. He was all over as
bright as a flame, so that I could but just bear to look
towards him; his countenance was most inexpressibly
dreadful; impossible for words to describe; when he
stepped upon the ground with kis feet, I thought the
earth trembled, just as it had done before the earth-
quake, and all the air looked, to my apprehension, as
if it had been filled with flashes of fire.
He was no sooner landed upon the earth, but he
moved forward towards me, with a long spear or
weapon in his hand, to kill me; and when he came
to a rising ground, at some distance, he spoke to me,
or I heard a voice so terrible, that it is impossible to
express the terror of it; all that I can say I under-
stood was this :—" Seeing all these things have not
brought thee to repentance, now thou shalt die." At
which words, I thought he lifted up the spear that
was in his hand, to kill me.
No one that shall ever read this account, will ex-
pect that I should be able to describe the horrors of
my soul at this terrible vision; I mean, that even
while it was a dream, I even dreamed of those hor-
rors; nor is it any more possible to describe the
impression that remained upon my mind when I awaked, and found it was but a dream.
I had, alas! no Divine knowledge; what I had re-
ceived by the good instruction of my father, was then
worn out by an uninterrupted series, for eight years,
of seafaring wickedness, and a constant conversation
with none but such as were like myself, wicked and
profane to the last degree. I do not remember that
I had, in all that time, one thought so much as tended
either to looking upwards towards God, or inwards
towards a reflection upon my own ways; but a cer-
tain stupidity of soul, without desire of good, or con-
science of evil, had entirely overwhelmed me, and
I was all that the most hardened, unthinking, wicked
creature among our common sailors can be supposed
to be, not having the least sense either of the fear of
God in dangers, or of thankfulness in deliverance.
In relating what is already past in my story, this
will be more easily believed, when I shall add, that,
through all the variety of miseries that had to this
day befallen me, I never had so much as one thought
of its being the hand of God, or that it was a just
punishment for my past sins, my rebellious behaviour
to my father, or my present sins, which were great; or
so much as a punishment for the general course of
my wicked life. When I was on the desperate ex-
pedition on the desert shores of Africa, I never had
so much as one thought of what would become of
me, or one wish to God to direct me whither I should
go, or to keep me from the danger which apparently
surrounded me, as well from voracious creatures as
cruel savages; but I was merely thoughtless of God,
or a providence; I acted like a mere brute, from the
principles of nature, and by the dictates of common
sense only, and indeed hardly that.
When I was delivered and taken up at sea by the
Portugal captain, well used, and dealt justly and
honourably with, as well as charitably, I had not the
least thankfulness in my thoughts; when,again^ I was
shipwrecked, ruined, and in danger of drowning on
this island, I was as far from remorse on looking on
it as a judgment, I only said to myself often, that I was an unfortunate dog, and born to be miserable.
It is true, when I got on shore first here, and found
all my ship's crew drowned, and myself spared, I was surprised with a kind of ecstacy and some trans-
ports of soul, which, had the grace of God assisted,
might have come up to true thankfulness; but it
ended where it begun, in a mere common flight of joy,
or, as I may say, being glad I was alive, without the.
least reflection upon the distinguishing goodness of
the hand which had preserved me, ana had singled
me out to be preserved, when the rest were destroyed,
or an inquiry why Providence had been thus merciful
to me: even just the same common sort of joy which
seamen generally have, after having got safe ashore
from a shipwreck, which they drown in the next
bowl of punch, and forget almost as soon as it is over.
Even when I was afterward, on due consideration,
made sensible of my condition, how I was cast on
this dreadful place out of the reach of human kind,
out of all hopes of relief, or prospect of redemption,
as soon as I saw a probability of living, and that I should not starve and perish for hunger, all the sense
of my affliction wore off, and I began to be very easy,
applied myself to the works proper for my preser-
vation and supply, and was far enough from being
afflicted at my condition; as a judgment from Heaven
or as the hand of God against me, these thoughts
very seldom entered into my head.
The growing up of the corn, hinted in my journal,
had at first some little influence upon me, and began
to affect me with seriousness, as long as I thought it
had something miraculous in it; but as soon as ever
that part of the thought was removed, all the im-
pression which was raised from it, wore off also.
Even the earthquake, though nothing could be
more terrible in its nature, or more immediately
directing to the invisible power which alone directs
such things, yet no sooner was the first fright over,
but the impression it had made went off also.
But now when I began to be sick, and a leisurely
view of the miseries of death came to place itself
before me; when my spirits began to sink under the
burden of a strong distemper, and nature was ex-
hausted by the violence of the fever; conscience, that
had slept so long, began to awake, and I began to re-
proach myself with my past life.
These reflections oppressed me from the second or
third day of my distemper, and, in the violence as
well of the fever as of the dreadful reproaches of my
conscience, extorted some words from me, like pray-
ing to God, though I cannot say they were either a
prayer attended with desires, or with hopes; it was
rather the voice of mere fright and distress; my
thoughts were confused, the convictions great upon
my mind, and the horror of dying in such a miserable
condition, raised vapours in my head, with the mere
apprehensions; and in these hurries of my soul, I knew not what my tongue might express; but it was
rather ;exclamations, such as " Lord, what a mise-
rable creature am I ? If I should be sick, I shall cer-
tainly die for want of help; and what will become of
me! Then the tears burst out of my eyes, and I could say no more for a good while.
In this interval, the good advice of my father came
to my mind, and presently his prediction, which I mentioned at the beginning of this story; viz. That,
if I did take this foolish step, God would not bless
me, and I would have leisure hereafter to reflect upon
having neglected his counsel, when there might be
none to assist me in my recovery. "Now," said 1,
aloud, "my dear father's words are come to pass;
God's justice has overtaken me, and I have none to
help or hear me. I rejected the voice of Providence,
which had mercifully put me in a posture or station
of life wherein I might have been happy and easy,
but I would neither see it myself, nor learn to know
the blessing of it from my parents; I left them to
mourn over my folly, and now I am left to mourn the
consequences of it. I refused their help and assist-
ance, who would have lifted me into the world, and
would have made every thing easy to me; and now I have difficulties to struggle with, too great for even
nature itself to support, and no assistance, no help,
no comfort, no advice." Then I cried out, " Lord, be
my help, for I am in great distress!"
This was the first prayer, if I might call it so, that
I had made for many years. But to return to my
journal.
June 28.—Having been somewhat refreshed with
the sleep I had had, and the fit being entirely off, I got up, and the fright and terror of my disease was
very great, yet I considered that the fit of the ague
would return the next day; and now was my time to
get something to refresh and support myself when I should be ill; and the first thing I did I filled a large
square ease bottle with water, and set it upon a table
near my bed, and to take off the chill or agueish dis-
position of the water, I put about a quarter of a pint
of rum into it, and mixed them together; then I got
me a piece of the goat's flesh, and broiled it on the
coals, but could eat very little; I walked about, but
was very weak, and withal, very sad and heavy-
hearted in the sense of my miserable condition, and
dreading the return of my distemper the next day;
at night I made my supper of three of the turtle's eggs,
which I roasted in the ashes, and eat, as we call it,
in the shell; and this was the first bit of meat I ever
asked God's blessing to.
After I had eaten, I tried to walk, but found my-
self so weak, that I could hardly carry the gun (for I never went out without that), so I went but a little
way, and sat down upon the ground, looking out upon
the sea, which was just before me, and very calm and
smooth. As I sat, these thoughts occurred to me.
What is this earth and sea, of which I have seen so
much? When is it produced? And what am I , and
all the other creatures, wild and tame, human and
brutal; whence are we?
Sure we are made by some secret power, who formed
the earth and sea, the air and sky; and who is that?
Then it followed most naturally—it is God that has
made it all. Well, but then, it came on strongly—if
God has made these things, he guides and governs
them all, and all things that concern them; for the
being that could make all things, must have power
to guide and direct them.
If so, nothing can happen in the circuit of his works
without his knowledge or appointment.
And if nothing happens without his knowledge, he
knows that I am here, and am in this dreadful con-
dition; and if nothing happens without his appoint-
ment, he has appointed this to befall me.
Nothing occurred to my thoughts to contradict any
of these conclusions j and therefore it rested upon
me with the greater force, that it must needs be, that
God has appointed all this to befall me; that I was
brought to this miserable circumstance by his direc-
tion; he having the sole power, not of me only, but
of every thing that happened in the world. Imme-
diately'it followed—Why has God done this to me?
What have I done to be thus used?
My conscience presently checked me in that in-
quiry, as if I had blasphemed; and, methought it
spoke to me like a voice,—Wretch! dost thou ask
what thou hast done 1 Look back upon thy dreadful
mis-spent life, and ask thyself what thou hast done?
Ask why is it that thou wert not long ago destroyed?
Why wert thou not drowned in Yarmouth Roads?
killed in the fight, when the ship was taken by the
Sallee man of war? devoured by wild beasts on the
coast of Africa? or, drowned here, when all the crew
perished but thyself? Dost thou ask,—What have I done?
I was struck dumb with these reflections, as one
astonished, and had not a word to say in answer to
myself, but rose up, pensive and sad, walked back to
my retreat, and went up over my wall, as if I had
been going to bed; but my thoughts were sadly dis-
turbed, and I had no inclination to sleep, so I sat in
my chair, and lighted my lamp, for it began to be
dark. Now, as the apprehensions of the return of my
distemper terrified me very much, it occurred to my
thought that the Brazilians take no physic but their
o 2
tobacco, for almost all distempers; and I had a piece
of a roll of tobacco in one of the chests, which was
cured, and some also that was green, and not cured.
I went, directed by Heaven, no doubt, for in this
chest I found a cure for soul and body. I opened the
chest, and found what I looked for, viz. the tobacco:
and as the few books I had saved lay there too, I took
out one of the Bibles, which I had mentioned before,
and which, to this time, I had not found leisure, or so
much inclination, to look into; I say I took it out,
and brought both that and the tobacco to the table.
What use to make of the tobacco I knew not, but
I tried several experiments with it, as if I was re-
solved it should hit one way or other. I first took a
piece of a leaf, and chewed it in my mouth, which,
indeed, at "first, stupified my brains; the tobacco
being green and strong, and that I had not been much
used to it; then I took some, and steeped it an hour
or two in rum, and resolved to take a dose of it when
I lay down; and lastly, I burnt some upon a pan of
coals, and held my nose close over the smoke of it.
as long as I could bear it, as well for the heat as for
the virtue of it, and I held it almost to suffocation.
In the interval of this operation, I took up a Bible, and began to read; but my head was too much dis-
turbed with the tobacco, to bear reading, at least at
that time; only, having opened the book casually, the
first words that occurred to me were these, " Call on
me in the day of trouble, and I will deliver thee, and
thou shalt glorify me."
The words were very apt to my case, and made
some impression on me at the time of reading them, .
though not so muchfas they did afterwards; for, as
for being delivered, the word had no sound, as I may
say, to me, the thing was so remote, so impossible in
my apprehension of things, that I began to say as
the children of Israel did, when they were promised
flesh to eat, "Can God spread a table in the wilder-
ness?" So I began to say, Can God Himself deliver
me from this place? But, however, the words made
a great impression upon me, and I mused upon them
very often. It grew now late, and the tobacco had,
as I said, dozed my head so much, that I inclined to
sleep; so I left my lamp burning in the cave, lest I
should want any thing m the night, and went to bed;
but before I lay down, I did what I never had done in
all my life, I kneeled down, and prayed to God to fulfil
the promise to me, that, if I called upon him in the day
of trouble, he would deliver me. After my broken and
imperfect prayer was over, I drank the rum in which
I had steeped the tobacco, which was so strong and
rank of the tobacco, that, indeed, I could scarcely get
it down. Immediately upon this I went to bed, and
I found presently it flew up into my head violently;
but I fell into a sound sleep, and waked no more, till,
by the sun, it must necessarily be near three o'clock
in the afternoon, the next day; nay, to this hour, I
am partly of opinion that I slept all the next day and
night, and till almost three the day after, for other-
wise I knew not how I should lose a day out of my
reckoning in the days of the week, as it appeared,
some years after, I had done; for if I had lost it by
crossing and recrossing the line, I should have lost
more than one day; but certainly, I lost a day in my
account, and I never knew which way.
Be that, however, one way or the other, when I awaked I found myself exceedingly refreshed, and
my spirits lively and cheerful. When I got up I was
stronger than I was the day before, and my stomach
better, for I was hungry, and, in short, I had no fit
the next day, but continued much altered for the
better. This was the 29th.
The 30th was my well day, of course, and I went
abroad with my gun, but did not care to travel too
far. I killed a sea-fowl or two, something like a
brand goose, and brought them home, but was not
very forward to eat them, so I eat some more of the
turtle's eggs, which were very good. This evening I renewed the medicine, which I had supposed did me
good the day before, viz. the tobacco steeped in rum,
only I did not take so much as before, nor did I chew
any of the leaf, or hold my head over the smoke.
However, I was not so well the next day, which was
the 1st of July.
July 2.—1' renewed the medicine all the three
ways, and dosed myself with it as at first, and doubled
the quantity which I drank.
July 3.-—I missed the fit for good and all, though I
did not recover my full strength for some weeks after.
While I was thus gathering strength, my thoughts
ran exceedingly upon this passage in Scripture, "I will deliver thee," and the impossibility of my deli-
verance lay upon my mind, in bar of my ever expecting
it. But as I was discouraging myself with such
thoughts, it occurred to my mind, that I pored so
much upon my deliverance from the main affliction,
that I disregarded the deliverance I had received;
and I was, as it were, made to ask myself such
questions as these, viz. Have I not been delivered,
and wonderfully too, from sickness; from the most
distressed condition that could be, and that was so
frightful to me? And what notice had I taken of it?
Had I done my part? God had delivered me; but
I had not glorified him! that is to say, I had not
owned and been thankful for that as a deliverance;
and how could I expect greater deliverance. This
touched my heart very much, and immediately I kneeled down, and gave God thanks aloud, for my
recovery from sickness.
July 4.—In the morning, I took the Bible', and
beginning at the New Testament, I began seriously
to read it, and imposed upon myself to read a while
every morning and every night, not tying myself to
a number of chapters, but as long as my thoughts
should engage me. It was not long after I set seri-
ously to this work, but I found my heart more deeply
and sincerely affected with the sins of my past life.
The impression of my dream revived, and the words
"All these things have not brought thee to repent-
ance," ran seriously in my thoughts. I was earnestly
begging of God to give me repentance, when it hap-
pened providentially, the very day, that, reading the
Scriptures, I came to the words, "He is exalted a
Prince and a Saviour, to give repentance, and to give
remission." I threw down the book, and, with my
heart as well as my hands lifted up to Heaven, in a
kind of ecstasy of joy, I cried out aloud, " Jesus, thou
Son of David, Jesus, thou exalted Prince and Saviour,
give me repentance!"
This was the first time that I could say, in the
true sense of the word, that I prayed in all my life.
for now I prayed with a sense of my condition, and
with a true Scripture view of hope, founded on the
encouragement of the word of God; and from this
time, I may say, I began to have hope that God
would hear me.
Now I began to construe the words mentioned
above, "Calf on me, and I will deliver thee," in a
different sense from what I had ever done before:
for then I had no notion of any thing being called
deliverance, but my being delivered from the captivity
I was in; for though, indeed, I was at large in the
place, yet the island was certainly a prison to me,
and that in the fullest sense of the word; but now I
learned to take it in another sense. Now, I looked
back on my past life with such horror, and my sins
appeared so dreadful, that my soul sought nothing
of God but deliverance from the load of guilt that
bore down all my comfort. As for my solitary life
it was nothing; I did not so much as pray to be de-
livered from it, or think of it; it was all of no con-
sideration in comparison of this ; and I add this part
here, to hint to whoever shall read it, that whenever
they come to a true sense of things, they will find
deliverance from sin a much greater blessing than
deliverance from affliction.
But, leaving this part, I return to my journal.
My condition began to be, though not less mise-
rable as to my way of living, yet much easier to my
mind, and my thoughts being directed, by a constant
reading of the Scriptures, and praying to God, to
things of a higher nature, I had a great deal of com-
fort within, which till now I knew nothing of. Also,
as my health and strength returned, I began to furnish
myself with every thing that I wanted, and make my
way of living as regular as I could.
From the 4th of July to the 14th, I was chiefly
employed with walking about with my gun in my
hand, a little at a time, as a man that was gathering
up his strength after a fit of sickness, for it is hardly
to be imagined how low I was, and to what weakness
I was reduced. The application I made use of was
perfectly new, and perhaps what had never cured an
ague before, neither can I recommend the experiment,
for it left me very weak, with frequent convulsions
in my nerves and limbs for some time.
I had now been in this unhappy island above ten
months; all possibility of deliverance from it seemed
to be entirely taken away from me; and I firmly be-
lieve that no human shape had ever set foot upon the
place. Having secured my habitation, as I thought,
fully to my mind, I had a desire to make a more
perfect discovery of the island, and see what other
productions I might find, which I yet knew not of.
It was on the 15th of July that I began to take a
more particular survey of the island. I went up the
creek first, where I had brought my rafts on shore.
I found, after going about two miles up, that the
tide did not flow any higher, and that it was no more
than a little brook of running water, and very fresh
and good; but this being the dry season, there was
scarcely any water in some parts of it.
On the banks of this brook I found many pleasant
savannahs or meadows, plain, smooth, and covered
with grass, and on the rising parts of them, next to
the higher grounds, where the water, as it might be
supposed, never overflowed, I found a great deal of
tobacco, green, and growing to a great and strong
stalk. There were divers other plants, which I did
not understand, and might, perhaps, have virtues of
their own, which I could not find out.
I searched for the cassava root, which the Indians,
in all that climate, make their bread of, but I could
find none. I saw large plants of aloes, but'did
not then understand them. I saw several sugar
canes, but wild, and, for want of cultivation, imper-
fect. I contented myself with these discoveries for
this time, and came back, musing with myself what
course I might take to know the virtues and goodness
of any of the fruits or plants which I should discover,
but could bring it to no conclusion ; for, in short,
I made so little observation while I was in the Brasils,
that I knew little of the plants of the field.
The next day, the Kith, I went up the same way
again; and, after going something farther than I had
gone the day before, I found the brook and the sa-
vannahs began to cease, and the country became more
woody than before. In this part I found different
fruits, and particularly melons, upon the ground, in
great abundance, and grapes upon the trees; the
vines had spread over the trees, and the clusters of
grapes were now in their prime, very ripe and rich.
This was a surprising discovery, and I was exceeding
glad of them; but I was warned, by my experience,
to eat sparingly of them, remembering that when I
was ashore in Barbary, the eating of grapes killed
several of our Englishmen, who were slaves there, by
throwing them into fluxes and fevers: but I found
an excellent use for these grapes; and that was to
cure or dry them in the sun, and keep them as dried
grapes or raisins are kept, which I thought would be,
as indeed they were, as wholesome, and as agreeable
to eat, when no grapes might be had.
I spent all that evening there, and went not back
to my habitation, which was the first night, 03 I
might say, I had lain from home. In the night I got
up into a tree, where I slept well, and the next morn-
ing proceeded upon my discovery, travelling near
four miles, keeping still due north, with a ridge of
hills on the south and north side of me. %
At the end of this march, I came to an opening.
where the country seemed to descend to the west,
and a little spring of fresh water, which issued out
of the side of the hill by me, ran the other way, that
is, due east; and the country appeared so fresh, so
green, and so flourishing, that it looked like a garden.
I descended a little on the side of that delicious
valley, surveying it with a secret kind of pleasure
(though mixed with other afflicting thoughts,) to
think that this was all my own ; and if I could con-
vey it, I might have it in inheritance, as completely
as any lord of the manor in England. I saw here
abundance of cocoa-trees, orange, lemon, and citron
trees, but all wild, and few bearing fruit. However,
the green limes that I gathered were not only plea-
sant to eat, but very wholesome; and I mixed their
juice afterwards with water, which made it very
wholesome, and very cool and refreshing. I now
resolved to carry home, and lay up a store of grapes,
limes, and lemons, to furnish myself for the wet
season, which I knew was approaching.
In order to do this, I gathered a great heap of
grapes in one place, and a lesser heap in another, and
a great parcel of limes and lemons in another place;
and, taking a few of each with me, I travelled home-
ward, and resolved to come again, and bring a bag or
sack, or what I could make, to carry them home.
Accordingly, having spent three days in this jour-
ney, I came home; but before I got thither, the
grapes were spoiled; the richness of the fruit, and
the weight of the juice, having broken and bruised
them, they were good for little or nothing; as. to the
limes, but I could bring a few.
The next day, being the 19th, I went back, having
made me two small bags to bring home my harvest;
but I was surprised, when, coming to my heap of
grapes, I found them all spread abroad, trod to
pieces, and dragged about, some here, some there,
and abundance eaten and devoured. By this I con-
cluded there were some wild creatures thereabouts
who had done this, but what they were I knew not.
However, as I found there was no laying them up
on heaps, and no carrying them away in a sack, I
took another course; for I gathered a large quantity
of grapes, and hung them upon the out-branches of
the trees, that they might cure and dry in the sun;
and as for the limes and lemons, I carried as many
back as I could well stand under.
When I came home from this journey, I contem-
plated, with great pleasure, the fruitfmness of that
valley, and the pleasantness of the situation; and
concluded that I had pitched upon a place to fix my
abode, which was by far the worst part of the country.
Upon the whole, I began to consider of removing my
habitation, and to lookout for a place equally safe as where I now was situate, if possible, in that plea-
sant, fruitful part of the island.
This thought ran long in my head, and I was ex-
ceeding fond of it for some time, the pleasantness of
the place tempting me; but when I came to a nearer
view of it, and to consider that I was now by the
seaside, where it was at least possible that some-
thing might happen to my advantage, and that the
same ill fate that brought me hither might bring
some unhappy wretches to the same place; and
though it was scarce probable that any such thing
should ever happen, yet, to enclose my self among the
hills and woods, in the centre of the island, was to
anticipate my bondage, "and to render such an affair
not only improbable, but impossible, and that there-
fore I ought not by any means to remove.
However; I was so enamoured with this place,
that I spent much of my time there for the whole
remaining part of the month of July ; and though,
upon second thoughts, I resolved not to remove, yet
I built a little kind of bower, and surrounded it at a
distance with a strong fence, being a double hedge,
as high as I could reach, well staked, and filled be-
tween with brushwood; and here I lay secure, some-
times two or three nights together, always going over
it with a ladder, as before, so that I fancied now I
had my country-house and my sea-coast house; and
this work took me up to the beginning of August.
I had but newly finished my fence, and began to
enjoy my labour, when the rains came on, and made
me stick close to my first habitation; for though I
had made me a tent, like the other, with a piece of a
sail, and spread it very well, yet I had not the shelter
of a hill to keep me from storms, nor a cave behind
me to retreat into, when the rains were extraordinary.
About the beginning of August, as I said, I had
finished my bower, and began to enjoy myself. The
3rd of August I found the grapes I had hung up
were perfectly dried; so I began to take them down
from the trees, and it was very happy that I did so,
for the rains which followed would have spoiled
them. No sooner had I taken them all down, and
carried them home to my cave, but it began to rain;
and from hence, which was the 14th of August, it
rained more or less every day till the middle of Octo-
ber, and sometimes so violently that I could not stir
out of my cave for several days.
In this season I was much surprised with the in-
crease of my family. I had been concerned for the
loss of one of my cats, who ran away from me, or, as
I thought, had been dead; and I heard no more of
her, till, to my astonishment, she came home about
the end of August with three kittens. This was the
more strange to me, because, though I had killed a
wild cat, as I called it, with my gun, yet I thought
it was quite a different kind from our European cats;
yet the young cats were the same kind of house-
bred, like the old one; and both my cats beingfemales,
I thought it very strange. But from these three cats
I afterwards came to be so pestered with cats, that I
was forced to kill them like vermin, or wild beasts,
and to drive them from my house as much as
possible.
From the 14th of August to the 26th, incessant
rain, so that I could not stir, and was now very care-
ful not to get wet. In this confinement I began to
be straitened for food; but venturing out twice, I one
day killed a goat; and the last day, which was the
26th, found a very large tortoise, which was a treat
to me; and my food was regulated thus: I eat a
bunch of raisins for my breakfast; a piece of goat's
flesh, or of the turtle for my dinner; and two of the
turtle's eggs for supper.
During this confinement in my cover by the rain,
I worked daily two or three hours at enlarging my
cave; and, by degrees, worked it on towards one side,
till I came to the outside of the hill, and made a door,
or way out, which came beyond my fence or wall,
and so I came in and out this way. But I was not
perfectly easy at lying so open; for, as I had managed
myself before, I was in a perfect enclosure, whereas
now I thought I lay exposed; and yet I could not
perceive that there was any living thing to fear, the
biggest creature that I had yet seen being a goat.
September 30th.—I was now come to the unhappy
anniversary of my landing. I cast up the notches on
my post, and found I had been on shore three hun-
dred and sixty-five days. I kept this day as a solemn
fast, setting it apart to religious exercise, prostrating
myself on the ground with the most serious humili-
ation, confessing my sins to God, acknowledging his
righteous judgments upon me, and praying to him to
have mercy on me, through Jesus Christ; and having
not tasted the least refreshment for twelve hours, even
till the going down of the sun, I then eat a biscuit
cake and a bunch of grapes, and went to bed, finish-
ing the day as I began it.
I had all thistimeobserved no Sabbath day; for as at
first I had no sense of religion upon my mind, I had for
some time omitted to distinguish the weeks by cutting
a longer notch than ordinary for the Sabbath day,
and so did not know what any of the days were; but
now having cast up the days as above, I found I had
been there a year, so I divided it into weeks, and set
apartcvery seventh day for a Sabbath, though I found
at the end of my account I had lost a day or two.
A little after this, my ink began to fail me, and so
I contented myself to use it more sparingly, and to
write down only the most remarkable events of my
life, without making a memorandum of other things.
The rainy season, and the dry season, began now
to appear regular to me, and I learned to divide them
so as to provide for them accordingly. But I bought
my experience before I had it; and this I am going to
relate was one of the most discouraging experiments
that I made at all. I have mentioned that I had
saved the few ears of barley and rice, which I had
so surprisingly found spring up, as I thought, of
themselves, and believe there were about thirty stalks
of rice, and about twenty of barley; and now I thought
it a proper time to sow after the rains, the sun being
in its southern position going from me.
Accordingly, I dug up a piece of ground as well
as I could with my wooden spade, and dividing it
into two parts, I sowed my grain; but as I was sow-
ing, it casually occurred to my thoughts that I would
not sow it all at first, because I did not know when
was the proper time for it, so I sowed about two-
thirds of the seed, leaving about a handful of each.
It was a great comfort to me afterwards, that I did
so, for not one grain of that I sowed this time came
to any thing; for the dry months following, the earth
having had no rain after the seed was sown, it had no
moisture to assist its growth, and it never came up at
all, till the wet season had come again, and then it grew as if it had been but newly sown. '
Finding my first seed did not grow, which I easily
imagined was by the drought, I sought for a moister
piece of ground to make another trial in; and I dug
up a piece of ground near my new bower, and sowed
the rest of my seed in February, a little before the
vernal equinox; and this, having the rainy months of
March and April to water it, sprung up very plea-
santly, and yielded a very good crop: but having
part of the seed left only, and not daring to sow afl
that I had yet, I had but a small quantity at last, my
whole crop not amounting to above half a peck.
But, by this experiment, I was made master of my
business, and knew exactly the time to sow, that I
might expect two seed-times and harvests every year.
While this corn was growing I made a little dis-
covery, which was of use to me afterwards. As soon
as the rains were over, and the weather began to
settle, which was the month of November, I made a
visit up the country to my bower, where, though I
had not been some months, yet I found all things
just as I left them. The circle or double hedge that
I had made was not only firm and entire, but the
stakes, which I had cut off some trees that grew
thereabouts, were all shot out, and grown with long
branches, as much as a willow tree usually shoots the
first year after lopping its head. I could not tell
what tree to call it that these stakes were cut from.
I was surprised, and yet very well pleased, to see the
young trees grow; and I pruned them, and led them
up to grow as much alike as I could; and it is scarce
credible how beautiful a figure they grew into in three
years, so that though the hedge made a circle of about
twenty-five yards in diameter, yet the trees, for such
I might now call them, soon covered it, and it was a
shade, sufficient to lodge under all the dry season.
This made me resolve to cut some more stakes, and
make me a hedge like this, in a semicircle round my
wall,^ mean that of my first dwelling, which I did;
and, placing the trees or stakes in a double row, at
about eight yards distance from my first fence, they
grew, and were, at first, a fine cover to my habitation.
and afterwards served for a defence also, as I shall
observe in its order.
I found now that the seasons of the year might
generally be divided, not into summer and winter, as
m Europe, but into rainy seasons and dry seasons,
which were generally thus :—
Half February, March, half April—Rainy, the sun
being then or near the equinox.
Half April, May, June, half August—Dry, the sun
being then to the north of the line.
Half August, September, half October—Rainy, the
sun being then come back.
Half October, November, December, January, half
February—Dry, the sun being to the south of the line.
The rainy season sometimes held longer or shorter,
as the winds happened to blow ; this was the general
observation I made. After I had found, by experience,
the ill consequence of being abroad in the rain, I took
care to furnish myself with provisions beforehand, that I might not be obliged to go out; and I sat in
doors as much as possible during the wet months.
At this time I tried many ways to make myself a
basket, but all the twigs I could get for the purpose
proved so brittle, that they would do nothing. It
? roved of excellent advantage to me now; that when
was a boy, I used to take great delight m standing
at a basket-maker's in the town where I lived, to
see them make their wicker ware; and being, as boys
usually are, very officious to help, and a great ob-
server of the manner how they worked these things,
and sometimes lending a hand, I had, by this means,
so full a knowledge of their methods, that I wanted
nothing but the materials; when it came into my
mind, that the twigs of that tree, from whence I cut
my stakes that grew, might possibly be as tough as
the sallows, and willows, and osiers in England, and I
resolved to try. Accordingly, the next day I went
to my country house, as I called it, and cutting some
of the smaller twigs, I found them to my purpose as
much as I could desire; whereupon I came the next
time prepared with a hatchet to cut down a quantity
which I soon found, for there was a great plenty of
them. These I set to dry within my circle or hedge,
and when they were fit for use, I carried them to my
cave; and here, during the next season, I employed
myself in making, as well as I could, a great many
baskets. both to carry earth, or to lay up any thing,
as I had occasion; and thus, afterwards, I took care
never to be without them: and, as my wicker ware
decayed, I made more; especially I made strong deep
baskets to place my corn in, instead of sacks, when
I should come to have any quantity of it.
Having mastered this difficulty, and employed a
world of time about it, I bestirred myself to see, if
possible, how to supply two wants. I had no vessels
to hold any thing that was liquid, except two runlets
which were almost full of rum, and some glass bot-
tles, some of the common size, and others which were
case bottles, square, for the holding of water, spirits,
&c. I had not so much as a pot to boil any thing in,
except a great kettle, which I saved out of the ship,
and which was too big for the uses I desired it for,
viz. to make broth, and stew a bit of meat by itself.
The next thing I would fain have had was a tobacco-
Eipe; but it was impossible for me to make one;
owever, I found a contrivance for that too at last.
I mentioned before that I had a great mind to see
the whole island, and that I travelled up the brook,
and so on to where I had built my bower, and where
I had an opening quite to the sea, on the other side
of the island. now resolved to travel quite across
to the sea-shore on that side; so taking my gun, a
hatchet, and my dog, and a larger quantity of powder
and shot than usual, with two biscuit cakes. and a
great bunch of raisins in my pouch, for my store, I
Began my journey. When I had passed the vale
where my bower stood, as above, I came in view of
the sea, to the west; and it being a very clear day, I fairly descried land, whether an island or a continent
I could not tell; but it lay very high, extending from
the west to the W. S. W. at a great distance; by my
guess it was fifteen or twenty leagues off.
I could not tell what part of the world this might
be, otherwise than that I knew it must be part of
America; and, as I concluded by all my observations,
must be near the Spanish dominions, and perhaps
was all inhabited by savages, where, if I should have
landed, I had been in a worse condition than I was
now; and therefore I acquiesced in the disposition of
Providence, which I began to own, and to believe,
ordered every thing for the best.
Besides, I considered, that if this land was the
Spanish coast, I should certainly one time or other
see some vessels pass or repass one way or other; but
if not, then it was a savage coast between the Spanish
country and Brazils, who were indeed the worst of
savages, for they were cannibals, or men-eaters, and
devour all the human bodies that fall into their hands.
With these considerations I walked very leisurely
forward. I found that side of the island where I now
was, much pleasanter than mine, the open or savan-
nah fields sweet, adorned with flowers and grius,
and full of very fine woods. I saw abundance of
parrots, and fain would have caught one, if possible,
to have kept it to be tame, and taught it to speak to
me. I did after some painstaking catch a young
parrot, for I knocked it down with a stick, and I took
it home, but it was some years before I could make
him speak to me. However, at last I taught him to
call me by my name very familiarly.
I was exceedingly diverted with this journey. I found in the low grounds, hares, as I thought them
to be, and foxes, but they differed greatly from all
the other kinds I had met with; nor could I satisfy
myself to eat them, though I killed several. But I
had no need to be venturous, for I had no want of
food, and of that which was very good too, especially
these three sorts, viz. goats, pigeons, and turtle or
tortoise, which, added to my grapes, Leadenhall
market could not have furnished a table better than
I could, in proportion to the company.
I never travelled in this journey above two miles in
a day, or thereabouts; but I took so many turns and
returns, to see what discoveries I could make, that I
came weary enough to the place where I resolved to
sit down for all night; and then I either reposed
myself in a tree, or surrounded myself with a row of
stakes set upright in the ground, either from one tree
to another, or so as no wild creature could come at
me without waking me.
As soon as I came to the sea shore, I was surprised
to see that I had taken up my lot on the worst side
of the island, for here indeed the shore was covered
with innumerable turtles, whereas on the other side
I had found but three in a year and a half. Here
was also an infinite number of fowls, of many kinds,
some of which I had seen, and some of which I had
not seen before, and many of them very good meat, but
I knew not their names, except those called penguins.
I could have shot as many as I pleased, but was
very sparing of my powder and shot, and therefore
had more mind to kill a she-goat, if I could, which
I could better feed on. And though there were many
goats here more than on my side of the island, yet it
was with much more difficulty that I could come
near them, the country being flat and even, and they
saw me much sooner than when I was on the hills.
I confess this side of the country was much plea-
santer than mine, but vet I had not the least inclina-
tion to remove; and I seemed all the while I was
here to be, as it were, upon a journey, and from home.
However, I travelled along the shore of the sea,
H 2
towards the east, I suppose, about twelve miles; and
then setting up a great pole upon the shore for a
mark, I concluded to go home again; and that the
next journey I took should be on the other side of the
island, east from my dwelling, and so round till I
came to my post again.
I took another way to come back than that I went,
thinking I could easily keep all the island so much
in my view, that I could not miss finding my first
dwelling, by viewing the country: but found myself
mistaken; for being come about two or three miles,
I found myself descended into a very large valley,
but so surrounded with hills, and those hills covered
with woods, that I could not see which was my way
by any direction but that of the sun, nor even then,
unless I knew very well the position of the sun at
that time of the day.
It happened, unfortunately, that the weather proved
hazy for three or four days, while I was in this valley;
and not being able to see the sun I wandered about
very uncomfortably, and at last was obliged to find
out the sea-side, look for my post, and come back the
same way I went; and then, by easy journeys, I
turned homeward, the weather being exceeding hot;
and my gun, ammunition, hatchet, and other things,
very heavy.
In this journey my dog surprised a young kid, and
seized upon it; and I running to take hold of it,
caught it, and saved it alive from the dog. I had a
great mind to bring it home, if I could; for I was
very anxious to raise a breed of tame goats, which
might supply me when my powder and shot should
be all spent. I made a collar to this little creature,
and with a string which I made of some rope-yarn,
which I always carried about me, I led him along,
though with some difficulty, till I came to my bower,
and there I enclosed him, and left him; for I was
very impatient to be at home, from whence I had
been absent above a month.
I cannot express what a satisfaction it was to me
to come into my old abode, and lie down in my ham-
mock-bed. This little wandering journey, without
any settled habitation, had been unpleasant to me,
so that my own house, as I called it, was a perfect
settlement, compared to that; and it rendered every
thing about me so comfortable, that I resolved I
would never go a great way from it again, while it
should be my lot to stay on the island.
I reposed myself here a week, to rest and regale
myself after my long journey, during which, most of
the time was taken up in the weighty affair of making
a cage for my poll, who began now to be a mere do-
mestic, and to be very well acquainted with me.
Then I began to think of the poor kid, which I had
pent in within my little circle, and resolved to go and
fetch it home, or give it some food; accordingly I
went, and found it where I left it, for indeed it could
not get out, but was almost starved for want of food.
I went and cut boughs of trees, and branches of such
shrubs as I could find, and threw them over, and
having fed it, I tied it as I did before, to lead it
away, but it was so tame with being hungry, that I
had no need to have tied it, for it followed me like a
dog - and became, from that time, one of my domestics
also, and would never leave me afterwards.
The rainy season of the autumnal equinox was now
come, and I kept the 30th of September in the same
solemn manner as before, being the anniversary of
my landing on the island, having now been there two
years, and no more prospect of being delivered than
the first day I came there. I spent the whole day
in humble and thankful acknowledments of the many
wonderful mercies which my solitary condition was
attended with, and without which it might have been
infinitely more miserable. I gave humble and hearty
thanks that God had been pleased to discover to me,
even that it was possible I might be more happy in
this solitary condition, than I should have been in
118 ROBINSON CRUSOE. an thn pleasures of the world; that he could folly
make up to me the deficiencies of my solitary state,
and the want of human society, by his presence, and
the communications of his grace to my soul, support-
ing, comforting, and encouraging me to depend upon
his providence here, and hope for his eternal pre-
sence hereafter.
It was now that I began sensibly to feel how much
more happy the life I now led was, with all its mise-
rable circumstances, than the wicked, cursed, abomi-
nable life I led all the past part of my days; having
changed both my sorrows and my joys, from what
they were at my first coming, or indeed for the two
years past.
Before, as I walked about, either on my hunting,
or for viewing the country, the anguish of my soul
at my condition would break out upon me on a sudden,
and my very heart would die within me, to think or
the woods, the mountains, the deserts I was in; and
how I was a prisoner locked up with the eternal
bars and bolts of the ocean, in an uninhabited wilder-
nees, without redemption. In the midst of the
greatest composures of my mind, this would break
out upon me, like a storm, and make me wring my
hands, and weep like a child. Sometimes it would
take me in the middle of my work, and I would im-
mediately sit down and sigh, and look upon the
ground for an hour or two together, and this was
still worse to me; for if I could burst out into tears,
or vent myself by words, it would go off, and the
grief, having exhausted itself, would abate.
But now I began to exercise myself with new
thoughts. I daily read the word of God, and applied
all the comforts of it to my present state. I never
opened the Bible, or shut it, but my very soul within
me blessed God for directing my friend in England,
without any order of mine, to pack it up among my
goods, and for assisting me afterwards to save it out
of the wreck of the ship.
Thus, and in this disposition of mind, I began my
third year; having regularly divided my time accord Ing to the several daily employments that were before
me: such as, first, my duty to God, and reading the
Scriptures, which I constantly set apart for some
time, thrice every day. secondly, the going abroad
with my gun for food, which generally took me up three hours every morning, when it "did not rain.
Thirdly, the ordering, curing, preserving, and cook-
ing, what I had killed or catched for my supply;
these took up great part of the day. Also, in the
middle of the day, when the sun was in its zenith,
the violence of the heat was too great to stir out, so
that about four hours in the evening was all the time
I could be supposed to work in; with this exception,
that sometimes I changed my hours of hunting and
working, and went to work in the morning, and
abroad with my gun in the afternoon.
To this short time allowed for labour, may be added
the exceeding laboriousness of my work; the many
hours, which, for want of tools, want of help, and
want of skill, every thing that I did took up out of
my time. For example, I was full two-and-forty
days making me a board for a long shelf, which I
wanted in my cave, whereas, two sawyers, with their
tools and a saw-pit, would have cut six of them, out
of the same tree in half a day.
My case was this; it was to be a large tree which
was to be cut down, because my board was to be a
broad one. This tree I was three days in cutting
down, and two more cutting off the boughs, and re-
ducing it to a log or piece of timber. With inexpres-
sible hacking and hewing, I reduced both sides of it
into chips, till it began to be light enough to move;
then I turned it, and made one side of it smooth and
flat as a board, from end to end, then turning that
side downward, cut the other side, till I brought the
plank to be about three inches thick, and smooth on
both sides. Any one may judge the reason why BO
much of my time went away with so little work,
viz. that what might be a little to be done with help
and tools, was a vast labour, and required a prodigious
time to do alone, and by hand.
I was now in the months of November and Decem-
ber, expecting my crop of barley and rice. The
ground I had manured or dug up for them was not
great, for, as I observed, my seed of each was not
above the quantity of half a peek, for I had lost one
whole crop by sowing in the dry season, but now my
crop promised very well, when, on a sudden, I found
I was in danger of losing it all again by enemies of
several sorts, which it was scarce possible to keep
from it; at first, the goats and wild creatures which
I called hares, who, tasting the sweetness of the
blade, lay in it night and day, as soon as it came up,
and eat it so close, that it could get no time to shoot
up into stalk. This I saw no remedy for but by
making an enclosure about it with a hedge, which I
did with a great deal of toil, and the more as it re-
quired speed, the creatures daily spoiling my corn.
However, as my arable land was but small, suited to
my crop, I got it totally well fenced in about three
weeks' time; and shooting some of the creatures in
the day time, I set my dog to guard it in the night,
tying^ him up to a stake at the gate, where he would
stand and bark all night long; so, in a little time,
the enemies forsook the place, and the corn grew very
strong and well, and began to ripen apace.
But as the beasts injured me before, while my corn
was in the blade, so the birds were likely to injure me now, when it was in the ear; for, going along by
the place to see how it throve, I saw my little crop
surrounded with fowls, of I know not how many
sorts, who stood, as it were, watching till I should be
gone. I immediately let fly among them; and I had
no sooner shot, but there rose up a little cloud of
fowls, which I had not seen, from amongst the corn.
This touched me sensibly, for I foresaw that, In a
few days they would devour all my hopes; that I
should be starved, and never be able to raise a crop
at all, and what to do I could not tell. In the first
place, I went among it to see what damage was
already done, and found they had spoiled a good deal
of it; but that, as it was yet too green for them, the
loss was not so great, but that the remainder was
like to be a good crop, if it could be saved.
I staid by it to load my gun, and then coming
away, I could easily see the thieves sitting upon the
trees about me, as if they only waited till I was gone
away; and the event proved it to be so: for as I
walked off as if I was gone, I was no sooner out of
their sight, but they dropped down, one by one, into
the cor n again. I was so provoked that I had not
patience to stay till more came, knowing that every
grain that they eat now, was, as it might be said, a
peck- loaf to me in the consequence; but coming up
to the hedge, I fired again, and killed three of them.
This was what I wished for: so I took them up, and
served them as we serve notorious thieves in England,
viz. hanged them in chains as a terror to others. It
is impossible to imagine almost that this should have
such an effect as it had; for the birds would not only
not come at the corn, but, in short, they forsook all
that part of the island, and I could never see a bird
near the place as long as my scarecrows hung there.
This I was very glad of; and, about the latter end
of December, which was our second harvest of the
year, I reaped my crop. I was sadly put to it for a
scythe or sickle, to cut it down, and all I could do
was to make one as well as I could, out of one of the
broad-swords, or cutlasses, which I saved among the
arms out of the ship. However, as my crop was but
small, I had no great difficulty to cut it down. In
short, I reaped it in my way, for I cut nothing off
but the ears, and carried it away in a great basket
which I had made, and so rubbed it out with my
At the end of all my harvesting, I found that
f
out of my half-peck of seed, I had near two bushels of
rice, and above two bushels and a half of barley;
that is to say, by my guess, for I had no measure.
However, this was a great encouragent to me, and I foresaw that in time it would please God to supply
me with bread. And yet here I was perplexed again,
for I neither knew how to grind or make meal of my
corn, or, indeed, how to clean it, and part it; nor, if
made into meal, how to make bread of it; and if how
to make it, yet I knew not how to bake it. These
things being added to my desire for having a good
'quantity for store, and to secure a constant supply,
resolved not to taste any of this crop, but to pre-
serve it all for seed against the next season, and, in
the mean time, to employ all my study and hours of
working to accomplish this great work of providing
myself with corn and bread.
It might be truly said, that now I worked for my
bread. It is wonderful what a strange multitude of
little things are necessary in the providing, producing
dressing, and finishing this one articls-of bread.
I, that was reduced to a mere state of nature, found
this to be my daily discouragement, and was made
more and more sensible of it every hour, even after I
had got the first handful of seed corn, which, as I
have said, came up unexpectedly, and to my surprise.
First, I had no plough to turn the earth, no spade
or shovel to dig it. Well, this I conquered by making
a wooden spade, as I observed before; but this did
my work but in a wooden manner; and though it cost
me a great many days to make it, yet for want of iron
it not only wore out the sooner^ but made my work
the harder, and made it be performed much worse.
However, this I bore with, and was content to work
it out with patience, and bear with the badness of the
performance. When the corn was sown, I had no
harrow, but was forced to go over it myself, and drag
a great heavy bough of a tree over it, to scratch the
earth, as it may be called, rather than harrow it.
IWBIJTS0N CB.USOB. - 123
When It was growing and grown, I have observed
already how many things I wanted, to fence it, secure
it, mow or reap it, cure and carry it home, thresh,
part it from the chaff, and save it. Then I wanted a
mill to grind it, sieves to dress it, yeast and salt to
make it into bread, and an oven to bake it in; and
yet these things I did without, as shall be observed.
All this, as I said, made every thing laborious and
tedious to me, but that there was no help for; neither
was my time so much loss to me, because as I had
divided it, a certain part of it was every day ap-
pointed to these works; and, as I resolved to use none
of the corn for bread, till I had a great quantity by
me, I had the next six months to apply myself1, by
labour and invention, to furnish myself with utensils
proper for the performing all the operations necessary
for making the corn, when I had it fit for my use.
But first, I had to prepare more land, for I had now
seed enough to sow above an acre of ground. Before
I did this, I had a week's work, at least, to make me
a spade, which, when it was done, was but a sorry
one indeed, and very heavy, and required double la-
bour to work with it. However, I went through
that, and sowed my seed in two large fiat pieces of
ground, as near my house as I could find them to my
mind, and fenced them in with a good hedge, the
stakes of which were all cut of that wood which I set
before, which I knew would grow; so that, in one
year's time, I knew I should -have a quick or living
hedge, that would want but little repair. This work
took me up three months, but part of that time was
of the wet season, when I could not go abroad.
Within doors, while I was at work, I diverted my-
self with talking to my parrot, and teaching him to
speak; and I quickly learned him to know his own
name, at last to speak it pretty loud, "Poll;" which
was the first word I ever heard spoken in the island
by any mouth but my own. This, therefore was not
my work, but an assistant to my work; for now, I
124 ROBINSON CRUSOE. had a great employment upon my hands, as follows,
viz. I had long studied, by some means or other, to
make myself some earthen vessels, which indeed I
wanted sorely, but knew not where to come at them.
However, considering the heat of the climate, I did
not doubt but, if I could find out any such clay, I
might botch up some pot, as might, being dried in
the sun, be hard enough, and strong enough, to bear
handling, and to hold any thing that was dry, and
required to be kept so; and as this was necessary in
preparing corn, meal, &c. which was the thing I was
upon, I resolved to make some as large as I could, to
stand like jars to hold what should be put in them:
It would make the reader pity me, or rather laugh
at me, to tell how many awkward ways I took to
raise this paste: what odd, mis-shapen. ugly things
I made; how many of them fell in, and how many
fell out, the clay not being stiff enough to bear its own weight; how many cracked by the over-violent
heat of Sie sun, being set out too hastily; and how
many fell to pieces with only removing, as well before
as after they were dried; and, in a word, how, after
having laboured hard to find the clay, to dig it, to
temper it, to bring it home, to work it, I could not
make above two large, earthen, ugly things, I cannot
call them jars, in about two months' labour.
However, as the sun baked these two very dry and
hard, I lifted them very gently up, and set them down
in two great wicker-baskets, which I had made on
purpose for them, that they might not break; and as
between the pot and the basket there was a little
room to spare; and these two pots, being to stand
always dry, I thought they would hold my dry corn,
and perhaps the meal when the corn was bruised.
Though I miscarried so much in my design for large
pots, yet I made several smaller things with better
success; such as little round pots, flat dishes, pitchers, and pipkimi, and any thing my hand turned to, and
tin1 hcut of the fin i baked them extremely hard.
But all this would not answer my end, which was
to get an earthen pot to hold what was liquid, and
bear the fire, which none of these could do. It hap-
pened after some time, making a large fire for cook-
mg my meat, when I put it out, after I had done
with it, I found a broken piece of one of my earthen-
ware vessels in the fire, burnt as hard as a stone, and
red as a tile. I was agreeably surprised to see it,
and said to myself, that certainly they might be made
to burn whole, if they would burn broken.
This set me to study how to order my fire, so as to
make it burn me some pots. I had no notion of a
kiln, such as the potters burn in, or of glazing them
with lead, though I had some lead to do it with; but
I placed three large pipkins, and two or three pots,
in a pile upon one another, and placed my fire-wood
all round it with a great heap of embers under them.
I plied the fire with fresh fuel round the outside, and
upon the top, till I saw the pots in the inside red hot
quite through, and observed that they did not crack
at all. When I saw them clear red, I let them stand
in that heat five or six hours, till I found one of
them, though it did not crack, did melt or run; for
the sand which was mixed with the clay melted by
the violence of the heat, and would have run into
glass if I had gone on; so I slackened my fire gradu-
ally, till the pots began to abate of the red colour,
and watching them all night, that I might not let
the fire abate too fast, in the morning I had three
very good, I will not say handsome, pipkins, and two
other earthen pots, as hard burnt as could be desired;
and one of them perfectly glazed with the running
of the sand.
After this experiment, I need not say that I wanted
no sort of earthenware for my use; but I must needs
say, as to the shapes of them, they were very indif-
ferent. No joy at a thing of so mean a nature was
ever equal to mine, when I found I had made an
earthen pot that would bear the fire; and 1 had
120 ROBINSON CRUSOE. hardly patience to stay till they were cold, before I
set one upon the fire again, with some water in it, to
boil me some meat, which it did admirably well;
and, with a piece of kid, I made some very good
broth, though I wanted oatmeal, and several other
ingredients requisite to make it as good as I would
have had it.
My next concern was to get me a stone mortar to
stamp or beat some corn in; for as to the mill, there
was no thought of arriving to that perfection of art,
with one pair of hands. To supply this want I was
at a great loss ; for, of all the trades in the world, I
was as perfectly unqualified for a stone-cutter, as for
any whatever; neither had I any tools to go about
it with. I spent many a day to find out a great
stone big enough to cut hollow, and make fit for a
mortar, and could find none at all, except what was
in the solid rock, and which I had no way to dig or
cut out, nor indeed were the rocks in the island of
hardness sufficient, but were of a sandy crumbling
stone, which would neither bear the weight of a
heavy pestle, nor would break the corn without
filling it with sand. So, after a great deal of time
lost in searching for a stone, I gave it over, and re-
solved to look out a great block of hard wood, which
I found indeed much easier; and getting one as big
as I had strength to stir, I rounded it, and formed it
on the outside with my axe and hatchet, and then,
with the heln of fire, and infinite labour, made a
hollow place in it, as the Indians in Brazil make
their canoes. After this I made a great heavy pestle
or beater, of the wood called the iron-wood, and this
I prepared and laid by against I had my next crop of
corn, when I proposed to myself to grind, or rather
pound, my corn into meal, to make my bread.
My next difficulty was to make a sieve to dress
my meal, and to part it from the bran and the husks,
without which I did not see it possible I could have
any bread. This was a most difficult task; for I had
nothing like the necessary thing to make it with, I
mean fine thin canvas, or stuff to sift the meal
through. And here I was at a full stop for many
months; nor did I really know what to do, linen I
had none left, but what was mere rags.' I had goat's
hair, but neither knew how to weave or spin it; and
had I known how, here were no tools to work it with;
all the remedy that I found for this was, that at last
I did remember I had, among the seamen's clothes,
which were saved out of the ship, some neckcloths
of calico or muslin^ and with some pieces of these I
made three small sieves.
The baking part was the next thing to be thought
6f, and how I should make bread when I came to
have corn; for, first, I had no yeast. As to that
part, as there was no supplying the want, so I did
not concern myself much about it; but for an oven
I was indeed in great pain. At length I found an
expedient for that also, which was this:—I made
some earthen vessels very broad, but not deep, that
is to say, about two feet in diameter, and not above
nine inches deep; these I burnt in the fire, as I had
done the other. and laid them by, and when I wanted
to bake, I made a great fire upon my hearth, which
I paved with some square tiles, of my own making
and burning also.
When the fire-wood was burnt pretty much into
embers, for live coals, I drew them forward upon this
hearth, so as to cover it all over, end there I let them
lie, till the hearth was very hot; then sweeping away
all the embers, I set down my loaf or loaves, and,
whelming down the earthen pot upon them, drew the
embers all round the outside of the pot, to keep in
fmd add to the heat; and thus, as well as in the best
oven in the world, I baked my barley loaves, and
became, in a little time, a pastry-cook into the bar-
gain, having made myself several cakes of the rice.
It need not be wondered at, if all these things took
up most of the third year of my abode here; for it is
to be observed, that in the interval of these things,
my new harvest and husbandry had to be managed,
for I reaped my corn in its season, carried it home,
and laid it up in the ear, in my large baskets, till an
opportunity occurred to rub it out; having no floor
to thresh it on, or instrument to thresh it with.
And now, indeed, my stock of corn increasing, it became necessary to build my barns - bigger. Being
in want of a place to lay it up, for the increase of
corn now yielded me so much, that I had of barley
about twenty bushels, and as much or more of rice;
insomuch that I now resolved to use it freely, for my
bread had been quite gone a great while; being re-
solved to see what quantity would be sufficient for
me for a whole year, and to sow but once a year.
Upon the whole, finding that the forty bushels of
barley and rice were much more than I could con-
sume in a year; so I resolved to sow just the same
quantity every year as the last.
During the time that these things were doing,
my thoughts ran many times upon the prospect of
land, which I had seen from the other side of the
island; and was not without secret wishes to get on
shore, fancying that seeing the main land, and an
inhabited country, I might find someway or other to
convey myself farther, and at last might escape.
But all this while I made no allowance for the
dangers of such a condition, and how I might fall into
the hands of savages, and perhaps such as would be
far worse than the lions and tigers of Africa; that if
I once came into their power, there would be the
hazard of more than a thousand to one of being killed,
and perhaps of being eaten; for I knew that the peo-
ple of the Caribbean coasts were cannibals, or men-
eaters ; and I knew by the latitude that I could not
be far off from that shore; that, suppose they were
not cannibals, yet they might kill me, as many Euro-
peans who had fallen into their hands had been served
even when they had been ten or twenty together,
much more me that was only one. All these things,
I ought to have considered well of, and did cast up in
my thoughts afterwards, yet took up none of my ap-
prehensions at first; and my head ran mightily upon
the thought of getting over to that shore.
Now I wished for my boy Xury, and the long-boat,
with the shoulder-of-mutton sail, with which we sailed
above a thousand miles on the coast of Africa, but
this was in vain. Then I went to look at our ship's
boat, which was blown up upon the shore a great way
in the storm, when we were first cast away. It lay
almost where it did at first, but not quite, and was
turned by the force of the waves and the winds,
almost bottom upwards, againsta high ridge of beachy
rough sand, but no water about it as before.
Had I had hands to have refitted it, and to have
launched it into the water, the boat would have
done well enough to have taken me back into the
Brazils; but I might have easily foreseen that I could
no more turn it, and set it upright upon its bot-
tom, than I could remove the island. However, I went to the woods and cut levers and rollers, and
brought them to the boat, resolved to try what could
be done, suggesting to myself, that if it could be turned
down, the damage it had received might easily be
repaired, and it would be a very good boat, and I might go to sea in it very easily.
I spared no pains indeed in this piece of fruitless
toil, and spent, I think, three or four weeks about it;
at last, finding it impossible to heave it up with my
little strength, I fell to digging away the sand to un-
dermine it, and so to make it fall down? setting pieces
of wood to thrust and guide it in the fall.
But when I had done this, I was unable to stir it
up again, or to get under it, much less to move it for-
ward towards the water, so I was forced to give it
over; and yet my desire to venture over for the main
increased, rather than decreased, as the means for it
seemed impossible. This at length set me upon
I
thinking whether it was not possible to make my-
self a canoe, or periagua, such as the natives of those
climates make; even without tools, or, as I might
say, without hands, viz. of the trunk of a great tree.
This I not only thought possible, but easy; but not
at all considering the inconveniences which I lay
under more than the Indians did, viz. want of hands
to move it into the water, when it was made, a diffi-
culty much harder for me to surmount than all the
consequences of want of tools could be to them; for
what was it to me, that when I had chosen a vast
tree in the woods, I might with great trouble cut it
down, if after I should be able with my tools to hew
and dub the outside into the proper shape of a boat,
and burn or cut out the inside to make it hollow, so
as to make a boat of it; if, after all this. I must leave
it where I found it, and was not able to launch it into
the water?
One would have thought I could not have had the
least reflection upon my mind of my circumstance
while I was making this boat, but I should have im-
mediately thought how I should get it into the sea;
but my thoughts were so intent upon my voyage over
the sea in it, that I never once thought how I should
get it off the land; and it was more easy for me to
guide it over 45 miles of sea than about 45 fathoms
of land, where it lay, to set it afloat in the water.
I went to work upon this boat the most like a fool
that ever man did who had any of his senses awake.
I pleased myself with the design, without determining
whether I was ever able to undertake it; not but
that the difficulty of launching my boat came often
into my head; but I put a stop to my own inquiries
into it by this foolish answer which I gave myself—
"Let me firstmake it, I'll warrant I'll find someway
or other to get it along, when it is done."
This was a most preposterous method; but the
eagerness of my fancy prevailed, and to work I went,
w«d felled a cedar-tree. I question much whether
Solomon ever had such a one for the building the
temple at Jerusalem; it was five feet ten inches
diameter at the lower part next the stump, and four
feet eleven inches diameter at the end of twenty-two
feet; after which it lessened for a while, and then
parted into branches. It was not without infinite
labour that I felled this tree. I was twenty days
hacking and hewing at it at the bottom; I was four-
teen more getting the branches and limbs, and the
vast spreading head of it cut off, which I hacked and
hewed through with my axe and hatchet, with inex-
pressible labour. After this it cost me a month to
shape it, and dub it to a proportion, and to something
like the bottom of a boat, that it might swim upright
as it ought to do. It cost me near three months
more to clear the inside, and work it out so as to
make an exact boat of it. This I did indeed without
fire, by mere mallet and chisel, and by the dint of
hard labour, till I had brought it to be a very hand-
some periagua, and big enough to have carried six-
and-twenty men, and consequently big enough to
have carried me and all my cargo.
When I had gone through this work, I was ex-
tremely delighted with it. The boat was really
bigger than ever I saw a canoe, or periagua, that
was made of one tree, in my life; and there remained
nothing but to get it into the water. But all my
devices to get it there failed, though they cost me
infinite labour: the boat lay about one hundred yards
from the water, and not more; but the first inconve-
nience was, it was up-hill towards the creek. Well,
to take away this discoiiragement, I resolved to dig
into the surface of the earth, and so make a declivity.
This I began, and it cost me a prodigious deal of
pains, but who grudge pains that have deliverance
in view? When this was worked through, I could
no more stir the canoe than I could the other boat.
Then I measured the distance of ground, and re-
solved to cut a dock or canal, to bring the water up
I 2
to the canoe, seeing I could not bring the canoe down
to the water. Well, I began this work, and when I began to enter it, and calculated how deep it was to
be dug, how broad, how the stuff was to be thrown
out, I found that, by the number of hands I had,
being none but my own, it must have been ten or
twelve years before I should have gone through with
it; for the shore lay high, so that at the upper end
it must have been at least twenty feet deep; so at
length, though with great reluctancy, I gave this attempt over also.
This grieved me heartily; and now I saw, though
too late, the folly of beginning a work before we
count the cost, and before we judge rightly of our
own strength to go through with it.
In the middle of this work I finished my fourth
year in this place, and kept my anniversary with the
same devotion, and with as much comfort as ever
before; for by a constant study, and serious applica-
tion of the word of God, and by the assistance of his
grace, I gained a different knowledge from what I had
before. I looked now upon the world as a thing re-
mote, which I had nothing to do with, no expectation
from, and indeed no desires about; so 1 thought it
looked, as we may perhaps look upon it hereafter,
viz. as a place I had lived in, but was come out of it.
In the first place, I was removed from all the
wickedness of the world here. I had neither the
"lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye, nor the pride
of life." I had nothing to covet, for I had all I was
now capable of enjoying: I was lord of the whole
manor, or, if I pleased, I might call myself king or
emperor over the whole country which I had pos-
session of. There were no rivals. I had no compe-
titor; none to dispute sovereignty or command with
me. I might have raised ship-loadings of corn, but
I had no use for it, so I let as little grow as I thought
enough for my occasion. I had tortoises or turtles
plenty, but now and then one was as much as I could
put to any use. I had timber enough to have built
a fleet of ships. I had grapes enough to have made
wine, or to have cured into raisins, to have loaded
that fleet when they had been built. I had, as I hinted before, a parcel of money, as well gold as
silver, above thirty-six pounds sterling. Alas! there
the nasty, sorry, useless stuff lay; I had no manner
of business for it; and I often thought within myself,
that I would have given a handful of it for a gross of
tobacco-pipes, or for a hand-mill to grind my corn;
nay, I would have given it all for sixpenny-worth of
turnip and carrot seed out of England, or for a handful
of peas and beans, and a bottle of ink. As it was, I had not the least advantage by it, or benefit from it,
but there it lay in a drawer, and grew monldv with
the damp of the cave in the wet season; and if I had
had the drawer full of diamonds, it had been the
same case, and they had been of no manner of value
to me, because of no use.
I had now been here so long, that many things
which I brought on shore for my help were either
quite gone, or very much wasted, and near spent.
My ink, as I observed, had been quite gone for
some time, all but a very little, which I eked out
with water a little and a little, till it was so pale it
scarce left any appearance of black upon the paper.
As long as it lasted, I made use of it to minute down
the day of the month on which any remarkable thing
happened to me: and first, by casting up times past,
I remember that there was a strange concurrence of
days in the various providences which befel me, and
which, if I had been superstitiously inclined to ob-
serve days as fatal or fortunate, I might have had
reason to have looked upon with a deal of curiosity.
First, I had observed that the same day that I broke
away from my father and my friends, and ran away
to Hull, in order to go to sea, the same day after-
wards I was taken by the Sallee man of war, and
made a slave. The same day of the year that I
escaped out of the wreck of the ship In Yarmouth
Roads, that same day of the year afterwards I made
my escape from Sallee in the boat. The same day of
the year I was born in, viz. the :30th of September,
the same day I had my life so miraculously saved
twenty-six years after, when I was cast on shore on
this island, so that my wicked life and solitary life
began both on a day.
The next thing to my ink being finished was that
of my bread, I mean the biscuit which I had brought
out of the ship. This I had husbanded to the last
degree, allowing myself but one cake of bread a day
for above a year; and yet I was quite without bread
for near a year before I got any corn of my own; and
great reason I had to be thankful that I had any at
all, the getting it being, as has been already observed,
next to miraculous.
My clothes, too, began to decay mightily. As to
linen, I had had none for a good while, except some
check shirts which I found in the chests of the other
seamen, and which I carefully preserved, because
many times I could bear no other clothes on but a
shirt; and it was a very great help to me that I had,
among all the men's clothes of the ship, almost three
dozen of shirts. There were also several thick watch-
coats of the seamen, which were left indeed, but they
were too hot to wear; and although the weather was
so violent hot, that there was no need of clothes, yet
I could not go quite naked, though I was all alone.
One reason why I could not go quite naked was,
I could not bear the heat of the sun so well when
in that state, as with some clothes on, nay, the very
heat frequently blistered my skin; whereas, with a
shirt on, the air itself made some motion, and whist-
ling under the shirt, was twofold cooler than without
it. No more could I ever bring myself to go out in
the heat of the sun without a cap or a hat, the heat'
of the sun beating with such violence as it does in
that place, would give me the headache presently,
by darting so directly on my head, without a cap or
a hat on, so that I could not bear it; whereas, if I
put on my hat, it would presently go away.
Upon these views I began to consider about putting
the few rags I had, which I called clothes, into some
order. I had worn out all the waistcoats I had, and
my business was now to try if I could not make
jackets out of the great watch-coats which I had by
me, and with such other materials as I had; so I set
to work a tailoring, or rather indeed a botching, for
I made most piteous work of it. However, I made
shift to make- two or three new waistcoats, which I hoped would serve me a great while; as for breeches
or drawers, I made but very sorry shift indeed, till
afterwards.
I have mentioned that I saved the skins of all the
creatures that I killed, I mean the four-footed ones,
and hung them up stretched out with sticks in the
sun, by which means some of them were so dry and
hard, that they were fit for little, but others were
very useful. The first thing I made of these was a
great cap for my head, with the hair on the outside
to shoot off the rain; and this I performed so well,
that, after this, I made me a suit of clothes wholly
of those skins; that is to say, a waistcoat and
breeches. open at knees, and both loose; for they
were rather wanting to keep me cool, than to keep me
warm. I must not omit to acknowledge, that they
were wretchedly made; for if I was a bad carpenter,
I was a worse tailor.
After this I spent a great deal of time and pains to
make me an umbrella: I was indeed in great want
of one, and had a great mind to make one. I had
seen them made in the Brazils, where they are very
useful in the great heats which are there, and I felt
the heats as great here, and greater too. being nearer
the equinox; besides, as I was obliged to be much
abroad, it was a most useful thing to me, as well for
the rains as the heats. I was a great while before I ISO ROBINSON CRUSOE. could make anything likely to hold: nay, after I thought I had hit the way, I spoiled two or three
before I had made one to my mind; but at last I made one that answered indifferently well. The
main difficulty I found was to make it let down. I
could make it to spread, but if it did not let down
too, and draw in, it would not be portable for me any
way but just over my head, which would not do.
However, at last I made one to answer. I covered
it with skins, the hair upwards, so that it cast off
the rain like tt penthouse, and kept off the sun so
effectually, that I could walk out in the hottest of
the weather, with greater advantage than I could
before in the coolest; and when I had no need of it,
I could close it. and carry it under my arm.
Thus I lived very comfortably, my mind being
entirely composed, by resigning to the will of God,
and throwing myself wholly upon the disposal of his
providence. This made my life better than sociable;
for when I began to regret the want of conversation,
I would ask myself whether thus conversing mutually
with my own thoughts, and, as I hope I may say,
even my Maker, by ejaculations and petitions, was
not better than the utmost enjoyment of human
society in the world?
I cannot say that after this, for five years, any ex-
traordinary thing happened to me, but I lived on in
the same course, and in the same posture and place,
just as before. The chief things I was employed in,
besides my yearly labour of planting my barley and
rice, and curing my raisins, of both of which I always
kept up just enough to have sufficient stock of one
year's provisions beforehand; I say, besides this yearly labour. and my daily labour of going out with
my gun, I had another task to make me a canoe, which at last I finished. So that by digging a canal
to it six feet wide, and four feet deep, Ibrought it
into the creek almost haf a mile. As for the first, that was so vastly big, as not being able to bring it
to the water, or bring the water to it, I was obliged
to let it lie where it was, as a memorandum to teach
me to be wiser next time. The making of this latter
boat, and the canal, took me up nearly two years.
However, though my little periagna was finished,
yet the size of it was "not at all answerable to the
design which I had in view when I made the first, I
mean of venturing over to the terra firma, where it
was above forty miles broad; accordingly, the small ness of my boat assisted to put an end to that design,
and now I thought no more of it. But as I had a
boat, my next design was to make a tour round the
island; for as I had been on the other side in one
8lace, crossing, as I have already described it, over
le land, so the discoveries I made in that journey
made me very eager to see other parts of the coast.
For this purpose, and that I might do every thing
with discretion and consideration, I fitted up a little
mast to my boat, and made a sail to it out of some of
the pieces'of the ship's sails, which lay in store, and
of which I had a great stock by me.
Having fitted my mast and sail, and tried the boat,
I found she would sail very well. Then I made little
lockers or boxes at either end, to put provisions,
necessaries, and ammunition, &c. into, to be kept
dry, either from rain, or the spray of the sea, and a
hollow place I cut in the inside of the boat where I
could lay my gun, making a flap to hang down over
to keep it dry.
I fixed my umbrella also in a step at the stern, like
a mast, to stand over my head, and keep the heat of
the sun off me, like an awning; and thus I every now
and then took a little voyage upon the sea, but never
went far out, nor far from the little creek; but at
last, being eager to view the circumference of my
little kingdom, I resolved upon my tour, and accord-
ingly I victualled my ship for the voyage, putting in
two dozen of my loaves of barley bread, an earthen
pot full of parched rice, a food I eat a great deal of,
138 ROBINSON CRUSOE. a little bottle of rum, half a goat, and powder and
shot for killing more, and two large watch-coats, of
those which, as I mentioned before, I had saved out
of the seamen's chests; these I took, one to lie upon,
and the other to cover me in the night.
It was the 6th of November, in the sixth year of
my reign, or my captivity, that I set out on this
voyage, and I found it much longer than I expected;
for though the island itself was not very large, yet
when I came to the east side of it, I found a great
ledge of rocks lie out above two leagues into the sea,
some above water, some under it; and beyond that a
shoal of sand, lying dry, half a league more, so that I
was obliged to go a great way out to sea to double that
point. When I first discovered them, I was going to
give over my enterprise, and come back, not knowing
how far it might oblige me to go out to sea, and, above
all, doubting how I should get back again; so I came
to anchor, for I had made me a kind of anchor, with
8 piece of grappling, which I got out of the ship.
Having secured my boat, I took my gun, ana went
on shore, climbing upon a hill, which seemed to over-
look that point, where I saw the full extent of it, and
resolved to venture. In viewing the sea from that
hill where I stood, I perceived a strong and furious
current, which ran to the east, and even came close
to the point, and I took the more notice of it, because
I saw there might be some danger, that when I came
into it, I might be carried out to sea by the strength
of it, and not be able to make the island again. And
indeed, had I not gotten first upon this hill, I believe
it would have been so, for there was the same current
upon the other side of the island, only that it set off
at a farther distance, and I saw there was a strong
eddy under the shore, so that I had nothing to do but
to get in out of the first current, and I should pre-
sently be in an eddy.
I lay here, however, two days, because the wind,
blowing pretty fresh (at E.S. K. and that being just
contrary to the said current), made a breach of the
sea upon the point; so that it was not safe for me to
keep too close to the shore, for the breach, nor to go
too far off because of the stream.
The third day in the morning, the wind having
abated over night, the sea was calm, and I ventured;
but no sooner was I come to the point, when even I
was not my boat's length from the shore, but I found
myself in a great depth of water, and a current like
the sluice of a mill. It carried my boat along with
it with such violence, that all I could do, could not
keep her as much as on the edge of it; but I found
it hurried me farther out from "the eddy, which was
on the left hand. There was no wind stirring to help
me, and all that I could do with my paddles signified
nothing; and now I began to give myself over for
lost; for, as the current was on both sides of the
island, I knew in a few leagues distance they must
join again, and then I was irrecoverably gone, nor
did I see any possibility of avoiding it: so that I
had no prospect before me but of perishing, not by
the sea, for that was calm enough, but of starving
for hunger. I had indeed found a tortoise on the
shore, as big almost as I could lift, and had tossed it
into the boat; and I had a great jar of fresh water,
but what was all this to being driven into the vast
ocean, where there was no shore, no main land or
island, for a thousand leagues, at least?
And now I saw how easy it was for the providence
of God to make the most miserable condition that
one might think he was in, worse. Now I looked
upon my desolate solitary island as the most pleasant
place in the world; and all the happiness my heart
could wish for, was to be but there again. I stretched
out my hand to it with eager wishes. "O happy
desert," said I, "I shall never see thee more! O
miserable creature," said I, "whither am I going?"
Then I reproached myself with my xmthankful tem-
per, and how I had repined at my solitary condition,
and now what would I give to be on shore there
again? Thus we never see the true state of our con-
dition, till it is illustrated to us by its contraries; nor
know how to value what we enjoy, but by the want
of it. It is scarce possible to imagine the consterna-
tion I was now in, being driven from my beloved
island into the wide ocean, almost two leagues, and
in the utmost despair of ever recovering it again.
However, I worked hard, till indeed my strength
was almost exhausted, and kept my boat as much to
the northward, that is, towards the side of the cur-
rent which the eddy lay on, as possibly I could.
When about noon, as the sun passed the meridian, I thought I felt a little breeze of wind in my face,
springing from the S. S. E. This cheered my heart
a little, and especially when in about half an hour
more it blew a pretty small gentle gale. By this
time I was gotten at a frightful distance from the
island, and had the least cloud or hazy weather in-
tervened, I had been undone another way too; for I
had no compass on board, and should never have
known how to have steered towards the island, if I had but once lost sight of it; but the weather con-
tinuing clear, I applied myself to get up my mast
again, and spread my sail, standing away to the
north as much as possible, to get out of the current.
Just as I had set my mast and sail, and the boat
began to stretch away, I saw, even by the clearness
of the water, some alteration in the current was near,
for where the current was so strong, the water was
foul; but perceiving the water clear, I found the
current abate, and presently I found to the east, at
about half a mile, a breach of the sea upon some
rocks; these rocks I found caused the current to
part again, and as the main stress of it ran away
more southerly, leaving the rocks to the north-east,
so the other returned by the repulse of thejrpcks, and
made a strong eddy, which ran back again to tho
north-west, with a very sharp stream.
They who know what it is to have a reprieve
brought to them upon the ladder, or to be rescued
from the thieves just going to murder them, or who
have been in such like extremities, may guess what
my present surprise was. and how gladly I put my
boat into the stream of this eddy, and the wind also
freshening, how gladly I spread my sail to it, running
cheerfully before the wind, and with a strong tide or
eddy under foot. This eddy carried me about a
league in my way back again, directly towards the
island, but about two leagues more to the northward
than the current lay, which carried me away at first;
so that when I came near the island, I found myself
open to the northern shore of it, that is to say, the
other end of the island, opposite to that which I went
out from. When I had made something more than a
league of way, by the help of this current or eddy, I
found it was spent, and served me no farther. How-
ever, I found that being between the two great cur-
rents, viz. that on the south side, which had hurried
me away, and that on the north, which lay about
two leagues on the other side; I say, between these
two, in the west of the island, I found the water at
least still, and running no way; and having still a
breeze of wind fair for me, I kept on steering directly
for the island, though not making such fresh way as
I did before.
About four o'clock in the evening, being then within
about a league of the island, I found the point of the
rocks which had occasioned this disaster stretching
out, as is described before, to the southward, and
casting off the current more southwardly, had, of
course, made another eddy to the north: and this I found very strong, but not directly setting the way
the course lay, which was due west, but almost full
north. However, having a fresh gale, I stretched
across this eddy, slanting north-west, and in about
half an hour came within a mile of the shore, where,
it being smooth water, I soon got to land.
When I was on shore, I fell on my knees and gave
God thanks for my escape, resolving to lay aside all
thoughts of my deliverance by my boat; and re-
freshing myself with such things as I had, I brought
my boat close to the shore, in a little cove that I had
spied under some trees, and laid me down to sleep,
being nearly spent with the labour and fatigue of the
voyage.
I was now at a great loss which way to get home
with my boat. I had run so much hazard, and knew
too much the case, to think of attempting it by the
way I went out; and what might be at the other
side (I mean the west side), I knew not, nor had I any mind to run any more ventures; So I only re-
solved in the morning to make my way westward
along the shore, and see if there was no creek, where
I might lay up my frigate in safety, so as to have
her again, if I wanted her. In about three miles,
coasting along the shore, I came to a very good
inlet, or bay, about a mile over, which narrowed till
it came to a very little rivulet or brook, where I found a convenient harbour for my boat, and where
she lay as if she had been in a little dock made on
purpose for her: here I put in, and having stowed
my boat very safe, I went on shore to look about me,
and see where I was.
I soon found I had but a little passed by the place
where I had been before, when I travelled on foot to
that shore; so taking nothing out of my boat, but
my gun and my umbrella, for it was exceedingly hot,
I began my march. The way was comfortable
enough after such a voyage as I had been upon, and
I reached my old bower in the evening, where I
found every thing standing as I left it.
I got over the fence, and laid me down in the shade
to rest my limbs; for I was very weary, and fell
asleep. But judge what surprise I must be in, when
I was awaked out of my sleep, by a voice calling me
by my name several times, " Robin, Robin, Robin
Crusoe! poor Robin Crusoe! Where are you, Robin
Crusoe? Where are you? Where have you been 1"
I was so dead asleep at first, being fatigued with
rowing, or paddling as it is called, the first part of
the day, and with walking the latter part, that
I did not awake thoroughly, and dozing, between
sleeping and waking, thought that I dreamed that
somebody spoke to me. But as the voice continued
to repeat " Robin Crusoe! Robin Crusoe!" at last I began to awake more perfectly, and was at first
dreadfully frighted, and started up in the utmost
consternation. But no sooner were my eyes open,
but I saw my poll sitting on the top of a hedge, and
immediately knew it was he that spoke to me; for
just in such bemoaning language I used to talk to
him. and teach him: and he had learned it so per-
fectly, that he would sit upon my finger, and lay his
bill close to my face, and cry, " Poor Robin Crusoe!
Where are you? Where have you been? How came
you here?" and such things as I taught him.
However, even though I knew it was the parrot, it
was a good while before I could compose myself. I was first amazed how the creature got thither, and
how he should just keep about the place, and no
where else. But as I was well satisfied it could be
nobody but honest poll, I got over it; and holding
out my hand, and calling him by his name, " Poll,
the sociable creature came to me, and sat upon my
thumb, as he used to do, and continued talking to me
"Poor Robin Crusoe!" and how did I come here, and
where had I been, just as if he had been overjoyed
to see me again; and so I carried him home with me.
I had now had enough of rambling to sea for some
time, and had enough to do for many days to sit still
and reflect upon the danger I had been in. I would
have been very glad to have my boat again on my
side of the^ island; but I knew not how it was prac-
ticable to get it about. As to the east side of the
island, which I had gone round, I knew well enough
there was no venturing that way; my very heart
would shrink, and my very blood run chill, but to
think of it. And as to the other side of the island,
I did not know how it might be there; but supposing
the current ran with the same force against the shore
at the east, as it passed by it on the other, I might run
the same risk of being driven down the stream, and
carried by the island, as I had been before of being
carried away from it; so with these thoughts I con-
tented myself to be without any boat.
In this government of my temper I remained near
a year, lived a very retired life, and my thoughts being
very much composed as to my condition, and fully
comforted in resigning myself to the dispositions of
Providence, I thought I lived very happily in all
things, except that of society.
I improved myself in this time in all the mechanic
exercises which my necessities put me upon applying
myself to; and, I believe, could, upon occasion, have
made a good carpenter, considering what tools I had.
Besides this, I arrived at an unexpected perfection
in my earthenware, and contrived well enough to
make them with a wheel, which I found infinitely
easier and better, because I made things round and
shapeable, which before were filthy things indeed to
look on. But I think I never was more vain of my
own performance, or more joyful for any thing I found
out, than for my being able to make a tobacco-pipe,
and though it was a very ugly, clumsy thing, when
it was done, and only burnt red like other earthen-
ware, yet, as it was hard and firm, and would draw
the smoke, I was exceedingly comforted with it; for
I had been always used to smoke, and there were
pipes in the ship, but I forgot them at first, not know-
mg that there was tobacco in the island, and after-
wards, when I searched the ship again, I could not
come at any pipes at all. f
\ n my wicker-ware 1 also improved very much, and
made abundance of necessary baskets, as well as my
invention showed me, though not very handsome, yet
they were such as were very handy and convenient
for my laying things up in. or fetching things home
in. For example, if I killed a goat abroad, I could
hang it up in a tree, flay it, and dress it, and cut it
in pieces, and bring it home in a basket; the like by
a turtle, I could cut it up, take out the eggs, and a
piece or two of the flesh, which was enough for me,
and bring them home and leave the rest behind me.
I began now to perceive my powder abated con-
siderably, and this was a want which it was impos-
sible for me to supply, and I began seriously to con-
sider what I must do when-1 should have no more
powder; that is to say, how should do to kill any
goats. I had, as I observed in the third year of my
being here, kept a young kid, and bred Jier up tame.
I was in hopes of getting a he-kid: but I could not
by any means bring it to pass, till my kid grew an
old goat, and I could never find in my heart to kill
her, till she died at last of mere age.
Being now in the eleventh year of my residence,
and as I have said, my ammunition growing low, I set myself to study some art to trap and snare the
goats, to see whether I could not catch some of them
alive, and I wanted a-she-goat great with young.
To this purpose I made snares to hamper them,
and I do believe they were more than once taken in
them, but my tackle was not good, for I had no wire,
so I found them broken, and my bait devoured.
At length I resolved to try a pit-fall; so I dug
several large pits in the earth, in places where I had
observed the goats used to feed, and over these pits
I placed hurdles of my own making too, with a great
weight upon them; and several times I put ears of
barley and dry rice, without setting the trap, and I
could easily perceive that the goats had gone in, and
eaten up the corn, for I could see the mark of their
feet. At length, I set three traps in one night, and,
going the next morning, I found them all standing,
K
and the bait eaten. This was very discouraging, but
I altered my traps; and, going one morning, I found
a large he-goat, three kids, a male and two females.
As to the old one, I knew not what to do with him,
he was so fierce that I durst not go into the pit to
him, that is to say, to go to bring him away alive,
which was what I wanted. I could have killed him,
but that was not my business, nor would it answer
my end; so I even let him out, and he ran away as
if he had been frighted out of his wits, but I had
forgot then, what I learned afterwards, that hunger
will tame a lion. If I had let him stay there three
or four days without food, and then have carried him
some water to drink, and then a little corn, he would
have been as tame as one of the kids, for they are
very tractable, when they are well used.
However, for the present I let him go, knowing no
better at that time; then I went to- the three kids,
and, taking them one by one, I tied them with strings
together, and with difficulty brought them home.
It was some time before they would feed; but by
throwing them some sweet corn, it tempted them,
and they began to be tame. And now I found, that
if I expected to supply myself with goat's flesh, when
I had no powder or shot left, breeding some up tame
was my only way, when perhaps I might have them
about my house like a flock of sheep.
But then it presently occurred to me, that I must
keep the tame from the wild, or else they would al-
ways run wild when they grew up, and the only way
for this was to have some enclosed piece of ground,
well fenced either with hedge or pale, to keep them
up so effectually, that they could not mix together.
This was a great undertaking for one pair of hands,
yet, as I saw there was an absolute necessity of doing
it, my first piece of work was to find out a proper
piece of ground, viz. where there was likely to be
herbage for them to eat, water for them to drink, and
*over to keep them from the sun.
The place I pitched upon was a plain open piece of
meadow land, or savannah (as our people call it in
the western colonies), which had two or three little
rills of fresh water in it, and at one end was very
woody. Many will smile at my forecast, when I
shall tell them I began my enclosing this piece of
ground in such a manner, that my hedge or pale must
have been at least two miles about; Nor was the mad-
ness of it so great as to the compass, for if it was ten
miles about, I was like to have time enough to do it
in, but I did not consider that my goats would be as
wild in so much compass, as if they had had the whole
island, and I should have so much room to chase them
in, that I should never catch them.
My hedge was begun and carried on, I believe
about fifty yards, when this thought occurred to me,
so I presently stopped short, and, for the first time,
I resolved to enclose a piece of about one hundred
and fifty yards in length, and one hundred yards in
breadth, which, as it would maintain as many as I
should have in any reasonable time, so, as my flock in-
creased, I could add more ground to my enclosure.
This was acting with some prudence, and I went
to work with courage. I was about three months
hedging in the first piece, and, till I had done it, I
tethered the three kids in the best part of it, and used
to feed them as near me as possible, to make them
familiar; and very often I would go and carry them
some ears of barley,' or a handful of rice, and feed
them out of my hand, so that, after my enclosure
was finished, and I let them loose, they would follow
me up and down, bleating after me for some corn.
This answered my end, and in about a year and a
half I had a flock of about twelve goats, kids and
all, and in two years more I had three-and-forty,
besides several that I took and killed for my food;
and after that I enclosed five several pieces of ground
to feed them in," with little pens to drive them into,
to take them as I wanted them.
But this was not all; for now I not only had goat's
flesh, to feed on when I pleased, but milk too,- a thing
which indeed in the beginning I did not so much as
think of, and which, when it came into my thoughts,
was really an agreeable surprise ; for now I set up
my dairy, and had sometimes a gallon or two of milk
in a day. And as nature, who gives supplies of food
to every creature, dictates even naturally how to
make use of it, so I; that never milked a cow, much
less a goat, or saw butter or cheese made, managed
to make both.
.It would have made a Stoic smile to have seen me
and my little family sit down to dinner. There was
my majesty, the prince and lord of the whole island.
I had the lives of all my subjects at my command.
I could hang, draw, give liberty, and take it away,
and no rebels among all my subjects.
Then to see how like a king I dined too, attended
by my servants! Poll, as if he had been my favourite,
was the only one permitted to talk to me: my dog,
who was now grown very old and crazy, sat always
at my right hand; and two cats, one on each side.
But these were not the two cats which I brought
on shore at first, for they were both of them dead;
but one of them having n multiplied by I know not what
kind of a creature, these were two which I had pre-
served tame, whereas the rest ran wild in the woods,
and became troublesome to me; for they would often
come into my house and I ilunder me, till at last I was
obliged to shoot them, and kill a great many. And
in this plentiful manner I lived; neither could I be
said to want any thing b'Ut society, and of that, in
some time after this, I w< is like to have too much.
I was impatient, as I before observed, to have the
use of my boat, though loa th to run any more hazards,
and therefore sometimes I sat contriving ways to get
her about the island, and at other times I sat myself
down contented enough without her. But I had a
strange uneasiness in my mind to go down to the
point of the island, where, as I have said, in my last
ramble, I went up the hill to see how the shore lay,
and how the current sat. This inclination increased
upon me every day, and at length I resolved to travel
thither by land; and following the edge of the shore,
I did so"; but had any one in England met such
a man as I was, he must either have frighted him,
or raised a great deal of laughter, and as I frequently
stood still to look at myself, I could not but smile at
the notion of my travelling through Yorkshire with
such an equipage, and in such a dress. Be pleased
to take a sketch of my figure as follows:—I had a
great, high, shapeless cap, made of a goat's skin, with
a flap hanging down behind, as well to keep the sun
from me, as to shoot the rain off from running into
my neck; nothing being so hurtful in these climates
as the rain upon the flesh under the clothes.
I had a short jacket of goat's skin, the skirts hang-
ing down to about the middle of my thighs; and a
pair of open-knee'd breeches: the breeches were
made of the skin of an old he-goat, whose hair hung
down such a length on either side. that, like panta-
loons, it reached to the middle of my legs. Stock-
ings and shoes I had none; but I had made me a pair
of something, I scarce know what to call them, like
buskins, to nap over my legs.
I had on a broad belt of goat's skin dried, which I
drew together with two thongs of the same, instead
of buckles: and, in a kind of frog, on each side of this,
hung a saw and a hatchet. I had another belt not so
broad, fastened in the same manner, which hung over
my shoulder; and at the end of it, hung two pouches,
in which I kept my powder and shot. At my back
I carried my basket, on my shoulder my gun, and
over my head a great, clumsy, goat's-skin umbrella,
but which, after all, was the most necessary thing I
had about me, next to my gun. As for my face, the
colour of it was really not so Mulatto-like as one
might expect from a man not at all careful of it, and
living within nine or ten degrees of the equinox. My
beard I had once suffered to grow till it was about a
quarter of a yard long; but as I had scissors and
razors, I had cut it pretty short, except what grew
on my upper lip, which I had trimmed into a large
pair of Mahometan whiskers, such as I had seen wore
by some Turks whom I saw at Sallee. Of these mus tachios or whiskers, I mast say they were monstrous,
and would in England be thought frightful.
In this kind of figure I went my new journey, and
was out five or six days. I travelled first along the
sea-shore, directly to the place where I first brought
my boat to anchor, to get upon the rocks; and, not
having any boat now to take care of, I went over the
land a nearer way, to the same height that I was upon
before, when looking forward to the point of the rocks
which lay out, and which I was to double with my
boat, as I said above, I was surprised to see the sea
all smooth and quiet; no rippling, no motion, no carrent, any more there than in other places.
I was at a strange loss to understand this, and re-
solved to spend some time in observing it, to see if
nothing from the sets of the tide had occasioned it.
But I was presently convinced how it was, viz. that
the tide of ebb setting from the west, and joining the
current of waters from some great river on the shore, must be the occasion of this current; and that, ac-
cording as the wind blew more forcibly from the west,
or from the north, this current came near, or went
farther from the shore: for, waiting thereabouts till
evening, I went up to the rock again, and then the
tide of ebb being made, I plainly saw the current
again as before, only that it ran farther off, being
near half a league from the shore ; whereas, in my
case, it set close upon the shore, and hurried me in
my canoe along with it, which it would not do before.
This observation convinced me that I had nothing
to do but to observe the ebbing and the flowing of the
tide, and I might very easily bring my boat about the island again; but when I began to think of putting
it in practice, I had such a terror upon my spirits at
the remembrance of the danger I had been in, that I
could not think of it again with patience; but on the
contrary, I took up another resolution, which was
more safe, though more laborious, and this was, that
I would make me another periagua, or canoe, and so
have one on each side of the island.
You kare to understand that now I had, as I may
call it, two plantations in the island; one, my little
fortification or tent, with the wall about it under the
rock, with the cave behind me, which by this time I had enlarged into several apartments or caves, one
within another. One of these, which was the driest
and largest, and had a door out beyond my wall or
fortification, was all filled up with large earthen
pots, and with fourteen or fifteen great baskets,
which would hold five or six bushels each, where I laid up 'my stores of provision, especially my corn,
some in the ear cut off short from the straw, and the
other rubbed out with my hand.
As for my wall, made, as before, with long stakes
or piles, those piles grew all like trees, and were by
this time grown so big, and spread so very much,
that there was not the least appearance of any habi-
tation behind them. Near this dwelling of mine,
but a little farther within the land, and upon lower
ground, lay my two pieces of corn-ground, which I kept duly cultivated and sowed, and which always
yielded me their harvest in its season; and whenever
I had occasion for more corn, I had more land adjoin-
ing as fit as that.
Besides this, I had my country seat, and I had
now a tolerable plantation there also. For, first, I had my little bower, as I called it, which I kept in
repair, that is to say, I kept the hedge which circled
it in constantly fitted up to its usual height, the
ladder standing always in the inside. I kept the
trees, which at first were no more than my stakes,
but were now grown very firm and tall; I kept them
always so cut, that they might spread and grow
thick and wild, and make the more agreeable shade,
which they did effectually to my mind. In the
middle of this I had my tent always standing, being
a piece of a sail spread over poles set up for that
purpose, and which never wanted any repair or re-
newing; and under this I had made me a squab or
couch, with the skins of the creatures I had killed,
and with other soft things, and a blanket laid on
them, such as belonged to oar sea-bedding, which I had saved, and a great watch-coat to cover me: and
here, whenever I had occasion to be absent from my
chief seat, I took up my country habitation.
Adjoing to this, I had my enclosures for my goats;
and as I had taken a deal of pains to fence and en-
close this ground, I was so uneasy lest the goats
should break through, that I never left off, till, with
infinite labour, I had stuck the outside of the hedges
so full of small stakes, and so near to one another,
that it was rather a pale than a hedge, and there was
scarce room to put a hand through between them,
which afterwards, when those stakes grew, as they
all did in the next rainy season, made the enclosure
strong like a wall, indeed stronger than my wall.
This will testify for me that I was not idle, and
that I spared no pains to bring to pass whatever ap-
peared necessary for my comfortable support; for I
considered the keeping rap a breed of tame creatures
thus at my hand would be a living magazine of flesh,
milk, butter, and cheese for me, as long as I lived in
the place, if it were to be forty years; and that keep-
ing them within my reach depended entirely upon
my perfecting my enclosures to such a degree, that
I might be sure of keeping them together, which by
this method was effectually secured, and when these
little stakes began to grow, they were planted so very
thick, that I was forced to pull some of them up again.
In this place also I had my grapes growing, which
I principally depended on for my winter store of
raisins, and which I never failed to preserve very
carefully, as the best and most agreeable dainty of
my whole diet; and they were physical, wholesome,
nourishing, and refreshing.
As this was also about half way between my other
habitation and the place where I had laid up my boat,
I generally staid and lay here in my way thither, for
I used frequently to visit my boat, and I kept all
things about it in very good order. Sometimes I
went out in it to divert myself, but no more hazardous
voyages would go, nor scarce ever above a stone's
cast or two from the shore. But now I come to a
new scene of my life.
It happened one day about noon, going towards
my boat, I was greatly surprised with the print of a
man's naked foot on the shore, which was very plain
to be seen in the sand. I stood like one thunder-
struck, or as if I had seen an apparition. I listened,
I looked round me; I could hear or see nothing. I
went up to the rising ground to look farther. I went
up the shore and down the shore, but it was all one;
I could see no other impression but that one. I went
to it again to see if it might not be fancy; but there
was no room for that, for there was exactly the very
print of a foot, toes, heel, and every part of a foot:
now it came thither I knew not, nor could in the
least imagine. But after many fluttering thoughts,
I came home to my fortification, not feeling, as we
say, the ground I went on, but terrified to the last
degree, looking behind me at every two or three steps,
mistaking every bush and tree, and fancying every
stump at a distance to be a man. Nor is it possible to
describe how many various shapes an affrighted
imagination represented things to me in.
When I came to my castle, I fled into it like one
pursued: whether I went over by the ladder, as first
contrived, or went in at the hole in the rock, which
I called a door, I cannot remember; for never frighted
hare fled to cover, or fox to earth, with more terror of
mind than I to this retreat.
I had no sleep that night. The farther I was from
the occasion of my fright, the greater my apprehen-
sions were; which is something contrary to the
nature of such things, and especially to the usual
practice of all creatures in fear. But I was so em-
barrassed with my own frightful ideas of the thing,
that I formed nothing but dismal imaginations to
myself, even though I was now a great way off it.
Sometimes I fancied it must be the devil; and reason
joined in with me upon this supposition; for how
should any other thing in human shape come into the
place? Where was the vessel that brought them?
What marks were there of any other footsteps? And
how was it possible a man should come there? But
then to think that Satan should take human shape
upon him in such a place, where there could be no
manner of occasion for it, but to leave the print of
his foot behind him, and that even for no purpose,
this was an amazement to me the other way. I con-
sidered that the devil might have found out abundance
of other ways to have terrified me, than the single
print of a foot; that as I lived quite on the other
side of the island, he would never have been so simple
to leave a mark in the place where it was ten thousand
to one whether I should see it or not, and in the sand
too, which the first surge of the sea, upon a high wind,
would have defaced entirely. All this seemed incon-
sistent with all notions we usually entertain of the
subtlety of the devil.
Such ideas as these assisted to argue me out of all
apprehensions of its being the devil; and I concluded
that it must be some more dangerous creature, viz.
that it must be some of the savages of the main land
over against me, who had wandered out to sea in
their canoes, and, either driven by the currents, or
by contrary winds, had made the island; and had
been on shore, but were gone away again to sea, being
as loath, perhaps, to have staid in this desolate
island, as I would have been to have had them.
While these reflections were passing in my mind,
I was very thankful that I was not thereabouts at
that time, or that they did not see my boat, by which
they would have concluded that some inhabitants
had been in the place, and perhaps have searched
farther for me. Then terrible thoughts racked my
imagination about their having found my boat, and
that there were people here; and that, if so, I should
certainly have them come again in greater numbers,
and devour me; and that if they should not find me,
yet they would find my enclosure, destroy all my
corn, carry away all my flock of tame goats, and I should perish at last for mere want.
Thus my fear banished all my religious hope; all
that former confidence in God, which was founded
upon such wonderful experience as I had had of his
goodness, now vanished; as if he that had fed me by
miracle hitherto, could not preserve by his power the
provision which he had made for me by his goodness.
I reproached myself for not sowing more corn one
year than would just serve me till next season, as if
nothing could happen to prevent my enjoying the
crop that was upon the ground; and this I thought
so j ust a reproof, that I resolved for the future to have
two or three years' corn before-hand; so that what-
ever might come, I might not perish for want of bread.
These thoughts took me up many hours, days, nay,
weeks and months; and one particular 'effect of my
cogitations on this occasion I cannot omit, viz. one
morning early, lying in my bed, and filled with
thoughts about my danger from the appearance of
savages, I found it discomposed me very much;
upon which those words of the Scripture came into
my thoughts, " Call on me in the day of trouble, and
I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me."
Upon this, rising cheerfully out of my bed, my
heart was not only comforted, but I was guided and
encouraged to pray earnestly to God for deliverance.
When I had done praying, I took up my Bible, and
opening it to read, the first words presented to me
were, " Wait on the Lord, and be of good cheer, and
he shall strengthen thy heart; wait, I say, on the
Lord." It is impossible to express the comfort this
gave me, and in return I thankfully laid down the
book, and was no more sad, at least on that occasion.
In the middle of these cogitations, apprehensions,
and reflections, it came into my thoughts one day,
that all this might be a mere chimera of my own,
and that thisjfoot might be the print of my own foot,
when I came on shore from my boat. This cheered
me up a little too, and I began to persuade myself it
was all a delusion; that it was nothing else but my
own foot; and why might not I come that way from
the boat,as well as I was going that way to the boat?
Again, I considered also, that I could by no means
tell for certain where I had trod, and where I had
not; and that if at last this was only the print of my
own foot, I had played the part of those fools, who
strive to make stories of spectres and apparitions, and
then are themselves frightened at them more than
any body else.
Now I began to take courage, and to peep abroad
again; for I had not stirred out of my castle for three
days and nights, so that I began to starve for provi-
sions, for I had little or nothing within doors, but
some barley cakes and water. Then I knew that my
goats wanted to be milked too, which usually was
evening diversion, and the poor creatures were in
great pain and inconvenience for want of it.
Heartening myself therefore with the belief, that
this was nothing but the print of one of my own feet,
I began to go abroad again, and went to my country
house to milk my flock; but to see with what fear I went forward, how often I looked behind me, and was
ready every now and then, to lay down my basket,
and run for my life, it would have made any one have
thought I was haunted with an evil conscience, or
that I had lately been frightened.
However, as I went on thus two or three days, and
had seen nothing, I began to be bolder, and to think
there was nothing in it but my own imagination; but
I could not persuade myself fully to this, till I should
go down to the shore again, and see this print of a
foot, and measure it by my own, and see if there was
any similitude or fitness, that I might be assured it
was my own foot. But when I came to the place, it
appeared evidently to me, that when I laid up my
boat, I could not possibly be on shore any where there-
abouts. Secondly, when I came to measure the mark
with my foot, I found my foot not so large by a great
deal; both these things filled my head with new ima-
ginations, and gave me the vapours again, so that I shook with cold, like one in an ague, and I went home
again, filled with the belief that some man or men
had been on shore there ; or, in short that the island
was inhabited, and I might be surprised before I was aware; and what course to take 1 knew not.
O what ridiculous resolutions men take, when pos-
sessed with fear! It deprives them of the use of
those means which reason offers for their relief. The
first thing I proposed to myself was, to throw down
my enclosures, and turn all my tame cattle wild into
the woods, that the enemy might not find them, and
then frequent the island in prospect of the same, or
the like booty; then the simple thing of digging up
my two corn fields, that they might not find such a
grain there, and still be prompted to frequent the
island; then to demolish my bower and tent, that
they might not see any vestiges of habitation, and be
tempted to look farther, in order to find out the per-
sons that were inhabitating it.
These were the subjects of the first night's cogita-
tion, after I was come home again, while the appre-
hensions which had so overrun my mind were fresh upon me, and my head was full of vapors, as above.
Thus fear of danger is ten thousand times more ter-
rifying than danger itself when apparent to the eyes,
and we find the burden of anxiety greater by much,
than the evil which we are anxious about; but, what
is worse than all this, I had not that relief in this
trouble from the resignation I used to practice, that
I hoped to have. I looked, I thought, like Saul, who
complained not only that the Philistines were upon
him, but that God had forsaken him; for I did not
now take due ways to compose my mind, by crying
to God in my distress, and resting upon his provi-
dence, as I had done before, for my defense and deli-
verance ; which if I had done, I had, at least, been
more cheerfully supported under this new surprise,
and perhaps carried through it with more resolution.
This confusion of my thoughts kept me waking all
night; but, in the morning, I fell asleep, and having,
by the amusement of my mind, been, as it were, tired,
and my spirits exhausted, I slept very soundly, and
awaked much better composed than if had ever been
before. And now I began to think sedately ; and,
upon the utmost debate with myself, I concluded, that
this island, which was so exceeding pleasant, fruit-
ful, and no farther from the main land than as I had
seen, was not so entirely abandoned as I might ima-
gine: that although there were no stated inhabitants
who lived on this spot, yet that there might some-
times come boats off from the shore, who either with
design, or perhaps never but when they were driven
by cross winds, might come to this place; that I had
lived fifteen years now, and had not met with the
least shadow or figure of any people before ; and that
if at any time they should be driven here, it was pro-
bable they went away again as soon as they could,
seeing they had never thought fit to fix here, upon
any occasion, to this time; that the most I could sug-
gest any danger from, was, from any such casual ac-
cidental landing of straggling people from the main;
who were driven here against their wills, so that they
made no stay here, but went off again with all pos-
sible speed, seldom staying one night on shore, lest
they should not have the help of the tides and day-
light back again; and that therefore I had nothing
to do but consider of some retreat, in case I should
see any savages land upon the spot.
Now I began sorely to repent, that I had dug my
cave so large as to bring a door through again, which
door, as I said, came out beyond where my fortifica-
tion joined to the rock. Upon maturely considering
this, therefore, I resolved to draw me a second forti-
fication, in the same manner of a semicircle, at a dis-
tance from my wall, where I had planted a double
row of trees, above twelve years before, of which I made mention. These trees having been planted so
thick before, there wanted but a few piles to be driven
between them, that they might be much thicker and
stronger, and my wall would be soon finished.
So that I had now a double wall, and my outer one
was thickened with pieces of timber, old cables, and
every thing that I could think of to make it strong; having in it seven little holes, about as big as I could
put my arm out at. In the inside of this I thickened
my wall to about ten feet thick, continually bringing
earth out of my cave, and laying it at the foot of my
wall, and walkmgupon it: and through the seven holes
I contrived to plant the muskets, of which I have men-
tioned that I got seven on shore out of the ship; and
these I planted like cannon, and fitted them into
frames that held them like a carriage, that so I could
fire all the seven guns in two minutes' time. This
wall I was many a weary month in finishing, and yet
never thought myself safe till it was done.
When this was done, I stuck all the ground with-
out my wall, for a great space every way, full with
stakes or sticks of the osier-like wood, which I found
so apt to grow, as they could stand, insomuch that I
believe that there must have been set in near twenty
thousand of them, leaving a pretty large space be-
160 ROBINSON CRUSOE. tween them and my wall, that I might have room to
see the enemy, and that they might have no shelter
from the young trees, if they approached my wall.
Thus, in two years' time, I had a thick grove; and,
in five or six years' time, I had a wood before my
dwelling grown so monstrous thick and strong that
it was indeed perfectly impassable: and no man, of
what kind soever, would ever imagine that there
was any thing beyond it, much less a habitation. As
for the way I proposed to myself to go in and out
(for I left no avenue), it was by setting two ladders,
one to a part of the rock which was low, and broke
in, and left room to place another ladder upon that,
so when the two ladders were taken down, no man
living could come down to me without injuring him-
self; and if they had come down, they were still on
the outside of my outer wall.
Thus I took all the measures human prudence could
suggest for my own preservation; and it will be seen,
at length, that they were not altogether without just
reason, though I foresaw nothing at that time, more
than fear suggested to me.
While this was doing, I was not altogether careless
of my other affairs; for I had great concern upon me
for my little herd of goats; they were not only a pre-
sent supply to me upon every occasion, and began to
be sufficient for me, without the expense of powder
and shot, but also abated the fatigue of my hunting
after wild ones, and I was loath to lose the advantage
of them, and to have them all to nurse up again.
To this purpose, I could think of but two ways to
preserve them; one was to find another convenient
place to dig a cave under ground, and to drive them
into it every night; and the other was to enclose two
or three little bits of land, remote from one another,
and as much concealed as could be, where I might
keep about half a dozen young goats in each place,
so that if any disaster happened to the flock in gene-
ral, I might be able to raise them again with little
trouble and time; and though it would require much
time and labour, I thought this was the best design.
Accordingly I spent some time to find out the most retired parts of the island; and I pitched upon one
which was as private as my heart could wish; for it
was a little damp piece of ground in the middle of the
hollow and thick woods, where, as is observed, I al-
most lost myself once before, endeavoring to come
back that way from the eastern part of the island.
Here I found a clear piece of land, near three acres,
so surrounded with woods, that it was almost an en-
closure by nature.
I immediately went to work at this piece of ground,
and, in less than a month's time. I had so fenced it
round, that my flock would be well enough secured in
it. So, without any further delay, I removed ten she-
goats and two he-goats to this place; and when they
were there, I continued to perfect the fence, till I had
made it as secure as the other.
All this labour I was at the trouble of. was purely
from my apprehensions on account of the print of a
man's foot which I had seen, for as yet I never saw
any human creature come near the island; and I had
now lived two years in this uneasiness, which indeed
made my life much less comfortable than it was before,
and this I must observe, that the discomposure of my
mind had too great impressions also upon the religi-
ous part of my thoughts; for the dread and terror of
falling into the hands of savages and cannibals lay so
upon my spirits, that I seldom found myself in a due
temper for application to my Maker, at least not with
the sedate calmness and resignation of soul which I
was wont to do. I rather prayed to God as under
great affliction and pressure of mind, surrounded by
danger, and in expectation every night of being mur-
dered and devoured before morning, and I must tes-
tify, from my own experience, that a temper of peace,
thankfulness, love and affection, is much more the
proper frame for prayer, than that of terror and dis-
L
composure; a man is more fit for a comforting per-
formance of the duty of praying to God, than he is
for repentance on a sick bed, for these discomposures
affect the mind as the others do the body, and the
discomposure of the mind must necessarily be as great
a disability as that of the body, and much greater,
praying being an act of the mind, not of the body.
But to go on; after I had thus secured one part of
my little living stock, I went about the whole island,
searching for another private place, to make such
another deposit; when wandering more to the west
point of the island than I had ever done yet, and look-
mg out to sea, I thought I saw a boat upon the sea,
at a great distance. I had found a perspective glass
or two in one of the seamen's chests which I had saved
out of our ship, but I had it not about me, and this
was so remote that I could not tell what to make of
it, though I looked at it till my eyes were not able to
hold to look any longer. Whether it was a boat or
not, I did not know; but as I descended from the
hill, I could see no more of it, so I gave it over; only
I resolved to go no more without a prospective glass.
When I was .come down the hill, to the end of the
island, where I had never been before, I was presently
convinced that the seeing the print of a man's foot
was not such a strange thing in the island as I ima-
gined; and, but that it was a special providence that
I was cast upon the side of the island where the sa-
vages never came, I should have easily known that
nothing was more frequent than for the canoes from
the main, when they happened to be a little too far
out at sea, to shoot over to that side of the island for
harbour; likewise, as they often met, and fought in
their canoes, the victors, having taken any prisoners,
would bring them over to this shore, where, according
to their dreadful customs, being all cannibals, they
would kill and eat them. Of which hereafter.
When I was come down the hill to the shore, as I said above, being the S. W. point of the island, I was
perfectly confounded and amazed; nor is it possible
for me to express the horror of my mind, at seeing
the shore spread with skulls, hands, feet, and other
bones of human bodies: and particularly I observed
a place where there had been a fire made, and a circle
dug in the earth, like a cockpit, where it is supposed
the savage wretches had sat down to their inhuman
feastings upon the bodies of their fellow creatures.
I was so astonished with the sight of these things,
that I entertained no notions of any danger to myself
from it for a long while; all my apprehensions were
buried in the thoughts of such a pitch of inhuman,
hellish brutality, and the horror of the degeneracy of
human nature, which, though I had heard of often,
yet I never had so near a view of before; in short, I
turned away my face from the horrid spectacle; my
stomach grew sick, and I was just at the point of
fainting, when nature discharged the disorder from
my stomach; and, having vomited, I was relieved,
but could not bear to stay in the place a moment; so
1 got up the hill again, with all the speed I could,
and walked on towards my own habitation.
When I came a little out of that part of the island,
I stood still awhile as amazed, and then recovering
myself, I looked up with the utmost affection of my
soul, and with aflood of tears in my eyes, gave God
thanks, that had cast my first lot in a part of the
world where I was distinguished from such dreadful
creatures as these, and that though I had esteemed
my present condition very miserable, had yet given
me so many comforts in it, that I had still more to
give thanks for, than to complain of; and this above
all, that I had, even in this miserable condition, been
comforted with the knowledge of Himself, and the
hope of his blessing, which was a felicity more than
sufficiently equivalent to all the misery which I had
suffered, or could suffer.
In this frame of thankfulness I went home to my
castle, and began to be much easier now, as to the
safety of my circumstances, than ever I was before,
for I observed that these wretches never came to this
island in search of what they could get; perhaps
not wanting, or not expecting any thing here; and
having often, no doubt, been up in the covered woody
part of it without finding any thing to their purpose.
I knew I had been here now almost eighteen years,
and never saw the least footsteps of human creature
here before; and might be here eighteen more as
entirely concealed as I was now, if I did not discover
myself to them, which I had no manner of occasion
to do, it being my only business to keep myself en-
tirely concealed where I was, unless I found better
creatures than cannibals to make myself known to.
Yet I entertained such an abhorrence of the savage
wretches, and of the wretched inhuman custom of
their devouring and eating one another up, that I
continued pensive and sad, and kept close within my
own circle for almost two years after this. When I say my own circle, I mean by it my three plantations,
viz. my castle, my country seat, which I called my
bower, and my enclosure in the woods; nor did I look
after this for any other use than as an enclosure for
my goats; for the aversion nature gave me to these
hellish wretches was such, that I was as fearful of
seeing them as of seeing the devil himself. Nor did
I so much as go to look after my boat in all this time,
but began rather to think of making me another;
for I could not think of making any more attempts
to bring the boat round the island to me, lest I should
meet with some of these creatures at sea, into whose
hands, if I had happened to have fallen, I knew what
would have been my lot.
Time, however, and the satisfaction I had that I
was in no danger of being discovered by these people,
began to wear off my uneasiness about them, and I
began to live just in the same composed manner as
before, only with this difference, that I used more
caution, and kept my eyes more about me than I did before, lest I should happen to be seen by any of them;
and particularly I was more cautious in firing my
gun, lest any of them being on the island should
happen to hear it; and it was therefore a very good
providence to me that I had furnished myself with a
tame breed of goats, that I needed not hunt any more
about the woods, or shoot at them; and if I did catch
any of them after this, it was by traps and snares, as
1 Iiaddone before: so that for two years after this I believe I never fired my gun once on, though I never
went out without it; and, which was more, as I had
saved three pistols out of the ship, I always carried
them out with me, or at least two of them, sticking
them in my goat-skin belt; I likewise polished up
one of the great cutlasses that I had out of the ship,
and made me a belt to put it in also; so that I was
BOW a most formidable fellow to look at when I went
abroad, if you add to the former description of myself
the particular of two pistols, and a great broadsword
hanging at my side in a belt, but without a scabbard.
Things going on thus, as I have said, for some time,
I seemed, excepting these cautions, to be reduced to
my former calm, sedate way of living. All these
things tended to showing me, more and more, how far
my condition was from being miserable, compared
to some others, nay, to many other particulars of life,
which it might have pleased God to have made my
lot. It put me upon reflecting how little repining
there would be among mankind, at any condition of
life, if people would rather compare their condition
with those that are worse, in order to be thankful,
than be always comparing them with those which are
better to assist their murmurings and complainings.
As in my present condition there were not really
many things which I wanted, so indeed I thought
that the frights I had been in about these savage
wretches, and the concern I had been in for my own
preservation, had taken off the edge of my invention
i'or my own conveniences; and I had dropped a good
design, which I had once bent my thoughts upon, and
that was, to try if I could not make some of my
barley into malt, and then try to brew myself some
beer. This was really a whimsical thought, and I
reproved myself often for the simplicity of it; for I presently saw there would be the want of several
things necessary to the making my beer that it would
be impossible for me to supply; as, first, casks to
preserve it in, which was a thing that, as I have ob-
served already, I could never compass, no, though I spent not many days, but weeks, nay months, in
attempting it, but to no purpose. In the next
place, I had no hops, to make it keep, no yeast,
to make it work, ana no copper to make it boil; and
yet, had not all these intervened, I mean the frights
and terrors I was in about the savages, I had under-
taken it, and perhaps brought it to pass too; for I seldom gave over any thing without accomplishing
it, when I once had it in my head enough to begin it.
But my invention now ran quite another way, for
night and day I could think of nothing but how I might destroy some of these monsters in their cruel
and bloody entertainment, and, if possible, save the
victim they should bring hither to destroy. i t would
take up a larger volume than this whole work is in-
tended to be, to set down all the contrivances I laid
down in my thoughts, for destroying these creatures,
or at least frightening them, so as to prevent their
coming hither any more, but all was abortive; nothing
could be possible to take effect, unless I was to be
there to do it" myself; and what could one man do
among them, when perhaps there might be twenty or
thirty of them together, with their darts, or their
bows and arrows, with which they could shoot as true
to a mark as I could with my gun.
Sometimes I contemplated to dig a hole under the
place where they made their fire, and put in five or
six pounds of gunpowder, which, when they kindled
their fire. would consequently ignite, and blow up
all that was near It. But, as I had not quite one
barrel of powder left, I was loath to spend so much
on them; neither could I be sure of its going off at
one certain time, when it might surprise them; and
and at best that it would do little more than just
blow the fire about their ears, and fright them, but
not sufficient to make them forsake the place; so I laid it aside, and then proposed that I would place
myself in ambush, in some convenient place, with
my three guns, all double loaded, and, in the middle
ot their bloody ceremony, let fly at them, when I
should be sure to kill or wound perhaps two or three
at every shot, and then falling in upon them with
my three pistols and my sword, I made no doubt but
that if there were twenty I should kill them all.
I went so far with it in my imagination, that I
spent several days to find out proper places to put
myself in ambuscade, to watch for them, and I went
frequently to the place itself; but the horror I had
at the Jj>lace, and at the signals of the barbarous
wretches devouring one another, made me shudder.
At length I found a place in the side of the hill,
where I was satisfied I might securely wait till I saw
any of their boats coming, and might then, even be-
fore they would be ready to come on shore, convey
myself unseen into thickets of the trees, in one of
which there was a hollow large enough to conceal
me entirely, and where I might sit and observe all
their bloody doings, and take aim at their heads,
when they were so close together as that it would be
nearly impossible that I should miss them, or that I
could fail wounding three or four at the first shot.
In this place, then, I resolved to fix my design,
and accordingly I prepared two muskets, and my
fowling piece. The two muskets I loaded with a
brace of slugs each, and four or dive smaller bullets,
about the size of pistol bullets, and the fowling- piece
I loaded with near a handful of swan-shot, of the
largest size. I also loaded my pistols with about
1C8 HOJtlSSOX CBUSOti.
four bullets each ; and in this posture, well provided
with ammunition for a second and third charge, I
prepared myself for my expedition.
After I had thus laid the scheme for my design,
I continually made my tour every morning up to the
top of the hill, which was from my castle, as I called
it, about three miles or more, to see if I could observe
any boats upon the sea, coming near the island, or
standing over towards it; but I began to tire of this
hard duty, after I had for two or three months con-
stantly kept my watch, and come always back with-
out any discovery, there having not in all that time
been the least appearance, not only on or near the
shore, but not on the whole ocean, so far as my eyes
or glasses could reach every way. As long as I kept
<ip the daily tour to the hill to look out, so long also
I kept up the vigour of my design; and my spirits
seemed to be all the while in a suitable frame for so
outrageous an execution as the killing twenty or
thirty naked savages for an offence which I had not
at all entered into a discussion of in my thoughts,
any farther than my passions were at first fired by
the horror I conceived at the unnatural custom of
the people of that country, who, it seems, had been
suffered by Providence, in his wise disposition of the
world, to have no other guide than that of their own
abominable and vitiated passions, and consequently
were left, and perhaps had been for ages, to act such horrid things, and receive such horrid customs, as
nothing but nature, entirely abandoned by Heaven,
could have run them into. But then, after cool re-
flection, I began to consider what it was I was going
to engage in; what authority or call I had to pretend
to be judge and executioner upon these men as cri-
minals, whom Heaven had thought fit, for so many
ages, to suffer, unpunished, to co on, and to be, as it
were, the executioner of his judgments upon one
another; also how far these people were offenders
against me, and what right I had to engage in the
quarrel of that blood which they shed promiscnously
one upon another. I debated this very often with
myself thus: how do I know what God himself
judges in this particular case? It is certain these
people do not commit this as a crime: it is not
against their own consciences reproving, or their
light reproaching them. They do not know it to be
an offence, and then commit it in defiance of Divine
justice, as we do in almost all the sins we commit.
They think it no more a crime to kill a captive taken
in war, than we do to kill an ox; or to eat human
flesh, than we do to eat mutton.
When I had considered this a little, it followed
necessarily that I was certainly in the wrong in it;
that these people were not murderers in the sense
that I had before condemned them in my thoughts,
any more than those Christians were murderers who
often put to death the prisoners taken in battle. or
more frequently, upon many occasions, put whole
troops of men to the sword, without giving quarter,
though they threw down their arms and submitted.
These considerations really put me to a pause, and
I began to conclude that I had taken wrong measures
in my resolution to attack the savages; that it was
not my business to meddle with them, unless they
first attacked me, and this it was my business, if
possible, to prevent; but that if I were discovered
and attacked, then I knew my duty.
On the other hand, I argued with myself that this
really was the way not to deliver myself, but entirely
to ruin and destroy myself; for unless I was sure to
kill every one that not only should be on shore at that
time, but that should ever come on shore afterwards,
if but one of them escaped to tell their country people
what had happened, they would come over again by
thousands to revenge the death of their fellows, and
I should only bring upon myself a certain destruction,
which, at present I had no manner of occasion for.
Upon the whole, I concluded that neither in prin-
ciples or policy I ought, one way or other, to concern
myself in this affair; that my business was, by all
possible means, to conceal myself from them, and not
to leave the least signal to them to guess by that
there were any living human creatures upon the island.
Religion joined in with this prudential resolution;
and I was convinced that I was perfectly out of my
duty when I was laying all my bloody schemes for
the destruction of innocent creatures; I mean inno-
cent as to me. As to the crimes they were guilty of
towards one another, I had nothing to do with them:
they were national, and I ought to leave them to the
justice of God, who is the Governor of nations, and
knows how to bring public judgments upon those
who offend in a public manner, by such ways as best
please him.
This appeared so clear to me now, that nothing
was a greater satisfaction to me than that I had not
been suffered to do a thing which I now saw so much
reason to believe would have been no less a sin than
that of wilful murder, if I had committed it; and I
gave most humble thanks on my knees to God, that
had thus delivered me from blood-guiltiness, beseech-
ing him to grant me the protection of his providence, that I might not lay my hands upon them, unless I
had a more clear call from Heaven to do it, in defence
of my own life.
In this disposition I continued for near a year, and
in all that time I never once went up the hill to see
whether there were any of them in sight, or to know
whether any of them had been on shore there or not;
only this I did, I went and removed my boat, which
I had on the other side of the island, and carried it
down to the east end of the whole island, where I
ran it into a little cove, which I found under some
high rocks, and where I knew, by reason of the cur-
rents, the savages durst not, at least would not, come
with their boats, upon any account whatever.
With my boat I carried away every thing I had
left there belonging to it, viz. a mast and sail,
which I had made for it, and a thing like an anchor.
All these I removed, that there might not be the
least shadow of any discovery, or any appearance of
;uiy boat, or any human habitation upon the island.
Besides this, I kept myself more retired than ever,
and seldom went from my cell, except to milk my
she-goats, and manage my little flock in the wood,
which, as it was on the other part of the island, was
quite out of danger; for the savages seldom wandered
off from the coast. I looked back with some horror
upon the thoughts of what my condition would have
been, if I had chopped upon them, and been discovered
beforetime, when naked and unarmed, except with
one gun, and that loaded often only with small shot.
I walked every where peeping and peering about the
island, to see what I could get; what a surprise
should I have been in, if, when I discovered the print
of a man's foot, I had. instead of that, seen fifteen or
twenty savages, and found them pursuing me, and,
by the swiftness of their running, no possibility of
my escaping them.
The thoughts of this sometimes sunk my very soul
within me, and distressed my mind so much, that I
could not recover it. Indeed, after seriously think-
ing of these things, I would be very melancholy, and
sometimes it would last a great while; but I resolved
it at last into thankfulness to that Providence which
had delivered me from so many unseen dangers, and
had kept me from those mischiefs which I could no
way have been the agent in delivering myself from;
because I had not the least notion of any such thing
depending, or any supposition of its being possible.
This renewed a contemplation which often had
come to my thoughts in former times, when first I began to see the merciful dispositions of Heaven, in
the dangers we had run through in this life: how
wonderfully we are delivered, when we know nothing
of it; how when we are in a doubt or hesitation,
whether to go this way, or that way, a secret hint
should direct us this way, when we intended to go
that way; nay, when sense, our own inclination,
and perhaps business, has called to go the other way,
yet a strange impression upon the mind, from we
know not what springs, and by we know not what
power, shall over-rule us to go this way; and it shall
afterwards appear that had we gone that way which
we should have gone, and even to our imagination
ought to have gone, we should have been ruined and
lost. Upon these, and many like reflections, I after-
wards made it a certain rule with me, that whenever
I found these secret hints, or presages of my mind,
to doing or not doing any thing that presented, or to
going this way or that way, I never failed to obey
the secret dictate, though I knew no other reason
for it than that such a pressure hung upon my mind.
I cannot but advise all considering men, whose lives
are attended with such extraordinary incidents as
mine, or even though not so extraordinary, not to
slight such secret intimations of Providence, let them
come from what invisible intelligence they will, that
I shall not discuss, and perhaps cannot account for;
but certainly they are a proof of the converse of
spirits, and the secret communication between those
embodied and those unembodied, and such a proof as
can never be withstood.
I believe the reader of this will not think it strange
if I confess that these anxieties, these constant dan-
gers I lived in, and the concern that was now upon
me, put an end to all invention, and to all the con-
trivances that I had laid for my future accommoda-
tions and conveniences. I had the care of my safety
more now upon my hands than that of my food. I
cared not to drive a nail, or chop a stick of wood
now, for fear the noise I should make would be heard,
much less would I fire a gun for the same reason:
and, above all, I was very uneasy at making any fire,
lest the smoke, which is visible at a great distance
in the day, should betray me; and for this reason I removed that part of my business which required
fire, such as burning of pots and pipes, &c. into my
new apartment in the woods, where, after I had been
some time, I found, to my unspeakable consolation,
a mere natural cave in the earth, which went a vast
way, and where, I dare say, no savage, had he been
at the mouth of it, would be so hardy as to venture
in; nor indeed would any man else, but one who,
like me, wanted nothing so much as a safe retreat.
The mouth of this hollow was at the bottom of a
great rock, where (by mere accident I would say, if
I did not see abundant reason to ascribe such things
now to providence), I was cutting down some thick
branches of trees to make charcoal; and before I go
on, I must observe the reason of my making this
charcoal, which was thus:—I was afraid of making
a smoke about my habitation, as I said before; and
yet I could not live there without baking my bread,
cooking my meat, &c.; so I contrived to burn some
wood here, as I had seen done in England, under turf
till it became chark or dry coal; and then putting
the fire out, I preserved the coal to carry home, and
performed the other services which fire was wanting
for at home, without danger of smoke.
While I was cutting down some wood here, I per-
ceived that, behind a very thick branch of low brush-
wood, or underwood, there was a kind of hollow
place. I was curious to look into it, and gettingwith difficulty into the mouth of it, I found it was pretty
large, that is to say, sufficient for me to stand upright
in it, and perhaps another with me: but I must con-
fess to you, I made more haste out than I did in,
when looking farther into the place, which was per-
fectly dark, I saw two broad shining eyes of some
creature, whether devil or man I know not, which
twinkled like two stars; the dim light from the cave's
mouth shining directly in, and making the reflection.
However, after some time, I recovered myself, and
began to call myself a thousand fools, and teli my-
self, that he that was afraid to see the devil, was not
fit to live twenty years in an island all alone, and that
perhaps there was nothing in this cave that was more
frightful than myself. Upon this, plucking up my
courage, I took up a great firebrand, and in I rushed
again, with the stick in my hand. I had not gone
above three steps in, but I was almost as frighted as
I was before, for I heard a very loud sigh, like that
of a man in some pain, and it was followed by a noise,
like words half expressed, and then a deep sigh again.
I stepped back, and was indeed struck with such sur-
prise, that it put me into a cold sweat, and if I had
had a hat on my head, I think my hair would have
lifted it off. But still plucking up my spirits, as well
as I could, and encouraging myself a little, with con-
sidering that the power and presence of God was
every where, and was able to protect me, I stepped
forward again, and by the light of the firebrand, I saw
lying on the ground, a monstrous frightful old he-
goat, just making his will, as we say, gaspingfor life,
and dying of mere old age.
I stirred him a little, to see if I could get him out,
and he strived to get up, but he was not able to raise
himself, and I thought he should even lie there, for
if he had frighted me so, he would certainly fright
any of the savages, if any of them should be hardy
enough to come in there, while he had life in him.
I was now recovered from my surprise, and began to
look round me, when I found the cave was but small,
that is to say, it might be about twelve feet over, but
in no manner of shape, either round or square, no
hands having ever been employed in making it but
those of mere nature. I observed also that there was
a place at the far side of it, that went in farther,
but was so low that it required me to creep upon my
hands and knees to go into it, and whither it went I
knew not, so having no candle, I gave it over for that
time, but resolved to come again the next day, pro-
vided with candles and a tinder-box, which I made
of the lock of a musket, with some wildfire in the pan.
Accordingly, the next day, I came provided with
six large candles of my own making, for I made very
good candles now of goats' tallow; and going into
this low place, I was obliged to creep upon all fours,
as I have said, almost ten yards, which, by the way,
I thought was a venture bold enough, considering
that I knew not how far it might go, or what was
beyond it. When I was got through the strait, I
found the roof rose higher up, I believe near twenty
feet; but never was such a glorious sight seen in the
island, I dare say, as it was, to look round the sides
and roof of this vault or cave. The walls reflected
a hundred thousand lights to me from my two candles.
What it was that was in the rock, whether diamonds,
or any other precious stones, or gold, I knew not.
The place I was in was a most delightful cavity or
grotto, of its kind, as could be expected, though per-
fectly dark; the floor was dry and level, and had a
sort of a small loose gravel upon it, so that there was
no nauseous or venomous creatures to be seen; nor
was there any damp or wet on the sides or roof. The
only difficulty in it was the entrance, which, how-
ever, as it was a place of security, and such a retreat
as I wanted, I thought that was a convenience; so
that I was really rejoiced at the discovery, and re-
solved without any delay, to bring some of those
things which I was most anxious about to this place;
particularly I resolved to bring hither my magazine
of powder, and all my spare arms, viz. two fowling-
pieces, and three muskets; so I kept at my castle
only five, which stood ready mounted, like pieces of
cannon, on my outmost fence, and were ready also to
take out upon any expedition.
Upon this occasion of removing my ammunition,
I was obliged to open the barrel of powder which I
took up out of the sea, and which had been wet; and
I found that the water had penetrated about three or
four inches into the powder on every side, which
caking and growing hard, had preserved the inside
like a kernel in a shell, so that I had sixty pounds of
very good powder in the centre of the cask ; and this
was an agreeable discovery to me at that time; so I carried all away thither, never keeping above two or
three pounds of powder with me in my castle, for fear
of a surprise of any kind. I also carried thither all
the lead I had left'for bullets.
I fancied myself now like one of the ancient giants,
which were said to live in caves and holes in rocks,
where none could come at them; for I persuaded my-
self, while I was here, if five hundred savages were
to hunt me, -they would not venture to attack me here.
The old goat, whom I found expiring, died in the
mouth of the cave, the next day after I made this
discovery, and I found it much easier to dig a hole
there, and throw him in, and cover him with earth,
than to drag him out, so I interred him there, to pre-
vent offence to my nose.
I was now in my twenty-third year of residence in
this island, and was so naturalized to the place, and
to the manner of living, that could I have but enjoyed
the certainty that no savages would come to the place
to disturb me, I could have been content to have
capitulated for spending the rest of my time there,
even to the last moment, till I had laid me down and
died, like the old goat in the cave. I had also ar-
rived to some little diversions and amusements, which
made the time pass more pleasantly with me a great
deal than it did before; as, first, I had taught my
Poll, as I noted before, to speak, and he did it so
familiarly, and talked so articulately and plain, that
it was very pleasant to me; and he lived with me no
less than six-and-twenty years. How long he might
live afterwards I know not; though I know they have
a notion, in the Brazils, that they live a hundred
years. Perhaps poor Poll may be alive there still,
calling after " poor Robin Crusoe" to this day. My
dog was a very pleasant and loving companion
to me for no less than sixteen years of my time, and
then died of mere old age. As for my cats they
multiplied, as I have observed, to that degree, that
I was obliged to shoot several of them at first, to
keep them from devouring me, and all I had; but at
length, when the two old ones I brought with me
were gone, and after some time continually driving
»nv "I tiiicc IctvuuiibCB, "ml i! 1 i>.r|(g -J'NM . luiu
whose young, when they had any, I always drowned;
and these were part of my family. Besides these,
I always kept two or three household kids about me.
which I taught to feed out of my hand, and I had
some more parrots, which talked pretty well, and
would all call "Robin Crusoe," but none like my
first; for I did not take the pains with them that!
had done with him. I had also several tame sea
fowls, whose names I knew not, which I had caught
upon the shore, and cut their wings; and the little
stakes which I had planted before my castle wall,
being now grown up to a good thick grove, those
fowls all lived among these low trees, and bred there,
which was very agreeable to me; so that I began to
be very well contented with the life I led, if it might
but have been secured from the dread I had of the
savages.
But it was otherwise directed; and it may not be
amiss for all people who shall meet with my story,
to make this just observation from it; viz. how fre-
quently, in the course of our lives, the evil, which in
itself we seek most to shun, and which, when we are
fallen into, is the most dreadful to us, is oftentimes
the very means or door of our deliverance, by which
alone we can be raised again from the afflictions we
are fallen into. This was particularly remarkable
in the circumstances of the last years of my solitary
residence in this island.
M
It was now the month of December, in toy twenty-
third year, and this being the southern solstice, for
winter I cannot call it, was the particular time of
my harvest, and required my being pretty much
abroad in the fields; when going out pretty early
one morning, even before it was thorough daylight,
I was surprised with seeing a light of some fire upon
the shore, at a distance from me of about two miles,
towards the end of the island where I had observed
some savages had been before, but not on the other
side, no, to my great affliction, it was on my side of
the island.
I was indeed terribly surprised at the sight, and
stopped short within my grove, not daring to go out,
lest I might be surprised: and yet I had no more
peace within, from the apprehensions I had that if
these savages in rambling over the island, should
find my corn standing, or cut, or any of my works
or improvements, they would immediately conclude
that there were people in the place, and would then
never give over till they found me out. In this ex-
extremity I went back directly to my castle, pulled
up the ladder after me, having made all things with-
out look as wild and natural as I could.
Then I prepared myself within, putting myself in
a posture of defence. I loaded all my cannon as I called them, that is to say, my muskets, which were
mounted upon my new fortification, and all my pis-
tols, and resolved to defend myself to the last gasp,
not forgetting seriously to commend myself to the
Divine protection, and earnestly to pray to God to
deliver me out of the hands of the barbarians; and
in this posture I continued about two hours, but
began to be mighty impatient for intelligence abroad.
After sitting a while longer, and musing what I
should do in this case, I could not bear sitting in
ignorance any longer, so setting up my ladder to the
side of the hill, where there was a flat place, as I
observed before, and then pulling the ladder up after
me. I set it ujf> again, and mounted to the top of the
hill, and pulling out my perspective glass, which I
had taken on purpose, I laid me down flat on my
belly on the ground, and began to look for the place.
I presently found there were no less than nine naked
savages sitting round a small fire they had made,
not to warm them, they had no need (of that, the
weather being extremely hot, but, as I supposed, to
dress some of their barbarous diet of human flesh,
which they had brought with them, whether alive or
dead, I could not know.
They had two canoes with them, which they had
hauled up upon the shore, and as it was then tide of
ebb, they seemed to wait the return of the flood to
go away again. It is not easy to imagine what con-
fusion this sight put me into, especially seeing them
come on my side of the island, and so near me too;
but when I observed their coming must be always
with the current of the ebb, I began aftewards to be
more sedate in my mind, being satisfied that I might
g i abroad with safety, all the time of tide of flood, if
they were not on shore before; and having made this
observation I went abroad about my harvest work
with the more composure.
As I expected so it proved, for as soon as the tide
made to the westward, I saw them all take boat, and
row away. I should have observed, they were all
quite naked, and, for an hour and more before they
went off, they went to dancing, and I could easily
discern their grotesque postures and gestures by my
glasses.
As soon as I saw them shipped and gone, I took
two guns upon my shoulders, and two pistols at my
girdle, and my great sword by my side, without a
scabbard, and with all the speed I was able to make,
I went away to the hill where I had discovered the
first appearance of all. As soon as I got thither,
which was not less than two hours, I perceived there
had been three canoes more of savages on that place,
M 2
and looking out farther, I saw they were all at sea
together, making over for the main.
This was a dreadful sight to me; especially when
going down to the shore, I could see with horror the
dismal work they had been about, viz. the blood and
bones, and part of the flesh of human bodies, eaten
and devoured by those wretches with merriment and
sport. I was so filled with indignation at the sight,
that I began now to premeditate the destruction of
the next that I saw there, let them be who or how
many soever.
It seemed evident to me, that the visits which they
thus made to this island were not very frequent; for
it was above fifteen months before any more of them
came on shore there again, that is to say, I never
saw them, or any footsteps or signals of them in all
that time; and I found they did not come in the
rainy season; yet all this while I lived uncomfortably,
by reason of the constant apprehensions I was in of
their coming upon me by surprise.
During all this time, I was in the murdering hu-
mour, and took up most of my hours, which should
have been better employed, in'contriving how to fall
upon them the very next time I should see them,
especially if they should be divided, as they were the
last time, into two parties; nor did I consider at all,
that if I killed one party, suppose ten or a dozen, I
was still the next day, or week, or month, to kill
another, and so another, even ad infinitum, till I should be no less a murderer than they were in being
man-eaters, and perhaps much more so.
I spent my days now in great perplexity and
anxiety of mind, expecting that I should one day or
other fall into the hands of these merciless creatures.
And now I found to my great comfort, how happy it
was that I had provided a tame flock of goats, for I durst not, upon any account, fire my gun, especially
near that side of the island, where they usually came,
lest I should alarm the savages; and if they had fled
from me now, they would perhaps have come back
again, with a great number more, and then I knew
what to expect.
However, I wore out a year and three months
more, before I saw any of the savages; but in the
month of May, as near as I could calculate, and in
my four'-and-twentieth year, I had a very strange
encounter with them, of which in its place.
The perturbation of my mind, during this fifteen
or sixteen months' interval, was very great. In the
day great troubles overwhelmed my mind; in the
night I dreamed often of killing savages, and the
reasons why I might justify the doing of it. But, to
waive all this for a while, it was the middle of May,
on the sixteenth day, I think, that it blew a very
great storm of wind all day, with a great deal of
lightning and thunder, and a very foul night was
it. I know not what was the particular occasion of
it, but as I was reading the Bible, and taken up with
serious thoughts about my present condition, I was
surprised with the noise of a gun, as I thought, fired
at sea.
This was, to be sure, a surprise of quite a different
nature from any I had met with before, for the no-
tions this put into my thoughts were quite of another
kind. I started up in the greatest haste imaginable,
and, in a trice, clapped up my ladder to the middle
place of the rock, and pulled it after me, and mount-
ing it the second time, got to the top of the hill;
that moment a flash of fire bade me listen for a
second gun, which accordingly, in about half a
minute I heard, and, by the sound, knew that it was
from that part of the sea where I was driven out with
the current in my boat.
I immediately considered that this must be some
ship in distress, and that they had some comrade, or
some other ship in company, and fired these guns for
signals of distress, and to obtain help. I had this
presence of mind at that minute, as to think, that
though I could not help them, it may be they might
help me; BO 1 brought together all the dry wood I could get at hand, and making a good sized pile,
I set it on fire upon the hill, the wood was dry, and
blazed freely: and though the wind blew very hard,
yet it burnt fairly out, so that I was certain, if there
was any such thing as a ship, they must needs see it,
and no doubt they did, for as soon as my fire blazed
up, I heard another gun, and after that several others,
all from the same quarter. I plied my fire all night
long, till day broke, and when it was broad day, and
the air cleared up, I saw something at a great dis-
tance at sea, full east of the island, whether a sail,
or a hull, I could not distinguish, no, not with my
glasses, the distance was so great, and the weather
still being hazy also: at least it was so out at sea.
I looked frequently at it all that day, and soon
perceived that it did not move; so I presently con-
cluded that it was a ship at anchor, and being eager,
you may be sure, to be satisfied, I took my gun in
my hand, and ran towards the south-east side of the
island, to the rocks, where I had been formerly car-
ried away with the current, and getting up there, the
weather by this time being perfectly clear, I could
plainly see, to my great sorrow, the wreck of a ship
cast away in the night upon those concealed rocks,
which I found when I was out in my boat, and which
rocks, as they checked the violence of the stream,
and made a kind of counter-stream, or eddy, were
the occasion of my recovering then from the most
desperate, hopeless condition that ever I had been in.
Thus, what is one man's safety is another man's
destruction; for it seems these men, whoever they
were, being out of their knowledge, and the rocks
being wholly under water, had been driven upon them
in the night, the wUid blowing hard at E. and E.N.E.
Had they seen the island, as I must necessarily sup-
pose they did not, they must, as I thought, have en-
deavoured to have saved themselves on shore by the
help of their boat; but the firing of their guns for
help, especially when they saw, as I imagined, my
fire, filled me with many thoughts. First, I imagined
that, upon seeing my light, they might have got into
their boat, and have endeavored to make the shore,
but that the sea going very high, they might have
been cast away. Other times I imagined that they
might have lost their boat before, as might be the
case many ways; as particularly by the breaking of
the sea upon their ship, which many times obliges
men to stave, or take in pieces their boat, and some-
times to throw it overboard with their own hands.
Other times I imagined they had some other ship or
ships in company, who, upon the signals of distress
they had made, had taken them up, and carried
them off. Other times I fancied they were all
gone off to sea in their boat, and being hurried
away by the current that I had been formerly in,
were carried out into the great ocean, where there
was nothing but misery and perishing, and that they
might by this time think of starving, and of being in
a condition to eat one another.
As all these were but conjectures at best, so, in the
condition I was in, I could do no more than look upon
the misery of the poor men, and pity them, which
had still this good effect on my side, that it gave me
more and more cause to give thanks to God, who had
so happily and comfortably provided for me in my
desolate condition; and that of two ships 'companies, who were now cast away upon this part of the world,
not one life should be spared but mine. I learnt here
again to observe, that it is very_ rare the providence
of God casts us into any condition of life so low, or
any misery so great, but we may see something to be
thankful for, and may see others worse than ourselves.
Such certainly was the case of these men, of whom
I could not so much as see room to suppose any of
them were saved; nothing could make it rational, so
much as to wish or expect that they did not all perish
184 ROBINSON CRUSOE. there, except the possibility only of their being taken
up by another ship in company; and this was but
mere possibility indeed; for I saw not the least sig-
ual or appearance of any such thing.
I cannot explain by words, what a strange longing
or hankering of desires I felt in my soul upon this
sight, breaking out sometimes thus:—" O that there
had been but one or two, nay but one soul saved out
of the ship, to have escaped tome, that I might have
had one companion, one fellow-creature, to have
rken to me, and to have conversed with!" In all
time of my solitary life, I never felt so
earnest, so strong a desire, after the society of
my fellow-creatures, or so deep a regret at the
want of it.
There are some secret moving-springs in the affec-
tions, which, when they are set a-going by some ob-
ject in view, or be it some object, though not in view,
yet rendered present to the mind by the power of ima-
gination, whose motion carries out the soul by its im-
petuosity to such violent eager embracings of the
object, that the absence of it is insupportable.
Such were these earnest wishings, that but one man
had been saved. O that it had been but one! and I believe I repeated the words " O that it had been
but one!" a thousand times; and my desires were so
moved by it, that when I spoke the words, my hands
would clinch together, and my fingers press the
palms of my hands, that if I had had any thing soft
in my hand it would have crushed it; and my teeth
in my head would strike together, and set against
one another so strong, that for some time I could not
part them again.
Let the naturalists explain these things and the
reason and manner of them; all I can say is, to de-
scribe the fact, which was even surprising to me when
I found it, though I knew not from what it should
proceed; it was, doubtless, the effect of ardent wishes,
and strong ideas formed in my mind, realizing the
UUSOE. 185
comfort which the conversation of one of my fellow-
Christians would have been to me.
But it was not to be; either their fate, or mine, or
both, forbade it; for, till the last year of my being in
this island, I never knew whether any were saved
out of the ship or no; and had only the affliction,
some days after, to see the corpse of a drowned boy
washed on shore, at the end of the island, which was
next the shipwreck. He had on a seaman's waist-
coat, a pair of open knee'd linen drawers, and a blue
linen shirt: but nothing to direct me to guess what
nation he was of. He had nothing in hispocket but
two pieces of eight and a tobacco-pipe. The last was
of more value to me, than the first.
It was now calm, and I had a great mind to venture
out in my boat to this wreck, not doubting but I
might find something on board that might be useful
to me; and possibly there might be yet some living
creature on board, whose life I might not only save,
but might, by saving that life, comfort my own to
the last degree; and this thought clung so to my
heart, that I could not be quiet night or day, but I
must venture out in my boat on board this wreck;
and committing the rest to God's providence, I
thought the impression was so strong upon my mind,
that it could not be resisted, that it must come from
some invisible direction, and that I should be wanting
to myself if I did not go.
Under the power of this impression, I hastened
back to my castle, prepared every thing for my voy-
age, took a quantity of bread, a great pot of fresh
water, a compass to steer by, a bottle of rum (for I
had still a great deal of that left), a basket full of
raisins, and thus loading myself with every thing
necessary, I went down to my boat, got the water
out of her, and got her afloat, loaded all my cargo in
her, and'thenwent home againfor more. My second
cargo was a great bag full of rice, the umbrella to
set up over my head for a shade, another pot full of
fresh water, and about two dozen of my small loaves,
or barley cakes, more than before, with a bottle of
goat's milk, and a cheese; all which, with great
labour and sweat, I brought to my boat, and praying
to God to direct my voyage, I put out; and rowing
or paddling the canoe along the shore, I came at last
to the utmost point of the island, on that side, viz.
N. E. And now I was to launch out into the ocean,
and either to venture or not venture. I looked on
the rapid currents which ran constantly on both sides
of the island, at a distance, and which were very ter-
rible to me, from the remembrance of the hazard I had been in before, and my heart began to fail me;
for I foresaw, that if I was driven into either of these
currents, I should be carried a vast way out to sea,
and perhaps out of reach, or sight of the island again;
and that, as my boat was but small, if any little gale
of wind should rise, I should be inevitably lost.
These thoughts so oppressed my mind, that I began
to give over my enterprise, and having hauled my
boat into a little creek on the shore, I stepped out,
and sat me down upon a little spot of rising ground,
very pensive and anxious, between fear and desire
about my voyage; when, as I was musing, I could
perceive that the tide was turned, and the flood came
on, upon which my going was for so many hours im-
practicable. Upon this it presently occurred to me, that I should go up to the highest piece of ground I
could find, and observe, if I could, how the sets of
the tide Nor currents lay when the flood came in, that
I might judge whether, if I was driven one way out,
I might not expect to be driven another way home,
with the same rapidness of the currents. This thought
was no sooner in my head, but I cast my eye upon a
little hill, which sufficiently overlooked the sea both
ways, and from whence I had a clear view of the
currents, or sets of the tide, and which way I was to
guide myself in my return. Here I found that as the
current of the ebb set out close by the south point of
the island, so the current of the flood set in close by
the shore of the north side; and that I had nothing
to do but to keep to the north of the island in my
return, and I should do well enough.
Encouraged with this observation, I resolved the
next morning to set out with the first of the tide;
and reposing myself for that night in the canoe,
under the great watch-coat I mentioned, I launched
out in the morning. I made first a little out to sea,
full north, till I began to feel the benefit of the cur-
rent which set eastward, and which carried me at a
great rate, and yet did not so hurry me as the south-
ern side current had done before, and so as to take
from me all government of the boat; but, having a
strong steerage with my paddle, I went directly for
the wreck, and in less than two hours I came up to it.
11 was a dismal sight to look at: the ship, which
by the building was Spanish, stuck fast, jambed in
between two rocks; an the stern and quarter of her
was beaten to pieces with the sea; and as her fore-
castle, which stuck in the rocks, had run on with
great violence, her main-mast and fore-mast were
brought by the board, that is to say, broken short
off; but her bowsprit was sound, and the head and
bow appeared firm. When I came close to her, a
dog appeared upon her, who, seeing me coming,
yelped and cried; and as soon as I called him, jumped
into the sea to come to me; and I took him into the
boat, and found him almost dead for hunger and
thirst. I gave him a cake of my bread, and he eat
it like a ravenous wolf that had been starving for a
fortnight in the snow. I then gave the poor creature
some fresh water, with which, if I would have let him, he would have burst himself.
After this I went on board. The first sight I met
with was two men drowned in the cook room, or
forecastle of the ship, with their arms fast about one
another. I concluded, as is indeed probable, that
when the ship struck, it being in a storm, the sea
188 ROBINSON CRUSOE. broke so high, and so continually over her, that the
men were not able to bear it, and were stranged with
the constant rushing in of the water, as much as if
they had been under water. Besides the dog, there
was nothing left in the ship that had life, or any
goods that I could see, but what were spoiled by the
water. There were some casks of liquor, whether
wine or brandy I knew not, which lay lower in the
hold, and which, the water being ebbed out, I could
see, but they were too big to meddle with. I saw-
several chests, which I believed belonged to some of
the seamen, and I got two of them into the boat,
without examining what was in them.
Had the stern of the ship been fixed, and the fore
part broken off, I am persuaded I might have made
a good voyage; for, by what I found in these two
chests, I had room to suppose the ship had a great
deal of wealth on board; and, if I may guess by the
course she steered, she must have been bound from
Buenos Ayres, or the Rio de la Plata, in the south
part of America, beyond the Brasils, to the Havannah,
in the gulf of Mexico, and so perhaps to Spain.
I found, besides these chests, a little cask full of
liquor, of about twenty gallons, which I got into my
boat with much difficulty. There were several mus-
kets in a cabin, and a great powder-horn, with about
four pounds of powder in it; as for the muskets, I
had no occasion for them, so I left them, but took
the powder-horn. I took a fire-shovel and tongs,
which I wanted extremely; as also two little brass
kettles, a copper pot to make chocolate, and a grid-
iron; and with this cargo and the dog, I came away,
the tide beginning to make home again; and the same
evening, about an hour within night, I reached the
island again, weary and fatigued to the last degree.
I reposed that night in the boat, and in the morn-
ing I resolved to harbour what I had gotten in my
new cave, not to carry it home to my castle. After
refreshing myself, I got all my cargo on shore, and
began to examine it. The cask of liquor I found to
be a kind of rum, but not such as we had at the
Brasils, and, in a word, not at all good. But when
I came to open the chests, I found several things I wanted: for example, I found in one a fine case of
bottles, of an extraordinary kind, and filled with
cordial waters, fine, and very good: the bottles held
about three pints each, and were tipped with silver.
I found two pots of very good suecades, or sweet-
meats, so fastened on top, that the salt water had
not hurt them; and two more of the same, which the
water had spoiled. I found some very good shirts,
which were very welcome to me, and about a dozen
and a half of white linen handkerchiefs and coloured
neckcloths: the former were also very welcome, being
exceedingly refreshing to wipe my face on in a hot
day. Besides this, when I came to the till in the
chest, I found there three great bags of pieces of
eight, which held about eleven hundred pieces in all;
and in one of them, wrapt up in a paper, six doubloons
of gold, and some small bars of gold; I suppose they
might all weigh near a pound.
The other chest I found had some clothes in it, but
of little value; but by the circumstances it must have
belonged to the gunner's mate, though there was no
powder in it, but about two pounds of glazed powder
in three small flasks, kept I suppose, for charging
casion for it, it was to me as the dirt under my feet,
and I would have given it all for three or four pair of
English shoes and stockings, which were things I
greatly wanted, for I had not had a pair on my feet
for many years. I had, indeed, gotten two pair of
shoes now, which I took off the feet of the two men
whom I found drowned in the wreck; and I found
two pair more in one of the chests, which were very
welcome to me; but they were not like our English
shoes, either for ease or service, being rather what we
call pumps than shoes. 1 found in this seaman's chest
about fifty pieces of eight in royals, but no gold; I
suppose this belonged to a poorer man than the other,
which seemed to belong to some officer.
Well, however, I lugged this money home to my
cave, and laid it up, as I had done that before which
I had brought from my own ship; but it was a great
pity, as I said, that the other part of the ship had not
come to my share, for I am satisfied I might have
loaded my canoe several times with money, which, if
I had ever escaped to England, would have lain herd
safe enough till I might have come and fetched it.
Having now brought all my things on shore, and
secured them, I went back to my boat, and rowed or
paddled her along the shore to her old harbour, where
I laid her up, and made the best of my way to my old
habitation, where I found every thing safe and quiet;
So I began to repose myself, live after my old fashion,
and take care of my family affairs; and for a while
I lived easy enough, only that I was more vigilant
than I used to be, looked out oftener, and did not go
abroad so much: and if any time I did stir with any
freedom, it was always to the east part of the island,
where I was pretty well satisfied the savages never
came, and where I could go without so many precau-
tions, and such a load of arms and ammunition as I
always carried with me if I went the other way.
I lived in this condition near two years more; but
my unlucky head, that was always"to let me know it
was born to make my body miserable, was all these
two years filled with projects and designs, how, if it
were possible, I might get away from this island; for
sometimes I was for making another voyage to the
wreck, though my reason told me, that there was
nothing left there worth the hazard of my voyage;
sometimes for a ramble one way, sometimes another;
and I believe if I had got the boat that I went from
Sallee in, I should have ventured to sea.
I have been in all my circumstances, a memento
to those who are touched with that general plague
of mankind, whence, for ought I know, one half of
their miseries flow; I mean, that of not being satis-
fied with the station wherein God hath placed them.
For, not to look back upon my primitive condition,
and the excellent advice of my father, the opposition
to which was, as I may call it, my original sin, my
subsequent mistakes of the same kind have been the
means of my coming into this miserable condition:
for had that providence, which so happily had seated
me at the Brazils as a planter, blessed me with con-
fined desires, and could I have been contented to have
gone on gradually, I might have been by this time, I
mean in the time of my being in this island, one of
the most considerable planters in the Brazils; nay, I am persuaded that, by the improvements I had made
in that little time I lived there, and the increase I should probably have made if I had staid, I might
have been worth a hundred thousand moidores. And
what business had I to leave a settled fortune, a well-
stocked plantation, improving and increasing, to
turn supercargo to Guinea to fetch Negroes, when
patience and time would have so increased our
stock at home, that we could have bought them at
our own doors from those whose business it was to
fetch them, and though it had cost us something
more, yet the difference of that price was by no means
worth saving at so great a hazard.
But as this is ordinarily the fate of young heads, so
reflection upon the folly of it is generally the exer-
cise of more years, or of the dear-bought experience
of time; and so it is with me now; and yet so deep
had the mistake taken root in my temper, that I could not satisfy myself in my station, but was con-
tinually poring upon the means and possibility of my
escape from this place.
I am oow to be supposed to be retired into my
castle, after my late voyage to the wreck, my frigate
laid up, and secured under water as usual, and my
condition restored to what it was before. I had more
wealth, indeed, than I had before, but was not at all
the richer; for I had no more use for it than the In-
dians of Peru had before the Spaniards came thither.
It was one night, in the rainy season in March, the
four-and-twentieth year of my first setting foot in this
land of solitariness, I had the following dream; viz.
that as I was going out in the morning, as usual
from my castle, I saw upon the shore two canoes and
eleven savages coming to land, and that they brought
with them another savage, whom they were going to
kill, in order to eat him, when on a sudden, the savage
that they were going to kill, made his escape, and
ran for his life: and then I thought in my sleep, that
he came running into my little grove, before my for-
tification, to hide himself; and that I seeing him, and
not perceiving that the others sought him that way,
showed myself to him, and encouraged him; that he
kneeled down to me, seeming to pray to me to assist
him; upon which I showed my ladder, made him go
upon it, and carried him into my cave, and he became
my servant; and that as soon as I had got this man,
I said to myself, "Now I may venture to the main
land, for this fellow will serve me as a pilot, and tell
me what to do, and whither to go for provisions, and
whither not to go for fear of being devoured; what
places to venture into, and what to escape." I awoke
with this thought, and was under such inexpressible
impressions of joy at the prospect of my escape in
my dream, that the disappointment I felt upon coming
to myself, and finding it was no more than a dream,
were really extravagant the other way, and threw me
into a very great dejection of spirits.
Upon this, however, I made this conclusion, that
my only way to go about an attempt for an escape,
was, to try to get a savage in my possession; and, if
possible, it should be one of their prisoners, whom
they had condemned to be eaten, and should bring
hither to kill; but these thoughts still were attended
with this difficulty, that it was impossible to effect
this without attacking a whole caravan of them, and
killing them all; and this was not only a very des-
perate attempt, and might miscarry, but? on the
other hand, I had greatly scrupled the lawfulness of
it to me, and my heart trembled at the thoughts of
shedding blood, though it was for my deliverance.
However, at last, after many secret disputes with
myself, and after great perplexities about it, the eager
desire of deliverance at length mastered all the rest,
and I resolved, if possible, to get one of these savages
into my hands, cost what it would. My next thing
then was to contrive how to do it; and this indeed
was very difficult to resolve on; but as I could pitch
upon no probable means for it, so I resolved to put
myself upon the watch, to see them when they came
on shore, and leave the rest to the event, taking such
measures as the opportunity should present.
With these resolutions in my thoughts, I set my-
self upon the scout as often as possible, and indeed
so often, till I was heartily tired of it; for I waited
above a year and a half, and for a great part of that
time went out to the west end, and to the south-west
corner of the island, almost every day, to see for the
canoes, but none appeared. This was very discou-
raging, and began to trouble me much; though 1 can-
not say that it did in this case, as it had done some
time before that, viz. wear off the edge of my desire
to the thing; but the longer it seemed to be delayed,
the more eager I was for it. In a word I was not at
first more careful to shun the sight of these savages,
and avoid being seen by them, than I was now eager
to be upon them.
Besides, I fancied myself able to manage one, nay,
two or three savages, if I had them, so as to make
them entirely slaves to me, to do what I should direct
them, and to prevent their being able at any time to
do me any hurt. It was a great while that I pleased
N
myself with this affair; but nothing still presented:
all my fancies and schemes came to nothing, for no
savages came near me for a great while.
About a year and a half after I had entertained
these notions, and by long musing had, as it were,
resolved to put them into execution, I was surprised
one morning early with seeing no less than five ca-
noes, all on shore together, on my side of the island,
and the people who belonged to them all landed. The
number of them broke all my measures, for seeing so
many, and knowing that they always came four or
sometimes more, in a boat, I could not tell what to
think of it, or how to take my measures to attack
twenty or thirty men single handed, so I lay still in
my castle, perplexed and discomforted. However, I
put myself into all the same postures for an attack
that I had formerly provided, and was just ready for
action, if any thing had presented. Having waited
a good while, listening to hear if they made any noise,
at length, being very impatient, I set my guns at the
foot of my ladder, and clambered up to the top of the
hill by my two stages, as usual; standing so, how-
ever, that my head did not appear above the hill; so
that they could not perceive me by any means. I
here observed, by the help of my perspective glass,
that they were no less than thirty in number, that
they had a fire kindled, and that they had meat dres-
sed; how they cooked it, that I knew not, or what it
was: but they were all dancing in I know not how
many barbarous gestures and figures, round the fire.
While I was thus looking on them, I perceived, by
my perspective glass, two miserable wretches drag-
ged from the boats, where, it seems, they were laid
by, and were now brought out for the slaughter. I
perceived one of them immediately fall, being knocked
down, I suppose, with a club, or wooden sword, for
that was their way; and two or three others were at
work, cutting him open for their cookery, while the
other victim was left standing by himself, till they
should be ready for him. In that very moment this
poor wretch seeing himself a little at liberty, nature
inspired him with hopes of life, and he started away
from them, and ran with incredible swiftness along
the sands, directly towards me, I mean towards that
part of the coast where my habitation was.
I was dreadfully frighted (that I must acknowledge,)
when I perceived him to run my way, and especially
when, as I thought, I saw him pursued by the whole
body; and I expected that part of my dream was
coming to pass, and that he would take shelter in my
grove; but I could not depend, by any means, upon
my dream for the rest of it, viz. that the savages
would not pursue htm thither, and find him there
However, I kept my station, and my spirits began to
recover when I found that there were not above three
men that followed him; and still more was I en-
couraged, when I found that he outstripped them ex-
ceedingly in running, and gained ground of them, so
that if he could but hold out for half an hour, I saw
he would fairly get away from them all.
There was between them and my castle the creek,
which I mentioned often at the first part of my story,
when I landed my cargoes out of the ship: and this
I knew he must necessarily swim over, or the poor
wretch would be taken there; but when the savage
who was escaping, came thither, he made nothing of
it, though the tide was then up, but plunging in, he
swam through it in about thirty strokes, or there-
abouts, landed, and ran on with exceeding strength
and swiftness. When the three pursuers came to the
creek, I found that two of them could swim, but the
third could not, and that he, standing on the other
side, looked at the others, but went no farther, and
soon after went softly back again, which, as it hap-
pened, was very well for him.
I observed that the two who swam were yet twice
as long swimming over the creek, than the fellow was
that fled from them. It came now very warmly upon
N 2
my thoughts, and indeed irresistibly, that now was
my time to get me a servant, and, perhaps, a com-
panion or assistant, and that I was called plainly, by
Providence, to save this poor creature's life. I im-
mediately got down the ladders, fetched my two
guns, for they were both at the foot of the ladders,
and getting up again with the same haste to the top
of the hill, I crossed towards the sea; and, having a
very short cut, and all down hill, clapped myself in
the way between the pursuers and the pursued, hal-
looing aloud to him that fled, who, looking back, was
at first as much frighted at me, as at them; but I
beckoned with my hand to him to come back, and,
in the mean time, I slowly advanced towards the two
that followed: then rushing at once upon the fore-
most, I knocked him down with the stock of my
piece; I was loath to fire, because I would not have
the rest to hear, though at that distance it would
not have been easily heard, and being out of sight of
the smoke too, they would not have known what
to make of it. Having knocked this fellow down,
the other who followed him, stopped, as if he had
been frightened, and I advanced apace towards him;
but as I came nearer, I perceived presently he had a
bow and arrow, and was fitting it to shoot at me, so
I was then necessitated to shoot at him first, which
I did, and killed him at the first shot. The poor
savage who fled, but had stopped, though he saw
both his enemies fallen, and killed (as he thought),
yet was so frighted with the noise and fire of my
piece, that he stood stock-still, and neither came
forward nor went backward, though he seemed rather
inclined to fly still, than to come on. I hallooed again
to him, and made signs to him to come forward,
which he easily understood, and came a little way,
then stopped again, and then a little farther, arid
stopped again; and then he stood trembling, as if
he had been taken prisoner, and had just been to be
killed, as his two enemies were. I beckoned to him
again to come to me, and gave him all the signs of
encouragement that I could think of; and he came nearer and nearer, kneeling down every ten or twelve
steps, in token of acknowledgment for saving his life.
I smiled at him, and looked pleasantly, and beckoned
to him to come still nearer. At length he came close
to me, and then he kneeled down again, kissed the
ground, and, taking my foot, set it upon his head;
this, it seems, was in token of swearing to be my
slave for ever. I took him up, and made much of
him, and encouraged him all I could. But, I per-
ceived the savage whom I knocked down was not
killed, but stunned with the blow, and began to come
to himself. So I pointed to him, showing him the
savage, that he was not dead; upon this he spoke
some words to me, and though I.could not understand
them, yet I thought they were pleasant to hear, for
they were the first sound of a man's voice that I had
heard, my own excepted, for above five-and-twenty
years. But there was no time for such reflections
now. The savage who was knocked down, recovered
himself so far as to sit up upon the ground, and I
perceived that my savage began to be afraid; but
when I saw that, I presented my other piece at the
man, as if I would shoot him; upon this my savage,
for so I call him now, made a motion to me to lend
him my sword, which hung naked in a belt by my
side; so I did. He no sooner had it than he runs to
his enemy, and, at one blow, cut off his head as cle-
verly, no executioner in Germany could have done it
sooner or better; which I thought very strange for
one who, I had reason to believe, never saw a sword
in his life before, except their own wooden swords.
However, it seems, as I learned afterwards, they
make their wooden swords so sharp, so heavy, and
the wood is so hard, that they will cut off heads and
arms with them, and that at one blow too. When
he had done this, he comes laughing to me in sign
of triumph, and brought me the sword again, and
laid it down, with the head of the savage he had
killed, just before me.
He was astonished how I had killed the other
Indian, so far off; and, going to him, he stood like
one amazed, looking at him, turning him first on one
side, then on the other; looked at the wound the
bullet had made, which was in the breast, where it
had made a hole, and no great quantity of blood had
followed, but he had bled inwardly, for he was quite
dead. Then he took up his bow and arrows, and
came back, and I beckoned for us to go away, making
signs that more might come after them. Upon this,
he signed to me, that he should bury them with sand,
that they might not be seen by the rest, if they fol-
lowed; so I made signs for him to do so; he fell to
work, and had them both buried in the sand in about
a quarter of an hour. I then called him away, and
took him not to my castle, but my cave, on the far-
ther part of the island; so I did not let my dream
come to pass in that respect, viz. that he came into
my grove for shelter. Here I gave him bread, and a
bunch of raisins to eat, and a draught of water, which
he was in great distress for, by his running; and
having refreshed him, I made signs for him to go to
sleep, pointing to a place where I had laid a great
parcel of rice straw, and a blanket upon it, which I used to sleep upon myself sometimes; so the poor
creature lay down, and went to sleep.
He was a comely handsome fellow, perfectly well
made, tall, and well shaped, and, as I reckon, about
twenty-six years of age. He had a very good coun-
tenance, not a fierce and surly aspect, but seemed to
to have something very manly in his face, and yet he
had all the sweetness and softness of an European in
his countenance too, especially when he smiled. His
hair was long and black, not curled like wool, his
forehead very high and large, and a great vivacity
and sparkling sharpness in his eyes. The colour of
his skin was not quite black, but very tawny, and yet
not of an ugly, yellow, nauseous tawny, as the Bra-
zilians, and Virginians, and other natives of America
are, but of a bright kind of a dun olive color, that
had in it something very agreeable, though not very
easy to describe. His face was round and plump,
his nose small, not flat like the Negroes, a very good
mouth, thin lips, and his teeth fine, well set, and
white as ivory. After he had slumbered about half
an hour, he waked, and came out of the cave to me,
for I had been milking the goats in the enclosure just
by. When he espied me, he came running, and laid
himself on the ground again, with all the possible
signs of an humble, thankful disposition, making
many antic gestures to show it. At last he lays his
head flat upon the ground, close to my foot, and sets
my other foot upon his head, as he had done before,
and after this, made all the signs to me of subjection,
servitude. and submission imaginable, to let me know
how much he would serve me as long as he lived. I
understood him in many things, and let him know I was well pleased with nun. In a little time I began
to speak to him, and teach him to speak to me; and
first, made him know his name should be Friday,
which was the day I saved his life. I likewise
taught him to say," Master," and then let him know
that was to be my name. I also taught him to say,
"Yes," and " No, and to know the meaning of them.
I gave him some milk in an earthen pot, and some
bread, and let him see me drink some before him,
and sop my bread in it, which he quickly imitated,
and made signs that it was very good for him.
I kept there with him all that night; but assoon
as it was day, I took him away with me. As we
went by the place where we had buried the two men,
he pointed exactly to the spot, and showed me the
marks he had made to find them again, making signs
to me that we should dig them up and eat them: at
this I appeared very angry, expressed my abhorrence
of it, made as if I would vomit at the thoughts of it,
and beckoned with my hand to him to come away,
which he immediately did, with great submission.
I then led him to the top of the hill, to see if his ene-
mies were gone, and pulling out my glass, I looked,
and saw plainly the place where they had been, but
no appearance of them, or their canoes; so they were
quite gone.
I then took my man Friday with me, giving him
the sword in his hand, with the bow and arrows at
his back, which I found he could use very dextrously,
making him carry one gun for me, and I two for
myself, and away we marched to the place where
these creatures had been. When I came there, my
very blood ran chill in my veins, and my heart sunk
within me at the horror of the spectacle. Indeed it
was a dreadful sight; the place was covered with
human bones, the ground dyed with the blood, great
pieces of flesh left here and there, half eaten, man-
gled, and scorched, and, in short, all the tokens of
the triumphant feast they had been making there,
after a victory over their enemies. I saw three
skulls, five hands, and the bones of three or four legs
and feet, and abundance of other parts of the bodies;
and Friday, by his signs, made me understand, that
they brought over four prisoners to feast upon, that
three of them were eaten, and that he, pointing to
himself, was the fourth; that there had been a great
battle between them and their next king, whose sub-
jects it seems he had been one of, and that they had
taken a great number of prisoners, all of which were
carried to several places by those that had taken
them in the fight, in order to feast upon them, as was
done here by these wretches.
1 caused "Friday to gather all the bones and flesh
that remained, and lay them together in a heap, and
burn them to ashes. I found that he had still an
hankering stomach after the flesh, and was still a
cannibal in his nature, butl displayed such abhorrence
at the very thoughts of it, that he durst not discover
it; for I let him know that I would kill him if he
offered it.
When we had done this, we came back to our
castle, where I gave Friday first of all a pair of linen
drawers, which I had out of the poor gunner's chest
I found in the wreck, and which, with a little altera-
tion, fitted him very well; then I made him a jerkin
of goat's skin. as well as I was able; and I gave him
a cap, which I had made of a hare's skin ; and thus he
was dressed, for the present, tolerably well; and
mighty well was he pleased to see himself almost as
well clothed as his master. He went awkwardly in
these things at first; wearing the drawers was very
awkward to him, and the sleeves of the jerkin galled
bis shoulders, and the inside of his arms; but he
soon got used to them.
The next day after I came home to my hut with
him, I began to consider where I should lodge him;
so I made a little tent for him in the vacant place
between the two fortifications, in the inside of the
last, and in the outside of the first; and as there was
an en trance there into my cave, I madeaformal framed
door-case, and a door to it of boards, and set it up in
the passage, a little within the entrance, and causing
the door to open in the inside, I barred it up in the
night, taking in my ladders too; so that Friday
could no way come at me in the inside of my
innermost wall, without making so much noise in
getting over, that it must needs awaken me, for my
first wall had now a complete roof over it of long
poles, covering all my tent, and leaning up to the
side of the hill, which was again laid across with
small sticks instead of laths, and then thatched over
a great thickness with the rice straw, which was
strong like reeds; and at the hole or place which
was left to go in or out by the ladder, I had placed
a kind oftrap-door, which, if it had been attempted
on the outside, would not have opened at all, but
would have fallen down, and made a great noise. 1
took care to take all the weapons into my side every
night.
But I needed none of these precautions, for never
was a more faithful, loving, sincere servant than
Friday was to me; without passions, sullenness, or
designs; his very affections were tied to me, like
those of a child to its father, and, I dare say, he
would have sacrificed his life for the saving of my
own, upon any occasion whatever.
This frequently gave me occasion to observe, and
that with wonder, that however it had pleased God
in his providence, and in the government of the works
of his hands, to take from so great a part of the world
of his creatures the best uses to which their facul-
ties, and the powers of their souls are adapted, yet
that he has bestowed upon them the same powers,
the same reason, the same affections, the same senti-
ments of kindness and obligation, the same passions
and resentments of wrongs, the same sense of grati-
tude, sincerity, fidelity, and all the capacities of doing
good, and receiving good, that he has given to us;
and that when he pleases to offer them occasions of
exerting these, they are as ready, nay, more ready,
to apply them to the right uses for which they were
bestowed, than we are. And this made me very
melancholy sometimes, in reflecting, as the several
occasions presented, how mean a use we make of all
these, even though we have these powers enlightened
by the great lamp of instruction, the Spirit of God,
and by the knowledge of his Word, added to our
understanding; and why it has pleased God to hide
the like saving knowledge from so many millions of
souls, who, if I might judge by this poor savage,
would make a much better use of it than we did.
From hence I sometimes was led too far to invade
the sovereignty of Providence, and, as it were, arraign
the justice of so arbitrary a disposition of things, that
should hide that light from some, and reveal it to
others, and yet expect a like duty from both. But I checked my thoughts with this conclusion; first,
that we did not know by what light and law these
should be condemned; but that God was necessarily,
and by the nature of his being, infinitely holy and
just; so it could not be, but that if these creatures
were all sentenced to absence from himself, it was on
account of sinning against that light, which, as the
Scripture says, was a law to themselves, and by such
rules as their consciences would acknowledge to be
just, though the foundation was not discovered to us:
and secondly, that still, as we are all clay in the
hand of the potter, no vessel could say to him, "Why
has thou formed me thus?"
But to return to my new companion: I was greatly
delighted with him, and made it my business to teach
him every thing that was proper and useful, and
especially to make him speak, and understand me
when I spoke: and he was a very apt scholar, and
he was so merry, so diligent, and so pleased when he
could understand me, or make me understand him,
that it was very pleasant for me to talk to him.
And now my life began to be very easy and happy.
After I had been two or three days returned to my
castle, I thought, that in order to bring Friday off
from his horrid way of feeding, and from the relish
of a cannibal's stomach, I ought to let him taste
other flesh. So I took him out with me one morn-
ing to the woods, and I saw a she-goat lying down
in the shade, and two young kids close by Tier. I
catched hold of Friday; "Hold," said I; "stand
still;" and made signs to him not to stir: immedi-
ately I presented my piece, shot, and killed one of
the kids. The poor creature, who had, at a distance
indeed, seen me kill the savage, his enemy, but did
not know, nor could imagine, how it was done, was
sensibly surprised, trembled, and shook, and looked
so amazed, that I thought he would have sunk down.
He did not see the kid I had shot at, nor perceive I
had killed it, but ripped up his waistcoat to feel if he
was not wounded; and, as I found, thought I was
resolved to kill him; for he came and kneeled down
to me, and embracing my knees, said a great many
things I did not understand, but I could see that his
meaning was to pray to me not to kill him.
I soon found a way to convince him that I would
do him no harm; and, taking him up by the hand,
laughed at him, and pointing to the kid I had killed,
beckoned to him to run and fetch it, which he did;
and while he was looking to see how the creature
was killed, I loaded my gun again, and by and bye I saw a great fowl, like a hawk, sit upon a tree within
shot; so, to let Friday understand a little what I would do, I called him to me again, pointing at the
fowl, which was a parrot, though I thought it had
been a hawk; I say, pointing to the parrot and to
my gun, and to the ground under the parrot, to let
him see I would make him fall. I made him under-
stand that I would shoot and kill that bird: accord-
ingly I fired, and bade him look, and immediately he
saw the parrot fall. He stood like one frightened
again, notwithstanding all I had said to him; and I found he was the more amazed, because he did not
see me put any thing into the gun; but thought
there must be some wonderful fund of death and
destruction in that thing, able to kill man, beast,
bird, or any other thing, near or far off; and I be-
lieve, if I would have let him, he would have wor-
shipped me and my gun: As for the gun itself, he
would not so much as touch it for several days after,
but would speak to it, and talk to it, as if it had an-
swered him, which, as I afterwards learned of him,
was to desire it not to kill him.
Well, after his astonishment was a little over at
this, I pointed io him to run and fetch the bird I had
shot, which he did, but staid some time, for the par-
rot, not being quite dead, was fluttered a good way
off from the place where she fell. However, he found
her, took her up, and brought her to me; and, as I
had perceived his ignorance about the gun before, I
took this advantage to charge the gun again, and not
let him see me do it, that I might be ready for any
other mark, but nothing offered at that time. So I
brought home the kid, and the same evening took
the skin off, and cut it up as well as I could; and
having a pot for that purpose, I boiled or stewed
some of the flesh, and made some very good broth:
after I had begun to eat some, I gave some to my
man, who seemed very glad of it, and liked it very
well; but that which was strangest to him was to
see me eat salt with it. He made a sign to me that
the salt was not good to eat, and putting a little into
his own mouth, he seemed to nauseate it, and would
spit and sputter at it, washing his mouth with fresh
water after it: on the other hand, I took some meat
in my mouth without salt, and I pretended to spit
and sputter for want of salt, as fast as he had done
at it, but it would not do.
Having thus fed him with boiled meat and broth,
I was resolved to feast him the next day with roast-
ing a piece of the kid; this I did by hanging it before
the fire in a string, as I had seen many people do in
England, setting two poles up, one on each side of
the fire, and one across the top, and tying the string
to the cross stick, letting the meat turn continually.
This Friday admired much; but when he came to
taste the flesh, he took so many ways to tell me how
well he liked it, that I could not but understand
him; and at last he told me he would never eat man's
flesh any more, which I was very glad to hear.
The next day I set him to work to beating some
corn out, and sifting it in the manner I used to do;
and he soon understood how to do it as well as I,
especially after he had seen what the meaning of it
was, and that it was to make bread of; for after that
I let him see me make my bread, and bake it too;
and in a little time Friday was able to do all the
work for me as well as I could do it myself.
206 ROBINSON CRUSOE. I began now to consider that having two mouths
to feed instead of one, I must provide more ground
for my harvest, and plant a larger quantity of corn
than I used to do, so I marked out a larger piece of
land, and began the fence in the same manner as
before, in which Friday not only worked very hard,
but very cheerfully; and 1 told him that it was for
corn to make more bread, because he was now with
me, and that I might have enough for him and my-
self too. He appeared very sensible of that part, and
let me know that he would work the harder for me
me if I would tell him what to do.
This was the pleasantest year of all the life I led
in this place. Friday began to talk pretty well, and
Hnderstand the names of almost every thing I had
occasion to call for, and of every place I had occasion
to send him to, and talk a great deal to me; so that,
in short, I began to have some use for my tongue
again. Besides the pleasure of talking to him, I had
a singular satisfaction in the fellow himself: his sim-
ple, unfeigned honesty appeared to be more and more
every day, and I began really to love the creature;
and I believe he loved me as much as possible.
I had a mind once to try if he had any hankering
inclination to his own country; and having learned
him English so well, that he could answer me almost
any questions, I asked him whether the nation that
he belonged to never conquered in battle. At which
he smiled, and said, "Yes, yes; we always fight the
better:" that is, he meant, always get the better in
fight: and so we began the following discourse:—
"You always fight the better!" said I; "how came
you to be taken prisoner then, Friday?"
Friday.—My nation beat much for all that.
Master.—How beat? If your nation beat them,
how came you to be taken?
Friday.—They more than my nation in the place
where me was: they take one, two, three, and me.
My nation over-beat them in yonder place, where me
no was; there my nation take one, two, great
thousand.
Matter.—But why did not your side recover you
from the hands of your enemies then?
Friday.—They run one, two, three, and me, and
make go in the canoe: my nation have no canoe
that time.
Master.—Well, Friday, and what does your nation
do with the men they take? Do they carry them
away and eat them, as these did?
Friday.—Yes, my nation eat mans too, eat all up.
Master.—Where do they carry them?
Friday.—Go to other place, where they think.
Master.—Do they come hither?
Friday.—Yes, yes, they come hither: come other
else place.
Master.—Have you been here with them?
Friday.—Yes, I been here. (Points to the N. W.
side of the island, which it seems was their side.)
By this I understood that my man Friday had
formerly been among the savages, who had used to
come on shore on the farther parts of the island, on
the said man-eating occasions that he had been now
brought for: and some time after, when I took cou-
rage to carry him to that side, he presently knew the
placer and told me he was there once when they eat
up twenty men, two women, and one child.
After I had had this discourse with him, I asked
him how far it was from our island to the shore:
whether the canoes were not often lost? He told
me that there was no danger, no canoes ever lost;
but that, after a little way out to sea, there was a
a current, and a wind always one way in the morn-
ing, the other in the afternoon.
This I thought to be no more than the sets of
the tide, as going out or coming in; but I afterwards
understood it was occasioned by the great draught
and reflux of the mighty river Oronoque; in the
mouth of which river, as I thought afterwards, our
island lay; and that this land, which 1 perceived
to the W. and N. \V., was the great island Tri-
nidad, on the north point of the mouth of the
river. 1 asked Friday a thousand questions about
the country, the inhabitants, the sea, the coast, and
what nations were near: he told me all he knew,
with the greatest openness imaginable. I asked
him the names of the several nations of his sort of
people, but could get no other name than Caribs;
from whence I easily understood that these were the
Caribbees, which our maps place on that part of
America which reaches from the mouth of the river
Oroonoque to Guiana, and onwards to St. Martha.
He told me that up a great way beyond the moon,
which must be west from their country, there dwelt
white, bearded men, like me, and pointed to my great
whiskers, which 1 mentioned before, and that they
had killed "much mans," that was his word. By
all which I understood he meant the Spaniards,
whose cruelties in America had been spread over
whole countries, and were remembered by all the
nations from father to son.
I inquired if he could tell me how I might come
from this island, and get among those white men?
He told me yes, yes, I might go in " two canoe." 1
could not understand what he meant by" two canoe,"
till at last, with difficulty, 1 found he meant that it
must be a large boat, as big at> two canoes.
This part of Friday's discourse began to relish with
me very well; and from this time 1 entertained some
hopes that, one time or other, I might find an oppor-
tunity to make my escape from this place, and that
this poor savage might be a means to help me to do it.
1 was now wanting to lay a foundation of religious
knowledge in Friday's mind; particularly I asked
him one time who made him. The poor creature did
not understand me, but thought 1 had asked him
who was his father. But 1 took it another way, and
asked him who made the sea, the ground he walked
ROBINSON i 11USOB- -Jill
on, and the hills and woods. He told me it was one
old Benamuckee, that lived beyond all. He could
describe nothing of this great person, but that he was
very old; much older, he said, than the sea or the land, than the moon or the stars. I asked him then.
if this person had made all things, why did not all
things worship him. He looked very grave, and
with a perfect look of innocence said, "All things
said O to him." I asked him if the people who die
in his country went away any where. He said, yes,
they all went to Benamuckee. Then I asked him
whether those they eat up went thither too: he said,
"Yes."
From these things I began to instruct him in the
knowledge of the true God. I told him, that the
great Maker of all things lived up there, pointing up
towards heaven: that he governs the world by the
same power and providence by which he had made
it: that he was omnipotent, could do every thing for
us, give every thing to us, take every thing from us:
and I 1ms. by degrees, I opened his eyes. He listened
with great attention, and received with pleasure the
notion of Jesus Christ being sent to redeem us, and of
the manner of making our prayers to God, and his
being" able to hear us, even into heaven. He told me
one day, that if our God could hear us up beyond the
sun, he must needs be a greater God than their Be-
namuckee, who lived but a little way off', and yet
could not hear till they went up to the great moun-
tains where he dwelt, to speak to him. I asked him
if ever he went thither to speak to him: he said, no;
they never went that were young men; none went
thither but the old men, whom he called their
Oowokakee, that is, as I made him explain it to me,
their religious, or clergy; and that they went to say
O (so he called saying prayers,) and then came back,
and told them what Bemimuckee said. By this I
observed that there is priestcraft even amongst the
most blinded ignorant Pagans in the world.
I endeavoured to clear up this fraud to my man
Friday, and told him, that the pretence of their old
men going up to the mountains to say O! to their
god Benamuckee, was a cheat; and their bringing
word from thence what he said, was much more, so;
that if they met with any answer, or spoke with any
one there, it must be an evil spirit: and then I en-
tered into a long discourse with him about the devil,
the original of him, his rebellion against God, his enmity to man, the reason of it, his setting himself
up in the dark parts of the world to be worshipped
instead of God, and as God, and the many stratagems
he made use of to delude mankind to their ruin: how
he had a secret access to our passions, and to our
affections, to adapt his snares so to our inclinations,
as to cause us even to be our own tempters, and to
run upon our own destruction, by our own choice.
I found it was not so easy to imprint right notions
in his mind about the devil, as it was about the being
of a God. Nature assisted all my arguments to
evidence to him even the necessity of a great First
Cause, and over-ruling, governing power, a secret,
directing Providence, and of the equity and justice
of paying homage to him that made us; but there
appeared nothing of all this in the notion of an evil
spirit, of his original, his being, his nature, and, above all, of his inclination to do evil, and to draw us in to
do so too. And the poor creature puzzled me once
in such a manner, by a question merely natural and
innocent, that I scarce knew what to say to him. I
had been talking a great deal to him of the power of
God, his omnipotence, his dreadful aversion to sin,
his being a consuming fire to the workers of iniquity;
how, as he had made us all, he could destroy us, and
all the world, in a moment; and he listened with
great seriousness to me all the while. After this, I
had been telling him how the devil was God's enemy
in the hearts of men, and used all his malice and skill
to defeat the good designs of Providence, and to mm
the kingdom of Christ in the world, and the like:—
"Well," says Friday, " but you say God is so strong,
so great, is he not much strong, much might, as the
devil ?—" Yes, yes," said I, " Friday, God is stronger
than the devil, God is above the devil, and therefore
we pray to God to tread him under our feet, and
enable us to resist his temptations, and quench his
fiery darts."—" But, says he again, "if God much
strong, much might, as the devil, why God not kill
the devil, so make him no more wicked?"
I was strangely surprised at his question, and after
all, though I was now an old man, yet I was but a
young doctor, and ill enough qualified for a casuist,
or a solver of difficulties. However, after a pause, I
said, " God will at last punish him severely; he is
reserved for the judgment, and is to be cast into the
bottomless pit, to dwell with everlasting fire." This
did not satisfy Friday; but he repeats my words,
"Reserve at last? me no understand. But why not
kill the devil not kill great ago?"—" You may as well
ask me," said 1, "why God does not kill you and
me, when we do wicked things here that offend him;
we are preserved to repent and be pardoned." He
muses a while at this;—" Well, well," says he, " that
well; so you, I, devil, all wicked, all preserve, re-
pent, God pardon all." Here I was run down again
by him to the last degree, and it was a testimony to
me, how the mere notions of nature, though they will
guide reasonable creatures to the knowledge of a
God, and of a worship or homage due to the supreme
being of God, as the consequence of our nature; yet
nothing but divine revelation can form the knowledge
of Jesus Christ, and of a redemption purchased for
us, of a Mediator of a new covenant, and of an Inter-
cessor at the footstool of God's throne; and that,
therefore, the Gospel of our Lord and Saviour Jesus
Christ, I mean the Word of God, and the Spirit of
God, promised for the guide and sanctifier of his
people, are the absolutely necessary instructors of
o 2
the souls of men in the saving knowledge of God, and
the means of salvation.
I therefore diverted the present discourse between
me and my man, rising up hastily, as upon some
sudden occasion of going out, then sending him for
something a great way off, I seriously prayed to God
that he would enable me to instruct this poor savage,
assisting by his Spirit the heart of the poor ignorant
creature to receive the light of the knowledge of God
in Christ, reconciling him to himself, and would
guide me to speak so to him from the Word of God,
as his conscience might be convinced, his eyes opened,
and his soul saved. When he came again to me, I
entered into a long discourse with him upon the sub-
ject of the redemption of man, by the Saviour of the
world, and of the doctrine of the Gospel preached
from heaven, viz. of repentance towards God, and
faith in our blessed Lord Jesus. I then explained to
him, as well as I could, why our blessed Redeemer
took not on him the nature of angels, but the seed
of Abraham, and how, for that reason, the fallen an-
gels had no share in the redemption, that he came only
to the lost sheep of the house of Israel, and the like.
I had, God-knows, more sincerity than knowledge,
in all the methods I took for this poor creature's in-
struction, andmustaeknowledge what Ibelieveall that
act upon the same principle will find, that, in laying
things open to him, I really informed and instructed
myself in many things that I either did not know or
had not fully considered before, but which occurred
naturally to my mind, upon my searching into them
for the information of this poor savage: and I had
more affection in my inquiry after things upon this
occasion than ever I felt before; so that whether
this poor wild wretch was the better for me or no, I
had great reason to be thankful that ever he came to
me; my grief sat lighter upon me, my habitation
grew comfortable to me beyond measure, and when
I reflected, that, in this solitary life which I had been
confined to, I had not only been moved myself to
look up to heaven, and to seek to the Hand that
brought me thither, but was now to be made an in-
strument, under Providence, to save the life, and for
aught I knew, the soul, of a poor savage, and bring
him to the true knowledge of religion, and of the
Christian doctrine, that he might know Christ Jesus,
"to whom is life eternal."
In this thankful frame I continued all the remainder
of^my time, and the conversation which employed
the hours between Friday and me was such as made
the three years, which we lived there together per-
fectly and completely happy, if any such thing as
complete happiness can be found in a sublunary
state. The savage was now a good Christian, a much
better than I, though I have reason to hope, and
bless God for it, that we were equally penitent, and
comforted restored penitents. We had here the
Word of God to read, and no farther off from his
Spirit to instruct than if we had been in England.
I always applied myself to reading the Scriptures,
and to let him know, as well as I could, the meaning
of what I read.
After Friday and I became more intimately ac-
quainted, and that he could understand almost all I said to him, and speak fluently, though in broken
English, to me, I acquainted him with my history.
I let him into the mystery of gunpowder and bullets,
and taught him how to shoot. I gave him a knife,
which he was wonderfully delighted with, and I made him a belt with a frog hanging to it, such as
in England we wear hangers in, and in the frog, in-
stead of a hanger, I gave him a hatchet.
I described to him the countries of Europe, and
particularly England, which I came from; how we
lived, how we worshipped God, how we behaved to
one another, and how we traded in ships to all parts
of the world. I gave him an account of the wreck
which I had been on board of, and showed him, as
near as I could, the place where she lay; but she
had been all gone long ago.
I showed him the ruins of our boat, which we lost
when I escaped, and which was now fallen almost to
pieces. Upon seeing this boat, Friday stood musing
some time, and said nothing. I asked him what he
studied upon, at last, says he, "Me see such boat
like come to place at my nation."
I did not understand him a good while; but, at
last, when I had examined farther into it, I under-
stood by him, that a boat, such as that had been,
came on shore upon the country where he lived;
that is, as he explained it, was driven thither by
stress of weather. I presently imagined, that some
European ship must have been cast away upon their
coast, and the boat might get loose, and drive ashore;
but was so dull that I never once thought of men
making their escape from a wreck thither, much less
whence they might come, so I only inquired after a
description of the boat.
Friday described the boat to me well enough: but
brought me better to understand him when he added,
with some warmth, "We save the white mans from
drown." Then I presently asked him if there were
any white mans, as he called them, in the l>oat:
"Yes," he said, "the boat full of white mans." I
asked him, "How many?" He told me upon his
fingers seventeen. I asked him "What became of
them?" He told me, "They live, they dwell at
my nation."
This put new thoughts into my head again, for I
Presently imagined, that these might be the men be-
mging to the ship that was cast away in sight of
my island, and who, after the ship was struck on the
rock, and they saw her inevitably lost, had saved
themselves in their boat, and were landed upon that
wild shore among the savages.
Upon this, I inquired of him more critically, what
was become of them; he assured me they still lived
there, that they had been there about four years,
that the savages let them alone, and gave them vic-
tuals to live. I asked him, how it came to pass that
they did not kill them, and eat them. He said,
"No, they make brother with them," that is, as I understood him, a truce; and then he added, "They
no eat mans, but when make the war fight;" that is
to say, they never eat any men, but such as come to
fight with them, and are taken in battle.
i t was after this, some considerable time, that being
on the top of the hill, at the east side of the island,
from whence I had, in a clear day, discovered the
main or continent of America, Friday, the weather
being very serene, looks very earnestly towards the
main land, and, in a kind of surprise, falls a j umping
and dancing, and calls out to me; I asked him
what was the matter. "O joy," says he, "O glad!
There see my country! there my nation!"
I observed an extraordinary sense of pleasure
appeared in his face, his eyes sparkled, and his
countenance discovered a strange eagerness, as if he
had a mind to be in his own country again; and this
observation of mine put a great many thoughts into
me, which made me at first not so easy about my
new man Friday as I was before; and I made no
doubt, but that if Friday could get back to his own
nation again, he would not only forget all his religion,
but all his obligation to me.
But I wronged the poor honest creature very much,
for which I was very sorry for afterwards; however,
as my jealousy increased, and held me some weeks,
I was a little more circumspect, and not so familiar
and kind to him as before, in which I was certainly
in the wrong.
Whilst my jealousy of him lasted, I was every day
pumping him to see if he would discover any of the
new thoughts, which I suspected were in him; but
I found every thing he said was honest, and so inno-
cent, that I could find nothing to nourish my suspi-
eion, and, in spite of all my uneasiness, he made me
at last entirely his own again; nor did he in the
least perceive that I was uneasy, and therefore I could not suspect him of deceit.
One day, walking up the same hill, but the weather
being hazy at sea, so that we could not see the con-
tinent, I called to him, and said, " Friday, do not you
wish yourself in your own country, your own nation?"
"Yes," he said, "I be much glad to be at my own
nation."—i'What would you do there?" said I,
"would you turn wild again, eat man's flesh again,
and be savage as you were before?" He looked full
of concern, and shaking his head, said, "No, no;
Friday tell them to live good, tell them to pray God,
tell them to eat corn-bread, cattle-flesh, milk; no
eat man again." —" Why, then," said I to him, " they
will kill you." He looked grave at that, and then
said, " No, they no kill me; they willing love learn."
He meant by this, they would be willing to learn; he
added, they learned much of the bearded mans that
came in the boat. Then I asked him if he would go
back to them. He smiled at that, and told me he
could not swim so far. I told him I would make a
canoe for him. He told me he would go, if I would
go with him. "I go," said I , "why they will eat
me if I come there."—" No, no," said he, " me make
them no eat you; me make they much love you."
He meant he would tell them how I had killed his
enemies, and saved his life, and so he would make
them much love me.
From this time, I confess, I had a mind to venture
over, and see if I could possibly join with these
bearded men, who, I made no doubt, were Spaniards
or Portuguese; not doubting but, if I could, we
might find some method to escape from thence, being
upon the continent, and a good company together,
better than I could from an island, forty miles off
the shore, and alone without help. So after some
days, I took Friday to work again, by way of di*,
course, and told him, I would give him a boat to go
back to his own nation; ana accordingly carried
him to my frigate, which lay on the other side of the
island, and having cleared it of the water, I brought
it out, showed it him, and we both went into it.
I found he was very dextrous at managing it,
and would make it go almost as swift again as I could; so I said to him, "Well, now, Friday, shall
we go to your nation?" He looked very dull at my
saying so, which, it seems, was because he thought
the boat was too small to go so far. I told him then I had a bigger; so the next day I went to the place
where the first boat lay, which I had made, but
which I could not get into the water. He said that
was big enough; but as I had taken no care of it, and
it had lain two or three-and-twenty years there, the
sun had split and dried it, that it was in a manner
rotten. Friday told me that such a boat would do
very well, and would carry "much enough vittle,
drink, bread;" that was his way of talking.
Upon the whole, I was by this time so fixed upon
my design of going over with him to the continent,
that I told him we would go and make one as big as
that, and he should go home in it. He answered
not one word, but looked very grave and sad: I
asked him what was the matter with him. He asked
me train thus, "Why you angry mad with Friday?
What me done?" I asked him what he meant: I told him I was not angry with him at all. "No
angry! no angry!" says he, repeating the words
several times, "why send Friday home away to my
nation ?"—" Why," said I, " Friday, did you not say
you wished you were there 1"—" Yes, yes," says he,
"wish we both there; no wish Friday there, no mas-
ter there." In a word, he would not think of going
there without me. "I go there, Friday!" said I,
"what should I do there 1" He turned very quick
upon me at this—" You do great deal much good,"
says he, "you teach wild mans be good, sober, tame
mans: you tell them know God, pray God, and live
new life."—"Alas, Friday, said I, "thou knowest
not what thou sayest, I am but an ignorant man myself."—"Yes, yes," says he, "you teachee me
good, you teachee them good."—" No, no, Friday,"
said I, "you shall go without me; leave me here to
live by myself, as I did before." he looked confused
at this, and running to one of the hatchets which he
used to wear, he takes it up hastily, and gives it me.
"What must I do with this 1" said I to him. "You
take kill Friday," says he. "What must I kill you
for?" said I again. He returns very quick, "What
you send Friday away for? Take kill Friday; no
send Friday away." As he spoke, tears stood in his
eyes, and I was so affected, that I said I would never
send him away, if he was willing to stay with me.
I found that all the foundation of his desire to go
to his own country was laid in his ardent affection to
the people, and his hopes of my doing them good: a
thing, which as I had no notion of myself, so I had
not the least thought, or intention, or desire of un-
dertaking it. But still I found a strong inclination
to attempting an escape, as above, founded on the
supposition gathered from the former discourse, viz.
that there were seventeen bearded men there; and
therefore. without any more delay, I went to work
with Friday, to find out a great tree proper to fell,
and make a large periagua, or canoe, for the voyage.
After searching some time, Friday at last pitched
upon a tree, for I found he knew much better than I
what kind of wood was fittest for it; nor can I tell,
to this day, what wood to call the tree we cut down,
except Jhat it was very like the tree we call fustic,
or between that and the Nicaragua wood, for it was
much of the same colour and smell. Friday was for
burning the hollow or cavity of this tree out, to make
it into a boat, but I showed him how rather to cut it
out with tools, which after I showed him how to use,
he did it very handily, and in about a month's hard
lnbmir we finished it, and made it very handsome,
especially when with our axes, which I showed him
how to handle, we cut and hewed the outside into the
true shape of a boat. After this, however, it cost us
near a fortnight's time to get her along, as it were,
inch by inch, upon great rollers, into the water; but
when she was in, she would have carried twenty
men with ease.
It amazed me to see with what dexterity, and how
swift my man Friday would manage her, turn her,
and paddle her along. So I asked him, if he would,
and if we might venture over in her. "Yes," lie said,
"me venture over in her very well, though great
blow wind." However, I had a farther design that
he knew nothing of, and that was to make a mast
and a sail, and to fit her with an anchor and cable.
As to the mast, that was easy enough to get, so I
pitched upon a straight young cedar tree, which I found near the place, and which there was plenty of
in the island; and I set Friday to work to cut it
down, and gave him directions how to shape and
order it: but as to the sail, that was my particular
care. I knew I had pieces of old sails, but as I had
had them now twenty-six years by me, and not being
very careful to preserve them, they were nearly all
rotten. However, I found two pieces which appeared
pretty good, and with a great deal of pains, and
awkward tedious stitching, for want of needles, I at
length made a three-cornered ugly thing, like what
we call in England a shoulder-of-'mutton sail, to go
with a boom at bottom, and a little short sprit at the
top, such as usually our ships' long-boats sail with,
and such as I best knew how to manage, because it
was such a one as I used in the boat in whiclp[ made
my escape from Barbary.
'l was near two months in rigging and fitting out
my mast and sails, for I fitted them very complete,
making a small stay, and a sail, or fore-sail to it, to
assist, if we should turn to windward; and, which
was more than all, I fixed a rudder to the stern of her,
to steer with, and though I was but a bungling ship-
wright, yet as I knew the usefulness and even neces-
sity of such a thing, I applied myself with so much
pains to do it, that at last I brought it to pass.
After all this was done, I had my UUHI Friday to
teach as to what belonged to the navigation of my
boat, for though he knew very well how to paddle
the canoe, he knew nothing what belonged to a sail
and a rudder, and how the sail gibbed, and filled this
way or that way, as the course we sailed changed; I say, when he saw this, he stood like one astonished
and amazed. However, with a little use, I made all
these things familiar to him, and he became an expert
sailor, except that as to the compass, I could make
him understand very little of that; but there was
not much occasion for the compass, in these parts.
I was now entered on the seven-and-twentieth
year of my captivity in this place; though the three
last years that I had this creature with me oujjht
rather to be left out of the account, my habitation
being quite of another kind, than in all the rest of the
time. I kept the anniversary of my landing here
with the same thankfulness to God for his mercies as
at first; and if I had such cause of acknowledgment
at first, I had much more so now, having such addi-
tional testimonies of the care of Providence over me,
and the great hopes I had of being effectually and
speedily delivered; for I had an invincible impression
upon my thoughts that my deliverance was at hand,
and that I should not be another year in this place.
However, I went on with all my work, as usual.
The »rainy season was, in the mean time upon me,
when kept more within doors than at other times;
BO I had stowed our new vessel as secure as we could,
bringing her up into the creek, where, as I said in
the beginning, I landed my rafts from the ship: and
thus we waited for the months of November and De-
cember, in which I designed to make my adventure.
When the settled season began to come in, the first
thing I did was to lay by a certain quantity of pro-
visions, being the stores for our voyage; and I in-
tended in a week or a. fortnight's time to open the
dock, and launch out our boat. I was busy one morn-
ing upon something of this kind, when I called to
Friday, and bade him go to the sea-shore, and see if
he could find a turtle or tortoise,, a thing which we
generally got once a week, for the sake of the eggs
as well as the flesh. Friday had not been long gone,
when he came running back, and flew over my out-
ward wall, or fence, like one that felt not the ground;
and before I had time to speak to him, he cried out
to me, " O master! O master! O sorrow! O bad!"—
"What's the matter, Friday?" said I. "O yonder
there," says he^ "one, two, three canoe! one, two,
three!" By this way of speaking, I concluded there
were six; but, on inquiry, I found there were but
three. "Well, Friday," said 1, "do not be fright-
ened;" So I heartened him up as well as I could.
However, I saw the poor fellow was most terribly
seared, for nothing ran in his head but that they
were come to look for him, and would cut him in
pieces, and eat him; and the poor fellow trembled
so, that I scarce knew what to do with him. I com-
forted him as well as I could, and told him I was in
as much danger as he, and that they would eat me
as well as him. "But," said I, "Friday, we must
resolve to fight them. Can you fight, Friday?"—
"Me shoot, says he, " but there come many great
number."—" No matter for that," said I again, " our
guns will fright them, that we do not kill." So I
asked him whether, if I resolved to defend him, he
would defend me, and stand by me, and do just as I bade him. He said, "Me die when you bid die,
master." So I gave him a good dram of rum; and
when he had drank it, I made him take the two
fowling-pieces, and load them with swan-shot, as
big as small pistol-bullets: then I took four muskets,
and loaded them with two slugs and five small butlets each; and my two pistols I loaded with a brace
of bullets each. 'I hung my great sword, as usual,
naked by by my side, and gave Friday his hatchet.
When I had thus prepared myself, I took my per-
spective glass, 'and went up to the side of the hill to
see what I could discover, and I found quickly by
my glass that there were twenty-one savages, three
prisoners, and three canoes; and that their whole
business seemed to be the triumphant banquet upon
these three human bodies; but nothing more than as
I had observed as usual with them.
They were landed, not where they had done when
Friday made his escape, but nearer to my creek,
where the shore was low, and where a thick wood
came close almost down to the sea. This, with the
abhorrence of the inhuman errand these wretches
came about, so filled me with indignation, that I
came down to Friday, and told him I was resolved
to go down to them and kill them all, and asked him
if he would stand by me. He had now gotten over
his fright, and his spirits being a little raised with
the dram I had given him, he was very cheerful, and
told me as before, " he would die when I bid die."
In this fit of fury, I took first and divided the arms
which I had charged, as before, between us; I gave
Friday one pistol to stick in his girdle, and three guns
upon his shoulder; and I took one pistol and the
other three myself; and in this posture we marched
out. I took a small bottle of rum in my pocket, and
gave Friday a large bag with more powder and bul-
lets; and as to orders, I charged him to keep close
behind me, and not to stir, or shoot, or do any thing
till I bade him: and, in the mean time, not to speak
a word. In this posture I fetched a compass to my
right hand of near a mile, as well to get over the
creek as to get into the wood, so that I might come
within a shot of them before I should be discovered,
which I had seen by my glass it was easy to do.
I entered the wood with all possible wariness and
silence (Friday following close at my heels,) and
marched till I came to the skirt of the wood, on the
side which was next to them; only that one corner
of the wood lay between me and them. Here I called
softly to Friday, and showing him a great tree, which
was just at the corner of the wood, I bade him go to
the tree, and bring me word if he could ape there
plainly what they were doing. He did so, and came
immediately back to me, and told me they might be
plainly viewed there ; that they were all about the
fire, eating the flesh of one of their prisoners; and
that another lay bound. upon the sand, a little from
them, whom, he said, they would kill next, and ,which fired the very soul within me. He told me it was
not one of their nation, but one of the bearded men
whom he had told me of, that came to their country
in the boat. I was filled with horror at the very
naming the wThite, bearded man, and, going to the
tree, I saw plainly by my glass a white man, who
lay upon the beach of the sea, with his hands and
feet tied with flags, or things like rushes, and that
he was an European, and had clothes on.
There was another tree, and a little thicket beyond
it, about fifty yards nearer to them than the place
where I was, which, by going a little way about, I
saw I might come at undiscovered, and that then I
should be within half a shot of them. So I withheld
my passion, and, going back about twenty paces, I got behind some bushes, which held all the way till
I came to the other tree, and then I came to a little
rising ground, which gave me a full view of them, at
the distance of about eighty yards.
I had now not a moment to lose; for nineteen of
the dreadful wretches sat upon the ground, all close
huddled together, and had just sent the other two to
butcher the poor Christian, and bring him, perhaps,
limb by limb, to their fire; and they were stooped
down to untie the bands at his feet. I turned to
Friday: "Now, Friday," said 1, "do as I bid thee."
Friday said he would. "Then, Friday," said I , " do
exactly as you see me do; fail in nothing." So I set
down one of the muskets and the fowling-piece upon
the ground, and Friday did the like by his; and with
the other musket I took my aim at the savages, bid-
ding him do the like: then asking him if he was
ready, he said, " Yes."—" Then fire at them," said I ;
and the same moment I fired also.
Friday took his aim so much better than 1, that
on the side he shot he killed two of them, and
wounded three more; and, on my side, I killed one,
and wounded two. They were in a dreadful con-
sternation; and all of them who were not hurt jumped
up upon their feet immediately, but did not know
which way to run, or which way to look, for they
knewnotfromwhence their destruction came. Friday
kept his eyes close upon me, that, as I bid him, he
might observe what I did", so, as soon as the first
shot was made, I threw down the piece and took up
the fowling-piece, and Friday did the like: he sees
me cock and present; he did the same again. "Are
you ready, Friday?" said I. "Yes," said he. "Let
fly, then," said 1, "in the name of God;" and with
that I fired again among the amazed wretches, and so did Friday; and as our pieces were now loaded with what I call swan-shot, or small pistol bullets,
we found only two drop; but so many were wounded,
that they ran about yelling and screaming like mad
creatures, all bloody and wounded, most of them;
and three more fell quickly after, but not quite dead.
"Now, Friday," said I, laying down the discharged
pieces and taking up the musket, which was yet
loaden," follow me," which he did with a deal' of
courage; upon which I rushed out of the wood and
showed myself, and Friday close at my foot. As
soon as I perceived they saw me, I shouted as loud
as I could, and bade Friday do so too; and running
as fast as I could, which, by the way, was not very
fast, I made directly towards the poor victim, who
was, as I said, lying upon the beach or shore, between
the place where they sat and the sea. The two butchers, who were just going to work with him, had left him
at the surprise of our first fire, and fled, in a terrible
fright, to the sea-side, and had jumped into a canoe,
and three more of the rest made the same way. I turned to Friday, and bade him- step forwards and
fire at them; he understood me immediately, and,
running about forty yards to be nearer them, he shot
at them, and I thought he had killed them all, for I saw them all fall on a heap in the boat, though I saw
two of them up again quickly; however, he killed
two of them, and wounded the third, so that he lay
in the bottom of the boat as if he had been dead.
While Friday fired at them, I pulled out my knife
and cut the flags that bound the poor victim; and,
loosing his hands and feet, I lifted him up, and asked
him, in the Portuguese tongue, what he was. He
answered, in Latin, " Christianus;" but was so weak
and faint, that he could scarce stand or speak. I took my bottle out of my pocket and gave it him,
making signs that he should drink, which he did;
and I gave him a piece of bread, which he eat. Then
I asked him what countryman he was, and he said
"Espagnole:" and, being a little recovered, let me
know, by all the signs he could possibly make, how
much he was in my debt for his deliverance. I said,
in as good Spanish as I could, "we will talk after-
wards, but we must fight now: if you have any
strength left, take the pistol and sword and lay about
you." He took them very thankfully, and no sooner
had he the arms in his hands, but, as if they put new
-vigour into him, he flew upon his murderers like a
fury, and had cut two of them in pieces in an instant;
for they were so surprised and frightened, that they
could make no resistance, nor attempt to escape.'
I kept my piece in my hand still, without firing,
being willing to keep my charge ready, because I had given the Spaniard my pistol and sword; so I
called to Friday, and bade him run up to the tree
from whence we first fired, and fetch the arms which
lay there that had been discharged, which he quickly
did; and then giving him my musket, I sat down to
load all the rest again, and bade them come to me
when they wanted. While I was loading these
pieces, there happened a fierce engagement between
the Spaniard and one of the savages, who made at
him with one of their great wooden swords, the same
weapon that was to have killed him before, if I had
not prevented it. The 9paniard,'who was very bold,
though weak, had fought this Indian a good while,
and had cut him two great wounds on his head; but
the savage, being a stout, lusty fellow, closing in with
him, had thrown him down, and was wringing my
sword out of his hand, when the Spaniard, though
undermost, wisely quitted the sword, drew the pistol
from his girdle, and shot him dead on the spot.
Friday, being now left at his liberty, pursued the
flying wretches with no weapon in his hand but his
hatchet; and with that he dispatched those three
who were wounded at first and fallen, and all the
rest he could come up with; and the Spaniard coming
to me for a gun, I gave him one of the fowling-pieces,
with which he pursued two of the savages, and
wounded them both; but as he was not able to run,
they both got from him into the wood, where Friday
pursued them, and killed one of them; but the other
was too nimble for him; and though he was wounded,
yet had plunged into the sea, and swam with all his
might off to those who were left in the canoe, which
three in the canoe, with one wounded, we know not
whether he died or no, were all that escaped our
hands of one-and-twenty.
Those that were in the canoe worked hard to get
out of gun-shot; and though Friday made two or
three shots at them, I did not find that he hit any of
them. Friday would fain have had me take one of
their canoes and pursue them, and indeed I was very
anxious about their escape, lest, carrying the news
home to their people, they should come back, per-
haps, with two or three hundred of their canoes, and
devour us by mere multitude; so I consented to
pursue them by sea; and running to one of their
canoes, I jumped in, and bade Friday follow me; but
when I was in the canoe, I was surprised to find
another poor creature lie there alive, bound hand and
foot, as the Spaniard was, for the slaughter, and almost
dead with fear, not knowing what the matter was,
for he had not been able to look up over the side of
the boat; he was tied so hard, neck and heels, and
had been tied so long, that he had little life in him.
I immediately cut the twisted flags, or rushes, that
bound him, ana would have helped him up; but he1
could not stand or speak, but groaned mostpiteously.
believing, it seems, still, that he was only unbound
in order to be killed. When Friday came, I bade
him speak to him, and tell him of his deliverance;
end pulling out my bottle, made him give the poor
wretch a dram, which, with the news of his being
delivered, revived him, and he sat up in the boat;
bat when Friday came to hear him speak, and looked
in his face, it would have moved any one to tears to
have seen how Friday kissed him, embraced him,
hugged him, cried, laughed, hallooed, jumped about,
danced, sung, then cried again, wrung his hands,
beat his own face and head, and then sung and
jumped about again, like a distracted creature. It
was a good while before I could make him speak to
me, or tell me what was the matter; but when he
came a little to himself, he said that it was his father.
It is not easy for me to express how it moved me.
to see what ecstasy and filial affection had worked
in this poor savage, at the sight of his father, and of
his being delivered from death: nor indeed can I
describe half the extravagance of his affection after
this, for he went into the boat and out of the boat, *
p 2
great many times. When he went in to him, he
would sit down by him, open his breast, and hold his
father's head close to his bosom half an hour toge-
ther, to nourish it; then he took his arms and ankles, which were numbed and stiff with the binding, and
chafed and rubbed them with his hands; and I per-
ceiving what the case was, gave him some rum out
of my bottle to rub them with, which did them a
great deal of good.
This action put an end to our pursuit of the canoe
with the other savages, who were now gotten almost
out of sight; and it was happy for us that we did not,
for it blew so hard within two hours after, and be-
fore they could be gotten a quarter of their way, and
continued blowing so hard all night, and that from
the north-west, which was against them, that I could
not suppose their boat could live, or that they ever
reached to their own coast-
But to return to Friday, he was so busy about his
father, that I could not find in my heart to take him
off for some time: but after I thought he could leave
him a little, I called him to me, and he camejumping
and laughing, and pleased to the highest extreme.
Then I asked him if he had given his father any
bread. He shook his head, and said, "None: ugly
dog eat all up self." So I gave him a cake of bread
out of a little pouch I carried on purpose: I also
gave him a dram for himself, but he would not taste
it, but carried it to his father. I had in my pocket
also two or three bunches of my raisins, so I gave
him a handful of them for his father. He had no
sooner given his father these raisins, but I saw him
come out of the boat, and run away, as if he had
been bewitched. He ran at such a rate (for he was
the swiftest fellow of his foot that ever I saw), I say,
he ran at such a rate, that he was out of sight, as it
were in an instant; and though I called and hallooed
too after him, it was all one: away he went, aud in
a quarter of an hour I saw him come back again,
though not so fast as he went; and as he came nearer
I found his pace was slacker, because he had some-
thin? in his hand.
When he came to me, I found he had been quite
home for an earthen jug, or pot, to bring his father
some fresh water, and that he had got two more
cakes or loaves of bread. The bread he gave me, but
the water he carried to his father; however, as I was
very thirsty too, I took a little sup of it. The water
revived his father more than all the rum or spirits I
had given him, for he was just fainting with thirst.
When his father had drunk, I called to him to
know if there was any water left; he said, "Yes,"
and I bade him give it to the poor Spaniard, who
was as much in want of it as his father, and I sent
one of the cakes that Friday brought to the Spaniard
too, who was indeed very weak, and was reposing
himself upon a green place, under the shade of a tree,
and whose limbs were also very stiff, and very much
swelled with the rude bandage he had been tied
with. When I saw that upon Friday's coming up
to him with the water, he sat up and drank, and
took the bread and began to eat, I went up to him
and gave him a handful of raisins. He looked up in
my face with all the tokens of gratitude and thank-
fulness that could appear in any countenance; but was so weak, notwithstanding he had so exerted
himself in the fight, that he could not stand upon his
feet: he tried to do it two or three times, but was
really not able, his ankles were so swelled, and so
painful to him; so I bade him sit still, and caused
Friday to rub his ankles, and bathe them with rum,
as he had done his father's.
I observed the poor affectionate creature, every
two minutes, or perhaps less, all the while he was
here, turned his head about to see for his father; and
at last he missed him, at which he started up, and,
without speaking a word, flew with that swiftness
to him, that one could scarce perceive his feet to
touch the ground as he Went; but when he came, he
found he had only laid himself down to ease his limbs.
So Friday came back to me presently, and I then
told him to help the Spaniard to the boat; so he took
him upon his back, and carried him beside his father
in the boat, and stepping out again, launched the
boat off, and paddled it along the shore faster than I could walk, though the wind blew pretty hard too; so
he brought them both safe into our creek, and leaving
them in the boat, runs away to fetch the other canoe.
As he passed me, I spoke to him, and asked him.
whither he went. He told me, "Go fetch more
boat." So away he went, like the wind; for sure
never man or horse ran like him; and he had the
other canoe in the creek almost as soon as I got to
it by land: so he wafted me over, and then went to
help our new guests out of the boat, which he did;
but they were neither of them able to walk, so that
poor Friday knew not what to do.
At last, we made a kind of hand-barrow to lay
them on, and Friday and I carried them up both
together upon it between us. But when we got them
to the outside of our wall, or fortification, we were
at a worse loss than before, for it was impossible to
get them over; and I was resolved not to break it
down. So I set to work again; and Friday and I,
in about two hours' time, made a very handsome tent,
covered with old sails, and above that with boughs
of trees, being in the space without our outward
fence, and between that and the grove of young wood
which I had planted: and here we made them two
beds of such things as I had, viz. of good rice straw,
with blankets laid upon it to lie on, and another to
cover them on each bed.
My island was now peopled, and I thought myself
very rich in subjects; and it was a merry reflection
which I frequently made, how like a king I looked.
First of all, the whole country was my own mere pro-
perty, so that I had an undoubted right of dominion.
Secondly, my people were perfectly subjected; I
was the absolute lord and lawgiver: they all owed
their lives to me, and were ready to lay down their
lives, if there had been occasion of it, for me. It was
remarkable, too, I had but three subjects, and they
were of three different religions: my man Friday
was a protestant; his father was a pagan and a can-
nibal; and the Spaniard was a papist. However, I
allowed liberty of conscience to all my subjects.
As soon as I had secured my two weak, rescued
prisoners, and given them shelter, and a place to
rest them upon, I began to think of making some
provision for them; and the first thing I did, I or-
dered Friday to take a yearling goat, betwixt a kid
and a goat, out of my particular flock, *a be killed.
Then I cut off the hinder quarter, and chopping it
into small pieces, I set Friday to work to boiling and
stewing, and made them a very good dish of flesh
and broth, and we all enjoyed it, and eat heartily.
After we had dined, or rather supped, I ordered
Friday to take one of the canoes, and go and fetch
our muskets and other fire-arms from the place of
battle; and the next day I ordered him to go and
bury the dead bodies of the savages, which lay open
to the sun, and would presently be offensive; and I
also ordered him to bury the horrid remains of their
barbarous feast; all of which he punctually performed.
I then began to enter into a little conversation
with my two new subjects; and first I set Friday to
enquire of his father what he thought of the escape
of the savages in that canoe, and whether we might expect a return of them with a power too great for
us to resist. His first opinion was, that the savages
in the boat never could live out the storm which blew
that night they went off, but must be drowned or
driven south to those other shores, where they were
as sure to be devoured as they were to be drowned,
if they were cast away; but as to what they would
do, if they came on shore, he said, he knew not but
232 ROBINSON CRUSOE. it was his opinion that they were so dreadfully
frightened with the manner of their being attacked,
the noise and the fire, that he believed they would
tell their people they were all killed by thunder and
lightning, and not by the hand of man: and that the
two which appeared (viz. Friday and I) were two
heavenly spirits and furies come down to destroy
them, and not with weapons. And this old savage
was right; for though they escaped the sea, they
gave such dreadful accounts in their own country
(as I heard afterwards,) that they never ventured
from that part to my island again.
But I was under continual apprehensions for some
time, and kept upon my guard, I and all my army,
for as we were now four of us, I would have ventured
upon a hundred of them, in the open field.
In a little time, however, no more canoes appear-
ing, the fear of their coming wore off, and I began
to take my former thoughts of a voyage to the main
into consideration, being likewise assured by Friday's
father, that I might depend upon good usage from
their nation, on his account, if I would go.
But my thoughts were a little suspended, when I
had a serious discourse with the Spaniard, and when
I understood that there were sixteen more of his
countrymen and Portuguese, who having been cast
away, and made their escape to that side, lived there
at peace indeed with the savages, but were very sore
put to it for necessaries, and indeed for life. I asked
him all the particulars of their voyage, and found
they were a Spanish ship, bound from the Rio de la
Plata to the Havannah, being directed to leave their
loading there, which was chiefly hides and silver,
and to bring back what European goods they could
meet with there; that they had five Portuguese
seamen on hoard, whom they took out of another
wreck; that five of their own men were drowned
when first their ship was lost; and that these escaped
through infinite dangers and hazards, and arrived,
almost starved, on the cannibal coast, where they
expected to be devoured every moment.
He told me, they had some arms with them, but
they were perfectly useless, for that they had neither
powder nor ball, the washing of the sea having spoiled
all their powder, but a little which they used at their
first landing, to provide themselves some food.
I asked him what he thought would become of
them there; and if they had formed no design of
making an escape. He said they had many consulta-
tions about it, but having neither vessel, nor tools to
build one, nor provisions of any kind, their counsels
always ended in tears and despair. I asked him how
he thought they would receive a proposal from me,
which might tend towards an escape; and whether,
if they were all here, it might not be done.
He told me they were all under the greatest dis-
tress imaginable, and if I would undertake their
relief, they would live and die by me.
Upon these assurances, I resolved to venture to
relieve them, if possible, and to send the old savage
and the Spaniard over to them to treat. But when
he had gotten all things in readiness to go, the Spa-
niard himself started an objection, which had so
much prudence in it on the one hand, and so much
sincerity on the other hand, that I could not but be
well satisfied in it; and, by his advice, put off the
deliverance of his comrades for at least half a year.
The case was thus:—He had been with us now
about a month, during which time I had let him see
in what manner I had provided, with the assistance
of Providence, for my support; and he saw evidently
what stock of corn and rice I had laid up, which, as
it was more than sufficient for myself, so it was not
sufficient, at least without good husbandry, for my
family, now it was increased to the number of four,
but much less would it be sufficient if his country-
men, who were, as he said, fourteen, still alive, should
come over: and, least of all, would it be sufficient to
victual our vessel, if we should build one, for a voyage to any of the Christian colonies of America. So he
told me, he thought it would be more advisable to let
him, and the two others, dig and cultivate more land,
as much as I could spare seed to sow; and that we
should wait another harvest, then we might have a
supply of corn for his countrymen, when they should
come; for want might be a temptation to them to
disagree, or not think themselves delivered, other-
wise than out of one difficulty into another.
His caution was so reasonable, and his advice so
good, that I could not but be very well pleased with
his proposal, as well as I was satisfied with his fide-
lity. So we fell to digging, all four of us, as well as
the wooden tools we were furnished with permitted:
and in about a month's time, by the end of which it
was seed time, we had gotten as much land cured
and trimmed up as we sowed twenty-two bushels of
barley on, and sixteen jars of rice, which was, in
short, all the seed we had to spare.
Having now society enough, and our number being
sufficient to put us out of fear of savages, if they had
come, unless their number had been very great, we
went freely all over the island, wherever we found
occasion ; and as we had our escape or deliverance upon
our thoughts, it was impossible, at least for me, to
have the means of it out of mine. To this purpose,
I marked out several trees, which I thought fit for
our work, and I set Friday and his father to cutting
them down; and then I caused the Spaniard to over-
see and direct their work. I showed them with what
indefatigable pains I had hewed a large tree into
single planks, and I caused them to do the like, till
they had made about a dozen large planks of good
oak', near two feet broad, thirty-five feet long, and
from two inches to four inches thick. What prodi-
gious labour it took up, any one may imagine.
At the same time, I contrived to increase my little
flock of tame goats as much as I could; and to this
purpose I made Friday and the Spaniard go out one
day, and myself with Friday the next day, for we
took our turns; and, by this means, we got about
twenty young kids to breed up with the rest, for
whenever we shot the dam, we saved the kids, and
added them to our flock. But, above all, the season
for curing the grapes coming on, I caused such a
prodigious quantity to be hung up in the sun, that I believe, had we been at Alicant, where raisins are
cured, we should have filled sixty or eighty barrels;
and these, with our bread, was a great part of our food.
It was now harvest, and our crop in good order.
It was not the most plentiful increase I had seen in
the island, but, however, it was enough to answer
our end, for, from our twenty-two bushels of barley,
we brought in and threshed out above two hundred
and twenty bushels, and the like in proportion of the
rice, which was store enough for our food to the next
harvest, though all the fourteen Spaniards had been
on shore with me; or, if we had been ready for a
voyage, it would very plentifully have victualled our
ship to have carried us to any part of the world, that
is to say of America. When we had thus housed and
secured our magazine of corn, we fell to work to
make more wicker-work, viz. great baskets in which
we kept it; and the Spaniard was very handy and
dextrous at this part.
And now having a full supply of food for all the
guests I expected, I gave the Spaniard leave to go
over to the main, to see what he could do with those
he had left behind him there. I gave him strict
charge not to bring any man with him, who would
not first swear, in the presence of himself and the old
savage, that he would in no way injure, fight with,
or attack the person he should find in the island,
who was so kind as to send for them, in order to
their deliverance; but that they would stand by
and defend him against all such attempts, and
wherever they went, would be entirely under, and
subjected to his command; and that this should be
put in writing, and signed with their hands.
Under these instructions, the Spaniard, and the
old savage went away in one of the canoes which they
came in, when they were brought as prisoners to be
devoured by the savages. I gave each of them a
musket, and about eight charges of powder and ball,
charging them to be very careful of both, and not to
use either of them but upon very urgent occasions.
This was a cheerful work, being the first measures
used by me, in view of my deliverance, for now
twenty-seven years and some days. I gave them
provisions of bread, and of dried grapes sufficient for
themselves for many days, and sufficient for all their
countrymen for about eight days; and wishing them
a good voyage, I let them go, agreeing with them
about a signal they should hang out at their return,
by which I should know them again, when they came
back, at a distance, before they came on shore.
They went away, with a fair gale, on the day that
the moon was at the full, by my account, in the
month of October, as near as I could tell.
It was no less than eight days I waited for them,
when a strange and unforeseen occurrence intervened,
of which the like has not, perhaps, been heard of in
history. I was fast asleep in my hut one morning,
when my man Friday came running in to me, and
called aloud, "Master, master, they are come, they
are come!" I jumped up, and, regardless of danger,
went out, as soon as I could get my clothes on,
through my little grove; I went without my arms,
which it was not my custom to do; but I was sur-
prised, when, turning my eyes to the sea, I presently
saw a boat, at about a league and a half's distance,
standing in for the shore, with a shoulder-of-mutton
sail, as they call it, and the wind blowing pretty fair
to bring them in. Also I observed, that they did
not come from that side which the shore lay on, but
from the southernmost end of the island, upon this
I called Friday in, and bade him lie close, for these
were not the people we looked for, and that we did
not know yet whether they were friends or enemies.
In the next place, I went in to fetch my perspective
glass, to see what I could make of them; and having
taken the ladder out, I climbed up to the top of the
hill, as I used to do, when I was apprehensive of any
thing, and to take my view plainer, without being
discovered. I had scarce set my foot on the hill,
when my eye plainly discovered a ship lying at
anchor, at about two leagues and a half's distance
from me, S.S.E. but not above a league and a half
from the shore. It appeared plainly to be an English
ship, and the boat an English long boat.
I cannot express the confusion I was in, though
the joy of seeing a ship, and one which, I had reason
to believe was manned by my own countrymen, and
consequently friends, was such as I cannot describe;
but yet I had some secret doubts hung about me, I cannot tell from whence they came, bidding me to
be on my guard. I began to consider what business
an English ship could have here; since it was not
the way to or from any part of the world where the
English had any traffic; and I knew there had been
no storms to drive them in there, as in distress; and
that if they were English really, it was probable they
were here upon no good design, and that I had better
continue as I was, than fall into the hands of thieves
and murderers.
Let no man despise the secret hints and notices of
danger, which sometimes are given him, when he
may possibly think there is no danger of its being
real. That such hints and notices are given us, I believe few, that have made any observations of
things, can deny; that they are certain discoveries
of an invisible world, and a converse of spirits, we
cannot doubt; and if the tendency of them seems to
be to warn us of danger, why should we not suppose
they are from some friendly agent (whether supreme,
or inferior and subordinate, is not the question,) and
that they are given for our good?
The present question abundantly confirms me in
the justice of this reasoning; for had I not been made
cautious by this secret admonition, I had been undone
inevitably, and in a far worse condition than before.
I had not kept myself long in this posture, when I saw the boat draw near the shore, as if they looked
for a creek to thrust in at, for the convenience of
landing: however, as they did not come quite far
enough, they did not see the little inlet where I for-
merly landed my rafts, but ran their boat on shore
upon the beach, at about half a mile from me, which
was very happy for me; for otherwise they would
have landed just, as I may say, at my door, and
would soon have beaten me out of my castle, and,
perhaps, have plundered me of all I had.
When they were on shore, I was fully satisfied
they were Englishmen, at least, most of them, one or
two I thought were Dutch, but it did not prove so.
There were in all eleven men, whereof three I found
were unarmed, and, (as I thought) bound; and when
the first four or five of them were jumped on shore,
they took those three out of the boat as prisoners.
One of the three I could perceive using the most
passionate gestures of entreaty, affliction, and des-
pair; the other two lifted up their hands sometimes,
and appeared concerned indeed, but not so much as
the first.
I was perfectly confounded at the sight, and knew
not what the meaning of it should be. Friday called
out to me, in English, as well as he could, " O master,
you see English mans eat prisoners as well as savage
mans."—"Why," said 1, "do you think they are
going to eat them then F--- " Yes," says Friday, " they
will eat them."—" No, no," said I, "Friday, I am
afraid they will murder them indeed, but you may
be sure they will not eat them."
All this while I had no thought of what the matter
really was, but expected every moment the three
prisoners would be killed; and once I saw one of the
villains lift up his arm, with a great cutlass, or sword,
to strike one of the poor men, and I expected to see
him fall every moment. I wished heartily now for
my Spaniard, and the savage that was gone with
him; or that I had any way to have come undisco-
vered within shot of them, that I might have rescued
the three men, for they had no fire-arms that I saw.
After I had observed the outrageous usage of the
three men, by the insolent seamen, I saw that the
fellows ran scattering about the land, as if they
wanted to see the country. I observed also, that the
three other men had liberty to go where they pleased,
but that they sat down all three upon the ground very
pensive, and looked like men in despair.
It was just at the top of high-water when these
people came on shore, and while partly they stood
parleying with the prisoners they brought, and partly
while they rambled about to see what kind of place
they were in, they had carelessly stayed till the tide
was spent, and the water was ebbed considerably
away, leaving the boat aground. They had left two
men in the boat, who, as I found afterwards, having
drank a little too much brandy, fell asleep. However,
one of them waking sooner than the other, and find-
ing the boat too fast aground for him to stir it, hal-
looed for the rest, who were straggling about, upon
which they all soon came to the boat, but it was past
all their strength to launch her, the boat being very
heavy, and the shore on that side being a soft. oozy
sand, almost like a quicksand. In this condition,
like true seamen, who are perhaps, the least of all
mankind given to forethought, they gave it over, and
away they strolled about the country again; and I
heard one of them say aloud to another (calling them
off from the boat), "Why, let her alone, Jack, can't
ye I Shell float next tide." By which I was fully
confirmed what countrymen they were.
All this while I kept myself close, not once daring
to stir out of my castle, any farther than to my place
of observation, near the top of the hill. I knew it
would be no less than ten hours before the boat could
be afloat again, and by that time it would be dark,
and I might be more at liberty to see their motions,
and to hear their discourse, if they had any.
In the mean time, I fitted myself up for a battle,
as before, though with more caution, knowing I had
to do with another kind of enemy than I had at first.
I ordered Friday also to load himself with arms. I
took myself two fowling-piecs, and I gave him three
muskets. My figure indeed was very fierce; I had
my formidable goat-skin coat on, with the great cap
I have mentioned, a naked sword by my side, two
pistols in my belt, and a gun upon each shoulder.
It was my design, as I said above, not to have made
any attempt until it was dark, but about two o'clock,
being the heat of the day, I found that they were all
gone straggling into the woods, and, as I thought,
were all laid down to sleep. The three poor dis-
tressed men, too anxious for their condition to get
any sleep, were, however, sat down under the shelter
of a great tree, at about a quarter of a mile from me,
and, as I thought, out of sight of any of the rest.
Upon this I resolved to discover myself to them,
and learn something of their condition. Immediately
I marched with my man Friday at a good distance
behind me, as formidable for his arms as I, but not
making quite so staring a spectre-like figure as I did.
I came as near them undiscovered as I could, and
then, before any of them saw me, I called aloud to
them, in Spanish, " what are ye, gentlemen?"
They started up at the noise, but were ten times
more confounded when they saw me, and the uncouth
figure I made. They made no answer at all, but I
thought I perceived them just going to fly from me,
when I spoke to them in English :—" Gentlemen,"
said I. "do.not be surprised at me; perhaps you
may have a friend near you, when you did not expect
it."—" He must be sent directly from heaven then,"
Said one of them very gravely to me, and pulling off
his hat at the same time, "for pur condition is past
the help of man."—" All help is from heaven, sir,"
said 1, "but can you put a stranger in the way how
to help you, for you seem to be in some great dis-
tress 1 I saw you when you landed; and when you seemed to make application to the brutes that came
with you, I saw one lift up his sword to kill you.".
The poor man, with tears running down his face,
and trembling, looking like one astonished, returned,
"Am I talking to God or man? Is it a real man, or
an angel?"—" Be in no fear about that, sir," said 1,
"if God had sent an angel to relieve you, he would
have come better clothed, and armed after another
manner, than you see me. Pray lay aside your
fears, I am a man, an Englishman, and disposed to
assist you, you see. I have one servant only: we
have arms and ammunition. Tell us freely, can we
serve you? What is your case?"
"Our case, sir," said he, "is too long to tell you, while our murderers are so near; but, in short, sir, I
was commander of that ship, my men have mutinied
against me, they have been hardly prevailed upon not to murder me, and, at last, "have set me on
shore in this desolate place, with these two men
with me, one my mate, the other a passenger, where
we expected to perish, believing the place to be un-
inhabited, and know not yet what to think of it."
"Where are those brutes, your enemies?" said 1,
"do you know where they are gone 2"—" There they
are, sir," said he, pointing to a thicket of trees, " my heart trembles for fear they have seen us, and heard
you speak; if they have, they will murder us all."
"Have they any fire-arms f" said I. He answered,
"They had only two pieces, and one which they left
in the boat."—" Well then," said 1, "leave the rest
tome. I see they are asleep. It is 8n easy thing to
Q
kill them all; but shall we rather take them prison-
ers?" He told me there were two desperate villains
among them, that it was scarce safe to show any
mercy to, but if they were secured, he believed all
the rest would return to their duty. I asked him
which they were. He told me he could not, at that
distance, describe them: but he would obey my
orders in any thing I would direct. "Well," said 1,
"let us retreat out of their view or hearing, lest they
awake, and we will resolve farther." So they wil-
lingly went back with me, till the woods covered us
from them. "Look you, sir," said I , "if I venture
upon your deliverance, are you willing to make two
conditions with me?" He anticipated my proposals,
by telling me, that both he and the ship, if recovered,
should be wholly directed and commanded by me in
every thing; and if the ship was not recovered, he
would live and die with me, in what part of the world
soever I would send him; and the two others said
the same.
"Well," said I, "my conditions are but two :—
first, that while you stay on this island with me.
you will not pretend to any authority here; and if I put arms in your hands, you will, upon all occasions,
give them up to me, and do no prejudice to me or
mine, upon this island; and, in the mean time, be
governed by my orders. Secondly, that if the ship
is or may be recovered, you will carry me and my
man to England passage free." He gave me all the
assurances that the invention and faith of man could
devise, that he would comply with these most rea-
sonable demands, and, besides, would owe his life to
me, and acknowledge it, upon all occasions, as long
as he lived.
"Well then," said I, "here are three muskets for
you, with powder and ball. Tell me next what you
think is proper to be done." He showed all the
testimony of his gratitude that he was able; but
offered to be wholly guided by me, I told him I
thought it was hard venturing any thing, but the best
method I could think of, was to fire upon them at
once, as they lay; and if any were not killed at the
first volley, and offered to submit, we might save
them, and so put it wholly upon God's providence to
direct the shot.
He said very modestly that he was loath to kill
them, if he could help it, but that those two were
incorrigible villains, and had been the authors of all
the mutiny in the ship, and if they escaped we should
be undone still, for they would go on board and bring
the whole ship's company, and destroy us all. "Well then," said 1, " necessity legitimates my advice; for
it is the only way to save our lives." However, see-
ing him still cautious of shedding blood, I told him
they should go themselves, and manage as they
found convenient.
In the middle of this discourse, we heard some of
them awake, and soon after we saw two of them on
their feet. I asked him if either of them were the
men who, he had said, were the heads of the mutiny.
He said; "No."—"Well, then," said I, "you may
let them escape; and Providence seems to have
awakened them on purpose to save themselves.
Now," said I," if the rest escape you, it is your fault."
Animated with this, he took the musket I had
given him in his hand, and a pistol in his belt, and
his two comrades with him, each man a piece in his
hand. The two men who were with him, going first,
made some noise, at which one of the seamen who
was awake, turned about, and, seeing them coming,
cried out to the rest; but it was too late then, for
the moment he cried out, the two men fired, the cap-
tain wisely reserving his own piece. They had so
well aimed their shot at the men they knew, that one
of them was killed on the spot, and the other very
much wounded; but, not being dead, he started up
upon his feet, and called eagerly for help to the other) but the captain, stepping to him, told him it was too
late to cry for help: he should call upon God to for-
give his villany, and, with that word, knocked him
down with the stock of his musket, so that he never
spoke more. There were three more in the company,
and one of them was also slightly wounded. By this time I was come; and when they saw their danger,
and that it was in vain to resist, they begged for
mercy. The captain told them he would spare their
lives if they would give him any assurance of their
abhorrence of the treachery they had been guilty of,
and would swear to be faithful to him in recovering
the ship, and afterwards in carrying her back to
Jamaica, from whence they came. They gave him
all the protestations of their sincerity that could be
desired, and he was willing to believe them, and spare
their lives, which I was not against; only I obliged
him to keep them bound, hand and foot, while they
were upon the island.
While this was doing, I sent Friday, with the cap-
tain's mate, ;to the boat, with orders to secure her,
and bring away the oars and sail, which they did;
and, by "the bye, three straggling men, that were
parted from the rest, came back again upon hearing
the guns fired; and seeing their captain, who was
before their prisoner, now their conqueror, they sub-
mitted to be bound also.
It now remained that the captain and I should
inquire into one another's circumstances. I began
first, and told him my whole history, which he heard
with an attention even to amazement, and particu-
larly at the wonderful manner of my being furnished
with provisions and ammunition; and indeed, as my
story is a whole collection of wonders, it affected him
deeply; but when he reflected from thence upon himself, and how I seemed to have been preserved
there on purpose to save his life, the tears ran down
his face, and he could not speak a word more.
After this communication was at an end, I carried
him and his two men into my apartment, leading
them in just where I came out, viz. at the top of the
house, where I refreshed them with such provisions as
I had, and showed them all the contrivances I had
made during my long inhabiting this place.
All I showed them, all I said to them, was perfectly
amazing; but, above all, the captain admired my
fortification, and how perfectly I had concealed my
retreat with a grove of trees, which having been now
planted near twenty years, and the trees growing
much faster than in England, was become a little
wood, and so thick that it was impassable in any
part of it but at that one side where I had reserved
my little winding passage into it. This I told him
was my castle, and my residence, but that I had a
seat in the country, as most princes have. whither I could retreat upon occasion, and I would show him
that too another time; but at present our business
was to consider how to recover the ship. He agreed
with me as to that; but told me he was perfectly at
a loss what measures to take, for that there were
still six-and-twenty hands on board, who, having
entered into a cursed conspiracy, by which they
had all forfeited their lives to the law, would be
hardened in it now by desperation, and would
carry it on, knowing that if they were reduced they
should be brought to the gallows as soon as they
came to England, or to any of the English colonies,
and that therefore there would be no attacking them
with so small a number as we were.
I mused for some time upon what he had said, and
found it was a very rational conclusion; and it
occurred to me, that, in a little while, the ship's
crew, wondering what was become of their comrades,
and of the boat, would certainly come on shore in
their other boat, to see for them, and that then, per-
haps, thev might come armed, and be too strong for
us: this,he allowed, was rational.
Upon this, I told him the first thing we had to do
was to stave the boat, which lay upon the beach, so
that they might not carry her off; and taking every
thing out of her, leave her so far useless as not to be
fit to swim. Accordingly we went on board, took
the arms which were left on board out of her, and
whatever else we found there, which was a bottle of
brandy^ and another of rum, a few biscuit cakes, a
horn ot powder, and a great lump of sugar, in a piece
of canvas; the sugar was five or six pounds: all
which was very welcome to me, especially the brandy
and sugar, of which I had been without many years.
When we had carried all these things on shore, we
knocked a great hole in her bottom, that if they had
come strong enough to master us, yet they could not
carry off the boat.
Indeed, it was not much in my thoughts that we
could be capable to recover the ship; but my view
was, that if they went away without the boat, I did
not much question to make her fit again to carry us
away to the Leeward Islands, and call upon our
. friends the Spaniards in my way.
While we were thus preparing our designs, and
had first, by main strength, heaved the boat up upon
the beach, so high that the tide would not float her
off at high-water mark; and, besides, had broken a
hole in her bottom too big to be quickly stopped, and
were sat down musing what we should do, we
heard the ship fire a gun, and saw her make a waft
with her ancient as a signal for the boat to come on
board; but no boat stirred, and they fired several
times, making other signals for the boat.
At last, when all their signals and firings proved
fruitless, and they found the boat did not stir, we
saw them (by the help of my glasses) hoist another
boat off, and row towards the shore; and we found,
as they approached, that there were no less than ten
men in her, and that they had fire-arms with them.
As the ship lay almost two leagues from the shore,
we had a full view of them as they came. The cap-
tain knew the persons and characters of all the men.
in the boat, of whom he said that there were three
very honest fellows, who, he was sure, were led into
this conspiracy by the rest, being overpowered and
frightened; but that as for the boatswain, who, it
seems, was the chief officer among them, and all the
rest, they were as outrageous as any of the ship's
crew, and were, no doubt, made desperate in their
new enterprise.
We had, upon the first appearance of the boat's
coming from the ship, considered of separating out
prisoners, and had indeed secured them effectually.
Two of them, of whom the captain was less assured
than ordinary, I sent with Friday, and one of the
three delivered men, to my cave, where they were remote enough, and out of danger of being heard or
discovered, or of finding their way out of the woods.
They left them bound, but gave them provisions,
and promised them, if they continued there quietly,
to give them their liberty m a day or two; but that
if they attempted their escape, they should be put to
death without mercy. They promised faithfully to
bear their confinement with patience.
The other prisoners had better usage; two of them
were kept pinioned indeed, because the captain did
not like to trust them, but the other two were taken
into my service, upon their captain's recommenda-
tion, and upon their solemnly engaging to live and
die with us.
As soon as they got to the place where their other
boat lay, they ran their boat into the beach, and
came all on shore, hauling the boat up after them,
which I was glad to see; for I was afraid they would
rather have left the boat at anchor, some distance
from the shore, with some hands in her to guard her,
and so we should not be able to seize the boat.
Being on shore, they ran all to the other boat;
and it was easy to see they were under a great sur-
prise to find her stripped, and a great hole in the
bottom. After this, they set up a great shout; but
it was all to no purpose: then they came all close in
a ring, and fired a volley of their small arms, which
indeed we heard, and the echoes made the woods
ring, but it was all one; those in the cave we were
sure could not hear, and those in our keeping, though
they heard it well enough, yet durst give no answer
to them.
They were so surprised at this, as they told us
afterwards, that they resolved to go all on board again
to their ship, and let them know there that the men
were all murdered, and the longboat staved: accord-
ingly, they immediately launched their boat again,
and got all of them on board.
The captain was terribly amazed, and even con-
founded at this, believing they would go on board
the ship again, and set sail, giving their comrades
up for lost, and so he should still lose the ship, which
he was in hopes we should have recovered, but he was quickly as much frightened the other way.
They had not been long put off with the boat, but
we perceived them all coming on shore again; and
they left three men in the boat, and the rest went up
into the country to look for their fellows. This was
a great disappointment to us, for now we were at a
loss what to do; for our seizing those seven men on
shore would be no advantage to us if we let the boat
escape, because they would then row away to the
ship, and then the rest of them would be sure to
weigh, and set sail, and so our hope of recovering the
ship would be lost. However, we had no remedy but
to wait and see what the issue of things might pre-
sent. The seven men came on shore, and the three
who remained in the boat put her off to a good dis-
tance from the shore, and came to an anchor to wait
for them, so that it was impossible for us to come at
them in the boat.
Those that came on shore kept close together,
marching towards the top of the little hill, under
which my habitation lay, and we could see them
plainly, though they could not perceive us. And
when they were come to the brow of the hill, where
they could see a great way into the valleys and
woods which lay towards the north-east part, and
where the island lay lowest, they shouted till they
were weary, and then they sat down to consider of
it. Had they gone to sleep there, as the other party
did, they had done for us; but they were too
full of apprehensions of danger to venture to go to
sleep, though they could not tell what the danger was.
The captain made a very just proposal to me upon
this consultation of theirs, viz. that perhaps they
would all fire a volley again, to endeavour to make
their fellows hear, and that we should all sally upon
them just at the juncture when their pieces were all
discharged, and they would certainly yield, and we
should nave them without bloodshed. I liked the
proposal, provided it was done while we were near
enough to come up to them before they could load
their pieces again.
But this event did not happen, and we lay still
a long time, very irresolute what course to take: at
length I told them there would be nothing to be done
in my opinion, till night: and then, if they did not
return to the boat, perhaps we might use some stra»
tagem with them in the boat to get them on shore.
We waited a great while, and were very uneasy;
when, we saw them all start up, and march towards
the sea. It seems they had such dreadful apprehen-
sions upon them of the danger of the place, that they
resolved to go on board the ship again, give their
companions over for lost, and so go on their intended
voyage with the ship.
As soon as I perceived them go towards the shore,
I imagined that they had given over their search,
and were for going back again; and the captain was
ready to sink when I told him my thoughts, but I
presently thought of a stratagem to fetch them back
again, and which answered my end to a tittle.
I ordered Friday and the captain's mate, to go over
the little creek westward, towards the place where
Friday was rescued, and at about half a mile distance,
I bade them halloo as loud as they could, and as
soon as they heard the seamen answer them, they
should return it again, and then keeping out of sight,
take a round, and then wheel about again to me by
such ways as I directed.
They were just going into the boat, when Friday
and the mate hallooed, and they presently heard
them, and answering, run along the shore westward,
towards the voice they heard, when they were stop-
ped by the creek, the water being up, they could not
get over, and called for the boat to come and set
them over, as indeed I expected.
When they had set themselves over, I observed
that they took one of the three men out of her, and
left only two in the boat, having fastened her to a
stump of a little tree on the shore.
This was what I wished for; and immediately leav-
ing Friday and the captain's mate to their business,
I took the rest with me, and crossing the creek out
of their sight, we surprised the two men before they
were aware, one of them lying on the shore between
sleeping and waking, and going to start up, the cap-
tain who was foremost, ran in upon him and knocked
him down, and then called to him in the boat to
yield or he was a dead man.
There needed very few arguments to persuade a
single man to yield, when he saw five men upon him,
and his comrade knocked down: besides, this was, it
seems one of the three men who were not so hearty
in the mutiny as the rest of the crew, and therefore
was easily persuaded not only to yield, but after-
wards to join very sincerely with us.
In the mean time, Friday and the captain's mate
so well managed their business with the rest, that
they drew them, by hallooing and answering, from
one wood to another, till they not only heartily tired
them, but left them where they were very sure they
could not reach back before it was dark: and in-
deed they were heartily tired themselves also by
the time they came back to us.
It was several hours after Friday came back to me
before they came back to their boat; and we could
hear the foremost of them, long before they came
quite up, calling to those behind to come along, and
could hear them answer, and complain how lame and
tired they were, and not able to;come any faster,
which was very welcome news to us.
At length they came up to the boat; but it is im-
possible to express their confusion when they found
the boat fast aground in the creek, and their two
men gone; we could hear them telling one another
they were gotten into an enchanted island; that
either there were inhabitants in it, and they should
all be murdered, or else there were devils or spirits
in it, and they should be carried away and devoured.
They hallooed again, and called their two comrades
by their names but got no answer. After some time,
we could see them by the little light there was, run
about like men in despair; and that sometimes
they would go and sit down in the boat to rest them-
selves, then come on shore again, and walk about,
and so the same thing over again.
My men would have fallen upon them in the dark,
but I was willing to spare them, and kill as few of
them as I could; being unwilling to hazard the kill-
ing any of our men, knowing the others were well
armed. I resolved to wait and make sure of them, and
drew my ambuscade nearer, and ordered Friday and
the captain to creep upon their hands and knees, and
get as near them as they possibly could, before they
offered to fire.
They had not been long in that posture, when the
boatswain, who was the principal ringleader,and had
now shown himself the most dispirited of all the rest,
walked towards them with two more of their crew.
The captain was so eager, at having the principal
rogue so much in his power, that he could hardly
have patience to let him come so near as to be sure
of him, for he only heard his tongue before; but
when they came nearer, the captain and Friday,
starting up on their feet let fly at them.
The boatswain was killed on the spot, the next
man was shot through the body, and fell just by him,
though he did not die till an hour or two after, and
the third ran for it.
At the noise of the fire, I immediately advanced
with my whole army, which was now eight men, viz.
myself, generalissimo ; Friday, my lieutenant general;
the captain, and his two men, and the three prisoners
of war, whom we had trusted with arms.
We came upon them indeed in the dark, so that
they could not see our number; and I made the man
they had left in the boat, who was now one of us, to
call them by name, to try if he could bring them to
parley, which fell out just as we desired. So he calls
out, as loud as he could to one of them, "Tom
Smith! Tom Smith!" Tom Smith answered im-
mediately, "Who's that Robinson!" for it seems he
knew his voice. The other answered, "Aye, aye;
for God's sake, Tom Smith throw down your arms,
and yield, or you are all dead men this moment!"
"Who must we yield to?—Where are they?" says
Tom Smith again. "Here they are," says he. "Here
is our captain, and fifty men with him, have been
hunting you this two hours. The boatswain is killed,
Will Frye is wounded, and I am a prisoner; if you
do not yield, you are all lost."
"Will they give us quarter then," says Tom Smith,
"and we will yield."—" I'll go and ask, if you pro-
mise to yield," says Robinson. So he asked the
captain, and the captain himself then called out,
"You, Smith, you know my voice; if you lay down
your arms immediately, and submit. you shall all
have your lives, all but Will Atkins."'
Upon this, Will Atkins cried out, "For God's
sake, captain, give me quarter! What have I done?
They have all been as bad as I!" which was not true,
for it seems this Will Atkins was the first man that
laid hold of the captain when they first mutinied.
However, the captain told him he must lay down his
arms at discretion, and trust to the governor's mercy,
by which he meant me, for they called me governor.
In a word, they all laid down their arms, and
begged their lives; and I sent the man that had
parleyed with them, and two more, who bound them
all; and then my great army of fifty men, which
particularly with those three, were all but eight,
came up and seized upon them all, and upon their
boat, only that I kept myself and one more out of
sight, for reasons of state.
Our next work was to repair the boat, and to think of seizing the ship; and as for the captain, now he
had leisure to parley with them, he expostulated
with them upon the villainy of their practices with
him, and how certainly it must bring them to misery
and distress in the end, and perhaps to the gallows.
They all appeared very penitent, and begged hard
for their lives. As for that he told them that the
governor was an Englishman; and that he might
hang them all there if he pleased; but, as he had
given them quarter, he supposed he would send them
to England, except Atkins, whom he was commanded
by the governor to advise to prepare for death, for
that he would be hanged in the morning. Though
this was all a fiction of his own, yet it had the de-
sired effect; Atkins fell upon his knees to beg the
captain to intercede with the governor for his life;
and all the rest begged of him, for God's sake not to
be sent to England.
It now occurred to me that the time of our deli-
verance was come, and that it would be a most easy
thing to bring these fellows in, to be hearty in getting
possession of the ship. So I retired in the dark from
them, that they might not see what kind of a gover-
nor they had, and called the captain to me. When
I called, as at a good distance, one of the men was
ordered to speak again, and say to the captain,
"Captain, the commander calls for you;" and pre-
sently the captain replied, "Tell his excellency I am just a-coming." So they all believed the com-
mander was just by, with his fifty men.
Upon the captain's coming to me, I told him my
project for seizing the ship, which pleased him, and
resolved to put it in execution the next morning.
But in order to execute it with more art, and to be
sure of success, I told him we must divide the pri-
soners, and that he should go and take Atkins and
two more of the worst of them, and send them bound
to the cave where the others lay. So Friday, and
the two men who came on shore with the captain,
conveyed them to the cave as to a prison. The other
I ordered to my bower, where they were pinioned,
and left secure enough.
To these, in the morning I sent the captain, who
was to enter into a .parley with them ; in a word, to
try them, and tell me whether he thought they might
be trusted or no, to go on board and surprise the ship.
He talked to them of the injury done him, of the
condition they were brought to, and that though
the governor had given them quarter for their lives,
as to the present action, yet that if they were sent to
England, they would all be hanged in chains; but
that if they would join in so just an attempt as to
recover the ship, he would have the governor's en-
gagement for their pardon.
Any one may guess how readily such a proposal
would be accepted by men in their condition; they
fell down on their knees to the captain, and promised,
with deep imprecations, that they would be faith-
ful to him to the last drop, and that they should owe
their lives to him, and would go with him all over
the world; that they would own him for a father to
them as long as they lived. "Well," says the cap-
tain, " I must go and tell the governor what you say,
and see what I can do to bring him to consent to it."
So he brought me an account of the temper he found
them in, and that he verily believed they would be
faithful. However, that we might be very secure,
I told him he should go back again, and choose out
five of them, and tell them that they should see that
they did not want men, but he would take out those
five to be his assistants, and that the governor would
keep the other two, and the three that were sent
prisoners to the castle (my cave,) as hostages for the
fidelity of those five; and if they proved unfaithful in
the execution, the five hostages should be hanged in
chains alive upon the shore.
This looked severe, and convinced them that the
governor was in earnest. However, they had no
way left them but to accept it; and it was now the
business of the prisoners, as much as of the captain,
to persuade the other five to do'their duty. Our
strength was now thus ordered for the expedition:—
First, the captain, his mate, and passenger. Second,
then the two prisoners of the first gang, to whom,
having their characters from the captain, I had
given their liberty, and trusted them with arms.
Third, the other two, whom I had kept in my bower
till now pinioned, were now released. Fourth, these
five released, at last; so that there were twelve in
all, besides five we kept in the cave, as hostages for
the fidelity of the others.
I asked the captain if he was willing to venture
with those hands on board the ship; for as for me
and my man Friday, I did not think it proper for us
to stir, having seven men left behind; and it was
employment enough for us to keep them asunder,
and supply them with victuals.
As to the five in the cave, I resolved to keep them fast; but Friday went twice a-day to them, to sup-
ply them with necessaries; and I made the other
two carry provisions to a certain distance, where
Friday was to take it.
When I showed myself to the two hostages, it was
with the captain, who told them I was the person the
governor had ordered to look after them, and that it
was the governor's pleasure they should not stir any
where, but by my direction; that if they did, they
should be fetched to the castle and be laid in irons;
so that we never suffered them to see me as governor,
so now I appeared as another person, and spoke
of the governor, the garrison, the castle, and the
like, upon all occasions.
The captain now had no difficulty before him, but
to furnish his two boats, stop the breach of one^ and
man them. he made his passenger captain of one.
with four other men: and himself, and his mate, and
five more, went in the other. And they contrived
their business very well; for they came up to the ship
about midnight. As soon as they came within call
of the ship, ne made Robinson hail them, and tell
them he had brought off the men and the boat, but that it was a long time before they had found them,
and the like; holding them in chat, till they came
to the ship's side; when the captain and the mate,
entering first with their arms, immediately knocked
down the second mate and the carpenter with the
butt-end of their muskets, being very faithfully
seconded by their men. They secured all the rest
that were upon the main and quarter-decks, and be-
gan to fasten the hatches to keep them down who
were below, when the other boat, and their men
entering at the fore-chains, secured the forecastle of
the ship, and the scuttle which went down into the
cook-room, making three men they found there pri-
soners. When this was done, and all safe upon the
deck, the captain ordered the mate, with three men.
to break into the round-house, where the new rebel
captain lay, and he having taken the alarm, was
gotten up, and with two men and a boy, had gotten
fire-arms in their hands; and when the mate, with a
crew, split open the door, the new captain and his
men fired boldly among them, and wounded the
mate with a musket-ball, which broke his arm, and
wounded two more of the men, but killed nobody.
The mate calling for help, rushed, however, into
the round-house, wounded as he was, and, with his
pistol, shot the new captain through the head, the
bullet entering at his mouth, and came out again
behind one of his ears, so that he never spoke a word;
upon which the rest yielded, and the ship was taken
effectually, without any more lives lost. As soon as
the ship was thus secured, the captain ordered seven
guns to be fired, which was the signal agreed upon
with me, to give me notice of his success, which, you
may be sure, I was glad to hear, having sat watching
upon the shore for it till two o'clock-in the morning.
Having heard the signal plainly, I laid me down,
and being very much fatigued, I fell sound asleep,
when shortly I was awoke by the noise of a gun; and
starting up, I heard a man call me by the name of
"Governor," and presently I knew the captain's
voice, when climbing up to the top of the hill, there
he stood, and pointing to the ship, he embraced me
in his arms. "My dear friend and deliverer," says
he, " there's your ship; for she is all yours, and so
are we, and all that belongs to her." I cast my eyes
to the ship, and there she rode, about half a mile off
the shore, for they had weighed her anchor as soon
as they were masters of her, and the weather being
fair, had brought her to an anchor just against the
mouth of a little creek, and the tide being up, they
had brought the pinnace in near the place where I first landed my rafts, and so landed just at my door.
I was, at first, ready to sink down with surprise,
for I saw my deliverance indeed visibly put into my
hands, all things easy, and a large ship just ready to
carry me away whither I pleased to go. He per-
ceived my situation, and immediately pulls a bottle
out of his pocket, and gave me a dram of cordial,
which he had brought on purpose for me. After I
drank it, I sat down upon the ground, and it was a
good while before I could speak to him.
After some time, I came to myself, and then I em-
braced him in my turn, as my deliverer, and we re-
joiced together. I told him, I looked upon him as a
man sent from heaven to deliver me, and that the
whole transaction seemed to be a chain of wonders;
that such things as these were the testimonies we
had of a secret hand of Providence governing the
world, and an evidence that the eyes of an infinite
Power could search into the remotest corner of the
world, and send help to the miserable whenever he
pleased: and I forgot not to return thanks to God
for all his mercies.
When we had talked a while, the captain told me
he had brought me some little refreshment, such as
the ship afforded, and such as the wretches, who had
been so long his masters, had not plundered him of.
Upon this he called aloud to his men, and told them
to bring the things ashore that were for the governor:
and, indeed, it was a splendid present. First, he had
brought me a case of bottles full of cordial waters,
six large bottles of Madeira wine, two pounds of ex-
cellent tobacco, twelve good pieces of the ship's beef,
and six pieces of pork, with a bagof pease, and about
a hundred weight of tobacco. He brought me also
a box of sugar, a box of flour, a bag full of lemons,
and two bottles of lime juice, and abundance of other
things. But, besides these, and what was a thousand
times more useful to me, he brought me six clean new
shirts, six very good neckcloths, two pair of gloves,
one pair of shoes, a hat, and one pair of stockings, and a very good suit of clothes of his own, which had
been worn very little; but the clothes felt very
awkward and uneasy upon me at first.
After all these things were brought into my little
apartment. we began to consult what was to be done
with the prisoners we had, and whether we might
venture to take them away with us or no, especially
two of them, whom we knew to be incorrigible and
refractory to the last degree, and the captain said he
knew that they were such rogues, that there was no
obliging them; and if he did carry them away, it
must be in irons, as malefactors, to be delivered over
to justice, at the first English colony he could come
at. Upon this I told him, I durst undertake to bring
the two men he spoke of to make it their own request
that he should leave them upon the island, of which
the captain said he should be very glad. 1 accord-
ingly sent for them, and entered seriously into dis-
course with them upon their circumstances. One of
them answered in the name of the rest, that they had
nothing to say but this, that when they were taken,
the captain promised them their lives, and they hum-
bly implored my mercy. But I told them 1 knew
not what mercy to show them ; for, as for myself, I
had resolved to quit the island with all my men, and
had taken passage with the captain to go to England;
and as for the captain, he would not carry them to
England, but as prisoners in irons, to be tried for
mutiny and running away with the ship; the conse-
quence of which, they must needs know. would be the
gallows: so that I could not tell which was best for
them, unless they had a mind to take their fate in
the island; if they desired that, I did not care, as I
had liberty to leave it. I had some inclination to
give them their lives, if they could shift on shore.
They seemed very thankful for it; and said they
would rather venture to stay there, than to be carried
to England to be hanged.
I then told them, I would let them into the story
of my living there, and put them into the way of
making it easy to them. Accordingly I gave them
the whole history of the place, and of my coming to
it; showed them my fortifications, the way I made
my bread, planted my corn, cured my grapes, and,
R 2
in a word, all that was necessary to make them easy.
I told them the story of the Spaniards that were to
be expected, for whom I left a letter, and made them
promise to treat them in common with themselves.
I left them five muskets, three fowling-pieces, and
three swords. I had about a barrel and a half of
powder, which I left them. I gave them a descrip-
tion of the way I managed the goats, and directions
to milk and fatten them, to make both butter and
cheese. In a word, I gave them every part of my
own story; and I told them I would prevail with the
captain to leave them two barrels of gunpowder more, and some garden seeds, which I told them I would have been very glad of; also I gave them the
bag of pease which the captain had brought me, and
bade them to be sure to sow and increase them.
Having done all this, I left them the next day, and
went on board the ship. The next morning two of
the five men came swimming to the ship's side, and
making a most lamentable complaint of the other
three, begged to be taken into the ship, for God's
sake, for they should be murdered.
The captain pretended to have no power without
me : but, after some difficulty, and after their solemn
promises of amendment, they were taken on board,
and were shortly after soundly whipped, after which
they proved very honest and quiet fellows.
Some time after this, I went with the boat on shore,
the tide being up, with the things promised to the
men, with which the captain, at my interceasion. sent
their chests and clothes, which they took, and were
very thankful for. I also encouraged them, by telling
them that if it lay in my way to send any vessel to
take them in, I would not forget them.
When I quitted this island, I carried on board, for
relics, the great goat-skin cap I had made, my um-
brella, and one of my parrots; also I forgot not to
take the money I had had laid by me so long useless.
And thus I left the island, the 10th of December,
by the chip's account, in the year Ifi86, after I had
been upon it twenty-eight years, two months, and
nineteen days; being delivered from the second cap-
tivity the same day of the month that I made my
escape from among the Moors at Sallee.
In this vessel, after a long voyage, I arrived in
England, the llth of June, m the year 1687, having
been thirty-five years absent.
When I came to England, I was as perfect a
stranger as if I had never been known there. My
benefactor and faithful steward, whom I left in trust
with my money, was alive, but had had great mis-
fortunes in the world, was become a widow the second
time, and was in very low circumstances. I made her
easy as to what she owed me, assuring her I would
give her no trouble: butj on the contrary, in gratitude
to her former care and faithfulness to me, I relieved
her as much as my little stock would afford, which
at that time, would indeed allow me to do but little
for her; but I assured her I would never forget her
former kindness to me: nor did I forget her, when I
had sufficient to help her, at a future time.
I went down afterwards into Yorkshire; but my
father was dead, and my mother, and all the family
extinct, except two sisters, and two of the children-
of one of my brothers; and as I had been long ago
given over for dead, there had been no provision made
for me, so that, in a word, I found nothing to relieve
or assist me, and the little money I had would not
do much for me, as to settling in the world.
I met with one piece of gratitude, indeed, which I did not expect; and this was, that the master of the
ship, whom I had so happily delivered, having given
a very handsome account to the owners of the man-
ner how I had saved the lives of the men and the
ship, they invited me to meet them, and some other
merchants concerned, and all together made me a
very handsome compliment upon the subject, and a
present of almost two hundred pounds sterling.
But, after making several reflections upon the cir-
cumstances of my life, and how little way this would
go towards settling me in the world, I resolved to go
to Lisbon, and see if I could get any information of
the state of my plantation in the Brazils, and of what
was become of my partner, who. I supposed, had for
some years now given me over for dead.
With this view, I took shipping for Lisbon, where
I arrived in April following: my man Friday accom-
panying me very honestly in all these ramblings, and
proving a most faithful servant upon all occasions.
When I came to Lisbon, I found out by inquiry, and
to my particular satisfaction, my old friend, the cap-
tain of the ship, who first took me up at sea, off the
shore of Africa. He was now grown old, ai;d had
left off the sea, having put his son into the ship, and
who still used the Brazil trade. The old man did not
know me, and I scarcely knew him; but he soon
recollected me, when I told him who I was.
After some passionate expressions of our old ac-
quaintance, I enquired after my plantation and my
partner. The old man told me he had not been in
the Brazils for about nine years; but that he could
assure me, that when he came away my partner was
living, but that the trustees, whom I had joined with
him to take cognizance of my part, were both dead;
that, however, he believed that I should have a very
good account of the improvement of the plantation,
for that, in the general belief of my being cast away
and drowned, my trustees had given in the account
of the produce of my part of the plantation to the
procurator fiscal, who had appropriated it, in case I
never came to claim it, one-third to the king, and
two-thirds to the monastery of St. Augustine, to be
expended for the benefit of the poor, and for the con-
version of the Indians to the Catholic faith; but that
if I appeared, or any one for me, to claim the inhe-
ritance, it would be restored; only that the improve-
ment, or annual production, being, a he said, dis-
trlhuted to charitable uses, he thought could not be restored.
I was a little concerned and uneasy at this account,
and inquired of the old captain how it came to pass that the trustees should thus dispose of my effects,
when they knew that I had made my will, and made
him, the Portuguese captain, my universal heir, &c.
He told me that was true, but as there was no proof
of my being dead, he could not act as executor, until
some certain account should come of my death; and
that, besides, he was not willing to intermeddle with
a thing so remote: that it was true, he had registered
my will, and put in his claim, and could he have
given any account of my being dead or alive, he would
have acted by procuration, and taken possession of
my ingenio (the sugar-house,) and given his son, who
was now in the Brazils, orders to do it.
The old man then asked me if he should put me in
a method to make my claim to my plantation. I
told him I thought to go over to it myself. He said
I might do so if I pleased; but that if I did not,
there were ways enough to secure my right, and im-
mediately to appropriate the profits to my use; and
as there were ships in the river of Lisbon just ready
to go to the Brazils, he made me enter my name in
a public register, with his affidavit, affirming, upon
oath, that I was alive, and that I was the same per-
son who took up the land for planting the said plan-
tation at first. This being regularly attested by a
notary, and a procuration affixed, he directed me to
send it, with a letter of his writing, to a merchant of
his acquaintance at the place, and then proposed my
staying with him till an account came of the return.
Never any thing was more honourable than the
proceedings upon this procuration; for in less than
seven months I received a large packet from the
survivors of my trustees, the merchants for whose
account I went to sea; and as the Brazils ships come
all in fleets, the same ships which brought my letters brought my goods, and the effects were safe in the
Tagus before the letters came to my hands. By
these, it appeared I was now master, all on a sudden,
of above five thousand pounds sterling in money, and
had an estate, as I might well call it, in the Brazils,
of above a thousand pounds a year, as sure as an
estate of lands in England; and, in a word, I was in
a condition which I scarce knew how to understand,
or how to compose myself for the enjoyment of.
The first thing I did was to recompense my original
benefactor, my"gpod old captain, who had been first
charitable to me in my distress, kind to me in the
beginning, and honest to me at the end. I showed
him all that was sent me. Itold him that, next to
the providence of Heaven, which disposes all things,
it was owing to him; and that it now lay on me to
reward him. So I sent for a notary, and caused him
to draw a procuration, empowering him to be my re-
ceiver of the annual profits of my plantation, and
appointing my partner to account to him, and make
the returns by the usual fleets to him, in my name.
And a clause in the end, being a grant of one hundred
moidorcs a year to him, during his life, out of the
effects; and fifty moidores a year to his son after
him, for his life: and thus I requited my old man.
I was now to consider which way to steer my
course next, and what to do with the estate that Pro-
vidence had thus put into my hands; and, indeed, I
had more care upon my head now, than I had in my
silent state of life on the island, where I wanted
nothing but what I had, and had nothing but what I
wanted; whereas I had now a great charge upon me,
and my business was how to secure my money. I
knew no where to put it, or whom to trust with it;
my old patron the captain, indeed, was honest, and
- that was the only refuge I had. In the next place,
my interest in the Brazils seemed to summon me
thither; but now I could not tell how to think of
going thither till I had settled my affairs. At first, I
thought of my old friend the widow, who I knew was
honest, and would be just to me; but then she was
in years, and but poor, and, for aught I knew, might
be in debt; so that, in a word, I had no way but to go
back to England myself, and take my effects with me. I was some months, however, before I resolved
upon this; and therefore as I had rewarded the old
captain fully, and to his satisfaction, who had been
my former benefactor, so I began to think of my poor
widow, whose husband had been my first benefactor,
and she, while it was in her power, my faithful stew-
ard and instructor. So the first thing I did, I got a
merchant in Lisbon to write to his correspondent in
London, not only to pay a bill, but to go find her out,
and carry her in money a hundred pounds from me, and to talk with her and comfort her in her poverty,
by telling her she should, if I lived, have a further supply. At the same time, I sent my two sisters in
the country, each of them a hundred pounds, they
being, though not in want, yet not in very good cir-
cumstances, one having been married, and left a
widow, and the other having a husband, not so kind
to her as he should be. But among all my relations
or acquaintances, I could not yet pitch upon one to
whom I durst commit the gross of my stock.
I had once a mind to have gone to the Brazils, and
have settled myself there, for I was, as it were, natu-
ralized to the place, but that I really did not know
with whom to leave my effects behind me; so I
resolved at last to go to England with them, where,
if I arrived, I concluded I should make some acquaint-
ance, or find some relations that would be faithful to
me, and accordingly I prepared to go for England
with all my wealth. Having settled my affairs, sold
my cargo, and turned all my effects into good bills
of exchange, my next difficulty was which way to go
to England. I had been accustomed enough to the
sea, and yet I had a strange aversion I o go to England
by sea at that time; and though I could give no
reason for it, yet the difficulty increased upon me BO
much, that though I had once shipped my baggage
in order to go, yet I altered my mind, and that not
once, but two or three times.
1 t is true I had been very unfortunate by sea, and
this might be one of the reasons: but let no man
strike the strong impulses of his own thoughts in
cases of such moment. Two ships, each of which
I had engaged to go in, but again withdrew my
agreement, miscarried, viz. one was taken by the
Algerines, and the other was cast away on the Start, near Torbay, and all the peopledrowned, except three;
so that in either of those vessels I had been made
miserable, and in which most, it was hard to say.
Having been thus harrassed in my thoughts, my old pilot, to whom I communicated every thing, pressed
me earnestly not to go by sea; but either to go by
land to the 'Groyne, and cross over the Bay of Biscay
to Rochelle, from whence it was but an easy and safe
journey by land to Paris, and so to Calais and Dover;
or go up to Madrid, and so all the way by land
through France. In a word, I was so prepossessed
against my going by sea at all, except from Calais to
Dover, that I resolved to travel all the way by land,
which, as I was not in haste, and did not value the
charge, was by much the pleasanter way; and to
make it more so, my old captain brought an English
gentleman, the son of a merchant in Lisbon, who was
willing to travel with me; after which we picked up
two more, who were English, and merchants also,
and two young Portuguese gentlemen, the last going
to Paris only, so that we were in all six of us, and
five servants; the two merchants, and the two Por-
tuguese, contenting themselves with one servant be-
tween two, to save the charge; and as for me, I got
an English sailor to travel with me as a servant, be-
sides my man Friday, who was too much a stranger
to be capable of supplying the place of a servant upon
the road.
111 this manner we set out from Lisbon; and our
company being all very well mounted and armed, we
made a little troop, whereof they did me the honour
to call me captain, as well because I was the oldest
man, as because I had two servants, and indeed was
the original of the whole journey.
When we came to Madrid, we, being all of us
strangers to Spain, were willing to stay some time
to see the court of Spain, and to see what was worth
observing; but it being the latter part of the summer,
we hastened away, and set out from Madrid about
the middle of October. But when we came to the
edge of Navarre, we were alarmed at several towns
on the way, with an account that so much snow was
fallen on the French side of the mountains, that seve-
ral travellers were obliged to come back to Pampe-
luna, after having attempted to pass on.
When we came to Pampeluna itself, we found it so
indeed; and to me, that had been always used to a hot
climate, and indeed to countries where we could
scarce bear any clothes on, the cold was insufferable.
Nor indeed was it more painful than it was surprising,
to come but ten days before out of Old Castile, where
the weather was not only warm, but very hot, and
immediately to feel a wind from the Pyrenean moun-
tains, so severely cold, as to be intolerable, and to
endanger benumbing and perishing of our fingers and
toes. Poor Friday was really frightened when he
saw the mountains covered with snow, and felt cold
weather, which he had never seen or felt before in
his life.
To mend the matter, after we came to Pampeluna,
it continued snowing with so much violence, and so
long, that the people said winter was come before its
time, and the roads, which were difficult before, were
now quite impassable; and the snow not being hard
frozen, as is the case in the northern countries, there
was no going without being in danger of being buried
alive every step. We stayed no less than twenty
days at Pampeluna, when I proposed that we should
all go away to Fontarabia, and there take shipping
for Bordeaux, which was a very little voyage.
But while we were considering this, there came in
four French gentlemen, who, having been stopped
on the French side of the passes as we were on the
Spanish, had found out a guide, who traversing the
country near the head of Languedoc, had brought
them over the mountains by such ways, that they
were not much incommoded with the snow: and
where they met with snow in any quantity, they said
it was frozen hard enough to bear them and their horses.
We sent for this guide, who told us he would un-
dertake to carry us the same way, with no hazard
from the snow provided we were armed sufficiently
to protect us from wild beasts; for he said, upon
these great snows it was frequent for some wolves to
show themselves at the foot of the mountains, being
made ravenous for want of food, the ground being covered with snow. We told him we were well
enough prepared for such creatures as they were, if
he would ensure us from a kind of two-legged wolves,
which we were told we were in most danger from,
especially on the French side of the mountains.
He satisfied us there was no danger of that kind in
the way that we were to go. So we readily agreed
to follow him, as did also twelve other gentlemen,
with their servants, some French, some Spanish, who,
as I said, had attempted to go, and were obliged to
come back again.
Accordingly we all set out from Pampeluna. with
our guide, on the 15th of November; and indeed I
was surprised, when, instead of going forward, he
came directly back with us, on the same road that
we came from Madrid, above twenty miles; when
having passed two rivers, and come into the plain
country, we found ourselves in a warm climate again,
where the country was pleasant, and no snow was to
be seen; but on a sudden, turning to the left, he
approached the mountains another way; and though,
it is true, the hills and the precipices looked dread-
ful, yet he made so many tours, such meanders, and
led us by such winding ways, we were insensibly
passed the height of the mountains without being
much encumbered with the snow; and, all on a sud-
den, he showed us the pleasant fruitful provinces of
Languedoc and Gascoigne, all green and flourishing,
though indeed they were at a great distance, and we
had some rough way to pass yet.
We were a little uneasy, however, when we found
it snowed one whole day, and at night so fast that
we could not travel; but he bade us be easy, we
should soon be past it all. We found, indeed, that
we began to descend every day, and to come more
north than before; and so, depending upon our guide,
we went on.
It was about two hours before night, when our
guide being something before us, and not just in sight,
out rushed three monstrous wolves, and after them a
bear, out of a hollow way, adjoining to a thick wood.
Two of the wolves flew upon the guide, and had he
been half a mile before us, he had been devoured
indeed, before we could have helped him. One of
them fastened upon his horse, and the other attacked
the man with that violonee, that he had not time, or
not presence of mind enough to draw his pistol, but
hallooed and cried out to us most lustily. My man
Friday being next to me, I bade him ride up, and see
what was the matter. As soon as Friday came in
sight of the man, he hallooed as loud as the other,
"O master! O master!" bat, like a bold fellow, rode
directly up to the man, and, with a pistol, shot the
wolf that attacked him into the head.
It was happy for the poor man that it was my man
Friday; for he, having been used to that kind of
creature in his country, had no fear upon him, but
went up close to him, and shot him as above: whereas
any of us would have fired at a farther distance, and
have, perhaps, either missed the wolf, or endangered
shooting the man.
But it was enough to have terrified a bolder man
than I ; and indeed it alarmed all our company,
when, with the noise of Friday's pistol, we heard on
both sides the most dismal howling of wolves, and
the noise redoubled by the echo of the mountains,
and it was to us as if there had been a prodigious
multitude of them; and perhaps, indeed, there were
not such afew, as that we had no cause of apprehension.
However, as Friday had killed this wolf, the other,
that had fastened upon the horse, left him immedi-
ately, and fled, having happily fastened upon his
head, where the bosses of the bridle had stuck in his
teeth, so that he had not done him much hurt. The
man, indeed, was most hurt; for the raging creature
had bit him twice, once on the arm, and the other
time a little above his knee; and he was just, as it
were, tumbling down by the disorder of his horse,
when Friday came up and shot the wolf.
It is easy to suppose, that at the noise of Friday's
pistol we all mended our pace, and rode up as fast as
the way (which was very difficult) would give us
leave, to see what was the matter. As soon as we
came clear of the trees, which blinded us before, we
saw plainly what had been the case, ai:d how Friday
had disengaged the poor guide, though we did not
presently discern what kind of creature it was he had
killed.
My man Friday had delivered our guide, and when
we came up to him he was helping him off from his
horse, for the man was both hurt and frightened, and
indeed the last more than the first, when on a sudden
we spied the bear come out of the wood, and a vast
monstrous one it was, the biggest by far that ever I
saw. We were all a little surprised when we saw
him; but when Friday saw him, it was easy to see
joy and courage in the fellow's countenance. "O!
O! O I" says Friday, three times, pointing to him;
"O, master! you give me te leave, me slmkee te
hand with him, me makee you good laugh."
I was surprised to see the fellow so pleased. "You
fool, you," said I, " he will eat you up!"—" Eatee me
up! eatee me up!" says Friday, twice over again.
"Me eatee him up: me show you good laugh. So
down he sits, and gets his boots off in a moment, and
put on a pair of pumps, which he had in his pocket,
gives my other servant his horse, and with his gun
away he went, swift like the wind.
The bear was walking softly on, and offered to
meddle with nobody, till Friday, coming pretty near,
calls to him, as if the bear could understand him,
"Hark ye, hark ye," says Friday, "me speakee wit
you." We followed at a distance, for now being
come down to the Gascoigne side of the mountains,
we entered a vast great forest, where the country
was plain, and pretty open, though many trees in it
scattered here and there.
Friday, who had, as we say. the heels of the bear,
came up with him quickly, and takes up a great
stone and throws it at him, and hit him just on the
head, but did him no more harm than if he had
thrown it against a wall; but it answered Friday's
cud, for the rogue was so void of fear that he did it
purely to make the bear follow him, and "show us
some laugh," as he called it.
As soon as the bear felt the stone, and saw him, he
turns about, aud comes after him, taking very long
strides, and shuffling along at a strange rate, so as
would put a horse to a middling gallop. Away runs
Friday, and takes his course, as if he ran towards us
for help; so we all resolved to fire at once upon the
bear, and deliver my man, though I was angry at
him heartily for bringing the bear back upon us,
when he was going about his own business another
way; and especially I was angry that he had turned
the bear upon us, and then run away; and I called
out, "You dog," said 1, "is this your making use laugh? Come away, and take your horse, that we
may shoot the creature." He hears me, and cries
out, " No shoot, no shoot! Stand still: you get much laugh." And as the nimble creature ran two feet for
the beast's one, he turned, on a sudden, on one side
of us, and seeing a great oak tree, fit for his purpose,
he beckoned us to follow, and doubling his pace, he
gets nimbly up the tree, laying his gun down upon
the ground, at about five or six yards from the bottom
of the tree.
The bear soon came to the tree, and we followed at
a distance. The first thing he did, he stopped at the
gun, smelt at it, but let it lie, and up he scrambles
into the tree, climbing like a cat, though so mon-
strously heavy. I was amazed at the folly, as I thought it, of my man, and could not for my life see
any thing to laugh at yet, till, seeing the bear get
up the tree, we all rode nearer to him.
When we came to the tree, there was Friday got
out to the small end of a large limb of the tree, and
the bear got about half way to him; as soon as the
bear got out to that part where the limb of the tree
was weaker, " Ha," says he, to us, "now you see me
teachee the bear dance;" so he falls a jumping, and
shaking the bough, at which the bear began to totter,
and stood to look behind him, to see how he should
get back; then, indeed, we did laugh heartily. But
Friday had not done with him by a great deal: when
he sees him stand still. he calls out to him again, as
if he had supposed the bear could speak English,
"What, you no come farther? Pray you come far-
ther." So he left jumping and shaking the bough,
and the bear, just as if he had understood what he
said, did come a little farther: then he fell a jumping
again, and the bear stopped again.
We thought now was a good time to knock him on
the head, and I called to"Friday to stand still and
we would shoot the bear; but he cried out earnestly,
"O pray! O pray! no shoot! Me shoot by and
then." He would have said, "By and by." How-
ever, to shorten the story, Friday danced so much,
and the bear stood so ticklish, that we had laughing
enough indeed, but still could not imagine what the
fellow would do; for first we thought he depended
upon shaking the bear off, and we found the bear was
too cunning for that too, for he would not go out far
enough to be thrown down, but clings fast with his
great broad claws and feet, so that we could not
imagine what would be the end of it, and where the
jest would be at last.
But Friday put us out of doubt shortly, for seeing
the bear cling fast to the bough, and that he would
not come any farther, "Well, well," says Friday,
"you no come farther, me go, me go; you no come
to me, me come to you." And upon this he goes out
to the smallest end of the bough, where it would bend
with his weight, and gently lets himself down by it,
sliding down the bough, till he came near enough to
jump down on his feet, and away he ran to his gun,
takes it up, and stands still.
"Well/' said I to him, " Friday, what will you do
now? Why don't you shoot him ?"—" No shoot,"
says Friday, " no yet, me shoot now, me no kill; me
stay, give you one more laugh." And so he did; for
when the bear saw his enemy gone, he comes back
from the bough where he stood, but did it mighty
leisurely, looking behind him every step, and coming
backward till he got into the body of the tree. Then
with the same hinder end foremost, he came down
the tree, grasping it with his claws, and moving one
foot at a time very leisurely: at this juncture, and
just before he could set his hind feet upon the ground,
Friday stepped close to him, clapped the muzzle of
his piece into his ear, and shot him dead as a stone.
Then the rogue turned about, to see if we did not
laugh; and when he saw we were pleased by our
looks, he falls a laughing himself very loud. "So w«
kill bear in my country," says Friday. "So you kill
s
them!" said I , "why you have no guns."—" No,"
says he,"no gun; but shoot great, much, long arrow."
This was, indeed, a good diversion to us, but we
were still in a wild place, and our guide very much
hurt, and what to do we hardly knew; the howling
of wolves ran much in my head; and indeed, except
the noise I once heard on the shores of Africa, of
which I have said something already, I never heard
any thing that filled me with so much horror.
These things, and the approach of night, called us
off, or else, as Friday would have had us, we should
certainly have taken the skin of this monstrous
creature off, which was worth saving; but we had
three leagues to go, and our guide hastened us: so
we left him, and went forward on our journey.
We had one dangerous place to pass, of which our
guide told us, if there were any more wolves in the
country we should find them there; and this was a
small plain, surrounded with woods on every side,
and a long, narrow defile, or lane, which we were to
pass, to get through the wood, and then we should
come to a village where we were to lodge.
It was within half an hour of sunset when we en-
tered the first wood; and a little after sunset, we
came into the plain. We met with nothing in the
first wood, except that, in a little plain, within the
wood, which was not above two furlongs over, we saw
five great wolves cross the road, full speed, one after
another, a? if they had been in chase of some prey,
and had it in view. They took no notice of us, and
were gone, and out of our sight in a few moments.
Upon this, our guide, who, by the way, was a
wretched faint-hearted fellow, bade us keep in a
ready posture, for he believed there were more wolves
a-coming.
We kept our arms ready, and our eyes about us,
but we saw no more wolves till we came through
that wood, which was near half a league, and entered
the plain. As soon as we came into the plain, we
had occasion enough to look about us. The first
object we met with was a dead horse; that is to say,
a poor horse, which the wolves had killed, and at
least a dozen of them at work, we could not say eating
of him, but picking his bones rather, for they had
eaten up all the flesh before. We did not think fit
to disturb them at their feast, neither did they take
much notice of us. Friday would have let fly at
them, but I would not suffer him by any means, for
I found we were like to have more business upon our
hands than we were aware of. We were not gone
half over the plain, but we began to hear the wolves
howl, in the wood on our left, in a dreadful manner;
and, presently after we saw about a hundred coming
on directly towards us, all in a body, and most of
them in a line, as regular as an army drawn up by
experienced officers. I scarce knew m what manner
to receive them; but found to draw ourselves in a
close line was the only way. So we formed in a mo-
ment. But that we might not have too much interval,
I ordered that only every other man should fire, and
that the others, who had not fired, should be ready
to give them a second volley immediately, if they
continued to advance upon us; and that then those
who had fired at first should not pretend to load their
fusils again, but stand ready with every one a pistol,
for we were all armed with a fusil and a pair of pis-
tols each man; so we were by this method, able to
fire six volleys, half of us at a time. However, at
present, we had no necessity, for, upon firing the first
volley, the enemy made a full stop, being terrified as
well with the noise as with the fire: four of them
being shot into the head, dropped; several others
were wounded, and went bleeding off, as we could
see by the snow. I found they stopped, but did not
immediately retreat, whereupon, remembering that
I had been told, that the fiercest creatures were ter-
rified at the voice of a man, I caused all our com-
pany to halloo as loud as we could : and I found the
8 2
notion not altogether mistaken; for, upon our shout,
they began to retire, and turn about; then I ordered
a second volley to be fired in their rear, which put
them to the gallop, and away they went to the woods.
This gave us leisure to charge our pieces again, and
that we might lose no time, we kept going; but we
had little more than loaded our fusils, and put our-
selves into readiness, when we heard a terrible noise
in the same wood on our left.
The night was coming on, and the light began to
be dusky, which made it the worse on our side; but
the noise increasing, we could easily perceive that it
was the howling of those ravenous creatures; and,
on a sudden, we perceived two or three troops of
wolves, one on our left, one behind us, and one in our
front, and we knew not what course to take; but the
creatures resolved us soon, for they gathered about
us, in hopes of prey; and I verily believe there were
three hundred of them. It happened, very much to
our advantage, that at the entrance into the wood,
there lay some large timber trees, cut down, and I drew my little troop in among these trees, and placing
ourselves in a line, behind one long tree, I advised
them all to alight, and, keeping that tree before us,
for a breastwork, to stand in a triangle or three fronts,
enclosing our horses in the centre. We did so; ana
it was well we did, for never was a more furious
charge than the creatures made upon us in this place:
they came on us with a growling kind of noise, and
mounted the piece of timber, as if they were only
rushing upon their prey; and this fury of theirs, it
seems, was principally occasioned by their seeing
our horses behind us, which was the prey they aimed
at. I ordered our men to fire as before, every other
man, and they took their aim so sure, that they killed
several wolves at the first volley; but there was a
necessity to keep a continual firing, for they came on
like devils, those behind pushing on those before.
When we had fired the second volley of our fu&Us,
we thought they stopped a little, and I hoped they
would have gone off, but it was but a moment, for
others came forward again, so we fired two volleys
of our pistols, and, I believe, in these four firings we
killed seventeen or eighteen of them, and lamed
twice as many; yet they came on again.
I was loath to spend our last shot too hastily; so
I called my servant, not Friday, but my other man,
and, giving him a horn of powder, I bade him lay a
train all along the piece of timber, and let it be a
large train. He did so, and had but just time to get
away, when the wolves came up to it, and some were
got upon it, when 1, -snapping an uncharged pistol
close to the powder, set it on fire. Those that were
upon the timber were scorched with it, and six or
seven of them felf, or rather jumped, in among us,
with the force and fright of the fire. We despatched
these in an instant, and the rest were so frightened
with the light, that they drew back a little.
Upon which I ordered our last pistols to be fired
off in one volley, and after that we gave a shout:
upon this the wolves turned tail, and we sallied im-
mediately upon near twenty lame ones, whose dread-
ful crying and howling scared the rest, so that they
all fled, and left us.
We had, first and last, killed about threescore of
them, and had it been daylight, we had killed many
more. The field of battle being thus cleared, we
made forward again, for we had still near a league
to go. We heard the ravenous creatures howl and
yell in the woods as we went, several times; and
sometimes we fancied we saw some of them, but the
snow dazzling our eyes, we were not certain; so in
about an hour more, we came to the town where we
were to lodge, which we found in a terrible fright,
and all in arms; for it seems that, the night before,
the wolves and some bears had broke into the village,
to attack the cattle, and even the people.
The next morning our guide was so ill, and his limbs so swelled with the rankling of his two wounds, that he could go no farther, so we were obliged to
take another guide there, and go toThoulouse, where
we found a warm climate, a fruitful, pleasant coun-
try, and no snow, no wolves, or any thing like them.
I have nothing uncommon to take notice of in my
passage through France; nothing but what other
travellers have given an account of, with much more
advantage than I can. I travelled from Thoulouse
to Paris, and, without any considerable stay, came
to Calais, and landed safe at Dover, the 14th of Janu-
ary, after having had a severe cold season to travel in.
I was now come to the centre of my travels, and
had, in a little time, all T i\ new-discovered estate
safe about me; the bills of exchange which I had
brought with me having been currently paid. My
principal guide and privy-counsellor was my good,
old widow, who, in gratitude for the money I had
sent her, thought no pains too much, or care too
great, to employ for me.
I began to think of leaving my effects with this
woman, and setting out for Lisbon, and so to the
Brazils. But now another scruple came in my way,
and that was religion; for as I had entertained some
doubts about the Roman religion, even while I was
abroad, especially in my state of solitude, so I knew
there was no going to the Brazils for me, much less
going to settle there, unless I resolved to embrace
the Catholic religion, without]any reserve; except,
on the other hand, I resolved to be a sacrifice to my
principles, be a martyr for religion, and die in the
Inquisition; so I resolved to stay at home, and if I could find means, to dispose of my plantation.
To this purpose! wrote to my old friend at Lisbon,
who, in return, gave me notice that he could easily
dispose of it there; but that, if I thought fit to give
him leave to offer it in my name to'the two merchants,
the survivors of my trustees, who lived in the Brazils,
who must fully understand the value of it, who lived
just upon the spot, and whom I knew to be very
rich, so that he believed they would be fond of buying
it, he did not doubt, but I "should make four or five
thousand pieces of eight the more for it.
Accordingly I agreed, gave him orders to offer it
to them, and he did so; and in about eight months
more, the ships being then returned, he sent me an
account, that they had accepted the offer, and had
remitted thirty-three thousand pieces of eight to a
correspondent of theirs at Lisbon to pay for it.
In return, I signed the instrument of sale in the
form which they sent from Lisbon, and sent it to my
old man, who sent me bills of exchange for thirty-
two thousand eight hundred pieces of eight for the
estate, reserving the payment of one hundred moidores
a year to him, the old man, during his life, and fifty
moidores afterwards to his son for his life, which I
had promised them, and which the plantation was to
make good as a rent charge. And thus I have given
the first part of a life of fortune and adventure, a life
of Providence's checker-work, and of a variety which
the world will seldom be able to show the like of.
Beginning foolishly, but closing much more happily
than I had ever any reason even to hope for.
Any one would think that, in this state of compli-
cated good fortune, I was past running any more
hazards; but I was inured to a wandering life, had
no family, nor many relations, nor, however rich, had
I contracted much acquaintance; and though I had
sold my estate in the Brazils, yet I could not keep
that country out of my head, and had a great mind
to be upon the wing again, especially I could not re-
sist the strong inclination I had to see my island.
My true friend, the widow, earnestly dissuaded me
from it, and so far prevailed with me, that for almost
seven years she prevented my running abroad; du-
ring which time I took my two nephews, the children
of one of my brothers, into my care. The eldest,
having something of his own, I bred up as a gentle-
380 ROBINSON CRUSOE. man, and gave him a settlement of some addition to
his estate after my decease; the other I put out to
a captain of a ship, and after five years, finding him
a sensible, bold, enterprising young fellow, I put him
into a good ship, and sent him to sea. And this
young fellow afterwards drew me in, old as I was, to
farther adventures myself.r
In the mean time, I in part settled myself here:
for, first of all, I married, and had three children,
two sons and one daughter. But my wife dying,
and my nephew coming home, with good success,
from a voyage to Spain, my inclination to go abroad,
and his importunity, prevailed, and I engaged to go
in his ship as a private trader to the East Indies. In
this voyage, I visited my new colony in the island,
saw my successors, the Spaniards; had the whole
story of their coming to, and adventures in the
island, after my departure. All these things, with
some very surprising incidents, in some new adven-
tures of my own, for ten years more, I may, perhaps,
give a farther account of hereafter.
FARTHER ADVENTURES
ov
ROBINSON CRUSOE.
THAT homely proverb, used on so many occasions
in England, viz. that" What is bred in the bone will
not go out of the flesh," was never more verified than
in the story of my life. Any one would think that
after thirty-five years affliction, and a variety of
other circumstances, which few men, if any, ever
went through before. and after near seven years of
enjoyment in the fullness of all things, grown old,
and when, if ever, it might be allowed me to have
had experience of every state of middle life, and to
which was best adapted to make a man completely
happy: I say, after all this, any one would have
thought that the native propensitiy to rambling,
which I gave an account of, in my first setting out
into the world, to have been so predominant in my
thoughts, should be worn out, the volatile part be
fully evacuated, or at least condensed, and I might,
at sixty-one years of age, have been a little inclined
to stay at home, and have done venturing life and
fortune any more. Nay, farther, the common motive
of foreign adventures was taken away in me, for I
had no fortune to make; I had already sufficient for
me, and those I had to leave it to.
Yet all these things had no effect upon me, or at
least not enough to resist the strong inclination I had to go abroad again, which hung about me like a
chronicle distemper; particularly the desire of seeing
my new plantation in the island, and the colony I left
there, run in my head continually. I dreamed of it
all night, and my imagination ran upon it all day: it
was uppermost in my thoughts, and I talked of
it in my sleep. One time, I dreamed that the vil-
lany of the three pirate sailors was related to me, by
the first Spaniard, and Friday's father. They told
me how they barbourously attempted to murder all
the Spaniards, and that they set fire to the provi-
sions they had laid up, on purpose to distress and
starve them; things that I had never heard of, and
that indeed never were all of them true. And it was
so warm in my imagination, and so realized to me,
that, to the hour I saw them, I could not be per-
suaded but that it was, or would be true; also how
I resented it, when the Spaniards complained to
me; and how I brought them to justice, tried them
before me, and ordered them all three to be hanged.
In this kind of temper 1 had lived some years. I
had no enjoyment, no agreeable diversion, but what
had something or other of this in it, so that my wife,
who saw my mind so wholly bent upon it, told me
very seriously one night, that she believed there was
some secret, powerful impulse of providence upon
me, which had determined me to go thither again;
and that she found nothing hindered my going, but
my being engaged to a wife and children. She told
me, it was true she could not think of parting with
me, but she was assured, that if she was dead it
would be the first thing I should do, so it seemed to
her, that if the thing was determined above, she
would not be the only obstruction. For if I thought
fit, and resolved to go—(here she found me very
intent upon her words, so that it a little disordered
her, and she stopped). I asked her why she did not
go on, and say what she was going to say. But I
perceived that her heart was too full, and some tears
stood in her eyes. "Speak out, my dear," said 1,
"are you willing I should go?"—liNo," says she,
very affectionately, "I am far from willing. " But if
you are resolved to go," says she, " and, rather than
1 will be the only hindrance, I will go with you: for
though I think it a preposterous thing for one of
your years, and in your condition, yet if it must be,"
said she again, weeping, " I won't leave you: for if it
be of heaven, you must do it, there is no resisting it,
and if heaven makes it your duty to go, it will be
also mine to go with you, or otherwise dispose of me,
that I may not obstruct it."
The affectionate behaviour of my wife brought me
a little out of the vapours, and I began to consider
what I was doing. I corrected my wandering fancy,
and began to argue with myself sedately what busi-
ness I had, after threescore years, and after such a
life of tedious sufferings and disasters, and closed in
so happy and easy a manner; I say, what business
had I to rush into any hazards, and put myself upon
adventures, fit only for youth and poverty to run
into?
With these thoughts, I bought a little farm in the
county of Bedford, and removed thither. I had a
little convenient house upon it, and the land about it
I found was capable of improvement. I farmed my
own land ; I had no rent to pay, and what I im-
proved was for my own family. Now I thought,
indeed, that I enjoyed that middle state of life, which
my father so earnestly recommended to me; a coun-
try life :—
Free from vice, free from care;
Age ha» no pain, and youth no snare.
But in the middle of all this felicity, one blow
from unseen providence unhinged me at once, and not
only made a breach upon me inevitable and incura-
ble," but drove me by its consequence, into a deep
relapse of the wandering disposition, which, as I may
say, being born in my very blood, soon recovered its
hold of me, and, like the returns of a violent distem-
per, came with more impression upon me. This
blow was the loss of my wife.
It is not my business here to write an elegy upon
my wife, to give a character of her particular virtues,
and make a funeral sermon. She was in a few
words, the stay of all my affairs, the centre of all my
enterprises; the engine, that by her prudence re-
duced me to that happy compass I was in, from the
most extravagant and ruinous project, that fluttered
in my head: and did more to guide my rambling
genius, than a mother's tears, a father's instructions,
a friend's counsel, and all my own reasoning powers
could do. I was happy in listening to her entreaties,
and being moved by her tears, and to the last degree
desolate by her loss. I was like a ship without a
pilot, that could only run " afore the wind." My head
was quite turned with the whimsies of foreign adven-
tures, and all the pleasing amusement of my farm,
and my family, which before entirely possessed me,
were nothing to me; in a word, I resolved to leave
off housekeeping, let my farm, and return to London;
and in a few months after I did so.
It was now the beginning of the year 1093, when
my nephew, whom I had brought up to sea, and had
made him commander of a ship, was come home
from a short voyage to Bilboa, being the first he had
made. He came and told me, that some merchants
of his acquaintance had been proposing to him to go
a voyage for them to the East Indies and China, as
private traders. "And now uncle," says he, " if you
will go to sea with me, I'll engage to land you upon
your old habitation in the island, for we are to touch
at the Brazils." In a word the scheme hit so ex-
actly with my temper, that I told him, that if he
agreed with the merchants, I would go with him.
But I would not promise to go any further than my
own island. "Why, sir," says he, " you don't want
to be left there again I hope ?"—" Why," said I, "can
you not take me up again in your return?" He told
me, that it would not be possible to do so; that the
merchants would never allow him to come that way
with a loaded ship of such value, it being a month s
sail out of his way, and might be three or four.
"Besides, sir, if I should miscarry," said he, "and
not return at all, then you would be just reduced to
the condition you were in before."
This was very rational; 'but we both found out
a remedy for it, which was to carry a framed sloop
on board the ship, which being taken in pieces, and
shipped on board the ship, might, by the help of some
carpenters, be set up again in the island, and finished
fit to go to sea in a few days.
In order to this, I made my will, and settled the
estate I had in such a manner for my children, and
placed it in such hands, that I was perfectly easy,
and satisfied they would have justice done them,
whatever might befall me; and as for their educa-
tion, 1 left 11 wholly to my old friend the widow,
with a sufficient maintenance to herself for her care.
My nephew was ready to sail about the beginning
of January, 1694, and 1, with my man Friday, went
on board, in the Downs, the 8th, having a very con-
siderable cargo of all kinds of necessary things for
my colony, which, if Idid not find in good condition,
I resolved to leave so. First, I carried with me
some servants, whom I purposed to place there as
inhabitants, or at least, to set on work there upon
my own account while I stayed; and either to leave
them there, or carry them forward, as they should
appear willing: particularly, I carried two carpen-
ters, a smith, and a very handy, ingenious fellow,
who was a cooper by trade, but was also a general
mechanic; for he was dextrous at making wheels
and hand-mills to grind corn; was a good turner,
and a good pot-maker. With these I carried a tailor,
who had offered himself to go passenger to the East
Indies with my nephew, but afterwards consented to
stay on our new plantation, and proved a most ne-
cessary, handy fellow, as could be desired, in many
other businesses besides that of his trade.
My cargo consisted of a sufficient quantity of
linen, and some thin English stuffs for clothing the
Spaniards that I expected to find there: and enough
of them as by my calculation might comfortably
supply them for seven years. If I remember right,
the materials which I carried for clothing them, with
gloves, hats, shoes, stockings, and all such things as
they could want for wearing, amounted to above two
hundred pounds, including some beds, bedding, and
household stuff; particularly kitchen utensils, with
pots, kettles, pewter, brass, &c. besides near one
hundred pounds more in iron work, nails, tools of
every kind, staples, hooks, hinges, and every neces-
sary thing I could think of.
1 carried also a hundred spare arms, muskets, and
fnsils, besides some pistols, a considerable quantity
of shot of all sizes, three or four tons of lead, and
two pieces of brass cannon; I also carried a hundred
barrels of powder, besides swords and cutlasses, and
the iron part of some spikes and halberts; so that,
in short, we had a large magazine of all sorts of
stores; and I made my nephew carry two small
quarter-deck guns more than he wanted for. his ship,
to leave behind, if there was occasion, that, when we
came there, we might build a fort, and man it against
all sorts of enemies. And, indeed, I at first thought
there would be need enough for it all, and much
more, if we hoped to maintain our possession of the
island, as shall be plainly seen in the course of this
history.
We set out, and had a very fair gale of wind for
some time. As I remember, it might be about the
20th of February, late in the evening, when the mate
having the watch, came into the round-house, and
told us he saw a flash of fire, and heard a gun fire;
and while he was telling us of it, a boy came in and
told us the boatswain heard another. This made us
all run out upon the quarter-deck, where, for a while,
we heard nothing; but in a few minutes we saw a
very great light, and found there was some very
terrible fire at a distance. Immediately we had
recourse to our reckonings, in which we all agreed
that there could be no land in that way in which
the fire showed itself, no, not for five hundred leagues,
for it appeared at W.N.W. Upon this, we concluded
it must be some ship on fire at sea; and as, by our
hearing the noise of guns just before, we concluded
it could not be far off, we stood directly towards it,
and were presently satisfied we should discover it,
because the farther we sailed the greater the light
appeared, though, the weather being hazy, we could
not perceive any thing but the light for a while. In
about half an hour's sailing, wind being fair for
us, though not much of it, and the weather clearing
up a little, we could plainly discern that it was a
great ship on fire in the middle of the sea. I was
most sensibly touched with this disaster, though not
at all acquainted with the persons engaged in it. I
presently recollected my former circumstances, and
what condition I was in, when taken up by the Por-
tuguese captain ; and how much more deplorable the
circumstances of the poor creatures belonging to this
ship must be, if they had no other ship in company
with them. Upon this, I immediately ordered that
five guns should be fired, one soon after another,
that, if possible, we might give notice to them that
there was help for them at hand, and that they
might endeavour to save themselves in their boat:
for though we could see the flame of the ship, yet
they, it being night, and very dark, could see nothing
of us.
We lay by some time upon this, only driving as
the burning ship drove, waiting for daylight, when
on a sudden, to our great terror, though we expected
it, the ship blew up in the air, and in a few minutes
all the fire was out, that is to say, the rest of the
ship sunk. This was a terrible and afflicting sight,
for the sake of the poor men, who, I concluded, must
be either all destroyed in the ship, or be in the ut-
most distress in their boats, in the middle of the ocean,
which at present, by reason it was dark, I could not
see. However, to direct them as well as I could, I
caused lights to be hung out in all parts of the ship
where we could, and which we had lanterns for,
and kept firing guns all the night long, letting them
know by this that there was a ship not far off.
About eight o'clock in the morning we discovered
the ship's boats, by the help of our perspective glasses;
and found there were two of them, both thronged
with people, and deep in the water. We perceived
they rowed, the wind being against them; that they
saw our ship, and did their utmost to make us see
them. We immediately spread our ancient, to let
them know we saw them, and hung a waft out as a
signal for them to come on board, and then made
more sail, standing directly to them. In little more
than half an hour we came up with them, and took
them all in, being sixty-four, men, women, and chil-
dren, for there were a'great many passengers.
We found it was a French merchant ship, of three
hundred tons, homeward bound from Quebec. The
master gave us a long account of the distress of his
ship, how the fire began in the steerage by the neg-
ligence of the steersman, but, on his crying out for
help, was, as every body thought, entirely put out.
But they soon found that some sparks ofthe first
fire had gotten into some part of the ship so difficult
to come at, that they could not effectually quench
it; and afterwards getting in between the timbers,
and within the ceiling of the ship, it proceeded into
the hold, and mastered all the skill, and all the ap-
plication, they were able to exert. They had no more
to do then but to get into their boats, which, to their
great comfort, were pretty large, being their long
boat, and a great shallop, besides a small skiff, which
was of no great service to them, other than to get
some fresh water and provisions into her, after they
had secured themselves from the fire. They had in-
deed small hope of their lives by getting into these
boats at that distance from any land, only, as they
said well, that they were escaped from the fire, and
had a possibility that some ship might happen to be
at sea, and might take them in.
It is impossible for me to express the several ges-
tures, the strange ecstacies, the variety of posture,
which these poor delivered people run into, to express
the joy of their souls at so unexpected a deliverance.
Grief and fear are easily described; sighs, tears,
groans, and a very few motions of the head and hands,
make up the sum of its variety; but an excess of joy
and surprise, has a thousand extravagancies in it.
There were some in tears, some raging and tearing
themselves, as if they had been in the greatest agonies
of sorrow; some stark raving, and downright lunatic;
some ran about the ship stamping with their feet,
others wringing their hands; some were dancing,
some singing; some laughing, more crying; many
quite dumb, not able to speak a word; others sick
and vomiting; several swooning, and ready to faint;
and a few were crossing themselves, and giving God
thanks.
I would not wrong them neither; there might be
many that were thankful afterwards: but the pas-
sion was too strong for them at first, and they were
not able to master it; they were thrown into ecstacies,
and a kind of frenzy, and so there were very few
who were composed and serious in their joy.
T
There were two priests among them, one an old man,
and the other a young man ; and that which was
strangest was, that the oldest man was the worst.
As soon as he set his foot on board our ship, and
saw himself safe, he droped down stone dead to all
appearance; not the least sign of life could be seen
in him. Our surgeon immediately applied remedies
to recover him, and was the only man in the ship
that believed he was not dead; and at length he
opened a vein in his arm, from which in a short time
the blood flowed rather freely; in three minutes
after, the old man opened his eyes; and about a
quarter of an hour after that he spoke, grew better,
and in a little time quite well. After the blood was
stopped, he walked about, told us he was perfectly
well, took a dram of cordial which the surgeon gave
him, and was what we called "come to himself."
About a quarter of an hour after, they came running
into the cabin to the surgeon, who was bleeding a
French woman that had fainted, and told him the
priest had gone stark mad. It seems he had begun
to revolve the change of his circumstances in his
mind, and this put him into an ecstasy of joy ; his
spirits whirled about faster than the vessels could
convey them; the blood grew hot and feverish, and
the man was as fit for Bedlam as any creature that
ever was in it. The surgeon gave him something to
dose and put him to sleep, which, after some time,
operated upon him, and he waked next morning
perfectly composed and well.
The younger priest behaved himself with great
command of his passion, and was really an example
of a serious, well-governed mind. At his first coming on board the ship, he threw himself flat on his face,
prostrating himself in thankfulness for his deliver-
ance, in which I unhappily and unseasonably disturb-
ed him, really thinking he had been in a swoon; but
he spake calmly, thanked me, told me he was giving
God thanks for his deliverance, begged me to leave
him a few moments, and that, next to his Maker, he
would give me thanks also.
I was heartily sorry that I disturbed him; and not
only left him, but kept others from interrupting him
also. He continued in that posture about three
minutes, or a little more, after I left him; then came
to me, as he had said he would, and with a great
deal of seriousness and affection, but with tears in
his eyes, thanked me that had, under God, given
him, and so many miserable creatures, their lives.
I told him I had no room to move him to thank God
for it, rather than me, for I had seen that he had
done that already. But I added, that it was nothing:
but what reason and humanity dictated to all men,
and that we had as much reason as he to give thanks
to God, who had blessed us so far as to make us the
instruments of his mercy to so many of his creatures.
After this, the young" priest applied himself to his
country folks, laboured to compose them, persuaded,
entreated, argued, reasoned with them, and did his
utmost to keep them within the exercise of their
reason; and with some he had success, though others
were, for a time, out of all government of themselves.
I commit this to writing, as perhaps it may be
useful to those into whose hands it may fall, for the
guiding themselves in all the extravagancies of their
passions; for if an excess of joy can carry men out
to such a length beyond the reach of their reason,
what will not the extravagancies of anger, rage, and
a provoked mind carry us to?
The next day, when they had slept soundly, they
were quite another sort of people. Nothing of good
manners, or civil acknowledgments, for the kindness
shown to them, was wanting1: the French, it is well
known, are naturally apt to exceed that way. The
captain and one of the priests came to me shortly,
and, desiring to speak with me and my nephew,
the commander, began to consult with us what should
be done with them. And first they told BS that as
T 2
we had saved their lives, so all they had was little
enough for a return for the kindness received. The
captain said they had saved some money, and some
things of value, in their boats, catched hastily out of
the flames, and if we would accept it, they were
ordered to make an offer of it all to us; they only
desired to be set on shore somewhere on our way,
where, if possible, they might get passage to France.
I told the French captain that we had taken them
up in their distress, it was true; but that it was our
duty to do so, as we were fellow-creatures, and as we
would desire to be so delivered, if we were in the like,
or any other extremity; that we had done nothing
for them but what we believed they would have done
for us if we had been in their case, and they in ours;
but that we took them up to save them, not to plun-
der them; and that it would be a most barbarous
thing to take that little from them which they had
saved out of the fire, and then to set them on shore
and leave them; that this would be first to save
them from death, and then to kill them ourselves;
save them from drowning, and abandon them to
starving; and, therefore, I would not let the least
thing be taken from them. As to setting them on
shore, I told them, indeed, that was an exceeding
difficulty to us, for that the ship was bound to the
East Indies; and though we were driven oat of our
course to the westward a very great way, which,
perhaps, was directed by heaven on purpose for their
deliverance, yet it was impossible for us wilfully to
change our voyage, on this particular account; nor
could my nephew, the captain, answer it to the
freighters with whom he was under charterparty to
pursue his voyage by the way of Brazil: and all I
knew we could do for them was to put ourselves in
the way of meeting with other ships, homeward
bound from the West Indies, and get them passage,
if possible, to England or France. The first part of the proposal was so generous and
kind, they could not but be very thankful for it; but
they were in a great consternation, especially the pas-
sengers, at the notion of being carried away to the
East Indies. They then entreated me, that seeing I was driven so far to the westward before I met with
them, I would at least keep on the same course to
the banks of Newfoundland, where it was possible they
might meet with some ship or sloop, that they might
hire to carry them back to Canada, from whence
they came.
I thought this was but a reasonable request on
their part, and therefore consented, and in about a
week after we made the banks of Newfoundland,
where, to shorten my story, we put all our French
people on board a bark, which they hired to carry
them to France. When, I say all the French people,
I should remember that the young priest I spoke of.
hearing we were bound to the East Indies, desired
to go the voyage with us, and to be set on shore on
the coast of Coromandel. I readily agreed to that;
for 1 wonderfully liked the man, and had very good
reason, as will appear afterwards. Also, four of the
seamen entered themselves in our ship, and proved
very useful fellows.
From thence we directed our course for the West
Indies, steering away S. S. E. for about twenty days
together, sometimes little or no wind at all, when we
met with another subject for our humanity, almost
as deplorable as that before.
It was in the latitude of 27 degrees 5 minutes N.,
and the Iflth day of March, 1694, when we spied a
sail, our course was 8. E. S.. We soon perceived it
was a large vessel, and that she bore up to us, but
at first we could not tell what to make of her, till
coming a little nearer, we found she had lost her
main-topmast, foremast, and bolt-sprit, and presently
she fired a gun as a signal of distress. The weather
was pretty good, wind at N. N. W. a fresh gale, and
we soon came to speak with her.
We found her a ship of Bristol, bound home from
Barbadoes, but had been blown out of the road a few
days before she was ready to sail, by a terrible hur-
ricaue, while the captain and the chief mate were
both gone on shore, so that, by the terror of the
storm, they were but in an indifferent case for good
artists to bring the ship home. They had been
already nine weeks at sea, and had met with another
terrible storm, after the hurricane was over, which
had blown them quite out of their knowledge to the
westward, and in which they lost their masts as
above. They told us they expected to have seen the
Bahama Islands, but then were driven away again
to the south east by a strong gale of wind at N. N. W.
the same that blew now; and having no sails to work
the ship with, but a main-course, and a kind of
square sail, upon a jury fore-mast, which they had
set up, they could not lie near the wind, but were
endeavouring to stand away for the Canaries.
But what was the worst of all, they were almost
starved for want of provisions, besides the fatigues
they had undergone: their bread and flesh was quite
gone, they had not an ounce left in the ship, and had
had none for eleven days; the only relief they had
was, their water was not done, and they had about
half a barrel of flour left; they had sugar enough;
some succades, or sweetmeats, they had at first, but
they were devoured, and they had seven casks of rum.
There was a youth and his mother, and a maid-
servant, on board, who were going passengers, and,
thinking the ship was ready to sail, unhappily came
on board the evening before the hurricane began;
and having no provisions of their own, they were in
a more deplorable condition than the rest; for the
seamen, being reduced to such an extreme necessity
themselves, had no compassion, we may be sure, for
the poor passengers.
I had, perhaps not known this part, if my curiosity
had not led me, the weather being fair, and the wind
abated, to go on board the ship. The second mate,
who, upon this occasion, commanded the ship, had been on board our ship; and he told me, that they
had three passengers on board, and that they were
in a deplorable condition. "Nay," says he, "I be-
lieve they are dead, for I have heard nothing of them
for above two days ; and I was afraid to inquire
after them," said he, " for I had nothing to relieve
them with."
We immediately applied ourselves to give them
what relief we could spare. But now they were in a
new danger, for they were afraid of eating too much,
even of that little we gave them. The mate, or com-
mander, brought six men with him in his boat, but
these poor wretches looked like skeletons, and were
so weak that they could hardly sit to their oars.
The mate himself was very ill, and half starved, for
he declared he had reserved nothing from the men,
and went share and share alike with them in every
bit they eat.
I cautioned him to eat sparingly, and set meat
before him immediately, but he had: not eaten three
mouthsful before he began to be sick and put of order.
So he stopped awhile, and our surgeon mixed him up
something with some broth, which he said would be
to him both food and physic, and after he had taken
it he grew better. In the mean time, I forgot not the
men: I ordered victuals to be given them, and the
poor creatures rather devoured than eat it: and two
of them eat with so much greediness, that they were
in danger of their lives the next morning. All the
while the mate was relating to me the miserable con-
dition of the ship's company, I could not put out of
my thoughts the story he had told me of the three
poor creatures in the great cabin, viz. the mother.
her son, and the maid-servant, whom he had heard
nothing of for two or three days, and whom he seem-
ed to' confess they had wholly neglected, their own
extremities being so great; by which I understood,
that they had really given them no food at all, and
that therefore they must have perished, and be all
lying dead on the floor, or deck of the cabin.
As 1, therefore, kept the mate, whom we then
failed captain, on board with his men to refresh
them, so I also forgot not the starving crew that
were on board, but ordered my own boat to go on
board their ship, with my mate and twelve men, to
carry them a sack of bread, and four or five pieces of
beef to boil. Our surgeon charged the men to cause
the meat to be boiled while they stayed, and to keep
guard in the cook-room, to prevent the men's taking
it to eat raw, or taking it out of the pot before it
was well boiled, and then to give every man but a
little at a time; and, by this caution he preserved
the men, who would otherwise hayekilled themselves
with that very food which was given them on pur-
pose to save their lives.
At the same time, I ordered the mate to go into
the great cabin, and see what condition the poor pas-
sengers were in, and, if they were alive to comfort
them, and give them what refreshment was proper,
and the surgeon gave him a large pitcher, with some
of the prepared broth which ne had given to the
mate that was on board, and which he did not ques-
tion would restore them gradually.
I was not satisfied with this; but, as I said before,
having a great mind to see the scene of misery, which
I knew the ship itself would present me with, in a
more lively manner than I could have it by report, I
took the captain of the ship as we now called him,
with me, and went myself a little after in their boat.
I found the poor men almost in a tumult to get the
victuals out of the boiler before it was ready. How-
ever, we pacified them, and fed them gradually and
cautiously for the first time, and the next time we
gave them more, and at last filled their bellies, and
the men did well enough. But the misery of the
poor passengers in the cabin was of another nature,
and far beyond the rest. For as, first, the ship's
company had so little for themselves, it was but too
true, that they had at first kept them low, and at
last totally neglected them; so that for six or seven
days, it might be said, they had really had no food
at all, and, for several days before, very little. The
poor mother, who, as the mate reported, was a woman
of good sense, and good breeding, had spared all she
could get so affectionately for her son, that at last
she sunk under it. And when the mate of our ship
went in, she sat upon the floor, or deck, with her
back up against the sides, between two chairs, which
were lashed fast, and her head sunk in between her
shoulders, like a corpse, though not quite dead. My
mate said all he could to revive and encourage her,
and with a spoon put some broth into her mouth.
She opened her lips, and lifted up one hand, but
could not speak: yet she understood what he said,
and made signs to him, intimating that it was too
late for her, but pointed to her child, as if she would
have said, they should take care of him.
However, the mate, who was exceedingly moved
with the sight, endeavoured to get some of the broth
into her mouth; and, as he said, got two or three
spoonsful down, though I question whether he could
be sure of it or not. But it was too late, she died the
same night
The youth, who was preserved at the price of his
most affectionate mother's life, was not so far gone;
yet he lay in a cabin bed, as one stretched out, with
hardly any life left in him. He had a piece of an old
glove in his mouth, having eaten up the rest. How-
ever, being young, and having more strength than
his mother, the mate got something down his throat,
and he began sensibly to revive, though by giving
him, some time after, but two or three spoonsful ex-
traordinary, he was very sick, and brought it up
again.
But the next care was the poor maid. She lay all
along upon the deck, hard by her mistress, and (just like one that had fallen down with an apoplexy, and
struggled for life. Her limbs were distorted, one of
her hands was clasped round f.he frame of a chair,
and she griped it so hard, that we could not easily
make her let it go, her other arm lay over her head,
and her feet lay both together, set fast against the
frame of the cabin table; in short, she lay just like
one in the last agonies of death. The poor creature
was not only starved with hunger, and terrified with
the thoughts of death, but, as the men told us after-
wards, was broken-hearted for her mistress, whom
she saw dying for two or three days before, and whom
she loved most tenderly. We knew not what to do
with this poor girl; for when our surgeon, who was
a man of very great knowledge and experience, had,
with great application, recovered her, as to life, he
had her upon his hands, as to her senses, for she was
nearly distracted for a considerable time after.
Whoever shall read these memorandums, must
consider that visits at sea are not like journies into
the country, where sometimes people stay a week or
a fortnight at a place. Our business was to relieve
this distressed ship's crew, but not lie by for them;
and though they were willing to steer the same course
with us for some days, yet we could carry no sail to
keep pace with a ship that had no masts. However,
as their captain begged of us to help him to set up a
main-topmast, and a kind of topmast to his jury fore-
mast, we did, as it were, lie by him for three or four
days, and then, having given them five barrels of
beef, and a barrel of pork, two hogsheads of biscuits,
and a proportion of peas, flour, and what other things
we could spare, and taking three casks of sugar,
some rum, and some pieces of eight of them for satis-
faction, we left them, taking on board with us, at
their own earnest request, the youth, and the maid,
and all their goods. The young lad was about seven-r
teen years of age, a pretty, well-bred, modest, and
sensible youth, greatly dejected with the loss of his
mother; and, as it seems, had lost his father but a
few months before at Barbadoes.
I was now in the latitude of 19 degrees, 32 minutes,
and had hitherto had a tolerable voyage as to weather,
though at first the winds had been contrary. I shall
trouble nobody with the little incidents of wind,
weather, currents, &c, on the rest of our voyage, but,
shortening my story, for the sake of what is to follow,
shall observe, that I came to my old habitation, in
the island, on the 10th of April, 1694. It was with
no small difficulty that I found the place, for as I
came to it, and went from it before, on the south and
east side of the island, as coming from the Brazils,
so now coming in between the mainland and the
island, and having no chart for the coast, nor any
land-mark, I did not know it when I saw it, or know
whether I saw it or not.
We beat about a great while, and went on shore on
several islands, in the mouth of the great river
Oroonoque; and this I learned, by coasting the
shore, that I was under one great mistake before,
viz. that the continent, which I thought I saw from
the island I lived in, was really no continent, but a
long island, or rather a ridge of islands, reaching
from one to the other side of the extended mouth of
that great river, and that the savages who came to
my island were not properly those which we call
Caribbees, but islanders, and other barbarians of the
same kind, who inhabited something nearer to our
side than the rest. I visited several of these islands
to no purpose. At length I came fair on the south
side of my island, and I presently knew the very
countenance of the place. So I brought the ship
safe to an anchor, broadside with the little creek,
where my old habitation was.
As soon as I saw the place, I called for Friday,
and asked him if he knew where he was. He looked
about a little, and presently, clapping his hands,
cried, " O yes! O there! O yes! O there!" pointing
to our old habitation, and fell a dancing and capering
like a mad fellow, and I had much ado to keep him
from j jumping into the sea, to swim ashore to the place.
"Well, Friday," said I, "do you think we shall find
any body here or no? And what do you think, shall
we see your father?" The fellow stood mute as a
stock a good while; but when I named his father, the
poor affectionate creature looked dejected, and I could see the tears run down his face very plentifully.
"What is the matter, Friday?" said I, "are you
troubled because you may see your father ?"—" No,
no," says he, "no see him more, no, ever more see
again!"—" Why so," said I, "Friday, how do you
know that?"—"O no, no," says Friday, "he long
ago die, long ago, he much old man."—" Well, well,
said I, " Friday, you don't know. But shall we see
any one else then'?" The fellow, it seems, had better
eyes than I, and he points just to the hill above my
old house, and though we lay half a league off, he
cries out, " Me see! me see! yes, yes! me see much
men there, and there!" I looked, but I could see
nobody, no, not with a perspective glass, which was,
I suppose, because I could not hit the place, for the
fellow was right, as I found, upon enquiry, the next
day, and there were five or six men altogether stood
to look at the ship, not knowing what to think of us,
As soon as Friday had told me he saw people, I
caused the English ancient to be spread, and fired
three guns, to give them notice we were friends, and
about a quarter of an hour after we perceived a
smoke rise from the side of the creek. So I imme-
diately ordered a boat out, taking Friday with me,
and hanging out a white flag, or flag of truce, I went
directly on shore, taking with me the young friar I
mentioned before, to wnom I had told the whole
story of my living there, and the manner of it, and
every particular, both of myself, and those that I left
there, and who was, on that account, extremely de-
4-
sirous to go with me. We had, besides, about sixteen
men, very well armed, if we had found any new
guests there which we did not know of: but we had
no need of weapons.
As we went on shore upon the tide of flood, near
high water, we rowed directly into the creek, and
the first man I fixed my eye upon was the Spaniard,
whose life I had saved, and whom I 'knew by his
face perfectly well. I ordered nobody to go on
shore but myself, but there was no keeping Friday
in the boat, for the affectionate creature had spied
his father at a distance, and if they had not let him
go on shore, he would have jumped into the sea. He
was no sooner on shore, but he flew away to his
father, like an arrow out of a bow. i t would have
made any man shed tears, in spite of the firmest
resolution, to have seen the first transports of this poor fellow's joy when he came to his father; how
he embraced him, kissed him, stroked his face, took
him up in his arms, set him down upon a tree, and
lay down by him; then stood and looked at him, as
any one would look at a strange picture, for a quarter
of an hour together; then lay down upon the ground,
and stroked his legs, and kissed them, and then got
up again, and stared at him; one would have thought
the fellow bewitched; apd all the while he did this,
he would be talking to him, and telling him one
story or another of his travels, and of what had hap-
pened to him abroad, to divert him. In short, if the
same filial affection was to be found in Christians to
their parents in our parts of the world, one would be
tempted to say, there would hardly have been any
need of the Fifth Commandment.
But this is a digression: I return to my landing.
It would be endless to take notice of all the ceremo-
nies and civilities that the Spaniards received me
with. The first Spaniard, whom, as I said, I knew
very well, was he whose life I had saved; he came
towards the boat, attended by one more, carrying a
flag of trace also; and he not only did not know me
at first, but he had no thoughts, no notion, of its
being me that was come, till I said, "Seignior, do
you not know me?" At which he spoke not a word,
but giving his musket to the man that was with him,
threw his arms abroad, and, saying something in
Spanish that I did not perfectly hear, came forward
and embraced me, telling me he was inexcusable not
to know that face again, that he had once seen, as of
an angel from heaven sent to save his life. He said
abundance of very handsome things, as a well-bred
Spaniard always knows how; and then beckoning
to the person who attended him, bade him go and
call out his comrades. He then asked me, if I would
walk to my old habitation, where he would give me
possession of my own house again, and where I should
see there had been but mean improvements. So I
walked along with him; but, alas! I could no more
find the place again, than if I had never been there,
for they find planted so many trees, and placed them
in such a posture, so thick and close to one another,
and in ten years' time they were grown so big, that,
in short, the place was inaccessible, except by such
windings, and blind ways, as they themselves only
who made them could find.
I asked what put them upon all these fortifications.
He told me, I would say there was need enough of
it, when they had given me an account how they had
passed their time since their arriving in the island,
especially after they had the misfortune to find I was
gone. He told me, he could not but have some satis-
faction in my good fortune, when he heard that I was gone in a good ship; and that he had oftentimes
a strong persuasion, that one time or other he should
see me again.
While he was saying this, came the man whom he
had sent back, and with him eleven men more. In
the dress they were in, it was impossible to guess
what nation they were of; but he made all clear,
noiilNSON CKUSOE 303
both to them and to me. First, he turned to me,
and pointing to them, said, "These, sir, are some of
the gentlemen who owe their lives to you;" and then
turning to them, and pointing to me, he let them
know who I was. Upon which, they all came up,
one by one, not as if they had been sailors, and
ordinary fellows, and I the like, but really as if they
had been ambassadors or noblemen, and I a monarch,
or a great conqueror.
The history of their coming to, and conduct in, the
island, after my going away, is so remarkable, and
has so many incidents which the former part of my
relation will help to understand, and which will, in
most of the particulars, refer to that account I have
already given, that I cannot but commit them to the
reading of those that come after me.
The first thing I did, was to desire that he would
give me a particular account of his voyage back to
his countrymen with the boat, when I sent him to
fetch them over. He told me there was little variety
in that part, for nothing remarkable happened to
them on the way, they having very calm weather,
and a smooth sea. For his countrymen, it would not
be doubted, he said, but that they were overjoyed to
see him. (Itseems, he was the principal man among
them, the captain of the vessel they had been ship-
wrecked in having been dead some time.) They
were, he said, the more surprised to see him, because
they knew that he was fallen into the hands of
savages, who, they were satisfied, would devour him,
as they did all the rest of their prisoners; that when
he told them the story of his deliverance, and in what
manner he was furnished for carrying them away, it
was, like a dream to them; and their astonishment,
they said, was something like that of Joseph's
brethren, when he told them who he was, and told
them the story of his exaltation in Pharaoh's court.
But when he showed them the arms, the powder, the
ball, and the provisions, that he brought them for
304 ROBINSON CRUSOE. their journey, or voyage, they were restored to them-
selves, took a just sharein the joy of their deliverance,
and immediately prepared to come away with him.
Their first business was to get canoes: and in this
they were obliged not to stick so much upon the
honest part of it, but to trespass upon their friendly
savages, and to borrow two large canoes, on pretence
of going out a fishing, or for pleasure.
In these they came away the next morning. It
seems they wanted no time to get themselves ready;
for they had no baggage, neither clothes, nor provi-
sions, nor anything in the world, but what they had on
them, and a few roots to eat, of which they used to
make their bread.
They were in all three weeks absent, and in that
time, unluckily for them, I had the occasion offered
for my escape, as I mentioned in my other part, and
and to get offfrom the island, leaving three of the
most impudent, hardened, ungoverned, disagreeable
villains behind me, that any man conld desire to
meet with.
The only just thing the rogues did, was, that when
the Spaniards came on shore they gave my letter to
them, and gave them provisions, and other relief, as
I had ordered them to do. Also they gave them the
long paper of directions, which I had left them, con-
taining the particular methods which I took for
managing every part of my life there, the way I
baked my bread, bred up my tame goats, and planted
my corn, how I cured my grapes, made my pots,
and, in a word, every thing I did. Nor did they
refuse to accommodate the Spaniards with any thing
else, for they agreed very well for some time; they
gave them an equal admission into the house, or cave,
and they began to live very sociably; and the head
Spaniard, who had seen pretty much of my methods,
and Friday's father together, managed all their
affairs; for, as for the Englishmen, they did nothing
but ramble about the island, shoot parrots, and catch
tortoises, and when they came home at night, the
Spaniards provided their suppers for them.
The Spaniards would have been satisfied with this,
would the others have but let them alone, which,
however, they could not find in their hearts to do
long, but, like the dog in the manger, they would
not eat themselves, and would not let others eat
neither. At last it broke out into open war, and it
began with all the rudeness and insolence that can
be imagined, without reason, without provocation,
contrary to nature, and, indeed, to common sense;
and though, it is true, the first relation of it came
from the Spaniards themselves, whom I may call the
accusers, yet when I came to examine the fellows,
they could not deny a word of it.
But before I come to the particulars of this part, I
must supply a defect in my former relation^ and this
was, that I forgot to set down among the rest, that,
just as we were weighing the anchor to set sail,
there happened a little quarrel on board our ship,
which I was afraid once would turn to a second
mutiny; nor was it appeased, till the captain, rousing
up his courage, and taking us all to his assistance,
parted them by force, and making two of the most
refractory fellows prisoners, he laid them in irons;
and as they had been active in the former disorders,
and let fall some ugly, dangerous words the second
time, he threatened to carry them in irons to England,
and have them hanged there for mutiny, and running
away with the ship. This, it seems, frightened some
other men in the ship; and some of them had put it
into the heads of the rest, that the captain only gave
them good words for the present, till they should
come to some English port, and that then they should
all be put into a gaol, and tried for their lives.
The mate got intelligence of this, and acquainted
us with it; upon which it was desired that I, who
still passed for a great man among them, should go
down with the mate and satisfy the men, and tell
u
them that they might be assured, if they behaved
well the rest of the voyage, all they had done for the
time past should be pardoned. So I went, and, after
passing " my honour's" word to them, they appeared
easy, and the more so when I caused the two men,
who were in irons, to be released and forgiven.
But this mutiny had brought us to an anchor for
that night, the .wind falling calm. Next morning we
found that our two men, who had been laid in irons,
had stole each of them a musket and some other
weapons; what powder or shot they had we knew
not; and had taken the ship's pinnace, which was
not yet hauled up, and run away with her to their
companions in roguery on shore.
As soon as we found this, I ordered the long boat
on shore, with twelve men and the mate, and away
they went to seek the rogues; but they could
neither find them nor any of the rest, for they all
fled into the woods when they saw the boat coming.
These two men made their number five; but the
other three villians were so much wickeder than
these, that, after they had been two or three days
together, they turned their new-comers out of doors
to shift for themselves, and would have nothing to
do with them, nor could they, for a good while, be
persuaded to give them any food; as for the Spani-
ards, they were not yet come.
When the Spaniards came first on shore, the
business began to go forward: the Spaniards would
have persuaded the three English brutes to have
taken in their two countrymen again, that, as they
said, they might be all one family, but they would
not hear of it. So the two poor fellows lived by
themselves, and, finding nothing but industry and
application would make them live comfortably, they
pitched their tents on the north shore of the island,
put a little more to the west, to be out of the danger
of the savages, who always landed on the east part
of the island.
Here they built them two huts, one to lodge in,
and the other to lay up their magazines and stores
in; and the Spaniards having given them some corn
for seed, and especially some of the peas, which I had
left them, they dug, and planted, and enclosed, after
the pattern I had set for them all, and began to live
pretty well.
They were going on in this little thriving posture,
when the three unnatural rogues, their own country-
men too, in mere humour, and to insult them, came
and bullied them, and told them the island was
theirs; that the governor, meaning me, had given
them possession of it, and nobody else had any right
to it: and, d—n them, they should build no houses
upon their ground, unless they would pay them rent
for them.
The two men thought they had jested at first, and asked them to come and sit down, and see what fine
houses they were that they had built, and tell them
what rent they demanded. And one of them merrily
told them, if they were ground landlords, he hoped,
if they built tenements upon the land, and made im-
provements, they would according to the custom of all
landlords, grant them a long lease, and bade them
go and fetch a scrivener to draw the writings. One
of the three, d—ning and raging, told them that they
should see they were not in jest; and going to a little
place at a distance, where the honest men had made
a fire to dress their victuals, he takes a firebrand,
and claps it to the outside of their hut, and fairly set
it on fire; and it would have been burnt down in a
few minutes, if one of the two had not run to the
fellow, thrust him away, and trod the fire out with
his feet, and not without some difficulty too.
The fellow was in such a rage at the honest man
thrusting him away, that he turned upon him with a
pole he had in his hand; and had not the man avoid-
ed the blow very nimbly, and run into the hut, he
had ended his days at once. His comrade, seeing
u 2
the danger they were both in, ran in after him, and
immediately they both came out with their muskets;
and the man who was first struck at with the pole,
knocked the fellow down who began the quarrel with
the stock of his musket, and that before the other
two could come to help him; and then seeing the-
rest come at them, they stood together, and pre-
senting the other ends of their pieces to them, bade them stand off.
The others had fire-arms with them too: but one
of the two honest men, bolder than his comrade, and
made desperate by his danger, told them if they
offered to move hand or foot, they were all dead men,
and boldly commanded them to lay down their arms.
They did not indeed, lay down their arms; but seeing
him so resolute, it brought them to a parley, and
they consented to take their wounded man with them
and be gone: and, indeed it seems the fellow was
wounded sufficiently with the blow.
Unt not to crowd this part with an account of the
lesser part of their rogueries, such as treading down
their corn, shooting three young kids, and a she-goat,
which the poor men had got to breed up tame for
their store, and in a word, plaguing them night and
day in this manner, it forced the two men to such a
desperation, that they resolved to fight them all
three the first time they had a fair opportunity. In
order to do this, they resolved to go to the castle, as
they called it, that was my old dwelling, where the
three rogues and the Spaniards all lived together at
that time, intending to have a fair battle, and the
Spaniards should stand by and see fair play. So
they got up in the morning before day, and came to
the place, and called the Englishmen by their names,
telling a Spaniard that answered, that they wanted
to speak with them.
It happened that the day before two of the Spani-
ards, having been in the woods, had seen one of the
two Englishmen, whom, for distinction, I call the
honest men; and he had made a sad complaint to the
Spaniards of the barbarous usage they had met with
from their three countrymen. When the Spaniards
came home at night, and they were all at supper, he
took the freedom to reprove the three Englishmen,
though in gentle and mannerly terms, at which they
took great offence.
The next morning they went all trooping away,
swearing to burn and demolish the habitation of the
other two men, and also muttered some insolent
things among themselves of what they would do to
the Spaniards too, when opportunity offered.
When they came thither, and found the men gone,
Atkins, who, it seems, was the forwardest man,
called out to his comrades, "Ha! Jack, here's the
nest; but, d—n them, the birds are flown." They
mused awhile to think what should be the occasion
of their being gone abroad so soon, and suggested
presently that the Spaniards had given them notice
of it; and with that they shook hands, and swore to
one another that they would be revenged of the
Spaniards. As soon as they had made this bloody
bargain, they fell to work with the poor men's habi-
tation. They did not set fire indeed to any thing,
but they pulled down both their houses, and left not
the least stick standing, or scarce any sign on the
ground where they stood; they also tore in pieces,
and squandered about their little household stuff.
The two men were, at this juncture, gone to find
them out, and had resolved to fight them wherever
they had been, though they were but two to three:
sp that, had they met, there certainly would have
been bloodshed among them, for they were all very
stout, resolute fellows, to give them their due.
When the three came back, like furious creatures,
flushed with the rage which the work they had been
about had put them into, they came up to the Spani-
ards and told them what they had done, by way of
scoff and bravado; and one of them stepping up to
one of the Spaniards, as if they had been a couple of
boys at play, takes hold of his hat as it was upon his
head, and giving it a twirl about, fleering in his face,
says to him, "And you, seignior Jack Spaniard,
shall have the same sauce, if you do not mend your
manners." The Spaniard, who, though a quiet, civil
man, was as brave as a man could be desired to be,
and withal a strong, well-made man, looking steadily
at him for a good while, and then, having no weapon
in his hand, stepped gravely up to him, and, with
one blow of his fist, knocked him down; at which
one of the rogues, insolent as the first, fired his pistol
at the Spaniard immediately. He missed his body,
indeed, for the bullets went through his hair; but
one of them touched the tip of his ear, and he bled
pretty much. The blood made the Spaniard believe
he was more hurt than he really was, and that put
him into some heat, for before he acted in a perfect
calm; but now, resolving to go through with his
work, he stooped, and took the fellow's musket whom
he had knocked down, and was just going to shoot
the man who fired at him, when the rest of the
Spaniards, being in the cave, came out, and, calling
to him not to shoot, they stepped in, secured the
other two, and took their arms from them.
When they were thus disarmed, and found they
had made all the Spaniards their enemies, as well as
their own countrymen, they began to cool, and giving
the Spaniards better words, would have had their
arms again; but the Spaniards, considering the feud that was between them and the other two English-
men, and that it would be the best method they
could take to keep them from one another, told them
they would do them no harm; and if they would
live peaceably, they would be very willing to assist
and associate with them as they did before; but that
they could not think of giving them their arms again,
while they appeared so resolved to do mischief with
them to their own countrymen, and had even threat-
them all to make them their servants. The
rogues were not more capable to hear reason than to
act reason; and, being refused their arms, they went
raving away, and raging like madmen, threatening
what they would do, though they had no fire-arms.
But the Spaniards, despising their threatening, told
them they should take care how they offered any
inj ury to their plantation and cattle, for if they did,
they would shoot them, as they would do ravenous
beasts, wherever they found them; and if they fell
into their hands alive, they would certainly be
hanged. As soon as they were gone, came back the
two men, in passion and rage enough also, though of
another kind; for having been at their plantation,
and finding it all demolished and destroyed, as above,
it will easily be supposed that they had provocation
enough; they could scarce have room to tell their
tale, the Spaniards were so eager to tell them theirs;
and it was strange to find, that three men should
thus bully so many, and receive not the least punish-
ment for it.
The Spaniards, indeed, despised them, and espe-
cially, having thus disarmed them, made light of
their threatenings; but the two Englishmen resolved
to have their remedy against them, what pains soever
it cost to find them.
But the Spaniards interposed here too, and told
them, that as they were already disarmed, they could
not consent that they (the two) should pursue them
with fire-arms, and perhaps kill them. "But," said
the grave Spaniard, who was their governor, "we
will endeavour to make them do you justice, if you will leave it to us; for as there is no doubt but they
will come to us again when their passion is over,
being not able to subsist without pur assistance, we
promise yon to make no peace with them, without
having a full satisfaction for you; and, upon this
condition, we hope you will promise to use no violence
with them, other than in your own defence." The
two Englishmen yielded to this very awkwardly, and
with great reluctance.
In about five days' time, the three vagrants, tired
with wandering, and almost starved with hunger,
having chiefly lived on turtle's eggs all that while, came back to the grove; and finding my Spaniard,
who, as I have said, was the governor, and two more
with him, walking by the side of the creek: they
came up in a very submissive, humble manner, and
begged to be received again into the family. The
Spaniards used them civilly, but told them that they
could not think of relieving them unless they would
promise to replace, as well as they could, the things
they had destroyed.
Well, they submitted to this, and as they had
plenty of provisions given them all the while, they
grew very orderly, and the whole society began to
live pleasantly and agreeably together again; only
that these three fellows could never be persuaded to
work; I mean, for themselves, except now and then
a little, just as they pleased. However, the Spani-
ards told them plainly, that if they would but live
sociably and friendly together, and study, in the
whole, the good of the plantation, they would be
content to work for them, and let them walk about
and be as idle as they pleased: and thus having lived
pretty well together for a month or two, the Spani-
ards gave them their arms again, and gave them
liberty to go abroad with them as before.
It was not above a week after they had these arms
and went abroad, but the ungrateful creatures began
to be insolent and troublesome as before. But, how-
ever, an accident happening presently upon this,
which endangered the safety of them all, they were
obliged to lay by all private resentments, and look
to the preservation of their lives.
It happened one night that the Spaniard governor,
as I call him, that is to say, the Spaniard whose life
I had saved, who was now the captain, or leader, or
governor, of the rest, found himself very uneasy in
the night, and could by no means get any sleep. He
was perfectly well in body, as he told me the story,
only found his thoughts tumultnous: his mind ran
upon men fighting and killing one another, but was
broad awake, and could not by any means get any
sleep. In short, he lay a great while, but growing
more and more uneasy, he resolved to rise. Being
gotten up, he looked out; but, being dark, he could
see little or nothing: and, hearing no noise, he re-
turned, and laid him down again : but it was all one,
he could not sleep, nor could he compose himself to
any thing like rest, but his thoughts were to the last
degree uneasy, and yet he knew not for what.
Having made some noise with rising and wall ing
about, going out and coming in, another of them
waked, and calling, asked who it was that was up.
The governor told him how it had been with him.
"Say you so?" says the other Spaniard. "Such
things are not to be slighted, I assure you : there is
certainly some mischief working," says he, "near
us." And presently he asked him, "Where are the
Englishmen?" "They are all in their huts," says he,
"safe enough." It seems the Spaniards had kept
possession of the main apartment, and had made a
place where the three Englishmen, since their last
mutiny, always quartered by themselves, and could
not come at the rest. "Well," says the Spaniard,
"there is something in it, I am persuaded."
In a word, they went out to go to the top of the
hill, where I used to go; but when they were going
round their grove, unconcerned and unwary, they
were surprised with seeing a light, as of fire, a very
little way off from them, and hearing the voices of
men, not of one or two, but of a great number. We
need not doubt, but that the governor, and the man
with him, surprised with this sight, ran back imme-
diately, and raised their fellows, giving them an ac-
count of the imminent danger they were all in, and
314 ROBINSON CRUSOE. they again as readily took the alarm; but it was
impossible to persuade them to stay close within
where they were, but that they must all run out to
see how things stood.
After having mused a great while, they resolved at
last, while it was dark, to send the old savage (Fri-
day's father) out as a spy, to learn, if they were
savages, something concerning them, as what they
came for, and what they intended to do, and the like.
The old man readily undertook it, and stripping him-
self quite naked, as most of the savages were, away
he went. After he had been gone an hour or two,
he brings word, that he had been among them undis-
covered, that he found there were two parties, and
of two several nations, who had war with one ano-
ther, and had had a great battle in their own country,
and that both sides having had several prisoners
taken in the fight, they were, by mere chance, landed
in the same island, for the devouring their prisoners,
and making merry; but their coming so by chance
to the same place had spoiled all their mirth: that
they were in a great rage at one another, and were
so near that he believed they would fight again, as
soon as daylight began to appear; but he did not
perceive that they had any notion of any body's
being on the island but themselves. He had hardly
made an end of telling his story, when they could
perceive, by the unusual noise they made, that the
two little armies were engaged in a bloody fight.
The battle held two hours, before they could guess
which party would be beaten; but then that party
which was "nearest our people's habitation began to
appear weakest, and, after some time more, some of
them began to fly; and this put our men into a great
consternation, lest any of those that fled should run
into the grove before their dwelling for shelter, and
thereby involuntarily discover the place, and that,
by consequence, the pursuers should do the like in
search for them. As they expected, it fell out:
three of the routed army fled for life, and crossing
the creek, ran directly into the place, not in the
least knowing whither they went, but running as
into a thick wood for shelter. Upon this, the Spani-
ard governor, a man of humanity, would not suffer
them to kill the three fugitives:" but, sending three
men out by the top of the hill, ordered them to go
round, and come hj behind them, surprise, and take
them prisoners, which was done. The residue of the
conquered people fled to their canoes, and got off to
sea; the victors retired, and made no pursuit, or very
little, but drawing themselves into a body together,
gave two great screaming shouts, which they sup-
posed was by way of triumph ; and so the fight
ended. The same day, about three o'clock in the
afternoon, they also marched to their canoes. And
thus the Spaniards had their island again free to
themselves; their fright was over, and they saw no
savages for several years after.
This deliverance tamed even the three English
brutes I have been speaking of, and, for a great
while after, they were tractable, and went about the
common business of the whole society well enough;
planted, sowed, reaped, and began to be quite agree-
able; but some time after this, they fell into such
measures again as brought them into great trouble.
The three savages, who were took prisoners, were
made servants or slaves; and they were all stout,
lusty fellows. After some time, one of the English-
men, a most turbulent fellow, being in a rage with
one of the slaves, because the fellow had not done
something right which he bade him do, and seemed
a little uutraetable in his showing him, drew a
hatchet out of a frog belt, in which he wore it by
his side, and fell upon the poor savage, not to correct
him, but to kill him. One of the Spaniards who was
by, seeing him give the fellow a barbarous cut with
the hatchet, which he aimed at his head, but struck
into his shoulder, so that he thought he had cut the
poor creature's arm off, ran to him, and, entreating
him not to murder the poor man, clapped in between
him and the savage, to prevent the mischief. The
fellow, being enraged the more at this, struck at the
Spaniard with his hatchet, and swore he would serve
him as he intended to serve the savage, which the
Spaniard perceiving, avoided the blow, and, with a
shovel, which he had in his hand (for they were
working in the field, about their corn land), knocked
the brute down. Another of the Englishmen, run-
ning at the same time to help his comrade, knocked
the Spaniard down; and then two Spaniards more
came to help their man, and a third Englishman fell
upon them. They had none of them any fire-arms,
or any other weapons, but hatchets and other tools.
except this third Englishman; he had one of my old
rusty cutlasses, with which he made at the last
Spaniard*, and wounded them both. This fray set
the whole family in an uproar, and more help coming
in, they took the three Englishmen prisoners. The
next question was, what should be done with them.
They had been so often mutinous, and were so furi-
ous, so desperate, and so idle withal, that they knew
not what course to take with them; for they were
mischievous to the highest degree, and valued not
what hurt they did to any man, so that, in short, it
was not safe to live with them.
The Spaniard who was governor, told them, that
if they had been his own countrymen, he would have
hanged them all, for all laws, and all governors, were
to preserve society, and those who were dangerous
to society ought to be expelled out of it; but as they
were Englishmen, and that it was to the generous
kindness of an Englishman that they all owed their
preservation and deliverance, he would use them with
all possible lenity, and would leave them to the judg-
ment of the other two Englishmen, who were their
countrymen. One of the two honest Englishmen
stood up, and said, they desired it might not be left
to them; "For," says he, " I am sure we ought to
sentence them to the gallows." And with that he
gives an account how Will Atkins, one of the three,
had proposed to have all the five Englishmen join
together, and murder all the Spaniards, when they
were in their sleep.
When the Spaniard governor heard this, he calls
to Will Atkins, "How, Seignior Atkins," says he,
"would you murder us all? what have you to say to
that J" That hardened villain was so far from deny-
ing it, that he said it was true, and they would do it
still before they had done with them. "Well, but
Seignior Atkins," said the Spaniard," what have we
done to you that you would kill us? and what would
you get by killing us? and what must we do to pre-
vent your killing us? We must kill you, or you will
kill us! Why will you put us to the necessity of
this, Seignior Atkins?" says the Spaniard very
calmly, and smiling.
Atkins was in a great rage, which obliged them to
consider seriously what was to be done. After a
long debate it was agreed, first, that they should be
disarmed, and not permitted to have either gun or
powder, or any weapon; and should be turned out
of the society, and left to live where they would, and
how they could, by themselves; but none of the rest,
either Spaniards or English, should converse with
them, or have any thing to do with them; that they
should be forbid to come within a certain distance of
the place where the rest dwelt; and that if they
offered to commit any disorder, so as to spoil, burn,
kill, or destroy any of the corn, plantings, buildings,
fences, or cattle, belonging to the society, that they
should die without mercy, and they should shoot
them wherever they could find them.
They went away sullen and refractory, as neither
contented to go away nor to stay; but as there was
no remedy, they went pretending to go and choose a
place where they would settle themselves to plant
and live by themselves; and some provisions were
given them, but no weapons.
About four or five days after, they came again for
some victuals, and gave the governor an account
where they had pitched their tents, and marked
themselves out a habitation and plantation. Here
they built themselves two handsome huts, and con-
trived them in a manner like my habitation, being
close under the shade of a hill, having some trees
growing already on three sides of it, so that by
planting others, it would be very easily covered from
the sight, unless narrowly searched for. They de-
sired some dried goat-skms for beds and covering,
which were given them; and, upon giving their
words, that they would not disturb the rest, or injure
any of their plantations, they gave them hatchets,
and what other tools they could spare, some peas,
barley, and rice, for sowing, and, in a word, any thing
they wanted, but arms and ammunition.
About three quarters of a year after this separa-
tion, a new frolic took these rogues, which, together
with the former villany they had committed, brought
mischief enough on them, "and had very near been
the ruin of the whole colony. The three new asso-
ciates began, it seems, to be weary of the laborious
life they led, and that without hope of bettering their
circumstances; and a whim took them, that they
would make a voyage to the continent, from whence
the savages came, and would try if they could not
seize upon some prisoners among the natives there,
and bring them home, so as to make them do the
laborious part of their work for them.
The three fellows came down to the Spaniards one
morning, and, in very humble terms, desired to be
admitted to speak with them. The Spaniards very
readily heard what they had to say, which was this;
that they were tired of living in the manner they
did; that they were not handy enough to make
the necessaries they wanted, and that, having no help,
they found they should be starved ; but if the Spani-
ards would give them leave to take one of the canoes
which they came over in, and give them arms and
ammunition proportioned for their defence, they
would go over to the main, and seek their fortune,
and so deliver them from the trouble of supplying
them with any other provisions.
The Spaniards told them with great kindness, that
if they were resolved to go, they should not go naked
men, and be in no condition to defend themselves;
and that, though they could ill spare their fire-arms,
having not enough for themselves, yet they would
let them have two muskets, a pistol, and a cutlass,
and each man a hatchet, which they thought was
sufficient for them. In a word they accepted the
offer, and having baked them bread sufficient for a
month, and gave them as much goat's flesh as they
could eat while it was sweet, and a great basket full
of dried grapes, a pot full of fresh water, and a young
kid alive to kill, they boldly set out in a canoe for a
voyage over the sea, where it was at least forty miles broad.
The boat, indeed was a large one, and would have
very well carried fifteen or twenty men, and, there-
fore, was rather too big for them to manage; but as
they had a fair breeze, and the flood tide with them,
they did well enough. They had made a mast of a
long pole, and a sail of four large goat skins dried,
which they had sewed or laced together ; and away
they went merrily enough. The Spaniards called
after them, "Bon veyajo," and no man ever thought
of seeing them any more.
The Spaniards would often say one to another, and
the two honest Englishmen who remained behind,
how quietly and comfortably they lived, now those
three turbulent fellows were gone. As for their ever
coming again, that was the remotest thing from
their thoughts that could be imagined; when behold,
after twenty-two days absence, one of the English-
men being abroad upon his planting work, sees three
strange men coming towards him, at a distance, two
of them with guns upon their shoulders.
Away runs the Englishman, as if he was bewitched,
and came frighted and amazed to the governor
Spaniard, and told him they were all undone, for there
were strangers landed upon the island, he could not
tell who? The Spaniard, pausing awhile, says to
him, "They are savages to be sure."—"No, no,"
says the Englishman, "they are men in clothes,
with arms."—" Nay, then," says the Spaniard, " why
are you concerned! If they are not savages they
they must be friends; for there is no Christian nation
upon earth but will do us good, rather than harm."
While they were debating thus, came the three
Englishmen, and standing without the wood, which
was new planted, hallooed to them. They presently
knew their voices, and so all the wonder of that kind
ceased. But now the admiration was turned upon
another question: viz. what could be the matter,
and what made them come again. It was not long
before they brought the men in, and inquiring where
they had been, and what they had been doing, they
gave them a full account of their voyage in a few
words; viz. that they reached the land in two days,
or something less, and they found the people very
courteous and friendly to them, and they gave them
several roots, and some dried fish, and appeared very
sociable; and the women, as well as the men, were
very forward to supply them with any thing they
could get for them to eat, and brought it to them a
great way upon their heads. They continued here
four days, and inquired as well as they could of them
by signs, what nations were this way, and that way;
and were told of several fierce and terrible people,
that lived almost every way, who, as they made
known by signs to them, used to eat men; but as for
themselves, they said that they never eat men or
women, except only such as they took in the wars;
and then they owned that they made a great feast,
and eat their prisoners.
The Englishmen inquired, when they had a feast
of that kind, and they told them two moons ago,
pointing to the moon, and then to two fingers: and
that their great king had two hundred prisoners now,
and that they were feeding them fat for the next feast.
The Englishmen seemed desirous to see the prisoners,
but the others mistaking them, thought they were
desirous to have some of them, to take away for their
own eating. So they beckoned to them, pointing to
the setting of the sun, and then to the rising, which
was to signify, that the next morning, at sunrising,
they would bring some for them; and, accordingly,
the next morning, they brought down five women,
and eleven men, and gave them to the Englishmen to
carry with them on their voyage. As brutish and barbarous as these fellows were at
home, their stomachs turned at this sight, and they
did not know what to do; to refuse the prisoners,
would have been the highest affront they could offer
to the savage gectry, and what to do with them they
knew not. However, they resolved to accept of
them, and in return, gave the savages that brought
them one of their hatchets, an old key, a knife, and
six or seven of their bullets, which, though they did not
understand, they seemed extremely pleased with; and
then tying the poor creatures' hands behind them,
they dragged the prisoners into the boat for our
men.
The Englishmen were obliged to come away as
soon as they had them, or else they that gave them
this noble present would certainly have expected that
they should have gone to work with them, have
killed two or three of them the next morning, and,
perhaps have invited the donors to dinner. Having
taken their leave, they put off with their boat, and
came back towards another island, where they set
eight of their prisoners at liberty, there being too
many for their occasion; after which they steered
towards home again.
When the three wanderers had given this unac-
countable history, or journal, of their voyage, the Spaniards asked them where their new family was;
and, being told that they had brought them on shore,
and put them into one of their huts, and were come
to beg some victuals for them, the Spaniards, and two
Englishmen, resolved to go down to the place and
see them, and Friday's father went with them.
When they came into the hut, there they sat all
bound; for when they had brought them on shore,
they bound their hands; and all of them stark
naked. First, there were three men, lusty, come y
fellows, well shaped, straight and fair limbs, about
thirty to thirty-five years of age; and five women,
whereof two might be from thirty to forty, two more
not above twenty-four or twenty-five, and the fifth,
a tall, comely maiden, about sixteen or seventeen.
The first thing they did was to cause the old Indian,
Friday's father, to go in, and see first if he knew any
of them: and then, if he understood any of their
speech. As soon as the old man came in, he looked
seriously at them, but he knew none of them, neither
could any of them understand a word he said, or a
sign he could make, except one of the women.
However, this was enough to answer the end,
which was to satisfy them that the meti into whose
hands they were fallen were christians, that they
abhorred eating either men or women, and that they
might be sure they would not get killed. As soon as
they were assured of this, they discovered such joy,
and by such awkward ways, as is hard to describe;
for it seems they were of several nations.
The woman who was the interpreter, was bid, in
the next place, to ask them if they were willing to
be servants, and to work for the men who had brought
them away to save their lives. At which they all
fell a dancing; and presently one fell to taking up
this, and another that, any thing that lay next, to
carry, to show they were willing to work.
The governor, who found that the having of women
among them would presently be attended with some
inconvenience, and might occasion some strife, and
perhaps blood, asked the three men what they in-
tended to do with these women, and how they in-
tended to use them, whether as servants or women.
One of the Englishmen answered very boldly and
readily, that they would use them as both. To which
the governor said, "I am not going to' restrain you
from it, you are your own masters as to that; but
this I think is but just, for avoiding all disorders and
quarrels among you, and I desire it of yon for that
reason only, that if you will all engage, if any of you take any of these women as a woman, or a wife, he
shall take but one, and that, having taken one, none
else should touch her; for though we cannot marry
anjr of you, yet it is lint reasonable that, while you
stay here, the woman any of you take should' be maintained by the man that takes her, and should be
his wife; I mean," says he," while he continues here,
and that none else should have any thing to do with
her." All this appeared so just, that everyone agreed
to it without any difficulty; and the five Englishmen
(the Spaniards declining the offer) drew lots for
choice, so that each had a wife.
But now I come to a scene different from all that
happened before, either to them or to me, and the
original of the story was this :—
Early one morning there came on shore five or six
canoes of Indians, or savages, and there is no room
to doubt that they came upon the errand of feeding
upon their slaves. But that part was now so familiar
to the Spaniards, and to our men too, that they did
not concern themselves about it as I did : but having
been made sensible, by their experiences, that their
only business was to lie concealed, they had nothing
to do but to give notice to all the three plantations
x 2 to keep within doors, and not show themselves, only
placing a scout in a proper place to give notice when
the boats went off to sea again.
This was without doubt very right; but a disaster
spoiled all these measures, and made it known among
the savages that there were inhabitants there, which
was, in the end, the desolation of almost the whole
colony. After the canoes with the savages were
gone off, the Spaniards peeped abroad again, and
some of them had the curiosity to go to the place
where they had been, to see what they had been
doing. Here, to their great surprise, they found
three savages left behind, and lying fast asleep upon
the ground; it was supposed they had been so gorged
with their inhuman feast, that, like beasts, they were
asleep, and would not stir when the others went, or
they were wandered into the woods, and did not come
back in time to be taken in.
The Spaniards were greatly surprised at this sight,
and perfectly at a loss what to do. The Spaniard governor, as it happened, was with them, and his
advice was asked, but he knew not what to do; as
for slaves, they had enough already, and as to killing
them, they were none of them inclined to that.
So they resolved to awaken them, and take them
prisoners, and they did so. The poor fellows were
strangely frightened when they were seized upon and
bound, and afraid that they should be murdered and
eaten; for, it seems, those people think all the world
do as they do, eating men's flesh; but they were soon
made easy as to that, and away they carried them.
It was very happy for them that they did not carry
them home to their castle, but they carried them first
to the bower, where was the chief of their country
work, such as the keeping of the goats, the planting
of the corn, &C., and afterwards they carried them to
the habitation of the two Englishmen.
Here they were set to work", though there was not
much for them to do: and, whether it was by negli-
gence in guarding them, or that they thought the
fellows could not mend themselves, I know not, but
one of them ran away, and, taking into the woods,
they could never hear of him more.
They had good reason to believe he got home again
soon after, in some other boats or canoes of savages,
who came on shore three or four weeks afterwards,
and who, carrying on their revels as usual, went off
in two days' time. This thought terrified them ex-
ceedingly; for they concluded, and that not without
good cause indeed, that if this fellow got safe home
among his comrades, he would certainly give them
an account that there were people in the island.
The first testimony they had that this fellow had
given intelligence of them was, that about two months
after this, six canoes of savages, with about seven or
eight, or ten men in a canoe, came rowing along the
north side of the island, where they never used to
come before, and landed about an hour after sun-rise
at a convenient place, about a mile from the habita-
tion of the two Englishmen, where this escaped man
had been kept. As the Spaniard governor said," Had
they been all there, the damage would not have been
BO much, for not a man of them would have escaped."
But the case differed now very much; for two men
to fifty was too much odds. The two men had the
happiness to discover them about a league off, so that
it was about an hour before they landed; and as they
landed about a mile from their huts, it was some
time before they could come at them.
Now having great reason to believe that they were
betrayed, the first thing they did was to bind the two
slaves which were left, and cause two of the three
men whom they brought with the women, who it
seems proved very faithful to them, to lead them with
their two wives, and whatever they could carry away
with them, to their retired place in the woods, which
I have spoken of before, and there to bind the two
fellows, hand and foot, till they heard farther.
When the poor frighted men had secured their
wives and goods, they sent the other slave they had
of the three who came with the women, and" who
was at their place by accident, away to the Spaniards
with all speed, to give them the alarm, and desire
speedy help: and, in the mean time, they took their
arms, and what ammunition they had, and retreated
towards the place in the wood, where their wives
were sent, keeping at a distance, yet so that they
might see, if possible, which way the savages took.
They had not gonefar, butthat,fromarising ground,
they could see the little army of their enemies come
on directly to their habitation, and, in a moment more,
could see all their huts and household stuff flaming
up together, to their great grief and mortification.
They kept their station for a while, till they found the
savages, like wild beasts, spread themselves all over
the place, rummaging every way and every place
they could think of, in search for prey; and, in par-
ticular, for the people, of whom it now plainly ap-
peared they had intelligence.
The two Englishmen, seeing this, thinking them-
selves not secure where they stood, because, as it was
likely some of the wild people might come that way,
so they might come too many together, thought
it proper to make another retreat, about half a mile
further, believing, as it afterwards happened, that the
farther they strolled the fewer would be together.
The next halt was at the entrance into a very
thick-grown part of the woods, and where an old
trunk of a tree stood, which was hollow, and vastly
large; and in this tree they both took their standing,
resolving to see there what might offer.
They had not stood there long, but two of the
savages appeared running directly that way, as if
they had already had notice where they stood, and
were coming up to attack them; and, a little way
farther, they spied three more coming after them,
and five more beyond them, all coming the same way,
besides which they saw seven or eight more at a dis-
tance, running another way; for, in a word, they ran
every way, like sportsmen beating for their game.
The poor men were now in great perplexity, whe-
ther they should stand and keep their posture or fly.
But, after a very short debate with themselves, they
considered, that if the savages ranged the country
thus, before help came, they might, perhaps, find out
their retreat in the woods, and then all would be lost,
so they resolved to stand them there ; and if there
were too many to deal with, then they would go up
to the top of the tree, from whence they doubted not
to defend themselves, fire excepted, as long as their
ammunition lasted, though all the savages that were
landed, which were near fifty, were to attack them.
Having resolved upon this, they next considered
whether they should fire at the first two, or wait for
the three, and so take the middle party; by which
the two, and the five that followed, would be sepa-
rated. At length, they resolved to let the first two
pass by, unless they should spy them in the tree, and
come to attack them. The first two savages also
confirmed them in this resolution, by turning a
little from them towards another part of the wood;
but the three and the five after them, came forwards
to the tree. as if they knew they were there.
. Seeing them come so straight towards them, they
resolved to take them in a line as they came; and as
they resolved to fire but one at a time, perhaps the
first shot might hit them all three; to which purpose,
the man who was to fire put three or four bullets
into his piece, and, having a fair loophole, from a
broken hole in the tree, he took a sure aim, without
being seen, waiting till they were within about thirty
yards of the tree, so that he could not miss.
While they were thus waiting, and the savages
came on, they plainly saw that one of the three was
the runaway savage that had escaped from them;
and they both knew him distinctly, and resolved
that, if possible, he should not escape, though1 they
should both fire; so the other stood ready with his
piece, that if he did not drop at the first shot, he
should be sure to have a second.
But the first was too good a marksman to miss his
aim; for, as the savages kept near one another, a
little behind in a line, in a word, he fired, and hit
two of them directly. The foremost was killed out-
right, being shot in the head; the second, which was
the runaway Indian, was shot through the body and
fell, but was not quite dead; and the third had a
little scratch in the shoulder, perhaps by the same
ball that went through the body of the second, and,
being dreadfully frightened, though not much hurt,
sat down upon the ground, screaming and yelling in
a hideous manner.
The five that were behind, more frightened with
the noise than sensible of their danger, stood still at
first; for the woods made the sound a thousand times
bigger than it really was: the echoes rattling from
one side to another, and the fowls rising from all
parts, screaming, and making every sort of noise, j ust
as it was when I fired the first gun that, perhaps, was
ever shot in that place since it was an island.
However, all being silent again, they not knowing
what the matter was, came on unconcerned, till they
came to that place where their companions lay, in a
condition miserable enough. And here the poor,
ignorant creatures, not sensible that they were within
reach of the same mischief, stood all in a group over
the wounded men. Our two men resolved to let fly
both together among them, and, singling out by
agreement which to shoot at, they shot together, and
killed, or very much wounded, four of them; the
fifth, frightened even to death, though not hurt, fell
with the rest: so that our men, seeing them all fall
together, thought they had killed them all.
The belief that the savages were all killed, made
our two men come boldly out from the tree before
i;
they had charged their guns again, which was a
wrong step; and they were surprised when they
came to the place and found no less than four of the
men alive, and of them, two very little hurt, and one
not at all. This obliged them to fall upon them with
the stocks of their muskets; and, first, they made
sure of the runaway savage, that had been the cause
of all the mischief, and of another that was hurt in
his knee, and put them out of their pain. Then the
man that was not hurt at all, came and kneeled down
to them, with his two hands held up, nnd made
;iteons moans to them, by gestures and signs, for
is life, but could not say one word to them that
they could understand.
However, they shrned to him to sit down at the
foot of a tree there by, and one of the Englishmen,
with a piece of rope-twine which he had by great
chance in his pocket, tied his feet fast together, and
his hands behind him, and there they left him.
They now resolved to go to the place where their
wives were, to see if all was well there ; and when
they came thither, they found the savages had been
in the wood, and very near the place, hut had not
found it; for, indeed, it was inaccessible, by the
trees standing so thick, unless the persons seeking it
had been directed by those that knew it, which these
were not. They found, therefore, every thing very
safe, only the women in a terrible fright. While
they were here, they had the comfort of seven of the
Spaniards coming to their assistance; the other ten,
with their servants, and Friday's father, were gone
in a body to defend their bower, and the corn and
cattle that were kept there, in case the savages
should have rowed over to that side of the country,
but they did not spread so far. With the seven
Spaniards came one of the three savages, who, as I
said, were their prisoners formerly, and with them
also came the savage whom the Englishmen had left
bound hand and foot at the tree; for it seems they
came that way, saw the slaughter of the seven men,
and unbound the eighth, and brought him along with
them, where, however, they were obliged to bind
him again, as they had done the two others who
were left when the third ran away. They then re-
solved, with great caution, to go forward towards
their ruined plantation. But a little before they
came thither, coming in sight of the sea shore, they
saw plainly the savages all embarking again in their
canoes, in order to be gone.
The prisoners began now to be a burden to them,
and they were so afraid of their escaping, that they
thought they were under an absolute necessity to
kill them for their own preservation. However, the
Spaniard governor would not consent to it, but
ordered that they should be sent out of the way to
my old cave in the valley, and be kept there, with
two Spaniards to guard them, and give them food, and
they were bound there hand and fuot for that night.
The poor Englishmen, being now twice ruined, and
all their improvements destroyed, the rest all agreed
to come and help them to rebuild, and to assist them
with needful supplies. Their three countrymen, who
were not yet noted for having the least inclination to
any good, yet, as soon as they heard of it (for they,
living remote eastward, knew nothing of the matter
till all was over,) came and offered their help and
assistance, and did very friendly work, for several
days, to restore their habitations, and make neces-
saries for them; and thus, in a little time, they were
set upon their legs again.
It was five or six months after this before they
heard any more of the savages, in which time our
men were in hopes that they had not forgot their
former bad luck, or had given over the hopes of
better, when, on a sudden, they were invaded with a
most formidable fleet of no less than twenty-eight
canoes full of savages, armed with bows and arrows,
great clubs, wooden swords, and such like engines of
war; and they brought such numbers with them, that
it put all our people into the utmost consternation.
As they came on shore in the evening, and at the
eastermost side of the island, our men had that night
to consult what to do; and knowing that their being
entirely concealed was their only safety before, and
would be much more so now, when the number of
their enemies was so great; they therefore resolved,
first of all, to take down the huts which were built
for the two Englishmen, and drive away their goats
to the old cave, because they supposed the savages
would go directly thither, as soon as it was day, to
play the old game over again.
They then drove away all the flock of goats they
had at the old bower, as I called it, which belonged
to the Spaniards; and, in short, left as little appear-
ance of inhabitants any where as possible; and the
next morning early they posted themselves, with all
their force, at the plantation of the two men, waiting
for their coming. As they guessed, so it happened:
these new invaders, leaving their canoes at the east
end of the island, came ranging along the shore
directly towards the place, to the number of two
hundred and fifty, as near as our men could judge.
Our army was but small indeed, being but twenty-
nine, slaves and all; but that which was worse, they
had not arms for all their number neither. To their
slaves they did not give either musket or fusil, but
they had every one a halbert, or a long staff, like a
quarter-staff, with a great spike of iron fastened to
each end of it, and by his side a hatchet; also every
one of our men had hatchets. Two of the women
could not be prevailed upon, but they would come
into the fight, and they had bows and arrows, which
the Spaniards had taken from the savages when the
first action happened, where the Indians fought with
one another; and the women had hatchets too.
The Spaniard governor commanded the whole;
and Will Atkins, who, though a dreadful fellow for
wickedness, was a most daring, bold fellow, com-
manded under him. The savages came forward like
lions, and our men, which was the worst of their fate.
had no advantage in their situation; only that Will
Atkins, who now proved a most useful fellow, with
six men, was planted just behind a small thicket of
bushes, as an advanced guard, with orders to let the
first of them pass by, and then fire, into the middle of
them, and as soon a's he had fired, to make his retreat
as nimbly as he could, round a part of the wood, and
so come in behind the Spaniards where they stood,
having a thicket of trees all before them. When the
savages came on, they ran straggling about every
way all in heaps, out of all manner of order, and Will
Atkins let about fifty of them'pass by him; then
seeing the rest come on in a very thick throng, he
orders three of his men to fire, having loaded their
muskets with six or seven bullets apiece, about as
big as large pistol bullets. How many they killed
or wounded, they knew not, but the consternation
and surprise was inexpressible among the savages,
who were frightened to the last degree, to hear such
a dreadful noise, and see their men killed, and others
hurt, but see nobody that did it; when, in the middle
of their fright, Will Atkins, and his other three, let
fly among the thickest of them: and, in less than a
minute, the first three, being loaded again, gave them
a third volley.
Had Will Atkins and his men retired immediately,
as soon as they had fired, as they were ordered to do;
or had the rest of the body been at hand, to have
poured in their shot continually, the savages had
been effectually routed; for the terror that was
among them came principally from this, viz. that
they were killed by the gods with thunder and light-
ning, and could see nobody that hurt them; but Will
Atkins staying to load again, they discovered the cheat.
Some of the savages, who were at a distance, spy-
ing them, came upon them behind, and though Atkins
and his men fired at them also, two or three times,
and killed above twenty, retiring as fast as they
could, yet they wounded Atkins himself, and killed
one of his fellow Englishmen with their arrows, as
they did afterwards one Spaniard, and oue of the
Indian slaves who came with the women: this slave
was a most gallant fellow, and fought most despe-
rately, killing five of them with his own hand, having no weapon but one of the armed staves and a hatchet.
The men being thus hard laid at, Atkins wounded,
and two other men killed, retreated to a rising ground
in the wood; and the Spaniards, after firing three
volleys upon them, retreated also, for their number
was so great, and they were so desperate, that though
above fifty of them were killed, and more than as
many of them wounded, yet they came on in the
teeth pf our men, fearless of danger, and shot their
arrows like a cloud; and it was observed, that their
wounded men, who were not quite disabled, made
outrageous by their wounds, fought like madmen.
When the men retreated, they left the Spaniard
and the Englishman that were killed behind them,
and the savages, when they came up to them, broke
their arms, legs, and heads, with their clubs and
wooden swords, like true savages. But finding our
men were gone, they did not seem to pursue them,
but drew themselves up in a kind of a ring, which is,
it seems, their custom, and shouted twice, in token
of their victory.
The Spaniard governor having drawn his little body
up together upon a rising ground, Atkins, though he
was wounded, would have had him march, and
charge them altogether, at once. But the Spaniard
replied," Seignior Atkins, you see how their wounded
men fight: let them alone till morning; all these
wounded men will be stiff and sorewith theirwounds,
and faint with the loss of blood, and so we shall have
the fewer to engage." The advice was good, but
Will Atkins replied merrily, "That's true, seignior,
and so shall I too, and that's the reason I would go
on while I am warm."—"Well, Seignior Atkins,"
says the Spaniard," you have behaved gallantly, and
done your part: we will fight for you, if you cannot
come on; but I think it best to stay till morning."
So they waited.
But as it was a clear moonlight night, and they
found the savages in great disorder about their dead
and wounded men, and a great noise among them
where they lay, they afterwards resolved to fall upon
them in the night, especially if they could come to
give them but one volley before they were discovered.
This they had a fair opportunity to do; for one of
the two Englishmen, in whose quarter it was where
the fight began, led them round, between the woods
and the sea-side, westward, and, turning short south,
they came so near where the thickest of them lay,
that, before they were seen or heard, eight of them
fired in among them, and did dreadful execution
upon them. In half a minute more, eight others
fired after them, pouring in their small shot in such
a quantity, that many were killed and wounded, and
all this while they were not able to see who hurt
them, nor which way to fly.
The Spaniards charged again with the utmost ex-
pedition, and then divided themselves into three
bodies, and resolved to fall in among them all toge-
ther. They had in each body eight persons; that is
to say, twenty-four, whereof were twenty-two men,
and the two women, who fought desperately.
They divided the fire-arms equally in each party,
and so of the halherts and staves. They would have
had the women keep back, but they said they were
resolved to die with their husbands. Having thus
formed their little army, they marched oat from the
trees, and came up to the teeth of the enemy, shouting
and hallooing as loud as they could. The savages
stood all together, but were in the utmost confusion,
heating the noise of our men shoating from three
quarters together. They would have fought if they
had seen us. and as soon as we came near enough to
be 'seen, some arrows were shot, and poor old Friday
was wounded, though not dangerously. But our men
gave them no time, but running up to them fired on
them three ways, and then fell in with the butt-ends
of their muskets, their swords, staves, and hatchets.
and laid about them so well, that they set up a dismal
screaming and howling, flying to save their lives.
Our men were tired with the execution, and killed
or wounded, in the two fights, about one hundred and
eighty of them; the rest, being frightened out of their
wits, scoured through the woods, and over the hills,
with all the speed that fear and nimble feet could
help them to do; and as our men did not trouble
themselves much to pursue them, they got altogether
to the sea-side, where they landed, and where their
canoes lay. But their disaster was not at an end yet;
for it blew a terrible storm that evening from the sea-
ward, so that it was impossible for them to put off;
nay, the storm continuing all night, when the tide
came up, their canoes were most of them driven by
the surge of the sea so high upon the shore, that it
required infinite toil to get them off, and some were
even dashed to pieces against the beach, or against
one another. Our men, though glad of their victory,
got little rest that night; but having refreshed them-
selves as well as they could, they resolved to march
to that part of the island where the savages were fled,
and see what posture they were in. When they came
within two musket-shot of them, the Spaniard go-
vernor ordered two muskets to be fired, without ball,
to alarm them: this he did, that, by their counte-
nance, he might know what to expect; viz. whether
they were in heart to fight, or were so heartily beaten,
as to be dispirited and discouraged, and so he might
manage accordingly. This stratagem took; for as
soon as the savages heard the first gun, and saw the
flash of the second, they started up on their feet,
in the greatest consternation imaginable; and, as
our men advanced swiftly towards them, they all ran
screaming and yelling away.
Will Atkins, who, notwithstanding his wound,
kept always with them, proved the best counsellor in
this case; his advice was, to take the advantage that
offered, and clap in between them and their boats,
and so deprive them of the capacity of ever returning
any more to plague the island.
In a word, he showed them the necessity of it so
plainly, that they all came into it; so they went to
work immediately with the boats, and, getting some
dry wood together from a dead tree, they tried to set
some of them on fire; but they were so wet that they
would not burn. However, the fire so burned the
upper part, that it soon made them unfit for swim-
ming in the sea as boats. When the Indians saw
what they were about, some of them came running
out of the woods, and coming as near as they could
to our men, kneeled down and cried, "Oat. oat waramokoa!" and some other words of their language,
which was understood to mean, that they begged to
have their boats spared, and that they would be gone,
and never come thither again. But our men were
now satisfied that they had no way to preserve them-
selves, or to save their colony, but effectually to pre-
vent any of these people from ever going home again,
depending upon this, that if ever so much as oite of
them got back into their country to tell the story,
the colony was undone; so that, letting them know
that they should not have any mercy, they fell to
work with their canoes, and destroyed them every
one, that the storm had not destroyed before. At
the sight of which the savages raised a hideous cry
in the woods, which our people heard plain enough;
after which they ran about the island like distracted
men, so that our men did not really know at first
what to do with them.
Nor did the Spaniards with all their prudence, con-
aider, that while they made those people thus des-
perate, they ought at the same time to have kept
good guard upon their plantations; for though it is
true, they had driven away their cattle, and the Indians did not find out their main retreat, I mean
my old castle at the hill, nor the cave in the valley,
yet they found out my plantation at the bower, and
pulled it all to pieces, and all the fences and planting
about it: trod all the corn under foot, tore up the
vines, the grapes being just then almost ripe, and did
our men inestimable damage.
The extremity and distress they were reduced to
for want of food was great, and, indeed, deplorable:
and many were afterwards found dead in the woods,
without any hurt, but merely starved to death. When our men found this, it made their hearts relent, and
pity moved them, especially the Spaniard governor, who was the most gentlemanly, generous-minded
man that ever I met with in all my life. And he
proposed, if possible, to take one of them alive, and
bring him to understand what they meant, so far as
to be able to act as interpreter, and to go among them
and see if they could not be brought to some condi-
tions, that might be depended upon to save their lives,
and do us no spoil.
It was some time before any of them could be
taken; but, being weak and half starved, one of them
was at last surprised, and made a prisoner. He was
sullen at first, and would neither eat nor drink; but,
finding himself kindly used, and victuals given him,
and no violence offered him, he at last grew tractable,
and came to himself. They brought old Friday to
him, who talked often with him, and told him how
kind the others would be to them all; that they
would not only save their lives, but would give them
a part of the island to live in, provided they would
keep in their own bounds, and not come beyond them
to injure or prejudice others; and that they should
have corn given them, to plant and make It grow for
their bread, and some bread given them for their pre-
sent subsistence; and old Friday bade the fellow go
and talk with the rest of his countrymen, and see
what they said to it, assuring them, that if they did
not agree immediately they should be all destroyed.
The poor wretches, thoroughly humbled, and reduced
in number to about thirty-seven, closed with the pro-
posal at the first offer, and begged to have some food
given them: upon which twelve Spaniards, and two
Englishmen, well armed, and three Indian slaves, and
old Friday, marched to the place where they were.
The three Indian slaves carried them a large quantity
of bread, and some rice boiled up to cakes, and dried
in the sun, and three live goats; and they were or-
dered to go to the side of a hill, where they sat down,
eat the provisions very thankfully, and were the most
faithful fellows to their words that could be thought
of; for, except when they came to beg victuals and
directions, they never came out of their bounds; and
there they lived when I came to the island, and I
went to see them.
One thing was very remarkable, viz. that they
taught them to make wicker-work, or baskets, but
they soon outdid their masters, for they made abund-
ance of most ingenious things in wicker-work, par-
ticularly all sorts of baskets, sieves, bird-cages, cup-
boards, &C. ; as also chairs to sit on, stools, couches,
beds, and abundance of other things, being very in-
genious at such work, when they were once taught.
After this, the colony enjoyed a perfect tranquillity
with respect to the savages, till I came to revisit
them, which was about two years.
I now entered into a serious discourse with the
Spaniard whom I called governor, about their stay
in the island; for, as I was not come to carry any of
them off, so it would not be just to carry off some,
aud leave others, who, perhaps, would be unwilling
to stay, if their strength was diminished.
On the other hand, I told them, I came to establish
them there, not to remove them; and then I let them
know that I had brought with me relief of sundry
kinds for them; that I had been at a great charge
to supply them with all things necessary, as well for
their convenience as their defence; and that I had
such and such particular persons with me, as well to
increase and recruit their number, as by the particular
necessary employments which they were bred to,
being artificers, to assist them in those things in
which, at present, they were to seek,
They were all together when I talked thus to them,
and before I delivered them the stores I had brought,
I asked them, one by one, if they had entirely forgot
and buried the first animosities that had been among
them, and would shake hands with one another, ;and
engage in a strict friendship and union of interest, so
that there might be no more misunderstandings or
jealousies. Will Atkins, with great frankness and
'good humour, said they had met with afflictions
enough to make them all sober, and enemies plenty
to make them all friends; that, for his part, he would
live and die with them, and was sofar from designing
any thing against the Spaniards, that, he owned,
they had done nothing to him but what his own mad
humoivr made necessary, and what he would have
done, and perhaps much worse, in their case; and
that he would ask their pardon, if I desired it, for
the foolish and brutish things he had done to them;
and was very willing and desirous of living on terms
of entire friendship:and union with them; and would
do any thing that lay in his power to convince them
of it. And as for going to England, he cared not if
he did not go thither these twenty years.
The Spaniards said they had, indeed, at first, dis-
armed and excluded Will Atkins and his two coun-
trymen, for their ill conduct, as they let me know;
and they all appealed to me for the necessity they
were under to do so. But that Will Atkins had
Y 2
behaved himself so bravely in the "rest fight they
had with the savages, and on several occasions since.
and had showed himself so faithful to, and concerned
for, the general interest of them all, that they had
forgotten all that was past, and thought he merited
as much to be trusted with arms, and supplied with
necessaries, as any of them. And as they had entire
confidence in him and all his countrymen, so they
acknowledged they had merited that confidence, by
all the methods that honest men could merit to be
valued and trusted. And they most heartily assured
me, that they would never have any interest separate
from one another.
Upon these frank and open declarations of friend-
ship, we appointed the next day to dine all together;
and, indeed, we made a splendid feast. I caused the
ship's cook and his mate to come on shore to dress our dinner, and the old cook's mate on shore assisted.
We brought on shore six good pieces of beef, and
four pieces of pork, out of the ship's provision, with
our punch-bowl, and materials to fill it, and, in par-
ticular, I gave them ten bottles of French claret,
and ten bottles of English beer ; things that neither
the-Spaniards nor the Englishmen had tasted for many years; and they were very glad of them.
The Spaniards added to our feast five whole kids,
which the cooks roasted, and three of them were
sent, covered up close, on board the ship, to the sea-
men, that they might feast on fresh meat from on
shore, as we did with their salt meat from on board.
After this feast, I brought out my cargo of goods,
wherein, that there might be no dispute about di-
vidmg, I showed them there was sufficient for them
all; and desired that they might all take an equal
quantity of the goods that were for wearing; that is
to say, equal when made up. At first, I distributed
linen sufficient to make every one of them four shirts,
but, at the Spaniard's request, afterwards made them
up six. These were exceedingly comfortable to
them, having been what, as I may say, they had long
since forgot the use of, or what it was to wear them.
I allotted the thin English stuffs, which I mentioned
before, to make every one a light coat, like a frock,
which I judged fittest for the heat of the season, cool
and loose; and ordered, that, whenever they decayed,
they should make more, as they thought fit. I also
gave them pumps, shoes, stockings, hats, &c.
I cannot express what pleasure, what satisfaction,
sat upon the countenances of all these poor men,
when they saw the care I had taken of them, and
how well I had furnished them.
Then I brought them out all my store of tools, and
gave every man a digging-spade, a shovel, and a
rake, for we had no harrows or ploughs; and to every
separate place a pick-axe, a crow, a broad axe, and
a saw, always appointing that as often as any were
broken or worn out, they should be supplied, without
grudging, out of the general stores that I left behind.
Nails, staples, hinges, hammers, chisels, knives,
scissors, and all sorts of tools and iron work, they
had as they required. And, for the use of the smith,
I left two tons of unwrought iron for a supply. My
magazine of powder and arms, which I brought them,
was such, even to profusion, that they could not but
rejoice at them.
I carried on shore with me the young man, whose
mother had died from want, and the maid also. She
was a sober, well educated, religious young woman,
and behaved so inoffensively, that every one gave
her a good word. After a while, seeing things so
well ordered, and in so fine a way of thriving upon
my island, and considering that they had neither
business nor acquaintance in the East Indies, or
reason for taking so long a voyage; I say, consider-
ing all this, both of them came to me, and desired I would give them leave to remain on the island, and
be entered among my family, as they called it. I agreed to it readily; and they had a little plot of
ground allotted to them, where they had tents, or
houses, set up.
I now presented to them the people I had brought
with me, viz. the two carpenters and the tailor, also
the smith, and my other man, whom I called "Jack
of all trades," who was almost as good as twenty
men; for he was a very ingenious fellow.
The French ecclesiastic came to me one morning,
as I was on my way to the Englishmen's colony,
and told me, with a grave countenance, that he had,
for two or three days, desired an opportunity of some
discourse with me," which he hoped would not be dis-
pleasing to me, because he thought it might, in some
measure, correspond with my general design, which
was the prosperity of my new colony, and, perhaps,
says he, "it is about your poor savages yonder, who
are (as I may say) your conquered subjects. It is a
maxim, sir, that is, or ought to be, received among
all Christians, of what church, or pretended church,
soever, viz. that Christian knowledge ought to be
propagated by all possible means, and on all possible
occasions. It is on this principle that our church
sends missionaries into Persia, India, and China, and that our clergy, even of the superior sort, willingly
engage in the most hazardous voyages, and the most
dangerous residence among murderers and barba-
rians, to teach them the knowledge of the true God,
and to bring them over to embrace the Christian
faith. Now, sir, you have such an opportunity here,
to have six or seven-and-thirty poor savages brought
over from idolatry to a knowledge of God, their
Maker and Redeemer, that I wonder how you can
pass such an occasion of doing good, which is really
worth the expense of a man's whole life." \
"Well, sir," said I, "it is a valuable thing indeed
to be au instrument in God's hand, to convert seven-
and-thirty heathen, to the knowledge of Christ. But
as you are an ecclesiastic, and are given over to that
work, so that it seems naturally to fall into the way
of your profession, how is it, then, that you do not
rather offer yourself to undertake it, than press me
to it?" Upon this he faced about just before me, as
we were walking, and, putting me to a full stop,
made me a very Tow bow. "I most heartily thank
God and you, sir," says he," for giving me so evident
a call to so blessed a work; and if you think yourself
discharged from it, and desire me to undertake it, I
will most readily do it, and think it a happy reward
for all the hazards and difficulties I have met with,
that I have dropped at last into so glorious a work."
He appeared m a kind of rapture as he said this;
and after I had considered it awhile, I asked him
seriously if he was in earnest, and that he would
venture on the single consideration of an attempt on
those poor people, to be locked up in an unplanted
island for, perhaps, his life, and at last might not
know whether he should be able to do them any good
or not? He turned short upon me, and asked me
what I called a venture. "Pray, sir," said he," what
do you think I consented to go in your ship to the
East Indies for?" "Nay," said 1, "that I know not,
unless it was to preach to the Indians." "Doubtless
it was," said he; "and do you think, if I can convert
these scven-and-thirty men to the faith of Christ, it
is not worth my time, though I should never be
fetched off the island again? Nay, is it not infinitely
of more worth to save so many souls, than my life is,
or the life of twenty more of the same profession?
Yes, sir," said he, "I would give Christ and the
blessed Virgin thanks all my days, if I could be made
the least happy instrument of saving the souls of
these poor men, though I was never to set my foot off
this islaud, or see my native country any more. But
since you will honour me," says he, "with putting
me into this work (for which I will pray for you all
Friday with me, to be my interpreter to them, and
to assist me, for without some help I cannot speak to
them, or them to me."
I was sensibly troubled at his requesting Friday,
because I could not think of parting with him, and
that for many reasons. He had been faithful, kind,
and affectionate to me, to the last degree; and as I had bred Friday up to be a Protestant, and this priest
being a Catholic, I thought it might spoil all his
religious principles. However, a sudden thought
relieved me in this strait, and it was this: I told him
I could not say that I was willing to part with Friday
on any account whatever: though a work that to
him was of more value than his life, ought to be to
me of much more value than the keeping or parting
with a servant; but, on the other hand, I was per-
Buaded that Friday would by no means consent to
part with me; and then to force him to it, without
his consent, would be manifest injustice, because I had promised I would never put him away, and he
had promised and engaged to me, that he would
never leave me, unless I put him away.
He seemed much concerned at this, for he did not
understand one word of their language, nor they one
word of his. To remove this difficulty, I told him
Friday's father had learned Spanish, which he also
understood, and he should be his interpreter: so he
was satisfied, and said he would stay and endeavour
to convert them; but Providence gave another and
very happy turn to all this.
When we came to the Englishmen, I sent for them
all together, and after some account given them of
what I had done for them, viz. what necessary things
I had provided for them, and how they were distri-
buted, which they were sensible of, and very thankful
far, I began to talk to them of the life they led, and asked them with what conscience they could take
these women and lie with them, as they had done,
call them their wives, and have so many children by
them, and not be married lawfully to them?
They all gave me the answer that I expected, viz.
that there was nobody to marry them; that they all
agreed before the governor to take them as their
wives, and to keep them and own them as their
wives; and they thought, as things stood with them,
they were as legally married as if married by a par-
son, and with all the formalities in the world.
And they told me, especially Will Atkins, who
seemed now to speak for the rest, that they loved
their wives as well as if they had been born in their
own native country, and would not leave them upon
any account whatever; and they did verily believe
their wives were as virtuous and as modest, and did,
to the utmost of their skill, as much for them and
for their children, as any women could possibly do,
and they would not part with them on any account.
And Will Atkins, added, if any man would take him
away, and offer to carry him home to England, and
make him a captain of the best man-of-war in the
navy, he would not go with him, if he might not
carry his wife and children with him, and if there
was a clergyman in the ship, he would be married to
her with all his heart. I told him I had a clergyman
with me, and if he was sincere, I would have him
married the next morning, and bade him consider of
it, and talk with the rest. He said as to himself, he
need not consider of it at all, for he was ready to do it,
and was glad I had a minister with me, and he though t
they would be all willing also. I then told him that
my friend the minister was a Frenchman, and could
not speak English, but that I would act as the clerk
between them.
Before I went from their quarter, they all came to
me and told me they had been considering what I
said; that they were very glad to hear I had a clear- gyman in my company, and they were very willing
to give me the satisfaction I desired, and to be for-
mally married as soon as I pleased, for they were far
from" desiring to part from their wives, and that they
meant nothing but what was honest when they chose
them. So I appointed them to meet me the next
morning, and that in the mean time, they should let
their wives know the meaning of the marriage law,
and that it was not only to prevent any scandal, but
also to oblige them that they should not forsake them,
whatever might happen. The women were easily
made sensible of the meaning of the thing, and were
very well satisfied with it, as indeed they had reason
to be. The next morning I brought out my clergy-
man; and though he had not on a minister's gown,
ufter the manner of England, or the habit of a priest,
after the manner of France, yet having a black vest,
something like a cassock, with a sash round it, he did
not look very unlike a minister; and as for his lan-
guage, I was interpreter.
When they arrived, and after promising to endea-
vour to persuade their wives to embrace christianity,
he married three couples; but Will Atkins and his
wife were not yet come in. After this, my clergy-
man, waiting awhile, was curious to know where
Atkins was, and turning to me, says he, "I entreat,
you, sir, let us walk out of your labyrinth here, and
look." So we went out together, and I took him a
way which none knew but myself, and where the
trees were so thick set, as that it was not easy to see
through the thicket of leaves, and far harder to see
in than to see out; when coming to the edge of the
wood, I saw Atkins and his tawny, savage wife,
sitting under the shade of a bush, very eager in dis-
course, I stopped short till my clergyman came up
to me, and then having showed him where they were,
we stood and looked at them a good while.
We observed him very earnest with her, pointing
up to the sun, and to every quarter of tUe heavens,
then down to the earth, then out to the Sea, then to
himself, then to her, then to the woods, and trees.
"Now," says the clergyman, " mark him; now he
is telling her that our (God has made him, and her,
and the heavens, the earth, the sea, the woods, the
trees, &c."—" I believe he is," said 1. Immediately
we perceived Will Atkins start up on his feet, fall upon his knees, and lift up both his hands. He did
not continue kneeling half a minute, but comes and
sits down by his wife, and talks to her again. We
perceived then the woman very attentive, but whe-
ther she said any thing or no, it was impossible for
us to tell.
Well, however, we could come no nearer, for fear
of disturbing them, so we resolved to see an end of
this piece of still conversation. He sat down again,
as I have said, close by her, and talked again very
earnestly to her, and two or three times we could see
him embrace her passionately; another time we saw
him take out his handkerchief and wipe her eyes, and
then kiss her again, with a kind of transport very
unusual; and after several of these things, we saw
him on a sudden jump up again, and lend her his
hand to help her up, when immediately leading her
by the hand a step or two, they both kneeled down
together, and continued so about two minutes.
My friend could bear it no longer, but cries out
aloud, " Saint Paul! Saint Paul! behold he prayeth!"
I was afraid Atkins would hear him, therefore I en-
treated him to withhold awhile, that we might see
the end of the scene, which to me, I must confess,
was the most affecting, and yet the 'most agreeable,
that ever I saw in my life. Well, he strove with
himself, and contained himself for awhile, but was
in such raptures of joy to think that the poor hea-
then woman was become a Christian, that he was
not able to contain himself; he wept several times,
then throwing up his hands, and crossing his breast,
said over several things ejaculatory, and by way of
giving God thanks for so miraculous a testimony of
the success of our endeavours.
When the poor man and his wife were risen again
from their knees, we observed he stood talking still
eagerly to her; and we observed by her motion that
she was greatly affected with what he said, by her
frequent lifting up of her hands, laying her hands to
her breast, anil such other postures as usually express
the greatest seriousness and attention. This conti-
nued about ten minutes, and then they went away.
Well, as Will Atkins and Ms wife were gone, our
business there was over, so we went back our own
way; and when we came back, we found them wait-
ing to be called in. Observing this, I asked my cler-
gyman if we should discover to him that we had
seen him under the bush, or no; and it was his opinion
we should not, but that we should talk to him first,
and hear what he would say to us. So we called him
in alone, nobody being in the place but ourselves, and
I began with him thus :—
"Will Atkins," said 1, " prithee what education
hadyou? What was your father?" W.A.—A better
man than ever I shall be. Sir, my father was a cler-
gyman. R. C.—What education did he give you?
W. A.—He would have taught me well, sir, but I despised all education, instruction, or correction like
a beast as I was. K. C.—It is true, Solomon says,
"He that despiseth a reproof is brutish." W. A.—.
Aye, sir, I was brutish indeed; I murdered my father;
for God's sake, sir, talk no more about that, sir; I
murdered my poor father! Priest.—Hal amurderer!
Here the priest started (for I interpreted every
word as he spoke it), and looked pale; it seems ho
believed that Will had really killed his own father.
B. C.—No, no, sir; I do not understand him so.
Will Atkins, explain yourself: you did not kill your
father, did you, with your own hands? W. A.—No,
sir; I did not cut his throat, but I cut the thread of
all his comforts, and shortened his days. I broke his
heart by the most ungrateful, unnatural return for
the most tender, affectionate treatment that ever
father gave, or child could receive. S. C.—Well, I
did not ask you about your father to extort this con-
fession: I pray God to give you repentance for it, and
forgive you that and all your other sins; but I asked
you because I see that though you have not much
learning, yet you are not so ignorant as some are in
things that are good; that you have known more of
religion than you have practised. W. A.—Though
you, sir, did not extort the confession that I make
about TUV father, conscience does; and whenever we
come to look back upon our lives, the sins against
our indulgent parents are certainly the first that
touch us; the wounds they make lie deepest, and
the weight they leave will lie heaviest upon the mind
of all the sins we can commit. S. C.—You talk too
feelingly and sensibly for me, Atkins, I cannot bear
it. W. A.—Yon bear it, master! I dare say you
know nothing of it. S. C.—Yes, Atkins, every
shore, every hill, nay, I may say, every tree in the
island, is witness to the anguish of my soul, for my
ingratitude and base usage of a good tender father;
a rather much like yours, by your description; and
I murdered my father as well as you, Will Atkins:
but I think, for all that, my repentance is short of
your's too, by a great deal.
I would have said more if I could have restrained
my passions: but I thought this poor man's repent-
ance was so much more sincere than mine, that I was going to leave off the discourse, and retire; for
I was surprised with what he said, and thought that
instead of my going about to teach and instruct him,
the man was made a teacher and instructor to me,
in a most surprising and unexpected manner.
I laid all this before the young clergyman, who
was greatly affected with it, and said to me, "Did
I not say, sir, that when this man was converted, he
would preach to us all! I tell you, sir, if this one
man be made a true penitent, here will bo no need of
me; he will make Christians of all in the island."
But having a little composed myself, I renewed my
discourse with Will Atkins. "But, Will," said I, " how comes the sense of this matter to touch you just now?" W. A.—Sir, you have set me about a work that has struck a dart
through my very soul. I have been talking about
God and religion to my wife, in order, as you directed
me, to make a Christian of her, and she has preached
such a sermon to me as I shall never forget while I
live. It. C.—Did you tell her what marriage was?
W. A.—Aye, aye, there began all our dialogue. I asked her if she would be married to me our way.
She asked me what way that was. I told her mar-
riage was appointed by God: and here we had a
strange talk together, as ever man and wife had.
N. B. This dialogue between W. Atkins and his
wife, as I took it down in writing, just after he told
it me^ was as follows:—
Wife.—Appointed by yonr God! why, have you a
God in your country? W. A.—Yes, my dear; God
is in every country. Wife.—No you God in my
country: my country have the great old Benamuckee
god. W. A.—Child, I am very unfit to show yon
who God is; God is in heaven, and made the heaven
and the earth, and all that in them is. Wife.—No
makce de earth; no makee my country. Will laughed
a little at her expression of God not making her
country. Wife.—No laugh: why laugh me? This
noting to laugh. He was justly reproved by his wife,
for she was a deal more serious than he was at first.
W. A.—That's true, indeed: I will not laugh at you any more, my dear. Wife.—Why, you say you
God make all! W. A.—Yes, child, our God made
the whole world, and you, and me, and all things;
for he is the only true God; there is no God but he.
He lives for ever in heaven. Wife.—What, haveyhu
de great God in you country, you no know him! No
say O to him? No do good ting for him? That no
possible. W.A.—It is true enough for all that. We
live as if there were no God in heaven, or that he
had no power on earth. Wife.—But why God let
you do so? Why he no nmkee you good live?
W. A.—It is all our own fault. Wife.—But you say me, he is great, much great, have much great
power; can makee kill when he will; why he no
makee kill when you no serve him'. No say O to
him? No be good mans? W.A.—That is true; he
might strike me dead, and I ought to expect it; for
I have been a wicked wretch, that is true; but God
is merciful, and does not deal with us as we deserve.
Wife.—How me tink you have great much God up
there (she points up to heaven), end yet no do well,
no do good ting! Can he tell? Sure he no tell what
you do? W. A.—Yes, yes, he knows and sees all
things; he hears us speak, sees what we do, knows
what we think, though we do not speak. Wife.—
What! he no hear you swear, curse, speak the great
damn? W. A.—Yes, yes, he hears it all. Wire.--Where then be the muehce great power strong?
W.A.—He is merciful; that ia all we can say for
it; and this proves him to be the true God: he is
God and not man; and therefore we are not consumed. Here Will Atkins told us, he was struck with
horror to think how he could tell his wife so clearly
that God sees, and hears, and knows the secret
thoughts of the heart, and all that we do; and yet
that he had dared do all the vile things he had done.
Wife.—Merciful! Whatyou call da t? W.A .—
He is our Father and Mak'er; and he pities and
spares us. Wife.—So then he never makee kill.
never angry when you do wicked; then he no good
himself, or no great awe. W. A.—Yes, yes, my dear;
he is infinitely good, and infinitely great, and able to
punish too; and sometimes, to show his justice and
vengeance, he lets fly his anger to destroy sinners,
and make examples. Many are cut off in their sins.
Wife.—But no makee kill you yet; then he tell you,
may be, that he no makee you kill, so you makee de
bargain with him; you do bad ting, he not be angry
at you, when he be angry at other mans? W. A.—
No, indeed: my sins are all presumptions upon his
goodness; and he would be infinitely just it he de-
stroyed me, as he has done other men. Wife.—Well,
and yet no kill, no makee you dead! What you say
to him for that? You no tell him, tankee for all that
too? W.A.—I am an unthankful, ungrateful dog,
that is true. Wife.—Why he no makee you much
good better? You say he makee you. W. A.—He
made me as he made all the world; it is I have de-
formed myself, and abused his goodness, and have
made myself an abominable wretch. Wife.-—I wish
you makee God know me; I no makee him angry;
I do no bad wicked ting.
Here Will Atkins said his heart sank within him,
to hear a poor untaught creature desire to be taught
to know God; and he such a wicked wretch, that he
could not say one word to her about God, but what
the reproach of his own carriage would make most
irrationable to her to believe; nay, that already she
had told him that she could not believe in God, be-
cause he that was so wicked was not destroyed.
W. A.—My dear, you mean you wish I could teach
you to know God, not God to know you, for he knows
you already, and every thought in your heart. Wife.
—Why then he know what I say to you now; he
know me wish to know him. How shall me know
who makes- me? W.A.—Poor creature, he must
teach thee. I cannot teach thee. I'll pray to him
to teach thee to know him, and to forgive me, that
am unworthy to teach thee.
The poor fellow was in such an agony at her desir-
ing him to make her know God, and her wishing to
know him, that he said he fell down on his knees
before her, and prayed to God to enlighten her mind
with the saving knowledge of Jesus Christ, and to
pardon his sins, and accept of his being the unworthy
instrument of instructing her.in the principles of re-
ligion; after which he sat down by her again, and
their dialogue went on.
N. B. This was the time when we saw him kneel
down, and lift up his hands.
Wife.—What you putdown thekueefor? Whatyou
hold up the hand for? What you say? Who you speak to? What is all that? W. A.—My dear, I
bow my knees in token of my submission to him that
made me. I said "O," to him, as you call it; and
as you say your old men do to their idol Benamuckee,
that is, I prayed to him. Wife.—What you say O
to him for? W. A.—I prayed to him to open your
eyes and your understanding, that you may know
him, and be accepted by him. Wife.—Can he do
that too? W. A.-- Yes, he can: he can do all things.
Wife.—But he no hear what you say? W. A.—Yes,
he has bid us pray to him, and promised to hear us.
Wife.—Bid you pray? When he bid you? How
he bid you? W'hatt you hear him speak? W. A.—
No, I do not hear him speak; but he has revealed
himself many ways to us.
Here he was at a great loss to make her under-
stand, that God has revealed himself to us by his
word, and what his word was; but, at last, he told
it her thus:—
W. A.—God has spoken to some good men, in
former days, even from heaven, by plain words; and
God has inspired good men by his Spirit, and they
have written all his laws down in a book. Wife.—
Me no understand that. Where is that book? W. A.
—Alas! my poor creature, I have not got this book?
but I hope I shall, one time or other, get it for you,
and help you to read it.
Here he embraced her with great affection; but
with inexpressible grief that he had not a Bible.
Wife.—But how you makee me know that God
teaches them to write that book? W. A.—By the z
same rule that we know him to be God. Wife.—
What rule, what way you know? W. A.—Because
he teaches and commands nothing but what is good,
righteous, and holy; and tends to make us perfectly
§pod, as well as perfectly happy; and because he for-
ids and commands us to avoid all that is wicked,
that is evil in itself, or evil in its consequences.
Wife.—That me would understand, that me fain see;
if he reward all good thing, punish all wicked thing,
he teaches all good things, forbid all wicked thing;
he makee all thing, he give all thing; he hear me
when I say O to him, as you go do just now; he
makee me good, if I wish be good; he spare me, no
makee kill me, when I no be good. All this you say
he do; yes, he be great God; me say O to liim too,
with you, my dear.
Here the poor man said he could forbear no longer;
but raising her up, made her kneel by him, and he
prayed to God aloud, to instruct her in the knowledge
of himself by his Spirit, and that, by some good pro-
vidence, if possible, she might, some time or other,
come to have a Bible, that she might read the word
of God, and be taught by it to know him.
This was the time that we saw him lift her up by
the hand, and saw him kneel down by her, as above.
This was a strange account, and very affecting to
us both, but particularly to the young clergyman.
However, he turned himself to me, and told me, that
he believed there must be more to do with this woman
than to marry her. I did not understand him at first,
but at length he explained himself; viz. that she
ought to be baptized.
I agreed with him to that part readily; but when
he was preparing to baptize her, I entreated him that
he would perform that office with some caution, that
the man might not perceive he was of the Roman
church, if possible, because of other ill consequences
which might attend a difference among us in that
very religion which we were instructing the other
in. He told me that as he had no consecrated chapel,
no proper things for the office, I should see he would
do it in a manner that I should not know by it that
he was a Roman Catholic myself, if I had not known
it before. And so he did; for saying only some words
over to himself in Latin, which I could not under-
stand, he poured a dish full of water upon the
woman's head, pronouncing in French, very loud,
"Mary," which was the name her husband desired
me to give her, for I was her godfather, " I baptize
thee in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and
of the Holy Ghost;" so that none could know any
thing by it what religion he was of.
As soon as this was over he married them, and after
the marriage was over, he turned himself to Will
Atkins, and, in a very affectionate manner, exhorted
him, not only to persevere in that good disposition
he was in, but to support the convictions that were
upon him, by a resolution to reform his life; told him
it was in vain to say he repented, if he did not for-
sake his crimes; represented to him how God had
honoured him with being the instrument of bringing
his wife to the knowledge of the christian religion;
and that he should be careful he did not dishonour
the grace of God. And thus ended the ceremony.
I think it was the most pleasant, agreeable day to
me that ever I passed in my whole life.
Having thus brought the affair of the island to a
narrow compass, I was preparing to go on board the
ship, when the young man whom I had taken out of
the famished ship's company came to me, and told
me, he understood I had a clergyman with me, and
that I had caused the Englishmen to be married to
the savages, whom they called wives; that he had a
match too, which he desired might be finished before
I went, between two Christians, which, he hoped,
would not be disagreeable to me.
I knew this must be the young woman who was
his mother's servant, for there was no other christian
z 2
woman on the island: so I began to persuade him
not to do any thing of that kind rashly, or because
he found himself in this solitary circumstance. He
smiled, and told me that I was mistaken in my guess,
for the persons he wished to be married was my Jack
of all trades, and his maid Susan.
I was most agreeably surprised when he named the
match, for indeed I thought it very suitable. The
character of that man I have given already; and
as for the maid, she was a very honest, modest,
sober, and religious young woman; had a very good
share of sense, and agreeable enough in her person,
very handy and housewifely in any thing that was
before her, an excellent manager, and fit, indeed, to
have been governess to the whole island.
The match being proposed in this manner, we mar-
ried them the same day; and as I was father at the
altar, as I may say, and gave her away, so I gave
her a portion, for I appointed her and her husband a
handsome, large space of ground for their plantation.
One thing I must not omit; and this is, that being
now settled in a kind of commonwealth among them-
selves, and having much business in hand, it was but
odd to have seven-and-thirty Indians live in a nook
of the island, independent, and, indeed, unemployed;
for, excepting the providing themselves food, which
they had difficulty enough to do sometimes, they had
no manner of business or property to manage. I
proposed, therefore, to the governor Spaniard that he
should go to them with Friday's father, and propose
to them to remove, and either plant for themselves,
or take them into their several families as servants,
to be maintained for their labour, but without being
absolute slaves; for I would not permit them to make
them slaves by force, by any means.
They most willingly embraced the proposal, and
came all very cheerfully along with him. So we al-
lotted them land and plantations, which three or four
accepted of, but all the rest chose to be employed 8>
servants in the several families we had settled. And
thus my colony was in a manner settled, as follows:
—the Spaniards possessed my original habitation,
which was the capital city, and extended their plan-
tation all along the side of the brook, which made
the creek I have so often described, as far as my
bower, and as they increased their culture, it went
always eastward. The English lived in the north-
east part, where Will Atkins and his comrades began,
and came on southward, and south-west, towards the
back part of the Spaniards; and every plantation had
an addition of land to take in, if they found occasion.
All the west-end of the island was left uninha-
bited, that if any of the savages should come on
shore there, only for their usual, customary barba-
rities, they might come and go, if they disturbed
nobody, nobody would disturb them.
It now came into my thoughts, that I had hinted
to my friend the clergyman that the work of con-
verting the savages might perhaps be set on foot in
his absence, to his satisfaction; and I told him that
now I thought it was put in a fair way; for, the
savages being thus divided among the christians, if
they would but every one do their part with those
which came under their hands, I hoped it might
have a very good effect.
He agreed presently in that: "If," said he, " they
will do their part: but how shall we obtain that of
them?" I told him we would call them all together,
and leave it in charge with them, or go to them one
by one, which he thought best. So we divided it;
he to speak to the Spaniards, who were all Papists,
and I to the English who were all Protestants; and
we recommended it earnestly to them, and made
them promise, that they would never make any dis-
tinction of Papist or Protestant in their exhorting
the savages to turn Christians : but teach the general
knowledge of the true God, and of their Savior Jesus Christ; and they likewise promised us that they
would never have any differences or disputes, one
with another about religion.
When I came to Will Atkins's house, I found the
young woman I have mentioned before, and Atkins's
wife, were become intimates, and this prudent, reli-
gious young woman had perfected the work Will
Atkins had begun; and though it was not above four
days after what I have related, yet the new-baptized
savage woman was made such a Christian as I have
seldom heard of any like her, in all my observation
or conversation in the world.
It came next into my mind, in the morning before
I went to them, that, among all the needful things I had to leave with them, I had not left a Bible, in
which J showed myself less considering for them than
my good friend the widow was for me, when she sent
me the cargo of one hundred pounds from Lisbon,
where she packed up three Bibles and a Prayer-book.
I took one of the Bibles in my pocket, and
when I came to Atkins's tent or house, I found the
young woman, and Atkins's baptized wife were dis-
coursing of religion together. "O, sir," says Will
Atkins, "when God has sinners to reconcile to him-
self, and aliens to bring home, he never wants a mes-
senger. My wife has got a new instructor. I knew
I was as unworthy as I was incapable of that work;
that young woman has been sent hither from heaven;
she is enough to convert a whole island of savages."
The young woman blushed, and rose up to go away,
but I desired her to sit still. I told her she had' a
good work upon her hands, and I hoped God would
bless her in it.
We talked a little, and I did not perceive they had
any book among them, though I did not ask ; bat I
put my hand in my pocket, and pulled out my Bible.
"Here," said I to Atkins, " I have brought you an
assistant, that, perhaps, you had not before." The
man was so confounded, that he was not able to speak
for some time; but recovering himself, he takes it
with both his hands, and, turning to his wife, "Here,
my dear," says he, " did I not tell you our God,
though he lives above, could hear what we said?
Here is the book I prayed for, when you and I kneeled
down under the bush; now God has heard us, and
sent it." When he had said thus, the man fell into
such transports of a passionatejoy, that between the
joy of having it, and giving God thanks for it, the
'tears ran down his face like a child that was crying.
The woman was surprised, and was like to have
run into a mistake that none of us were aware of;
for she firmly believed God had sent the book upon
her husband's petition. It is true, that providentially
it was so, and might be taken in a consequent sense;
yet it was too serious a matter to suffer any delusion
to take place; so I turned to the young woman, and
told her, we did not desire to impose upon the new
convert in her first and more ignorant understanding
of things, and begged her to explain to her, that God
may be very properly said to answer our petitions,
when, in the course of his providence, such things
are, in a particular manner, brought to pass, as we
petitioned for; but we do not expect returns from
Heaven in a miraculous and particular manner, and
that it is out of mercy that it is not so.
This the young woman did afterwards effectually.
But the surprise and joy upon Will Atkins is really
not to be expressed. Surely no man was ever more
thankful in the world for any thing of its kind, than
he was for this Bible; and, I believe, never any man
was glad of a Bible from a better principle: and
though he had been a most profligate creature, des-
perate, headstrong, outrageous, furious, and wicked,
to a great degree, yet this man is a standing rule to
us all for the well-instructing children, viz. that
parents should never give over to teach and instruct,
or ever despair of the success of their endeavours,
let the children be ever so obstinate, refractory, or,
to appearance, insensible of instruction.
I did not think fit to let them know any thing of
the sloop I had framed, and which I had thought of
setting up among them; for I was afraid if I left it,
some of them might endeavour to make their escape
in it from the island. and thus diminish the strength
of the colony. Neither did I leave the two pieces of
brass cannon that I had on board, or the two quarterdeck guns that my nephew took extraordinary; for
I thought they had arms sufficient to qualify them
for a defensive war against any that should invade
them.
I have now done with the island. I left them all
in good circumstances, and in a flourishing condition,
and went on board my ship again the 5th day of May,
having been nve-and-twenty days among them; and,
as they were all resolved to stay upon the island till
I came to remove them, I promised to send some
farther relief from the Brazils, if I could possibly
find an opportunity; and particularly I promised to
send them some cattle, such as sheep, hogs, and cows.
The next day, giving them a salute of five guns at
parting, we set sail, and arrived at the Bay of All
Saints, in the Brazils, in about twenty-two days,
meeting nothing remarkable in our passage, except
on the third day, towards evening, the sea smooth,
and the weather calm, we saw the sea, as it were,
covered, towards the land, with something very
black, not being able to discover what it was, but
after some time, our chief mate, going up the main
shrouds a little way, and looking at them with a
perspective glass, cried out it was an army. I could
not imagine what he meant by an army, and spoke a
little hastily, calling the fellow a fool, or some such
word. "Nay, sir," said he, "do not be angry, for it
is an army, and a fleet too; for I believe there are
a thousand canoes, and you may see them paddle
along, and they are coming towards us, too, apace,
and full of men.
I was a little surprised then, indeed and so was
ROBINSONCRUSOE. MImy nephew the captain. However, I bade him not
to be afraid, but bring the ship to an anchor, as soon
as we came so near as to know that we must engage
them. The weather continued calm, and they came
on apace towards us; so I gave orders to come to an
anchor, and furl all our sails. As for the savages, I
told them they had nothing to fear but fire, and
therefore they should get their boats out, and fasten"
them, one -close by the head, and the other by the
stern, and man them both well, and wait the issue
in that posture. This I did that the men in the
boats might be ready, with sheets and buckets, to
put out any fire these savages might endeavour to fix
upon the outside of the ship.
In this posture we lay by for them, and, in a little
while, they came up with us; but never was such a
horrid sight seen bv Christians. My mate was much
mistaken in his calculation of their number, I mean
of a thousand canoes; the most we could make of
them when theycame up, being about a hundred and
twenty-six, and a great many of them had sixteen or
seventeen men in them, some more, and the least six
or seven. They came very near us, and seemed to
go about to row round us: but we called to our men
in the boats not to let them come too near them.
This very order brought us to an engagement with
them, without our designing it; for five or six of
their large canoes came so near our long boat, that
our men beckoned with their hands to them to keep
back, which they understood very well, and went
back; but, at their retreat, about fifty arrows came
on board us from those boats, and one of our men in
the long-boat was very much wounded. However,
I called to them not to fire by any means: but we
handed down some deal boards into the boat, and the
carpenter presently set up a kind offence, like waste
boards, to cover them from the arrows of the savages,
if they should shoot again.
About half an hour afterwards, they came all up in
a body astern of us, and pretty near; but, in a little
time more, they rowed somewhat farther out to sea,
till they came "directly broadside with us, and then
rowed down straight upon us, till they came so near
that they could hear us speak. Upon this, I ordered
all my men to keep close, lest they should shoot any
more arrows, and make all our guns ready: but,
being so near as to be within hearing, I made Friday
go out upon the deck, and call aloud to them in his language to know what they meant, which he accord-
ingly did. Whether they understood him or not,
that I knew not; but as soon as he had called to
them, six of them, who were in the foremost boat,
turned their canoe from us, and stooping down,
showed us their naked backsides, just as if, in
English, they bade us kiss . Whether this was-
.a defiance, or challenge, we know not; or whether
it was done in mere contempt, or as a signal to the
-rest; but immediately Friday cried out they were
going to shoot; and unhappily for him, poor fellow f
.they let fly about three hundred of their arrows, and,
to my inexpressible grief, killed poor Friday, no other
man'being in their sight. The poor fellow was shot
with no less than three arrows, and about three more fell very nigh him; such unlucky marksmen they
were. I was so enraged with the loss of my old
servant, the companion of all my sorrows and soli-
tudes, that I immediately ordered five guns to be
loaded with small shot, and four with great, and gave
them such a broadside as they never had in their
lives before. They were not above half a cable's
length off when we fired; and our gunners took their
aim so well, that three or four of their canoes were overset, as we had reason to believe, by one shot only.
I can neither tell how many we killed, nor how
many we wounded, at this broadside; but sure such
a fright and hurry never was seen among such a
multitude: there were thirteen or fourte 911 of their
canoes split, and overset, in all, and the mm all set
a swimming; the rest, frightened out of their wits,
scoured away as fast as they could; and our men
took up one poor fellow swimming for his life, above
an hour after they were all gone.
In three hours or thereabouts, we could not see
above three or four straggling canoes ; nor did we
ever see the rest any more, for a breeze of wind
springing up the same evening, we weighed, and set
sail for the Brazils.
The prisoner we had got was so sullen, that for
some time he would neither eat nor speak, and we
all fancied he would pine himself to death. When
he was more tractable, and we had taught him to
speak a little English, he told us that they were
going with their kings to fight a great battle. When
he said kings, we asked him how many kings. He
said there were five nation, and that they all joined
to go against two nation. We asl ed him what made
them come up to us. He said, "to makee te great
wonder look." Where it is to be observed, that all
those natives, as also those of Africa, when they
learn English, they always add two e's at the end of
the words where we use one, and place the accent
upon them, as "makee, takee," and the like; and we
could not break them off it; nay, I could hardly
make Friday leave it off, though at last he did.
And now I name the poor fellow once more, I must
take my last leave of him. Poor honest Friday! we
buried him with all the decency and solemnity pos-
sible, by putting him into a coffin, and throwing him
into the sea; and I caused them to fire eleven guns
for him: and so ended the life of the most grateful,
faithful, honest, and most affectionate servant that
ever man had.
We now went away with a fair wind for the Brazils,
and in about twelve days' time we made land. I found my old partner alive, and after various con-
gratulations and presents between us, I got him to
engage men to set up the sloop which I had brought
MUIIOBINSXJN CKUSOB.
with me from England, as I have said, for the use of
my colony, in order to send the refreshments 1 in-
tended to my plantation. When it was finished, I
gave the master of her such instructions as he could
not miss the place; nor did he miss it, as I had an
account from my partner afterwards. One of our
seamen, who had been on shore with me there, offered
to go with the sloop, and settle there, upon my letter
to the governor Spaniard to allot him a sufficient
quantity of land for a plantation; so I granted all
he desired, giving him some clothes, and tools for his
planting-work; I also gave him the savage which we
had taken prisoner of ^war, to be his slave; and or-
dered the governor Spaniard to give him his share of
every thing he wanted with the rest. When we were fitting this man out, my old partner
told me there was a certain very honest fellow, a
Brazil planter, of his acquaintance, who had fallen
into the displeasure of the church. He said he be-
lieved he was a heretic in his heart; and that he had
been obliged to conceal himself for fear of the Inquisi-
tion. He told me that this man would be very glad
of such an opportunity to make his escape, with his
wife and two daughters, and if I would let them go
to my island, and allot them a plantation, he would
give them a small stock to begin with; for the officers
of the Inq uisition had seized all his effects and estate,
and he had nothing left but a little household stuff,
and two slaves.
I granted this presently, and joined my English-
man with them; and we concealed the man, and his
wife and daughters, on board the ship, till the sloop
put out to go to sea; and then (having put all their
goods on board the sloop some time before) we put
them on board the sloop, after she was got out of
the bay.
Among the supplies sent to my tenants in the
island, by this sloop, were three milch cows and five
calves, about twenty-two hogs, three sows big with
pig, two mares, and a stone-horse. I also sent some
materials for planting sugar-canes, with some plants
of canes. For my Spaniards, according to promise,
I sent three Portuguese women, and recommended
it to them to marry them, and use them kindly. I
could have procured more women, but I remembered
that the poor persecuted man had two daughters,
and there were but five of the Spaniards that wanted:
the rest had wives, though in another country.
All this cargo arrived safe, and, as may be sup-
posed, very welcome to my old inhabitants, who were
now (with this addition^ between sixty and seventy
people, besides little children, of which there were a
great many. I found letters at London from them,
all by way of Lisbon, when I came back to England,
being sent back to the Brazils by this sloop, of which
I shall take some notice in its place.
I have now done with my island; and the reader
must expect to read only of the follies of an old man,
not warned by his own harms, much less by those of
other men, to beware of the like; not cooled by
almost forty years of misery and disappointment;
nor satisfied with prosperity beyond expectation;
not made cautious by affliction and distress beyond
imitation.
I should only add here, that my honest and truly
pious clergyman left me here: a ship being ready to
go to Lisbon, he asked me leave to go thither, being
still, as he observed, bound never to finish any voyage
he began. How happy had it been for me if I had
gone with him.
From the Brazils we made directly away over the
Atlantic Sea, to the Cape of Good Hope. We made
no stay there longer than was needful to take in
fresh water, but made the best of our way for the
coast of Coromandel. We touched at the island of
Madagascar, where, though the people are fierce and
treacherous, and, in particular, very well armed
,with lances and bows, which they use with incon-
ceivable dexterity, yet we fared very well with
them a while: they treated us very civilly, and, for
some trifles which we gave them, such as knives,
scissors, &C., they brought us eleven good fat bul-
locks, middling in size, but very good in flesh, which
we took in, partly for fresh provisions for our present
spending, and the rest to salt for the ship's use.
It happened one evening, when we went on shore,
that a greater number of their people came down
than usual, but were all very friendly and civil.
They brought with them several kinds of provisions,
for which we satisfied them with such toys as we
had: their women also brought us milk and roots,
and several things very acceptable to us, and all was
quiet. The men staid on shore all night.
I know not what was the occasion, but I was not
so well satisfied to lie on shore asthe rest; and the
boat lying at an anchor, about a stone's cast from the
land, with two men in her to take care of her, I made
one of them come on shore, and, getting some boughs
of trees to cover us also in the boat, I spread the sail
on the bottom of the boat, and lay on board, under
the cover of the branches of the trees, all night.
About two o'clock in the morning we heard one of
our men making a terrible noise on shore, calling out,
for God's sake, to bring the boat in, and come and
help them, for they were all like to be murdered : at
the same time I heard the firing of five muskets,
which was the number of the guns they had, and that
three times over: for it seems the natives here were
not so easily frighted with guns as the savages were
in America, where I had to do with them.
All this while I knew not what was the matter,
but rousing immediately from sleep with the noise, I caused theboat to be thrust in, and resolved, with three
fusils we had on board, to land, and assist our men.
We got the boat soon to the shore, but our men
were in too much haste; for being come to the shore,
they plunged into the water to get to the boat with
all the expedition they could, being pursued by
between three and four hundred men. Our men were
but nine in all, and only five of them had fusils with.
them: the rest indeed had pistols and swords, but
they were of small use to them.
We took up seven of our men, and with difficulty
enough too, three of them being very ill wounded;
and that which was still worse "was, that while we
stood in the boat to take our men in, we were in an
much danger as they were on shore, for they poured
their arrows in upon us so thick, that we were fain
to barricade the side of the boat up with the benches,
and two or three loose boards, which, to our great
satisfaction, we had, by mere accident, or Providence
rather, in the boat.
And yet, had it been day-light, they are, it seems.
such exact marksmen, that if they could have seen
but the least part of any of us, they would have been
sure of us. We had, by the light of the moon, a little
sight of them, as they stood pelting us from the shore
with darts and arrows; and having got ready our
fire-arms, we gave them a volley, and we could hear
by the cries ot some of them that we had wounded
several. However, they stood thus in battle array
on the shore till break of day, which we suppose was,
that they might see the better to take their aim at us.
In this condition we lay, and could not tell how to
weigh anchor, or set up our sail, because we must
needs stand up in the boat, and they were as sure to
hit us as we were to hit a bird in a tree with small
shot. We made signals of distress to the ship, which,
though she rode a league off, yet my nephew, the
captain, hearing our firing, and, by glasses, perceiving
the posture we lay in, and that we fired towards the
shore, pretty well understood us, and weighing anchor
with all speed, he stood as near the shore as he durst
with the ship, and then sent another boat, with ten
hands in her, to assist us; but we called to them not
to come too dear, telling them what condition we
were in. However, they stood in nearer to us; and
one of the men, taking the end of a tow-line in his
hand, and keeping our boat between him and the
enemy, so that they could not perfectly see him, swam
on board us, and made the line fast to the boat, upon
which we slipped our little cable, and, leaving our
anchor behind, they towed us out of the reach of the
arrows, we all the while lying close behind the bar-
ricade we had made.
As soon as we were got from between the ship and
the shore, that she could lay her side to the shore, we
ran along just by them, andwe poured in a broadside
among them, loaded with pieces of iron and lead,
small bullets, and such stuff, besides the great shot,
which made a terrible havoc among them.
When we were got on board, and out of danger, we
had time to examine into the occasion of this fray:
and indeed our supercargo, who had been often in
those parts, put me upon it; for he said he was sure
the inhabitants would not have touched us, after we
had made a truce, if we had not done something to
provoke them to it. At length it came out, viz. that
an old woman, who had come to sell us some milk,
had brought it within our poles, with a young woman
with her, who also brought some roots or herbs; and
while the old woman (whether she was mother to the
young one or no, they could not tell) was selling us
the milk, one of our men offered some rudeness to the
wench that was with her, at which the old woman
made a great noise. However, the seaman would not
quit his prize, but carried her out of the old woman's
sight, among the trees, it being almost dark; the old
woman went away without her, and, as we suppose,
made an outcry among the people she came from,
who, upon notice, raised this great army against us
in three or four hours; and it was great odds but we
had been all destroyed.
One of our men was killed with a lance that was
thrown at him, just at the beginning of the attack,
I.1
si
as he sallied out of the tent we had made; the rest
came off free, all but the fellow who was the occa-
sion of all the mischief, who paid dear enough for his
black mistress, for we could not hear what became
of him for a great while. We lay upon the shore two
days after, though the wind presented, and made sig-
nals for him; made our boat sail up shore, and down
shore, several leagues, but in vain. So we were ob-
liged to give him over; and if he alone had suffered
for it, the loss had been the less.
I could not satisfy myself, however, without ven-
turing on shore once more to try if I could learn any
thing of him or them. It was the third night after
the action that I had a great mind to learn, if I could,
by any means, what mischief we had done, and how
the game stood on the Indian side. I was careful to
do it in the dark, lest we should be attacked again;
but I ought, indeed, to have been sure, that the men
I went with had been under my command, before I engaged in a thing so hazardous and mischievous as
I was brought into without my knowledge or design.
We took twenty stout fellows with us as any in the
ship, besides, the supercargo and myself, and we
landed two hours before midnight, at the same place
where the Indians stood drawn up the evening before.
I landed here, because my design, as I have said, was
chiefly to see if they had quitted the field, and if
they had left any marks behind them, or of the mis-
chief we had done them, and perhaps we might get
our man again.
We landed without any noise, and divided our men
into two companies, whereof the boatswain com-
manded one, and I the other. We neither could hear,
nor see any body stir, when we landed, so we marched
up, one body at a distance from the other, to the
field of battle. At first we could see nothing, it
being very dark; but by-and-bye, our boatswain, that
led the first party, stumbled, and fell over a dead
body. This made them halt awhile; for, knowing by
2 A
the circumstance, that they were at the place where
the Indians had stood, they waited for my coming
up. Here we concluded to halt till the moon began to
rise, and then we could easily discern the havoc we
had made among them. We told two-and-thirty
bodies upon the ground, whereof two were not dead.
When we had made a full discovery of all we could
come at the knowledge of, I was going on board
again; but the boatswain and his party sent me
word that they were resolved to make a visit to the
Indian town, where these dogs, as they called them.
dwelt; and desired me to go along with them; and
if they could find them, as they still fancied they
should, they did not doubt, they said, getting a good
booty, and they might find Thomas Jeffrys there;
that was the man's name we had lost.
Had they sent to ask my leave to go, I knew well
enough what answer to have given them, for I would
have commanded them instantly on board, knowing
it was not a hazard fit for us to run, who had a ship,
and a ship's loading in our charge, and a voyage to
make, which depended very much upon the lives of
the men 5 but as they sent me word they were re-
solved to go, and only asked me and my company to
go along with them, I positively refused it, and rose
up from the ground in order to go to the boat.
"Come, Jack," says one of the men, "will you go
with me? I'll go for one." Jack said he would, and
another followed, and then another, and, in a word,
they all left me but one, whom, with much difficulty,
I persuaded to stay; so the supercargo and I, with
the third man, went back to the boat, where I told
them we would stay for them, and take care to take
in as many of them as should be left; for I told them
it was a mad thing they were going about, and per-
haps most of them would share the fate of Thomas
Jeffrys.
Well, they all went away, and though the attempt
was desperate, yet they went about it warily as well as boldly. They were all well armed, for every man
had a fusil or musket, a bayonet, and a pistol. Some
of them had broad cutlasses, some of them hangers,
and the boatswain, and two more, had poleaxes;
besides which, they had among them thirteen hand-
grenadoes. Bolder fellows, and better provided,
never went about any wicked work in the world.
When they went out, their chief design was plun-
der, and they were in hopes of finding gold there;
but a circumstance, which none of them were aware
of, set them on fire with revenge, and made devils of
of them all. They went on a little way, and found a
cow tied to a tree; this they presently concluded
would be a good guide to them, for they said the
cow certainly belonged to the town before them, and
if they untied her, they should see which way she
went; if she went back, they had nothing to say to
her, but if she went forward, they had nothing to do
but to follow her. So they cut the cord, which was
made of twisted flags, and the cow went on before
them, and led them directly to the town, which, as
they reported, consisted of above two hundred houses,
or huts. Here they found all silent, as profoundly
secure as sleep, and a country that had never seen an
enemy of that kind, could make them. Upon this
they called another council, to consider what they
had to do, and, in a word, they resolved to divide
themselves into three bodies, and to set three houses
on fire, in three parts of the town: and as the men
came out, to seize and bind them, if any resisted,
they need not be asked what to do then; and so to
search the rest of the houses for plunder; but they
resolved to march first silently through the town, and
see what dimensions it was of, and consider if they
might venture upon it, or no. They did so, and des-
perately resolved that they would venture upon
them; but while they were animating one another
to the work, three of them that were a little before
the rest called out aloud, and told them that they
2 A 2
had found Thomas Jeffrys. They all ran up to the
place, and so it was indeed, for there they found the
poor fellow hanged up by one arm, and his throat
cut. There was an Indian house just by the tree,
where they found sixteen or seventeen of the principal
Indians, who had been concerned in the fray with ns
before, and two or three of them wounded with our
shot; and our men found they were awake.
The sight of their poor mungled comrade so enraged them, that they swore to one another they would be
revenged, and that not an Indian who came into
their hands should have quarter; and to work they
went immediately. Their first care was to get some-
thing that would soon take fire; so they presently
made some wildfire, by wetting a little powder in
the palms of their hands, and, in a quarter of an
hour, they set the town on fire in four or five places,
and particularly that house where the Indians were
not gone to bed. As soon as the fire began to blaze,
the poor frighted creatures began to rush out to save
their lives, but met with their fate in the attempt,
and especially at the door, where they drove them
back, the boatswain himself killing one or two with
his poleaxe; the house being large, and many in it,
he did not care to go in, but called fora hand-grenado.
and threw it among them, which, at first, frightened
them, but when it burst, made such havoc among
them, that they cried out in a hideous manner.
In short, most of the Indians who were in the open
part of the house were killed or hurt with the gre-
nado, except two or three more, who pressed to the
door, which the boatswain and two more kept with
their bayonets in the muzzles of their pieces, and
dispatched all that came that way. But there was
another apartment in the house, where the prince, or
king, or whatever he was, and several others, were;
and these they kept in till the house, which was, by
this time, all of a light flame, fell upon them, and
they were smothered or burned together.
All this while they fired not a gun, because they
would not waken the people faster than they could
master them; but the fire began to waken them fast
enough, and our fellows were glad to keep a little
together in bodies, for the fire grew so raging, all the
houses being made of light, combustible stuff, that
they could hardly bear the street between them, and
their business was to follow the fire for the surer
execution. As fast as the fire either forced the
people out of those houses which were burning, or
frighted them out of others, our people were ready
at their doors to knock them on the head, still calling
to one another to remember Thomas Jeffrys.
While this was doing, I was very uneasy, and
especially when I saw the flames of the town, which,
it being night, seemed to be just by me. My nephew,
the captain, who roused by his men too, seeing such
a fire, was very uneasy, not knowing what the matter
was, or what danger I was in, especially hearing the
guns, for by this time they began to use their fire-
arms. At last. though he could ill spare any more
men, yet, not knowing what exigence we might be
in, he takes another boat, and, with thirteen men and
himself, comes on shore to me. He was surprised to
see me and the supercargo in the boat, with no more
than two men, for one had been left to keep the boat,
and though he was glad we were well, yet he was in
the same impatience with us to know what was
doing, for thenoise continued, and theflameincreased.
Nor was I any more able to stay behind now, than
I was to persuade them not to go before; so, in short,
the captain ordered two men to row back the pinnace,
and fetch twelve men more from the ship, leaving
the long boat at an anchor, and that, when they
came back, six men should keep the two boats, and
six more come after us, so that he left only sixteen
men in the ship; for the whole ship's company con-
sisted of sixty-five men, whereof two were lost in the
quarrel which brought this mischief on.
Being now on the march, you may be sure we felt
little of the ground we trod on, and being guided by
the fire, we kept no path, but went directly to the
place of the flame. If the noise of the guns was
surprising to us before, the cries of the poor people
were now quite of another nature, and filled us with
horror. However, we went on, and at length came
to the town, though there was no entering the streets
of it for the fire. The first object we met with was
the ruins of a hut, and just before it, plain now to be
seen by the light of the fire, lay four men and three
women killed, and, as we thought, one or two more
lay in a heap among the fire. In short, there were
such instances of a rage altogether barbarous, and
of a fury something beyond what was human, that
we thought it impossible our men could be guilty of
it, or, if they were the authors of it, we thought that
every one of them ought to be put to death.
Presently four of our men came up, with the boat-
swain at their head, running over the heaps of bodies
they had killed, all covered with blood and dust, as
if they wanted more people to massacre, when our
men hallooed to them, and they came up to us. As
soon as the boatswain saw us, he set up a shout of
triumph, for having, as he thought, more help come,
and, without bearing to hear me, "Captain," says he,
11 noble captain, I am glad you are come; we have
not half done yet. Villains! hell-hound dogs! I'll
kill as many of them as poor Tom has hairs upon his
head. We have sworn to spare none of them; we'll
root out the very nation of them from the earth!"
and thus he ran on, out of breath, too, with action,
and would not give us leave to speak a word. At
last, raising my voice, that I might silence him a
little, "Barbarous dog!" said I, "what are you
doing? I won't have one more creature touched,
upon pain of death. I charge you, upon your life, to
stop your hands, and stand still here, or you are a
dead man this minute." "Why, sir," says he, " do
you know what you do, or what they have done?
If you want a reason for what we have done, come
hither;" and with that he showed me the poor
fellow hanging up in a tree, with his throat cut.
I confess I was urged then myself, and at another
time should have been forward enough; but I thought
they had carried their rage too far, and thought of
Jacob's words to his sons Simeon and Levi, " Cursed
be their anger, for it was fierce; and their wrath, for
it was cruel!" But when the men I carried with me
saw the sight, as I had done, I had as much to do to
restrain them, as I should have had with the others;
nay, my nephew himself fell in with them, and told
me, in their hearing, that he was only concerned for
fear of the men being overpowered; for, as to the
people, he thought not one of them ought to live, for
they had all glutted themselves with the murder of
the poor man, and they ought to be used like mur-
derers. Upon these words, away ran eight of my
men, with the boatswain and his crew, to complete
their bloody work: and 1, seeing it quite out of my
power to restrain them, came (away pensive and sad.
I got nobody to come back with me but the super-
cargo and two men, and with these I walked back
to the boats. Immediately I took the pinnace, and
went aboard, and sent her back to assist the men in
what might happen. By the time that the men got
to the shore again with the pinnace, our men began
to appear; they came dropping in, one by one, in
such a manner, that a small force of resolute men
might have cut them all off.
The next day we set sail, so we never heard any
more of it. Our men differed in the account of the
number they killed, some said one thing, some ano-
ther; but, according to the best of their accounts
put all together, they killed, or destroyed, about one
hundred and fifty people, men, women, and children,
and left not a house standing in the town.
As for the poor fellow, Thomas Jeffrys, they took
him down from the tree where he was hanged by one
hand, and buried him there.
However just our men thought this action to be,
I was against them in it; and 1 always, after that
time, told them God would blast the voyage, for I looked upon the blood they shed that night to be
murder in them; for though it is true they killed
Thomas Jeffrys, yet it was true that Jeffrys bras the
aggressor, had broken the truce, and had violated, or
debauched a young woman of their's who came to our
camp innocently, and on the faith of their capitulation.
The boatswain defended this quarrel when we were
afterwards on board. He said it was true that we
seemed to break the truce, but really had not, and
that the war was begun the night before, by the
natives themselves, who had shot at us, and killed
one of our men, without any just provocation; so that
as we were in a capacity to fight them, we might
also be in a capacity to do ourselves justice upon
them in an extraordinary manner; that though the
poor man had taken a little liberty with a wench, he ought not to have been murdered, and that in such a
villainous manner; and that they did nothing but
what was just, and what the laws of God allowed to
be done to murderers.
But my frequent preaching to them on this subject
had worse consequences than I expected; and the
boatswain came up boldly to me one time, and told
me he found 1 continually brought that affair upon
the stage; that I made unjust reflections upon it,
and had used the men very ill on that account, ana
himself in particular; that as I was but a passenger,
and had no command in the ship, or concern in the
voyage, they were not obliged to bear it; that they
did not know but I might have some ill design in
my head, and, perhaps, to call them to account for it when they came to England; and that, therefore,
unless I would resolve to have done with it, and also
not to concern myself any further with him, or any
of his affairs, he would leave the ship; for he did not
think it was safe to sail with me among them.
I heard him patiently enongh till he had done, and
then told him, that I did confess I had all along
opposed the massacre of Madagascar, for such I
would always call it; and that I had, on all occa-
sions, spoken mymind freely about it, though not
more upon him than any of the rest; that as to my
having no command in the ship, that was true, nor
did I exercise my authority, only took the liberty of
speaking my mind in things which publicly concerned
us all; as to what concern I had in the voyage, that
was none of his business; that 1 was a considerable
owner in the ship, and in that claim I conceived I had a right to speak, even farther than I had yet
done, and would not be accountable to him, or any
one else, and began to be a little warm with him.
He made bu* little reply to me at that time, and I
thought that affair had been over. We were at this
time in the road at Bengal; and, being willing to
see the place, I went on shore with the supercargo,
in the ship's boat, to divert myself, and towards
evening was preparing to go on board, when one of
'the men came to me, and told me, he would not have
me trouble myself to come down to the boat, for they
had orders not to carry me on board. Any one may
guess what a surprise I was in at so insolent a mes-
sage; and I asked the man who bade him deliver
that errand to me. He told me the cockswain. 1
said no more to the fellow, but bade him let them
know he had delivered his message, and that I had
given him no answer to it.
I immediately went, and found out the supercargo,
and told him the story, and, adding what I presently
foresaw, viz. that there would certainly be a mutiny
in the ship, and entreated him to go immediately on
board the ship, in an Indian boat, and acquaint the
captain of it. But I might have spared this intelli-
gence, for, before I had spoken to him on shore, the
matter was effected on board. The boatswain, the
gunner, the carpenter, and, in a word, all the inferior
officers, as soon as I was gone off in the boat, came
up to the quarter-deck, and desired to speak with
the captain; and there the boatswain, making a long
harangue, and repeating all he had said to me,
told the captain, that as I was now gone peaceably
on shore, they were loath to use any violence with
me, which, if I had not gone on shore, they would
otherwise have done, to oblige me to have gone.
They therefore thought fit to tell him, that as they
shipped themselves to serve in the ship, under his
command, they would perform it faithfully; but if I would not quit the ship, or the captain oblige me to
quit it, they would all leave the ship, and sail no
farther with him. And at that word, "all," he
turned his face about, towards the mainmast, which
was, it seems, the signal agreed on between them;
at which all the seamen being got together, they
cried out," One and all! One and all!"
My nephew the captain, was a man of spirit, and
of great presence of mind, and though he was sur-
prised at the thing, yet he told them calmly, he
would consider the matter, but that we could do
nothing in it till he had spoken to me about it. So
away he came to me with this account, a little after
the message came to me from the cockswain.
I was very glad to see my nephew, I must confess,
for I was not without apprehensions, that they would
confine him by violence, set sail, and run away with
the ship; and then I had been stripped naked in a
remote country, and nothing to help myself to. In
short, I had been in a worse case than when I was
all alone in the island. But they had not gone that
length, it seems, to my great satisfaction; and my
nephew told me what they had said to him, and how
they had sworn, and shook hands, that they would
all leave the ship, if I was suffered to come on
board. I told him he should not be concerned at it
at all, for I would stay on shore. I only desired he
would take care and send all my necessary things on
shore, and leave me a sufficient sum of money, and I
would find my way to England as well as I could.
This was a heavy piece of news to my nephew, but
there was no way, but to comply with it. So he went
on board the ship again, and satisfied the men that
his uncle had yielded to their importunity, and had
sent for his goods from on board the ship. So the
matter was over in a few hours, the men returned to
their duty, and I began to consider what course I
should steer.
I was now alone in the remotest part of the world,
as I think I may call it, for I was near three thou-
sand leagues by sea farther off from England than I was at my island; only, it is true, I might travel
here by land over the Great Mogul's country to Surat,
might go from thence to Bassora by sea, up the Gulf
of Persia, and from thence might take the way of the
caravans, over the deserts of Arabia, to Aleppo and
Scanderoon: from thence by sea again to Italy, and
so overland into France: and this, put together,
might be, at least, a full diameter of the globe.
My nephew left me two servants, or rather one
companion, and one servant; the first was clerk to
the purser, whom he engaged to go with me, and the
other was his own servant. I took a good lodging
in the house of an Englishwoman, where several mer-
chants lodged, some French, two Italians, or rather
Jews, and one Englishman. Here I was handsomely
enough entertained; and that I might not be said to
run rashly upon any thing, I stayed here above nine
months, considering what course to take, and how to
manage myself. I had some English goods with me
of value, and a considerable sum of money, my ne-
phew furnishing me with a thousand pieces of eight,
and a letter of credit for more, if I had occasion, that
I might not be straitened, whatever might happen.
I quickly disposed of my goods, and to advantage
too; and, as I originally intended, I bought here
some very good diamonds, which, of all other things,
was the most proper for me in my circumstances,
because I might always carry my estate about me.
The English merchant, who lodged with me, and
with whom I had contracted an intimate acquaint-
ance, came to me one morning: "Countryman," said
he, " I have a project to communicate to you, which,
as it suits my thoughts, may, for aught I know, suit
jour's also, when you shall have considered it.
"Here we are posted," says he, " you by accident,
and I by my own choice, in a part or' the world very
remote from our own country; but it is in a country
where, by us who understand trade and business, a
a great deal of money is to be got. If you will put
a thousand pounds to my thousand pounds, we will
hire a ship, the first we can get to our minds; you
shall be captain, I will be merchant, and we will go
a trading voyage to China."
I liked this proposal very well, and the more
because it seemed to be expressed with so much good
will, and in so friendly a manner. It was, however,
some time before we could get a ship to our mind,
and when we had got a vessel, it was not easy to get
English sailors; that is to say, so many as were ne-
cessary to govern the voyage, and manage the sailors
,which we should pick up there. After some time we
got a mate, a boatswain, and a gunner, English; a
Dutch carpenter, and three Portuguese foremast-
men; with these we found we could do well enough,
having Indian seamen, such as they were, to make up.
We made a very good voyage, and I got so much
money by the first adventure, and such an insight
into the method of getting more, that, had I been
twenty years younger, I should have been tempted
to have stayed here, and sought no farther for making
my fortune. But what was all this to a man on the
wrong side of threescore, that was rich enough, and
came abroad more in obedience to a restless desire of
seeing the world, than a covetous desire of gain
in it.
My friend now proposed another voyage to me, viz.
among the Spice Islands, and to bring home a load
of cloves from the Manillas, or thereabouts, places
where, indeed, the Dutch do trade, but the islands
partly belong to the Spaniards; though we went not
so far, but to some other, where they have not
the whole power, as they have at Batavia, Ceylon,
&c. We were not long in preparing for this voyage,
which we made very successfully, touching at Borneo,
and several islands whose names I do not remember,
and came home in about five months. We sold our
spice, which was chiefly cloves, and some nutmegs,
to the Persian merchants, who carried them to the
Gulf, and, making near five of one, we really got a
great deal of money.
A little while after this, there came in a Dutch
ship from Batavia; she was a coaster, not a European
trader, and of about two hundred tons burden. The
men, as they pretended, having been so sickly, that
the captain had not men enough to go to sea with, he
lay by at Bengal; and, as if having got money enough,
or being willing, for other reasons, to go to Europe,
he gave public notice that he would sell his ship.
This came to my ears before my new partner heard
of it, and I had a great mind to buy it. So I went
home to him, and told him of it. He considered
awhile, for he was no rash man neither, but, musing
some time, he replied, "She is a little too big; but, however, we will have her." Accordingly we bought
the ship, and, agreeing with the master, we paid for
her, and took possession. When we had done so, we
resolved to entertain the men, if we could, to join
with those we had, for the pursuing our business;
but, on a sudden, they having not received their
wages, but their share" of the money, as we after-
wards learned, not one of them was to be found.
We inquired about them, and, at length, were told
that they were all gone together by land to Agra, the
great city of the Mogul's residence, and from thence
were to travel to Surat, and so by sea to the Gulf
of Persia.
Nothing so heartily troubled me a good while, as
that I missed the opportunity of going with them,
for such a ramble, I thought, and in such company as
would both have guarded me and diverted me, would
have suited mightily with my great design, and I
should both have seen the world, and gone homewards
too. But I was much better satisfied a few days after,
when I came to know what sort of fellows they were,
for, in short, their history was, that this man they
called captain was the gunner only, not the com-
mander; that they had been a trading voyage, in
which they were attacked on shore by some of the
Malays, who had killed the captain, and three of his
men, and that after the captain was killed, these men
eleven in number, had resolved to run away with the
ship, which they did, and had brought her in at the
bay of Bengal, leaving the mate and five men more
on shore, of whom we shall hear farther.
Well, let them come by the ship how they would,
we came honestly by her, as we thought; though we
did not, I confess, examine into things so exactly as
we ought, for we never inquired any thing of the
seamen, who, if we had examined, would certainly
have faltered in their accounts, contradicted one ano-
ther, and perhaps contradicted themselves; or one
way or other, we should have seen reason to have sus-
pected them; but the man shewed us a bill of sale
for the ship, to one Emanuel Clostershoven, or some
such name (for, I suppose, it was all a forgery), and
called himself by that name, and we could not con-
tradict him; and being withal a little too unwary, or,
at least, having no suspicion of the thing, we went
through with our bargain.
However, we picked up some English seamen here
after this, and some Dutch, and we now resolved for
a second voyage to the south-east, for cloves, &C., that is to say, among the Phillipine and Malacca
isles; and, ia short, 1 spent, from first to last, six
years in this country, trading from port to port, back-
ward and forward, and with very good success, and
was now the last year, with my partner, going in the
ship above-mentioned on a voyage to China, oat de-
signing first to go to Siam to buy rice.
In this voyage, being, by contrary winds, obliged
to beat up and down a great while in the Straits of
Malacca, and among the islands, we were no sooner
got clear of those difficult seas but wefound our ship
had sprung a leak, and we were not able, by all our
industry to find out where it was. This forced us to
make for some port, and my partner, who knew the
country better than I did, directed the captain to put
into the river of Cambodia, for I had made the En-
glish mate, one Mr. Thomson, captain, not being
willing to take the charge of the ship myself. The
river lies on the north side of the bay or gulf which
goes up to Siam.
While we were here, and going often on shore for
refreshment, there comes to me one day an English-
man, and he was, it seems, a gunner's mate on board
an English East India ship, which rode in the same
river, up at, or near the city of Cambodia; what
brought him hither we knew not, but he comes up to
me, and, speaking in English," Sir," said he," you are
a stranger to me, and I to you, but I have something
to tell you that very nearly concerns you. But the
short of the story is this, the first part of which I
suppose you know well enough, viz. that you were
with this ship at Sumatra; that there your captain
was murdered by the Malays, with three of his men;
and that you, or some of those that were on board
with you, ran away with the ship, and are since
turned pirates. This is the sum of the story; but
assure yourself, if you do not put to sea immediately,
you will, the very next tide, be attacked by five
boats full of men; and, perhaps, if you are taken,
you will be hanged for a pirate. If you have any
regard for your life, and the lives of all your men,
put out to sea without fail at high water; and as
you will be gone too far out before they can come
down; for they will come away at high water; and
as they have twenty miles to come, you get near two
hours start of them by the difference of the tide, not
reckoning the length of the way; besides, as they
are boats and not ships, they will not venture to
follow you far out to sea, especially if it blows."
"Well," said 1, " you have been very kind in this:
what shall I do for you, to make you amends?"
"Sir," says he, "you may not be so willing to make
me amends, because you may not be convinced of the
truth of it. I'll make an offer to you; I have nine-
teen months pay due to me on board the ship ,
which I came out of England in; and a Dutchman
that is with me has seven months pay due to him; if
you will make good our pay to us, we will go along
with you; if you find nothing more in it, we will
desire no more; but if we do convince you that we
have your life, and the ship, and the lives of all the
men in her, we will leave the rest to you."
I consented to this readily, and went immediately
on board, and the two men with me. As soon a« I came to the ship's side, my partner, who was on
board, came out on the quarter-deck, and called to
me with great joy, "O ho! O ho ! we have stopped
the leak!"—"Say"you so," said I ; "thank God; but
weigh the anchor immediately."—" Weigh!" says
he, " what do you mean by that? what is the matter?"
says he. "Ask no questions," said 1, "but all hands .
to work, and weigh without losing a minute." He
was surprised; but, however, he called the captain,
and he immediately ordered the anchor to be got lip;
and though the tide was not quite done, yet a little
land-bree~ze blowing, we stood out to sea. Then I called him into the cabin, and told him the story in
general 4 and we called in the men, and they told us
the rest of it; but as it took up a great deal of time,
so before we had done, a seaman comes to the cabin
door, and calls out to us, that the captain bade him
tell us we were chased. "Chased?" said I, " by
whom, and by what?"—" By five sloops, or boats,"
said the fellow, " full of men."—" Very well," said
I, "then it is apparent there is something in it." In
the next place, I ordered all our men to be called up,
and told them that there was a design to seize the
ship, and to take us for pirates, and asked them if
they would stand by us, and by one another. The
men answered cheerfully that, one and all they would
live and die with us. Then I asked the captain what
way he thought best for us to manage a fight with
them, for resist them I resolved we would, and that
to the last drop. He said readily, that the way was
to keep them off with our great shot as long as we
could, and then to fire at them with our small arms,
to keep them from boarding us; but when neither of
these would do any longer, we should retire to our
close quarters: perhaps they had not materials to
break open our bulk-heads, or get in upon us.
The gunner had, in the mean time, orders to bring
two guns to bear fore and aft, out of the steerage, to
clear the deck, and load them with musket-bullets
and small pieces of old iron, and what came next to
hand; and thus we made ready for fight, but all this
while kept out to sea, with wind enough, and could
see the boats at a distance, being five large long-
boats, following us with all the sail they could make.
Two of these boats, which by our glasses we could
see were English, had outsailed the rest, were near
two leagues a-head of them, and gained upon us con-
siderably, so that we found they would come up with
us; upon which we fired a gun without a shot to
intimate that they should bring to, and we put out a
flag of truce as a signal for parley; but they kept
crowding after us till they came within shot. Upon
SB
this we took in our white flag, they having made no
answer to it, hung out the red flag, and fired at them
with shot. Notwithstanding this, they came on till
they were near enough to call to them with a speak-
ing trumpet which we had on board, so we called to
them, and bade them keep off at their peril. It was all one: they crowded after us, and endedvoured to come under our stern, so to board us on our
quarter; upon which, seeing they were resolute for
mischief, and depended upon the strength that fol-
lowed them, I ordered to bring the ship to, so that
they lay upon our broadside, when immediately we
fired five guns at them, one of which had been le-
velled so true as to carry away the stern of the hin-
dermost boat, and bring them to the necessity of
taking down their sail, and running all to the head
of the boat, to keep her from sinking; so she lay by,
and had enough of it; but seeing the foremost boat
crowd still on after us, we made ready to fire at her
in particular.
While this was doing, one of the three boats that
were behind, being forwarder than the other two,
made up to the boat which we had disabled, to relieve
her, and we could afterwards see her take out her men.
We called again to the foremost boat, and offered a
truce to parley again, and to know what was her
business with us, but had no answer, only she crowded
close under our stern. Upon this our gunner, who
was a very dexterous fellow, ran out his two chase-
guns, and fired at her; but the shot missing, the men
in the boat shouted, waved their caps, and came on;
but the gunner getting quickly ready again, fired
among them the second time, one shot of which,
though it missed the boat itself, yet it fell in among
the men, and we could easily see had done a great deal of mischief among them; but we taking no
notice of that, weared the ship again, and brought
our quarter to bear upon them, and, firing three guns
more, we found the boat was split almost to pieces;
in particular, her rudder and a piece of her stern were
shot quite away; so they handed their sail immedi-
ately, and were in great disorder. But, to complete
their misfortune, our gunner let fly two guns at them
again; where he hit them we could not tell, but we
found the boat was sinking, and some of the men
already in the water. Upon this I immediately man-
ned out our pinnace, which we had kept close by our
side, with orders to pick up some of the men if they
could, and save them from drowning, and immedi-
ately to come on board with them, because we saw
the rest of the boats began to come up. Our men in
the pinnace followed their orders, and took up three
men, one of whom was just drowning, and it was a
good while before we could recover him. As soon as
they were on board, we crowded all the sail we could
make, and stood farther out to sea, and we found
that when the other three boats came up to the first
two, they gave over their chase.
Being thus delivered from a danger which, though
I knew not the reason of it, yet seemed to be much
greater than I had apprehended, I took care that we
would change our course, and not let any one imagine
whither we were going; so we stood out to sea east-
ward, quite out of the course of all European ships,
whether they were bound to China, or any where else
within the commerce of the European nations, and
resolved to go away to the coast of Tonquin, and so
on to China, and from thence, pursuing the first
design as to trade, find some way or other to dispose of
the ship, and come back in some of the vessels of the
country, such as we could get. This was approved
of as the best method for our security; and accord-
ingly we steered away N.N.E., keeping above fifty
leagues off from the usual course to the eastward.
This, however, put us to some inconveniences; for,
first, the winds, when we came to that distance from
the shore, seemed to be more steadily against us,
blowing almost trade, as we call it, from the east,
2 B 2
and E. N. E., so that we were a long while upon our
voyage; and we were but ill provided with victuals
for so long a run; and, which was still worse, there
was some danger that those English and Dutch ships,
whose boats pursued us, whereof some were bound
that way, might be got in before us, and, if not, some
other ship bound to China might have information of
us from them, and pursue us with the same vigour.
However, after a tedious and irregular course, and
very much straitened for provisions, we came within
sight of the coast very early in the morning; and,
upon reflecting on the circumstances we were in,
and the danger, if we had not escaped, we resolved
to put into a small river, which, however, had depth
enough of water for us, and to see if we could, either
over land, or by the ship's pinnace, come to know
what ships were in any port thereabouts. The place
we Were in was wild and barbarous, the people thieves,
even by occupation or profession: and though, it is
true, we had not much to seek of them, and, except
getting a few provisions, cared not how little we had
to do with them, yet it was with much difficulty that
we kept ourselves from being insulted by them.
I have observed above, that our ship sprang a leak
at sea, and that we could not find it out; and, how-
ever it happened, that, as I have said, it was stopped
unexpectedly, in the happy minute of our being to be
seized by the Dutch and English ships near the bay
of Siam; yet as we did not find the ship so perfectly
tight and sound as we desired, we resolved, while we
were in this place, to lay her on shore, take out what
heavy things we had on board, which were not many,
and to wash and clean her bottom, and, if possible,
to find out where the leaks were.
Accordingly, having lightened the ship, and
brought all bur guns, and other moveable things, to
one side, we tried to bring her down, that we might
come at her bottom: for on second thoughts we did
not think fit to lay her dry aground.
The inhabitants who had never been acquainted
with such a sight, came wandering down to the shore
to look at us, and seeing the ship lie down on one side
in such a manner, and heeling towards the shore, and
not seeing our men, who were at work on her bottom
with stages, and with their boats on the off side, they
presently concluded that the ship was cast away, and
so lay fast on the ground.
On this supposition, they came all about us in two
or three hours' time, with ten or twelve large boats,
having some of them eight, some ten men, in a boat,
intending no doubt, to have come on board and plun-
dered the ship, and, if they had found us there, to
have carried us away for slaves to their king, or
whatever they call him, for we knew nothing who
was their governor.
When they came up to the ship, and began to row
round her, they discovered us all hard at work on
the outside of the ship's bottom and side, washing
and graving, as every seafaring man knows how.
. They stood for a while gazing at us, and we, who
were a little surprised, could not imagine what
their design was; but, being willing to be sure, we
took this opportunity to get some of us into the ship,
and others to hand down arms and ammunition to
those that were at work, to defend themselves with,
if there should be occasion: and it was no more than
need, for in less than a quarter of an hour's consul-
tation they agreed, it seems, that the ship was really
a wreck; that we were all at work, endeavouring to
save her, or to save our lives by the help of our boats,
and when we handed our arms into the boats, they
concluded, by that motion, that we were endeavour-
ing to save some of our goods. Upon this, they took
it for granted that all belonged to them; and away
they came directly upon our men, as if it had been
in a line of battle.
Our men, seeing so many of them, began to be
frightened, for we lay but in an ill posture to fight,
and cried out to us to know what they should do. I
immediately called to the men who worked upon the
stage to slip them down, and get up the side into the
ship, and bade those in the boat to row round aud
come on board; and those few of us who were on
board worked with all the strength and hands we
had to bring the ship to rights. But, however,
neither the men upon the stage, nor those in the boats,
could do as they were ordered, before the Cochin-
chinese were upon them, and with two of their boats
boarded our long-boat, and began to lay hold of the
men as their prisoners.
The first man they laid hold of was an English
seaman, a stout, strong fellow, who, having a musket
in his hand, never offered to fire it, but laid it down
in the boat, like a fool, as I thought. But he under-
stood his business much better than I could teach
him, for he grappled the Pagan, and dragged him by
main force out of their own boat into ours, where,
taking him by the two ears, he beat his head so
against the boat's gunnel, that the fellow died in-
stantly in his hands; and, in the mean time a Dutch-
man, who stood next, took up the musket, aud with
the butt-end of it so laid about him, that he knocked
down five of them, who attempted to enter the boat;
but this was little towards resisting twenty or thirty
men, who fearless, because ignorant of their danger,
began to throw themselves into the long-boat, where
we had but five men to defend it. But an accident
gave our men a complete victory, which deserved
our laughter rather than any thing else, and that
was this:—
Our carpenter being preparing to grave the outside
of the ship, as well as to pay the seams where he had
caulked her to stop the leaks, had got two kettles
just let down into the boat, one filled with boiling
pitch, and the other with rosin, tallow, and oil, and
such stuff as the shipwrights use for that work; and
the man that attended the carpenter had a great iron
ladle in his hand, with which he supplied the men
that were at work with that hot stuff: two of the
enemy's men entered the boat just where this fellow
stood, being in the foresheets; he immediately sa-
luted them with a ladlet'ul of the stuff, boiling hot,
which so burned and scalded them, being half naked.
that they roared out like two bulls, and, enraged with the pain, leaped both into the sea. The carpenter
saw it, and cried out, "Well done Jack, give them
some more of it;" when, stepping forward himself,
he takes one of their mops, and, dipping it into the
pitch-pot, he and his man threw it about them so
plentifully, that, in short, of all the men in three boats,
there was not one that was not scalded and burned
with it in a most frightful manner, and made such a
howling and crying, that I never heard a worse noise.
All the while this was doing, my partner and I ,
who managed the rest of the men on board, had with
great dexterity, brought the ship almost to rights,
and having gotten the guns into their places again,
the gunner called to me to bid our boats get out of
the way, for he would let fly among them. I called
back again to him, and bid him not offer to fire, for
the carpenter would do the work without him, but
bade him heat another pitch-kettle, which our cook,
who was on board, took care of. But the enemy was
so terrified with what they met with in their first
attack, that they would not come on again; and
some of them, that were farthest off, seeing the ship
swim, as it were, upright, began, as we supposed, to
see their mistake, and give over the enterprise, find-
ing it was not as they expected. Thus we got clear of
this merry fight: and, having gotten some rice, and
some roots, and bread, with about sixteen good big
hogs, on board two days before, we resolved to stay
here no longer, but go forward, whatever came of it.
We, therefore, got all our things on board the same
evening, and the next morning were ready to sail. We would have gone into the bay of Tonquin, for we
wanted to inform ourselves of what was to be known
concerning some Dutch ships that had been there,
but we durst not stand in there, because we had seen
several ships go in, as we supposed, a little before.
So we kept on N.E. towards the Isle of Formosa, as
much afraid of being seen by a Dutch or English
merchant ship, as a Dutch or English merchant ship
in the Mediterranean is of an Algerine man of war.
When we were thus got to sea, we kept on N.E.
as if we would go to the Manillas, or the Philippine
islands, and this we did that we might not fall into.
the way of any of the European ships: and then we
steered north again, till we came to the latitude of
twenty-two degrees twenty minutes, by which means
we made the island of Formosa directly, where we
came to an anchor, in order to get water and fresh
provisions, which the people there, who are very
courteous and civil in their manners, supplied us
with willingly, and dealt very fairly and punctually
with us in all their agreements and bargains, which is
what we did not find among other people, and may
be owing to the remains of Christianity, which was
once planted here by a Dutch missionary of Pro-
testants. From hence we sailed still north, keeping
the coast of China at an equal distance, till we knew
we were beyond all the ports of China where our
European ships usually come, being resolved, if pos-
sible, not to fall into their hands, especially in this
country, where, as our circumstances were, we could
not fail of being entirely ruined.
Being now come into the latitude of thirty degrees,
we resolved to put into the first trading port we
should come at, and, standing in for the shore, a boat
came off two leagues to us, with an old Portuguese
pilot on board, who, knowing us to be a European
ship, came to offer his service, which, indeed, we
were very glad of, and took him on board. I began
to talk with him about carrying us to the Gulf of
Nanquin, which i> the most northern part of the
coast of China. The old man said he knew the Gulf
of Nanquin very well, but smiling, asked us what we
would do there.
I told him we would sell our cargo, and purchase
China wares, calicoes, raw silks, tea, wrought silks,
&c. and so would return by the same course we came.
He told us our best port had been to have put in at
Macao, where we could not fail of a market for our
opium to our satisfaction, and might, for our money,
have purchased all sorts of China goods as cheap as
we could at Nanquin. I told the old man we were
gentlemen, as well as merchants, and that we had a
mind to go and see the great city of Pekin, and the
famous court of the monarch of China. "Why then,"
says the old man, "you should go to Ningpo, where,
by the river which runs into the sea there, you may
go up within five leagues of the great canal. This
canal is a navigable made stream, which goes through
the heart of all the vast empire of China, crosses all
the rivers, passes some considerable hills by the help
of sluices and gates, and goes up to the city of Pekin,
being in length near two hundred and seventy
leagues." "Well," said I, "Seignior Portuguese,
but that is not our business now, the great question
is, if you can carry us up to the city of Nanquin,
from whence we can travel to Pekin afterwards."
He said he could do so very well, and there was a
great Dutch ship gone up that way just before. This
gave me a little shock: a Dutch ship was now our
terror, for we were in no condition to fight them; all
the ships they trade with in those parts being of
great burden, and of much greater force than we were.
The old man found me a little confused, and under
concern, when he named a Dutch ship, and said to
me, "Sir, you need be under no apprehension of the
Dutch, I suppose they are not now at war with
your nation."—" No," said I, " that's true, but I know
not what liberties men may take when they are out
of the reach of the laws of their own country."—
"Why," said he, "you are no pirates, what need
you fear? They will not meddle with peaceable mer-
chants, sure." I started at the word pirates, and he,
seeing my confusion, said, "Sir, I find you are in
some disorder in your thoughts at my talk ; pray be
pleased to go which way you may think fit, and,
depend upon it, I'll do you all the service I can."—-
"Why, seignior," said I, "it is true, I am a little
.nsettled in my resolution at this time, whither to go
in particular, and I am something more so for what
you said about pirates. I hope there are no pirates
in these seas; we are but in an ill condition to meet
with them, for you see we have but a small force,
and but very weakly manned." •
"O sir," said he, "do not be concerned; I do not
know that there have been any pirates in these seas
for fifteen years, except one, which was seen, as I
hear, in the bay of Siam, about a month since, but
you may be assured she is gone to the southward;
nor was she a ship of any great force, or fit for the
work; she was not built for a privateer, but was run
away with by a reprobate crew that were on board,
after the captain and some of his men had been
murdered by the Malays, at, or near the island of
Sumatra." "What!" said I, seeming to know no-
thing of the matter, " did they murder the captain?"
"No," said he, " I do not understand that they mur-
dered him; but, as they afterwards ran away with
the ship, it is generally believed that they betrayed
him into the hands of the Malays, who did murder
him, and, perhaps, they procured them to do it."—
"Why, then," said 1, t! they deserve death as much
as if they had done it themselves."—" Nay," said the
old man, "they do deserve it; and they will certainly
have it, if they light upon any English or Dutch
ship, for they have all agreed together, that if they
met that rogue, they will give him no quarter."
"But," said 1, "you say the pirate is gone out of
these seas; how can they meet with him then J"—
.
"Why, that's true," said he, "they do say so; but
he was, as I tell you, in the bay of Siam, in the river
Cambodia, and was discovered there by some Dutch-
men who belonged to the ship, and who were left on
shore when they ran away with her; and some
English and Dutch traders being in the river, they
were within a little of taking him. Nay," said he,
"if the foremost boats had been well seconded by the
rest, they had certainly taken him; but he, finding
only two boats within reach of him, tacked about,
and fired at these two, and disabled them before the
others came up: and then standing off to sea, the
others were not able to follow him, and so he got
away. But they have all so exact a description of
the ship, that they will be sure to know him, and,
wherever they find him, they have vowed to give no
quarter to either the captain or the seamen, but
hang them all up at the yard arm."
"What!" said I," will they execute them right or
wrong; hang them first, and judge them after-
wards?"—"O, sir," said the old pilot, " there is no
need to make a formal business of it with such rogues
as those; let them tie them back to back, and set
them a diving; it is no more than they rightly de-
serve."
I knew I had my old man fast on board, and that
he could do me no harm, so that I turned short upon
him:—" Well, now, seignior," said I, "and that is the
very reason why I would have you carry us to Nan-
quin, and not to put back to Macao, or to any other
part of the country where the English or Dutch ships
come ; for, be it known to you, seignior, those cap-
tains of English and Dutch ships are a parcel of rash.
proud, insolent fellows, that neither know what be-
longs to justice, nor how to behave themselves as the
laws of God or nature direct; but being proud of
their offices, and not understanding their power, they
would act the murderers to punish robbers, would
take upon them to insult men falsely accused, and
determine them guilty without due inquiry; and,
perhaps, I may live to call some of them to an ac-
count for it, where they may be taught how justice
is to be executed, and that no man ought to be treat-
ed as a criminal till some evidence may be had of the
crime, and that he is the man."
With this I told him, that this was the very ship
they had attacked, and gave him a full account of the
skirmish we had with their boats, and how foolishly
and coward-like they behaved. I told him the story
of our buying the ship, and how the Dutchmen ser-
ved us. I told him the reasons I had to believe this
story of killing the master by the Malays was not
true, as also the running away with the ship; but
that it was all a fiction of their own, to suggest that
the men turned pirates, and they ought to have been
sure that it was so before they had ventured to at-
tack us by surprise, and oblige us to resist them;
adding, that they would have the blood of those men,
who were killed there in our j ust defence, to answer
for. The old man was amazed at this relation, and
told us we were very much in the right to go away
to the north, and that, if he might advise us, it should
be to sell the ship in China, which we might very
well do, and buy or build another in the country.
"And," said he, "though you will not get so good
a ship, yet you may get one able enough to carry
you and all your goods back again to Bengal, or any
where else.
I told him I would take his advice, when I came
to any port where I could find a ship for my turn, or
get any customer to buy this. He replied, I should
meet with customers enough for the ship at Nanquin,
and that a Chinese junk would serve me very well to
go back again: and that he would procure me people
both to buy the one and sell the other.
"Well, but, seignior," says I, "as you say they
know the ship so well, I may, perhaps, if I follow
your measures, be instrumental in bringing some
honest, innocent men into a terrible broil, and per-
haps, occasion their being murdered in cold blood;
for, wherever they find the ship, they will prove the
guilt of the men by proving this was the ship, and so
innocent men may probably be overpowered and
murdered."—" Why, said the old man, "I'll find
out a way to prevent that also; for as I know all
those commanders you speak of very well, and shall
see them all as they pass by, I will be sure to set
them to rights in the thing." We were now at the
south-west point of the great Gulf of Nanquin, and
I asked the old pilot if there was no creek, or har-
bour that I could put into, and pursue my business
with the Chinese privately, and be in no danger of
the enemy. He told me if I would sail to the south-
ward, about two-and-forty leagues, there was a little
port, called Quinchang, where the fathers of the
mission usually landed from Macao, on their progress
to teach the Christian religion to the Chinese, and
where no European ships ever put in, and if I put in
there, I might consider what farther course to take
when I was on shore. He confessed it was not a
place for merchants, except that at some certain
times, they had a kind of fair there, when the mer-
chants from Japan came over there to buy merchan-
dises. So we agreed to go back to this place.
I was joyful, and, I may say, thankful, when I set
my foot safe on shore, resolving, and my partner too,
that, if it was possible to dispose of ourselves and
effects any other way, though not every way to our
satisfaction, we would never set foot on board that
unhappy vessel more, and, indeed, I must acknow-
ledge, that of all the circumstances of life that ever
I had any experience of, nothing makes mankind so
completely miserable as that of being in constant fear.
I cannot refrain taking notice here what reflections
I now had upon the past variety of my particular
circumstances; how hard I thought it was, that I,
who had spent forty years in a life of continued dif-
398 ROBINSON CRUSOE.ficulties, and was at last come, as it were, to the port
or haven which all men drive at—viz. to have rest
and plenty—should be a volunteer in new sorrows,
by my own unhappy choice; and that I, who had
escaped 90 many dangers in youth, should now come
to be hanged in my old age, and in so remote a
place, for a crime I was not in the least inclined to,
much less guilty of, and in a place and circumstance
where innocence was not like to be any protection at
all to me.
I was greatly cast down with these thoughts; but
sometimes natural courage would take its place, and
then I would be talking myself up to vigorous reso-
lutions, that I would not be taken to be barbarously
used by a parcel of merciless wretches; that it was
much better to have fallen into the hands of the
savages, who were men-eaters, and who, I was sure,
would feast upon me, when they had taken me, than
by those who would, perhaps, glut their rage upon
me by inhuman tortures and barbarities; that, in
the case of the savages, I always resolved to die
fighting to the last gasp, and why should I not do
so now, seeing it was much more dreadful, to me, at
least, to think of falling into these men's hands, than
ever it was to think of being eaten by men; for the
savages, to give'them their due, would not eat a man
till he was dead, but that these men had many arts
beyond the cruelty of death. And thus I tormented
myself with various thoughts for some time.
When we had got safe on shore, the old pilot, who
was now our friend, got us a lodging, and a ware-
house for our goods; it was a little house, or hot,
with a large house joining to it, all built with canes,
and palisadoed round with large canes, to keep out
pilfering thieves, of which, it seems, there were not a
few in the country. However, the magistrates
allowed us also a little guard, and we had a soldier,
with a kind of halbert, or half-pike, who stood senti-
nel at our door, to whom we allowed a pint of rice,
and a little piece of money, about the value of three-
pence per day, so that our goods were kept very safe.
The fair, or mart, usually kept in this place, had
been over some time; however, we found that there
were three or four junks in the river, and two Ja-'
panese, I mean ships from Japan, with goods which
they had bought in China, and were not gone away,
having Japanese merchants on shore. The first thing
our old Portuguese pilot did for us, was to bring us
acquainted with three missionary Romish priests,
who were in the town, and who had been some time,
converting the people to Christianity. One of these
was a Frenchman, whom they called Father Simon;
he was a jolly, well-conditioned man, very free in his
conversation, not seeming so serious and grave as the
other two did, one of whom was a Portuguese, and
the other a Genoese: but Father Simon was cour-
teous, easy in his manner, and very agreeable com-
pany; the other two were more reserved, seemed
rigid and austere, and applied seriously to the work
they came about, viz. to talk with, and insinuate
themselves among the inhabitants, whenever they
had opportunity. We often eat and drank with those
men, and though I must confess the conversion, as
they call it, of the Chinese to Christianity, is so far
from the true conversion required to bring heathen
people to the faith of Christ, that it seems to amount
to little more than letting them know the name of
Christ, say some prayers to the Virgin Mary and her
Son, in a tongue which they understand not, and to
cross themselves, and the like.
But to return to my story: this French priest,
Father Simon, was appointed, it seems, by order of
the chief of the mission, to go up to Pekin, the royal
seat of the Chinese emperor, and waited only for
another priest, who was ordered to come to him from
Macao, to go along with him; and we scarce ever
met together but he was inviting me to go that jour-
ney with him, telling me how he would show me all
the glorious things of that mighty empire, and, among; the rest, the greatest city in the world; "a city,"
said he, " that your London and our Paris put toge-
ther cannot be equal to." This was the city of Pekin,
which, I confess, is very great, and full of,people.
Dining with the priest one day, and being very
merry together, I showed some little inclination to
go with him, and he pressed rue and my partner very
hard, and with a great many persuasions, to consent.
"Why, Father Simon," says my partner, "why do
should desire our company so much? You know we
are heretics, and you do not love us, nor can keep us
company, with any pleasure."—" Oh," says he, " you
may, perhaps, be good Catholics in time: my busi-
ness here is to convert heathens, and who knows but
I may convert you too?" "Very well, father," said
I, "so you will preach to us all the way." "I will
not be troublesome to you," said he, "our religion
does not divest us of good manners; besides, we are
here like countrymen, and so we are compared to the
place we are in; and if you are Hugonots, and I a
Catholic, we may be all Christians at last; at least
we are all gentlemen, and we may converse so without
being uneasy to one another."
We had all this while our ship and our merchandise
to dispose of, and we began to be very doubtful what
we should do, for we were now in a place of very
little business; and once I was about to venture to
sail for the river Kilam, and the city of Nanquin;
but Providence seemed now more visibly, as I thought
than ever to concern itself in our affairs, and I was encouraged from this time to think I should, one way
or other, get out of this tangled circumstance, and
be brought home to my own country again, though I
had not the least view of the manner; and when I
began sometimes to think of it, could not imagine
by what method it was to be done. Providence, I
say, began here to clear up our way a little, and the
first thing that offered was, that our old Portuguese
pilot brought a Japan merchant to us, who began to
inquire what goods we had; and, in the first place, he bought all our opium, and gave us a very good
price for it, paying us in gold, by weight, some in
small pieces of their own coin, and some in small
wedges, of about ten or eleven ounces each. While
we were dealing with him for our opium, it came into
my head that he might, perhaps, deal with us for the
ship too; and I ordered the interpreter to propose it
to him. He shrugged up his shoulders at it, when it
was first proposed to him, but a few days after, he
came to me, with one of the missionary priests for his
interpreter, and told me he had a proposal to make
to me, and that was this; he had bought a great
quantity of goods of us, when he had no thoughts
at all of buying the ship, and that, therefore, he
had not money enough to pay for the ship, but if I
would let the same men who were in the ship navigate
her, he would hire the ship to go to Japan, and would
send them from thence to the Phillippine Islands with
another loading, which he would pay the freight of,
before they went from Japan, and that at their return
he would buy the ship.
The first thing we had to do was to consult the
captain of the ship, with the men, and know if
they were willing to go to Japan; and while I was
doing this, the young man whom, as I said, my
nephew had left with me as my companion for my
travels, came to me, and told me, that he thought
that voyage promised very fair, and that there was a
great prospect of advantage, and he would be glad
if I undertook it; but that if I would not, and would
give him leave, he would go as a merchant, or how I
pleased to order him; that if ever he came to
England, and I was there, and alive, he would render
me a faithful account of his success, and it should be
as much mine as I pleased.
I was really loath to part with him, but considering
the prospect of advantage, which was very con-
2 c
siderable, and that he was a young fellow as likely to
do well in it as any I knew, I inclined to let him go:
but first I told him I would consult my partner, and
five him an answer the next day. My partner and
discoursed about it, and my partner made a most
generous offer. He told me, "You know it has been an unlucky ship, and we both resolved not to go to
sea in it again ; if your steward (so he called my man)
will venture the voyage, PO leave my share of the
vessel to him, and let him make the best of it, and if
we live to meet in England, and he meets with suc-
cess abroad, he shall account for one half of the profits
of the ship's freight to us, the other shall be his own."
If my partner, who was no way. concerned with
my young man, made him such an offer, I could do
no less than offer him the same; and all the ship's
company being willing to go with him, we made over
half the ship to him in property, and took a writing
from him, obliging him to account for the other; and
away he went to Japan. The Japan merchant proved
a very punctual, honest man to him, protected him
at Japan, and got him a license to come on shore,
which the Europeans in general have not lately ob-
tained, paid him his freight very punctually, sent him
to the Philippines loaded with Japan and China
wares, and a supercargo of their own, who, trafficking
with the Spaniards, brought back European goods
again, and a great quantity of cloves and other spices ;
and there he was not only paid his freight very well,
and at a very good price, but being not willing to sell
the ship then, the merchant furnished him with goods
on his own account; that for some money, and some
spices of his own, which he brought with him, he
went back to the Manillas to the Spaniards, where
he sold his cargo very well. Here, having gotten a
good acquaintance at Manilla, he got his ship made
a free ship; and the governor of Manilla hired him
to go to Acapulco, in America, on the coast of Mexico,
and gave him a license to land there, and travel to
Mexico, and to pass in any Spanish ship to Europe
with all his men.
He made the voyage to Acapulco very happily, and
there he sold his ship: and having there also obtained
allowance to travel by land to Porto Bello, he found
means, somehow or other, to go to Jamaica with all
his treasure, and about eight years after came to
England exceeding rich.
In about four months, there was to be another fair
at that place where we -a ere, and then we might be
able to purchase all sorts of the manufactures of the
country, and, withal, might possibly find some Chi-
nese junks, or vessels, from Nanquin, that would be
to be sold, and would carry us and our goods whither
we pleased. This I liked very well, and resolved to
wait; besides, as our particular persons were not
obnoxious, so if any English or Dutch ships came
thither, perhaps we might have an opportunity to
load our goods, and get passage to some place in
India nearer home.
Upon these hopes we resolved to continue here;
but, to divert ourselves, we took two or three jour-
neys into the country. First, we went ten days'
journey to see the city of Nanquin, a city well worth
'seeing. They say it has a million of people in it,
which, however, I do not believe: it is regularly
built, the streets all exactly straight, and cross
one another in direct lines, which gives the figure of
it great advantage.
What are their buildings to the palaces and royal
buildings of Europe? What their trade to the uni-
versal commerce of England, Holland, France, and
Spain? What their cities to ours, for wealth, strength,
gaiety of apparel, rich furniture, and an infinite va-
riety? What are their ports, supplied with a few junks
and barks, to our navigation, our merchants' fleets,
our large and powerful navies? Our city of London
"as more trade than all their mighty empire. One
^English, or Dutch, or French man of war, of eighty
2 c 2
guns, would fight with, and destroy, all the shipping
of China. But the greatness of their wealth, their
trade, the power of their government, and strength
of their armies, is surprising to us; because, as I
have said, considering them as a barbarous nation of
Pagans, little better than savages, we did not expect
such things among them: and this indeed is the ad-
vantage with which all their greatness and power is
represented to us; otherwise it is in itself nothing at
all: for, as I have said of their ships, so may be said
of their armies and troops: all the forces of their
empire, though they were to bring two millions of
men into the field together, would be able to do no-
thing but ruin the country and starve themselves.
If they were to besiege a strong town in Flanders, or
fight a disciplined army, one line of German cuiras-
siers, or French cavalry, would overthrow all the
horse of China; a million of their foot could not stand
before one embattled body of our infantry, posted so
as not to be surrounded, though they were not above
a thousand in number; nay, I do not boast if I say
that thirty thousand German or English foot, and
ten thousand French horse, would fairly beat all the
forces of China. And so of our fortified towns, and
of the art of our engineers in assaulting and defending
towns: there is not a fortified town in China could
hold out one month against the batteries and attacks
of a European army; and, at the same time, all the
armies of China could never take such a town as
Dunkirk, provided it was not starved, no, not in a
ten years' siege. They have fire-arms, it is true,
but they are awkward, clumsy, and uncertain in
going off; they have powder, but it is of no strength:
they have neither discipline in the field, exercise to
their arms, skill to attack, nor temper to retreat:
and therefore I must confess it seemed strange to me,
when I came home, and heard our people say such
fine things of the power, riches, glory, magnificence,
and trade of the Chinese, because I saw and knew
that they were a contemptible herd, or crowd of
ignorant, sordid slaves, subjected to a government
qualified only to rule such a people.
I was now, as near as I can compute, in the heart
of China, about the latitude of thirty degrees north
of the line, for we were returned from Nanquin. I had indeed a mind to see the city of Pekin, which I
had heard so much of, and Father Simon importuned
me to doit. At length his time of going away being
set, and the other missionary, who was to go with
him, being arrived from Macao, it was necessary that
we should resolve either to go or not to go: so I re-
ferred him to my partner, and left it wholly to his
choice, who at length resolved it in the affirmative,
and we prepared for our journey.
We were five-and-twent> days travelling to Pekin,
through a country infinitely populous, but miserably
cultivated; the husbandry, economy, and the way of
living, all very miserable, though they boast so much
of their industry. The pride of these people is very
great, and exceeded by nothing but their poverty,
which adds to that which I call their misery. The
roads here are well paved, and well kept, and very
convenient for travellers; but nothing was more
awkward to me than to see such a haughty, imperi-
ous, insolent people, in the midst of the grossest sim-
plicity and ignorance, for all their famed ingenuity
is no more. My friend, Father Simon, and I, used
to be very merry on these occasions, to see the beg-
garly pride of those people; for example, coming by
the house of a country gentleman, as Father Simon
called him, about ten leagues off the city of Nanquin,
we had, first of all, the honour to ride with the mas-
ter of the house about two miles: the state he rode
in was a perfect Don Quixotism, being a mixture of
pomp and poverty. The habit of this greasy Don
was very proper for a scaramouch, or merry-andrew,
being a dirty calico, with all the tawdry trappings of
a fool's coat, such as hanging sleeves, taffety, and
cuts and slashes almost on every side. It covered a
rich taffety vest, as greasy as a butcher's, and which
testified that his honour most needs be a most exqui-
site sloven. His horse was a poor, lean. starved,
hobbling creature, such as in England might sell for
about thirty or forty shillings; and he had two slaves
followed him on foot to drive the poor creature along.
He had a whip in his hand, and he belaboured the
beast as fast about the head as his slaves did about
the tail ; and thus he rode by us with about ten or
twelve servants, and we were told he was going from
the city to his country seat, about half a league be- fore us. We travelled on gently, but this figure of a
gentleman rode away before us; and as we stopped
at a village about an hour to refresh us, when we
came by the country seat of this great man, we saw
him in a little place, before his door, eating his re-
past: it was a kind of garden, but he was easy to be
seen, and we were given to understand that the more
we looked on him the better he would be pleased.
He sat under a tree, something like the palmetto
tree, which effectually shaded him over the head.
He sat lolling back in a great elbow chair, being a
heavy, corpulent man; his meat being brought him
by two women slaves: he had two more, whose office,
I think, few gentlemen in Europe would accept of
their service in, viz. one fed the squire with a spoon,
and theother held thedish with one hand, and scraped
off what fell upon his worship's beard with the other;
while the great fat brute thought it below him to
employ his own hands in any of those familiar offices
which kings would rather do than be troubled with
the clumsy fingers of their servants. Leaving the
Cr wretch to please himself with our looking at
i, we pursued our journey.
I was now light-hearted, and all my trouble and
perplexity, that I have given an account of, being
over, I had no anxious thoughts about me, which
made this journey much the pleasanter to me; nor
did any ill accident attend me, only in the passing
or fording a small river, my horse fell, and made me
free of the country, as they call it, that is to say.
threw me in: the place was not deep, but it wetted
me all over. I mention it because it spoiled my
pocket-book, wherein I had set down the names of
several people and places which I had occasion to
remember, and which not taking due care of, the
leaves rotted, and the words were never after to be
read, to my great loss as to the names of some places
which I touched at in this voyage.
At length we arrived at Pekin. I had nobody
with me but the youth whom my nephew, the cap-
tain, had given me to attend as a servant, and who
proved very trusty and diligent; and my partner had
nobody with him but one servant, who was a kins-
man. As for the Portuguese pilot, he being desirous
to see the court, we bore his expenses, and, under-
standing the language, he acted as interpreter. About
a week after\ '.ve had arrived here, this old pilot came
to us, and told us he had some good news to tell us.
I asked him what it was, but it was some time before
we could get it out of him: at last he told us there
was a great caravan of Muscovite and Polish mer-
chants in the city, and they were preparing to set
out on their journey, by land, to Muscovy, within
four or five weeks, and he was sure we should take
the opportunity to go with them, and perhaps leave
him to get back to Macao as he could. I confess I was overjoyed at this intelligence; and asked him if
be was sure it was true. "Yes," said he, "I met
this morning, in the street, an old acquaintance of
mine, an Armenian, or one you call a Grecian, who
is among them; he came last from Astracan, and
was designing to go to Tonquin, where I formerly
knew him, but has altered his mind, and is now re-
solved to go back with the caravan to Moscow, and
so down the river of Wolga to Astracan?"—" Well,
seignior," said 1, do not be uneasy about being left to go back alone; if this be a method for my return
to England, it shall be your fault if you go back to
Macao at all." We then went to consulting together
what was to be done; and I asked my partner what
he thought of the pilot's news, and whether it would
suit with his affairs. He told me he would do just
as I would, for he had settled all his affairs so well
at Bengal, and left his effects in such good hands,
that as we had made a good voyage here, if he could
vest it in China silks, wrought and raw, such as
might be worth the carriage, he would be content
to go to England, and then make his voyage back to
Bengal by the Company's ships.
Having resolved upon this, we agreed that if our
Portuguese pilot would go with us, we would bear
his charges to Moscow, or to England, which he
pleased; nor indeed were we to be esteemed over
generous in that part neither, if we had not rewarded
him further ; for the service he had done us was really
worth all that, and more, for he had not only been
a pilot to us at sea, but he had been also like a broker
for us on shore; and his procuring for us the Japan
merchant was some hundreds of pounds in our pock-
ets. So we consulted together about it, and being
willing to gratify him, which was indeed but doing
him justice, and very willing also to have him with
us besides, for he was a most necessary man on all
occasions, we agreed to give him a quantity of coined
gold, which came to about one hundred and seventy-
five pounds sterling between us, and to bear his
charges, both for himself and horse, except only a
horse to carry his goods.
Having settled this among ourselves, we called
him to let him know what we had resolved. I told
him he had complained of our being like to let him
go back alone, and I was now to tell him we were
resolved he should not go back at all: that as we
had resolved to go to Europe with the caravan, we
resolved also he should go with us, and that we called
him to know his mind. He shook his head, and said
it was a long journey, and he had no money to carry
him thither, nor to subsist himself when he came
thither. We told him we believed it was so, and
therefore we had resolved to do something for him,
that should let him see how sensible we were of the
service he had done us; and then I told him what
we had resolved to give him here, which he might lay
out as we would pur own, and that for his expenses,
if he would go with us, we would set him safe ashore
either in Muscovy or England, at our own charge,
except only the carriage of his goods.
He received the proposal like a man transported,
and told us he would go with us over the whole
world; and so, in short, we all prepared ourselves
for the journey: but instead of being ready in five
weeks, it was more than four months before all things
were got together. During this time, my partner
and I disposed of all the goods we had left, and laid
in a large stock of Chinese goods, such as damasks,
fine silks, raw silks, fine calicoes, tea, nutmegs and
cloves, and a quantity of other things, amounting in
all to about four thousand pounds' worth. With these
goods we loaded eighteen camels, besides those we
rode upon, which, with two or three spare horses,
and two horses loaded with provisions, made us, in
short, twenty-six camels and horses in pur retinue.
We set out from Pekin at the beginning of Febru-
ary. The company was very great, and made between
three and four hundred horses and camels, and a
hundred and twenty men, very well armed, and pre-
pared for the bands of marauding Tartars, if any of
them should attack us. The company consisted of
several nations, such as Muscovites, Livonians, &C. ;
and, to our satisfaction, there were five Scotchmen,
who appeared to be men of great experience in busi-
ness, and of very good substance.
When we had travelled one day's journey, the
guides, who were five in number, called us all toge-
ther, except the servants, to a great council, at which
every one deposited a certain quantity of money to a
common stock, for the necessary expense of buying
forage on the way, where it was not otherwise to be
had, and for satisfying the guides, getting horses,
and the like. And here they appointed captains and
officers to draw us all up, and give the command in
case of attack: which we found needful upon the way.
The road on all this side of the country is very
populous, and is full of potters and earth-makers,
that is to say, people that tempered the earth for the
China ware; and, as I was going along, our Portu-
guese pilot, who had always something or other to
say to make us merry, came sneering to me, and told
me he would show us the greatest rarity in all the
country, and that I should have this to say of China,
after all the ill-humoured things I had said of it, that
I had seen one thing which was not to be seen in all
the world beside. I was very importunate to know
what it was: at last, he told me it was a gentleman's
house built with China ware. "Well," said 1, " are
not the materials of their buildings the product of
their own country? and so it is all China ware, is it
not ?"—" No, no," says he, " I mean it is a house all
made of China ware- such as you call so in England,
or, as it is called in pur country, porcelain."—" Well,"
said I, "such a thing may be. How big is it? Can
we carry it in a box upon a camel? If we can, we
will buy it."—" Upon a camel!" said the old pilot,
"why, there is a family of thirty people live in it."
I was then curious indeed to see it; and when I came
to it, I found it was a house built, as we call it in
England, with lath and plaster, bat all the plastering
was really China ware, that is to say it was plastered
with the earth that makes China ware.
The outside, which the sun shone hot upon, was
glazed, and looked very well, perfectly white, and
painted with blue figures, as the large China ware in
England is painted, and hard as if it had been burned
As to the inside, all the walls, instead of wainscot,
were lined up with hardened and painted tiles, like
the little square tiles we call galley-tiles in England,
all made of the finest China, and the figures exceed-
ingly fine indeed, with extraordinary variety of
colours, mixed with gold, many tiles making but one
figure, but joined so artificially with mortar, being
made of the same earth, that it was very hard to see
where the tiles met. The floors of the rooms were
of the same composition, and as hard as the earthen
floors we have in use in several parts of England;
the ceilings, and, in a word, all the plastering work
in the whole house, were of the same earth; and,
after all, the roof was covered with tiles of the same,
but of a deep, shining black.
This was a China warehouse indeed, truly and li-
terally to be called so; and had I not been upon the
journey, I could have stayed some days to see and
'examine the particulars of it. They told me there
were fountains and fish-ponds in the garden, all
paved at the bottom and sides with the same, and
fine statues set up in rows on the walks, entirely
formed of the porcelain earth, and turned whole.
As this is one of the singularities of China, so they
may be allowed to excel in it; but I am very sure
they excel in their accounts of it, for they told
me such incredible things of their performance
in crockery-ware, for such it is, that I care not to
relate, as knowing it could not be true. One told
me, in particular, of a workman that made a ship,
with all its tackle, and masts, and sails, in earthen-
ware, big enough to carry fifty men. If he had told
me, he launched it, and made a voyage to Japan in
it, I might have said something to it indeed; but, as
it was, I knew the whole story, which was, in short
asking pardon for the word, that the fellow lied. So
I smiled, and said nothing to it.
This odd sight kept me two hours behind the cara-
van, for which the leader of it for the day fined me
about the value of three shillings; and told me, if it
had been three days' journey without the wall, as it
was three davs within, he must have fined me four
times as much, and made me ask pardon the next
council day; so I promised to be more orderly, for
indeed I found afterwards the orders made for keep-
ing altogether were absolutely necessary for our
common safety.
In two days more we passed the great China wall,
made for a fortification against the Tartars: and a
very great work it is, going over hills and mountains
in an endless track, where the rocks are impassable, and the precipices such as no enemy could possibly
enter, or indeed climb up, or where, if they did, no
wall could hinder them. They tell us its length is
near a thousand English miles, but that the country
is five hundred in a straight measured line, which the
wall bounds, without measuring the windings and
turnings it takes: it is about four fathoms high, and
as many thick in some places.
After we had passed this mighty nothing, called
a wall, we began to find the country thinly inhabited,
and the people rather confined to live in fortified
towns aud cities, as being subject to the inroads and
depredations of the Tartars, who rob in great armies,
and therefore are not to be resisted by the naked in-
habitants of an open country.
And here I began to find the necessity of keeping
together in a caravan as we travelled; for we saw
several troops of Tartars roving about; but when I
came to see them distinctly, I wondered more that
the Chinese empire could be conquered by such con-
temptible fellows; for they are a mere herd, or crowd,
of wild fellows, keeping no order, and understanding
no discipline, or manner of fight.
Their horses are poor, lean, starved creatures,
taught nothing, and are fit for nothing; and this we
found the first day we saw them, which was after we
entered the wilder part of the country. Our leader
for the day gave leave for about sixteen of us to go
a hunting, as they call it; and what was this but
hunting of sheep! However, it may be called
hunting, too, for the creatures, are the wildest, and
swiftest of foot, that ever I saw of their kind, only
they will not run a great way: and you are sure of
sport when you begin the chase, for they appear
generally by thirty or forty in a flock, and, like true
sheep, always keep together when they fly.
In pursuit of this odd sort of game, it was our
hap to meet with about forty Tartars; whether they
were hunting mutton, as we were, or whether they
looked for another kind of prey, I know not; but as
soon as they saw us, one of them blew a kind of horn
very loud, but with a barbarous sound that I had
never heard before, and, by the way, never care to
hear again. We all supposed this was to call their
friends about them; and so it was, for in less than
a quarter of an hour a troop of forty or fifty more
appeared, at about a mile distance: but our work
was over first, as it happened.
One of the Scotch merchants of Moscow happened
to be amongst us; and as soon as he heard the horn,
he told us, in short, that we had nothing to do but to
charge them immediately, without loss of time, and,
drawing us up in a line, he asked if we were resolved?
We told him we were ready to follow him. They
stood gazing at us like a mere crowd, drawn up in no
order; but as soon as they saw us advance, they let
fly their arrows, which, however, missed us very hap-
pily. It seems they mistook not their aim, but their
distance, for their arrows all fell a little short of us,
but with so true an aim, that, had we been about
twenty yards nearer, we must have had several men
wounded, if not killed.
Immediately we halted; and, though it was at a
great distance, we fired, and sent them leaden bullets
for wooden arrows, following our shot full gallop,
resolving to fall in among them sword in hand, for so
our bold Scot that led us directed. He was, indeed,
but a merchant, but he behaved with that vigour and
bravery on this occasion, and yet with such a cool
courage, too, that I never saw any man better
fitted for his command. As soon as we came up to
them, we fired our pistols.in their faces, and then
drew; but they fled in the greatest confusion ima-
ginable; the only stand any of them made was on
our right, where three of them stood, and by signs
called the rest to come back to them, having'a kind of scimitar in their hands, and their bows hanging to
their backs. Our brave commander, without asking
any one to follow him, galloped up close to them, and
with his fusil knocked one of them off his horse, killed
the second with his pistol, and the third ran away: and
thus ended our fight. But we had this misfortune at-
tending it, viz. that all our mutton that we had in
chase got away. We had not a man killed or hurt;
but as for the Tartars, there were five of them killed,
how many were wounded we knew not ; but this we
know, that the other party were so frightened with
the noise of our guns, that they fled, and never made
any attempt upon us.
We were all this while in the Chinese dominion,
and therefore the Tartars were not so bold as after-
wards; but in about five days we entered a wild desert,
which held us three days and nights march, and we
were obliged to carry our water with us in great
leather bottles, and to encamp all night, just"as I
have heard they do in the deserts of Arabia.
In passing this wilderness, which, I confess, was at
the first view very frightful to me, we saw, two or
three times, little parties of the Tartars, but they
seemed to be upon their own affairs, and to have no
design upon us.
We travelled near a month after this, the wavs
being not so good at first, though still in the domi-
nions of the Emperor of China, but lay, for the most
part, in villages, some of which were fortified because
of the incursions of the Tartars. When we came to
one of these towns (it was about two days and a half's
journey before we were to come to the city of Naum),
I wanted to buy a camel, of which there are plenty
to be sold all the way upon that road, and of horses
also, such as they are, because of so many caravans
coming that way, they are very often wanted. The
person that I spoke to get me a camel would have
gone and fetched it for me, but I, like a fool, must be
officious, and go myself along with him. The place
was about two miles out of the village, where they
kept the camels and horses feeding under a guard.
I walked it on foot, with my old pilot in company,
and a Chinese, being very desirous, forsooth, of'a
little variety. When we came to this place, it was a
low, marshy ground, walled round with a stone wall
piled up dry, without mortar or earth among it, like a
park, with a little guard of Chinese soldiers at the
door. Having bought a camel, and agreed for the
price, I came away, and the Chinese man that was
with me led the camel, when on a sudden came up
five Tartars on horseback, two of them seized the
fellow, and took the camel from him, while the other
three stepped up to me and my old pilot, seeing us,
as it were, unarmed, for I had no weapon about me
but my sword, which could but ill defend me against
three horsemen. The first that came up stopped
short upon my drawing my sword (for they are arrant
cowards), but a second coming up on my left, gave me a blow on the head, which I never felt till after-
wards, and wondered, when I came to myself, what
was the matter with me, and where I was, for he laid
me flat on the ground; but my never-failing: old pilot,
the Portuguese (BO Providence, unlocked for, directs
deliverances from dangers, which to us are unfore-
seen), had a pistol in his pocket, which I knew
nothing of, nor the Tartars neither, if they had, I
suppose they would not have attacked us. But
cowards are always boldest when there is no danger.
The old man seeing me down, with a bold heart
stepped up to the fellow that had struck me, and
laying hold of his arm with one hand, and pulling him
down by main force a little towards him with the
other, he shot him in the head, and laid him dead on
the spot: he then immediately stepped up to him
who had stopped us, as I said, and before he could
come forward again (for it was all done, as it were, in
a moment), made a blow at him with a scimitar,
which he always wore, but, missing the man,
cut his horse in the side of the head, cut one of his
ears off by the root, and a slice down the side of his
face. The poor beast, enraged with the wound, was
no more to be governed by his rider, though the fel-
low sat well enough too, but away he flew, and car-
ried him quite out of the pilot's reach, and at some
distance, rising upon his hind legs, threw down the
Tartar, and fell upon him.
In this interval the poor Chinese came in who had
lost the camel, but he had no weapon; however,
seeing the Tartar down, and his horse fallen upon him,
he runs to him, and seizing upon an ugly, ill-favoured
weapon he had by his side, something like apole-axe,
but not a pole-axe neither, he wrenched it from him,
and made shift to knock his Tartarian brains out with
it. But my old man had the third Tartar to deal with
still, and seeing he did not fly, as he expected, nor
come on to fight him, as he apprehended, but stood
stock still, the old man stood still too, and fell to
work to charge his pistol again; but as soon as
the Tartar saw the pistol, whether he supposed it
to be the same, or another, I know not, but away he
scoured, and left my pilot a complete victory.
By this time I was a little awake, and I wondered
where I was, how I came upon the ground, and what
was the matter; in a word, a few moments after, as
sense returned, I felt pain, though I did not know
where; I clapped my hand to my head, and took it
away all bloody, then I felt my head ache, and then,
in another moment, memory returned, and every
thing was present to me again. I jumped upon my
feet instantly, and got hold of my sword, but saw
no enemies. I found a Tartar lie dead, and his
horse standing very quietly by him; and looking
farther, I saw my champion and deliverer, who had
been to see what the Chinese had done, coming back
with his hanger in his hand. The old man, seeing
me on my feet, came running to me, and embraced
me with a great deal of joy, being afraid before that
I had been killed, and seeing me all bloody would see
how I was hurt; but it was not much, being only
what we call a broken head ; neither did I afterwards
find any great inconvenience from the blow.
We made no great gain, however, by this victory,
for we lost a camel and gained a horse; but that
which was remarkable, when we came back to the
village, the man demanded to be paid for the camel,
for I did not give him the money when I bought it.
I disputed it, and it was brought to a hearing before
the Chinese judge of the place, that is to say, in
English, we went before a justice of the peace. He
acted with a great deal of prudence and impartiality,
and, having heard both sides, he gravely asked the
Chinese man, that went with me to buy the camel,
whose servant he was : "I am no servant," said he,
"but went with the stranger." "At whose request?"
said the justice. "At the stranger's request," said
he. "Why then," said the justice, "you were the
stranger's servant for the time, and the camel being
delivered to his servant, it was delivered to" him, and
he must pay for it." I confess the thing was so clear,
that I had not a word to say, but paid willingly for
the camel.
The city of Naum is a frontier of the Chinese em-
pire. They call it fortified, and so it is, as fortifica-
tions go there; for this I will venture to affirm, that
all the Tartars in Karakathay, which, I believe are
some millions, could not batter down the walls with
2 D
their bows and arrows: but to call it strong, if it
were attacked with cannon, would be to make those
who understood it laugh at you. We wanted, as I have said, above two days' jour-
ney of this city, when messengers were sent express
to every part of the road, to tell all travellers and
caravans to halt till they had a guard sent to them,
for that an unusual body of Tartars, making ten thou-
sand in all, had appeared in the way, about thirty
miles beyond the city.
This was very bad news to travellers; however, it
was carefully done of the governor, and we were
very glad to hear we should have a guard. Accord-
ingly, two days after, we had two hundred soldiers
sent us from a garrison of the Chinese on our left,
and three hundred more of the city of Naum, and
with those we advanced boldly. The three hundred
soldiers from Naum marched in our front, the two
hundred in our rear, and our men on each side of our
camels, with our baggage, and the whole caravan in
our centre. In this order, and well prepared for
battle, we thought ourselves a match for the whole
ten thousand Mogul Tartars, if they had appeared;
but the next day, when they did appear, it was quite
another thing.
I t was early in the morning, when marching from
a little well situated town, called Changu, we had a
river to pass, where we were obliged to ferry, and
had the Tartars had any intelligence, then had been
the time to have attacked us, when the caravan being
over, the rear guard was behind; but they did not
appear there.
About three hours after, when we were entered
upon a desert of about fifteen or sixteen miles over,
behold, by a cloud of dust they raised, we saw an
enemy was at hand; and they were at hand indeed, for they came on upon the spur. The Chinese, our
guard in the front, who had talked so big the day
before, began to stagger, and the soldiers frequently j
looked behind them, which is a certain sign, in a
soldier, that he is just ready to run away. My old
pilot was of my mind, and being near me. he called
out "Seignior Inglese," said he, "those fellows must
be encouraged, or they will ruin us all, for if the
Tartars come on, they will never stand it." "I am
of your mind," said 1, "but what must be done?"
"Done!" said he, "let fifty of our men advance, and
flank them on each wing, and encourage them, and
they will fight like brave fellows in brave company;
but without it they will every man turn his back."
Immediately I rode up to our leader and told him,
who was exactly of our mind; and accordingly fifty
of us marched to the right wing, and fifty to the left,
and the rest made a line of reserve; and so we
marched, leaving the last two hundred men to make
another body by themselves, and to guard the camels,
only that, if need were, they should send a hundred
men to assist the last fifty.
In a word, the Tartars came on, and an innumer-
able company they were; how many we could not
tell, but ten thousand we thought was the least. A
party of them came on first, and viewed our posture,
traversing the ground in front of our line, and as we
found them within gun shot, our leader ordered two
wings to advance swiftly, and give them a salvo on
each wing with their shot, which was done: but they
went off, and I suppose went back to give an account
of the reception they were likely to meet with; and
indeed that salute clogged their stomachs, for they
immediately halted, stood awhile to consider of it,
and wheeling off to the left, they gave over the design,
and said no more to us for that time, which was very
agreeable to our circumstances, which were but very
indifferent for a battle with such a number.
Two days after this, we came to the city of Naum.
We thanked the governor for his care of us, and
collected to the value of one hundred crowns, or
thereabouts, which we gave to the soldiers sent to
2 D 2
guard us: and here we rested one day. This isa
garrison indeed, and there were nine hundred soldiers
kept here; but the reason of it was, that formerly
the Muscovite frontiers lay nearer to them than they
do now, the Muscovites having abandoned that part
of the country ((which lies west from the city, for
about two hundred miles) as desolate, and unfit for
use, and more especially, being so very remote, and
so difficult to send troops thither for its defence, for
we had yet above two thousand miles to Muscovy,
properly so called.
After this we passed several great rivers, and two
dreadful deserts, one of which we were sixteen days
passing over, and on the thirteenth of April we came
to the frontiers of the Muscovite dominions. I think
the first city, or town, or fortress, whatever it might
be called, that belonged to the czar of Muscovy, was
called Argun, being on the west side of the river
Arguna. I could not but discover infinite satisfaction
that I was now arrived in, as I called it, a Christian
country, or, at least, in a country governed by Chris-
tians ; for though the Muscovites do, in my opinion,
but just deserve the name of Christians, yet such
they pretended to be, and are very devout in their
way. It would certainly occur to any man who
travels the world as I have done, and who had any
power of reflection, to reflect what a blessing it is to
be born in a part of the world where the name of God
and of a Redeemer, is known and worshipped.
I saluted the brave Scotch merchant I mentioned
before with my first acknowledgment of this, and
taking him by the hand, I said to him, "Blessed be
God, we are once again come among Christians!"
He smiled, and answered, "Do not rejoice too soon,
countryman, these Muscovites are but an odd sort of
Christians, and but for the name of it, you may see
very little of the substance for some months farther
of our journey.
"Well," said I, "but still it is better than Pagan-
ism, and worshipping of devils." "Why, I'll tell
you," said he, " except the Russian soldiers in gar-
risons, and a few of the inhabitants of the cities upon
the road, all the rest of this country, for above a
thousand miles farther, is inhabited by the worst and
most ignorant of paglns;" and so indeed we found it.
We were now launched into the greatest piece of
solid earth, if I understand any thing of the surface
of the globe, that is to be found in any part of the
world. We had, at least, twelve hundred miles to
the sea, eastward; we had, at least, two thousand to
the bottom of the Baltic Sea, westward; and almost
three thousand miles, if we left that sea, and went on
west to the British and French channels; we had
full five thousand miles to the Indian or Persia sea,
south; and about eight hundred miles to the Frozen
Sea, north.
We now advanced from the river Arguna by easy
and moderate journeys, and were very visibly ob- .
liged to the care, the czar of Muscovy'has taken, to
have cities and towns built in as many places as it is
possible to place them, where his soldiers keep gar-
rison, something like the stationary soldiers placed
by the Romans in the remotest countries of their em-
pire, some of which, I had read, were particularly
placed in Britain, for the security of commerce, and
for the lodging of travellers, and thus it was here;
for wherever we came, though at these towns and
stations the garrisons and governors were Russians,
and professed Christians, yet the inhabitants were
mere pagans, sacrificing to idols, and worshipping the
sun, moon, and stars, or all the host of heaven.
Some instances of this we met with in the country
between Arguna, where we enter the Muscovite do-
minions, and a city of Tartars and Russians together,
called Nortzinskoy, in which the space is a continued desert or forest, which cost us twenty days to travel
over it. In a village near the last of those places I
had the curiosity to go and see their way of living,
which is most insufferable. They had, I suppose, a
great sacrifice that day, for there stood out, upon an
old stump of a tree, an idol, made of wood, frightful
as the devil, it had a head certainly not so much as
resembling any creature that the world ever saw,
ears as big as goat's horns, and*as high, eyes as big
as a crown piece, a nose like a crooked ram's horn,
and a mouth extended four cornered, like that of a
lion, with horrible teeth, hooked like a parrot's under
bill. It was dressed up in the filthiest manner that
you can suppose; its upper garment was of sheep-
skins, with the wool outward, a great Tartar bonnet
on the head, with two horns growing through it. It
was about eight feet high, yet hadno feet or legs,
or any proportion of parts. This scarecrow was set
up at the outside of the village, and when I came
near to it, there were sixteen or seventeen creatures,
whether men or women I could not tell, for they
make no distinction by their habits, either of body or
head; these lay flat on the ground, round this for-
midable block of shapeless wood. I saw no motion
among them, any more than if they had been logs
of wood, like their idol. At first, I really thought
they had been so; but when I came a little nearer,
they started up upon their feet, and raised a howl-
ing cry, as if it had been so many deep-mouthed
hounds, and walked away as if they were displeased
at our disturbing them. A little way off from this
monster, and at the door of a tent, or hivt, made all
of sheep-skins and cow-skins dried, stood three
butchers. I thought they were such; for when I
came nearer to them, I found they had long knives
in their hands, and in the middle of the tent appeared
three sheep killed, and one young bullock, or steer.
These, it seems, were sacrifices to that senseless log
of an idol, and these three men priests, belonging to
it; and the seventeen prostrated wretches were the
people who brought the offering, and were making
their prayers to that stock.
I confess I was more moved at their stupidity, and
this brutish worship of a hobgoblin, than ever I was
at any thing in my life; to see God's most glorious
and best creature, to whom he had granted so many
advantages, even by creation, above the rest of the
works of his hands,*vested with a reasonable soul,
and that soul adorned with faculties and capabilities
adapted both to honour his Maker, and be honoured
by him; I say, to see it sunk and degenerated to a de-
gree so stupid, as to prostrate itself before a frightful
nothing, a mere imaginary object, dressed up by them-
selves, and made terrible to themselves by their own
contrivance, adorned only with clouts and rags, and that this should be the effect of mere ignorance,
wrought up into hellish devotion by the devil himself,
who, envying to his Maker the homage and adoration
of his creatures, had deluded them into such gross
surfeiting, sordid, and brutish things, as one would
think should shock nature itself.
In my rage, I rode up to the monster, and with my
sword cut the bonnet that was on its head in two in
the middle, so that it hung down by one of the
horns; and one of our men that was with me took
hold of the sheep-skin that covered it, and pulled
at it, when, behold, a most hideous outcry and
howling ran through the village, and two or' three
hundred people came about my ears, so that I was
glad to scour for it, for we saw some had bows and
arrows: but I resolved to visit them again.
Our caravan rested three nights at the town, which
was about four miles off, in order to provide some
horses which they wanted, several of the horses
having been lamed and jaded with the badness of
the way, and our long march over the last desert;
so we had some leisure here to put my plan in ex-
ecution. I communicated my design to the Scotch
merchant of Moscow, of whose courage I had had
sufficient testimony. I told him what I had seen,
and with what indignation 1 had since thought that
human nature had been so degenerate. I told him I
was resolved, if I could but get four or five men, well
armed, to go with me, to destroy that vile, abomina-
ble idol, to let them see that it had no power to help
itself. and consequently could not be an object of
worship, or to be prayed to, much less help them
that offered sacrifices to it.
I n a word, finding me resolute, he liked the design,
and told me I should not go alone, but he would go
with me ; but he would go first, and bring a stout
fellow, one of his countrymen, to go also with us.
So he brought me his comrade, a Scotchman, whom
he called Captain Richardson, and I gave him a full
account of what I had seen, and also of what I in-
tended, and he told me readily he would go with me,
if it cost him his life. So we three agreed to go,
with my man servant. I had indeed proposed it to
my partner but he declined it; saying he was ready
to assist me to the utmost, and upon all occasions,
for my defence, but that this was an adventure quite
out of his way.
The Scotch merchant brought me a Tartar robe,
or gown of sheep-skins, and a bonnet, with a bow
and arrows, and had provided the same for himself
and his countryman, that the people, if they saw us,
should not be able to determine who we were. All
that night we spent in mixing up some combustible
matter with aquavitse, gunpowder, and such other
materials as we could get; and, having a good quan-
tity of tar in a little pot, the next night we set out
upon our expedition.
We came to the place about eleven o'clock at
night, and found that the people had not the least
jealousy of danger attending their idol. The night
was cloudy, yet the moon gave us light enough to
see that the idol stood just in the same posture and
place it did before. The people seemed to be at rest,
only that in the great hut, or tent, as we called it,
where he saw the three priests, whom we mistook
for butchers, we saw a light; and, going up close to
the door, we heard people talking, as if there were
five or six of them. We concluded, therefore, that
if we set wild-fire to the idol, these men would come
out immediately, and run up to the place to rescue it
from the destruction we intended for it; and what to
do with them we knew not; once we thought of car-
rying it away, and setting fire to it at a distance, but
when we came to handle it, we found it too bulky
for our carriage, so we were at a loss again. The
second Scotchman was for setting fire to the tent, or
hut, and knocking the creatures that were there on
the head when they came out; but I could not join
with that; I was against killing them, if it was pos-
sible to be avoided. "Well, then," said the Scotch
merchant, I'll tell you what we will do: we will try
to take them prisoners, tie their hands, and make
them stand still and see their idol destroyed."
As it happened, we had twine or packthread
enough about us, which we used to tie our fire-works
together with, so we resolved to attack these people
first, and with as little noise as we could. The first
thing we did, we knocked at the door; when one of
the priests coming to the door, we immediately seized
upon him, stopped his mouth, and tied his hands be-
hind him, and led him to the idol, where we gagged
him, that he might not make a noise; we tied his
feet also together, and left him on the ground. Two of us then waited at the door, expecting that
another would come out to see what the matter was;
but we waited so long, and nobody coming out, we
knocked again gently, and immediately out came
two more, and we served them just in the same man-
ner; when, going back, we found two more were
come out to the door, and a third stood behind them
within the door. We seized the two, and immediately tied them, when the third stepping back, and crying
out, the Scotch merchant went in after him, and
taking out a composition we had made, that would
only smoke and stink, he set fire to it, and threw it
in among them. By that time the other Scotchman,
and my man, taking charge of the two men already
bound, and tied together by the arm, led them away
to the idol, and left them there, making haste back
to us. When the fuze we had thrown in had filled
the hut with so much smoke that they were almost
suffocated, we threw in a small leather bag of another
kind, which flamed like a candle, and, following it in,
we found there were but four people left, who, it
seems, were two women and two men, and, as we
supposed, had been about some of their diabolical
sacrifices.
We took them, bound them as we had the others,
and all without any noise. When we had done this,
we carried them all together to the idol. When we
came there, we fell to work with him: and, first, we
daubed him all over, and his robes also, with tar, and
such other stuff as we had, which was tallow mixed
with brimstone; then we stopped his eyes, and ears,
and mouth, full of gunpowder; then we wrapped up
a great piece of wildfire in his bonnet; and then,
sticking all the combustibles we had brought with
us upon him, we looked about to see if we could find
any thing else to help to burn him, when my man
remembered that by the tent, or hut, where the men
were, there lay a heap of dry forage, whether straw
or rushes I do not remember: away he and one of
the Scotchmen ran, and fetched their arms full of
that. When we had done this, we took all our pri-
soners, and brought them, having untied their feet,
and ungagged their mouths, and made them stand
up, and set them just before their monstrous idol, and
then set fire to the whole. We stayed by it a quarter
of an hour, or thereabouts, till the powder in the
eyes, and mouth, and ears of the idol blew up, and,
as we could perceive, had split and deformed the
shape of it; and, in a word, till we saw it burn into
a mere block or log of wood, and then setting the
dry forage to it, we found it would soon be quite
consumed, so we began to think of going away; but
the Scotchman said, " No, we must not go: for these
poor deluded wretches will all throw themselves into
the fire, and burn themselves with the idol." So we
resolved to stay till all the forage was burned down
too, and then we came away, and left them.
In the morning we appeared among our fellow-
travellers, exceeding busy in getting ready for our
journey, nor could any man suggest that we had been
any where bat in our beds, as travellers might be
supposed to be, to fit themselves for the fatigue of
that day's journey.
But it did not end so; for the next day came a
great multitude of the country people, not only of
this village, but of a hundred more, for aught I know,
to the town gates, and, in a most outrageous manner,
demanded satisfaction of the Russian governor, for
the insulting their priests, and burning their great
Cham-Chi-Thaungu, such a hard name they gave
the monstrous creature they worshipped. The people
of Nortzinskoy were at first in a great consternation,
for they said the Tartars were no less than thirty
thousand, and that, in a few days more, they would
be one hundred thousand strong.
The Russian governor sent out messengers to ap-
pease them, and gave them all the good words ima-
ginable. He assured them he knew nothing of it,
and that there had not a soul in his garrison been
abroad; that it could not be from any body there;
and if they would let him know who it was, they
should be exemplatily punished. They returned
haughtily, that all the country reverenced the great
Cham-Chi-Thaungn, who dwelt in the sun, and no
mortal would have dared to offer violence to his
image but some Christian miscreants, so they called
them; and they therefore denounced war against
him and all the Russians, who, they said, were mis-
creants and Christians. The governor gave them
still all the good words he could: at last he told
them there was a caravan gone towards Russia that
morning, and, perhaps, it was some of them who had
done them this injury, and if they would be satisfied
with that, he would send after them to inquire into
it. This seemed to appease them a little, and accord-
ingly the governor sent after ns, and gave us a par-
ticular account how the thingwas, intimating withal,
that if any of our caravan had done it, they should
make their escape: but that, whether they had done
it or no, we should make all the haste forward that
was possible; and that, in the mean time, he would
keep them in play as long as he could.
This was very friendly in the governor. So the
captain of the caravan pushed us on for two days and
two nights, without any considerable stop, and then
we lay at a village called Plothus; nor did we make
any long stop here, but hastened on towards Jara-
wena, another of the Czar of Muscovy's colonies, and
where we expected we should be safe.
It was the second day's march from Plothus, that,
by the clouds of dust behind us, at a great distance,
some of our people began to be sensible that we were
pursued. We had entered another desert, and had
passed by a great lake, called Schaks Oser, when we
perceived a very great body of horse appear on the
other side of the lake to the north, we travelling
west. We observed they went away west as we did,
but had supposed we would have taken that side of
the lake, whereas we very happily took the south
side; and, in two days more, we saw them not, for
they, believing we were still before them, pushed on
till they came to the river when it passes farther
north; but where we came to it, we found it narrow
and fordable.
The third day they either found their mistake, or
had intelligence of us, and came pouring in upon us
towards the dusk of evening. We had, to our great
satisfaction, just pitched upon a place for our camp,
which was very convenient for the night; for as we
were upon a desert, though but at the beg inn ing of
it, that was above five hundred miles over, we had
no towns to lodge at, and indeed expected none but
the city of Jarawena, which we had yet two days'
march to. The desert, however, had some few woods
in it on this side, and little rivers, which ran all into
the great river Udda. It was in a narrow strait, be-
tween two small, but very thick woods, that we
pitched our little camp for that night, expecting to
be attacked in the night. We took care to make our
front as strong as we could, by placing our packs,
and our camels and horses, all in a line on the inside
of the river, and we felled some trees in our rear.
The enemy was upon us before we had finished our
situation. They did not come on us like thieves, as
we expected, but sent three messengers to us, to de-
mand the men to be delivered to them that had
abused their priests, and burned their god Cham-
Chi-Thaungu, that they might burn them with fire:
and upon this, they said, they would go away, and
do us no further harm, otherwise they would burn us
all with fire. No one knew any thing of what they
accused us, except me and my accomplices, but we
kept our secret. The leader of the caravan sent
word he was well assured it was not done by any of
our camp; that we were peaceable merchants, tra-
velling on our business; that we had done no harm
to them, or to any one else; and that therefore they
must look farther for their enemies who had injured
them, for we were not the people; so he desired
them not to disturb us, for if they did, we should
defend ourselves. They were far from being satis-
fled with this, and a great crowd of them came
down in the morning; and, after looking at us
for a while, they set up a great howl, and let fly
a cloud of arrows at us; but we were too well forti-
fied for them to do any mischief; and I do not
remember that one man of us was hurt.
Some time after this, we saw them move a little to
our right, and expected them on the rear; when a
cunning fellow, a Cossack, of Jarawena, in the pay
of the Muscovites, calling to the leader of the cara-
van, said to him, " I'll go send all these people away
to Sibeilka." This was a city four or five days'
journey, at least. to the south, and rather behind us.
So he takes his bow and arrows, and getting on
horseback, he rides away from our rear directly, as
it were, back to Nortzinskoy: after this, he takes a
great circuit about, and comes to the army of the
Tartars, as if he had been sent express to tell them a
long story, that the people who had burned their
Oham-Chi-Thaungu were gone to Sibeilka, with a
caravan of miscreants, as he called them, that is to
say, Christians; and that they were resolved to burn
the god Schal-Isar, belonging to the Tongueses.
As this fellow was a mere Tartar, and spoke their
language, they believed all he said: away they drove
off in a great* hurry to Sibeilka; and, in less than
three hours, they were entirely out of sight. So we
passed safely on to the city of Jarawena, where
there was a garrison of Muscovites; and there we
rested five days, the caravan being exceedingly
fatigued with the last day's march, and with want
of rest in the night.
From this city we had a frightful desert, which
was twenty-three days' march. We furnished our-
selves with some tents here, for the better accommo-
dating us in the night; and the leader of the caravan
procured sixteen carriages, or waggons, of the coun-
try, for carrying our water and provisions; and these
carriages were our defence every night round our
little camp; so that had the Tartars appeared, unless
they had been very numerous indeed, they would not
have been able to hurt us. In this desert we saw
neither house nor tree, nor scarce a bush, We saw,
indeed, abundance of sable hunters; these are all
Tartars, of the Mogul Tartary, of which this country
is a part, and they frequently attack small caravans;
but we saw no numbers of them together.
After we were out of this desert, and had travelled
two days, we came to Janezay, a Muscovite city or
station, on the great river Janezay. This river, they
told us, parted Europe from Asia, though our ^map-
makers, as I am told, do not agree to it. However,
it is certainly the eastern boundary of the ancient
Siberia, which now makes a province only of the vast
Muscovite empire, but is itself equal in bigness to the
whole empire of Germany. And yet here I observed
ignorance and paganism still prevailed, except
in the Muscovite garrisons. The whole country
between the river Oby and the river Janezay
is as entirely pagan, and the people as barbarous, «s
the remotest of the Tartars; nay, as any nation, for
aught I know, in Asia or America. I also found,
which I observed to the Muscovite governors whom
I had opportunity to converse with, that the pagans
are not much the wiser, or the nearer Christianity,
for being under the Muscovite government; which
they acknowledged was true enough; but they said
it was none of their business: that if the czar ex-
pected to convert his Siberian, or Tonguese, or Tartar
subjects, it should be done by sending clergymen
among them not soldiers; and they added, with more
sincerity than I expected, that they found it was not
so much the concern of their monarch to make the
people Christians, as it was to make them subjects.
From this river to the great river Oby we crossed
a wild, uncultivated country; I cannot say it is a
barren soil; it is only barren of people and good
management. What inhabitants we found in it were
all pagans, except such as are sent among them from
Russia; for this is the country, on both sides the
river Oby, whither the Muscovite criminals that are
not put to death are banished, and from whence it is
next to impossible they should ever come away.
We now came to Tobolsk!, the capital city of
Siberia. Having been seven months on our journey,
and winter coming on apace, my partner and I called
a council about our particular affairs, in which we
found it proper, considering that we were bound for
England, and not for Moscow, to consider how to
dispose of ourselves. They told us of sledges and
rein-deer to carry us over the snow in winter time,
by which means the Russians travel more in the
winter than they can in summer; because in these
sledges they are able to run night and day; the snow,
being frozen, is one universal covering to nature, by
which the hills and vales, the rivers and lakes, are
all smooth and hard as a stone; and they run upon
the surface, without any regard to what is underneath.
But I had no occasion to push at a winter journey of
this kind; I was bound to England, not to Moscow,
and my route lay two ways: either I must go on as
the caravan went, till I came to Jeroslow, and then
go either by sea or land to Dantzic, where I might
probably sell my China goods to good advantage; or
I must leave the caravan at a little town on the
Dwina, from whence I had but six days by water to
Archangel, and from thence might be sure of shipping,
either to England, Holland, or Hamburgh.
Now to go any of those journies in the winter
would have been preposterous; for, as to Dantzic,
the Baltic would be frozen up, and I could not get
rsage; and to go up by land in those countries was
less safe than among the Mogul Tartars: like-
wise to go to Archangel in October, all the ships
would be gone from thence, and even the merchants,
who dwell there in summer retire south to Moscow
in the winter, when the ships are gone; so that I should have nothing but extremity of cold to en-
counter, with a scarcity of provisions, and must lie
there in'an empty town "all the winter. So that, upon
the whole, I thought it much my better way to let
the caravan go, and to make provision to winter
where I was, viz. at Tobolsk!, in Siberia, in the lati-
tude of sixty degrees, where I was sure of three
things to wear out a cold winter with, viz. plenty of
provision, such as the country afforded, a warm
house, with fuel enough, and excellent company.
I was now in a quite different climate from my
beloved island, where I never felt cold, except when
I had my ague; on the contrary, I had much to do
to bear any clothes on my back, and never made any
fire but without doors, and for my necessity in dress-
ing my food, &c. Now 1 made me three good vests,
with large robes or gowns over them to hang down to
the feet, and button close to the wrists, and all these
lined with furs to make them sufficiently warm.
As to a warm house, I must confess I greatly dis-
like our way in England of making fires in every
room in the house, in open chimneys, which, when
the fire was out, always kept the air in the room cold
as the climate. But taking an apartment in a good
house in the town, I ordered a chimney to be built,
like a furnace, in the centre of six several rooms, like
a stove, the funnel to carry the smoke went up one
way, the door to come at the fire went in another,
and all the rooms were kept equally warm, but no
fire seen, just as they heat the bagnios in England.
By this means we had always the same climate in
all the rooms, and an equal heat was preserved; and
how cold soever it was without, it was always warm
within; and yet we saw no fire, nor were ever incom-
moded with any smol e.
The most wonderful thing of all was, that it should
be possible to meet with good company here, in a
country so barbarous as that of the most northerly
parts of Europe, near the frozen ocean, and within
but a very few degrees of Nova Zembla. But this
being the country where the state criminals of Mus-
covy, as I observed before, are all banished, this city
was full of noblemen, princes, gentlemen, colonels, and,
in short, all degrees of the nobility, gentry, soldiers and courtiers of Muscovy. Here were the famous
tm
434 ROBINSON CRUSOE.prince Galilof ken, or Galoffken, and his son ; the old
general Robostisky, and several other persons of note,
and some ladies.
By means of my Scotch merchant, whom, never-
theless, I parted with here, I made an acquaintance
with several of these gentlemen, and some of them of
the first rank, among whom was a certain prince,
one of the banished ministers of state belonging to
the czar of Muscovy. I have not room to give a full
account of the most agreeable conversation I had
with this last mentioned truly great man; in all
which he showed that his mind was so inspired with
a superior knowledge of things, so supported by re-
ligion, as well as by a vast share of wisdom, that his
contempt of the world was really as much as he could
express, and he was always the same to the last, as
will appear in the story I am going to tell.
I had been here eight months, and a dark, dreadful
winter I thought it to be; the cold was so intense,
that I could not so much as look abroad without
being wrapped in furs, and a mask of fur before my face, or rather a hood, with only a hole for breath,
and two for sight. The little daylight we had was,
as we reckoned, for three months, not above five
hours a day, and six at most, only that the snow
lying on the ground continually, and the weather
clear, it was never quite dark. Our horses were kept
(or rather starved) under ground; and, as for our
servants (for we hired servants here to look after our
horses and ourselves), we had now and then their
fingers and toes to thaw and take care of, lest they
should mortify, and fall off.
It is true, within doors, we were warm, the houses
being close, the walls thick, the lights small, and the
glass all double. Our food was chiefly the flesh of
deer, dried and cured in the season; good bread
enough, but baked as biscuits; dried fish, of several
sorts, and some flesh of mutton, and of the buffaloes,
which is a pretty good beef. All the stores of pro-
vision for the winter are laid up in the summer, and
well cured. Our drink was water, mixed with aqua-
vitae, instead of brandy; and, for a treat, mead in-
stead of wine, which, however, they have excellent
good. The hunters, who venture abroad all weathers,
frequently brought us in fresh venison, very fat and
good; and sometimes bears' flesh, but we did not
much care for the last. We had a good stock of tea,
with which we treated our friends; and, we lived very
cheerfully and well, all things considered.
It was now March, and the days grown consider
bly longer, and the weather at least tolerable; so the
other travellers began to prepare sledges to carry them
over the snow, and to get things ready to be going;
but my measures being fixed, as I have said, for Ar-
changel, and not for Muscovy or the Baltic, I made
no motion, knowing very well that the ships from the
south do not set out for that part of the world till
May or June, and that if I was there by the begin-
ning of August, it would be as soon as any ships
would be ready to go away; and, therefore, I say, I made no haste to be gone, as others did; in a word,
I saw a great many people, nay, all the travellers,' go
away before me. It seems every year they go from
thence to Moscow for trade, viz. to carry furs, and
buy necessaries with them, which they bring back to
furnish their ships: also others went on the same
errand to Archangel, but then they also, being to
come back again above eight hundred miles, went
all out before me.
In short about the latter end of May I began to
make all ready to pack up; and as I was doing this,
it occurred to me, that seeing all those people were
banished by the czar of Muscovy to Siberia, and yet
when they came there, were left at liberty to go
whither they would, why did they not then go away
to any part of the world, wherever they thought fit;
and I began to examine what should hinder them
from making such an attempt.
2 E 2
But my wonder was over when I entered upon that
subject with the person I have mentioned, who an-
swered me thus:—" Consider first, sir," said he," the
place where we are; and, secondly, the condition we
are in, especially," said he, "the generality of the
people who are banished hither. We are surrounded,"
said he, " with stronger things than bars and bolts:
on the north side is an unnavigable ocean, where ship
never sailed, and boat never swam; neither, if we
had both, could we know whither to go with them.
Every other way," said he, " we have above one
thousand miles to pass through the czar's own do-
minions, and by ways utterly impassable, except by
the roads made by the government, and through the
towns garrisoned by its troops; so that we could
neither pass undiscovered by the road, nor subsist
any other way, so that it is in vain to attempt it."
I was silenced indeed at once, and found that they
were in a prism, every jot as secure as if they had
been locked up in the castle of Moscow. However,
it came into my thoughts that I might certainly be
made an instrument to procure the escape of this ex-
cellent person, and that it was very easy for me to
carry him away, there being no guard over him in
the country; and as I was not going to Moscow, but
to Archangel, and that I went in the nature of a ca-
ravan, by which I was not obliged to lie in the sta-
tionary towns in the desert, but could encamp every
night where I would, we might easily pass uninter-
rupted to Archangel, where I would immediately
secure him on board an English or Dutch ship, and
carry him off along with me; and, as to his sub-
sistence, and other particulars, that should be my
care, till he could better supply himself.
He heard me very attentively, and looked earnestly
on me all the while I spoke; nay, I could see in his
very face that what I said put his spirits into an ex-
ceeding ferment: his colour frequently changed, his
eyes looked red, and his heart fluttered, that it might
be even pereeived in his countenance; nor could he
immediately answer me, when I had done, and, as it
were, expecting what he would say to it, and after he
had paused a little he embraced me, and said, " How
unhappy are we, unguided creatures as we are, that
even our greatest acts of friendship are made snares
to us, and we are made the tempters of-one another!
My dear friend," said he, " your offer is so sincere, has such kindness in it, is so disinterested in itself,
and is so calculated for my advantage, that I must
have very little knowledge of the world if I did not
both wonder at it, and acknowledge the obligation I
have upon me to you for it. But did you believe I was sincere in what I have so often said to you of my
contempt of the world? Did you believe I spoke my
very soul to you, and that I had really attained that
degree of felicity here that had placed me above all
that the world could give me, or do for me? Did
you believe I was sincere when I Ibid you I would
not go back, if I was recalled, even to be all that
once I was in the court, and with the favour of the
czar my master? Did you believe me, my friend, to
be an honest man, or did you think me to be a boast-
ing hypocrite?" Here he stopped, as if he would
hear what I would say ; but indeed I soon after per-
ceived that he stopped because his spirits were in
motion, his heart was full of struggles, and he could
not go on. I was, I confess, astonished at the thing,
as well as the man, and I used some arguments with
him to urge him to set himself free; that he ought
to look upon this as a door opened by Heaven for his deliverance, and a summons by Providence, who has
the care and good disposition of all events, to do him-
self good, and to render himself useful in the world.
He had by this time recovered himself. "How do
you know, sir," said he, warmly, "but that, instead
of a summons from Heaven, it may be a feint of
another instrument, representing in all the alluring
colours to me, the show of felicity as a deliverance,
which may in itself be my snare, and tend directly
to my ruin? Here I am, free from the temptation
of returning to my former miserable greatness; there
I am not sure but that all the seeds of pride, am-
bition, avarice, and luxury, which I know remain in
nature, may revive and take root, and, in a word,
again overwhelm me, and then the happy prisoner,
whom you see now master of his soul's liberty, shall
be the miserable slave of his own senses, enjoying
all personal liberty. Dear sir, let me remain in
this blessed confinement, banished from the crimes
of this life, rather than purchase a show of freedom
at the expense of the liberty of my reason, and at the
expense of the future happiness which I now have in
view, but shall then, I fear, quickly lose sight of; for
I am but flesh, a man, a mere man: have passions
and affections as likely to possess and overthrow me
as any man. O be not my friend, and my tempter
both together If I was surprised before, I was quite dumb now,
and stood silent looking at him, and indeed admired
what I saw: the struggle in his soul was so great,
that, though the weather was extremely cold, it put
him into a most violent sweat, and I found he wanted
to give vent to his mind; so I said a word or two,
that I would leave him to consider of it, and wait on
him again, and then I withdrew to my apartment.
About two hours after, I heard somebody at, or
near, the door of my room, and I was going to open
the door; hut he had opened it and came in. "My
dear friend," said he, "you had almost overset me,
but I am recovered. Do not take it ill that I do not
close with your offer. I assure you it is not for want
of a sense of the kindness of it in you, and I came to
make the most sincere acknowledgment of it to you;
but I hope I have got the victory over myself."
"My lord," said 1, " I hope you are fully satisfied
that you do ilot resist the call of Heaven."—" Sir,"
said he, " if it had been from Heaven, the same power
would have influenced me to accept it; but I hope,
and am fully satisfied, that it is from Heaven that I
decline it; and I have an infinite satisfaction in the
parting, that you shall leave me an honest man still,
though not a free man." I had nothing to do but to
acquiesce, and make professions to him of my having
no end in it, but a sincere desire to serve him. He
embraced me very passionately, and assured me he
was sensible of that, and should always acknowledge
it ; and with that he offered me a very fine present
of sables, too much indeed for me to accept from a
man in his circumstances, and I would have avoided
them, but he would not be refused.
The next morning I sent my servant to his lord-
ship, with a small present of tea, two pieces of China
damask, and four little wedges of Japan gold, which
did not weigh above six ounces; but were far short
of the value of his sables, which indeed, when I came
to England, I found worth near two hundred pounds.
He accepted the tea, and one piece of the damask,
and one of the pieces of gold, which had a fine stamp
upon it, of the Japan coinage, which I found he took
for the rarity of it, but would not take any more;
and he sent word, by my servant, that he desired to
speak with me.
When I came to him, he told me I knew what had
passed between us, and hoped I would not move him
any more in that affair; but that since I had made
such a generous offer to him, he asked me if I had
kindness enough to offer the same to another person
that he would name to me, in whom he had a great
share of concern. I told him that I could not say I
inclined to do so much for any one but himself, for
whom I had a particular value, and should have been
glad to have been the instrument of his deliverance.
However, if he would please to name the person to
me, I would fpve him my answer, and hoped he
would not be displeased with me, if he was with my
answer. He told me it was his only son, who, though
I had not seen him, yet was in the same condition
with himself, and above two hundred miles from him,
on the other side the Oby; but that, if I consented,
he would send for him. I made no hesitation, but
told him I would do it. So he sent away the next
day for his son, and in about twenty days he same
back with the messenger, bringing six or seven
horses loaded with very rich furs, and which in the
whole amounted to a very great value.
His servants brought the horses into the town, but
left the young lord at a distance till night, when he
came incognito into our apartment, aijd his father
presented him to me; and, in short, we concerted
there the manner of our travelling, and every thing
proper for the journey. I had bought a considerable
quantity of sables, black fox-skins, fine ermines, and
such other furs that are very rich, in exchange for
some of the goods I had brought from China: in par-
ticular, for the cloves and nutmegs, of which I sold
the greatest part here, and the rest afterwards at
Archangel, for a much better price than I could have
got at London.
It was the beginning of June when I left this re-
mote place; a city, I believe, little heard of in the
world, and indeed it is so far out of the road of com-
merce, that I know not how it should be much talked
of. We were now a very small caravan, being only
thirty horses and camels in all; and all of them passed for mine, though my new guest was proprietor
of eleven of them. If was most natural, also, that I
should take more servants with me than I had before,
and the young lord passsed for my steward; what
great man 1 passed for myself, I know not, neither
did it concern me to inquire. We had here the worst
and largest desert to pass over that we had met with
in all the journey, indeed I call it the worst, because
the way was deep in some places, and very uneven
in others; the best we had to say for it was, that we
thought we had no troops of Tartars and robbers to
fear, and that they never came on this side of the
river Oby, or, at least, but very seldom; but we
found it otherwise.
My young lord had with him a faithful Muscovite
servant, or rather a Siberian servant, who was per-
fectly acquainted with the country, and who led ns
by private roads, so that we avoided coming into the
principal towns and cities, upon the great road, such
as Tumen, Soloy-Kamaskoy, and several others, be-
cause the Muscovite garrisons which are kept there
are very curious and strict in their observation upon
travellers, and searching lest any of the banished
persons of note should make their escape that way
into Muscovy; but by this means, as we were kept
out of the cities, so our whole journey was a desert,
and we were obliged to encamp, and lie in our tents,
when we might have had very good accommodation
in the cities on the way. This the young lord was so
sensible of, that he would not allow us to lie abroad
when we came to several cities on the way, but lay
abroad himself with his servant in the woods, and
met us always at the appointed places.
We were just entered Europe, having passed the
river Kama, which, in these parts, is the boundary
between Europe and Asia; and the first city, on the
European side, was Soloy-Kamaskoy, which is as
much as to say, the great city on the river Kama;
and here we thought to have seen some evident
alteration in the people, their manners, their habits,
religion, and their business; but we were mistaken,
for as we had a vast desert to pass, which, by report,
is near seven hundred miles long in some places, but
not above two hundred miles over where we passed
it; so, till we came past that horrible place, we found
very little difference between that country and the
Mogul Tartars, and the people mostly pagans, and
little better than the savages of America; their
houses and towns full of idols, and their way of living
wholly barbarous, except in the cities, as above, and
the villages near them, where they are Christians, as
they call themselves, of the Greek Church; but even
these have their religion mingled with so many relics
of superstition, that it is scarce to be known, in some
places, from mere sorcery and witchcraft.
In passing this forest, I thought indeed we should
have been robbed, and perhaps murdered, by a troop
of thieves; of what country they were, whether the
roving bands of the Ostiachy, a kind of Tartars, or
wild people on the bank of the Oby, and ranged thus
far, or whether they were the sable-hunters of Sibe-
ria, I am yet at a loss to know; but they were all on
horseback, carried bows and arrows, and were at
first about forty-five in number; they came so near
to us as within about two musket-shot, and, asking
no questions, they surrounded us with their horses,
and looked very earnestly upon us twice. At length
they placed themselves in our way, when we drew up
a little line before our camels, being not above sixteen
men in all; and sent out the Siberian servant, who
attended his lord, to see who they were. His master
was the more willing to let him go, because he was
not a little apprehensive that they were a Siberian
troop sent out after him. The man came up near
them, with a flag of truce, and called to them, but
though he spoke several of their languages, or dialects
of languages rather, he could not understand a word
they said. However, after some signs to him not to
come nearer them at his peril (so he said he under-
stood them to mean), offering to shoot at him if he
advanced, the fellow came back no wiser than he
went, only that by their dress, he said he believed
them to be some Tartars of Kalmuck, or of the Cir-
cassian hordes, and that there must be more of them
on the great desert, though he never heard that ever
any of them were seen so far north before.
This was small comfort to us. However, we had
no remedy. There was, on our left hand, at about a
quarter of a mile's distance, a little grove or clump of
trees, which stood close together, 'and very near the
road. I immediately resolved we would advance to
those trees, and fortify ourselves as well as we could
there; for first, I considered that the trees would,
in a great measure, cover us from their arrows, and,
in the next place, they could not come to charge us
in a body. It was indeed my old Portuguese pilot
who proposed it, and who had this excellency attend-
ing him, namely, that he was always readiest and most
apt to direct and encourage us, in cases of the most
danger. We advanced immediately with what speed
we could, and gained that little wood, the Tartars,
or thieves, for we knew not what to call them, keep-
ing their stand, and not attempting to hinder us.
When we came thither, we found, to our great satis-
faction, that it was a swampy, springy piece of
ground, and, on the one side, a very great spring of
water, which running oat in a little rill, or brook,
was a little farther joined by another of the like
bigness, and was, in short, the head, or source, of a
considerable river, called afterwards the Wirtska.
The trees which grew about this spring were not in
all above two hundred, but were very large, and
stood pretty thick, so that as soon as we got in, we
saw ourselves perfectly safe from the enemy, unless
they alighted and attacked us on foot.
But to make this more difficult, we cut down, with,
much labour, great arms of the trees, and laid them
hanging, not cut quite off, from one tree to another;
so that we made a continued fence almost round us.
We staid here waiting the motion of the enemy,
some hours, without perceiving they made any offer
to stir, when, about two hours before night, they
came directly upon us; and, though we had not per-
ceived it, we found they had been joined by some
more of the same, so that they were near fourscore
horse, whereof we fancied some were women. They
came on till they were within half a shot of our little
wood, when we fired one musket, without ball, and.
called to them in the Russian tongue to know what
they wanted, and bade them keep off; but, as if they
knew nothing of what we said, they came on with a
double fury, directly up to the wood side, not ima-
gining we were so barricadoed that they could not
break in. Our old pilot was our captain, as well as
he had been our engineer, and desired us not to fire
upon them till they came within pistol shot, that we
might be sure to kill; and that when we did fire, we
should be sure to take good aim. We bade him give
the word of command, which he delayed so long,
that they were, some of them, within two pikes'
length of us when we fired.
We aimed so true (or Providence directed our shot
so sure,) that we killed fourteen of them at the first
volley, and wounded several others, as also several
of their horses; for we had all of us loaded our
pieces with two or three bullets apiece, at least.
They were terribly surprised with our fire, and re-
treated immediately about one hundred rods from us,
in which time we loaded our pieces again, and seeing
them keep at a distance, we sallied out and caught
four or five of their horses, whose riders, we sup-
posed, were killed; and coming up to the dead, we
could easily perceive they were Tartars, but knew
not from what country, or how they came to make
an excursion of such an unusual length.
About an hour after, they made a motion to attack
us again, and rode round our little wood, to see where
else they might break in, but finding us always ready
to face them, they went off again, and we resolved
not to stir from the place for that night.
We slept little, but spent the most part of the night
in strengthening our situation, and barricading the
entrances in the wood, and keeping a strict watch,
we waited for daylight; and when it came, it gave
us a very unwelcome discovery indeed; for the enemy,
who we thought were discouraged with the reception
they had met with, were now increased to no less
than three hundred, and had set up eleven or twelve
huts and tents, as if they were resolved to besiege
us; and this little camp they had pitched was upon
the open plain, at about three quarters of a mile from
us. We were, indeed, surprised at this discovery, and now, I confess, I gave myself over for lost, and
all that I had. The loss of my effects, did not lie so
near me (though they were very considerable), as the
thoughts of falling into the hands of such barbarians,
at the latter end of my journey, after so many diffi-
culties and hazards as I had gone through, and even
in sight of our port, where we expected safety and
deliverance. As for my partner, he was raging, and
said he would rather die than be starved; and he was
for fighting to the last drop.
The young lord was for fighting to the last also;
and my old pilot was of opinion that we were able to
resist them all, in the situation we then were in; and
thus we spent the day in debates of what we should
do; but towards evening we found that the number
of our enemies still increased. Perhaps, as they
were abroad in several parties for prey the first had
sent out scouts to call for help, and to acquaint them
of the booty, and we did not Know but by the morn-
ing they might still be a greater number: so I began
to inquire of those people we had brought from To-
bolsk! if there was no other, or more private ways,
by which we might avoid them in the night, and,
perhaps, either retreat to some town, or get help to
guard us over the desert.
The Siberian. who was servant to the young lord,
told us, if we designed to avoid them, and not fight,
he would engage to carry us off in the night to a
way that went north, towards the river Petraz, by
which he made no question but we might get away,
and the Tartars never be the wiser; but, he said, his
lord had told him he would not retreat, but would
rather choose to fight. I told him, he mistook his
lord, for that he was too wise a man to love fighting
for the sake of it; that I knew his lord was brave
enough, by what he had shown already; but his lord
knew better than to desire to have seventeen or
eighteen men fight five hundred, unless an unavoid-
able necessity forced them to it; and that if he
thought it possible for us to escape in the night, we
had nothing else to do but to attempt it. He an-
swered, if his lord gave him such an order, he would
lose his life, if he did not perform it. We soon
brought his lord to give that order, though privately,
and we prepared for putting it in practice.
And, first, as soon as it began to be dark, we made
a fire in our little camp, which we kept burning, and
prepared so as to make it burn all night, that the
Tartars might conclude we were still there; but as
soon as it was dark, that is to say, so as we could see
the stars (for our guide would not stir before), having
all our horses and camels ready laden, we followed
our new guide, who, I soon found, steered himself
by the pole, or north star, all the country being level
for a long way.
After we had travelled two hours very hard, it
began to be lighter still, not that it was quite dark
all night, but the moon began to rise, so that, in short,
it was rather lighter than we wished it to be: but by
six o'clock next morning we were gotten near forty
miles, though the truth is, we almost spoiled our
horses. Here we found a Russian village, named
Kirmezinskoy, where we rested, and heard nothing
of the Kalmuck Tartars that day. About two hours
before night we set out again, and travelled till eight
the next morning, though not quite so hastily as
before: and about seven o'clock we passed a little river called Kirtza, and came to a good large town,
inhabited by Russians, and very populous, called
Ozomoys. There we heard, that several troops or
hordes of Kalmucks had been abroad upon the desert,
but that we were now completely out of danger
of them, which was to our 'great satisfaction, you may be sure. Here we were obliged to get some
fresh horses, and having need of rest; we stayed five
days; and my partner and I agreed to give the honest
Siberian, who brought us thither, the value of ten
pistoles, for his conducting us.
In five days more we came to Venssima, upon the
river Witzogda, which running into the river Dwina,
we were there very happily near the end of our
travels by land, that river being navigable in seven
days passage to Archangel. From hence we came to
Lawrenskoy, where the river joins, the third of July,
and provided ourselves with two luggage boats, and
a barge for our convenience. We embarked the
seventh, and arrived all safe at Archangel the
eighteenth, having been a year, five months, and
three days, on the journey, including our stay of eight
months and odd days at Tobolski. We were obliged
to stay at this place six weeks for the arrival of the
ships, and must have tarried longer, had not a Ham-
burger come in above a month sooner than any of
the English ships; when, after some consideration
that the city of Hamburgh might happen to be as
good a market for our goods as London, we all took
freight with him; and, having put our goods on
board, it was most natural for me to put my steward
on board, to take care of them, by which means my
young lord had a sufficient opportunity to conceal
himself, never coming on shore again in all the time
we stayed there, and this he did, that he might not
be seen in the city, where some of the Moscow mer-
chants would certainly have seen and discovered him.
We sailed from Archangel the twentieth of August,
in the same year; and, after no extraordinary bad
voyage, arrived in the Elbe, the thirteenth of Sep-
tember. Here my partner and I found a very good
sale for our goods ; as well those of China, as the sables, &c. of Siberia; and dividing the. produce of
our effects, my share amounted to three thousand
four hundred and seventy-five pounds, seventeen
shillings, and threepence, notwithstanding so many
losses we had sustained and charges we had been at,
only remembering that I had included in this about
six hundred pounds' worth of diamonds, which I had
purchased at Bengal.
Here the young lord took his leave of us, and went
up the Elbe, in order to go to the court of Vienna,
where he resolved to seek protection, and where he
could correspond with those of his father's friends
who were left alive. He did not part without all the
testimonies he could give me of gratitude for the
service I had done him, and his sense of my kindness
to the prince his father.
To conclude, having stayed near four months in
Hamburgh, I came from thence over land to the
Hague, where I embarked in the packet, and arrived
in London the tenth of January, 1705, having been
gone from England ten years and nine months.
And here, resolving to harrassmyself no more, I am
preparing myself for a longerjourney than all these,
having lived seventy-two years, a life of infinite variety, and learned sufficiently to know the value of
retirement, and the blessing of ending our days in
peace.

THE LIFE OF DANIEL DE FOE.
THE original author of Robinson Crusoe was Daniel Foe,
which, from caprice, or some other motive, he lengthened
with a prefix, calling himself De Foe. He was a native of
London, born in the year 1600, of humble parentage, his
father, James Foe, exercising the occupation of a butcher.
Daniel De Foe, in the commencement of his career, engaged
In trade: from the business of a hosier he passed to that of
a pantile maker, without any good fortune. Either from
want of prudence, or from dislike to his occupations, the
only reward of his schemes was embarrassment and distress.
In the speculations of the literary world he was more for-
tunate. In 1701, when King William, during the violence
of parties, was censured for his attachment to, and employ-
ment of foreigners, De Foe espoused the cause of his monarch,
and ridiculed his enemies in a satirical poem, called "The
True-born Englishman." This production was honoured
with an enormous sale : and he was encouraged to write
another satire, entitled, "Reformation of Manners," in
which he attacked the vices of some persons of eminent rank.
A pamphlet, called "The Shortest Way with the Dis-
twas so mistaken, or so misrepresented, that it was
declared by the House of Commons to be of a libellous na-
ture. De Foe, for his offence, was subjected to fine, impri-
sonment, and even the pillory. He did not give his enemies
much reason to exult over his despondence; for the subject
which he took to amuse his prison hours, was "A Hymn
to the Pillory." During his confinement he also undertook
enriched our language with essays of incomparable beauty.
De Foe was employed in promoting the union of England
and Scotland, of which event he also wrote the history.
Whatever glory he gained from interfering in the bitter
differences of politics, he gained little solid satisfaction. A
second imprisonment, which he suffered, taught him the
fate which he was to expect from the animosity of political
opponents. He began to take a more quiet and useful path
of literature in 1715, and published a religious work, called
*' TheFamily Instructor." Of the multitude of his other
productions specific notice is scarcely necessary. It is suffi-
cient to mention " The History of the Plague in I60S;" a
novel, entitled, " The History of Colonel Jack"—"A 7teie
Voyage round the World, by a Company of Merchants,"—
-" The History of Roxana,"—" The Memoirs of a Cava-
lier,"—" The History of Moll Flanders," and a book, en-
titled *' Religious Courtship," which has passed through
numerous editions.
But De Foe's reputation, in the present day, rests ch:cfly
upon his "Robinson Crusoe," a work which almost every
one has read in h:s childhood, and the pleasing impressions
of which are scarcely obliterated from the memory in old
age. Its simple and perspicuous style is admirably suited
to the capacity of youth; it possesses enough of the mar-
vellous to seize and delight the imagination; and the senti-
ments which it inspires are such as need not be renounced
or corrected in mature age. Respecting this work there is
a story which it is incumbent to relate, although it has never
been fairly authenticated. It has been affirmed, (says the
Encyclopedia Britannica,}that when Captain Woodes
Rogers touched at the island of Juan Fernandez, in the
South Sea, he brought away Alexander Selkirk, a Scotch
man, who, having been left ashore there, had lived upon
the island in desolate solitude for the space of four years.
When Selkirk returned to England, it is said, that he wrote
a narrative of his adventures, and put the papers into the
hands of De Foe, to digest for publication; but that he un-
generously converted the materials into the celebrated
"History of Robinson Crusoe." Part of this story may be
true, and part false. That De Foe might have had the in-
spection of Selkirk's journal, is very possible; and by his
powers of description, and skill in composition, he might
have expanded into an entertaining narrative, what in its
original form was a dull and awkward composition. But
that he was guilty of any fraud or injustice towards Selkirk,
is a suspicion which his character of general integrity should
Induce us to reject. As there is no credible proof against
him, we are bound to give him an acquittal, both because
he is not able to vindicate himself, and one who has so
entertained the rising generation, hus more than an ordinary
right not to be condemned upon doubtful accusation.
Daniel De Foe died at Islington, in the year 1731. His
daughter was respectably settled in life, by marrying Henry
Baker, an eminent naturalist.
I WAS born in the year 1632, in the city of York,
of a good family, though not of that country, my
father being a foreigner of Bremen, who settled first
at Hull. He got a good estate by merchandise, and,
leaving off his trade, lived afterwards at York: from
whence he had married my mother, whose relations
were named Robinson, a very good family in that
country, and from whom I was called Mobimon
Kreu.tzr.aer; but, by the usual corruption of words
in England, we are now called, nay, we call ourselves,
and write our name, Crusoe; and so my companions
always called me.
I had two elder brothers; one of whom was
lientenant-colonel to an English regiment of foot in
Flanders, formerly commanded by the famous Colonel
Lockhart, and was killed at the battle near Dunkirk
against the Spaniards. What became of my second
brother I never knew, any more than my father or
mother did know what became of me.
Being the third son of the family, and not bred to
any trade, my head began to be filled very early with
rambling thoughts. My father, who was very an-
cient, had given me a competent share of learning,
as far as house-education and a country free-school
generally goes, and designed me for the law; but I
would be satisfied with nothing but going to sea;
and my inclination to this led me so strongly against
the will, nay, the commands of my father, and
against all the entreaties and persuasions of my
mother «and other friends, that there seemed to be
something fataHn that propension of nature, tending
directly to that life of misery which was to befal me.
My father, a wise and grave man, gave me serious
and excellent counsel against what he foresaw was
my design. He called me one morning into his
chamber, where he was confined by the gout, and
expostulated very warmly with me upon this subject.
He asked me what reasons, more than a mere wan-
dering inclination, I had for leaving my father's
house, and my native country; where I might be
well introduced, and had a prospect of raising my
fortune by application and industry, with a life of
ease and pleasure. He told me it was men of des-
perate fortunes on one hand, or of aspiring superior
fortunes on the other, who went abroad upon adven-
tures, to rise by enterprise, and make themselves
famous in undertakings of a nature out of the common
road; that these things were all either too far above
me, or too far below me; and that mine was the
middle state, or what might be called the upper sta-
tion of low life, which he had found, by long expe-
rience, was the best state in the world, the most
suited to human happiness, not exposed to the mise-
ries and hardships, the labour and sufferings, of the
mechanic part of mankind, and not embarassed with
the pride, luxury, ambition, and envy of the upper
part of mankind. He told me I might judge of the
happiness of this state by this one thing, viz. that
this was the state of life which all other people en-
vied; that kings have frequently lamented the miser-
able consequences of being born to great things, and
wished they had been placed in the middle of the
two extremes, between the mean and the great; that
the Wise Man gave his testimony to this, as the just
standard of true felicity, when he prayed to have
neither poverty nor riches.
He bade me observe it, and I should always find,
that the calamities of life were shared among the
upper and lower part of mankind; but that the mid-
dle station had the fewest disasters; and was not
exposed to so many vicissitudes as the higher or
lower part of mankind; nay, they were not subjected
to so many distempers and uneasinesses, either of
body or mind, as those were, who, by vicious living,
luxury, and extravagancies on one hand, or by hard
labour, want of necessaries, and mean or insufficient
diet, on the other hand, bring distempers upon them-
selves by the natural consequences of their way of
living; that the middle station of life was calculated
for all kind of virtues, and all kind of enjoyments;
that peace and plenty were the handmaids of a
middle fortune; that temperance, moderation, quiet-
ness, health, society, all agreeable diversions, and all
desirable pleasures, were the blessings attending the
middle station of life; that this way men went
silently and smoothly through the world, and com-
fortably out of it; not embarrassed with the labours
of the hands, or of the head; not sold to a life of
slavery for daily bread, or harrassed with perplexed
circumstances, which rob the soul of peace and the
body of rest; nor enraged with the passion of envy,
or the secret burning lust of ambition for great things;
but in easy circumstances, sliding gently through the
world, and sensibly tasting the sweets ofliving, with-
out the bitter; feeling that they are happy, and learn-
ing by every day's experience to know it more sensibly.
After this, he pressed me earnestly, and In the most
affectionate manner, not to play the young man, nor
to precipitate myself into miseries, which nature, and
the station of life I was born in, seemed to have pro-
vided against; that I was under no necessity of
seeking my bread; that he would do well for me,
aud endeavour to enter me fairly into the station of
life which he had been just recommending to me;
and that if I was not very easy and happy in the
world, it must be my mere fate, or fault, that must
hinder it; and that he should have nothing whatever
to answer for, having thus discharged his duty in
warning me against measures which he knew would
be to my hurt. In a word, that as he would do very
kind things for me, if I would stay and settle at home
as he directed, so he would not have so much hand
in my misfortunes, as to give me any encouragement
to go away; and to close all, he told me, I had an
eldrer brother for an example, to whom he had used
the same earnest persuasions to keep him from going
into the Low Country wars, but could not prevail, his
young desires prompting him to run into the army,
where he was killed ; and though he said he would
not cease to pray for me, yet he would venture to say
to me, that if I did take this foolish step, God would
not bless me; and I would have leisure hereafter to
reflect upon having neglected his counsel, when there
might be none to assist in my recovery.
I observed in this last part of his discourse, which
was truly prophetic, though I suppose my father did
not know it to be so himself, I say, I observed the
tears run down his face very plentifully, especially
when he spoke of my brother who was killed; and
that when he spoke of my having leisure to repent,
and none to assist me, he was so moved that he broke
off the discourse, and told me his heart was SO full
he could say no more to me.
I was sincerely affected with this discourse, as
indeed who could be otherwise? And I resolved not
to think of going abroad any more, but to settle at
home according to my father's desire. But, alas! a
few days wore it all off; and, in short, to prevent
any of my father's farther importunities, in a few
weeks after I resolved to run quite away from him.
However, I did not act so hastily neither, as the first
heat of my resolution prompted; but I took my
mother at a time when I thought her a little plea-
santer than ordinary, aud told her, that my thoughts
were so entirely bent upon seeing the world, that I
should never settle to any thing with resolution
enough to go through with it; and my father had
better give me his consent, than force me to go without
it; that I was now eighteen years old, which was too
late to go apprentice to a trade, or clerk to an attor-
ney, that I was sure, if I did, I should never serve
out my time, but I should certainly run away from
my master before my time was out, and go to sea;
and if she would speak to my father to let me go one
voyage abroad, if I came home again and did not like
it, I would go no more, and I would promise by a
double diligence to recover the time I had lost.
This put my mother into a great passion. She
told me, she knew it would be to no purpose to speak
to my father upon such subject; that he knew too
well what was my interest, to give his consent to any
thing, so much for my hurt; and that she wondered
how I could think of any such thing, after the dis-
course I had had with my father, and such kind and
tender expressions, as she knew my father had used
to me; and that, in short, if I would ruin myself,
there was no help for me; but I might depend I
should never have their consent to it; that, for her
part, she would not have so much hand in my de-
struction, and I should never have it to say, that my
mother was willing when my father was not.
Though my mother refused to move it to my father,
yet I heard afterward that she reported all the dis-
course to him; and that my father, after showing a
great concern at it, said to her, with a sigh, "That
the boy might be happy, if he would stay at home;
but if he goes abroad, he will be the most miserable
\vretchthateverwasborn: lean give no consent to it."
It was not till almost a year after this that I broke
loose, though in the mean time I continued obsti-
nately deaf to all proposals of settling to business,
and frequently expostulating with my father and
mother about their being so positively determined
against what they knew my inclination prompted me
to. But being one day at Hull, whither I went casu-
ally, and without any purpose of making an elope-
ment at that time; but, I say, being there, and one
of my companions being going by sea to London, in
his father's ship, and prompting me to go with them,
with the common allurement of a sea-faring man,
that it should cost me nothing for my passage, I con-
sulted neither father nor mother any more, nor so
much as sent them word of it, but leaving them to
hear of it as they might, without asking God's bless-
ing, or my father's, without any consideration of cir-
cumstances or consequences, and in an ill hour, God
knows, on the first of September, 1051, I went on
board a ship bound for London. Never any young
adventurer's misfortunes, I believe, began sooner, or
continued longer, than mine. The ship was no sooner
got out of the Humber, but the wind began to blow,
and the sea to rise in a most frightful manner ; and,
as I had never seen the sea before, I was most inex-
pressibly sick in body and terrified in mind. I be-
gan now seriously to reflect upon what I had done,
and how justly I was overtaken by the judgment of
heaven, for my wicked leaving my father's house, and
abandoning my duty. All the good counsel of my
parents, my father's tears, and my mother's entreaties,
came now fresh into my mind, and my conscience,
which was not yet come to the pitch of hardness to
which it has been since, reproached me with the
contempt of advice, and the breach of my duty to
God and my father.
All this while the storm increased, and the sea
went very high, though nothing like what I have seen
many times since, no, nor what I saw a few days after.
But it was enough to affect me then, who was but a
young sailor, and had never known any thing of the
matter. I expected every wave would have swallowed
us up, and that every time the ship fell down, as I thought it did, in the trough or hollow of the sea, we
should never rise more. In this agony of mind, I
made my vows and resolutions, that if it pleased God
to spare my life in this one voyage, if ever I once got
my foot upon dry land again, I would go directly
home to my father, and never set it into a ship again
while I lived; that I would take his advice, and ne-
ver run myself into such miseries as these any more.
Now I saw plainly the goodness of his observations
about the middle station of life, how easy, how com-
fortable, he had lived all his days, and never had been
exposed to tempests at sea, or troubles on shore;
and, in short, I resolved that I would, like a true
repenting prodigal, go home to my father.
These wise and sober thoughts continued all the
while the storm continued, and, indeed, some time
after; but the next day the wind was abated, and
the sea calmer, and I began to be a little inured to it.
However, I was very grave for all that day, being
also a little sea-sick still; but towards night the
weather cleared up, the wind was quite over, and a
charming fine evening followed; the sun went down
perfectly clear, and rose so the next morning, and
having little or no wind, and a smooth sea, the sun
shining upon it, the sight was, as I thought, the most
delightful that ever I saw.
I had slept well in the night, and was now no more
sea-sick, but very cheerful; looking with wonder
upon the sea, that was so rough and terrible the day
before, and could be so calm and so pleasant in so
little a time after. And now, lest my good resolu-
tions should continue, my companion, who had, in-
deed, enticed me away, comes to me—" Well Bob,"
said he, clapping me upon the shoulder, " how do you
do after it? I warrant you were frightened, wa'n't
you call that a storm?" Why it was nothing at
all; give us but a good ship and sea-room, and
we think nothing of such a squall of wind as that;
but you're but a fresh-water sailor, Bob. Come, let
us make a bowl of punch, and we'll forget all that.
D'you see what charming weather 'tis now 1" To
make short this sad part of my story, we went the
way of all sailors; the punch was made, and I was
made half drunk with it, and in that one night's
wickedness I drowned all my repentance, all my re-
flections upon my past conduct, and all my resolu-
tions for the future. In a word, as the sea was re-
turned to its smoothness of surface, and settled calm-
ness, by the abatement of that storm, so the hurry of
my thoughts being over, my fears and apprehensions
of my being swallowed up by the sea being forgotten,
and the current of my former desires returned, I en-
tirely forgot the vows and promises that I made in
my distress. I found, indeed, some intervals of re-
flection, and the serious thoughts did, as it were,
endeavour to return again sometimes; but I shook
them off, and roused myself from them, as it were
from a distemper; and, applying myself to drinking
and company, soon mastered the return of those fits, (for so I called them): and I had, in five or six days,
got as complete a victory over conscience, as any
young fellow that resolved not to be troubled with it
could desire. But I was to have another trial for it
still, and Providence, as in such cases it generally
docs, resolved to leave me entirely without excuse,
for, if I would not take this for a deliverance, the
next was to be such a one as the worst and most
hardened wretch among us would confess both the
danger and the mercy.
The sixth day of our being at sea, we came into
Yarmouth Roads, the wind having been contrary,
and the weather calm, we had made but little way
since the storm. Here we were obliged to come to
an anchor, and here we lay, the wind continuing con-
trary, viz. at southwest, for seven or eight days;
during which time a great many ships from Newcastle
came into the same roads, as the common harbour
where the ships might wait for a wind for the river.
We had not, however, rid here so long, but we
should have tided it up the river, but that the wind
blew too fresh, and, after we had lain four or five
days, blew very hard. However, the roads being
reckoned as good as a harbour, the anchorage good,
and our ground-tackle very strong, our men were
unconcerned, and not in the least apprehensive of
danger, but spent the time in rest ana mirth, after
the manner at sea; but the eighth day in the morn-
ing the wind increased, and we had all hands at work
to strike our topmasts, and make every thing snug
and close, that the ship might ride as easy as possi-
ble. By noon the sea went very high indeed, and
our ship rid forecastle in, shipped several seas, and
we thought once or twice our anchor had come home,
upon which our master ordered out the sheet anchor,
so that we rode with two anchors a-head, and the
cables veered out to the better end.
By this time it blew a terrible storm indeed, and
now I began to see terror and amazement in the faces
even of the seamen themselves. The master, though
vigilant in the business of preserving the ship, yet,
as he went in and out of his cabin by me, I could
hear him, softly to himself, say several times, " Lord
be merciful to us! We shall be all lost; we shall be
undone!" and the like. During these first hurries
I was stupid, lying still in my cabin, which was in
the steerage, and cannot describe my temper. I
could ill resume the first penitence, which I had so
apparently trampled upon, and hardened myself
against. I thought the bitterness of death had been
past, and that this would be nothing, too, like the
first. But when the Inastcr himself came by me, as
I said just now, and said we should be all lost, I was
dreadiullyfrightened. I got up out of my cabin, and
looked out; but such a dismal sight I never saw;
the sea went mountains high, and broke upon us
every three or four minutes. When I could look
about, I could see nothing but distress around us.
Two ships that rid near us, we found had cut their
masts by the board, being deep loaden; and our men
cried out, that a ship, which rid about a mile ahead of us, was foundered. Two more ships, being driven
from their anchors, were run out of the roads to sea,
at all adventures, and not a mast standing. The
light ships fared the best, as not so much labouring
in the sea; but two or three of them drove, and came
close by us, running away, with only their sprit-sail
out before the wind.
Towards the evening the mate and boatswain beg-
ged the master of our ship to let them cut away the
fore-mast, which he was very unwilling to do; but
the boatswain protesting to him, that if he did not,
the ship would fo under, he consented; and when they
had cut away the fore-mast, the main-mast stood so
loose, and shook the ship so much, they were obliged
to cut her away also, and make a clear deck.
Any one may judge what a condition I must be in
at all this, who was but a young sailor, and who had
been in such a fright before at but a little. But, if I
can express at this distance the thoughts I had about
me at that time, I was in ten-fold more horror of
mind upon account of my former convictions, and the
having returned from them to the resolutions I had
wickedly taken at first, than I was at death itself;
and these, added to the terrors of the storm, put me
into such a condition, that I can by no words describe
it. But the worst was not come yet; the storm con-
tinued with such fury, that the seamen themselves
acknowledged they had never seen a worse. We had
a good ship, but she was deep loaden, and so wallowed
in the sea, that the seamen every now and then cried
out she would founder. It was my advantage, in one
respect, that I did not know what they meant by
founder, till I inquired. However, the storm was so
violent, that I saw what is not often seen, the master,
the boatswain, and some others, more sensible than
the rest, at their prayers, and expecting every mo-
ment when the ship would go to the bottom. In the
middle of the night, and under all the rest of our distresses, one of the men that had been down on
purpose to see, cried out we had sprung a leak, ano-
ther said there was four feet water in the hold. Then
all hands were called to the pump. At that very
word my heart, as I thought, died within me, and I
fell backwards upon the side of the bed where I sat,
into the cabin. However, the men roused me, and
told me, that I that was able to do nothing before.
was as well able to pump as another; at which I
stirred up, and went to the pump, and worked very
heartily. While this was doing, the master, seeing
some light colliers, who, not able to ride out the
storm, were obliged to slip and run away to sea, and
would come near us, ordered a gun to be fired as a
signal of distress. I, who knew nothing what that
meant, was so surprised, that I thought the ship had
broke, or some dreadful thing happened. In a word,
I was so surprised that I fell down in a swoon. As
this was a time when every body had his own life to
think of, nobody minded me, or what was become of
me, but another man stepped up to the pump, and,
thrusting me aside with his foot, let me lie, thinking
I had been dead; and it was a great while before I
came to myself.
We worked on, but the water increasing in the
hold, it was apparent that the ship would founder,*
and though the storm began to abate a little, yet as
it was not possible she could swim till we might run
into any port, so the master continued firing guns
for help, and a light ship, who had rid it out just
a-head of us, ventured a boat out to help us. It was
with the utmost hazard that the boat came near us, but it was impossible for us to get on board, or for
u
the boat to lie near the ship-side, till at last the men
rowing very heartily, and venturing their lives to
save ours, our men cast them a rope over the stern
with a buoy to it, and then veered it out at a great
length, which they, after much labour and hazard,
took hold of, and we hauled them close under our
stern, and got all into their boat. It was to no pur-
pose for them or us, after we were in the boat, to
think of reaching to their own ship, so all agreed to
let her drive, and only to pull her in towards the
shore as much as we could; and our master promised
them, that if the boat was staved upon shore, he
would make it good to their master. So partly
rowing, and partly driving, our boat went away to
the northward, sloping towards the shore, almost as
far as Wintertonness.
We were not much more than a quarter of an hour
out of our ship, but we saw her sink, and then I
understood, for the first time, what was meant by a
ship foundering in the sea. I must acknowledge I
had hardly eyes to look up, when the seamen told me she was sinking, for, from that moment, they
rather put me into the boat, than that I might
be said to go in; my heart was, as it were, dead
within me, partly with fright, partly with horror of
mind, and the thoughts of what was yet before me.
While we were in this condition, the men yet la-
bouring at the oar to bring the boat near the shore,
we could see (when our boat mountingthe waves, we
were able to see the shore) a great many people
running along the strand to assist us when we should
come near. But we made but slow way towards the
shore; nor were we able to reach the shore, till,
being past the light-house at Winterton, the shore
falls off to the westward towards Cromcr, and so the
land broke a little the violence of the wind. Here we
got in; and, though not without much difficulty, got
all safe on shore, and walked afterward on foot to
Yarmouth, where, ai unfortunate men, we were used
with great humanity, as well by the magistrates of
the town, who assigned us good quarters, as by parti-
cular merchants and owners of ships; and had money
given us sufficient to carry us either to London, or
back to Hull, as we thought fit.
Had I now had the sense to have gone back to
Hull, and have gone home, I had been happy, and
my father, an emblem of our blessed Saviour's para-
ble, had even killed the fatted calf for me; for, hear-
ing the ship I went away in was cast away in Yar-
mouth roads, it was a great while before he had any
assurances that I was not drowned.
But my ill fate pushed me on now with an obsti-
nacy that nothing could resist; and though I had
several times loud calls for my reason and my more
composed judgment, to go home, yet I had no power
to do it. I know not what to call this; nor will I
urge, that it is a secret overruling decree, that hur-
ries us on to be the instruments of our own destruc-
tion, even though it be before us, and that we push
upon it with our eyes open. Certainly, nothing but
some such decreed unavoidable misery attending,
and which it was impossible for me to escape, could
have pushed me forward against the calm reasonings
and persuasions of my most retired thoughts, and
against two such visible instructions as I had met
with in my first escape.
My comrade, who had helped to harden me before,
and who was the master's son, was now less forward
than I. The first time he spoke to me after we were
at Yarmouth, which was not till two or three days,
for we were separated in the town to several quar-
ters; I say, the first time he saw me, it appeared
his tone was altered; and, looking very melancholy, and shaking his head, asked me how I did: and
telling his father who I was, and how I had come
this voyage only for a trial, in order to go farther
abroad; his father turning to me with a very grave
and concerned tone, " Young man," says he, "you
B 2
ought never to go to sea any more; you ought to
take this for a plain and visible token, that you are
not to be a seafaring man."—" Why, sir," said I,
"will you go to sea no more?"—"That is another
case," said he; "it is my calling, and therefore my
duty; but as you made this voyage for a trial, you
see what a taste Heaven has given you of what you
are to expect if you persist: perhaps all this has
befallen us on your account, like Jonah in the ship
of Tarshish. Pray," continued he, "what are you?
and on what account did you go to sea?" Upon that
I told him some of my story ; at the end of which he
burst out with a strange kind of passion, " What had
I done," says he, "that such an unhappy wretch
should come into my ship? I would not set my foot
in the same ship with thee again for a thousand
pounds!" This, indeed, was, as I said, an excursion
of his spirits, which were yet agitated by the sense
of his loss, and was" farther than he could have
authority to go. However, he afterwards talked
very gravely to me, exhorting me to go back to my
father, and not tempt Providence to my'ruin; told
me I might see a visible hand of Heaven against me:
"and, young man," said he, " depend upon it, if you
do not go back, wherever you go, you will meet with -
nothing but disasters and disappomtments, till your
father's words are fulfilled upon you."
We parted soon after; for I made him little answer,
and I saw him no more: which way he went, I know
not, As, for me, having some money in my pocket,
I travelled to London by land, and there, as well as
on the road, had many struggles with myself what
course of life I should take, and whether I should go
home, or go to sea.
As to going home, shame opposed the best motions
that offered to my thoughts; and it immediately oc-
curred to me how I should be laughed at among the
neighbours, and should be ashamed to see, not my
father and mother only, but even every body else.
From whence I have since often observed how incon-
grnous and irrational the common temper of mankind
is, especially of youth, to that reason that ought to
guide them in such cases; viz. that they are not
ashamed of the action for which they ought justly to
be esteemed fools, but are ashamed of the returning,
which only can make them esteemed wise men. In this state of life, however, I remained some
time, uncertain what measures to take, and what
course of life to lead. An irresistible reluctance
continued to going home; and, as I stayed awhile,
the remembrance of the distress I had been in wore
off; and as that abated, the little motion I had in my
desires to return wore off with it, till at last I quite laid
aside the thoughts of it, and looked out for a voyage.
That evil influence which carried me first away
from my father's house, which hurried me into the
wild and indigested notion of raising my fortune, and
that impressed those conceits so forcibly upon me as
to make me deaf to all good advice, and to the en-
treaties, and even the commands, of my father; I
say, the same influence, whatever it was, presented
the most unfortunate of all enterprises to my view,
I went on board a vessel bound to the coast of Africa,
or, as our sailors vulgarly call it, a voyage to Guinea.
It was my great misfortune, that, in all these ad-
ventures, I did not ship myself as a sailor; whereby,
though I might indeed have worked a little harder
than ordinary, yet at the same time I had learned
the duty and office of a fore-mast man, and in time
might have qualified myself for a mate or lieutenant, if not for a master. But as it was always my fate
to choose for a worse, so I did here; for, having
money in my pocket, and good clothes on my back,
I would always go on board in the habit of a gentle-
man, and so I neither had any business in the ship,
nor learned to do any.
It was my lot first of all to fall into pretty good
company in London, which does not always happen
to such loose and unguided young fellows as I then
was; the devil, generally, not omitting to lay some
snare for them very early; but it was not so with
me. I first fell acquainted with the master of a ship
who had been on the coast of Guinea, and who,
having had very good success there, was resolved to
go again. This captain, taking a fancy to my con-
versation, which was not disagreeable at that time,
hearing me say I had a mind to see the world, told
me, if I would go the voyage with him, I should be
at no expense; I should be his messmate, and his
companion; and if I could carry any thing with me,
I should have all the advantage of it that the trade
would admit; and perhaps I might meet with some
encouragement.
I embraced the offer, and, entering into a strict
friendship with this captain, who was an honest
plain-dealing man, went the voyage with him, and
carried a small adventure with me, which, by the dis-
interested honesty of my friend the captain, I increased very considerably; for I carried about 40/. in such
toys and trifles as the captain directed me to buy.
This 401. I had mustered together by the assistance
of some of my relations whom I correspondedwith, and
who, I believe, got my father, or at least my mother,
to contribute so much as that to my first adventure.
This was the only voyage which I may say was
successful in all my adventures, and which I owe to
the integrity and honesty of my friend the captain,
under whom I also got a competent knowledge of the
mathematics, and the rules of navigation; learned
how to keep an account of the ship's course, take an
observation, and, in short, to understand some things
that were needful to be understood by a sailor; for,
as he took delight to instruct me, I took delight to
learn; and, in a word, this voyage made me both a.
sailor and a merchant; for I brought home five
pounds nine ounces of gold dust for my adventure,
which yielded me in London, at my return, almost
Mot.. and this filled me with those aspiring thoughts
whichTiave since so completed my ruin.
Yet, even in this voyage, I had my misfortunes too,
particularly that I was continually sick, being thrown
into a violent calenture by the excessive heat of the
climate, our principal trading being upon the coast,
from the latitude ot 15 deg. N. even to the line itself.
I was now set up for a Guinea trader; and my
friend, to my great misfortune, dying soon after his
arrival, I resolved to go the same voyage, and had
now got the command of the ship. This was the un-
happiest voyage that ever man made; for though I
did not carry off quite 10(M. of my new-gained
wealth, so that I had iiOOZ. left, and which I lodged
with my friend's widow, who was very just to me.
yet I fell into terrible misfortunes in this voyage; and
the first was this, viz. our ship, making her course to-
wards the Canary islands, or rather between those
islands and the African shore, was surprised in the
gray of the morning by a Moorish rover of Sallee, who
gave chase to us with all the sail she could make. We
crowded also as much canvas as our yards would spread, or our masts carry, to have got clear; but,
finding the pirate gained upon us, and would cer-
tainly come up with us in a few hours, we prepared
to fight, our ship having twelve guns, and the rogue
eighteen. About three in the afternoon he came up
with us, and bringing to, by mistake, just athwart
our quarter, instead of athwart our stern, as he in-
tended, we brought eight of our guns to bear on that
side, and poured in a broadside upon him, which
made him sheer off again, after returning our fire,
and pouring in also his small shot from near two
hundred men, which he had on board. However, we
had not a man touched, all our men keeping close.
He prepared to attack us again, and we to defend
ourselves; but, laying us on board the next time
upon our other quarter, he entered ninety men upon
our decks, who immediately fell to cutting and
hacking the decks and rigging. We plied them with
small shot, half-pikes, powder chests, and such like,
and cleared our decks of them twice. However, to
cut short this melancholy part of our story, the ship
being disabled, and three of our men killed and eight wounded, we were obliged to yield, and were carried
prisoners into Sallee, a port belonging to the Moors.
The usage I had there was not so dreadful as at
first I apprehended; nor was I carried up the coun-
try, to the emperor's court, as the rest of our men
were, but was kept by the captain of the rover as his
proper prize, and made his slave, being young and
nimble, and fit for business. At this surprising
change of my circumstances, from a merchant to a
miserable slave, I was perfectly overwhelmed; and
now I looked back upon my father's prophetic dis-
course to me, that I should be miserable, and have none to relieve me, which I thought was now so
effectually brought to pass, that I could not be worse;
that now the hand of Heaven had overtaken me,
and I was undone without redemption. But, alas!
this was but a taste of the misery I was to go through,
as will appear in the sequel of this story.
As my new patron or master had taken me home
to his house, so I was in hopes that he would take
me with him when he went to sea again, believing
that it would be some time or other his fate to be
taken by a Spanish or Portugal man of war, and that
then I should be set at liberty. But this hope of
mine was soon taken away; for when he went to
sea. he left me on shore to look after his little garden,
and do the common drudgery of slaves about the
house; and when he came home again from his cruise,
he ordered me to lie in the cabin to look after the ship.
Here I meditated nothing but my escape, and what
method I might take to effect it, but found no way
that had the least probability in it. Nothing pre-
sented to make the supposition of it rational, tor I
had nobody to communicate it to that would embark
with me, no fellow slave, no Englishman, Irishman,
or Scotchman there, but myself; so that for two
years, though I often pleased myself with the imagi-
nation, yet I never had the least encouraging prospect
of putting it in practice.
After about two years, an odd circumstance pre-
sented itself, which put the old thought of making
some attempt for my liberty again in my head. My
patron lying at home longer than usual, without
fitting out his ship, which as I heard was for want
of money, he used constantly once or twice a week,
sometimes oftener if the weather was fair, to take
the ship's pinnace, and go out into the road a fishing;
and as he always took me and a young Maresco with
him to row the boat, we made him very merry, and
I proved very dexterous in catching fish; inasmuch,
that sometimes he would send me with a Moor, one
of his kinsmen, and the youth the Maresco, as they
called him, to catch a dish of fish for him.
It happened one time, that going a fishing with
him in a calm morning, a fog rose so thick, that
though wewere not half a league from the shore, we
lost sight of it; and, rowing we knew not whither,
or which way, we laboured all day, and all the next
night; and when the morning came, we found we
had pulled off to sea, instead of pulling in for the
shore, and that we were at least two leagues from
the land. However, we got well in again, though
with a great deal of labour and some danger, for the
wind began to blow pretty fresh in the morning:
but particularly we were all very hungry.
But our patron, warned by this disaster, resolved
to take more care of himself for the future; and,
having lying by him the long-boat of our English
ship which he had taken, he resolved he would not
go a fishing any more without a compass, and some
provision: so he ordered the carpenter of his ship,
who was also an English slave, to build a little state
room or cabin in the middle of the long-boat, like
that of a barge, with a place to stand behind it to
steer. and haul home the main sheet; and room be-
fore for a hand or two to stand and work the sails.
She sailed with what we call a shoulder-of-mutton-
sail; and the boom jibbed over the top of the cabin,
which lay very snug and low, and had in it room for
him to lie, with a slave or two, and a table to eat on,
with some small lockers to put in some bottles of such
liquor as he thought fit to drink, particularly his
bread, rice, and coffee.
We were frequently out with this boat a fishing;
and as I was most dexterous to catch fish for him,
he never went without me. It happened one day
that he had appointed to go out in this boat, either
for pleasure or fish, with two or three Moors of some
distinction, and for whom he had provided extraor-
dinarily, and had therefore sent on board the boat
over night a larger store of provisions than usual;
and had ordered me to get ready three fusils with
powder and shot, which were on board his ship1, for
that they designed some sport of fowling as well as
fishing.
I got all things ready as he had directed, and
waited next morning with the boat washed clean, her
ancient and pendants out, and everything to accom-
modate his guests; when, by and by, my patron
came on board alone, and told me his guests had put
off going, upon some business that fell out, and ordered
me with the man and boy, as usual, to go out with
the boat and catch them some fish, for that his friends
were to sup at his house. He commanded me, too,
that as soon as I had got some fish, I should bring it
home to his house. All which I prepared to do.
This moment my former notions of deliverance
darted into my thoughts, for now I found I was like
to have a little ship at my command; and i»y master
being gone, I prepared to furnish myself, not for
fishing business, but for a voyage; though I knew
not, neither did I so much as consider, whither I
would steer, for any where to get out of that place
was my way.
My first contrivance was to make a pretence to
speak to this Moor to get something for our subsist-
ence on board, for I told him we must not presume
to eat our patron's bread. He said, that was true;
so he brought a large basket of rusk or biscuit, of
their kind, and three jars with fresh water, into the
boat. I knew where my patron's case of bottles
stood, which, it was evident by the make, were taken
out of some English prize, and I conveyed them into
the boat, while the Moor was on shore, as if they had
been there before for our master. I conveyed also a
great lump of bees wax into the boat, which weighed
about half a hundred weight, with a parcel of twine
or thread, a hatchet, a saw, and a hammer, all of
which were of great use to us afterward: especially
the wax to make candles. Another trick I tried
upon him, which he innocently came into also. His
name was Ismael, whom they called Muley, or Mo-
ley; so I called to him: "Moley," said I, "our
patron's guns are all on board the boat; can you not
get a little powder and shot? it may be we may kill
some alcomies (a fowl like our curlews) for ourselves,
for I know he keeps the gunner's stores in the ship."
"Yes," says he, "I'll bring some." Accordingly he
brought a great leather pouch, which held about a
pound and a half of powder, or rather more; and
another with shot, that had five or six pounds, with
some bullets, and put all into the boat. At the same
time I had found some powder of my master's in the
great cabin, with which I filled one of the large
bottles in the case, which was almost empty, pouring
what was in it into another, and thus furnished with
every thing needful, we sailed out of the port to fish.
The castle, which is at the entrance of the port, knew
who we were, and took no notice of us; and we were
not above a mile out of the port, before we hauled in
our sail, and sat us down to fish. The wind blew
from the N.N.E., which was contrary to my desire;
for had it blown southerly, I had been sure to have
made the coast of Spain, and at least reached to the
bay of Cadiz; but my resolutions were, blow which
way it would, I would be gone from that horrid place
where I was, and leave the rest to fate.
After we had fished some time, and catched nothing
(for when I had fish on my hook I would not pull
them up, that he might not see them), I said to the
Moor, "This will not do; our master will not be
thus served. We must stand farther off." He,
thinking no harm, agreed; and being in the head of
the boat, set the sails, and, as I had the helm, I run
the boat out near a league farther, and then brought
her to, as if I would fish; when, giving the boy the
helm, I stepped forward to where the Moor was, and
making as it I stooped for something behind him, I
took him by surprise with my arm under his twist,
and tossed him clear overboard into the sea. He
rose immediately, for he swam like a cork, and called
to me, begged to be taken in, told me he would go
all over the world with me. He swam so. strong
after the boat, that he would have reached me very
quickly, there being but little wind; upon which I
stepped into the cabin, and fetching one of the fow-
ling-pieces, I presented it at him, and told him I had
done him no hurt, and, if he would be quiet, I would
do him none. "But," said I, " you swim well enough
to reach the shore, and the sea is calm; make the
best of your way to shore, and I will do you no harm;
but if you come near the boat, I'll shoot you through
the head, for I am resolved to have my liberty." So
he turned himself about, and swam for the shore,
and I make no doubt but he reached it with ease, for
he was an excellent swimmer.
I could have been content to have taken this Moor
with me, and have drowned the boy, but there was
no venturing to trust him. When he was gone, I
turned to the boy, whom they called Xury, and said
to him, " Xury, if you will be faithful to me, 111
make you a great man; but if you will not stroke
your face to be true to me," that is swear by Maho-
met and his father's beard, " I must throw you into the
sea too." The boy smiled in my face, and spoke so in-
nocently, that I could not mistrust him, and swore to
be faithful to me, and go all over the world with me.
While I was in view of the Moor that was swim-
ming, I stood out directly to sea with the boat, rather
stretching to windward, that they might think me
gone towards the Strait's mouth (as indeed any one
that had been in their wits must have been supposed
to do); for who would have thought we were sailed on to
the southward, to the truly Barbarian coast, where
whole nations of Negroes were sure to surround us with
their canoes, and destroy us, where we could never go
once on shore, but we should be devoured by savage
beasts, or more merciless savages of human kind?
But as soon as it grew dusk in the evening I
changed my course, and steered directly south and
by east, bending my course a little towards the
east, that I might keep in with the shore; and,
having a fair fresh gale of wind, and a smooth quiet
sea, I made such sail, that I believe, by the next day
at three o'clock in the afternoon, when I first made
the land, I could not be less than 150 miles south of
Sallee, quite beyond the emperor of Morocco's domi-
nions, or indeed of any other king thereabouts, for
we saw no people.
Yet such was the fright I had taken at the Moors,
and the dreadful apprehensions I had of falling into
their hands, that I would not stop, or go on shore, or
come to an anchor, the wind continuing fair, till I
had sailed in that manner five davs; and then the
wind shifting^ to the southward, I concluded, also,
that if any of our vessels were in chase of me, they
also would now give over; so I ventured to make to
the coast, and came to an anchor in the mouth of a
little river, I knew not what or where, neither what
latitude, what country, what nation, or what river.
I neither saw nor desired to see any people: the
principal thing I wanted was fresh water. We came
into this creek in the evening, resolving to swim on
shore as soon as it was quite dark, we heard such dreadful noises of the barking, roaring, and howling
of wild creatures, of we knew not what kinds, that the
poor boy was ready to die with fear, and begged of
me not to go on shore till day. "Well, Xury," said
I, "then I won't; but it may be we may see men by
day, who will be as bad to us as those lions." '' Then
we may give them the shoot gun," says Xury, laugh-
ing, " make them run away. Such English Xury
spoke by conversing among us slaves. However, I was
glad to see the boy so cheerful, and I gave him a
dram (out of our patron's case of bottles) to cheer
him up. After all, Xury's advice was good, and I
took it. We dropped our little anchor, and lay still
all night; I say still, for we slept none; for in two
or three hours we saw vast great creatures, we knew
not what to call them, of many sorts, come down to
the sea shore, and run into the water, wallowing and
washing themselves for the pleasure of cooling them-
selves; and they made such hideous howlings and
ycllings, that I never indeed heard the like.
Xury was dreadfully frighted, and indeed so was
I too; but we were both worse frighted when we
heard one of the mighty creatures come swimming
towards our boat; we could not see him, but we
might hear him by his blowing to be a monstrous
huge and furious beast. Xury said it was a lion, and
it might be for aught I knew. Poor Xury cried
out to me to weigh the anchor and row away. "No,"
says I, " Xury, we can slip our cable with a buoy to
it, and go to sea; they cannot follow us far." I had
no sooner said so, but I perceived the creature (what-
ever it was) within two oars' length, which something
surprised me: however, I immediately stepped to
the cabin door, and taking up my gun, fired at him,
upon which he immediately turned about, and swam
towards the shore again.
But it was not possible to describe the horrible
noises, and hideous cries and bowlings, that were
raised, as well upon the edge of the shore as higher
within the country, upon ^he noise or report of a
gun, a thing I have some reason to believe those
creatures had never heard before. This convinced
me that there was no going on shore for us in the
night upon that coast, and how to venture on shore
in the day was another question too; for, to have
fallen into the hands of any of the savages, had been
as bad as to have fallen into the paws of lions and
tigers; at least we were equally apprehensive of the
danger of it.
Be that as it would, we were obliged to go on shore
somewhere or other for water, for we had not a pint
in the boat; when or where to get it was the point.
Xury said if I would let him go on shore with one
of the jars, he would find if there was any water, and
bring some to me. I asked him why he would go,
why I should not go, and he stay in the boat. The
boy answered with so much affection, that made me
love him ever after. Says he, "If wild mans come,
they eat me up; you go away." "Well, Xury," said
I, "we will both go; and if the wild mans come, we
will kill them; they shall eat neither of us." So I
gave Xury a piece of rusk-bread to eat, and a dram
out of our patron's case of bottles, which I men-
tioned before, and we hauled the boat in as near the
shore, as we thought'was proper, and waded on shore,
carrying nothing but our arms, and two jars for water.
I did not care to go out of sight of the boat, fearing
the coming of canoes with savages down the river;
but the boy seeing a low place, about a mile up the
country, rambled to it, and by and by I saw him
come running towards me, I thought he was pur-
sued by some savage, or frighted with some wild
beast, and I ran forward towards him to help him;
but when I came nearer to him, I saw something
hanging over his shoulders, which was a creature that
he had shot, like a hare, but different in colour, and
longer legs. However, we were very glad of it, and
it was very good meat; but the great joy that poor
Xury came with, was to tell me he had found good
water, and seen no wild mans.
But we found afterward that we need not take
such pains for water, for a little higher up the creek
where we were, we found the water fresh when the
tide was out, Which flows but a little way up; so we
filled our jars, and feasted on the hare we had killed,
and prepared to go on our way, having seen no foot-
steps of any human creature in that part of the
country.
As I had been one voyage to this coast before I
knew very well that the islands of the Canaries, and
the Cape de Verd islands also, lay not far off from
the coast. But as I had no instruments to take an
observation to know what latitude we were in, and
did not exactly know, or at least, not remember what
latitude they were in, I knew not where to look for
them, or when to stand off to sea towards them,
otherwise I might easily have found some of these
islands. But my hope was, that if I stood along this
coast till I came to that part where the English
traded, I should find some of their vessels upon their
usual design of trade, that would relieve and take
us in.
By the best of my calculation, that place where I
now was, must be that country which, lying between
the Emperor of Morocco's dominions and the Negroes
lies waste and uninhabited, except by wild beasts,
the Negroes having abandoned it, and gone farther
south, for fear of the Moors: and the Moors not
1 hinkinu; it worth inhabiting, by reason of its bar-
renness, and indeed both forsaking it because of the
prodigious numbers of tigers, lions, leopards, and
other furious creatures which harbour there, so that
the Moors use it for their hunting only, where they
go like an army, two or three thousand men at a
time, and, indeed, for near a hundred miles together
upon this coast we saw nothing but a waste, unin-
habited country by day, and heard nothing but how-
ling and roaring of wild beasts by night.
Once or twice in the day time, I thought I saw the
Pico of Teneriffe, being the high top of the mountain
Teneriffe in the Canaries, and had a great mind to
venture put in hopes of reaching thither; but, having
tried twice, I was forced in again by contrary winds, the sea also going too high for my little vessel; so I
resolved to pursue my first design, and keep along
the shore.
Several times we were obliged to land for fresh
water, after we had left this place; and once in par-
ticular, being early in the morning, we came to an
anchor under a little point of water, which was pretty
high, and the tide beginning to flow, we lay still to
go farther in. Xury, whose eyes were more about
him, it seems, than mine were, calls softly to me, and
tells me that we had best go farther on the shore,
'" For," says he, " look, yonder lies a dreadful mon-
ster on the side of that hillock, fast asleep." I looked
where he pointed, and saw a dreadful monster indeed,
for it was a terrible great lion, that lay on the side
of the shore, under the shade of a piece of the hill,
that hung as it were a little over him. "Xury," said
I," you shall go on shore and kill him. Xury looked
frightened, and said, "Me kill'. He eat me at one
mouth!" one mouthful he meant. However, I said
no more to the boy, but bade him be still, and took
our biggest gun, which was almost musket-bore, and
two slugs, and laid it down, then I loaded another
gun with two bullets, and the third (for we had three
pieces) I loaded with five smaller bullets. I took
the best aim I could with the first piece, to have
shot him into the head; but he lav so with his leg
raised a little above his nose, that the slugs hit his leg
c
about the knee, and broke the bone. He started up
growling at first, but finding his leg broke, fell down
again, and then got upon three legs, and gave the
most hideous roar that ever I heard. I was a little
surprised that I had not hit him on the head; how-
ever, I took up the second piece immediately, and,
though he began to move off, fired again, and shot
him into the head, and had the pleasure to see him
drop, and making but little noise, he lay struggling
for life. Then Xury took heart, and would let me
have him go ashore. "Well, go," said I. So the
boy jumped into the water, and taking a little gun in
one hand, swam to shore with the other hand, and
coming close to the creature, put the muzzle of the
piece to his ear, and shot him into the head again,
which despatched him quite.
This was game indeed to us, but this was no food,
and I was very sorry to lose three charges of powder
and shot, upon a creature that was good for nothing
to us. However, Xury said he would have some of
him; so he comes on "board, and asked me to give
him the hatchet. "For what, Xury?" said I. ""Me
cut off his head," said he. However, Xury could not
cut off his head, but he cut off a foot, and brought it
with him, and it was a monstrous great one.
I bethought myself, however, that perhaps the skin
of him might one way or other be of some value to
us, and I resolved to take off his skin if I could. So
Xury and I went to work with him; but Xury was
much the better workman at it, for I knew very ill
how to do it. Indeed it took us up both the whole
day, but at last we got off the hide of him, and
spreading it on the top of our cabin, the sun effectually
dried it in two days' time, and it afterwards served
me to lie upon.
After this stop, we made on to the southward con-
tinually, for ten or twelve days, living very sparingly
on our provisions, which began to abate very much,
and going no oftener into the shore than we were
obliged to for fresh water. My design in this was to
make the river Gambia or Senegal, that is to say,
any where about the Cape de Verd, where I was m
hopes to meet with some European ship; and if I did
not, I knew not what course to take, but to seek for
the islands, or perish there among the Negroes. I
knew that all the ships from Europe, which sailed
either to the coast of Guinea, or to Brazil, or to the
East Indies, made this cape or those islands, and, in
a word, I put the whole of my fortune upon this
single point, either that I must meet with some ship
or perish.
When I had pursued this resolution about ten days
longer, as I have said, I began to see that the land
was inhabited, and in two or three places, as we sailed
by, we saw people stand upon the shore to look at
us; we could also perceive they were quite black,
and stark naked. I was once inclined to have gone
on shore to them, but Xury was my better counsellor,
and said to me, " No go, no go." However, I hauled
in nearer the shore, that I might talk to them, and
I found they ran along the shore by me a good way.
I observed they had no weapons in their hands, ex-
cept one, who had a long slender stick, which Xury
said was a lance, and that they would throw them a
great way with good aim; so I kept at a distance,
but talked with them by signs for something to eat.
They beckoned to me to stop my boat, and they
would fetch me some meat. Upon this I lowered
the top of my sail, and lay by, and two of them ran
up into the country, and in less than half an hour
came back, and brought with them two pieces* of dry
flesh and some corn, such as is the produce of their
country, but we neither knew what the one or the
other was; however, we were willing to accept it.
But how to come at it was our next dispute, for I was
not for venturing on shore to them, and they were as
much afraid of us, but they took a safe way for us
all, for they brought it to the shore, and laid it down,
c 2
it on board, and then came close to us again.
We made signs to thank them, for we had nothing
to make them amends; but an opportunity offered
that instant to oblige them wonderfully; for while
we were lying by the shore, came two mighty crea-
tures, one pursuing the other (as we took it) with
great fury, from the mountains towards the sea;
whether it was the male pursuing the female, or
whether they were in sport or in rage, we could not
tell any more than we could tell whether it was
usual or strange, but I believe it was the latter, be-
cause, in the first place, those ravenous creatures
seldom appear but in the night, and, in the second
place, we found the people terribly frighted, especially
the women. The man that had the lance or dart did
not fly from them, but the rest did. However, as
the two creatures ran directly into the water, they
did not seem to offer to fall upon the Negroes, but
plunged themselves into the sea, and swam about as
if they had come for their diversion; and at last one
of them began to come nearer our boat than at first
I expected; but I lay ready for him, for I had loaded
my gun with all possible expedition, and bade Xury
load both the others. As soon as he came fairly
within my reach, I fired, and shot him directly
through the head. Immediately he sunk down into
the water, but he rose instantly, and plunged up and
down as if he was struggling for life, and so indeed
he was. He immediately made to the shore, l>uI.
between the wound, which was his mortal hurt, ana*
the strangling of the water, he died just before he
reached the shore. It is impossible to express the astonishment of
these poor creatures, at the noise and fire of my gun:
some of them were ready even to die of fear, and fell
down as dead with the very terror. But when the?
saw the creature dead, and sunk into the water, mid
that I made signs for them to come to the shore, they
took heart and came to the shore, and began to
search for the creature. I found him by his blood
staining the water, and by the help of a rope, which
I flung round him, and gave the Negroes to haul,
they dragged him on shore, and found it was a most
curious leopard, spotted and fine to an admirable
degree; and the Negroes held up their hands with
admiration, to think what it was I killed him with.
The other creature, frighted with the flash of fire,
and the noise of the gun, swam to the shore, and ran
up directly to the mountains from whence they came,
nor could I at that distance know what it was. I
found quickly the Negroes were for eating the flesh
of this creature, so I was willing to have them take
it as a favour from me, which, when I made signs to
them that they might take him, they were very
thankful for. Immediately they fell to work with
him, and though they had no knife, yet with a sharp-
ened piece of wood they took off his skin as readily,
nay, much more readily, than we could have done
with a knife. They offered me some of the flesh,
which I declined, making as if I would give it them,
but made signs for the skin, which they gave me
very freely, and brought me a great deal more of
their provision, which though I did not understand,
yet I accepted. Then I made signs to them for some
water, and held out one of my jars to them, turning
its bottom upward, to show that it was empty, and
that I wanted to have it filled. They called imme-
diately to some of their friends, and there came two
women, and brought a great vessel made out of
earth, and burnt, as I suppose, in the sun: this they
set down for me, as before, and I sent Xury on shore
with my jars, and filled them all three. The women
were as stark naked as the men.
I was now furnished with roots and corn, such as
it was, and water; and, leaving my friendly Negroes,
made forward for about eleven days more, without
pfefing to go near the shore, till I saw the land run
of four or five leagues before me, and, the sea being
very calm, I kept a large offing to make this point;
at length, doubling the point at about two leagues
from the land, I saw plainly land on the other side
to seaward; then I concluded, as it was most certain
indeed, that this was the Cape de Verd, and those
islands, called from thence Cape de Verd islands.
However, they were at a great distance, and I could
not well tell what I had best to do; for if I should
be taken with a fresh wind, I might' neither reach
one nor other.
In this dilemma, as I was very pensive, I stepped
into the cabin, and sat me down, Xury having the
helm, when on a sudden the boy cried oat, " Master,
master, a ship was a sail!" and the foolish boy was
frighted out of his wits, thinking it must needs be
some of his master's ships sent to pursue us, when I
knew we were gotten far enough out of their reach.
I jumped out of the cabin, and immediately saw not
only the ship, but what she was, viz. that she was a
Portuguese ship, and, as I thought, was bound to
the coast of Guinea for Negroes. But when I ob-
served the course she steered, I was soon convinced
they were bound some other way, and did not design
to go any nearer to the shore, upon which I stretched
out to sea as much as I could, resolving to speak
with them if possible.
With all the sail I could make, I found I should
not be able to come in their way, but that they would
be gone by before I could make any signal to them;
but after I had crowded to the utmost, and began to
despair, they, it seems, saw me by the help of their
perspective glasses, and that it was some European
boat, which they supposed must belong to some ship
that was lost; so they shortened sail to let me come
up. I was encouraged with this, and as I had my
patron's ancient on board, I made a waft of it to them
as a signal of distress, and fired a gun, both of which they f&vr, for they told me they saw the smoke,
though they did not hear the gun. Upon these sig-
nals they very kindly brought to, and lay by for me,
and in about three hours time I came up with them.
They asked me what I was, in Portuguese, and in
Spanish, and in French, but I understood none ot
them; but at last a Scots sailor, who was on board,
called to me, and I answered him, and told him I
was an Englishman, that I had made my escape out
of slavery from the Moors at Sallee. Then they bade
me come on board, and very kindly took me in, and
all my goods.
It was an inexpressible joy to me, that any one
will believe, that I was thus delivered, as I esteemed
it, from such a miserable and almost hopeless condi-
tion as I was in. I immediately offered all I had to
the captain of the ship, as a return for my deliver-
ance; but he generously told me, he would take
nothing from me, but that all I had should be deli-
vered safe to me when I came to the Brazils. "For,"
says he, " I have saved your life on no other terms
than as I would be glad to be saved myself; and it
may one time or other be my lot to be taken up in
the same condition. Besides," says he, " when I
carry you to the Brazils, so great a way from your own country, if I should take from you what little
thither in charity,and these things will help you to buy
your subsistence there, and your passage home again."
As he was charitable in' this proposal, so he was
just in the performance to a tittle; for he ordered the
seamen that none should offer to touch any thing I
had: then he took every thing into his own possession, and gave me back an exact inventory of them, that
I might have them again, even so much as my three
earthen jars.
As to my boat it was a very good one. and that he
saw, and told me he would buy it of me for the ship's
use, and asked me what I would have for it. I told
him he had been so generous to me in every thing,
that I could not offer to make any price of the boat,
but left it entirely to him; upon which he told me he
would give me a note of hand to pay me 80 pieces of
eight for it in Brazil, and when it came there, if any
one offered to give more, he would make it up. He
offered me also 60 pieces of eight for my boy, Xury,
which I was loath to take; not that I was not willing
to let the captain have him, but I was very loath to
sell the poor boy's liberty, who had assisted me so
faithfully in procuring my own. However, when I
let him know my reason, he owned it to be just, and
offered me this medium, that he would give the boy
an obligation to set him free in ten years, if he turned
Christian. Upon this, Xury, saying he was willing
to go to him, I let the captain have him.
We had a very good voyage to the Brazils, and
arrived in the Bay de todos los Santos, or All Saints
Bay, in about twenty-four days after. And now I
was once more delivered from the most miserable of
all conditions of life, and what to do next with my-
self, I was to consider.
The generous treatment the captain gave me I can
never enough remember; he would take nothing of
me for my passage, gave me 20 ducats for the leopard's
skin, and 40 for the lion's skin, which I had in the
boat, and caused every thing I had in the ship to be
punctually delivered to me; and what I was willing
to sell, he bought, such as the case of bottles, two of
my guns, and a piece of the lump of bees wax, for I
had made candles of the rest; in a word, I made
about 220 pieces of eight of all my cargo, and with
this stock I went on shore in the Brazils.
I had not been long here, but being recommended
to the house of a good honest man like himself, who
had an ingenio, as they call it, that is, a plantation
and a sugar-house, I lived with him some time, and
acquainted myself by that means with the manner of
their planting and making of sugar; and seeing how
well the planters lived, and how they grew rich sud-
denly, I resolved, if I could get license to settle there,
I would turn planter among them; resolving, in the
mean time, to find out some way to get my money
which I had left in London remitted to me. To this
purpose, getting a kind of letter of naturalization, I
purchased as much land that was uncured as my
money would reach, and formed a plan for my plan-
tation and settlement, and such a one as might be
suitable to the stock which I proposed to myself to
receive from England.
I Lead a neighbour, a Portuguese of Lisbon, but
born of English parents, whose name was Wells, and
in much such circumstances as I was. I call him
neighbour, because his plantation lay next to mine,
ana we went on sociably together; my stock was but
1 low as well as his, and we rather planted for food
than any thing else for about two years. However,
we began to increase, and our land began to come
into order, so that the third year we planted some
tobacco, and made each of us a large piece of ground
ready for planting canes in the year to come, but we
both wanted help; and now I found, more than
before, I had done wrong in parting with my boy,
Xury.
But, alas! for me to do wrong that never did right,
was no great wonder. I had no remedy but to go
on. I was gotten into an employment quite remote
to my genius, and directly contrary to the life I de-
lighted'in, and for which I forsook my father's house,
and broke through all his good advice; nay, I was
coming into the very middle station, or upper degree
of low life, which my father advised me to before,
and which, if I resolved to go on with, I might as
well have staid at home, and never fatigued myself
in the world, as I have done; and I used often to say
to myself, I could have done this as well in England
among my friends, as have gone five thousand miles
off to do it among strangers and savages in the wil-
derness, and at such a distance as never to hear from
any part of the world that had any knowledge of me.
In this manner I used to look upon my condition
with the utmost regret. I had nobody to converse
with, but now and then this neighbor ; no work to
be done but by the labour of my hands; and I used
to say, I lived just like a man cast away upon a doselate island, that had nobody there but himself. But
how just hag it been, and how should all men reflect,
that when they compare their present conditions with
others that are worse, Heaven may oblige them to
make the exchange, and be convinced of their former
felicity, by their experience! I say, how just has it
been, that the truly solitary life I reflected on in an
island of mere desolation should be my lot, who had
so often unjustly compared it with the life I then
led, in which, had I continued, I had, in all proba-
bility, been exceedingly prosperous and rich.
I was in some degree settled in my measures for
carrying on the plantation before my kind friend,
the captain of the ship that took me up at sea, went
back, for the ship remained there in providing her
loading, and preparing for her voyage, near three
months -j when, telling him what little stock I had
left behind me in London, he gave me this friendly
and sincere advice : "Signor Inglese," says he (for
so he always called me), "if you will give me letters,
and a procuration here in form to me, with orders to
the person who has your money in London, to send
your effects to Lisbon, to such persons as I shall
direct, and in such goods as are proper in this country,
I will bring you the produce, God willing, at my
return; but, since human affairs are all subject to
changes and disasters, I would have you give orders
for 100?. sterling, which you say is half your stock,
and let the hazard be run for the first, so that if it
come safe, you may order the rest the same way, and
if it miscarry, you may have the other half to hare
recourse to for your supply.
This was such wholesome advice, and looked so
friendly, that I could not but be convinced it was the
best course I could take; so I accordingly prepared
letters to the gentlewoman with whom I had left my
money, and a procuration to the Portuguese captain,
as he desired.
I wrote the English captain's widow a full account
of all my adventures, my slavery, escape, and how I
had met with the Portugal captain at sea, the hu-
manity of his behaviour, and what condition I was
now in, with all other necessary directions for my
supply; and when this honest captain came to Lisbon,
he found means, by some of the English merchants
there, to send over not the order only, but a full ac-
count of my story, to a merchant at London, who
presented it effectually to her; whereupon she not
only delivered the money, but out of her own pocket
sent the Portugal captain a very handsome present
for his humanity and charity to me.
The merchant in London vested this 100?. in
English goods, such as the captain had written for, and
sent them directly to him at Lisbon, and he brought
them safe to me to the Brazils; among which,
without my direction (for I was too young in my busi-
ness to think of them), he had taken care to have all
sorts of tools, iron-work, and utensils necessary for
my plantation, and which were of great use to me.
When this cargo arrived I thought my fortune
made, for I was surprised with the joy of it; and my
good steward, the captain, had laid out the 51. which
my friend had sent him for a present for himself, to
purchase, and bring me over a servant, under a bond
for six years service, and would not accept of any
consideration, except a little tobacco, which I would
have him accept, being of my own produce.
Neither was this all; but my goods being all
English manufactures, such as cloth, stuffs, baize, and
things particularly valuable and desirable in the
country, I found means to sell them to a very great
advantage; so that I may say, I had more than four
times the value of my first cargo, and was now in-
finitely beyond my poor neighbour, I mean in the
advancement of my plantation; for the first thing I
did, I bought me a negro slave and a European ser-
vant also; I mean another besides that which the
captain brought me from Lisbon.
But as abused prosperity is oftentimes made the
very means of our greatest adversity, so was it with
me. I went on the next year with great success in
my plantation; I raised fifty great rolls of tobacco
on my own ground, more than I had disposed of for
necessaries among my neighbours, and these fifty
rolls being each of above lOOlb. weight, were well
cured and laid by against the return of the fleet from
Lisbon. And now increasing in business and wealth,
my head began to be full of projects and under-
takings beyond my reach, such as are, indeed often
the ruin of the best heads in business.
Had I continued in the station I was now in, I had
room for all the happy things to have yet befallen
me, for which my father so earnestly recommended
a quite retired life, and which he had so sensibly
described the middle station of life to be full of; but
other things attended me, and I was still to be the
wilful agent of all my own miseries; and particularly
to increase my fault, and double the reflections upon
myself, which in my future sorrows I should have
leisure to make, all these miscarriages were procured
by my apparent obstinate adhering to my foolish in-
clinatiou of wandering abroad, and pursuing that
inclination in contradiction to the clearest views of
doing myself good in a fair and plain pursuit of those
prospects and those measures of life, which nature
and Providence concurred to present me with, and
to make my duty.
As I had once done thus in breaking away from
my parents, so I could not be content now; but I
must go and leave the happy view I had of being a
rich and thriving man in my new plantation, only to
pursue a rash and immoderate desire of raising faster
than the nature of the thing admitted; and thus I
cast myself down again into the deepest gulf of
human misery that any man fell into,or,perhaps, could
be consistent with life, and a state of health in the
world.
To come, then, by just degrees to the particulars
of this part of my story; you may suppose that
having now lived almost four years in the Brazils,
and beginning to thrive and prosper very well upon
my plantation, I had not only learned the language,
but had contracted acquaintance and friendship among
my fellow-planters, as well as among the merchants
of St. Salvador, which was our port, and that, in
my discourses among them, I had frequently given
them an account of my two voyages to the coast of
Guinea, the manner of trading with the negroes
there, and how easy it was to purchase upon the
coast, for trifles, such as beads, toys, knives, scissors,
hatchets, bits of glass, and the like, not only gold-
dust, Guinea grains, elephants' teeth, &c, but negroes
for the service of the Brazils in great numbers.
They listened always very attentively to my dis-
courses on these heads, but especially to that part
which related to the buying of negroes, which was a
trade at that time not only not far entered into, but, as
far as it was, had been carried on by the assientos, or'
permission of the kings of Spain and Portugal, and
engrossed in the public stock, so that few negroes
were bought, and those excessive dear.
It happened, being in company one day with some
merchants, and planters of my acquaintance, and
talking of those things very earnestly, three of them
came to me the next morning, and told me they had
been musing very much upon what I had discoursed
of with them the last night, and they came to make
a secret appeal to me, and, after enjoining my secrecy, they told me they had a mind to' fit out a ship to
Guinea ; that they had all plantations as well as I,
and were straitened for nothing so much as servants;
that as it was a trade that could not be carried on,
because they could not publicly sell the negroes when
they came home, so they desired to make but one
voyage, to bring the negroes on shore privately, and
divide them among their own plantations; and, in a
word, the question was, whether I would go their
supercargo in the ship, to manage the trading part
upon the coast of Guinea; and they offered me that
I should have an equal share of the Negroes, without
providing any part of the stock.
This was a fair proposal, it must be confessed, had
it been made to any one that had not had a settle-
ment and plantation of his own to look after, which
was in a fair way of coming to be very considerable,
and with a good stock upon~it. But for me that was
thus established, and had nothing to do but go on as
I had begun for three or four years more, and to have
sent for the other 1007. from England, and who, in
that time, and with that little addition, could scarce
have failed of being worth 3 or 40007. sterling, and
that increasing too; for me to think of such a voyage
was the most preposterous thing that ever man, in
such circumstances, could be guilty of.
But I, that was born to be my own destroyer, could
no more resist the offer, than I could refrain my first
rambling designs, when my father's good counsel
was lost upon me. In a word, I told them I would
go with all my heart, if they would undertake to
look after my plantation in my absence, and would
dispose of it to such as I should direct, if I miscar-
ried. This they all engaged to do; and I made a
formal will, disposing of my plantation and effect, in case of my death, making the captain of the ship
that had saved my life, as before, my universal heir,
but obliging him to dispose of my effects as I had
directed in my will; one half of the produce being
to himself, and the other to be shipped to
England!
In short, I took all possible caution to preserve my
effects, and keep up my plantation. Had I used half
as much prudence to have looked into my own in-
terest, and have made a judgment of what I ought
to have done, I had certainly never gone away from
so prosperous an undertaking, leaving all the pro-
bable views of a thriving circumstance, and gone
'upon a voyage to sea, attended with all its common
hazards, to say nothing of the reasons I had to ex-
pect particular misfortunes to myself.
But I was hurried on, and obeyed blindly the dietates of my fancy, rather than" my reason; and,
accordingly, the ship being fitted out, and the cargo
furnished, and all things done as by agreement by
my partners in the voyage, I went on board in an
evil hour again, the 1st of September, 1659, being the
same day eight years that I went from my father
and mother at Hull, in order to act the rebel to their
authority and the fool to my own interest.
Our ship was about 120 tons burden, carried six
guns, and fourteen men, besides the master, his boy.
and myself. We had on board no large cargo of
goods, except such toys as were fit for our trade with
the Negroes; such as beads, bits of glass, shells, and
odd trifles, especially little looking glasses, knives,
scissors, hatchets, and the like.
The same day I went on board, we set sail, stand-
ing away to the northward upon our own coast, with
design to stretch over for the African coast, when
they came into about ten or twelve degrees of nor-
thern latitude, which, it seems, was the manner of
their course in those days. We had very good wea-
ther, only excessive hot all the way upon our own
coast, till we came to the height of Cape St. Augiis-
tino, from whence keeping farther off at sea, we lost
sight of land, and steered as if we were bound for
the Isle of Fernand de Norouba, holding our course
N. E. by N. and leaving those isles on the east. In
this course we passed the line in about twelve days'
time, and were, by our last observation, in 7 degrees,
22 minutes, northern latitude, when a violent tornado
or hurricane took us quite out of our knowledge; it
began from the south-east, came about to the north-
west, and then settled into the north-east, from
whence it blew in such a terrible manner, that for
twelve days together we could do nothing but drive;
and scudding away before it, let it carry us wherever
fate and the fury of the winds directed; and during
these twelve days, I need not say that I expected
every day to be swallowed up, nor did any in the
ship expect to save their lives.
In this distress we had, besides the terror of the
storm, one of our men died of the calenture, and one
man and the boy washed overboard. About the
twelfth day, the weather abating a little, the master
made an observation as well as he could, and found
that he was in about 11 degrees of north latitude,
but that he was 22 degrees of longitude difference
west from Cape St. Augustino, so that he found he
was got upon the coast of Guinea, or the north part
of Brazil, beyond the river Amazones, towards that
of the river Oroonoque, commonly called the Great
River; and now he began to consult with me what
course he should take, for the ship was leaky, and
very much disabled, and he was for going directly
back to the coast of Brazil.
I was positively against that; and, looking over
the charts of the sea-coast of America with him, we
concluded there was no inhabited country for us to
have recourse to, till we came within the circle of
the Caribbee Islands, and therefore resolved to stand
away for Barbadoes, which by keeping off at sea, to
avoid the indraught of the Bay or Gulf of Mexico,
we might easily perform, as we hoped, in about fifteen
days sail; whereas we could not possibly make our
voyage to the coast of Africa, without some assist-
ance both to our ship and ourselves.
With this design we changed our course, and
steered away N. \V. by W. in order to reach some of
our English islands, where I hoped for relief; but
our voyage was otherwise determined ; for, being in
the latitude of 12 degrees 18 minutes, a second storm
came upon us, which carried us away with the same
impetuosity westward, and drove us so out of the
very way of all human commerce, that had our lives
been saved, as to the sea, we were rather in danger
of being devoured by savages, than ever returning to
our own country.
In this distress, the wind still blowing very hard,
one of our men, early one morning, cried out," Land!"
and we had no sooner run out of the cabin to look
out, in hopes of seeing whereabouts in the world we
were, but the ship struck upon a sand, and, in a mo-
ment, her motion being so stopped, the sea broke
over her in such a manner that we expected we
should all have perished immediately; and we were
even driven to close quarters, to shelter us from the
very foam and spray of the sea.
It is not easy for any one, who has not been in the
like condition, to describe or conceive the consterna-
tion of menin such circumstances. Weknew nothing
where we were, or upon what land it was we were
driven, whether an island or the main, whether in-
habited or not inhabited ; and as the rage of the wind
was still great, though rather less than at first, we
could not so much as hope to have the ship hold many
minutes without breaking in pieces, unless the wind,
by a kind of miracle, should turn immediately again
In a word, we sat looking upon one another, and ex-
pecting death every moment, and every man acting
accordingly, as preparing for another world, for there
was little or nothing more for us to do in this; that
which was our present comfort, and all the comfort
we had, was, that contrary to our expectation the
D
ship did not break yet, and that the master said the
wind began to abate.
Now, though we thought that the wind did a little
abate, yet the ship having thus struck upon the sand,
and sticking too fast to expect her getting off, we
were in a dreadful condition indeed, and had nothing
to do but to think of saving our lives as well as we
could. We had a boat at our stern just before the
storm, but she was first staved by dashing against
the ship's rudder, and in the next place she broke
away, and either sunk or was driven off to sea, so
there was no hope from her. We had another boat
on board, but how to get her off into the sea, was a
doubtful thing. However, there was no room for
debate, for we fancied the ship would break in pieces
every^minute; and some said she had broken already.
In this distress, the mate of our vessel lays hold of
the boat, and with the help of the rest of the men,
they got her flung over the ship's side, and getting
all into her, let go, and committed ourselves, being
eleven in number, to God's mercy, and the wild sea;
for though the storm was abated considerably, yet
the sea went dreadfully high upon the shore, and
might well be called "Den mid zee," as the Dutch
call the sea in a storm.
And now our case was very dismal indeed, for we
all saw plainly that the sea went so high, that the
boat could not escape, and that we should be inevi-
tably drowned. As to making sail, we had none;
nor, if we had, could we have done any thing with
it; so we worked at the oar towards the land, though
with heavy hearts, like men going to execution; for we all knew, that when the boat came near the shore,
she would be dashed in a thousand pieces by the
breach of the sea. However, we committed our souls
to God in the most earnest manner, and the wind
driving us towards the shore, we hastened our de-
struction with our own hands, pulling, as well as we
could, towards land.
What the shore was, whether rock or sand, whether
steep or shoal, we knew not; the only hope that
could rationally give us the least shadow of expecta-
tion, was, if we might get into some bay or gulf, or
the mouth of some river, where, by great chance, we
might have run our boat in, or got under the lee of
the land, and perhaps made smooth water. But
there was nothing of this appeared; but as we made
nearer and nearer the shore, the land looked more
frightful than the sea.
After we had rowed, or rather driven, about a
league and a half, as we reckoned it, a raging wave,
mountain-like, came rolling astern of us, and plainly
bade us expect the "coup de grace." In a word, it
took us with such a fury, that it overset the boat at
once, and separating us as well from the boat as
from one another, gave us not time hardly to say,
"OGod!" for we were all swallowed up in a moment.
Nothing can describe the confusion of thought
which I felt when I sunk into the water, for though
I swam very well, yet I could not deliver myself
from the waves so as to draw my breath, till that
wave had driven me or rather carried me, a vast way
on towards the shore, and having spent itself, went
back, and left me upon the land almost dry, but half
dead with the water I took in. I had so much pre-
sence of mind, as well as breath left, that seeing my-
self nearer the main land than I expected, I got upon
my feet, and endeavoured to make on towards the
land, as fast as I could, before another wave should
return and take me up again. But I soon found it
was impossible to avoid it, for I saw the sea come
after me as high as a great hill, and as furious as an
enemy, which I had no means or strength to contend
with - my business was to hold my breath, and raise
myself upon the water, if I could, and so by swimming
to preserve my breathing, and pilot myself towards
the shore, if possible; my greatest concern now being
that the wave, as it would carry me a great way to-

wards the shore when it came on, might not carry me
back again with it, when it gave back towards the sea.
The wave that came upon me again buried me at
once twenty or thirty feet deep in its own body, and
I could feel myself carried with a mighty force and
swiftness towards the shore a very great way; but
I held my breath, and assisted myself to swim still
forward with all my might. I was ready to burst
with holding my breath, when, as I felt myself rising
up, so, to my immediate relief. I found my head and
hands shoot out above the surface of the water; and
though it was not two seconds of time that I could
keep myself so, yet it relieved me greatly, gave me
breath and new courage. I was covered again with
water a good while, but not so long but I held it out,
and finding the water had spent itself, and began to
return, I struck forward against the return of the
waves, and felt ground again with my feet. I stood
still a few moments to recover breath, and till the
water went from me, and then I took to my heels,
and ran with what strength I had farther towards
the shore. But neither would this deliver me from
the fury of the sea, which came pouring in after me
again, and twice more was I lifted up by the waves and carried forwards as before, the shore being very
flat.
The last time of these two had well near been fatal
to me; for the sea having hurried me along as before,
landed me, or rather dashed me, against a piece of rock, and that with such force, as it left me senseless,
and indeed helpless, as to my own deliverance; for
the blow taking my side and breast, beat the breath,
as it were quite out of my body, and had it returned
again immediately, I must have been strangled in
the water; but I recovered a little befor the return
of the waves, and seeing I should be covered again
with the water, I resolved to hold fast by a piece of
the rock, and so to hold my breath, if possible, till
the wave went back. Now, as the waves were not
so high as at first, being near land, I held my hold till
the wave abated, and then fetched another run, which
brought me so near the shore, that the next wave,
though it went over me, yet did not so swallow me
up as to carry me away; and the next run I took I
got to the main land, where, to my great comfort, I
clambered up the cliffs of the shore, and sat me down
upon the grass, free from danger, and quite out of
the reach of the water.
I was now landed, and safe on shore, and began to
look up and thank God that my life was saved, in a
case wherein there was some minutes before scarce
any room to hope. I believe it is impossible to ex-
press to the life what the ecstacies and transports of
the soul are when it is so saved, as I may say, out of
the very grave: and I do not wonder now at that
custom, viz. when a malefactor, who has the halter
about his neck, is tied up, and just going to be turned
off, and has a reprieve brought to him; I say, I do
not wonder that they bring a surgeon with it, to let
him blood that very moment they tell him of it, that
the surprise may not drive the animal spirits from
the heart, and overwhelm him:—
"For sudden joys, like griefs, confound at first." I walked about on the shore, lifting up my hands,
and my whole being, as I may say, wrapt up in the
contemplation of my deliverance, making a thousand
gestures and motions which I cannot describe, reflect 'ing upon all my comrades that were drowned, and
that there should not be one soul saved but myself;
for, as for them, I never saw them afterward, or any
sign of them, except three of their hats, one cap, and
two shoes that were not fellows.
I cast my eyes to the stranded vessel, when the
breach and froth of the sea being so big, I could hardly
see it, it lay so far off; and considered, Lord! how
was it possible I crtuld get shore!
After I had solaced my mind with the comfortable
part of my condition, I began to look round me, to
see what kind of place I was in, and what was next
to be done, and I soon found my comforts abate, and
that, in a word, I had a dreadful deliverance; for I
was wet, had no clothes to shift me, nor any thing
either to eat or drink to comfort me, neither did I see
any prospect before me but that of perishing with
hunger, or being devoured by wild beasts: and that
which was particularly afflicting to me was, that I
had no weapon either to hunt and kill any creature
for my sustenance, or to defend myself against any
other creature that might desire to kill me for theirs.
In a word, I had nothing about me but a knife, a
tobacco-pipe, and a little tobacco in a box: this
was all my provision, and this threw me into terrible
agonies of mind. that for a while I ran about like a
madman. Night coming upon me, I began with a
heavy heart, to consider what would be my lot, if
there were any ravenous beasts in that country, see-
ing at night they always come abroad for their prey.
All the remedy that offered to my thoughts at that
time was, to get up into a thick bushy tree, like a
fir, but thorny, which grew near me, and where I re-
solved to sit all night, and consider the next day what
death, I should die; for, as yet I saw no prospect of
life. I walked about a furlong from the shore, to see
if I could find any fresh water to drink, which I did
to my great joy; and having drank, and put a little
tobacco in my mouth to prevent hunger, I went to
the tree, and getting up into it, endeavoured to place
myself so as that, if I should sleep, I might not fall;
and having cut me a short stick, like a truncheon,
for my defence, I took up my lodging; and having
been excessively fatigued, I fell fast asleep, and slept
as comfortably as, I believe few could have done in my condition, and found myself the most refreshed
with it that I think I ever was on such an occasion.
When I waked it was broad day, the weather clear,
and the storm abated, so that the sea did not rage and swell as before; but that which surprised me
most was, that the ship was lifted off In the night,
from the sand where she lay, by the swelling of the
tide, and was driven up almost as far as the rock
which I first mentioned, where I had been so bruised
by dashing me against it. This being within about a
mile from the shore where I was, and the ship
seeming to stand upright still, I wished myself on
board, that at least I might save some necessary
things for my use.
When I came down from my apartment in the tree,
I looked about me again; and the first thing I found
was the boat, which lay as the wind and sea had
tossed her upon the land, about two miles on my
right hand. I walked as far as I could upon the
shore to have got to her, but found a neck or inlet of
water between me and the boat, which was about
half a mile broad; so I came back for the present,
being more intent upon getting at the ship, where I
hoped to find something for my present subsistence.
A little after noon I found the sea very calm; and
the tide ebbed so far out, that I could come within a
quarter of a mile of the ship; and here I found a
fresh renewing of my grief; for I saw evidently that
if we had kept on board we had been all safe, that
is to say, we had all got safe on shore, and I had not
been so miserable as to be left entirely destitute of
all comfort and company, as I now was. This forced
tears from my eyes again; but as there was little
relief in that, I resolved, if possible, to get to the
ship; so I pulled off my clothes, for the weather was
hot to extremity, and took the water; but, when I
came to the ship, my difficulty was still greater to
know how to get on board, for as she lay aground,
and high out of the water, there was nothing within
my reach to lay hold of. I swam round her twice,
and the second time I espied a small piece of rope,
which I wondered I did not see at first, hang down
by the fore chains, so low as that with great difficulty
I got hold of it, and, by the help of that rope, got
up into the forecastle of the ship. Here I found that
the ship was bulged, and had a great deal of water
in her hold, but that she lay so on the side of a bank
of hard sand, or rather earth, that her stern lay
lifted up upon the bank, and her head low almost to
the water; by this means all her quarter was free,
and all that was in that part was dry; for you may
be sure my first work was to search and to see what
was spoiled, and what was free: and first I found
that all the ship's provisions were dry and untouched
by the water: and being very well disposed to eat,
I went to the bread-room, and filled my pockets with
biscuit, and eat it as I went about other things, for I
had no time to lose. I also found some rum in the
great cabin, of which I took a large dram, and which
I had indeed need enough of, to spirit me for what
was before me. Now I wanted nothing but a boat
to furnish myself with many things which I foresaw
would be very necessary to me.
It was in vain to sit still, and wish for what was
not to be had; and this extremity roused my appli-
cation. We had several spare yards, and two or
three large spars of wood, and a spare top-mast or
two in the ship; I resolved to fall to work with these,
and flung as many of them overboard as I could
manage for their weight, tying every one with a rope
that they might not drive away. " When this was
done, I went down the ship's side, and pulling them
to me, I tied four of them fast together at both ends
as well as I could, in the form of a raft; and laying
two or three short pieces of plank upon them cross-
ways, I found that I could walk upon them very
well, but that it was not able to bear any great
weight, the pieces being too light: so I went to work,
and with a carpenter's saw I cut a spare topmast into three lengths, and added them to my raft, with
great labour; but the hope of furnishing myself
with necessaries encouraged me more than I should
have been able to have done upon another occasion.
My raft was now strong enough to bear any rea-
sonable weight. My next care was what to load it
with, and how to preserve what I laid upon it from
the surf of the sea: but I was not long considering
this; I first laid all the planks or boards upon it that
I could get, and having considered well what I most
wanted, I first got three of the seamen's chests,
which I had broken open and emptied, and lowered
them down upon my raft. The first of these I filled
with provisions, viz. bread, rice, three Dutch cheeses,
pieces of dried goat's flesh, which we lived much upon,
and a little remainder of European corn, which had
been laid by some fowls which we brought to sea
with us, but the fowls were killed. There had been
some barley and wheat together, but, to my great
disappointment, I found afterwards that the rats had
eaten or spoiled it all. As for liquors, I found several
cases of bottles belonging to our skipper, in which
were some cordial waters, and in all about five or six
gallons of rack : these I stowed by themselves,
. there being no need to put them into the chest, nor
any room for them. While I was doing this, I found
the tide began to flow, though very calm, and I had
the mortification to see my coat, shirt, and waistcoat,
which I had left on shore upon the sand, swim
away; as for my breeches, which were only linen,
and open-knee'd, I swam on board in them and my
stockings. However, this put me upon rummaging for
clothes, of which I found enough, but took no more
than I wanted for present use, for I had other things
which my eye was more upon: as first, tools to work
with on shore, and it was after long searching that
I found out the carpenter's chest, which was indeed
a very useful prize to me, and much more valuable
than a ship-loading of gold would have been at that
time. I got it down to my raft, even whole as it was, without losing time to look into it, for I knew in
general what it contained.
My next care was for some ammunition and arms.
There were two very good fowling pieces in the great
cabin, and two pistols; these I secured first, with
some powder-horns, a small bag of shot, and two old
rusty swords. I knew there were three barrels of
powder in the ship, but knew not where our gunner
had stowed them, but with much search I found them,
'two of them dry and good, the third had taken water;
those two I got to my raft, with the arms. And now
I thought myself pretty well freighted, and began to
think how I should get to shore with them, having
neither sail, oar, or rudder, and the least capful of
wind would have overset all my navigation.
I had three encouragements; first, a smooth and
calm sea; secondly, the tide rising and settling in to
the shore; thirdly, what little wind there was blew
me towards the land. And thus, having found two
or three broken oars belonging to the boat, and be-
sides the tools which were in the chest, I found two
saws, an axe, and a hammer, and with this cargo I
put to sea. For a mile or thereabouts my raft went
very well, only that I found it drive a little distant
from the place where I had landed before, by which
I perceived there was some indraught of the water,
and consequently I hoped to find some creek or river
there, which I might make use of as a port to get to
land with my cargo.
As I imagined, so it was; there appeared before
me a little opening of the land. I found a strong
current of the tide set into it, so I guided my raft as
well as I could, to keep in the middle of the stream.
But here I had like to have suffered a second ship-
wreck, which, if I had, I think verily would have
broken my heart; for, knowing nothing of the coast,
my raft ran aground, at one end of it, upon a shoal,
not being aground at the other, it wanted but a little
that all my cargo had slipped off towards that end
that was afloat, and so fallen into the water. I did
my utmost by setting by back against the chests, to
keep them in their places, but could not thrust off the
raft with all my strength; neither durst I stir from
the posture I was in, but, holding up the chests with
all my might, stood in"that manner near half an hour,
in which time the rising of the water brought me a
little upon a level, and, a little after, the water still
rising, my raft floated again, and I thrust her off
with the oar I had into the channel, and then driving
up higher, I at length found myself in the mouth of
a little river, with land on both sides, and a strong
current of tide running up. I looked on both sides
for a proper'place to get to shore, for I was not willing
to be driven too high up the river, hoping in time to
see some ship at sea, and therefore resolved to place
myself as near the coast as I could.
At length I spied a little cove on the right shore of
the creek, to which with great pain and difficulty I
guided my raft, and at last got so near, as that,
reaching ground with my oar, I could thrust her
directly in; but here I had liked to have dipped all
my cargo in the sea again, for that shore lying pretty
steep, that is to say, sloping, there was no pla':c to
land, but where one end of the float, if it ran on
shore, would lie so high, and the other sink lower as
before, that it would endanger my cargo again. All
that I could do was to wait till the tide was at the
highest, keeping the raft with my oar, like an anchor,
to hold the side of it fast to the shore, near a flat
piece of ground, which I expected the water would
flow over, and so it did. As soon as I found water
enough (for my raft drew about a foot of water), I
thrust her upon that flat piece of ground, and there
fastened or moored her, by sticking my two broken
oars into the ground, one on one side near one end,
and one on the other side near the other end; and
thus I lay till the water ebbed away, and left my
raft and all my cargo safe on shore.
My next work was to view the country, and seek
a proper place for my habitation, and where to stow
my goods to secure them from whatever might hap-
pen. Where I was I yet knew not, whether on the
continent or on an island; whether inhabited, or not
inhabited; whether in danger of wild beasts or not.
There was a hill not above a mile from me, which
rose up very steep and high, and which seemed to
overtop some other hills, which lay as in a ridge from
it northward. I took out one of the fowling pieces,
and one of the pistols, and a horn of powder, and
thus armed, I travelled for discovery up to the top
of that hill, where, after I had with great labour and
difficulty got up, I immediately saw my fate, to my
great affliction; viz. that I was in an island, en-
vironed every way with the sea, no land to be seen,
except some rocks, which lay a great way off, and
two small islands less than this, which lay about
three leagues to the west.
I found also that the island I was in was barren,
and, as I saw good reason to believe, uninhabited,
except by wild beasts, of which, however, I saw
none; yet I saw abundance of fowls, but knew not
their kinds, neither, when I killed them, could I tell
what was fit for food, and what not. At my coming
back, I shot at a great bird, which I saw sitting upon
a tree, on the side of a large wood. I believe it was
the first gun that had been fired there since the
creation of the world. I had no sooner fired, but
from all parts of the wood there arose an extra-
ordinary number of fowls, of many sorts, making a
confused screaming and crying, every one according
to his usual note; but not one of them of any kind
that I knew. As for that creature I killed, I took
it to be a kind of a hawk, its color and beak re-
sembling it, but it had no talons or claws more than
common: its flesh was carrion, and fit for nothing.
Contented with this discovery, I came back to my
raft, and fell to work to bring the rest of my cargo
on shore, which took me up the rest of the day.
What to do with myself at night I knew not, nor
indeed where to rest; for I was afraid to lie down on
the ground, not knowing but some wild beast might
devour me, though I afterward found there was really
no need for those fears.
However, as well as I could, I barricaded myself
round with the chests and boards that I had brought
on shore, and made a kind of hut for that night's
lodging: as for food, I yet saw not which way to
supply myself, except that I had seen two or three
creatures; like hares, run out of the wood where I shot the fowl.
I now began to consider that I might yet get a
great many things out of the ship which would be
useful to me, and particularly some of the rigging
and sails, and such other things as might come to
hand, and I resolved to make another voyage on
board the vessel if possible; and as I knew that the
first storm that blew must necessarily break her in
pieces, I resolved to set all other things apart till I got every thing out of the ship that I could get:
then I called a council, that is to say, in my thoughts,
whether I should take back the raft, but this
appeared impracticable, so I resolved to go as before,
when the tide was down, and I did so, only that I stripped before I went from my hut, having nothing
on but a checkered shirt, a pair of linen drawers,
and a pair of pumps on my feet.
I got on board the ship as before, and prepared a
second raft; and having had experience of the first,
I neither made this so unwieldy, nor loaded it so
hard; but yet I brought away several things very
useful to me ; as first, in the carpenter's stores I found
two or three bags full of nails and spikes, a great
screw jack, a dozen or two of hatchets, and, above
all, that most useful thing called a grindstone: all
these I secured, together with several things belong-
ing to the gunner, particularly three iron crows, and
two barrels of musket bullets, seven muskets, and
another fowling-piece, with a small quantity of pow-
der more; a large bag full of small shot, and a great
roll of sheet lead, but this last was so heavy, I could
not hoist it up to get it over the ship's side.
Besides these things, I took all the men's clothes
that I could find, and a spare fore-topsail, hammock, and some bedding, and with this I loaded my second
raft, and brought them also safe on shore.
I was under some apprehensions, during my absence
from the land, that at least my provisions might be
devoured on shore; but when I came back, I found
no sign of any visitor, only there sat a creature like
a wild cat upon one of the chests, which, when I came
towards it, ran away to a little distance, and then
stood still. She sat very composed and unconcerned,
and looked full in my face, as if she had a mind to be
acquainted with me. I presented my gun at her, but
as she did not understand it, she was perfectly un-
concerned, nor did she offer to stir away; upon which
I tossed her a bit of biscuit, though I was not very
free of it, for my store was not great. However, I gave her a bit; she smelled of it, eat it, and looked
for more; but I thanked her, and could spare no
more, so she marched off.
Having got my second cargo on shore (though I was fain to open the barrels of powder, and bring
them by parcels, for they were too heavy, being large
casks), I went to work to make a little tent with the
sail and some poles which I cut for that purpose;
and into this tent I brought every thing that I knew
would spoil, either with rain or sun; and I piled all
the empty chests and casks up in a circle round the
tent, to fortify it from any attempt from man or beast.
When I had done this, I blocked up the door of the
tent with some boards within. and an empty chest
set up on an end without, and spreading one of the
beds upon the ground, laying my two pistols just at
my head, and my gun at length by me, I went to
bed for the first time, and slept little, and had la-
boured hard all day, as well to fetch those things
from the ship, as to get them on shore.
1 had the largest magazine of all kinds now that
ever was laid up, I believe, for one man; but I was
not satisfied still, for while the ship sat upright in
that posture, I thought I ought to get every thing
out of her that I could: so every day, at low water,
I went on board, and brought away something or
other. But particularly the third time I went, I brought away as much of the rigging as I could, as
also all the small ropes and rope-twine I could get,
with a piece of spare canvas, which was to mend the
sails upon occasion, and the barrel of wet gunpowder. In a word, I brought away all the sails first and last,
only that I was fain to cut them in pieces, and bring
as much at a time as I could, for they were no more
useful to me for sails, but as mere canvas only.
But that which comforted me more still was, that
at last of all, after I had made five or six such voy-
ages as these, and thought I had nothing more to
expect from the ship that was worth my meddling
with, I say, after all this, I found a great hogshead
of bread, three large runlets of rum or spirits, a box
of sugar, and a barrel of fine flour: this was surpris-
ing to me, because I had given over expecting any
more provisions, except what was spoiled by the
water. I soon emptied the hogshead of that bread,
and wrapt it up, parcel by parcel, in pieces of the
sails which I cut out; and, in a word, I got this safe
on shore also, though at several times.
The next day I made another voyage; and now,
having plundered the ship of what was portable, and
fit to hand out, I began with the cables; and cutting
the great cable into pieces, such as I could move, I got two cables and a haulser on shore, with all the
iron work I could get; and having cut down the
sprit-sail-yard, and the mizen-yard, and every thing
I could to make a large raft, I loaded it with all
those heavy goods and came away. But my good
luck began "to leave me, for this raft was so unwieldy
and so overloaded, that after I was entered the little
cove where I had landed the rest of my goods, not
being able to guide it so handily as I did the other, it
overset, and threw me and all my cargo into the
water. As for myself, it was no great harm, for I was near the shore; but as to my cargo, it was great
part of it lost, especially the iron, which I expected
would have been of great use to me. However, when
the tide was out, I got most of the pieces of cable
ashore, and some of the iron. though with infinite
labour, for I was fain to dip for it into the water, a
work which fatigued me very much. After this I went every day, and brought away what I could.
I had now been thirteen days on shore, and had
been eleven times on board the ship, in which times
I had brought away all that one pair of hands could
well be supposed capable to bring, though I believe
verily, had the calm weather held, I should have
brought away the whole ship piece by piece. But
preparing the twelfth time to go on board, I found
the wind began to rise; however, at low water, I went on board; and though I thought I had rum-
maged the cabin so effectually as that nothing more
could be found, yet Ifdiscovered a locker with draw-
ers in it, in one of which I found two or three razors
and one pair of large scissors, with ten or a dozen
good knives and forks; in another I found about
thirty-six pounds value in money, some European
coin, some Brazil, some pieces of eight, some gold,
some silver.
I smiled to myself at the sight of this money. "O
drug," said I aloud, " what art thou good for? Thou
art not worth to me, no, not the taking off the ground.
One of those knives is worth all this heap. I have
no manner of use for thee, even remain where thou
art, and go to the bottom as a creature whose life is
not worth saving!" However upon second thoughts
I took it away, and wrapping all this in a piece of
canvas, I began to think of making another raft;
but while I was preparing this, I found the sky over-
cast, and the wind began to rise, and in a quarter of
an hour it blew a fresh gale from the shore ; it pre-
sently occurred that it was in vain to pretend to make
a raft with the wind off shore, and that it was my
business to be gone before the tide of flood began,
otherwise I might not be able to reach the shore at
all: accordingly, I let myself down into the water,
and swam across the channel which lay between the
ship and the sand, and even that with difficulty
enough, partly with the weight of the things I had
about me, and partly the roughness of the water, for
the wind rose very hastily, and before it was quite
high water it blew a storm.
But I was gotten home to my little tent, where I
lay with all my wealth about me very secure ; it
blew very hard all that night, and in the morning,
when I looked out, behold no more of the ship was
to be seen. I was a little surprised, but recovered
myself with this satisfactory reflection, viz. that I
had lost no time, nor abated any diligence, to get
every thing out of her that could be useful to me:
and that, indeed, there was little left in her that I
was able to bring away, if I had had more time. I
now gave over any more thought of the ship, or of
any thing out of her, except what might drive on
shore from her wreck, as indeed divers pieces of her
afterwards did; but those things were little use to me.
My thoughts were now wholly employed about se-
curing myself against either savages, if any should
appear, or wild beasts, if any were in the island; and
I had many thoughts of the method how to do this,
and what kind of dwelling to make, whether I should
make me a cave in the earth, or a tent upon the earth,
and, in short, I resolved upon both; the manner and
description of which I will give an account of.
I soon found this place was not for my settlement,
particularly because it was low moorish ground near
the sea, which I thought would not be wholesome,
and more particularly because there was no fresh
B
water near it: so I resolved to find a more healthy
and more convenient spot of ground.
I consulted several things in my situation. which
I found would be proper for me; first, health, and
fresh water, as I just now mentioned; secondly,
shelter from the heat of the sun; thirdly, security
from ravenous creatures,either man or beast; fourthly,
a view of the sea, that if God sent any ship in sight,
I might not lose any advantage for my deliverance,
for which I was not willing to banish all hopes.
In search for a place proper for this, I found a little
plain on the side of a rising hill, whose front towards
this little plain was as steep as a house-side, so that
nothing could come down upon me from the top.
On the side of this rock there was a hollow place,
worn a little way in, like the entrance or door of a
cave, but there was no cave or way into the rock.
On the flat of the green, just before this hollow
place, I resolved to pitch my tent. This plain was
not above a hundred yards broad, and about twice as
long, and lay like a green before my door, and at the
end it descended irregularly every way down into the
low grounds by the seaside. It was on the N. N.
W. side of the hill, so that it was sheltered from the
heat every day, till it came to a W. and by S. sun, or
thereabouts, which in those countries is near setting.
Before I set up my tent, I drew a half-circle before
the hollow place, which took in about ten yards in
semi-diameter, from its beginning and ending.
In this half-circle I pitched two rows of strong
stakes, driving them into the ground till they stood
very firm like piles, the biggest end being out of the
ground about five feet and a half, and sharpened on
the top; the two rows stood about six inches apart.
Then I took the pieces of cable which I had cut
in the ship, and laid them in rows upon one another,
within the circle between the two rows of stakes, up
to the top, placing other stakes in the inside, leaning
against them, about two feet and a half high, like a
spur to a post, and this fence was so strong that
neither man nor beast could get into it. This cost
me a great deal of time and labour, especially to cut
the piles, bring them, and drive them into the earth.
The entrance into this place I made to be, not by
a door, but by a ladder over the top;. which ladder,
when I was in, I lifted over after me, and so I was
completely fenced in, and fortified, as I thought,
from all the world, and consequently slept secure in
the night, which otherwise I could not have done.
though, as it appeared afterwards, there was no need
of all this caution.
Into this fence, or fortress, with infinite labour, I
carried all my riches, all my provisions, ammunition,
and stores; and I made a large tent also, which, to pre-
serve me from the rains, that in one part of the year are
very violent here, I made double, viz. one smaller
tent within, and one large tent above it, and covered
the uppermost with a large tarpaulin, which I had
brought on shore from among the sails.
And now I lay no more for awhile in the bed that
I had brought on shore, but in a hammock, which was
a very good one, and belonged to the mate.
Into this tent I brought all my provisions, and every
thing that would spoil by the wet; and having thus
enclosed all my goods, I made up the entrance, which, till now was left open, and so passed by a ladder.
When I had done this, I began to work my way
into the rock, and bringing all the earth and stones
out through mv tent, I laid them up within my fence
in the nature of a terrace, so that it raised the ground
within about a foot and a half, and thus I made me a
cave just behind my tent, which served for a cellar.
It cost me much labor, and many days, before all
these things were brought to perfection; and, there-
fore, I must go back to some other things which took
up some of my thoughts. At the same time it hap-
pened, after I had laid my scheme for setting up my
tent, and making the cave, that a storm of rain fal-
E 2
ling from a dark thick cloud, a sudden flash of light-
ning happened, and after that a clap of thunder, as
is naturally the effect of it. I was not so much sur-
prised with the lightning, as with the thought which
darted into my mind:—O my powder! My heart
sunk within me, to think that at one blast all my
powder might be destroyed; on which, not my de-
fence only, but the providing me food, as I thought,
entirely depended; I was nothing near so anxious
about my own danger; though had the powder took
fire, I had never known who had hurt me.
Such impression did this make upon me, that after
the storm was over, I laid aside all my works, my
building and fortifying, and applied myself to make
bags and boxes to separate my powder, and to keep
it a little and a little in a parcel, in hopes, that what-
ever might come, it might not all take fire at once,
and to keep it so apart, that it should not be possible
to make one part fire the other. I finished this work
in about a fortnight, and my powder, which in all
was about 1401b. weight, wasdivided.into no less than
a hundred parcels. As to the barrel that had been
wet, I did not apprehend any danger from that, so I
placed it in my new cave, which in my fancy I called
my kitchen, and the rest I hid in the rocks, that no wet
might get to it, carefully marking where I laid it.
In the interval of time while this was doing, I went
out once every day with my gun, as well to divert
myself, as to see if I could kill any thing fit for
food, and, as near as I could, to acquaint myself
with what the island produced. The first time I
went out, I discovered that there were goats in the
island, which was a great satisfaction to me; but
then it was attended with this misfortune, viz. that
they were so shy, so subtle, and so swift of foot, that
it was the difficultest thing in the world to come at
them, but I was not discouraged at this, not doubting
but I might now and then shoot one, as it soon hap-
pened, for after I had found their haunts a little, I
if they saw me in the valleys, though they were upon
the rocks, they would run away in a terrible fright ;
but if they were feeding in the valleys, and I was
upon the rocks, they took no notice of me; from
whence I concluded, that by the position of their
optics, their sight was so directed downward, that
they did not readily see objects that were above them;
so I always climbed the rocks first to get above them,
and then had frequently a fair mark. The first shot
I made among these creatures, I killed a she-goat
which had a little kid by her, she gave suck to, which
grieved me heartily; but when the old one fell, the
kid stood stock still by her till I came and took her
up; and not only so, but when I carried the old one
upon my shoulders, the kid followed me quite to my
enclosure; upon which I laid down the dam, and took
the kid in my arms, and carried it over my pale, in
hopes to have bred it up tame; but it would not eat,
so I was forced to kill it, and eat it myself. These
two supplied me with flesh a great while; for I ate
sparingly, and saved my provisions (my bread espe-
cially) as much as I possibly could.
Having fixed my habitation, I found it absolutely
necessary to provide a place to make a fire in, and
fuel to burn; and what I did for that as also how I en-
Jarged my cave, and what conveniences I made, I
shall give a full account of in its place ; but I must
first give some little account of myself, and of my
thoughts of living, which were not a few.
I had a dismal prospect of my condition; for as
I was not cast away upon that island without being
driven, as is said, by a violent storm quite out of the
course of our intended voyage, and a great way, viz.
some hundreds of leagues, out of the ordinary course
of the trade of mankind, I had great reason to con-
eider it as a determination of Heaven, that in this
desolate place, and in this desolate manner, I should
end my life. The tears would run plentifully down
my face, when I made these reflections; and some-
times I would expostulate with myself, why Provi-
dence should thus completely ruin its creatures, and
render them so absolutely miserable, without help,
abandoned, and so entirely depressed, that it could
hardly be rational to be thankful for such a life?
But something always returned swift upon me to
check these thoughts, and to reprove me; and parti-
cularly one day, walking with my gun in my hand
by the sea-side, I was very pensive upon the subject
pi' my present condition, when reason, as it were, put
in, expostulating with me the other way, thus :—
Well, you are in a desperate condition, it is true, but
pray remember, where are the rest of you? Did not
you come eleven of you into the boat? where are the
ten? why were not"they saved, and you lost? why
were you singled out? is it better to be here or there?
And then I pointed to the sea. Al l evils are to be
considered with the good that is in them, and with
what worse attended them.
Then it occurred to me again, how well I was fur-
nished for my subsistence, and what would have been
my case, if it had not happened, which was a hundred
thousand to one, that the ship floated from the place
where she first struck, and was driven so near to the
.shore, that I had time to get all things out of her?
What would have been my case, if I had been to have
lived in the condition in which I at first came on
shore, without necessaries of life, or any means to
supply and procure them? Particularly, what would
I have done without a gun, without ammunition,
without any tools to make any thing, or to work
with? without clothes, bedding, a tent, or any man-
ner of covering ? And that now I had all these to
a sufficient quantity, and was in a fair way to provide
myself in such a manner, as to livewithout my gun
when my ammunition was spent, so that I had a
tolerable view of subsisting without any want as long
as I lived, for I considered from the beginning how I
would provide for the accidents that might happen,
'and for the time that was to come, even not only
after my ammunition should be spent, but even after
my health or strength should decay.
I confess I had not then entertained any notion of
my ammunition being destroyed at one blast, I mean
my powder being blown up by lightning; and this
made the thoughts of it so surprising to me, when it
lightened and thundered, as I observed just now.
And now, being to enter into a melancholy relation
of a scene of silent life, such, perhaps, as was never
heard of in the world before, I shall take it from its
beginning, and continue it in its order. It was, by
my account, the S'Jth of September, when, in the
manner aljove-said, I first set foot upon this horrid
island, when the sun being to us, in its autumnal
equinox, was almost just over my head; for I reck-
oned myself by observation, to be in the latitude of
9 degrees 22 minutes north of the Line.
After I had been here about ten or twelve days, it
eame into my thoughts, that I should lose my reck-
oning of time for want of books, and pen and ink, and
should even forget the Sabbath days from the work-
ing days; but to prevent this, lent it with my knife
upon a large post, in capital letters, and, making it
into a great cross, I set it up on the shore where I
first landed; viz. I came on shore here the 30th of
Sept. Ifiofcl. Upon the sides of this square post I cut
every day a notch with my knife, and every seventh
notch was as long again as_ the rest, and every first
day of the month as long again as the long one, and
thus I kept my calendar, or weekly, monthly, and
yearly reckoning of time.
In the next place we are to observe that among
many things which I brought off the ship in the
several voyages, which, as above-mentioned, I made
to it, I got several things of less value, but not at all
less useful to me, which I omitted setting down be-
-fore, as in particular, pens, ink, and paper, several
parcels from the captain's, mate's, gunner's, and Carpenter's keeping, three or four compasses, some
mathematical instruments, dials, perspectives, charts,
and books of navigation, all which I huddled toge-
ther, whether I might want them or no; also I found
three very good Bibles, which came to me in my
cargo from England, and which I had packed up
among my things, some Portuguese books also, and
among them two or three Popish prayer-books, and
several other books, all of which I carefully secured.
And I must not forget that we had in the ship a dog
and two cats, of whose eminent history I may have
occasion to say something in its place, for I carried
both the cats with me, and as for the dog, he jumped
out of the ship of himself, and swam on shore to me
the day after I went on shore with my first cargo,
and was a trusty servant to me many years. I wanted
nothing that he could fetch me, nor any company
that he could make up to me, I only wanted to have
him talk to me, but that he could not do. As I ob-
served before, I found pens, ink, and paper, and I
husbanded to the utmost: and I shall show, that
while my ink lasted, I kept things very exact; but
after that was gone, I could not; for I could not
make any ink by any means that I could devise.
And this put me in mind that I wanted many things;
and of these, this of ink was one, as also a spade,
pick-axe, and shovel, to dig or remove the earth;
needles, pins, and thread; as for linen, I soon learned
to want that without much difficulty.
This want of tools made every work I did go on
heavily, and it was near a whole year before I had
entirely finished my little pale, or surrounded habi-
tation; the piles, or stakes, which were as heavy as
I could well lift, were a long time cutting and pre-
paring in the woods, and more by far in bringing
home, so that I spent sometimes two days in cutting
and bringing home one of these posts, and a third
day in driving it into the ground; for which I got a
heavy piece of wood at first, but at last bethought
myself of one of the iron crows, which, however,
though I found it, yet made driving those posts or
pales very laborious and tedious work.
But what need I have been concerned at the tedl-
ousncss of any thing I had to do, having time enough
to do it in? Nor had I any other employment, that
I could foresee, except seeking for food.
I now began to consider seriously my condition,
and the circumstance I was reduced to, and I drew
up the state of my affairs in writing, not so much to
leave them to any that were to come after me, for I
was like to have but few heirs, as to deliver my
thoughts from daily poring upon them, and afflicting
my mind; and as my reason began now to master
my despondency, I began to comfort myself as well
as I could, and to set the good against the evil, that
I might have something to distinguish my case from
worse; and I stated it very impartially, like debtor
and creditor, the comforts I enjoyed, against the
miseries I suffered, thus :—
EVIL. GoOD.
I am cast upon a horrible
desolate island, void of all
hope of recovery.
I am singled out, and se-
parated, as it were, from all
the world, to be miserable.
I am divided from man-
kind, a solitary one, banished
from human society.
I have no clothes to cover
me.
I am without any defence
or means to resist any vio-
lence of man or beast.
But I am alive, and not
drowned, as all my ship's
company was.
But I am singled out, too,
from all the ship's crew, to
be spared from death; and
he that miraculously saved
me from death, can deliver
me from this condition.
But I >un not starved, and
perishing on a barren place,
affording no sustenance.
But I am in a hot climate, where, if I . had clothes, I
could hardly wear them.
But I am cast on an island,
where I see no wild beasts
to hurt me, as I saw on the
coast of Africa; and what if I
had been shipwrecked there 1
I have no soul to speak to, But God wonderfully sent
or relieve me. the ship near enough to the
shore, that I have gotten out
so many necessary things as
will either supply my wants,
or enable me to supply my-
self, even as long as I live. i
Upon the whole, there was an undoubted testimony,
that there was scarce a condition in the world so
miserable, but there was something negative, or
something positive, to be thankful for in it; and let
this stand as a direction from the experience of the
miserable of all conditions in this world. that we may
always find in it something to comfort ourselves
from, and to set, in the description of good and evil,
on the credit ^»de of the account.
Having now brought my mind a little to relish my
condition, and giving over looking out to sea, to see
if I could spy a ship; I say, giving over these things,
I began to apply myself to accommodate my way of
living, and to make things as easy to me as I could.
I have already described my habitation, which was
a tent under the side of a rock, surrounded with a
strong pale of posts and cables, but I might rather
call it a wall, for I raised a kind of wall up against
it of turfs, about two feet thick on the outside, and
after some time (I think it was a year and a half) I
raised rafters from it, leaning to the rock, and thatch-
ed or covered it with boughs of trees, and such things
as I could get to keep out the rain, which I found at
some times of the year very violent.
I have already observed how I brought all my
goods into this pale, and into the cave which I had
made behind me; but I must observe too, that, at
first, this was a confused heap of goods, which, as they
lay in no order, so they took up all my place; I had
no room to turn myself; so I set myself to enlarge
my cave, and worked farther into the earth, for it
was a loose sandy rock, which yielded easily to the
labour I bestowed on it; and so, when I found I was pretty safe as to the beasts of prey, I worked sideways
to the right hand into the rock, and then turning to
the right again, workedquite out, and made me a door
to come out on the outside of my pale or fortification.
This gave not only egress and regress, as it was a
back way to my tent, and to my storehouse, but
gave me room to stow my goods. -
And now I began to apply myself to make such
necessary things as I found I most wanted, particu-
larly a chair and a table, for without these I was not
able to enjoy the few comforts I had in the world:
I could not write or eat, or several things, with so
much pleasure without a table.
So I went to work; and here I must needs ob-
serve, that as reason is the substance and original of
the mathematics, so by stating and squaring every
thing by reason, and by making the most rational
judgment of things, every man may be, in time,
master of every mechanic art. I had never handled
a tool in my life, and yet, in time, by labour, appli-
cation, and contrivance, I found, at last, that I could
have made any thing, especially if I had had tools;
however, I made abundance of things, even without
tools, and some with no more tools than an adze and
a hatchet, which, perhaps, were never made that way
before, and that with infinite labour. For example,
if I wanted a board, I had no other way but to cut
down a tree, set it on an edge before me, and hew it
flat on either side with my axe, till I had brought it
to be as thin as a plank, and then dub it smooth
with 'my adze. It is true, that by this method I
could make but one board out of a whole tree; but
this I had no remedy for but patience, any more than
I had for the prodigious deal of time and labour
which it took me up to make a plank or board; but
my time or labour was little worth, and so it was as
well employed one way as another.
However, I made me a table and a chair, as I ob-
served above, in the first place, and this I did out of
the short pieces of board that I brought on my raft
from the ship; but when I had wrought out some
boards, as above, I made large shelves of the breadth
of a foot and a half, one over another, all along one
side of my cave, to lay all my tools, nails, and iron-
pieces into the wall of the rock to
hang my guns, and all things that would hang up.
So that had my cave been to be seen, it looked like
a general magazine of all necessary things; and I had
every thing so ready to my hand, that it was a great
pleasure to me to see all my goods in such order, and
especially to find my stock of all necessaries so
great.
And now it was when I began to keep a iournal of
every day's employment: for, indeed, at first I was
in too much hurry, and not only hurry as to labor, but in too much discomposure of mind, and my jour-
nal would have been full of many dull things. For
example, I must have said thus:—September the 30th,
After I got on shore, and had escaped drowning, in-
stead of being thankful to God for my deliverance,
having first vomited with the great quantity of salt
water which was gotten into my stomach, and re-
covering myself a little, I ran about the shore, wring-
ing my hands, and beating my head and face, ex-
claiming at my misery, and crying out, I was undone!
undone! till, tired and faint, I was forced to lie down
on the ground to repose, but durst not sleep for fear
of being devoured.
Some days after this, and after having been on
board the ship, and got all I could out of her, yet I
could not forbear getting up to the top of a little
mountain, and looking out to sea, in hopes of seeing
a ship, then fancy at a vast distance, I spied a sail,
please myself with the hopes of it, and then, after
looking steadily till I was almost blind, lose it quite,
and sit down and weep like a child, and thus increase
my misery by my folly.
But having got over these things, in some measure,
and having settled my household stuff and habitation,
made me a table and a chair, and all as handsome
about me as I could, I began, I say, to keep my
journal, of which I shall here give you the copy
(though in it will be told all these particulars over
again), as long as it lasted, for at last having no
more ink, I was forced to leave it off.
THE JOURNAL.
September 30, 16o9.—I, poor miserable Robinson
Crusoe, being shipwrecked during a dreadful storm
in the offing, came on shore on this dismal unfortunate
island, which I called the Island of Despair, all the
rest or the ship's company being drowned, and myself almost dead.
All the rest of the day I spent in afflicting myself
at the dismal circumstances I was brought to, viz. I
had neither house, food, clothes, weapon, or place to
fly to, and nothing but death before me, either that
I should be devoured by savages, or starved to death
for want of food. At the approach of night, I slept
in a tree, for fear of wild creatures.
Oct. 1.—In the morning I saw, to my surprise, the
ship had floated with the high tide, and was driven
on shore again much nearer the island, which, as it
was some comfort on one hand, so, on the other hand,
it renewed my grief at the loss of my comrades, who,
I imagined, if we had all stayed on board, might have
saved the ship, or, at least they would not all have
been drowned, as they were; and that, had the men
been saved, we might, perhaps, have built us a
boat out of the ruins of the ship, to have carried us
to some other part of the world. Seeing the ship
almost dry, I went upon the sand as near as I could,
and then swam on board. This day continued rainy,
though with no wind at all.
From the 1st of Oct. to the 24th.—All these days
entirely spent in making several voyages to get all I could out of the ship, which I brought on shore. Much
rain also in these days, though with some intervals of
fair weather; but, it seems, this was the rainy season.
Oct. 24.—1 overset my raft, and all the goods I had got upon it, but being in shoal water, and the
things being chiefly heavy, I recovered many of them
when the tide was out.
Oct. M.-- It rained all night, and all day, with
some wind, during which time the ship broke in
pieces, and was no more to be seen, except the^reck
of her, and that only at low water. I spent this day
in covering and securing the goods which I had
saved, that the rain might not spoil them.
Oct. 20.—I walked about the shore almost all day
to find out a place to fix my habitation, greatly con-
cerned to secure myself from any attack in the night, either from beasts or men. Towards night I fixed
upon a proper place under a rock, and marked out a
semicircle for my encampment, which I resolved to
Strengthen with a wall, or fortification, made of double
piles, lined within with cable, and without with turf.
From the 2(>th to the 30th, I worked very hard in
carrying all my goods to my new habitation, though
some part of the time it rained exceeding hard.
The 31st, in the morning, I went out into the
island with my gun, to see for some food, when I
killed a she-goat, and her kid followed me home,
which I afterwards killed, because it would not eat.
Nov. 1.—I set up my tent under a rock, and lay
there for the first night, making it as large as I could,
with stakes driven in to swing my hammock upon.
Nov. 2.—I set up all my chests and boards, and
the pieces of timber which made my rafts, and with
them formed a fence round me, a little within the
place I had marked out for my fortification.
Nov. 3.—I went out with my gun, and killed two
fowls like ducks, which were very good food. In the
afternoon, went to work to make me a table.
Nov. 5.—This morning I began to order my times
of work, of going out with my gun, time of sleep, and
time of diversion; viz. every morning I walked out
with my gun, for two or three hours, if it did not
rain; then employed myself to work till about eleven
o'clock; then eat what I had to live-on ; and from
twelve to two, I lay down to sleep, the weather being
excessively hot, and then in the evening to work again.
The working part of this day and the next were
wholly employed in making my table, which I did
not finish.
Nov. 5.—This day I went abroad with my gun and
dog, and killed a wild cat, her skin pretty soft, but
her flesh good for nothing. Every creature I killed,
I took off the skins and preserved them. Coming
back, by the sea-shore, I saw many sorts of sea-
fowls which I did not understand; but was surprised
to see two or three seals, which, while I was gazing
at, got into the sea, and escaped me for that time.
Nov. 0.—After my morning walk I went to work
with my table again, and finished it, though not to
my liking; and I soon learned to mend it.
Nov. 7.—Now it began to be settled fair weather.
The 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, and part of the 12th (for the
llth was Sunday, according to my reckoning,) I took
wholly up to make me a chair, and, with much ado,
brought it to a tolerable shape, but never to please
me; and even in the making I pulled it to pieces
several times. ' Note.—I soon neglected keeping my
Sundays, for, omitting my mark for them on my post,
I forgot which was which.
Nov. 13.—This day it rained, which refreshed me
exceedingly, and cooled the earth; but it was accom-
panied with terrible thunder and lightning, which
made me fearful of my powder. When it was over,
I resolved to separate my powder into as many little
parcels as possible, to prevent danger.
Nov. 14,15, IB.—These threcdays I spent in making
little square chests or boxes, which might hold about
a pound, or two, of powder; and so putting the pow-
der in, I stowed it away in places as secure and re-
mote from one another as possible. On one of these
three days I killed a large bird that was good to eat,
but I knew not what to call it.
Nov. 17.—This day I began to dig behind my tent
into the rock, to make room for my farther conveni-
ency. Note.—Three things I wanted exceedingly
for this work, viz. a pick-axe, a shovel, and a wheel-
barrow, or basket. As for the pick-axe, I made use
of the iron crows, which were proper enough, though
heavy; but the next thing was a shovel or spade;
this was so absolutely necessary, that indeed I could
do nothing effectually without it, but what kind of
one to make I knew not.
Nov. 18.—The next day, in searching the woods, I found a tree of that wood, or like it, which, in the
Brazils, they call the iron-tree, for its exceeding
hardness; of this I cut a piece, and brought it home
with difficulty, for it was exceeding heavy. The ex-
cessive hardness of the wood made me along while
upon this machine, but I worked it effectually by
little and little, into the form of a shovel or spade,
the handle exactly shaped like ours in England, only
that the broad part having no iron shod upon it at
bottom, would not last me so long; however, it
served well enough for the uses which I had occasion
to put it to. I was still deficient, for I wanted a
basket, or a wheelbarrow; A basket I could not
make by any means, having no such thing as twigs
that would bend to make wicker-ware; and, as to
the wheelbarrow, I fancied I could make all but the
wheel; but that I had no notion of, neither did I
know how to go about it, so I gave it over: and so,
for carrying away the earth which I dug out of the
cave, I made me a thing like a hod, which the labour-
ers carry mortar in to serve the bricklayers. This
was not so difficult to me as the making the shovel;
and yet this, and the shovel, and the attempt which
J made in vain to make a wheelbarrow, took me up
no less than four days: I mean always, excepting
my morning walk with my gun, which I seldom
failed, and nearly always brought something home
fit to eat.
Nov. 23.—My other work having stood still because
of my making these tools, when they were finished I went on; and, working every day as my time and
strength allowed, I spent eighteen days entirely in
widening and keeping my cave, that it might hold
my goods commodiously. Note.—During all this
time, I worked to make this room, or cave, spacious
enough to accommodate me as a warehouse or maga-
zine, a kitchen, a dining-room, and a cellar: as for a
lodging, I kept to the tent, except that sometimes
in the wet season of the year it rained so hard, that
I could not keep myself dry; which caused me after-
wards to cover all my place within my pale with long
poles, in the form of rafters, leaning against the rock,
and load them with flags, and large leaves of trees,
like a thatch.
Dec. 10.—I began now to think my cave or vault
finished, when, on a sudden, a. great quantity of
earth fell down from the top and one side, so much
that, in short/it frighted me, and not without reason
too; for if I had been under it, I should never have
wanted a grave-digger. Upon this disaster, I had a
great deal of work to do over again; for I had the
loose earth to carry out, and, which was of more
importance, I had the ceiling to prop up, so that I might be sure no more would come down.
Dec. 11.—This day I went to work with it accord-
ingly, and got two shores, or posts, pitched upright
to the top, with two pieces of boards across over
each post. This I finished the next day; and setting
more posts up with boards, in about a week more I had the roof secured; and the posts^ standing in rows,
served me for partitions to part offmy house.
Dec. 10.—From this day to the 20th 1 placed
f
shelves, and knocked nails into the posts, to hang
every thing up that could be hung up.
Dec. 23.—Now I carried every thing into the cave,
and began to furnish my house, and set up some
pieces of boards like a dresser, to order my victuals
upon; but boards began to be very scarce with me.
Made another table.
Dec. 24,25.—Much rain both these days, and no
stirring out.
Dec. 26.—No rain, and the earth rather cooler
than before, and pleasanter.
Dec. 27.—Killed a young goat, and lamed another,
so that I catched it, and led it home in a string, and
bound and splintered its leg, which was broke. N. B.—I took such care of it that it lived, and the
leg grew well, and as strong as ever; but by nursing
it so long it grew tame, and fed upon the little green
at my door, and would not go away. This was the
first time that I entertained a thought of breeding
up some tame creatures, that I might have food
when my powder and shot was all spent.
Dec. 28, 20,00.—Great heats and no breeze, so that
there was no stirring abroad, except in the evening
for food. This time I spent in putting all my things
in order within doors.
Jan. 1.—Very hot still; but I went abroad early
and late with my gun, and lay still in the middle of
the day. This evening, going farther into the valleys,
which lay to the centre of the island, I found there
were plenty of goats, though exceeding shy, and hard
to come at: however, I resolved to try if I could not
bring my dog to hunt them down.
Jan. 2.—Accordingly the next day I went out with
my dog, and set him upon the goats, but they all
faced about upon the dog, and he knew his danger
too well, for he would not come near them.
Jan. 3.—I began my fence or wall, which, to pre-
vent attack, I resolved to make very thick and strong.
[N. B.—This wall being described before, I pur-
posely omit what was said in the journal: it is nuffi-
cient to observe, that I was no less than from the 3d
of Jan. to the 14th of April, working, finishing, and
perfecting this wall, though it was no more than
about 24 yards in length, being a half circle, from one
place in the rock to another place about eight yards
from it, the door of the cave being in the centre
behind it]
Al l this time I worked very hard, the rains hin-
dering me many days, nay, sometimes weeks toge-
ther; but I thought I should never be perfectly
secure till this wall was finished: and it is scarce cre-
dible what inexpressible labour every thing was done
with, especially bringing piles out of the woods, and
driving them into the ground, for I made them much
bigger than I needed to have done.
When this wall was finished, and the outside double
fenced, with a turf wall raised up close to it, I per-
suaded myself, that if any people were to come on
shore there, they would not perceive any thing like
a habitation: and it was very well I did so, as may
be observed hereafter, upon a remarkable occasion.
During this time I made' my rounds in the woods
for game every day, when the rain permitted me,
and made frequent discoveries in these walks of some-
thing or other to my advantage; particularly I found
a kind of wild pigeons, which built not as wood-
pigeons in a tree, but rather as house-pigeons, in the
holes of the rocks; and taking some young ones, I
endeavoured to bring them up tame, and did so; but
when they grew older, they all flew away, which
perhaps was at first for want of feeding them, for I
had nothing to give them; however, I frequently
found their nests, and got their young ones, which
were very good meat.
And now, in the managing my household affairs,
I found myself wanting many things which I thought
at first impossible for me to make, as indeed as to
'some of them it was: for instance, I could never make
F 2
as I observed before, but I could never arrive to the
capacity of making one by them, though I spent many
weeks about it; I could neither put in the heads, or
join the staves so true to one another, as to make
them hold water, so I gave that also over.
In the next place, I was at a great loss for can-
dles, so that when it was dark, which was generally
by seven o'clock, I was obliged to go to bed. I re-
membered the lump of bees wax with which I made
candles in my African adventure, but I had none of
that now: the only remedy I had was, that when I
had killed a goat, I saved the tallow, and with a little
dish made of clay, which I baked in the sun, to which
I added a wick of some oakum, I made me a lamp;
and this gave me light, though not a clear steady
light like a candle. In the middle of all my labours.
it happened, that, rummaging my things, I found a
little bag, which, as I hinted before, had been filled
with corn, for the feeding of poultry, not for this veryage, but before, as I suppose, when the ship came
from Lisbon; what little remainder of corn had been
in the bag was all devoured by the rats, and I saw
nothing in the bag but husks and dust; and being
willing to have the bag for some other use (I think it
was to put powder in, when I divided it for fear of
the lightning, or some such purpose), I shook the
husks of corn out of it, on one side of my fortification
under the rock.
It was a little before the great rains, just now men-
tioned, that I threw this stuff away, taking no notice
of any thing, and not so much as remembering that I
had thrown away there; when, about a month after, or
thereabouts, I saw some stalks of something green
shooting up on the ground, which I fancied might be
some plant, I had not seen; but I was surprised, and
perfectly astonished, when, after a little longer time,
I saw about ten or twelve ears come out, which were
perfect green barley, the same as English barley.
It is impossible to express the astonishment and
confusion of my thoughts on this occasion; I had
hitherto acted upon no religious foundation at all;
indeed, I had very few notions of religion in my head,
nor had entertained any sense of any thing that had
befallen me, otherwise than as a chance, or, as we
lightly say, what pleases God; without so much as
inquiring into the end of Providence in these things,
or his order in governing events in the world; but,
after I saw barley grow there, in a climate which I
knew was not proper for corn, and especially that I
knew not how it came there, it startled me strangely,
and I began to suggest that God had miraculously
caused this grain to grow, without any help of seed
sown, and that it was so directly purely for my sus-
tenance in that wild miserable place.
This touched my heart a little, and brought tears
out of my eyes, and I began to bless myself that such
a prodigy of nature should happen upon my account;
and this was the more strange to me, because I saw
near it still, all along by the side of the rock, some
other straggling stalks which proved to be stalks of
rice, and which I knew, because I had seen it grow in
Africa, when I was ashore there.
I not only thought these the pure productions of
Providence for my support, but, not doubting but
that there was more in the place, I went all over that
part of the island where I had been before, peering
m every corner, and under every rock, to see for more
of it, but I could not find any; at last it occurred to
my thoughts that I had shaken the bag of chicken's
meat out in that place, and then the wonder began to
cease; and I must confess, my religious thankfulness
to God's providence began to abate too, upon my dis-
covering that all this was nothing but what was com-
mon, though I ought to have been as thankful for so
strange and unforeseen providence as if it had been
miraculous; for it was really the work of Providence to me, that should appoint that ten or twelve grains
of corn should remain unspoiled (when the rats had
destroyed all the rest), as if it had been dropped from
heaven; as also that I should throw it out in that par-
ticular place, where, it being in the shade of a high
rock, it sprang up immediately; whereas, if I had
thrown it any where else at that time, it had been
burnt up and destroyed.
I carefully saved the ears of this corn, you may
be sure, in their season, which was about the end of
June; and laying up every corn, I resolved to sow
them all again, hoping in time to have some quantity
sufficient to supply me with bread: but it was not
till the fourth year that I would allow myself the
least grain of this corn to eat, and even then but spa-
ringly, for I lost all I sowed the first season by not
observing the proper time, for I sowed just before the
dry season, so that it never came up at all, at least
not as it would have done.
Besides this barley, there were, as above, twenty
or thirty stalks of rice, which I preserved with the
same care, and whose use was of the same kind, or
to the same purpose; viz. to make me bread, or rather
food; for I found ways to cook it up without baking,
though I did that also, after some time. But to re-
turn to my journal.
I worked excessive hard these three or four months
to get my wall done; and the 14th of April I closed
it up, contriving to go into it, not by a door, but over
a wall by a ladder, that there might be no sign on the
outside of my habitation.
April 16.—I finished the ladder, so I went up with
it to the top, and then pulled it up after me, and
let it down on the inside. This was a complete
enclosure to me; for within I had room enough, and
nothing could come at me from without, unless it
could first mount my wall.
The very next day after this wall was finished, I had almost had all my labour overthrown at once, and
myself killed. The case was this: as I was busy in the inside of it, behind my tent, just at the entrance
into my cave, I was terribly frighted with a most
dreadful surprising thing indeed, for all on a sudden,
I found the earth came tumbling down from the roof
of my cave, and from the edge of the hill over my
head, and two of the posts I had set up in the cave
cracked in a frightful manner. I was heartily scared
but thought nothing of what really was the cause,
and, for fear I should be buried in it, I ran forward to my ladder; and, not thinking myself safe there
neither, I got over my wall for fear of the pieces of
the hill, which I expected might roll down upon me.
I was no sooner stepped down upon the firm ground,
but I plainly saw it was a terrible earthquake; for
the ground I stood on shook three times, at about
eight minutes distance, with three such shocks as
would have overturned the strongest building that
could be supposed to have stood upon the earth; and
a great piece of the top of a rock, which stood about
half a mile from me next the sea, fell down with
such a terrible noise as I never heard in all my life.
I perceived also the very sea was put into a violent
motion by it, and I believe the shocks were stronger
under the water than on the island.
I was so amazed with the thing itself, having never
felt the like, or discoursed with any one that had,
that I was like one dead or mangled; and the motion
of the earth made my stomach sick, like one that was
tossed at sea; but the noise of the falling of the rock
awakened me, as it were, and, rousing me from the
stupefied condition I was in, filled me with horror, and
I thought of nothing then but the hill falling upon
my tent, and all my household goods, and burying all
at once; and this sunk my soul within me again.
After the third shock was over, and I felt no
more for some time, I began to take courage.
and yet I had not heart enough to get over my wall
again, for fear of being buried alive; but still sat
upon the ground, greatly cast down, and disconsolate,
not knowing what to do. All this while I had not
the least serious religious thought, nothing but the
common " Lord, have mercy upon me!" and when
it was over, that went away too.
While I sat thus, I found the air overcast, and it
grew cloudy, as if it would rain; and, in less than an
hour, it blew a most dreadful hurricane of wind. The
sea was all on a sudden covered with foam and froth,
the shore was covered with the breach of the water,
the trees were torn up by the roots, and a terrible
storm it was; this held about three hours, and then
began to abate; and then in two hours more it was
calm, and began to rain very hard.
All this while I sat upon the ground, very much
terrified and dejected; when, on a sudden, it came
into my thoughts that these winds and rain, being
the consequence of the earthquake, the earthquake
itself was spent and over, and I might venture into
my cave again. With this thought my spirits began
to revive, and the rain helping also to persuade me,
I went in, and sat me down in my tent, but the rain
was so violent, that my tent was ready to be beaten
down by it, I was forced to go into my cave, though
very much afraid. for fear it should fall on my head.
This violent rain forced me to a new work, viz. to cut
a hole through my new fortification like a sink, to let
the water go out, which would else have filled my
cave. After I had been in my cave some time, and
found still no more shocks of the earthquake follow,) began to be more composed; and now, to support my
spirits, which indeed wanted it very much, I went to
my little store, and took a small sup of rum, which I did very sparingly, knowing I could have no more.
It continued raining all that night, and great part
of the next day, so that I could not stir abroad; but,
my mind being more composed, I began to think
what I had best do; concluding that if the island
was subject to these earthquakes, there would be no
living for me in a cave, but I must consider of building
me a little hut, In an open place, which I might sur-
round with a wall, as I had done here, and so make
myself secure from wild beasts or men, but concluded,
if I staid where I was, I should be buried alive.
With these thoughts, I resolved to move my tent,
from the place where it stood, which was just under
the hanging precipice of the hill, and which, if it
should be shaken again, would certainly fall upon my
tent. And I spent the two next days, being the 19th
and 20th of April, in contriving where and how to
remove my habitation.
The fear of being swallowed up alive made me that
I never slept in quiet; but still, when I looked about,
and saw how every thing was put in order, how plea-
santly concealed I was, and how safe from danger, it
made me very loath to remove.
In the mean time it occurred to me, that it would
require a vast deal of time for me to do this, and that
I must be contented to rim the venture where I was,
till I had formed a camp for myself, and had secured
it so as to remove to it. So, with this resolution, I composed my self for a time, and resolved that I would
go to work, with all speed, to build me a wall with
piles and cables, &c. in a circle as before, and set my
tent up in it when it was finished; but that I would
venture to stay where I was till it was finished, and
fit to remove to. This was.the 21st.
April 22.—The next morning I began to consider of
means to put this resolve in execution; but I was at
a great loss about my tools. I had three large axes,
and abundance of hatchets, but with much chopping
and cutting knotty wood, they were all full of notches,
and dull; and though I had a grindstone, I could not
turn it, and grind my tools too. At length, I con-
trived a wheel, with a string, to turn it with my foot,
that I might have both my hands at liberty. Mote.—
I had not seen any such thing in England, or at least
not to take notice how it was done, though since I have observed, it is very common there. This
machine cost me a full week's work to bring it to
perfection.
April 28,29.—These two whole days I took up in
grinding tools; my machine for turning my grind-
stone performing very well.
April 30.—Having perceived my bread had been
low a great while, I reduced myself to one biscuit
cake a day, which made my heart very heavy.
May 1.—In the morning, looking towards the sea-
side, the tide being low, I saw something lie on the
sea-shore, bigger than ordinary, and it looked like a
cask: when I came to it, I found a small barrel, and
two or three pieces of the wreck of the ship, that
were driven on shore by the hurricane, and looking
towards the wreck itself, I thought it seemed to lie
higher out of the water than it used to do. I ex-
amined the barrel which was driven on shore, and
soon found it was a barrel of gunpowder, but it had
taken water, and the powder was caked as hard as a
stone; however, I rolled it farther on shore for the
present, and went on upon the sands, as near as I could to the wreck of the ship, to look for more.
When I came down to the ship, I found it strangely
removed: the forecastle, which lay before buried in
the sand, was heaved up at least six feet; and the
stern, which was broken to pieces, and parted from
the rest by the force of the sea, soon after I had left
rummaging of her, was tossed, as it were up, and cast
on one side; and the sand was thrown so high on that
side next the stern, that I could now walk quite up
to her when the tide was out. I was surprised with
this at first, but soon concluded it must be done by
the earthquake, and as by this violence the ship was
more broken open than formerly, so many things
came daily on shore, which the sea had loosened, arid
which the winds and water rolled by degrees to land.
This wholly diverted my thoughts from the design
of removing my habitation; I busied myself mightily
that day especially, in searching whether I could get
into the ship; but I found nothing was to be expected
of that kind, for all the inside of the ship was choked
up with sand. However, I resolved to pull every
thing to pieces that I could of the ship, concluding
that every thing I could get from her would be useful.
May 3.—I began with my saw, and cut a piece of
a beam through, which I thought held some of the
upper part, or quarter-deck, together; and when I had cut it through, I cleared away the sand as well
as I could from the side which lay highest, but the
tide coming in, I was obliged to give over.
May 4.—I went a fishing, but caught not one fish
that I durst eat of, till I was weary of my sport, when
just going to leave off, I caught a young dolphin. I had made me a long line of some rope yarn, but I had
no hooks; yet I frequently caught as much fish as
I cared to eat; which I dried in the sun, and eat dry.
May 5.—Worked on the wreck, cut another beam
asunder, and brought three great fir planks off from
the decks, which I tied together, and made swim to
shore when the tide of flood came on.
May 6.—Worked on the wreck, got several iron
bolts out of her, and other pieces of iron work.
May 7.—Went to the wreck again, but with an
intent not to work; but found the weight of the
wreck had broken itself down, the beams being cut,
that several pieces of the ship seemed to lie loose, and
the inside of the hold lay so open, that I could see
into it; but almost full of water and sand.
May 8.—Went to the wreck, and carried an iron
crow to wrench up the deck, which lay now quite
clear of the water or sand. I wrenched open two
planks, and brought them on shore also with the tide.
I left the iron crow in the wreck for next day.
May 9.—Went to the wreck, and with the crow
made way into the body of the wreck, and felt several
casks, and loosened them with the crow; but could
not break them up. I felt also the roll of English
lead, but it was too heavy to move
May 10, 11, 12, 13,Lt.--. Went every day to the"
wreck and got many pieces of timber and boards, or
planks, and two or three hundred weight of iron.
May 15.—I carried two hatchets, to try if I could
not cut a piece off the roll of lead, by placing the edge
of one hatchet, and driving it with the other; but as
it lay about a foot and a half in the water, I could
not make any blow to drive the hatchet.
May 10.—It blew hard in the night, and the wreck
appeared more broken by the force of the water; but
I stayed so long in the woods to get pigeons for food,
that the tide proventedme going to the wreck that day.
May 17.—I saw some pieces of the wreck blown on
shore, at a great distance, two miles off me; but re-
solved to see what they were, and found it was a piece
of the head, but too heavy for me to bring away.
May 24.—Every day, to this day, I worked on the
wreck, and with hard labour I loosened some things
so much with the crow, that the first flowing tide
several casks floated out, and two of the .seamen's
chests; but the wind blowing from the shore, nothing
came to land that day but pieces of timber, and a
hogshead that had some Brazil pork in it, but the
salt water and the sand had spoiled it.
I continued this work every day to the 15th of June,
except the time necessary to get food; and, by this
time, I had gotten timber and plank, and iron work
enough to have built a good boat, if I had known
how; and also I got at several times, and in several
pieces, near one hundred weight of the sheet lead.
June 16.—Going down to the seaside, I found a
large tortoise or turtle; this was the first I had seen,
which, it seems, was only my misfortune, not any
defect of the place, or scarcity; for, had I happened
to be on the other side of the island, I might have
had hundreds of them every day, as I found afterward;
but, perhaps, had paid dear enough for them.
June 17.—I spent in cooking the turtle. I found
in her threescore eggs; and her flesh was to me at
that time the most savoury and pleasant that ever I tasted in my life, having had no flesh but of goats and
fowls, since I landed in this horrible place.
June 18.—Rained all day, and I staid within. The
rain at this time felt cold, and I was something chilly,
which I knew was not usual in that latitude.
June 19.—Very ill, and shivering, as if the weather
had been cold.
June 2(1.—No rest all night; violent pains in my
head, and feverish.
June 21.—Very ill> frighted almost to death with
the apprehensions of my sad condition, to be sick,
and no help. Prayed to God for the first time since
the storm off Hull; but scarce knew what I said, or
why; my thoughts being all confused.
June 22.—A little better; but under dreadful ap-
prehensions of sickness.
June m..--. Very bad again, cold and shivering, and
then a violent headache. June 24.—Much better.
June 25.—An ague very violent; the fit held me
seven hours, cold fit and hot, with faint sweats after it.
June 26.—Better; and having no victuals to eat,
took my gun, but found myself very weak; however,
I killed a she-goat, and, with much difficulty, got it
home, and broiled some, and eat it.
June 27.—The ague again so violent, GU 1 lay
a-bed all day, and neither eat nor drank, I was ready
to perish with thirst, but so weak, I had not strength
to stand up, or get myself any water to drink; prayed
to God again, but was light-headed; and when I was
not, I was so ignorant, that I knew not what to say:
only 1 lay, and cried, "Lord, look upon me! Lord,
pity me! Lord, have mercy upon me!" I suppose
I did nothing else for two or three hours, till the fit
wearing off, I fell asleep, and did not wake till far in
the night. When I waked, I found myself much
refreshed, but weak, and exceedingly thirsty; how-
ever, as I had no water in my whole habitation, I was forced to lie till morning, and went to sleep again.
In this second sleep I had this terrible dream:—
I thought that I was sitting on the ground, on the
outside of my wall, where I sat when the storm blew
after the earthquake, and that I saw a man descend
from a great black cloud, in a bright flame of fire,
and light upon the ground. He was all over as
bright as a flame, so that I could but just bear to look
towards him; his countenance was most inexpressibly
dreadful; impossible for words to describe; when he
stepped upon the ground with kis feet, I thought the
earth trembled, just as it had done before the earth-
quake, and all the air looked, to my apprehension, as
if it had been filled with flashes of fire.
He was no sooner landed upon the earth, but he
moved forward towards me, with a long spear or
weapon in his hand, to kill me; and when he came
to a rising ground, at some distance, he spoke to me,
or I heard a voice so terrible, that it is impossible to
express the terror of it; all that I can say I under-
stood was this :—" Seeing all these things have not
brought thee to repentance, now thou shalt die." At
which words, I thought he lifted up the spear that
was in his hand, to kill me.
No one that shall ever read this account, will ex-
pect that I should be able to describe the horrors of
my soul at this terrible vision; I mean, that even
while it was a dream, I even dreamed of those hor-
rors; nor is it any more possible to describe the
impression that remained upon my mind when I awaked, and found it was but a dream.
I had, alas! no Divine knowledge; what I had re-
ceived by the good instruction of my father, was then
worn out by an uninterrupted series, for eight years,
of seafaring wickedness, and a constant conversation
with none but such as were like myself, wicked and
profane to the last degree. I do not remember that
I had, in all that time, one thought so much as tended
either to looking upwards towards God, or inwards
towards a reflection upon my own ways; but a cer-
tain stupidity of soul, without desire of good, or con-
science of evil, had entirely overwhelmed me, and
I was all that the most hardened, unthinking, wicked
creature among our common sailors can be supposed
to be, not having the least sense either of the fear of
God in dangers, or of thankfulness in deliverance.
In relating what is already past in my story, this
will be more easily believed, when I shall add, that,
through all the variety of miseries that had to this
day befallen me, I never had so much as one thought
of its being the hand of God, or that it was a just
punishment for my past sins, my rebellious behaviour
to my father, or my present sins, which were great; or
so much as a punishment for the general course of
my wicked life. When I was on the desperate ex-
pedition on the desert shores of Africa, I never had
so much as one thought of what would become of
me, or one wish to God to direct me whither I should
go, or to keep me from the danger which apparently
surrounded me, as well from voracious creatures as
cruel savages; but I was merely thoughtless of God,
or a providence; I acted like a mere brute, from the
principles of nature, and by the dictates of common
sense only, and indeed hardly that.
When I was delivered and taken up at sea by the
Portugal captain, well used, and dealt justly and
honourably with, as well as charitably, I had not the
least thankfulness in my thoughts; when,again^ I was
shipwrecked, ruined, and in danger of drowning on
this island, I was as far from remorse on looking on
it as a judgment, I only said to myself often, that I was an unfortunate dog, and born to be miserable.
It is true, when I got on shore first here, and found
all my ship's crew drowned, and myself spared, I was surprised with a kind of ecstacy and some trans-
ports of soul, which, had the grace of God assisted,
might have come up to true thankfulness; but it
ended where it begun, in a mere common flight of joy,
or, as I may say, being glad I was alive, without the.
least reflection upon the distinguishing goodness of
the hand which had preserved me, ana had singled
me out to be preserved, when the rest were destroyed,
or an inquiry why Providence had been thus merciful
to me: even just the same common sort of joy which
seamen generally have, after having got safe ashore
from a shipwreck, which they drown in the next
bowl of punch, and forget almost as soon as it is over.
Even when I was afterward, on due consideration,
made sensible of my condition, how I was cast on
this dreadful place out of the reach of human kind,
out of all hopes of relief, or prospect of redemption,
as soon as I saw a probability of living, and that I should not starve and perish for hunger, all the sense
of my affliction wore off, and I began to be very easy,
applied myself to the works proper for my preser-
vation and supply, and was far enough from being
afflicted at my condition; as a judgment from Heaven
or as the hand of God against me, these thoughts
very seldom entered into my head.
The growing up of the corn, hinted in my journal,
had at first some little influence upon me, and began
to affect me with seriousness, as long as I thought it
had something miraculous in it; but as soon as ever
that part of the thought was removed, all the im-
pression which was raised from it, wore off also.
Even the earthquake, though nothing could be
more terrible in its nature, or more immediately
directing to the invisible power which alone directs
such things, yet no sooner was the first fright over,
but the impression it had made went off also.
But now when I began to be sick, and a leisurely
view of the miseries of death came to place itself
before me; when my spirits began to sink under the
burden of a strong distemper, and nature was ex-
hausted by the violence of the fever; conscience, that
had slept so long, began to awake, and I began to re-
proach myself with my past life.
These reflections oppressed me from the second or
third day of my distemper, and, in the violence as
well of the fever as of the dreadful reproaches of my
conscience, extorted some words from me, like pray-
ing to God, though I cannot say they were either a
prayer attended with desires, or with hopes; it was
rather the voice of mere fright and distress; my
thoughts were confused, the convictions great upon
my mind, and the horror of dying in such a miserable
condition, raised vapours in my head, with the mere
apprehensions; and in these hurries of my soul, I knew not what my tongue might express; but it was
rather ;exclamations, such as " Lord, what a mise-
rable creature am I ? If I should be sick, I shall cer-
tainly die for want of help; and what will become of
me! Then the tears burst out of my eyes, and I could say no more for a good while.
In this interval, the good advice of my father came
to my mind, and presently his prediction, which I mentioned at the beginning of this story; viz. That,
if I did take this foolish step, God would not bless
me, and I would have leisure hereafter to reflect upon
having neglected his counsel, when there might be
none to assist me in my recovery. "Now," said 1,
aloud, "my dear father's words are come to pass;
God's justice has overtaken me, and I have none to
help or hear me. I rejected the voice of Providence,
which had mercifully put me in a posture or station
of life wherein I might have been happy and easy,
but I would neither see it myself, nor learn to know
the blessing of it from my parents; I left them to
mourn over my folly, and now I am left to mourn the
consequences of it. I refused their help and assist-
ance, who would have lifted me into the world, and
would have made every thing easy to me; and now I have difficulties to struggle with, too great for even
nature itself to support, and no assistance, no help,
no comfort, no advice." Then I cried out, " Lord, be
my help, for I am in great distress!"
This was the first prayer, if I might call it so, that
I had made for many years. But to return to my
journal.
June 28.—Having been somewhat refreshed with
the sleep I had had, and the fit being entirely off, I got up, and the fright and terror of my disease was
very great, yet I considered that the fit of the ague
would return the next day; and now was my time to
get something to refresh and support myself when I should be ill; and the first thing I did I filled a large
square ease bottle with water, and set it upon a table
near my bed, and to take off the chill or agueish dis-
position of the water, I put about a quarter of a pint
of rum into it, and mixed them together; then I got
me a piece of the goat's flesh, and broiled it on the
coals, but could eat very little; I walked about, but
was very weak, and withal, very sad and heavy-
hearted in the sense of my miserable condition, and
dreading the return of my distemper the next day;
at night I made my supper of three of the turtle's eggs,
which I roasted in the ashes, and eat, as we call it,
in the shell; and this was the first bit of meat I ever
asked God's blessing to.
After I had eaten, I tried to walk, but found my-
self so weak, that I could hardly carry the gun (for I never went out without that), so I went but a little
way, and sat down upon the ground, looking out upon
the sea, which was just before me, and very calm and
smooth. As I sat, these thoughts occurred to me.
What is this earth and sea, of which I have seen so
much? When is it produced? And what am I , and
all the other creatures, wild and tame, human and
brutal; whence are we?
Sure we are made by some secret power, who formed
the earth and sea, the air and sky; and who is that?
Then it followed most naturally—it is God that has
made it all. Well, but then, it came on strongly—if
God has made these things, he guides and governs
them all, and all things that concern them; for the
being that could make all things, must have power
to guide and direct them.
If so, nothing can happen in the circuit of his works
without his knowledge or appointment.
And if nothing happens without his knowledge, he
knows that I am here, and am in this dreadful con-
dition; and if nothing happens without his appoint-
ment, he has appointed this to befall me.
Nothing occurred to my thoughts to contradict any
of these conclusions j and therefore it rested upon
me with the greater force, that it must needs be, that
God has appointed all this to befall me; that I was
brought to this miserable circumstance by his direc-
tion; he having the sole power, not of me only, but
of every thing that happened in the world. Imme-
diately'it followed—Why has God done this to me?
What have I done to be thus used?
My conscience presently checked me in that in-
quiry, as if I had blasphemed; and, methought it
spoke to me like a voice,—Wretch! dost thou ask
what thou hast done 1 Look back upon thy dreadful
mis-spent life, and ask thyself what thou hast done?
Ask why is it that thou wert not long ago destroyed?
Why wert thou not drowned in Yarmouth Roads?
killed in the fight, when the ship was taken by the
Sallee man of war? devoured by wild beasts on the
coast of Africa? or, drowned here, when all the crew
perished but thyself? Dost thou ask,—What have I done?
I was struck dumb with these reflections, as one
astonished, and had not a word to say in answer to
myself, but rose up, pensive and sad, walked back to
my retreat, and went up over my wall, as if I had
been going to bed; but my thoughts were sadly dis-
turbed, and I had no inclination to sleep, so I sat in
my chair, and lighted my lamp, for it began to be
dark. Now, as the apprehensions of the return of my
distemper terrified me very much, it occurred to my
thought that the Brazilians take no physic but their
o 2
tobacco, for almost all distempers; and I had a piece
of a roll of tobacco in one of the chests, which was
cured, and some also that was green, and not cured.
I went, directed by Heaven, no doubt, for in this
chest I found a cure for soul and body. I opened the
chest, and found what I looked for, viz. the tobacco:
and as the few books I had saved lay there too, I took
out one of the Bibles, which I had mentioned before,
and which, to this time, I had not found leisure, or so
much inclination, to look into; I say I took it out,
and brought both that and the tobacco to the table.
What use to make of the tobacco I knew not, but
I tried several experiments with it, as if I was re-
solved it should hit one way or other. I first took a
piece of a leaf, and chewed it in my mouth, which,
indeed, at "first, stupified my brains; the tobacco
being green and strong, and that I had not been much
used to it; then I took some, and steeped it an hour
or two in rum, and resolved to take a dose of it when
I lay down; and lastly, I burnt some upon a pan of
coals, and held my nose close over the smoke of it.
as long as I could bear it, as well for the heat as for
the virtue of it, and I held it almost to suffocation.
In the interval of this operation, I took up a Bible, and began to read; but my head was too much dis-
turbed with the tobacco, to bear reading, at least at
that time; only, having opened the book casually, the
first words that occurred to me were these, " Call on
me in the day of trouble, and I will deliver thee, and
thou shalt glorify me."
The words were very apt to my case, and made
some impression on me at the time of reading them, .
though not so muchfas they did afterwards; for, as
for being delivered, the word had no sound, as I may
say, to me, the thing was so remote, so impossible in
my apprehension of things, that I began to say as
the children of Israel did, when they were promised
flesh to eat, "Can God spread a table in the wilder-
ness?" So I began to say, Can God Himself deliver
me from this place? But, however, the words made
a great impression upon me, and I mused upon them
very often. It grew now late, and the tobacco had,
as I said, dozed my head so much, that I inclined to
sleep; so I left my lamp burning in the cave, lest I
should want any thing m the night, and went to bed;
but before I lay down, I did what I never had done in
all my life, I kneeled down, and prayed to God to fulfil
the promise to me, that, if I called upon him in the day
of trouble, he would deliver me. After my broken and
imperfect prayer was over, I drank the rum in which
I had steeped the tobacco, which was so strong and
rank of the tobacco, that, indeed, I could scarcely get
it down. Immediately upon this I went to bed, and
I found presently it flew up into my head violently;
but I fell into a sound sleep, and waked no more, till,
by the sun, it must necessarily be near three o'clock
in the afternoon, the next day; nay, to this hour, I
am partly of opinion that I slept all the next day and
night, and till almost three the day after, for other-
wise I knew not how I should lose a day out of my
reckoning in the days of the week, as it appeared,
some years after, I had done; for if I had lost it by
crossing and recrossing the line, I should have lost
more than one day; but certainly, I lost a day in my
account, and I never knew which way.
Be that, however, one way or the other, when I awaked I found myself exceedingly refreshed, and
my spirits lively and cheerful. When I got up I was
stronger than I was the day before, and my stomach
better, for I was hungry, and, in short, I had no fit
the next day, but continued much altered for the
better. This was the 29th.
The 30th was my well day, of course, and I went
abroad with my gun, but did not care to travel too
far. I killed a sea-fowl or two, something like a
brand goose, and brought them home, but was not
very forward to eat them, so I eat some more of the
turtle's eggs, which were very good. This evening I renewed the medicine, which I had supposed did me
good the day before, viz. the tobacco steeped in rum,
only I did not take so much as before, nor did I chew
any of the leaf, or hold my head over the smoke.
However, I was not so well the next day, which was
the 1st of July.
July 2.—1' renewed the medicine all the three
ways, and dosed myself with it as at first, and doubled
the quantity which I drank.
July 3.-—I missed the fit for good and all, though I
did not recover my full strength for some weeks after.
While I was thus gathering strength, my thoughts
ran exceedingly upon this passage in Scripture, "I will deliver thee," and the impossibility of my deli-
verance lay upon my mind, in bar of my ever expecting
it. But as I was discouraging myself with such
thoughts, it occurred to my mind, that I pored so
much upon my deliverance from the main affliction,
that I disregarded the deliverance I had received;
and I was, as it were, made to ask myself such
questions as these, viz. Have I not been delivered,
and wonderfully too, from sickness; from the most
distressed condition that could be, and that was so
frightful to me? And what notice had I taken of it?
Had I done my part? God had delivered me; but
I had not glorified him! that is to say, I had not
owned and been thankful for that as a deliverance;
and how could I expect greater deliverance. This
touched my heart very much, and immediately I kneeled down, and gave God thanks aloud, for my
recovery from sickness.
July 4.—In the morning, I took the Bible', and
beginning at the New Testament, I began seriously
to read it, and imposed upon myself to read a while
every morning and every night, not tying myself to
a number of chapters, but as long as my thoughts
should engage me. It was not long after I set seri-
ously to this work, but I found my heart more deeply
and sincerely affected with the sins of my past life.
The impression of my dream revived, and the words
"All these things have not brought thee to repent-
ance," ran seriously in my thoughts. I was earnestly
begging of God to give me repentance, when it hap-
pened providentially, the very day, that, reading the
Scriptures, I came to the words, "He is exalted a
Prince and a Saviour, to give repentance, and to give
remission." I threw down the book, and, with my
heart as well as my hands lifted up to Heaven, in a
kind of ecstasy of joy, I cried out aloud, " Jesus, thou
Son of David, Jesus, thou exalted Prince and Saviour,
give me repentance!"
This was the first time that I could say, in the
true sense of the word, that I prayed in all my life.
for now I prayed with a sense of my condition, and
with a true Scripture view of hope, founded on the
encouragement of the word of God; and from this
time, I may say, I began to have hope that God
would hear me.
Now I began to construe the words mentioned
above, "Calf on me, and I will deliver thee," in a
different sense from what I had ever done before:
for then I had no notion of any thing being called
deliverance, but my being delivered from the captivity
I was in; for though, indeed, I was at large in the
place, yet the island was certainly a prison to me,
and that in the fullest sense of the word; but now I
learned to take it in another sense. Now, I looked
back on my past life with such horror, and my sins
appeared so dreadful, that my soul sought nothing
of God but deliverance from the load of guilt that
bore down all my comfort. As for my solitary life
it was nothing; I did not so much as pray to be de-
livered from it, or think of it; it was all of no con-
sideration in comparison of this ; and I add this part
here, to hint to whoever shall read it, that whenever
they come to a true sense of things, they will find
deliverance from sin a much greater blessing than
deliverance from affliction.
But, leaving this part, I return to my journal.
My condition began to be, though not less mise-
rable as to my way of living, yet much easier to my
mind, and my thoughts being directed, by a constant
reading of the Scriptures, and praying to God, to
things of a higher nature, I had a great deal of com-
fort within, which till now I knew nothing of. Also,
as my health and strength returned, I began to furnish
myself with every thing that I wanted, and make my
way of living as regular as I could.
From the 4th of July to the 14th, I was chiefly
employed with walking about with my gun in my
hand, a little at a time, as a man that was gathering
up his strength after a fit of sickness, for it is hardly
to be imagined how low I was, and to what weakness
I was reduced. The application I made use of was
perfectly new, and perhaps what had never cured an
ague before, neither can I recommend the experiment,
for it left me very weak, with frequent convulsions
in my nerves and limbs for some time.
I had now been in this unhappy island above ten
months; all possibility of deliverance from it seemed
to be entirely taken away from me; and I firmly be-
lieve that no human shape had ever set foot upon the
place. Having secured my habitation, as I thought,
fully to my mind, I had a desire to make a more
perfect discovery of the island, and see what other
productions I might find, which I yet knew not of.
It was on the 15th of July that I began to take a
more particular survey of the island. I went up the
creek first, where I had brought my rafts on shore.
I found, after going about two miles up, that the
tide did not flow any higher, and that it was no more
than a little brook of running water, and very fresh
and good; but this being the dry season, there was
scarcely any water in some parts of it.
On the banks of this brook I found many pleasant
savannahs or meadows, plain, smooth, and covered
with grass, and on the rising parts of them, next to
the higher grounds, where the water, as it might be
supposed, never overflowed, I found a great deal of
tobacco, green, and growing to a great and strong
stalk. There were divers other plants, which I did
not understand, and might, perhaps, have virtues of
their own, which I could not find out.
I searched for the cassava root, which the Indians,
in all that climate, make their bread of, but I could
find none. I saw large plants of aloes, but'did
not then understand them. I saw several sugar
canes, but wild, and, for want of cultivation, imper-
fect. I contented myself with these discoveries for
this time, and came back, musing with myself what
course I might take to know the virtues and goodness
of any of the fruits or plants which I should discover,
but could bring it to no conclusion ; for, in short,
I made so little observation while I was in the Brasils,
that I knew little of the plants of the field.
The next day, the Kith, I went up the same way
again; and, after going something farther than I had
gone the day before, I found the brook and the sa-
vannahs began to cease, and the country became more
woody than before. In this part I found different
fruits, and particularly melons, upon the ground, in
great abundance, and grapes upon the trees; the
vines had spread over the trees, and the clusters of
grapes were now in their prime, very ripe and rich.
This was a surprising discovery, and I was exceeding
glad of them; but I was warned, by my experience,
to eat sparingly of them, remembering that when I
was ashore in Barbary, the eating of grapes killed
several of our Englishmen, who were slaves there, by
throwing them into fluxes and fevers: but I found
an excellent use for these grapes; and that was to
cure or dry them in the sun, and keep them as dried
grapes or raisins are kept, which I thought would be,
as indeed they were, as wholesome, and as agreeable
to eat, when no grapes might be had.
I spent all that evening there, and went not back
to my habitation, which was the first night, 03 I
might say, I had lain from home. In the night I got
up into a tree, where I slept well, and the next morn-
ing proceeded upon my discovery, travelling near
four miles, keeping still due north, with a ridge of
hills on the south and north side of me. %
At the end of this march, I came to an opening.
where the country seemed to descend to the west,
and a little spring of fresh water, which issued out
of the side of the hill by me, ran the other way, that
is, due east; and the country appeared so fresh, so
green, and so flourishing, that it looked like a garden.
I descended a little on the side of that delicious
valley, surveying it with a secret kind of pleasure
(though mixed with other afflicting thoughts,) to
think that this was all my own ; and if I could con-
vey it, I might have it in inheritance, as completely
as any lord of the manor in England. I saw here
abundance of cocoa-trees, orange, lemon, and citron
trees, but all wild, and few bearing fruit. However,
the green limes that I gathered were not only plea-
sant to eat, but very wholesome; and I mixed their
juice afterwards with water, which made it very
wholesome, and very cool and refreshing. I now
resolved to carry home, and lay up a store of grapes,
limes, and lemons, to furnish myself for the wet
season, which I knew was approaching.
In order to do this, I gathered a great heap of
grapes in one place, and a lesser heap in another, and
a great parcel of limes and lemons in another place;
and, taking a few of each with me, I travelled home-
ward, and resolved to come again, and bring a bag or
sack, or what I could make, to carry them home.
Accordingly, having spent three days in this jour-
ney, I came home; but before I got thither, the
grapes were spoiled; the richness of the fruit, and
the weight of the juice, having broken and bruised
them, they were good for little or nothing; as. to the
limes, but I could bring a few.
The next day, being the 19th, I went back, having
made me two small bags to bring home my harvest;
but I was surprised, when, coming to my heap of
grapes, I found them all spread abroad, trod to
pieces, and dragged about, some here, some there,
and abundance eaten and devoured. By this I con-
cluded there were some wild creatures thereabouts
who had done this, but what they were I knew not.
However, as I found there was no laying them up
on heaps, and no carrying them away in a sack, I
took another course; for I gathered a large quantity
of grapes, and hung them upon the out-branches of
the trees, that they might cure and dry in the sun;
and as for the limes and lemons, I carried as many
back as I could well stand under.
When I came home from this journey, I contem-
plated, with great pleasure, the fruitfmness of that
valley, and the pleasantness of the situation; and
concluded that I had pitched upon a place to fix my
abode, which was by far the worst part of the country.
Upon the whole, I began to consider of removing my
habitation, and to lookout for a place equally safe as where I now was situate, if possible, in that plea-
sant, fruitful part of the island.
This thought ran long in my head, and I was ex-
ceeding fond of it for some time, the pleasantness of
the place tempting me; but when I came to a nearer
view of it, and to consider that I was now by the
seaside, where it was at least possible that some-
thing might happen to my advantage, and that the
same ill fate that brought me hither might bring
some unhappy wretches to the same place; and
though it was scarce probable that any such thing
should ever happen, yet, to enclose my self among the
hills and woods, in the centre of the island, was to
anticipate my bondage, "and to render such an affair
not only improbable, but impossible, and that there-
fore I ought not by any means to remove.
However; I was so enamoured with this place,
that I spent much of my time there for the whole
remaining part of the month of July ; and though,
upon second thoughts, I resolved not to remove, yet
I built a little kind of bower, and surrounded it at a
distance with a strong fence, being a double hedge,
as high as I could reach, well staked, and filled be-
tween with brushwood; and here I lay secure, some-
times two or three nights together, always going over
it with a ladder, as before, so that I fancied now I
had my country-house and my sea-coast house; and
this work took me up to the beginning of August.
I had but newly finished my fence, and began to
enjoy my labour, when the rains came on, and made
me stick close to my first habitation; for though I
had made me a tent, like the other, with a piece of a
sail, and spread it very well, yet I had not the shelter
of a hill to keep me from storms, nor a cave behind
me to retreat into, when the rains were extraordinary.
About the beginning of August, as I said, I had
finished my bower, and began to enjoy myself. The
3rd of August I found the grapes I had hung up
were perfectly dried; so I began to take them down
from the trees, and it was very happy that I did so,
for the rains which followed would have spoiled
them. No sooner had I taken them all down, and
carried them home to my cave, but it began to rain;
and from hence, which was the 14th of August, it
rained more or less every day till the middle of Octo-
ber, and sometimes so violently that I could not stir
out of my cave for several days.
In this season I was much surprised with the in-
crease of my family. I had been concerned for the
loss of one of my cats, who ran away from me, or, as
I thought, had been dead; and I heard no more of
her, till, to my astonishment, she came home about
the end of August with three kittens. This was the
more strange to me, because, though I had killed a
wild cat, as I called it, with my gun, yet I thought
it was quite a different kind from our European cats;
yet the young cats were the same kind of house-
bred, like the old one; and both my cats beingfemales,
I thought it very strange. But from these three cats
I afterwards came to be so pestered with cats, that I
was forced to kill them like vermin, or wild beasts,
and to drive them from my house as much as
possible.
From the 14th of August to the 26th, incessant
rain, so that I could not stir, and was now very care-
ful not to get wet. In this confinement I began to
be straitened for food; but venturing out twice, I one
day killed a goat; and the last day, which was the
26th, found a very large tortoise, which was a treat
to me; and my food was regulated thus: I eat a
bunch of raisins for my breakfast; a piece of goat's
flesh, or of the turtle for my dinner; and two of the
turtle's eggs for supper.
During this confinement in my cover by the rain,
I worked daily two or three hours at enlarging my
cave; and, by degrees, worked it on towards one side,
till I came to the outside of the hill, and made a door,
or way out, which came beyond my fence or wall,
and so I came in and out this way. But I was not
perfectly easy at lying so open; for, as I had managed
myself before, I was in a perfect enclosure, whereas
now I thought I lay exposed; and yet I could not
perceive that there was any living thing to fear, the
biggest creature that I had yet seen being a goat.
September 30th.—I was now come to the unhappy
anniversary of my landing. I cast up the notches on
my post, and found I had been on shore three hun-
dred and sixty-five days. I kept this day as a solemn
fast, setting it apart to religious exercise, prostrating
myself on the ground with the most serious humili-
ation, confessing my sins to God, acknowledging his
righteous judgments upon me, and praying to him to
have mercy on me, through Jesus Christ; and having
not tasted the least refreshment for twelve hours, even
till the going down of the sun, I then eat a biscuit
cake and a bunch of grapes, and went to bed, finish-
ing the day as I began it.
I had all thistimeobserved no Sabbath day; for as at
first I had no sense of religion upon my mind, I had for
some time omitted to distinguish the weeks by cutting
a longer notch than ordinary for the Sabbath day,
and so did not know what any of the days were; but
now having cast up the days as above, I found I had
been there a year, so I divided it into weeks, and set
apartcvery seventh day for a Sabbath, though I found
at the end of my account I had lost a day or two.
A little after this, my ink began to fail me, and so
I contented myself to use it more sparingly, and to
write down only the most remarkable events of my
life, without making a memorandum of other things.
The rainy season, and the dry season, began now
to appear regular to me, and I learned to divide them
so as to provide for them accordingly. But I bought
my experience before I had it; and this I am going to
relate was one of the most discouraging experiments
that I made at all. I have mentioned that I had
saved the few ears of barley and rice, which I had
so surprisingly found spring up, as I thought, of
themselves, and believe there were about thirty stalks
of rice, and about twenty of barley; and now I thought
it a proper time to sow after the rains, the sun being
in its southern position going from me.
Accordingly, I dug up a piece of ground as well
as I could with my wooden spade, and dividing it
into two parts, I sowed my grain; but as I was sow-
ing, it casually occurred to my thoughts that I would
not sow it all at first, because I did not know when
was the proper time for it, so I sowed about two-
thirds of the seed, leaving about a handful of each.
It was a great comfort to me afterwards, that I did
so, for not one grain of that I sowed this time came
to any thing; for the dry months following, the earth
having had no rain after the seed was sown, it had no
moisture to assist its growth, and it never came up at
all, till the wet season had come again, and then it grew as if it had been but newly sown. '
Finding my first seed did not grow, which I easily
imagined was by the drought, I sought for a moister
piece of ground to make another trial in; and I dug
up a piece of ground near my new bower, and sowed
the rest of my seed in February, a little before the
vernal equinox; and this, having the rainy months of
March and April to water it, sprung up very plea-
santly, and yielded a very good crop: but having
part of the seed left only, and not daring to sow afl
that I had yet, I had but a small quantity at last, my
whole crop not amounting to above half a peck.
But, by this experiment, I was made master of my
business, and knew exactly the time to sow, that I
might expect two seed-times and harvests every year.
While this corn was growing I made a little dis-
covery, which was of use to me afterwards. As soon
as the rains were over, and the weather began to
settle, which was the month of November, I made a
visit up the country to my bower, where, though I
had not been some months, yet I found all things
just as I left them. The circle or double hedge that
I had made was not only firm and entire, but the
stakes, which I had cut off some trees that grew
thereabouts, were all shot out, and grown with long
branches, as much as a willow tree usually shoots the
first year after lopping its head. I could not tell
what tree to call it that these stakes were cut from.
I was surprised, and yet very well pleased, to see the
young trees grow; and I pruned them, and led them
up to grow as much alike as I could; and it is scarce
credible how beautiful a figure they grew into in three
years, so that though the hedge made a circle of about
twenty-five yards in diameter, yet the trees, for such
I might now call them, soon covered it, and it was a
shade, sufficient to lodge under all the dry season.
This made me resolve to cut some more stakes, and
make me a hedge like this, in a semicircle round my
wall,^ mean that of my first dwelling, which I did;
and, placing the trees or stakes in a double row, at
about eight yards distance from my first fence, they
grew, and were, at first, a fine cover to my habitation.
and afterwards served for a defence also, as I shall
observe in its order.
I found now that the seasons of the year might
generally be divided, not into summer and winter, as
m Europe, but into rainy seasons and dry seasons,
which were generally thus :—
Half February, March, half April—Rainy, the sun
being then or near the equinox.
Half April, May, June, half August—Dry, the sun
being then to the north of the line.
Half August, September, half October—Rainy, the
sun being then come back.
Half October, November, December, January, half
February—Dry, the sun being to the south of the line.
The rainy season sometimes held longer or shorter,
as the winds happened to blow ; this was the general
observation I made. After I had found, by experience,
the ill consequence of being abroad in the rain, I took
care to furnish myself with provisions beforehand, that I might not be obliged to go out; and I sat in
doors as much as possible during the wet months.
At this time I tried many ways to make myself a
basket, but all the twigs I could get for the purpose
proved so brittle, that they would do nothing. It
? roved of excellent advantage to me now; that when
was a boy, I used to take great delight m standing
at a basket-maker's in the town where I lived, to
see them make their wicker ware; and being, as boys
usually are, very officious to help, and a great ob-
server of the manner how they worked these things,
and sometimes lending a hand, I had, by this means,
so full a knowledge of their methods, that I wanted
nothing but the materials; when it came into my
mind, that the twigs of that tree, from whence I cut
my stakes that grew, might possibly be as tough as
the sallows, and willows, and osiers in England, and I
resolved to try. Accordingly, the next day I went
to my country house, as I called it, and cutting some
of the smaller twigs, I found them to my purpose as
much as I could desire; whereupon I came the next
time prepared with a hatchet to cut down a quantity
which I soon found, for there was a great plenty of
them. These I set to dry within my circle or hedge,
and when they were fit for use, I carried them to my
cave; and here, during the next season, I employed
myself in making, as well as I could, a great many
baskets. both to carry earth, or to lay up any thing,
as I had occasion; and thus, afterwards, I took care
never to be without them: and, as my wicker ware
decayed, I made more; especially I made strong deep
baskets to place my corn in, instead of sacks, when
I should come to have any quantity of it.
Having mastered this difficulty, and employed a
world of time about it, I bestirred myself to see, if
possible, how to supply two wants. I had no vessels
to hold any thing that was liquid, except two runlets
which were almost full of rum, and some glass bot-
tles, some of the common size, and others which were
case bottles, square, for the holding of water, spirits,
&c. I had not so much as a pot to boil any thing in,
except a great kettle, which I saved out of the ship,
and which was too big for the uses I desired it for,
viz. to make broth, and stew a bit of meat by itself.
The next thing I would fain have had was a tobacco-
Eipe; but it was impossible for me to make one;
owever, I found a contrivance for that too at last.
I mentioned before that I had a great mind to see
the whole island, and that I travelled up the brook,
and so on to where I had built my bower, and where
I had an opening quite to the sea, on the other side
of the island. now resolved to travel quite across
to the sea-shore on that side; so taking my gun, a
hatchet, and my dog, and a larger quantity of powder
and shot than usual, with two biscuit cakes. and a
great bunch of raisins in my pouch, for my store, I
Began my journey. When I had passed the vale
where my bower stood, as above, I came in view of
the sea, to the west; and it being a very clear day, I fairly descried land, whether an island or a continent
I could not tell; but it lay very high, extending from
the west to the W. S. W. at a great distance; by my
guess it was fifteen or twenty leagues off.
I could not tell what part of the world this might
be, otherwise than that I knew it must be part of
America; and, as I concluded by all my observations,
must be near the Spanish dominions, and perhaps
was all inhabited by savages, where, if I should have
landed, I had been in a worse condition than I was
now; and therefore I acquiesced in the disposition of
Providence, which I began to own, and to believe,
ordered every thing for the best.
Besides, I considered, that if this land was the
Spanish coast, I should certainly one time or other
see some vessels pass or repass one way or other; but
if not, then it was a savage coast between the Spanish
country and Brazils, who were indeed the worst of
savages, for they were cannibals, or men-eaters, and
devour all the human bodies that fall into their hands.
With these considerations I walked very leisurely
forward. I found that side of the island where I now
was, much pleasanter than mine, the open or savan-
nah fields sweet, adorned with flowers and grius,
and full of very fine woods. I saw abundance of
parrots, and fain would have caught one, if possible,
to have kept it to be tame, and taught it to speak to
me. I did after some painstaking catch a young
parrot, for I knocked it down with a stick, and I took
it home, but it was some years before I could make
him speak to me. However, at last I taught him to
call me by my name very familiarly.
I was exceedingly diverted with this journey. I found in the low grounds, hares, as I thought them
to be, and foxes, but they differed greatly from all
the other kinds I had met with; nor could I satisfy
myself to eat them, though I killed several. But I
had no need to be venturous, for I had no want of
food, and of that which was very good too, especially
these three sorts, viz. goats, pigeons, and turtle or
tortoise, which, added to my grapes, Leadenhall
market could not have furnished a table better than
I could, in proportion to the company.
I never travelled in this journey above two miles in
a day, or thereabouts; but I took so many turns and
returns, to see what discoveries I could make, that I
came weary enough to the place where I resolved to
sit down for all night; and then I either reposed
myself in a tree, or surrounded myself with a row of
stakes set upright in the ground, either from one tree
to another, or so as no wild creature could come at
me without waking me.
As soon as I came to the sea shore, I was surprised
to see that I had taken up my lot on the worst side
of the island, for here indeed the shore was covered
with innumerable turtles, whereas on the other side
I had found but three in a year and a half. Here
was also an infinite number of fowls, of many kinds,
some of which I had seen, and some of which I had
not seen before, and many of them very good meat, but
I knew not their names, except those called penguins.
I could have shot as many as I pleased, but was
very sparing of my powder and shot, and therefore
had more mind to kill a she-goat, if I could, which
I could better feed on. And though there were many
goats here more than on my side of the island, yet it
was with much more difficulty that I could come
near them, the country being flat and even, and they
saw me much sooner than when I was on the hills.
I confess this side of the country was much plea-
santer than mine, but vet I had not the least inclina-
tion to remove; and I seemed all the while I was
here to be, as it were, upon a journey, and from home.
However, I travelled along the shore of the sea,
H 2
towards the east, I suppose, about twelve miles; and
then setting up a great pole upon the shore for a
mark, I concluded to go home again; and that the
next journey I took should be on the other side of the
island, east from my dwelling, and so round till I
came to my post again.
I took another way to come back than that I went,
thinking I could easily keep all the island so much
in my view, that I could not miss finding my first
dwelling, by viewing the country: but found myself
mistaken; for being come about two or three miles,
I found myself descended into a very large valley,
but so surrounded with hills, and those hills covered
with woods, that I could not see which was my way
by any direction but that of the sun, nor even then,
unless I knew very well the position of the sun at
that time of the day.
It happened, unfortunately, that the weather proved
hazy for three or four days, while I was in this valley;
and not being able to see the sun I wandered about
very uncomfortably, and at last was obliged to find
out the sea-side, look for my post, and come back the
same way I went; and then, by easy journeys, I
turned homeward, the weather being exceeding hot;
and my gun, ammunition, hatchet, and other things,
very heavy.
In this journey my dog surprised a young kid, and
seized upon it; and I running to take hold of it,
caught it, and saved it alive from the dog. I had a
great mind to bring it home, if I could; for I was
very anxious to raise a breed of tame goats, which
might supply me when my powder and shot should
be all spent. I made a collar to this little creature,
and with a string which I made of some rope-yarn,
which I always carried about me, I led him along,
though with some difficulty, till I came to my bower,
and there I enclosed him, and left him; for I was
very impatient to be at home, from whence I had
been absent above a month.
I cannot express what a satisfaction it was to me
to come into my old abode, and lie down in my ham-
mock-bed. This little wandering journey, without
any settled habitation, had been unpleasant to me,
so that my own house, as I called it, was a perfect
settlement, compared to that; and it rendered every
thing about me so comfortable, that I resolved I
would never go a great way from it again, while it
should be my lot to stay on the island.
I reposed myself here a week, to rest and regale
myself after my long journey, during which, most of
the time was taken up in the weighty affair of making
a cage for my poll, who began now to be a mere do-
mestic, and to be very well acquainted with me.
Then I began to think of the poor kid, which I had
pent in within my little circle, and resolved to go and
fetch it home, or give it some food; accordingly I
went, and found it where I left it, for indeed it could
not get out, but was almost starved for want of food.
I went and cut boughs of trees, and branches of such
shrubs as I could find, and threw them over, and
having fed it, I tied it as I did before, to lead it
away, but it was so tame with being hungry, that I
had no need to have tied it, for it followed me like a
dog - and became, from that time, one of my domestics
also, and would never leave me afterwards.
The rainy season of the autumnal equinox was now
come, and I kept the 30th of September in the same
solemn manner as before, being the anniversary of
my landing on the island, having now been there two
years, and no more prospect of being delivered than
the first day I came there. I spent the whole day
in humble and thankful acknowledments of the many
wonderful mercies which my solitary condition was
attended with, and without which it might have been
infinitely more miserable. I gave humble and hearty
thanks that God had been pleased to discover to me,
even that it was possible I might be more happy in
this solitary condition, than I should have been in
make up to me the deficiencies of my solitary state,
and the want of human society, by his presence, and
the communications of his grace to my soul, support-
ing, comforting, and encouraging me to depend upon
his providence here, and hope for his eternal pre-
sence hereafter.
It was now that I began sensibly to feel how much
more happy the life I now led was, with all its mise-
rable circumstances, than the wicked, cursed, abomi-
nable life I led all the past part of my days; having
changed both my sorrows and my joys, from what
they were at my first coming, or indeed for the two
years past.
Before, as I walked about, either on my hunting,
or for viewing the country, the anguish of my soul
at my condition would break out upon me on a sudden,
and my very heart would die within me, to think or
the woods, the mountains, the deserts I was in; and
how I was a prisoner locked up with the eternal
bars and bolts of the ocean, in an uninhabited wilder-
nees, without redemption. In the midst of the
greatest composures of my mind, this would break
out upon me, like a storm, and make me wring my
hands, and weep like a child. Sometimes it would
take me in the middle of my work, and I would im-
mediately sit down and sigh, and look upon the
ground for an hour or two together, and this was
still worse to me; for if I could burst out into tears,
or vent myself by words, it would go off, and the
grief, having exhausted itself, would abate.
But now I began to exercise myself with new
thoughts. I daily read the word of God, and applied
all the comforts of it to my present state. I never
opened the Bible, or shut it, but my very soul within
me blessed God for directing my friend in England,
without any order of mine, to pack it up among my
goods, and for assisting me afterwards to save it out
of the wreck of the ship.
Thus, and in this disposition of mind, I began my
third year; having regularly divided my time accord Ing to the several daily employments that were before
me: such as, first, my duty to God, and reading the
Scriptures, which I constantly set apart for some
time, thrice every day. secondly, the going abroad
with my gun for food, which generally took me up three hours every morning, when it "did not rain.
Thirdly, the ordering, curing, preserving, and cook-
ing, what I had killed or catched for my supply;
these took up great part of the day. Also, in the
middle of the day, when the sun was in its zenith,
the violence of the heat was too great to stir out, so
that about four hours in the evening was all the time
I could be supposed to work in; with this exception,
that sometimes I changed my hours of hunting and
working, and went to work in the morning, and
abroad with my gun in the afternoon.
To this short time allowed for labour, may be added
the exceeding laboriousness of my work; the many
hours, which, for want of tools, want of help, and
want of skill, every thing that I did took up out of
my time. For example, I was full two-and-forty
days making me a board for a long shelf, which I
wanted in my cave, whereas, two sawyers, with their
tools and a saw-pit, would have cut six of them, out
of the same tree in half a day.
My case was this; it was to be a large tree which
was to be cut down, because my board was to be a
broad one. This tree I was three days in cutting
down, and two more cutting off the boughs, and re-
ducing it to a log or piece of timber. With inexpres-
sible hacking and hewing, I reduced both sides of it
into chips, till it began to be light enough to move;
then I turned it, and made one side of it smooth and
flat as a board, from end to end, then turning that
side downward, cut the other side, till I brought the
plank to be about three inches thick, and smooth on
both sides. Any one may judge the reason why BO
much of my time went away with so little work,
viz. that what might be a little to be done with help
and tools, was a vast labour, and required a prodigious
time to do alone, and by hand.
I was now in the months of November and Decem-
ber, expecting my crop of barley and rice. The
ground I had manured or dug up for them was not
great, for, as I observed, my seed of each was not
above the quantity of half a peek, for I had lost one
whole crop by sowing in the dry season, but now my
crop promised very well, when, on a sudden, I found
I was in danger of losing it all again by enemies of
several sorts, which it was scarce possible to keep
from it; at first, the goats and wild creatures which
I called hares, who, tasting the sweetness of the
blade, lay in it night and day, as soon as it came up,
and eat it so close, that it could get no time to shoot
up into stalk. This I saw no remedy for but by
making an enclosure about it with a hedge, which I
did with a great deal of toil, and the more as it re-
quired speed, the creatures daily spoiling my corn.
However, as my arable land was but small, suited to
my crop, I got it totally well fenced in about three
weeks' time; and shooting some of the creatures in
the day time, I set my dog to guard it in the night,
tying^ him up to a stake at the gate, where he would
stand and bark all night long; so, in a little time,
the enemies forsook the place, and the corn grew very
strong and well, and began to ripen apace.
But as the beasts injured me before, while my corn
was in the blade, so the birds were likely to injure me now, when it was in the ear; for, going along by
the place to see how it throve, I saw my little crop
surrounded with fowls, of I know not how many
sorts, who stood, as it were, watching till I should be
gone. I immediately let fly among them; and I had
no sooner shot, but there rose up a little cloud of
fowls, which I had not seen, from amongst the corn.
This touched me sensibly, for I foresaw that, In a
few days they would devour all my hopes; that I
should be starved, and never be able to raise a crop
at all, and what to do I could not tell. In the first
place, I went among it to see what damage was
already done, and found they had spoiled a good deal
of it; but that, as it was yet too green for them, the
loss was not so great, but that the remainder was
like to be a good crop, if it could be saved.
I staid by it to load my gun, and then coming
away, I could easily see the thieves sitting upon the
trees about me, as if they only waited till I was gone
away; and the event proved it to be so: for as I
walked off as if I was gone, I was no sooner out of
their sight, but they dropped down, one by one, into
the cor n again. I was so provoked that I had not
patience to stay till more came, knowing that every
grain that they eat now, was, as it might be said, a
peck- loaf to me in the consequence; but coming up
to the hedge, I fired again, and killed three of them.
This was what I wished for: so I took them up, and
served them as we serve notorious thieves in England,
viz. hanged them in chains as a terror to others. It
is impossible to imagine almost that this should have
such an effect as it had; for the birds would not only
not come at the corn, but, in short, they forsook all
that part of the island, and I could never see a bird
near the place as long as my scarecrows hung there.
This I was very glad of; and, about the latter end
of December, which was our second harvest of the
year, I reaped my crop. I was sadly put to it for a
scythe or sickle, to cut it down, and all I could do
was to make one as well as I could, out of one of the
broad-swords, or cutlasses, which I saved among the
arms out of the ship. However, as my crop was but
small, I had no great difficulty to cut it down. In
short, I reaped it in my way, for I cut nothing off
but the ears, and carried it away in a great basket
which I had made, and so rubbed it out with my
At the end of all my harvesting, I found that
f
out of my half-peck of seed, I had near two bushels of
rice, and above two bushels and a half of barley;
that is to say, by my guess, for I had no measure.
However, this was a great encouragent to me, and I foresaw that in time it would please God to supply
me with bread. And yet here I was perplexed again,
for I neither knew how to grind or make meal of my
corn, or, indeed, how to clean it, and part it; nor, if
made into meal, how to make bread of it; and if how
to make it, yet I knew not how to bake it. These
things being added to my desire for having a good
'quantity for store, and to secure a constant supply,
resolved not to taste any of this crop, but to pre-
serve it all for seed against the next season, and, in
the mean time, to employ all my study and hours of
working to accomplish this great work of providing
myself with corn and bread.
It might be truly said, that now I worked for my
bread. It is wonderful what a strange multitude of
little things are necessary in the providing, producing
dressing, and finishing this one articls-of bread.
I, that was reduced to a mere state of nature, found
this to be my daily discouragement, and was made
more and more sensible of it every hour, even after I
had got the first handful of seed corn, which, as I
have said, came up unexpectedly, and to my surprise.
First, I had no plough to turn the earth, no spade
or shovel to dig it. Well, this I conquered by making
a wooden spade, as I observed before; but this did
my work but in a wooden manner; and though it cost
me a great many days to make it, yet for want of iron
it not only wore out the sooner^ but made my work
the harder, and made it be performed much worse.
However, this I bore with, and was content to work
it out with patience, and bear with the badness of the
performance. When the corn was sown, I had no
harrow, but was forced to go over it myself, and drag
a great heavy bough of a tree over it, to scratch the
earth, as it may be called, rather than harrow it.
When It was growing and grown, I have observed
already how many things I wanted, to fence it, secure
it, mow or reap it, cure and carry it home, thresh,
part it from the chaff, and save it. Then I wanted a
mill to grind it, sieves to dress it, yeast and salt to
make it into bread, and an oven to bake it in; and
yet these things I did without, as shall be observed.
All this, as I said, made every thing laborious and
tedious to me, but that there was no help for; neither
was my time so much loss to me, because as I had
divided it, a certain part of it was every day ap-
pointed to these works; and, as I resolved to use none
of the corn for bread, till I had a great quantity by
me, I had the next six months to apply myself1, by
labour and invention, to furnish myself with utensils
proper for the performing all the operations necessary
for making the corn, when I had it fit for my use.
But first, I had to prepare more land, for I had now
seed enough to sow above an acre of ground. Before
I did this, I had a week's work, at least, to make me
a spade, which, when it was done, was but a sorry
one indeed, and very heavy, and required double la-
bour to work with it. However, I went through
that, and sowed my seed in two large fiat pieces of
ground, as near my house as I could find them to my
mind, and fenced them in with a good hedge, the
stakes of which were all cut of that wood which I set
before, which I knew would grow; so that, in one
year's time, I knew I should -have a quick or living
hedge, that would want but little repair. This work
took me up three months, but part of that time was
of the wet season, when I could not go abroad.
Within doors, while I was at work, I diverted my-
self with talking to my parrot, and teaching him to
speak; and I quickly learned him to know his own
name, at last to speak it pretty loud, "Poll;" which
was the first word I ever heard spoken in the island
by any mouth but my own. This, therefore was not
my work, but an assistant to my work; for now, I
viz. I had long studied, by some means or other, to
make myself some earthen vessels, which indeed I
wanted sorely, but knew not where to come at them.
However, considering the heat of the climate, I did
not doubt but, if I could find out any such clay, I
might botch up some pot, as might, being dried in
the sun, be hard enough, and strong enough, to bear
handling, and to hold any thing that was dry, and
required to be kept so; and as this was necessary in
preparing corn, meal, &c. which was the thing I was
upon, I resolved to make some as large as I could, to
stand like jars to hold what should be put in them:
It would make the reader pity me, or rather laugh
at me, to tell how many awkward ways I took to
raise this paste: what odd, mis-shapen. ugly things
I made; how many of them fell in, and how many
fell out, the clay not being stiff enough to bear its own weight; how many cracked by the over-violent
heat of Sie sun, being set out too hastily; and how
many fell to pieces with only removing, as well before
as after they were dried; and, in a word, how, after
having laboured hard to find the clay, to dig it, to
temper it, to bring it home, to work it, I could not
make above two large, earthen, ugly things, I cannot
call them jars, in about two months' labour.
However, as the sun baked these two very dry and
hard, I lifted them very gently up, and set them down
in two great wicker-baskets, which I had made on
purpose for them, that they might not break; and as
between the pot and the basket there was a little
room to spare; and these two pots, being to stand
always dry, I thought they would hold my dry corn,
and perhaps the meal when the corn was bruised.
Though I miscarried so much in my design for large
pots, yet I made several smaller things with better
success; such as little round pots, flat dishes, pitchers, and pipkimi, and any thing my hand turned to, and
tin1 hcut of the fin i baked them extremely hard.
But all this would not answer my end, which was
to get an earthen pot to hold what was liquid, and
bear the fire, which none of these could do. It hap-
pened after some time, making a large fire for cook-
mg my meat, when I put it out, after I had done
with it, I found a broken piece of one of my earthen-
ware vessels in the fire, burnt as hard as a stone, and
red as a tile. I was agreeably surprised to see it,
and said to myself, that certainly they might be made
to burn whole, if they would burn broken.
This set me to study how to order my fire, so as to
make it burn me some pots. I had no notion of a
kiln, such as the potters burn in, or of glazing them
with lead, though I had some lead to do it with; but
I placed three large pipkins, and two or three pots,
in a pile upon one another, and placed my fire-wood
all round it with a great heap of embers under them.
I plied the fire with fresh fuel round the outside, and
upon the top, till I saw the pots in the inside red hot
quite through, and observed that they did not crack
at all. When I saw them clear red, I let them stand
in that heat five or six hours, till I found one of
them, though it did not crack, did melt or run; for
the sand which was mixed with the clay melted by
the violence of the heat, and would have run into
glass if I had gone on; so I slackened my fire gradu-
ally, till the pots began to abate of the red colour,
and watching them all night, that I might not let
the fire abate too fast, in the morning I had three
very good, I will not say handsome, pipkins, and two
other earthen pots, as hard burnt as could be desired;
and one of them perfectly glazed with the running
of the sand.
After this experiment, I need not say that I wanted
no sort of earthenware for my use; but I must needs
say, as to the shapes of them, they were very indif-
ferent. No joy at a thing of so mean a nature was
ever equal to mine, when I found I had made an
earthen pot that would bear the fire; and 1 had
set one upon the fire again, with some water in it, to
boil me some meat, which it did admirably well;
and, with a piece of kid, I made some very good
broth, though I wanted oatmeal, and several other
ingredients requisite to make it as good as I would
have had it.
My next concern was to get me a stone mortar to
stamp or beat some corn in; for as to the mill, there
was no thought of arriving to that perfection of art,
with one pair of hands. To supply this want I was
at a great loss ; for, of all the trades in the world, I
was as perfectly unqualified for a stone-cutter, as for
any whatever; neither had I any tools to go about
it with. I spent many a day to find out a great
stone big enough to cut hollow, and make fit for a
mortar, and could find none at all, except what was
in the solid rock, and which I had no way to dig or
cut out, nor indeed were the rocks in the island of
hardness sufficient, but were of a sandy crumbling
stone, which would neither bear the weight of a
heavy pestle, nor would break the corn without
filling it with sand. So, after a great deal of time
lost in searching for a stone, I gave it over, and re-
solved to look out a great block of hard wood, which
I found indeed much easier; and getting one as big
as I had strength to stir, I rounded it, and formed it
on the outside with my axe and hatchet, and then,
with the heln of fire, and infinite labour, made a
hollow place in it, as the Indians in Brazil make
their canoes. After this I made a great heavy pestle
or beater, of the wood called the iron-wood, and this
I prepared and laid by against I had my next crop of
corn, when I proposed to myself to grind, or rather
pound, my corn into meal, to make my bread.
My next difficulty was to make a sieve to dress
my meal, and to part it from the bran and the husks,
without which I did not see it possible I could have
any bread. This was a most difficult task; for I had
nothing like the necessary thing to make it with, I
mean fine thin canvas, or stuff to sift the meal
through. And here I was at a full stop for many
months; nor did I really know what to do, linen I
had none left, but what was mere rags.' I had goat's
hair, but neither knew how to weave or spin it; and
had I known how, here were no tools to work it with;
all the remedy that I found for this was, that at last
I did remember I had, among the seamen's clothes,
which were saved out of the ship, some neckcloths
of calico or muslin^ and with some pieces of these I
made three small sieves.
The baking part was the next thing to be thought
6f, and how I should make bread when I came to
have corn; for, first, I had no yeast. As to that
part, as there was no supplying the want, so I did
not concern myself much about it; but for an oven
I was indeed in great pain. At length I found an
expedient for that also, which was this:—I made
some earthen vessels very broad, but not deep, that
is to say, about two feet in diameter, and not above
nine inches deep; these I burnt in the fire, as I had
done the other. and laid them by, and when I wanted
to bake, I made a great fire upon my hearth, which
I paved with some square tiles, of my own making
and burning also.
When the fire-wood was burnt pretty much into
embers, for live coals, I drew them forward upon this
hearth, so as to cover it all over, end there I let them
lie, till the hearth was very hot; then sweeping away
all the embers, I set down my loaf or loaves, and,
whelming down the earthen pot upon them, drew the
embers all round the outside of the pot, to keep in
fmd add to the heat; and thus, as well as in the best
oven in the world, I baked my barley loaves, and
became, in a little time, a pastry-cook into the bar-
gain, having made myself several cakes of the rice.
It need not be wondered at, if all these things took
up most of the third year of my abode here; for it is
to be observed, that in the interval of these things,
my new harvest and husbandry had to be managed,
for I reaped my corn in its season, carried it home,
and laid it up in the ear, in my large baskets, till an
opportunity occurred to rub it out; having no floor
to thresh it on, or instrument to thresh it with.
And now, indeed, my stock of corn increasing, it became necessary to build my barns - bigger. Being
in want of a place to lay it up, for the increase of
corn now yielded me so much, that I had of barley
about twenty bushels, and as much or more of rice;
insomuch that I now resolved to use it freely, for my
bread had been quite gone a great while; being re-
solved to see what quantity would be sufficient for
me for a whole year, and to sow but once a year.
Upon the whole, finding that the forty bushels of
barley and rice were much more than I could con-
sume in a year; so I resolved to sow just the same
quantity every year as the last.
During the time that these things were doing,
my thoughts ran many times upon the prospect of
land, which I had seen from the other side of the
island; and was not without secret wishes to get on
shore, fancying that seeing the main land, and an
inhabited country, I might find someway or other to
convey myself farther, and at last might escape.
But all this while I made no allowance for the
dangers of such a condition, and how I might fall into
the hands of savages, and perhaps such as would be
far worse than the lions and tigers of Africa; that if
I once came into their power, there would be the
hazard of more than a thousand to one of being killed,
and perhaps of being eaten; for I knew that the peo-
ple of the Caribbean coasts were cannibals, or men-
eaters ; and I knew by the latitude that I could not
be far off from that shore; that, suppose they were
not cannibals, yet they might kill me, as many Euro-
peans who had fallen into their hands had been served
even when they had been ten or twenty together,
much more me that was only one. All these things,
I ought to have considered well of, and did cast up in
my thoughts afterwards, yet took up none of my ap-
prehensions at first; and my head ran mightily upon
the thought of getting over to that shore.
Now I wished for my boy Xury, and the long-boat,
with the shoulder-of-mutton sail, with which we sailed
above a thousand miles on the coast of Africa, but
this was in vain. Then I went to look at our ship's
boat, which was blown up upon the shore a great way
in the storm, when we were first cast away. It lay
almost where it did at first, but not quite, and was
turned by the force of the waves and the winds,
almost bottom upwards, againsta high ridge of beachy
rough sand, but no water about it as before.
Had I had hands to have refitted it, and to have
launched it into the water, the boat would have
done well enough to have taken me back into the
Brazils; but I might have easily foreseen that I could
no more turn it, and set it upright upon its bot-
tom, than I could remove the island. However, I went to the woods and cut levers and rollers, and
brought them to the boat, resolved to try what could
be done, suggesting to myself, that if it could be turned
down, the damage it had received might easily be
repaired, and it would be a very good boat, and I might go to sea in it very easily.
I spared no pains indeed in this piece of fruitless
toil, and spent, I think, three or four weeks about it;
at last, finding it impossible to heave it up with my
little strength, I fell to digging away the sand to un-
dermine it, and so to make it fall down? setting pieces
of wood to thrust and guide it in the fall.
But when I had done this, I was unable to stir it
up again, or to get under it, much less to move it for-
ward towards the water, so I was forced to give it
over; and yet my desire to venture over for the main
increased, rather than decreased, as the means for it
seemed impossible. This at length set me upon
I
thinking whether it was not possible to make my-
self a canoe, or periagua, such as the natives of those
climates make; even without tools, or, as I might
say, without hands, viz. of the trunk of a great tree.
This I not only thought possible, but easy; but not
at all considering the inconveniences which I lay
under more than the Indians did, viz. want of hands
to move it into the water, when it was made, a diffi-
culty much harder for me to surmount than all the
consequences of want of tools could be to them; for
what was it to me, that when I had chosen a vast
tree in the woods, I might with great trouble cut it
down, if after I should be able with my tools to hew
and dub the outside into the proper shape of a boat,
and burn or cut out the inside to make it hollow, so
as to make a boat of it; if, after all this. I must leave
it where I found it, and was not able to launch it into
the water?
One would have thought I could not have had the
least reflection upon my mind of my circumstance
while I was making this boat, but I should have im-
mediately thought how I should get it into the sea;
but my thoughts were so intent upon my voyage over
the sea in it, that I never once thought how I should
get it off the land; and it was more easy for me to
guide it over 45 miles of sea than about 45 fathoms
of land, where it lay, to set it afloat in the water.
I went to work upon this boat the most like a fool
that ever man did who had any of his senses awake.
I pleased myself with the design, without determining
whether I was ever able to undertake it; not but
that the difficulty of launching my boat came often
into my head; but I put a stop to my own inquiries
into it by this foolish answer which I gave myself—
"Let me firstmake it, I'll warrant I'll find someway
or other to get it along, when it is done."
This was a most preposterous method; but the
eagerness of my fancy prevailed, and to work I went,
w«d felled a cedar-tree. I question much whether
Solomon ever had such a one for the building the
temple at Jerusalem; it was five feet ten inches
diameter at the lower part next the stump, and four
feet eleven inches diameter at the end of twenty-two
feet; after which it lessened for a while, and then
parted into branches. It was not without infinite
labour that I felled this tree. I was twenty days
hacking and hewing at it at the bottom; I was four-
teen more getting the branches and limbs, and the
vast spreading head of it cut off, which I hacked and
hewed through with my axe and hatchet, with inex-
pressible labour. After this it cost me a month to
shape it, and dub it to a proportion, and to something
like the bottom of a boat, that it might swim upright
as it ought to do. It cost me near three months
more to clear the inside, and work it out so as to
make an exact boat of it. This I did indeed without
fire, by mere mallet and chisel, and by the dint of
hard labour, till I had brought it to be a very hand-
some periagua, and big enough to have carried six-
and-twenty men, and consequently big enough to
have carried me and all my cargo.
When I had gone through this work, I was ex-
tremely delighted with it. The boat was really
bigger than ever I saw a canoe, or periagua, that
was made of one tree, in my life; and there remained
nothing but to get it into the water. But all my
devices to get it there failed, though they cost me
infinite labour: the boat lay about one hundred yards
from the water, and not more; but the first inconve-
nience was, it was up-hill towards the creek. Well,
to take away this discoiiragement, I resolved to dig
into the surface of the earth, and so make a declivity.
This I began, and it cost me a prodigious deal of
pains, but who grudge pains that have deliverance
in view? When this was worked through, I could
no more stir the canoe than I could the other boat.
Then I measured the distance of ground, and re-
solved to cut a dock or canal, to bring the water up
I 2
to the canoe, seeing I could not bring the canoe down
to the water. Well, I began this work, and when I began to enter it, and calculated how deep it was to
be dug, how broad, how the stuff was to be thrown
out, I found that, by the number of hands I had,
being none but my own, it must have been ten or
twelve years before I should have gone through with
it; for the shore lay high, so that at the upper end
it must have been at least twenty feet deep; so at
length, though with great reluctancy, I gave this attempt over also.
This grieved me heartily; and now I saw, though
too late, the folly of beginning a work before we
count the cost, and before we judge rightly of our
own strength to go through with it.
In the middle of this work I finished my fourth
year in this place, and kept my anniversary with the
same devotion, and with as much comfort as ever
before; for by a constant study, and serious applica-
tion of the word of God, and by the assistance of his
grace, I gained a different knowledge from what I had
before. I looked now upon the world as a thing re-
mote, which I had nothing to do with, no expectation
from, and indeed no desires about; so 1 thought it
looked, as we may perhaps look upon it hereafter,
viz. as a place I had lived in, but was come out of it.
In the first place, I was removed from all the
wickedness of the world here. I had neither the
"lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye, nor the pride
of life." I had nothing to covet, for I had all I was
now capable of enjoying: I was lord of the whole
manor, or, if I pleased, I might call myself king or
emperor over the whole country which I had pos-
session of. There were no rivals. I had no compe-
titor; none to dispute sovereignty or command with
me. I might have raised ship-loadings of corn, but
I had no use for it, so I let as little grow as I thought
enough for my occasion. I had tortoises or turtles
plenty, but now and then one was as much as I could
put to any use. I had timber enough to have built
a fleet of ships. I had grapes enough to have made
wine, or to have cured into raisins, to have loaded
that fleet when they had been built. I had, as I hinted before, a parcel of money, as well gold as
silver, above thirty-six pounds sterling. Alas! there
the nasty, sorry, useless stuff lay; I had no manner
of business for it; and I often thought within myself,
that I would have given a handful of it for a gross of
tobacco-pipes, or for a hand-mill to grind my corn;
nay, I would have given it all for sixpenny-worth of
turnip and carrot seed out of England, or for a handful
of peas and beans, and a bottle of ink. As it was, I had not the least advantage by it, or benefit from it,
but there it lay in a drawer, and grew monldv with
the damp of the cave in the wet season; and if I had
had the drawer full of diamonds, it had been the
same case, and they had been of no manner of value
to me, because of no use.
I had now been here so long, that many things
which I brought on shore for my help were either
quite gone, or very much wasted, and near spent.
My ink, as I observed, had been quite gone for
some time, all but a very little, which I eked out
with water a little and a little, till it was so pale it
scarce left any appearance of black upon the paper.
As long as it lasted, I made use of it to minute down
the day of the month on which any remarkable thing
happened to me: and first, by casting up times past,
I remember that there was a strange concurrence of
days in the various providences which befel me, and
which, if I had been superstitiously inclined to ob-
serve days as fatal or fortunate, I might have had
reason to have looked upon with a deal of curiosity.
First, I had observed that the same day that I broke
away from my father and my friends, and ran away
to Hull, in order to go to sea, the same day after-
wards I was taken by the Sallee man of war, and
made a slave. The same day of the year that I
escaped out of the wreck of the ship In Yarmouth
Roads, that same day of the year afterwards I made
my escape from Sallee in the boat. The same day of
the year I was born in, viz. the :30th of September,
the same day I had my life so miraculously saved
twenty-six years after, when I was cast on shore on
this island, so that my wicked life and solitary life
began both on a day.
The next thing to my ink being finished was that
of my bread, I mean the biscuit which I had brought
out of the ship. This I had husbanded to the last
degree, allowing myself but one cake of bread a day
for above a year; and yet I was quite without bread
for near a year before I got any corn of my own; and
great reason I had to be thankful that I had any at
all, the getting it being, as has been already observed,
next to miraculous.
My clothes, too, began to decay mightily. As to
linen, I had had none for a good while, except some
check shirts which I found in the chests of the other
seamen, and which I carefully preserved, because
many times I could bear no other clothes on but a
shirt; and it was a very great help to me that I had,
among all the men's clothes of the ship, almost three
dozen of shirts. There were also several thick watch-
coats of the seamen, which were left indeed, but they
were too hot to wear; and although the weather was
so violent hot, that there was no need of clothes, yet
I could not go quite naked, though I was all alone.
One reason why I could not go quite naked was,
I could not bear the heat of the sun so well when
in that state, as with some clothes on, nay, the very
heat frequently blistered my skin; whereas, with a
shirt on, the air itself made some motion, and whist-
ling under the shirt, was twofold cooler than without
it. No more could I ever bring myself to go out in
the heat of the sun without a cap or a hat, the heat'
of the sun beating with such violence as it does in
that place, would give me the headache presently,
by darting so directly on my head, without a cap or
a hat on, so that I could not bear it; whereas, if I
put on my hat, it would presently go away.
Upon these views I began to consider about putting
the few rags I had, which I called clothes, into some
order. I had worn out all the waistcoats I had, and
my business was now to try if I could not make
jackets out of the great watch-coats which I had by
me, and with such other materials as I had; so I set
to work a tailoring, or rather indeed a botching, for
I made most piteous work of it. However, I made
shift to make- two or three new waistcoats, which I hoped would serve me a great while; as for breeches
or drawers, I made but very sorry shift indeed, till
afterwards.
I have mentioned that I saved the skins of all the
creatures that I killed, I mean the four-footed ones,
and hung them up stretched out with sticks in the
sun, by which means some of them were so dry and
hard, that they were fit for little, but others were
very useful. The first thing I made of these was a
great cap for my head, with the hair on the outside
to shoot off the rain; and this I performed so well,
that, after this, I made me a suit of clothes wholly
of those skins; that is to say, a waistcoat and
breeches. open at knees, and both loose; for they
were rather wanting to keep me cool, than to keep me
warm. I must not omit to acknowledge, that they
were wretchedly made; for if I was a bad carpenter,
I was a worse tailor.
After this I spent a great deal of time and pains to
make me an umbrella: I was indeed in great want
of one, and had a great mind to make one. I had
seen them made in the Brazils, where they are very
useful in the great heats which are there, and I felt
the heats as great here, and greater too. being nearer
the equinox; besides, as I was obliged to be much
abroad, it was a most useful thing to me, as well for
the rains as the heats. I was a great while before I before I had made one to my mind; but at last I made one that answered indifferently well. The
main difficulty I found was to make it let down. I
could make it to spread, but if it did not let down
too, and draw in, it would not be portable for me any
way but just over my head, which would not do.
However, at last I made one to answer. I covered
it with skins, the hair upwards, so that it cast off
the rain like tt penthouse, and kept off the sun so
effectually, that I could walk out in the hottest of
the weather, with greater advantage than I could
before in the coolest; and when I had no need of it,
I could close it. and carry it under my arm.
Thus I lived very comfortably, my mind being
entirely composed, by resigning to the will of God,
and throwing myself wholly upon the disposal of his
providence. This made my life better than sociable;
for when I began to regret the want of conversation,
I would ask myself whether thus conversing mutually
with my own thoughts, and, as I hope I may say,
even my Maker, by ejaculations and petitions, was
not better than the utmost enjoyment of human
society in the world?
I cannot say that after this, for five years, any ex-
traordinary thing happened to me, but I lived on in
the same course, and in the same posture and place,
just as before. The chief things I was employed in,
besides my yearly labour of planting my barley and
rice, and curing my raisins, of both of which I always
kept up just enough to have sufficient stock of one
year's provisions beforehand; I say, besides this yearly labour. and my daily labour of going out with
my gun, I had another task to make me a canoe, which at last I finished. So that by digging a canal
to it six feet wide, and four feet deep, Ibrought it
into the creek almost haf a mile. As for the first, that was so vastly big, as not being able to bring it
to the water, or bring the water to it, I was obliged
to let it lie where it was, as a memorandum to teach
me to be wiser next time. The making of this latter
boat, and the canal, took me up nearly two years.
However, though my little periagna was finished,
yet the size of it was "not at all answerable to the
design which I had in view when I made the first, I
mean of venturing over to the terra firma, where it
was above forty miles broad; accordingly, the small ness of my boat assisted to put an end to that design,
and now I thought no more of it. But as I had a
boat, my next design was to make a tour round the
island; for as I had been on the other side in one
8lace, crossing, as I have already described it, over
le land, so the discoveries I made in that journey
made me very eager to see other parts of the coast.
For this purpose, and that I might do every thing
with discretion and consideration, I fitted up a little
mast to my boat, and made a sail to it out of some of
the pieces'of the ship's sails, which lay in store, and
of which I had a great stock by me.
Having fitted my mast and sail, and tried the boat,
I found she would sail very well. Then I made little
lockers or boxes at either end, to put provisions,
necessaries, and ammunition, &c. into, to be kept
dry, either from rain, or the spray of the sea, and a
hollow place I cut in the inside of the boat where I
could lay my gun, making a flap to hang down over
to keep it dry.
I fixed my umbrella also in a step at the stern, like
a mast, to stand over my head, and keep the heat of
the sun off me, like an awning; and thus I every now
and then took a little voyage upon the sea, but never
went far out, nor far from the little creek; but at
last, being eager to view the circumference of my
little kingdom, I resolved upon my tour, and accord-
ingly I victualled my ship for the voyage, putting in
two dozen of my loaves of barley bread, an earthen
pot full of parched rice, a food I eat a great deal of,
shot for killing more, and two large watch-coats, of
those which, as I mentioned before, I had saved out
of the seamen's chests; these I took, one to lie upon,
and the other to cover me in the night.
It was the 6th of November, in the sixth year of
my reign, or my captivity, that I set out on this
voyage, and I found it much longer than I expected;
for though the island itself was not very large, yet
when I came to the east side of it, I found a great
ledge of rocks lie out above two leagues into the sea,
some above water, some under it; and beyond that a
shoal of sand, lying dry, half a league more, so that I
was obliged to go a great way out to sea to double that
point. When I first discovered them, I was going to
give over my enterprise, and come back, not knowing
how far it might oblige me to go out to sea, and, above
all, doubting how I should get back again; so I came
to anchor, for I had made me a kind of anchor, with
8 piece of grappling, which I got out of the ship.
Having secured my boat, I took my gun, ana went
on shore, climbing upon a hill, which seemed to over-
look that point, where I saw the full extent of it, and
resolved to venture. In viewing the sea from that
hill where I stood, I perceived a strong and furious
current, which ran to the east, and even came close
to the point, and I took the more notice of it, because
I saw there might be some danger, that when I came
into it, I might be carried out to sea by the strength
of it, and not be able to make the island again. And
indeed, had I not gotten first upon this hill, I believe
it would have been so, for there was the same current
upon the other side of the island, only that it set off
at a farther distance, and I saw there was a strong
eddy under the shore, so that I had nothing to do but
to get in out of the first current, and I should pre-
sently be in an eddy.
I lay here, however, two days, because the wind,
blowing pretty fresh (at E.S. K. and that being just
contrary to the said current), made a breach of the
sea upon the point; so that it was not safe for me to
keep too close to the shore, for the breach, nor to go
too far off because of the stream.
The third day in the morning, the wind having
abated over night, the sea was calm, and I ventured;
but no sooner was I come to the point, when even I
was not my boat's length from the shore, but I found
myself in a great depth of water, and a current like
the sluice of a mill. It carried my boat along with
it with such violence, that all I could do, could not
keep her as much as on the edge of it; but I found
it hurried me farther out from "the eddy, which was
on the left hand. There was no wind stirring to help
me, and all that I could do with my paddles signified
nothing; and now I began to give myself over for
lost; for, as the current was on both sides of the
island, I knew in a few leagues distance they must
join again, and then I was irrecoverably gone, nor
did I see any possibility of avoiding it: so that I
had no prospect before me but of perishing, not by
the sea, for that was calm enough, but of starving
for hunger. I had indeed found a tortoise on the
shore, as big almost as I could lift, and had tossed it
into the boat; and I had a great jar of fresh water,
but what was all this to being driven into the vast
ocean, where there was no shore, no main land or
island, for a thousand leagues, at least?
And now I saw how easy it was for the providence
of God to make the most miserable condition that
one might think he was in, worse. Now I looked
upon my desolate solitary island as the most pleasant
place in the world; and all the happiness my heart
could wish for, was to be but there again. I stretched
out my hand to it with eager wishes. "O happy
desert," said I, "I shall never see thee more! O
miserable creature," said I, "whither am I going?"
Then I reproached myself with my xmthankful tem-
per, and how I had repined at my solitary condition,
and now what would I give to be on shore there
again? Thus we never see the true state of our con-
dition, till it is illustrated to us by its contraries; nor
know how to value what we enjoy, but by the want
of it. It is scarce possible to imagine the consterna-
tion I was now in, being driven from my beloved
island into the wide ocean, almost two leagues, and
in the utmost despair of ever recovering it again.
However, I worked hard, till indeed my strength
was almost exhausted, and kept my boat as much to
the northward, that is, towards the side of the cur-
rent which the eddy lay on, as possibly I could.
When about noon, as the sun passed the meridian, I thought I felt a little breeze of wind in my face,
springing from the S. S. E. This cheered my heart
a little, and especially when in about half an hour
more it blew a pretty small gentle gale. By this
time I was gotten at a frightful distance from the
island, and had the least cloud or hazy weather in-
tervened, I had been undone another way too; for I
had no compass on board, and should never have
known how to have steered towards the island, if I had but once lost sight of it; but the weather con-
tinuing clear, I applied myself to get up my mast
again, and spread my sail, standing away to the
north as much as possible, to get out of the current.
Just as I had set my mast and sail, and the boat
began to stretch away, I saw, even by the clearness
of the water, some alteration in the current was near,
for where the current was so strong, the water was
foul; but perceiving the water clear, I found the
current abate, and presently I found to the east, at
about half a mile, a breach of the sea upon some
rocks; these rocks I found caused the current to
part again, and as the main stress of it ran away
more southerly, leaving the rocks to the north-east,
so the other returned by the repulse of thejrpcks, and
made a strong eddy, which ran back again to tho
north-west, with a very sharp stream.
They who know what it is to have a reprieve
brought to them upon the ladder, or to be rescued
from the thieves just going to murder them, or who
have been in such like extremities, may guess what
my present surprise was. and how gladly I put my
boat into the stream of this eddy, and the wind also
freshening, how gladly I spread my sail to it, running
cheerfully before the wind, and with a strong tide or
eddy under foot. This eddy carried me about a
league in my way back again, directly towards the
island, but about two leagues more to the northward
than the current lay, which carried me away at first;
so that when I came near the island, I found myself
open to the northern shore of it, that is to say, the
other end of the island, opposite to that which I went
out from. When I had made something more than a
league of way, by the help of this current or eddy, I
found it was spent, and served me no farther. How-
ever, I found that being between the two great cur-
rents, viz. that on the south side, which had hurried
me away, and that on the north, which lay about
two leagues on the other side; I say, between these
two, in the west of the island, I found the water at
least still, and running no way; and having still a
breeze of wind fair for me, I kept on steering directly
for the island, though not making such fresh way as
I did before.
About four o'clock in the evening, being then within
about a league of the island, I found the point of the
rocks which had occasioned this disaster stretching
out, as is described before, to the southward, and
casting off the current more southwardly, had, of
course, made another eddy to the north: and this I found very strong, but not directly setting the way
the course lay, which was due west, but almost full
north. However, having a fresh gale, I stretched
across this eddy, slanting north-west, and in about
half an hour came within a mile of the shore, where,
it being smooth water, I soon got to land.
When I was on shore, I fell on my knees and gave
God thanks for my escape, resolving to lay aside all
thoughts of my deliverance by my boat; and re-
freshing myself with such things as I had, I brought
my boat close to the shore, in a little cove that I had
spied under some trees, and laid me down to sleep,
being nearly spent with the labour and fatigue of the
voyage.
I was now at a great loss which way to get home
with my boat. I had run so much hazard, and knew
too much the case, to think of attempting it by the
way I went out; and what might be at the other
side (I mean the west side), I knew not, nor had I any mind to run any more ventures; So I only re-
solved in the morning to make my way westward
along the shore, and see if there was no creek, where
I might lay up my frigate in safety, so as to have
her again, if I wanted her. In about three miles,
coasting along the shore, I came to a very good
inlet, or bay, about a mile over, which narrowed till
it came to a very little rivulet or brook, where I found a convenient harbour for my boat, and where
she lay as if she had been in a little dock made on
purpose for her: here I put in, and having stowed
my boat very safe, I went on shore to look about me,
and see where I was.
I soon found I had but a little passed by the place
where I had been before, when I travelled on foot to
that shore; so taking nothing out of my boat, but
my gun and my umbrella, for it was exceedingly hot,
I began my march. The way was comfortable
enough after such a voyage as I had been upon, and
I reached my old bower in the evening, where I
found every thing standing as I left it.
I got over the fence, and laid me down in the shade
to rest my limbs; for I was very weary, and fell
asleep. But judge what surprise I must be in, when
I was awaked out of my sleep, by a voice calling me
by my name several times, " Robin, Robin, Robin
Crusoe! poor Robin Crusoe! Where are you, Robin
Crusoe? Where are you? Where have you been 1"
I was so dead asleep at first, being fatigued with
rowing, or paddling as it is called, the first part of
the day, and with walking the latter part, that
I did not awake thoroughly, and dozing, between
sleeping and waking, thought that I dreamed that
somebody spoke to me. But as the voice continued
to repeat " Robin Crusoe! Robin Crusoe!" at last I began to awake more perfectly, and was at first
dreadfully frighted, and started up in the utmost
consternation. But no sooner were my eyes open,
but I saw my poll sitting on the top of a hedge, and
immediately knew it was he that spoke to me; for
just in such bemoaning language I used to talk to
him. and teach him: and he had learned it so per-
fectly, that he would sit upon my finger, and lay his
bill close to my face, and cry, " Poor Robin Crusoe!
Where are you? Where have you been? How came
you here?" and such things as I taught him.
However, even though I knew it was the parrot, it
was a good while before I could compose myself. I was first amazed how the creature got thither, and
how he should just keep about the place, and no
where else. But as I was well satisfied it could be
nobody but honest poll, I got over it; and holding
out my hand, and calling him by his name, " Poll,
the sociable creature came to me, and sat upon my
thumb, as he used to do, and continued talking to me
"Poor Robin Crusoe!" and how did I come here, and
where had I been, just as if he had been overjoyed
to see me again; and so I carried him home with me.
I had now had enough of rambling to sea for some
time, and had enough to do for many days to sit still
and reflect upon the danger I had been in. I would
have been very glad to have my boat again on my
side of the^ island; but I knew not how it was prac-
ticable to get it about. As to the east side of the
island, which I had gone round, I knew well enough
there was no venturing that way; my very heart
would shrink, and my very blood run chill, but to
think of it. And as to the other side of the island,
I did not know how it might be there; but supposing
the current ran with the same force against the shore
at the east, as it passed by it on the other, I might run
the same risk of being driven down the stream, and
carried by the island, as I had been before of being
carried away from it; so with these thoughts I con-
tented myself to be without any boat.
In this government of my temper I remained near
a year, lived a very retired life, and my thoughts being
very much composed as to my condition, and fully
comforted in resigning myself to the dispositions of
Providence, I thought I lived very happily in all
things, except that of society.
I improved myself in this time in all the mechanic
exercises which my necessities put me upon applying
myself to; and, I believe, could, upon occasion, have
made a good carpenter, considering what tools I had.
Besides this, I arrived at an unexpected perfection
in my earthenware, and contrived well enough to
make them with a wheel, which I found infinitely
easier and better, because I made things round and
shapeable, which before were filthy things indeed to
look on. But I think I never was more vain of my
own performance, or more joyful for any thing I found
out, than for my being able to make a tobacco-pipe,
and though it was a very ugly, clumsy thing, when
it was done, and only burnt red like other earthen-
ware, yet, as it was hard and firm, and would draw
the smoke, I was exceedingly comforted with it; for
I had been always used to smoke, and there were
pipes in the ship, but I forgot them at first, not know-
mg that there was tobacco in the island, and after-
wards, when I searched the ship again, I could not
come at any pipes at all. f
\ n my wicker-ware 1 also improved very much, and
made abundance of necessary baskets, as well as my
invention showed me, though not very handsome, yet
they were such as were very handy and convenient
for my laying things up in. or fetching things home
in. For example, if I killed a goat abroad, I could
hang it up in a tree, flay it, and dress it, and cut it
in pieces, and bring it home in a basket; the like by
a turtle, I could cut it up, take out the eggs, and a
piece or two of the flesh, which was enough for me,
and bring them home and leave the rest behind me.
I began now to perceive my powder abated con-
siderably, and this was a want which it was impos-
sible for me to supply, and I began seriously to con-
sider what I must do when-1 should have no more
powder; that is to say, how should do to kill any
goats. I had, as I observed in the third year of my
being here, kept a young kid, and bred Jier up tame.
I was in hopes of getting a he-kid: but I could not
by any means bring it to pass, till my kid grew an
old goat, and I could never find in my heart to kill
her, till she died at last of mere age.
Being now in the eleventh year of my residence,
and as I have said, my ammunition growing low, I set myself to study some art to trap and snare the
goats, to see whether I could not catch some of them
alive, and I wanted a-she-goat great with young.
To this purpose I made snares to hamper them,
and I do believe they were more than once taken in
them, but my tackle was not good, for I had no wire,
so I found them broken, and my bait devoured.
At length I resolved to try a pit-fall; so I dug
several large pits in the earth, in places where I had
observed the goats used to feed, and over these pits
I placed hurdles of my own making too, with a great
weight upon them; and several times I put ears of
barley and dry rice, without setting the trap, and I
could easily perceive that the goats had gone in, and
eaten up the corn, for I could see the mark of their
feet. At length, I set three traps in one night, and,
going the next morning, I found them all standing,
K
and the bait eaten. This was very discouraging, but
I altered my traps; and, going one morning, I found
a large he-goat, three kids, a male and two females.
As to the old one, I knew not what to do with him,
he was so fierce that I durst not go into the pit to
him, that is to say, to go to bring him away alive,
which was what I wanted. I could have killed him,
but that was not my business, nor would it answer
my end; so I even let him out, and he ran away as
if he had been frighted out of his wits, but I had
forgot then, what I learned afterwards, that hunger
will tame a lion. If I had let him stay there three
or four days without food, and then have carried him
some water to drink, and then a little corn, he would
have been as tame as one of the kids, for they are
very tractable, when they are well used.
However, for the present I let him go, knowing no
better at that time; then I went to- the three kids,
and, taking them one by one, I tied them with strings
together, and with difficulty brought them home.
It was some time before they would feed; but by
throwing them some sweet corn, it tempted them,
and they began to be tame. And now I found, that
if I expected to supply myself with goat's flesh, when
I had no powder or shot left, breeding some up tame
was my only way, when perhaps I might have them
about my house like a flock of sheep.
But then it presently occurred to me, that I must
keep the tame from the wild, or else they would al-
ways run wild when they grew up, and the only way
for this was to have some enclosed piece of ground,
well fenced either with hedge or pale, to keep them
up so effectually, that they could not mix together.
This was a great undertaking for one pair of hands,
yet, as I saw there was an absolute necessity of doing
it, my first piece of work was to find out a proper
piece of ground, viz. where there was likely to be
herbage for them to eat, water for them to drink, and
*over to keep them from the sun.
The place I pitched upon was a plain open piece of
meadow land, or savannah (as our people call it in
the western colonies), which had two or three little
rills of fresh water in it, and at one end was very
woody. Many will smile at my forecast, when I
shall tell them I began my enclosing this piece of
ground in such a manner, that my hedge or pale must
have been at least two miles about; Nor was the mad-
ness of it so great as to the compass, for if it was ten
miles about, I was like to have time enough to do it
in, but I did not consider that my goats would be as
wild in so much compass, as if they had had the whole
island, and I should have so much room to chase them
in, that I should never catch them.
My hedge was begun and carried on, I believe
about fifty yards, when this thought occurred to me,
so I presently stopped short, and, for the first time,
I resolved to enclose a piece of about one hundred
and fifty yards in length, and one hundred yards in
breadth, which, as it would maintain as many as I
should have in any reasonable time, so, as my flock in-
creased, I could add more ground to my enclosure.
This was acting with some prudence, and I went
to work with courage. I was about three months
hedging in the first piece, and, till I had done it, I
tethered the three kids in the best part of it, and used
to feed them as near me as possible, to make them
familiar; and very often I would go and carry them
some ears of barley,' or a handful of rice, and feed
them out of my hand, so that, after my enclosure
was finished, and I let them loose, they would follow
me up and down, bleating after me for some corn.
This answered my end, and in about a year and a
half I had a flock of about twelve goats, kids and
all, and in two years more I had three-and-forty,
besides several that I took and killed for my food;
and after that I enclosed five several pieces of ground
to feed them in," with little pens to drive them into,
to take them as I wanted them.
But this was not all; for now I not only had goat's
flesh, to feed on when I pleased, but milk too,- a thing
which indeed in the beginning I did not so much as
think of, and which, when it came into my thoughts,
was really an agreeable surprise ; for now I set up
my dairy, and had sometimes a gallon or two of milk
in a day. And as nature, who gives supplies of food
to every creature, dictates even naturally how to
make use of it, so I; that never milked a cow, much
less a goat, or saw butter or cheese made, managed
to make both.
.It would have made a Stoic smile to have seen me
and my little family sit down to dinner. There was
my majesty, the prince and lord of the whole island.
I had the lives of all my subjects at my command.
I could hang, draw, give liberty, and take it away,
and no rebels among all my subjects.
Then to see how like a king I dined too, attended
by my servants! Poll, as if he had been my favourite,
was the only one permitted to talk to me: my dog,
who was now grown very old and crazy, sat always
at my right hand; and two cats, one on each side.
But these were not the two cats which I brought
on shore at first, for they were both of them dead;
but one of them having n multiplied by I know not what
kind of a creature, these were two which I had pre-
served tame, whereas the rest ran wild in the woods,
and became troublesome to me; for they would often
come into my house and I ilunder me, till at last I was
obliged to shoot them, and kill a great many. And
in this plentiful manner I lived; neither could I be
said to want any thing b'Ut society, and of that, in
some time after this, I w< is like to have too much.
I was impatient, as I before observed, to have the
use of my boat, though loa th to run any more hazards,
and therefore sometimes I sat contriving ways to get
her about the island, and at other times I sat myself
down contented enough without her. But I had a
strange uneasiness in my mind to go down to the
point of the island, where, as I have said, in my last
ramble, I went up the hill to see how the shore lay,
and how the current sat. This inclination increased
upon me every day, and at length I resolved to travel
thither by land; and following the edge of the shore,
I did so"; but had any one in England met such
a man as I was, he must either have frighted him,
or raised a great deal of laughter, and as I frequently
stood still to look at myself, I could not but smile at
the notion of my travelling through Yorkshire with
such an equipage, and in such a dress. Be pleased
to take a sketch of my figure as follows:—I had a
great, high, shapeless cap, made of a goat's skin, with
a flap hanging down behind, as well to keep the sun
from me, as to shoot the rain off from running into
my neck; nothing being so hurtful in these climates
as the rain upon the flesh under the clothes.
I had a short jacket of goat's skin, the skirts hang-
ing down to about the middle of my thighs; and a
pair of open-knee'd breeches: the breeches were
made of the skin of an old he-goat, whose hair hung
down such a length on either side. that, like panta-
loons, it reached to the middle of my legs. Stock-
ings and shoes I had none; but I had made me a pair
of something, I scarce know what to call them, like
buskins, to nap over my legs.
I had on a broad belt of goat's skin dried, which I
drew together with two thongs of the same, instead
of buckles: and, in a kind of frog, on each side of this,
hung a saw and a hatchet. I had another belt not so
broad, fastened in the same manner, which hung over
my shoulder; and at the end of it, hung two pouches,
in which I kept my powder and shot. At my back
I carried my basket, on my shoulder my gun, and
over my head a great, clumsy, goat's-skin umbrella,
but which, after all, was the most necessary thing I
had about me, next to my gun. As for my face, the
colour of it was really not so Mulatto-like as one
might expect from a man not at all careful of it, and
living within nine or ten degrees of the equinox. My
beard I had once suffered to grow till it was about a
quarter of a yard long; but as I had scissors and
razors, I had cut it pretty short, except what grew
on my upper lip, which I had trimmed into a large
pair of Mahometan whiskers, such as I had seen wore
by some Turks whom I saw at Sallee. Of these mus tachios or whiskers, I mast say they were monstrous,
and would in England be thought frightful.
In this kind of figure I went my new journey, and
was out five or six days. I travelled first along the
sea-shore, directly to the place where I first brought
my boat to anchor, to get upon the rocks; and, not
having any boat now to take care of, I went over the
land a nearer way, to the same height that I was upon
before, when looking forward to the point of the rocks
which lay out, and which I was to double with my
boat, as I said above, I was surprised to see the sea
all smooth and quiet; no rippling, no motion, no carrent, any more there than in other places.
I was at a strange loss to understand this, and re-
solved to spend some time in observing it, to see if
nothing from the sets of the tide had occasioned it.
But I was presently convinced how it was, viz. that
the tide of ebb setting from the west, and joining the
current of waters from some great river on the shore, must be the occasion of this current; and that, ac-
cording as the wind blew more forcibly from the west,
or from the north, this current came near, or went
farther from the shore: for, waiting thereabouts till
evening, I went up to the rock again, and then the
tide of ebb being made, I plainly saw the current
again as before, only that it ran farther off, being
near half a league from the shore ; whereas, in my
case, it set close upon the shore, and hurried me in
my canoe along with it, which it would not do before.
This observation convinced me that I had nothing
to do but to observe the ebbing and the flowing of the
tide, and I might very easily bring my boat about the island again; but when I began to think of putting
it in practice, I had such a terror upon my spirits at
the remembrance of the danger I had been in, that I
could not think of it again with patience; but on the
contrary, I took up another resolution, which was
more safe, though more laborious, and this was, that
I would make me another periagua, or canoe, and so
have one on each side of the island.
You kare to understand that now I had, as I may
call it, two plantations in the island; one, my little
fortification or tent, with the wall about it under the
rock, with the cave behind me, which by this time I had enlarged into several apartments or caves, one
within another. One of these, which was the driest
and largest, and had a door out beyond my wall or
fortification, was all filled up with large earthen
pots, and with fourteen or fifteen great baskets,
which would hold five or six bushels each, where I laid up 'my stores of provision, especially my corn,
some in the ear cut off short from the straw, and the
other rubbed out with my hand.
As for my wall, made, as before, with long stakes
or piles, those piles grew all like trees, and were by
this time grown so big, and spread so very much,
that there was not the least appearance of any habi-
tation behind them. Near this dwelling of mine,
but a little farther within the land, and upon lower
ground, lay my two pieces of corn-ground, which I kept duly cultivated and sowed, and which always
yielded me their harvest in its season; and whenever
I had occasion for more corn, I had more land adjoin-
ing as fit as that.
Besides this, I had my country seat, and I had
now a tolerable plantation there also. For, first, I had my little bower, as I called it, which I kept in
repair, that is to say, I kept the hedge which circled
it in constantly fitted up to its usual height, the
ladder standing always in the inside. I kept the
trees, which at first were no more than my stakes,
but were now grown very firm and tall; I kept them
always so cut, that they might spread and grow
thick and wild, and make the more agreeable shade,
which they did effectually to my mind. In the
middle of this I had my tent always standing, being
a piece of a sail spread over poles set up for that
purpose, and which never wanted any repair or re-
newing; and under this I had made me a squab or
couch, with the skins of the creatures I had killed,
and with other soft things, and a blanket laid on
them, such as belonged to oar sea-bedding, which I had saved, and a great watch-coat to cover me: and
here, whenever I had occasion to be absent from my
chief seat, I took up my country habitation.
Adjoing to this, I had my enclosures for my goats;
and as I had taken a deal of pains to fence and en-
close this ground, I was so uneasy lest the goats
should break through, that I never left off, till, with
infinite labour, I had stuck the outside of the hedges
so full of small stakes, and so near to one another,
that it was rather a pale than a hedge, and there was
scarce room to put a hand through between them,
which afterwards, when those stakes grew, as they
all did in the next rainy season, made the enclosure
strong like a wall, indeed stronger than my wall.
This will testify for me that I was not idle, and
that I spared no pains to bring to pass whatever ap-
peared necessary for my comfortable support; for I
considered the keeping rap a breed of tame creatures
thus at my hand would be a living magazine of flesh,
milk, butter, and cheese for me, as long as I lived in
the place, if it were to be forty years; and that keep-
ing them within my reach depended entirely upon
my perfecting my enclosures to such a degree, that
I might be sure of keeping them together, which by
this method was effectually secured, and when these
little stakes began to grow, they were planted so very
thick, that I was forced to pull some of them up again.
In this place also I had my grapes growing, which
I principally depended on for my winter store of
raisins, and which I never failed to preserve very
carefully, as the best and most agreeable dainty of
my whole diet; and they were physical, wholesome,
nourishing, and refreshing.
As this was also about half way between my other
habitation and the place where I had laid up my boat,
I generally staid and lay here in my way thither, for
I used frequently to visit my boat, and I kept all
things about it in very good order. Sometimes I
went out in it to divert myself, but no more hazardous
voyages would go, nor scarce ever above a stone's
cast or two from the shore. But now I come to a
new scene of my life.
It happened one day about noon, going towards
my boat, I was greatly surprised with the print of a
man's naked foot on the shore, which was very plain
to be seen in the sand. I stood like one thunder-
struck, or as if I had seen an apparition. I listened,
I looked round me; I could hear or see nothing. I
went up to the rising ground to look farther. I went
up the shore and down the shore, but it was all one;
I could see no other impression but that one. I went
to it again to see if it might not be fancy; but there
was no room for that, for there was exactly the very
print of a foot, toes, heel, and every part of a foot:
now it came thither I knew not, nor could in the
least imagine. But after many fluttering thoughts,
I came home to my fortification, not feeling, as we
say, the ground I went on, but terrified to the last
degree, looking behind me at every two or three steps,
mistaking every bush and tree, and fancying every
stump at a distance to be a man. Nor is it possible to
describe how many various shapes an affrighted
imagination represented things to me in.
When I came to my castle, I fled into it like one
pursued: whether I went over by the ladder, as first
contrived, or went in at the hole in the rock, which
I called a door, I cannot remember; for never frighted
hare fled to cover, or fox to earth, with more terror of
mind than I to this retreat.
I had no sleep that night. The farther I was from
the occasion of my fright, the greater my apprehen-
sions were; which is something contrary to the
nature of such things, and especially to the usual
practice of all creatures in fear. But I was so em-
barrassed with my own frightful ideas of the thing,
that I formed nothing but dismal imaginations to
myself, even though I was now a great way off it.
Sometimes I fancied it must be the devil; and reason
joined in with me upon this supposition; for how
should any other thing in human shape come into the
place? Where was the vessel that brought them?
What marks were there of any other footsteps? And
how was it possible a man should come there? But
then to think that Satan should take human shape
upon him in such a place, where there could be no
manner of occasion for it, but to leave the print of
his foot behind him, and that even for no purpose,
this was an amazement to me the other way. I con-
sidered that the devil might have found out abundance
of other ways to have terrified me, than the single
print of a foot; that as I lived quite on the other
side of the island, he would never have been so simple
to leave a mark in the place where it was ten thousand
to one whether I should see it or not, and in the sand
too, which the first surge of the sea, upon a high wind,
would have defaced entirely. All this seemed incon-
sistent with all notions we usually entertain of the
subtlety of the devil.
Such ideas as these assisted to argue me out of all
apprehensions of its being the devil; and I concluded
that it must be some more dangerous creature, viz.
that it must be some of the savages of the main land
over against me, who had wandered out to sea in
their canoes, and, either driven by the currents, or
by contrary winds, had made the island; and had
been on shore, but were gone away again to sea, being
as loath, perhaps, to have staid in this desolate
island, as I would have been to have had them.
While these reflections were passing in my mind,
I was very thankful that I was not thereabouts at
that time, or that they did not see my boat, by which
they would have concluded that some inhabitants
had been in the place, and perhaps have searched
farther for me. Then terrible thoughts racked my
imagination about their having found my boat, and
that there were people here; and that, if so, I should
certainly have them come again in greater numbers,
and devour me; and that if they should not find me,
yet they would find my enclosure, destroy all my
corn, carry away all my flock of tame goats, and I should perish at last for mere want.
Thus my fear banished all my religious hope; all
that former confidence in God, which was founded
upon such wonderful experience as I had had of his
goodness, now vanished; as if he that had fed me by
miracle hitherto, could not preserve by his power the
provision which he had made for me by his goodness.
I reproached myself for not sowing more corn one
year than would just serve me till next season, as if
nothing could happen to prevent my enjoying the
crop that was upon the ground; and this I thought
so j ust a reproof, that I resolved for the future to have
two or three years' corn before-hand; so that what-
ever might come, I might not perish for want of bread.
These thoughts took me up many hours, days, nay,
weeks and months; and one particular 'effect of my
cogitations on this occasion I cannot omit, viz. one
morning early, lying in my bed, and filled with
thoughts about my danger from the appearance of
savages, I found it discomposed me very much;
upon which those words of the Scripture came into
my thoughts, " Call on me in the day of trouble, and
I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me."
Upon this, rising cheerfully out of my bed, my
heart was not only comforted, but I was guided and
encouraged to pray earnestly to God for deliverance.
When I had done praying, I took up my Bible, and
opening it to read, the first words presented to me
were, " Wait on the Lord, and be of good cheer, and
he shall strengthen thy heart; wait, I say, on the
Lord." It is impossible to express the comfort this
gave me, and in return I thankfully laid down the
book, and was no more sad, at least on that occasion.
In the middle of these cogitations, apprehensions,
and reflections, it came into my thoughts one day,
that all this might be a mere chimera of my own,
and that thisjfoot might be the print of my own foot,
when I came on shore from my boat. This cheered
me up a little too, and I began to persuade myself it
was all a delusion; that it was nothing else but my
own foot; and why might not I come that way from
the boat,as well as I was going that way to the boat?
Again, I considered also, that I could by no means
tell for certain where I had trod, and where I had
not; and that if at last this was only the print of my
own foot, I had played the part of those fools, who
strive to make stories of spectres and apparitions, and
then are themselves frightened at them more than
any body else.
Now I began to take courage, and to peep abroad
again; for I had not stirred out of my castle for three
days and nights, so that I began to starve for provi-
sions, for I had little or nothing within doors, but
some barley cakes and water. Then I knew that my
goats wanted to be milked too, which usually was
evening diversion, and the poor creatures were in
great pain and inconvenience for want of it.
Heartening myself therefore with the belief, that
this was nothing but the print of one of my own feet,
I began to go abroad again, and went to my country
house to milk my flock; but to see with what fear I went forward, how often I looked behind me, and was
ready every now and then, to lay down my basket,
and run for my life, it would have made any one have
thought I was haunted with an evil conscience, or
that I had lately been frightened.
However, as I went on thus two or three days, and
had seen nothing, I began to be bolder, and to think
there was nothing in it but my own imagination; but
I could not persuade myself fully to this, till I should
go down to the shore again, and see this print of a
foot, and measure it by my own, and see if there was
any similitude or fitness, that I might be assured it
was my own foot. But when I came to the place, it
appeared evidently to me, that when I laid up my
boat, I could not possibly be on shore any where there-
abouts. Secondly, when I came to measure the mark
with my foot, I found my foot not so large by a great
deal; both these things filled my head with new ima-
ginations, and gave me the vapours again, so that I shook with cold, like one in an ague, and I went home
again, filled with the belief that some man or men
had been on shore there ; or, in short that the island
was inhabited, and I might be surprised before I was aware; and what course to take 1 knew not.
O what ridiculous resolutions men take, when pos-
sessed with fear! It deprives them of the use of
those means which reason offers for their relief. The
first thing I proposed to myself was, to throw down
my enclosures, and turn all my tame cattle wild into
the woods, that the enemy might not find them, and
then frequent the island in prospect of the same, or
the like booty; then the simple thing of digging up
my two corn fields, that they might not find such a
grain there, and still be prompted to frequent the
island; then to demolish my bower and tent, that
they might not see any vestiges of habitation, and be
tempted to look farther, in order to find out the per-
sons that were inhabitating it.
These were the subjects of the first night's cogita-
tion, after I was come home again, while the appre-
hensions which had so overrun my mind were fresh upon me, and my head was full of vapors, as above.
Thus fear of danger is ten thousand times more ter-
rifying than danger itself when apparent to the eyes,
and we find the burden of anxiety greater by much,
than the evil which we are anxious about; but, what
is worse than all this, I had not that relief in this
trouble from the resignation I used to practice, that
I hoped to have. I looked, I thought, like Saul, who
complained not only that the Philistines were upon
him, but that God had forsaken him; for I did not
now take due ways to compose my mind, by crying
to God in my distress, and resting upon his provi-
dence, as I had done before, for my defense and deli-
verance ; which if I had done, I had, at least, been
more cheerfully supported under this new surprise,
and perhaps carried through it with more resolution.
This confusion of my thoughts kept me waking all
night; but, in the morning, I fell asleep, and having,
by the amusement of my mind, been, as it were, tired,
and my spirits exhausted, I slept very soundly, and
awaked much better composed than if had ever been
before. And now I began to think sedately ; and,
upon the utmost debate with myself, I concluded, that
this island, which was so exceeding pleasant, fruit-
ful, and no farther from the main land than as I had
seen, was not so entirely abandoned as I might ima-
gine: that although there were no stated inhabitants
who lived on this spot, yet that there might some-
times come boats off from the shore, who either with
design, or perhaps never but when they were driven
by cross winds, might come to this place; that I had
lived fifteen years now, and had not met with the
least shadow or figure of any people before ; and that
if at any time they should be driven here, it was pro-
bable they went away again as soon as they could,
seeing they had never thought fit to fix here, upon
any occasion, to this time; that the most I could sug-
gest any danger from, was, from any such casual ac-
cidental landing of straggling people from the main;
who were driven here against their wills, so that they
made no stay here, but went off again with all pos-
sible speed, seldom staying one night on shore, lest
they should not have the help of the tides and day-
light back again; and that therefore I had nothing
to do but consider of some retreat, in case I should
see any savages land upon the spot.
Now I began sorely to repent, that I had dug my
cave so large as to bring a door through again, which
door, as I said, came out beyond where my fortifica-
tion joined to the rock. Upon maturely considering
this, therefore, I resolved to draw me a second forti-
fication, in the same manner of a semicircle, at a dis-
tance from my wall, where I had planted a double
row of trees, above twelve years before, of which I made mention. These trees having been planted so
thick before, there wanted but a few piles to be driven
between them, that they might be much thicker and
stronger, and my wall would be soon finished.
So that I had now a double wall, and my outer one
was thickened with pieces of timber, old cables, and
every thing that I could think of to make it strong; having in it seven little holes, about as big as I could
put my arm out at. In the inside of this I thickened
my wall to about ten feet thick, continually bringing
earth out of my cave, and laying it at the foot of my
wall, and walkmgupon it: and through the seven holes
I contrived to plant the muskets, of which I have men-
tioned that I got seven on shore out of the ship; and
these I planted like cannon, and fitted them into
frames that held them like a carriage, that so I could
fire all the seven guns in two minutes' time. This
wall I was many a weary month in finishing, and yet
never thought myself safe till it was done.
When this was done, I stuck all the ground with-
out my wall, for a great space every way, full with
stakes or sticks of the osier-like wood, which I found
so apt to grow, as they could stand, insomuch that I
believe that there must have been set in near twenty
thousand of them, leaving a pretty large space be-
see the enemy, and that they might have no shelter
from the young trees, if they approached my wall.
Thus, in two years' time, I had a thick grove; and,
in five or six years' time, I had a wood before my
dwelling grown so monstrous thick and strong that
it was indeed perfectly impassable: and no man, of
what kind soever, would ever imagine that there
was any thing beyond it, much less a habitation. As
for the way I proposed to myself to go in and out
(for I left no avenue), it was by setting two ladders,
one to a part of the rock which was low, and broke
in, and left room to place another ladder upon that,
so when the two ladders were taken down, no man
living could come down to me without injuring him-
self; and if they had come down, they were still on
the outside of my outer wall.
Thus I took all the measures human prudence could
suggest for my own preservation; and it will be seen,
at length, that they were not altogether without just
reason, though I foresaw nothing at that time, more
than fear suggested to me.
While this was doing, I was not altogether careless
of my other affairs; for I had great concern upon me
for my little herd of goats; they were not only a pre-
sent supply to me upon every occasion, and began to
be sufficient for me, without the expense of powder
and shot, but also abated the fatigue of my hunting
after wild ones, and I was loath to lose the advantage
of them, and to have them all to nurse up again.
To this purpose, I could think of but two ways to
preserve them; one was to find another convenient
place to dig a cave under ground, and to drive them
into it every night; and the other was to enclose two
or three little bits of land, remote from one another,
and as much concealed as could be, where I might
keep about half a dozen young goats in each place,
so that if any disaster happened to the flock in gene-
ral, I might be able to raise them again with little
trouble and time; and though it would require much
time and labour, I thought this was the best design.
Accordingly I spent some time to find out the most retired parts of the island; and I pitched upon one
which was as private as my heart could wish; for it
was a little damp piece of ground in the middle of the
hollow and thick woods, where, as is observed, I al-
most lost myself once before, endeavoring to come
back that way from the eastern part of the island.
Here I found a clear piece of land, near three acres,
so surrounded with woods, that it was almost an en-
closure by nature.
I immediately went to work at this piece of ground,
and, in less than a month's time. I had so fenced it
round, that my flock would be well enough secured in
it. So, without any further delay, I removed ten she-
goats and two he-goats to this place; and when they
were there, I continued to perfect the fence, till I had
made it as secure as the other.
All this labour I was at the trouble of. was purely
from my apprehensions on account of the print of a
man's foot which I had seen, for as yet I never saw
any human creature come near the island; and I had
now lived two years in this uneasiness, which indeed
made my life much less comfortable than it was before,
and this I must observe, that the discomposure of my
mind had too great impressions also upon the religi-
ous part of my thoughts; for the dread and terror of
falling into the hands of savages and cannibals lay so
upon my spirits, that I seldom found myself in a due
temper for application to my Maker, at least not with
the sedate calmness and resignation of soul which I
was wont to do. I rather prayed to God as under
great affliction and pressure of mind, surrounded by
danger, and in expectation every night of being mur-
dered and devoured before morning, and I must tes-
tify, from my own experience, that a temper of peace,
thankfulness, love and affection, is much more the
proper frame for prayer, than that of terror and dis-
L
composure; a man is more fit for a comforting per-
formance of the duty of praying to God, than he is
for repentance on a sick bed, for these discomposures
affect the mind as the others do the body, and the
discomposure of the mind must necessarily be as great
a disability as that of the body, and much greater,
praying being an act of the mind, not of the body.
But to go on; after I had thus secured one part of
my little living stock, I went about the whole island,
searching for another private place, to make such
another deposit; when wandering more to the west
point of the island than I had ever done yet, and look-
mg out to sea, I thought I saw a boat upon the sea,
at a great distance. I had found a perspective glass
or two in one of the seamen's chests which I had saved
out of our ship, but I had it not about me, and this
was so remote that I could not tell what to make of
it, though I looked at it till my eyes were not able to
hold to look any longer. Whether it was a boat or
not, I did not know; but as I descended from the
hill, I could see no more of it, so I gave it over; only
I resolved to go no more without a prospective glass.
When I was .come down the hill, to the end of the
island, where I had never been before, I was presently
convinced that the seeing the print of a man's foot
was not such a strange thing in the island as I ima-
gined; and, but that it was a special providence that
I was cast upon the side of the island where the sa-
vages never came, I should have easily known that
nothing was more frequent than for the canoes from
the main, when they happened to be a little too far
out at sea, to shoot over to that side of the island for
harbour; likewise, as they often met, and fought in
their canoes, the victors, having taken any prisoners,
would bring them over to this shore, where, according
to their dreadful customs, being all cannibals, they
would kill and eat them. Of which hereafter.
When I was come down the hill to the shore, as I said above, being the S. W. point of the island, I was
perfectly confounded and amazed; nor is it possible
for me to express the horror of my mind, at seeing
the shore spread with skulls, hands, feet, and other
bones of human bodies: and particularly I observed
a place where there had been a fire made, and a circle
dug in the earth, like a cockpit, where it is supposed
the savage wretches had sat down to their inhuman
feastings upon the bodies of their fellow creatures.
I was so astonished with the sight of these things,
that I entertained no notions of any danger to myself
from it for a long while; all my apprehensions were
buried in the thoughts of such a pitch of inhuman,
hellish brutality, and the horror of the degeneracy of
human nature, which, though I had heard of often,
yet I never had so near a view of before; in short, I
turned away my face from the horrid spectacle; my
stomach grew sick, and I was just at the point of
fainting, when nature discharged the disorder from
my stomach; and, having vomited, I was relieved,
but could not bear to stay in the place a moment; so
1 got up the hill again, with all the speed I could,
and walked on towards my own habitation.
When I came a little out of that part of the island,
I stood still awhile as amazed, and then recovering
myself, I looked up with the utmost affection of my
soul, and with aflood of tears in my eyes, gave God
thanks, that had cast my first lot in a part of the
world where I was distinguished from such dreadful
creatures as these, and that though I had esteemed
my present condition very miserable, had yet given
me so many comforts in it, that I had still more to
give thanks for, than to complain of; and this above
all, that I had, even in this miserable condition, been
comforted with the knowledge of Himself, and the
hope of his blessing, which was a felicity more than
sufficiently equivalent to all the misery which I had
suffered, or could suffer.
In this frame of thankfulness I went home to my
castle, and began to be much easier now, as to the
safety of my circumstances, than ever I was before,
for I observed that these wretches never came to this
island in search of what they could get; perhaps
not wanting, or not expecting any thing here; and
having often, no doubt, been up in the covered woody
part of it without finding any thing to their purpose.
I knew I had been here now almost eighteen years,
and never saw the least footsteps of human creature
here before; and might be here eighteen more as
entirely concealed as I was now, if I did not discover
myself to them, which I had no manner of occasion
to do, it being my only business to keep myself en-
tirely concealed where I was, unless I found better
creatures than cannibals to make myself known to.
Yet I entertained such an abhorrence of the savage
wretches, and of the wretched inhuman custom of
their devouring and eating one another up, that I
continued pensive and sad, and kept close within my
own circle for almost two years after this. When I say my own circle, I mean by it my three plantations,
viz. my castle, my country seat, which I called my
bower, and my enclosure in the woods; nor did I look
after this for any other use than as an enclosure for
my goats; for the aversion nature gave me to these
hellish wretches was such, that I was as fearful of
seeing them as of seeing the devil himself. Nor did
I so much as go to look after my boat in all this time,
but began rather to think of making me another;
for I could not think of making any more attempts
to bring the boat round the island to me, lest I should
meet with some of these creatures at sea, into whose
hands, if I had happened to have fallen, I knew what
would have been my lot.
Time, however, and the satisfaction I had that I
was in no danger of being discovered by these people,
began to wear off my uneasiness about them, and I
began to live just in the same composed manner as
before, only with this difference, that I used more
caution, and kept my eyes more about me than I did before, lest I should happen to be seen by any of them;
and particularly I was more cautious in firing my
gun, lest any of them being on the island should
happen to hear it; and it was therefore a very good
providence to me that I had furnished myself with a
tame breed of goats, that I needed not hunt any more
about the woods, or shoot at them; and if I did catch
any of them after this, it was by traps and snares, as
1 Iiaddone before: so that for two years after this I believe I never fired my gun once on, though I never
went out without it; and, which was more, as I had
saved three pistols out of the ship, I always carried
them out with me, or at least two of them, sticking
them in my goat-skin belt; I likewise polished up
one of the great cutlasses that I had out of the ship,
and made me a belt to put it in also; so that I was
BOW a most formidable fellow to look at when I went
abroad, if you add to the former description of myself
the particular of two pistols, and a great broadsword
hanging at my side in a belt, but without a scabbard.
Things going on thus, as I have said, for some time,
I seemed, excepting these cautions, to be reduced to
my former calm, sedate way of living. All these
things tended to showing me, more and more, how far
my condition was from being miserable, compared
to some others, nay, to many other particulars of life,
which it might have pleased God to have made my
lot. It put me upon reflecting how little repining
there would be among mankind, at any condition of
life, if people would rather compare their condition
with those that are worse, in order to be thankful,
than be always comparing them with those which are
better to assist their murmurings and complainings.
As in my present condition there were not really
many things which I wanted, so indeed I thought
that the frights I had been in about these savage
wretches, and the concern I had been in for my own
preservation, had taken off the edge of my invention
i'or my own conveniences; and I had dropped a good
design, which I had once bent my thoughts upon, and
that was, to try if I could not make some of my
barley into malt, and then try to brew myself some
beer. This was really a whimsical thought, and I
reproved myself often for the simplicity of it; for I presently saw there would be the want of several
things necessary to the making my beer that it would
be impossible for me to supply; as, first, casks to
preserve it in, which was a thing that, as I have ob-
served already, I could never compass, no, though I spent not many days, but weeks, nay months, in
attempting it, but to no purpose. In the next
place, I had no hops, to make it keep, no yeast,
to make it work, ana no copper to make it boil; and
yet, had not all these intervened, I mean the frights
and terrors I was in about the savages, I had under-
taken it, and perhaps brought it to pass too; for I seldom gave over any thing without accomplishing
it, when I once had it in my head enough to begin it.
But my invention now ran quite another way, for
night and day I could think of nothing but how I might destroy some of these monsters in their cruel
and bloody entertainment, and, if possible, save the
victim they should bring hither to destroy. i t would
take up a larger volume than this whole work is in-
tended to be, to set down all the contrivances I laid
down in my thoughts, for destroying these creatures,
or at least frightening them, so as to prevent their
coming hither any more, but all was abortive; nothing
could be possible to take effect, unless I was to be
there to do it" myself; and what could one man do
among them, when perhaps there might be twenty or
thirty of them together, with their darts, or their
bows and arrows, with which they could shoot as true
to a mark as I could with my gun.
Sometimes I contemplated to dig a hole under the
place where they made their fire, and put in five or
six pounds of gunpowder, which, when they kindled
their fire. would consequently ignite, and blow up
all that was near It. But, as I had not quite one
barrel of powder left, I was loath to spend so much
on them; neither could I be sure of its going off at
one certain time, when it might surprise them; and
and at best that it would do little more than just
blow the fire about their ears, and fright them, but
not sufficient to make them forsake the place; so I laid it aside, and then proposed that I would place
myself in ambush, in some convenient place, with
my three guns, all double loaded, and, in the middle
ot their bloody ceremony, let fly at them, when I
should be sure to kill or wound perhaps two or three
at every shot, and then falling in upon them with
my three pistols and my sword, I made no doubt but
that if there were twenty I should kill them all.
I went so far with it in my imagination, that I
spent several days to find out proper places to put
myself in ambuscade, to watch for them, and I went
frequently to the place itself; but the horror I had
at the Jj>lace, and at the signals of the barbarous
wretches devouring one another, made me shudder.
At length I found a place in the side of the hill,
where I was satisfied I might securely wait till I saw
any of their boats coming, and might then, even be-
fore they would be ready to come on shore, convey
myself unseen into thickets of the trees, in one of
which there was a hollow large enough to conceal
me entirely, and where I might sit and observe all
their bloody doings, and take aim at their heads,
when they were so close together as that it would be
nearly impossible that I should miss them, or that I
could fail wounding three or four at the first shot.
In this place, then, I resolved to fix my design,
and accordingly I prepared two muskets, and my
fowling piece. The two muskets I loaded with a
brace of slugs each, and four or dive smaller bullets,
about the size of pistol bullets, and the fowling- piece
I loaded with near a handful of swan-shot, of the
largest size. I also loaded my pistols with about
four bullets each ; and in this posture, well provided
with ammunition for a second and third charge, I
prepared myself for my expedition.
After I had thus laid the scheme for my design,
I continually made my tour every morning up to the
top of the hill, which was from my castle, as I called
it, about three miles or more, to see if I could observe
any boats upon the sea, coming near the island, or
standing over towards it; but I began to tire of this
hard duty, after I had for two or three months con-
stantly kept my watch, and come always back with-
out any discovery, there having not in all that time
been the least appearance, not only on or near the
shore, but not on the whole ocean, so far as my eyes
or glasses could reach every way. As long as I kept
<ip the daily tour to the hill to look out, so long also
I kept up the vigour of my design; and my spirits
seemed to be all the while in a suitable frame for so
outrageous an execution as the killing twenty or
thirty naked savages for an offence which I had not
at all entered into a discussion of in my thoughts,
any farther than my passions were at first fired by
the horror I conceived at the unnatural custom of
the people of that country, who, it seems, had been
suffered by Providence, in his wise disposition of the
world, to have no other guide than that of their own
abominable and vitiated passions, and consequently
were left, and perhaps had been for ages, to act such horrid things, and receive such horrid customs, as
nothing but nature, entirely abandoned by Heaven,
could have run them into. But then, after cool re-
flection, I began to consider what it was I was going
to engage in; what authority or call I had to pretend
to be judge and executioner upon these men as cri-
minals, whom Heaven had thought fit, for so many
ages, to suffer, unpunished, to co on, and to be, as it
were, the executioner of his judgments upon one
another; also how far these people were offenders
against me, and what right I had to engage in the
quarrel of that blood which they shed promiscnously
one upon another. I debated this very often with
myself thus: how do I know what God himself
judges in this particular case? It is certain these
people do not commit this as a crime: it is not
against their own consciences reproving, or their
light reproaching them. They do not know it to be
an offence, and then commit it in defiance of Divine
justice, as we do in almost all the sins we commit.
They think it no more a crime to kill a captive taken
in war, than we do to kill an ox; or to eat human
flesh, than we do to eat mutton.
When I had considered this a little, it followed
necessarily that I was certainly in the wrong in it;
that these people were not murderers in the sense
that I had before condemned them in my thoughts,
any more than those Christians were murderers who
often put to death the prisoners taken in battle. or
more frequently, upon many occasions, put whole
troops of men to the sword, without giving quarter,
though they threw down their arms and submitted.
These considerations really put me to a pause, and
I began to conclude that I had taken wrong measures
in my resolution to attack the savages; that it was
not my business to meddle with them, unless they
first attacked me, and this it was my business, if
possible, to prevent; but that if I were discovered
and attacked, then I knew my duty.
On the other hand, I argued with myself that this
really was the way not to deliver myself, but entirely
to ruin and destroy myself; for unless I was sure to
kill every one that not only should be on shore at that
time, but that should ever come on shore afterwards,
if but one of them escaped to tell their country people
what had happened, they would come over again by
thousands to revenge the death of their fellows, and
I should only bring upon myself a certain destruction,
which, at present I had no manner of occasion for.
Upon the whole, I concluded that neither in prin-
ciples or policy I ought, one way or other, to concern
myself in this affair; that my business was, by all
possible means, to conceal myself from them, and not
to leave the least signal to them to guess by that
there were any living human creatures upon the island.
Religion joined in with this prudential resolution;
and I was convinced that I was perfectly out of my
duty when I was laying all my bloody schemes for
the destruction of innocent creatures; I mean inno-
cent as to me. As to the crimes they were guilty of
towards one another, I had nothing to do with them:
they were national, and I ought to leave them to the
justice of God, who is the Governor of nations, and
knows how to bring public judgments upon those
who offend in a public manner, by such ways as best
please him.
This appeared so clear to me now, that nothing
was a greater satisfaction to me than that I had not
been suffered to do a thing which I now saw so much
reason to believe would have been no less a sin than
that of wilful murder, if I had committed it; and I
gave most humble thanks on my knees to God, that
had thus delivered me from blood-guiltiness, beseech-
ing him to grant me the protection of his providence, that I might not lay my hands upon them, unless I
had a more clear call from Heaven to do it, in defence
of my own life.
In this disposition I continued for near a year, and
in all that time I never once went up the hill to see
whether there were any of them in sight, or to know
whether any of them had been on shore there or not;
only this I did, I went and removed my boat, which
I had on the other side of the island, and carried it
down to the east end of the whole island, where I
ran it into a little cove, which I found under some
high rocks, and where I knew, by reason of the cur-
rents, the savages durst not, at least would not, come
with their boats, upon any account whatever.
With my boat I carried away every thing I had
left there belonging to it, viz. a mast and sail,
which I had made for it, and a thing like an anchor.
All these I removed, that there might not be the
least shadow of any discovery, or any appearance of
;uiy boat, or any human habitation upon the island.
Besides this, I kept myself more retired than ever,
and seldom went from my cell, except to milk my
she-goats, and manage my little flock in the wood,
which, as it was on the other part of the island, was
quite out of danger; for the savages seldom wandered
off from the coast. I looked back with some horror
upon the thoughts of what my condition would have
been, if I had chopped upon them, and been discovered
beforetime, when naked and unarmed, except with
one gun, and that loaded often only with small shot.
I walked every where peeping and peering about the
island, to see what I could get; what a surprise
should I have been in, if, when I discovered the print
of a man's foot, I had. instead of that, seen fifteen or
twenty savages, and found them pursuing me, and,
by the swiftness of their running, no possibility of
my escaping them.
The thoughts of this sometimes sunk my very soul
within me, and distressed my mind so much, that I
could not recover it. Indeed, after seriously think-
ing of these things, I would be very melancholy, and
sometimes it would last a great while; but I resolved
it at last into thankfulness to that Providence which
had delivered me from so many unseen dangers, and
had kept me from those mischiefs which I could no
way have been the agent in delivering myself from;
because I had not the least notion of any such thing
depending, or any supposition of its being possible.
This renewed a contemplation which often had
come to my thoughts in former times, when first I began to see the merciful dispositions of Heaven, in
the dangers we had run through in this life: how
wonderfully we are delivered, when we know nothing
of it; how when we are in a doubt or hesitation,
whether to go this way, or that way, a secret hint
should direct us this way, when we intended to go
that way; nay, when sense, our own inclination,
and perhaps business, has called to go the other way,
yet a strange impression upon the mind, from we
know not what springs, and by we know not what
power, shall over-rule us to go this way; and it shall
afterwards appear that had we gone that way which
we should have gone, and even to our imagination
ought to have gone, we should have been ruined and
lost. Upon these, and many like reflections, I after-
wards made it a certain rule with me, that whenever
I found these secret hints, or presages of my mind,
to doing or not doing any thing that presented, or to
going this way or that way, I never failed to obey
the secret dictate, though I knew no other reason
for it than that such a pressure hung upon my mind.
I cannot but advise all considering men, whose lives
are attended with such extraordinary incidents as
mine, or even though not so extraordinary, not to
slight such secret intimations of Providence, let them
come from what invisible intelligence they will, that
I shall not discuss, and perhaps cannot account for;
but certainly they are a proof of the converse of
spirits, and the secret communication between those
embodied and those unembodied, and such a proof as
can never be withstood.
I believe the reader of this will not think it strange
if I confess that these anxieties, these constant dan-
gers I lived in, and the concern that was now upon
me, put an end to all invention, and to all the con-
trivances that I had laid for my future accommoda-
tions and conveniences. I had the care of my safety
more now upon my hands than that of my food. I
cared not to drive a nail, or chop a stick of wood
now, for fear the noise I should make would be heard,
much less would I fire a gun for the same reason:
and, above all, I was very uneasy at making any fire,
lest the smoke, which is visible at a great distance
in the day, should betray me; and for this reason I removed that part of my business which required
fire, such as burning of pots and pipes, &c. into my
new apartment in the woods, where, after I had been
some time, I found, to my unspeakable consolation,
a mere natural cave in the earth, which went a vast
way, and where, I dare say, no savage, had he been
at the mouth of it, would be so hardy as to venture
in; nor indeed would any man else, but one who,
like me, wanted nothing so much as a safe retreat.
The mouth of this hollow was at the bottom of a
great rock, where (by mere accident I would say, if
I did not see abundant reason to ascribe such things
now to providence), I was cutting down some thick
branches of trees to make charcoal; and before I go
on, I must observe the reason of my making this
charcoal, which was thus:—I was afraid of making
a smoke about my habitation, as I said before; and
yet I could not live there without baking my bread,
cooking my meat, &c.; so I contrived to burn some
wood here, as I had seen done in England, under turf
till it became chark or dry coal; and then putting
the fire out, I preserved the coal to carry home, and
performed the other services which fire was wanting
for at home, without danger of smoke.
While I was cutting down some wood here, I per-
ceived that, behind a very thick branch of low brush-
wood, or underwood, there was a kind of hollow
place. I was curious to look into it, and gettingwith difficulty into the mouth of it, I found it was pretty
large, that is to say, sufficient for me to stand upright
in it, and perhaps another with me: but I must con-
fess to you, I made more haste out than I did in,
when looking farther into the place, which was per-
fectly dark, I saw two broad shining eyes of some
creature, whether devil or man I know not, which
twinkled like two stars; the dim light from the cave's
mouth shining directly in, and making the reflection.
However, after some time, I recovered myself, and
began to call myself a thousand fools, and teli my-
self, that he that was afraid to see the devil, was not
fit to live twenty years in an island all alone, and that
perhaps there was nothing in this cave that was more
frightful than myself. Upon this, plucking up my
courage, I took up a great firebrand, and in I rushed
again, with the stick in my hand. I had not gone
above three steps in, but I was almost as frighted as
I was before, for I heard a very loud sigh, like that
of a man in some pain, and it was followed by a noise,
like words half expressed, and then a deep sigh again.
I stepped back, and was indeed struck with such sur-
prise, that it put me into a cold sweat, and if I had
had a hat on my head, I think my hair would have
lifted it off. But still plucking up my spirits, as well
as I could, and encouraging myself a little, with con-
sidering that the power and presence of God was
every where, and was able to protect me, I stepped
forward again, and by the light of the firebrand, I saw
lying on the ground, a monstrous frightful old he-
goat, just making his will, as we say, gaspingfor life,
and dying of mere old age.
I stirred him a little, to see if I could get him out,
and he strived to get up, but he was not able to raise
himself, and I thought he should even lie there, for
if he had frighted me so, he would certainly fright
any of the savages, if any of them should be hardy
enough to come in there, while he had life in him.
I was now recovered from my surprise, and began to
look round me, when I found the cave was but small,
that is to say, it might be about twelve feet over, but
in no manner of shape, either round or square, no
hands having ever been employed in making it but
those of mere nature. I observed also that there was
a place at the far side of it, that went in farther,
but was so low that it required me to creep upon my
hands and knees to go into it, and whither it went I
knew not, so having no candle, I gave it over for that
time, but resolved to come again the next day, pro-
vided with candles and a tinder-box, which I made
of the lock of a musket, with some wildfire in the pan.
Accordingly, the next day, I came provided with
six large candles of my own making, for I made very
good candles now of goats' tallow; and going into
this low place, I was obliged to creep upon all fours,
as I have said, almost ten yards, which, by the way,
I thought was a venture bold enough, considering
that I knew not how far it might go, or what was
beyond it. When I was got through the strait, I
found the roof rose higher up, I believe near twenty
feet; but never was such a glorious sight seen in the
island, I dare say, as it was, to look round the sides
and roof of this vault or cave. The walls reflected
a hundred thousand lights to me from my two candles.
What it was that was in the rock, whether diamonds,
or any other precious stones, or gold, I knew not.
The place I was in was a most delightful cavity or
grotto, of its kind, as could be expected, though per-
fectly dark; the floor was dry and level, and had a
sort of a small loose gravel upon it, so that there was
no nauseous or venomous creatures to be seen; nor
was there any damp or wet on the sides or roof. The
only difficulty in it was the entrance, which, how-
ever, as it was a place of security, and such a retreat
as I wanted, I thought that was a convenience; so
that I was really rejoiced at the discovery, and re-
solved without any delay, to bring some of those
things which I was most anxious about to this place;
particularly I resolved to bring hither my magazine
of powder, and all my spare arms, viz. two fowling-
pieces, and three muskets; so I kept at my castle
only five, which stood ready mounted, like pieces of
cannon, on my outmost fence, and were ready also to
take out upon any expedition.
Upon this occasion of removing my ammunition,
I was obliged to open the barrel of powder which I
took up out of the sea, and which had been wet; and
I found that the water had penetrated about three or
four inches into the powder on every side, which
caking and growing hard, had preserved the inside
like a kernel in a shell, so that I had sixty pounds of
very good powder in the centre of the cask ; and this
was an agreeable discovery to me at that time; so I carried all away thither, never keeping above two or
three pounds of powder with me in my castle, for fear
of a surprise of any kind. I also carried thither all
the lead I had left'for bullets.
I fancied myself now like one of the ancient giants,
which were said to live in caves and holes in rocks,
where none could come at them; for I persuaded my-
self, while I was here, if five hundred savages were
to hunt me, -they would not venture to attack me here.
The old goat, whom I found expiring, died in the
mouth of the cave, the next day after I made this
discovery, and I found it much easier to dig a hole
there, and throw him in, and cover him with earth,
than to drag him out, so I interred him there, to pre-
vent offence to my nose.
I was now in my twenty-third year of residence in
this island, and was so naturalized to the place, and
to the manner of living, that could I have but enjoyed
the certainty that no savages would come to the place
to disturb me, I could have been content to have
capitulated for spending the rest of my time there,
even to the last moment, till I had laid me down and
died, like the old goat in the cave. I had also ar-
rived to some little diversions and amusements, which
made the time pass more pleasantly with me a great
deal than it did before; as, first, I had taught my
Poll, as I noted before, to speak, and he did it so
familiarly, and talked so articulately and plain, that
it was very pleasant to me; and he lived with me no
less than six-and-twenty years. How long he might
live afterwards I know not; though I know they have
a notion, in the Brazils, that they live a hundred
years. Perhaps poor Poll may be alive there still,
calling after " poor Robin Crusoe" to this day. My
dog was a very pleasant and loving companion
to me for no less than sixteen years of my time, and
then died of mere old age. As for my cats they
multiplied, as I have observed, to that degree, that
I was obliged to shoot several of them at first, to
keep them from devouring me, and all I had; but at
length, when the two old ones I brought with me
were gone, and after some time continually driving
»nv "I tiiicc IctvuuiibCB, "ml i! 1 i>.r|(g -J'NM . luiu
whose young, when they had any, I always drowned;
and these were part of my family. Besides these,
I always kept two or three household kids about me.
which I taught to feed out of my hand, and I had
some more parrots, which talked pretty well, and
would all call "Robin Crusoe," but none like my
first; for I did not take the pains with them that!
had done with him. I had also several tame sea
fowls, whose names I knew not, which I had caught
upon the shore, and cut their wings; and the little
stakes which I had planted before my castle wall,
being now grown up to a good thick grove, those
fowls all lived among these low trees, and bred there,
which was very agreeable to me; so that I began to
be very well contented with the life I led, if it might
but have been secured from the dread I had of the
savages.
But it was otherwise directed; and it may not be
amiss for all people who shall meet with my story,
to make this just observation from it; viz. how fre-
quently, in the course of our lives, the evil, which in
itself we seek most to shun, and which, when we are
fallen into, is the most dreadful to us, is oftentimes
the very means or door of our deliverance, by which
alone we can be raised again from the afflictions we
are fallen into. This was particularly remarkable
in the circumstances of the last years of my solitary
residence in this island.
M
It was now the month of December, in toy twenty-
third year, and this being the southern solstice, for
winter I cannot call it, was the particular time of
my harvest, and required my being pretty much
abroad in the fields; when going out pretty early
one morning, even before it was thorough daylight,
I was surprised with seeing a light of some fire upon
the shore, at a distance from me of about two miles,
towards the end of the island where I had observed
some savages had been before, but not on the other
side, no, to my great affliction, it was on my side of
the island.
I was indeed terribly surprised at the sight, and
stopped short within my grove, not daring to go out,
lest I might be surprised: and yet I had no more
peace within, from the apprehensions I had that if
these savages in rambling over the island, should
find my corn standing, or cut, or any of my works
or improvements, they would immediately conclude
that there were people in the place, and would then
never give over till they found me out. In this ex-
extremity I went back directly to my castle, pulled
up the ladder after me, having made all things with-
out look as wild and natural as I could.
Then I prepared myself within, putting myself in
a posture of defence. I loaded all my cannon as I called them, that is to say, my muskets, which were
mounted upon my new fortification, and all my pis-
tols, and resolved to defend myself to the last gasp,
not forgetting seriously to commend myself to the
Divine protection, and earnestly to pray to God to
deliver me out of the hands of the barbarians; and
in this posture I continued about two hours, but
began to be mighty impatient for intelligence abroad.
After sitting a while longer, and musing what I
should do in this case, I could not bear sitting in
ignorance any longer, so setting up my ladder to the
side of the hill, where there was a flat place, as I
observed before, and then pulling the ladder up after
me. I set it ujf> again, and mounted to the top of the
hill, and pulling out my perspective glass, which I
had taken on purpose, I laid me down flat on my
belly on the ground, and began to look for the place.
I presently found there were no less than nine naked
savages sitting round a small fire they had made,
not to warm them, they had no need (of that, the
weather being extremely hot, but, as I supposed, to
dress some of their barbarous diet of human flesh,
which they had brought with them, whether alive or
dead, I could not know.
They had two canoes with them, which they had
hauled up upon the shore, and as it was then tide of
ebb, they seemed to wait the return of the flood to
go away again. It is not easy to imagine what con-
fusion this sight put me into, especially seeing them
come on my side of the island, and so near me too;
but when I observed their coming must be always
with the current of the ebb, I began aftewards to be
more sedate in my mind, being satisfied that I might
g i abroad with safety, all the time of tide of flood, if
they were not on shore before; and having made this
observation I went abroad about my harvest work
with the more composure.
As I expected so it proved, for as soon as the tide
made to the westward, I saw them all take boat, and
row away. I should have observed, they were all
quite naked, and, for an hour and more before they
went off, they went to dancing, and I could easily
discern their grotesque postures and gestures by my
glasses.
As soon as I saw them shipped and gone, I took
two guns upon my shoulders, and two pistols at my
girdle, and my great sword by my side, without a
scabbard, and with all the speed I was able to make,
I went away to the hill where I had discovered the
first appearance of all. As soon as I got thither,
which was not less than two hours, I perceived there
had been three canoes more of savages on that place,
M 2
and looking out farther, I saw they were all at sea
together, making over for the main.
This was a dreadful sight to me; especially when
going down to the shore, I could see with horror the
dismal work they had been about, viz. the blood and
bones, and part of the flesh of human bodies, eaten
and devoured by those wretches with merriment and
sport. I was so filled with indignation at the sight,
that I began now to premeditate the destruction of
the next that I saw there, let them be who or how
many soever.
It seemed evident to me, that the visits which they
thus made to this island were not very frequent; for
it was above fifteen months before any more of them
came on shore there again, that is to say, I never
saw them, or any footsteps or signals of them in all
that time; and I found they did not come in the
rainy season; yet all this while I lived uncomfortably,
by reason of the constant apprehensions I was in of
their coming upon me by surprise.
During all this time, I was in the murdering hu-
mour, and took up most of my hours, which should
have been better employed, in'contriving how to fall
upon them the very next time I should see them,
especially if they should be divided, as they were the
last time, into two parties; nor did I consider at all,
that if I killed one party, suppose ten or a dozen, I
was still the next day, or week, or month, to kill
another, and so another, even ad infinitum, till I should be no less a murderer than they were in being
man-eaters, and perhaps much more so.
I spent my days now in great perplexity and
anxiety of mind, expecting that I should one day or
other fall into the hands of these merciless creatures.
And now I found to my great comfort, how happy it
was that I had provided a tame flock of goats, for I durst not, upon any account, fire my gun, especially
near that side of the island, where they usually came,
lest I should alarm the savages; and if they had fled
from me now, they would perhaps have come back
again, with a great number more, and then I knew
what to expect.
However, I wore out a year and three months
more, before I saw any of the savages; but in the
month of May, as near as I could calculate, and in
my four'-and-twentieth year, I had a very strange
encounter with them, of which in its place.
The perturbation of my mind, during this fifteen
or sixteen months' interval, was very great. In the
day great troubles overwhelmed my mind; in the
night I dreamed often of killing savages, and the
reasons why I might justify the doing of it. But, to
waive all this for a while, it was the middle of May,
on the sixteenth day, I think, that it blew a very
great storm of wind all day, with a great deal of
lightning and thunder, and a very foul night was
it. I know not what was the particular occasion of
it, but as I was reading the Bible, and taken up with
serious thoughts about my present condition, I was
surprised with the noise of a gun, as I thought, fired
at sea.
This was, to be sure, a surprise of quite a different
nature from any I had met with before, for the no-
tions this put into my thoughts were quite of another
kind. I started up in the greatest haste imaginable,
and, in a trice, clapped up my ladder to the middle
place of the rock, and pulled it after me, and mount-
ing it the second time, got to the top of the hill;
that moment a flash of fire bade me listen for a
second gun, which accordingly, in about half a
minute I heard, and, by the sound, knew that it was
from that part of the sea where I was driven out with
the current in my boat.
I immediately considered that this must be some
ship in distress, and that they had some comrade, or
some other ship in company, and fired these guns for
signals of distress, and to obtain help. I had this
presence of mind at that minute, as to think, that
though I could not help them, it may be they might
help me; BO 1 brought together all the dry wood I could get at hand, and making a good sized pile,
I set it on fire upon the hill, the wood was dry, and
blazed freely: and though the wind blew very hard,
yet it burnt fairly out, so that I was certain, if there
was any such thing as a ship, they must needs see it,
and no doubt they did, for as soon as my fire blazed
up, I heard another gun, and after that several others,
all from the same quarter. I plied my fire all night
long, till day broke, and when it was broad day, and
the air cleared up, I saw something at a great dis-
tance at sea, full east of the island, whether a sail,
or a hull, I could not distinguish, no, not with my
glasses, the distance was so great, and the weather
still being hazy also: at least it was so out at sea.
I looked frequently at it all that day, and soon
perceived that it did not move; so I presently con-
cluded that it was a ship at anchor, and being eager,
you may be sure, to be satisfied, I took my gun in
my hand, and ran towards the south-east side of the
island, to the rocks, where I had been formerly car-
ried away with the current, and getting up there, the
weather by this time being perfectly clear, I could
plainly see, to my great sorrow, the wreck of a ship
cast away in the night upon those concealed rocks,
which I found when I was out in my boat, and which
rocks, as they checked the violence of the stream,
and made a kind of counter-stream, or eddy, were
the occasion of my recovering then from the most
desperate, hopeless condition that ever I had been in.
Thus, what is one man's safety is another man's
destruction; for it seems these men, whoever they
were, being out of their knowledge, and the rocks
being wholly under water, had been driven upon them
in the night, the wUid blowing hard at E. and E.N.E.
Had they seen the island, as I must necessarily sup-
pose they did not, they must, as I thought, have en-
deavoured to have saved themselves on shore by the
help of their boat; but the firing of their guns for
help, especially when they saw, as I imagined, my
fire, filled me with many thoughts. First, I imagined
that, upon seeing my light, they might have got into
their boat, and have endeavored to make the shore,
but that the sea going very high, they might have
been cast away. Other times I imagined that they
might have lost their boat before, as might be the
case many ways; as particularly by the breaking of
the sea upon their ship, which many times obliges
men to stave, or take in pieces their boat, and some-
times to throw it overboard with their own hands.
Other times I imagined they had some other ship or
ships in company, who, upon the signals of distress
they had made, had taken them up, and carried
them off. Other times I fancied they were all
gone off to sea in their boat, and being hurried
away by the current that I had been formerly in,
were carried out into the great ocean, where there
was nothing but misery and perishing, and that they
might by this time think of starving, and of being in
a condition to eat one another.
As all these were but conjectures at best, so, in the
condition I was in, I could do no more than look upon
the misery of the poor men, and pity them, which
had still this good effect on my side, that it gave me
more and more cause to give thanks to God, who had
so happily and comfortably provided for me in my
desolate condition; and that of two ships 'companies, who were now cast away upon this part of the world,
not one life should be spared but mine. I learnt here
again to observe, that it is very_ rare the providence
of God casts us into any condition of life so low, or
any misery so great, but we may see something to be
thankful for, and may see others worse than ourselves.
Such certainly was the case of these men, of whom
I could not so much as see room to suppose any of
them were saved; nothing could make it rational, so
much as to wish or expect that they did not all perish
up by another ship in company; and this was but
mere possibility indeed; for I saw not the least sig-
ual or appearance of any such thing.
I cannot explain by words, what a strange longing
or hankering of desires I felt in my soul upon this
sight, breaking out sometimes thus:—" O that there
had been but one or two, nay but one soul saved out
of the ship, to have escaped tome, that I might have
had one companion, one fellow-creature, to have
rken to me, and to have conversed with!" In all
time of my solitary life, I never felt so
earnest, so strong a desire, after the society of
my fellow-creatures, or so deep a regret at the
want of it.
There are some secret moving-springs in the affec-
tions, which, when they are set a-going by some ob-
ject in view, or be it some object, though not in view,
yet rendered present to the mind by the power of ima-
gination, whose motion carries out the soul by its im-
petuosity to such violent eager embracings of the
object, that the absence of it is insupportable.
Such were these earnest wishings, that but one man
had been saved. O that it had been but one! and I believe I repeated the words " O that it had been
but one!" a thousand times; and my desires were so
moved by it, that when I spoke the words, my hands
would clinch together, and my fingers press the
palms of my hands, that if I had had any thing soft
in my hand it would have crushed it; and my teeth
in my head would strike together, and set against
one another so strong, that for some time I could not
part them again.
Let the naturalists explain these things and the
reason and manner of them; all I can say is, to de-
scribe the fact, which was even surprising to me when
I found it, though I knew not from what it should
proceed; it was, doubtless, the effect of ardent wishes,
and strong ideas formed in my mind, realizing the
comfort which the conversation of one of my fellow-
Christians would have been to me.
But it was not to be; either their fate, or mine, or
both, forbade it; for, till the last year of my being in
this island, I never knew whether any were saved
out of the ship or no; and had only the affliction,
some days after, to see the corpse of a drowned boy
washed on shore, at the end of the island, which was
next the shipwreck. He had on a seaman's waist-
coat, a pair of open knee'd linen drawers, and a blue
linen shirt: but nothing to direct me to guess what
nation he was of. He had nothing in hispocket but
two pieces of eight and a tobacco-pipe. The last was
of more value to me, than the first.
It was now calm, and I had a great mind to venture
out in my boat to this wreck, not doubting but I
might find something on board that might be useful
to me; and possibly there might be yet some living
creature on board, whose life I might not only save,
but might, by saving that life, comfort my own to
the last degree; and this thought clung so to my
heart, that I could not be quiet night or day, but I
must venture out in my boat on board this wreck;
and committing the rest to God's providence, I
thought the impression was so strong upon my mind,
that it could not be resisted, that it must come from
some invisible direction, and that I should be wanting
to myself if I did not go.
Under the power of this impression, I hastened
back to my castle, prepared every thing for my voy-
age, took a quantity of bread, a great pot of fresh
water, a compass to steer by, a bottle of rum (for I
had still a great deal of that left), a basket full of
raisins, and thus loading myself with every thing
necessary, I went down to my boat, got the water
out of her, and got her afloat, loaded all my cargo in
her, and'thenwent home againfor more. My second
cargo was a great bag full of rice, the umbrella to
set up over my head for a shade, another pot full of
fresh water, and about two dozen of my small loaves,
or barley cakes, more than before, with a bottle of
goat's milk, and a cheese; all which, with great
labour and sweat, I brought to my boat, and praying
to God to direct my voyage, I put out; and rowing
or paddling the canoe along the shore, I came at last
to the utmost point of the island, on that side, viz.
N. E. And now I was to launch out into the ocean,
and either to venture or not venture. I looked on
the rapid currents which ran constantly on both sides
of the island, at a distance, and which were very ter-
rible to me, from the remembrance of the hazard I had been in before, and my heart began to fail me;
for I foresaw, that if I was driven into either of these
currents, I should be carried a vast way out to sea,
and perhaps out of reach, or sight of the island again;
and that, as my boat was but small, if any little gale
of wind should rise, I should be inevitably lost.
These thoughts so oppressed my mind, that I began
to give over my enterprise, and having hauled my
boat into a little creek on the shore, I stepped out,
and sat me down upon a little spot of rising ground,
very pensive and anxious, between fear and desire
about my voyage; when, as I was musing, I could
perceive that the tide was turned, and the flood came
on, upon which my going was for so many hours im-
practicable. Upon this it presently occurred to me, that I should go up to the highest piece of ground I
could find, and observe, if I could, how the sets of
the tide Nor currents lay when the flood came in, that
I might judge whether, if I was driven one way out,
I might not expect to be driven another way home,
with the same rapidness of the currents. This thought
was no sooner in my head, but I cast my eye upon a
little hill, which sufficiently overlooked the sea both
ways, and from whence I had a clear view of the
currents, or sets of the tide, and which way I was to
guide myself in my return. Here I found that as the
current of the ebb set out close by the south point of
the island, so the current of the flood set in close by
the shore of the north side; and that I had nothing
to do but to keep to the north of the island in my
return, and I should do well enough.
Encouraged with this observation, I resolved the
next morning to set out with the first of the tide;
and reposing myself for that night in the canoe,
under the great watch-coat I mentioned, I launched
out in the morning. I made first a little out to sea,
full north, till I began to feel the benefit of the cur-
rent which set eastward, and which carried me at a
great rate, and yet did not so hurry me as the south-
ern side current had done before, and so as to take
from me all government of the boat; but, having a
strong steerage with my paddle, I went directly for
the wreck, and in less than two hours I came up to it.
11 was a dismal sight to look at: the ship, which
by the building was Spanish, stuck fast, jambed in
between two rocks; an the stern and quarter of her
was beaten to pieces with the sea; and as her fore-
castle, which stuck in the rocks, had run on with
great violence, her main-mast and fore-mast were
brought by the board, that is to say, broken short
off; but her bowsprit was sound, and the head and
bow appeared firm. When I came close to her, a
dog appeared upon her, who, seeing me coming,
yelped and cried; and as soon as I called him, jumped
into the sea to come to me; and I took him into the
boat, and found him almost dead for hunger and
thirst. I gave him a cake of my bread, and he eat
it like a ravenous wolf that had been starving for a
fortnight in the snow. I then gave the poor creature
some fresh water, with which, if I would have let him, he would have burst himself.
After this I went on board. The first sight I met
with was two men drowned in the cook room, or
forecastle of the ship, with their arms fast about one
another. I concluded, as is indeed probable, that
when the ship struck, it being in a storm, the sea
men were not able to bear it, and were stranged with
the constant rushing in of the water, as much as if
they had been under water. Besides the dog, there
was nothing left in the ship that had life, or any
goods that I could see, but what were spoiled by the
water. There were some casks of liquor, whether
wine or brandy I knew not, which lay lower in the
hold, and which, the water being ebbed out, I could
see, but they were too big to meddle with. I saw-
several chests, which I believed belonged to some of
the seamen, and I got two of them into the boat,
without examining what was in them.
Had the stern of the ship been fixed, and the fore
part broken off, I am persuaded I might have made
a good voyage; for, by what I found in these two
chests, I had room to suppose the ship had a great
deal of wealth on board; and, if I may guess by the
course she steered, she must have been bound from
Buenos Ayres, or the Rio de la Plata, in the south
part of America, beyond the Brasils, to the Havannah,
in the gulf of Mexico, and so perhaps to Spain.
I found, besides these chests, a little cask full of
liquor, of about twenty gallons, which I got into my
boat with much difficulty. There were several mus-
kets in a cabin, and a great powder-horn, with about
four pounds of powder in it; as for the muskets, I
had no occasion for them, so I left them, but took
the powder-horn. I took a fire-shovel and tongs,
which I wanted extremely; as also two little brass
kettles, a copper pot to make chocolate, and a grid-
iron; and with this cargo and the dog, I came away,
the tide beginning to make home again; and the same
evening, about an hour within night, I reached the
island again, weary and fatigued to the last degree.
I reposed that night in the boat, and in the morn-
ing I resolved to harbour what I had gotten in my
new cave, not to carry it home to my castle. After
refreshing myself, I got all my cargo on shore, and
began to examine it. The cask of liquor I found to
be a kind of rum, but not such as we had at the
Brasils, and, in a word, not at all good. But when
I came to open the chests, I found several things I wanted: for example, I found in one a fine case of
bottles, of an extraordinary kind, and filled with
cordial waters, fine, and very good: the bottles held
about three pints each, and were tipped with silver.
I found two pots of very good suecades, or sweet-
meats, so fastened on top, that the salt water had
not hurt them; and two more of the same, which the
water had spoiled. I found some very good shirts,
which were very welcome to me, and about a dozen
and a half of white linen handkerchiefs and coloured
neckcloths: the former were also very welcome, being
exceedingly refreshing to wipe my face on in a hot
day. Besides this, when I came to the till in the
chest, I found there three great bags of pieces of
eight, which held about eleven hundred pieces in all;
and in one of them, wrapt up in a paper, six doubloons
of gold, and some small bars of gold; I suppose they
might all weigh near a pound.
The other chest I found had some clothes in it, but
of little value; but by the circumstances it must have
belonged to the gunner's mate, though there was no
powder in it, but about two pounds of glazed powder
in three small flasks, kept I suppose, for charging
casion for it, it was to me as the dirt under my feet,
and I would have given it all for three or four pair of
English shoes and stockings, which were things I
greatly wanted, for I had not had a pair on my feet
for many years. I had, indeed, gotten two pair of
shoes now, which I took off the feet of the two men
whom I found drowned in the wreck; and I found
two pair more in one of the chests, which were very
welcome to me; but they were not like our English
shoes, either for ease or service, being rather what we
call pumps than shoes. 1 found in this seaman's chest
about fifty pieces of eight in royals, but no gold; I
suppose this belonged to a poorer man than the other,
which seemed to belong to some officer.
Well, however, I lugged this money home to my
cave, and laid it up, as I had done that before which
I had brought from my own ship; but it was a great
pity, as I said, that the other part of the ship had not
come to my share, for I am satisfied I might have
loaded my canoe several times with money, which, if
I had ever escaped to England, would have lain herd
safe enough till I might have come and fetched it.
Having now brought all my things on shore, and
secured them, I went back to my boat, and rowed or
paddled her along the shore to her old harbour, where
I laid her up, and made the best of my way to my old
habitation, where I found every thing safe and quiet;
So I began to repose myself, live after my old fashion,
and take care of my family affairs; and for a while
I lived easy enough, only that I was more vigilant
than I used to be, looked out oftener, and did not go
abroad so much: and if any time I did stir with any
freedom, it was always to the east part of the island,
where I was pretty well satisfied the savages never
came, and where I could go without so many precau-
tions, and such a load of arms and ammunition as I
always carried with me if I went the other way.
I lived in this condition near two years more; but
my unlucky head, that was always"to let me know it
was born to make my body miserable, was all these
two years filled with projects and designs, how, if it
were possible, I might get away from this island; for
sometimes I was for making another voyage to the
wreck, though my reason told me, that there was
nothing left there worth the hazard of my voyage;
sometimes for a ramble one way, sometimes another;
and I believe if I had got the boat that I went from
Sallee in, I should have ventured to sea.
I have been in all my circumstances, a memento
to those who are touched with that general plague
of mankind, whence, for ought I know, one half of
their miseries flow; I mean, that of not being satis-
fied with the station wherein God hath placed them.
For, not to look back upon my primitive condition,
and the excellent advice of my father, the opposition
to which was, as I may call it, my original sin, my
subsequent mistakes of the same kind have been the
means of my coming into this miserable condition:
for had that providence, which so happily had seated
me at the Brazils as a planter, blessed me with con-
fined desires, and could I have been contented to have
gone on gradually, I might have been by this time, I
mean in the time of my being in this island, one of
the most considerable planters in the Brazils; nay, I am persuaded that, by the improvements I had made
in that little time I lived there, and the increase I should probably have made if I had staid, I might
have been worth a hundred thousand moidores. And
what business had I to leave a settled fortune, a well-
stocked plantation, improving and increasing, to
turn supercargo to Guinea to fetch Negroes, when
patience and time would have so increased our
stock at home, that we could have bought them at
our own doors from those whose business it was to
fetch them, and though it had cost us something
more, yet the difference of that price was by no means
worth saving at so great a hazard.
But as this is ordinarily the fate of young heads, so
reflection upon the folly of it is generally the exer-
cise of more years, or of the dear-bought experience
of time; and so it is with me now; and yet so deep
had the mistake taken root in my temper, that I could not satisfy myself in my station, but was con-
tinually poring upon the means and possibility of my
escape from this place.
I am oow to be supposed to be retired into my
castle, after my late voyage to the wreck, my frigate
laid up, and secured under water as usual, and my
condition restored to what it was before. I had more
wealth, indeed, than I had before, but was not at all
the richer; for I had no more use for it than the In-
dians of Peru had before the Spaniards came thither.
It was one night, in the rainy season in March, the
four-and-twentieth year of my first setting foot in this
land of solitariness, I had the following dream; viz.
that as I was going out in the morning, as usual
from my castle, I saw upon the shore two canoes and
eleven savages coming to land, and that they brought
with them another savage, whom they were going to
kill, in order to eat him, when on a sudden, the savage
that they were going to kill, made his escape, and
ran for his life: and then I thought in my sleep, that
he came running into my little grove, before my for-
tification, to hide himself; and that I seeing him, and
not perceiving that the others sought him that way,
showed myself to him, and encouraged him; that he
kneeled down to me, seeming to pray to me to assist
him; upon which I showed my ladder, made him go
upon it, and carried him into my cave, and he became
my servant; and that as soon as I had got this man,
I said to myself, "Now I may venture to the main
land, for this fellow will serve me as a pilot, and tell
me what to do, and whither to go for provisions, and
whither not to go for fear of being devoured; what
places to venture into, and what to escape." I awoke
with this thought, and was under such inexpressible
impressions of joy at the prospect of my escape in
my dream, that the disappointment I felt upon coming
to myself, and finding it was no more than a dream,
were really extravagant the other way, and threw me
into a very great dejection of spirits.
Upon this, however, I made this conclusion, that
my only way to go about an attempt for an escape,
was, to try to get a savage in my possession; and, if
possible, it should be one of their prisoners, whom
they had condemned to be eaten, and should bring
hither to kill; but these thoughts still were attended
with this difficulty, that it was impossible to effect
this without attacking a whole caravan of them, and
killing them all; and this was not only a very des-
perate attempt, and might miscarry, but? on the
other hand, I had greatly scrupled the lawfulness of
it to me, and my heart trembled at the thoughts of
shedding blood, though it was for my deliverance.
However, at last, after many secret disputes with
myself, and after great perplexities about it, the eager
desire of deliverance at length mastered all the rest,
and I resolved, if possible, to get one of these savages
into my hands, cost what it would. My next thing
then was to contrive how to do it; and this indeed
was very difficult to resolve on; but as I could pitch
upon no probable means for it, so I resolved to put
myself upon the watch, to see them when they came
on shore, and leave the rest to the event, taking such
measures as the opportunity should present.
With these resolutions in my thoughts, I set my-
self upon the scout as often as possible, and indeed
so often, till I was heartily tired of it; for I waited
above a year and a half, and for a great part of that
time went out to the west end, and to the south-west
corner of the island, almost every day, to see for the
canoes, but none appeared. This was very discou-
raging, and began to trouble me much; though 1 can-
not say that it did in this case, as it had done some
time before that, viz. wear off the edge of my desire
to the thing; but the longer it seemed to be delayed,
the more eager I was for it. In a word I was not at
first more careful to shun the sight of these savages,
and avoid being seen by them, than I was now eager
to be upon them.
Besides, I fancied myself able to manage one, nay,
two or three savages, if I had them, so as to make
them entirely slaves to me, to do what I should direct
them, and to prevent their being able at any time to
do me any hurt. It was a great while that I pleased
N
myself with this affair; but nothing still presented:
all my fancies and schemes came to nothing, for no
savages came near me for a great while.
About a year and a half after I had entertained
these notions, and by long musing had, as it were,
resolved to put them into execution, I was surprised
one morning early with seeing no less than five ca-
noes, all on shore together, on my side of the island,
and the people who belonged to them all landed. The
number of them broke all my measures, for seeing so
many, and knowing that they always came four or
sometimes more, in a boat, I could not tell what to
think of it, or how to take my measures to attack
twenty or thirty men single handed, so I lay still in
my castle, perplexed and discomforted. However, I
put myself into all the same postures for an attack
that I had formerly provided, and was just ready for
action, if any thing had presented. Having waited
a good while, listening to hear if they made any noise,
at length, being very impatient, I set my guns at the
foot of my ladder, and clambered up to the top of the
hill by my two stages, as usual; standing so, how-
ever, that my head did not appear above the hill; so
that they could not perceive me by any means. I
here observed, by the help of my perspective glass,
that they were no less than thirty in number, that
they had a fire kindled, and that they had meat dres-
sed; how they cooked it, that I knew not, or what it
was: but they were all dancing in I know not how
many barbarous gestures and figures, round the fire.
While I was thus looking on them, I perceived, by
my perspective glass, two miserable wretches drag-
ged from the boats, where, it seems, they were laid
by, and were now brought out for the slaughter. I
perceived one of them immediately fall, being knocked
down, I suppose, with a club, or wooden sword, for
that was their way; and two or three others were at
work, cutting him open for their cookery, while the
other victim was left standing by himself, till they
should be ready for him. In that very moment this
poor wretch seeing himself a little at liberty, nature
inspired him with hopes of life, and he started away
from them, and ran with incredible swiftness along
the sands, directly towards me, I mean towards that
part of the coast where my habitation was.
I was dreadfully frighted (that I must acknowledge,)
when I perceived him to run my way, and especially
when, as I thought, I saw him pursued by the whole
body; and I expected that part of my dream was
coming to pass, and that he would take shelter in my
grove; but I could not depend, by any means, upon
my dream for the rest of it, viz. that the savages
would not pursue htm thither, and find him there
However, I kept my station, and my spirits began to
recover when I found that there were not above three
men that followed him; and still more was I en-
couraged, when I found that he outstripped them ex-
ceedingly in running, and gained ground of them, so
that if he could but hold out for half an hour, I saw
he would fairly get away from them all.
There was between them and my castle the creek,
which I mentioned often at the first part of my story,
when I landed my cargoes out of the ship: and this
I knew he must necessarily swim over, or the poor
wretch would be taken there; but when the savage
who was escaping, came thither, he made nothing of
it, though the tide was then up, but plunging in, he
swam through it in about thirty strokes, or there-
abouts, landed, and ran on with exceeding strength
and swiftness. When the three pursuers came to the
creek, I found that two of them could swim, but the
third could not, and that he, standing on the other
side, looked at the others, but went no farther, and
soon after went softly back again, which, as it hap-
pened, was very well for him.
I observed that the two who swam were yet twice
as long swimming over the creek, than the fellow was
that fled from them. It came now very warmly upon
N 2
my thoughts, and indeed irresistibly, that now was
my time to get me a servant, and, perhaps, a com-
panion or assistant, and that I was called plainly, by
Providence, to save this poor creature's life. I im-
mediately got down the ladders, fetched my two
guns, for they were both at the foot of the ladders,
and getting up again with the same haste to the top
of the hill, I crossed towards the sea; and, having a
very short cut, and all down hill, clapped myself in
the way between the pursuers and the pursued, hal-
looing aloud to him that fled, who, looking back, was
at first as much frighted at me, as at them; but I
beckoned with my hand to him to come back, and,
in the mean time, I slowly advanced towards the two
that followed: then rushing at once upon the fore-
most, I knocked him down with the stock of my
piece; I was loath to fire, because I would not have
the rest to hear, though at that distance it would
not have been easily heard, and being out of sight of
the smoke too, they would not have known what
to make of it. Having knocked this fellow down,
the other who followed him, stopped, as if he had
been frightened, and I advanced apace towards him;
but as I came nearer, I perceived presently he had a
bow and arrow, and was fitting it to shoot at me, so
I was then necessitated to shoot at him first, which
I did, and killed him at the first shot. The poor
savage who fled, but had stopped, though he saw
both his enemies fallen, and killed (as he thought),
yet was so frighted with the noise and fire of my
piece, that he stood stock-still, and neither came
forward nor went backward, though he seemed rather
inclined to fly still, than to come on. I hallooed again
to him, and made signs to him to come forward,
which he easily understood, and came a little way,
then stopped again, and then a little farther, arid
stopped again; and then he stood trembling, as if
he had been taken prisoner, and had just been to be
killed, as his two enemies were. I beckoned to him
again to come to me, and gave him all the signs of
encouragement that I could think of; and he came nearer and nearer, kneeling down every ten or twelve
steps, in token of acknowledgment for saving his life.
I smiled at him, and looked pleasantly, and beckoned
to him to come still nearer. At length he came close
to me, and then he kneeled down again, kissed the
ground, and, taking my foot, set it upon his head;
this, it seems, was in token of swearing to be my
slave for ever. I took him up, and made much of
him, and encouraged him all I could. But, I per-
ceived the savage whom I knocked down was not
killed, but stunned with the blow, and began to come
to himself. So I pointed to him, showing him the
savage, that he was not dead; upon this he spoke
some words to me, and though I.could not understand
them, yet I thought they were pleasant to hear, for
they were the first sound of a man's voice that I had
heard, my own excepted, for above five-and-twenty
years. But there was no time for such reflections
now. The savage who was knocked down, recovered
himself so far as to sit up upon the ground, and I
perceived that my savage began to be afraid; but
when I saw that, I presented my other piece at the
man, as if I would shoot him; upon this my savage,
for so I call him now, made a motion to me to lend
him my sword, which hung naked in a belt by my
side; so I did. He no sooner had it than he runs to
his enemy, and, at one blow, cut off his head as cle-
verly, no executioner in Germany could have done it
sooner or better; which I thought very strange for
one who, I had reason to believe, never saw a sword
in his life before, except their own wooden swords.
However, it seems, as I learned afterwards, they
make their wooden swords so sharp, so heavy, and
the wood is so hard, that they will cut off heads and
arms with them, and that at one blow too. When
he had done this, he comes laughing to me in sign
of triumph, and brought me the sword again, and
laid it down, with the head of the savage he had
killed, just before me.
He was astonished how I had killed the other
Indian, so far off; and, going to him, he stood like
one amazed, looking at him, turning him first on one
side, then on the other; looked at the wound the
bullet had made, which was in the breast, where it
had made a hole, and no great quantity of blood had
followed, but he had bled inwardly, for he was quite
dead. Then he took up his bow and arrows, and
came back, and I beckoned for us to go away, making
signs that more might come after them. Upon this,
he signed to me, that he should bury them with sand,
that they might not be seen by the rest, if they fol-
lowed; so I made signs for him to do so; he fell to
work, and had them both buried in the sand in about
a quarter of an hour. I then called him away, and
took him not to my castle, but my cave, on the far-
ther part of the island; so I did not let my dream
come to pass in that respect, viz. that he came into
my grove for shelter. Here I gave him bread, and a
bunch of raisins to eat, and a draught of water, which
he was in great distress for, by his running; and
having refreshed him, I made signs for him to go to
sleep, pointing to a place where I had laid a great
parcel of rice straw, and a blanket upon it, which I used to sleep upon myself sometimes; so the poor
creature lay down, and went to sleep.
He was a comely handsome fellow, perfectly well
made, tall, and well shaped, and, as I reckon, about
twenty-six years of age. He had a very good coun-
tenance, not a fierce and surly aspect, but seemed to
to have something very manly in his face, and yet he
had all the sweetness and softness of an European in
his countenance too, especially when he smiled. His
hair was long and black, not curled like wool, his
forehead very high and large, and a great vivacity
and sparkling sharpness in his eyes. The colour of
his skin was not quite black, but very tawny, and yet
not of an ugly, yellow, nauseous tawny, as the Bra-
zilians, and Virginians, and other natives of America
are, but of a bright kind of a dun olive color, that
had in it something very agreeable, though not very
easy to describe. His face was round and plump,
his nose small, not flat like the Negroes, a very good
mouth, thin lips, and his teeth fine, well set, and
white as ivory. After he had slumbered about half
an hour, he waked, and came out of the cave to me,
for I had been milking the goats in the enclosure just
by. When he espied me, he came running, and laid
himself on the ground again, with all the possible
signs of an humble, thankful disposition, making
many antic gestures to show it. At last he lays his
head flat upon the ground, close to my foot, and sets
my other foot upon his head, as he had done before,
and after this, made all the signs to me of subjection,
servitude. and submission imaginable, to let me know
how much he would serve me as long as he lived. I
understood him in many things, and let him know I was well pleased with nun. In a little time I began
to speak to him, and teach him to speak to me; and
first, made him know his name should be Friday,
which was the day I saved his life. I likewise
taught him to say," Master," and then let him know
that was to be my name. I also taught him to say,
"Yes," and " No, and to know the meaning of them.
I gave him some milk in an earthen pot, and some
bread, and let him see me drink some before him,
and sop my bread in it, which he quickly imitated,
and made signs that it was very good for him.
I kept there with him all that night; but assoon
as it was day, I took him away with me. As we
went by the place where we had buried the two men,
he pointed exactly to the spot, and showed me the
marks he had made to find them again, making signs
to me that we should dig them up and eat them: at
this I appeared very angry, expressed my abhorrence
of it, made as if I would vomit at the thoughts of it,
and beckoned with my hand to him to come away,
which he immediately did, with great submission.
I then led him to the top of the hill, to see if his ene-
mies were gone, and pulling out my glass, I looked,
and saw plainly the place where they had been, but
no appearance of them, or their canoes; so they were
quite gone.
I then took my man Friday with me, giving him
the sword in his hand, with the bow and arrows at
his back, which I found he could use very dextrously,
making him carry one gun for me, and I two for
myself, and away we marched to the place where
these creatures had been. When I came there, my
very blood ran chill in my veins, and my heart sunk
within me at the horror of the spectacle. Indeed it
was a dreadful sight; the place was covered with
human bones, the ground dyed with the blood, great
pieces of flesh left here and there, half eaten, man-
gled, and scorched, and, in short, all the tokens of
the triumphant feast they had been making there,
after a victory over their enemies. I saw three
skulls, five hands, and the bones of three or four legs
and feet, and abundance of other parts of the bodies;
and Friday, by his signs, made me understand, that
they brought over four prisoners to feast upon, that
three of them were eaten, and that he, pointing to
himself, was the fourth; that there had been a great
battle between them and their next king, whose sub-
jects it seems he had been one of, and that they had
taken a great number of prisoners, all of which were
carried to several places by those that had taken
them in the fight, in order to feast upon them, as was
done here by these wretches.
1 caused "Friday to gather all the bones and flesh
that remained, and lay them together in a heap, and
burn them to ashes. I found that he had still an
hankering stomach after the flesh, and was still a
cannibal in his nature, butl displayed such abhorrence
at the very thoughts of it, that he durst not discover
it; for I let him know that I would kill him if he
offered it.
When we had done this, we came back to our
castle, where I gave Friday first of all a pair of linen
drawers, which I had out of the poor gunner's chest
I found in the wreck, and which, with a little altera-
tion, fitted him very well; then I made him a jerkin
of goat's skin. as well as I was able; and I gave him
a cap, which I had made of a hare's skin ; and thus he
was dressed, for the present, tolerably well; and
mighty well was he pleased to see himself almost as
well clothed as his master. He went awkwardly in
these things at first; wearing the drawers was very
awkward to him, and the sleeves of the jerkin galled
bis shoulders, and the inside of his arms; but he
soon got used to them.
The next day after I came home to my hut with
him, I began to consider where I should lodge him;
so I made a little tent for him in the vacant place
between the two fortifications, in the inside of the
last, and in the outside of the first; and as there was
an en trance there into my cave, I madeaformal framed
door-case, and a door to it of boards, and set it up in
the passage, a little within the entrance, and causing
the door to open in the inside, I barred it up in the
night, taking in my ladders too; so that Friday
could no way come at me in the inside of my
innermost wall, without making so much noise in
getting over, that it must needs awaken me, for my
first wall had now a complete roof over it of long
poles, covering all my tent, and leaning up to the
side of the hill, which was again laid across with
small sticks instead of laths, and then thatched over
a great thickness with the rice straw, which was
strong like reeds; and at the hole or place which
was left to go in or out by the ladder, I had placed
a kind oftrap-door, which, if it had been attempted
on the outside, would not have opened at all, but
would have fallen down, and made a great noise. 1
took care to take all the weapons into my side every
night.
But I needed none of these precautions, for never
was a more faithful, loving, sincere servant than
Friday was to me; without passions, sullenness, or
designs; his very affections were tied to me, like
those of a child to its father, and, I dare say, he
would have sacrificed his life for the saving of my
own, upon any occasion whatever.
This frequently gave me occasion to observe, and
that with wonder, that however it had pleased God
in his providence, and in the government of the works
of his hands, to take from so great a part of the world
of his creatures the best uses to which their facul-
ties, and the powers of their souls are adapted, yet
that he has bestowed upon them the same powers,
the same reason, the same affections, the same senti-
ments of kindness and obligation, the same passions
and resentments of wrongs, the same sense of grati-
tude, sincerity, fidelity, and all the capacities of doing
good, and receiving good, that he has given to us;
and that when he pleases to offer them occasions of
exerting these, they are as ready, nay, more ready,
to apply them to the right uses for which they were
bestowed, than we are. And this made me very
melancholy sometimes, in reflecting, as the several
occasions presented, how mean a use we make of all
these, even though we have these powers enlightened
by the great lamp of instruction, the Spirit of God,
and by the knowledge of his Word, added to our
understanding; and why it has pleased God to hide
the like saving knowledge from so many millions of
souls, who, if I might judge by this poor savage,
would make a much better use of it than we did.
From hence I sometimes was led too far to invade
the sovereignty of Providence, and, as it were, arraign
the justice of so arbitrary a disposition of things, that
should hide that light from some, and reveal it to
others, and yet expect a like duty from both. But I checked my thoughts with this conclusion; first,
that we did not know by what light and law these
should be condemned; but that God was necessarily,
and by the nature of his being, infinitely holy and
just; so it could not be, but that if these creatures
were all sentenced to absence from himself, it was on
account of sinning against that light, which, as the
Scripture says, was a law to themselves, and by such
rules as their consciences would acknowledge to be
just, though the foundation was not discovered to us:
and secondly, that still, as we are all clay in the
hand of the potter, no vessel could say to him, "Why
has thou formed me thus?"
But to return to my new companion: I was greatly
delighted with him, and made it my business to teach
him every thing that was proper and useful, and
especially to make him speak, and understand me
when I spoke: and he was a very apt scholar, and
he was so merry, so diligent, and so pleased when he
could understand me, or make me understand him,
that it was very pleasant for me to talk to him.
And now my life began to be very easy and happy.
After I had been two or three days returned to my
castle, I thought, that in order to bring Friday off
from his horrid way of feeding, and from the relish
of a cannibal's stomach, I ought to let him taste
other flesh. So I took him out with me one morn-
ing to the woods, and I saw a she-goat lying down
in the shade, and two young kids close by Tier. I
catched hold of Friday; "Hold," said I; "stand
still;" and made signs to him not to stir: immedi-
ately I presented my piece, shot, and killed one of
the kids. The poor creature, who had, at a distance
indeed, seen me kill the savage, his enemy, but did
not know, nor could imagine, how it was done, was
sensibly surprised, trembled, and shook, and looked
so amazed, that I thought he would have sunk down.
He did not see the kid I had shot at, nor perceive I
had killed it, but ripped up his waistcoat to feel if he
was not wounded; and, as I found, thought I was
resolved to kill him; for he came and kneeled down
to me, and embracing my knees, said a great many
things I did not understand, but I could see that his
meaning was to pray to me not to kill him.
I soon found a way to convince him that I would
do him no harm; and, taking him up by the hand,
laughed at him, and pointing to the kid I had killed,
beckoned to him to run and fetch it, which he did;
and while he was looking to see how the creature
was killed, I loaded my gun again, and by and bye I saw a great fowl, like a hawk, sit upon a tree within
shot; so, to let Friday understand a little what I would do, I called him to me again, pointing at the
fowl, which was a parrot, though I thought it had
been a hawk; I say, pointing to the parrot and to
my gun, and to the ground under the parrot, to let
him see I would make him fall. I made him under-
stand that I would shoot and kill that bird: accord-
ingly I fired, and bade him look, and immediately he
saw the parrot fall. He stood like one frightened
again, notwithstanding all I had said to him; and I found he was the more amazed, because he did not
see me put any thing into the gun; but thought
there must be some wonderful fund of death and
destruction in that thing, able to kill man, beast,
bird, or any other thing, near or far off; and I be-
lieve, if I would have let him, he would have wor-
shipped me and my gun: As for the gun itself, he
would not so much as touch it for several days after,
but would speak to it, and talk to it, as if it had an-
swered him, which, as I afterwards learned of him,
was to desire it not to kill him.
Well, after his astonishment was a little over at
this, I pointed io him to run and fetch the bird I had
shot, which he did, but staid some time, for the par-
rot, not being quite dead, was fluttered a good way
off from the place where she fell. However, he found
her, took her up, and brought her to me; and, as I
had perceived his ignorance about the gun before, I
took this advantage to charge the gun again, and not
let him see me do it, that I might be ready for any
other mark, but nothing offered at that time. So I
brought home the kid, and the same evening took
the skin off, and cut it up as well as I could; and
having a pot for that purpose, I boiled or stewed
some of the flesh, and made some very good broth:
after I had begun to eat some, I gave some to my
man, who seemed very glad of it, and liked it very
well; but that which was strangest to him was to
see me eat salt with it. He made a sign to me that
the salt was not good to eat, and putting a little into
his own mouth, he seemed to nauseate it, and would
spit and sputter at it, washing his mouth with fresh
water after it: on the other hand, I took some meat
in my mouth without salt, and I pretended to spit
and sputter for want of salt, as fast as he had done
at it, but it would not do.
Having thus fed him with boiled meat and broth,
I was resolved to feast him the next day with roast-
ing a piece of the kid; this I did by hanging it before
the fire in a string, as I had seen many people do in
England, setting two poles up, one on each side of
the fire, and one across the top, and tying the string
to the cross stick, letting the meat turn continually.
This Friday admired much; but when he came to
taste the flesh, he took so many ways to tell me how
well he liked it, that I could not but understand
him; and at last he told me he would never eat man's
flesh any more, which I was very glad to hear.
The next day I set him to work to beating some
corn out, and sifting it in the manner I used to do;
and he soon understood how to do it as well as I,
especially after he had seen what the meaning of it
was, and that it was to make bread of; for after that
I let him see me make my bread, and bake it too;
and in a little time Friday was able to do all the
work for me as well as I could do it myself.
to feed instead of one, I must provide more ground
for my harvest, and plant a larger quantity of corn
than I used to do, so I marked out a larger piece of
land, and began the fence in the same manner as
before, in which Friday not only worked very hard,
but very cheerfully; and 1 told him that it was for
corn to make more bread, because he was now with
me, and that I might have enough for him and my-
self too. He appeared very sensible of that part, and
let me know that he would work the harder for me
me if I would tell him what to do.
This was the pleasantest year of all the life I led
in this place. Friday began to talk pretty well, and
Hnderstand the names of almost every thing I had
occasion to call for, and of every place I had occasion
to send him to, and talk a great deal to me; so that,
in short, I began to have some use for my tongue
again. Besides the pleasure of talking to him, I had
a singular satisfaction in the fellow himself: his sim-
ple, unfeigned honesty appeared to be more and more
every day, and I began really to love the creature;
and I believe he loved me as much as possible.
I had a mind once to try if he had any hankering
inclination to his own country; and having learned
him English so well, that he could answer me almost
any questions, I asked him whether the nation that
he belonged to never conquered in battle. At which
he smiled, and said, "Yes, yes; we always fight the
better:" that is, he meant, always get the better in
fight: and so we began the following discourse:—
"You always fight the better!" said I; "how came
you to be taken prisoner then, Friday?"
Friday.—My nation beat much for all that.
Master.—How beat? If your nation beat them,
how came you to be taken?
Friday.—They more than my nation in the place
where me was: they take one, two, three, and me.
My nation over-beat them in yonder place, where me
no was; there my nation take one, two, great
thousand.
Matter.—But why did not your side recover you
from the hands of your enemies then?
Friday.—They run one, two, three, and me, and
make go in the canoe: my nation have no canoe
that time.
Master.—Well, Friday, and what does your nation
do with the men they take? Do they carry them
away and eat them, as these did?
Friday.—Yes, my nation eat mans too, eat all up.
Master.—Where do they carry them?
Friday.—Go to other place, where they think.
Master.—Do they come hither?
Friday.—Yes, yes, they come hither: come other
else place.
Master.—Have you been here with them?
Friday.—Yes, I been here. (Points to the N. W.
side of the island, which it seems was their side.)
By this I understood that my man Friday had
formerly been among the savages, who had used to
come on shore on the farther parts of the island, on
the said man-eating occasions that he had been now
brought for: and some time after, when I took cou-
rage to carry him to that side, he presently knew the
placer and told me he was there once when they eat
up twenty men, two women, and one child.
After I had had this discourse with him, I asked
him how far it was from our island to the shore:
whether the canoes were not often lost? He told
me that there was no danger, no canoes ever lost;
but that, after a little way out to sea, there was a
a current, and a wind always one way in the morn-
ing, the other in the afternoon.
This I thought to be no more than the sets of
the tide, as going out or coming in; but I afterwards
understood it was occasioned by the great draught
and reflux of the mighty river Oronoque; in the
mouth of which river, as I thought afterwards, our
island lay; and that this land, which 1 perceived
to the W. and N. \V., was the great island Tri-
nidad, on the north point of the mouth of the
river. 1 asked Friday a thousand questions about
the country, the inhabitants, the sea, the coast, and
what nations were near: he told me all he knew,
with the greatest openness imaginable. I asked
him the names of the several nations of his sort of
people, but could get no other name than Caribs;
from whence I easily understood that these were the
Caribbees, which our maps place on that part of
America which reaches from the mouth of the river
Oroonoque to Guiana, and onwards to St. Martha.
He told me that up a great way beyond the moon,
which must be west from their country, there dwelt
white, bearded men, like me, and pointed to my great
whiskers, which 1 mentioned before, and that they
had killed "much mans," that was his word. By
all which I understood he meant the Spaniards,
whose cruelties in America had been spread over
whole countries, and were remembered by all the
nations from father to son.
I inquired if he could tell me how I might come
from this island, and get among those white men?
He told me yes, yes, I might go in " two canoe." 1
could not understand what he meant by" two canoe,"
till at last, with difficulty, 1 found he meant that it
must be a large boat, as big at> two canoes.
This part of Friday's discourse began to relish with
me very well; and from this time 1 entertained some
hopes that, one time or other, I might find an oppor-
tunity to make my escape from this place, and that
this poor savage might be a means to help me to do it.
1 was now wanting to lay a foundation of religious
knowledge in Friday's mind; particularly I asked
him one time who made him. The poor creature did
not understand me, but thought 1 had asked him
who was his father. But 1 took it another way, and
asked him who made the sea, the ground he walked
on, and the hills and woods. He told me it was one
old Benamuckee, that lived beyond all. He could
describe nothing of this great person, but that he was
very old; much older, he said, than the sea or the land, than the moon or the stars. I asked him then.
if this person had made all things, why did not all
things worship him. He looked very grave, and
with a perfect look of innocence said, "All things
said O to him." I asked him if the people who die
in his country went away any where. He said, yes,
they all went to Benamuckee. Then I asked him
whether those they eat up went thither too: he said,
"Yes."
From these things I began to instruct him in the
knowledge of the true God. I told him, that the
great Maker of all things lived up there, pointing up
towards heaven: that he governs the world by the
same power and providence by which he had made
it: that he was omnipotent, could do every thing for
us, give every thing to us, take every thing from us:
and I 1ms. by degrees, I opened his eyes. He listened
with great attention, and received with pleasure the
notion of Jesus Christ being sent to redeem us, and of
the manner of making our prayers to God, and his
being" able to hear us, even into heaven. He told me
one day, that if our God could hear us up beyond the
sun, he must needs be a greater God than their Be-
namuckee, who lived but a little way off', and yet
could not hear till they went up to the great moun-
tains where he dwelt, to speak to him. I asked him
if ever he went thither to speak to him: he said, no;
they never went that were young men; none went
thither but the old men, whom he called their
Oowokakee, that is, as I made him explain it to me,
their religious, or clergy; and that they went to say
O (so he called saying prayers,) and then came back,
and told them what Bemimuckee said. By this I
observed that there is priestcraft even amongst the
most blinded ignorant Pagans in the world.
I endeavoured to clear up this fraud to my man
Friday, and told him, that the pretence of their old
men going up to the mountains to say O! to their
god Benamuckee, was a cheat; and their bringing
word from thence what he said, was much more, so;
that if they met with any answer, or spoke with any
one there, it must be an evil spirit: and then I en-
tered into a long discourse with him about the devil,
the original of him, his rebellion against God, his enmity to man, the reason of it, his setting himself
up in the dark parts of the world to be worshipped
instead of God, and as God, and the many stratagems
he made use of to delude mankind to their ruin: how
he had a secret access to our passions, and to our
affections, to adapt his snares so to our inclinations,
as to cause us even to be our own tempters, and to
run upon our own destruction, by our own choice.
I found it was not so easy to imprint right notions
in his mind about the devil, as it was about the being
of a God. Nature assisted all my arguments to
evidence to him even the necessity of a great First
Cause, and over-ruling, governing power, a secret,
directing Providence, and of the equity and justice
of paying homage to him that made us; but there
appeared nothing of all this in the notion of an evil
spirit, of his original, his being, his nature, and, above all, of his inclination to do evil, and to draw us in to
do so too. And the poor creature puzzled me once
in such a manner, by a question merely natural and
innocent, that I scarce knew what to say to him. I
had been talking a great deal to him of the power of
God, his omnipotence, his dreadful aversion to sin,
his being a consuming fire to the workers of iniquity;
how, as he had made us all, he could destroy us, and
all the world, in a moment; and he listened with
great seriousness to me all the while. After this, I
had been telling him how the devil was God's enemy
in the hearts of men, and used all his malice and skill
to defeat the good designs of Providence, and to mm
the kingdom of Christ in the world, and the like:—
"Well," says Friday, " but you say God is so strong,
so great, is he not much strong, much might, as the
devil ?—" Yes, yes," said I, " Friday, God is stronger
than the devil, God is above the devil, and therefore
we pray to God to tread him under our feet, and
enable us to resist his temptations, and quench his
fiery darts."—" But, says he again, "if God much
strong, much might, as the devil, why God not kill
the devil, so make him no more wicked?"
I was strangely surprised at his question, and after
all, though I was now an old man, yet I was but a
young doctor, and ill enough qualified for a casuist,
or a solver of difficulties. However, after a pause, I
said, " God will at last punish him severely; he is
reserved for the judgment, and is to be cast into the
bottomless pit, to dwell with everlasting fire." This
did not satisfy Friday; but he repeats my words,
"Reserve at last? me no understand. But why not
kill the devil not kill great ago?"—" You may as well
ask me," said 1, "why God does not kill you and
me, when we do wicked things here that offend him;
we are preserved to repent and be pardoned." He
muses a while at this;—" Well, well," says he, " that
well; so you, I, devil, all wicked, all preserve, re-
pent, God pardon all." Here I was run down again
by him to the last degree, and it was a testimony to
me, how the mere notions of nature, though they will
guide reasonable creatures to the knowledge of a
God, and of a worship or homage due to the supreme
being of God, as the consequence of our nature; yet
nothing but divine revelation can form the knowledge
of Jesus Christ, and of a redemption purchased for
us, of a Mediator of a new covenant, and of an Inter-
cessor at the footstool of God's throne; and that,
therefore, the Gospel of our Lord and Saviour Jesus
Christ, I mean the Word of God, and the Spirit of
God, promised for the guide and sanctifier of his
people, are the absolutely necessary instructors of
o 2
the souls of men in the saving knowledge of God, and
the means of salvation.
I therefore diverted the present discourse between
me and my man, rising up hastily, as upon some
sudden occasion of going out, then sending him for
something a great way off, I seriously prayed to God
that he would enable me to instruct this poor savage,
assisting by his Spirit the heart of the poor ignorant
creature to receive the light of the knowledge of God
in Christ, reconciling him to himself, and would
guide me to speak so to him from the Word of God,
as his conscience might be convinced, his eyes opened,
and his soul saved. When he came again to me, I
entered into a long discourse with him upon the sub-
ject of the redemption of man, by the Saviour of the
world, and of the doctrine of the Gospel preached
from heaven, viz. of repentance towards God, and
faith in our blessed Lord Jesus. I then explained to
him, as well as I could, why our blessed Redeemer
took not on him the nature of angels, but the seed
of Abraham, and how, for that reason, the fallen an-
gels had no share in the redemption, that he came only
to the lost sheep of the house of Israel, and the like.
I had, God-knows, more sincerity than knowledge,
in all the methods I took for this poor creature's in-
struction, andmustaeknowledge what Ibelieveall that
act upon the same principle will find, that, in laying
things open to him, I really informed and instructed
myself in many things that I either did not know or
had not fully considered before, but which occurred
naturally to my mind, upon my searching into them
for the information of this poor savage: and I had
more affection in my inquiry after things upon this
occasion than ever I felt before; so that whether
this poor wild wretch was the better for me or no, I
had great reason to be thankful that ever he came to
me; my grief sat lighter upon me, my habitation
grew comfortable to me beyond measure, and when
I reflected, that, in this solitary life which I had been
confined to, I had not only been moved myself to
look up to heaven, and to seek to the Hand that
brought me thither, but was now to be made an in-
strument, under Providence, to save the life, and for
aught I knew, the soul, of a poor savage, and bring
him to the true knowledge of religion, and of the
Christian doctrine, that he might know Christ Jesus,
"to whom is life eternal."
In this thankful frame I continued all the remainder
of^my time, and the conversation which employed
the hours between Friday and me was such as made
the three years, which we lived there together per-
fectly and completely happy, if any such thing as
complete happiness can be found in a sublunary
state. The savage was now a good Christian, a much
better than I, though I have reason to hope, and
bless God for it, that we were equally penitent, and
comforted restored penitents. We had here the
Word of God to read, and no farther off from his
Spirit to instruct than if we had been in England.
I always applied myself to reading the Scriptures,
and to let him know, as well as I could, the meaning
of what I read.
After Friday and I became more intimately ac-
quainted, and that he could understand almost all I said to him, and speak fluently, though in broken
English, to me, I acquainted him with my history.
I let him into the mystery of gunpowder and bullets,
and taught him how to shoot. I gave him a knife,
which he was wonderfully delighted with, and I made him a belt with a frog hanging to it, such as
in England we wear hangers in, and in the frog, in-
stead of a hanger, I gave him a hatchet.
I described to him the countries of Europe, and
particularly England, which I came from; how we
lived, how we worshipped God, how we behaved to
one another, and how we traded in ships to all parts
of the world. I gave him an account of the wreck
which I had been on board of, and showed him, as
near as I could, the place where she lay; but she
had been all gone long ago.
I showed him the ruins of our boat, which we lost
when I escaped, and which was now fallen almost to
pieces. Upon seeing this boat, Friday stood musing
some time, and said nothing. I asked him what he
studied upon, at last, says he, "Me see such boat
like come to place at my nation."
I did not understand him a good while; but, at
last, when I had examined farther into it, I under-
stood by him, that a boat, such as that had been,
came on shore upon the country where he lived;
that is, as he explained it, was driven thither by
stress of weather. I presently imagined, that some
European ship must have been cast away upon their
coast, and the boat might get loose, and drive ashore;
but was so dull that I never once thought of men
making their escape from a wreck thither, much less
whence they might come, so I only inquired after a
description of the boat.
Friday described the boat to me well enough: but
brought me better to understand him when he added,
with some warmth, "We save the white mans from
drown." Then I presently asked him if there were
any white mans, as he called them, in the l>oat:
"Yes," he said, "the boat full of white mans." I
asked him, "How many?" He told me upon his
fingers seventeen. I asked him "What became of
them?" He told me, "They live, they dwell at
my nation."
This put new thoughts into my head again, for I
Presently imagined, that these might be the men be-
mging to the ship that was cast away in sight of
my island, and who, after the ship was struck on the
rock, and they saw her inevitably lost, had saved
themselves in their boat, and were landed upon that
wild shore among the savages.
Upon this, I inquired of him more critically, what
was become of them; he assured me they still lived
there, that they had been there about four years,
that the savages let them alone, and gave them vic-
tuals to live. I asked him, how it came to pass that
they did not kill them, and eat them. He said,
"No, they make brother with them," that is, as I understood him, a truce; and then he added, "They
no eat mans, but when make the war fight;" that is
to say, they never eat any men, but such as come to
fight with them, and are taken in battle.
i t was after this, some considerable time, that being
on the top of the hill, at the east side of the island,
from whence I had, in a clear day, discovered the
main or continent of America, Friday, the weather
being very serene, looks very earnestly towards the
main land, and, in a kind of surprise, falls a j umping
and dancing, and calls out to me; I asked him
what was the matter. "O joy," says he, "O glad!
There see my country! there my nation!"
I observed an extraordinary sense of pleasure
appeared in his face, his eyes sparkled, and his
countenance discovered a strange eagerness, as if he
had a mind to be in his own country again; and this
observation of mine put a great many thoughts into
me, which made me at first not so easy about my
new man Friday as I was before; and I made no
doubt, but that if Friday could get back to his own
nation again, he would not only forget all his religion,
but all his obligation to me.
But I wronged the poor honest creature very much,
for which I was very sorry for afterwards; however,
as my jealousy increased, and held me some weeks,
I was a little more circumspect, and not so familiar
and kind to him as before, in which I was certainly
in the wrong.
Whilst my jealousy of him lasted, I was every day
pumping him to see if he would discover any of the
new thoughts, which I suspected were in him; but
I found every thing he said was honest, and so inno-
cent, that I could find nothing to nourish my suspi-
eion, and, in spite of all my uneasiness, he made me
at last entirely his own again; nor did he in the
least perceive that I was uneasy, and therefore I could not suspect him of deceit.
One day, walking up the same hill, but the weather
being hazy at sea, so that we could not see the con-
tinent, I called to him, and said, " Friday, do not you
wish yourself in your own country, your own nation?"
"Yes," he said, "I be much glad to be at my own
nation."—i'What would you do there?" said I,
"would you turn wild again, eat man's flesh again,
and be savage as you were before?" He looked full
of concern, and shaking his head, said, "No, no;
Friday tell them to live good, tell them to pray God,
tell them to eat corn-bread, cattle-flesh, milk; no
eat man again." —" Why, then," said I to him, " they
will kill you." He looked grave at that, and then
said, " No, they no kill me; they willing love learn."
He meant by this, they would be willing to learn; he
added, they learned much of the bearded mans that
came in the boat. Then I asked him if he would go
back to them. He smiled at that, and told me he
could not swim so far. I told him I would make a
canoe for him. He told me he would go, if I would
go with him. "I go," said I , "why they will eat
me if I come there."—" No, no," said he, " me make
them no eat you; me make they much love you."
He meant he would tell them how I had killed his
enemies, and saved his life, and so he would make
them much love me.
From this time, I confess, I had a mind to venture
over, and see if I could possibly join with these
bearded men, who, I made no doubt, were Spaniards
or Portuguese; not doubting but, if I could, we
might find some method to escape from thence, being
upon the continent, and a good company together,
better than I could from an island, forty miles off
the shore, and alone without help. So after some
days, I took Friday to work again, by way of di*,
course, and told him, I would give him a boat to go
back to his own nation; ana accordingly carried
him to my frigate, which lay on the other side of the
island, and having cleared it of the water, I brought
it out, showed it him, and we both went into it.
I found he was very dextrous at managing it,
and would make it go almost as swift again as I could; so I said to him, "Well, now, Friday, shall
we go to your nation?" He looked very dull at my
saying so, which, it seems, was because he thought
the boat was too small to go so far. I told him then I had a bigger; so the next day I went to the place
where the first boat lay, which I had made, but
which I could not get into the water. He said that
was big enough; but as I had taken no care of it, and
it had lain two or three-and-twenty years there, the
sun had split and dried it, that it was in a manner
rotten. Friday told me that such a boat would do
very well, and would carry "much enough vittle,
drink, bread;" that was his way of talking.
Upon the whole, I was by this time so fixed upon
my design of going over with him to the continent,
that I told him we would go and make one as big as
that, and he should go home in it. He answered
not one word, but looked very grave and sad: I
asked him what was the matter with him. He asked
me train thus, "Why you angry mad with Friday?
What me done?" I asked him what he meant: I told him I was not angry with him at all. "No
angry! no angry!" says he, repeating the words
several times, "why send Friday home away to my
nation ?"—" Why," said I, " Friday, did you not say
you wished you were there 1"—" Yes, yes," says he,
"wish we both there; no wish Friday there, no mas-
ter there." In a word, he would not think of going
there without me. "I go there, Friday!" said I,
"what should I do there 1" He turned very quick
upon me at this—" You do great deal much good,"
says he, "you teach wild mans be good, sober, tame
mans: you tell them know God, pray God, and live
new life."—"Alas, Friday, said I, "thou knowest
not what thou sayest, I am but an ignorant man myself."—"Yes, yes," says he, "you teachee me
good, you teachee them good."—" No, no, Friday,"
said I, "you shall go without me; leave me here to
live by myself, as I did before." he looked confused
at this, and running to one of the hatchets which he
used to wear, he takes it up hastily, and gives it me.
"What must I do with this 1" said I to him. "You
take kill Friday," says he. "What must I kill you
for?" said I again. He returns very quick, "What
you send Friday away for? Take kill Friday; no
send Friday away." As he spoke, tears stood in his
eyes, and I was so affected, that I said I would never
send him away, if he was willing to stay with me.
I found that all the foundation of his desire to go
to his own country was laid in his ardent affection to
the people, and his hopes of my doing them good: a
thing, which as I had no notion of myself, so I had
not the least thought, or intention, or desire of un-
dertaking it. But still I found a strong inclination
to attempting an escape, as above, founded on the
supposition gathered from the former discourse, viz.
that there were seventeen bearded men there; and
therefore. without any more delay, I went to work
with Friday, to find out a great tree proper to fell,
and make a large periagua, or canoe, for the voyage.
After searching some time, Friday at last pitched
upon a tree, for I found he knew much better than I
what kind of wood was fittest for it; nor can I tell,
to this day, what wood to call the tree we cut down,
except Jhat it was very like the tree we call fustic,
or between that and the Nicaragua wood, for it was
much of the same colour and smell. Friday was for
burning the hollow or cavity of this tree out, to make
it into a boat, but I showed him how rather to cut it
out with tools, which after I showed him how to use,
he did it very handily, and in about a month's hard
lnbmir we finished it, and made it very handsome,
especially when with our axes, which I showed him
how to handle, we cut and hewed the outside into the
true shape of a boat. After this, however, it cost us
near a fortnight's time to get her along, as it were,
inch by inch, upon great rollers, into the water; but
when she was in, she would have carried twenty
men with ease.
It amazed me to see with what dexterity, and how
swift my man Friday would manage her, turn her,
and paddle her along. So I asked him, if he would,
and if we might venture over in her. "Yes," lie said,
"me venture over in her very well, though great
blow wind." However, I had a farther design that
he knew nothing of, and that was to make a mast
and a sail, and to fit her with an anchor and cable.
As to the mast, that was easy enough to get, so I
pitched upon a straight young cedar tree, which I found near the place, and which there was plenty of
in the island; and I set Friday to work to cut it
down, and gave him directions how to shape and
order it: but as to the sail, that was my particular
care. I knew I had pieces of old sails, but as I had
had them now twenty-six years by me, and not being
very careful to preserve them, they were nearly all
rotten. However, I found two pieces which appeared
pretty good, and with a great deal of pains, and
awkward tedious stitching, for want of needles, I at
length made a three-cornered ugly thing, like what
we call in England a shoulder-of-'mutton sail, to go
with a boom at bottom, and a little short sprit at the
top, such as usually our ships' long-boats sail with,
and such as I best knew how to manage, because it
was such a one as I used in the boat in whiclp[ made
my escape from Barbary.
'l was near two months in rigging and fitting out
my mast and sails, for I fitted them very complete,
making a small stay, and a sail, or fore-sail to it, to
assist, if we should turn to windward; and, which
was more than all, I fixed a rudder to the stern of her,
to steer with, and though I was but a bungling ship-
wright, yet as I knew the usefulness and even neces-
sity of such a thing, I applied myself with so much
pains to do it, that at last I brought it to pass.
After all this was done, I had my UUHI Friday to
teach as to what belonged to the navigation of my
boat, for though he knew very well how to paddle
the canoe, he knew nothing what belonged to a sail
and a rudder, and how the sail gibbed, and filled this
way or that way, as the course we sailed changed; I say, when he saw this, he stood like one astonished
and amazed. However, with a little use, I made all
these things familiar to him, and he became an expert
sailor, except that as to the compass, I could make
him understand very little of that; but there was
not much occasion for the compass, in these parts.
I was now entered on the seven-and-twentieth
year of my captivity in this place; though the three
last years that I had this creature with me oujjht
rather to be left out of the account, my habitation
being quite of another kind, than in all the rest of the
time. I kept the anniversary of my landing here
with the same thankfulness to God for his mercies as
at first; and if I had such cause of acknowledgment
at first, I had much more so now, having such addi-
tional testimonies of the care of Providence over me,
and the great hopes I had of being effectually and
speedily delivered; for I had an invincible impression
upon my thoughts that my deliverance was at hand,
and that I should not be another year in this place.
However, I went on with all my work, as usual.
The »rainy season was, in the mean time upon me,
when kept more within doors than at other times;
BO I had stowed our new vessel as secure as we could,
bringing her up into the creek, where, as I said in
the beginning, I landed my rafts from the ship: and
thus we waited for the months of November and De-
cember, in which I designed to make my adventure.
When the settled season began to come in, the first
thing I did was to lay by a certain quantity of pro-
visions, being the stores for our voyage; and I in-
tended in a week or a. fortnight's time to open the
dock, and launch out our boat. I was busy one morn-
ing upon something of this kind, when I called to
Friday, and bade him go to the sea-shore, and see if
he could find a turtle or tortoise,, a thing which we
generally got once a week, for the sake of the eggs
as well as the flesh. Friday had not been long gone,
when he came running back, and flew over my out-
ward wall, or fence, like one that felt not the ground;
and before I had time to speak to him, he cried out
to me, " O master! O master! O sorrow! O bad!"—
"What's the matter, Friday?" said I. "O yonder
there," says he^ "one, two, three canoe! one, two,
three!" By this way of speaking, I concluded there
were six; but, on inquiry, I found there were but
three. "Well, Friday," said 1, "do not be fright-
ened;" So I heartened him up as well as I could.
However, I saw the poor fellow was most terribly
seared, for nothing ran in his head but that they
were come to look for him, and would cut him in
pieces, and eat him; and the poor fellow trembled
so, that I scarce knew what to do with him. I com-
forted him as well as I could, and told him I was in
as much danger as he, and that they would eat me
as well as him. "But," said I, "Friday, we must
resolve to fight them. Can you fight, Friday?"—
"Me shoot, says he, " but there come many great
number."—" No matter for that," said I again, " our
guns will fright them, that we do not kill." So I
asked him whether, if I resolved to defend him, he
would defend me, and stand by me, and do just as I bade him. He said, "Me die when you bid die,
master." So I gave him a good dram of rum; and
when he had drank it, I made him take the two
fowling-pieces, and load them with swan-shot, as
big as small pistol-bullets: then I took four muskets,
and loaded them with two slugs and five small butlets each; and my two pistols I loaded with a brace
of bullets each. 'I hung my great sword, as usual,
naked by by my side, and gave Friday his hatchet.
When I had thus prepared myself, I took my per-
spective glass, 'and went up to the side of the hill to
see what I could discover, and I found quickly by
my glass that there were twenty-one savages, three
prisoners, and three canoes; and that their whole
business seemed to be the triumphant banquet upon
these three human bodies; but nothing more than as
I had observed as usual with them.
They were landed, not where they had done when
Friday made his escape, but nearer to my creek,
where the shore was low, and where a thick wood
came close almost down to the sea. This, with the
abhorrence of the inhuman errand these wretches
came about, so filled me with indignation, that I
came down to Friday, and told him I was resolved
to go down to them and kill them all, and asked him
if he would stand by me. He had now gotten over
his fright, and his spirits being a little raised with
the dram I had given him, he was very cheerful, and
told me as before, " he would die when I bid die."
In this fit of fury, I took first and divided the arms
which I had charged, as before, between us; I gave
Friday one pistol to stick in his girdle, and three guns
upon his shoulder; and I took one pistol and the
other three myself; and in this posture we marched
out. I took a small bottle of rum in my pocket, and
gave Friday a large bag with more powder and bul-
lets; and as to orders, I charged him to keep close
behind me, and not to stir, or shoot, or do any thing
till I bade him: and, in the mean time, not to speak
a word. In this posture I fetched a compass to my
right hand of near a mile, as well to get over the
creek as to get into the wood, so that I might come
within a shot of them before I should be discovered,
which I had seen by my glass it was easy to do.
I entered the wood with all possible wariness and
silence (Friday following close at my heels,) and
marched till I came to the skirt of the wood, on the
side which was next to them; only that one corner
of the wood lay between me and them. Here I called
softly to Friday, and showing him a great tree, which
was just at the corner of the wood, I bade him go to
the tree, and bring me word if he could ape there
plainly what they were doing. He did so, and came
immediately back to me, and told me they might be
plainly viewed there ; that they were all about the
fire, eating the flesh of one of their prisoners; and
that another lay bound. upon the sand, a little from
them, whom, he said, they would kill next, and ,which fired the very soul within me. He told me it was
not one of their nation, but one of the bearded men
whom he had told me of, that came to their country
in the boat. I was filled with horror at the very
naming the wThite, bearded man, and, going to the
tree, I saw plainly by my glass a white man, who
lay upon the beach of the sea, with his hands and
feet tied with flags, or things like rushes, and that
he was an European, and had clothes on.
There was another tree, and a little thicket beyond
it, about fifty yards nearer to them than the place
where I was, which, by going a little way about, I
saw I might come at undiscovered, and that then I
should be within half a shot of them. So I withheld
my passion, and, going back about twenty paces, I got behind some bushes, which held all the way till
I came to the other tree, and then I came to a little
rising ground, which gave me a full view of them, at
the distance of about eighty yards.
I had now not a moment to lose; for nineteen of
the dreadful wretches sat upon the ground, all close
huddled together, and had just sent the other two to
butcher the poor Christian, and bring him, perhaps,
limb by limb, to their fire; and they were stooped
down to untie the bands at his feet. I turned to
Friday: "Now, Friday," said 1, "do as I bid thee."
Friday said he would. "Then, Friday," said I , " do
exactly as you see me do; fail in nothing." So I set
down one of the muskets and the fowling-piece upon
the ground, and Friday did the like by his; and with
the other musket I took my aim at the savages, bid-
ding him do the like: then asking him if he was
ready, he said, " Yes."—" Then fire at them," said I ;
and the same moment I fired also.
Friday took his aim so much better than 1, that
on the side he shot he killed two of them, and
wounded three more; and, on my side, I killed one,
and wounded two. They were in a dreadful con-
sternation; and all of them who were not hurt jumped
up upon their feet immediately, but did not know
which way to run, or which way to look, for they
knewnotfromwhence their destruction came. Friday
kept his eyes close upon me, that, as I bid him, he
might observe what I did", so, as soon as the first
shot was made, I threw down the piece and took up
the fowling-piece, and Friday did the like: he sees
me cock and present; he did the same again. "Are
you ready, Friday?" said I. "Yes," said he. "Let
fly, then," said 1, "in the name of God;" and with
that I fired again among the amazed wretches, and so did Friday; and as our pieces were now loaded with what I call swan-shot, or small pistol bullets,
we found only two drop; but so many were wounded,
that they ran about yelling and screaming like mad
creatures, all bloody and wounded, most of them;
and three more fell quickly after, but not quite dead.
"Now, Friday," said I, laying down the discharged
pieces and taking up the musket, which was yet
loaden," follow me," which he did with a deal' of
courage; upon which I rushed out of the wood and
showed myself, and Friday close at my foot. As
soon as I perceived they saw me, I shouted as loud
as I could, and bade Friday do so too; and running
as fast as I could, which, by the way, was not very
fast, I made directly towards the poor victim, who
was, as I said, lying upon the beach or shore, between
the place where they sat and the sea. The two butchers, who were just going to work with him, had left him
at the surprise of our first fire, and fled, in a terrible
fright, to the sea-side, and had jumped into a canoe,
and three more of the rest made the same way. I turned to Friday, and bade him- step forwards and
fire at them; he understood me immediately, and,
running about forty yards to be nearer them, he shot
at them, and I thought he had killed them all, for I saw them all fall on a heap in the boat, though I saw
two of them up again quickly; however, he killed
two of them, and wounded the third, so that he lay
in the bottom of the boat as if he had been dead.
While Friday fired at them, I pulled out my knife
and cut the flags that bound the poor victim; and,
loosing his hands and feet, I lifted him up, and asked
him, in the Portuguese tongue, what he was. He
answered, in Latin, " Christianus;" but was so weak
and faint, that he could scarce stand or speak. I took my bottle out of my pocket and gave it him,
making signs that he should drink, which he did;
and I gave him a piece of bread, which he eat. Then
I asked him what countryman he was, and he said
"Espagnole:" and, being a little recovered, let me
know, by all the signs he could possibly make, how
much he was in my debt for his deliverance. I said,
in as good Spanish as I could, "we will talk after-
wards, but we must fight now: if you have any
strength left, take the pistol and sword and lay about
you." He took them very thankfully, and no sooner
had he the arms in his hands, but, as if they put new
-vigour into him, he flew upon his murderers like a
fury, and had cut two of them in pieces in an instant;
for they were so surprised and frightened, that they
could make no resistance, nor attempt to escape.'
I kept my piece in my hand still, without firing,
being willing to keep my charge ready, because I had given the Spaniard my pistol and sword; so I
called to Friday, and bade him run up to the tree
from whence we first fired, and fetch the arms which
lay there that had been discharged, which he quickly
did; and then giving him my musket, I sat down to
load all the rest again, and bade them come to me
when they wanted. While I was loading these
pieces, there happened a fierce engagement between
the Spaniard and one of the savages, who made at
him with one of their great wooden swords, the same
weapon that was to have killed him before, if I had
not prevented it. The 9paniard,'who was very bold,
though weak, had fought this Indian a good while,
and had cut him two great wounds on his head; but
the savage, being a stout, lusty fellow, closing in with
him, had thrown him down, and was wringing my
sword out of his hand, when the Spaniard, though
undermost, wisely quitted the sword, drew the pistol
from his girdle, and shot him dead on the spot.
Friday, being now left at his liberty, pursued the
flying wretches with no weapon in his hand but his
hatchet; and with that he dispatched those three
who were wounded at first and fallen, and all the
rest he could come up with; and the Spaniard coming
to me for a gun, I gave him one of the fowling-pieces,
with which he pursued two of the savages, and
wounded them both; but as he was not able to run,
they both got from him into the wood, where Friday
pursued them, and killed one of them; but the other
was too nimble for him; and though he was wounded,
yet had plunged into the sea, and swam with all his
might off to those who were left in the canoe, which
three in the canoe, with one wounded, we know not
whether he died or no, were all that escaped our
hands of one-and-twenty.
Those that were in the canoe worked hard to get
out of gun-shot; and though Friday made two or
three shots at them, I did not find that he hit any of
them. Friday would fain have had me take one of
their canoes and pursue them, and indeed I was very
anxious about their escape, lest, carrying the news
home to their people, they should come back, per-
haps, with two or three hundred of their canoes, and
devour us by mere multitude; so I consented to
pursue them by sea; and running to one of their
canoes, I jumped in, and bade Friday follow me; but
when I was in the canoe, I was surprised to find
another poor creature lie there alive, bound hand and
foot, as the Spaniard was, for the slaughter, and almost
dead with fear, not knowing what the matter was,
for he had not been able to look up over the side of
the boat; he was tied so hard, neck and heels, and
had been tied so long, that he had little life in him.
I immediately cut the twisted flags, or rushes, that
bound him, ana would have helped him up; but he1
could not stand or speak, but groaned mostpiteously.
believing, it seems, still, that he was only unbound
in order to be killed. When Friday came, I bade
him speak to him, and tell him of his deliverance;
end pulling out my bottle, made him give the poor
wretch a dram, which, with the news of his being
delivered, revived him, and he sat up in the boat;
bat when Friday came to hear him speak, and looked
in his face, it would have moved any one to tears to
have seen how Friday kissed him, embraced him,
hugged him, cried, laughed, hallooed, jumped about,
danced, sung, then cried again, wrung his hands,
beat his own face and head, and then sung and
jumped about again, like a distracted creature. It
was a good while before I could make him speak to
me, or tell me what was the matter; but when he
came a little to himself, he said that it was his father.
It is not easy for me to express how it moved me.
to see what ecstasy and filial affection had worked
in this poor savage, at the sight of his father, and of
his being delivered from death: nor indeed can I
describe half the extravagance of his affection after
this, for he went into the boat and out of the boat, *
p 2
great many times. When he went in to him, he
would sit down by him, open his breast, and hold his
father's head close to his bosom half an hour toge-
ther, to nourish it; then he took his arms and ankles, which were numbed and stiff with the binding, and
chafed and rubbed them with his hands; and I per-
ceiving what the case was, gave him some rum out
of my bottle to rub them with, which did them a
great deal of good.
This action put an end to our pursuit of the canoe
with the other savages, who were now gotten almost
out of sight; and it was happy for us that we did not,
for it blew so hard within two hours after, and be-
fore they could be gotten a quarter of their way, and
continued blowing so hard all night, and that from
the north-west, which was against them, that I could
not suppose their boat could live, or that they ever
reached to their own coast-
But to return to Friday, he was so busy about his
father, that I could not find in my heart to take him
off for some time: but after I thought he could leave
him a little, I called him to me, and he camejumping
and laughing, and pleased to the highest extreme.
Then I asked him if he had given his father any
bread. He shook his head, and said, "None: ugly
dog eat all up self." So I gave him a cake of bread
out of a little pouch I carried on purpose: I also
gave him a dram for himself, but he would not taste
it, but carried it to his father. I had in my pocket
also two or three bunches of my raisins, so I gave
him a handful of them for his father. He had no
sooner given his father these raisins, but I saw him
come out of the boat, and run away, as if he had
been bewitched. He ran at such a rate (for he was
the swiftest fellow of his foot that ever I saw), I say,
he ran at such a rate, that he was out of sight, as it
were in an instant; and though I called and hallooed
too after him, it was all one: away he went, aud in
a quarter of an hour I saw him come back again,
though not so fast as he went; and as he came nearer
I found his pace was slacker, because he had some-
thin? in his hand.
When he came to me, I found he had been quite
home for an earthen jug, or pot, to bring his father
some fresh water, and that he had got two more
cakes or loaves of bread. The bread he gave me, but
the water he carried to his father; however, as I was
very thirsty too, I took a little sup of it. The water
revived his father more than all the rum or spirits I
had given him, for he was just fainting with thirst.
When his father had drunk, I called to him to
know if there was any water left; he said, "Yes,"
and I bade him give it to the poor Spaniard, who
was as much in want of it as his father, and I sent
one of the cakes that Friday brought to the Spaniard
too, who was indeed very weak, and was reposing
himself upon a green place, under the shade of a tree,
and whose limbs were also very stiff, and very much
swelled with the rude bandage he had been tied
with. When I saw that upon Friday's coming up
to him with the water, he sat up and drank, and
took the bread and began to eat, I went up to him
and gave him a handful of raisins. He looked up in
my face with all the tokens of gratitude and thank-
fulness that could appear in any countenance; but was so weak, notwithstanding he had so exerted
himself in the fight, that he could not stand upon his
feet: he tried to do it two or three times, but was
really not able, his ankles were so swelled, and so
painful to him; so I bade him sit still, and caused
Friday to rub his ankles, and bathe them with rum,
as he had done his father's.
I observed the poor affectionate creature, every
two minutes, or perhaps less, all the while he was
here, turned his head about to see for his father; and
at last he missed him, at which he started up, and,
without speaking a word, flew with that swiftness
to him, that one could scarce perceive his feet to
touch the ground as he Went; but when he came, he
found he had only laid himself down to ease his limbs.
So Friday came back to me presently, and I then
told him to help the Spaniard to the boat; so he took
him upon his back, and carried him beside his father
in the boat, and stepping out again, launched the
boat off, and paddled it along the shore faster than I could walk, though the wind blew pretty hard too; so
he brought them both safe into our creek, and leaving
them in the boat, runs away to fetch the other canoe.
As he passed me, I spoke to him, and asked him.
whither he went. He told me, "Go fetch more
boat." So away he went, like the wind; for sure
never man or horse ran like him; and he had the
other canoe in the creek almost as soon as I got to
it by land: so he wafted me over, and then went to
help our new guests out of the boat, which he did;
but they were neither of them able to walk, so that
poor Friday knew not what to do.
At last, we made a kind of hand-barrow to lay
them on, and Friday and I carried them up both
together upon it between us. But when we got them
to the outside of our wall, or fortification, we were
at a worse loss than before, for it was impossible to
get them over; and I was resolved not to break it
down. So I set to work again; and Friday and I,
in about two hours' time, made a very handsome tent,
covered with old sails, and above that with boughs
of trees, being in the space without our outward
fence, and between that and the grove of young wood
which I had planted: and here we made them two
beds of such things as I had, viz. of good rice straw,
with blankets laid upon it to lie on, and another to
cover them on each bed.
My island was now peopled, and I thought myself
very rich in subjects; and it was a merry reflection
which I frequently made, how like a king I looked.
First of all, the whole country was my own mere pro-
perty, so that I had an undoubted right of dominion.
Secondly, my people were perfectly subjected; I
was the absolute lord and lawgiver: they all owed
their lives to me, and were ready to lay down their
lives, if there had been occasion of it, for me. It was
remarkable, too, I had but three subjects, and they
were of three different religions: my man Friday
was a protestant; his father was a pagan and a can-
nibal; and the Spaniard was a papist. However, I
allowed liberty of conscience to all my subjects.
As soon as I had secured my two weak, rescued
prisoners, and given them shelter, and a place to
rest them upon, I began to think of making some
provision for them; and the first thing I did, I or-
dered Friday to take a yearling goat, betwixt a kid
and a goat, out of my particular flock, *a be killed.
Then I cut off the hinder quarter, and chopping it
into small pieces, I set Friday to work to boiling and
stewing, and made them a very good dish of flesh
and broth, and we all enjoyed it, and eat heartily.
After we had dined, or rather supped, I ordered
Friday to take one of the canoes, and go and fetch
our muskets and other fire-arms from the place of
battle; and the next day I ordered him to go and
bury the dead bodies of the savages, which lay open
to the sun, and would presently be offensive; and I
also ordered him to bury the horrid remains of their
barbarous feast; all of which he punctually performed.
I then began to enter into a little conversation
with my two new subjects; and first I set Friday to
enquire of his father what he thought of the escape
of the savages in that canoe, and whether we might expect a return of them with a power too great for
us to resist. His first opinion was, that the savages
in the boat never could live out the storm which blew
that night they went off, but must be drowned or
driven south to those other shores, where they were
as sure to be devoured as they were to be drowned,
if they were cast away; but as to what they would
do, if they came on shore, he said, he knew not but
frightened with the manner of their being attacked,
the noise and the fire, that he believed they would
tell their people they were all killed by thunder and
lightning, and not by the hand of man: and that the
two which appeared (viz. Friday and I) were two
heavenly spirits and furies come down to destroy
them, and not with weapons. And this old savage
was right; for though they escaped the sea, they
gave such dreadful accounts in their own country
(as I heard afterwards,) that they never ventured
from that part to my island again.
But I was under continual apprehensions for some
time, and kept upon my guard, I and all my army,
for as we were now four of us, I would have ventured
upon a hundred of them, in the open field.
In a little time, however, no more canoes appear-
ing, the fear of their coming wore off, and I began
to take my former thoughts of a voyage to the main
into consideration, being likewise assured by Friday's
father, that I might depend upon good usage from
their nation, on his account, if I would go.
But my thoughts were a little suspended, when I
had a serious discourse with the Spaniard, and when
I understood that there were sixteen more of his
countrymen and Portuguese, who having been cast
away, and made their escape to that side, lived there
at peace indeed with the savages, but were very sore
put to it for necessaries, and indeed for life. I asked
him all the particulars of their voyage, and found
they were a Spanish ship, bound from the Rio de la
Plata to the Havannah, being directed to leave their
loading there, which was chiefly hides and silver,
and to bring back what European goods they could
meet with there; that they had five Portuguese
seamen on hoard, whom they took out of another
wreck; that five of their own men were drowned
when first their ship was lost; and that these escaped
through infinite dangers and hazards, and arrived,
almost starved, on the cannibal coast, where they
expected to be devoured every moment.
He told me, they had some arms with them, but
they were perfectly useless, for that they had neither
powder nor ball, the washing of the sea having spoiled
all their powder, but a little which they used at their
first landing, to provide themselves some food.
I asked him what he thought would become of
them there; and if they had formed no design of
making an escape. He said they had many consulta-
tions about it, but having neither vessel, nor tools to
build one, nor provisions of any kind, their counsels
always ended in tears and despair. I asked him how
he thought they would receive a proposal from me,
which might tend towards an escape; and whether,
if they were all here, it might not be done.
He told me they were all under the greatest dis-
tress imaginable, and if I would undertake their
relief, they would live and die by me.
Upon these assurances, I resolved to venture to
relieve them, if possible, and to send the old savage
and the Spaniard over to them to treat. But when
he had gotten all things in readiness to go, the Spa-
niard himself started an objection, which had so
much prudence in it on the one hand, and so much
sincerity on the other hand, that I could not but be
well satisfied in it; and, by his advice, put off the
deliverance of his comrades for at least half a year.
The case was thus:—He had been with us now
about a month, during which time I had let him see
in what manner I had provided, with the assistance
of Providence, for my support; and he saw evidently
what stock of corn and rice I had laid up, which, as
it was more than sufficient for myself, so it was not
sufficient, at least without good husbandry, for my
family, now it was increased to the number of four,
but much less would it be sufficient if his country-
men, who were, as he said, fourteen, still alive, should
come over: and, least of all, would it be sufficient to
victual our vessel, if we should build one, for a voyage to any of the Christian colonies of America. So he
told me, he thought it would be more advisable to let
him, and the two others, dig and cultivate more land,
as much as I could spare seed to sow; and that we
should wait another harvest, then we might have a
supply of corn for his countrymen, when they should
come; for want might be a temptation to them to
disagree, or not think themselves delivered, other-
wise than out of one difficulty into another.
His caution was so reasonable, and his advice so
good, that I could not but be very well pleased with
his proposal, as well as I was satisfied with his fide-
lity. So we fell to digging, all four of us, as well as
the wooden tools we were furnished with permitted:
and in about a month's time, by the end of which it
was seed time, we had gotten as much land cured
and trimmed up as we sowed twenty-two bushels of
barley on, and sixteen jars of rice, which was, in
short, all the seed we had to spare.
Having now society enough, and our number being
sufficient to put us out of fear of savages, if they had
come, unless their number had been very great, we
went freely all over the island, wherever we found
occasion ; and as we had our escape or deliverance upon
our thoughts, it was impossible, at least for me, to
have the means of it out of mine. To this purpose,
I marked out several trees, which I thought fit for
our work, and I set Friday and his father to cutting
them down; and then I caused the Spaniard to over-
see and direct their work. I showed them with what
indefatigable pains I had hewed a large tree into
single planks, and I caused them to do the like, till
they had made about a dozen large planks of good
oak', near two feet broad, thirty-five feet long, and
from two inches to four inches thick. What prodi-
gious labour it took up, any one may imagine.
At the same time, I contrived to increase my little
flock of tame goats as much as I could; and to this
purpose I made Friday and the Spaniard go out one
day, and myself with Friday the next day, for we
took our turns; and, by this means, we got about
twenty young kids to breed up with the rest, for
whenever we shot the dam, we saved the kids, and
added them to our flock. But, above all, the season
for curing the grapes coming on, I caused such a
prodigious quantity to be hung up in the sun, that I believe, had we been at Alicant, where raisins are
cured, we should have filled sixty or eighty barrels;
and these, with our bread, was a great part of our food.
It was now harvest, and our crop in good order.
It was not the most plentiful increase I had seen in
the island, but, however, it was enough to answer
our end, for, from our twenty-two bushels of barley,
we brought in and threshed out above two hundred
and twenty bushels, and the like in proportion of the
rice, which was store enough for our food to the next
harvest, though all the fourteen Spaniards had been
on shore with me; or, if we had been ready for a
voyage, it would very plentifully have victualled our
ship to have carried us to any part of the world, that
is to say of America. When we had thus housed and
secured our magazine of corn, we fell to work to
make more wicker-work, viz. great baskets in which
we kept it; and the Spaniard was very handy and
dextrous at this part.
And now having a full supply of food for all the
guests I expected, I gave the Spaniard leave to go
over to the main, to see what he could do with those
he had left behind him there. I gave him strict
charge not to bring any man with him, who would
not first swear, in the presence of himself and the old
savage, that he would in no way injure, fight with,
or attack the person he should find in the island,
who was so kind as to send for them, in order to
their deliverance; but that they would stand by
and defend him against all such attempts, and
wherever they went, would be entirely under, and
subjected to his command; and that this should be
put in writing, and signed with their hands.
Under these instructions, the Spaniard, and the
old savage went away in one of the canoes which they
came in, when they were brought as prisoners to be
devoured by the savages. I gave each of them a
musket, and about eight charges of powder and ball,
charging them to be very careful of both, and not to
use either of them but upon very urgent occasions.
This was a cheerful work, being the first measures
used by me, in view of my deliverance, for now
twenty-seven years and some days. I gave them
provisions of bread, and of dried grapes sufficient for
themselves for many days, and sufficient for all their
countrymen for about eight days; and wishing them
a good voyage, I let them go, agreeing with them
about a signal they should hang out at their return,
by which I should know them again, when they came
back, at a distance, before they came on shore.
They went away, with a fair gale, on the day that
the moon was at the full, by my account, in the
month of October, as near as I could tell.
It was no less than eight days I waited for them,
when a strange and unforeseen occurrence intervened,
of which the like has not, perhaps, been heard of in
history. I was fast asleep in my hut one morning,
when my man Friday came running in to me, and
called aloud, "Master, master, they are come, they
are come!" I jumped up, and, regardless of danger,
went out, as soon as I could get my clothes on,
through my little grove; I went without my arms,
which it was not my custom to do; but I was sur-
prised, when, turning my eyes to the sea, I presently
saw a boat, at about a league and a half's distance,
standing in for the shore, with a shoulder-of-mutton
sail, as they call it, and the wind blowing pretty fair
to bring them in. Also I observed, that they did
not come from that side which the shore lay on, but
from the southernmost end of the island, upon this
I called Friday in, and bade him lie close, for these
were not the people we looked for, and that we did
not know yet whether they were friends or enemies.
In the next place, I went in to fetch my perspective
glass, to see what I could make of them; and having
taken the ladder out, I climbed up to the top of the
hill, as I used to do, when I was apprehensive of any
thing, and to take my view plainer, without being
discovered. I had scarce set my foot on the hill,
when my eye plainly discovered a ship lying at
anchor, at about two leagues and a half's distance
from me, S.S.E. but not above a league and a half
from the shore. It appeared plainly to be an English
ship, and the boat an English long boat.
I cannot express the confusion I was in, though
the joy of seeing a ship, and one which, I had reason
to believe was manned by my own countrymen, and
consequently friends, was such as I cannot describe;
but yet I had some secret doubts hung about me, I cannot tell from whence they came, bidding me to
be on my guard. I began to consider what business
an English ship could have here; since it was not
the way to or from any part of the world where the
English had any traffic; and I knew there had been
no storms to drive them in there, as in distress; and
that if they were English really, it was probable they
were here upon no good design, and that I had better
continue as I was, than fall into the hands of thieves
and murderers.
Let no man despise the secret hints and notices of
danger, which sometimes are given him, when he
may possibly think there is no danger of its being
real. That such hints and notices are given us, I believe few, that have made any observations of
things, can deny; that they are certain discoveries
of an invisible world, and a converse of spirits, we
cannot doubt; and if the tendency of them seems to
be to warn us of danger, why should we not suppose
they are from some friendly agent (whether supreme,
or inferior and subordinate, is not the question,) and
that they are given for our good?
The present question abundantly confirms me in
the justice of this reasoning; for had I not been made
cautious by this secret admonition, I had been undone
inevitably, and in a far worse condition than before.
I had not kept myself long in this posture, when I saw the boat draw near the shore, as if they looked
for a creek to thrust in at, for the convenience of
landing: however, as they did not come quite far
enough, they did not see the little inlet where I for-
merly landed my rafts, but ran their boat on shore
upon the beach, at about half a mile from me, which
was very happy for me; for otherwise they would
have landed just, as I may say, at my door, and
would soon have beaten me out of my castle, and,
perhaps, have plundered me of all I had.
When they were on shore, I was fully satisfied
they were Englishmen, at least, most of them, one or
two I thought were Dutch, but it did not prove so.
There were in all eleven men, whereof three I found
were unarmed, and, (as I thought) bound; and when
the first four or five of them were jumped on shore,
they took those three out of the boat as prisoners.
One of the three I could perceive using the most
passionate gestures of entreaty, affliction, and des-
pair; the other two lifted up their hands sometimes,
and appeared concerned indeed, but not so much as
the first.
I was perfectly confounded at the sight, and knew
not what the meaning of it should be. Friday called
out to me, in English, as well as he could, " O master,
you see English mans eat prisoners as well as savage
mans."—"Why," said 1, "do you think they are
going to eat them then F--- " Yes," says Friday, " they
will eat them."—" No, no," said I, "Friday, I am
afraid they will murder them indeed, but you may
be sure they will not eat them."
All this while I had no thought of what the matter
really was, but expected every moment the three
prisoners would be killed; and once I saw one of the
villains lift up his arm, with a great cutlass, or sword,
to strike one of the poor men, and I expected to see
him fall every moment. I wished heartily now for
my Spaniard, and the savage that was gone with
him; or that I had any way to have come undisco-
vered within shot of them, that I might have rescued
the three men, for they had no fire-arms that I saw.
After I had observed the outrageous usage of the
three men, by the insolent seamen, I saw that the
fellows ran scattering about the land, as if they
wanted to see the country. I observed also, that the
three other men had liberty to go where they pleased,
but that they sat down all three upon the ground very
pensive, and looked like men in despair.
It was just at the top of high-water when these
people came on shore, and while partly they stood
parleying with the prisoners they brought, and partly
while they rambled about to see what kind of place
they were in, they had carelessly stayed till the tide
was spent, and the water was ebbed considerably
away, leaving the boat aground. They had left two
men in the boat, who, as I found afterwards, having
drank a little too much brandy, fell asleep. However,
one of them waking sooner than the other, and find-
ing the boat too fast aground for him to stir it, hal-
looed for the rest, who were straggling about, upon
which they all soon came to the boat, but it was past
all their strength to launch her, the boat being very
heavy, and the shore on that side being a soft. oozy
sand, almost like a quicksand. In this condition,
like true seamen, who are perhaps, the least of all
mankind given to forethought, they gave it over, and
away they strolled about the country again; and I
heard one of them say aloud to another (calling them
off from the boat), "Why, let her alone, Jack, can't
ye I Shell float next tide." By which I was fully
confirmed what countrymen they were.
All this while I kept myself close, not once daring
to stir out of my castle, any farther than to my place
of observation, near the top of the hill. I knew it
would be no less than ten hours before the boat could
be afloat again, and by that time it would be dark,
and I might be more at liberty to see their motions,
and to hear their discourse, if they had any.
In the mean time, I fitted myself up for a battle,
as before, though with more caution, knowing I had
to do with another kind of enemy than I had at first.
I ordered Friday also to load himself with arms. I
took myself two fowling-piecs, and I gave him three
muskets. My figure indeed was very fierce; I had
my formidable goat-skin coat on, with the great cap
I have mentioned, a naked sword by my side, two
pistols in my belt, and a gun upon each shoulder.
It was my design, as I said above, not to have made
any attempt until it was dark, but about two o'clock,
being the heat of the day, I found that they were all
gone straggling into the woods, and, as I thought,
were all laid down to sleep. The three poor dis-
tressed men, too anxious for their condition to get
any sleep, were, however, sat down under the shelter
of a great tree, at about a quarter of a mile from me,
and, as I thought, out of sight of any of the rest.
Upon this I resolved to discover myself to them,
and learn something of their condition. Immediately
I marched with my man Friday at a good distance
behind me, as formidable for his arms as I, but not
making quite so staring a spectre-like figure as I did.
I came as near them undiscovered as I could, and
then, before any of them saw me, I called aloud to
them, in Spanish, " what are ye, gentlemen?"
They started up at the noise, but were ten times
more confounded when they saw me, and the uncouth
figure I made. They made no answer at all, but I
thought I perceived them just going to fly from me,
when I spoke to them in English :—" Gentlemen,"
said I. "do.not be surprised at me; perhaps you
may have a friend near you, when you did not expect
it."—" He must be sent directly from heaven then,"
Said one of them very gravely to me, and pulling off
his hat at the same time, "for pur condition is past
the help of man."—" All help is from heaven, sir,"
said 1, "but can you put a stranger in the way how
to help you, for you seem to be in some great dis-
tress 1 I saw you when you landed; and when you seemed to make application to the brutes that came
with you, I saw one lift up his sword to kill you.".
The poor man, with tears running down his face,
and trembling, looking like one astonished, returned,
"Am I talking to God or man? Is it a real man, or
an angel?"—" Be in no fear about that, sir," said 1,
"if God had sent an angel to relieve you, he would
have come better clothed, and armed after another
manner, than you see me. Pray lay aside your
fears, I am a man, an Englishman, and disposed to
assist you, you see. I have one servant only: we
have arms and ammunition. Tell us freely, can we
serve you? What is your case?"
"Our case, sir," said he, "is too long to tell you, while our murderers are so near; but, in short, sir, I
was commander of that ship, my men have mutinied
against me, they have been hardly prevailed upon not to murder me, and, at last, "have set me on
shore in this desolate place, with these two men
with me, one my mate, the other a passenger, where
we expected to perish, believing the place to be un-
inhabited, and know not yet what to think of it."
"Where are those brutes, your enemies?" said 1,
"do you know where they are gone 2"—" There they
are, sir," said he, pointing to a thicket of trees, " my heart trembles for fear they have seen us, and heard
you speak; if they have, they will murder us all."
"Have they any fire-arms f" said I. He answered,
"They had only two pieces, and one which they left
in the boat."—" Well then," said 1, "leave the rest
tome. I see they are asleep. It is 8n easy thing to
Q
kill them all; but shall we rather take them prison-
ers?" He told me there were two desperate villains
among them, that it was scarce safe to show any
mercy to, but if they were secured, he believed all
the rest would return to their duty. I asked him
which they were. He told me he could not, at that
distance, describe them: but he would obey my
orders in any thing I would direct. "Well," said 1,
"let us retreat out of their view or hearing, lest they
awake, and we will resolve farther." So they wil-
lingly went back with me, till the woods covered us
from them. "Look you, sir," said I , "if I venture
upon your deliverance, are you willing to make two
conditions with me?" He anticipated my proposals,
by telling me, that both he and the ship, if recovered,
should be wholly directed and commanded by me in
every thing; and if the ship was not recovered, he
would live and die with me, in what part of the world
soever I would send him; and the two others said
the same.
"Well," said I, "my conditions are but two :—
first, that while you stay on this island with me.
you will not pretend to any authority here; and if I put arms in your hands, you will, upon all occasions,
give them up to me, and do no prejudice to me or
mine, upon this island; and, in the mean time, be
governed by my orders. Secondly, that if the ship
is or may be recovered, you will carry me and my
man to England passage free." He gave me all the
assurances that the invention and faith of man could
devise, that he would comply with these most rea-
sonable demands, and, besides, would owe his life to
me, and acknowledge it, upon all occasions, as long
as he lived.
"Well then," said I, "here are three muskets for
you, with powder and ball. Tell me next what you
think is proper to be done." He showed all the
testimony of his gratitude that he was able; but
offered to be wholly guided by me, I told him I
thought it was hard venturing any thing, but the best
method I could think of, was to fire upon them at
once, as they lay; and if any were not killed at the
first volley, and offered to submit, we might save
them, and so put it wholly upon God's providence to
direct the shot.
He said very modestly that he was loath to kill
them, if he could help it, but that those two were
incorrigible villains, and had been the authors of all
the mutiny in the ship, and if they escaped we should
be undone still, for they would go on board and bring
the whole ship's company, and destroy us all. "Well then," said 1, " necessity legitimates my advice; for
it is the only way to save our lives." However, see-
ing him still cautious of shedding blood, I told him
they should go themselves, and manage as they
found convenient.
In the middle of this discourse, we heard some of
them awake, and soon after we saw two of them on
their feet. I asked him if either of them were the
men who, he had said, were the heads of the mutiny.
He said; "No."—"Well, then," said I, "you may
let them escape; and Providence seems to have
awakened them on purpose to save themselves.
Now," said I," if the rest escape you, it is your fault."
Animated with this, he took the musket I had
given him in his hand, and a pistol in his belt, and
his two comrades with him, each man a piece in his
hand. The two men who were with him, going first,
made some noise, at which one of the seamen who
was awake, turned about, and, seeing them coming,
cried out to the rest; but it was too late then, for
the moment he cried out, the two men fired, the cap-
tain wisely reserving his own piece. They had so
well aimed their shot at the men they knew, that one
of them was killed on the spot, and the other very
much wounded; but, not being dead, he started up
upon his feet, and called eagerly for help to the other) but the captain, stepping to him, told him it was too
late to cry for help: he should call upon God to for-
give his villany, and, with that word, knocked him
down with the stock of his musket, so that he never
spoke more. There were three more in the company,
and one of them was also slightly wounded. By this time I was come; and when they saw their danger,
and that it was in vain to resist, they begged for
mercy. The captain told them he would spare their
lives if they would give him any assurance of their
abhorrence of the treachery they had been guilty of,
and would swear to be faithful to him in recovering
the ship, and afterwards in carrying her back to
Jamaica, from whence they came. They gave him
all the protestations of their sincerity that could be
desired, and he was willing to believe them, and spare
their lives, which I was not against; only I obliged
him to keep them bound, hand and foot, while they
were upon the island.
While this was doing, I sent Friday, with the cap-
tain's mate, ;to the boat, with orders to secure her,
and bring away the oars and sail, which they did;
and, by "the bye, three straggling men, that were
parted from the rest, came back again upon hearing
the guns fired; and seeing their captain, who was
before their prisoner, now their conqueror, they sub-
mitted to be bound also.
It now remained that the captain and I should
inquire into one another's circumstances. I began
first, and told him my whole history, which he heard
with an attention even to amazement, and particu-
larly at the wonderful manner of my being furnished
with provisions and ammunition; and indeed, as my
story is a whole collection of wonders, it affected him
deeply; but when he reflected from thence upon himself, and how I seemed to have been preserved
there on purpose to save his life, the tears ran down
his face, and he could not speak a word more.
After this communication was at an end, I carried
him and his two men into my apartment, leading
them in just where I came out, viz. at the top of the
house, where I refreshed them with such provisions as
I had, and showed them all the contrivances I had
made during my long inhabiting this place.
All I showed them, all I said to them, was perfectly
amazing; but, above all, the captain admired my
fortification, and how perfectly I had concealed my
retreat with a grove of trees, which having been now
planted near twenty years, and the trees growing
much faster than in England, was become a little
wood, and so thick that it was impassable in any
part of it but at that one side where I had reserved
my little winding passage into it. This I told him
was my castle, and my residence, but that I had a
seat in the country, as most princes have. whither I could retreat upon occasion, and I would show him
that too another time; but at present our business
was to consider how to recover the ship. He agreed
with me as to that; but told me he was perfectly at
a loss what measures to take, for that there were
still six-and-twenty hands on board, who, having
entered into a cursed conspiracy, by which they
had all forfeited their lives to the law, would be
hardened in it now by desperation, and would
carry it on, knowing that if they were reduced they
should be brought to the gallows as soon as they
came to England, or to any of the English colonies,
and that therefore there would be no attacking them
with so small a number as we were.
I mused for some time upon what he had said, and
found it was a very rational conclusion; and it
occurred to me, that, in a little while, the ship's
crew, wondering what was become of their comrades,
and of the boat, would certainly come on shore in
their other boat, to see for them, and that then, per-
haps, thev might come armed, and be too strong for
us: this,he allowed, was rational.
Upon this, I told him the first thing we had to do
was to stave the boat, which lay upon the beach, so
that they might not carry her off; and taking every
thing out of her, leave her so far useless as not to be
fit to swim. Accordingly we went on board, took
the arms which were left on board out of her, and
whatever else we found there, which was a bottle of
brandy^ and another of rum, a few biscuit cakes, a
horn ot powder, and a great lump of sugar, in a piece
of canvas; the sugar was five or six pounds: all
which was very welcome to me, especially the brandy
and sugar, of which I had been without many years.
When we had carried all these things on shore, we
knocked a great hole in her bottom, that if they had
come strong enough to master us, yet they could not
carry off the boat.
Indeed, it was not much in my thoughts that we
could be capable to recover the ship; but my view
was, that if they went away without the boat, I did
not much question to make her fit again to carry us
away to the Leeward Islands, and call upon our
. friends the Spaniards in my way.
While we were thus preparing our designs, and
had first, by main strength, heaved the boat up upon
the beach, so high that the tide would not float her
off at high-water mark; and, besides, had broken a
hole in her bottom too big to be quickly stopped, and
were sat down musing what we should do, we
heard the ship fire a gun, and saw her make a waft
with her ancient as a signal for the boat to come on
board; but no boat stirred, and they fired several
times, making other signals for the boat.
At last, when all their signals and firings proved
fruitless, and they found the boat did not stir, we
saw them (by the help of my glasses) hoist another
boat off, and row towards the shore; and we found,
as they approached, that there were no less than ten
men in her, and that they had fire-arms with them.
As the ship lay almost two leagues from the shore,
we had a full view of them as they came. The cap-
tain knew the persons and characters of all the men.
in the boat, of whom he said that there were three
very honest fellows, who, he was sure, were led into
this conspiracy by the rest, being overpowered and
frightened; but that as for the boatswain, who, it
seems, was the chief officer among them, and all the
rest, they were as outrageous as any of the ship's
crew, and were, no doubt, made desperate in their
new enterprise.
We had, upon the first appearance of the boat's
coming from the ship, considered of separating out
prisoners, and had indeed secured them effectually.
Two of them, of whom the captain was less assured
than ordinary, I sent with Friday, and one of the
three delivered men, to my cave, where they were remote enough, and out of danger of being heard or
discovered, or of finding their way out of the woods.
They left them bound, but gave them provisions,
and promised them, if they continued there quietly,
to give them their liberty m a day or two; but that
if they attempted their escape, they should be put to
death without mercy. They promised faithfully to
bear their confinement with patience.
The other prisoners had better usage; two of them
were kept pinioned indeed, because the captain did
not like to trust them, but the other two were taken
into my service, upon their captain's recommenda-
tion, and upon their solemnly engaging to live and
die with us.
As soon as they got to the place where their other
boat lay, they ran their boat into the beach, and
came all on shore, hauling the boat up after them,
which I was glad to see; for I was afraid they would
rather have left the boat at anchor, some distance
from the shore, with some hands in her to guard her,
and so we should not be able to seize the boat.
Being on shore, they ran all to the other boat;
and it was easy to see they were under a great sur-
prise to find her stripped, and a great hole in the
bottom. After this, they set up a great shout; but
it was all to no purpose: then they came all close in
a ring, and fired a volley of their small arms, which
indeed we heard, and the echoes made the woods
ring, but it was all one; those in the cave we were
sure could not hear, and those in our keeping, though
they heard it well enough, yet durst give no answer
to them.
They were so surprised at this, as they told us
afterwards, that they resolved to go all on board again
to their ship, and let them know there that the men
were all murdered, and the longboat staved: accord-
ingly, they immediately launched their boat again,
and got all of them on board.
The captain was terribly amazed, and even con-
founded at this, believing they would go on board
the ship again, and set sail, giving their comrades
up for lost, and so he should still lose the ship, which
he was in hopes we should have recovered, but he was quickly as much frightened the other way.
They had not been long put off with the boat, but
we perceived them all coming on shore again; and
they left three men in the boat, and the rest went up
into the country to look for their fellows. This was
a great disappointment to us, for now we were at a
loss what to do; for our seizing those seven men on
shore would be no advantage to us if we let the boat
escape, because they would then row away to the
ship, and then the rest of them would be sure to
weigh, and set sail, and so our hope of recovering the
ship would be lost. However, we had no remedy but
to wait and see what the issue of things might pre-
sent. The seven men came on shore, and the three
who remained in the boat put her off to a good dis-
tance from the shore, and came to an anchor to wait
for them, so that it was impossible for us to come at
them in the boat.
Those that came on shore kept close together,
marching towards the top of the little hill, under
which my habitation lay, and we could see them
plainly, though they could not perceive us. And
when they were come to the brow of the hill, where
they could see a great way into the valleys and
woods which lay towards the north-east part, and
where the island lay lowest, they shouted till they
were weary, and then they sat down to consider of
it. Had they gone to sleep there, as the other party
did, they had done for us; but they were too
full of apprehensions of danger to venture to go to
sleep, though they could not tell what the danger was.
The captain made a very just proposal to me upon
this consultation of theirs, viz. that perhaps they
would all fire a volley again, to endeavour to make
their fellows hear, and that we should all sally upon
them just at the juncture when their pieces were all
discharged, and they would certainly yield, and we
should nave them without bloodshed. I liked the
proposal, provided it was done while we were near
enough to come up to them before they could load
their pieces again.
But this event did not happen, and we lay still
a long time, very irresolute what course to take: at
length I told them there would be nothing to be done
in my opinion, till night: and then, if they did not
return to the boat, perhaps we might use some stra»
tagem with them in the boat to get them on shore.
We waited a great while, and were very uneasy;
when, we saw them all start up, and march towards
the sea. It seems they had such dreadful apprehen-
sions upon them of the danger of the place, that they
resolved to go on board the ship again, give their
companions over for lost, and so go on their intended
voyage with the ship.
As soon as I perceived them go towards the shore,
I imagined that they had given over their search,
and were for going back again; and the captain was
ready to sink when I told him my thoughts, but I
presently thought of a stratagem to fetch them back
again, and which answered my end to a tittle.
I ordered Friday and the captain's mate, to go over
the little creek westward, towards the place where
Friday was rescued, and at about half a mile distance,
I bade them halloo as loud as they could, and as
soon as they heard the seamen answer them, they
should return it again, and then keeping out of sight,
take a round, and then wheel about again to me by
such ways as I directed.
They were just going into the boat, when Friday
and the mate hallooed, and they presently heard
them, and answering, run along the shore westward,
towards the voice they heard, when they were stop-
ped by the creek, the water being up, they could not
get over, and called for the boat to come and set
them over, as indeed I expected.
When they had set themselves over, I observed
that they took one of the three men out of her, and
left only two in the boat, having fastened her to a
stump of a little tree on the shore.
This was what I wished for; and immediately leav-
ing Friday and the captain's mate to their business,
I took the rest with me, and crossing the creek out
of their sight, we surprised the two men before they
were aware, one of them lying on the shore between
sleeping and waking, and going to start up, the cap-
tain who was foremost, ran in upon him and knocked
him down, and then called to him in the boat to
yield or he was a dead man.
There needed very few arguments to persuade a
single man to yield, when he saw five men upon him,
and his comrade knocked down: besides, this was, it
seems one of the three men who were not so hearty
in the mutiny as the rest of the crew, and therefore
was easily persuaded not only to yield, but after-
wards to join very sincerely with us.
In the mean time, Friday and the captain's mate
so well managed their business with the rest, that
they drew them, by hallooing and answering, from
one wood to another, till they not only heartily tired
them, but left them where they were very sure they
could not reach back before it was dark: and in-
deed they were heartily tired themselves also by
the time they came back to us.
It was several hours after Friday came back to me
before they came back to their boat; and we could
hear the foremost of them, long before they came
quite up, calling to those behind to come along, and
could hear them answer, and complain how lame and
tired they were, and not able to;come any faster,
which was very welcome news to us.
At length they came up to the boat; but it is im-
possible to express their confusion when they found
the boat fast aground in the creek, and their two
men gone; we could hear them telling one another
they were gotten into an enchanted island; that
either there were inhabitants in it, and they should
all be murdered, or else there were devils or spirits
in it, and they should be carried away and devoured.
They hallooed again, and called their two comrades
by their names but got no answer. After some time,
we could see them by the little light there was, run
about like men in despair; and that sometimes
they would go and sit down in the boat to rest them-
selves, then come on shore again, and walk about,
and so the same thing over again.
My men would have fallen upon them in the dark,
but I was willing to spare them, and kill as few of
them as I could; being unwilling to hazard the kill-
ing any of our men, knowing the others were well
armed. I resolved to wait and make sure of them, and
drew my ambuscade nearer, and ordered Friday and
the captain to creep upon their hands and knees, and
get as near them as they possibly could, before they
offered to fire.
They had not been long in that posture, when the
boatswain, who was the principal ringleader,and had
now shown himself the most dispirited of all the rest,
walked towards them with two more of their crew.
The captain was so eager, at having the principal
rogue so much in his power, that he could hardly
have patience to let him come so near as to be sure
of him, for he only heard his tongue before; but
when they came nearer, the captain and Friday,
starting up on their feet let fly at them.
The boatswain was killed on the spot, the next
man was shot through the body, and fell just by him,
though he did not die till an hour or two after, and
the third ran for it.
At the noise of the fire, I immediately advanced
with my whole army, which was now eight men, viz.
myself, generalissimo ; Friday, my lieutenant general;
the captain, and his two men, and the three prisoners
of war, whom we had trusted with arms.
We came upon them indeed in the dark, so that
they could not see our number; and I made the man
they had left in the boat, who was now one of us, to
call them by name, to try if he could bring them to
parley, which fell out just as we desired. So he calls
out, as loud as he could to one of them, "Tom
Smith! Tom Smith!" Tom Smith answered im-
mediately, "Who's that Robinson!" for it seems he
knew his voice. The other answered, "Aye, aye;
for God's sake, Tom Smith throw down your arms,
and yield, or you are all dead men this moment!"
"Who must we yield to?—Where are they?" says
Tom Smith again. "Here they are," says he. "Here
is our captain, and fifty men with him, have been
hunting you this two hours. The boatswain is killed,
Will Frye is wounded, and I am a prisoner; if you
do not yield, you are all lost."
"Will they give us quarter then," says Tom Smith,
"and we will yield."—" I'll go and ask, if you pro-
mise to yield," says Robinson. So he asked the
captain, and the captain himself then called out,
"You, Smith, you know my voice; if you lay down
your arms immediately, and submit. you shall all
have your lives, all but Will Atkins."'
Upon this, Will Atkins cried out, "For God's
sake, captain, give me quarter! What have I done?
They have all been as bad as I!" which was not true,
for it seems this Will Atkins was the first man that
laid hold of the captain when they first mutinied.
However, the captain told him he must lay down his
arms at discretion, and trust to the governor's mercy,
by which he meant me, for they called me governor.
In a word, they all laid down their arms, and
begged their lives; and I sent the man that had
parleyed with them, and two more, who bound them
all; and then my great army of fifty men, which
particularly with those three, were all but eight,
came up and seized upon them all, and upon their
boat, only that I kept myself and one more out of
sight, for reasons of state.
Our next work was to repair the boat, and to think of seizing the ship; and as for the captain, now he
had leisure to parley with them, he expostulated
with them upon the villainy of their practices with
him, and how certainly it must bring them to misery
and distress in the end, and perhaps to the gallows.
They all appeared very penitent, and begged hard
for their lives. As for that he told them that the
governor was an Englishman; and that he might
hang them all there if he pleased; but, as he had
given them quarter, he supposed he would send them
to England, except Atkins, whom he was commanded
by the governor to advise to prepare for death, for
that he would be hanged in the morning. Though
this was all a fiction of his own, yet it had the de-
sired effect; Atkins fell upon his knees to beg the
captain to intercede with the governor for his life;
and all the rest begged of him, for God's sake not to
be sent to England.
It now occurred to me that the time of our deli-
verance was come, and that it would be a most easy
thing to bring these fellows in, to be hearty in getting
possession of the ship. So I retired in the dark from
them, that they might not see what kind of a gover-
nor they had, and called the captain to me. When
I called, as at a good distance, one of the men was
ordered to speak again, and say to the captain,
"Captain, the commander calls for you;" and pre-
sently the captain replied, "Tell his excellency I am just a-coming." So they all believed the com-
mander was just by, with his fifty men.
Upon the captain's coming to me, I told him my
project for seizing the ship, which pleased him, and
resolved to put it in execution the next morning.
But in order to execute it with more art, and to be
sure of success, I told him we must divide the pri-
soners, and that he should go and take Atkins and
two more of the worst of them, and send them bound
to the cave where the others lay. So Friday, and
the two men who came on shore with the captain,
conveyed them to the cave as to a prison. The other
I ordered to my bower, where they were pinioned,
and left secure enough.
To these, in the morning I sent the captain, who
was to enter into a .parley with them ; in a word, to
try them, and tell me whether he thought they might
be trusted or no, to go on board and surprise the ship.
He talked to them of the injury done him, of the
condition they were brought to, and that though
the governor had given them quarter for their lives,
as to the present action, yet that if they were sent to
England, they would all be hanged in chains; but
that if they would join in so just an attempt as to
recover the ship, he would have the governor's en-
gagement for their pardon.
Any one may guess how readily such a proposal
would be accepted by men in their condition; they
fell down on their knees to the captain, and promised,
with deep imprecations, that they would be faith-
ful to him to the last drop, and that they should owe
their lives to him, and would go with him all over
the world; that they would own him for a father to
them as long as they lived. "Well," says the cap-
tain, " I must go and tell the governor what you say,
and see what I can do to bring him to consent to it."
So he brought me an account of the temper he found
them in, and that he verily believed they would be
faithful. However, that we might be very secure,
I told him he should go back again, and choose out
five of them, and tell them that they should see that
they did not want men, but he would take out those
five to be his assistants, and that the governor would
keep the other two, and the three that were sent
prisoners to the castle (my cave,) as hostages for the
fidelity of those five; and if they proved unfaithful in
the execution, the five hostages should be hanged in
chains alive upon the shore.
This looked severe, and convinced them that the
governor was in earnest. However, they had no
way left them but to accept it; and it was now the
business of the prisoners, as much as of the captain,
to persuade the other five to do'their duty. Our
strength was now thus ordered for the expedition:—
First, the captain, his mate, and passenger. Second,
then the two prisoners of the first gang, to whom,
having their characters from the captain, I had
given their liberty, and trusted them with arms.
Third, the other two, whom I had kept in my bower
till now pinioned, were now released. Fourth, these
five released, at last; so that there were twelve in
all, besides five we kept in the cave, as hostages for
the fidelity of the others.
I asked the captain if he was willing to venture
with those hands on board the ship; for as for me
and my man Friday, I did not think it proper for us
to stir, having seven men left behind; and it was
employment enough for us to keep them asunder,
and supply them with victuals.
As to the five in the cave, I resolved to keep them fast; but Friday went twice a-day to them, to sup-
ply them with necessaries; and I made the other
two carry provisions to a certain distance, where
Friday was to take it.
When I showed myself to the two hostages, it was
with the captain, who told them I was the person the
governor had ordered to look after them, and that it
was the governor's pleasure they should not stir any
where, but by my direction; that if they did, they
should be fetched to the castle and be laid in irons;
so that we never suffered them to see me as governor,
so now I appeared as another person, and spoke
of the governor, the garrison, the castle, and the
like, upon all occasions.
The captain now had no difficulty before him, but
to furnish his two boats, stop the breach of one^ and
man them. he made his passenger captain of one.
with four other men: and himself, and his mate, and
five more, went in the other. And they contrived
their business very well; for they came up to the ship
about midnight. As soon as they came within call
of the ship, ne made Robinson hail them, and tell
them he had brought off the men and the boat, but that it was a long time before they had found them,
and the like; holding them in chat, till they came
to the ship's side; when the captain and the mate,
entering first with their arms, immediately knocked
down the second mate and the carpenter with the
butt-end of their muskets, being very faithfully
seconded by their men. They secured all the rest
that were upon the main and quarter-decks, and be-
gan to fasten the hatches to keep them down who
were below, when the other boat, and their men
entering at the fore-chains, secured the forecastle of
the ship, and the scuttle which went down into the
cook-room, making three men they found there pri-
soners. When this was done, and all safe upon the
deck, the captain ordered the mate, with three men.
to break into the round-house, where the new rebel
captain lay, and he having taken the alarm, was
gotten up, and with two men and a boy, had gotten
fire-arms in their hands; and when the mate, with a
crew, split open the door, the new captain and his
men fired boldly among them, and wounded the
mate with a musket-ball, which broke his arm, and
wounded two more of the men, but killed nobody.
The mate calling for help, rushed, however, into
the round-house, wounded as he was, and, with his
pistol, shot the new captain through the head, the
bullet entering at his mouth, and came out again
behind one of his ears, so that he never spoke a word;
upon which the rest yielded, and the ship was taken
effectually, without any more lives lost. As soon as
the ship was thus secured, the captain ordered seven
guns to be fired, which was the signal agreed upon
with me, to give me notice of his success, which, you
may be sure, I was glad to hear, having sat watching
upon the shore for it till two o'clock-in the morning.
Having heard the signal plainly, I laid me down,
and being very much fatigued, I fell sound asleep,
when shortly I was awoke by the noise of a gun; and
starting up, I heard a man call me by the name of
"Governor," and presently I knew the captain's
voice, when climbing up to the top of the hill, there
he stood, and pointing to the ship, he embraced me
in his arms. "My dear friend and deliverer," says
he, " there's your ship; for she is all yours, and so
are we, and all that belongs to her." I cast my eyes
to the ship, and there she rode, about half a mile off
the shore, for they had weighed her anchor as soon
as they were masters of her, and the weather being
fair, had brought her to an anchor just against the
mouth of a little creek, and the tide being up, they
had brought the pinnace in near the place where I first landed my rafts, and so landed just at my door.
I was, at first, ready to sink down with surprise,
for I saw my deliverance indeed visibly put into my
hands, all things easy, and a large ship just ready to
carry me away whither I pleased to go. He per-
ceived my situation, and immediately pulls a bottle
out of his pocket, and gave me a dram of cordial,
which he had brought on purpose for me. After I
drank it, I sat down upon the ground, and it was a
good while before I could speak to him.
After some time, I came to myself, and then I em-
braced him in my turn, as my deliverer, and we re-
joiced together. I told him, I looked upon him as a
man sent from heaven to deliver me, and that the
whole transaction seemed to be a chain of wonders;
that such things as these were the testimonies we
had of a secret hand of Providence governing the
world, and an evidence that the eyes of an infinite
Power could search into the remotest corner of the
world, and send help to the miserable whenever he
pleased: and I forgot not to return thanks to God
for all his mercies.
When we had talked a while, the captain told me
he had brought me some little refreshment, such as
the ship afforded, and such as the wretches, who had
been so long his masters, had not plundered him of.
Upon this he called aloud to his men, and told them
to bring the things ashore that were for the governor:
and, indeed, it was a splendid present. First, he had
brought me a case of bottles full of cordial waters,
six large bottles of Madeira wine, two pounds of ex-
cellent tobacco, twelve good pieces of the ship's beef,
and six pieces of pork, with a bagof pease, and about
a hundred weight of tobacco. He brought me also
a box of sugar, a box of flour, a bag full of lemons,
and two bottles of lime juice, and abundance of other
things. But, besides these, and what was a thousand
times more useful to me, he brought me six clean new
shirts, six very good neckcloths, two pair of gloves,
one pair of shoes, a hat, and one pair of stockings, and a very good suit of clothes of his own, which had
been worn very little; but the clothes felt very
awkward and uneasy upon me at first.
After all these things were brought into my little
apartment. we began to consult what was to be done
with the prisoners we had, and whether we might
venture to take them away with us or no, especially
two of them, whom we knew to be incorrigible and
refractory to the last degree, and the captain said he
knew that they were such rogues, that there was no
obliging them; and if he did carry them away, it
must be in irons, as malefactors, to be delivered over
to justice, at the first English colony he could come
at. Upon this I told him, I durst undertake to bring
the two men he spoke of to make it their own request
that he should leave them upon the island, of which
the captain said he should be very glad. 1 accord-
ingly sent for them, and entered seriously into dis-
course with them upon their circumstances. One of
them answered in the name of the rest, that they had
nothing to say but this, that when they were taken,
the captain promised them their lives, and they hum-
bly implored my mercy. But I told them 1 knew
not what mercy to show them ; for, as for myself, I
had resolved to quit the island with all my men, and
had taken passage with the captain to go to England;
and as for the captain, he would not carry them to
England, but as prisoners in irons, to be tried for
mutiny and running away with the ship; the conse-
quence of which, they must needs know. would be the
gallows: so that I could not tell which was best for
them, unless they had a mind to take their fate in
the island; if they desired that, I did not care, as I
had liberty to leave it. I had some inclination to
give them their lives, if they could shift on shore.
They seemed very thankful for it; and said they
would rather venture to stay there, than to be carried
to England to be hanged.
I then told them, I would let them into the story
of my living there, and put them into the way of
making it easy to them. Accordingly I gave them
the whole history of the place, and of my coming to
it; showed them my fortifications, the way I made
my bread, planted my corn, cured my grapes, and,
R 2
in a word, all that was necessary to make them easy.
I told them the story of the Spaniards that were to
be expected, for whom I left a letter, and made them
promise to treat them in common with themselves.
I left them five muskets, three fowling-pieces, and
three swords. I had about a barrel and a half of
powder, which I left them. I gave them a descrip-
tion of the way I managed the goats, and directions
to milk and fatten them, to make both butter and
cheese. In a word, I gave them every part of my
own story; and I told them I would prevail with the
captain to leave them two barrels of gunpowder more, and some garden seeds, which I told them I would have been very glad of; also I gave them the
bag of pease which the captain had brought me, and
bade them to be sure to sow and increase them.
Having done all this, I left them the next day, and
went on board the ship. The next morning two of
the five men came swimming to the ship's side, and
making a most lamentable complaint of the other
three, begged to be taken into the ship, for God's
sake, for they should be murdered.
The captain pretended to have no power without
me : but, after some difficulty, and after their solemn
promises of amendment, they were taken on board,
and were shortly after soundly whipped, after which
they proved very honest and quiet fellows.
Some time after this, I went with the boat on shore,
the tide being up, with the things promised to the
men, with which the captain, at my interceasion. sent
their chests and clothes, which they took, and were
very thankful for. I also encouraged them, by telling
them that if it lay in my way to send any vessel to
take them in, I would not forget them.
When I quitted this island, I carried on board, for
relics, the great goat-skin cap I had made, my um-
brella, and one of my parrots; also I forgot not to
take the money I had had laid by me so long useless.
And thus I left the island, the 10th of December,
by the chip's account, in the year Ifi86, after I had
been upon it twenty-eight years, two months, and
nineteen days; being delivered from the second cap-
tivity the same day of the month that I made my
escape from among the Moors at Sallee.
In this vessel, after a long voyage, I arrived in
England, the llth of June, m the year 1687, having
been thirty-five years absent.
When I came to England, I was as perfect a
stranger as if I had never been known there. My
benefactor and faithful steward, whom I left in trust
with my money, was alive, but had had great mis-
fortunes in the world, was become a widow the second
time, and was in very low circumstances. I made her
easy as to what she owed me, assuring her I would
give her no trouble: butj on the contrary, in gratitude
to her former care and faithfulness to me, I relieved
her as much as my little stock would afford, which
at that time, would indeed allow me to do but little
for her; but I assured her I would never forget her
former kindness to me: nor did I forget her, when I
had sufficient to help her, at a future time.
I went down afterwards into Yorkshire; but my
father was dead, and my mother, and all the family
extinct, except two sisters, and two of the children-
of one of my brothers; and as I had been long ago
given over for dead, there had been no provision made
for me, so that, in a word, I found nothing to relieve
or assist me, and the little money I had would not
do much for me, as to settling in the world.
I met with one piece of gratitude, indeed, which I did not expect; and this was, that the master of the
ship, whom I had so happily delivered, having given
a very handsome account to the owners of the man-
ner how I had saved the lives of the men and the
ship, they invited me to meet them, and some other
merchants concerned, and all together made me a
very handsome compliment upon the subject, and a
present of almost two hundred pounds sterling.
But, after making several reflections upon the cir-
cumstances of my life, and how little way this would
go towards settling me in the world, I resolved to go
to Lisbon, and see if I could get any information of
the state of my plantation in the Brazils, and of what
was become of my partner, who. I supposed, had for
some years now given me over for dead.
With this view, I took shipping for Lisbon, where
I arrived in April following: my man Friday accom-
panying me very honestly in all these ramblings, and
proving a most faithful servant upon all occasions.
When I came to Lisbon, I found out by inquiry, and
to my particular satisfaction, my old friend, the cap-
tain of the ship, who first took me up at sea, off the
shore of Africa. He was now grown old, ai;d had
left off the sea, having put his son into the ship, and
who still used the Brazil trade. The old man did not
know me, and I scarcely knew him; but he soon
recollected me, when I told him who I was.
After some passionate expressions of our old ac-
quaintance, I enquired after my plantation and my
partner. The old man told me he had not been in
the Brazils for about nine years; but that he could
assure me, that when he came away my partner was
living, but that the trustees, whom I had joined with
him to take cognizance of my part, were both dead;
that, however, he believed that I should have a very
good account of the improvement of the plantation,
for that, in the general belief of my being cast away
and drowned, my trustees had given in the account
of the produce of my part of the plantation to the
procurator fiscal, who had appropriated it, in case I
never came to claim it, one-third to the king, and
two-thirds to the monastery of St. Augustine, to be
expended for the benefit of the poor, and for the con-
version of the Indians to the Catholic faith; but that
if I appeared, or any one for me, to claim the inhe-
ritance, it would be restored; only that the improve-
ment, or annual production, being, a he said, dis-
trlhuted to charitable uses, he thought could not be restored.
I was a little concerned and uneasy at this account,
and inquired of the old captain how it came to pass that the trustees should thus dispose of my effects,
when they knew that I had made my will, and made
him, the Portuguese captain, my universal heir, &c.
He told me that was true, but as there was no proof
of my being dead, he could not act as executor, until
some certain account should come of my death; and
that, besides, he was not willing to intermeddle with
a thing so remote: that it was true, he had registered
my will, and put in his claim, and could he have
given any account of my being dead or alive, he would
have acted by procuration, and taken possession of
my ingenio (the sugar-house,) and given his son, who
was now in the Brazils, orders to do it.
The old man then asked me if he should put me in
a method to make my claim to my plantation. I
told him I thought to go over to it myself. He said
I might do so if I pleased; but that if I did not,
there were ways enough to secure my right, and im-
mediately to appropriate the profits to my use; and
as there were ships in the river of Lisbon just ready
to go to the Brazils, he made me enter my name in
a public register, with his affidavit, affirming, upon
oath, that I was alive, and that I was the same per-
son who took up the land for planting the said plan-
tation at first. This being regularly attested by a
notary, and a procuration affixed, he directed me to
send it, with a letter of his writing, to a merchant of
his acquaintance at the place, and then proposed my
staying with him till an account came of the return.
Never any thing was more honourable than the
proceedings upon this procuration; for in less than
seven months I received a large packet from the
survivors of my trustees, the merchants for whose
account I went to sea; and as the Brazils ships come
all in fleets, the same ships which brought my letters brought my goods, and the effects were safe in the
Tagus before the letters came to my hands. By
these, it appeared I was now master, all on a sudden,
of above five thousand pounds sterling in money, and
had an estate, as I might well call it, in the Brazils,
of above a thousand pounds a year, as sure as an
estate of lands in England; and, in a word, I was in
a condition which I scarce knew how to understand,
or how to compose myself for the enjoyment of.
The first thing I did was to recompense my original
benefactor, my"gpod old captain, who had been first
charitable to me in my distress, kind to me in the
beginning, and honest to me at the end. I showed
him all that was sent me. Itold him that, next to
the providence of Heaven, which disposes all things,
it was owing to him; and that it now lay on me to
reward him. So I sent for a notary, and caused him
to draw a procuration, empowering him to be my re-
ceiver of the annual profits of my plantation, and
appointing my partner to account to him, and make
the returns by the usual fleets to him, in my name.
And a clause in the end, being a grant of one hundred
moidorcs a year to him, during his life, out of the
effects; and fifty moidores a year to his son after
him, for his life: and thus I requited my old man.
I was now to consider which way to steer my
course next, and what to do with the estate that Pro-
vidence had thus put into my hands; and, indeed, I
had more care upon my head now, than I had in my
silent state of life on the island, where I wanted
nothing but what I had, and had nothing but what I
wanted; whereas I had now a great charge upon me,
and my business was how to secure my money. I
knew no where to put it, or whom to trust with it;
my old patron the captain, indeed, was honest, and
- that was the only refuge I had. In the next place,
my interest in the Brazils seemed to summon me
thither; but now I could not tell how to think of
going thither till I had settled my affairs. At first, I
thought of my old friend the widow, who I knew was
honest, and would be just to me; but then she was
in years, and but poor, and, for aught I knew, might
be in debt; so that, in a word, I had no way but to go
back to England myself, and take my effects with me. I was some months, however, before I resolved
upon this; and therefore as I had rewarded the old
captain fully, and to his satisfaction, who had been
my former benefactor, so I began to think of my poor
widow, whose husband had been my first benefactor,
and she, while it was in her power, my faithful stew-
ard and instructor. So the first thing I did, I got a
merchant in Lisbon to write to his correspondent in
London, not only to pay a bill, but to go find her out,
and carry her in money a hundred pounds from me, and to talk with her and comfort her in her poverty,
by telling her she should, if I lived, have a further supply. At the same time, I sent my two sisters in
the country, each of them a hundred pounds, they
being, though not in want, yet not in very good cir-
cumstances, one having been married, and left a
widow, and the other having a husband, not so kind
to her as he should be. But among all my relations
or acquaintances, I could not yet pitch upon one to
whom I durst commit the gross of my stock.
I had once a mind to have gone to the Brazils, and
have settled myself there, for I was, as it were, natu-
ralized to the place, but that I really did not know
with whom to leave my effects behind me; so I
resolved at last to go to England with them, where,
if I arrived, I concluded I should make some acquaint-
ance, or find some relations that would be faithful to
me, and accordingly I prepared to go for England
with all my wealth. Having settled my affairs, sold
my cargo, and turned all my effects into good bills
of exchange, my next difficulty was which way to go
to England. I had been accustomed enough to the
sea, and yet I had a strange aversion I o go to England
by sea at that time; and though I could give no
reason for it, yet the difficulty increased upon me BO
much, that though I had once shipped my baggage
in order to go, yet I altered my mind, and that not
once, but two or three times.
1 t is true I had been very unfortunate by sea, and
this might be one of the reasons: but let no man
strike the strong impulses of his own thoughts in
cases of such moment. Two ships, each of which
I had engaged to go in, but again withdrew my
agreement, miscarried, viz. one was taken by the
Algerines, and the other was cast away on the Start, near Torbay, and all the peopledrowned, except three;
so that in either of those vessels I had been made
miserable, and in which most, it was hard to say.
Having been thus harrassed in my thoughts, my old pilot, to whom I communicated every thing, pressed
me earnestly not to go by sea; but either to go by
land to the 'Groyne, and cross over the Bay of Biscay
to Rochelle, from whence it was but an easy and safe
journey by land to Paris, and so to Calais and Dover;
or go up to Madrid, and so all the way by land
through France. In a word, I was so prepossessed
against my going by sea at all, except from Calais to
Dover, that I resolved to travel all the way by land,
which, as I was not in haste, and did not value the
charge, was by much the pleasanter way; and to
make it more so, my old captain brought an English
gentleman, the son of a merchant in Lisbon, who was
willing to travel with me; after which we picked up
two more, who were English, and merchants also,
and two young Portuguese gentlemen, the last going
to Paris only, so that we were in all six of us, and
five servants; the two merchants, and the two Por-
tuguese, contenting themselves with one servant be-
tween two, to save the charge; and as for me, I got
an English sailor to travel with me as a servant, be-
sides my man Friday, who was too much a stranger
to be capable of supplying the place of a servant upon
the road.
111 this manner we set out from Lisbon; and our
company being all very well mounted and armed, we
made a little troop, whereof they did me the honour
to call me captain, as well because I was the oldest
man, as because I had two servants, and indeed was
the original of the whole journey.
When we came to Madrid, we, being all of us
strangers to Spain, were willing to stay some time
to see the court of Spain, and to see what was worth
observing; but it being the latter part of the summer,
we hastened away, and set out from Madrid about
the middle of October. But when we came to the
edge of Navarre, we were alarmed at several towns
on the way, with an account that so much snow was
fallen on the French side of the mountains, that seve-
ral travellers were obliged to come back to Pampe-
luna, after having attempted to pass on.
When we came to Pampeluna itself, we found it so
indeed; and to me, that had been always used to a hot
climate, and indeed to countries where we could
scarce bear any clothes on, the cold was insufferable.
Nor indeed was it more painful than it was surprising,
to come but ten days before out of Old Castile, where
the weather was not only warm, but very hot, and
immediately to feel a wind from the Pyrenean moun-
tains, so severely cold, as to be intolerable, and to
endanger benumbing and perishing of our fingers and
toes. Poor Friday was really frightened when he
saw the mountains covered with snow, and felt cold
weather, which he had never seen or felt before in
his life.
To mend the matter, after we came to Pampeluna,
it continued snowing with so much violence, and so
long, that the people said winter was come before its
time, and the roads, which were difficult before, were
now quite impassable; and the snow not being hard
frozen, as is the case in the northern countries, there
was no going without being in danger of being buried
alive every step. We stayed no less than twenty
days at Pampeluna, when I proposed that we should
all go away to Fontarabia, and there take shipping
for Bordeaux, which was a very little voyage.
But while we were considering this, there came in
four French gentlemen, who, having been stopped
on the French side of the passes as we were on the
Spanish, had found out a guide, who traversing the
country near the head of Languedoc, had brought
them over the mountains by such ways, that they
were not much incommoded with the snow: and
where they met with snow in any quantity, they said
it was frozen hard enough to bear them and their horses.
We sent for this guide, who told us he would un-
dertake to carry us the same way, with no hazard
from the snow provided we were armed sufficiently
to protect us from wild beasts; for he said, upon
these great snows it was frequent for some wolves to
show themselves at the foot of the mountains, being
made ravenous for want of food, the ground being covered with snow. We told him we were well
enough prepared for such creatures as they were, if
he would ensure us from a kind of two-legged wolves,
which we were told we were in most danger from,
especially on the French side of the mountains.
He satisfied us there was no danger of that kind in
the way that we were to go. So we readily agreed
to follow him, as did also twelve other gentlemen,
with their servants, some French, some Spanish, who,
as I said, had attempted to go, and were obliged to
come back again.
Accordingly we all set out from Pampeluna. with
our guide, on the 15th of November; and indeed I
was surprised, when, instead of going forward, he
came directly back with us, on the same road that
we came from Madrid, above twenty miles; when
having passed two rivers, and come into the plain
country, we found ourselves in a warm climate again,
where the country was pleasant, and no snow was to
be seen; but on a sudden, turning to the left, he
approached the mountains another way; and though,
it is true, the hills and the precipices looked dread-
ful, yet he made so many tours, such meanders, and
led us by such winding ways, we were insensibly
passed the height of the mountains without being
much encumbered with the snow; and, all on a sud-
den, he showed us the pleasant fruitful provinces of
Languedoc and Gascoigne, all green and flourishing,
though indeed they were at a great distance, and we
had some rough way to pass yet.
We were a little uneasy, however, when we found
it snowed one whole day, and at night so fast that
we could not travel; but he bade us be easy, we
should soon be past it all. We found, indeed, that
we began to descend every day, and to come more
north than before; and so, depending upon our guide,
we went on.
It was about two hours before night, when our
guide being something before us, and not just in sight,
out rushed three monstrous wolves, and after them a
bear, out of a hollow way, adjoining to a thick wood.
Two of the wolves flew upon the guide, and had he
been half a mile before us, he had been devoured
indeed, before we could have helped him. One of
them fastened upon his horse, and the other attacked
the man with that violonee, that he had not time, or
not presence of mind enough to draw his pistol, but
hallooed and cried out to us most lustily. My man
Friday being next to me, I bade him ride up, and see
what was the matter. As soon as Friday came in
sight of the man, he hallooed as loud as the other,
"O master! O master!" bat, like a bold fellow, rode
directly up to the man, and, with a pistol, shot the
wolf that attacked him into the head.
It was happy for the poor man that it was my man
Friday; for he, having been used to that kind of
creature in his country, had no fear upon him, but
went up close to him, and shot him as above: whereas
any of us would have fired at a farther distance, and
have, perhaps, either missed the wolf, or endangered
shooting the man.
But it was enough to have terrified a bolder man
than I ; and indeed it alarmed all our company,
when, with the noise of Friday's pistol, we heard on
both sides the most dismal howling of wolves, and
the noise redoubled by the echo of the mountains,
and it was to us as if there had been a prodigious
multitude of them; and perhaps, indeed, there were
not such afew, as that we had no cause of apprehension.
However, as Friday had killed this wolf, the other,
that had fastened upon the horse, left him immedi-
ately, and fled, having happily fastened upon his
head, where the bosses of the bridle had stuck in his
teeth, so that he had not done him much hurt. The
man, indeed, was most hurt; for the raging creature
had bit him twice, once on the arm, and the other
time a little above his knee; and he was just, as it
were, tumbling down by the disorder of his horse,
when Friday came up and shot the wolf.
It is easy to suppose, that at the noise of Friday's
pistol we all mended our pace, and rode up as fast as
the way (which was very difficult) would give us
leave, to see what was the matter. As soon as we
came clear of the trees, which blinded us before, we
saw plainly what had been the case, ai:d how Friday
had disengaged the poor guide, though we did not
presently discern what kind of creature it was he had
killed.
My man Friday had delivered our guide, and when
we came up to him he was helping him off from his
horse, for the man was both hurt and frightened, and
indeed the last more than the first, when on a sudden
we spied the bear come out of the wood, and a vast
monstrous one it was, the biggest by far that ever I
saw. We were all a little surprised when we saw
him; but when Friday saw him, it was easy to see
joy and courage in the fellow's countenance. "O!
O! O I" says Friday, three times, pointing to him;
"O, master! you give me te leave, me slmkee te
hand with him, me makee you good laugh."
I was surprised to see the fellow so pleased. "You
fool, you," said I, " he will eat you up!"—" Eatee me
up! eatee me up!" says Friday, twice over again.
"Me eatee him up: me show you good laugh. So
down he sits, and gets his boots off in a moment, and
put on a pair of pumps, which he had in his pocket,
gives my other servant his horse, and with his gun
away he went, swift like the wind.
The bear was walking softly on, and offered to
meddle with nobody, till Friday, coming pretty near,
calls to him, as if the bear could understand him,
"Hark ye, hark ye," says Friday, "me speakee wit
you." We followed at a distance, for now being
come down to the Gascoigne side of the mountains,
we entered a vast great forest, where the country
was plain, and pretty open, though many trees in it
scattered here and there.
Friday, who had, as we say. the heels of the bear,
came up with him quickly, and takes up a great
stone and throws it at him, and hit him just on the
head, but did him no more harm than if he had
thrown it against a wall; but it answered Friday's
cud, for the rogue was so void of fear that he did it
purely to make the bear follow him, and "show us
some laugh," as he called it.
As soon as the bear felt the stone, and saw him, he
turns about, aud comes after him, taking very long
strides, and shuffling along at a strange rate, so as
would put a horse to a middling gallop. Away runs
Friday, and takes his course, as if he ran towards us
for help; so we all resolved to fire at once upon the
bear, and deliver my man, though I was angry at
him heartily for bringing the bear back upon us,
when he was going about his own business another
way; and especially I was angry that he had turned
the bear upon us, and then run away; and I called
out, "You dog," said 1, "is this your making use laugh? Come away, and take your horse, that we
may shoot the creature." He hears me, and cries
out, " No shoot, no shoot! Stand still: you get much laugh." And as the nimble creature ran two feet for
the beast's one, he turned, on a sudden, on one side
of us, and seeing a great oak tree, fit for his purpose,
he beckoned us to follow, and doubling his pace, he
gets nimbly up the tree, laying his gun down upon
the ground, at about five or six yards from the bottom
of the tree.
The bear soon came to the tree, and we followed at
a distance. The first thing he did, he stopped at the
gun, smelt at it, but let it lie, and up he scrambles
into the tree, climbing like a cat, though so mon-
strously heavy. I was amazed at the folly, as I thought it, of my man, and could not for my life see
any thing to laugh at yet, till, seeing the bear get
up the tree, we all rode nearer to him.
When we came to the tree, there was Friday got
out to the small end of a large limb of the tree, and
the bear got about half way to him; as soon as the
bear got out to that part where the limb of the tree
was weaker, " Ha," says he, to us, "now you see me
teachee the bear dance;" so he falls a jumping, and
shaking the bough, at which the bear began to totter,
and stood to look behind him, to see how he should
get back; then, indeed, we did laugh heartily. But
Friday had not done with him by a great deal: when
he sees him stand still. he calls out to him again, as
if he had supposed the bear could speak English,
"What, you no come farther? Pray you come far-
ther." So he left jumping and shaking the bough,
and the bear, just as if he had understood what he
said, did come a little farther: then he fell a jumping
again, and the bear stopped again.
We thought now was a good time to knock him on
the head, and I called to"Friday to stand still and
we would shoot the bear; but he cried out earnestly,
"O pray! O pray! no shoot! Me shoot by and
then." He would have said, "By and by." How-
ever, to shorten the story, Friday danced so much,
and the bear stood so ticklish, that we had laughing
enough indeed, but still could not imagine what the
fellow would do; for first we thought he depended
upon shaking the bear off, and we found the bear was
too cunning for that too, for he would not go out far
enough to be thrown down, but clings fast with his
great broad claws and feet, so that we could not
imagine what would be the end of it, and where the
jest would be at last.
But Friday put us out of doubt shortly, for seeing
the bear cling fast to the bough, and that he would
not come any farther, "Well, well," says Friday,
"you no come farther, me go, me go; you no come
to me, me come to you." And upon this he goes out
to the smallest end of the bough, where it would bend
with his weight, and gently lets himself down by it,
sliding down the bough, till he came near enough to
jump down on his feet, and away he ran to his gun,
takes it up, and stands still.
"Well/' said I to him, " Friday, what will you do
now? Why don't you shoot him ?"—" No shoot,"
says Friday, " no yet, me shoot now, me no kill; me
stay, give you one more laugh." And so he did; for
when the bear saw his enemy gone, he comes back
from the bough where he stood, but did it mighty
leisurely, looking behind him every step, and coming
backward till he got into the body of the tree. Then
with the same hinder end foremost, he came down
the tree, grasping it with his claws, and moving one
foot at a time very leisurely: at this juncture, and
just before he could set his hind feet upon the ground,
Friday stepped close to him, clapped the muzzle of
his piece into his ear, and shot him dead as a stone.
Then the rogue turned about, to see if we did not
laugh; and when he saw we were pleased by our
looks, he falls a laughing himself very loud. "So w«
kill bear in my country," says Friday. "So you kill
s
them!" said I , "why you have no guns."—" No,"
says he,"no gun; but shoot great, much, long arrow."
This was, indeed, a good diversion to us, but we
were still in a wild place, and our guide very much
hurt, and what to do we hardly knew; the howling
of wolves ran much in my head; and indeed, except
the noise I once heard on the shores of Africa, of
which I have said something already, I never heard
any thing that filled me with so much horror.
These things, and the approach of night, called us
off, or else, as Friday would have had us, we should
certainly have taken the skin of this monstrous
creature off, which was worth saving; but we had
three leagues to go, and our guide hastened us: so
we left him, and went forward on our journey.
We had one dangerous place to pass, of which our
guide told us, if there were any more wolves in the
country we should find them there; and this was a
small plain, surrounded with woods on every side,
and a long, narrow defile, or lane, which we were to
pass, to get through the wood, and then we should
come to a village where we were to lodge.
It was within half an hour of sunset when we en-
tered the first wood; and a little after sunset, we
came into the plain. We met with nothing in the
first wood, except that, in a little plain, within the
wood, which was not above two furlongs over, we saw
five great wolves cross the road, full speed, one after
another, a? if they had been in chase of some prey,
and had it in view. They took no notice of us, and
were gone, and out of our sight in a few moments.
Upon this, our guide, who, by the way, was a
wretched faint-hearted fellow, bade us keep in a
ready posture, for he believed there were more wolves
a-coming.
We kept our arms ready, and our eyes about us,
but we saw no more wolves till we came through
that wood, which was near half a league, and entered
the plain. As soon as we came into the plain, we
had occasion enough to look about us. The first
object we met with was a dead horse; that is to say,
a poor horse, which the wolves had killed, and at
least a dozen of them at work, we could not say eating
of him, but picking his bones rather, for they had
eaten up all the flesh before. We did not think fit
to disturb them at their feast, neither did they take
much notice of us. Friday would have let fly at
them, but I would not suffer him by any means, for
I found we were like to have more business upon our
hands than we were aware of. We were not gone
half over the plain, but we began to hear the wolves
howl, in the wood on our left, in a dreadful manner;
and, presently after we saw about a hundred coming
on directly towards us, all in a body, and most of
them in a line, as regular as an army drawn up by
experienced officers. I scarce knew m what manner
to receive them; but found to draw ourselves in a
close line was the only way. So we formed in a mo-
ment. But that we might not have too much interval,
I ordered that only every other man should fire, and
that the others, who had not fired, should be ready
to give them a second volley immediately, if they
continued to advance upon us; and that then those
who had fired at first should not pretend to load their
fusils again, but stand ready with every one a pistol,
for we were all armed with a fusil and a pair of pis-
tols each man; so we were by this method, able to
fire six volleys, half of us at a time. However, at
present, we had no necessity, for, upon firing the first
volley, the enemy made a full stop, being terrified as
well with the noise as with the fire: four of them
being shot into the head, dropped; several others
were wounded, and went bleeding off, as we could
see by the snow. I found they stopped, but did not
immediately retreat, whereupon, remembering that
I had been told, that the fiercest creatures were ter-
rified at the voice of a man, I caused all our com-
pany to halloo as loud as we could : and I found the
8 2
notion not altogether mistaken; for, upon our shout,
they began to retire, and turn about; then I ordered
a second volley to be fired in their rear, which put
them to the gallop, and away they went to the woods.
This gave us leisure to charge our pieces again, and
that we might lose no time, we kept going; but we
had little more than loaded our fusils, and put our-
selves into readiness, when we heard a terrible noise
in the same wood on our left.
The night was coming on, and the light began to
be dusky, which made it the worse on our side; but
the noise increasing, we could easily perceive that it
was the howling of those ravenous creatures; and,
on a sudden, we perceived two or three troops of
wolves, one on our left, one behind us, and one in our
front, and we knew not what course to take; but the
creatures resolved us soon, for they gathered about
us, in hopes of prey; and I verily believe there were
three hundred of them. It happened, very much to
our advantage, that at the entrance into the wood,
there lay some large timber trees, cut down, and I drew my little troop in among these trees, and placing
ourselves in a line, behind one long tree, I advised
them all to alight, and, keeping that tree before us,
for a breastwork, to stand in a triangle or three fronts,
enclosing our horses in the centre. We did so; ana
it was well we did, for never was a more furious
charge than the creatures made upon us in this place:
they came on us with a growling kind of noise, and
mounted the piece of timber, as if they were only
rushing upon their prey; and this fury of theirs, it
seems, was principally occasioned by their seeing
our horses behind us, which was the prey they aimed
at. I ordered our men to fire as before, every other
man, and they took their aim so sure, that they killed
several wolves at the first volley; but there was a
necessity to keep a continual firing, for they came on
like devils, those behind pushing on those before.
When we had fired the second volley of our fu&Us,
we thought they stopped a little, and I hoped they
would have gone off, but it was but a moment, for
others came forward again, so we fired two volleys
of our pistols, and, I believe, in these four firings we
killed seventeen or eighteen of them, and lamed
twice as many; yet they came on again.
I was loath to spend our last shot too hastily; so
I called my servant, not Friday, but my other man,
and, giving him a horn of powder, I bade him lay a
train all along the piece of timber, and let it be a
large train. He did so, and had but just time to get
away, when the wolves came up to it, and some were
got upon it, when 1, -snapping an uncharged pistol
close to the powder, set it on fire. Those that were
upon the timber were scorched with it, and six or
seven of them felf, or rather jumped, in among us,
with the force and fright of the fire. We despatched
these in an instant, and the rest were so frightened
with the light, that they drew back a little.
Upon which I ordered our last pistols to be fired
off in one volley, and after that we gave a shout:
upon this the wolves turned tail, and we sallied im-
mediately upon near twenty lame ones, whose dread-
ful crying and howling scared the rest, so that they
all fled, and left us.
We had, first and last, killed about threescore of
them, and had it been daylight, we had killed many
more. The field of battle being thus cleared, we
made forward again, for we had still near a league
to go. We heard the ravenous creatures howl and
yell in the woods as we went, several times; and
sometimes we fancied we saw some of them, but the
snow dazzling our eyes, we were not certain; so in
about an hour more, we came to the town where we
were to lodge, which we found in a terrible fright,
and all in arms; for it seems that, the night before,
the wolves and some bears had broke into the village,
to attack the cattle, and even the people.
The next morning our guide was so ill, and his limbs so swelled with the rankling of his two wounds, that he could go no farther, so we were obliged to
take another guide there, and go toThoulouse, where
we found a warm climate, a fruitful, pleasant coun-
try, and no snow, no wolves, or any thing like them.
I have nothing uncommon to take notice of in my
passage through France; nothing but what other
travellers have given an account of, with much more
advantage than I can. I travelled from Thoulouse
to Paris, and, without any considerable stay, came
to Calais, and landed safe at Dover, the 14th of Janu-
ary, after having had a severe cold season to travel in.
I was now come to the centre of my travels, and
had, in a little time, all T i\ new-discovered estate
safe about me; the bills of exchange which I had
brought with me having been currently paid. My
principal guide and privy-counsellor was my good,
old widow, who, in gratitude for the money I had
sent her, thought no pains too much, or care too
great, to employ for me.
I began to think of leaving my effects with this
woman, and setting out for Lisbon, and so to the
Brazils. But now another scruple came in my way,
and that was religion; for as I had entertained some
doubts about the Roman religion, even while I was
abroad, especially in my state of solitude, so I knew
there was no going to the Brazils for me, much less
going to settle there, unless I resolved to embrace
the Catholic religion, without]any reserve; except,
on the other hand, I resolved to be a sacrifice to my
principles, be a martyr for religion, and die in the
Inquisition; so I resolved to stay at home, and if I could find means, to dispose of my plantation.
To this purpose! wrote to my old friend at Lisbon,
who, in return, gave me notice that he could easily
dispose of it there; but that, if I thought fit to give
him leave to offer it in my name to'the two merchants,
the survivors of my trustees, who lived in the Brazils,
who must fully understand the value of it, who lived
just upon the spot, and whom I knew to be very
rich, so that he believed they would be fond of buying
it, he did not doubt, but I "should make four or five
thousand pieces of eight the more for it.
Accordingly I agreed, gave him orders to offer it
to them, and he did so; and in about eight months
more, the ships being then returned, he sent me an
account, that they had accepted the offer, and had
remitted thirty-three thousand pieces of eight to a
correspondent of theirs at Lisbon to pay for it.
In return, I signed the instrument of sale in the
form which they sent from Lisbon, and sent it to my
old man, who sent me bills of exchange for thirty-
two thousand eight hundred pieces of eight for the
estate, reserving the payment of one hundred moidores
a year to him, the old man, during his life, and fifty
moidores afterwards to his son for his life, which I
had promised them, and which the plantation was to
make good as a rent charge. And thus I have given
the first part of a life of fortune and adventure, a life
of Providence's checker-work, and of a variety which
the world will seldom be able to show the like of.
Beginning foolishly, but closing much more happily
than I had ever any reason even to hope for.
Any one would think that, in this state of compli-
cated good fortune, I was past running any more
hazards; but I was inured to a wandering life, had
no family, nor many relations, nor, however rich, had
I contracted much acquaintance; and though I had
sold my estate in the Brazils, yet I could not keep
that country out of my head, and had a great mind
to be upon the wing again, especially I could not re-
sist the strong inclination I had to see my island.
My true friend, the widow, earnestly dissuaded me
from it, and so far prevailed with me, that for almost
seven years she prevented my running abroad; du-
ring which time I took my two nephews, the children
of one of my brothers, into my care. The eldest,
having something of his own, I bred up as a gentle-
his estate after my decease; the other I put out to
a captain of a ship, and after five years, finding him
a sensible, bold, enterprising young fellow, I put him
into a good ship, and sent him to sea. And this
young fellow afterwards drew me in, old as I was, to
farther adventures myself.r
In the mean time, I in part settled myself here:
for, first of all, I married, and had three children,
two sons and one daughter. But my wife dying,
and my nephew coming home, with good success,
from a voyage to Spain, my inclination to go abroad,
and his importunity, prevailed, and I engaged to go
in his ship as a private trader to the East Indies. In
this voyage, I visited my new colony in the island,
saw my successors, the Spaniards; had the whole
story of their coming to, and adventures in the
island, after my departure. All these things, with
some very surprising incidents, in some new adven-
tures of my own, for ten years more, I may, perhaps,
give a farther account of hereafter.
FARTHER ADVENTURES
ov
ROBINSON CRUSOE.
THAT homely proverb, used on so many occasions
in England, viz. that" What is bred in the bone will
not go out of the flesh," was never more verified than
in the story of my life. Any one would think that
after thirty-five years affliction, and a variety of
other circumstances, which few men, if any, ever
went through before. and after near seven years of
enjoyment in the fullness of all things, grown old,
and when, if ever, it might be allowed me to have
had experience of every state of middle life, and to
which was best adapted to make a man completely
happy: I say, after all this, any one would have
thought that the native propensitiy to rambling,
which I gave an account of, in my first setting out
into the world, to have been so predominant in my
thoughts, should be worn out, the volatile part be
fully evacuated, or at least condensed, and I might,
at sixty-one years of age, have been a little inclined
to stay at home, and have done venturing life and
fortune any more. Nay, farther, the common motive
of foreign adventures was taken away in me, for I
had no fortune to make; I had already sufficient for
me, and those I had to leave it to.
Yet all these things had no effect upon me, or at
least not enough to resist the strong inclination I had to go abroad again, which hung about me like a
chronicle distemper; particularly the desire of seeing
my new plantation in the island, and the colony I left
there, run in my head continually. I dreamed of it
all night, and my imagination ran upon it all day: it
was uppermost in my thoughts, and I talked of
it in my sleep. One time, I dreamed that the vil-
lany of the three pirate sailors was related to me, by
the first Spaniard, and Friday's father. They told
me how they barbourously attempted to murder all
the Spaniards, and that they set fire to the provi-
sions they had laid up, on purpose to distress and
starve them; things that I had never heard of, and
that indeed never were all of them true. And it was
so warm in my imagination, and so realized to me,
that, to the hour I saw them, I could not be per-
suaded but that it was, or would be true; also how
I resented it, when the Spaniards complained to
me; and how I brought them to justice, tried them
before me, and ordered them all three to be hanged.
In this kind of temper 1 had lived some years. I
had no enjoyment, no agreeable diversion, but what
had something or other of this in it, so that my wife,
who saw my mind so wholly bent upon it, told me
very seriously one night, that she believed there was
some secret, powerful impulse of providence upon
me, which had determined me to go thither again;
and that she found nothing hindered my going, but
my being engaged to a wife and children. She told
me, it was true she could not think of parting with
me, but she was assured, that if she was dead it
would be the first thing I should do, so it seemed to
her, that if the thing was determined above, she
would not be the only obstruction. For if I thought
fit, and resolved to go—(here she found me very
intent upon her words, so that it a little disordered
her, and she stopped). I asked her why she did not
go on, and say what she was going to say. But I
perceived that her heart was too full, and some tears
stood in her eyes. "Speak out, my dear," said 1,
"are you willing I should go?"—liNo," says she,
very affectionately, "I am far from willing. " But if
you are resolved to go," says she, " and, rather than
1 will be the only hindrance, I will go with you: for
though I think it a preposterous thing for one of
your years, and in your condition, yet if it must be,"
said she again, weeping, " I won't leave you: for if it
be of heaven, you must do it, there is no resisting it,
and if heaven makes it your duty to go, it will be
also mine to go with you, or otherwise dispose of me,
that I may not obstruct it."
The affectionate behaviour of my wife brought me
a little out of the vapours, and I began to consider
what I was doing. I corrected my wandering fancy,
and began to argue with myself sedately what busi-
ness I had, after threescore years, and after such a
life of tedious sufferings and disasters, and closed in
so happy and easy a manner; I say, what business
had I to rush into any hazards, and put myself upon
adventures, fit only for youth and poverty to run
into?
With these thoughts, I bought a little farm in the
county of Bedford, and removed thither. I had a
little convenient house upon it, and the land about it
I found was capable of improvement. I farmed my
own land ; I had no rent to pay, and what I im-
proved was for my own family. Now I thought,
indeed, that I enjoyed that middle state of life, which
my father so earnestly recommended to me; a coun-
try life :—
Free from vice, free from care;
Age ha» no pain, and youth no snare.
But in the middle of all this felicity, one blow
from unseen providence unhinged me at once, and not
only made a breach upon me inevitable and incura-
ble," but drove me by its consequence, into a deep
relapse of the wandering disposition, which, as I may
say, being born in my very blood, soon recovered its
hold of me, and, like the returns of a violent distem-
per, came with more impression upon me. This
blow was the loss of my wife.
It is not my business here to write an elegy upon
my wife, to give a character of her particular virtues,
and make a funeral sermon. She was in a few
words, the stay of all my affairs, the centre of all my
enterprises; the engine, that by her prudence re-
duced me to that happy compass I was in, from the
most extravagant and ruinous project, that fluttered
in my head: and did more to guide my rambling
genius, than a mother's tears, a father's instructions,
a friend's counsel, and all my own reasoning powers
could do. I was happy in listening to her entreaties,
and being moved by her tears, and to the last degree
desolate by her loss. I was like a ship without a
pilot, that could only run " afore the wind." My head
was quite turned with the whimsies of foreign adven-
tures, and all the pleasing amusement of my farm,
and my family, which before entirely possessed me,
were nothing to me; in a word, I resolved to leave
off housekeeping, let my farm, and return to London;
and in a few months after I did so.
It was now the beginning of the year 1093, when
my nephew, whom I had brought up to sea, and had
made him commander of a ship, was come home
from a short voyage to Bilboa, being the first he had
made. He came and told me, that some merchants
of his acquaintance had been proposing to him to go
a voyage for them to the East Indies and China, as
private traders. "And now uncle," says he, " if you
will go to sea with me, I'll engage to land you upon
your old habitation in the island, for we are to touch
at the Brazils." In a word the scheme hit so ex-
actly with my temper, that I told him, that if he
agreed with the merchants, I would go with him.
But I would not promise to go any further than my
own island. "Why, sir," says he, " you don't want
to be left there again I hope ?"—" Why," said I, "can
you not take me up again in your return?" He told
me, that it would not be possible to do so; that the
merchants would never allow him to come that way
with a loaded ship of such value, it being a month s
sail out of his way, and might be three or four.
"Besides, sir, if I should miscarry," said he, "and
not return at all, then you would be just reduced to
the condition you were in before."
This was very rational; 'but we both found out
a remedy for it, which was to carry a framed sloop
on board the ship, which being taken in pieces, and
shipped on board the ship, might, by the help of some
carpenters, be set up again in the island, and finished
fit to go to sea in a few days.
In order to this, I made my will, and settled the
estate I had in such a manner for my children, and
placed it in such hands, that I was perfectly easy,
and satisfied they would have justice done them,
whatever might befall me; and as for their educa-
tion, 1 left 11 wholly to my old friend the widow,
with a sufficient maintenance to herself for her care.
My nephew was ready to sail about the beginning
of January, 1694, and 1, with my man Friday, went
on board, in the Downs, the 8th, having a very con-
siderable cargo of all kinds of necessary things for
my colony, which, if Idid not find in good condition,
I resolved to leave so. First, I carried with me
some servants, whom I purposed to place there as
inhabitants, or at least, to set on work there upon
my own account while I stayed; and either to leave
them there, or carry them forward, as they should
appear willing: particularly, I carried two carpen-
ters, a smith, and a very handy, ingenious fellow,
who was a cooper by trade, but was also a general
mechanic; for he was dextrous at making wheels
and hand-mills to grind corn; was a good turner,
and a good pot-maker. With these I carried a tailor,
who had offered himself to go passenger to the East
Indies with my nephew, but afterwards consented to
stay on our new plantation, and proved a most ne-
cessary, handy fellow, as could be desired, in many
other businesses besides that of his trade.
My cargo consisted of a sufficient quantity of
linen, and some thin English stuffs for clothing the
Spaniards that I expected to find there: and enough
of them as by my calculation might comfortably
supply them for seven years. If I remember right,
the materials which I carried for clothing them, with
gloves, hats, shoes, stockings, and all such things as
they could want for wearing, amounted to above two
hundred pounds, including some beds, bedding, and
household stuff; particularly kitchen utensils, with
pots, kettles, pewter, brass, &c. besides near one
hundred pounds more in iron work, nails, tools of
every kind, staples, hooks, hinges, and every neces-
sary thing I could think of.
1 carried also a hundred spare arms, muskets, and
fnsils, besides some pistols, a considerable quantity
of shot of all sizes, three or four tons of lead, and
two pieces of brass cannon; I also carried a hundred
barrels of powder, besides swords and cutlasses, and
the iron part of some spikes and halberts; so that,
in short, we had a large magazine of all sorts of
stores; and I made my nephew carry two small
quarter-deck guns more than he wanted for. his ship,
to leave behind, if there was occasion, that, when we
came there, we might build a fort, and man it against
all sorts of enemies. And, indeed, I at first thought
there would be need enough for it all, and much
more, if we hoped to maintain our possession of the
island, as shall be plainly seen in the course of this
history.
We set out, and had a very fair gale of wind for
some time. As I remember, it might be about the
20th of February, late in the evening, when the mate
having the watch, came into the round-house, and
told us he saw a flash of fire, and heard a gun fire;
and while he was telling us of it, a boy came in and
told us the boatswain heard another. This made us
all run out upon the quarter-deck, where, for a while,
we heard nothing; but in a few minutes we saw a
very great light, and found there was some very
terrible fire at a distance. Immediately we had
recourse to our reckonings, in which we all agreed
that there could be no land in that way in which
the fire showed itself, no, not for five hundred leagues,
for it appeared at W.N.W. Upon this, we concluded
it must be some ship on fire at sea; and as, by our
hearing the noise of guns just before, we concluded
it could not be far off, we stood directly towards it,
and were presently satisfied we should discover it,
because the farther we sailed the greater the light
appeared, though, the weather being hazy, we could
not perceive any thing but the light for a while. In
about half an hour's sailing, wind being fair for
us, though not much of it, and the weather clearing
up a little, we could plainly discern that it was a
great ship on fire in the middle of the sea. I was
most sensibly touched with this disaster, though not
at all acquainted with the persons engaged in it. I
presently recollected my former circumstances, and
what condition I was in, when taken up by the Por-
tuguese captain ; and how much more deplorable the
circumstances of the poor creatures belonging to this
ship must be, if they had no other ship in company
with them. Upon this, I immediately ordered that
five guns should be fired, one soon after another,
that, if possible, we might give notice to them that
there was help for them at hand, and that they
might endeavour to save themselves in their boat:
for though we could see the flame of the ship, yet
they, it being night, and very dark, could see nothing
of us.
We lay by some time upon this, only driving as
the burning ship drove, waiting for daylight, when
on a sudden, to our great terror, though we expected
it, the ship blew up in the air, and in a few minutes
all the fire was out, that is to say, the rest of the
ship sunk. This was a terrible and afflicting sight,
for the sake of the poor men, who, I concluded, must
be either all destroyed in the ship, or be in the ut-
most distress in their boats, in the middle of the ocean,
which at present, by reason it was dark, I could not
see. However, to direct them as well as I could, I
caused lights to be hung out in all parts of the ship
where we could, and which we had lanterns for,
and kept firing guns all the night long, letting them
know by this that there was a ship not far off.
About eight o'clock in the morning we discovered
the ship's boats, by the help of our perspective glasses;
and found there were two of them, both thronged
with people, and deep in the water. We perceived
they rowed, the wind being against them; that they
saw our ship, and did their utmost to make us see
them. We immediately spread our ancient, to let
them know we saw them, and hung a waft out as a
signal for them to come on board, and then made
more sail, standing directly to them. In little more
than half an hour we came up with them, and took
them all in, being sixty-four, men, women, and chil-
dren, for there were a'great many passengers.
We found it was a French merchant ship, of three
hundred tons, homeward bound from Quebec. The
master gave us a long account of the distress of his
ship, how the fire began in the steerage by the neg-
ligence of the steersman, but, on his crying out for
help, was, as every body thought, entirely put out.
But they soon found that some sparks ofthe first
fire had gotten into some part of the ship so difficult
to come at, that they could not effectually quench
it; and afterwards getting in between the timbers,
and within the ceiling of the ship, it proceeded into
the hold, and mastered all the skill, and all the ap-
plication, they were able to exert. They had no more
to do then but to get into their boats, which, to their
great comfort, were pretty large, being their long
boat, and a great shallop, besides a small skiff, which
was of no great service to them, other than to get
some fresh water and provisions into her, after they
had secured themselves from the fire. They had in-
deed small hope of their lives by getting into these
boats at that distance from any land, only, as they
said well, that they were escaped from the fire, and
had a possibility that some ship might happen to be
at sea, and might take them in.
It is impossible for me to express the several ges-
tures, the strange ecstacies, the variety of posture,
which these poor delivered people run into, to express
the joy of their souls at so unexpected a deliverance.
Grief and fear are easily described; sighs, tears,
groans, and a very few motions of the head and hands,
make up the sum of its variety; but an excess of joy
and surprise, has a thousand extravagancies in it.
There were some in tears, some raging and tearing
themselves, as if they had been in the greatest agonies
of sorrow; some stark raving, and downright lunatic;
some ran about the ship stamping with their feet,
others wringing their hands; some were dancing,
some singing; some laughing, more crying; many
quite dumb, not able to speak a word; others sick
and vomiting; several swooning, and ready to faint;
and a few were crossing themselves, and giving God
thanks.
I would not wrong them neither; there might be
many that were thankful afterwards: but the pas-
sion was too strong for them at first, and they were
not able to master it; they were thrown into ecstacies,
and a kind of frenzy, and so there were very few
who were composed and serious in their joy.
T
There were two priests among them, one an old man,
and the other a young man ; and that which was
strangest was, that the oldest man was the worst.
As soon as he set his foot on board our ship, and
saw himself safe, he droped down stone dead to all
appearance; not the least sign of life could be seen
in him. Our surgeon immediately applied remedies
to recover him, and was the only man in the ship
that believed he was not dead; and at length he
opened a vein in his arm, from which in a short time
the blood flowed rather freely; in three minutes
after, the old man opened his eyes; and about a
quarter of an hour after that he spoke, grew better,
and in a little time quite well. After the blood was
stopped, he walked about, told us he was perfectly
well, took a dram of cordial which the surgeon gave
him, and was what we called "come to himself."
About a quarter of an hour after, they came running
into the cabin to the surgeon, who was bleeding a
French woman that had fainted, and told him the
priest had gone stark mad. It seems he had begun
to revolve the change of his circumstances in his
mind, and this put him into an ecstasy of joy ; his
spirits whirled about faster than the vessels could
convey them; the blood grew hot and feverish, and
the man was as fit for Bedlam as any creature that
ever was in it. The surgeon gave him something to
dose and put him to sleep, which, after some time,
operated upon him, and he waked next morning
perfectly composed and well.
The younger priest behaved himself with great
command of his passion, and was really an example
of a serious, well-governed mind. At his first coming on board the ship, he threw himself flat on his face,
prostrating himself in thankfulness for his deliver-
ance, in which I unhappily and unseasonably disturb-
ed him, really thinking he had been in a swoon; but
he spake calmly, thanked me, told me he was giving
God thanks for his deliverance, begged me to leave
him a few moments, and that, next to his Maker, he
would give me thanks also.
I was heartily sorry that I disturbed him; and not
only left him, but kept others from interrupting him
also. He continued in that posture about three
minutes, or a little more, after I left him; then came
to me, as he had said he would, and with a great
deal of seriousness and affection, but with tears in
his eyes, thanked me that had, under God, given
him, and so many miserable creatures, their lives.
I told him I had no room to move him to thank God
for it, rather than me, for I had seen that he had
done that already. But I added, that it was nothing:
but what reason and humanity dictated to all men,
and that we had as much reason as he to give thanks
to God, who had blessed us so far as to make us the
instruments of his mercy to so many of his creatures.
After this, the young" priest applied himself to his
country folks, laboured to compose them, persuaded,
entreated, argued, reasoned with them, and did his
utmost to keep them within the exercise of their
reason; and with some he had success, though others
were, for a time, out of all government of themselves.
I commit this to writing, as perhaps it may be
useful to those into whose hands it may fall, for the
guiding themselves in all the extravagancies of their
passions; for if an excess of joy can carry men out
to such a length beyond the reach of their reason,
what will not the extravagancies of anger, rage, and
a provoked mind carry us to?
The next day, when they had slept soundly, they
were quite another sort of people. Nothing of good
manners, or civil acknowledgments, for the kindness
shown to them, was wanting1: the French, it is well
known, are naturally apt to exceed that way. The
captain and one of the priests came to me shortly,
and, desiring to speak with me and my nephew,
the commander, began to consult with us what should
be done with them. And first they told BS that as
T 2
we had saved their lives, so all they had was little
enough for a return for the kindness received. The
captain said they had saved some money, and some
things of value, in their boats, catched hastily out of
the flames, and if we would accept it, they were
ordered to make an offer of it all to us; they only
desired to be set on shore somewhere on our way,
where, if possible, they might get passage to France.
I told the French captain that we had taken them
up in their distress, it was true; but that it was our
duty to do so, as we were fellow-creatures, and as we
would desire to be so delivered, if we were in the like,
or any other extremity; that we had done nothing
for them but what we believed they would have done
for us if we had been in their case, and they in ours;
but that we took them up to save them, not to plun-
der them; and that it would be a most barbarous
thing to take that little from them which they had
saved out of the fire, and then to set them on shore
and leave them; that this would be first to save
them from death, and then to kill them ourselves;
save them from drowning, and abandon them to
starving; and, therefore, I would not let the least
thing be taken from them. As to setting them on
shore, I told them, indeed, that was an exceeding
difficulty to us, for that the ship was bound to the
East Indies; and though we were driven oat of our
course to the westward a very great way, which,
perhaps, was directed by heaven on purpose for their
deliverance, yet it was impossible for us wilfully to
change our voyage, on this particular account; nor
could my nephew, the captain, answer it to the
freighters with whom he was under charterparty to
pursue his voyage by the way of Brazil: and all I
knew we could do for them was to put ourselves in
the way of meeting with other ships, homeward
bound from the West Indies, and get them passage,
if possible, to England or France. The first part of the proposal was so generous and
kind, they could not but be very thankful for it; but
they were in a great consternation, especially the pas-
sengers, at the notion of being carried away to the
East Indies. They then entreated me, that seeing I was driven so far to the westward before I met with
them, I would at least keep on the same course to
the banks of Newfoundland, where it was possible they
might meet with some ship or sloop, that they might
hire to carry them back to Canada, from whence
they came.
I thought this was but a reasonable request on
their part, and therefore consented, and in about a
week after we made the banks of Newfoundland,
where, to shorten my story, we put all our French
people on board a bark, which they hired to carry
them to France. When, I say all the French people,
I should remember that the young priest I spoke of.
hearing we were bound to the East Indies, desired
to go the voyage with us, and to be set on shore on
the coast of Coromandel. I readily agreed to that;
for 1 wonderfully liked the man, and had very good
reason, as will appear afterwards. Also, four of the
seamen entered themselves in our ship, and proved
very useful fellows.
From thence we directed our course for the West
Indies, steering away S. S. E. for about twenty days
together, sometimes little or no wind at all, when we
met with another subject for our humanity, almost
as deplorable as that before.
It was in the latitude of 27 degrees 5 minutes N.,
and the Iflth day of March, 1694, when we spied a
sail, our course was 8. E. S.. We soon perceived it
was a large vessel, and that she bore up to us, but
at first we could not tell what to make of her, till
coming a little nearer, we found she had lost her
main-topmast, foremast, and bolt-sprit, and presently
she fired a gun as a signal of distress. The weather
was pretty good, wind at N. N. W. a fresh gale, and
we soon came to speak with her.
We found her a ship of Bristol, bound home from
Barbadoes, but had been blown out of the road a few
days before she was ready to sail, by a terrible hur-
ricaue, while the captain and the chief mate were
both gone on shore, so that, by the terror of the
storm, they were but in an indifferent case for good
artists to bring the ship home. They had been
already nine weeks at sea, and had met with another
terrible storm, after the hurricane was over, which
had blown them quite out of their knowledge to the
westward, and in which they lost their masts as
above. They told us they expected to have seen the
Bahama Islands, but then were driven away again
to the south east by a strong gale of wind at N. N. W.
the same that blew now; and having no sails to work
the ship with, but a main-course, and a kind of
square sail, upon a jury fore-mast, which they had
set up, they could not lie near the wind, but were
endeavouring to stand away for the Canaries.
But what was the worst of all, they were almost
starved for want of provisions, besides the fatigues
they had undergone: their bread and flesh was quite
gone, they had not an ounce left in the ship, and had
had none for eleven days; the only relief they had
was, their water was not done, and they had about
half a barrel of flour left; they had sugar enough;
some succades, or sweetmeats, they had at first, but
they were devoured, and they had seven casks of rum.
There was a youth and his mother, and a maid-
servant, on board, who were going passengers, and,
thinking the ship was ready to sail, unhappily came
on board the evening before the hurricane began;
and having no provisions of their own, they were in
a more deplorable condition than the rest; for the
seamen, being reduced to such an extreme necessity
themselves, had no compassion, we may be sure, for
the poor passengers.
I had, perhaps not known this part, if my curiosity
had not led me, the weather being fair, and the wind
abated, to go on board the ship. The second mate,
who, upon this occasion, commanded the ship, had been on board our ship; and he told me, that they
had three passengers on board, and that they were
in a deplorable condition. "Nay," says he, "I be-
lieve they are dead, for I have heard nothing of them
for above two days ; and I was afraid to inquire
after them," said he, " for I had nothing to relieve
them with."
We immediately applied ourselves to give them
what relief we could spare. But now they were in a
new danger, for they were afraid of eating too much,
even of that little we gave them. The mate, or com-
mander, brought six men with him in his boat, but
these poor wretches looked like skeletons, and were
so weak that they could hardly sit to their oars.
The mate himself was very ill, and half starved, for
he declared he had reserved nothing from the men,
and went share and share alike with them in every
bit they eat.
I cautioned him to eat sparingly, and set meat
before him immediately, but he had: not eaten three
mouthsful before he began to be sick and put of order.
So he stopped awhile, and our surgeon mixed him up
something with some broth, which he said would be
to him both food and physic, and after he had taken
it he grew better. In the mean time, I forgot not the
men: I ordered victuals to be given them, and the
poor creatures rather devoured than eat it: and two
of them eat with so much greediness, that they were
in danger of their lives the next morning. All the
while the mate was relating to me the miserable con-
dition of the ship's company, I could not put out of
my thoughts the story he had told me of the three
poor creatures in the great cabin, viz. the mother.
her son, and the maid-servant, whom he had heard
nothing of for two or three days, and whom he seem-
ed to' confess they had wholly neglected, their own
extremities being so great; by which I understood,
that they had really given them no food at all, and
that therefore they must have perished, and be all
lying dead on the floor, or deck of the cabin.
As 1, therefore, kept the mate, whom we then
failed captain, on board with his men to refresh
them, so I also forgot not the starving crew that
were on board, but ordered my own boat to go on
board their ship, with my mate and twelve men, to
carry them a sack of bread, and four or five pieces of
beef to boil. Our surgeon charged the men to cause
the meat to be boiled while they stayed, and to keep
guard in the cook-room, to prevent the men's taking
it to eat raw, or taking it out of the pot before it
was well boiled, and then to give every man but a
little at a time; and, by this caution he preserved
the men, who would otherwise hayekilled themselves
with that very food which was given them on pur-
pose to save their lives.
At the same time, I ordered the mate to go into
the great cabin, and see what condition the poor pas-
sengers were in, and, if they were alive to comfort
them, and give them what refreshment was proper,
and the surgeon gave him a large pitcher, with some
of the prepared broth which ne had given to the
mate that was on board, and which he did not ques-
tion would restore them gradually.
I was not satisfied with this; but, as I said before,
having a great mind to see the scene of misery, which
I knew the ship itself would present me with, in a
more lively manner than I could have it by report, I
took the captain of the ship as we now called him,
with me, and went myself a little after in their boat.
I found the poor men almost in a tumult to get the
victuals out of the boiler before it was ready. How-
ever, we pacified them, and fed them gradually and
cautiously for the first time, and the next time we
gave them more, and at last filled their bellies, and
the men did well enough. But the misery of the
poor passengers in the cabin was of another nature,
and far beyond the rest. For as, first, the ship's
company had so little for themselves, it was but too
true, that they had at first kept them low, and at
last totally neglected them; so that for six or seven
days, it might be said, they had really had no food
at all, and, for several days before, very little. The
poor mother, who, as the mate reported, was a woman
of good sense, and good breeding, had spared all she
could get so affectionately for her son, that at last
she sunk under it. And when the mate of our ship
went in, she sat upon the floor, or deck, with her
back up against the sides, between two chairs, which
were lashed fast, and her head sunk in between her
shoulders, like a corpse, though not quite dead. My
mate said all he could to revive and encourage her,
and with a spoon put some broth into her mouth.
She opened her lips, and lifted up one hand, but
could not speak: yet she understood what he said,
and made signs to him, intimating that it was too
late for her, but pointed to her child, as if she would
have said, they should take care of him.
However, the mate, who was exceedingly moved
with the sight, endeavoured to get some of the broth
into her mouth; and, as he said, got two or three
spoonsful down, though I question whether he could
be sure of it or not. But it was too late, she died the
same night
The youth, who was preserved at the price of his
most affectionate mother's life, was not so far gone;
yet he lay in a cabin bed, as one stretched out, with
hardly any life left in him. He had a piece of an old
glove in his mouth, having eaten up the rest. How-
ever, being young, and having more strength than
his mother, the mate got something down his throat,
and he began sensibly to revive, though by giving
him, some time after, but two or three spoonsful ex-
traordinary, he was very sick, and brought it up
again.
But the next care was the poor maid. She lay all
along upon the deck, hard by her mistress, and (just like one that had fallen down with an apoplexy, and
struggled for life. Her limbs were distorted, one of
her hands was clasped round f.he frame of a chair,
and she griped it so hard, that we could not easily
make her let it go, her other arm lay over her head,
and her feet lay both together, set fast against the
frame of the cabin table; in short, she lay just like
one in the last agonies of death. The poor creature
was not only starved with hunger, and terrified with
the thoughts of death, but, as the men told us after-
wards, was broken-hearted for her mistress, whom
she saw dying for two or three days before, and whom
she loved most tenderly. We knew not what to do
with this poor girl; for when our surgeon, who was
a man of very great knowledge and experience, had,
with great application, recovered her, as to life, he
had her upon his hands, as to her senses, for she was
nearly distracted for a considerable time after.
Whoever shall read these memorandums, must
consider that visits at sea are not like journies into
the country, where sometimes people stay a week or
a fortnight at a place. Our business was to relieve
this distressed ship's crew, but not lie by for them;
and though they were willing to steer the same course
with us for some days, yet we could carry no sail to
keep pace with a ship that had no masts. However,
as their captain begged of us to help him to set up a
main-topmast, and a kind of topmast to his jury fore-
mast, we did, as it were, lie by him for three or four
days, and then, having given them five barrels of
beef, and a barrel of pork, two hogsheads of biscuits,
and a proportion of peas, flour, and what other things
we could spare, and taking three casks of sugar,
some rum, and some pieces of eight of them for satis-
faction, we left them, taking on board with us, at
their own earnest request, the youth, and the maid,
and all their goods. The young lad was about seven-r
teen years of age, a pretty, well-bred, modest, and
sensible youth, greatly dejected with the loss of his
mother; and, as it seems, had lost his father but a
few months before at Barbadoes.
I was now in the latitude of 19 degrees, 32 minutes,
and had hitherto had a tolerable voyage as to weather,
though at first the winds had been contrary. I shall
trouble nobody with the little incidents of wind,
weather, currents, &c, on the rest of our voyage, but,
shortening my story, for the sake of what is to follow,
shall observe, that I came to my old habitation, in
the island, on the 10th of April, 1694. It was with
no small difficulty that I found the place, for as I
came to it, and went from it before, on the south and
east side of the island, as coming from the Brazils,
so now coming in between the mainland and the
island, and having no chart for the coast, nor any
land-mark, I did not know it when I saw it, or know
whether I saw it or not.
We beat about a great while, and went on shore on
several islands, in the mouth of the great river
Oroonoque; and this I learned, by coasting the
shore, that I was under one great mistake before,
viz. that the continent, which I thought I saw from
the island I lived in, was really no continent, but a
long island, or rather a ridge of islands, reaching
from one to the other side of the extended mouth of
that great river, and that the savages who came to
my island were not properly those which we call
Caribbees, but islanders, and other barbarians of the
same kind, who inhabited something nearer to our
side than the rest. I visited several of these islands
to no purpose. At length I came fair on the south
side of my island, and I presently knew the very
countenance of the place. So I brought the ship
safe to an anchor, broadside with the little creek,
where my old habitation was.
As soon as I saw the place, I called for Friday,
and asked him if he knew where he was. He looked
about a little, and presently, clapping his hands,
cried, " O yes! O there! O yes! O there!" pointing
to our old habitation, and fell a dancing and capering
like a mad fellow, and I had much ado to keep him
from j jumping into the sea, to swim ashore to the place.
"Well, Friday," said I, "do you think we shall find
any body here or no? And what do you think, shall
we see your father?" The fellow stood mute as a
stock a good while; but when I named his father, the
poor affectionate creature looked dejected, and I could see the tears run down his face very plentifully.
"What is the matter, Friday?" said I, "are you
troubled because you may see your father ?"—" No,
no," says he, "no see him more, no, ever more see
again!"—" Why so," said I, "Friday, how do you
know that?"—"O no, no," says Friday, "he long
ago die, long ago, he much old man."—" Well, well,
said I, " Friday, you don't know. But shall we see
any one else then'?" The fellow, it seems, had better
eyes than I, and he points just to the hill above my
old house, and though we lay half a league off, he
cries out, " Me see! me see! yes, yes! me see much
men there, and there!" I looked, but I could see
nobody, no, not with a perspective glass, which was,
I suppose, because I could not hit the place, for the
fellow was right, as I found, upon enquiry, the next
day, and there were five or six men altogether stood
to look at the ship, not knowing what to think of us,
As soon as Friday had told me he saw people, I
caused the English ancient to be spread, and fired
three guns, to give them notice we were friends, and
about a quarter of an hour after we perceived a
smoke rise from the side of the creek. So I imme-
diately ordered a boat out, taking Friday with me,
and hanging out a white flag, or flag of truce, I went
directly on shore, taking with me the young friar I
mentioned before, to wnom I had told the whole
story of my living there, and the manner of it, and
every particular, both of myself, and those that I left
there, and who was, on that account, extremely de-
4-
sirous to go with me. We had, besides, about sixteen
men, very well armed, if we had found any new
guests there which we did not know of: but we had
no need of weapons.
As we went on shore upon the tide of flood, near
high water, we rowed directly into the creek, and
the first man I fixed my eye upon was the Spaniard,
whose life I had saved, and whom I 'knew by his
face perfectly well. I ordered nobody to go on
shore but myself, but there was no keeping Friday
in the boat, for the affectionate creature had spied
his father at a distance, and if they had not let him
go on shore, he would have jumped into the sea. He
was no sooner on shore, but he flew away to his
father, like an arrow out of a bow. i t would have
made any man shed tears, in spite of the firmest
resolution, to have seen the first transports of this poor fellow's joy when he came to his father; how
he embraced him, kissed him, stroked his face, took
him up in his arms, set him down upon a tree, and
lay down by him; then stood and looked at him, as
any one would look at a strange picture, for a quarter
of an hour together; then lay down upon the ground,
and stroked his legs, and kissed them, and then got
up again, and stared at him; one would have thought
the fellow bewitched; apd all the while he did this,
he would be talking to him, and telling him one
story or another of his travels, and of what had hap-
pened to him abroad, to divert him. In short, if the
same filial affection was to be found in Christians to
their parents in our parts of the world, one would be
tempted to say, there would hardly have been any
need of the Fifth Commandment.
But this is a digression: I return to my landing.
It would be endless to take notice of all the ceremo-
nies and civilities that the Spaniards received me
with. The first Spaniard, whom, as I said, I knew
very well, was he whose life I had saved; he came
towards the boat, attended by one more, carrying a
flag of trace also; and he not only did not know me
at first, but he had no thoughts, no notion, of its
being me that was come, till I said, "Seignior, do
you not know me?" At which he spoke not a word,
but giving his musket to the man that was with him,
threw his arms abroad, and, saying something in
Spanish that I did not perfectly hear, came forward
and embraced me, telling me he was inexcusable not
to know that face again, that he had once seen, as of
an angel from heaven sent to save his life. He said
abundance of very handsome things, as a well-bred
Spaniard always knows how; and then beckoning
to the person who attended him, bade him go and
call out his comrades. He then asked me, if I would
walk to my old habitation, where he would give me
possession of my own house again, and where I should
see there had been but mean improvements. So I
walked along with him; but, alas! I could no more
find the place again, than if I had never been there,
for they find planted so many trees, and placed them
in such a posture, so thick and close to one another,
and in ten years' time they were grown so big, that,
in short, the place was inaccessible, except by such
windings, and blind ways, as they themselves only
who made them could find.
I asked what put them upon all these fortifications.
He told me, I would say there was need enough of
it, when they had given me an account how they had
passed their time since their arriving in the island,
especially after they had the misfortune to find I was
gone. He told me, he could not but have some satis-
faction in my good fortune, when he heard that I was gone in a good ship; and that he had oftentimes
a strong persuasion, that one time or other he should
see me again.
While he was saying this, came the man whom he
had sent back, and with him eleven men more. In
the dress they were in, it was impossible to guess
what nation they were of; but he made all clear,
both to them and to me. First, he turned to me,
and pointing to them, said, "These, sir, are some of
the gentlemen who owe their lives to you;" and then
turning to them, and pointing to me, he let them
know who I was. Upon which, they all came up,
one by one, not as if they had been sailors, and
ordinary fellows, and I the like, but really as if they
had been ambassadors or noblemen, and I a monarch,
or a great conqueror.
The history of their coming to, and conduct in, the
island, after my going away, is so remarkable, and
has so many incidents which the former part of my
relation will help to understand, and which will, in
most of the particulars, refer to that account I have
already given, that I cannot but commit them to the
reading of those that come after me.
The first thing I did, was to desire that he would
give me a particular account of his voyage back to
his countrymen with the boat, when I sent him to
fetch them over. He told me there was little variety
in that part, for nothing remarkable happened to
them on the way, they having very calm weather,
and a smooth sea. For his countrymen, it would not
be doubted, he said, but that they were overjoyed to
see him. (Itseems, he was the principal man among
them, the captain of the vessel they had been ship-
wrecked in having been dead some time.) They
were, he said, the more surprised to see him, because
they knew that he was fallen into the hands of
savages, who, they were satisfied, would devour him,
as they did all the rest of their prisoners; that when
he told them the story of his deliverance, and in what
manner he was furnished for carrying them away, it
was, like a dream to them; and their astonishment,
they said, was something like that of Joseph's
brethren, when he told them who he was, and told
them the story of his exaltation in Pharaoh's court.
But when he showed them the arms, the powder, the
ball, and the provisions, that he brought them for
selves, took a just sharein the joy of their deliverance,
and immediately prepared to come away with him.
Their first business was to get canoes: and in this
they were obliged not to stick so much upon the
honest part of it, but to trespass upon their friendly
savages, and to borrow two large canoes, on pretence
of going out a fishing, or for pleasure.
In these they came away the next morning. It
seems they wanted no time to get themselves ready;
for they had no baggage, neither clothes, nor provi-
sions, nor anything in the world, but what they had on
them, and a few roots to eat, of which they used to
make their bread.
They were in all three weeks absent, and in that
time, unluckily for them, I had the occasion offered
for my escape, as I mentioned in my other part, and
and to get offfrom the island, leaving three of the
most impudent, hardened, ungoverned, disagreeable
villains behind me, that any man conld desire to
meet with.
The only just thing the rogues did, was, that when
the Spaniards came on shore they gave my letter to
them, and gave them provisions, and other relief, as
I had ordered them to do. Also they gave them the
long paper of directions, which I had left them, con-
taining the particular methods which I took for
managing every part of my life there, the way I
baked my bread, bred up my tame goats, and planted
my corn, how I cured my grapes, made my pots,
and, in a word, every thing I did. Nor did they
refuse to accommodate the Spaniards with any thing
else, for they agreed very well for some time; they
gave them an equal admission into the house, or cave,
and they began to live very sociably; and the head
Spaniard, who had seen pretty much of my methods,
and Friday's father together, managed all their
affairs; for, as for the Englishmen, they did nothing
but ramble about the island, shoot parrots, and catch
tortoises, and when they came home at night, the
Spaniards provided their suppers for them.
The Spaniards would have been satisfied with this,
would the others have but let them alone, which,
however, they could not find in their hearts to do
long, but, like the dog in the manger, they would
not eat themselves, and would not let others eat
neither. At last it broke out into open war, and it
began with all the rudeness and insolence that can
be imagined, without reason, without provocation,
contrary to nature, and, indeed, to common sense;
and though, it is true, the first relation of it came
from the Spaniards themselves, whom I may call the
accusers, yet when I came to examine the fellows,
they could not deny a word of it.
But before I come to the particulars of this part, I
must supply a defect in my former relation^ and this
was, that I forgot to set down among the rest, that,
just as we were weighing the anchor to set sail,
there happened a little quarrel on board our ship,
which I was afraid once would turn to a second
mutiny; nor was it appeased, till the captain, rousing
up his courage, and taking us all to his assistance,
parted them by force, and making two of the most
refractory fellows prisoners, he laid them in irons;
and as they had been active in the former disorders,
and let fall some ugly, dangerous words the second
time, he threatened to carry them in irons to England,
and have them hanged there for mutiny, and running
away with the ship. This, it seems, frightened some
other men in the ship; and some of them had put it
into the heads of the rest, that the captain only gave
them good words for the present, till they should
come to some English port, and that then they should
all be put into a gaol, and tried for their lives.
The mate got intelligence of this, and acquainted
us with it; upon which it was desired that I, who
still passed for a great man among them, should go
down with the mate and satisfy the men, and tell
u
them that they might be assured, if they behaved
well the rest of the voyage, all they had done for the
time past should be pardoned. So I went, and, after
passing " my honour's" word to them, they appeared
easy, and the more so when I caused the two men,
who were in irons, to be released and forgiven.
But this mutiny had brought us to an anchor for
that night, the .wind falling calm. Next morning we
found that our two men, who had been laid in irons,
had stole each of them a musket and some other
weapons; what powder or shot they had we knew
not; and had taken the ship's pinnace, which was
not yet hauled up, and run away with her to their
companions in roguery on shore.
As soon as we found this, I ordered the long boat
on shore, with twelve men and the mate, and away
they went to seek the rogues; but they could
neither find them nor any of the rest, for they all
fled into the woods when they saw the boat coming.
These two men made their number five; but the
other three villians were so much wickeder than
these, that, after they had been two or three days
together, they turned their new-comers out of doors
to shift for themselves, and would have nothing to
do with them, nor could they, for a good while, be
persuaded to give them any food; as for the Spani-
ards, they were not yet come.
When the Spaniards came first on shore, the
business began to go forward: the Spaniards would
have persuaded the three English brutes to have
taken in their two countrymen again, that, as they
said, they might be all one family, but they would
not hear of it. So the two poor fellows lived by
themselves, and, finding nothing but industry and
application would make them live comfortably, they
pitched their tents on the north shore of the island,
put a little more to the west, to be out of the danger
of the savages, who always landed on the east part
of the island.
Here they built them two huts, one to lodge in,
and the other to lay up their magazines and stores
in; and the Spaniards having given them some corn
for seed, and especially some of the peas, which I had
left them, they dug, and planted, and enclosed, after
the pattern I had set for them all, and began to live
pretty well.
They were going on in this little thriving posture,
when the three unnatural rogues, their own country-
men too, in mere humour, and to insult them, came
and bullied them, and told them the island was
theirs; that the governor, meaning me, had given
them possession of it, and nobody else had any right
to it: and, d—n them, they should build no houses
upon their ground, unless they would pay them rent
for them.
The two men thought they had jested at first, and asked them to come and sit down, and see what fine
houses they were that they had built, and tell them
what rent they demanded. And one of them merrily
told them, if they were ground landlords, he hoped,
if they built tenements upon the land, and made im-
provements, they would according to the custom of all
landlords, grant them a long lease, and bade them
go and fetch a scrivener to draw the writings. One
of the three, d—ning and raging, told them that they
should see they were not in jest; and going to a little
place at a distance, where the honest men had made
a fire to dress their victuals, he takes a firebrand,
and claps it to the outside of their hut, and fairly set
it on fire; and it would have been burnt down in a
few minutes, if one of the two had not run to the
fellow, thrust him away, and trod the fire out with
his feet, and not without some difficulty too.
The fellow was in such a rage at the honest man
thrusting him away, that he turned upon him with a
pole he had in his hand; and had not the man avoid-
ed the blow very nimbly, and run into the hut, he
had ended his days at once. His comrade, seeing
u 2
the danger they were both in, ran in after him, and
immediately they both came out with their muskets;
and the man who was first struck at with the pole,
knocked the fellow down who began the quarrel with
the stock of his musket, and that before the other
two could come to help him; and then seeing the-
rest come at them, they stood together, and pre-
senting the other ends of their pieces to them, bade them stand off.
The others had fire-arms with them too: but one
of the two honest men, bolder than his comrade, and
made desperate by his danger, told them if they
offered to move hand or foot, they were all dead men,
and boldly commanded them to lay down their arms.
They did not indeed, lay down their arms; but seeing
him so resolute, it brought them to a parley, and
they consented to take their wounded man with them
and be gone: and, indeed it seems the fellow was
wounded sufficiently with the blow.
Unt not to crowd this part with an account of the
lesser part of their rogueries, such as treading down
their corn, shooting three young kids, and a she-goat,
which the poor men had got to breed up tame for
their store, and in a word, plaguing them night and
day in this manner, it forced the two men to such a
desperation, that they resolved to fight them all
three the first time they had a fair opportunity. In
order to do this, they resolved to go to the castle, as
they called it, that was my old dwelling, where the
three rogues and the Spaniards all lived together at
that time, intending to have a fair battle, and the
Spaniards should stand by and see fair play. So
they got up in the morning before day, and came to
the place, and called the Englishmen by their names,
telling a Spaniard that answered, that they wanted
to speak with them.
It happened that the day before two of the Spani-
ards, having been in the woods, had seen one of the
two Englishmen, whom, for distinction, I call the
honest men; and he had made a sad complaint to the
Spaniards of the barbarous usage they had met with
from their three countrymen. When the Spaniards
came home at night, and they were all at supper, he
took the freedom to reprove the three Englishmen,
though in gentle and mannerly terms, at which they
took great offence.
The next morning they went all trooping away,
swearing to burn and demolish the habitation of the
other two men, and also muttered some insolent
things among themselves of what they would do to
the Spaniards too, when opportunity offered.
When they came thither, and found the men gone,
Atkins, who, it seems, was the forwardest man,
called out to his comrades, "Ha! Jack, here's the
nest; but, d—n them, the birds are flown." They
mused awhile to think what should be the occasion
of their being gone abroad so soon, and suggested
presently that the Spaniards had given them notice
of it; and with that they shook hands, and swore to
one another that they would be revenged of the
Spaniards. As soon as they had made this bloody
bargain, they fell to work with the poor men's habi-
tation. They did not set fire indeed to any thing,
but they pulled down both their houses, and left not
the least stick standing, or scarce any sign on the
ground where they stood; they also tore in pieces,
and squandered about their little household stuff.
The two men were, at this juncture, gone to find
them out, and had resolved to fight them wherever
they had been, though they were but two to three:
sp that, had they met, there certainly would have
been bloodshed among them, for they were all very
stout, resolute fellows, to give them their due.
When the three came back, like furious creatures,
flushed with the rage which the work they had been
about had put them into, they came up to the Spani-
ards and told them what they had done, by way of
scoff and bravado; and one of them stepping up to
one of the Spaniards, as if they had been a couple of
boys at play, takes hold of his hat as it was upon his
head, and giving it a twirl about, fleering in his face,
says to him, "And you, seignior Jack Spaniard,
shall have the same sauce, if you do not mend your
manners." The Spaniard, who, though a quiet, civil
man, was as brave as a man could be desired to be,
and withal a strong, well-made man, looking steadily
at him for a good while, and then, having no weapon
in his hand, stepped gravely up to him, and, with
one blow of his fist, knocked him down; at which
one of the rogues, insolent as the first, fired his pistol
at the Spaniard immediately. He missed his body,
indeed, for the bullets went through his hair; but
one of them touched the tip of his ear, and he bled
pretty much. The blood made the Spaniard believe
he was more hurt than he really was, and that put
him into some heat, for before he acted in a perfect
calm; but now, resolving to go through with his
work, he stooped, and took the fellow's musket whom
he had knocked down, and was just going to shoot
the man who fired at him, when the rest of the
Spaniards, being in the cave, came out, and, calling
to him not to shoot, they stepped in, secured the
other two, and took their arms from them.
When they were thus disarmed, and found they
had made all the Spaniards their enemies, as well as
their own countrymen, they began to cool, and giving
the Spaniards better words, would have had their
arms again; but the Spaniards, considering the feud that was between them and the other two English-
men, and that it would be the best method they
could take to keep them from one another, told them
they would do them no harm; and if they would
live peaceably, they would be very willing to assist
and associate with them as they did before; but that
they could not think of giving them their arms again,
while they appeared so resolved to do mischief with
them to their own countrymen, and had even threat-
them all to make them their servants. The
rogues were not more capable to hear reason than to
act reason; and, being refused their arms, they went
raving away, and raging like madmen, threatening
what they would do, though they had no fire-arms.
But the Spaniards, despising their threatening, told
them they should take care how they offered any
inj ury to their plantation and cattle, for if they did,
they would shoot them, as they would do ravenous
beasts, wherever they found them; and if they fell
into their hands alive, they would certainly be
hanged. As soon as they were gone, came back the
two men, in passion and rage enough also, though of
another kind; for having been at their plantation,
and finding it all demolished and destroyed, as above,
it will easily be supposed that they had provocation
enough; they could scarce have room to tell their
tale, the Spaniards were so eager to tell them theirs;
and it was strange to find, that three men should
thus bully so many, and receive not the least punish-
ment for it.
The Spaniards, indeed, despised them, and espe-
cially, having thus disarmed them, made light of
their threatenings; but the two Englishmen resolved
to have their remedy against them, what pains soever
it cost to find them.
But the Spaniards interposed here too, and told
them, that as they were already disarmed, they could
not consent that they (the two) should pursue them
with fire-arms, and perhaps kill them. "But," said
the grave Spaniard, who was their governor, "we
will endeavour to make them do you justice, if you will leave it to us; for as there is no doubt but they
will come to us again when their passion is over,
being not able to subsist without pur assistance, we
promise yon to make no peace with them, without
having a full satisfaction for you; and, upon this
condition, we hope you will promise to use no violence
with them, other than in your own defence." The
two Englishmen yielded to this very awkwardly, and
with great reluctance.
In about five days' time, the three vagrants, tired
with wandering, and almost starved with hunger,
having chiefly lived on turtle's eggs all that while, came back to the grove; and finding my Spaniard,
who, as I have said, was the governor, and two more
with him, walking by the side of the creek: they
came up in a very submissive, humble manner, and
begged to be received again into the family. The
Spaniards used them civilly, but told them that they
could not think of relieving them unless they would
promise to replace, as well as they could, the things
they had destroyed.
Well, they submitted to this, and as they had
plenty of provisions given them all the while, they
grew very orderly, and the whole society began to
live pleasantly and agreeably together again; only
that these three fellows could never be persuaded to
work; I mean, for themselves, except now and then
a little, just as they pleased. However, the Spani-
ards told them plainly, that if they would but live
sociably and friendly together, and study, in the
whole, the good of the plantation, they would be
content to work for them, and let them walk about
and be as idle as they pleased: and thus having lived
pretty well together for a month or two, the Spani-
ards gave them their arms again, and gave them
liberty to go abroad with them as before.
It was not above a week after they had these arms
and went abroad, but the ungrateful creatures began
to be insolent and troublesome as before. But, how-
ever, an accident happening presently upon this,
which endangered the safety of them all, they were
obliged to lay by all private resentments, and look
to the preservation of their lives.
It happened one night that the Spaniard governor,
as I call him, that is to say, the Spaniard whose life
I had saved, who was now the captain, or leader, or
governor, of the rest, found himself very uneasy in
the night, and could by no means get any sleep. He
was perfectly well in body, as he told me the story,
only found his thoughts tumultnous: his mind ran
upon men fighting and killing one another, but was
broad awake, and could not by any means get any
sleep. In short, he lay a great while, but growing
more and more uneasy, he resolved to rise. Being
gotten up, he looked out; but, being dark, he could
see little or nothing: and, hearing no noise, he re-
turned, and laid him down again : but it was all one,
he could not sleep, nor could he compose himself to
any thing like rest, but his thoughts were to the last
degree uneasy, and yet he knew not for what.
Having made some noise with rising and wall ing
about, going out and coming in, another of them
waked, and calling, asked who it was that was up.
The governor told him how it had been with him.
"Say you so?" says the other Spaniard. "Such
things are not to be slighted, I assure you : there is
certainly some mischief working," says he, "near
us." And presently he asked him, "Where are the
Englishmen?" "They are all in their huts," says he,
"safe enough." It seems the Spaniards had kept
possession of the main apartment, and had made a
place where the three Englishmen, since their last
mutiny, always quartered by themselves, and could
not come at the rest. "Well," says the Spaniard,
"there is something in it, I am persuaded."
In a word, they went out to go to the top of the
hill, where I used to go; but when they were going
round their grove, unconcerned and unwary, they
were surprised with seeing a light, as of fire, a very
little way off from them, and hearing the voices of
men, not of one or two, but of a great number. We
need not doubt, but that the governor, and the man
with him, surprised with this sight, ran back imme-
diately, and raised their fellows, giving them an ac-
count of the imminent danger they were all in, and
impossible to persuade them to stay close within
where they were, but that they must all run out to
see how things stood.
After having mused a great while, they resolved at
last, while it was dark, to send the old savage (Fri-
day's father) out as a spy, to learn, if they were
savages, something concerning them, as what they
came for, and what they intended to do, and the like.
The old man readily undertook it, and stripping him-
self quite naked, as most of the savages were, away
he went. After he had been gone an hour or two,
he brings word, that he had been among them undis-
covered, that he found there were two parties, and
of two several nations, who had war with one ano-
ther, and had had a great battle in their own country,
and that both sides having had several prisoners
taken in the fight, they were, by mere chance, landed
in the same island, for the devouring their prisoners,
and making merry; but their coming so by chance
to the same place had spoiled all their mirth: that
they were in a great rage at one another, and were
so near that he believed they would fight again, as
soon as daylight began to appear; but he did not
perceive that they had any notion of any body's
being on the island but themselves. He had hardly
made an end of telling his story, when they could
perceive, by the unusual noise they made, that the
two little armies were engaged in a bloody fight.
The battle held two hours, before they could guess
which party would be beaten; but then that party
which was "nearest our people's habitation began to
appear weakest, and, after some time more, some of
them began to fly; and this put our men into a great
consternation, lest any of those that fled should run
into the grove before their dwelling for shelter, and
thereby involuntarily discover the place, and that,
by consequence, the pursuers should do the like in
search for them. As they expected, it fell out:
three of the routed army fled for life, and crossing
the creek, ran directly into the place, not in the
least knowing whither they went, but running as
into a thick wood for shelter. Upon this, the Spani-
ard governor, a man of humanity, would not suffer
them to kill the three fugitives:" but, sending three
men out by the top of the hill, ordered them to go
round, and come hj behind them, surprise, and take
them prisoners, which was done. The residue of the
conquered people fled to their canoes, and got off to
sea; the victors retired, and made no pursuit, or very
little, but drawing themselves into a body together,
gave two great screaming shouts, which they sup-
posed was by way of triumph ; and so the fight
ended. The same day, about three o'clock in the
afternoon, they also marched to their canoes. And
thus the Spaniards had their island again free to
themselves; their fright was over, and they saw no
savages for several years after.
This deliverance tamed even the three English
brutes I have been speaking of, and, for a great
while after, they were tractable, and went about the
common business of the whole society well enough;
planted, sowed, reaped, and began to be quite agree-
able; but some time after this, they fell into such
measures again as brought them into great trouble.
The three savages, who were took prisoners, were
made servants or slaves; and they were all stout,
lusty fellows. After some time, one of the English-
men, a most turbulent fellow, being in a rage with
one of the slaves, because the fellow had not done
something right which he bade him do, and seemed
a little uutraetable in his showing him, drew a
hatchet out of a frog belt, in which he wore it by
his side, and fell upon the poor savage, not to correct
him, but to kill him. One of the Spaniards who was
by, seeing him give the fellow a barbarous cut with
the hatchet, which he aimed at his head, but struck
into his shoulder, so that he thought he had cut the
poor creature's arm off, ran to him, and, entreating
him not to murder the poor man, clapped in between
him and the savage, to prevent the mischief. The
fellow, being enraged the more at this, struck at the
Spaniard with his hatchet, and swore he would serve
him as he intended to serve the savage, which the
Spaniard perceiving, avoided the blow, and, with a
shovel, which he had in his hand (for they were
working in the field, about their corn land), knocked
the brute down. Another of the Englishmen, run-
ning at the same time to help his comrade, knocked
the Spaniard down; and then two Spaniards more
came to help their man, and a third Englishman fell
upon them. They had none of them any fire-arms,
or any other weapons, but hatchets and other tools.
except this third Englishman; he had one of my old
rusty cutlasses, with which he made at the last
Spaniard*, and wounded them both. This fray set
the whole family in an uproar, and more help coming
in, they took the three Englishmen prisoners. The
next question was, what should be done with them.
They had been so often mutinous, and were so furi-
ous, so desperate, and so idle withal, that they knew
not what course to take with them; for they were
mischievous to the highest degree, and valued not
what hurt they did to any man, so that, in short, it
was not safe to live with them.
The Spaniard who was governor, told them, that
if they had been his own countrymen, he would have
hanged them all, for all laws, and all governors, were
to preserve society, and those who were dangerous
to society ought to be expelled out of it; but as they
were Englishmen, and that it was to the generous
kindness of an Englishman that they all owed their
preservation and deliverance, he would use them with
all possible lenity, and would leave them to the judg-
ment of the other two Englishmen, who were their
countrymen. One of the two honest Englishmen
stood up, and said, they desired it might not be left
to them; "For," says he, " I am sure we ought to
sentence them to the gallows." And with that he
gives an account how Will Atkins, one of the three,
had proposed to have all the five Englishmen join
together, and murder all the Spaniards, when they
were in their sleep.
When the Spaniard governor heard this, he calls
to Will Atkins, "How, Seignior Atkins," says he,
"would you murder us all? what have you to say to
that J" That hardened villain was so far from deny-
ing it, that he said it was true, and they would do it
still before they had done with them. "Well, but
Seignior Atkins," said the Spaniard," what have we
done to you that you would kill us? and what would
you get by killing us? and what must we do to pre-
vent your killing us? We must kill you, or you will
kill us! Why will you put us to the necessity of
this, Seignior Atkins?" says the Spaniard very
calmly, and smiling.
Atkins was in a great rage, which obliged them to
consider seriously what was to be done. After a
long debate it was agreed, first, that they should be
disarmed, and not permitted to have either gun or
powder, or any weapon; and should be turned out
of the society, and left to live where they would, and
how they could, by themselves; but none of the rest,
either Spaniards or English, should converse with
them, or have any thing to do with them; that they
should be forbid to come within a certain distance of
the place where the rest dwelt; and that if they
offered to commit any disorder, so as to spoil, burn,
kill, or destroy any of the corn, plantings, buildings,
fences, or cattle, belonging to the society, that they
should die without mercy, and they should shoot
them wherever they could find them.
They went away sullen and refractory, as neither
contented to go away nor to stay; but as there was
no remedy, they went pretending to go and choose a
place where they would settle themselves to plant
and live by themselves; and some provisions were
given them, but no weapons.
About four or five days after, they came again for
some victuals, and gave the governor an account
where they had pitched their tents, and marked
themselves out a habitation and plantation. Here
they built themselves two handsome huts, and con-
trived them in a manner like my habitation, being
close under the shade of a hill, having some trees
growing already on three sides of it, so that by
planting others, it would be very easily covered from
the sight, unless narrowly searched for. They de-
sired some dried goat-skms for beds and covering,
which were given them; and, upon giving their
words, that they would not disturb the rest, or injure
any of their plantations, they gave them hatchets,
and what other tools they could spare, some peas,
barley, and rice, for sowing, and, in a word, any thing
they wanted, but arms and ammunition.
About three quarters of a year after this separa-
tion, a new frolic took these rogues, which, together
with the former villany they had committed, brought
mischief enough on them, "and had very near been
the ruin of the whole colony. The three new asso-
ciates began, it seems, to be weary of the laborious
life they led, and that without hope of bettering their
circumstances; and a whim took them, that they
would make a voyage to the continent, from whence
the savages came, and would try if they could not
seize upon some prisoners among the natives there,
and bring them home, so as to make them do the
laborious part of their work for them.
The three fellows came down to the Spaniards one
morning, and, in very humble terms, desired to be
admitted to speak with them. The Spaniards very
readily heard what they had to say, which was this;
that they were tired of living in the manner they
did; that they were not handy enough to make
the necessaries they wanted, and that, having no help,
they found they should be starved ; but if the Spani-
ards would give them leave to take one of the canoes
which they came over in, and give them arms and
ammunition proportioned for their defence, they
would go over to the main, and seek their fortune,
and so deliver them from the trouble of supplying
them with any other provisions.
The Spaniards told them with great kindness, that
if they were resolved to go, they should not go naked
men, and be in no condition to defend themselves;
and that, though they could ill spare their fire-arms,
having not enough for themselves, yet they would
let them have two muskets, a pistol, and a cutlass,
and each man a hatchet, which they thought was
sufficient for them. In a word they accepted the
offer, and having baked them bread sufficient for a
month, and gave them as much goat's flesh as they
could eat while it was sweet, and a great basket full
of dried grapes, a pot full of fresh water, and a young
kid alive to kill, they boldly set out in a canoe for a
voyage over the sea, where it was at least forty miles broad.
The boat, indeed was a large one, and would have
very well carried fifteen or twenty men, and, there-
fore, was rather too big for them to manage; but as
they had a fair breeze, and the flood tide with them,
they did well enough. They had made a mast of a
long pole, and a sail of four large goat skins dried,
which they had sewed or laced together ; and away
they went merrily enough. The Spaniards called
after them, "Bon veyajo," and no man ever thought
of seeing them any more.
The Spaniards would often say one to another, and
the two honest Englishmen who remained behind,
how quietly and comfortably they lived, now those
three turbulent fellows were gone. As for their ever
coming again, that was the remotest thing from
their thoughts that could be imagined; when behold,
after twenty-two days absence, one of the English-
men being abroad upon his planting work, sees three
strange men coming towards him, at a distance, two
of them with guns upon their shoulders.
Away runs the Englishman, as if he was bewitched,
and came frighted and amazed to the governor
Spaniard, and told him they were all undone, for there
were strangers landed upon the island, he could not
tell who? The Spaniard, pausing awhile, says to
him, "They are savages to be sure."—"No, no,"
says the Englishman, "they are men in clothes,
with arms."—" Nay, then," says the Spaniard, " why
are you concerned! If they are not savages they
they must be friends; for there is no Christian nation
upon earth but will do us good, rather than harm."
While they were debating thus, came the three
Englishmen, and standing without the wood, which
was new planted, hallooed to them. They presently
knew their voices, and so all the wonder of that kind
ceased. But now the admiration was turned upon
another question: viz. what could be the matter,
and what made them come again. It was not long
before they brought the men in, and inquiring where
they had been, and what they had been doing, they
gave them a full account of their voyage in a few
words; viz. that they reached the land in two days,
or something less, and they found the people very
courteous and friendly to them, and they gave them
several roots, and some dried fish, and appeared very
sociable; and the women, as well as the men, were
very forward to supply them with any thing they
could get for them to eat, and brought it to them a
great way upon their heads. They continued here
four days, and inquired as well as they could of them
by signs, what nations were this way, and that way;
and were told of several fierce and terrible people,
that lived almost every way, who, as they made
known by signs to them, used to eat men; but as for
themselves, they said that they never eat men or
women, except only such as they took in the wars;
and then they owned that they made a great feast,
and eat their prisoners.
The Englishmen inquired, when they had a feast
of that kind, and they told them two moons ago,
pointing to the moon, and then to two fingers: and
that their great king had two hundred prisoners now,
and that they were feeding them fat for the next feast.
The Englishmen seemed desirous to see the prisoners,
but the others mistaking them, thought they were
desirous to have some of them, to take away for their
own eating. So they beckoned to them, pointing to
the setting of the sun, and then to the rising, which
was to signify, that the next morning, at sunrising,
they would bring some for them; and, accordingly,
the next morning, they brought down five women,
and eleven men, and gave them to the Englishmen to
carry with them on their voyage. As brutish and barbarous as these fellows were at
home, their stomachs turned at this sight, and they
did not know what to do; to refuse the prisoners,
would have been the highest affront they could offer
to the savage gectry, and what to do with them they
knew not. However, they resolved to accept of
them, and in return, gave the savages that brought
them one of their hatchets, an old key, a knife, and
six or seven of their bullets, which, though they did not
understand, they seemed extremely pleased with; and
then tying the poor creatures' hands behind them,
they dragged the prisoners into the boat for our
men.
The Englishmen were obliged to come away as
soon as they had them, or else they that gave them
this noble present would certainly have expected that
they should have gone to work with them, have
killed two or three of them the next morning, and,
perhaps have invited the donors to dinner. Having
taken their leave, they put off with their boat, and
came back towards another island, where they set
eight of their prisoners at liberty, there being too
many for their occasion; after which they steered
towards home again.
When the three wanderers had given this unac-
countable history, or journal, of their voyage, the Spaniards asked them where their new family was;
and, being told that they had brought them on shore,
and put them into one of their huts, and were come
to beg some victuals for them, the Spaniards, and two
Englishmen, resolved to go down to the place and
see them, and Friday's father went with them.
When they came into the hut, there they sat all
bound; for when they had brought them on shore,
they bound their hands; and all of them stark
naked. First, there were three men, lusty, come y
fellows, well shaped, straight and fair limbs, about
thirty to thirty-five years of age; and five women,
whereof two might be from thirty to forty, two more
not above twenty-four or twenty-five, and the fifth,
a tall, comely maiden, about sixteen or seventeen.
The first thing they did was to cause the old Indian,
Friday's father, to go in, and see first if he knew any
of them: and then, if he understood any of their
speech. As soon as the old man came in, he looked
seriously at them, but he knew none of them, neither
could any of them understand a word he said, or a
sign he could make, except one of the women.
However, this was enough to answer the end,
which was to satisfy them that the meti into whose
hands they were fallen were christians, that they
abhorred eating either men or women, and that they
might be sure they would not get killed. As soon as
they were assured of this, they discovered such joy,
and by such awkward ways, as is hard to describe;
for it seems they were of several nations.
The woman who was the interpreter, was bid, in
the next place, to ask them if they were willing to
be servants, and to work for the men who had brought
them away to save their lives. At which they all
fell a dancing; and presently one fell to taking up
this, and another that, any thing that lay next, to
carry, to show they were willing to work.
The governor, who found that the having of women
among them would presently be attended with some
inconvenience, and might occasion some strife, and
perhaps blood, asked the three men what they in-
tended to do with these women, and how they in-
tended to use them, whether as servants or women.
One of the Englishmen answered very boldly and
readily, that they would use them as both. To which
the governor said, "I am not going to' restrain you
from it, you are your own masters as to that; but
this I think is but just, for avoiding all disorders and
quarrels among you, and I desire it of yon for that
reason only, that if you will all engage, if any of you take any of these women as a woman, or a wife, he
shall take but one, and that, having taken one, none
else should touch her; for though we cannot marry
anjr of you, yet it is lint reasonable that, while you
stay here, the woman any of you take should' be maintained by the man that takes her, and should be
his wife; I mean," says he," while he continues here,
and that none else should have any thing to do with
her." All this appeared so just, that everyone agreed
to it without any difficulty; and the five Englishmen
(the Spaniards declining the offer) drew lots for
choice, so that each had a wife.
But now I come to a scene different from all that
happened before, either to them or to me, and the
original of the story was this :—
Early one morning there came on shore five or six
canoes of Indians, or savages, and there is no room
to doubt that they came upon the errand of feeding
upon their slaves. But that part was now so familiar
to the Spaniards, and to our men too, that they did
not concern themselves about it as I did : but having
been made sensible, by their experiences, that their
only business was to lie concealed, they had nothing
to do but to give notice to all the three plantations
x 2 to keep within doors, and not show themselves, only
placing a scout in a proper place to give notice when
the boats went off to sea again.
This was without doubt very right; but a disaster
spoiled all these measures, and made it known among
the savages that there were inhabitants there, which
was, in the end, the desolation of almost the whole
colony. After the canoes with the savages were
gone off, the Spaniards peeped abroad again, and
some of them had the curiosity to go to the place
where they had been, to see what they had been
doing. Here, to their great surprise, they found
three savages left behind, and lying fast asleep upon
the ground; it was supposed they had been so gorged
with their inhuman feast, that, like beasts, they were
asleep, and would not stir when the others went, or
they were wandered into the woods, and did not come
back in time to be taken in.
The Spaniards were greatly surprised at this sight,
and perfectly at a loss what to do. The Spaniard governor, as it happened, was with them, and his
advice was asked, but he knew not what to do; as
for slaves, they had enough already, and as to killing
them, they were none of them inclined to that.
So they resolved to awaken them, and take them
prisoners, and they did so. The poor fellows were
strangely frightened when they were seized upon and
bound, and afraid that they should be murdered and
eaten; for, it seems, those people think all the world
do as they do, eating men's flesh; but they were soon
made easy as to that, and away they carried them.
It was very happy for them that they did not carry
them home to their castle, but they carried them first
to the bower, where was the chief of their country
work, such as the keeping of the goats, the planting
of the corn, &C., and afterwards they carried them to
the habitation of the two Englishmen.
Here they were set to work", though there was not
much for them to do: and, whether it was by negli-
gence in guarding them, or that they thought the
fellows could not mend themselves, I know not, but
one of them ran away, and, taking into the woods,
they could never hear of him more.
They had good reason to believe he got home again
soon after, in some other boats or canoes of savages,
who came on shore three or four weeks afterwards,
and who, carrying on their revels as usual, went off
in two days' time. This thought terrified them ex-
ceedingly; for they concluded, and that not without
good cause indeed, that if this fellow got safe home
among his comrades, he would certainly give them
an account that there were people in the island.
The first testimony they had that this fellow had
given intelligence of them was, that about two months
after this, six canoes of savages, with about seven or
eight, or ten men in a canoe, came rowing along the
north side of the island, where they never used to
come before, and landed about an hour after sun-rise
at a convenient place, about a mile from the habita-
tion of the two Englishmen, where this escaped man
had been kept. As the Spaniard governor said," Had
they been all there, the damage would not have been
BO much, for not a man of them would have escaped."
But the case differed now very much; for two men
to fifty was too much odds. The two men had the
happiness to discover them about a league off, so that
it was about an hour before they landed; and as they
landed about a mile from their huts, it was some
time before they could come at them.
Now having great reason to believe that they were
betrayed, the first thing they did was to bind the two
slaves which were left, and cause two of the three
men whom they brought with the women, who it
seems proved very faithful to them, to lead them with
their two wives, and whatever they could carry away
with them, to their retired place in the woods, which
I have spoken of before, and there to bind the two
fellows, hand and foot, till they heard farther.
When the poor frighted men had secured their
wives and goods, they sent the other slave they had
of the three who came with the women, and" who
was at their place by accident, away to the Spaniards
with all speed, to give them the alarm, and desire
speedy help: and, in the mean time, they took their
arms, and what ammunition they had, and retreated
towards the place in the wood, where their wives
were sent, keeping at a distance, yet so that they
might see, if possible, which way the savages took.
They had not gonefar, butthat,fromarising ground,
they could see the little army of their enemies come
on directly to their habitation, and, in a moment more,
could see all their huts and household stuff flaming
up together, to their great grief and mortification.
They kept their station for a while, till they found the
savages, like wild beasts, spread themselves all over
the place, rummaging every way and every place
they could think of, in search for prey; and, in par-
ticular, for the people, of whom it now plainly ap-
peared they had intelligence.
The two Englishmen, seeing this, thinking them-
selves not secure where they stood, because, as it was
likely some of the wild people might come that way,
so they might come too many together, thought
it proper to make another retreat, about half a mile
further, believing, as it afterwards happened, that the
farther they strolled the fewer would be together.
The next halt was at the entrance into a very
thick-grown part of the woods, and where an old
trunk of a tree stood, which was hollow, and vastly
large; and in this tree they both took their standing,
resolving to see there what might offer.
They had not stood there long, but two of the
savages appeared running directly that way, as if
they had already had notice where they stood, and
were coming up to attack them; and, a little way
farther, they spied three more coming after them,
and five more beyond them, all coming the same way,
besides which they saw seven or eight more at a dis-
tance, running another way; for, in a word, they ran
every way, like sportsmen beating for their game.
The poor men were now in great perplexity, whe-
ther they should stand and keep their posture or fly.
But, after a very short debate with themselves, they
considered, that if the savages ranged the country
thus, before help came, they might, perhaps, find out
their retreat in the woods, and then all would be lost,
so they resolved to stand them there ; and if there
were too many to deal with, then they would go up
to the top of the tree, from whence they doubted not
to defend themselves, fire excepted, as long as their
ammunition lasted, though all the savages that were
landed, which were near fifty, were to attack them.
Having resolved upon this, they next considered
whether they should fire at the first two, or wait for
the three, and so take the middle party; by which
the two, and the five that followed, would be sepa-
rated. At length, they resolved to let the first two
pass by, unless they should spy them in the tree, and
come to attack them. The first two savages also
confirmed them in this resolution, by turning a
little from them towards another part of the wood;
but the three and the five after them, came forwards
to the tree. as if they knew they were there.
. Seeing them come so straight towards them, they
resolved to take them in a line as they came; and as
they resolved to fire but one at a time, perhaps the
first shot might hit them all three; to which purpose,
the man who was to fire put three or four bullets
into his piece, and, having a fair loophole, from a
broken hole in the tree, he took a sure aim, without
being seen, waiting till they were within about thirty
yards of the tree, so that he could not miss.
While they were thus waiting, and the savages
came on, they plainly saw that one of the three was
the runaway savage that had escaped from them;
and they both knew him distinctly, and resolved
that, if possible, he should not escape, though1 they
should both fire; so the other stood ready with his
piece, that if he did not drop at the first shot, he
should be sure to have a second.
But the first was too good a marksman to miss his
aim; for, as the savages kept near one another, a
little behind in a line, in a word, he fired, and hit
two of them directly. The foremost was killed out-
right, being shot in the head; the second, which was
the runaway Indian, was shot through the body and
fell, but was not quite dead; and the third had a
little scratch in the shoulder, perhaps by the same
ball that went through the body of the second, and,
being dreadfully frightened, though not much hurt,
sat down upon the ground, screaming and yelling in
a hideous manner.
The five that were behind, more frightened with
the noise than sensible of their danger, stood still at
first; for the woods made the sound a thousand times
bigger than it really was: the echoes rattling from
one side to another, and the fowls rising from all
parts, screaming, and making every sort of noise, j ust
as it was when I fired the first gun that, perhaps, was
ever shot in that place since it was an island.
However, all being silent again, they not knowing
what the matter was, came on unconcerned, till they
came to that place where their companions lay, in a
condition miserable enough. And here the poor,
ignorant creatures, not sensible that they were within
reach of the same mischief, stood all in a group over
the wounded men. Our two men resolved to let fly
both together among them, and, singling out by
agreement which to shoot at, they shot together, and
killed, or very much wounded, four of them; the
fifth, frightened even to death, though not hurt, fell
with the rest: so that our men, seeing them all fall
together, thought they had killed them all.
The belief that the savages were all killed, made
our two men come boldly out from the tree before
i;
they had charged their guns again, which was a
wrong step; and they were surprised when they
came to the place and found no less than four of the
men alive, and of them, two very little hurt, and one
not at all. This obliged them to fall upon them with
the stocks of their muskets; and, first, they made
sure of the runaway savage, that had been the cause
of all the mischief, and of another that was hurt in
his knee, and put them out of their pain. Then the
man that was not hurt at all, came and kneeled down
to them, with his two hands held up, nnd made
;iteons moans to them, by gestures and signs, for
is life, but could not say one word to them that
they could understand.
However, they shrned to him to sit down at the
foot of a tree there by, and one of the Englishmen,
with a piece of rope-twine which he had by great
chance in his pocket, tied his feet fast together, and
his hands behind him, and there they left him.
They now resolved to go to the place where their
wives were, to see if all was well there ; and when
they came thither, they found the savages had been
in the wood, and very near the place, hut had not
found it; for, indeed, it was inaccessible, by the
trees standing so thick, unless the persons seeking it
had been directed by those that knew it, which these
were not. They found, therefore, every thing very
safe, only the women in a terrible fright. While
they were here, they had the comfort of seven of the
Spaniards coming to their assistance; the other ten,
with their servants, and Friday's father, were gone
in a body to defend their bower, and the corn and
cattle that were kept there, in case the savages
should have rowed over to that side of the country,
but they did not spread so far. With the seven
Spaniards came one of the three savages, who, as I
said, were their prisoners formerly, and with them
also came the savage whom the Englishmen had left
bound hand and foot at the tree; for it seems they
came that way, saw the slaughter of the seven men,
and unbound the eighth, and brought him along with
them, where, however, they were obliged to bind
him again, as they had done the two others who
were left when the third ran away. They then re-
solved, with great caution, to go forward towards
their ruined plantation. But a little before they
came thither, coming in sight of the sea shore, they
saw plainly the savages all embarking again in their
canoes, in order to be gone.
The prisoners began now to be a burden to them,
and they were so afraid of their escaping, that they
thought they were under an absolute necessity to
kill them for their own preservation. However, the
Spaniard governor would not consent to it, but
ordered that they should be sent out of the way to
my old cave in the valley, and be kept there, with
two Spaniards to guard them, and give them food, and
they were bound there hand and fuot for that night.
The poor Englishmen, being now twice ruined, and
all their improvements destroyed, the rest all agreed
to come and help them to rebuild, and to assist them
with needful supplies. Their three countrymen, who
were not yet noted for having the least inclination to
any good, yet, as soon as they heard of it (for they,
living remote eastward, knew nothing of the matter
till all was over,) came and offered their help and
assistance, and did very friendly work, for several
days, to restore their habitations, and make neces-
saries for them; and thus, in a little time, they were
set upon their legs again.
It was five or six months after this before they
heard any more of the savages, in which time our
men were in hopes that they had not forgot their
former bad luck, or had given over the hopes of
better, when, on a sudden, they were invaded with a
most formidable fleet of no less than twenty-eight
canoes full of savages, armed with bows and arrows,
great clubs, wooden swords, and such like engines of
war; and they brought such numbers with them, that
it put all our people into the utmost consternation.
As they came on shore in the evening, and at the
eastermost side of the island, our men had that night
to consult what to do; and knowing that their being
entirely concealed was their only safety before, and
would be much more so now, when the number of
their enemies was so great; they therefore resolved,
first of all, to take down the huts which were built
for the two Englishmen, and drive away their goats
to the old cave, because they supposed the savages
would go directly thither, as soon as it was day, to
play the old game over again.
They then drove away all the flock of goats they
had at the old bower, as I called it, which belonged
to the Spaniards; and, in short, left as little appear-
ance of inhabitants any where as possible; and the
next morning early they posted themselves, with all
their force, at the plantation of the two men, waiting
for their coming. As they guessed, so it happened:
these new invaders, leaving their canoes at the east
end of the island, came ranging along the shore
directly towards the place, to the number of two
hundred and fifty, as near as our men could judge.
Our army was but small indeed, being but twenty-
nine, slaves and all; but that which was worse, they
had not arms for all their number neither. To their
slaves they did not give either musket or fusil, but
they had every one a halbert, or a long staff, like a
quarter-staff, with a great spike of iron fastened to
each end of it, and by his side a hatchet; also every
one of our men had hatchets. Two of the women
could not be prevailed upon, but they would come
into the fight, and they had bows and arrows, which
the Spaniards had taken from the savages when the
first action happened, where the Indians fought with
one another; and the women had hatchets too.
The Spaniard governor commanded the whole;
and Will Atkins, who, though a dreadful fellow for
wickedness, was a most daring, bold fellow, com-
manded under him. The savages came forward like
lions, and our men, which was the worst of their fate.
had no advantage in their situation; only that Will
Atkins, who now proved a most useful fellow, with
six men, was planted just behind a small thicket of
bushes, as an advanced guard, with orders to let the
first of them pass by, and then fire, into the middle of
them, and as soon a's he had fired, to make his retreat
as nimbly as he could, round a part of the wood, and
so come in behind the Spaniards where they stood,
having a thicket of trees all before them. When the
savages came on, they ran straggling about every
way all in heaps, out of all manner of order, and Will
Atkins let about fifty of them'pass by him; then
seeing the rest come on in a very thick throng, he
orders three of his men to fire, having loaded their
muskets with six or seven bullets apiece, about as
big as large pistol bullets. How many they killed
or wounded, they knew not, but the consternation
and surprise was inexpressible among the savages,
who were frightened to the last degree, to hear such
a dreadful noise, and see their men killed, and others
hurt, but see nobody that did it; when, in the middle
of their fright, Will Atkins, and his other three, let
fly among the thickest of them: and, in less than a
minute, the first three, being loaded again, gave them
a third volley.
Had Will Atkins and his men retired immediately,
as soon as they had fired, as they were ordered to do;
or had the rest of the body been at hand, to have
poured in their shot continually, the savages had
been effectually routed; for the terror that was
among them came principally from this, viz. that
they were killed by the gods with thunder and light-
ning, and could see nobody that hurt them; but Will
Atkins staying to load again, they discovered the cheat.
Some of the savages, who were at a distance, spy-
ing them, came upon them behind, and though Atkins
and his men fired at them also, two or three times,
and killed above twenty, retiring as fast as they
could, yet they wounded Atkins himself, and killed
one of his fellow Englishmen with their arrows, as
they did afterwards one Spaniard, and oue of the
Indian slaves who came with the women: this slave
was a most gallant fellow, and fought most despe-
rately, killing five of them with his own hand, having no weapon but one of the armed staves and a hatchet.
The men being thus hard laid at, Atkins wounded,
and two other men killed, retreated to a rising ground
in the wood; and the Spaniards, after firing three
volleys upon them, retreated also, for their number
was so great, and they were so desperate, that though
above fifty of them were killed, and more than as
many of them wounded, yet they came on in the
teeth pf our men, fearless of danger, and shot their
arrows like a cloud; and it was observed, that their
wounded men, who were not quite disabled, made
outrageous by their wounds, fought like madmen.
When the men retreated, they left the Spaniard
and the Englishman that were killed behind them,
and the savages, when they came up to them, broke
their arms, legs, and heads, with their clubs and
wooden swords, like true savages. But finding our
men were gone, they did not seem to pursue them,
but drew themselves up in a kind of a ring, which is,
it seems, their custom, and shouted twice, in token
of their victory.
The Spaniard governor having drawn his little body
up together upon a rising ground, Atkins, though he
was wounded, would have had him march, and
charge them altogether, at once. But the Spaniard
replied," Seignior Atkins, you see how their wounded
men fight: let them alone till morning; all these
wounded men will be stiff and sorewith theirwounds,
and faint with the loss of blood, and so we shall have
the fewer to engage." The advice was good, but
Will Atkins replied merrily, "That's true, seignior,
and so shall I too, and that's the reason I would go
on while I am warm."—"Well, Seignior Atkins,"
says the Spaniard," you have behaved gallantly, and
done your part: we will fight for you, if you cannot
come on; but I think it best to stay till morning."
So they waited.
But as it was a clear moonlight night, and they
found the savages in great disorder about their dead
and wounded men, and a great noise among them
where they lay, they afterwards resolved to fall upon
them in the night, especially if they could come to
give them but one volley before they were discovered.
This they had a fair opportunity to do; for one of
the two Englishmen, in whose quarter it was where
the fight began, led them round, between the woods
and the sea-side, westward, and, turning short south,
they came so near where the thickest of them lay,
that, before they were seen or heard, eight of them
fired in among them, and did dreadful execution
upon them. In half a minute more, eight others
fired after them, pouring in their small shot in such
a quantity, that many were killed and wounded, and
all this while they were not able to see who hurt
them, nor which way to fly.
The Spaniards charged again with the utmost ex-
pedition, and then divided themselves into three
bodies, and resolved to fall in among them all toge-
ther. They had in each body eight persons; that is
to say, twenty-four, whereof were twenty-two men,
and the two women, who fought desperately.
They divided the fire-arms equally in each party,
and so of the halherts and staves. They would have
had the women keep back, but they said they were
resolved to die with their husbands. Having thus
formed their little army, they marched oat from the
trees, and came up to the teeth of the enemy, shouting
and hallooing as loud as they could. The savages
stood all together, but were in the utmost confusion,
heating the noise of our men shoating from three
quarters together. They would have fought if they
had seen us. and as soon as we came near enough to
be 'seen, some arrows were shot, and poor old Friday
was wounded, though not dangerously. But our men
gave them no time, but running up to them fired on
them three ways, and then fell in with the butt-ends
of their muskets, their swords, staves, and hatchets.
and laid about them so well, that they set up a dismal
screaming and howling, flying to save their lives.
Our men were tired with the execution, and killed
or wounded, in the two fights, about one hundred and
eighty of them; the rest, being frightened out of their
wits, scoured through the woods, and over the hills,
with all the speed that fear and nimble feet could
help them to do; and as our men did not trouble
themselves much to pursue them, they got altogether
to the sea-side, where they landed, and where their
canoes lay. But their disaster was not at an end yet;
for it blew a terrible storm that evening from the sea-
ward, so that it was impossible for them to put off;
nay, the storm continuing all night, when the tide
came up, their canoes were most of them driven by
the surge of the sea so high upon the shore, that it
required infinite toil to get them off, and some were
even dashed to pieces against the beach, or against
one another. Our men, though glad of their victory,
got little rest that night; but having refreshed them-
selves as well as they could, they resolved to march
to that part of the island where the savages were fled,
and see what posture they were in. When they came
within two musket-shot of them, the Spaniard go-
vernor ordered two muskets to be fired, without ball,
to alarm them: this he did, that, by their counte-
nance, he might know what to expect; viz. whether
they were in heart to fight, or were so heartily beaten,
as to be dispirited and discouraged, and so he might
manage accordingly. This stratagem took; for as
soon as the savages heard the first gun, and saw the
flash of the second, they started up on their feet,
in the greatest consternation imaginable; and, as
our men advanced swiftly towards them, they all ran
screaming and yelling away.
Will Atkins, who, notwithstanding his wound,
kept always with them, proved the best counsellor in
this case; his advice was, to take the advantage that
offered, and clap in between them and their boats,
and so deprive them of the capacity of ever returning
any more to plague the island.
In a word, he showed them the necessity of it so
plainly, that they all came into it; so they went to
work immediately with the boats, and, getting some
dry wood together from a dead tree, they tried to set
some of them on fire; but they were so wet that they
would not burn. However, the fire so burned the
upper part, that it soon made them unfit for swim-
ming in the sea as boats. When the Indians saw
what they were about, some of them came running
out of the woods, and coming as near as they could
to our men, kneeled down and cried, "Oat. oat waramokoa!" and some other words of their language,
which was understood to mean, that they begged to
have their boats spared, and that they would be gone,
and never come thither again. But our men were
now satisfied that they had no way to preserve them-
selves, or to save their colony, but effectually to pre-
vent any of these people from ever going home again,
depending upon this, that if ever so much as oite of
them got back into their country to tell the story,
the colony was undone; so that, letting them know
that they should not have any mercy, they fell to
work with their canoes, and destroyed them every
one, that the storm had not destroyed before. At
the sight of which the savages raised a hideous cry
in the woods, which our people heard plain enough;
after which they ran about the island like distracted
men, so that our men did not really know at first
what to do with them.
Nor did the Spaniards with all their prudence, con-
aider, that while they made those people thus des-
perate, they ought at the same time to have kept
good guard upon their plantations; for though it is
true, they had driven away their cattle, and the Indians did not find out their main retreat, I mean
my old castle at the hill, nor the cave in the valley,
yet they found out my plantation at the bower, and
pulled it all to pieces, and all the fences and planting
about it: trod all the corn under foot, tore up the
vines, the grapes being just then almost ripe, and did
our men inestimable damage.
The extremity and distress they were reduced to
for want of food was great, and, indeed, deplorable:
and many were afterwards found dead in the woods,
without any hurt, but merely starved to death. When our men found this, it made their hearts relent, and
pity moved them, especially the Spaniard governor, who was the most gentlemanly, generous-minded
man that ever I met with in all my life. And he
proposed, if possible, to take one of them alive, and
bring him to understand what they meant, so far as
to be able to act as interpreter, and to go among them
and see if they could not be brought to some condi-
tions, that might be depended upon to save their lives,
and do us no spoil.
It was some time before any of them could be
taken; but, being weak and half starved, one of them
was at last surprised, and made a prisoner. He was
sullen at first, and would neither eat nor drink; but,
finding himself kindly used, and victuals given him,
and no violence offered him, he at last grew tractable,
and came to himself. They brought old Friday to
him, who talked often with him, and told him how
kind the others would be to them all; that they
would not only save their lives, but would give them
a part of the island to live in, provided they would
keep in their own bounds, and not come beyond them
to injure or prejudice others; and that they should
have corn given them, to plant and make It grow for
their bread, and some bread given them for their pre-
sent subsistence; and old Friday bade the fellow go
and talk with the rest of his countrymen, and see
what they said to it, assuring them, that if they did
not agree immediately they should be all destroyed.
The poor wretches, thoroughly humbled, and reduced
in number to about thirty-seven, closed with the pro-
posal at the first offer, and begged to have some food
given them: upon which twelve Spaniards, and two
Englishmen, well armed, and three Indian slaves, and
old Friday, marched to the place where they were.
The three Indian slaves carried them a large quantity
of bread, and some rice boiled up to cakes, and dried
in the sun, and three live goats; and they were or-
dered to go to the side of a hill, where they sat down,
eat the provisions very thankfully, and were the most
faithful fellows to their words that could be thought
of; for, except when they came to beg victuals and
directions, they never came out of their bounds; and
there they lived when I came to the island, and I
went to see them.
One thing was very remarkable, viz. that they
taught them to make wicker-work, or baskets, but
they soon outdid their masters, for they made abund-
ance of most ingenious things in wicker-work, par-
ticularly all sorts of baskets, sieves, bird-cages, cup-
boards, &C. ; as also chairs to sit on, stools, couches,
beds, and abundance of other things, being very in-
genious at such work, when they were once taught.
After this, the colony enjoyed a perfect tranquillity
with respect to the savages, till I came to revisit
them, which was about two years.
I now entered into a serious discourse with the
Spaniard whom I called governor, about their stay
in the island; for, as I was not come to carry any of
them off, so it would not be just to carry off some,
aud leave others, who, perhaps, would be unwilling
to stay, if their strength was diminished.
On the other hand, I told them, I came to establish
them there, not to remove them; and then I let them
know that I had brought with me relief of sundry
kinds for them; that I had been at a great charge
to supply them with all things necessary, as well for
their convenience as their defence; and that I had
such and such particular persons with me, as well to
increase and recruit their number, as by the particular
necessary employments which they were bred to,
being artificers, to assist them in those things in
which, at present, they were to seek,
They were all together when I talked thus to them,
and before I delivered them the stores I had brought,
I asked them, one by one, if they had entirely forgot
and buried the first animosities that had been among
them, and would shake hands with one another, ;and
engage in a strict friendship and union of interest, so
that there might be no more misunderstandings or
jealousies. Will Atkins, with great frankness and
'good humour, said they had met with afflictions
enough to make them all sober, and enemies plenty
to make them all friends; that, for his part, he would
live and die with them, and was sofar from designing
any thing against the Spaniards, that, he owned,
they had done nothing to him but what his own mad
humoivr made necessary, and what he would have
done, and perhaps much worse, in their case; and
that he would ask their pardon, if I desired it, for
the foolish and brutish things he had done to them;
and was very willing and desirous of living on terms
of entire friendship:and union with them; and would
do any thing that lay in his power to convince them
of it. And as for going to England, he cared not if
he did not go thither these twenty years.
The Spaniards said they had, indeed, at first, dis-
armed and excluded Will Atkins and his two coun-
trymen, for their ill conduct, as they let me know;
and they all appealed to me for the necessity they
were under to do so. But that Will Atkins had
Y 2
behaved himself so bravely in the "rest fight they
had with the savages, and on several occasions since.
and had showed himself so faithful to, and concerned
for, the general interest of them all, that they had
forgotten all that was past, and thought he merited
as much to be trusted with arms, and supplied with
necessaries, as any of them. And as they had entire
confidence in him and all his countrymen, so they
acknowledged they had merited that confidence, by
all the methods that honest men could merit to be
valued and trusted. And they most heartily assured
me, that they would never have any interest separate
from one another.
Upon these frank and open declarations of friend-
ship, we appointed the next day to dine all together;
and, indeed, we made a splendid feast. I caused the
ship's cook and his mate to come on shore to dress our dinner, and the old cook's mate on shore assisted.
We brought on shore six good pieces of beef, and
four pieces of pork, out of the ship's provision, with
our punch-bowl, and materials to fill it, and, in par-
ticular, I gave them ten bottles of French claret,
and ten bottles of English beer ; things that neither
the-Spaniards nor the Englishmen had tasted for many years; and they were very glad of them.
The Spaniards added to our feast five whole kids,
which the cooks roasted, and three of them were
sent, covered up close, on board the ship, to the sea-
men, that they might feast on fresh meat from on
shore, as we did with their salt meat from on board.
After this feast, I brought out my cargo of goods,
wherein, that there might be no dispute about di-
vidmg, I showed them there was sufficient for them
all; and desired that they might all take an equal
quantity of the goods that were for wearing; that is
to say, equal when made up. At first, I distributed
linen sufficient to make every one of them four shirts,
but, at the Spaniard's request, afterwards made them
up six. These were exceedingly comfortable to
them, having been what, as I may say, they had long
since forgot the use of, or what it was to wear them.
I allotted the thin English stuffs, which I mentioned
before, to make every one a light coat, like a frock,
which I judged fittest for the heat of the season, cool
and loose; and ordered, that, whenever they decayed,
they should make more, as they thought fit. I also
gave them pumps, shoes, stockings, hats, &c.
I cannot express what pleasure, what satisfaction,
sat upon the countenances of all these poor men,
when they saw the care I had taken of them, and
how well I had furnished them.
Then I brought them out all my store of tools, and
gave every man a digging-spade, a shovel, and a
rake, for we had no harrows or ploughs; and to every
separate place a pick-axe, a crow, a broad axe, and
a saw, always appointing that as often as any were
broken or worn out, they should be supplied, without
grudging, out of the general stores that I left behind.
Nails, staples, hinges, hammers, chisels, knives,
scissors, and all sorts of tools and iron work, they
had as they required. And, for the use of the smith,
I left two tons of unwrought iron for a supply. My
magazine of powder and arms, which I brought them,
was such, even to profusion, that they could not but
rejoice at them.
I carried on shore with me the young man, whose
mother had died from want, and the maid also. She
was a sober, well educated, religious young woman,
and behaved so inoffensively, that every one gave
her a good word. After a while, seeing things so
well ordered, and in so fine a way of thriving upon
my island, and considering that they had neither
business nor acquaintance in the East Indies, or
reason for taking so long a voyage; I say, consider-
ing all this, both of them came to me, and desired I would give them leave to remain on the island, and
be entered among my family, as they called it. I agreed to it readily; and they had a little plot of
ground allotted to them, where they had tents, or
houses, set up.
I now presented to them the people I had brought
with me, viz. the two carpenters and the tailor, also
the smith, and my other man, whom I called "Jack
of all trades," who was almost as good as twenty
men; for he was a very ingenious fellow.
The French ecclesiastic came to me one morning,
as I was on my way to the Englishmen's colony,
and told me, with a grave countenance, that he had,
for two or three days, desired an opportunity of some
discourse with me," which he hoped would not be dis-
pleasing to me, because he thought it might, in some
measure, correspond with my general design, which
was the prosperity of my new colony, and, perhaps,
says he, "it is about your poor savages yonder, who
are (as I may say) your conquered subjects. It is a
maxim, sir, that is, or ought to be, received among
all Christians, of what church, or pretended church,
soever, viz. that Christian knowledge ought to be
propagated by all possible means, and on all possible
occasions. It is on this principle that our church
sends missionaries into Persia, India, and China, and that our clergy, even of the superior sort, willingly
engage in the most hazardous voyages, and the most
dangerous residence among murderers and barba-
rians, to teach them the knowledge of the true God,
and to bring them over to embrace the Christian
faith. Now, sir, you have such an opportunity here,
to have six or seven-and-thirty poor savages brought
over from idolatry to a knowledge of God, their
Maker and Redeemer, that I wonder how you can
pass such an occasion of doing good, which is really
worth the expense of a man's whole life." \
"Well, sir," said I, "it is a valuable thing indeed
to be au instrument in God's hand, to convert seven-
and-thirty heathen, to the knowledge of Christ. But
as you are an ecclesiastic, and are given over to that
work, so that it seems naturally to fall into the way
of your profession, how is it, then, that you do not
rather offer yourself to undertake it, than press me
to it?" Upon this he faced about just before me, as
we were walking, and, putting me to a full stop,
made me a very Tow bow. "I most heartily thank
God and you, sir," says he," for giving me so evident
a call to so blessed a work; and if you think yourself
discharged from it, and desire me to undertake it, I
will most readily do it, and think it a happy reward
for all the hazards and difficulties I have met with,
that I have dropped at last into so glorious a work."
He appeared m a kind of rapture as he said this;
and after I had considered it awhile, I asked him
seriously if he was in earnest, and that he would
venture on the single consideration of an attempt on
those poor people, to be locked up in an unplanted
island for, perhaps, his life, and at last might not
know whether he should be able to do them any good
or not? He turned short upon me, and asked me
what I called a venture. "Pray, sir," said he," what
do you think I consented to go in your ship to the
East Indies for?" "Nay," said 1, "that I know not,
unless it was to preach to the Indians." "Doubtless
it was," said he; "and do you think, if I can convert
these scven-and-thirty men to the faith of Christ, it
is not worth my time, though I should never be
fetched off the island again? Nay, is it not infinitely
of more worth to save so many souls, than my life is,
or the life of twenty more of the same profession?
Yes, sir," said he, "I would give Christ and the
blessed Virgin thanks all my days, if I could be made
the least happy instrument of saving the souls of
these poor men, though I was never to set my foot off
this islaud, or see my native country any more. But
since you will honour me," says he, "with putting
me into this work (for which I will pray for you all
Friday with me, to be my interpreter to them, and
to assist me, for without some help I cannot speak to
them, or them to me."
I was sensibly troubled at his requesting Friday,
because I could not think of parting with him, and
that for many reasons. He had been faithful, kind,
and affectionate to me, to the last degree; and as I had bred Friday up to be a Protestant, and this priest
being a Catholic, I thought it might spoil all his
religious principles. However, a sudden thought
relieved me in this strait, and it was this: I told him
I could not say that I was willing to part with Friday
on any account whatever: though a work that to
him was of more value than his life, ought to be to
me of much more value than the keeping or parting
with a servant; but, on the other hand, I was per-
Buaded that Friday would by no means consent to
part with me; and then to force him to it, without
his consent, would be manifest injustice, because I had promised I would never put him away, and he
had promised and engaged to me, that he would
never leave me, unless I put him away.
He seemed much concerned at this, for he did not
understand one word of their language, nor they one
word of his. To remove this difficulty, I told him
Friday's father had learned Spanish, which he also
understood, and he should be his interpreter: so he
was satisfied, and said he would stay and endeavour
to convert them; but Providence gave another and
very happy turn to all this.
When we came to the Englishmen, I sent for them
all together, and after some account given them of
what I had done for them, viz. what necessary things
I had provided for them, and how they were distri-
buted, which they were sensible of, and very thankful
far, I began to talk to them of the life they led, and asked them with what conscience they could take
these women and lie with them, as they had done,
call them their wives, and have so many children by
them, and not be married lawfully to them?
They all gave me the answer that I expected, viz.
that there was nobody to marry them; that they all
agreed before the governor to take them as their
wives, and to keep them and own them as their
wives; and they thought, as things stood with them,
they were as legally married as if married by a par-
son, and with all the formalities in the world.
And they told me, especially Will Atkins, who
seemed now to speak for the rest, that they loved
their wives as well as if they had been born in their
own native country, and would not leave them upon
any account whatever; and they did verily believe
their wives were as virtuous and as modest, and did,
to the utmost of their skill, as much for them and
for their children, as any women could possibly do,
and they would not part with them on any account.
And Will Atkins, added, if any man would take him
away, and offer to carry him home to England, and
make him a captain of the best man-of-war in the
navy, he would not go with him, if he might not
carry his wife and children with him, and if there
was a clergyman in the ship, he would be married to
her with all his heart. I told him I had a clergyman
with me, and if he was sincere, I would have him
married the next morning, and bade him consider of
it, and talk with the rest. He said as to himself, he
need not consider of it at all, for he was ready to do it,
and was glad I had a minister with me, and he though t
they would be all willing also. I then told him that
my friend the minister was a Frenchman, and could
not speak English, but that I would act as the clerk
between them.
Before I went from their quarter, they all came to
me and told me they had been considering what I
said; that they were very glad to hear I had a clear- gyman in my company, and they were very willing
to give me the satisfaction I desired, and to be for-
mally married as soon as I pleased, for they were far
from" desiring to part from their wives, and that they
meant nothing but what was honest when they chose
them. So I appointed them to meet me the next
morning, and that in the mean time, they should let
their wives know the meaning of the marriage law,
and that it was not only to prevent any scandal, but
also to oblige them that they should not forsake them,
whatever might happen. The women were easily
made sensible of the meaning of the thing, and were
very well satisfied with it, as indeed they had reason
to be. The next morning I brought out my clergy-
man; and though he had not on a minister's gown,
ufter the manner of England, or the habit of a priest,
after the manner of France, yet having a black vest,
something like a cassock, with a sash round it, he did
not look very unlike a minister; and as for his lan-
guage, I was interpreter.
When they arrived, and after promising to endea-
vour to persuade their wives to embrace christianity,
he married three couples; but Will Atkins and his
wife were not yet come in. After this, my clergy-
man, waiting awhile, was curious to know where
Atkins was, and turning to me, says he, "I entreat,
you, sir, let us walk out of your labyrinth here, and
look." So we went out together, and I took him a
way which none knew but myself, and where the
trees were so thick set, as that it was not easy to see
through the thicket of leaves, and far harder to see
in than to see out; when coming to the edge of the
wood, I saw Atkins and his tawny, savage wife,
sitting under the shade of a bush, very eager in dis-
course, I stopped short till my clergyman came up
to me, and then having showed him where they were,
we stood and looked at them a good while.
We observed him very earnest with her, pointing
up to the sun, and to every quarter of tUe heavens,
then down to the earth, then out to the Sea, then to
himself, then to her, then to the woods, and trees.
"Now," says the clergyman, " mark him; now he
is telling her that our (God has made him, and her,
and the heavens, the earth, the sea, the woods, the
trees, &c."—" I believe he is," said 1. Immediately
we perceived Will Atkins start up on his feet, fall upon his knees, and lift up both his hands. He did
not continue kneeling half a minute, but comes and
sits down by his wife, and talks to her again. We
perceived then the woman very attentive, but whe-
ther she said any thing or no, it was impossible for
us to tell.
Well, however, we could come no nearer, for fear
of disturbing them, so we resolved to see an end of
this piece of still conversation. He sat down again,
as I have said, close by her, and talked again very
earnestly to her, and two or three times we could see
him embrace her passionately; another time we saw
him take out his handkerchief and wipe her eyes, and
then kiss her again, with a kind of transport very
unusual; and after several of these things, we saw
him on a sudden jump up again, and lend her his
hand to help her up, when immediately leading her
by the hand a step or two, they both kneeled down
together, and continued so about two minutes.
My friend could bear it no longer, but cries out
aloud, " Saint Paul! Saint Paul! behold he prayeth!"
I was afraid Atkins would hear him, therefore I en-
treated him to withhold awhile, that we might see
the end of the scene, which to me, I must confess,
was the most affecting, and yet the 'most agreeable,
that ever I saw in my life. Well, he strove with
himself, and contained himself for awhile, but was
in such raptures of joy to think that the poor hea-
then woman was become a Christian, that he was
not able to contain himself; he wept several times,
then throwing up his hands, and crossing his breast,
said over several things ejaculatory, and by way of
giving God thanks for so miraculous a testimony of
the success of our endeavours.
When the poor man and his wife were risen again
from their knees, we observed he stood talking still
eagerly to her; and we observed by her motion that
she was greatly affected with what he said, by her
frequent lifting up of her hands, laying her hands to
her breast, anil such other postures as usually express
the greatest seriousness and attention. This conti-
nued about ten minutes, and then they went away.
Well, as Will Atkins and Ms wife were gone, our
business there was over, so we went back our own
way; and when we came back, we found them wait-
ing to be called in. Observing this, I asked my cler-
gyman if we should discover to him that we had
seen him under the bush, or no; and it was his opinion
we should not, but that we should talk to him first,
and hear what he would say to us. So we called him
in alone, nobody being in the place but ourselves, and
I began with him thus :—
"Will Atkins," said 1, " prithee what education
hadyou? What was your father?" W.A.—A better
man than ever I shall be. Sir, my father was a cler-
gyman. R. C.—What education did he give you?
W. A.—He would have taught me well, sir, but I despised all education, instruction, or correction like
a beast as I was. K. C.—It is true, Solomon says,
"He that despiseth a reproof is brutish." W. A.—.
Aye, sir, I was brutish indeed; I murdered my father;
for God's sake, sir, talk no more about that, sir; I
murdered my poor father! Priest.—Hal amurderer!
Here the priest started (for I interpreted every
word as he spoke it), and looked pale; it seems ho
believed that Will had really killed his own father.
B. C.—No, no, sir; I do not understand him so.
Will Atkins, explain yourself: you did not kill your
father, did you, with your own hands? W. A.—No,
sir; I did not cut his throat, but I cut the thread of
all his comforts, and shortened his days. I broke his
heart by the most ungrateful, unnatural return for
the most tender, affectionate treatment that ever
father gave, or child could receive. S. C.—Well, I
did not ask you about your father to extort this con-
fession: I pray God to give you repentance for it, and
forgive you that and all your other sins; but I asked
you because I see that though you have not much
learning, yet you are not so ignorant as some are in
things that are good; that you have known more of
religion than you have practised. W. A.—Though
you, sir, did not extort the confession that I make
about TUV father, conscience does; and whenever we
come to look back upon our lives, the sins against
our indulgent parents are certainly the first that
touch us; the wounds they make lie deepest, and
the weight they leave will lie heaviest upon the mind
of all the sins we can commit. S. C.—You talk too
feelingly and sensibly for me, Atkins, I cannot bear
it. W. A.—Yon bear it, master! I dare say you
know nothing of it. S. C.—Yes, Atkins, every
shore, every hill, nay, I may say, every tree in the
island, is witness to the anguish of my soul, for my
ingratitude and base usage of a good tender father;
a rather much like yours, by your description; and
I murdered my father as well as you, Will Atkins:
but I think, for all that, my repentance is short of
your's too, by a great deal.
I would have said more if I could have restrained
my passions: but I thought this poor man's repent-
ance was so much more sincere than mine, that I was going to leave off the discourse, and retire; for
I was surprised with what he said, and thought that
instead of my going about to teach and instruct him,
the man was made a teacher and instructor to me,
in a most surprising and unexpected manner.
I laid all this before the young clergyman, who
was greatly affected with it, and said to me, "Did
I not say, sir, that when this man was converted, he
would preach to us all! I tell you, sir, if this one
man be made a true penitent, here will bo no need of
me; he will make Christians of all in the island."
But having a little composed myself, I renewed my
discourse with Will Atkins. "But, Will," said I, " how comes the sense of this matter to touch you just now?" W. A.—Sir, you have set me about a work that has struck a dart
through my very soul. I have been talking about
God and religion to my wife, in order, as you directed
me, to make a Christian of her, and she has preached
such a sermon to me as I shall never forget while I
live. It. C.—Did you tell her what marriage was?
W. A.—Aye, aye, there began all our dialogue. I asked her if she would be married to me our way.
She asked me what way that was. I told her mar-
riage was appointed by God: and here we had a
strange talk together, as ever man and wife had.
N. B. This dialogue between W. Atkins and his
wife, as I took it down in writing, just after he told
it me^ was as follows:—
Wife.—Appointed by yonr God! why, have you a
God in your country? W. A.—Yes, my dear; God
is in every country. Wife.—No you God in my
country: my country have the great old Benamuckee
god. W. A.—Child, I am very unfit to show yon
who God is; God is in heaven, and made the heaven
and the earth, and all that in them is. Wife.—No
makce de earth; no makee my country. Will laughed
a little at her expression of God not making her
country. Wife.—No laugh: why laugh me? This
noting to laugh. He was justly reproved by his wife,
for she was a deal more serious than he was at first.
W. A.—That's true, indeed: I will not laugh at you any more, my dear. Wife.—Why, you say you
God make all! W. A.—Yes, child, our God made
the whole world, and you, and me, and all things;
for he is the only true God; there is no God but he.
He lives for ever in heaven. Wife.—What, haveyhu
de great God in you country, you no know him! No
say O to him? No do good ting for him? That no
possible. W.A.—It is true enough for all that. We
live as if there were no God in heaven, or that he
had no power on earth. Wife.—But why God let
you do so? Why he no nmkee you good live?
W. A.—It is all our own fault. Wife.—But you say me, he is great, much great, have much great
power; can makee kill when he will; why he no
makee kill when you no serve him'. No say O to
him? No be good mans? W.A.—That is true; he
might strike me dead, and I ought to expect it; for
I have been a wicked wretch, that is true; but God
is merciful, and does not deal with us as we deserve.
Wife.—How me tink you have great much God up
there (she points up to heaven), end yet no do well,
no do good ting! Can he tell? Sure he no tell what
you do? W. A.—Yes, yes, he knows and sees all
things; he hears us speak, sees what we do, knows
what we think, though we do not speak. Wife.—
What! he no hear you swear, curse, speak the great
damn? W. A.—Yes, yes, he hears it all. Wire.--Where then be the muehce great power strong?
W.A.—He is merciful; that ia all we can say for
it; and this proves him to be the true God: he is
God and not man; and therefore we are not consumed. Here Will Atkins told us, he was struck with
horror to think how he could tell his wife so clearly
that God sees, and hears, and knows the secret
thoughts of the heart, and all that we do; and yet
that he had dared do all the vile things he had done.
Wife.—Merciful! Whatyou call da t? W.A .—
He is our Father and Mak'er; and he pities and
spares us. Wife.—So then he never makee kill.
never angry when you do wicked; then he no good
himself, or no great awe. W. A.—Yes, yes, my dear;
he is infinitely good, and infinitely great, and able to
punish too; and sometimes, to show his justice and
vengeance, he lets fly his anger to destroy sinners,
and make examples. Many are cut off in their sins.
Wife.—But no makee kill you yet; then he tell you,
may be, that he no makee you kill, so you makee de
bargain with him; you do bad ting, he not be angry
at you, when he be angry at other mans? W. A.—
No, indeed: my sins are all presumptions upon his
goodness; and he would be infinitely just it he de-
stroyed me, as he has done other men. Wife.—Well,
and yet no kill, no makee you dead! What you say
to him for that? You no tell him, tankee for all that
too? W.A.—I am an unthankful, ungrateful dog,
that is true. Wife.—Why he no makee you much
good better? You say he makee you. W. A.—He
made me as he made all the world; it is I have de-
formed myself, and abused his goodness, and have
made myself an abominable wretch. Wife.-—I wish
you makee God know me; I no makee him angry;
I do no bad wicked ting.
Here Will Atkins said his heart sank within him,
to hear a poor untaught creature desire to be taught
to know God; and he such a wicked wretch, that he
could not say one word to her about God, but what
the reproach of his own carriage would make most
irrationable to her to believe; nay, that already she
had told him that she could not believe in God, be-
cause he that was so wicked was not destroyed.
W. A.—My dear, you mean you wish I could teach
you to know God, not God to know you, for he knows
you already, and every thought in your heart. Wife.
—Why then he know what I say to you now; he
know me wish to know him. How shall me know
who makes- me? W.A.—Poor creature, he must
teach thee. I cannot teach thee. I'll pray to him
to teach thee to know him, and to forgive me, that
am unworthy to teach thee.
The poor fellow was in such an agony at her desir-
ing him to make her know God, and her wishing to
know him, that he said he fell down on his knees
before her, and prayed to God to enlighten her mind
with the saving knowledge of Jesus Christ, and to
pardon his sins, and accept of his being the unworthy
instrument of instructing her.in the principles of re-
ligion; after which he sat down by her again, and
their dialogue went on.
N. B. This was the time when we saw him kneel
down, and lift up his hands.
Wife.—What you putdown thekueefor? Whatyou
hold up the hand for? What you say? Who you speak to? What is all that? W. A.—My dear, I
bow my knees in token of my submission to him that
made me. I said "O," to him, as you call it; and
as you say your old men do to their idol Benamuckee,
that is, I prayed to him. Wife.—What you say O
to him for? W. A.—I prayed to him to open your
eyes and your understanding, that you may know
him, and be accepted by him. Wife.—Can he do
that too? W. A.-- Yes, he can: he can do all things.
Wife.—But he no hear what you say? W. A.—Yes,
he has bid us pray to him, and promised to hear us.
Wife.—Bid you pray? When he bid you? How
he bid you? W'hatt you hear him speak? W. A.—
No, I do not hear him speak; but he has revealed
himself many ways to us.
Here he was at a great loss to make her under-
stand, that God has revealed himself to us by his
word, and what his word was; but, at last, he told
it her thus:—
W. A.—God has spoken to some good men, in
former days, even from heaven, by plain words; and
God has inspired good men by his Spirit, and they
have written all his laws down in a book. Wife.—
Me no understand that. Where is that book? W. A.
—Alas! my poor creature, I have not got this book?
but I hope I shall, one time or other, get it for you,
and help you to read it.
Here he embraced her with great affection; but
with inexpressible grief that he had not a Bible.
Wife.—But how you makee me know that God
teaches them to write that book? W. A.—By the z
same rule that we know him to be God. Wife.—
What rule, what way you know? W. A.—Because
he teaches and commands nothing but what is good,
righteous, and holy; and tends to make us perfectly
§pod, as well as perfectly happy; and because he for-
ids and commands us to avoid all that is wicked,
that is evil in itself, or evil in its consequences.
Wife.—That me would understand, that me fain see;
if he reward all good thing, punish all wicked thing,
he teaches all good things, forbid all wicked thing;
he makee all thing, he give all thing; he hear me
when I say O to him, as you go do just now; he
makee me good, if I wish be good; he spare me, no
makee kill me, when I no be good. All this you say
he do; yes, he be great God; me say O to liim too,
with you, my dear.
Here the poor man said he could forbear no longer;
but raising her up, made her kneel by him, and he
prayed to God aloud, to instruct her in the knowledge
of himself by his Spirit, and that, by some good pro-
vidence, if possible, she might, some time or other,
come to have a Bible, that she might read the word
of God, and be taught by it to know him.
This was the time that we saw him lift her up by
the hand, and saw him kneel down by her, as above.
This was a strange account, and very affecting to
us both, but particularly to the young clergyman.
However, he turned himself to me, and told me, that
he believed there must be more to do with this woman
than to marry her. I did not understand him at first,
but at length he explained himself; viz. that she
ought to be baptized.
I agreed with him to that part readily; but when
he was preparing to baptize her, I entreated him that
he would perform that office with some caution, that
the man might not perceive he was of the Roman
church, if possible, because of other ill consequences
which might attend a difference among us in that
very religion which we were instructing the other
in. He told me that as he had no consecrated chapel,
no proper things for the office, I should see he would
do it in a manner that I should not know by it that
he was a Roman Catholic myself, if I had not known
it before. And so he did; for saying only some words
over to himself in Latin, which I could not under-
stand, he poured a dish full of water upon the
woman's head, pronouncing in French, very loud,
"Mary," which was the name her husband desired
me to give her, for I was her godfather, " I baptize
thee in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and
of the Holy Ghost;" so that none could know any
thing by it what religion he was of.
As soon as this was over he married them, and after
the marriage was over, he turned himself to Will
Atkins, and, in a very affectionate manner, exhorted
him, not only to persevere in that good disposition
he was in, but to support the convictions that were
upon him, by a resolution to reform his life; told him
it was in vain to say he repented, if he did not for-
sake his crimes; represented to him how God had
honoured him with being the instrument of bringing
his wife to the knowledge of the christian religion;
and that he should be careful he did not dishonour
the grace of God. And thus ended the ceremony.
I think it was the most pleasant, agreeable day to
me that ever I passed in my whole life.
Having thus brought the affair of the island to a
narrow compass, I was preparing to go on board the
ship, when the young man whom I had taken out of
the famished ship's company came to me, and told
me, he understood I had a clergyman with me, and
that I had caused the Englishmen to be married to
the savages, whom they called wives; that he had a
match too, which he desired might be finished before
I went, between two Christians, which, he hoped,
would not be disagreeable to me.
I knew this must be the young woman who was
his mother's servant, for there was no other christian
z 2
woman on the island: so I began to persuade him
not to do any thing of that kind rashly, or because
he found himself in this solitary circumstance. He
smiled, and told me that I was mistaken in my guess,
for the persons he wished to be married was my Jack
of all trades, and his maid Susan.
I was most agreeably surprised when he named the
match, for indeed I thought it very suitable. The
character of that man I have given already; and
as for the maid, she was a very honest, modest,
sober, and religious young woman; had a very good
share of sense, and agreeable enough in her person,
very handy and housewifely in any thing that was
before her, an excellent manager, and fit, indeed, to
have been governess to the whole island.
The match being proposed in this manner, we mar-
ried them the same day; and as I was father at the
altar, as I may say, and gave her away, so I gave
her a portion, for I appointed her and her husband a
handsome, large space of ground for their plantation.
One thing I must not omit; and this is, that being
now settled in a kind of commonwealth among them-
selves, and having much business in hand, it was but
odd to have seven-and-thirty Indians live in a nook
of the island, independent, and, indeed, unemployed;
for, excepting the providing themselves food, which
they had difficulty enough to do sometimes, they had
no manner of business or property to manage. I
proposed, therefore, to the governor Spaniard that he
should go to them with Friday's father, and propose
to them to remove, and either plant for themselves,
or take them into their several families as servants,
to be maintained for their labour, but without being
absolute slaves; for I would not permit them to make
them slaves by force, by any means.
They most willingly embraced the proposal, and
came all very cheerfully along with him. So we al-
lotted them land and plantations, which three or four
accepted of, but all the rest chose to be employed 8>
servants in the several families we had settled. And
thus my colony was in a manner settled, as follows:
—the Spaniards possessed my original habitation,
which was the capital city, and extended their plan-
tation all along the side of the brook, which made
the creek I have so often described, as far as my
bower, and as they increased their culture, it went
always eastward. The English lived in the north-
east part, where Will Atkins and his comrades began,
and came on southward, and south-west, towards the
back part of the Spaniards; and every plantation had
an addition of land to take in, if they found occasion.
All the west-end of the island was left uninha-
bited, that if any of the savages should come on
shore there, only for their usual, customary barba-
rities, they might come and go, if they disturbed
nobody, nobody would disturb them.
It now came into my thoughts, that I had hinted
to my friend the clergyman that the work of con-
verting the savages might perhaps be set on foot in
his absence, to his satisfaction; and I told him that
now I thought it was put in a fair way; for, the
savages being thus divided among the christians, if
they would but every one do their part with those
which came under their hands, I hoped it might
have a very good effect.
He agreed presently in that: "If," said he, " they
will do their part: but how shall we obtain that of
them?" I told him we would call them all together,
and leave it in charge with them, or go to them one
by one, which he thought best. So we divided it;
he to speak to the Spaniards, who were all Papists,
and I to the English who were all Protestants; and
we recommended it earnestly to them, and made
them promise, that they would never make any dis-
tinction of Papist or Protestant in their exhorting
the savages to turn Christians : but teach the general
knowledge of the true God, and of their Savior Jesus Christ; and they likewise promised us that they
would never have any differences or disputes, one
with another about religion.
When I came to Will Atkins's house, I found the
young woman I have mentioned before, and Atkins's
wife, were become intimates, and this prudent, reli-
gious young woman had perfected the work Will
Atkins had begun; and though it was not above four
days after what I have related, yet the new-baptized
savage woman was made such a Christian as I have
seldom heard of any like her, in all my observation
or conversation in the world.
It came next into my mind, in the morning before
I went to them, that, among all the needful things I had to leave with them, I had not left a Bible, in
which J showed myself less considering for them than
my good friend the widow was for me, when she sent
me the cargo of one hundred pounds from Lisbon,
where she packed up three Bibles and a Prayer-book.
I took one of the Bibles in my pocket, and
when I came to Atkins's tent or house, I found the
young woman, and Atkins's baptized wife were dis-
coursing of religion together. "O, sir," says Will
Atkins, "when God has sinners to reconcile to him-
self, and aliens to bring home, he never wants a mes-
senger. My wife has got a new instructor. I knew
I was as unworthy as I was incapable of that work;
that young woman has been sent hither from heaven;
she is enough to convert a whole island of savages."
The young woman blushed, and rose up to go away,
but I desired her to sit still. I told her she had' a
good work upon her hands, and I hoped God would
bless her in it.
We talked a little, and I did not perceive they had
any book among them, though I did not ask ; bat I
put my hand in my pocket, and pulled out my Bible.
"Here," said I to Atkins, " I have brought you an
assistant, that, perhaps, you had not before." The
man was so confounded, that he was not able to speak
for some time; but recovering himself, he takes it
with both his hands, and, turning to his wife, "Here,
my dear," says he, " did I not tell you our God,
though he lives above, could hear what we said?
Here is the book I prayed for, when you and I kneeled
down under the bush; now God has heard us, and
sent it." When he had said thus, the man fell into
such transports of a passionatejoy, that between the
joy of having it, and giving God thanks for it, the
'tears ran down his face like a child that was crying.
The woman was surprised, and was like to have
run into a mistake that none of us were aware of;
for she firmly believed God had sent the book upon
her husband's petition. It is true, that providentially
it was so, and might be taken in a consequent sense;
yet it was too serious a matter to suffer any delusion
to take place; so I turned to the young woman, and
told her, we did not desire to impose upon the new
convert in her first and more ignorant understanding
of things, and begged her to explain to her, that God
may be very properly said to answer our petitions,
when, in the course of his providence, such things
are, in a particular manner, brought to pass, as we
petitioned for; but we do not expect returns from
Heaven in a miraculous and particular manner, and
that it is out of mercy that it is not so.
This the young woman did afterwards effectually.
But the surprise and joy upon Will Atkins is really
not to be expressed. Surely no man was ever more
thankful in the world for any thing of its kind, than
he was for this Bible; and, I believe, never any man
was glad of a Bible from a better principle: and
though he had been a most profligate creature, des-
perate, headstrong, outrageous, furious, and wicked,
to a great degree, yet this man is a standing rule to
us all for the well-instructing children, viz. that
parents should never give over to teach and instruct,
or ever despair of the success of their endeavours,
let the children be ever so obstinate, refractory, or,
to appearance, insensible of instruction.
I did not think fit to let them know any thing of
the sloop I had framed, and which I had thought of
setting up among them; for I was afraid if I left it,
some of them might endeavour to make their escape
in it from the island. and thus diminish the strength
of the colony. Neither did I leave the two pieces of
brass cannon that I had on board, or the two quarterdeck guns that my nephew took extraordinary; for
I thought they had arms sufficient to qualify them
for a defensive war against any that should invade
them.
I have now done with the island. I left them all
in good circumstances, and in a flourishing condition,
and went on board my ship again the 5th day of May,
having been nve-and-twenty days among them; and,
as they were all resolved to stay upon the island till
I came to remove them, I promised to send some
farther relief from the Brazils, if I could possibly
find an opportunity; and particularly I promised to
send them some cattle, such as sheep, hogs, and cows.
The next day, giving them a salute of five guns at
parting, we set sail, and arrived at the Bay of All
Saints, in the Brazils, in about twenty-two days,
meeting nothing remarkable in our passage, except
on the third day, towards evening, the sea smooth,
and the weather calm, we saw the sea, as it were,
covered, towards the land, with something very
black, not being able to discover what it was, but
after some time, our chief mate, going up the main
shrouds a little way, and looking at them with a
perspective glass, cried out it was an army. I could
not imagine what he meant by an army, and spoke a
little hastily, calling the fellow a fool, or some such
word. "Nay, sir," said he, "do not be angry, for it
is an army, and a fleet too; for I believe there are
a thousand canoes, and you may see them paddle
along, and they are coming towards us, too, apace,
and full of men.
I was a little surprised then, indeed and so was
to be afraid, but bring the ship to an anchor, as soon
as we came so near as to know that we must engage
them. The weather continued calm, and they came
on apace towards us; so I gave orders to come to an
anchor, and furl all our sails. As for the savages, I
told them they had nothing to fear but fire, and
therefore they should get their boats out, and fasten"
them, one -close by the head, and the other by the
stern, and man them both well, and wait the issue
in that posture. This I did that the men in the
boats might be ready, with sheets and buckets, to
put out any fire these savages might endeavour to fix
upon the outside of the ship.
In this posture we lay by for them, and, in a little
while, they came up with us; but never was such a
horrid sight seen bv Christians. My mate was much
mistaken in his calculation of their number, I mean
of a thousand canoes; the most we could make of
them when theycame up, being about a hundred and
twenty-six, and a great many of them had sixteen or
seventeen men in them, some more, and the least six
or seven. They came very near us, and seemed to
go about to row round us: but we called to our men
in the boats not to let them come too near them.
This very order brought us to an engagement with
them, without our designing it; for five or six of
their large canoes came so near our long boat, that
our men beckoned with their hands to them to keep
back, which they understood very well, and went
back; but, at their retreat, about fifty arrows came
on board us from those boats, and one of our men in
the long-boat was very much wounded. However,
I called to them not to fire by any means: but we
handed down some deal boards into the boat, and the
carpenter presently set up a kind offence, like waste
boards, to cover them from the arrows of the savages,
if they should shoot again.
About half an hour afterwards, they came all up in
a body astern of us, and pretty near; but, in a little
time more, they rowed somewhat farther out to sea,
till they came "directly broadside with us, and then
rowed down straight upon us, till they came so near
that they could hear us speak. Upon this, I ordered
all my men to keep close, lest they should shoot any
more arrows, and make all our guns ready: but,
being so near as to be within hearing, I made Friday
go out upon the deck, and call aloud to them in his language to know what they meant, which he accord-
ingly did. Whether they understood him or not,
that I knew not; but as soon as he had called to
them, six of them, who were in the foremost boat,
turned their canoe from us, and stooping down,
showed us their naked backsides, just as if, in
English, they bade us kiss . Whether this was-
.a defiance, or challenge, we know not; or whether
it was done in mere contempt, or as a signal to the
-rest; but immediately Friday cried out they were
going to shoot; and unhappily for him, poor fellow f
.they let fly about three hundred of their arrows, and,
to my inexpressible grief, killed poor Friday, no other
man'being in their sight. The poor fellow was shot
with no less than three arrows, and about three more fell very nigh him; such unlucky marksmen they
were. I was so enraged with the loss of my old
servant, the companion of all my sorrows and soli-
tudes, that I immediately ordered five guns to be
loaded with small shot, and four with great, and gave
them such a broadside as they never had in their
lives before. They were not above half a cable's
length off when we fired; and our gunners took their
aim so well, that three or four of their canoes were overset, as we had reason to believe, by one shot only.
I can neither tell how many we killed, nor how
many we wounded, at this broadside; but sure such
a fright and hurry never was seen among such a
multitude: there were thirteen or fourte 911 of their
canoes split, and overset, in all, and the mm all set
a swimming; the rest, frightened out of their wits,
scoured away as fast as they could; and our men
took up one poor fellow swimming for his life, above
an hour after they were all gone.
In three hours or thereabouts, we could not see
above three or four straggling canoes ; nor did we
ever see the rest any more, for a breeze of wind
springing up the same evening, we weighed, and set
sail for the Brazils.
The prisoner we had got was so sullen, that for
some time he would neither eat nor speak, and we
all fancied he would pine himself to death. When
he was more tractable, and we had taught him to
speak a little English, he told us that they were
going with their kings to fight a great battle. When
he said kings, we asked him how many kings. He
said there were five nation, and that they all joined
to go against two nation. We asl ed him what made
them come up to us. He said, "to makee te great
wonder look." Where it is to be observed, that all
those natives, as also those of Africa, when they
learn English, they always add two e's at the end of
the words where we use one, and place the accent
upon them, as "makee, takee," and the like; and we
could not break them off it; nay, I could hardly
make Friday leave it off, though at last he did.
And now I name the poor fellow once more, I must
take my last leave of him. Poor honest Friday! we
buried him with all the decency and solemnity pos-
sible, by putting him into a coffin, and throwing him
into the sea; and I caused them to fire eleven guns
for him: and so ended the life of the most grateful,
faithful, honest, and most affectionate servant that
ever man had.
We now went away with a fair wind for the Brazils,
and in about twelve days' time we made land. I found my old partner alive, and after various con-
gratulations and presents between us, I got him to
engage men to set up the sloop which I had brought
with me from England, as I have said, for the use of
my colony, in order to send the refreshments 1 in-
tended to my plantation. When it was finished, I
gave the master of her such instructions as he could
not miss the place; nor did he miss it, as I had an
account from my partner afterwards. One of our
seamen, who had been on shore with me there, offered
to go with the sloop, and settle there, upon my letter
to the governor Spaniard to allot him a sufficient
quantity of land for a plantation; so I granted all
he desired, giving him some clothes, and tools for his
planting-work; I also gave him the savage which we
had taken prisoner of ^war, to be his slave; and or-
dered the governor Spaniard to give him his share of
every thing he wanted with the rest. When we were fitting this man out, my old partner
told me there was a certain very honest fellow, a
Brazil planter, of his acquaintance, who had fallen
into the displeasure of the church. He said he be-
lieved he was a heretic in his heart; and that he had
been obliged to conceal himself for fear of the Inquisi-
tion. He told me that this man would be very glad
of such an opportunity to make his escape, with his
wife and two daughters, and if I would let them go
to my island, and allot them a plantation, he would
give them a small stock to begin with; for the officers
of the Inq uisition had seized all his effects and estate,
and he had nothing left but a little household stuff,
and two slaves.
I granted this presently, and joined my English-
man with them; and we concealed the man, and his
wife and daughters, on board the ship, till the sloop
put out to go to sea; and then (having put all their
goods on board the sloop some time before) we put
them on board the sloop, after she was got out of
the bay.
Among the supplies sent to my tenants in the
island, by this sloop, were three milch cows and five
calves, about twenty-two hogs, three sows big with
pig, two mares, and a stone-horse. I also sent some
materials for planting sugar-canes, with some plants
of canes. For my Spaniards, according to promise,
I sent three Portuguese women, and recommended
it to them to marry them, and use them kindly. I
could have procured more women, but I remembered
that the poor persecuted man had two daughters,
and there were but five of the Spaniards that wanted:
the rest had wives, though in another country.
All this cargo arrived safe, and, as may be sup-
posed, very welcome to my old inhabitants, who were
now (with this addition^ between sixty and seventy
people, besides little children, of which there were a
great many. I found letters at London from them,
all by way of Lisbon, when I came back to England,
being sent back to the Brazils by this sloop, of which
I shall take some notice in its place.
I have now done with my island; and the reader
must expect to read only of the follies of an old man,
not warned by his own harms, much less by those of
other men, to beware of the like; not cooled by
almost forty years of misery and disappointment;
nor satisfied with prosperity beyond expectation;
not made cautious by affliction and distress beyond
imitation.
I should only add here, that my honest and truly
pious clergyman left me here: a ship being ready to
go to Lisbon, he asked me leave to go thither, being
still, as he observed, bound never to finish any voyage
he began. How happy had it been for me if I had
gone with him.
From the Brazils we made directly away over the
Atlantic Sea, to the Cape of Good Hope. We made
no stay there longer than was needful to take in
fresh water, but made the best of our way for the
coast of Coromandel. We touched at the island of
Madagascar, where, though the people are fierce and
treacherous, and, in particular, very well armed
,with lances and bows, which they use with incon-
ceivable dexterity, yet we fared very well with
them a while: they treated us very civilly, and, for
some trifles which we gave them, such as knives,
scissors, &C., they brought us eleven good fat bul-
locks, middling in size, but very good in flesh, which
we took in, partly for fresh provisions for our present
spending, and the rest to salt for the ship's use.
It happened one evening, when we went on shore,
that a greater number of their people came down
than usual, but were all very friendly and civil.
They brought with them several kinds of provisions,
for which we satisfied them with such toys as we
had: their women also brought us milk and roots,
and several things very acceptable to us, and all was
quiet. The men staid on shore all night.
I know not what was the occasion, but I was not
so well satisfied to lie on shore asthe rest; and the
boat lying at an anchor, about a stone's cast from the
land, with two men in her to take care of her, I made
one of them come on shore, and, getting some boughs
of trees to cover us also in the boat, I spread the sail
on the bottom of the boat, and lay on board, under
the cover of the branches of the trees, all night.
About two o'clock in the morning we heard one of
our men making a terrible noise on shore, calling out,
for God's sake, to bring the boat in, and come and
help them, for they were all like to be murdered : at
the same time I heard the firing of five muskets,
which was the number of the guns they had, and that
three times over: for it seems the natives here were
not so easily frighted with guns as the savages were
in America, where I had to do with them.
All this while I knew not what was the matter,
but rousing immediately from sleep with the noise, I caused theboat to be thrust in, and resolved, with three
fusils we had on board, to land, and assist our men.
We got the boat soon to the shore, but our men
were in too much haste; for being come to the shore,
they plunged into the water to get to the boat with
all the expedition they could, being pursued by
between three and four hundred men. Our men were
but nine in all, and only five of them had fusils with.
them: the rest indeed had pistols and swords, but
they were of small use to them.
We took up seven of our men, and with difficulty
enough too, three of them being very ill wounded;
and that which was still worse "was, that while we
stood in the boat to take our men in, we were in an
much danger as they were on shore, for they poured
their arrows in upon us so thick, that we were fain
to barricade the side of the boat up with the benches,
and two or three loose boards, which, to our great
satisfaction, we had, by mere accident, or Providence
rather, in the boat.
And yet, had it been day-light, they are, it seems.
such exact marksmen, that if they could have seen
but the least part of any of us, they would have been
sure of us. We had, by the light of the moon, a little
sight of them, as they stood pelting us from the shore
with darts and arrows; and having got ready our
fire-arms, we gave them a volley, and we could hear
by the cries ot some of them that we had wounded
several. However, they stood thus in battle array
on the shore till break of day, which we suppose was,
that they might see the better to take their aim at us.
In this condition we lay, and could not tell how to
weigh anchor, or set up our sail, because we must
needs stand up in the boat, and they were as sure to
hit us as we were to hit a bird in a tree with small
shot. We made signals of distress to the ship, which,
though she rode a league off, yet my nephew, the
captain, hearing our firing, and, by glasses, perceiving
the posture we lay in, and that we fired towards the
shore, pretty well understood us, and weighing anchor
with all speed, he stood as near the shore as he durst
with the ship, and then sent another boat, with ten
hands in her, to assist us; but we called to them not
to come too dear, telling them what condition we
were in. However, they stood in nearer to us; and
one of the men, taking the end of a tow-line in his
hand, and keeping our boat between him and the
enemy, so that they could not perfectly see him, swam
on board us, and made the line fast to the boat, upon
which we slipped our little cable, and, leaving our
anchor behind, they towed us out of the reach of the
arrows, we all the while lying close behind the bar-
ricade we had made.
As soon as we were got from between the ship and
the shore, that she could lay her side to the shore, we
ran along just by them, andwe poured in a broadside
among them, loaded with pieces of iron and lead,
small bullets, and such stuff, besides the great shot,
which made a terrible havoc among them.
When we were got on board, and out of danger, we
had time to examine into the occasion of this fray:
and indeed our supercargo, who had been often in
those parts, put me upon it; for he said he was sure
the inhabitants would not have touched us, after we
had made a truce, if we had not done something to
provoke them to it. At length it came out, viz. that
an old woman, who had come to sell us some milk,
had brought it within our poles, with a young woman
with her, who also brought some roots or herbs; and
while the old woman (whether she was mother to the
young one or no, they could not tell) was selling us
the milk, one of our men offered some rudeness to the
wench that was with her, at which the old woman
made a great noise. However, the seaman would not
quit his prize, but carried her out of the old woman's
sight, among the trees, it being almost dark; the old
woman went away without her, and, as we suppose,
made an outcry among the people she came from,
who, upon notice, raised this great army against us
in three or four hours; and it was great odds but we
had been all destroyed.
One of our men was killed with a lance that was
thrown at him, just at the beginning of the attack,
I.1
si
as he sallied out of the tent we had made; the rest
came off free, all but the fellow who was the occa-
sion of all the mischief, who paid dear enough for his
black mistress, for we could not hear what became
of him for a great while. We lay upon the shore two
days after, though the wind presented, and made sig-
nals for him; made our boat sail up shore, and down
shore, several leagues, but in vain. So we were ob-
liged to give him over; and if he alone had suffered
for it, the loss had been the less.
I could not satisfy myself, however, without ven-
turing on shore once more to try if I could learn any
thing of him or them. It was the third night after
the action that I had a great mind to learn, if I could,
by any means, what mischief we had done, and how
the game stood on the Indian side. I was careful to
do it in the dark, lest we should be attacked again;
but I ought, indeed, to have been sure, that the men
I went with had been under my command, before I engaged in a thing so hazardous and mischievous as
I was brought into without my knowledge or design.
We took twenty stout fellows with us as any in the
ship, besides, the supercargo and myself, and we
landed two hours before midnight, at the same place
where the Indians stood drawn up the evening before.
I landed here, because my design, as I have said, was
chiefly to see if they had quitted the field, and if
they had left any marks behind them, or of the mis-
chief we had done them, and perhaps we might get
our man again.
We landed without any noise, and divided our men
into two companies, whereof the boatswain com-
manded one, and I the other. We neither could hear,
nor see any body stir, when we landed, so we marched
up, one body at a distance from the other, to the
field of battle. At first we could see nothing, it
being very dark; but by-and-bye, our boatswain, that
led the first party, stumbled, and fell over a dead
body. This made them halt awhile; for, knowing by
2 A
the circumstance, that they were at the place where
the Indians had stood, they waited for my coming
up. Here we concluded to halt till the moon began to
rise, and then we could easily discern the havoc we
had made among them. We told two-and-thirty
bodies upon the ground, whereof two were not dead.
When we had made a full discovery of all we could
come at the knowledge of, I was going on board
again; but the boatswain and his party sent me
word that they were resolved to make a visit to the
Indian town, where these dogs, as they called them.
dwelt; and desired me to go along with them; and
if they could find them, as they still fancied they
should, they did not doubt, they said, getting a good
booty, and they might find Thomas Jeffrys there;
that was the man's name we had lost.
Had they sent to ask my leave to go, I knew well
enough what answer to have given them, for I would
have commanded them instantly on board, knowing
it was not a hazard fit for us to run, who had a ship,
and a ship's loading in our charge, and a voyage to
make, which depended very much upon the lives of
the men 5 but as they sent me word they were re-
solved to go, and only asked me and my company to
go along with them, I positively refused it, and rose
up from the ground in order to go to the boat.
"Come, Jack," says one of the men, "will you go
with me? I'll go for one." Jack said he would, and
another followed, and then another, and, in a word,
they all left me but one, whom, with much difficulty,
I persuaded to stay; so the supercargo and I, with
the third man, went back to the boat, where I told
them we would stay for them, and take care to take
in as many of them as should be left; for I told them
it was a mad thing they were going about, and per-
haps most of them would share the fate of Thomas
Jeffrys.
Well, they all went away, and though the attempt
was desperate, yet they went about it warily as well as boldly. They were all well armed, for every man
had a fusil or musket, a bayonet, and a pistol. Some
of them had broad cutlasses, some of them hangers,
and the boatswain, and two more, had poleaxes;
besides which, they had among them thirteen hand-
grenadoes. Bolder fellows, and better provided,
never went about any wicked work in the world.
When they went out, their chief design was plun-
der, and they were in hopes of finding gold there;
but a circumstance, which none of them were aware
of, set them on fire with revenge, and made devils of
of them all. They went on a little way, and found a
cow tied to a tree; this they presently concluded
would be a good guide to them, for they said the
cow certainly belonged to the town before them, and
if they untied her, they should see which way she
went; if she went back, they had nothing to say to
her, but if she went forward, they had nothing to do
but to follow her. So they cut the cord, which was
made of twisted flags, and the cow went on before
them, and led them directly to the town, which, as
they reported, consisted of above two hundred houses,
or huts. Here they found all silent, as profoundly
secure as sleep, and a country that had never seen an
enemy of that kind, could make them. Upon this
they called another council, to consider what they
had to do, and, in a word, they resolved to divide
themselves into three bodies, and to set three houses
on fire, in three parts of the town: and as the men
came out, to seize and bind them, if any resisted,
they need not be asked what to do then; and so to
search the rest of the houses for plunder; but they
resolved to march first silently through the town, and
see what dimensions it was of, and consider if they
might venture upon it, or no. They did so, and des-
perately resolved that they would venture upon
them; but while they were animating one another
to the work, three of them that were a little before
the rest called out aloud, and told them that they
2 A 2
had found Thomas Jeffrys. They all ran up to the
place, and so it was indeed, for there they found the
poor fellow hanged up by one arm, and his throat
cut. There was an Indian house just by the tree,
where they found sixteen or seventeen of the principal
Indians, who had been concerned in the fray with ns
before, and two or three of them wounded with our
shot; and our men found they were awake.
The sight of their poor mungled comrade so enraged them, that they swore to one another they would be
revenged, and that not an Indian who came into
their hands should have quarter; and to work they
went immediately. Their first care was to get some-
thing that would soon take fire; so they presently
made some wildfire, by wetting a little powder in
the palms of their hands, and, in a quarter of an
hour, they set the town on fire in four or five places,
and particularly that house where the Indians were
not gone to bed. As soon as the fire began to blaze,
the poor frighted creatures began to rush out to save
their lives, but met with their fate in the attempt,
and especially at the door, where they drove them
back, the boatswain himself killing one or two with
his poleaxe; the house being large, and many in it,
he did not care to go in, but called fora hand-grenado.
and threw it among them, which, at first, frightened
them, but when it burst, made such havoc among
them, that they cried out in a hideous manner.
In short, most of the Indians who were in the open
part of the house were killed or hurt with the gre-
nado, except two or three more, who pressed to the
door, which the boatswain and two more kept with
their bayonets in the muzzles of their pieces, and
dispatched all that came that way. But there was
another apartment in the house, where the prince, or
king, or whatever he was, and several others, were;
and these they kept in till the house, which was, by
this time, all of a light flame, fell upon them, and
they were smothered or burned together.
All this while they fired not a gun, because they
would not waken the people faster than they could
master them; but the fire began to waken them fast
enough, and our fellows were glad to keep a little
together in bodies, for the fire grew so raging, all the
houses being made of light, combustible stuff, that
they could hardly bear the street between them, and
their business was to follow the fire for the surer
execution. As fast as the fire either forced the
people out of those houses which were burning, or
frighted them out of others, our people were ready
at their doors to knock them on the head, still calling
to one another to remember Thomas Jeffrys.
While this was doing, I was very uneasy, and
especially when I saw the flames of the town, which,
it being night, seemed to be just by me. My nephew,
the captain, who roused by his men too, seeing such
a fire, was very uneasy, not knowing what the matter
was, or what danger I was in, especially hearing the
guns, for by this time they began to use their fire-
arms. At last. though he could ill spare any more
men, yet, not knowing what exigence we might be
in, he takes another boat, and, with thirteen men and
himself, comes on shore to me. He was surprised to
see me and the supercargo in the boat, with no more
than two men, for one had been left to keep the boat,
and though he was glad we were well, yet he was in
the same impatience with us to know what was
doing, for thenoise continued, and theflameincreased.
Nor was I any more able to stay behind now, than
I was to persuade them not to go before; so, in short,
the captain ordered two men to row back the pinnace,
and fetch twelve men more from the ship, leaving
the long boat at an anchor, and that, when they
came back, six men should keep the two boats, and
six more come after us, so that he left only sixteen
men in the ship; for the whole ship's company con-
sisted of sixty-five men, whereof two were lost in the
quarrel which brought this mischief on.
Being now on the march, you may be sure we felt
little of the ground we trod on, and being guided by
the fire, we kept no path, but went directly to the
place of the flame. If the noise of the guns was
surprising to us before, the cries of the poor people
were now quite of another nature, and filled us with
horror. However, we went on, and at length came
to the town, though there was no entering the streets
of it for the fire. The first object we met with was
the ruins of a hut, and just before it, plain now to be
seen by the light of the fire, lay four men and three
women killed, and, as we thought, one or two more
lay in a heap among the fire. In short, there were
such instances of a rage altogether barbarous, and
of a fury something beyond what was human, that
we thought it impossible our men could be guilty of
it, or, if they were the authors of it, we thought that
every one of them ought to be put to death.
Presently four of our men came up, with the boat-
swain at their head, running over the heaps of bodies
they had killed, all covered with blood and dust, as
if they wanted more people to massacre, when our
men hallooed to them, and they came up to us. As
soon as the boatswain saw us, he set up a shout of
triumph, for having, as he thought, more help come,
and, without bearing to hear me, "Captain," says he,
11 noble captain, I am glad you are come; we have
not half done yet. Villains! hell-hound dogs! I'll
kill as many of them as poor Tom has hairs upon his
head. We have sworn to spare none of them; we'll
root out the very nation of them from the earth!"
and thus he ran on, out of breath, too, with action,
and would not give us leave to speak a word. At
last, raising my voice, that I might silence him a
little, "Barbarous dog!" said I, "what are you
doing? I won't have one more creature touched,
upon pain of death. I charge you, upon your life, to
stop your hands, and stand still here, or you are a
dead man this minute." "Why, sir," says he, " do
you know what you do, or what they have done?
If you want a reason for what we have done, come
hither;" and with that he showed me the poor
fellow hanging up in a tree, with his throat cut.
I confess I was urged then myself, and at another
time should have been forward enough; but I thought
they had carried their rage too far, and thought of
Jacob's words to his sons Simeon and Levi, " Cursed
be their anger, for it was fierce; and their wrath, for
it was cruel!" But when the men I carried with me
saw the sight, as I had done, I had as much to do to
restrain them, as I should have had with the others;
nay, my nephew himself fell in with them, and told
me, in their hearing, that he was only concerned for
fear of the men being overpowered; for, as to the
people, he thought not one of them ought to live, for
they had all glutted themselves with the murder of
the poor man, and they ought to be used like mur-
derers. Upon these words, away ran eight of my
men, with the boatswain and his crew, to complete
their bloody work: and 1, seeing it quite out of my
power to restrain them, came (away pensive and sad.
I got nobody to come back with me but the super-
cargo and two men, and with these I walked back
to the boats. Immediately I took the pinnace, and
went aboard, and sent her back to assist the men in
what might happen. By the time that the men got
to the shore again with the pinnace, our men began
to appear; they came dropping in, one by one, in
such a manner, that a small force of resolute men
might have cut them all off.
The next day we set sail, so we never heard any
more of it. Our men differed in the account of the
number they killed, some said one thing, some ano-
ther; but, according to the best of their accounts
put all together, they killed, or destroyed, about one
hundred and fifty people, men, women, and children,
and left not a house standing in the town.
As for the poor fellow, Thomas Jeffrys, they took
him down from the tree where he was hanged by one
hand, and buried him there.
However just our men thought this action to be,
I was against them in it; and 1 always, after that
time, told them God would blast the voyage, for I looked upon the blood they shed that night to be
murder in them; for though it is true they killed
Thomas Jeffrys, yet it was true that Jeffrys bras the
aggressor, had broken the truce, and had violated, or
debauched a young woman of their's who came to our
camp innocently, and on the faith of their capitulation.
The boatswain defended this quarrel when we were
afterwards on board. He said it was true that we
seemed to break the truce, but really had not, and
that the war was begun the night before, by the
natives themselves, who had shot at us, and killed
one of our men, without any just provocation; so that
as we were in a capacity to fight them, we might
also be in a capacity to do ourselves justice upon
them in an extraordinary manner; that though the
poor man had taken a little liberty with a wench, he ought not to have been murdered, and that in such a
villainous manner; and that they did nothing but
what was just, and what the laws of God allowed to
be done to murderers.
But my frequent preaching to them on this subject
had worse consequences than I expected; and the
boatswain came up boldly to me one time, and told
me he found 1 continually brought that affair upon
the stage; that I made unjust reflections upon it,
and had used the men very ill on that account, ana
himself in particular; that as I was but a passenger,
and had no command in the ship, or concern in the
voyage, they were not obliged to bear it; that they
did not know but I might have some ill design in
my head, and, perhaps, to call them to account for it when they came to England; and that, therefore,
unless I would resolve to have done with it, and also
not to concern myself any further with him, or any
of his affairs, he would leave the ship; for he did not
think it was safe to sail with me among them.
I heard him patiently enongh till he had done, and
then told him, that I did confess I had all along
opposed the massacre of Madagascar, for such I
would always call it; and that I had, on all occa-
sions, spoken mymind freely about it, though not
more upon him than any of the rest; that as to my
having no command in the ship, that was true, nor
did I exercise my authority, only took the liberty of
speaking my mind in things which publicly concerned
us all; as to what concern I had in the voyage, that
was none of his business; that 1 was a considerable
owner in the ship, and in that claim I conceived I had a right to speak, even farther than I had yet
done, and would not be accountable to him, or any
one else, and began to be a little warm with him.
He made bu* little reply to me at that time, and I
thought that affair had been over. We were at this
time in the road at Bengal; and, being willing to
see the place, I went on shore with the supercargo,
in the ship's boat, to divert myself, and towards
evening was preparing to go on board, when one of
'the men came to me, and told me, he would not have
me trouble myself to come down to the boat, for they
had orders not to carry me on board. Any one may
guess what a surprise I was in at so insolent a mes-
sage; and I asked the man who bade him deliver
that errand to me. He told me the cockswain. 1
said no more to the fellow, but bade him let them
know he had delivered his message, and that I had
given him no answer to it.
I immediately went, and found out the supercargo,
and told him the story, and, adding what I presently
foresaw, viz. that there would certainly be a mutiny
in the ship, and entreated him to go immediately on
board the ship, in an Indian boat, and acquaint the
captain of it. But I might have spared this intelli-
gence, for, before I had spoken to him on shore, the
matter was effected on board. The boatswain, the
gunner, the carpenter, and, in a word, all the inferior
officers, as soon as I was gone off in the boat, came
up to the quarter-deck, and desired to speak with
the captain; and there the boatswain, making a long
harangue, and repeating all he had said to me,
told the captain, that as I was now gone peaceably
on shore, they were loath to use any violence with
me, which, if I had not gone on shore, they would
otherwise have done, to oblige me to have gone.
They therefore thought fit to tell him, that as they
shipped themselves to serve in the ship, under his
command, they would perform it faithfully; but if I would not quit the ship, or the captain oblige me to
quit it, they would all leave the ship, and sail no
farther with him. And at that word, "all," he
turned his face about, towards the mainmast, which
was, it seems, the signal agreed on between them;
at which all the seamen being got together, they
cried out," One and all! One and all!"
My nephew the captain, was a man of spirit, and
of great presence of mind, and though he was sur-
prised at the thing, yet he told them calmly, he
would consider the matter, but that we could do
nothing in it till he had spoken to me about it. So
away he came to me with this account, a little after
the message came to me from the cockswain.
I was very glad to see my nephew, I must confess,
for I was not without apprehensions, that they would
confine him by violence, set sail, and run away with
the ship; and then I had been stripped naked in a
remote country, and nothing to help myself to. In
short, I had been in a worse case than when I was
all alone in the island. But they had not gone that
length, it seems, to my great satisfaction; and my
nephew told me what they had said to him, and how
they had sworn, and shook hands, that they would
all leave the ship, if I was suffered to come on
board. I told him he should not be concerned at it
at all, for I would stay on shore. I only desired he
would take care and send all my necessary things on
shore, and leave me a sufficient sum of money, and I
would find my way to England as well as I could.
This was a heavy piece of news to my nephew, but
there was no way, but to comply with it. So he went
on board the ship again, and satisfied the men that
his uncle had yielded to their importunity, and had
sent for his goods from on board the ship. So the
matter was over in a few hours, the men returned to
their duty, and I began to consider what course I
should steer.
I was now alone in the remotest part of the world,
as I think I may call it, for I was near three thou-
sand leagues by sea farther off from England than I was at my island; only, it is true, I might travel
here by land over the Great Mogul's country to Surat,
might go from thence to Bassora by sea, up the Gulf
of Persia, and from thence might take the way of the
caravans, over the deserts of Arabia, to Aleppo and
Scanderoon: from thence by sea again to Italy, and
so overland into France: and this, put together,
might be, at least, a full diameter of the globe.
My nephew left me two servants, or rather one
companion, and one servant; the first was clerk to
the purser, whom he engaged to go with me, and the
other was his own servant. I took a good lodging
in the house of an Englishwoman, where several mer-
chants lodged, some French, two Italians, or rather
Jews, and one Englishman. Here I was handsomely
enough entertained; and that I might not be said to
run rashly upon any thing, I stayed here above nine
months, considering what course to take, and how to
manage myself. I had some English goods with me
of value, and a considerable sum of money, my ne-
phew furnishing me with a thousand pieces of eight,
and a letter of credit for more, if I had occasion, that
I might not be straitened, whatever might happen.
I quickly disposed of my goods, and to advantage
too; and, as I originally intended, I bought here
some very good diamonds, which, of all other things,
was the most proper for me in my circumstances,
because I might always carry my estate about me.
The English merchant, who lodged with me, and
with whom I had contracted an intimate acquaint-
ance, came to me one morning: "Countryman," said
he, " I have a project to communicate to you, which,
as it suits my thoughts, may, for aught I know, suit
jour's also, when you shall have considered it.
"Here we are posted," says he, " you by accident,
and I by my own choice, in a part or' the world very
remote from our own country; but it is in a country
where, by us who understand trade and business, a
a great deal of money is to be got. If you will put
a thousand pounds to my thousand pounds, we will
hire a ship, the first we can get to our minds; you
shall be captain, I will be merchant, and we will go
a trading voyage to China."
I liked this proposal very well, and the more
because it seemed to be expressed with so much good
will, and in so friendly a manner. It was, however,
some time before we could get a ship to our mind,
and when we had got a vessel, it was not easy to get
English sailors; that is to say, so many as were ne-
cessary to govern the voyage, and manage the sailors
,which we should pick up there. After some time we
got a mate, a boatswain, and a gunner, English; a
Dutch carpenter, and three Portuguese foremast-
men; with these we found we could do well enough,
having Indian seamen, such as they were, to make up.
We made a very good voyage, and I got so much
money by the first adventure, and such an insight
into the method of getting more, that, had I been
twenty years younger, I should have been tempted
to have stayed here, and sought no farther for making
my fortune. But what was all this to a man on the
wrong side of threescore, that was rich enough, and
came abroad more in obedience to a restless desire of
seeing the world, than a covetous desire of gain
in it.
My friend now proposed another voyage to me, viz.
among the Spice Islands, and to bring home a load
of cloves from the Manillas, or thereabouts, places
where, indeed, the Dutch do trade, but the islands
partly belong to the Spaniards; though we went not
so far, but to some other, where they have not
the whole power, as they have at Batavia, Ceylon,
&c. We were not long in preparing for this voyage,
which we made very successfully, touching at Borneo,
and several islands whose names I do not remember,
and came home in about five months. We sold our
spice, which was chiefly cloves, and some nutmegs,
to the Persian merchants, who carried them to the
Gulf, and, making near five of one, we really got a
great deal of money.
A little while after this, there came in a Dutch
ship from Batavia; she was a coaster, not a European
trader, and of about two hundred tons burden. The
men, as they pretended, having been so sickly, that
the captain had not men enough to go to sea with, he
lay by at Bengal; and, as if having got money enough,
or being willing, for other reasons, to go to Europe,
he gave public notice that he would sell his ship.
This came to my ears before my new partner heard
of it, and I had a great mind to buy it. So I went
home to him, and told him of it. He considered
awhile, for he was no rash man neither, but, musing
some time, he replied, "She is a little too big; but, however, we will have her." Accordingly we bought
the ship, and, agreeing with the master, we paid for
her, and took possession. When we had done so, we
resolved to entertain the men, if we could, to join
with those we had, for the pursuing our business;
but, on a sudden, they having not received their
wages, but their share" of the money, as we after-
wards learned, not one of them was to be found.
We inquired about them, and, at length, were told
that they were all gone together by land to Agra, the
great city of the Mogul's residence, and from thence
were to travel to Surat, and so by sea to the Gulf
of Persia.
Nothing so heartily troubled me a good while, as
that I missed the opportunity of going with them,
for such a ramble, I thought, and in such company as
would both have guarded me and diverted me, would
have suited mightily with my great design, and I
should both have seen the world, and gone homewards
too. But I was much better satisfied a few days after,
when I came to know what sort of fellows they were,
for, in short, their history was, that this man they
called captain was the gunner only, not the com-
mander; that they had been a trading voyage, in
which they were attacked on shore by some of the
Malays, who had killed the captain, and three of his
men, and that after the captain was killed, these men
eleven in number, had resolved to run away with the
ship, which they did, and had brought her in at the
bay of Bengal, leaving the mate and five men more
on shore, of whom we shall hear farther.
Well, let them come by the ship how they would,
we came honestly by her, as we thought; though we
did not, I confess, examine into things so exactly as
we ought, for we never inquired any thing of the
seamen, who, if we had examined, would certainly
have faltered in their accounts, contradicted one ano-
ther, and perhaps contradicted themselves; or one
way or other, we should have seen reason to have sus-
pected them; but the man shewed us a bill of sale
for the ship, to one Emanuel Clostershoven, or some
such name (for, I suppose, it was all a forgery), and
called himself by that name, and we could not con-
tradict him; and being withal a little too unwary, or,
at least, having no suspicion of the thing, we went
through with our bargain.
However, we picked up some English seamen here
after this, and some Dutch, and we now resolved for
a second voyage to the south-east, for cloves, &C., that is to say, among the Phillipine and Malacca
isles; and, ia short, 1 spent, from first to last, six
years in this country, trading from port to port, back-
ward and forward, and with very good success, and
was now the last year, with my partner, going in the
ship above-mentioned on a voyage to China, oat de-
signing first to go to Siam to buy rice.
In this voyage, being, by contrary winds, obliged
to beat up and down a great while in the Straits of
Malacca, and among the islands, we were no sooner
got clear of those difficult seas but wefound our ship
had sprung a leak, and we were not able, by all our
industry to find out where it was. This forced us to
make for some port, and my partner, who knew the
country better than I did, directed the captain to put
into the river of Cambodia, for I had made the En-
glish mate, one Mr. Thomson, captain, not being
willing to take the charge of the ship myself. The
river lies on the north side of the bay or gulf which
goes up to Siam.
While we were here, and going often on shore for
refreshment, there comes to me one day an English-
man, and he was, it seems, a gunner's mate on board
an English East India ship, which rode in the same
river, up at, or near the city of Cambodia; what
brought him hither we knew not, but he comes up to
me, and, speaking in English," Sir," said he," you are
a stranger to me, and I to you, but I have something
to tell you that very nearly concerns you. But the
short of the story is this, the first part of which I
suppose you know well enough, viz. that you were
with this ship at Sumatra; that there your captain
was murdered by the Malays, with three of his men;
and that you, or some of those that were on board
with you, ran away with the ship, and are since
turned pirates. This is the sum of the story; but
assure yourself, if you do not put to sea immediately,
you will, the very next tide, be attacked by five
boats full of men; and, perhaps, if you are taken,
you will be hanged for a pirate. If you have any
regard for your life, and the lives of all your men,
put out to sea without fail at high water; and as
you will be gone too far out before they can come
down; for they will come away at high water; and
as they have twenty miles to come, you get near two
hours start of them by the difference of the tide, not
reckoning the length of the way; besides, as they
are boats and not ships, they will not venture to
follow you far out to sea, especially if it blows."
"Well," said 1, " you have been very kind in this:
what shall I do for you, to make you amends?"
"Sir," says he, "you may not be so willing to make
me amends, because you may not be convinced of the
truth of it. I'll make an offer to you; I have nine-
teen months pay due to me on board the ship ,
which I came out of England in; and a Dutchman
that is with me has seven months pay due to him; if
you will make good our pay to us, we will go along
with you; if you find nothing more in it, we will
desire no more; but if we do convince you that we
have your life, and the ship, and the lives of all the
men in her, we will leave the rest to you."
I consented to this readily, and went immediately
on board, and the two men with me. As soon a« I came to the ship's side, my partner, who was on
board, came out on the quarter-deck, and called to
me with great joy, "O ho! O ho ! we have stopped
the leak!"—"Say"you so," said I ; "thank God; but
weigh the anchor immediately."—" Weigh!" says
he, " what do you mean by that? what is the matter?"
says he. "Ask no questions," said 1, "but all hands .
to work, and weigh without losing a minute." He
was surprised; but, however, he called the captain,
and he immediately ordered the anchor to be got lip;
and though the tide was not quite done, yet a little
land-bree~ze blowing, we stood out to sea. Then I called him into the cabin, and told him the story in
general 4 and we called in the men, and they told us
the rest of it; but as it took up a great deal of time,
so before we had done, a seaman comes to the cabin
door, and calls out to us, that the captain bade him
tell us we were chased. "Chased?" said I, " by
whom, and by what?"—" By five sloops, or boats,"
said the fellow, " full of men."—" Very well," said
I, "then it is apparent there is something in it." In
the next place, I ordered all our men to be called up,
and told them that there was a design to seize the
ship, and to take us for pirates, and asked them if
they would stand by us, and by one another. The
men answered cheerfully that, one and all they would
live and die with us. Then I asked the captain what
way he thought best for us to manage a fight with
them, for resist them I resolved we would, and that
to the last drop. He said readily, that the way was
to keep them off with our great shot as long as we
could, and then to fire at them with our small arms,
to keep them from boarding us; but when neither of
these would do any longer, we should retire to our
close quarters: perhaps they had not materials to
break open our bulk-heads, or get in upon us.
The gunner had, in the mean time, orders to bring
two guns to bear fore and aft, out of the steerage, to
clear the deck, and load them with musket-bullets
and small pieces of old iron, and what came next to
hand; and thus we made ready for fight, but all this
while kept out to sea, with wind enough, and could
see the boats at a distance, being five large long-
boats, following us with all the sail they could make.
Two of these boats, which by our glasses we could
see were English, had outsailed the rest, were near
two leagues a-head of them, and gained upon us con-
siderably, so that we found they would come up with
us; upon which we fired a gun without a shot to
intimate that they should bring to, and we put out a
flag of truce as a signal for parley; but they kept
crowding after us till they came within shot. Upon
SB
this we took in our white flag, they having made no
answer to it, hung out the red flag, and fired at them
with shot. Notwithstanding this, they came on till
they were near enough to call to them with a speak-
ing trumpet which we had on board, so we called to
them, and bade them keep off at their peril. It was all one: they crowded after us, and endedvoured to come under our stern, so to board us on our
quarter; upon which, seeing they were resolute for
mischief, and depended upon the strength that fol-
lowed them, I ordered to bring the ship to, so that
they lay upon our broadside, when immediately we
fired five guns at them, one of which had been le-
velled so true as to carry away the stern of the hin-
dermost boat, and bring them to the necessity of
taking down their sail, and running all to the head
of the boat, to keep her from sinking; so she lay by,
and had enough of it; but seeing the foremost boat
crowd still on after us, we made ready to fire at her
in particular.
While this was doing, one of the three boats that
were behind, being forwarder than the other two,
made up to the boat which we had disabled, to relieve
her, and we could afterwards see her take out her men.
We called again to the foremost boat, and offered a
truce to parley again, and to know what was her
business with us, but had no answer, only she crowded
close under our stern. Upon this our gunner, who
was a very dexterous fellow, ran out his two chase-
guns, and fired at her; but the shot missing, the men
in the boat shouted, waved their caps, and came on;
but the gunner getting quickly ready again, fired
among them the second time, one shot of which,
though it missed the boat itself, yet it fell in among
the men, and we could easily see had done a great deal of mischief among them; but we taking no
notice of that, weared the ship again, and brought
our quarter to bear upon them, and, firing three guns
more, we found the boat was split almost to pieces;
in particular, her rudder and a piece of her stern were
shot quite away; so they handed their sail immedi-
ately, and were in great disorder. But, to complete
their misfortune, our gunner let fly two guns at them
again; where he hit them we could not tell, but we
found the boat was sinking, and some of the men
already in the water. Upon this I immediately man-
ned out our pinnace, which we had kept close by our
side, with orders to pick up some of the men if they
could, and save them from drowning, and immedi-
ately to come on board with them, because we saw
the rest of the boats began to come up. Our men in
the pinnace followed their orders, and took up three
men, one of whom was just drowning, and it was a
good while before we could recover him. As soon as
they were on board, we crowded all the sail we could
make, and stood farther out to sea, and we found
that when the other three boats came up to the first
two, they gave over their chase.
Being thus delivered from a danger which, though
I knew not the reason of it, yet seemed to be much
greater than I had apprehended, I took care that we
would change our course, and not let any one imagine
whither we were going; so we stood out to sea east-
ward, quite out of the course of all European ships,
whether they were bound to China, or any where else
within the commerce of the European nations, and
resolved to go away to the coast of Tonquin, and so
on to China, and from thence, pursuing the first
design as to trade, find some way or other to dispose of
the ship, and come back in some of the vessels of the
country, such as we could get. This was approved
of as the best method for our security; and accord-
ingly we steered away N.N.E., keeping above fifty
leagues off from the usual course to the eastward.
This, however, put us to some inconveniences; for,
first, the winds, when we came to that distance from
the shore, seemed to be more steadily against us,
blowing almost trade, as we call it, from the east,
2 B 2
and E. N. E., so that we were a long while upon our
voyage; and we were but ill provided with victuals
for so long a run; and, which was still worse, there
was some danger that those English and Dutch ships,
whose boats pursued us, whereof some were bound
that way, might be got in before us, and, if not, some
other ship bound to China might have information of
us from them, and pursue us with the same vigour.
However, after a tedious and irregular course, and
very much straitened for provisions, we came within
sight of the coast very early in the morning; and,
upon reflecting on the circumstances we were in,
and the danger, if we had not escaped, we resolved
to put into a small river, which, however, had depth
enough of water for us, and to see if we could, either
over land, or by the ship's pinnace, come to know
what ships were in any port thereabouts. The place
we Were in was wild and barbarous, the people thieves,
even by occupation or profession: and though, it is
true, we had not much to seek of them, and, except
getting a few provisions, cared not how little we had
to do with them, yet it was with much difficulty that
we kept ourselves from being insulted by them.
I have observed above, that our ship sprang a leak
at sea, and that we could not find it out; and, how-
ever it happened, that, as I have said, it was stopped
unexpectedly, in the happy minute of our being to be
seized by the Dutch and English ships near the bay
of Siam; yet as we did not find the ship so perfectly
tight and sound as we desired, we resolved, while we
were in this place, to lay her on shore, take out what
heavy things we had on board, which were not many,
and to wash and clean her bottom, and, if possible,
to find out where the leaks were.
Accordingly, having lightened the ship, and
brought all bur guns, and other moveable things, to
one side, we tried to bring her down, that we might
come at her bottom: for on second thoughts we did
not think fit to lay her dry aground.
The inhabitants who had never been acquainted
with such a sight, came wandering down to the shore
to look at us, and seeing the ship lie down on one side
in such a manner, and heeling towards the shore, and
not seeing our men, who were at work on her bottom
with stages, and with their boats on the off side, they
presently concluded that the ship was cast away, and
so lay fast on the ground.
On this supposition, they came all about us in two
or three hours' time, with ten or twelve large boats,
having some of them eight, some ten men, in a boat,
intending no doubt, to have come on board and plun-
dered the ship, and, if they had found us there, to
have carried us away for slaves to their king, or
whatever they call him, for we knew nothing who
was their governor.
When they came up to the ship, and began to row
round her, they discovered us all hard at work on
the outside of the ship's bottom and side, washing
and graving, as every seafaring man knows how.
. They stood for a while gazing at us, and we, who
were a little surprised, could not imagine what
their design was; but, being willing to be sure, we
took this opportunity to get some of us into the ship,
and others to hand down arms and ammunition to
those that were at work, to defend themselves with,
if there should be occasion: and it was no more than
need, for in less than a quarter of an hour's consul-
tation they agreed, it seems, that the ship was really
a wreck; that we were all at work, endeavouring to
save her, or to save our lives by the help of our boats,
and when we handed our arms into the boats, they
concluded, by that motion, that we were endeavour-
ing to save some of our goods. Upon this, they took
it for granted that all belonged to them; and away
they came directly upon our men, as if it had been
in a line of battle.
Our men, seeing so many of them, began to be
frightened, for we lay but in an ill posture to fight,
and cried out to us to know what they should do. I
immediately called to the men who worked upon the
stage to slip them down, and get up the side into the
ship, and bade those in the boat to row round aud
come on board; and those few of us who were on
board worked with all the strength and hands we
had to bring the ship to rights. But, however,
neither the men upon the stage, nor those in the boats,
could do as they were ordered, before the Cochin-
chinese were upon them, and with two of their boats
boarded our long-boat, and began to lay hold of the
men as their prisoners.
The first man they laid hold of was an English
seaman, a stout, strong fellow, who, having a musket
in his hand, never offered to fire it, but laid it down
in the boat, like a fool, as I thought. But he under-
stood his business much better than I could teach
him, for he grappled the Pagan, and dragged him by
main force out of their own boat into ours, where,
taking him by the two ears, he beat his head so
against the boat's gunnel, that the fellow died in-
stantly in his hands; and, in the mean time a Dutch-
man, who stood next, took up the musket, aud with
the butt-end of it so laid about him, that he knocked
down five of them, who attempted to enter the boat;
but this was little towards resisting twenty or thirty
men, who fearless, because ignorant of their danger,
began to throw themselves into the long-boat, where
we had but five men to defend it. But an accident
gave our men a complete victory, which deserved
our laughter rather than any thing else, and that
was this:—
Our carpenter being preparing to grave the outside
of the ship, as well as to pay the seams where he had
caulked her to stop the leaks, had got two kettles
just let down into the boat, one filled with boiling
pitch, and the other with rosin, tallow, and oil, and
such stuff as the shipwrights use for that work; and
the man that attended the carpenter had a great iron
ladle in his hand, with which he supplied the men
that were at work with that hot stuff: two of the
enemy's men entered the boat just where this fellow
stood, being in the foresheets; he immediately sa-
luted them with a ladlet'ul of the stuff, boiling hot,
which so burned and scalded them, being half naked.
that they roared out like two bulls, and, enraged with the pain, leaped both into the sea. The carpenter
saw it, and cried out, "Well done Jack, give them
some more of it;" when, stepping forward himself,
he takes one of their mops, and, dipping it into the
pitch-pot, he and his man threw it about them so
plentifully, that, in short, of all the men in three boats,
there was not one that was not scalded and burned
with it in a most frightful manner, and made such a
howling and crying, that I never heard a worse noise.
All the while this was doing, my partner and I ,
who managed the rest of the men on board, had with
great dexterity, brought the ship almost to rights,
and having gotten the guns into their places again,
the gunner called to me to bid our boats get out of
the way, for he would let fly among them. I called
back again to him, and bid him not offer to fire, for
the carpenter would do the work without him, but
bade him heat another pitch-kettle, which our cook,
who was on board, took care of. But the enemy was
so terrified with what they met with in their first
attack, that they would not come on again; and
some of them, that were farthest off, seeing the ship
swim, as it were, upright, began, as we supposed, to
see their mistake, and give over the enterprise, find-
ing it was not as they expected. Thus we got clear of
this merry fight: and, having gotten some rice, and
some roots, and bread, with about sixteen good big
hogs, on board two days before, we resolved to stay
here no longer, but go forward, whatever came of it.
We, therefore, got all our things on board the same
evening, and the next morning were ready to sail. We would have gone into the bay of Tonquin, for we
wanted to inform ourselves of what was to be known
concerning some Dutch ships that had been there,
but we durst not stand in there, because we had seen
several ships go in, as we supposed, a little before.
So we kept on N.E. towards the Isle of Formosa, as
much afraid of being seen by a Dutch or English
merchant ship, as a Dutch or English merchant ship
in the Mediterranean is of an Algerine man of war.
When we were thus got to sea, we kept on N.E.
as if we would go to the Manillas, or the Philippine
islands, and this we did that we might not fall into.
the way of any of the European ships: and then we
steered north again, till we came to the latitude of
twenty-two degrees twenty minutes, by which means
we made the island of Formosa directly, where we
came to an anchor, in order to get water and fresh
provisions, which the people there, who are very
courteous and civil in their manners, supplied us
with willingly, and dealt very fairly and punctually
with us in all their agreements and bargains, which is
what we did not find among other people, and may
be owing to the remains of Christianity, which was
once planted here by a Dutch missionary of Pro-
testants. From hence we sailed still north, keeping
the coast of China at an equal distance, till we knew
we were beyond all the ports of China where our
European ships usually come, being resolved, if pos-
sible, not to fall into their hands, especially in this
country, where, as our circumstances were, we could
not fail of being entirely ruined.
Being now come into the latitude of thirty degrees,
we resolved to put into the first trading port we
should come at, and, standing in for the shore, a boat
came off two leagues to us, with an old Portuguese
pilot on board, who, knowing us to be a European
ship, came to offer his service, which, indeed, we
were very glad of, and took him on board. I began
to talk with him about carrying us to the Gulf of
Nanquin, which i> the most northern part of the
coast of China. The old man said he knew the Gulf
of Nanquin very well, but smiling, asked us what we
would do there.
I told him we would sell our cargo, and purchase
China wares, calicoes, raw silks, tea, wrought silks,
&c. and so would return by the same course we came.
He told us our best port had been to have put in at
Macao, where we could not fail of a market for our
opium to our satisfaction, and might, for our money,
have purchased all sorts of China goods as cheap as
we could at Nanquin. I told the old man we were
gentlemen, as well as merchants, and that we had a
mind to go and see the great city of Pekin, and the
famous court of the monarch of China. "Why then,"
says the old man, "you should go to Ningpo, where,
by the river which runs into the sea there, you may
go up within five leagues of the great canal. This
canal is a navigable made stream, which goes through
the heart of all the vast empire of China, crosses all
the rivers, passes some considerable hills by the help
of sluices and gates, and goes up to the city of Pekin,
being in length near two hundred and seventy
leagues." "Well," said I, "Seignior Portuguese,
but that is not our business now, the great question
is, if you can carry us up to the city of Nanquin,
from whence we can travel to Pekin afterwards."
He said he could do so very well, and there was a
great Dutch ship gone up that way just before. This
gave me a little shock: a Dutch ship was now our
terror, for we were in no condition to fight them; all
the ships they trade with in those parts being of
great burden, and of much greater force than we were.
The old man found me a little confused, and under
concern, when he named a Dutch ship, and said to
me, "Sir, you need be under no apprehension of the
Dutch, I suppose they are not now at war with
your nation."—" No," said I, " that's true, but I know
not what liberties men may take when they are out
of the reach of the laws of their own country."—
"Why," said he, "you are no pirates, what need
you fear? They will not meddle with peaceable mer-
chants, sure." I started at the word pirates, and he,
seeing my confusion, said, "Sir, I find you are in
some disorder in your thoughts at my talk ; pray be
pleased to go which way you may think fit, and,
depend upon it, I'll do you all the service I can."—-
"Why, seignior," said I, "it is true, I am a little
.nsettled in my resolution at this time, whither to go
in particular, and I am something more so for what
you said about pirates. I hope there are no pirates
in these seas; we are but in an ill condition to meet
with them, for you see we have but a small force,
and but very weakly manned." •
"O sir," said he, "do not be concerned; I do not
know that there have been any pirates in these seas
for fifteen years, except one, which was seen, as I
hear, in the bay of Siam, about a month since, but
you may be assured she is gone to the southward;
nor was she a ship of any great force, or fit for the
work; she was not built for a privateer, but was run
away with by a reprobate crew that were on board,
after the captain and some of his men had been
murdered by the Malays, at, or near the island of
Sumatra." "What!" said I, seeming to know no-
thing of the matter, " did they murder the captain?"
"No," said he, " I do not understand that they mur-
dered him; but, as they afterwards ran away with
the ship, it is generally believed that they betrayed
him into the hands of the Malays, who did murder
him, and, perhaps, they procured them to do it."—
"Why, then," said 1, t! they deserve death as much
as if they had done it themselves."—" Nay," said the
old man, "they do deserve it; and they will certainly
have it, if they light upon any English or Dutch
ship, for they have all agreed together, that if they
met that rogue, they will give him no quarter."
"But," said 1, "you say the pirate is gone out of
these seas; how can they meet with him then J"—
.
"Why, that's true," said he, "they do say so; but
he was, as I tell you, in the bay of Siam, in the river
Cambodia, and was discovered there by some Dutch-
men who belonged to the ship, and who were left on
shore when they ran away with her; and some
English and Dutch traders being in the river, they
were within a little of taking him. Nay," said he,
"if the foremost boats had been well seconded by the
rest, they had certainly taken him; but he, finding
only two boats within reach of him, tacked about,
and fired at these two, and disabled them before the
others came up: and then standing off to sea, the
others were not able to follow him, and so he got
away. But they have all so exact a description of
the ship, that they will be sure to know him, and,
wherever they find him, they have vowed to give no
quarter to either the captain or the seamen, but
hang them all up at the yard arm."
"What!" said I," will they execute them right or
wrong; hang them first, and judge them after-
wards?"—"O, sir," said the old pilot, " there is no
need to make a formal business of it with such rogues
as those; let them tie them back to back, and set
them a diving; it is no more than they rightly de-
serve."
I knew I had my old man fast on board, and that
he could do me no harm, so that I turned short upon
him:—" Well, now, seignior," said I, "and that is the
very reason why I would have you carry us to Nan-
quin, and not to put back to Macao, or to any other
part of the country where the English or Dutch ships
come ; for, be it known to you, seignior, those cap-
tains of English and Dutch ships are a parcel of rash.
proud, insolent fellows, that neither know what be-
longs to justice, nor how to behave themselves as the
laws of God or nature direct; but being proud of
their offices, and not understanding their power, they
would act the murderers to punish robbers, would
take upon them to insult men falsely accused, and
determine them guilty without due inquiry; and,
perhaps, I may live to call some of them to an ac-
count for it, where they may be taught how justice
is to be executed, and that no man ought to be treat-
ed as a criminal till some evidence may be had of the
crime, and that he is the man."
With this I told him, that this was the very ship
they had attacked, and gave him a full account of the
skirmish we had with their boats, and how foolishly
and coward-like they behaved. I told him the story
of our buying the ship, and how the Dutchmen ser-
ved us. I told him the reasons I had to believe this
story of killing the master by the Malays was not
true, as also the running away with the ship; but
that it was all a fiction of their own, to suggest that
the men turned pirates, and they ought to have been
sure that it was so before they had ventured to at-
tack us by surprise, and oblige us to resist them;
adding, that they would have the blood of those men,
who were killed there in our j ust defence, to answer
for. The old man was amazed at this relation, and
told us we were very much in the right to go away
to the north, and that, if he might advise us, it should
be to sell the ship in China, which we might very
well do, and buy or build another in the country.
"And," said he, "though you will not get so good
a ship, yet you may get one able enough to carry
you and all your goods back again to Bengal, or any
where else.
I told him I would take his advice, when I came
to any port where I could find a ship for my turn, or
get any customer to buy this. He replied, I should
meet with customers enough for the ship at Nanquin,
and that a Chinese junk would serve me very well to
go back again: and that he would procure me people
both to buy the one and sell the other.
"Well, but, seignior," says I, "as you say they
know the ship so well, I may, perhaps, if I follow
your measures, be instrumental in bringing some
honest, innocent men into a terrible broil, and per-
haps, occasion their being murdered in cold blood;
for, wherever they find the ship, they will prove the
guilt of the men by proving this was the ship, and so
innocent men may probably be overpowered and
murdered."—" Why, said the old man, "I'll find
out a way to prevent that also; for as I know all
those commanders you speak of very well, and shall
see them all as they pass by, I will be sure to set
them to rights in the thing." We were now at the
south-west point of the great Gulf of Nanquin, and
I asked the old pilot if there was no creek, or har-
bour that I could put into, and pursue my business
with the Chinese privately, and be in no danger of
the enemy. He told me if I would sail to the south-
ward, about two-and-forty leagues, there was a little
port, called Quinchang, where the fathers of the
mission usually landed from Macao, on their progress
to teach the Christian religion to the Chinese, and
where no European ships ever put in, and if I put in
there, I might consider what farther course to take
when I was on shore. He confessed it was not a
place for merchants, except that at some certain
times, they had a kind of fair there, when the mer-
chants from Japan came over there to buy merchan-
dises. So we agreed to go back to this place.
I was joyful, and, I may say, thankful, when I set
my foot safe on shore, resolving, and my partner too,
that, if it was possible to dispose of ourselves and
effects any other way, though not every way to our
satisfaction, we would never set foot on board that
unhappy vessel more, and, indeed, I must acknow-
ledge, that of all the circumstances of life that ever
I had any experience of, nothing makes mankind so
completely miserable as that of being in constant fear.
I cannot refrain taking notice here what reflections
I now had upon the past variety of my particular
circumstances; how hard I thought it was, that I,
who had spent forty years in a life of continued dif-
or haven which all men drive at—viz. to have rest
and plenty—should be a volunteer in new sorrows,
by my own unhappy choice; and that I, who had
escaped 90 many dangers in youth, should now come
to be hanged in my old age, and in so remote a
place, for a crime I was not in the least inclined to,
much less guilty of, and in a place and circumstance
where innocence was not like to be any protection at
all to me.
I was greatly cast down with these thoughts; but
sometimes natural courage would take its place, and
then I would be talking myself up to vigorous reso-
lutions, that I would not be taken to be barbarously
used by a parcel of merciless wretches; that it was
much better to have fallen into the hands of the
savages, who were men-eaters, and who, I was sure,
would feast upon me, when they had taken me, than
by those who would, perhaps, glut their rage upon
me by inhuman tortures and barbarities; that, in
the case of the savages, I always resolved to die
fighting to the last gasp, and why should I not do
so now, seeing it was much more dreadful, to me, at
least, to think of falling into these men's hands, than
ever it was to think of being eaten by men; for the
savages, to give'them their due, would not eat a man
till he was dead, but that these men had many arts
beyond the cruelty of death. And thus I tormented
myself with various thoughts for some time.
When we had got safe on shore, the old pilot, who
was now our friend, got us a lodging, and a ware-
house for our goods; it was a little house, or hot,
with a large house joining to it, all built with canes,
and palisadoed round with large canes, to keep out
pilfering thieves, of which, it seems, there were not a
few in the country. However, the magistrates
allowed us also a little guard, and we had a soldier,
with a kind of halbert, or half-pike, who stood senti-
nel at our door, to whom we allowed a pint of rice,
and a little piece of money, about the value of three-
pence per day, so that our goods were kept very safe.
The fair, or mart, usually kept in this place, had
been over some time; however, we found that there
were three or four junks in the river, and two Ja-'
panese, I mean ships from Japan, with goods which
they had bought in China, and were not gone away,
having Japanese merchants on shore. The first thing
our old Portuguese pilot did for us, was to bring us
acquainted with three missionary Romish priests,
who were in the town, and who had been some time,
converting the people to Christianity. One of these
was a Frenchman, whom they called Father Simon;
he was a jolly, well-conditioned man, very free in his
conversation, not seeming so serious and grave as the
other two did, one of whom was a Portuguese, and
the other a Genoese: but Father Simon was cour-
teous, easy in his manner, and very agreeable com-
pany; the other two were more reserved, seemed
rigid and austere, and applied seriously to the work
they came about, viz. to talk with, and insinuate
themselves among the inhabitants, whenever they
had opportunity. We often eat and drank with those
men, and though I must confess the conversion, as
they call it, of the Chinese to Christianity, is so far
from the true conversion required to bring heathen
people to the faith of Christ, that it seems to amount
to little more than letting them know the name of
Christ, say some prayers to the Virgin Mary and her
Son, in a tongue which they understand not, and to
cross themselves, and the like.
But to return to my story: this French priest,
Father Simon, was appointed, it seems, by order of
the chief of the mission, to go up to Pekin, the royal
seat of the Chinese emperor, and waited only for
another priest, who was ordered to come to him from
Macao, to go along with him; and we scarce ever
met together but he was inviting me to go that jour-
ney with him, telling me how he would show me all
the glorious things of that mighty empire, and, among; the rest, the greatest city in the world; "a city,"
said he, " that your London and our Paris put toge-
ther cannot be equal to." This was the city of Pekin,
which, I confess, is very great, and full of,people.
Dining with the priest one day, and being very
merry together, I showed some little inclination to
go with him, and he pressed rue and my partner very
hard, and with a great many persuasions, to consent.
"Why, Father Simon," says my partner, "why do
should desire our company so much? You know we
are heretics, and you do not love us, nor can keep us
company, with any pleasure."—" Oh," says he, " you
may, perhaps, be good Catholics in time: my busi-
ness here is to convert heathens, and who knows but
I may convert you too?" "Very well, father," said
I, "so you will preach to us all the way." "I will
not be troublesome to you," said he, "our religion
does not divest us of good manners; besides, we are
here like countrymen, and so we are compared to the
place we are in; and if you are Hugonots, and I a
Catholic, we may be all Christians at last; at least
we are all gentlemen, and we may converse so without
being uneasy to one another."
We had all this while our ship and our merchandise
to dispose of, and we began to be very doubtful what
we should do, for we were now in a place of very
little business; and once I was about to venture to
sail for the river Kilam, and the city of Nanquin;
but Providence seemed now more visibly, as I thought
than ever to concern itself in our affairs, and I was encouraged from this time to think I should, one way
or other, get out of this tangled circumstance, and
be brought home to my own country again, though I
had not the least view of the manner; and when I
began sometimes to think of it, could not imagine
by what method it was to be done. Providence, I
say, began here to clear up our way a little, and the
first thing that offered was, that our old Portuguese
pilot brought a Japan merchant to us, who began to
inquire what goods we had; and, in the first place, he bought all our opium, and gave us a very good
price for it, paying us in gold, by weight, some in
small pieces of their own coin, and some in small
wedges, of about ten or eleven ounces each. While
we were dealing with him for our opium, it came into
my head that he might, perhaps, deal with us for the
ship too; and I ordered the interpreter to propose it
to him. He shrugged up his shoulders at it, when it
was first proposed to him, but a few days after, he
came to me, with one of the missionary priests for his
interpreter, and told me he had a proposal to make
to me, and that was this; he had bought a great
quantity of goods of us, when he had no thoughts
at all of buying the ship, and that, therefore, he
had not money enough to pay for the ship, but if I
would let the same men who were in the ship navigate
her, he would hire the ship to go to Japan, and would
send them from thence to the Phillippine Islands with
another loading, which he would pay the freight of,
before they went from Japan, and that at their return
he would buy the ship.
The first thing we had to do was to consult the
captain of the ship, with the men, and know if
they were willing to go to Japan; and while I was
doing this, the young man whom, as I said, my
nephew had left with me as my companion for my
travels, came to me, and told me, that he thought
that voyage promised very fair, and that there was a
great prospect of advantage, and he would be glad
if I undertook it; but that if I would not, and would
give him leave, he would go as a merchant, or how I
pleased to order him; that if ever he came to
England, and I was there, and alive, he would render
me a faithful account of his success, and it should be
as much mine as I pleased.
I was really loath to part with him, but considering
the prospect of advantage, which was very con-
2 c
siderable, and that he was a young fellow as likely to
do well in it as any I knew, I inclined to let him go:
but first I told him I would consult my partner, and
five him an answer the next day. My partner and
discoursed about it, and my partner made a most
generous offer. He told me, "You know it has been an unlucky ship, and we both resolved not to go to
sea in it again ; if your steward (so he called my man)
will venture the voyage, PO leave my share of the
vessel to him, and let him make the best of it, and if
we live to meet in England, and he meets with suc-
cess abroad, he shall account for one half of the profits
of the ship's freight to us, the other shall be his own."
If my partner, who was no way. concerned with
my young man, made him such an offer, I could do
no less than offer him the same; and all the ship's
company being willing to go with him, we made over
half the ship to him in property, and took a writing
from him, obliging him to account for the other; and
away he went to Japan. The Japan merchant proved
a very punctual, honest man to him, protected him
at Japan, and got him a license to come on shore,
which the Europeans in general have not lately ob-
tained, paid him his freight very punctually, sent him
to the Philippines loaded with Japan and China
wares, and a supercargo of their own, who, trafficking
with the Spaniards, brought back European goods
again, and a great quantity of cloves and other spices ;
and there he was not only paid his freight very well,
and at a very good price, but being not willing to sell
the ship then, the merchant furnished him with goods
on his own account; that for some money, and some
spices of his own, which he brought with him, he
went back to the Manillas to the Spaniards, where
he sold his cargo very well. Here, having gotten a
good acquaintance at Manilla, he got his ship made
a free ship; and the governor of Manilla hired him
to go to Acapulco, in America, on the coast of Mexico,
and gave him a license to land there, and travel to
Mexico, and to pass in any Spanish ship to Europe
with all his men.
He made the voyage to Acapulco very happily, and
there he sold his ship: and having there also obtained
allowance to travel by land to Porto Bello, he found
means, somehow or other, to go to Jamaica with all
his treasure, and about eight years after came to
England exceeding rich.
In about four months, there was to be another fair
at that place where we -a ere, and then we might be
able to purchase all sorts of the manufactures of the
country, and, withal, might possibly find some Chi-
nese junks, or vessels, from Nanquin, that would be
to be sold, and would carry us and our goods whither
we pleased. This I liked very well, and resolved to
wait; besides, as our particular persons were not
obnoxious, so if any English or Dutch ships came
thither, perhaps we might have an opportunity to
load our goods, and get passage to some place in
India nearer home.
Upon these hopes we resolved to continue here;
but, to divert ourselves, we took two or three jour-
neys into the country. First, we went ten days'
journey to see the city of Nanquin, a city well worth
'seeing. They say it has a million of people in it,
which, however, I do not believe: it is regularly
built, the streets all exactly straight, and cross
one another in direct lines, which gives the figure of
it great advantage.
What are their buildings to the palaces and royal
buildings of Europe? What their trade to the uni-
versal commerce of England, Holland, France, and
Spain? What their cities to ours, for wealth, strength,
gaiety of apparel, rich furniture, and an infinite va-
riety? What are their ports, supplied with a few junks
and barks, to our navigation, our merchants' fleets,
our large and powerful navies? Our city of London
"as more trade than all their mighty empire. One
^English, or Dutch, or French man of war, of eighty
2 c 2
guns, would fight with, and destroy, all the shipping
of China. But the greatness of their wealth, their
trade, the power of their government, and strength
of their armies, is surprising to us; because, as I
have said, considering them as a barbarous nation of
Pagans, little better than savages, we did not expect
such things among them: and this indeed is the ad-
vantage with which all their greatness and power is
represented to us; otherwise it is in itself nothing at
all: for, as I have said of their ships, so may be said
of their armies and troops: all the forces of their
empire, though they were to bring two millions of
men into the field together, would be able to do no-
thing but ruin the country and starve themselves.
If they were to besiege a strong town in Flanders, or
fight a disciplined army, one line of German cuiras-
siers, or French cavalry, would overthrow all the
horse of China; a million of their foot could not stand
before one embattled body of our infantry, posted so
as not to be surrounded, though they were not above
a thousand in number; nay, I do not boast if I say
that thirty thousand German or English foot, and
ten thousand French horse, would fairly beat all the
forces of China. And so of our fortified towns, and
of the art of our engineers in assaulting and defending
towns: there is not a fortified town in China could
hold out one month against the batteries and attacks
of a European army; and, at the same time, all the
armies of China could never take such a town as
Dunkirk, provided it was not starved, no, not in a
ten years' siege. They have fire-arms, it is true,
but they are awkward, clumsy, and uncertain in
going off; they have powder, but it is of no strength:
they have neither discipline in the field, exercise to
their arms, skill to attack, nor temper to retreat:
and therefore I must confess it seemed strange to me,
when I came home, and heard our people say such
fine things of the power, riches, glory, magnificence,
and trade of the Chinese, because I saw and knew
that they were a contemptible herd, or crowd of
ignorant, sordid slaves, subjected to a government
qualified only to rule such a people.
I was now, as near as I can compute, in the heart
of China, about the latitude of thirty degrees north
of the line, for we were returned from Nanquin. I had indeed a mind to see the city of Pekin, which I
had heard so much of, and Father Simon importuned
me to doit. At length his time of going away being
set, and the other missionary, who was to go with
him, being arrived from Macao, it was necessary that
we should resolve either to go or not to go: so I re-
ferred him to my partner, and left it wholly to his
choice, who at length resolved it in the affirmative,
and we prepared for our journey.
We were five-and-twent> days travelling to Pekin,
through a country infinitely populous, but miserably
cultivated; the husbandry, economy, and the way of
living, all very miserable, though they boast so much
of their industry. The pride of these people is very
great, and exceeded by nothing but their poverty,
which adds to that which I call their misery. The
roads here are well paved, and well kept, and very
convenient for travellers; but nothing was more
awkward to me than to see such a haughty, imperi-
ous, insolent people, in the midst of the grossest sim-
plicity and ignorance, for all their famed ingenuity
is no more. My friend, Father Simon, and I, used
to be very merry on these occasions, to see the beg-
garly pride of those people; for example, coming by
the house of a country gentleman, as Father Simon
called him, about ten leagues off the city of Nanquin,
we had, first of all, the honour to ride with the mas-
ter of the house about two miles: the state he rode
in was a perfect Don Quixotism, being a mixture of
pomp and poverty. The habit of this greasy Don
was very proper for a scaramouch, or merry-andrew,
being a dirty calico, with all the tawdry trappings of
a fool's coat, such as hanging sleeves, taffety, and
cuts and slashes almost on every side. It covered a
rich taffety vest, as greasy as a butcher's, and which
testified that his honour most needs be a most exqui-
site sloven. His horse was a poor, lean. starved,
hobbling creature, such as in England might sell for
about thirty or forty shillings; and he had two slaves
followed him on foot to drive the poor creature along.
He had a whip in his hand, and he belaboured the
beast as fast about the head as his slaves did about
the tail ; and thus he rode by us with about ten or
twelve servants, and we were told he was going from
the city to his country seat, about half a league be- fore us. We travelled on gently, but this figure of a
gentleman rode away before us; and as we stopped
at a village about an hour to refresh us, when we
came by the country seat of this great man, we saw
him in a little place, before his door, eating his re-
past: it was a kind of garden, but he was easy to be
seen, and we were given to understand that the more
we looked on him the better he would be pleased.
He sat under a tree, something like the palmetto
tree, which effectually shaded him over the head.
He sat lolling back in a great elbow chair, being a
heavy, corpulent man; his meat being brought him
by two women slaves: he had two more, whose office,
I think, few gentlemen in Europe would accept of
their service in, viz. one fed the squire with a spoon,
and theother held thedish with one hand, and scraped
off what fell upon his worship's beard with the other;
while the great fat brute thought it below him to
employ his own hands in any of those familiar offices
which kings would rather do than be troubled with
the clumsy fingers of their servants. Leaving the
Cr wretch to please himself with our looking at
i, we pursued our journey.
I was now light-hearted, and all my trouble and
perplexity, that I have given an account of, being
over, I had no anxious thoughts about me, which
made this journey much the pleasanter to me; nor
did any ill accident attend me, only in the passing
or fording a small river, my horse fell, and made me
free of the country, as they call it, that is to say.
threw me in: the place was not deep, but it wetted
me all over. I mention it because it spoiled my
pocket-book, wherein I had set down the names of
several people and places which I had occasion to
remember, and which not taking due care of, the
leaves rotted, and the words were never after to be
read, to my great loss as to the names of some places
which I touched at in this voyage.
At length we arrived at Pekin. I had nobody
with me but the youth whom my nephew, the cap-
tain, had given me to attend as a servant, and who
proved very trusty and diligent; and my partner had
nobody with him but one servant, who was a kins-
man. As for the Portuguese pilot, he being desirous
to see the court, we bore his expenses, and, under-
standing the language, he acted as interpreter. About
a week after\ '.ve had arrived here, this old pilot came
to us, and told us he had some good news to tell us.
I asked him what it was, but it was some time before
we could get it out of him: at last he told us there
was a great caravan of Muscovite and Polish mer-
chants in the city, and they were preparing to set
out on their journey, by land, to Muscovy, within
four or five weeks, and he was sure we should take
the opportunity to go with them, and perhaps leave
him to get back to Macao as he could. I confess I was overjoyed at this intelligence; and asked him if
be was sure it was true. "Yes," said he, "I met
this morning, in the street, an old acquaintance of
mine, an Armenian, or one you call a Grecian, who
is among them; he came last from Astracan, and
was designing to go to Tonquin, where I formerly
knew him, but has altered his mind, and is now re-
solved to go back with the caravan to Moscow, and
so down the river of Wolga to Astracan?"—" Well,
seignior," said 1, do not be uneasy about being left to go back alone; if this be a method for my return
to England, it shall be your fault if you go back to
Macao at all." We then went to consulting together
what was to be done; and I asked my partner what
he thought of the pilot's news, and whether it would
suit with his affairs. He told me he would do just
as I would, for he had settled all his affairs so well
at Bengal, and left his effects in such good hands,
that as we had made a good voyage here, if he could
vest it in China silks, wrought and raw, such as
might be worth the carriage, he would be content
to go to England, and then make his voyage back to
Bengal by the Company's ships.
Having resolved upon this, we agreed that if our
Portuguese pilot would go with us, we would bear
his charges to Moscow, or to England, which he
pleased; nor indeed were we to be esteemed over
generous in that part neither, if we had not rewarded
him further ; for the service he had done us was really
worth all that, and more, for he had not only been
a pilot to us at sea, but he had been also like a broker
for us on shore; and his procuring for us the Japan
merchant was some hundreds of pounds in our pock-
ets. So we consulted together about it, and being
willing to gratify him, which was indeed but doing
him justice, and very willing also to have him with
us besides, for he was a most necessary man on all
occasions, we agreed to give him a quantity of coined
gold, which came to about one hundred and seventy-
five pounds sterling between us, and to bear his
charges, both for himself and horse, except only a
horse to carry his goods.
Having settled this among ourselves, we called
him to let him know what we had resolved. I told
him he had complained of our being like to let him
go back alone, and I was now to tell him we were
resolved he should not go back at all: that as we
had resolved to go to Europe with the caravan, we
resolved also he should go with us, and that we called
him to know his mind. He shook his head, and said
it was a long journey, and he had no money to carry
him thither, nor to subsist himself when he came
thither. We told him we believed it was so, and
therefore we had resolved to do something for him,
that should let him see how sensible we were of the
service he had done us; and then I told him what
we had resolved to give him here, which he might lay
out as we would pur own, and that for his expenses,
if he would go with us, we would set him safe ashore
either in Muscovy or England, at our own charge,
except only the carriage of his goods.
He received the proposal like a man transported,
and told us he would go with us over the whole
world; and so, in short, we all prepared ourselves
for the journey: but instead of being ready in five
weeks, it was more than four months before all things
were got together. During this time, my partner
and I disposed of all the goods we had left, and laid
in a large stock of Chinese goods, such as damasks,
fine silks, raw silks, fine calicoes, tea, nutmegs and
cloves, and a quantity of other things, amounting in
all to about four thousand pounds' worth. With these
goods we loaded eighteen camels, besides those we
rode upon, which, with two or three spare horses,
and two horses loaded with provisions, made us, in
short, twenty-six camels and horses in pur retinue.
We set out from Pekin at the beginning of Febru-
ary. The company was very great, and made between
three and four hundred horses and camels, and a
hundred and twenty men, very well armed, and pre-
pared for the bands of marauding Tartars, if any of
them should attack us. The company consisted of
several nations, such as Muscovites, Livonians, &C. ;
and, to our satisfaction, there were five Scotchmen,
who appeared to be men of great experience in busi-
ness, and of very good substance.
When we had travelled one day's journey, the
guides, who were five in number, called us all toge-
ther, except the servants, to a great council, at which
every one deposited a certain quantity of money to a
common stock, for the necessary expense of buying
forage on the way, where it was not otherwise to be
had, and for satisfying the guides, getting horses,
and the like. And here they appointed captains and
officers to draw us all up, and give the command in
case of attack: which we found needful upon the way.
The road on all this side of the country is very
populous, and is full of potters and earth-makers,
that is to say, people that tempered the earth for the
China ware; and, as I was going along, our Portu-
guese pilot, who had always something or other to
say to make us merry, came sneering to me, and told
me he would show us the greatest rarity in all the
country, and that I should have this to say of China,
after all the ill-humoured things I had said of it, that
I had seen one thing which was not to be seen in all
the world beside. I was very importunate to know
what it was: at last, he told me it was a gentleman's
house built with China ware. "Well," said 1, " are
not the materials of their buildings the product of
their own country? and so it is all China ware, is it
not ?"—" No, no," says he, " I mean it is a house all
made of China ware- such as you call so in England,
or, as it is called in pur country, porcelain."—" Well,"
said I, "such a thing may be. How big is it? Can
we carry it in a box upon a camel? If we can, we
will buy it."—" Upon a camel!" said the old pilot,
"why, there is a family of thirty people live in it."
I was then curious indeed to see it; and when I came
to it, I found it was a house built, as we call it in
England, with lath and plaster, bat all the plastering
was really China ware, that is to say it was plastered
with the earth that makes China ware.
The outside, which the sun shone hot upon, was
glazed, and looked very well, perfectly white, and
painted with blue figures, as the large China ware in
England is painted, and hard as if it had been burned
As to the inside, all the walls, instead of wainscot,
were lined up with hardened and painted tiles, like
the little square tiles we call galley-tiles in England,
all made of the finest China, and the figures exceed-
ingly fine indeed, with extraordinary variety of
colours, mixed with gold, many tiles making but one
figure, but joined so artificially with mortar, being
made of the same earth, that it was very hard to see
where the tiles met. The floors of the rooms were
of the same composition, and as hard as the earthen
floors we have in use in several parts of England;
the ceilings, and, in a word, all the plastering work
in the whole house, were of the same earth; and,
after all, the roof was covered with tiles of the same,
but of a deep, shining black.
This was a China warehouse indeed, truly and li-
terally to be called so; and had I not been upon the
journey, I could have stayed some days to see and
'examine the particulars of it. They told me there
were fountains and fish-ponds in the garden, all
paved at the bottom and sides with the same, and
fine statues set up in rows on the walks, entirely
formed of the porcelain earth, and turned whole.
As this is one of the singularities of China, so they
may be allowed to excel in it; but I am very sure
they excel in their accounts of it, for they told
me such incredible things of their performance
in crockery-ware, for such it is, that I care not to
relate, as knowing it could not be true. One told
me, in particular, of a workman that made a ship,
with all its tackle, and masts, and sails, in earthen-
ware, big enough to carry fifty men. If he had told
me, he launched it, and made a voyage to Japan in
it, I might have said something to it indeed; but, as
it was, I knew the whole story, which was, in short
asking pardon for the word, that the fellow lied. So
I smiled, and said nothing to it.
This odd sight kept me two hours behind the cara-
van, for which the leader of it for the day fined me
about the value of three shillings; and told me, if it
had been three days' journey without the wall, as it
was three davs within, he must have fined me four
times as much, and made me ask pardon the next
council day; so I promised to be more orderly, for
indeed I found afterwards the orders made for keep-
ing altogether were absolutely necessary for our
common safety.
In two days more we passed the great China wall,
made for a fortification against the Tartars: and a
very great work it is, going over hills and mountains
in an endless track, where the rocks are impassable, and the precipices such as no enemy could possibly
enter, or indeed climb up, or where, if they did, no
wall could hinder them. They tell us its length is
near a thousand English miles, but that the country
is five hundred in a straight measured line, which the
wall bounds, without measuring the windings and
turnings it takes: it is about four fathoms high, and
as many thick in some places.
After we had passed this mighty nothing, called
a wall, we began to find the country thinly inhabited,
and the people rather confined to live in fortified
towns aud cities, as being subject to the inroads and
depredations of the Tartars, who rob in great armies,
and therefore are not to be resisted by the naked in-
habitants of an open country.
And here I began to find the necessity of keeping
together in a caravan as we travelled; for we saw
several troops of Tartars roving about; but when I
came to see them distinctly, I wondered more that
the Chinese empire could be conquered by such con-
temptible fellows; for they are a mere herd, or crowd,
of wild fellows, keeping no order, and understanding
no discipline, or manner of fight.
Their horses are poor, lean, starved creatures,
taught nothing, and are fit for nothing; and this we
found the first day we saw them, which was after we
entered the wilder part of the country. Our leader
for the day gave leave for about sixteen of us to go
a hunting, as they call it; and what was this but
hunting of sheep! However, it may be called
hunting, too, for the creatures, are the wildest, and
swiftest of foot, that ever I saw of their kind, only
they will not run a great way: and you are sure of
sport when you begin the chase, for they appear
generally by thirty or forty in a flock, and, like true
sheep, always keep together when they fly.
In pursuit of this odd sort of game, it was our
hap to meet with about forty Tartars; whether they
were hunting mutton, as we were, or whether they
looked for another kind of prey, I know not; but as
soon as they saw us, one of them blew a kind of horn
very loud, but with a barbarous sound that I had
never heard before, and, by the way, never care to
hear again. We all supposed this was to call their
friends about them; and so it was, for in less than
a quarter of an hour a troop of forty or fifty more
appeared, at about a mile distance: but our work
was over first, as it happened.
One of the Scotch merchants of Moscow happened
to be amongst us; and as soon as he heard the horn,
he told us, in short, that we had nothing to do but to
charge them immediately, without loss of time, and,
drawing us up in a line, he asked if we were resolved?
We told him we were ready to follow him. They
stood gazing at us like a mere crowd, drawn up in no
order; but as soon as they saw us advance, they let
fly their arrows, which, however, missed us very hap-
pily. It seems they mistook not their aim, but their
distance, for their arrows all fell a little short of us,
but with so true an aim, that, had we been about
twenty yards nearer, we must have had several men
wounded, if not killed.
Immediately we halted; and, though it was at a
great distance, we fired, and sent them leaden bullets
for wooden arrows, following our shot full gallop,
resolving to fall in among them sword in hand, for so
our bold Scot that led us directed. He was, indeed,
but a merchant, but he behaved with that vigour and
bravery on this occasion, and yet with such a cool
courage, too, that I never saw any man better
fitted for his command. As soon as we came up to
them, we fired our pistols.in their faces, and then
drew; but they fled in the greatest confusion ima-
ginable; the only stand any of them made was on
our right, where three of them stood, and by signs
called the rest to come back to them, having'a kind of scimitar in their hands, and their bows hanging to
their backs. Our brave commander, without asking
any one to follow him, galloped up close to them, and
with his fusil knocked one of them off his horse, killed
the second with his pistol, and the third ran away: and
thus ended our fight. But we had this misfortune at-
tending it, viz. that all our mutton that we had in
chase got away. We had not a man killed or hurt;
but as for the Tartars, there were five of them killed,
how many were wounded we knew not ; but this we
know, that the other party were so frightened with
the noise of our guns, that they fled, and never made
any attempt upon us.
We were all this while in the Chinese dominion,
and therefore the Tartars were not so bold as after-
wards; but in about five days we entered a wild desert,
which held us three days and nights march, and we
were obliged to carry our water with us in great
leather bottles, and to encamp all night, just"as I
have heard they do in the deserts of Arabia.
In passing this wilderness, which, I confess, was at
the first view very frightful to me, we saw, two or
three times, little parties of the Tartars, but they
seemed to be upon their own affairs, and to have no
design upon us.
We travelled near a month after this, the wavs
being not so good at first, though still in the domi-
nions of the Emperor of China, but lay, for the most
part, in villages, some of which were fortified because
of the incursions of the Tartars. When we came to
one of these towns (it was about two days and a half's
journey before we were to come to the city of Naum),
I wanted to buy a camel, of which there are plenty
to be sold all the way upon that road, and of horses
also, such as they are, because of so many caravans
coming that way, they are very often wanted. The
person that I spoke to get me a camel would have
gone and fetched it for me, but I, like a fool, must be
officious, and go myself along with him. The place
was about two miles out of the village, where they
kept the camels and horses feeding under a guard.
I walked it on foot, with my old pilot in company,
and a Chinese, being very desirous, forsooth, of'a
little variety. When we came to this place, it was a
low, marshy ground, walled round with a stone wall
piled up dry, without mortar or earth among it, like a
park, with a little guard of Chinese soldiers at the
door. Having bought a camel, and agreed for the
price, I came away, and the Chinese man that was
with me led the camel, when on a sudden came up
five Tartars on horseback, two of them seized the
fellow, and took the camel from him, while the other
three stepped up to me and my old pilot, seeing us,
as it were, unarmed, for I had no weapon about me
but my sword, which could but ill defend me against
three horsemen. The first that came up stopped
short upon my drawing my sword (for they are arrant
cowards), but a second coming up on my left, gave me a blow on the head, which I never felt till after-
wards, and wondered, when I came to myself, what
was the matter with me, and where I was, for he laid
me flat on the ground; but my never-failing: old pilot,
the Portuguese (BO Providence, unlocked for, directs
deliverances from dangers, which to us are unfore-
seen), had a pistol in his pocket, which I knew
nothing of, nor the Tartars neither, if they had, I
suppose they would not have attacked us. But
cowards are always boldest when there is no danger.
The old man seeing me down, with a bold heart
stepped up to the fellow that had struck me, and
laying hold of his arm with one hand, and pulling him
down by main force a little towards him with the
other, he shot him in the head, and laid him dead on
the spot: he then immediately stepped up to him
who had stopped us, as I said, and before he could
come forward again (for it was all done, as it were, in
a moment), made a blow at him with a scimitar,
which he always wore, but, missing the man,
cut his horse in the side of the head, cut one of his
ears off by the root, and a slice down the side of his
face. The poor beast, enraged with the wound, was
no more to be governed by his rider, though the fel-
low sat well enough too, but away he flew, and car-
ried him quite out of the pilot's reach, and at some
distance, rising upon his hind legs, threw down the
Tartar, and fell upon him.
In this interval the poor Chinese came in who had
lost the camel, but he had no weapon; however,
seeing the Tartar down, and his horse fallen upon him,
he runs to him, and seizing upon an ugly, ill-favoured
weapon he had by his side, something like apole-axe,
but not a pole-axe neither, he wrenched it from him,
and made shift to knock his Tartarian brains out with
it. But my old man had the third Tartar to deal with
still, and seeing he did not fly, as he expected, nor
come on to fight him, as he apprehended, but stood
stock still, the old man stood still too, and fell to
work to charge his pistol again; but as soon as
the Tartar saw the pistol, whether he supposed it
to be the same, or another, I know not, but away he
scoured, and left my pilot a complete victory.
By this time I was a little awake, and I wondered
where I was, how I came upon the ground, and what
was the matter; in a word, a few moments after, as
sense returned, I felt pain, though I did not know
where; I clapped my hand to my head, and took it
away all bloody, then I felt my head ache, and then,
in another moment, memory returned, and every
thing was present to me again. I jumped upon my
feet instantly, and got hold of my sword, but saw
no enemies. I found a Tartar lie dead, and his
horse standing very quietly by him; and looking
farther, I saw my champion and deliverer, who had
been to see what the Chinese had done, coming back
with his hanger in his hand. The old man, seeing
me on my feet, came running to me, and embraced
me with a great deal of joy, being afraid before that
I had been killed, and seeing me all bloody would see
how I was hurt; but it was not much, being only
what we call a broken head ; neither did I afterwards
find any great inconvenience from the blow.
We made no great gain, however, by this victory,
for we lost a camel and gained a horse; but that
which was remarkable, when we came back to the
village, the man demanded to be paid for the camel,
for I did not give him the money when I bought it.
I disputed it, and it was brought to a hearing before
the Chinese judge of the place, that is to say, in
English, we went before a justice of the peace. He
acted with a great deal of prudence and impartiality,
and, having heard both sides, he gravely asked the
Chinese man, that went with me to buy the camel,
whose servant he was : "I am no servant," said he,
"but went with the stranger." "At whose request?"
said the justice. "At the stranger's request," said
he. "Why then," said the justice, "you were the
stranger's servant for the time, and the camel being
delivered to his servant, it was delivered to" him, and
he must pay for it." I confess the thing was so clear,
that I had not a word to say, but paid willingly for
the camel.
The city of Naum is a frontier of the Chinese em-
pire. They call it fortified, and so it is, as fortifica-
tions go there; for this I will venture to affirm, that
all the Tartars in Karakathay, which, I believe are
some millions, could not batter down the walls with
2 D
their bows and arrows: but to call it strong, if it
were attacked with cannon, would be to make those
who understood it laugh at you. We wanted, as I have said, above two days' jour-
ney of this city, when messengers were sent express
to every part of the road, to tell all travellers and
caravans to halt till they had a guard sent to them,
for that an unusual body of Tartars, making ten thou-
sand in all, had appeared in the way, about thirty
miles beyond the city.
This was very bad news to travellers; however, it
was carefully done of the governor, and we were
very glad to hear we should have a guard. Accord-
ingly, two days after, we had two hundred soldiers
sent us from a garrison of the Chinese on our left,
and three hundred more of the city of Naum, and
with those we advanced boldly. The three hundred
soldiers from Naum marched in our front, the two
hundred in our rear, and our men on each side of our
camels, with our baggage, and the whole caravan in
our centre. In this order, and well prepared for
battle, we thought ourselves a match for the whole
ten thousand Mogul Tartars, if they had appeared;
but the next day, when they did appear, it was quite
another thing.
I t was early in the morning, when marching from
a little well situated town, called Changu, we had a
river to pass, where we were obliged to ferry, and
had the Tartars had any intelligence, then had been
the time to have attacked us, when the caravan being
over, the rear guard was behind; but they did not
appear there.
About three hours after, when we were entered
upon a desert of about fifteen or sixteen miles over,
behold, by a cloud of dust they raised, we saw an
enemy was at hand; and they were at hand indeed, for they came on upon the spur. The Chinese, our
guard in the front, who had talked so big the day
before, began to stagger, and the soldiers frequently j
looked behind them, which is a certain sign, in a
soldier, that he is just ready to run away. My old
pilot was of my mind, and being near me. he called
out "Seignior Inglese," said he, "those fellows must
be encouraged, or they will ruin us all, for if the
Tartars come on, they will never stand it." "I am
of your mind," said 1, "but what must be done?"
"Done!" said he, "let fifty of our men advance, and
flank them on each wing, and encourage them, and
they will fight like brave fellows in brave company;
but without it they will every man turn his back."
Immediately I rode up to our leader and told him,
who was exactly of our mind; and accordingly fifty
of us marched to the right wing, and fifty to the left,
and the rest made a line of reserve; and so we
marched, leaving the last two hundred men to make
another body by themselves, and to guard the camels,
only that, if need were, they should send a hundred
men to assist the last fifty.
In a word, the Tartars came on, and an innumer-
able company they were; how many we could not
tell, but ten thousand we thought was the least. A
party of them came on first, and viewed our posture,
traversing the ground in front of our line, and as we
found them within gun shot, our leader ordered two
wings to advance swiftly, and give them a salvo on
each wing with their shot, which was done: but they
went off, and I suppose went back to give an account
of the reception they were likely to meet with; and
indeed that salute clogged their stomachs, for they
immediately halted, stood awhile to consider of it,
and wheeling off to the left, they gave over the design,
and said no more to us for that time, which was very
agreeable to our circumstances, which were but very
indifferent for a battle with such a number.
Two days after this, we came to the city of Naum.
We thanked the governor for his care of us, and
collected to the value of one hundred crowns, or
thereabouts, which we gave to the soldiers sent to
2 D 2
guard us: and here we rested one day. This isa
garrison indeed, and there were nine hundred soldiers
kept here; but the reason of it was, that formerly
the Muscovite frontiers lay nearer to them than they
do now, the Muscovites having abandoned that part
of the country ((which lies west from the city, for
about two hundred miles) as desolate, and unfit for
use, and more especially, being so very remote, and
so difficult to send troops thither for its defence, for
we had yet above two thousand miles to Muscovy,
properly so called.
After this we passed several great rivers, and two
dreadful deserts, one of which we were sixteen days
passing over, and on the thirteenth of April we came
to the frontiers of the Muscovite dominions. I think
the first city, or town, or fortress, whatever it might
be called, that belonged to the czar of Muscovy, was
called Argun, being on the west side of the river
Arguna. I could not but discover infinite satisfaction
that I was now arrived in, as I called it, a Christian
country, or, at least, in a country governed by Chris-
tians ; for though the Muscovites do, in my opinion,
but just deserve the name of Christians, yet such
they pretended to be, and are very devout in their
way. It would certainly occur to any man who
travels the world as I have done, and who had any
power of reflection, to reflect what a blessing it is to
be born in a part of the world where the name of God
and of a Redeemer, is known and worshipped.
I saluted the brave Scotch merchant I mentioned
before with my first acknowledgment of this, and
taking him by the hand, I said to him, "Blessed be
God, we are once again come among Christians!"
He smiled, and answered, "Do not rejoice too soon,
countryman, these Muscovites are but an odd sort of
Christians, and but for the name of it, you may see
very little of the substance for some months farther
of our journey.
"Well," said I, "but still it is better than Pagan-
ism, and worshipping of devils." "Why, I'll tell
you," said he, " except the Russian soldiers in gar-
risons, and a few of the inhabitants of the cities upon
the road, all the rest of this country, for above a
thousand miles farther, is inhabited by the worst and
most ignorant of paglns;" and so indeed we found it.
We were now launched into the greatest piece of
solid earth, if I understand any thing of the surface
of the globe, that is to be found in any part of the
world. We had, at least, twelve hundred miles to
the sea, eastward; we had, at least, two thousand to
the bottom of the Baltic Sea, westward; and almost
three thousand miles, if we left that sea, and went on
west to the British and French channels; we had
full five thousand miles to the Indian or Persia sea,
south; and about eight hundred miles to the Frozen
Sea, north.
We now advanced from the river Arguna by easy
and moderate journeys, and were very visibly ob- .
liged to the care, the czar of Muscovy'has taken, to
have cities and towns built in as many places as it is
possible to place them, where his soldiers keep gar-
rison, something like the stationary soldiers placed
by the Romans in the remotest countries of their em-
pire, some of which, I had read, were particularly
placed in Britain, for the security of commerce, and
for the lodging of travellers, and thus it was here;
for wherever we came, though at these towns and
stations the garrisons and governors were Russians,
and professed Christians, yet the inhabitants were
mere pagans, sacrificing to idols, and worshipping the
sun, moon, and stars, or all the host of heaven.
Some instances of this we met with in the country
between Arguna, where we enter the Muscovite do-
minions, and a city of Tartars and Russians together,
called Nortzinskoy, in which the space is a continued desert or forest, which cost us twenty days to travel
over it. In a village near the last of those places I
had the curiosity to go and see their way of living,
which is most insufferable. They had, I suppose, a
great sacrifice that day, for there stood out, upon an
old stump of a tree, an idol, made of wood, frightful
as the devil, it had a head certainly not so much as
resembling any creature that the world ever saw,
ears as big as goat's horns, and*as high, eyes as big
as a crown piece, a nose like a crooked ram's horn,
and a mouth extended four cornered, like that of a
lion, with horrible teeth, hooked like a parrot's under
bill. It was dressed up in the filthiest manner that
you can suppose; its upper garment was of sheep-
skins, with the wool outward, a great Tartar bonnet
on the head, with two horns growing through it. It
was about eight feet high, yet hadno feet or legs,
or any proportion of parts. This scarecrow was set
up at the outside of the village, and when I came
near to it, there were sixteen or seventeen creatures,
whether men or women I could not tell, for they
make no distinction by their habits, either of body or
head; these lay flat on the ground, round this for-
midable block of shapeless wood. I saw no motion
among them, any more than if they had been logs
of wood, like their idol. At first, I really thought
they had been so; but when I came a little nearer,
they started up upon their feet, and raised a howl-
ing cry, as if it had been so many deep-mouthed
hounds, and walked away as if they were displeased
at our disturbing them. A little way off from this
monster, and at the door of a tent, or hivt, made all
of sheep-skins and cow-skins dried, stood three
butchers. I thought they were such; for when I
came nearer to them, I found they had long knives
in their hands, and in the middle of the tent appeared
three sheep killed, and one young bullock, or steer.
These, it seems, were sacrifices to that senseless log
of an idol, and these three men priests, belonging to
it; and the seventeen prostrated wretches were the
people who brought the offering, and were making
their prayers to that stock.
I confess I was more moved at their stupidity, and
this brutish worship of a hobgoblin, than ever I was
at any thing in my life; to see God's most glorious
and best creature, to whom he had granted so many
advantages, even by creation, above the rest of the
works of his hands,*vested with a reasonable soul,
and that soul adorned with faculties and capabilities
adapted both to honour his Maker, and be honoured
by him; I say, to see it sunk and degenerated to a de-
gree so stupid, as to prostrate itself before a frightful
nothing, a mere imaginary object, dressed up by them-
selves, and made terrible to themselves by their own
contrivance, adorned only with clouts and rags, and that this should be the effect of mere ignorance,
wrought up into hellish devotion by the devil himself,
who, envying to his Maker the homage and adoration
of his creatures, had deluded them into such gross
surfeiting, sordid, and brutish things, as one would
think should shock nature itself.
In my rage, I rode up to the monster, and with my
sword cut the bonnet that was on its head in two in
the middle, so that it hung down by one of the
horns; and one of our men that was with me took
hold of the sheep-skin that covered it, and pulled
at it, when, behold, a most hideous outcry and
howling ran through the village, and two or' three
hundred people came about my ears, so that I was
glad to scour for it, for we saw some had bows and
arrows: but I resolved to visit them again.
Our caravan rested three nights at the town, which
was about four miles off, in order to provide some
horses which they wanted, several of the horses
having been lamed and jaded with the badness of
the way, and our long march over the last desert;
so we had some leisure here to put my plan in ex-
ecution. I communicated my design to the Scotch
merchant of Moscow, of whose courage I had had
sufficient testimony. I told him what I had seen,
and with what indignation 1 had since thought that
human nature had been so degenerate. I told him I
was resolved, if I could but get four or five men, well
armed, to go with me, to destroy that vile, abomina-
ble idol, to let them see that it had no power to help
itself. and consequently could not be an object of
worship, or to be prayed to, much less help them
that offered sacrifices to it.
I n a word, finding me resolute, he liked the design,
and told me I should not go alone, but he would go
with me ; but he would go first, and bring a stout
fellow, one of his countrymen, to go also with us.
So he brought me his comrade, a Scotchman, whom
he called Captain Richardson, and I gave him a full
account of what I had seen, and also of what I in-
tended, and he told me readily he would go with me,
if it cost him his life. So we three agreed to go,
with my man servant. I had indeed proposed it to
my partner but he declined it; saying he was ready
to assist me to the utmost, and upon all occasions,
for my defence, but that this was an adventure quite
out of his way.
The Scotch merchant brought me a Tartar robe,
or gown of sheep-skins, and a bonnet, with a bow
and arrows, and had provided the same for himself
and his countryman, that the people, if they saw us,
should not be able to determine who we were. All
that night we spent in mixing up some combustible
matter with aquavitse, gunpowder, and such other
materials as we could get; and, having a good quan-
tity of tar in a little pot, the next night we set out
upon our expedition.
We came to the place about eleven o'clock at
night, and found that the people had not the least
jealousy of danger attending their idol. The night
was cloudy, yet the moon gave us light enough to
see that the idol stood just in the same posture and
place it did before. The people seemed to be at rest,
only that in the great hut, or tent, as we called it,
where he saw the three priests, whom we mistook
for butchers, we saw a light; and, going up close to
the door, we heard people talking, as if there were
five or six of them. We concluded, therefore, that
if we set wild-fire to the idol, these men would come
out immediately, and run up to the place to rescue it
from the destruction we intended for it; and what to
do with them we knew not; once we thought of car-
rying it away, and setting fire to it at a distance, but
when we came to handle it, we found it too bulky
for our carriage, so we were at a loss again. The
second Scotchman was for setting fire to the tent, or
hut, and knocking the creatures that were there on
the head when they came out; but I could not join
with that; I was against killing them, if it was pos-
sible to be avoided. "Well, then," said the Scotch
merchant, I'll tell you what we will do: we will try
to take them prisoners, tie their hands, and make
them stand still and see their idol destroyed."
As it happened, we had twine or packthread
enough about us, which we used to tie our fire-works
together with, so we resolved to attack these people
first, and with as little noise as we could. The first
thing we did, we knocked at the door; when one of
the priests coming to the door, we immediately seized
upon him, stopped his mouth, and tied his hands be-
hind him, and led him to the idol, where we gagged
him, that he might not make a noise; we tied his
feet also together, and left him on the ground. Two of us then waited at the door, expecting that
another would come out to see what the matter was;
but we waited so long, and nobody coming out, we
knocked again gently, and immediately out came
two more, and we served them just in the same man-
ner; when, going back, we found two more were
come out to the door, and a third stood behind them
within the door. We seized the two, and immediately tied them, when the third stepping back, and crying
out, the Scotch merchant went in after him, and
taking out a composition we had made, that would
only smoke and stink, he set fire to it, and threw it
in among them. By that time the other Scotchman,
and my man, taking charge of the two men already
bound, and tied together by the arm, led them away
to the idol, and left them there, making haste back
to us. When the fuze we had thrown in had filled
the hut with so much smoke that they were almost
suffocated, we threw in a small leather bag of another
kind, which flamed like a candle, and, following it in,
we found there were but four people left, who, it
seems, were two women and two men, and, as we
supposed, had been about some of their diabolical
sacrifices.
We took them, bound them as we had the others,
and all without any noise. When we had done this,
we carried them all together to the idol. When we
came there, we fell to work with him: and, first, we
daubed him all over, and his robes also, with tar, and
such other stuff as we had, which was tallow mixed
with brimstone; then we stopped his eyes, and ears,
and mouth, full of gunpowder; then we wrapped up
a great piece of wildfire in his bonnet; and then,
sticking all the combustibles we had brought with
us upon him, we looked about to see if we could find
any thing else to help to burn him, when my man
remembered that by the tent, or hut, where the men
were, there lay a heap of dry forage, whether straw
or rushes I do not remember: away he and one of
the Scotchmen ran, and fetched their arms full of
that. When we had done this, we took all our pri-
soners, and brought them, having untied their feet,
and ungagged their mouths, and made them stand
up, and set them just before their monstrous idol, and
then set fire to the whole. We stayed by it a quarter
of an hour, or thereabouts, till the powder in the
eyes, and mouth, and ears of the idol blew up, and,
as we could perceive, had split and deformed the
shape of it; and, in a word, till we saw it burn into
a mere block or log of wood, and then setting the
dry forage to it, we found it would soon be quite
consumed, so we began to think of going away; but
the Scotchman said, " No, we must not go: for these
poor deluded wretches will all throw themselves into
the fire, and burn themselves with the idol." So we
resolved to stay till all the forage was burned down
too, and then we came away, and left them.
In the morning we appeared among our fellow-
travellers, exceeding busy in getting ready for our
journey, nor could any man suggest that we had been
any where bat in our beds, as travellers might be
supposed to be, to fit themselves for the fatigue of
that day's journey.
But it did not end so; for the next day came a
great multitude of the country people, not only of
this village, but of a hundred more, for aught I know,
to the town gates, and, in a most outrageous manner,
demanded satisfaction of the Russian governor, for
the insulting their priests, and burning their great
Cham-Chi-Thaungu, such a hard name they gave
the monstrous creature they worshipped. The people
of Nortzinskoy were at first in a great consternation,
for they said the Tartars were no less than thirty
thousand, and that, in a few days more, they would
be one hundred thousand strong.
The Russian governor sent out messengers to ap-
pease them, and gave them all the good words ima-
ginable. He assured them he knew nothing of it,
and that there had not a soul in his garrison been
abroad; that it could not be from any body there;
and if they would let him know who it was, they
should be exemplatily punished. They returned
haughtily, that all the country reverenced the great
Cham-Chi-Thaungn, who dwelt in the sun, and no
mortal would have dared to offer violence to his
image but some Christian miscreants, so they called
them; and they therefore denounced war against
him and all the Russians, who, they said, were mis-
creants and Christians. The governor gave them
still all the good words he could: at last he told
them there was a caravan gone towards Russia that
morning, and, perhaps, it was some of them who had
done them this injury, and if they would be satisfied
with that, he would send after them to inquire into
it. This seemed to appease them a little, and accord-
ingly the governor sent after ns, and gave us a par-
ticular account how the thingwas, intimating withal,
that if any of our caravan had done it, they should
make their escape: but that, whether they had done
it or no, we should make all the haste forward that
was possible; and that, in the mean time, he would
keep them in play as long as he could.
This was very friendly in the governor. So the
captain of the caravan pushed us on for two days and
two nights, without any considerable stop, and then
we lay at a village called Plothus; nor did we make
any long stop here, but hastened on towards Jara-
wena, another of the Czar of Muscovy's colonies, and
where we expected we should be safe.
It was the second day's march from Plothus, that,
by the clouds of dust behind us, at a great distance,
some of our people began to be sensible that we were
pursued. We had entered another desert, and had
passed by a great lake, called Schaks Oser, when we
perceived a very great body of horse appear on the
other side of the lake to the north, we travelling
west. We observed they went away west as we did,
but had supposed we would have taken that side of
the lake, whereas we very happily took the south
side; and, in two days more, we saw them not, for
they, believing we were still before them, pushed on
till they came to the river when it passes farther
north; but where we came to it, we found it narrow
and fordable.
The third day they either found their mistake, or
had intelligence of us, and came pouring in upon us
towards the dusk of evening. We had, to our great
satisfaction, just pitched upon a place for our camp,
which was very convenient for the night; for as we
were upon a desert, though but at the beg inn ing of
it, that was above five hundred miles over, we had
no towns to lodge at, and indeed expected none but
the city of Jarawena, which we had yet two days'
march to. The desert, however, had some few woods
in it on this side, and little rivers, which ran all into
the great river Udda. It was in a narrow strait, be-
tween two small, but very thick woods, that we
pitched our little camp for that night, expecting to
be attacked in the night. We took care to make our
front as strong as we could, by placing our packs,
and our camels and horses, all in a line on the inside
of the river, and we felled some trees in our rear.
The enemy was upon us before we had finished our
situation. They did not come on us like thieves, as
we expected, but sent three messengers to us, to de-
mand the men to be delivered to them that had
abused their priests, and burned their god Cham-
Chi-Thaungu, that they might burn them with fire:
and upon this, they said, they would go away, and
do us no further harm, otherwise they would burn us
all with fire. No one knew any thing of what they
accused us, except me and my accomplices, but we
kept our secret. The leader of the caravan sent
word he was well assured it was not done by any of
our camp; that we were peaceable merchants, tra-
velling on our business; that we had done no harm
to them, or to any one else; and that therefore they
must look farther for their enemies who had injured
them, for we were not the people; so he desired
them not to disturb us, for if they did, we should
defend ourselves. They were far from being satis-
fled with this, and a great crowd of them came
down in the morning; and, after looking at us
for a while, they set up a great howl, and let fly
a cloud of arrows at us; but we were too well forti-
fied for them to do any mischief; and I do not
remember that one man of us was hurt.
Some time after this, we saw them move a little to
our right, and expected them on the rear; when a
cunning fellow, a Cossack, of Jarawena, in the pay
of the Muscovites, calling to the leader of the cara-
van, said to him, " I'll go send all these people away
to Sibeilka." This was a city four or five days'
journey, at least. to the south, and rather behind us.
So he takes his bow and arrows, and getting on
horseback, he rides away from our rear directly, as
it were, back to Nortzinskoy: after this, he takes a
great circuit about, and comes to the army of the
Tartars, as if he had been sent express to tell them a
long story, that the people who had burned their
Oham-Chi-Thaungu were gone to Sibeilka, with a
caravan of miscreants, as he called them, that is to
say, Christians; and that they were resolved to burn
the god Schal-Isar, belonging to the Tongueses.
As this fellow was a mere Tartar, and spoke their
language, they believed all he said: away they drove
off in a great* hurry to Sibeilka; and, in less than
three hours, they were entirely out of sight. So we
passed safely on to the city of Jarawena, where
there was a garrison of Muscovites; and there we
rested five days, the caravan being exceedingly
fatigued with the last day's march, and with want
of rest in the night.
From this city we had a frightful desert, which
was twenty-three days' march. We furnished our-
selves with some tents here, for the better accommo-
dating us in the night; and the leader of the caravan
procured sixteen carriages, or waggons, of the coun-
try, for carrying our water and provisions; and these
carriages were our defence every night round our
little camp; so that had the Tartars appeared, unless
they had been very numerous indeed, they would not
have been able to hurt us. In this desert we saw
neither house nor tree, nor scarce a bush, We saw,
indeed, abundance of sable hunters; these are all
Tartars, of the Mogul Tartary, of which this country
is a part, and they frequently attack small caravans;
but we saw no numbers of them together.
After we were out of this desert, and had travelled
two days, we came to Janezay, a Muscovite city or
station, on the great river Janezay. This river, they
told us, parted Europe from Asia, though our ^map-
makers, as I am told, do not agree to it. However,
it is certainly the eastern boundary of the ancient
Siberia, which now makes a province only of the vast
Muscovite empire, but is itself equal in bigness to the
whole empire of Germany. And yet here I observed
ignorance and paganism still prevailed, except
in the Muscovite garrisons. The whole country
between the river Oby and the river Janezay
is as entirely pagan, and the people as barbarous, «s
the remotest of the Tartars; nay, as any nation, for
aught I know, in Asia or America. I also found,
which I observed to the Muscovite governors whom
I had opportunity to converse with, that the pagans
are not much the wiser, or the nearer Christianity,
for being under the Muscovite government; which
they acknowledged was true enough; but they said
it was none of their business: that if the czar ex-
pected to convert his Siberian, or Tonguese, or Tartar
subjects, it should be done by sending clergymen
among them not soldiers; and they added, with more
sincerity than I expected, that they found it was not
so much the concern of their monarch to make the
people Christians, as it was to make them subjects.
From this river to the great river Oby we crossed
a wild, uncultivated country; I cannot say it is a
barren soil; it is only barren of people and good
management. What inhabitants we found in it were
all pagans, except such as are sent among them from
Russia; for this is the country, on both sides the
river Oby, whither the Muscovite criminals that are
not put to death are banished, and from whence it is
next to impossible they should ever come away.
We now came to Tobolsk!, the capital city of
Siberia. Having been seven months on our journey,
and winter coming on apace, my partner and I called
a council about our particular affairs, in which we
found it proper, considering that we were bound for
England, and not for Moscow, to consider how to
dispose of ourselves. They told us of sledges and
rein-deer to carry us over the snow in winter time,
by which means the Russians travel more in the
winter than they can in summer; because in these
sledges they are able to run night and day; the snow,
being frozen, is one universal covering to nature, by
which the hills and vales, the rivers and lakes, are
all smooth and hard as a stone; and they run upon
the surface, without any regard to what is underneath.
But I had no occasion to push at a winter journey of
this kind; I was bound to England, not to Moscow,
and my route lay two ways: either I must go on as
the caravan went, till I came to Jeroslow, and then
go either by sea or land to Dantzic, where I might
probably sell my China goods to good advantage; or
I must leave the caravan at a little town on the
Dwina, from whence I had but six days by water to
Archangel, and from thence might be sure of shipping,
either to England, Holland, or Hamburgh.
Now to go any of those journies in the winter
would have been preposterous; for, as to Dantzic,
the Baltic would be frozen up, and I could not get
rsage; and to go up by land in those countries was
less safe than among the Mogul Tartars: like-
wise to go to Archangel in October, all the ships
would be gone from thence, and even the merchants,
who dwell there in summer retire south to Moscow
in the winter, when the ships are gone; so that I should have nothing but extremity of cold to en-
counter, with a scarcity of provisions, and must lie
there in'an empty town "all the winter. So that, upon
the whole, I thought it much my better way to let
the caravan go, and to make provision to winter
where I was, viz. at Tobolsk!, in Siberia, in the lati-
tude of sixty degrees, where I was sure of three
things to wear out a cold winter with, viz. plenty of
provision, such as the country afforded, a warm
house, with fuel enough, and excellent company.
I was now in a quite different climate from my
beloved island, where I never felt cold, except when
I had my ague; on the contrary, I had much to do
to bear any clothes on my back, and never made any
fire but without doors, and for my necessity in dress-
ing my food, &c. Now 1 made me three good vests,
with large robes or gowns over them to hang down to
the feet, and button close to the wrists, and all these
lined with furs to make them sufficiently warm.
As to a warm house, I must confess I greatly dis-
like our way in England of making fires in every
room in the house, in open chimneys, which, when
the fire was out, always kept the air in the room cold
as the climate. But taking an apartment in a good
house in the town, I ordered a chimney to be built,
like a furnace, in the centre of six several rooms, like
a stove, the funnel to carry the smoke went up one
way, the door to come at the fire went in another,
and all the rooms were kept equally warm, but no
fire seen, just as they heat the bagnios in England.
By this means we had always the same climate in
all the rooms, and an equal heat was preserved; and
how cold soever it was without, it was always warm
within; and yet we saw no fire, nor were ever incom-
moded with any smol e.
The most wonderful thing of all was, that it should
be possible to meet with good company here, in a
country so barbarous as that of the most northerly
parts of Europe, near the frozen ocean, and within
but a very few degrees of Nova Zembla. But this
being the country where the state criminals of Mus-
covy, as I observed before, are all banished, this city
was full of noblemen, princes, gentlemen, colonels, and,
in short, all degrees of the nobility, gentry, soldiers and courtiers of Muscovy. Here were the famous
tm
general Robostisky, and several other persons of note,
and some ladies.
By means of my Scotch merchant, whom, never-
theless, I parted with here, I made an acquaintance
with several of these gentlemen, and some of them of
the first rank, among whom was a certain prince,
one of the banished ministers of state belonging to
the czar of Muscovy. I have not room to give a full
account of the most agreeable conversation I had
with this last mentioned truly great man; in all
which he showed that his mind was so inspired with
a superior knowledge of things, so supported by re-
ligion, as well as by a vast share of wisdom, that his
contempt of the world was really as much as he could
express, and he was always the same to the last, as
will appear in the story I am going to tell.
I had been here eight months, and a dark, dreadful
winter I thought it to be; the cold was so intense,
that I could not so much as look abroad without
being wrapped in furs, and a mask of fur before my face, or rather a hood, with only a hole for breath,
and two for sight. The little daylight we had was,
as we reckoned, for three months, not above five
hours a day, and six at most, only that the snow
lying on the ground continually, and the weather
clear, it was never quite dark. Our horses were kept
(or rather starved) under ground; and, as for our
servants (for we hired servants here to look after our
horses and ourselves), we had now and then their
fingers and toes to thaw and take care of, lest they
should mortify, and fall off.
It is true, within doors, we were warm, the houses
being close, the walls thick, the lights small, and the
glass all double. Our food was chiefly the flesh of
deer, dried and cured in the season; good bread
enough, but baked as biscuits; dried fish, of several
sorts, and some flesh of mutton, and of the buffaloes,
which is a pretty good beef. All the stores of pro-
vision for the winter are laid up in the summer, and
well cured. Our drink was water, mixed with aqua-
vitae, instead of brandy; and, for a treat, mead in-
stead of wine, which, however, they have excellent
good. The hunters, who venture abroad all weathers,
frequently brought us in fresh venison, very fat and
good; and sometimes bears' flesh, but we did not
much care for the last. We had a good stock of tea,
with which we treated our friends; and, we lived very
cheerfully and well, all things considered.
It was now March, and the days grown consider
bly longer, and the weather at least tolerable; so the
other travellers began to prepare sledges to carry them
over the snow, and to get things ready to be going;
but my measures being fixed, as I have said, for Ar-
changel, and not for Muscovy or the Baltic, I made
no motion, knowing very well that the ships from the
south do not set out for that part of the world till
May or June, and that if I was there by the begin-
ning of August, it would be as soon as any ships
would be ready to go away; and, therefore, I say, I made no haste to be gone, as others did; in a word,
I saw a great many people, nay, all the travellers,' go
away before me. It seems every year they go from
thence to Moscow for trade, viz. to carry furs, and
buy necessaries with them, which they bring back to
furnish their ships: also others went on the same
errand to Archangel, but then they also, being to
come back again above eight hundred miles, went
all out before me.
In short about the latter end of May I began to
make all ready to pack up; and as I was doing this,
it occurred to me, that seeing all those people were
banished by the czar of Muscovy to Siberia, and yet
when they came there, were left at liberty to go
whither they would, why did they not then go away
to any part of the world, wherever they thought fit;
and I began to examine what should hinder them
from making such an attempt.
2 E 2
But my wonder was over when I entered upon that
subject with the person I have mentioned, who an-
swered me thus:—" Consider first, sir," said he," the
place where we are; and, secondly, the condition we
are in, especially," said he, "the generality of the
people who are banished hither. We are surrounded,"
said he, " with stronger things than bars and bolts:
on the north side is an unnavigable ocean, where ship
never sailed, and boat never swam; neither, if we
had both, could we know whither to go with them.
Every other way," said he, " we have above one
thousand miles to pass through the czar's own do-
minions, and by ways utterly impassable, except by
the roads made by the government, and through the
towns garrisoned by its troops; so that we could
neither pass undiscovered by the road, nor subsist
any other way, so that it is in vain to attempt it."
I was silenced indeed at once, and found that they
were in a prism, every jot as secure as if they had
been locked up in the castle of Moscow. However,
it came into my thoughts that I might certainly be
made an instrument to procure the escape of this ex-
cellent person, and that it was very easy for me to
carry him away, there being no guard over him in
the country; and as I was not going to Moscow, but
to Archangel, and that I went in the nature of a ca-
ravan, by which I was not obliged to lie in the sta-
tionary towns in the desert, but could encamp every
night where I would, we might easily pass uninter-
rupted to Archangel, where I would immediately
secure him on board an English or Dutch ship, and
carry him off along with me; and, as to his sub-
sistence, and other particulars, that should be my
care, till he could better supply himself.
He heard me very attentively, and looked earnestly
on me all the while I spoke; nay, I could see in his
very face that what I said put his spirits into an ex-
ceeding ferment: his colour frequently changed, his
eyes looked red, and his heart fluttered, that it might
be even pereeived in his countenance; nor could he
immediately answer me, when I had done, and, as it
were, expecting what he would say to it, and after he
had paused a little he embraced me, and said, " How
unhappy are we, unguided creatures as we are, that
even our greatest acts of friendship are made snares
to us, and we are made the tempters of-one another!
My dear friend," said he, " your offer is so sincere, has such kindness in it, is so disinterested in itself,
and is so calculated for my advantage, that I must
have very little knowledge of the world if I did not
both wonder at it, and acknowledge the obligation I
have upon me to you for it. But did you believe I was sincere in what I have so often said to you of my
contempt of the world? Did you believe I spoke my
very soul to you, and that I had really attained that
degree of felicity here that had placed me above all
that the world could give me, or do for me? Did
you believe I was sincere when I Ibid you I would
not go back, if I was recalled, even to be all that
once I was in the court, and with the favour of the
czar my master? Did you believe me, my friend, to
be an honest man, or did you think me to be a boast-
ing hypocrite?" Here he stopped, as if he would
hear what I would say ; but indeed I soon after per-
ceived that he stopped because his spirits were in
motion, his heart was full of struggles, and he could
not go on. I was, I confess, astonished at the thing,
as well as the man, and I used some arguments with
him to urge him to set himself free; that he ought
to look upon this as a door opened by Heaven for his deliverance, and a summons by Providence, who has
the care and good disposition of all events, to do him-
self good, and to render himself useful in the world.
He had by this time recovered himself. "How do
you know, sir," said he, warmly, "but that, instead
of a summons from Heaven, it may be a feint of
another instrument, representing in all the alluring
colours to me, the show of felicity as a deliverance,
which may in itself be my snare, and tend directly
to my ruin? Here I am, free from the temptation
of returning to my former miserable greatness; there
I am not sure but that all the seeds of pride, am-
bition, avarice, and luxury, which I know remain in
nature, may revive and take root, and, in a word,
again overwhelm me, and then the happy prisoner,
whom you see now master of his soul's liberty, shall
be the miserable slave of his own senses, enjoying
all personal liberty. Dear sir, let me remain in
this blessed confinement, banished from the crimes
of this life, rather than purchase a show of freedom
at the expense of the liberty of my reason, and at the
expense of the future happiness which I now have in
view, but shall then, I fear, quickly lose sight of; for
I am but flesh, a man, a mere man: have passions
and affections as likely to possess and overthrow me
as any man. O be not my friend, and my tempter
both together If I was surprised before, I was quite dumb now,
and stood silent looking at him, and indeed admired
what I saw: the struggle in his soul was so great,
that, though the weather was extremely cold, it put
him into a most violent sweat, and I found he wanted
to give vent to his mind; so I said a word or two,
that I would leave him to consider of it, and wait on
him again, and then I withdrew to my apartment.
About two hours after, I heard somebody at, or
near, the door of my room, and I was going to open
the door; hut he had opened it and came in. "My
dear friend," said he, "you had almost overset me,
but I am recovered. Do not take it ill that I do not
close with your offer. I assure you it is not for want
of a sense of the kindness of it in you, and I came to
make the most sincere acknowledgment of it to you;
but I hope I have got the victory over myself."
"My lord," said 1, " I hope you are fully satisfied
that you do ilot resist the call of Heaven."—" Sir,"
said he, " if it had been from Heaven, the same power
would have influenced me to accept it; but I hope,
and am fully satisfied, that it is from Heaven that I
decline it; and I have an infinite satisfaction in the
parting, that you shall leave me an honest man still,
though not a free man." I had nothing to do but to
acquiesce, and make professions to him of my having
no end in it, but a sincere desire to serve him. He
embraced me very passionately, and assured me he
was sensible of that, and should always acknowledge
it ; and with that he offered me a very fine present
of sables, too much indeed for me to accept from a
man in his circumstances, and I would have avoided
them, but he would not be refused.
The next morning I sent my servant to his lord-
ship, with a small present of tea, two pieces of China
damask, and four little wedges of Japan gold, which
did not weigh above six ounces; but were far short
of the value of his sables, which indeed, when I came
to England, I found worth near two hundred pounds.
He accepted the tea, and one piece of the damask,
and one of the pieces of gold, which had a fine stamp
upon it, of the Japan coinage, which I found he took
for the rarity of it, but would not take any more;
and he sent word, by my servant, that he desired to
speak with me.
When I came to him, he told me I knew what had
passed between us, and hoped I would not move him
any more in that affair; but that since I had made
such a generous offer to him, he asked me if I had
kindness enough to offer the same to another person
that he would name to me, in whom he had a great
share of concern. I told him that I could not say I
inclined to do so much for any one but himself, for
whom I had a particular value, and should have been
glad to have been the instrument of his deliverance.
However, if he would please to name the person to
me, I would fpve him my answer, and hoped he
would not be displeased with me, if he was with my
answer. He told me it was his only son, who, though
I had not seen him, yet was in the same condition
with himself, and above two hundred miles from him,
on the other side the Oby; but that, if I consented,
he would send for him. I made no hesitation, but
told him I would do it. So he sent away the next
day for his son, and in about twenty days he same
back with the messenger, bringing six or seven
horses loaded with very rich furs, and which in the
whole amounted to a very great value.
His servants brought the horses into the town, but
left the young lord at a distance till night, when he
came incognito into our apartment, aijd his father
presented him to me; and, in short, we concerted
there the manner of our travelling, and every thing
proper for the journey. I had bought a considerable
quantity of sables, black fox-skins, fine ermines, and
such other furs that are very rich, in exchange for
some of the goods I had brought from China: in par-
ticular, for the cloves and nutmegs, of which I sold
the greatest part here, and the rest afterwards at
Archangel, for a much better price than I could have
got at London.
It was the beginning of June when I left this re-
mote place; a city, I believe, little heard of in the
world, and indeed it is so far out of the road of com-
merce, that I know not how it should be much talked
of. We were now a very small caravan, being only
thirty horses and camels in all; and all of them passed for mine, though my new guest was proprietor
of eleven of them. If was most natural, also, that I
should take more servants with me than I had before,
and the young lord passsed for my steward; what
great man 1 passed for myself, I know not, neither
did it concern me to inquire. We had here the worst
and largest desert to pass over that we had met with
in all the journey, indeed I call it the worst, because
the way was deep in some places, and very uneven
in others; the best we had to say for it was, that we
thought we had no troops of Tartars and robbers to
fear, and that they never came on this side of the
river Oby, or, at least, but very seldom; but we
found it otherwise.
My young lord had with him a faithful Muscovite
servant, or rather a Siberian servant, who was per-
fectly acquainted with the country, and who led ns
by private roads, so that we avoided coming into the
principal towns and cities, upon the great road, such
as Tumen, Soloy-Kamaskoy, and several others, be-
cause the Muscovite garrisons which are kept there
are very curious and strict in their observation upon
travellers, and searching lest any of the banished
persons of note should make their escape that way
into Muscovy; but by this means, as we were kept
out of the cities, so our whole journey was a desert,
and we were obliged to encamp, and lie in our tents,
when we might have had very good accommodation
in the cities on the way. This the young lord was so
sensible of, that he would not allow us to lie abroad
when we came to several cities on the way, but lay
abroad himself with his servant in the woods, and
met us always at the appointed places.
We were just entered Europe, having passed the
river Kama, which, in these parts, is the boundary
between Europe and Asia; and the first city, on the
European side, was Soloy-Kamaskoy, which is as
much as to say, the great city on the river Kama;
and here we thought to have seen some evident
alteration in the people, their manners, their habits,
religion, and their business; but we were mistaken,
for as we had a vast desert to pass, which, by report,
is near seven hundred miles long in some places, but
not above two hundred miles over where we passed
it; so, till we came past that horrible place, we found
very little difference between that country and the
Mogul Tartars, and the people mostly pagans, and
little better than the savages of America; their
houses and towns full of idols, and their way of living
wholly barbarous, except in the cities, as above, and
the villages near them, where they are Christians, as
they call themselves, of the Greek Church; but even
these have their religion mingled with so many relics
of superstition, that it is scarce to be known, in some
places, from mere sorcery and witchcraft.
In passing this forest, I thought indeed we should
have been robbed, and perhaps murdered, by a troop
of thieves; of what country they were, whether the
roving bands of the Ostiachy, a kind of Tartars, or
wild people on the bank of the Oby, and ranged thus
far, or whether they were the sable-hunters of Sibe-
ria, I am yet at a loss to know; but they were all on
horseback, carried bows and arrows, and were at
first about forty-five in number; they came so near
to us as within about two musket-shot, and, asking
no questions, they surrounded us with their horses,
and looked very earnestly upon us twice. At length
they placed themselves in our way, when we drew up
a little line before our camels, being not above sixteen
men in all; and sent out the Siberian servant, who
attended his lord, to see who they were. His master
was the more willing to let him go, because he was
not a little apprehensive that they were a Siberian
troop sent out after him. The man came up near
them, with a flag of truce, and called to them, but
though he spoke several of their languages, or dialects
of languages rather, he could not understand a word
they said. However, after some signs to him not to
come nearer them at his peril (so he said he under-
stood them to mean), offering to shoot at him if he
advanced, the fellow came back no wiser than he
went, only that by their dress, he said he believed
them to be some Tartars of Kalmuck, or of the Cir-
cassian hordes, and that there must be more of them
on the great desert, though he never heard that ever
any of them were seen so far north before.
This was small comfort to us. However, we had
no remedy. There was, on our left hand, at about a
quarter of a mile's distance, a little grove or clump of
trees, which stood close together, 'and very near the
road. I immediately resolved we would advance to
those trees, and fortify ourselves as well as we could
there; for first, I considered that the trees would,
in a great measure, cover us from their arrows, and,
in the next place, they could not come to charge us
in a body. It was indeed my old Portuguese pilot
who proposed it, and who had this excellency attend-
ing him, namely, that he was always readiest and most
apt to direct and encourage us, in cases of the most
danger. We advanced immediately with what speed
we could, and gained that little wood, the Tartars,
or thieves, for we knew not what to call them, keep-
ing their stand, and not attempting to hinder us.
When we came thither, we found, to our great satis-
faction, that it was a swampy, springy piece of
ground, and, on the one side, a very great spring of
water, which running oat in a little rill, or brook,
was a little farther joined by another of the like
bigness, and was, in short, the head, or source, of a
considerable river, called afterwards the Wirtska.
The trees which grew about this spring were not in
all above two hundred, but were very large, and
stood pretty thick, so that as soon as we got in, we
saw ourselves perfectly safe from the enemy, unless
they alighted and attacked us on foot.
But to make this more difficult, we cut down, with,
much labour, great arms of the trees, and laid them
hanging, not cut quite off, from one tree to another;
so that we made a continued fence almost round us.
We staid here waiting the motion of the enemy,
some hours, without perceiving they made any offer
to stir, when, about two hours before night, they
came directly upon us; and, though we had not per-
ceived it, we found they had been joined by some
more of the same, so that they were near fourscore
horse, whereof we fancied some were women. They
came on till they were within half a shot of our little
wood, when we fired one musket, without ball, and.
called to them in the Russian tongue to know what
they wanted, and bade them keep off; but, as if they
knew nothing of what we said, they came on with a
double fury, directly up to the wood side, not ima-
gining we were so barricadoed that they could not
break in. Our old pilot was our captain, as well as
he had been our engineer, and desired us not to fire
upon them till they came within pistol shot, that we
might be sure to kill; and that when we did fire, we
should be sure to take good aim. We bade him give
the word of command, which he delayed so long,
that they were, some of them, within two pikes'
length of us when we fired.
We aimed so true (or Providence directed our shot
so sure,) that we killed fourteen of them at the first
volley, and wounded several others, as also several
of their horses; for we had all of us loaded our
pieces with two or three bullets apiece, at least.
They were terribly surprised with our fire, and re-
treated immediately about one hundred rods from us,
in which time we loaded our pieces again, and seeing
them keep at a distance, we sallied out and caught
four or five of their horses, whose riders, we sup-
posed, were killed; and coming up to the dead, we
could easily perceive they were Tartars, but knew
not from what country, or how they came to make
an excursion of such an unusual length.
About an hour after, they made a motion to attack
us again, and rode round our little wood, to see where
else they might break in, but finding us always ready
to face them, they went off again, and we resolved
not to stir from the place for that night.
We slept little, but spent the most part of the night
in strengthening our situation, and barricading the
entrances in the wood, and keeping a strict watch,
we waited for daylight; and when it came, it gave
us a very unwelcome discovery indeed; for the enemy,
who we thought were discouraged with the reception
they had met with, were now increased to no less
than three hundred, and had set up eleven or twelve
huts and tents, as if they were resolved to besiege
us; and this little camp they had pitched was upon
the open plain, at about three quarters of a mile from
us. We were, indeed, surprised at this discovery, and now, I confess, I gave myself over for lost, and
all that I had. The loss of my effects, did not lie so
near me (though they were very considerable), as the
thoughts of falling into the hands of such barbarians,
at the latter end of my journey, after so many diffi-
culties and hazards as I had gone through, and even
in sight of our port, where we expected safety and
deliverance. As for my partner, he was raging, and
said he would rather die than be starved; and he was
for fighting to the last drop.
The young lord was for fighting to the last also;
and my old pilot was of opinion that we were able to
resist them all, in the situation we then were in; and
thus we spent the day in debates of what we should
do; but towards evening we found that the number
of our enemies still increased. Perhaps, as they
were abroad in several parties for prey the first had
sent out scouts to call for help, and to acquaint them
of the booty, and we did not Know but by the morn-
ing they might still be a greater number: so I began
to inquire of those people we had brought from To-
bolsk! if there was no other, or more private ways,
by which we might avoid them in the night, and,
perhaps, either retreat to some town, or get help to
guard us over the desert.
The Siberian. who was servant to the young lord,
told us, if we designed to avoid them, and not fight,
he would engage to carry us off in the night to a
way that went north, towards the river Petraz, by
which he made no question but we might get away,
and the Tartars never be the wiser; but, he said, his
lord had told him he would not retreat, but would
rather choose to fight. I told him, he mistook his
lord, for that he was too wise a man to love fighting
for the sake of it; that I knew his lord was brave
enough, by what he had shown already; but his lord
knew better than to desire to have seventeen or
eighteen men fight five hundred, unless an unavoid-
able necessity forced them to it; and that if he
thought it possible for us to escape in the night, we
had nothing else to do but to attempt it. He an-
swered, if his lord gave him such an order, he would
lose his life, if he did not perform it. We soon
brought his lord to give that order, though privately,
and we prepared for putting it in practice.
And, first, as soon as it began to be dark, we made
a fire in our little camp, which we kept burning, and
prepared so as to make it burn all night, that the
Tartars might conclude we were still there; but as
soon as it was dark, that is to say, so as we could see
the stars (for our guide would not stir before), having
all our horses and camels ready laden, we followed
our new guide, who, I soon found, steered himself
by the pole, or north star, all the country being level
for a long way.
After we had travelled two hours very hard, it
began to be lighter still, not that it was quite dark
all night, but the moon began to rise, so that, in short,
it was rather lighter than we wished it to be: but by
six o'clock next morning we were gotten near forty
miles, though the truth is, we almost spoiled our
horses. Here we found a Russian village, named
Kirmezinskoy, where we rested, and heard nothing
of the Kalmuck Tartars that day. About two hours
before night we set out again, and travelled till eight
the next morning, though not quite so hastily as
before: and about seven o'clock we passed a little river called Kirtza, and came to a good large town,
inhabited by Russians, and very populous, called
Ozomoys. There we heard, that several troops or
hordes of Kalmucks had been abroad upon the desert,
but that we were now completely out of danger
of them, which was to our 'great satisfaction, you may be sure. Here we were obliged to get some
fresh horses, and having need of rest; we stayed five
days; and my partner and I agreed to give the honest
Siberian, who brought us thither, the value of ten
pistoles, for his conducting us.
In five days more we came to Venssima, upon the
river Witzogda, which running into the river Dwina,
we were there very happily near the end of our
travels by land, that river being navigable in seven
days passage to Archangel. From hence we came to
Lawrenskoy, where the river joins, the third of July,
and provided ourselves with two luggage boats, and
a barge for our convenience. We embarked the
seventh, and arrived all safe at Archangel the
eighteenth, having been a year, five months, and
three days, on the journey, including our stay of eight
months and odd days at Tobolski. We were obliged
to stay at this place six weeks for the arrival of the
ships, and must have tarried longer, had not a Ham-
burger come in above a month sooner than any of
the English ships; when, after some consideration
that the city of Hamburgh might happen to be as
good a market for our goods as London, we all took
freight with him; and, having put our goods on
board, it was most natural for me to put my steward
on board, to take care of them, by which means my
young lord had a sufficient opportunity to conceal
himself, never coming on shore again in all the time
we stayed there, and this he did, that he might not
be seen in the city, where some of the Moscow mer-
chants would certainly have seen and discovered him.
We sailed from Archangel the twentieth of August,
in the same year; and, after no extraordinary bad
voyage, arrived in the Elbe, the thirteenth of Sep-
tember. Here my partner and I found a very good
sale for our goods ; as well those of China, as the sables, &c. of Siberia; and dividing the. produce of
our effects, my share amounted to three thousand
four hundred and seventy-five pounds, seventeen
shillings, and threepence, notwithstanding so many
losses we had sustained and charges we had been at,
only remembering that I had included in this about
six hundred pounds' worth of diamonds, which I had
purchased at Bengal.
Here the young lord took his leave of us, and went
up the Elbe, in order to go to the court of Vienna,
where he resolved to seek protection, and where he
could correspond with those of his father's friends
who were left alive. He did not part without all the
testimonies he could give me of gratitude for the
service I had done him, and his sense of my kindness
to the prince his father.
To conclude, having stayed near four months in
Hamburgh, I came from thence over land to the
Hague, where I embarked in the packet, and arrived
in London the tenth of January, 1705, having been
gone from England ten years and nine months.
And here, resolving to harrassmyself no more, I am
preparing myself for a longerjourney than all these,
having lived seventy-two years, a life of infinite variety, and learned sufficiently to know the value of
retirement, and the blessing of ending our days in
peace.
