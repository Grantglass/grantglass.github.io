Robinson Crusoe, &c. 




HAT homely Proverb, ufed on Co many 
Occaüons in England, <viz. Thai nubat fr 
bred in tht Bont, ntriÜ not go out of the 
F/tß t was never more vcrified than in 
the Story of my LIFE. Any one 
would think, that after thirty-five Years 
Affliäion, and a Variety of unhappy Circumftances, 
which few Men, if ever any, wentthrough before, and 
after near feven Years of Peace and Enjoyment in the 
Fulnefs of all things ; grown old, and when, if wer, 
it might be allowed me to have had Experience of every 
State of middle Life, and. to know whrch was moft 
adapted to make a Man completely happy ; I fay, after 
all this, any one would have thought, that the native 
Propenfity to RambJing, which I gave an Account of 
in my firft fetting out into the World, to have been fö 
predominant in my Thooghts, fhould be worn out, the 
rolatile Part be fully evacuated, or at leait condens'd, 
and I might at 61 Years of Age have been a little in- 
clined to ftay at Home, and have done venturing Life and 
Fortune any more. 

Nay, farther, the common Motiv« of foreign Adven- 
tares was taken awa,y in me ; for I had no FottÄWÄ. \w 
make, I had nothing to feek : If 1 had £*!ydl&. \rä ^«ara*

fand Pounds, I had been no richcr ; for I had alreadjy 
iufficicnt for mc, and for thofe I had to leave it to ; and 
that I had, was vifibly increafing ; for having no gjcat 
Family, I could not fpend the Income of what I had, 
unlefs I would fet up for an expenfive Way of Lhring, 
fach as a grcat Family, Servants, Equipage, Gaiety, 
and tbe like>\ which were things I had no Notion of, o* 
Inclination to ; fo that I had nothing indeed to do, but 
to fit Hill, and fully enjoy what I had got, and fee it 
increafe daily upon my Hands. 

Yet all thefe things had no Effect upon me, or at leaft 
not enough to refift the ftrong Inclination I had to go> 
abroad again, which hüng about me like a chronical Dif- 
temper ; narticularly the Defire of feeing my new Plan- 
tation in the Jfland, and the Colony I lcft there, run in» 
my Head continually. I dream'd of it all Night, and 
my Imagination ran upon it all Day * it was uppermofl 
in all my Thoughts, and my Fancy work'd fo fteadily 
and ßrongly upon it, that I talk'd of it in my Sleep * 
in fhort, nothing could remove it out of my Mimd : It 
cvcn broke fo violcntly into all my Difcoorie*, that it 
made my Conrerfation tirefome ; for I cauld talk of no.* 
thing elfe ; all my Difcourfe run into it, even to Impcrtw 
ncoce i and I faw it myfelf. 

I have often heard Perfons of good Jndgmcnt fay, that 
all the Stir People make in the World about Ghofts and 
Apparitioas, is owing to die Strength of Imagination» 
and the powerful Operation of Fancy in their Minds ; 
that there is no fuch thing as a Spirit appearing, or a 
Ghoft Walking, and tbe lifo: That People' s poring af~ 
fe&ionately upon the paft Converfation of their deceas'd 
Friends, fo realizes it to them, that they are capable of 
faafying upon fotne extraordinary Circumftances, that 
they fee them, talk to them, and are anfwered by them ; 
wtan, iüTruth, there is nothing but Shadow and Vapour 
in the thing, and they really know nothing of the Matter. 

For my Part, I know not to this Hour, whether 
iktre are any fach things as real Apparitions, Speeres, 
or Walking of People after they are dead, or whether 
there is any thing in the Stories they teil us of that kind, 
laore than the Produft of Vapours, fick Minds, and 
wandering Fanciea ; But thrs I know, that my Jmagina- 



ROBINSON CRUSOE; y 

tum work'd up to fach a Height» and hrought me intö 
fach Exccü of Vapoars, or what cUc I may call it, that 
I a&uaUy fnppofed myfelf pftcntimcs opon the Spot, at 
my -old Caftle. behind the Treea ;* faw my oW Spaniard, 
Frida? % Father, and the reprobate Saüors, whom I left 
npon thc Ifland: Nay, I fanfy'dl talk'd with them, and 
look'd at them fo äeadtfy, thV I was broad awake, a* 
at Perfons juft bcforc me ; and this I did, tili I ofte» 
irighteaed myiclf with the Images my Fancy reprcfented 
to me. One Time in my Slcep, I Had the Villainy of 
the three Pirate Sailors fo lwely related to me» by the 
iirlt Spmuord, and Frida/ & Father, that it was forprifing; 
they told me how they barbaroofly attempted to murder 
all the Sfvmiards, and that they fet Fire to th# Provi- 
£ens they had laid up, on purpofe to diftreft and ftarve 
them i thinga that I had never heard of, and that yet 
were all of them trae in, Fa& : And it was fo warm in 
my Imagiaatiop, and fo reali^'d to me, that to the Hour 
I faw them» I oould not be perfuaded, but that it wa* r 
01 woold be troe 5 alfo bow I refented it, when the fya- 
«Wf eomplained to me; and how I brought them to 
Juäfctv try'd.them beforo me, and ordered them all 
three to be hang'd : What there was rcaUy in thi#-, mall 
be feenin its. Place : Tor however I came to form fach 
«hing« in my Dream, and what fecret Converfe of Spi- 
rits iojßäed ie, yet there was, 1 Jay, rery mach of k 
trae. I ort n that this Dream had nothing in it literaily 
and fpecifically true y but the general Part was fo truo; 
the bafe and villainous Behavioor of thefe three harden'd 
Rogoes was fach, and had bcen fo mach worfe than au 
I can defcribe, that the Dream had too much Similitode 
of the Faft ; and as I wouM afterwards have pnaiihed 
them fcvcrely, fo if I had hanged them all, I had bcen 
mach in the Right, and fhould have been ja&hed both 
by the Lawt of God and Man. 

But to retarn to mj Story : In this kind of Temper 
1 had lived form« Years ; X had no Enjoyment of my 
Life, no pleafant Hoars, no agreeable Diverfion, bat 
what had fomething or other of this in it ;• fo that my 
Wife, who faw my Mind fo wholly bent upoa it, told

which had determined ine to go thitker again ,• and Aat 
fhe found nothing hindcred my going, but my being en* 
gag'd to a Wife and Children. She told me, that it was 
true, (he%ould not thkk of parting with me ; bat as fhe 
was affured, that if (he was dead, it would be the firft 
thing I would do ; fo, as it feenVd to her, that the thing 
was determined above, fhe would not be the only Ob- 
ftruäion : For, if I thought fit, and refolv'd to go * 

Hcre fhe found me very intent upon her Words, and that 
I look'd very eameftly at her ; fo that it a little difor- 
dered her, and fhe ftopt. I afked her why fhe did not go 
on, and fay out what fhe was going to fay. But I pcr- 
celved her Heart was too füll, and fome Tears ftood in* 
her Eyes : Speak out, my Dear, faid I : Are you wil- 
ling [ fhould go. No, fays ße t *very affeßhnately , I am 
far from willing: But if you are refolved to go, fays fhe, 
rather than I will be the only Hindrance, I will go with 
you ; for though I think it a prepofterous thing for one 
of your Years, and in your Condition, yet if it muft be> 
faid fhe again, weeping, I won't leave you ; for if it be 
of Heaven, you muH do it, there is no refifting it ; and 
if Heäven makes it your Duty to go, he will alfo make 
it mine to go with you, or otherwile difpofe of me, that 
I roay not obftruft it. 

This affe&ionate Behaviour of my Wife, brought me 
a Utile out of the Vapours, and I began to confider what 
I was a doing : I correäed my wandering Fancy, and 
began to argue with myfelf fedately, what Bufmefs I had, 
after threefcore Years, and after fuch a Life of tedious 
Sufferings and Difafters, and clofed in fo happy and eafy 
a Manner, I fay, what Bufinefs had I to rufh into new 
Hazards, and put myfelf upon Adventures, fit only for 
Youth and Poverty to run into ? 

With thofe Thoughts, I confidered my new Engage- 
ments, that I had a Wife, one Child born, and my Wife 
then great with Child of another; that I had all the 
World could give me, and had no need to feek Hazards 
for Gain ; that I was declining in Years, and ought to 
think rather of leaving what I had gained, than of feek- 
ing to increafe it ; that as to what my Wife had faid, of 
its being an Impulfe from Heaven, and that it fhould 
be my Duty to go, I had.nö Notion of that ; fo after 

ma.tv^ 



ROBINSONCRUSOE. 9 

many of thefe Cogitations, I ftruggled wich thc Power 
of my Imagination, reafon'd myfelf out of it, as Ibelievt 
Peo£jit0ay ahvayj do in hke Cafes , if tbey *will\ and, in a 
^word, I conquered it; compos'd myfelf wich fuch Argu- 
ments as occurred to my Thoughts, and which my pre- 
fent Condition furnifli'd me plentifully wich; and paracu- 
lar'ly, as the moft effeäual Method, I rdblv'd to divert 
myfelf with other things, and to engage in fome Bufinefs 
that might effe&ually tie me up from any more Excur- 
fions of this Kind ; for I found the thing return'd upon 
me chiefly when I was idle, had nothing to do, or any 
thing of Moment immediately before me. 

To tbjs Purpofe I bought a little Farm in the County 
of Bed/brd, and refolved to remove myfelf thirher. I had 
a little convenient Houfe upon it, and the Land about it 
I found was capable of great Improvement, and that it 
was many ways fuited to my IncJinaüon, which delighted 
in Cuhivating, Managing, Planting, and Improving cf 
Land; and particularly, being an Inland County, I was 
removed from converfing among Ships, Saüors, and 
fhings relating to the remoce Parts of the World. 

In a word, I went down to my Farm, fettled my Fa-. 
raily, bought me Ploughs, Harrows, a Cart, Waggon,, 
Horfes, Cows, Sheep; and, fetting ferioufly to work, 
became in qne half Year, a mere Country Gentleman ; 
my Thoughts were intirely taken up in managing my 
Servants, cultivating the Ground, Inclofing, Planting, 
&c. and I liv'd, as I thought, the moft agreeable Life, 
that Naturc was capable of dire&iog, or that a Man 
alwaysbred to Misfortunes was capable of being retreaied ■ 
to. 

I farm'd upon my own Land, I had no Rent to pay,. 
was limited by no Articles; I could pull up, or cut 
down, as I pleafed : What I planted was for myfelf;,, 
and what I improved was for my Family ; and having, 
thus left ofF the Thoughts of Waadering, I had not 
the Jeaft Difcomfort in any Part of my Life, a& to tbis, » 
World. Now I thought indeed, that I enjoy'd that, 
roiddle State of Life, which my Father fo earneftly. re.' 
commended to me : A kind .of Heavenly Life, fome- 
thing like what is defcribed by the Poet upon thfi SmVw\ 
je& of a Countrj Life : ^

« Bat in the Middle of all this Felicity, one Blow from 
unfeen Providenee unhing'd nie at once ; and not only 
made a Breach apon me inevitable and incurable ; bat 
drove me by its Confequence, upon a deep Relapfe into 
the wandering Difpofition, which, as I may fay, being 
born in my very Bfood, foon recovcr'd its Hold of me, 
and/ Iike die Returns of a violent Diftemper, came on 
with an irrefiftible Force apon me ; fo that nothing could 
xsake auy more Impreffion upon me. This Blow was the 
Lofs of my Wife. 

It i* not my Bufmefs here to write an Elegy upon my 
Wife, to give a Charakter of her particular Virtues, and 
make my Court to the Sex by the Flattery of a Funerai 
Sermon. She was in a few Words, the Stay of all my 
Affairs, the Centre of all my Enterprifes ; the Engine», 
that by her Prudence reduc'd me to that happy Compafs 
I was in, from the moft extravagant and ruinous ProjccY 
that fhitter'd in my Head, as above; and did more ta 
guide my rambling Genius, than a Mother's Tears, a 
Jfather's Inftru&ions, a Friend's Counfel, or all my own 
reafoning Powers, could do. I was happy in liftening fa 
her Tears, and in being mov'd by her Intreaties, and to 
the lad Degree defölate and diflocated in the World by 
the Lofs of her. 

When fhe was gone, the World look'd aukwardly 
round me; I was as much a Stranger in it, in my 
Thoughts, as I was in the Brafils, when I firft went on. 
Shore there ; and as much alone, except as to the Affift- 
ance of Servants, as I Was in my Ifland. I knew neither 
What to do, or what not to do. I faw the World bofy 
voxmd me, one Part labouring for Bread* and the other 
fquandering it in vile ExceiTes, or empty Pleafures; 
equally miferable, becaufe the End they propofed fUlt 
jfed from them ; for the Men of Pleafure every Day iur- 
fched of their Vice, and heaped up Work for Sorrew 
and Repentance ; and the Men of Labour fpent their 
*Strength ra daffy Stragglings for Bread, to maintain the 
vimi Strcnßih thqr laJwur'd with * fo living i*a daily 



ROBINSON CRüfOE. ir 

Circolation of Sorrow, living bat to work, and working 
bat to live, as if daily Bread were the only End of 
wcarifome Life, and a wearifome Life the only Occafion 
of daily Bread. 

This put me in mind of the Life I lived m my King« 
dorn, the Bland ; where I fufFcred no oore Com to grow, , 
becanfe I did not want it; and bred no raore Goats, be- 
taute I had no raöre Ufe fbrthem : Wbere the Money 
lay in the Drawcr tili it grew mildew'd, andhad fearc* 
the Fävour to be looked upon in 20 Year». 

All thefe tbings,, had I improved them as I ooghfe 
to have done, and as Reafon and Religion had di&ated 
to me, would have taught me to fearch further than hu- 
man Enjoyments for a fall Felicity, and that there was 
fomething which certainly was the Reafon and End of 
Life, fuperior to all thefe thing», which was either fo 
be pofle&'d, or at leaft hoped for on this Side the Grave. 

Bot my fage Coonfellor was gone ; I was Hke a Ship, 
withoat a Pilot, that coald only ran afore the Wind: My 
Thoaghts run all away again into the old Affair ; my 
Uead was qaite turn'd with the Whimfies of foreign 
Adventares ; and all the pleafing innocent Ainufement»? 
of my Farm, and my Garden, my Cattle and my Family» . 
which befbre intirely poffeÄ me, were nothing to me ; had 
no Relifh, and were like. Maße to one that has- no Ear«. 
or Food to one that has no Tafte : In aword, I refolv'd- 
to leave o£ Hoafekeeping, lett my Farm, and retarn to* 
London; and in a few Mönchs after, I did fo. 

When I came to London, I.was ftill as- aneafy as be*

-the thing, which of all Circamfbmces ofLife was the 
moft my. Averfion, who had been all my Days ufed ta 
an aclrve Life.; and I weold often fay to myfelf, A State

12 The Life and Adventures ef 

brougr.t up to the Sea, and had made him Commander of 
a Ship, was come Home fiom a (hört Voyagc to Bi/hoa, 
being the ürit he had made : He came to me, and told 
me, that fome Merchants of his Acquaintance had been 
propöfing to him to go a Voyage for them to the Eaß- 
Jndies, and to China, as private Traders : And ntnv, Uncle, 
fays he, if you «vili go to Sea «with me, TU engage to Und 
you upon your oJd Halitation in the J/Iand, for «we are'to toucb 
at the Brafils. 

Nothing can be a greater Demonftration of a future 
State, and of the Exiftence of an invifible World, than 
the Concurrence of fecond Canfes with the Ideas of things, 
which we form in our Minds, perfe&ly referv'd, and not 
communicated to any in the World. 

My Nephew knew nothing how far my Diftemper of 
Wandering was return 'd upon me, and I knew nothing of 
what he had in his Thoughts to fay ; when that very 
Morning before he came to me, I had, in a great deal of 
Confufionof Thought, and revolving cvery Part of my 
Circumftances in my Mind, come to tnis Resolution ; «viz. 
That I would go to Lifion, and confult with my old Sea- 
Captain; and fo, if it was rational and praäicable, I 
would go and fee the Ifland again, and fee what was be-* 
come of my People there : I had pleafed myfelf alfo with 
the Thoughts of peopling the Place, and carrying Inha- 
bitants from hence, getting a Patent for the Poflefiion, and 
I know not what 5 when, in the Middle of all this, in 
comcs my Nephew, as I have faid, with his Project of 
carrying me thither, in his Way to the Eaßhdics. 

I paus'd a while at his Words, and looking fleadily 
at him, «what De<vil, faid I, fent ycu on tlis unlucky Er* 
rand? My Nephew ftartled, as if he had been frighted 
at firft; but perceiving I was not much difpleafed with 
the Propofal, he recovered himfelf : I hope it may not 
be an unlucky Propofal, Sir, fays he; I dare fay you 
would be pleas'-d to fee your new Colony there, where 
von once reigned with mpre Felicity, than moft of your 
JJrother Monarchs «n the World. 

Jn a word, the Scheme hit fo exaclly with my Tem- 
per, that is to fay, with the PrepoiTeffion I was under,. 
andof which I have faid (o much, that I told him in 
£ew Wüaus, if he agreed with the Merchants, 1 would 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 13 

go with him : But I told him, I would not promife to go 
any fartber than my own lüand. W.hy Sir, fays he, you 
dont nvant to be left there again, I bopt ? Why, faid • I, can 
jtou not take mt up again in your Return ? He told me, it 
would not be poüible to do fo ; that the Merchants 
woald nerer allow him tö come that Way with a loaden 
Ship of fach Value, it being a Month's fail out of his 
Way, and xnight be three or foor : Befides, Sir, if Ißcwld 
mif carry, faid he, and mt return at all, then you. wouid be 
jufl reduced to tht Condition you nvere in before. 

This was very rational; but we both found out a 
Remedy fbr it, which was to carry a framed Sloop on/ 
board the Shit>, which, being „taken in Pieces, and 
ihip'd on board the Ship, might, by the Help of fome 
Carpenters whom we agreed to carry with us, be fet up 
again in the lüand, and finifh'd, fitto go to Sea in a few 
Days. 

1 was not long refolving ; for indeed the Importuni- 
tiesof ray Nephew, join'd in fo efFe&ually with my In- 
clination, that nothing could oppofe me: On the other 
hand, my Wife being dead, I had nobody that concern- 
ed themfelves fo much for me, as to perfuade me one 
way or other, except my antient good Friend the Wi- 
dow, who earneftly ftruggled with me to confider my 
Years, my eafy Circumftances, and the needlefs Hazard 
•f a long Voyage 5 and, above all, my young Childrcn : 
But it was all to no Purpofe, I had an irrefiftible Defire

i6 Tkt Life and Adventvres of 

We fet out the 5th of February from Inland, and had 
a very fair Gale of Wind for fome Days ; as I rem cm- 
ber, it might be aboüt the 2oth of February in the Even- 
ing, late, when the Mate, having die Watch, came into. 
the Round-hoafe, and told us, he faw a Flafh of Fire, and 
heard a Gun fired; and while he was tclling us of it, a. 
Boy came in, and told us the Boatfwain heard another, 
This made us all run out upon the Quarter- deck, where 
for a while we heard noihing ; but in a few Minutes we 
law a very great Light, and found that there was fome. 
very terrible Fire at a Diftance ; immediately we had re- 
courfe tp our Reckonings, in which we all agrecd, that 
there could be no Land that Way, in which the Fire 
fhewed itfelf, no, not for 500 Leagues ; for it appeared 
at W. N. W. Upon this we concluded it muß be fome 
Ship on Fire at Sea ; and as by our Hearing the Noife. 
of Guns juil before, we concluded it could not be far. 
off, we flood directly towards it, and were prefentiy fa- 
tjfüed we fhould difcover it, becaufe the farther we 
failed, the greater tbe Light appearM, tho' the Weather 
being haay, we could not perceive any thing but the. 
Light for a while: In about half an llour's Sailing, the 
Wind being fair for us, tho' not much ©f it, and tke 
Weather Clearing up alittle, we could plainly difeern, that 
it was a great Ship on Fire in the Middle of the Sea. I 
was moft fenfibly touched with this Difafter', though not 
at all acquaioted wkh the Perfons engaged in it $ I pre- 
fentiy recolledted my forcner Circumilances, in what Con- 
dition 1 was in, when taken up by the Po tugal Captain ; 
and how much more deplorable the Circumftances of the 
poor Creatures belonging to the Ship muÄ be, if they 
had no other Ship in Company with them : Upon this, 
I immediately ordered, that five Guns fhould be fired, 
one foon afeer another, that, if poflible, we might give 
Notice to them, that there was Help for them at har.d, 
and that they might endeavour to fave themfelves in their 
Boat ; for though we could fee the Flame in the Ship, 
»t they, it being Night, could fee nothing of us. 
%We lay by fome Time upon this, only driving as the 
buming^Ship drove, waiting for Day-light ;. when on a 
fanden, to our grfat Terror, though- we had Reafon 
to expeft it, the Ship blew up in • the Air, and imme- 
diately* 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 17 

diately, that is to fay, in a few Minutes, all the Fire 
was out, that is to fay, the reft of the Ship funk : This 
was terrible, and indeed an afflicling Sight, for the Sake 
of the poor Men, who, I concluded, muft be either alt 
deftroyed in the Ship, or be in the utmoft Diftrefs in 
their Boats in the Middle of the Ocean, which, at pre- 
fent, by reafon it was dark, I could not fee : However, 
to direä them as well as I could, I caufed Lights to be 
hang out in all the Parts of the Ship where we could, 
and which we had Lanthorns for, and kept firing Gnns 
all the Night long ; letting them know by this, that 
there was a Ship not far off. 

About Eight o'Clock in the Morning, we difcovered 
the'Ship's Boats, by the- Help of our Perfpe&ive-glafles • 
and found there were two of them, both throng'd with 
People, and deep in the Water : We perceived they 
row'd, the Wind being againft them ; that they faw our 
Ship, and did the utmoft to make us fee them. 

We immediately fpread our Ancient, to let them 
know we faw them ; and hung a Waft out, as a Signal 
for them to come on board ; and then made more Sau, 
(Unding directly to them. In a little.more than half an 
Hour, we camö up with them, and, in a Word, took 
them all in, being no lefs than fixty-four, Men, Women, 
and Children ; for there were a great many Paflengers. 

Upon the whole, we found it was a French Merchant- 
lhip of 300 Tons, homeward-bound from Quebeck, in 
the River of Canada. The Malier gave us a long Ac- 
count of the Diftrefs of his Ship, how the Fire began in 
the Steerage, by the Negligence of the Steerfman ; but, 
on his crying out for Help, was, as every Body thought, 
intirely put out: But they foon found, that fomeSparks 
of the firft Fire had gotten into fome Part of the Ship, 
{o difficult to come at, that they could not efFeftually 
quench it ; and afterwards getting in between the Tim- 
bers, and within the Ceiling of the Ship, it proeeeded 
into the Hold, and maftered all the Skill, and all the 
Application, they were able to exerc. 

They had no more to do then, but to get into their 
Boats, which, to their great Comfort, were pretty large ; 
fcfeing their Long-boat, and a great Shallop, befides a 
fmall Skiff, which was of no great. &tmct Xö ^ga\&i

They had indeed fmall Hope of their Lives by getting. 
Iota thefc Boats at that Diftance from any Land ; only, 
*s they faid well, that they were efcaped from the Fire, 
lad had a Pofiibility, that fome Ship might happen to

Öars, and a Compafs ; and were preparing to make the

as mach Provifions and Water, as, with fparing it

about 12 Dayt ; in which, if they had no bad Weather, 
and no contrary Winds, the Captain faid, he hoped ho 
night get to the Banks of Nvwfouxdbutd, and might per- 
haps take fome Füh to fnftain them tili they might go

their Limbs; contrary Winds to keep them oajt, aad' 
fiarve them ; that it mnft have been next to aiiracqloas» 
if they had efcaped. 

In taeMidft of their ConfaTtations, every one bcing 
hopelefs, and ready to defpair, the Captain with Twa- 
in his Eyes told me, they were on a fuddeniarpris'd withr 
thejoy of hearing aG an fire, and after that fonr more;. 
thefe were the fiveGans which Icanfed to be fir'd at firft 
ieeing the Light : This reviv'd their Hearts, and gave them 
the Notice, which, as a6$ve, I defign'd h (hoold, was. that 
there was a Ship at hand for their Help. 

It was npon the hearing thefe Gans, that they took 
down their Mails and Sajto ; and the Sound coming from 
the Windward, they refolved to lie by tili Morning, 
Some Time after this, hearing no more Gans, they fired 
three Mafqaets, one a conftderable while after another y 
bat thefe, the Wind being contrary, we never heard. 

Some Time after that again, they were (Uli more 
agreeably forprifed with feeing our Lights, and hear- 
ing the Gans, which, as I nave faid, I caufed to 
be fired all the reft of the Night; this fet them to 
work with their Oars to keep their Boats a-head, at

Souls at fo uaexpeäed a Dettverance ; Gf ief and Fea»

a fow were croffing themfelvea, and giving God Thanksv 

I woold not wrong them nekher; there might be many 
that were thankful afterward $ but the Paffion was too 
ftrong rbr them at £rft 9 and they were not able to mafter

fhould be the nexc Minute be dancing and hallowing Hke

pulling his Cloaths to Pieces, and ftamping them under 
his Feet Hke a Madman ; a few Minuces after that, wc 
fhould have him all in Tears, then fick, then fwooning % 
and had not immediate Help been had, would, in a 
few. Moments more, have been dead; and thus it was, 
not with one or two, or ten or twenty, but with the 

freate.it Part of them ; and, if I remember right, our 
urgeoa was obliged to let above thirty of them Blood. 
l'here were two Priefts among them, one an old Man, 
and the other a young Man ; and that which was iirangeft 
was, that the oldeft Man was the worft. 

As foon as he fet his Foot on board our Ship, and 
faw himfelf fafe, he dropped down ftone-dead, to all 
Jppearana ; not the leaft Sign of Life could be per- 
ceived in him ; our Surgeon immediately applied- proper 
Remedies to recover him, and was the only Man in the 
Ship that believed he was not dead : And at length he 
opened a Vein in his Arm, having firft chafed and rub- 
bed the Part, Co as to warm it as much as poffible: Upoa 
this the Blood, which only dropped at firft, flowed 
fomething freely ; in three Minutes after the Man open'd 
his Eyes ; and about a Quarterofan Hour after that, he 
fpoke, grew better, and, in a little Time, quite well i 
after the Blood was ftopped, he walked about, told us 
he was perfedly well, took a Dram of Cordial which 
the Surgeon gave him, and was, what we calkd, ccme 
to bimßtfi about a Quarter of an Hpur after this, they 
came running into the Cabin ^to the Surgeon, who was 
bleeding a French Woman that had fainted ; and told 
him, the Prieft was gone ftark mad. It feems he had 
began to revolvethe Change of his Circumftances in

Spirits whirled about fafter than the Veflels could convey

was as fit for Bedlam, as any Creature that ever wis in

and well. 

The younger Prieft behaved himfelf with great Com« 
mand of his Paffion, and was really an Example of a 
ferious well governed Mind ; ac his firft Coming on board 
the Ship, he threw himfelf flat on his Face, proftrating 
himfelf in Thankfulnefs for his Delivercnce ; in which I 
unhappily and unfeafonably difturbed him, really think- 
ing he had been in a Swoon ; bat he fpake calraly ; thanlc- 
ed me ; told me, he was giving God Thanks for his De« 
Jiverance ; begged me to leave him- a few Moments, 
and* that, next to his Maker, he would give me Thanks 
alfo. 

I was heartily forty that I difturbed him ; and not on« 
ly left him, but kept others from interrupting him alfo ; 
he continued in that Pofture about three Minutes, or 
a little more, after I left him ; then came to me, as he 
•had faid he wonld, and, with a great deal of Serioufnefs 
and AiFe&ion, but with Tears in his Eyes, thanked me, 
that had, under God, given him, and fo many miferable 
Creatures their Lives : I told him, I had no room to 
move him to thänk God for it, rat her than me ; for I 
had feen, that he had- done that already : But J added, 
that it was nothing bttt^what Reafon and Humamty dic- 
tated to all Men, and that we had as much Reafon as he 
to give Thanks to God, who had blefled ns fo far as to 
snake ns the Inftruments of his Mercy to fo many of his 
Creatures. 

After this, the yoang Prieft applied himfelf to his Coun- 
try-folks, laboured to compofe them ; perfuaded, in- 
treated, argaed, reafoned with them, and did his utmoft 
to keep them within the Exercife of their Reafon ; and 
with fome he had Succefs, tho 1 others were, for a Time, 
out of all Government of themfelves. 

I cannot help committing this to Writing, as perhaps 
it may be nfetal to thofe into whofe Hands it may fall,

We were fomething4iföjdered by thefe Extravagancies 
imong our new Guefts for the firft Day ; bat when they 
had been retired, Lodgtngs provided for themjas well at 
our Shijp would allow, and they had fiept heartily, at 
moft of them did, being fatigued and frightened, they 
were quite another Sott of People the next Day. 

Nothing of good Mannen, or civil Acknowledgs&ents 
for the KiadneTs fliewn them, was wanttng ; the Fr*ncb 9 
'ris known, are naturally apt enough to excecd that Way. 
The Captain, and ose of the Priefts, came to me tk* 
next Day ; and, defiring to fpeak with me and my Ne- 
phew, the Commander, began to confuit with as what 
fhould be done with them ; and firft they told us, that, 
as we had faved their Livei, fo all they had was little 
* enough for a Return to us for the Kindnefs reeeived. 
The Captain faid, they had faved fome Money, aad fönt* 
things of Value in their Boats, cateh'd haftily out of die 
Flame* ; aad if we would aeeept it, they- were ordered 
to aaake an Offer of it all to us ; they only defired to be 
fet on Shore fomewhere in our Way, where, if poffibiet 
they might get a PafTage to France. 

My Nephew was for acospting their Money at firft 
Word, and to confider what to do with them afterward*; 
but I over-ruled bim in that Part; for I knew what it 
was to be fet on Shore in a Arange Country ; and if the 
Portugal Captain, that took me up at Sea, had ferved 
xne fo, and took all I had for my DeHverance, I muß 
have ftarved, or have been as much a Slave at the Bra- 
fils, as I had been at Barbary, the being firid to a Ma- 
bömetan only excepted ; and perhaps a Portutsufe is not 
a mach better Mafier than a 1urk 9 if not, in tonte Cafes, 
amuchworfe. ' . 

I therefoie told the Frencb Captain, that we had taken 
them up in their Diftreft, it was true ; but that it was 
our Duty to do fo, as we were Fellow-creatures, and as 
we would defire to be fo deHrered, if we were in the 
like or any other Extfcmity j that we had dose nothiag 
for them, bat what wc believed they would have done 
for us, if we had been in their Cafe, and they in ours ; 
bot that we took them up to ferne 4cm, not to plunder

take that little from them which they had fcv'd oot of 
the Firc, and then fet them on Shore, and Jeavc them ; 
that this woald be Äfft to fare them from Death, and 
then kill them oorfelires ; fave them from drowning, and 
then abandon them to ftarving; and therefore I wonld 
not let the leaft thing be taken from them : As to fetting 
them 011 Shore, I told them indeed, that was an exceed- 
tng Difikalty to ns, for that the Ship was bound to the 
Eaß-Indies ; and though we were driven ont of xmt 
Coarfe to the Weftward a vtry great Way, which perhapt 
was dire&ed by Heaven on Purpofe for their JDeliverance, 
yet it was impoffible for ns wilfally to change our Voyage 
•an this particolar Account; nor conld my Nephew, the 
Captain, anfwer it to the Freighters, with whom he was 
«inder Charter-party to parfoe his Voyage by the Way 
of Brgfili and all I knew he conld do for them was, to 
pnt ourfelves in die Way of meeting with other Ships 
Aomeward-bound from the Wtß-fodits, and get them 
Pafläge, if poffible, to Endond or France, 

The firlt Part of the Propofal was fo generons and 
kind, they conld not bat be very thankfal for it ; bot 
they were in a great Confternation, efpecially the Paf- 
iengers, at the Notion of bemg carried away to the E*ft-

fo far to the Weftward before I met with them, I wonld

fmmdUmd, where it was poffible I might meet with fom% 
Ship or Sloop that they might hire to carry them back ts> 
•Caaada, from whence they came. 

I thought this was bnt a reafönable Reqneft on dieir 
Part ; and therefore I inclined to agree to it 5 for indeed 
I confidered, that to carry this whole Company to the 
Etf-Indies, wonld not only be an krtoterable Severity to 
the poor People", btit wonld be reiningour whole Voy-

with: When, I fay, all the Frencb went on Shore, I 
{hould remember, that the young Prieft I fpoke of, 
hearing we were bound to the Eaß-IndUs, defired to 
go the Voyage with us> and to be fet on Shore pn the 
Coaft of. Corvmandtl: I readily agreed to that; for I 
wonderfully liked the MaD, and had very good I^eafon, 
as will appear afterwards; alfo four of the Seamen 
entered themfelves in our Ship, and proved very ufeful 
Fellows. 

From hence we direäed our Courfe for the Weß- 
Indies y fteerjng away S. and S. by £. for about 20 Days 
together, fometimes little or no Wind at all, when wc 
met with another Subjeft for our Humanity to work up- 
on, almoft as deplorable as that before. 

It was in the Latitude of 27 Degrees 5 Minutes N. 
and the I9th Day of Marcb, 16945, when we 'fpy'd 
a Sail, our Courfe S. E. and by S. We foon perceived 
it was a large Vettel, and that (he bore up to us ; but 
could not at firft know what to make of her, tili, after 
Coming a little nearer, we found (he had loft her Main- 
top-mzh, Fore-maft, and Boltfprit ; and prefently fhe

fires a Gun as. a Signal of Diftrefs ; the Weathcr was 
pretty good, Wind at N. N. W. a freftx Gale, and we 
foon came to fpeak wich her. 

We fotind her a Ship of Brißol y bound home from 
Barbados y but had been blown out of the Road at 
Bar ba Joes , a few Days before (he was refcdy to fail, by 
a terrible Hurricane, while the Captain and chief Mate 
were both gone on Shore; fo that befide the Terror of 
the Storni, they were but in an indifferent Cafe for good 
Artifts to bring the Ship home : They had been already 
nine Weeks at Sea, and had met with another terrible 
Storm, after the Hurricane was over, which had blown 
thera quite out of their Knowledge to the Weftward, 
and in which they loft iheir Mails., as above ; they told 
us, they cxpccled to have feen the BaJmma Iilands, but 
were then driven away again to the South-eafr, by 3 
ftrong Gale of Wind at N . N. W. the fame that blew 
uow, and having no Sails to work the Ship with, but a 
Maincourfe, and a Kind of fquare Sali upon a Jury« 
fore-maft, which they had fet up, they could not lie 
near the Wind, but were endeavouring to ftand away 
for the Canaries. 

But that which was worft of all, was, that they were 
almoft ftarv'd for Want of Provifions, befides the Fatigues 
they had undergone ; their Bread and Ftefh was quite 
gone, they had not anOunce left in the Ship, and had 
had none for elevenDays; the only Relief they had» 
' was, their Water was not all fpent, and they had about 
half a Barrel of Flour left ; they bad Sugar enough ; foxne 
Succades or Sweet-meats they had at firit, but they were 
devoar'd, and they had feven Cafks of Rum. 

There was a Youth and his Mother, and aMaid-fer- 
vant, on board, who were going Paflengers, and think- 
iog the Ship was ready to fail, unhappily came on board 
theEvening before the Hurricane began ; and, having no 
Provifions of their own left, they were in a more deple- 
rable Condition than the reft ; for the Seamen, being re- 
duced to fuch an extreme Neceflity themfelves, had no 
Compafllon, we may be füre, for the poor Paflengers ; 
and they were indeed in a Condition that their Mifery 
is very hard to deferibe.

26 Tke Life and Adventures of 

I had perhaps, not known this Part, if my Curiofity 
had not Jed me, the Weather being fair, and thc Wind 
abated, to go on board the Ship : The fecond Mate, 
who upon this Occalion commänded the Ship, had been 
on board our Ship ; and he told me indeed, that they 
had three Paflengers in the great Cabin, that they were. 
in a deplorable Condition ; nay, fays he, I believe they 
are dead, for I have heard nothing of them for above. 
two Days; and I was afraid to inquire after them, faid 
he, for 1 had nothing to relieve them with. 

We immediately applied ourfelves to give them what 
Relief we could fpare ; and indeed I had fo fax over- 
ruled things with my Nephew, that I would have viflu- 
alled them, though we had gone away to Virginia, orany 
Part of the Coaft of America, to have fupplied ourfelves ; 
but there was no Neceflitv for that. 

But now they were in a new Danger; for they were 
afraid of eating too much, even ofthat little we gave them ; 
the Mate or Commander brought fix Men with him in his 
Boat ; but thefe poor Wretches look'd like Skeletons, and 
werefo weak, they could hardly fit totheir Oars: The Mate 
himfejf was very ill, and half-ftarv'd ; for hedeclar'd he 
had referv'd nothing from the Men, and went Share and 
Share alike with them in every Bit they eat. 

1 caution'd him to eat fparingly, but fet Meat before 
him immediately, and he had not eaten three Mouthfuls 
bsfore he began to be fick, and out of Order ; fo he 
ftopt'awhile, and our Surgeon mix'd him up fomething 
with fome Broth, which he faid wauld be to him both 
Food and Phyfick ; and after he had taken it, he grew 
better : In the mean Time, l forgot not the Men ; 1 or- 
der'd Vi&uals to begiyen % them, and the poor Creatures 
rather devour'd than eat it; they were fo exceeding 
hungry, that they were in a Manner ravenous, and had 
no Commandof themfelvres; and two of them eat with 
fo much Greedinefs, that they were in Danger of their 
Lives the next Morning. 

The Sight of thefe Peoples Diflxefs was very moving 

to me, and brought to Mind what I had a terrible Pro- 

fpedt of at my nrft Coming on Shore in-my Ifland, where 

I had not the leaft Mouthful of Food, or any Hopes of 

procuring it; bcüdei the hourly ^Apprehenfiön I had 

*f 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 27 
©f beiüg roade the Food of other Creaturcs. But all 
the white the Mate was thus relating to me the mife- 
rable Condition of the Ship's Company, I could not put 
out of my Thought the Story he had told me of the 
thxee poor Creatures in the great Cabin ; (<viz ) the 
Mother, her Son, and the Maid-fervant, whom he had 
heard nothing of for two or three Days ; and whom he 
(cem'd to confefs they had wholly neglecled, their own, 
Extremities being fo great ; by which Iunderftood, that 
they had really given them no Food at all; and that 
therefote they nvuft be perimed, and be all lying dead 
perhaps od the'Floor or Deck of the Cabin. 

At f therefore kept the Mate, whom we then call'd Cap- 
tain, on boardjwith his-Men to refrelh them, fol alfo forgot 
not the ftarving Crew that were left on board, but order'd 
my own Boat to go board the Ship, and with my Mate and 
twelve Men to carry them a Sack of Bread, and four or fivö 
Pieces of Beef to boil. Oar Surgeon charg'd the Men to 
caufe theMeatto.be boil'd while they ftay'd, and to keep 
Guard in the Cook-room, to prevent the Mens taking it tc* 
eat ravv, or taking it out of the Pot before it was well boil- 
ed, and then to give every Man but a Utile at a Time ; 
and by this Caution he preferv'd the Men, who woull 
otherwife have kill'd themfelves with that very Food that 
was given them on Purpofe to fave their Lives. 

At the fameTime, I order'd the Mate to go into the greatf 
Cabin, ar.d feeinwhat Condition the poor railengers were 
inj and, if they were alive, to comfort them, and give theni 
what Refrefhment was proper ; and the Surgeon gave hin* 
a large Pitcher with Tome of the prepar'd Bi oth which he 
had given the Mate that was on board, and which he did 
not quedion would reftore them gradually. 

I was not fatisfy'd with this ; but, as I faid above, hav- 
ing a great Mind to fee the Scene of Mifery, which I knew 
the Ship itfelf would prefent me with, in a more lively 
Manner than I could have it by Report, I took the Cap- 
tain of the Ship, as we now caü'd hira, with me, and 
went myfeif a üttle after in their Boat. 

I found tlie poor Men on board almoft in a Tumult 
to get the Vicluals out of the Boiler before it was ready : 
But my Mate obferv'd his Order, and kc^t a. ^>cA 
Guard at the Cook-room Door * &nd ^ Maxv \\r

?laced there, afcer ufing all poßible Perfuafion Co have 
atience, kept them ofF by Force : However, he caus'd 
fome Bifcuitcakes to be dipp'd in the Poe, and foften'd 
them wich the Liquor of the Meat, which they call 
Brewi3, and gave them every one One, to ftay their 
Stomachs, and told them it was for their own Safetf 
that he was oblig'd to give them but littlc at a Time. 
Bat it was all in vain, and had I not comfe on board, 
and their own Commander and Officera with me, and 
with good Words, and Tome Threats alfo of giving them 
so more, I believe they would have broke into theCook- 
room by Force, and tore the Meat out of the Furnace; 
for Words indeed are of very fmall Force to an hungry 
Belly : However we pacify'd them, and fed them gradu- 
ally and cautioufly for the firft Time, and the next Time 
gave them more, and at laft filled their Beilies, and the 
Men did well enough. 

But the Mifery of the poor Paflengers in the Cabin 
was of another Nature, and far beyond the reft ; for as, 
firfl, the Ship's Company had fo little for them fei ves, it 
was but too true, that they had at firft kept them very 
low, and at lall total Jy negle&ed them ; fo> that for fix 
or feven Days, it might be faid, they had really had no 
Food at all, and for ieveral Days before, very little. 

The poor Mother, who, as the firft Mate reported, was 
a Woman of good Senfe, and good Breeding, had fpared 
all fhe could get fo afFeciionately for her Son, that at laft 
fhe intirely funk underit: And when the Mate of our 
Sbip went in, (he fat upon the Floor or Deck, with her 
Back up againil the Sides, between two Chairs, which 
were laflied faft, and her Head funk in between her Shoul- 
ders, like a Corpfe, though not quitc dead. My Mate 
fdd all he could to revive and encourage her, and with a 
Spoon put fome Broth into her Mouth ; fhe open'd her 
Lips, and lifted up one Hand, but could notfpeak; yet 
fhe undcrflood what he faid, and made Signs to him, in- 
timeting, that it was too late for her ; but pointed to her 
Child , as if lhe would have faid, they fhould take care 
of him. 

However the Mate, who was exceedingly moved with 
the Sight, endeavoured to get ferne of ihe Bio h into her 
Mouth ; and, as he faid, get two or threc Spcon'ulsdown, 

xViovL^h 



ROBINSONCRUSOE. 29 
though I queftion whecher he could be füre of it or not : 
Bat it was too late, and fhe died the fame Night. 

The Youth, who was preferved at the Price of his mo(t 
afFe&ionate Mother's Life, was not fo far gone ; yet he läy 
in a Cabin-bed as one ilretched out, wi;h hardly any Life 
left inhim; he had a Piece cf an old Glove in his Mouth, 
having eaten up the reft pf it ; howerer, being yoähg r 
and having möre Strength than his Mother, the Mate got 
fomething down his Throat, and he began fenfibly to re- 
vive, though by giving htm fome Time after but two or 
three Spooufuls extraordinary, he was very fick, ' and 
brought it up again. 

But" the next Care was the poor Maid ; fhe lay all 
along upon the Deck, hard by her Miftrefs, and juft 
like one that had fallen down with an Apoplexy, and 
ftrugs>led for Life : Her Litnbs were diftorted, one of 
her Hands was clafped round the Frame of one Chair, 
and (he griped it fo hard, that we could not eafily make 
her let h go ; her other Arm lay over her Head, and her 
Feet lay both together, fet faß againft the Frame of the 
Cabin-table ; in (hört, fhe lay juft like one in the laft 
Agonies of Death ; and yet fhe was alive too. 

The poor Creature was not only ftarved with Hunger, 
and terrified with the Thoughts of Death, but, as the 
Men told us afterward s, was broken-hearted for her Mi- 
ftrefs, whom fhe faw dying two or three Days befoi e, and 
whom fhe loved moft tenderly. 

We knew not what to do with this poor Girl ; for when 
Cor Surgeon, who was a Man of very great Knowledge 
and Experience, and with great Application recover'd 
her, as to Life, he had her upon his Hand as to her Senfes, 
for fhe was little lei's than diitracled for a confiderable 
Time after ; as (hall appear prefently. 

Whoever (hall read thefe Memorandums^ muß be de». 
fired to connder, that Vifits at Sea are not like a Jour- 
ney into the Coontry, where fometimes People ftay a 
Week or a Fortnight at a Place. Our Bufinefs was to 
relieve this diftrefied Ship's Crew, but not lie by for 
them ; and though they were willing to fleer the fame 
Courfe with us for fome Days, yet we could carry no 
Sail to keep Pace wich aShip that had noMo&v. Vtow- 
ever, as their Captain begged of us toVieA^ \i\m Vi SkX n*"*

a Main- top- malt, and a Kind of Top -maß to bis Jury« 
Fore-maft, we did, as it were, Jie by him for thrcc or 
four Days, and then having given him fivc Barrels of 
Beef and Pork, two Hogfheads of Bifcuit, and a Propor- 
tion of Pcas, Flour, and what other things we could 
ipare; and taking three Cafks of Sugar and fome Rum» 
and fome Pieces of Eight of them for Satisfaction, we 
left thcm, taking on board with us, at their own earneft 
Rcqueft, the Youth, and the Maid, and all their Goods. 

The young Lad was about feventeen Years of Age, a 
pretty, well-brcd, modeft, and fenfible Youth ; greatly 
dejecled with the Lofs of his Mother, and, as it feeras, 
had loft his Father but a few Months before at Bar* 
badoes. He begged of the Surgeon to fpeak to me, to 
take him out oi the Ship; for he faid, the cruel Fellows 
had murdered his Mother \ and indeed ß tbey had, that is 
to fay, fajjhvely j for they might have fpared a fmall Su- 
ßcnance to the poor helr lefs Widow, that might have 
prcferv'd her Life, though it had been juft to keep htr 
alive. But Hunger knows no Friend, no Relation, no 
Juftice, noRightj and therefore is reraorfclefs, and ca- 
pable of no Conipaßion. 

The Surgeon told him how far we were going, and 
how it would carry him awäy froin all his Friends, and 
put him perhaps in as bad Circumftances almoft, as * e 
found them in 5 that is to fay, ßarving in the World. 
He faid he mattered not whirher he went, if he was but 
delivered from the terrible Crew that he was among : 
That the Captain (by which he meant me, for he could 
know nothing of my Nephew) had faved his Life, and 
\t was füre would not hurt him ; and asfor the Maid, he 
was füre, if (he came to herfelf, (he would be very thank- 
ful for it, let us carry them whither we would. The Sur- 
geon reprefented the Cafe fo affeäionately to me, that I 
yielded, and we took them both on board with all their 
Goods, except eleven Hogflieads of Sogar, which could 
not be removed, or come at; and as the Youth had a 
Bill of Lading for them, I made his Commander fign a 
Writing, obliging him to go, as foon as he came to Bri- 
ßd t to one Mr. Rogers, a Merchant there, to whom the 
Youth faid he was related, and to delivera Letter which

could never kam, thatthe Ship came co Brifiol\ out was, 
as is moil probable, loil at Sea, being in fo difabled a Con- 
dition, and fo far from any Land, that I am of Opinion» 
the firftStorm ßiemet with afterwards, fhe might founder 
k »n the Sea; for fhe was leaky, and had Damage in her 
Hold when I met with- her. 

I was now in the Latitude of 19 Deg. 32 Min. and 
had hitherto had a tolerable Voyagc as to Weather, tho' 
at firft the Winds had been contrary. I (hall trouble no- 
bodjr with the little Incidents of Wind, Weather, Cur- 
rents, ci?r. on the refl of our Voyage ; but, (hortening 
my Story for the Sake of what is to i'olluw, ihall obferve 
that I came to my old Habitation, the Jfland, on the 
loth of Jpri/, 1695. It was with no fmall Ditfkuity 
that I found the Place ; for as I came to it, and went 
"from iw before, on the South and £aft fide of the Ifland, 
,as Coming from the Braß/s, fo ;iow Coming in between 
the -Main and the Ifland, and having no Chart for che 
Coaft, nor any Land mark, I did not kuow it when X 
Taw it, or know whether 1 faw it or no. 

We beat about a .great while, and went on Shore on 
few.al Ifland6 in the Mouth of the great River Oroonoque, 
but none for my-Purpofe; only this I learn'd by my coaft- 
iqg th.e Shore, that l was under one great Miftake before, 
vi«, that.tlve Continent which I thought I Caw, from the 
Jfland I lived.in, was really no Coiuinent, but a long 
Ifland, or rather a Ridge of lilands, reaching from one 
to the other Side of the excended Mouth of that great 
River ; and that theSavages who came to my Ifland, were 
not properly thofe which we call Caribees, but Ifl anders, 
and other Barb triam of the fame King, who inhabited 
fomething nearer to our Side than the reft. 

In /hört, I vifited feveral of the Iflands to no Purpofe ; 
fome I found were inhabited, and fome were not. On 
one of them I found fome Spaniards, and thought they 
had lived there ; but, fpeaking with them, found they 
had a Sloop lay in a fmall Creek hard by, and that they 
came thither to make Salt, and to catch fome PearUmuf- 
fels, if they could ; but they belonged to the lfle de Trini- 
dad, which lay farther North, in the Latitude of 10 and 
ix Degrees.

fair on the South-fide of my Ifland, and I prefently knew 
the very Countenance of the Place ; fo I brought the Ship 
fafc to an Anchor, Broadfide with the little Creek where 
was my old Habitation. 

As lbon as I faw the Place, I called for Friday^ and 
afk'd him, if he knew where he was ? He look'd about a 
little, and prefently clapping his Hands, cried; Oyes t 
tbtre) Oyes, O there t pointing to our old Habitation, and 
feil a dancing and capering hke a mad Fellow, and I had 
xnuch ado to keep him from jumping into the Sea, to 
fwim afhore to the Place. 

Well, Friday % faid I, do you think we fliall find any 
body here or no ? And what do you think, (hall we fee 
yourFather? The Fellow flood mute as a Stock a good 
while ; but when I nam'd his Father, the poor afFeclionate 
Creature look'd dejeäed ; and I could fee theTears rtm 
down his Face very plentifully. What is the Matter Fri- 
day, faid 1 ? Are you troubled becaufe you may fee your 
Fächer ? No, no, fays he> fhaking his Head, no fee him 
möre, no ever-more fee again. Wbyfi, faid I, Friday ? Itow 
do you knew tbat ? O no, O no, fays Friday, he long ago

dy, you don't know : But (hall we fee any one elfe then ? 
The Fellow, it feems, had better Eyes than I, andhepoints 
jnft to the Hill above my old Houfe ; and tho' we lay half a 
LeagueoiF, he cries out, Me fee !*me fee ! yes, yes, me fee 
much Man there, and there, and there. I look'd, bat I 
could fee nobody, no, not with a Perfpe£Hve-glafs ; which 
was, I fuppofe, becaufe I could not hit the Place ; for the 
Fellow was right, as I found upon Inquiry the next Day t 
and there were five or fix Men altogether flood to look 
at the Ship, not knowing whatto think of us. 

As foon as Friday had told me he faw People, I caus'd 
the Englijb Ancient to be fpread, and fired three Guns, 
(o give them Notice we were Friends ; and about half 
a Quarterofan Hour after, we perceiv'd a Smoke rife 
from the Side of the Creek ; fo I immediately order'd 
a Boat out, taking Friday with me ; and, hanging out a 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 33 

white Flag, ora Flag of Truce, I went direEIy ort 
Shore, taking with me the young Frier I mentioned, t? 
whom I had told the whole Story of my iiving there, 
änd the Männer of it, and every Particular,. both of my« 
felf, and thofe that I Ieft there ; and who was on that 
Account extremely defirous 10 go with me. We had be- 
fides about iixteen Men very well armed, if .we had found 
any new Gueft there which we did not know of ; but wc 
had no need of Weapons. 

As we went on Shore npon the Tide of Flood» near 
high Water, we rowed directly into the Creek; and 
the ürlk Man I fixed my Eye npon, was the Spamard 
whofe Life 1 had (aved, and whom I knew by his Face 
perfec"Uy weil ; as to his Habit, I fhall deferibeit aftejr- 
wards. 1 ordered nobody to go on Shore at firft but my- 
(elf, but there was no keeping Friday in the Boat ; for 
the aflfeclionate Creature had fpied his Father it a Di- 
ftance, a good Way ofF of the Spamards, where indeed 
1 faw nothing of him ; and if they had not let htm go 
on Shore, he would have jumped into the Sea. He was 
no fooner on Shore, but he flew away to his FatTier 
like an Arrow out of a Bow. h would have made any 
Man (hed Tears, in fpite of the frrmeft Refolution,, to 
have feeji the firft Tranfports of this poor Fellow*s Joy, 
when he came to his Father; how he embraced ,hirn, 
kiifed him» flroaked his Face, took hhn up in his Arms, 
fet him down npon a Tree, and lay down by him ; then 
flood and looked at him, as any one would look at a 
ftrange Piclure, for a Quarter of an Hour together ; then 
Tay down upon the Ground, and ftroaked his Legs, and 
kifsM them, and then got up again» and ftaT'd at him-; 
one would have thought the Fellow bewitched : But it 
would have made a Dog laogh to fee how the next Day 
his PaÜsoa ran out another way : Jn the Mbrning he 
walked along the Shore, to and-again, with his Father, 
feveral Hours, always leading him by the Hand, as if 
he had beenaLady; and every' now-and-fhen would 
come to fetch fomething or other for him to the Boat, 
cither a Lump of Sugar, or a Dram, a Bifcuit, or fome- 
thing or other that was good. In the Afternoon his 
Frolicks ran anotlier way, for then he would fet the old 
Mao' down npon the Ground, and d*uc& ibwx\tafcfc«i&.

made a thoufand antick Poftures and Geftures ; and all 
the while he did this, he would be talking to him, and 
telling him onc Story or another of his Travels, and of 
what had happcncd to him abroad, to divert him. Jn 
fhott, if the fame filial AfFeäion was to be found in Chri- 
flians to their Parcnt , in our Parts of the World, one 
would be tempted to fay, therc hardly would have been 
any Nced of the Fifth Commandment. , 

But this is a Digreflion ; I return to my Landing. It 
would be endlefs to take notice of all the Cercmonies and 
Civilities that the Spamards received me with. The firft 
Spattiard, whom as I faid, I knew very well, was he whofe 
Life I faved ; he came towards the Boat, attended by one 
more, carrying a Flag of Truce alfo ; and he did not only 
not know me atfirfl, but he had noThoughts, no Notion, 
cf its being me that was come, tili I fpöke tohim : Seig- 
nior, faid 1, in Portuguefe> do you not know me ? At which 
he fpoke not a Word j but giving his Mufquet to the Man 
that was with him, threw his Arms abroad, and faying 
ibmething in Spaniß, that I did not perfedtly hear, came 
forward, and embraced me, telling me he was inexcufable, 
not to know that Face again, that he had once feen, as of 
an Angel from Heaven, fent to fave his Life : He feid 
abundance of very handfome things, as a well-bred Spa- 
mard always knows how ; and then beckoning to the 
Terfon that attended him, bad him go and call out hi* 
Comrades. He then afked me, if 1 would walk to my old 
Habitation, where he would give me PorTeffion of my own 
Houfe again, and where I fhould fee there had been but 
mean Improvements ; fo I walkcd along with him ; but 
«las ! I could no more find the Place again, than if I had 
jnever been there ; for they had planted fo many Trees, and 
placed them in fuch a Pofture, fo thick and dofe tb ano-

Faäion in my good Fortune, when he heard that I was 
gone in a good Ship, and to my Satisfa&ion ; and Chat he 
had oftentinies a ftrong Perfuafion, that one Time or other

As to the thjjee Barhunans (fo he called them)' that

fays he, I hope you will not be difpleafed, when I (hall 
teil you how, forced by Neceflity, we were obliged, fpr our 
own Pre.fervation, to dii'arm tr.em, and making them our 
Subjekts, who would not be content with being moderately 
our Mallers, but would be our Murderers. 1 anfwered, I 
was heartily afraid of k when I left them there; and no- 
thing troubled me ac my parting from die lfland> but that 
they were not come back, that I might have put them in 
Poflefilon of every.thing firii, and left the other in a State 
of Subjedion, as they deierved : But if thcy had reduccd 
them to it, 1 was very glad, and fjiould be vtry far from 

" Unding aay Fault with it ; for I kncw they were a Parcel 
of refra&ory ungovcr nable Villains, and were fit for any * 
manner %f Mifchief. 

While I was faying thls, came the Man whom he 
jiad fent back, and with him elevcn Men more : In 
the Drefs they were in, it was impoffible to guefs what 
Nation they were of ; but he made all clear both to them 
and to nie. Firß he tu med to me, and pointing to them, 
faid, Thefe, Sir, are fome of the -Ge,ctlemen who owe 
their Lives toyou; and then turning to them, and point- 
ing to me, he let them lenow who I was ; upon which 
they all came up one by one, not as if they had been 
Sailors, and ordinary Fellows, and I the like, but really, 
as if they had been Ambafladors or Noblemen, and I 
a Monarch, or a great Conqueror : Their Behaviour was

became them ; and, in (hört, they had fo much more 
Manners than J, that I fearce knew how to reeeive their 
Civilirics, mueb lefs how to return them in kind. 

The Hiftory of their coming to, and Conduft in the 
Ifland, after my going away, is fo remarkable, and has 
fo many Incidents, which the former Part of my Relation 
will help to underftand, and which will, in moft of the 
Particulars, refer to that Account I have already giren, 
that I cannot bat commit them with great Delight to the 
Reading of thofe that come after me. 

1 (hall no longer trouble the Story with a Relation 
in the firft Perfon, which will put me to the Expence 
of ten thoufand faid T$, and faid be\ and he told me\ 
and / told bim's, and the like 5 but I (hall collect the 
Facls hiftorically, as near as I can gather them out of 
my Memory from what they related to me, and from 
what I met with in my Converting with them, and with 
the Place. 

In order to do this fuccin&ly, and as intelligibly as I 
can, I muH go back to the Circumiiance in which I left 
the liland, and which the Perfon s were in, of whom 
I am to fpeak. At firft it is neceflary to repeat, that I 
had fent away Fridays Father and the Spamard, the two 
whofe Lives I had refeued from the Savages ; I fay, 
1 had fent them away in a large Canoe to the Main, as I 
then thougbt it, to fetch over the Spaniard's Companions 
whom he had left behind him, in order to fave them from 
the like Calamity that he had been in ; and in order to 
fuecour them for the prefent, and that, if poffible, we 
might together find fome way for our Deliverance after- 
ward. 

When I fent them away, I had no vifible Appearance 
of, or the leaft Room to hope for, my own Deliverance, 
any more than 1 had twenty Years before; much lefs had 
1 any Foreknowledge of what after happened, I mean of 
an Eng/iß Ship Coming on Shore there to fetch them off, 
and it could not but l>e a very great Surprife to them, 
when they came back, not only to find that 1 was gone, 
but to find three Strangers left on the Spot, pofleffed of 
all thatl had kft behind me, which would otherwife 
luve been their own.

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 37 

The firft thing, however, which I inquired into, 
Chat I might begin where I left off, was of their own 
Part ; and I deiircd hc would gjve me a particular Ac- 
count of his Voyage back to his Countrymen wich the 
-Boat, when I fent him to fetch them over. He told 
me there was little Variety in that Part ; for nothing 
remarkable happened to them on {he Way, they having 
very calm -Weather, and a fmooth Sea ; for his Coun- 
trymen, it could not be doubted, he faid, bat that they 
were overjoyed to fee him : (It feems he was the prin- 
cipal Man among them, the »Captain of the Ve/Tel they 
had been fhipwreck'd in, having been dead fome Time : ) 
They were, he faid, the more furprifedlo fee him, be- 
caufe they knew that he was fallen into the Hands of 
Savages, who, they were fatisfy'd, would devour him, 
as they did all the reft of their Prifoners ; that when he 
toid them the Story of his Deliverance, and in what 
Manner he was furniuVd for carrying them away, it was 
like a Dream to them ; and their Aftoniftimcnt, they faid, 
was fomething like that of Jofepb's Brethren, when he 
told them who he was, and told them the Story of his 
Exaltation in Fharaoh\ Court : But when he fliewed them 
the Arms, the Powder, the Ball, and the Provifions that 
he brought them for their Journey or Voyage, they were 
rcitored to themfelves, took a juft Share of the Joy of 
their Deliverance, and immediately prepared to come 
away with him. 

Their firft Bufinefs was to get Canoes ; and in this 
they were obliged not to ftick fo much upon the honeft 
Part of it, but to treipafs upon their friendly Savages, 
and to borrow two large Canoes or Periagua's, on Fre- 
tence of going out a Filhing, or for Pleafure. 

In theie they came away the next Morning ; it feems 
they wanted no Time to get themfelves ready, for they 
had no Baggage, neither Cloaths, or Provifions, or any 
thing in the World, bat what they had on them, and a 
few Roots to eat, of which they us'd to make their Bread. 

They were in all three Weeks abfent, and in that 
Time, unluckily for them, I had the Occaüon offered 
for my Efcape, as I mentioned in my other Part, and 
to get off from the Ifland ; leaving three of the moft.

38 The Life and Adventures cf 
behind mc, that any Man could defire to meet wich, to 
the poor Spamards great Grief and Difappointment, you 
may be füre. 

The only juft*thing the Rogues did, was, that when 
the Spauiards came to Shore, they gave my Letter to them, 
and gavs them Provifions, and orher Relief, as I had 
orderet! rhera to do ; alfo they gave them the iong Paper 
of Dir^dtions, which I had left with ihem, containing ihe 
parücular Methods which 1 Cook for managing every Part 
of my Life therc, the Way how I baked my ßread, bred 
np my tarne Gcats, and planted my Com, how I cured 
my Grapes, made my Pots, and, in a Word, every thing 
J did; all tiii* being written down, they gave to the 
Spaniards, two of whom underilood Evghß well enough ; 
nor did they refufe to aecommodate the Spauiards with 
any thing elfe, for they agreed vtry well for fome Time ,* 
they gave them an equal Admiffion into the Houfe, or 
Cave, and they began to live very fociably; and the 
Head Spamorä* who had feen pretty much of my Me- 
thod, and Fridqy's Father togecher, managed all their 
AfTairs ; for, as for the Englißmtn, they did nothing but 
ramble about the Jfland, ftioot Farrots., ard catch Tor- 
toifes, and when they came home at Night, the Spamards 
provided their Suppers for them. 

The Spamards wculd have been faiisfied with this, 
would the oiher but have let them alone, which, how- 
ever, they couid not find in their Hearts to do long; 
Hbct, hke the Drg in the Manger, they would not eat 
themfelves, and would not lec others eat neither : The 
«DifErrences, neverthelefs, w.eie at firft .but trivial, and 
-fuch as are not worth rclating; but at lad it broke out 
into open War, and it began with all the Rudenefs and 
Infolence that can be imagined, without Reafon, with- 
out Provocation, contrary to Nature, and indeed, to com- 
mon Senfe ; and tho' it is true, the firil Relation of it 
came from the Spaniards themfelves,. whom I may call 
the Accufers, y er when I came to examine the Fellows, 
they could not deny a Word of it. 

But before I come to the Particulars of this Part, l 
muß fupply a Defeft in my former Relation; and this 
was, that I forgot to fet down among the reft, that, 
juii as we werc weighing the Anchor to fet fail, there 

hap- 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 39 

happened a little Quarrel on board our Ship, which ] was 
afraid once would turn to a fecond Mutiny ; nor was it 
appeas'd, tili the Captain, roirfng up bis Courage, and 
takingus all to his AiMance, parted thcm by Force, 
and niaking two of the moft refra&ory Fellows Prifon- 
ers, he laid them in Irons ; and as they had been adkive 
in the former Diforders, and let fall ffcme ugly danger - 
ous Words the fecond Time, he threaten'd to carry 
them in Irons to England^ and have them hang'd there for 
'Mutiny, and running away with che Ship. 

This, it feefns, though the Captain did not intend to 
do it, frighted ibme other Men in the Ship ; and Tome 
of them had put it in the Heads of the reft, that the Cap- 
tain only gave.them good Words for the prefent, tili they. 
ihould come to fonie Evgliß Port ; and that then they 
fliould be all put into a Goal, and try'd for their Lives. 

The Mate got intelligence of this, and acquainted os 
with it; upon which it was defir'd, that 1, who ßül 
pafled for a great Man among them, ihould go down 
with the Mate, and fatisfy the Men, and teil them, that 
they might be a flu red, if they behaved well the reft of 
the Voyage, all they had done for the Time palt, ihould 
be pardon'd. So I went, and after paßing my Honour* 
Word to them, they ap pear'd eafy, and the more fo, 
when I caus'd the two Men, who were in Irons, to be 
xcleas'd and forgiven. 

Bur/this Mutiny had brought us to an Anchor for that 
Night, the Wind alfo falling calm; next Worning ttc 
found, that our two Men who had been laid in Irons, 
had Hole each of them a Mufquet, and fome other Wea- 
pons ; what Powder or Shot they had, we know not ; 
and had taken the Ship's Pinnace, which was not yec 
haled up, and run away with her to their Companions 
in Roguery, on Shore. 

As foon as we found this, I ordered the Longboat on 
Shore, with twelve Men and the Mate, and away they 
went to feek the Rogues ; but they could neither find 
them, nor any of the red; for they all fled into the Woods, 
when they faw the Boat Coming on Shore. *Fhe Mate 
was once refolv'd, in Juftice to their Roguery, to have 
deftroy'd their Plantations, burnt all their Houfliold-ftufF 
and Furnicure, and left them to fhift m&wx Hx. \ \ä*-

having no Order he let all alone, lefc every thing as 
they round it, and, bringing the Pinnace away, came on 
board withouc them. 

Thefe two Men xnade their Number fat* bat the 
otber three Villaini were fo much wickeder th an thefe, 
that after they had been two or three Days together, 
they turn'd their two New-comers out of Doors to fhift 
for themfelves, and would have nothing to do with 
them, nor could they, for a good while, be perfuaded to 
give them any Food ; as for the Spaniards, they were not 
yet come. 

When the Spaniards came firft on Shore, the Bnfinefs 
began to go forward ; the Spaniardt would have per* 
fuaded the three Engliß Bruces to have taken in their 
two Countrymen again, that, as they faid, they migbt 
be all one Family ; but they would not hear of it : So 
the two poor Fellows liv'd by themfelves, and finding 
nothing but Indußry and Application wonld make them 
live comfortably, they pitch'd their Tents on the North 
Shore of the 1(1 and, but a little more to the Wert, to be 
out of the Danger of the Savages, who always landed o» 
the Eaft Parts of the Ifland. 

Here they built two Huts, cne to lodge in, and tKe 
other to lay up their Magazincs and Stores in ; and the 
Spaniards having give;; them fome Com for Seed, arrd 
efpecially fome of the Peas which I had left them, they 
dug and planred, and inclos'd, after the Pattern I had 
fct for them all, and began to live pretty well ; their firft 
Crop of Com was on the Gronnd, and though it was 
but a little Bit of Land which they had dug up at firft, 
having had but a little Time, yet it was enough to re- 
ite ve them, and find them with Bread, and other Eatables ; 
and one of the Fellows, being the Cook*« Mate of the 
Ship, was very ready at making Soup, Puddings, and 
fuch other Preparations, as the Rice, and the Milk, and 
fuch little Fleih as they got, furnifhed him to do. 

They were going on in a little thriving Pofture, when 
the three unnatural Rogues, their own Countrymen too, 
in mere Humour, and to infnlt them, came and bully'd 
them, and told them the Ifland was theirs ; that the Go- 
vernor, meaning me, had given them PoiTefiion of it, 
and nobody elfe had any Right to it ; and, damn them»

tbey (hould build no Houfes upon their Ground, unlefs 
they would pay them Rent for them. 

The two Men thought they had jefted at firft; and 
afiVd them to come and fit down, and fee what fine Houfes 
they were that they had built, and teil them what Rent 
they demanded : And one of them merrily to!d them, if 
they were Ground-landlords, he hop'd, if they built Te- 
nements upon the Land, and made Improvements, they 
would, aeeofding to the Cuftom of all Landlords, grant 
them along Leafe, and bid them go fetch a Scrivener to 
drawtheWritings. One of the three,damning and raging, 
told them, they ihould fee they were not in Jeft ; and go- 
ing to a little Place at a Diftance, where the ho rieft Men 
had made a Fire to drefs their Viftuals, he takes a Fire- 
brand, and claps it to the Outfide of their Hut, and very 
fairly fet it on Fire ; and it would have been all burnt 
down in a few Minutes, if one of the two had not run to 
the Fellow, thrufl him away, and trod the Fire out with 
his Feet, and that not without fome DifRculty too. 

The Fellow was in fuch a Rage at the honeft Man's 
thrufting him away, that he turn'd upon him with a Pole 
he had in his Hand ; and had not the Man avoided the 
Blow very nimbly, and run into the Hut, he had ended 
his Days at once. His Comrade, feeing the Danger they 
were both in, ran in after him, and immediately they 
cameboth out with their *Mufquets ; and the Man that was 
firft ftruck at with the Pole, knock'd the Fellow down, 
who began the Quarrel, with the Stock of the Mufquet, 
and that before the other two could come to help him ; 
and then feeing the red come at them, they ftood toge- 
ther, and prefenting the other Ends of their Pieces to 
them, bade them Hand off. 

The other had Fire- Arms with them too ; but one of 
the two honeft Men, bolder tfian his Comrade, and made 
deff erate by his Danger, told them, if they offered to 
move Hand or Foot, they were all dead Men ; and boldly 
commanded them to lay down their Arms. They did 
not indeed lay down their Arms ; but, feeing him refo- 
lute, it.brought them to a Pailey, and they confented 
to take their wounded Man with them, and be gone ; 
and indeed, it feems the Fellow was wounded Am.

Wrong, fmce they had the Advaotaie, that they did not 
difarm them efFeäually, as they might have done, and 
have gone imraediately to the Spaniards, and given them 
an Account how the Rogues had treated them ; for the 
three Villains ftudy'd nothing but Revenge, and every 
•Day gave them Tome Intimation that they did fo. 

But not to croud this Part with an Account of the lef- 
fer Part of tlieir Rogueries, fuch as treading down their 
Com, (hooting three young Kids, and a She-Goat, which 
the poor Men had got to breed up tarne for their Store ; 
and, in a word, plaguing them Night and Day in this 
Manner ; it forced the two Men to fuch a Dcfperation, 
that they refolved to fight thera all three the firft Time 
they had a fair Opportunity. In order to this they re- * 
folved to go to the Caftle, as they callM it, that was my 
o'd Dwelling, where the. tbrec Rcgues and the Spatjards 
all liv'd together, at that Time, intending to have a fair 
Battle, and the Spaniards (hould ftand by to fee fair Play. 
So they got up in the Morningbefore Day, and came to 
the Place, and called the Engtijbmcn by their Names, All- 
ing a Spantard that anfwer'd, that they wantod to Tpeak 
with them. 

It happeri'd that the Day before, two of the Spaniardf, 
having besn in fhe Woods, had Teen one of the tujp 
'Englißmeny whom, for Diftin&ion, I call thtHoneßWetii 
and he «had made a fad Complaint to the Spaniards, of 
the barbarous Ufage they had met with from their three 
Countrymen, and how they 'had ruined .their Plantation, 
and deftroyed their Com, that they had labour'd fo hard 
to bring fonvard, and killed the Milch-Goat, and their 
three Kids, which was all they had provided for their 
Suftenance ; and that if he and his Friends, meaning 
-the Spaniards, did not affift them again, they fhould be 
ftarv'd. When the Spaniards came home at Night, and 
they were all at Supper, he took the Freedom to reprove 
the three Englißmen, though in gentle and mannerly 
Terms, and afk'd them, how they could be fo cruel, 
they beiog harmlefs inoftenfive Fellows, and that they 
were putting them fei ves in a Way to fubfift by their La- 
tour, and that it had coft them a great dcal of Pains to 
bring things to fuch a Perfe&ion as they. had. 

One 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 43 

One of the EngUßmen retnrn'd vcry brifkly, What had 
they to do thcrc? That they came on Shore wkhout Leave, 
and that they fhonld not plant er build upon the Ifland ; 
it was none of their Grolrod. Why, fays the Spaniard f 
very calmly, Seignior Inglefe, they mußnotßarwe. The Eng- 
Jißman replied, like a true rough-hewn Tarpaulin, they 
might ftarve and be damn'd, they fhould not plant, nor 
build in that Place. But nvhat muß they do then, Seignior f 
fays the Spamard. Another of the Brutes return'd, Do ! 
D— n them, they (hould be Servants, and work for them. 
But hotv can you expeil that of them f They are not bought 
witbyour Moneyi you have no Right to make thtm Servants. 
The Englißmen anfwer'd, The Ifland was theirs, the Go- 
vernor had given it tö them, and no Man had any thing 
to do there but themfelves ; and with that fwore by his 
Maker, that they would go and burn all their new Huts ; 
they (hould build none upon their Land. 

Why, Seignior, fays the Spaniard, hy the /ante Rule, *wi 
muß beyour Servants too. Ay, fays the bold Dog, and fo 
you ihall too, before we have done with you 1 , mixing two 
or three G — d d — mme's in the proper Intervals of his 
Speech. The Spaniard only frnil'd ät that, and made htm 
.no Anfwer. However, this little Difcourfe had heated 
them ; and ftarting up, one fays to the other, 1 think it 
was he they call'd Will. Atkins, Com«, Jack, let im go 
and have *'other Brum with them ; we'il demolifh their 
Caflle, 1*11 Warrant you ; they ihall plant no Colony in 
cur Dominions. 

Upon this, they were all trooping away, with every 
Man a Gun, a Piftol, and a Sword, and muttered fome 
icfolent thing s among themfelves, of what they would 
do to the Spamards too, when Opportunity offer'd ; but 
the Spaniards, it ieems, did not fo perfeclly underftand 
them, as to know all the Particulars ; only, that, in ge- 
neral, they threatened them hard for taking the two Eng* 
lißmens Part. 

Whither they went, or how they beftowM their Time, 
that Evening, the Spamards faid, they did not know ; 
but it feems they wandernd about the Country, Part'of 
the Night ; and then lying down in the Place which I 
ufed to call my Bower, they were weary, and overfleot 
themfelves. The Cafe was this: TVä \ä^ \*tow^ *&

were aflcep ; and tfaey acknowledg'd ic afterwards, in« 
tending to fet Fire to their Huts while they were in thenr, 
and either burn thcm in them, or mardcr them as they 
came out : And as Malice feldom {Jeeps very found, it 
was very dränge they would not bave been kept waking. 

However, as the two Men had alfo a Defign upoo . 
them, as I have faid, tho'a much fairer one chan thatof 
burning and murdering, it bappened, and very locktly 
for them all, that they were np and gone abroad, before 
the bloody-minded Rogues came to their Huts. 

When they came thither, and found the Men gone, 
Atkins > who it feems.. was the forwardeft Mau, callcd out 
to his Comrades, Ha! Jack y here's tbe Neft; but, d — n 
them, the Birds are flown : They mufed a while to think 
what fhould be the Occaiion of their being gone abroad 
fo foon, and fuggefled prefently, that the Spaniards had 

fiven them Notice of it; and with that they fhook 
lands, and fwore to one another, that they would be 
revenged of the Spawiards. As foon as they had made 
this bloody Bargain, they feil to work with the poor 
Mcn's Habitation ; they did not fet Fire indeed to any 
thing, but they pulled down both their Hoüfes, and pull- 
cd them fo Limb from Limb, that they left not the leaft 
Stick üanding, or fearce any Sign on the Ground where 
they ftood ; they tore all their little collefted Houfhold- 
HurF in Pieces, and threw every thing about in fuch a 
Manner, that the poor Men found, afterwards, fome of 
their things a Mile off from their Habitation. 

When they had done this, they pulled up all the young 
Trees which the poor Men had planted ; pulled up the 
Inclofure they had made to fecure their Cattle and their 
Com ; and, in a word, facked and plunder'd every thing» 
as completely as a Herd of Tartan would have done. 

The two Men were at this Jundlure gone to find them 
out, and had refoived to fight them where -ever they had 
been, tho' they were but two to three: So that, had thvy 
met, there certainly would have been Bloodlhed among 
them ; for they were all very ftout, refolute Fellows, t« 
give them their Due. 

Bot Providence took more Care to keep them afun- 
der 9 than they themrelves could do to meet ; for, a» 

thef 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 45 
they had dogged one another, when the three were gone 
thither, the two were here ; and afterwards, when che 
two went back to find them, the three were come to the 
old Habttation again ; we (hall fee their differing Con- • 
du£t prefently. When the three came back, like furious 
Creatures, flufhed with the Rage which the Work they 
had been aboot put them into, they came np to the 
Spamards, and told them what they had done, by way 
©f ScofF and Bravado ; and one of them ftepping up to 
one of the Spaniards, as if they had been a Couple of 
Boys at Play, takes Hold of his Hat, as it was upon his 
Head, and giving it a Twirl about, fleering in his Face, 
fays he to him, Andyou, Seignior Jack Spaniard, ßall 
ba<ve the /ante Sauce, if you do not mend your Mannen. 
The Spamard, who, though quite a civil Man, was as 
brave as a Man could be defired to be, and withal a 
ßrong well- made Man, looked fteadily at him, for a 
good while ; and then, having no Weapon in his Hand, 
Sept gravely up to him, and, with one Blow of his Fift, 
knocke d him down, as an Ox is fclled with a Pole-ax ; 
at which cne of the Rogues, infolent as the firft, fired 
his Piftol at the Spaniard lnimtd'iztely ; he miffed his Bo- 
dy indeed, for the Bullets v. cnt through his Hair, but 
one of them touch'd the Tip of his Ear, and he bled 
pretty much. The ßJood made the Spaniard believe, he 
was more hurt than he really was, and that put him in- 
to fome Heat, for before he a&ed all in a perfett Calm ; 
bat, now refolving to go through with his Work, he 
ßooped, and took the Fellow's Mufquet whom he had 
knock'd down, and was juft going to fhoot the Man 
who had fiVd at him ; when the reft of the "Spaniards, 
being in the Cave, came out, and calling to him nct to 
fhoot, they ftept in, feear'd the other two, and took their 
Arms from them. 

When they were thus difermed, and found they had 
made all the Spaniards thiir Enemies, as well as their 
own Countryrnen, they began to cool ; and, giving the 
Spaniards better Words, would have had their Arms 
again ; bat the Spaniards, confidering the Feud that was 
between them and the other two Englijhmen, and that 
it would be the beft Method they could take to kee^ 
them from one another, teJd them they wou\d <io \Xvotw

no Harm ; and if thcy would live peaceably they would 
be very willing to afHft and aflociate with the», as they 
did betöre ; bat that they could not think of giving them 
their Arms again, while they appeared fo refolved to 6ö 
Mifchief wich them to their own Countryraen, and had 
even threatned them all to make them their Servants. 

The Rogues were now more capable to hear Reaftm, 
than to ad Reafon ; bat, being refufed their Arm9, they 
went ravrng away, and raging like M ad men, threaten- 
fag what they would do, though they had no Fire arms: 
But the Spaniards, defpifing their Threatening, told them 
they fhould take care how they oiFer'd any Injury to their 
Plantation or Cattie ; for, if they did, they would (hoot 
them, as they would do ravenous Bcafts, wbere evcr 
they found them ; and, if they feil into their Hand» 
alivc, they would certainly be hang'd. However, this 
was rar from cooling them; but away they went, fwear- 
ing and raging like Furies of Hell. As foon as they 
were gone, came back the two Men in Paffion and Rage 
enough alfo, though of another kind ; for, having been 
at their Plantation, and finding it all demolifh'd and de- 
ftroyed, as above, it will eafiiy be fuppofed they had 
Provocation enough ; they could fcarce have Room to 
teil their Tale, the Spaniards were {o eager to teil them 
theirs; and it was ßrange enough to find, that three Men 
fhould thus bully nineteen, and receive no Punifhment 
at all. 

The Spaniards indeed defpifed them, and efpecially 
having thus difarmed them, made light of their Threat- 
enings ; but the two Englißmen refolved to have their 
Remedy again II them, what Pains foever it cofl to find 
them out. , 

But the Spaniards interpofed here too, and told them, 
that they were already difarmed ; they could not confent, 
that they (the two) fhould purfue them with Fire-arms, 
and perhaps kill them : But, faid the grave Spamard, 
who was their Governor, we will endeavour to make 
them do you Juftice, if you will leave it to us ; for, as 
there is no Doubt but they will come to us again when 
their Paffion is over, being not able to fubfift without 
our Affiftance, we promife you to make no Peace with 
them, without having a füll Satisfadüon for you ; and 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 47 
trpon this Condition we- hope you will promifc to ufe na 
Vioknce with them, other than in your Defencc. 

The two Etiglijbmn. yiefcfed to this very aukwardly, 
and with great Rera&ance ; Hut the Spamards protefted, 
chey did it önjy ta keep them from Bloodihea, and to 
make all eafy at Plaft ; for, faid they, we are not fo 
inany of us ; herc is Room enoogh for us all, and it is 
great Pity we fhouhf not be all gbod Friends. At length 
they did consent, and waited for the Iflue of the thrng, 
living fbr fohie D.iys with the Spamards ; for their own 
Habitarion was- dcftroy'd. 

In about live Days Time the three Vajrrants, ttred 
with Wandering, and almoft ftarv'd with Hunger, hav- 
ing chiefly lived on Turdes Eggs all that while, came 
back to rhe Gröve ;' and finding my SpanUrd, who, at 
I bann faid, was the Governor, and two more with him, 
Walking by the Side -of the Creek ; they came up in a 
very fubmitfive humble Manner, and begged to be re- 
ceived again into the Family. The Spamards nfed them 
civilly, out told them, they had adled fo unnaturally by 
their Countrymen, and fo very grofsly by them (the 
Spamards) that they could not come to aisy Conclu- 
lion without confulting the two Englifomen, and the 
reft ; bat, however, . they would go to them, and dif- 
courfe about it, and they (hould know in half an Hour. 
It may be guefs'd, that they were very hard pat to it ; 
for it feems, as they were to wait this Half- hour for an 
Anfwer, they begged he would fend them out fome Bread 
in the meanTime;. which he did, and fent them at the 
fameTime a largePieceof Goat'sFlefh, and a broil'd 
Parrot ; which they eat very heartily, for they were 
hungry enough. 

After half an Hour's Confaltation they were called in, 
and a long Debate had about them, their two Country- 
men charging them with the Ruin of all their Labour, 
and a Defign to murder them { all which they own'd 
before, and therefore could not deny now ; upon the 
Whole, the Spamards a&ed the Moderators between 
them ; and as they had obliged the two Englifimen not 
to hurt the three, while they were naked and unarmed, 
fo they now obliged the three to go and rebuild their 
Fcllows two Huts, one to be of the fomt Iftm^WA*

and the other larger than they were bcfore ; alfö to fcnce 
thcir G round again, where they had pulied up the Fences, 
plant Trees in the room of thofe pulied up, dig opthc 
Land again for planting Com, where they had fpoiled it; 
and, in a Word, to reftore every thing in the fame State» 
as they found it, as near as they could ; for intirely it could 
not be, the Seafon for the Com, and the Growth of the 
Trees and Hedges, not being poflible to be recover'd. 

Well, they all fubmitted to this ; and as they had 
Plenty of Provifions given them all the while, they 
grew very orderly, and the whole Society began to live 
pleafantly and agreeably together again ; only that thefe 
three Fellows could never be perfuaded to work ; I 
mean, not for themfelves» except now-and then a little, 
juft as they pleafed ; howcver, theSpattiards told them 
plainly, that if they woold butlive fociably and frierrdly 
together, and ftudy in the Whole the Good of the Plan» 
tation, they would be content to work for them, and let 
them walk about and be as idle as they pleafed ; and thus 
having liv'd pretty well together for a Month or two f 
the Spaniards gave them their Arms again, and gave 
them Liberty to go abroad with them as before. 

Jt was not above a Wcek after they had thefe Arms, 
and went abroad, but the ungrateful Creatures began 
to be as infolent and troutlefome as before ; but how- 
ever, an Accident happened prcfently upon this, which 
cndangered the Safety of them all ; they were obliged 
to lay by all private Refentments, and look to the Pre- 
fervation of their Lives. 

It happened one Night, that the Spaniard Governor, 
as I call him, that is to fay, the Spaniard whofe Life I 
had faved, who was now the Captain, or Lcadcr, or 
Governor of the reit, found himfelf very uneafy in the 
Night, and could by no Means get any Sleep: He was 
perfecily well in Body, as he told me the Story, only - 
found his Thoughts tumultuous ; his Mind ran upon 
Men fighting, and kiliing one another, but was broad 
awake, anü could not by any Means get any Sleep; in 
fhort, he lay a great while ; but, growing tnore and more 
uneafy, he refolved to rife: As they lay, being fo many 
of them, upon Goat-fkins, laid thick upon fuch Couches 
and Pads, as they made for themfelves, and not in Harn« 

mocks 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 49 
tnocks and Ship-beds, as I did, who was bjit one ; fo 
they had little to do, when they were willing to rife, but 
to get up upon their Feet, and perbaps put on a Coat, 
fuch as it was, and their Pumps, and they were ready for 
jgoing any Way that their Thoughts guided thera. 

Being thus gotcen up, he look'd out ; but, being darlc, 
he could fee little or nothing; and befides, thcTreeswhich 
I had pjanted, as in my forma Account is defcribed* and 
which were now grown'tall, intercepted Jus Sigbt, fo 
that he could only look up, and fec that it was a clear 
£>tar-light Night j and, hearing no Noife, he return'd and 
laid him down again -, but ■ it was all one, he could not 
fleep, nor could he coxnpofe himfelf to any thing Hke 
Reit, but his Thoughts were to the lafl Degree uneafy, 
and yet he knew not for what. 

Having made fome Noife with rifing and Walking 
about, going out and Coming in, another of them wak'd, 
and, calling, aflt'd, who itwas that was up? The Go- 
„ vernor told him, how it had been with him : Say you 
fo ? fays the other Spamard; fuch things* are not to be 
ilighted, I aiTure you ; there is certainly fome Mifchief 
working, fays he, near us ; and prefently he afk'd him» 
Where are the Englißmen ? They are all in their Huts, 
Jays be, fafe enough. It feems, the Staniards had kept 
Poßeüion of the.main Apartment, and had made a Place, 
where the three Englißmen , fince their lad Mutiny, al- 
ways quartered by themfelves, and could, not come at the 
reit. Well, fays the Spaniard, there is fomething in it, l 
am perfuaded from roy own Experience ; I am fatisfied 
our Spirits entbodied have a Converfe with, and receive 
Jntelligence from, the Spirits unembodied, and inhabit- 
ing the invifible World ; and this fricndly Notice is gi- 
vcn for our Advantage, if we know how to make ufe of

if wc find nothing at all in it to juilify our Trouble, VW 
teil you a Story to the Purpofe, that ihall convince you 
of the Juftice of my propofing it. 

In a Word, they wem out to go to the Top of the 
Hill, where I ufed togo; but they, being ftrong, and in 
good Company, not aTone, as I was, ufed none of my

5Ö The Life and Adventures of 

were going round through the Grove unconcerned and 
unweary, whcn they were furprifed with feeing a Light, 
as of Fire, a very iittlc Way oiF froiq. them, and hear- 
ing the Vo-ces of Men, not of one, or two, but of a 
great Nümber. 

In all the Difcoveries I had made of theSavages land- 
irg on the Ifland, it was my conflant Care to prevent 
them making the leaft Difcovery of there being any In- 
habitant upoii the Place ; and when by any NecefTity 
they came to knovv it, they feie it fo efFe&ually, that 
they that got away, werc fearoe able to give any Ac- 
count of it, for we difappeared as foon as pofiibUi, nor 
did ever any that had feen ine, efeape to teil any one 
clfe, except it were the three Sa vages in our 1k;l En- 
. counter, who jumped into" the Beat, of whom J ir.en- 
tioned, that I was äfiaid they ihould go Home, and 
bring more Help. 

Whcther it was the Confequence of the Efeape of 
thofe Men, that {o great ä Number canie now toge- 
ther ; or whether they came ignorantly, . and by Acci- 
dent, on their ufual bloody Errand j the Spamards could 
not it feems underßand : But whaiever it was, it had 
been their EuHnefs, eiiher to have conceaPd themfelves, 
and not have feen them at all ; much lefs to have Jet the 
Savages have feen, that there were any Iuhabitants in the 
Place; but to have fallen upon them fo effeclually, as 
that not a Man of them fhould have efeaped, which 
could only have been by getting in between them and 
their Boats ; but this Prefence of Mind was wantirig to 
them, which was the Ruin of their Tranquilfity for a 
great while. 

We need not doubt, but that the Governor, and the 
Man with him, furprifed W'th this Sight, ran back im- 
mediately, and raifed their Fellows, giving them an Ac- 
connt of the imminent Danger they were all in ; and they 
again as readily took the Alarm, but it was impoflibie to 
perfuade them to ftay clofe within where they were, but 
that they mutl run all out to fee how.things flood. 

While it was daik indeed, they were well enough, 
and they had Opportunity enough for fome Hours, to 
view thein by the Light of three Fires, they had made 
at fome Diftance from one anotl^r; what they were 

doing, 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 57 

cfoing, they knew not, and what to do themfelves, they 
knew not ; for, firft, the Eneiuy were too many ; and, 
fecondly, they did not ketp togcthcr, but were divided 
into ieveral Parties, and were on Shore in feveral Places. 

The Spaniards were in no fmall Conlternation at this 
Sight ; and as they found, ihac the Fellows ran ftrag- 
glirig aJl over the Shorc, they made no Doubr, but, firft 
or laft, fome of them would c ; .op in lipon «heir Habita- 
tion, or upon fome other Place, whcre they would fee 
the Tokens of Jnhabitants; and they were in great Per- 
plexiry alfo for fear oftheir Flock of Goats, -which would 
have been little lefs than ftarving them, if they (hould 
have been deftroy'd; fo the firlt thing they refolv'd upon, 
was to difpatch three Men away, before it was light, <z//'z. 
two Spaniards and one Engüßman, to drive all the Goats 
away to the great Valley where the Cave was, and, if 
Need were, to drive them into the very Cave itfelf. 

Could they have feen the Savages altogether in one 
Body, and at any Diftance from their Canoes, they re- 
folved, if there had been an Hundred of them, to have- 
attacked them ; but that could not be obtained, for, 
they were fome of them two Miles off from the other, 
and, as it appeared afterwards, were of two different 
Nations. 

After having mufed a great while on the Courfe 
. they ihould take, and beaten their Brains in con fidering ' 
their prefent Circumftances ; they refolv'd at laft, while 
it was dark, to fenJ the old Savage (Frida/s Fäther)' 
' out, as a Spy, to learn, if poflible, fomething concern- 
ing them, as what they came for, and what they in- 
tenJed to do, and the like\ the old Man readily under-. 
took it, and, ftripping himfelf quite naked, as moft of 
the Savages were, away he went : After he had been 
gone an llour or two, he brings Word, that he had been 
among them undifcover'd, that he found they were 
two Parties, and of two feveral Nation», who had War 
with one another, and had had a great Battle in their 
ewn Country, and that both Sides having had feveral 
Prifoners taken in the Fight, they were by merc 
Chance landed in the fame Ifland, for the devouring 
their Prifoners, and making merry ; but xYievt c&tryc^y&

that they were in a great Rage ät one änother, and were 
fo ncar, that he believ'd they would tight again, as fooa 
as Day-light began to appear; but he did not perceive, 
that they had any Notion of any body's being on the 
Jfland but thcmfelves. He had hardly made an End of 
telling the Story, when they could perceive, by the un- 
ufual Noife they made, that the two lictle Armies were 
tngag'd in a bloody Fight. 

Frida/ $ Father ufed all the Arguments he could to 
perfuade our Peop^ to He clofe, and not be feen ; he 
told them, their Safety confifted in it, and that they had 
nothing to do but to lie (tili, and the Sa vages would 
kill one another to their Hands, and the reft would go 
away ; and it was fo to a Tittle. But it was impoffible 
to prevail, efpecially upon the Englifomen ; their Curiofi- • 
ty was fo importunate upon their Prudentials, that they 
muft run out and fee the Battle : However, they ufed 
fome Caution, <viz. they did not go openly, juft by their 
own Dwelling, but went farther into the Woods* and 
placed themieives toAdvantage, where they might fe- 
curely fee them manage the Fight, and, as they thought» 
not to be feen by them; but, it fee ms, the Savages did 
fee them, as we (hall find hereafter. 

The Battle was very fierce, and, if I might believe 
the EngJißmen, one of them faid, he could perceive» 
that fome of them were Men of great Brav ery, of invin- 
cible Spirits, and of great Pol4cy in guiding the Fight. 
The Battle, they faid, held two Hours, before they 
could guefs which Party would be beaten ; but then 
that Party which was neareft our People's Habitation, 
began to appear weakeft; and after fome Time more, 
Jörne of them began to fly $ and this put our Men again 
into a great Confternation, left any of thofe that fled, 
fhould run into the Grove, before xheir Dwelling, for 
Shelter, and thereby involuntarüy difcover the Place.; 
and that by Confequence the Purfuers fhould do the 
like in Search for them. Upon this they refoly'd, that 
they would ftand armed within the Wall, and whoever 
came into the Grove, they (hould fally out over the 
Wall, and kill them; fothat, if poflible, not one fhould 
return to give an Account of it ; they order'd alfo, that 
it fhould be done with their Swords, or by knock ing

tfiem down with the Stock of the Mufquet, not by fhooting 
thera, for fear of raifing an Alarm by the Noife. 

As they expe&ed, it FelJ ont ; three of -the routed 
Army fled för Life, and, croifmg the Creek, ran direfl- 
ly into the Place, not in the leait knowing whither they 
went, bat running as into a thick Wood for S heiter ; the 
Scout they kept to look abroad, gave Notice of this 
within; wich this Addition, to our Mens great Satif- 
fa&ion, *viz. That the Conquerors had not purfued 
them, or feen which Way they were gone. Upon this, 
the Spamard Governor, a Man of Humanity, would not 
fuffer them to kill the three Fugitives ; but, fending thrte 
Men out by the Top of the Hill, order'd them to go 
round, and comeln behindthem, furprife and take them 
Piifoners," which was done ; the Refidue of the conquered 
People üed to* their Canoes, and got off to Sea ; the 
Viftors retired, and made no Purfuit, or very'little ; but, 
drawingthemfelvcs into a Body together, gave two great 
fcreaming Shouts, which they fuppos'd were by way of 
Triumph, and fo the Fight ended : And the fame Day 
about three o'Clock in the Afternoon, they alfo marched 
to their Canots. And thus the Spaniards had their liland 
again free to themfelves, their Fnght was over, and they 
faw no Savages in feveral Years after. - . 

After they were all gone, the Spaniards came out of 
their Den ; and, viewing the Field of ßattle they found 
abont two-and thirty dead Men upon the Spot ; fome 
were killed with great long Arrows, feveral of whicK 
were found fticking in their Bodies ; but moft of them 
were killed with their great wooden Swords, fixteen or 
feventeen of which they found in the Field of Battle, 
and as many Bows, with a great many Arrows : Thefe 
Swords were great unwieldly things, and they muß be 
\ery ftrong Men that ufed them : Moft of thofe Men that 
were killed with them, had their Heads mauYd to Pieces, 
as we may fay, or, as we call it in Englijb, their Brains 
knock'd out, and feveral of their Arms and Legs broken ; 
fo that it is evident they fight with inexpreffible Rage and 
Fury ; they found not one wounded Man that was not 
ftone dead ; for either they ftay by their Enemy tili they 
have quite killed them, or they carry all the wounded.

Thlb Dslivcr.ince tamed our 'Englijl-mcn for a great 
whüc : The Sight had fclled them with Horror, and the 
C onfcquences appear'd terrible to the lall Degree, efpccial- 
\y rpon fuppoiir.g rhatforneTime or otherthey (hould fall 
into the FJands of'thofe Creatures, who vvould not only k»H 
them as Enemics, but kill them for Food, as we kill 
our Cartle, And tlu»y profciled to nu 1 , that the Thooghts 
of being caten up hkcBccf or Mutton, ihough it wasfup- 
pofed it was not to be tili they were dead, had fomething 
in it fo horrible, that it naufeated their very Stomachs, 
made them fick when they thought of it, and fillcd their 
Minds with unufual Terror, that they were not themfelvcs 
for fome Wezks after. 

This, as I faid, tamed even the three Englifl? Brutes I 
have bsen fpeaking of ; and for a great while after, 
they were very tracUble, and went about the commoir 
Buiinefs of the whole Society well enough ; planted, 
fow*d, reap'd, and began to be all naturalized to the 
Country; but fomeT.me after this, they feil all into 
fach fimple Meafures again as brooght them into a great 
deal of Trouble. 

They had taken three Pri'bners, as I had obferved ; 
and thefe three being lufty ftout young Fellows, they 
in ade them Servant% and taught them to work for them \ 
and, as Slaves, they did weil enough ; but they did not 
take their Meafures with them, as I did by my Man Fri- 
dafr <vi%. to bfgin with them upon che Principle of havin» 
faved their Lives, and then iullruft them in the rational 
Principles of Life, much lefs of Religion, -civilizing and 
reducing them by kind Ufige, and affeclionate Arguings \ 
tut, as they gave them their Food every Day, fo they 
gave them their Work too, and kept them fuüy employ- 
in Drudgery eno.igh ; but, they fail'd in this by it, that 
they never had them to aflift them and fight for them,, 
as I had my Man FriJay, who was as true to me as the 
very Flelh upon my Boncs. 

* But to coine to the Family Part ; being al! now good 
Friends (for common Dangcr, as I faid alove, had ef- 
fc-aually reconcii'd them) they began to confider their 
general Circumilanccs ; and the firit thing that came 
under their Confidcraticn was, whether, feeing the 
Savages particularly haunted that Side of the liland, 

and 



ROBINSONCRUSOE, 55 

and that there were more remote and retired Parts of it 
equally adapted to their Way of Living, and manj- 
feltly to their Advantage, they (hould not rather remov c 
their Habitation, and plant in fome morc proper Piace 
for their Safety, and efpecially for the Security of their 
Cattle and Com ? 

Upon this, after long Debate, it was conceived, that 
they would not remove their Habitation; becaufe thatfome 
Time or other they thought they might hearfrom theirGo- 
▼ernor again, meaning rae ; and if I fhould fend ariy one 
to feek them, I would be füre to direft them on that Side, 
where, if they fhould find the Place demoiiuYd, they 
wbuld conclude the Savages had killed us all, and we were 
gone, and fo our Supply would go away too. 

But as to their Com and Cattle, they agreed to rq* 
siove them into the Valley where my Cave was, where 
the Land .was as proper to both, and where indeed there 
was Land enough : However, upon fecond Thoughtsi 
they altered one Part . of that Relblution toö, and re- 
folved only to remove Part of their Cattle thither,' and 
plant Part of their Com there f and fo, if one Part was- 
deftroyed, the other might be faved : And one Piece of 
Prudence they ufed, which it was very well they did ; 
v/%. That they never trufttti thef« tbree Savages, which 
they had taken Pri Toners, wiih knowing any thing of 
the Plaotation they had made in that Valley, or of any 
Cattle they had there ; mach ?efs of the Cave there, 
which- they kept in Cafe of Neceflity, as a fafe Retreat ; 
and thither they carried alfo the two Barrels of Powder* 
which I ■ had. fent them at my Coming away. 

But, however, they refolv'd not to change their Ha- 
bitation ; yet they agreed, that as I had carefully co- 
ver'd it firir. with a Wall or PVtification, and then with 
a Groveof Trces ; fo, fteing their Safety coufitted in- 
tirely in their being cor.cealed, of which they were now 
fully convinc'd ; they fet to work to cover and cuicealj 
the Place yet more effe&uaily than bdore : To chis l'ur- 
pofe, as 1 had planted Trees (or racher thruft in Stades,, 
which in Time all £«e\v to be Trees) for fome gooi 
Diftance before the Kr.trance into my Apartment, they 
went on in the fame Männer, and filled up the reft of 
that whole Space or Ground, from the Trees I had iet^ 

C 4. q£sL\\ä 



Sf> ^bi talYZ and AöVf !CT rrRfs of 

quire down to thc Side of thc Creek, where, as I faid, I 
Janded my Floats, and even into the very Ouze where 
the Tide flowed, not fo much as leaving any Place to 
land, or any Sign that there had been any Landing 
thereabout : Thefe Stakes alfo, being of a Wood very 
forward to grow, as I have noted formerly, they took 
Care to have generally very much larger and taller than 
thofe which I had plantcd, and plac'dthem fo very thick 
and clofe, tbat when they had been three or four Years 
grown, there was no piercing with the Eye any confider- 
able Way into the Plantation : As for that Part which I 
had planted, the Trees were grown as thick as a Man" 1 » 
Thigh; and amongthem they plac'd fo many other fhort 
ones, and fo thick, that, in a Word, it ftood like a Pali- 
fado' a Quarter of a Mile thick, and it was next to im- 
poffiMe to penetrate it, but with a little Army, to cut it 
all down ; for a little Dog could hardly get between the 
Trees, they ftood fo clofe. 

Bot this was not all -, for they did the fame by all 
the G round to the Right-hand, and to the Left, and 
round even to the Top of the Hill ; leaving no Way, 
not fo much as for themfelves to come out, but by the 
Ladder placed up to the Side of the Hill, and then 
Jifted up, and placed again from the firft Stage up to 
the Top ; which Ladder, when it was taken down, no- 
thrng but what had Wings or Witchcraft to affift it, could 
come at them. 

This was exceüently well contriv'd : Nor was it left 
than what they afterwards found Occafion for ; which 
ferved to convince me, that as human Prudence has Au- 
thority of Providence to juflify it, fo it has, doubtlefs, 
the Direction of Providence to fet it to work ; and, would 
we Kften earefully to the Voice of it, I am fully perfuaded 
we rnight prevent many of the Difafters which our Lives 
are now by our own Negligence fubjected to. But this by 
iWe Way. 

I return to th« Story : They Iived two Years after 
this in perfect Retirement, and had no more Vifits from 
the Savages ; they had indeed, an Alarm given them 
one Morning, which put them in a great Confterna- 
tion ; for, fome of the Sfaniards being out early one 
Morning on the Weft-fide, or rather End of the Ifland, 

■which, 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 57 

which, by the Way, was that End where I ncvcr went, fbr- 
fear of being difcover'd, they were farpris'd with feeingt 
above ewenty Canoes of Indiens, j uft Coming on Shore. 

They made the beft of their Way home, in Harrys 
enough ; and giving the Alarm to their Comrades, they 
kept clofe aJl that Day and the next, going out only at 
Night, to make Obfervation : But they had the good 
Luck to be mißaken ; for where- ever the Savages went» 
they did not land at that Time on the Wand, butpurfu'd 
ibme other Defign. 

And now they had another Broil with the three Eng»- 
lißmm\ oöe of which, a moft turbulent Fellow, beingm* 
a Rage at one of the three Slaves, which I mentioned 
they had taken, becaufe the Fellow had not done fome«~ 
thing right which he bid him do, and feemM a little.un- 
traftable in his fhewing him» drew a Hatchet out of a 
Frog-belt, in which he wore it by hisSide, and feil apon 
the poor Savage, not to correft him, buk to kill him« 
One of the Spaniards, who was by, feeing himgive the 
Fellow a barbarous Cut with . the; Hatohet, which he. 
aimed at his Head, bat flruck into his Shoulder, fo that 
he thought he had out the poor GreatureV Arm off, ran 
to him, and, intreating him not taraarder the poor Man,,

5S The Lr fb antt Ädvektüres of 
feeen fo often mutinous, and were fo furious, fo defperatei. 
and fo idlc withal, that they knew not what CouTfe ta 
take with them, for they were»mifchievous to the higheft 
Degree, and valucd not what Hurt they did any Manf 
üb that, in fhort, it was not fafe to live with them. 

The Spaniard who was Governor, told them in fo many 
Words, that if they had beenhis*ownCountrymen,hewou T d 
bave hang'd them all ; for all Laws, and all Governors, 
were to prcferve Society ; and thofe who were dangerous' 
to the Society, ought to be expelled out of it ; but, as 
they were Englißmen, and that it was to the generoui 
Kindnefs of an Englißman that they all owed their Pre- 
fervation and Deliverance, he would ufe them with all 
poflible Lenityy and would leave them to the Judgment 
of the other two Englißsmen, who were their Countrymen.. 

One of the two honeil Englißmen ftood up, and faid, 
They defired it might^ot be left to them : For, fays he, 
/ am füre tue ought to ßntence them to the Galloivs ; and' 
with that gives an Account, how Will. Atkins, one of the 
three, .had propofed to have all the five Englißmen join 
together, and murder all the Spaniards, when they were 
in their Sieep. 

When the Spanß Governor heärd this, he calls to Will. 
Atkins : Ho<W) Seignior Atkins, fays he, Will you murder ut 
all? What have you to fay to that? That hardened Villain 
was fo far from denying it, that he faid it was true, and 
G — d d — mn bim they would do it Hill before they had 
done with them. Well, but Seignior Jtkins, faid the Spa- 
mard, What have we done to you, that you will kill us r 
And what would you get by killing us ? And what mud 
we do to prevent your killing us ? Muft we kill you, or 
will you kill us ? Why will you put us to the Neceifity of 
this, Seignior Atkins ? Says the Spaniard ?ery calmly, and 
fmiling. 

Seignior Atkins was in fuch a Rage at the Spaniartfs 
making a Jeft of it, that, had he not been held by three 
Men, and withal had no Weapons with him, it was- 
thought he would have attempied to have killcd the Spa- 
niard in the Middle of all the Company. 

This hare- brain'd Cai riage obliged them to confider fe- 
rioufly what was to be done. The two Ev^lij.'.men and the 
Spaniard, who faved the poorSavage, were of the Opinion, 

Thßt

That they ßould bang cm of the three for an Exatnfk to the 
reß ; and that particularly it ßould be he ibat had ii-Ace at- 
temptedto commit Murderwitb bis Hatcbet-, and inueed there 
wa» fome Reafon to believe he had done it, for the poor 
Savagewas in fuch amiferableCondition with the Wound 
he had receiv'd; that it was th/'üght he coald not live.

fitould be, tbat they- JKOuldpardon bim. 

This was fo pofitivciy ii.fitted on by the Governorfy^ 
niard, that there was no gainfaying it ; and, as merciful' 
Councils are moft apt to prevail, where they are fo ear*- 
neilly prefs'd, fo they all came into it ; bin then it was 
to be conlider'd, what ihoulu be done to kecp them from 
the Mifchief they defign'd; for all agreed, Governor and 
all;. Tb-it Means ivere to be ufed for yrrferving the Society 
from Danger: After a long Debate it was agreed, Firfi,. 
Ibat they ßould be difarmed^ and not permitted to bave eitber 
Gun, or Pomder, or Sbot, or S<word> er any IVeapcn, and' 
fbould be turn'd out of the Society, and left ttHive <where they.

the reß, either Spaniards or Engliih, ß;ould cowerfe <with 
them % fpeak nuttb them, or hanje any tbivg to do nvitb them ;.. 
tbat they jlouM be forbid to come ivithin a certain Dißance

of the Corn, Plantings, Buildings, Fernes, or Cattle belong-

they Jhould jhoot them ivbere-ever they could find them. 

The Govemor, a Man of great Humanity, mufing 11p.

for prefent Subfißence, as for a Stört; and that they jboutt 
bave Tools given themfor tbeir Work in the Fields ; fuch ar 9 
fix Hatcbets, an Jx, a S#w, and the like : But they ftxmld 
ba<ue none oftbefe Tools or Provifions y unlefs tbey ivonJdfwear 
folemnly, That they would not hurt or injurc any of the 
Sfaniards with them, or of their Ft\\o\\-Englißmen. 

Thus they difmifs'd them the Society, and turn'd them. 
out to fhift for themfelves. They went away füllen and 
refra&ory, ■ as neither contented to go-away, or to flay; 
but, as there was no Remcdy, they went pretcndfng to go 
and chufe a Place where they ihould fettle themfelves, to 
plant, and live by themfelves ; and fome Provifions wem 
given them, but no Weapons. 

About four or five Days after, they came again Ar 
fome Vicluals, and gave the Governor an Account where 
they had pitch'd their Tents, and marked themfelves out 
an Habitation or Plantation ; it was a very convenient 
Place indeed, on the remoteft Part of the Ifland, N. £• 
rouch about the Place where I providentially landed i» 
my firft Voyage, v/hen I was driven out to Sea, the Lord 
alone knows whither, in my fooliih Attempt to fttrroand 
the Iiland. 

Here they bnilt themfelves two handfome Huts, and. 
contriv'd them in a Manner like my firft Habitation, being 
clofe under the Side of an Hill, having fome Trees grow- 
ing already to the three Sides of it, fo that by planting 
others, it would be very eaiily cover'd from the Sight, un- 
lefs narrowly fearch'd for v they defir'd fome dry Goat- 
ikins for Beds and covering, which were given them ; and, 
«pon their giving their Words, that they would not difturb 
the reft, or injure any of their Plantations, they gave them 
Hatchets, and what other Tools they could fpare •; fome 
Peafe, Barley, and Rice, for fowing, and, in a word, 
any thing they wanted, but Arms and Ammunition. 

They iiv'd in this fepaxate Condition about fix Months, 
and had gotten in their firft Harveft, tho' the Quantity 
was but fmall, the Parcel of Land they had planted be* 
ing but lictle ; for indeed, having all their Plantation to 
form, they had a great deal of Work upon their Hands; 
and when they came to make Boards* and Pots, and fuch 
things, they wert quite out of their Element, and. could 
make nothing of it * and when the xainy Seafon came

ob, for waiit of a Cave in the Barth, they could not kcep 
their Grain dry, and it was in great Danger of fpoiling : 
And this humoled them much; fo they came and begg'd 
thc Spaniaräs to help them, whieh they very readily did ; 
and in four Days work'da great Hole in the Side of the 
Hill for them, big enongh to fecure their Corn, and other 
things, from the Rain ; but it was but a poor Place at 
beft, compared to mine ; and efpecially as mine was 
then ; for thety*«W*had greatly enlarg'd it, and made 
feveral new Apartments in it. 

Aboot three Quarters of a Year after this Separation, 
a new Frolick took thefe Rogues, which, together vvitb 
the former Villainy they had committed, brought Mif- 
chief enongh opon them, and had vcry near been the 
Rain of the whole Colony : The three new Aflbciates be- 
gan, it feems, to be weary of the laborious Life they led, 
and that without Hope of bettering their Circuaiftances* 
and a Whim took them, that they would make a Voyage 
to the Continent, from whence the Savages came, and 
would try if they could not feize tapon fome Prifoners 
among the Natives there, and bring them home, fo as 
to make them do the laborious Part of their Work for 
them. 

The ProjeÄ was not fo prepofterous, if they had gone 
«o farther; but they did nothing, and propofed nothing, 
buthadeither Mifchiefin the Defign, or Mifchief in the 
Event: And, if I may give my Opinion, they feem'd to 
be ander a Blaft from Heaven ; for if we will not allow 
a viftbLe Curfe to pufue vifible Crimes, how (hall we re- 
concile the Events of things with divine Juftice ? It was 
certainly an apparent Vengeance on their Crime of Mu- 
tiny and Piracy, that brought them to the State they 
were in ; and, as they fhewed not the Ieaft Remorfe for 
the Crime, but added new Viilainies to it, fuch as, par- 
tkularly, that Piece of monftrous Cruelty of wounding 
a poor Slave, becaufe he did rot, or perhaps ooald not 
nnderftand to do what he was direäed ; and to wound 
•him in fuch a Manner, as, no queftion, made him a 
Cripple all his Life ; and in a Place where no Sergeon 
or Mediane could be had for his Cure ; and, what was 
füll worfe, the murderous Intent ; or, to do Jußice to 
thc Crime, the intenüonal Marder, f qi faOö, \ä VAw. 



62 The Life and Adtenturbs of 

it was, as was afterwards the fornTd Defign they all 

laid, to murder the Spaniards in cold ßlood, and in thcir 

Sieep. 

But I leave obfcrving, and retarn to the Story : The 
three Fellows came down to the Spaniards one Morning, 
and, in very humble Terms, defired' to be admitted to 
fpeak with them ; The Spaniards very readily heard what 
they had to fay, which was this ; That they were trred 
of living in the Manner they did ; That they were not 
handy enough to make the Necefläries they wanted; and 
that, having no Help, they found they fhould be ftarv'd: 
But if the Spaniards would give them Leave to take one 
of the Canoes which they came over in, and give them 
Arms and Ammunition, pmpoition'd for their Defence» 
they would goover to the Main, and feek their Fortune r 
and fo deliver them from the Trouble of fupplying them 
with any other Provifions. 

Tfce Spaniards were glad enough to l>e rid of them, bot 
yet very honeftly reprefented to them the certain De- 
finition they were running into; told them, they had 
fuffered fuch Hardfhips upon that very Spot, that they 
could, w.ithout any Spiiit of Prophecy, teil them, that 
they would be iiarv'd or murder'd ; and bad them confi- 
der of it. 

The Men replied audacioufly, they (hould be ftarv'd if 
they Aay'd here, for they coul- not work, and would 
not work ; anJ they couid but be ftaiv'd abroad ; and if 
they were murdered, th.re was an End of them, they had 
no Wires or Children to cry after them ; and, in ihort, 
infifted iinportunately upon their Demund, declaring that 
they would go, whether they would give them any Arm» 
Or no. 

The Spaniards told them, wi: s ^reat Kindntfs, That 
if they were refolvd to go, they ould not go Hke naked 
Men, and be in no Coir it.on to dtfend themfelves; and 
that, tho' they coald ill fpare their Fire arms, having 
not enough for themklvcs, yet they would letthem have 
two Muiquets, a Piltol, and a Cutlace, and cach Man a 
Hatc-et, which hey thought was fuificient for them. 

In a word, they aeeepted the Offer ; and having bak'd 
them Bread enough to ierve them a Month, and given 
them as mucn jGoafs Fleihas they couid eatwhile it was 

fweet,

fiveet, and a great Bafket.full of dry'd Grapcs, a Pot füll 
of frefh Water, and a young Kid alive to kill, tliey bold- 
ly fet out in a Canoe for a voyage over the Sea, wherc it 
was at leaft forty Miles broad. 

The Boat was indeed a large one, and would have ve- 
jy well carried 1 5 or 20 Men ; and therefore was rather ' 
top big for them to manage ; but as they had a fair Breeze, 
and the Flood-tide with them, they did well enough : 
They had made a Mail of a long Pole, and a Sail of 
four large Goat-fkins dry'd, which they had few'd or 
laced together ; and away they went merrily enough } 
the Spatriards call'd after them, Bon Veajo; and no Man 
cver thought of feeing them any more. 

The Spaniards would often fay to one another, and 
the two honeft Englißmen who remain'd Ifchind, how 
quietly and comfortably they liv'd, now thofe three tur- 
bulent Fellows were gone ; as for their ever Coming again, 
that was the remoteft thing from their Thoughts that 
could be imagin'd ; when behold, after 22 Days Abfence, 
one of the Englißmen , being abroad upon his Planting- 
work, fees three dränge Men Coming towards him at a 
Diftance, two of them with Guns upon their Shoulders. 

Away runs the Eng/ißman, as ifhewas bewitch'd, and 
came frighted and amaz'd to the Governor f$paniard, ancj 
teils him they were all undone, for tlure were Strangers 
landed upon the Ifland, he could not teil who : The 
Spant ardy paufing a while, fays to him, Ho<w do jou mean 9 
jcu cannot teil ivho 2 They are Satages to be füre, No, no, 
Xays the Englißman, they are Men nvCloaths with Arms : 
Nay then, fays the Spaniard, why are you concernd? If 
they are not Sa*vages, they muß he Friends ; for there is no 
Chrißian Nation, upon Earth, but will do us Good rather thah 
Harm, 

While they were debating thus., came the three Eng- 
Ußmen* and, ftanding without the Wood, which was 
new planted, hallow'd to them ; they prcfently knew 
their Voices, and fo all the Wonder of that ku<d renfed. 
But now the Admiration was turn'd upon another Que- 
ftion, *viz. What could be the Matter, and what made 
them come back again. 

It was not long before they brought the Men in ; a n d 
»quiring where they had been, and whtt üv&y V\^\*ä^ 



6+ The Life and Adventures of 

doing ? Thcy gave them a füll Account of their Voyage, 
in a few Words ; *viz. That they reach'd the Land in two 
Days, or fometbing lefs ; but, finding the People alarm'd 
at their Coming, and preparing with Bows and Arrows to 
üght them, they dürft not go on Shore^ but fail'd on to 
the North ward 6 or 7 Hours, tili they cnme to a great 
Opening, by which they perceiv'd, that the Land they 
faw from our Ifland was not the Main, but an lfland; 
that entering that Opening of the Sea, they faw another 
" Ifland on tle Right-hand North, and feveral more Weß; 
and, being refölv'd to land fomewhere, they put over to 
one of the lflands which lay Weft, and went boldlyou 
Shore ; that they found the People were courteous and 
rriendly to them, and they gave them feveral Roots, and 
fbme dfy'd Fim, and appear'd very fociable -*, and the 
Women, as well as the Men, were very forward to fupply 
them with any thing they could get for them to eat, and 
brought it to them a great Way upon their Heads. 

They conti nued here föur Days, and inquir'd, as well ' 
as they could of them by Signs, what Nations. were tbis 
Way, and that Way ; and were told of feveral rlerce and 
terrible People, that liv'd almoft every Way ; who, as 
they made known by Signs to,them, ufed. to eat Men; 
but as for themfelves, they faid that they never eat Men 
or Women, except only fuch as tHey took in the Wars.; 
and then they ovvn'd, that they made a great Feaft, and 
eat their Prifoners. 

The Englijhmen inquir'd, when they had a Feaft of that 
kind ; and they told them, two Moons ago, pointing 
to the Moon, and then to two Fingers ; and that their 
great King had 200 Prifoners now, which he had taken 
* in his War ; and they were feeding them to make them 
fatfor the next Feaft. The Englißmen feem'd mighty 
defirous to fee thofe Prifoners ; but the others, miftaking 
them, thought they were defirous to have fome of 
them, to carry away for their own eating. So they 
beckoned to them, pointing to the fetting of the Sun, 
and then to the rifing ; which was to fignify, that the 
next Morning, at Sun rifing, they would bring fome 
for them ; and accordingly, the next Morning, they 
brought do-vn five Women, and eleven Men ; and gave 
them to the En±lijkmen> ta carry with them on their 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 65 

Voyage, juft as we would bring fo many Cows and Oxen 
down to a Sea port Town, to vi&ual a Ship. 

As bruciih and barbarous as thefe Fellows were at home, 
their Stomachsturn'd at this Sight, and they did not know 
what to do ; to refufe the Prifoners, would have been the 
higheft Affront to the Savage Gentry that offer'd them 5 
and what to clo with them they knew not;however, upon 
fome De bäte, they refolv'd to accept of them ; and, in Re- 
turn, they gave the Savages that brought them, one of 
their Hatchets, an o!d Key, a Knife, and fix or feven of 
their Bullets, which, thongh they did not ur:derftand, they 
feem'd txtremely pleafed with : And then,tying the poor 
Creatures Hands behind them, they (the People) dragg'd 
the Prifoners into the ßoat for our Men. 

The Evglißfmen were obliged to come away as foon as 
they had them, or elfe they that gave them this noble 
Prefent, would certainly have expected that they Jhould 
have gone to work with them, have killed two or three 
of them -the next Morning, and perhaps, have invited 
the Donors to Dinner. 

Bat, having taken their Leave with all the Rcfpecla 
and Thanks that could well pafs between People, where 
on either Side, they underftood not one Word they could 
fay, they put off with their Boat, and came back to- 
wards tfce fi:ft Ifland, where, when they arrived, they 
fet eight of their Prifoners at Liberty, there being too 
many of them for their Occafion. 

In their Voyage they endeavoured to have fome Com- 
munication with their Prifoners, but it was impoflible to 
inake them underftand any thing ; nothing they could 
fay to them, or give them, or do for them, but was look- 
ed upon as going about to murder them : They firö of 
all unbound them, but the poor Creatures fcreanTd at 
that, efpecially the Women, as if they had juft feit the 
Xnife at their Throats ; for they immediately concludtd 
they were unbound on purpofe to be killed. 

Jf they gave them any thing to eat, it was the fame 
thing ; then they concluded, it was for fear they ihouid 
fink in Flefh, and fo not be fat enough to kill : lf they 
lcok'd at cne öf them more particularly, the Party pre- 
fently concluded, it was to fee whcther he or fhe was fat-

When thethree W;mCerers had given this unaccount, 
ablc Hiftory or Journal of their Voyage, the Spaniard 
alk'd them, wherc their hew Family was ? And, being 
told that they had brought.them on Shore, and put them. 
into one of their Halb, and were come to beg-fome 
Vicluäls for them ; tliey (the Spaniards) andtheother two 
EjjgliJ/.men, that is to iay., the whole Colony, refolved ta 
go all down to the Place, and fee them, and did fo, and 
rriday\ Fächer with them. 

When they came into the Hut, there they fat all bound; 
for when they had brought them on Shore, they bound 
their Hands, that they might not take the Boat, and 
make their Efcape ; there, 1 fay, they fat, ä^l of them. 
Jtark- naked : Firft, there w^re three Men, lufty coraely 
Fello.-.s, well (hap'd, ftrait and fair Lirobs, about 30 to 
35 Years of Age, and five Women, whereof two might 
be from 30 1040, two more not above 24 or 25, and the 
fiftii, a tall comely Maiden, about i6 or 17 : The Wo- 
roen were well favour'd agreeable Perfons, both in Shape-

been perfeel whr.e, would have pafl'ed for handfome Wo«. 
men, even in London itfelf, havingvery pleafant agreeable-

ally when they came afterwards to be cloath'd, and dref- 
fed as they callM it, tho' that Drefs was very indifferent^ 
it muß be confefs'd ; of which hereafeer. 

The Sight, you m.iy be füre, was fomething uncouth. 
to our Spamards, who were (to give them a juft Cha-

date Temj ers, and rcrfec~l Good-humour that ever I met 
with ; and in particular, of the moft Modelty, as will 
prefently appear : I fay, the Sight was very uncouth, to 
fee two naked Men, and five naked Women, all toge- 
ther bound, and in the moft miferab!e Circumftances that 
human Nature could be fuppofed to be, viz. to be ex- 
pecting every Moment to be dragg'd out, and have their 
Brain* knockVi out, and then to be eaten up i;ke a Calf

The firrt Thing they did was to caufe the old hidian %

Frian/s Father, to go in, and fee firft if he knew any of 
them ; and ehen, if he underitood a.:y of their Speech : 
As foon as the old Man came in, he looked ferioufiy at 
them, but knew none of them ; ncLhcr could any of 
them underitana a Word >ie faid, or a Sign he could 
njake, except one of the Women. 

However, this wa« enough to infwer the End, which 
was to fatisfy tiicin, that tae Men into whofe Hands they 
were fallen were Chriflians; that they nbhorr'd eating of 
Men or Women, and that they might be füre they vvouli 
not be kil'ed : As foon as they were a/Tured pf this, they 
difcovtred fuch a Joy, an? by fuch auk.ward and feveral 
Ways, as is haru to defcribe ; for it feems they were of 
feveral Nations. 

1 he Woman, who was their Interpreter, was bid, in 
the next Place, to afk them ir rhe> w«-re willing to be

The Governor, who found, that the having Women 
among them would prefently be attended with fome In-

haps Bio od, afked the three Men, what they intended to. 
do with thefe Women, and how they intended to ufe 
them, wHether as Servants, or as Women ? One of the 
Englißmen anfwered very bold : y and rea<iily, that they 
would ufe them as both. To which the Governor faid, I 
am not going to reflrain you from it ; you are your own 
Mailers as to that : But this I think is but juft, for avoid-

one a Wife ; that w to fay, a temporary Wife ; and fo they 
fet up a new Form of living ; for the Sfaniards, and Fri- 
da/s Father, Jiv'd in my oJd Habitation, which they hau* 
enla-rg'd exceedingly within ; the three; Servants, which 
they had taken in the late Battle of the Savages, lived 
with them ; and thefe carried on the main Part of ths 
Colony, fupptying all the reft with Food, and aflifting. 
them in any thing as they could, or as they found Ne- 
cetfity reqaired. 

But the Wonder of this Story was, how five fuch re* 
fraclory ill-match'd Fellows (hould agree about thefe Wo- 
men, and that two of them fhould not pitch upon the. 
fame Woman, efpecially feeing two or tbreeof them were, 
without Comparifon*, more agreeable than thc others t 
But they took a good Way enough to prevent quärrelling. 
among them fei ves ; for they fet the five Women by them- 
felves in one of their Huta, and they wenr alL into the . 
other Hut, and drew Lots among them who ihould chufe 
firft. 

He that drew to chufe firft, went away by himfelf to» 
the Hut where the poor naked Creatores were, and fetch« 
ed out her he chofe j and it was worth obferving, that h* 
that chofe frrft, took her that was reckoned the homelieft r 
and the o'deft of the five, which roade Mirth enough 
among the reft ; and even the Spaniards laugh'd at it : 
But the Fellow confidered betttr than any of them, that 
it was Application and Bufinefs that they were to expeefc 
AMance in f as much as any thing eile j and lhe prove*d 
the beft Wife in the Parcel. 

When the poor Women faw them fei ves fet in a Row 
thus, and fetched out one by one, the Terrors of their 
Condition return'd upon them again, and they firmly be- 
lieved, that they were now going to be devoured : Ac- 
cordingly, when the EngHJb Sailor came in, and fetched 

out 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 69 

Oot onc öf them, the reft fet op a moft lamentable Cry, 
and hang about her, and took their Leave of her with fuch 
Agonie«, and fuch AfFeclion, as would have grieved the 
:hardeJi Heart in the World ; nor was it poflible for the 
Emglißmtn to fatisfy them, that they were not to be im- 
mediately murder'd, tili they fetched the old Man, Fridas % 
Packer, who mftantly let them know, tbat the five Men, 
who had fetched them out one by one, had chofen them 
Iot their Wives. 

When they had done this, and the Fright the Women 
were in was a little over, the Men went to work, and the 
Spaniards came and helped them % and, in a few Hours, 
they had built them every one a new Hut or Tent for 
their lodging apart ; for thofe they had already were 
croudedwith their Tools, Houßioid ftuffand Provifions : 
The thxee wicked ones had pitched fartheü off, and the 
two. honeil ones nearer, but both on the North- (höre of 
the Mand, fo that they continued feparate as before : 
And thus my Jfland was peopled in three Places, and, as 
Jjnight Tay, three Towns were begun to be planted. 

And here 'tk very well worth obferving, that as it often 
•happens in the World (what the wife Ends of God's Pro- 
vidences are in fuch a Difpofition of thin^s, I cannot 
fiy) the two honeil Fellows had the two worft Wives ; and 
the three Reprobates, that were fcarce worth hanging, - 
•that were fit for nothing, and neither feemed born to do 
tbemfelves Good, or any one elfe, had three clever, di- 
ligent, carefut, and ingenious Wives ; not that the two 
tieft were Hl Wives as to their Temper or Humour ; for 
aJI the five were moft willing, quiet, paflive, and fubjeft- 
cd Creatures, -rather like Slaves than Wives; but my 
Meaning is, they were not alike capable, ingenious, or 
induftriou« ; or alike cleanly and neat. 

Another Obfervation I muß make, to the Honour of 
a diligent Application on the one hand, and to the Dif- 
grace of a flothful, negligent, idle Temper on the other, 
that when I came to the Place, and view'd the feveral 
Improvements, Planting, and Management of the feve- 
ral little Colonies ; the two Men had fo far outgone the 
three, that there was no Comparifon : They had indeed 
both of them as ir.uch Ground laid out for Corneas they 
wanted; and the Reafon was, becaufe, accotd\ft^\»\scf

mnr-: Corn :hun they wanttd ; but thc DifFerence of thc 
Cultivaticn, of ihe Planung, of the Fence«, and indeed 

j6\cry thrg elfe, was eafy co be fecn at firft View. 

1 he rwo Men lud innumerable young Tre.es ■ planted 
about their Huts, ti.at when you came to the Place, no- 
thirjj was to be feen but a Word ; and though they had 
their PJantation iwice demolifhed, cnce by their own 
Countrymen, and once by the Enemy ; as fhäll be fhewn 
in its P!;icj ; yet they had r^ftored alt agairt, and every 
thingwas rlourifhing and tliriving about them ; they. had 
Grapes planted in Order, and managed like a Virieyard, 
though they had themftlvcs never feen any thing of that 
kind ; and by their good ordering their Vines, their 
Grapes were as good again as any of the others. They 
h.id^alfo found them fei ves a Retreat in the thickefl Part 

, of the Woods, where, though there was not a natural 
Cave, as I had found, yet they made one with inceflant 
Labour of their Hands, and where, when the Mifchicf 
wh-'ch followed happened, they fecured their Wives and 
Children, fo as they could never be found ; they having, 
by iticking innumerable Stakes and Poles of the Wood, 
which, as I faid, grew fo eafily, made a Grove impaf- 
fable, except in one Place, where. they clin.bed up to get 
over the outfide Part; and then went in by Ways of their 
own leaving. 

As tr» the three Reprobates, as I juftly call them, tho' 
they were much civiliz'd by their new Settlement, com- 
pared to what they were before, and were not fo quar- 
re! fome, having not the fame Opportunjty ; yet one of 
the certain Companions of -a profligate Mind never lefc 
them, and that was. their Idlenefs : It is true, they plant- 
ed Corn, and made Fences ; but Solomons Words were 
«ever better verified than in them : / went by the Fine- 

yard of thc Slothful, and it <was all (rjergrown <with Tborns ; 
for when the Spaniards came to view their Crop, they 
could not fee it in fome Places for Weeds ; the Hedge 
had feveral Gaps in it, where the wild Goats had gotten 
in, and eaten up the Corn ; perhaps, here-and there a 
dead Bufh was crammed in, to ftop them out for the pre- 
fent, but it was onlv fhutting the Stable-door after the 
Steed wa6 Holen : Whcreas, when they looked on the 



Robinson crusoe. 71 

€o!ony of theother two/therewas the very Face of Indu- 
ftty and Succefs upon all they did ; there was nota Weed 
to be feeh ih all their Cbrn, or a Gap in'any of their 
HedgeV: ÄKd "hey, on theother hand, verified Solomons 
Word* in änother Place: 7 bat the ddigent Hand makes rieb'. 
.For ei'cfy thing grew and thriv'd, and they had Plenty 
within and withotit; they had more tarne Cattle than 
die other, more Ucenfils and Neceflaries wiihin Doors, 
sind yet more Pkafure and Divcrfion too. 
v -ft : j s ^ rBc * the Wives of the thrce were very handy and 
clefarity wiihin Doors ; an-' 3 .; having learn'd the EngHjb. 
Waysofdrefling andcoöking from one of the ot\tr Engliß- 
fAefti -who, as I faid, was a Cook's Mate on board the 
ShTp, they dreifed the : r Hufbands Virtual s very nicely and 
we!I ; -whcreas the other could not be broüghi to under- 
ft-md it ; but then the Hu/band, who, as I faid, had 
been Cook's Mare, did it huiiielf ; bat, as for the Huf- 
bahds'of the tluee Wives, they loitered aboat, fetched 
Turtlcs Eggs, and caoghe Fifli and Birds : In a word, 
afny thing but Labou.*; a^d they fared aecoriingly. The 
Diligenf h- ed well and comforrably, and the Slothful 
lived hard and beggarly ; and fo I believe, generally 
fpeaking, it is all over the Word 

But novv 1 tome to a Scene, drJerent fromall that had 
happ?ned ueföre. cit.-er to t.ietn or to me j and the Ori- 
ginal of the Sto.y was this. 

Early dne MornSng tnere camc on Shore five or fix 
Canoes of Ivdians, or S; i^es, c-11 them which yoa 
pleafe; and there is no roem to Joubt, that they came 
tfpon the old.Errand of feeciing upon their Slaves : But 
that Part was now 1b familiär to the Spaniards, and' to 
öur Mentoo, that they did noteoncern chemfelves nboat 
it, as I did; but, having been made fenfible by their 
Experiences, that their only Bufinefs was-to lieconceal'd, 
and that, if they were not feen by any of the Savages, 
they wou4d go offagain quietly, when their Bufinefs was 
döne, having as yet not the leaft Notion of there being 
any Jnhabitants in the Ifland ; I fay, having been made 
fenfible of this, they had nothing to do but to give No- 
tifce to all the three Plantations to keep within Doors, 
and not to fliew themfelves ; only placing a Scout in a 



7a Tht Lif e and Adventures tf 

proper Place, to give Notice when the Boata went off* to 
Sea a^ain. 

This was without Doubt very right ; bat a Difafter 
fpoiled all thefe Meafures, and made it known among 
the Savages, thac there were Jnhabitants there ; wbich 
was, in the End, the Defolation of almoft the whofc 
Colony : After the Canoes with the Savages were gonc 
oft', the SfaniarJs peep'd abroad again, and fomeof them 
had the Curiofity to go to the Place where they had 
been, to fee what they had been doing : Here, to their 
greät Surprife, they found three Savages lert Uekiod, 
aed lying fall afleep upon the Ground ; it was tappoied, 
they had either been fo gorg'd with their inhuman Feaf, 
that, like Beails, they were afleep, and would not Äir. 
when the others went, or they were N wandercd iato 
the Woods, and did noc come back in Time to bc taken 
in. 

The Spaniards were greatly furprifed at this Sight, and 
perfeclly at a Lofs what to do : The Spamard Governor, 
as it happened, was with them, and his Advice was a/k- 
ed ; but he profeffed he knew not what to do ; as for 
Slaves, they had enough already ; and as to killine them* 
they were none of them inclin'd to that : The Sianiard 
Governor told me they could not think of fhed jmg in- 
nocent Blood ; for, as to thern, the poor Creatures had 
done no Wrong, invaded none of their Property j and 
they thought they had no juft Quarrel againft them» to 
take away their Lives. 

And here I muft, in Juftice to thefe Spaniards, obfenre, 
that let all the Accounts of Spanijh Cruelty in Mexico and 
Peru be what they will, I never met with feventeen Men, 
of any Nation whatfoever, in any foreign Country, who 
were fo utiiverfally modeft, temperate, virtuous, fo very 
good-humour'd, and focourteous, as thefe Spaniards ; and, 
as to Cruelty, they had nothing of it in their very Na- 
ture ; no lnhumanity, no Barbaritv, no outragepus Paf- 
f:ons, and yet all of them Mtn of great Courage and 
Spirit. 

Their Temper and Calmnefs had appeared, in their 
bearing the unfufferable Ufage of the three Englifime» ; 
and their Juftice and Humanity appeared now in the 
Cafe of the Savages, as above : After fome Confultation, 

they 



ROBINSON CRUSOE, 73 
tkty rcfolved apoo this, that they would lie Hill awhile 
longer, tili, if poflible, thefe three Men might be gone ; 
bat then theGovernof Spamard recollt&cd, that the three 
Savages had no Boat ; and that, if they wcre left to rove 
about the IJIand, they would certainly difcover, that there 
were Inhabitants in it; and fo they fliould be undone that 
Way. 

Upon this, they went back again, and there lay the 
Feltows faft aileep Hill : So they rcfolved to awakeit 
them, and take them Prifoners, and they did fo ; the 
poor Fellows were ftrangely frighted when they were 
teizM upon and bonnd, and afraid, like the Women, 
that they fhould be murder'd and eaten ; for, it feems, 
thofe People tliink all the World do as they do, eating 
Mcn's Flefh ; but they were foon raade eafy as to that» 
and away they carried them. 

Jt was very happy to them, that they did not carry them 
home to their Caftle ; I mean, to my Palace ander the 
Hill ; bat they carried them firll to the Bower, where was 
the Chief of their Country-work ; fuch as the keeping the 
Goats, the plantin? the Com, &c. and afterwards they car- 
ried them to the Habitation of the two Englißmten. 

Hcre they were fet to work, tho* it was not mach they 
had for them to do : And, whether it was by Negligence 
in gnardiag theat, or that they thought the Fe'lows could 
not mend themfelves, I know not, bat one of them ran 
away ; and, takiog into tke Woods, they could never 
hear #f hira more. 

They had good Reafon to believe he got home again 
foon alter» in fome other Boats or Camoes of S avages, 
who came on Shore three or foar Weeks afterwards, and 
who, carry ingon their Revels as ofual, went off again in 
two Days Time : TkisThoaght terrified them exceeding- 
ly ; for they coacluded, and that not without good Caafe 
indeed, that if this Feliow got fafe home among bis Com- 
rades> he woald certainly give them an Account that there 
were Pfeople in the Ifland, as alfo how weak and few they 
were; for this Savage, as I obferv'd before, had never 
been told, as it was very happy he had not, how many 
they were, or where they liv'd ; nor had he ever feen or 
heard the Fire of any of their Gans, mach lefs had they 
Jhcwn him any other of their retired Place*, fasik *% ^*

74 The LtFE WAoventures of 

Cave in the Valley, or the new Rctrcat, wkich the two 
Englijbmtii had made, and the Itfe. 

The firfl Teflimony they had, that this Pellow had 
given Intelligence of them, was, that about two Months 
afeer this, lix Games of Savagrs, with about feven or 
eight, or ten Men in a Cattoe, came rowing along the 
IMorth fidc of the Ifland, where they never ufed to 
come before, and landed about an Hour after Son-rife, 
at a convenient Place, about a Mile from the Habitation 
-of the two Evghfljmen^ where this efeaped Man had 
been kept : As the Spaniard Governor faid, Had they 
fceen all there, the Damage would not bare been (o 
mach, for not a Man of them would have efeaped : Bot 
the Cafe differed now very much ; for two Men to 
£fty were too much Odds: The two Men had the 
Happinefs to difcover them about a League off, fo that 
it was above an Hour before they landed ; and, as they 
landed about a Mile from their Huts, it was fome Time 
before they could come at them. Now having great 
Reafon to believe that they were betrayed, the firft üyng 
they did, was. to bind the Slaves which were Jeft, and 
«caufe two of tfte thrce Men, whom they brought with the 
Women, who, it Jeems, prov'd very faithful to them", to 
lead them with their two Wives, and whatever they could 
carry away with them, to their retir'd Place in the Woods, 
which I have fpoken of above, and there to bind the two 
Fcllows Hand and Foot tili they heard farther. 

In the next Place, feeing the Savages were all come 
on Shore, and % that they bent their Courfe directly that 
Way, they open'd the Fences, where their Milch-goats 
were kept, and drove them all out, leaving their Goats 
to flraggle into the Wood, whither they pleas'd, that the 
Savages xnight think they were all bred wild ; but the 
Rogue who came with them was too eunning for that, 
and gave them an Account of it all ; for they went di- 
rectly to the Place. 

When the two poor frighted Men had fecured their 
Wives and Goods, they fent the other Slave they had 
of the three, who came with the Women, and who 
was at their Place by Accidenr, away to the Spaniards, 
with all Speed, to give them the Alarm, and defire fpee'dy 
Jde\p ; and in the mean Time they took their Arms, 

and 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 75 
and what Ammufiition they had, and retreated towards 
the Place in the Wood, wherc their Wiv'es wcre fent, 
keejping at a Diftance ; yet fo that they might fee, if 
poffiblc, which Way the Savages took. 

They had not gonc far, but that, frotn a rifing 
G round, they coald fee the little Army of their Enemies 
come on directly to their Habitation, and in a Moment 
more could fee all their Huts and Houftrold-ftuff flaming 
up together, to their grcat Grief and Mortification ; for 
they Bad a very great Lofs, and to them irretrievable, 
atleaft for fome Time. They kept their Station for 
awhile, tili they fbund the Savages, like wild Beafts, 
fpread themfelves all over the Place, rummaging cvery 
Way, and every Place, they could think of, in fearch' 
for Prey ; and, in perticular, for the People, of whora it 
Slow plainly appear'd they had Intelligence. 

The two EngUJbmen feeing this, thmking themfelves 
not fecure where they ftood, becaufe, as it was likely 
fome of the wild People might come that Way, fo they 
might come too many together, thought it proper to 
make another Retreat about half a Mile farther, be- 
lieving, as it afcerwards happened, that the farther they 
ftrolled, the fewer would be together. 

The next Halt was at the Enirance into a very thick 
grown Part of the Woods, and where an old Trunk of 
a Tree ftood, which was hollow, and vaftly large ; and 
in this Tree they both took their' Standing, refolving to 
fee there what might ofFer. 

They had not ltood there long, but two of theSavages 
appear'd running directly that Way; asif they had already 
Notice where they ftood, and were comine up to attack 
them j and a little Way farther, they efpy^l three more 
Coming after them, and iive more beyond them, al! Coming 
the fame Way ; befides which, they faw feven or eight m^re 
at a Diftance, running another Way ; for, in a Word, they 
ran cvery Way, like Sportfmen beating for their Game. 

The poor Men were now in great Perplexity, whether 
they fhould ftand, and keep their Poflure, or fly : But after 
a very fliort Debate with themfelves, they confider'd, that 
if the Savages raagM the Country thus, before Help came, 
they might, perhaps, find out their Retreat in the Woods, - 
and then aU would be loa; fo they refolv'd to ftand ttaxi 

D 2 te\ 



76 Tbe Lue and Advbnturbs if 
zherc ; and if Acre were too'many Co deal wich» tken they 
would get to theTop of che Tree, from whence they doubt- 
<d not co defend themfelves, fir$txc*fttd % as long as their 
Ammuniäon lafted, tho' all the Sa vages Chat were landed, 
which were near fifty, were to attack them. 

Havingreiolv'd upon this, they next confiderM whether 
they fhould fire at che firft two, or wait for the three, and 
£o take the middle Party ; by which the two and the five Chat 
ibllow'd would be feparated ; at length they refolv'dto kt 
the two firR, pafs by, unlefs they fhould Tpy them in die 
Tree, and come to attack them. The two HrftSarages alfo 
confirm'd theminjthis Refoiution, by turning a little from 
them towards another Part of the Wood ; but the three, 
&nd the five after them, came forwards dirc&iy Co the 
Tree, as if they had known t\it Ewglißmen were there. 

Seeing them come fo ftrait towards them, they refolv'd 
*o take them in a Line as they came; and as they refolv- 
cd to fire bnt one at a Time, perhaps the firft Shot might 
hit them all three ; to which Purpofe, the Man who was 
to fire, pnt three or four Bullets into his Piece ; and, hav* 
ing a fair Loophole, as it were, from a broken Hole in 
the Tree, he took a füre Aim, without being feen, wait« 
ing tili they were within about thirty Yards of the Tree, 
fo that he could not mifs. 

While they were thus waiting, and theSavages came 
on, they ptainly faw, that one of the three was the run- 
away Savage that had efcap'd from them, and they both 
knew him diftincUy, and refolv'd, that, if poflible, he 
ihould cot efeape, tho* they fhould both fire; fo the other 
Jtood ready with his Piece, that if he did not drop at the 
jirit Shot, he fhould be füre to have a fecond. 

But che üril was too good a Markfmän to mifs his 
Aim; for, as theSavages kept near one another, a little 
behind in a Line, in a Word, he fired, and hit two of 
jthem dire&ly : Ihe foremoft was küTd outright, being 
fhot in the Head; the fecond, which was the rün-away 
lndia* % was fhot thro* the Body, and feil, but was not 
quite dead ; and the third had a little Scratch in the 
Shoulder, perhaps, by the fame Ball that weat through 
the Body of the fecond; and, being drcadfaily frighteo, 
thongh not much hurt, fat down upon the Ground, 
fereaming and yelling in a hideous Mannen 

The 



ROBINSONCRÜSOE. 77 

The five that were behind, more frighted with die 
Noife, than fcnüble of their Danger, ftood ftill at firft 7 
for che Woods made the Sound a thottfand Times bieger 
than k really was ; the Echoes rattling from one Side to 
another, and the Fowls rifing from all Parts, fereaming 
and making, every Sort, a feveral Kind of Nöife, ac- 
tording to their Kind» joft as it was when I fired the 
firft Gon that, perhaps, was ever fliot off in that Place, 
fince it was an Ifland. 

However, all beng fiknt agarn, and they not know- 
ing what the Matter was, came on nnconcern'd, tili 
they came to that Place where their Companions lay, 
in a Condition miferabie enough : And here the poor 
Ignorant Creatore*, not fenfibie that they were withirr 
Keach of the fame Mifchicf, ftood all of a Huddle over 
the wounded Man, talking, and, as may be fuppofed, 
inqoiring of him how he came to be hurt ; and who, *tis 
very rational to belicre, told them that a Flaßi of Fire* 
firft, and immediately after thac, Thunder from their 
Gods, had kill'd thofe two, and wounded him : This, I 
fay, is rational; for nothing is more certain than that, as 
they faw no Man near them, fo they had never heard a 
Gun in all their Lives, or fo mach as heard of a Gun ;- 
seither knew they any thing of killing or wouadrrtg at st 
Diilance, with Fire and Bullet* ; if they hadV one mighr 
fealbnably beKeve, they woaW not have ftood fo un- 
concerned, in viewin g the Fate of their Fellows, with- 
out fome Apprehenfion of their own. 

Our two Men, though, as they confefled to me, it 
grieved them to be obUged to kill fo many poor Crea- 
tures, who at the fame Time had no Notion of their 
Danger ; yet, ha?ing them all thus in their Power, and 
the firft having loaded bis Piece again, refolv'd to leü 
fly both together among them ; and, fingline out* bj? 
Agreement, which to aim at, they fhot together, and 
kill'd or \ery much wounded four of them ; the fifth, 
frighted even to Death, though rot hurt, feil with the* 
reft; fo that our Men, feeing them all fall together, 
thoaght they had kill'd them all. 

The Belief that " the Savages were all killed, made 
our two Men come boldly out from t\ie> Tte*. >aefaw« 
they had charg'd their Guns again, which vw * vtwcng

Sccp; and they wcrc under fome Surprife, when tfcey 
caiue co the Place, and found no lcfs than four of the 
Li en alivr, and of them, two very littie hurt, and one 
not at all : 'I hia oblig'u them to fall upon them wiih 
the Stocks of their Mufquets ; and firffc they made fore 
of the run-away Savage, that had been the Caufe of all 
the Mifchief ; and of another that was hurt in his Knee, 
and put them out of their Pain ; then the Man that was 
nor hurt ac all came and kneel'd down to them, with his 
two Hands held up, and made piteous Moan to them by 
Gefturesand Signs, for his Life; but could not fay one 
"Word to them that they could underirand. 

However, they ßgn'd to him to fit down at the Foot of 
a Tree thereby ; and one of the Englifimen, with a Piece 
of Rope-twine, which he had by great Chance in his 
Pocket, ty'd his Feet faft together, and his Hands behind 
him, and there tbey left him; and« with what Speed they 
could, made after the other two, which were gone before, 
fearing they, or any moreofthem, ftiould find the Way 
to their covered Place in the Woods, where their Wive?, 
and the few Goods they had leftlay : They came once 
ia Sight of the two Men, but it was at a great Dißance; 
however, they had the Satisfa&ion to fee them crofs over 
a Valley, towards the Sea, the quite contrary Way from 
that which led to their Retreat, which they were afratf 
of ; and, being fatisfied with that, they went back to the 
Tree, where they left their Prifoner, who, as they fuppo- 
fed, was deliver'd by his Comrades ; for he was gone, and 
the twoPiecesof Rope-yarn/with which they had bound 
him, lay juft at the Foot of the Tree. 

They were now in as great a Concern as before, not 
knowing what Courfe to take, or how near the Eneroy 
inight be, or in whatNumbers; fo they refo'vM'to 
go away to the Place where their Wives were, to fee if 
all was well there, and to make them eafy, who were in 
Fright enough to be füre ; for though the Savages were 
their own Country-folk, yet they were moft terribly a- 
fraid of them, and perhaps the more, for the Knowledge 
they had of them. 

When they came thither, they found the Savages had 

bten in the Wood, aud very near the Place, but had not 

found h; for indtfed, it was uiacccfcVAs, ty the Trees

flandmg fo thick, as before, unlefs the Perfons fecking it 
lii«d bcen dire&ed by thofethat knew it, which thefewere 
not; they found, therefore, every thing very fafe, only 
the Women in a terrible Fright : Whüe they were here r 
they had the Comfort of feven of the Spaniards Coming to 
their Afiiftance; the other ten, with their Servants, and 
old Friday, I mean Fridafs Father, were gone in a Body

kept there, in Cafe the Savages fhould haveroved over to 
"that Siäe of the Country ; but they did not fpread fo far :. 
With the feven Spaniards came one of the Savages, who, as 
I faid, were their Prifoners formerly,. and witn them 
alfo came the Savagc, whom the Englißmen had L»ft 
boünd Hand and Foot at the Tree ;: for it feems they 
came that Way, faw the Slaughter of the feven Mcn, 
and unbound the eighth, and brought him along wich 
them; where, however, they were oblig'd to bind him 
again, as they had done the two others, who were lefc 
when the third ran away. 

The Prifoners began now to be a Bürden to them ; and 
they were fo afraid of their efeaping, that they thoughtr 
they were under an abfolatc Neceffity to kill them for 
their own Preferva{ion : However, the Spaniard Govemor 
wonid not con ent to it ;. bat order'd, that they fhould be 
fent out of the Way, to my old Cave in the Valley, and 
|>e kept there with Vmo Spaniards to guard them, and gWe 
them Food : Wbich wa3 done ; and they were bound 
there Hand and Foot for that Nig'»t. 

When the Spaniards came, the two Englißmen were 
{o encourag'd, that they coulcL not fatisfy themfclves to 
Äay any longer there ;. but taking five of the Spaniards, 
and therafelves, with fonr Mufquets and a Piftol airiong 
them, and two ftout Quarter-ftaves, away they went in 
Qoelt of the Savages : And firft, they came to the Tree 
where the Mcn lay that had becn killed ; but it was 
«afy to fee, that fome more of the Savages had been 
there ; for they attempted to carry their dead Men away, 
and had dragg'd two of them a good Way, but had given 
it ove/ : From thence they advaneed to the firft niing 
G round, where they had flood,and ieen their Camp deftroy-

Caution, to go forward towards their ruin'd Plantaben: 
J3ut a utile before they came thither, Coming in Sight of 
thc Sca-fhorc, they faw plainly the Savages all cmbarkmg 
again in their Guues, in order tobe gone. 

They feemed forry at firft, that therc was no Way 
to come at them, to give them a partine Blow : Bot, 
u^on the Whole, wert Tery well fatisfied to be rid of 
them. 

The poor Englißmt* being now twkc nrin'd, and 
all their Improvements deftroyed, the reft all agreed to 
come and help them to rebuild, and to af&Ä üiem with 
needful Supplies Their three Conntrymen, who were 
no: yet noted for having the leail Inclination to do any 
Good, yet, as foon as they heard of it (for they,' livine 
remote Haftward t knew nothing of the Matter tili afl 
was over) came and offered their Help and Ai&ftance, 
and did very friendly Work for feveral Days, to refiort 
their Habitations, and make Neceflaries for them ; and 
thus in a little Time, they were fet upon their Legi 
again. 

About two Days after this, they had the farther Sa« 
tisfa&ion of feeing three of the Savages Camots come 
driving on Shorc, and» at fome Dißance from them» 
with two drowned Men ; by which they had Reafira 
to belicve, that they had met with a Storm at Set» 
and had overfet fome of them ; for it had blown Tery 
hard the Night after they went off. 

However, as fome might mifearry, fo on the other 
Hand, enough of them efeaped to inform the reft, at 
weJl of what they had done, as of what happened to 
them ; and to vvhet them on to another Enterprife of 
the fame Nature, which they, it feems, refolved to at- 
tempt, with fufficient Force to carry all before themj 
for, except what the iirft Man had told them of Inha- 
bitants, they could fay little to it of their own Know- 
ledge; for they never faw one Man, and the Fellow be-. 
ing killed that had affirnfd it, they had no other Wit-" 
nefs to confirm it to them. 

It was five or fix Mönths after this, before they heard 
any more of the Savages ; in which Time our Men

Lack, or had given over the Hopes of better ; when, oiv 
a fudden, they wcrc invaded with a moft formidablc 
Fleet, of no left than twenty-eight Cattocs foll of Savage* 
armed with Bows and Arrows, great Clubs, wooden 
Swords, and fach like Engines of War ; and they 
brought fach Nambers with them, that, in (hört, it put 
all oorPeople into the atmoft.Confternati.on. 

As they came on Shore in the Evening, and at the 
EaÄermoft.fkle of the Wand, our Men had that Night 
to confnlt and confider what to do ; and", fn the firft Place, 
knowing that their being entirely concealed, was their

white the N amber of tbdr Eacmies was fo great, they 
tfceserqre reibfved, firft of all, to take down the Huts 
which wäre baut for the two Englißmen, and'dHve away 
their Goats to the old Cave; becaufe they fuppofed the 
Savages would go directly thither, as foorr as it was Day , 
to play the old Game over again, tho* they did not now 
Und within two Leagnes of it. 

In the next Place, they drove away all the Flock of 
Goats they had at the old Bbwcr, as I calied it, whichv 
bdonged to tbe Spaniards -» and, in (hört, left as little 
Appearance of Inhabitants any where as. poffible ; and

To their Slaves they did not givc either Mufquet or F*

Jike a Quarter-ftafF, with ä great Spike of Iron raftened 
into each End of it, and by his Side ä Hatchet; alfoevcry 
one of our Men had Hatchets. Two of the Women could 
not be prevail'd upon, but they would come into the Fight; 
and they had Bows and Arrows, which the Spaniar<h\?Ä 
taken from the Savages, when the firft Adtion happened, 
which I have fpoken of, where the Indiens fbught with 
one a not her, and the Women had Hatchets too. 

The Spamard Governor, whom I have deferibed fo of- 
ten, commanded the whole ; and William dtkins, who, 
tho' a dreadful Fellow for Wickednefs, was a moft daring 
bold Fellow, commanded under him. The S avages came, 
for ward like Lions, and our Men, which was the woift 
of their Fate, had no Advantage in their Situation j only 
that Witt. Atkin$t who now pröved a moll ufeful Fellow, 
with fix Men, was planted juft behind a fmaJl Thicketof

of them pafs by, and then rlre into the Middle of them; 
and, as foon as he had fired, to make his Retreat, as 
»imbly as he could, round a Part of the Wood, and fo 
come in behind the Spaniards where they ftood, having 
a Thicket ot frees all before them. 

When the Sa age< came on, they ran ftraggling aboot 
every Way in Jeaps, out of all Manner of Order j and 
Will. Atkim let ibout fifty of them pafs by him ; then, 
feeing the reft come in a very thickTh«ong, he Orders

witlffix or feven Bullets apiece, about as big as large Pi- 
ftol- bullets. How many they killed or wounded, they 
knew not ; but the Conßernation and Surprife was inex- 
prciBble among the Savages, who vvere frighted to the lad 
Degree, to hear fuch a dreadful Noife, and fee their Men 
killed, andothers hurt, but fee nobody thatdid it; when, 
in the Middle of their Fright, William Atkim, and his o- 
ther three, let fly again among the thickcft ofthem 5 and 
in lefs than a Minute, the £rit three, being loaded again, 
gave them a third Volley. 

Had William Atkim and his Men retir'd immediately, 
as foon as they had fired, as they were ordered to do ; 
or had the reft of the Body been at hand, to have pour'd 
in their Shot cöntinualiy, the Savages had been efTeäually 
roated ; for the Terror that was among them came princi- 
pally from this, vi«. That they nvere killed by the Gods <with 
Thunder and Lightning, and could fee nobody that hurt 
them ; but William Atkins^ ftaying to load again, difco- 
vered theCheat: Some of the Savages, who were at 2 
Diitance, fpying them, came upon them behind ; and 
tho' Atkim and his Men fired at them alfo, two or three- 
Times, and killed above twenty, retiring as faft as they 
could, yet they wounded Atkim himfelf, and killed 
one of hh Fei low Englißmcn with their Arrows, as they; 
did afterwards one Spaniard, and one of the Indian Slaves 
who came with the Women ; this Slave was a moft gallant 
Feltow, and fought moft defperately, killing five oftheni 
*ith his own Hand, having no Weapon but one of the : - 
armed Staves, arid an Hatchet. 

Oor Men being thus hard laid at, Atkim wounded: 
and two other Men killed, retreated to a rifing Ground 
iü the Wood ; arid the Spatriards, after firing three Vol- 
]fes npon them, retreated alfo ; for their Nümber was fo. 
great, and they were fo defperate, that tho' above fifty 
ofthem were killed, and more than fo many wounded, 
yct they came on in the Tecth of our M«n, fearlefs of 
Danger, and fhot their Arrows like a Cloud ; and it was 
obfervcd, that th/eir wounded Men, who were not quite

true Savages : Bat, finding our Men were gone, they did 
not feem to purfue them, butdrew themfelves up in akind 
of a Ring, which is, k feems, their Cuftora ; and fhouted 
twice, in Token of their Viftory : After which, they had 
the Mortificatio!! to fee feveral of their wonnded Men fall* 
dying with the mere Lofs of Blood. 

The $ palliar d Governor having drawn his little Body 
up together upon a rifing Ground, Aiiw 9 though he 
was wouoded, would have had him march'd, and charg-

Bot as it was a clear Moon-light Night, and they 
found the Savages in great Diforder about their dead and 
wonnded Men, and a great Harry and Noife among them 
where they lay, they afterwards refolved to fall upon. 
them in the Night, efpecially if they could come to give 
them but one Volley before they were chfcover'd. This. 
they had a fair Opportunity to do ; for one of the two 
Eaglißmen* in whofe Quarter it was where the Fight 
began, led them round, between the Woods and theSea- 
fidc, Wellward, and turning fhort South, they come fo 
aear where the thickeft of them lay, that before they were 
feen or heard, eight of them fired in among them, and did 
dreadful Execution npon them;. in half a Minute more 
eight others fired after them, pouring in their fmall Shot 
in fuch a Quantity, that Abundance were killed and 
wounded ; and all this while they were not able to fee 
who hurt them, or which Way to fly. 

/ The 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 8$ 

The Spamards charg'd again with the utmoft Expedition« 
and thca divided themfelves into 3 Bodies, and refolr'd to 
fall in among them all together : Thcy had in each Body 
8 Perfons ; that is to fay 44, whereof were 22 Men, and 
the a Women, who, by the way, fought defperately. 

Thcy jiivided the Fire-axms equalTy in each Party, 
and fo of the Haiberts and Staves. They would have 
had the Women kecp back ; bat they faid, the/ were 
refolv'd to die with their Hufbands. Having thas form'd 
their little Army, they march'd out from among the 
Trees , and came np to the Teeth of the Enemy, (hout- 
ing and hallowing as loud as they could ; the Savagea 
ftood all together, bot were in the utmoft Confufion, 
hearing the Noife of our Men fhouting from three Quar- 
ten together ; they would have fought if they had feen 
os ; and, as foon as we came near enough to be feen» 
fome Arrows were (hot, and poor old FriJay was wound- 
ed, tho' not dangeroufly. But our Men gave tbem no 
Time ; but, runnmg up to them, fir'd among them three 
Ways, and then feil in with the But-ends of their Muf* 
quets, their Swords, arm'd Staves, and Hatchets; and 
)aid aboot them fo well, that, in a word, they fet up a 
difinal Screaming and Howüng, flying to fave their Lives 
which Way foever they could, 

Our Men were tir*d with the Execution ; and küTd, or 
mortally woonded, in the two Fights, about 1 80 of them; 
the reft, being frighted out of their Wits, fcour'd thro* 
the Woods, and over the Hills, with all the Speed and 
Fear that nimble Feet could help them to do ; and as we 
did not trouble ourfeives mach to purfue them, they got 
all together to the Sea-fide, where they landed, and 
where their Canoes lay. But their Difafter was not at an 
Bnd vet ; for it blew a terrible Storm of Wind that E ven- 
ing wom the Sea*ward ; fo that it was impofllble for 
them to put off; nay, die Storm continuing all Night, 
when the Tide came up, their Canoes were moft of them 
driven by the Surge of the Sea fo high upon the Shore, 
that it requir'd infinite Toil to gel them off; and fome

wberc the Savages were fled, and fee what Pofture they 
were in. This necefTarily led them over the Place where 
theFight had bcen, and where they found feveral of the 
poor Creaturcs not quite dead, and yet paft recovering 
Life; a Sight difagreeable enough to generous Minds ; 
for a truly great Man, tho' oblig'd by the Law of Battle 
to deftroy his Enemy, takes no Delight in his Mifery. 

However, tbere was no need to give any Order in thiY 
Cafe ; for their own Savages, who were their Servants, 
difpatched thofe poor Creatares with their Hatchets. 

At length they carne in View of the Place where the 
more mifcrable Remains of the Savages Army lay, where 
there appeared about 100 flill ; their Pofture was gene- 
rally fitting upon the Ground, with their Knees op to» 
wards their Mouth, and the Head put between theüands, 
Jeaning down upon the Knees. 

When oar Men came within two Mafquet-fliot of themy 
the Spamard Governor Order' d two Mufquets to be fired 
without Ball, to alarm them ; this he did, that by -their 
Coantenance he might know what to expedt, <vix. Whe- 
ther they were ftill in Heart to fight, or were fo heartily 
beaien, as to be difpirited and difcourag'd, and fo he 
might manage accordingly . 

This Stratagem took ; for, as foon as the Savages 
heard the firft Gon, and faw the Flefli of the fecond, 
they ftaited up opon^theirFeet in the greateft Confter- 
nation imaginable; and, as oar Men advanced fwiftly 
towards them, they all ran fcreaming and yawling away, 
with a kind of an howling Noife, which oar Men did. 
not underftand, and had never heard before ; and thus 
they ran up the Hills into the Country. 

At firft, cur Men had rouch rather the Weather had 
been calm, and they had all gone away to Sea: Bat they 
did not<hen confider, that this might probably have been 
the Occaitonof their Coming agd in in fuch Moltitodes as 
not to be refifted ; or, at kaft, to come fo many and fo 
eften, as would qui:e defolate the Ifland, and ftarve them :

kept always with them, prov'd the beft Counfellor in this

more to plague the Ifland.. 

They confuJtcd long about this, and fome were againfl

and live there defoerate ; and fo they (hould have them

finefs, and have their Plantation continually rifled, all 
their tarne Goats deßroyed, and, in fliort, be reduc'd to 
a Life of continual Dißrefs. 

Will. AtHns told them, They had better have to do with 
100 Men, than. with 100 Nations; that as they muH de- 
ftroy their Boats, fo they muß deßroy the Men, or be all 
of them deßroy 'd themfelves. In a word, he ßiew'd them 
the Neccflity of it fo plainly, that they all catne into it ; 
fo they went to work immediately with the Boats, and, 
getting fome dry Wood together from a dead Tree, they 
try'd to fet fome of them on Fire ; but they were fo wet, 
that they would fcarce burn. Ho vv ever, the Fire fo burn'd 
the upper Part, that it foon made them unfit for fwim- 
ming in the Sea as Boats. When the lndians faw what 
they were about, foine of them came running out of the 
Woods; and, Coming as near as they could to our Men, 
kneel'd down and cry'd, Oa, Qa, Waramokoa, and fome 
other Words of their Language, which none of the others 
underßood any thing of ; but as they made pityful Gef- 
taxes $ and dränge Noifes, it was eafy to underßand, they 
begged to have their Boats fpared, and that they wouid 
be gone, and never come thither again. 

But our Men were now fatisficd, that they had no way 
to preferve themielves, or to fave their Colony, but ef- 
feclually to prevent any cf thefe People from ever going 
hozne again; depending upon this, that if ever fo mucK 
as one of them got back into their Country to teil the 
Story, the Colony wa3 undone: So that, letting them 
know that they (hould not have any Mercy, they feil to 
work with thejr Canoes, and deßroyed them evcry one, 
that the Storm had not deßroyed before ; at the Sight of 
which the Sa vages raifed a hideous Cry in the Woods, 
which our People heard piain enough ; after which they

their Cattle, and the Indians did not find their main Rc- 
treat, I raean my old Caftle at the Hill, nor the Cave in»

tore up the Vines and Grapes, being juft then almoft 
ripe ; and did our Men an iireftimable Damage, tho', to 
themfelres, not one Farthing's worth of Service. 

Tho 1 our Men were able to fight them upon all .Occa* 
fions, yet they were in no Condition to purfue them, or 
hunt them up and down ; for as they were too nimble of 
Foot for our Men when they found them finghe, (b ou*

ed with their Numbers : Thebeft was, they had no Wea- 
pons ; for tho* they had Bows, they had no Arrows left> 
nor any Materials to make any, nor had they any cdg\? 
Tool or Weapon among them. 

The Extremity and Diltrefs they were reduc'd to was 
great, and indeed deplorable, but at the fame Time our 
Men were alfo brought to very hard Circomftances by 
them ; for tho* their Retreats were preferr'd, yet their 
Provifion was deftroyed, and their Harreft fpoited; and! 
what to do, or which Way to tarn themfelres, they: 
knew not : The only Refuge they had now, was the 
Stock of Cattle they had in the Valley by the-Cave, and' 
fome little Com which grew therei The three Englifo*

come at, yet coold be vcry hardly come ac themfelves. 
The firft thing they concluded, when they faw what 
their Circomfhuices were, wai, that they would, if poffible, 
drive them up to the farther Part of the Ifland, Sotxth- 
Eaft, that if any more Savages came on Shore, they might 
not find one another; then, that they would daily hunt 
and harrafs them, and kill as many of them as they could 
comeat, tili they had redac'd theirNamber; and ifthey 
could at lad tarne them, and bring them taany thing, 
they would give them Com, and teach them how to plant 
and live lipon their daily Labour. 

In order to this, they follow'd them, and fo terrify'd 
them with their Guns, that in a few Days, if any of them 
fircd a.Gun at an hdian, if he did not hit him, yet he 
would fall down for Fear ; and {o dreadfully friehted 
they were, that they kept out of Sight farther and far- 
ther, tili at laft our Men following them, and every Day 
almoft killing and wounding fome of them, they kept up 
in $he Woods and hollow Places fo much, that it reduc'd 
them to the utmoft Mifery for want of Food ; and many 
were afterwards found dead in the Woods, without any 
Hart, bat merely ftarved to Death. 
. When our Men found this, it made their Hearts re-

propofed, if poffible, to take one of them alive, and 
bring him to underftand what they meant, fo far as to be 
able to a£t as Interpreter, and to go among them, and 
fee if they might be brought to fome. Conditions, tbat 
might be depended upon to fave their I.ives, and to do

It was fome Time bcfore any of them could be taken ;

They haa taügh* ttem boih to plaut Coro, make, Bread,, 
breed tarne Goats, ar.d milk them ; they wanted nothing 
but Wives, and they foon woyld have becn a Nation : 
They were confined to a Neck of Land, furrounded with 
high Rocks behir.d them, and lyiog piain towards theSea 
before them, on the South -eaft Corner of the llland : They 
had Land enough, and it. was very good and fruitful ; for 
they had a Piece of Land about a Mile and half broad, 
and three or four Miles in Length. 

Our Men taught them to make wooden Spades, fuch ai 
Imade for myfelrYand gave among them 1 2 Hatchets, and 
3 or 4 Knives ; and thtre they liv'd the moll fubjefted 
innoccnt Creatures, that ever were lieard of. 

After this, the Colony enjoyed a perfeft Tranquillity, 
wiih refpec't to the Savages, tili I came to re vifn them, 
which was in about two Years : Not but that now-and- 
th&7 fome Canoes of Savages came on Shore for their. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 91 

triumphal an natural Feafts ; but as they were of feveral 
Nations, and, perhaps, had never heard of thofe that 
came beforc, or the Rcafon of it, they did not make 
any Search or Inquiry after their Countrymen ; and if 
they had, it would have been very hard for them to 
have found them out. 

Thus, I think, I have givcn a fall Account of all that 
happened to them, to my Retarn, at leaft, that was 
worth Notice. The Indians, ör Savages, were wonder- 
fully civiliz'd by them, and they frcquently went among 
ihem ; bot fbrbid, on Pain of Death, any of the Indians 
coming to them, becaufe they would not have their Set- 
tlement betrayed again. 

One thing was very remarkable, <vtz. that they taught 
the Savages to make Wicker-work, or Bafkets ; bnt they 
foon out- did their Mafters ; for they made Abundance of 
moftingenious things in Wicker-work ; particularly, all 
Sorts of Bafkets, Sieves, Bird-cages, Cupboärds, fcfr. as 
alfo Chairs to fit on, Stools, Beds, Couches, and Abun- 
dance of other things, being very ingenious at fuch Work, 
when they were once put in the Way of it. 

My Coming was a particular Relief to thefe People, 
becaufe we farnifh'd them with Kniyes, Scifiars, Spades, 
Shovels, Pickaxes, and all things of that Kind which 
Aty could want. 

With the Help of fhefeTcck th?y «rcre fo very Jian- 
4y, that they came, at laß, to build up their Huts, or 
Houfes, very handfomely ; raddling, or working it up 
like Bafket-work all the Way round, which was a very 
extraofdinary Piece of Ingenuity, and look'd very odd ; 
but was an exceeding good Fence, as well" againft Heat, 
as againft all Sorts of Vermin ; and our Men were fo taken 
with it, that they got the wild Savages to come and do 
the like for them ; fo that when 1 came to fee the two 
Englißfnen** Colonies, they look'd, at a Diftanee, as if 
they liv'd all like Bees in an Hive ; and as for Will. Jtkws, 
who was now become a very induftrious, neceßary, and 
fbber Fellow, he had made himfelf fuch a Tent of Baf- 
ket-work, as I believe was neyer feen ; it was 120 Paces 
round in the Outfide, as I meafured by my Steps-; the 
Walls were as clofe-worked as a Bautet, in PanneU 
or Squares, thirty-tw.o in. NuroA^r, a$A Nt.\>j ^.\wv<^

firft fpoke it in a very broken Maancr, ük4

thcir Mcthcrs. There were nonc of thofe Children above 
fix Years old when I came thither; for it was not noch 
above fcvcn Years that they had fetched thefe five Savage 
Ladies over, but they had all been pretty fruitful, for 
they had all Children, more or lefs : I think the Cook's 
Mate's Wife was big of her f^xth Child j and the Motbers 
wcre all a good Sort of well-govern'd, quiet, laborioos 
Woraen, modeft and decent, helpful to one another, 
niighty obfervant and fubjcd to their Mafiers, 1 cannot 
call them Hufbands ; and vvanted nothing but to be well 
inftru&ed in the Chriftian Religion, and to be legally. 
married ; both which were happily brought about after- 
wards by my Means, or, at leaft, by the Confequence of 
iny Coming among them. * 

Having thus given an Account of the Colony ingene- 
ral, and pretty much of my five ranagate Englißmtn, I 
mufl fay fomething of the Spaniards, who were the xnaia 
Body of the Family ; and in whofe Story there are föne 
Iccidents alfo remarkable enough. 

I had a great many Difcourfes with them about their 
Circumßances, when they were among the Savages : They 
told me readily, that they had no Inßances to give cf their 
Application or Ingenuity in thatCountry ; that they were 
a poor miferablc dejecW handful of People; that if 
Means had been put into their Hands, they had yet fo 
abandon'd themfclves to Defpair, and fo funk under the 
Weight of their Misfortunes, that they thought of nothing 
but^ ftarving : One of them, a grave and very fenfible 
Man, told me, he was convinc'd they were in the wrong; 
that it was not the Part of wife Men to give up thexn- 
felves to their Mifery, but always to take hold of the 
Helps which Reafon ofFer'd, as well for prefent Support, 
as for future Deliverance : He told me, that Grief was 
the mofl fenfelefs infignificant Paflion in the World ; for 
that it regarded only things paft, which were generally 
impofiible to be recalled or to be remedied, but had no 
Vieiv to things to come, and had no Share in any thing 
that look'd like Deliverance, but rather added to the 
Affliäion, than propofed a Remedy : And upon this, he 
repeated a Spaniß Provei b ; which tho' I cannot repeat 
in juft the fame Words that he fpoke it, yet I remember 
I made it into an Engliß Proverb of my own thus : 

h 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 95 

In Trouble to he troubled, 
Isto have jcur Trouble daul/ed. 

He ran on then in Remarks uoon all the Iittle Improve- 
ments I had made in my Solitude; my unwearied Appli- 
cation, as hecaH'd it, and kow I had made aCondition, 
which, in ics Circumftances, was at firft mach worfe thau 
theirs, a thoafand Times more happy than theirs was, 
even now, when thcy wcre all togecher : He told mc, it 
was remarkable, that Engtißmen had a greater Prefence 
of Mind, in their Diftrefs, than any People that ever he 
met with ; that their unhappy Nation, and the Portugwfe, . 
were the worft Men in the World to ftruggle with Mii- 
fortones ; for that their firfl: Step in Dangers, after com- 
mon Efforts are over, was always to defpair, lie down 
under it and die, without roufing their Thoughts up to 
proper Remedies for Efcape. 

I told hira, their Cafe and mine difFered exceedingly ; 
that they were call upon the Shore without Neceflaries, 
without Supply of Food, or of prefent Suftenance, tili 
they could provide it : That it is true, I had this Dif- 
advancage and Difcomfort, that I was alone ; bat then 
the Supplies I had providentially throwh into my Hands, 
by the unexpeäed driving of the Ship on Shore, was 
fuch a Help as would have encouraged any Creature in 
the World to have applied himfelf as I had done : 
Seignior, fays the Spaniard, had we poor Spaniards 
been in your Cafe, we fhould never have gotten half 
thofe things out of the Ship as you did : Nay, fays he, 
we fhould never have found Means to have gotten a 
Raft to carry them, or to have gotten a Raft on Shore 
without Boat or Sail ; and how mach lefs fhould we 
have done, faid he, if any of us had been alone ! Well, 
I defired him to abate his Compliment, and go on with 
the Hiftory of their Coming on Shore, where they 
landed : He told me, they unhappily landed at a Place 
where there were People without Provifions ; whereas, 
had they had the common Senfe to have put off to Sea 
again, and gone to another Ifland a Iittle farther, they 
had found Provifions, . though without People ; there 
being an Ifland that Way, as they had bejwi vAA> ^W<t 



96 Tbe Life and Advbnturbs •/ 

therc wcre Provifions, though no People ; that is to fay, 
that the SftwarJs of Trinidad had frequently been therc, 
and filled the Ifland wich Goals and Hogs st fereral 
Times 1 where they have bred in fuch Multituie, and 
where Turde and Sea-fowl* wert in fuch Plenty, that 
they conld have been in no want of Flefh, thongh they 
had round so Biead ; whereas here they were only fuf- 
tain'd with a fem Roots and Herbs, which they ander- 
fiood not, and which had no Subftance in them, and 
which the Inhabitanta gave them fparingly enoueb, and 
who could treat them no better, unlefs they would tarn 
Canibals, and eat Men's Fleüi, which was the great Dain- 
ty of their Country. 

They gave me an Account how many ways they ftrote ' 
to civilize tbe Savages they were with, and to teach them '' 
rational Cuftoms in the ordinary Way of living, bat in* 
vain ; and how they retorted it upon them, as unjuft, ' 
that they, who came thither for Affiftance and Support, 
fhould attempt to fet up for Inftruclors of thofe that gave 
them Bread ; intimating, it feems, that none fhould fet 
up for t'i.e Initruftors of otheis, but thofe who could live 
without them. 

They gave medifmal Accounts of the Extremides they 
were driven to ; how fometimcs they were many Days 
without any Food at all; the Ifland they were upon being 
inhabited by a Sort of Savages that lived more indolent, 
and, for that Rcafon, were kfs fupplied with the Necef- 
faries of Life, than they had Reafon to believe others 
were in the fame Part of the World; and yet they found, 
that thefe Savages were lefs ravenous and voraciocs, 
than thofe who had better Snpplies of Food. 

Alfo they addid, That they could not bat fee wich 
what Demonftrations of Wifdom and Goodnefs, the go- 
verning Providence of God dire^s the Event of things 
in the World ; which, they faki, appear'd in their Cir- 
cumftances ; for if, prefTed by the Hardfhips they were 
under, and the Barrenncfs of the Country where they 
were, they had fearched after a better Place to live in, 
they had then been out of the Way of the Relief that 
happened to them by my Means. 

Then they gave me an Account, how the Savages, 
whom they lived among, expeäed them to go out with 

them 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 97 

them into theirWars : And it wastrue, that, as thcy had 
Fire-arms with them, had they not had the Difaiter to lofe 
thcir Ammunition, thcy ftiould not have been ferviceable 
only to their Friends, but have madc themfelves terrible 
both to Fricnd3 and Enemies ; but being withoat Powdtr 
and Shot, and yet in a Condicion, that thcy could not in 
Reafon deny to go out with their Landlords to theirWars.; 
when they came into the Field of Battle, they were in a 
worfe Condition than the Savages themfelves ; for they 
neither had Bows nor Arrows, nor could they ufe thofe 
the Savages gave them ; fo that they could do nothing 
bat ftand ftill, and be wounded with Arrows, tili they 
came up to the Teeth of their Enemy ; and then, indeed* 
the three Haiberts they had, were of Ufe to them ; and 
they would often drive a whole little Army before them, 
with thofe Haiberts and Iharpened Sticks put into the 
Mazzles of their Mufquets : But that for all this they 
were fometimes furrounded with Multitudes, and in greac 
Danger from their Arrows ; tili at laft they found theWay 
to make themfelves large Targets of Wood, which they 
cover'd with Skins of wild Beafts, whofe Nantes thcy 
knew not; and thefe cover'd them from the Arrows of the 
Savages ; that, notwithftanding thefe, they were fomerimes 
in great Danger, and were once five of them knock'd 
down together, with the Clubs of the Savages, which was 
the Time when one of them was taken Prifoner ; that is 
to fay, the Spamard, whom I had reliev'd : That at firft 
they thought he had been kill'd, but when afterwards they 
heard he was taken Prifoner, they were under the greateft 
Grief imaginable, and would willingly have all ventur'd 
their Lives to have refcu'd him. 

They told me, That when they were fo knock'd down, 
the reit, of their Company refcu'd them, and ftood over 
them, fighting tili they were come to themfelves, all but 
he who they thought had been dead ; and then they made 
their Way with their Haiberts and Pieces, ftanding clofe 
together in a Line, through a Body of above a thoufand 
Savages, beating down all that came in their Way, got 
the Viftory over their Enemies, but to their great Sorrow, 
becaufe it was with the Lofs of their Friend ; whom, the 
other Party finding him alive, carried off with fome o- - 
thers, as I gave an Account in my formst 

Vol. II. E TV«*

They defcribed moß afteftionately, how they were 
(urprifed with Joy at th* Return of their Friend ard 
Companion in iVlifcry, who they thought bad becn de- 
voured by wild Beafts of the worft Kind, *u/z. by wild 
Men ; and, yet how morc and more tliey were furpris'd 
with the Account he gave thcm of bis Errand, and that 
there was a Chriftian in aay Place near, much more odc 
that was ab!e v and had Humanity enough, to contribme 
to their Deliverance. 

They defcribed how they were aftoniflied at the Sigfet 

of the Relief I fent thein, and at the Appearance of 

l.oeves of Bread, things they had not feen fi nee their com« 

ing to that miferable Place ; how often they crofs'd it, ani 

blcfs'd it as Bread fent from Heaven ; and what a reviving 

Cordial it was to their Spirits to tafle it ; as alfo, of the 

other things I had fent for their Supply. And, after all« 

they would have told me (bmethingof the Joy they weit 

in, at the Sight of a Boat and Pilots to carry them away 

to the Perfon and PJace, from whence all thefe new Com* 

fort« came j but they told mc, it was impoffible to expreß 

. it by Words ; for their exceffive Joy natnrally driving them 

to unbecoming Extravagancies, they had no Way to de- 

icribe them, but by telling me, that they border'd upoi

(iiitable to the Senfe that was upon them ; that, in fome 

it worked one Way, and in fome another ; and that fome

troubled no roorc with thc Sa vages ; or that, if they were, 
they would be able to euc them off, if they were twice as 
xnany as before ; fo that they had no Concern about that. 
Then I enter'd into a ferious Difcourfe with the Spaniard 
whom I call'd Governor, about their Stay in the Ifland ; 
for, as I was not ceme to carry any of them off, fo it 
woüld not be juft to carry off fome, and leave others, 
who perhapa, would be unwilling to fiay, if their Strength 
was diminifhed. 

On the other Hand, I told them, I came to eftablifh 
them there, not toremove them ; and then I )et them know, 
that I had brought with me Relief of Jundry Kinds for 
them : That 1 had been at a great Charge to furply them 
with all things necefläry ; as well for their Convenience, 
as their Defence ; and that I had fach and f uch particu- 
lar Perfons with me, as well to increafe and recruit their 
N amber, as by the particular neceflary Employments 
which they were bred to, being Artificers, to ailift them in 
thofe things, in which, at preient, they were to feek. 

They were all together, when I talk'd thus to them ; 
and before 1 deliver'd to them the Stores I had brought, I 
a/ked them, one by one, if they had intirely forgot and 
buried the firft Animofities that had been among them, 
and could {hake Hands with one anot-her, and engage in 
a ftri& Friendfhip, and Union of Intereft, fo that there 
might be no more Mifunderftandings or Jealoufies. 

William Jtkins, with Abnndance of Franknefs and 
Good-humour, faid, They had met with AfHiäions 
enough to make them all fober, and Enemies enough 
to make them all Friends : That, for his Part, he would 
live and die with tbem ; and was fo far from defigning 
any thing againft the Spaniards, that, he owned, they 
had done nothing to him but what his own mad Hu- 
mour made neceflary, and what he would have done, 
and, perhaps, mach worfe, in their Cafe ; and that he 
would aik them Pardon, if I defired it, for the foolifh 
and brutifh things he had done to them ; and was 
very willing and defirons of living in Terms of entire 
Fne ndfhip and Union, with them ; and would do any 
thing that lay in his Power to convince them of it : 
And as for going to England, he cared not if he did 
not go thither thefc twenty Ycars. 

E a *\V* 



ioo 27* Life i»i Adventures of 

The Spaniards faid, They had, indeed, at £rft, dif- 
armed and excluded William Atkins, and his two Coun- 
trynien, for their ill Conduft, as they had lct me know : 
And they appealed to me, for the Neceffity thcy were 
under to do lö ; but that William Atkim bad behaved 
himfelflö bravcly in the great Fright thcy had with the 
Savages, and on fevcrai Occafions (ince, and bad fhewed 
himfelf fo faithful tp, and concerned for thegcncral In- 
tereft of them all, that they had forgotten all Chat was 
päd ; and thought he merited as much to be trafted with 
Arms, and fupplied with Ncceflaries, as any of them ; 
and that they had teflined their Satisfa&ion in him, by 
committing the Command to bim, next to tbe Governor 
himfelf : 'And as they had an intire Confidence in hin, 
and all his Cpuntrymen, fo they acknowledged, they had 
merited that Confidence, by all the Methods that honeft 
Ivlen could merit to be valued and trufted : And they 
moft heartily embraced the Occafion of giving me this 
Affurance, that they woukl never have any lntereft fe- 
parate from one another. 

lipon thefe frank and open Declarations of FriencU 
fhip, we appointed, the next Day, to dine all together; 
and indeed, we made a fplendid Feaft : I caufcd the 
Ship's Cook, and his Mate to come on Shore, and drcfs 
our Dinner ; and the old Cook's Mate we had oiv Shore, 
affifted. We brought on Shore fix Pieces of good Beer" 
and four Pieces of Pork, out of the Ship's Provifion, 
witb our Punch-Bowl, and Materials to fill it ; and, in 
particular, I gave them ten Bottles of French Ciaret, 
and ten Bottles of Engliß Beer ; things that neither the 
Spaniards, or the EnglißmtB, had tafted for many Years ; 
and which, it may be fuppofed, they were exceeding 
glad of. 

The Spaniards added to our Feaft üvc whole Kids, 
which the Cooks roafted ; and three of them were fent 
covered up clofe on board our Ship, to the Seamen, 
that they might feaft on frelh Meat from on Shore, is 
we did with their falt Meat from on Board. 

After this Feaft, at which we were very innocently 
merry, I brought out my Cargo of Goods, w herein, that 
there might be no Difpute about dividing, I fhew'd them 
*h*rewas fufficient for. them all $ anddenYd, that they 

might 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 101 

night all take an equal Quantity of the Goods that were 
for wearing; that is to fay, equal whcn made up : As 
firft, I diftributcd Linen fufScient to make every one of 
thein foar Shirts ; and, atthe SpamartfsReqoeik, afterwards 
made thcm up fix ; thefe were exceeding cbmfortable to 
them, having been what v as I may fay, they had long fi nee 
forgot the Ufe of, or what it was to wear them. 

1 allotted the thin Evglifl Stuffs, which I mentioned 
beföre, to make every one a light Coat, like a Frock, 
which I judged fitteft for the Heat of the Seafon, cool 
and loofe ; and .ordered, that whenever they decäyed, 
they fhoald make more, as they thooght fit : The like 
for Pumps, Shoes, Stockings, and Hats, ifc. 

1 cannot exprefs w*hat Pltafure, what Satisfaktion, fat 
lipon the Countenances of all thefc poorMcn, when they 
faw the Care 1 had taken of them, and how well I had 
furnimed them : They told me, I was a Fathcr to rhem ; 
and that, having fuch a Correfpondent as I was, in fo rc- 
mote a Part of the World, it would make them forget, 
•that they were left in a defolate Place : And tl>ey all 
voluntarily engaged to me, not to leave the Place with- 
eat my Content. 

Then l prefented to them the People I had broaght 
with me ; particalarly the Taylor, the Smith, and the 
two Carpenters, all of them mofl neceffary People ; but, 
above all, my general Artificcr, than whom they could 
not name any thing that was more needful to them ; and 
the Taylor, to fhew his Concern for them, went to work 
immediately, and, with my Leave, made them every 
one a Shirt the firft thing he did ; and, which was ftill 
more, he taoght the Women not only how to few and 
ilitch, and ufe the Needle, bat made them affift to make 
the Shirts for their Hufbands, and for all the refl. 

As to the Carpenters, I fcarce need mention how ufeful 
they were ; for they took in Pieces all my clumfy unhandy 
things, and made them clever convenient Tables, Stools, 
Bedfteads, Cupboards, Lockers, Shelves, and every thing 
they wanted ofthat Kind.

Houfes fet up, furroondedwith aBaflcet-work, -palifado-'d 
like At kirnst, and adjoiaing to his Plantation : Their Tents 
were contriv'd fo, that they had each of them a Rootn a- 
part to lodge in, and a Middle Teut, like a great Score- 
houfe, to lay all their Goods in, and toeat anddrink in : 
And now the other two EngHJbmen remov'd their Habita- 
tion to the fame Place ; and fo the Ifland was divided in- 
to three Colonies, and no more; <vix. the Spaniards with 
old Friday* and the firfk Servants, at roy old Habiration un- 
der the Hill ; wbich was, in a Word, the capital City; and 
where they had fo enlarged and extended their Works, as 
well under, as on the Outfidc of.the Hill, that they liv'd, 
tho' perfeftly conceaTd, yet füll at large. Never was there 
Tuch a little City in a Wood, and fo hid, I belicve, in 
any Part of the World : For, I verily belicve, icoo Mer\ 
might have ranged the Ifland a Moiuh, and, if cbcv had 
not known there wasfuch a thing, and look'd 011 Putpofe 
for it, they would not have found it ; for theTrccs ilood 
fo thick, and fo clofe, and grew fo fall matted into one 
another, that nothing but cutcing them down firft, could 
difcover the Fkce ; except the two narre w Entrances 
where they went in and out, coold be found ; which was 
not very eafy : One of them was jufl down at the Watcr'a 
Edge, on the Side of the Creek ; and it was afterwards 
above 200 Yards to the Place ; and the other was up the 
Lad der at twice, as I have already formerly deferibed it ; 
and they had a large Wood, thick planted, alfo, on the Top 
of the Hill, which contained above an Acre, which grew 
apace, and cover'd the Place from all Difcovery there, 
with only one narrow Place between two Trees, not eafy 
to be difcover'd, to enter on that Side. 

The other Colony was that of Will. Attdns% % where 
th^re were four Families of Englißmen, I mean thofe I 
hod left there, with their Wives and Children ; three 
Sa vages, that were Slaves; the Widow and Children of 
the Englißjnan that was kiiled ; the young Man and the 
Maid, and, bv the Way, we made a Wife of her alib, 
before we went away : There were alfo the two Carpen- 
lera and the Taylor, who I brougbt with me, for them ; 
alfo the Smith, who was a very necefiary Man to them, 
cfpecially as a Ganfmith, to take care of their Arms ; 
and my other Man whom I caird Jack 0/ all Trade* \

JC4 The Life and Adventüres cf 

who was, himfelf, as good, almoft, as twenty Men; for 
hc was not only a vcry ingenious Fcllow, bot a vcry 
rnerry Fcllow ; and, before I went away, we married 
him to the honeil Maid that came with thc Youth in the 
Ship ; whom I mentioned before. 

And now I fpeak of Marrying, it brings me naturally 
to Tay fumcthing of the Frencb Ecclefiaftic, that I had 
brcught with me out of the Ship's Crew, whom I took 
at Sea. 1t is true, this Man was zRomUn, and, perhaps 
ic ir»ay givc OfFence to fome hereafter, if I leave any thing 
extraordinary upon Record, of a Man, whom, before I 
begin, I muft (to fet him out in juft Colours) reprefentin 
Terms vcry much to his Difadvantage, in the Account of 
Prcteßants ; as firft, that he was a Papiß ; fecondly, a jrV 
piß? Prieß; and thirdly, a Frencb Popiß Prieß. 

But Juftice demands of me to give him a dae Cha* 
radier ; and I muft fay, he was a grave, fober, piouf, 
and moil religious Perfon ; exaft in his Life, extenfive 
in his Charity, and exemplary in almoft evcry thing he 
did : What, then, can any or.e fay, againft my being 
very fcnfible oftheValue of fuch a Man, notwithftanding 
his Profeflion ? Though it may be my Opinion, perhaps, 
as well as the Opinion of others, who (hall read this, that 
hc was miflaken. 

The ürft Hour that I began to converfe with him, after 
he had agreed to go with me to the Eaß-lndies y I found 
Rcafon to dclight exceedingly in his Converfation \ And 
he firit began with me, about Religion, in the moft obli- 
ging manner imaginable. 

Sir, fays he, you have not only, under God (and, at 
that, he crofs'd his Breaft) faved my Life, but you have 
admitted me to go this Voyage in your Ship, and, by 
your obliging Civility, have taken me into your Family, 
giving me aD Opportunity of free Converfation : Now, 
Sir, fays he, you fee by my Habit, what my Profeflion 
is i and I guefs by your Nation, what yours is : I may 
think it is my Duty, and, doubtlefs it is fo, to ufe my 
utmoft Endeavours, on all Occafions, to bring all the 
Souls that I can to the Knowledge of theTruth, and to 
embrace the Catholic Do&rine ; but, as I am here under 
your Permiffion, and in your Family, I am bound, in 
JuAicc to your Kindnefs, as well as in Decency and good 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 105 

Manners, to bc ander your Government 5 and therefore» 
I fhäll not, without your Leave, enter into any Debates 
on the Points of Religion, in which we may not agree, 
farther than yon Jhall give me Leave. 

I told hira, his Carriage was fo modeil, that I could 
not but acknowledge it; that it was true, we were 
fuch People as they called Heretics ; but that he was 
not the firft Catholic that I had converfed with, with- 
out falling into any Inconvenicncies, or carry ing the 
Qoeftions to any Height in Debate ; that he fhould not 
find himfelf the worfe ufed for being of a different Opi- 
nion from us ; and if we did not converfe without any 
Diflike on either Side, upon that Score, it would be his 
Fault, not ours. 

He replied, That he thought our Converfation might 
be eafily feparated from Difputes ; that it wai not nis 
Bafinefs to cap Principles with every Man he difcourfed 
with ; and that he rather defired me to converfe with 
him as a Gentleman, than as a Religieux; that if I would 

five him Leave, at any Time, to difcourfe upon religioift 
ubjecls, he would readily compiy with it ; and that then 
he did not doubt but I would allow him alfo to defend his 
own Opinions, as well as he could : But that, without 
my Leave, he would not break in upon me with any 
fach thing. 

He told me farther, That he would not ceafe to do all 
that became him in his Office, as a Priefl, as well as a 
private Chriftian, to procure theGoods of the Ship, and 
the Safety of all that was in her: And though, perhaps, 
we would not join with him, and he could not pray with 
us, he hoped he might pray for us, which he would do 
upon all Occafions. In this manner we converfed ; and, 
as he was of a moft obliging Gentleman-like Bchaviour, 
fo he was, if I may be alloweJ to fay fo, a Man of good 
Senfe, and, as I believe, of great Lcarning. 

He gave me a moft divenxng Account of h : s Life, 
and of the many extraordinary Events of it ; of many 
Adveritures which had befallen bim in the few Ycars 
that he had been Abroad in the World, and partica- 
larly tbis was very remarkable ; <ws. That doring the 
Voyaee he was now engaged in, he had the Misfortune 
to fenve Times ftiipp'd and unfhipp'd, aivd tit\cxv*^p

to the Place whither any of the Ships he was in, were at 
firil deiigned : That his firft Intent was, to have gone to 
Martinuo ; and that he went on board a Ship bouod 
thrher, at St. Makes ; but being forced into Lißon in bad 
Weathcr, the Ship rcceived fozne Damage, by running 
aground in the Mouth of the River Tagus, and was ob- 
l.ged to unload her Cargo there : That finding a Pertu- 
gtufe Ship there bound to the Madeiras \ and ready to fail, 
and fuppofing he (hould cafily meet with a Vcflel there 
bound to Marti nica, he went on board, in order to fail to 
the Madeiras ; but the Mafier of the Portuguefe Ship, being 
but an indifferent Mariner, had been out in his Reckon- 
ing, and they drove to Fia/ ; where, however, he hap- 
pened to find a very good Market for his Cargo, which 
was Com ; and therefore refolved not to go to the Ma- 
deiras, but to load Salt at the Ißt o/Maj, and to goaway 
to Ihnufoundland : He had nö Remedy in this Exigeoce, 
but to go with the Ship ; and had a pretty good Voyage 
as für as the Banks, fo they call the Place where they catch 
the Fifb, where meeting with a Trencb Ship, bound from 
France to tguebeek, in the River ofCawada, and from thence 
to Martinicoy to carry Provifions, he thoughthe (hould have 
an Opportunity to complete his firft DtTign : But when he 
came to 9jtcbeck y the Malter of the Ship died, and the Ship 
proceeded no farther : So the next Voyage he fhipp'd him- 
ielf for France, in the Ship that was burnt, when we took 
them up at Sea, and then fhipp'd thcm with os for the 
Eaß-Indies> as I have already faid. Thus he had been 
difappointed in five Voyages, all, as, I may call it, in onc 
Voyage, befides what I (hall have Occafion to ment.on 
farther of the fame Perfon. 

But I (hall not make Digrefllons into other Mens 
rStories, which have no Relation to my own. I return 
to what concerns our AfFair in the Ifland : He came to 
me one Morning, for he lodgM among us all the while 
we were upon the Ifland ; and it happened to be juft 
when I was going to vifit the Englijhmeti\ Colony, at the 
lartheft Part of the Ifland ; I fay, he came to me, and 
toi J me, with a very grave Countenance, That he had, 
for two or three Days, defired an Opportunity" of fome 
Difcourfe wi:h me, which, he hoped, would not be dif- 
plealL.g tj ine, becaufc he thought it might, in fome 

Meafure, 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 107 

Meafure, correfpond with my general Dcfign, which 
was the Profperity of my new Colony ; and, perhaps 
might put it, at leaft, more than he yet thought ic was, 
in the Way of God's Bleffing. 

I look'd a little.farprisM at the lad Part of his Dif- 
courfc ; and turning a lüde fhort, How, Sir, faid I, can 
k be faid, that we are not in the Way of God's Bleffing, 
after fuch vifible Affiftances, and wonderful Deliver- 
ances, as we have feen here, and of which 1 have given/ 
yoo a large Account ? 

If you had pleas'd, Sir, faid he, \with a World of* 
Modefty, and yet with great Readinefs) to have heard 
sie, you would have found no Room to have been dif- 
pleafed, much lefs to think fo hard of me, that I fhould' 
fuggeft, that you have not had wonderful Afliftances and 
Dehveranccs : And, I hope, on your Behalf, that yott< 
are in the Way of God's Bleffing, and your Defign is ex- 
ceeding good, and will profper. But, Sir, faid he, tho 1 
it were more fo, than is even poffible to you, yct there 
may be fome among you, that are not equally right in 
theif Adtions : And you know, that in the Story of 
Ifrael, one Jcban, in the Camp, remo ed God's Bleffing* 
£rom them, and turned his Hand fo againft them, that 
thirty-fix of them, though not concerned in the Crime; 
were the Obje&s of Divine Vengeance, and bore the 
Weight of that Punifhment. 

"I was fenfibiy touch'd with this Difcourfe, and toid 
hixn, his Inference was fo.juft, and the whole Dcfignr 
feemed fo fincere,. and was really fo religio us in its ow n 
Nature, that I was \cry forry I had interrupttd him ;. 
and begg'd bim to go on :. And, in the mean Time, 
faecaufe it feemed, that what we* had bothto fay, might 
take up fome Time, I told him,.J was. going to the Eh- 
gliflmcni PJantations ; and afk'dhim to go with me, and 
we might difcourfe of it by- ihe Way : He told me, He 
would more willingly wait on me thither, b caufe there, 
partly, the Thing was acled, which he defirM to fpcak< 
to me about : So we walk'd on ; and I prefs'd hiai to be 
free and piain with me, in what he had to fay. 

Why then, Sir, fays he, be pleafed to gii-e me Leav-

ferent Religions be what they will, this general Princi-

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 109 

Englißnnctt, who have fetch'd Women from among the Sa- 
vages, and have taken them as their Wives, and have had 
xnany Children by them all, and yet are not married to 
them after any ftated legal Manner, as the Laws of God 
and Man require ;. and therefore are yet, in the Senfe of 
both, no lefs than Adulterers, and Hving in Adultery. 
To this, Sir, fays he, I know you will objecl, that there 
was no Clergyman, or Prieft of any kind, or of any Pro- 
feffion, to perform the Ceremony ; nor any Pen and Ink, 
or Paper, to write down a Contraft of Marriage, and have 
figned it between them. And I know alfo, Sir, what 
the Spamard Governor has told you ; I mean, of the 
Agreement that he obliged them to make, when they topk 
thefe Women, wiz. That they fhould chufe them out by 
Confent, and keep feparately to them ; which, by the way, 
is nothing of a Marriage, no Agreement with the Women 
as Wives, but only an Agreement among themfelves, to 
keep them from quarrelling. 

But, Sir, the Eflence of the Sacrament of Matnmony 
(fo he caird it, being a Roman) confifts not only in the 
xnutual Confent of the Parties to take one another as Man 
and Wife, but in the formal and legal Obligation that 
there is in the Con traft, to compel the Man and Wöman, 
at all Times, to own and acknowledge each other ; oblig- 
ing the Man to abftain from all other Women, to engage 
in no other Contradt while thefe fubfift ; and^pn all Oc- 
cafions, as Ability allows, to provide honeftly for them, 
and their Children j and to oblige the Women to the 
fame, or like Conditions, mutatis mutandis, on their Side. 

Now, Sir, fays he, thefe Men may, when they pleafe, 
or when Occäfion prefents, abandon thefe Women, dif- 
own their Children, leave them to perifh, and take other 
Women, and marry them whilft thefe are living. And 
here he added, with fome Warmth, How, Sir, is God 
hon ou red in this unlawful Liberty ? And how (hall a 
Blefling fucceed your Endeavours in this Place, however 
good in themfelves, and however fincere in your Defign, 
while thefe Men, who at prefent are your Subje&s, un- 
der your abfolute Government and Dominion, are al- 
lowed by you 'to live in open Adultery ?

with ; for ic was certainly true, that tho' they had no 
Clergyman on the Spot, yet a formal Contrad oo both 
Sides, made before Wknefles, and confirmed by any Tb- 
kcn, which the.y had all agreed to be bound by, tho' it 
had been but che breaking a Stick between them, engag- 
ing the Mcn to own thcfe Women for their Wives upon 
all Odcafions, and never to abandon them or their Chil- 
dren, and the Women to the fame with their Hufbands, 
Lad been an effedtual lawful Marriage in the Sight of 
God ; and it was a great NegleÖ, that it was not done. 

But Ithought to have gotten off with my young Prieft, 
by telling him, That all that Part was done when I was 
not here ; and they had Iived fo many Years with them 
now, that if it was an Adultery, it was paft Remedy; 
they could do nothing in it now. 

Sir, fays he, aflcing your Pardon for fuch Freedom, 
you are right in this ; That it being done in your Ab- 
lence, you could not be charged with that Part of the 
Crime. But 1 befeech you, flatter not yourfelf, that you 
arc not thercfore und er an Obligation to do your utter- 
moil now to put an End to it : How can you think, but 
that, Tet the Time päd lie on whom it will, all theGuilt, 
for the future, will lie intirely upon you ? Becaufe it i«. 
certainly in your Power now to put an Endto it ; and in. 
nobod'y's Power but yours. 

1 was fo düll (tili, that I did not takc him iight ; but 
I imagined, that, by putting an End to it, he meant, 
that I (hould part them, and not fuffer them to live toge- 
ther any longer : And I faid to him, I could not do that 
by any mcans, for that it would put the whole Ifland in 
Confufion. He feem'd furprifed that I (hould fo far 
miftake him. No, Sir, fays he, I do not mean, that 
)ou (hould feparate them, but. legaüy and efFeftually 
nvdrry them now : And, Sir, as my Way of marrying 
may not be fo eafy to reconcile them to, tho' it will be 
as effectual, even by your own Laws ; fo your Way maj 
be as well before God, and as valid among Men ; X 
mean, by a written Contraft, fignM by both Man and 
Woman, and by all the Witneffes prefent ; which all 
the Laws of Etoofe would decree to be valid. 

I was amazed to fee fo much true Piety, and fö much 
Sincerity of Zeal, befides the unufual Impartiality in hu 

Difcourfe, 



ROBINSONCRUSOE. m 

Difcourfe, as to his own Party or Church; and fuch a true 
Warmth for thc preferving People that he had no Know- 
ledge of, or Relation to; J fay f for preferving them from 
tranfgreffing the Laws of God ; the like of which, I had, 
indeed, not met with any-where. But recollecling what 
he had faid, of marrying them hy a written Contracl, 
which I knew would ftand too ; I returned it back upon 
him, and told him, I graute d all that he had faid to be 
juft, and, on his Part, very kind, that I would difcourfe 
with the Men upon the Point now, when I caoie ti them. 
And I kntw no Reafon why they fhould fcruple to let 
him marry them all ; which I knew well enough would 
be grai t jd to be as-authentic and valid in England, as if 
they were married by one of our own Clergymen. Wiiat 
was aftcrwards done in this Matter, I fliall fpeak of by 
itfelf. 

J then prefled him to teil mc, what was the fecond 
Complaint which he had to make ; acknowledging, that 
1 was very much his Debtor for the firft ; and thanked 
him heartily for it. He told me, he would ufe the fame 
Freedom and Piain nefs in the fecond ; and hoped I 
I would take it as well : And this was, That, notwith- 
ftanding thefe Engiiß Subjecls of mine, as he called them, 
had Hved with thefe Wo men for almoft feven Years, and 
had taught them to fpeak Engiiß, and even to read it ; 
and that they were, as be perceived, Women of tolerable 
Underflanding, and capable of Inftruclion ; yet they had 
not to this Hour taught them any thing of the Chriftian 
Religion ; no, not fo much as to kriow that there was a 
God, or a Worihip, or in what manner God was to be 
ferved ; or that their own Idolatry, and worihipping they 
knew not who, was falfe and abfurd. 

This, he faid, was an unaccountable Negleft, and 
what God would certainly call them to an Account for ; 
and, perhaps, at laß take the Work out of their Hands. 
He fpoke this very affeäionately and warmly. I am per- 
fuaded, fays he, had thofe Men lived in the Savage Coun- 
try, whence their Wives came, the Savages would have 
taken more Pains to have brought them to be Idolaters, 
and to worfhip the De vi], than any of thefe Men, fo far 
as I can fee, has taken with them, to teach them the 
Knowledge of the true God, Now» Sir, faid he» tho' 1

do not acknowledge your Religion, or you mine, yet we 
fhould be all glad to fee the DeviFs Servants, and the 
Subjefts of his Kingdom, taught to know the general 
Principlea of the Chriftian Religion ; that they might, at 
leaft, near of God, and of a Redeemer, and of che Re- 
furre&ion, and of a fhturc State, things which we all 
believe ; they had, at leaft, been fo mach nearer Coming 
into the Bofom of the true Church, than they are row 
in the public Profcffion of Idolatry, and Devil-worfhip. 

I could hold no longer; I took him in my Arms, and 
embraced him with an Excefs of Paffion : How far, faid 
I to him, have I been from underflanding the mofl ef- 
fential Part of a Chriftian, viz. to love the Intereft of 
the Chriftian Church, and the good of other Men's Souls? 
I fcarce have known what befongs to being a Chriftian. 
O, Sir, do not fay fo, replied he ; this thing is not your 
Fault. No ! faid I, but why did I never lay it to Heart 
as well as you ? 'Tis not too late yet, faid he, be not 
too Forward to condemn yourfelf. Bot, what can be done 
now ? faid I ; you fee I am going away. Will you give 
me leave, faid he, to talk with thefe poor Men about it ? 
Yes, with all my Heart, faid I ; and will oblige them 
to give Heed to what you fay too. As to that, faid he, 
we maft leave them to the Mercy of Chrift ; but 'tis our 
Bufinefs toaflift them, encourage them, and inftrudt them; 
and, if you will give me Leave, and God his Bleffing, I 
do not doubt but the poor Ignorant Souls (hall be brought 
home into the great Circle of Chriftianity, if not into the 
particular Faith that we all embrace ; and that even 
while you ftay here. Upon this, I faid, I (hall not only 
give you Leave, but give you a thoufand Thanks for it. 
What followed pn this Account I (hall mention alfo again 
in its Place. 

I now prefTed him for the third Article in which we 
were to blame : Why, really, fays he, it is of the fame 
Nature, and 1 will proceed (afking your Leave) with the 
famc Plainnefs as before : It is about your poor Savsges 
yonder, who are (as I may fay) your conquer'dSubjeäs. 
It is a Maxim, Sir, that is, or ought to be received 
ämong all Chriftiäns, of what Church, or pretended 
Church foever ; <viz. That Chriftian Knowledge ought 
to be propagatcd1)y all poffible Means, and on all pof- 
i üble 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 113 

üble Occafions. 'Tis on this Printiple that our Church 
fends Miffioiiariesinto/V/fov India, and China ; and that 
our Clergy, even of the faperior Sort, wHlingly engage 
in the raoft hazardous Voyages, and the moft dangerous 
Refidence among Murderers and ßarbarians, to teach 
them the Knowledge of the true God, and to bring them 
over to embrace the Chriftian Faith. Now, Sir, yoa have 
fuch an Opportun ity here, to have fix or feven-and-thir- 
ty pcor Savages brought over from Idolatry to the Know- 
ledge of God, their Maker and Redeemer, that 1 won 
der how you can pafs fuch an Occafion of doing good ; 
which 28 really worth the Expence of a Man's whole 
Life. 

I was now druck dumb indeed, and had not one Word 
to fay : I had here a Spirit of true Chriftian ZeaJ for 
God and Religion before me, let his particuiar Principles 
be of what kmd foever : As for me, I had not fo much 
as entertaii''d a Thought of this in my Heart before ; 
and, I believe, fhould not have thought of it ; for I 
look'd upon thefe Savages as Slaves, and People, whom, 
had we any Work for them to do, we would have ufcd 
as fuch, or would have bcen glad to have tranfported 
them to any other Part of the World; for our Bufinefs 
was to gvt rid of them ; and we would all have been fa- 
titfied, ifthey had been fentto any Country, fothey had 
never fem their own. fiut to the Cafe : I fay, I was 
confonnded at his Difcourfe, and knew not what Anfwer 
to makc him. He looked earneftly at me, feeing me in 
fome Diforder : Sir, faid he, I fhall be very forry, if what 
I have faid gives-you any Offence : No, no, faid I, I am 
offended with nobody but myfelf ; bat I am perfeäly 
confonnded, not only to think, that I (hould never take 
any Notice of this before, but with refleäing what No- 
tice I am able to take of it now. You know Sir, faid I, 
what Circumftances I am in ; I am bound to the Eaß- 
lndiesy in a Ship freighted by Merchants, and to whom 
it would be an infufferable Piece of Injuftice to detain 
their Ship here, the Men lying all this while at ViAuals 
and Wages upon the Owner's Account : It is true, I a- 
greed to be allowed twelve Days here ; and if I ftay 
more, I xnnft pay 3 /. Sterling per Ditm Demorrage: Nor 
can I flay npoq Demurrage above cigJh&Da^* wxt \ «*&

I bave been here thirteen Daya already ; fo that I am 
perfeäly u nable to engage in thia Work, unlefa I would 
iuffer myfelf to be left behind here again ; in which Cafe, 
if chis fiDglc Ship fhould mifcarry in aay Part of her 
Voyage, 1 fljould be juft in the fame Condition that I 
was left in here at firft; and from which I have been fo 
wonderfully delivered. 

He owned the Cafe was very hard upon me as to tny 
Voyage ; but Jaid it home upon my C onfcience, whether 
the Bleffing of faving fevenand-thirty Souls, was not 
worth my ventoring all I had in the World fbr ? 1 was 
jiot fo feniiblc of that as he was - t and I recurncd upon 
him thus : Why, Sir, it is a valuable thing indeed, to 
be an Inflrument, in God's Hand, to convert feven-and- 
thirty Heathens to the Knowledge of Chrift ; but as you 
are an Ecciefiaftic, and are given over to that Work, fo 
that it feems naturally to fall into the way of your Profef- 
fion, how is it then, that you do not rather offer your- 
fclf to andertake it, than prefs me to it r^ 

Upon this he facM about, juft before me, as he walk- 
ed a!ong, and, pütting me to a füll Scop, made me a 
very low Bow : I rooft heartily thank God, and you, Sir, 
fays he, for gnring ine fo evident a Call to fo blefled a 
Work ; and if you think yöurfclf difchargM from it, 
and deiire me to undertake it, I will moft readily do it, 
and think it a happy Reward for all the Hazards and 
Difficukies of fuch a broken diiappointed Voyage as I 
have met with, that I have dropt at lau into fo glorions 
a Work. 

I difcover'd a kind of Rapture in his Face, whüe he 
fpoke this to me ; his Eyes fparkled like Fire, his Face 

flow'd, and his Colour came and went, as if he had 
een falling into Fits : In a word, he was fired with the 
Joy of being embark'd in fuch a Work. I paufed a con- 
iiderable while, before I conld teil what to fay to him ; 
for I was really fnrprifed to find a Man of fuch Since- 
rity and Zeal, and carried out in his Zeal beyond the 
prdinary Rate of Men, not of his Profeffion only, but 
even of any Profeffion whatfoever : But, after I had con- 
iidered it a while, I afked him ferioufly, if he was in 
earneft, and that he would venture on the fingle Confi- 
deration of an Attempt on thofe poor People„ to be lockM

tip in an unplanted Ifland for, perhaps, his Life ; and, 
ac laß, might not know whether he fliould be able to do 
them any good, or not? 

_ He turn'd (hört lipon me, and afked me, what I call'd 
a Venture : Pray, Sir, faid he, what do you think I con- 
fented to go in your Ship to the Eaß-lndies for ? Nay, 
faid I, that I know not, unlefs it was to preach to the 
lndians. Doubtlefs it was, faid he ; and do you think, 
if 1 can convert thefe feven-and-thirty Men to the Faith 
of Chrift, it is not worth my Time, tho* I (hould never 
be fetch'd off the Ifland again ? Nay, is it not infinirely 
of roore Worth to fave fo many Souls, than my Life is, 
or the Life of twenty more of the fame Profeffion ? Yes, 
Sir, fays he, I would give Chrift and the blefl'ed Virgin 
Thanks all my Days, if I could' he made the leaft happy 
Inflrument of faving the Souls of thefe poor Men, tho* 
I was never to fet my Foot off this Ifland, or fce my na- 
tivc Country any more : But, fince you will honour me, 
fojrs he, with putting me into this Work (for which I 
will pray for you all the Days of my Life) I have one 
bumble Petition to you, faid he, befides. What is that, 
faid I. Why, fays he, it is, that you will leave your Man 
Friday with me, to be my Interpreter to them, and to af- 
fifl me; for, without fome Help, I cannot fpeaktotheni, 
or they to me. 

I was fenfibly troubled at his requefting Friday, becaufe 
I conld not think of parting with him, and that for many 
Reafons ; he had been the Comranion of my Travels ; 
he was not on'v faithful to me, but fwcerely affeelionate 
to the laft Degree ; and I had refolved to do fomething 
confiderable for him, if he outlived me, as it was pro- 
bable he would : Then I knew, that as J had bred Frtday 
up to be a Proteftant, it would quite confound him, to 
bring bim to embrace another ProfeiTion ; and he would 
never, while his Eyes were open, believe that his old 
. Matter was an Heretic, and would be damned $ and this 
might in the End ruin the poor Fellow's Principles, and 
fo turn him back again to his firft ldolatry. 

However, a iudden Thought relieved me in this 
Streight, and it was this j I told him, I could not fay, 
that I was willing ,to part with Friday on any Acco&nt' 
whatever 1 though a Work,, that to hWa v*a& <& w**

Value than bis Life, ought to be to me of mach 
more Value than the keeping or parting with a Ser- 
vant. Buc, on the other hand, I was pcrfuaded, tbat 
Frida} would by no Means confent to part with ine ; 
and then to force him to it, without his Confent, would 
be manifeß Injuftice ; becaufe I had promifed I would 
never put him away ; and he had promifed and engaged 
to me that he would never leave me, unlefs I put bim 
away. 

He feem'd very much conctfnfd at it ; for he had no 
rational Accefs to thefe poor People, feeing he did not 
underftand one Word of their Language, nor they one 
Word of his. To remove this Difficulty, I told him, 
Friday** Father had learned Spant/b 9 which I found he 
alfo underftocd; and he fhould ferve him for an Interpre- 
ter ; fo he was much bettet fatisflcd, and nothing could 
perfuade him but he would ftay to endeavour to convert 
them; but Providence gave another and vcry happy 
Tum to all thi«. 

I come back now to the firft Part of hi» Obje&iöns.. 
When we came to the EngUfljmen^ I fent for them aif 
together ; and after fome Accounts given them of what 
I had done for them, *viz. What neceflary things I had 
providcd for them, and how they were diftributed ; 
which they were fenfible of, and vcry thankful for; 1 
began to talk to them of the fcandalous Life they le<f, 
and gave them a füll Account of the Notice the Clergy- 
man had already taken of it ; and, arguing how unchri- 
fHan and irreligious a Life it was, I firft afked them, rf 
they were married Men or JBatchelors ? They foon ex- 
plained their Condition to me, and fhewed me that two 
•f them were Widowers, and the other three were tingle. 
Men, or Batchelors : I aiked them, With what Confci- 
ence they could take thefe Women, and lie with them, 
as they had done, call them their Wives, and have fo 
many Cbildren by them, and not be married lawfully to 
them ? 

They all gave me the Anfwer that I expecled ; «z/7«. 
That there was nobody to marry them ; that they 
agreed before the Governor to keep them as their Wives ; 
and to keep them, and own them, as their Wives ; and 
they thoüght, as things ftood with them, they were as- 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 117 

legally married as if they had been married by a Parfon, 
and wich all the Formaiities in the World, 

I cold them, That no <3oubt they were married in 
the Sight of God, and were bound in. Confcience to 
keep them as their Wives ; but that the Laws of Mea 
being otherwife, they might pretend they were not mar*- 
ried, and fo defert the poor Women and Children here- 
after ; and that their Wives, being poor defolate Wo* 
men, friendlefs and moneylefs, would have no way to 
help themfelves : I therefore told them, That unlefs I 
was aflur'd of their honeft Intent, I could do nothing 
ifor them ; but would take care, that what I did (hoald 
be for the Women, änd Children, without them ; and • 
that nnlefs they would gi?e fome Aflurances, that they 
would marry the Women, I could not think it was 
convcnient they fhould continae together as Man and 
Wife ; for that it was both fcandalous to Men and of- 
fenüve to God, who they could not think would blefs 
them, if they went on thus. 

All this paffed as I expe&ed ; and they told me, 
«fpecially Will Atkins, who feem'd now to fpeak for the 
reft, That they loved their Wives as well as if they had 
been born in their own native. Country, and would not 
leave them upon any Acconnt whatever ; and they did 
verily believe their Wives were as virtuous, and as modeft, 
and did to the utmoft of their Skill, as much for them, 
and for their Children, as any Women could poflibly do ; 
•and they would not part wich them on any Account : 
And William Atkins, for his own Particular, added, If 
any Man would take him away, and offer to carry him 
home to England, and make him Captain of the bell 
Man of War in the Navy, he would not go with him, if 
he might not carry his Wife and Children wklf him ; 
and if there was a Clergyman in the Ship, he would be 
married to her now, with all his Heart. 

This was juft as I would have it; the Prieft was 
not with ine .at that Moment, but was not far off: 
So, to try him farther, I told him, I had a Clergyman 
with me, and, if he was fincere, I would have him 
married the next Morning ; and bade him confider of 
it, and talk with the reft: He faid, As for himfelf, he 
need not confider of it at all j for he was very tt*bj v* ,

do it, aad was glad I had a Minifter wich me; and 
he behcTcd they wculd be all williog alfo. I then told 
him, That my Friend, the Minifter, was a ¥rencbmem % 
and co«L not fpcak Emgiiß ; but that I would aÄ the 
Clerk bcrwecn them. Hc never fo mach as afked nie 
whcther he was a Papift or Proteftant; which was, 
indecd, what I was afraid of. Bot, 1 fay, they never 
inquired aboat it. So we partcd : I went back to my 
Cirjgjman; and Will. Jtkims went in to talk with bis 
Companions. I defired the Frtncb Gentleman not to 
fajr any thing to them, tili the Bafinefs was thorough 
ripc j *nd 1 told him what Anfwcr the Men had given 
mc. 

Betöre I went frorn their Quarter, they all caroe to 
me, and told me, they had been confidering what 1 had 
iaid ; that they were very glad to hear I had a Clergy- 
man in my Company ; and they were very willing to 
give me the Sausfadion 1 defired, and to be formally 
married as foon as I pleaied ; for they were far from 
defiriog to pait from their Wives ; and that they meant 
nothiog bat what was very honeft, when they chofe 
them: So 1 appointed them to meet me tbe next Mörn~ 
ing ; and that, in tbe mean Time, they (hould let their 
Wives know the Mcaning of the Marriage- Law ; and 
that it was not only to prcvent any Scania! , but alfo 
to oblige them, that they fhould not forfake them, 
whatever might happen. 

The Women were eafily made fenfible of the Mean- 
ing of the thing, and were very well fatisfied with it, 
as, indeed, they had Reafon to be ; fo they failed not 
to attend all together, at my Apartment, the nexc 
Morning, where 1 broaght out my Clergyman : And 
though he had not on a Miniiler's Gown, after the 
manner of England^ or the Habit of a Prieft, afeer the 
manner of Trance ; yet having a black Veft, fomethiog 
Üke a Caflbck, with a Sa(h round it, he did not look 
very unlike a Minifter; and as for his Language, I was 
Interpreter.

the Scruples he made of rnarrying the Women, be- 
caufe they were not baptized, and profefled Chriftians,

was no nced after that to enquire whether he was a 
ryman or no. 

ieed I was afraid his Scruple would have been Car- 
lo far, as that he would not have married them at 
nay, notwithftanding all I was able to Tay to bim, 
fifted me, thoogh modeftly, yet very ßeadily ; and 
i refafed abfolutely to marry them» unlefs he had 
alked with the Men, and the Wonnen too : And 
*h, at firft, I was a Httle backward to it, yet at 
i agreed to it with a good Will, perceiving the 
rity of his Defign. 

hen he came to them, he let them know, that I had 
ünted him with their Circumftances, and with the 
nt Defign : That he was very willing to perform 
Part of his Fundion, and marry them, as I had 
id ; but that, before he could do it, he muft take the 
rty to talk with them : He told them, That in the 
: of all difFerent Men, and in the Senfe of the Laws 
»ciety, they had lived all this while in an open Adul- 

and that it was true, that nothing bat the confent- 

marry, or efFe&ually feparating them from one 
1er now, could put an End to it ; but there was a 
:olty in it too, with refpeft to the Laws of Chriftian 
imony, which he was not fully fatisficd about, vi». 
: of marrying one that is a profeifed Chriftian, to a 
ge, an Idolater, and a Heathen, one that is not bap- 
; and yet that he did not fee, that there was Time 
ör it, to endeavour to perfuade the Women to' be 
zed, or to profefs the Name of Chrift, whom they 
he doubted, heard nothing of, and without which 
cojjld not be baptized. 

e told me, He doubted they were but indifferent 
üians themfelves; that they had but little Know- 
rof God, or his Ways ; and therefore he could not 
ft, that they had faid much to their Wives on that^ 

1 yet.; but that unlefs they would promife him to 
fneir Endeavours with their Wives, to perfuade 

to becorae Chriftians, and wonld as well as they 
1 inftrutt them in the Knowledge and Belief of

Chriftian Religion; atd was, indeed* exprefly foriftd- 
' den in God's Law. '" i 

They heard all this very attentively, ard I delivered 
it very faithfully to them, from his Mouth, as near bis 
owri Words as I could, only fomerimes adding fome- 
thing of my own, to convince them how jaft it was, 
and how J was of Ins Mind : And I always very faitb- 
lully diftingaifhed between what I feid from myfelf, 
and what were the Clergyman's Words. They told 
mc, it was very trae what the Gentleman had faid, 
That they were but very indifferent Chriftiäns them- 
felves, and that they had never talked to their Wires 
aboat Religion : Lord, Sir, fays Witt. At1ans 9 how (honld 
we teacR them Religion ? Why, we know nothing oor- 
felves : And befides, Sir, faid he, fhould we go to talk 
to them of Go<f, and Jefits CbriJI, and Hevuen and Heil, 
'tWould be to make them langh at us; and afk os, Whac 
we betieve onrfelves ? And if we (honld teil them, we 
believe all the things that we fpeak of to them ; fach 
as of good People going to Heaven, and wicked Peo* 
ple to the Devil ; they wonld a(k us, Where we intemled 
to go ourfelves, who believe all thrs, and yet are fach 
wicked Fellows, as we indeed are : Why, Sir, faid WtlK 
*tis enöugh to give them a Surfeit of Religion at firft 
Hearing: Folks muft have fome Religion themfehr«, 
before they pretend to teach other People. Will. Jt- 
kins, faid I to him, tho' I am afraid what yoxi fay 
has toö mach Truth in it, yet can you not teil yonr 
Wife, that (he is in the wrong ? That there is a God, 
and a Religion better than her own ; that her Gods are 
Idols ; that they can reither hear nor fpeak ; that there 
is a great Being that made all things, and that can de- 
ftroy all that he had made ; that he rewards the Good, 
and punifhes the Bad ; that we are to be judged by him, 
at Jaft, for all we do here : You are not fo ignoranr, but 
even Nature itfclf will teach you, that all this is true; 
and I am fatisfy'd you know it all to be true, and be- 
lieve it yourfelf. 

That's true, Sir, faid Atlivs; but with what Face 
can I fay any thing to my Wife of all "this, when fhe 
will teil me immediately, it cannot be true ? 

Not 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 12t 

Not true, faid I, what do you mcan by that f Why, 
Sir, faid he, fhe will teil me it cannot bc true, that this 
.God (I.fhall tellherof) can be juir, or can panifh, or 
reward, Tmce I. am not.puniihed, and iet:t to the Dc/iJ, 
that have been fuch a -.vicked Creacure as ihe knows l 
have begn, even to her, and to every Body eile ; and 
that I fhould be fuffer'd to live, that have been alwavs 
ac*ling fo contrary to what I muß teil her is good, and 
to what I ought to have done. 

Why truly, Atkins, faid I, I am afraid thou fpeakeft 
too much Truth ; and with that I let the Clergyman 
know what Atkins had faid ; for he was impatient to 
know : O ! faid the Prieft, Teil him there is one thing. 
will make him the bell Minüier in ihe World to his Wife ; 
and that is Repentance ; for none teach Repentance like 
true Fenitents : He wants nothing, but to repent ; and 
then he will be fo much the better qaalined to inftruft 
his. Wife; he will then be able to teil her, thatTtherc is not 
onJy a God, and that he is the juil Rewarder of Good 
and Evil; but that he is a merciful Being, and, with in- 
finite Goodnefs and Long -fuffering, forbears to punifh thofe 
that offendi waiting to be gracious, and willing not the 
Death of a Sinner, but rat her that he fhould return and 
live; that he often Alfters wicked Men to go on a long 
Time, and eve.n referves Damnation to the general Day 
of Retribution : That it is a clear Evidence of God, and 
of a future State, that righteous Men receive not their 
Reward, or wicked Men their Puniihment, tili they come 
into another World; andthis will lead him to teach his 
Wife the Doclrine of the Refurreclion, and of the laß 
Judgment : Let him but repent for himfelf, he will be an 
excellent Preacher of Repentance to his Wife. 

I repeated all this to Atkins> who look'd very ferious 
all the while, and who, we could eaiily pereeive, was 
more than ordinarily affecled with it : When being ea- 
ger, and hardly fuffering me to make an End, I knew all 
this, Mafter, fays he, and a great deal more ; but I han't 
the Impudence to talk thus to my Wife ; when God, 
and my own Confcience knows, and my Wife will be 
an undeniable Evidence againfl me, that I have liv'd as 
jf 1 had never heard of a God, or a future State, or any 
thing about it : And to talk of my repenüng, alas (aud

it ! Atkivs, faid I, What dort thou mean by that ? I know 
well enough what 1 mean, Sir, fays he ; I mean 'tis to» 
late ; and that is too true. 

J told my Clergyman, Word for Word, what he faid j 
the poor zcaloas Prieft (I rauft call him fo ; for be hii 
Opinion what it will, he had certainly a moft finguUr 
Affcäion for the Good of other Mens Souls ; and it 
would be hard to diink he had not the like for his own; 
I fny, this zealous affedicmate Man) could not refraia 
Tears alfo: ßur, recovering himfelf, he faid to me, Aöc 
him but one Queftion, Is he eafy, that it is too latc, or is 
he troubled, and wi fh.es it were not fo ? I patthe Qoeftk» 
fairly to Atkins ; and heanfwer'd with agrcatdeal of Paf- 
fion, How could any Man be eafy in a Condition taat 
ccnainly maft end in eternal Deftroclion? That he w» 
far from being eafy; but that, on the contrary, he be- 
Hcvcd it would one Time or other ruin htm. 

What do you tnean by that ? faid I. Why, he faid, 
he believed he (hould* one Time or another, cut his <W0 
Throat to pat an End to the Terror of it. 

The Clergyman fhook his Head, with a great Cm- 
cern in his Face, when I told him all ihis ; but. turoiag 
quick to me upon it, faid, If that be his Cafe, yon »ajr 
aiTure him, ic is not too late; Chrift will give him Re- 
pentance : But pray, fays he, explain this to him, Thit 
äs no Man is faved but by Chrift, and the Merit of bis 
Paffion, procuring divine Mercy for him, how can it 
be too late for any Man to receive Mercy ? Does he

when provoked Mercy will no longer ftrive, and when 
God may refufe to hear ; but that Ws never too late for

I told Atkins all this, and he heard me with great 

Earneftnefß ; but it feem'd as if he turn'd off the Dif- 

courfe to the reft; for he faid to me, he would go and 

have fome Talk with his Wife ; So he went out awhile,

amd we talk'd to die reft. I perceived they wcre all flu; 
pidly ignorant, as to Matters of Religion ; much as 1 vvaj 
ivhen I went rambling away from my Fächer ; and yet 
that there were none of them backward to be&r vvhat had 
becn faid ; and all of them fsrioufly promis'd, that they 
wouJd talk with their Wives about it, and to do cheir En- 
deavour to perfuade them to turn Chrißians. 

The Clergyraan fraird upon ine» whea T reported 
what Anfwer they gave, but faid nothiog a good while j 
but, at Jaft.making bis Head, W* that are Chrift's Scr- 
vants, {ays he, can go no further than to exhort and in« 
ftruft ; and whea Men comply, fubmit to tbe R^proof, 
and promife what we afk, *cis all we .can do ; we are 
bound to accept their good Words : But, believe me, 
Sir, faid he, whatever you may have known of the Life 
ofthat Man you call Wiliiam Attivs, I öiljeve he is th* 
only fincere Convert among them ; I take that Man t) * 
be a true Pcnitcnt ; I won't dsfyair of thc re;t ; but that 
Man is perfc£lly £ruck with tbe Ssnfe of his paft Life ; 
and I doubt not, bat whcn hecojxvcs to talk Religion to 
his Wife, he will talk him/elf effeäually into it ; for ar- 
tempting to teach others, is fometimes the beft.Way of 
teaching onrfelves. I knew a Man, added he, who, hnv- 
ing nothing but a fumnxary Notion of Religion himfelf, 
and being wicked and profligate, to the Uli Dcgree, in his 
Life, made a thorough Reforniation in himfelf, by labour- 
ing to convert a Je-iv ; And if that poor Atkins begias but 
once totalk ferioufly of JefusChrift to his Wife, my Life 
for it, he talks himfelf into a thorough Convert, malt es 
himfelf a Penitent: And who knows what may follow ? 

Upon this Difcourfe however, and their proinifing, 
bs above, to endeavour to perfuade their Wives to em- 
braceChriftianity, he married the other three Couple ; 
but Will. Atkins and his Wife were not yet come in : 
Afier this my Ciergyman, Avairing awhile, was curious 
to know where Atkins was gone ; and, turning to me, 
fays he, I intreat you, Sir, Jet us walk ouc of your 
Labyrinth here, and look ; I dare fay, we ßiall find this 
poor Man, fomewhere or other, talking ferioufly wich 
bis Wife, and teaching her already fomething of Reli- 
gion. I began to be of the fame Mind : So we went 
outtogether; and I carried him a Way which nons

knew but myfelf, and whcre the Trees wcrc fo thick 
fer, £s that it was not eafy to feethrough theThkkct of 
Leaves, and far harderto fee in, than to fee out : Whcn 
coir.ing to the Edge of the Wood, I faw Jtkins % and 
his tawny Savage Wife, fitting under the Suade of a 
Bußi, very eager in Difcourfe; I ftopp'd (hört, tili my 
Clcgyiuan came up to me ; and then, having fhewed 
him where they wcre, we ltood and look'd very üeadiiy 
at t.-.em a good while. 

Wc obferv'd him very earncft with her, pointing ap to 
the Sun, and to every Quart er of the Heavens ; then dowa 
to the Earth, then out to the Sea, then to himfelf, then to 
her, to the Woods, to the Trees. Now, fays my Clcrgy- 
man, you fee my Word sa rem 3de good; the Man preachei 
to her; mark him, now he is telling her, that our God 
has made him, and her, and the Heavens, the Earth, the 
Sea, the Woods, the Trees, tstc. 1 believe he is, faid I : 
Immediately we pereeived lVi!L Atkim ftart up upon his 
Feet, fall down upon his Knees, anu lift up both his 
Hands : We fuppofe he faid fomething, but we could not 
hear him ; it was too far for that : He did not continue 
kneeüng half a Minute, but com es and fits down again 
by his Wife, and talks to her again. We perceiv'd then 
theWoman very attentive, but whether fhe faid any thing 
or no, we could not teil. While the poor Fellow was upon 
his Knees, I could fee the Tears run plentifully down 
my Clergyman's Cheeks ; and I could hardly forbear 
myfelf; but it was agreat Affliclion to us both, that we 
were not near enough to hear any thing that pailed bc- 
twecn them. 

Well, however, we could come no nearer, for fear 
of diilurbing them : So we refolved to fee an Er.d of 
this Piece or flill Converfation ; and it fpoke loud enough 
to us, without the Help of Voice : He fat down again, 
as I have faid,clofe by her, and talk'd again earneftly to 
her ; and two or three Times we could fee him embrace 
her paffionately ; another Time we faw him take out his 
Handkerchief, and wipe her Eyes, and then kifs her 
again, with aKrnd of Tranfport very unufual : And af- 
ter feveral of thefe thtngs, we faw him on a fudden jump 
op again, and lend her his Hand to help her up, when 
immediately leading her by the Hand, a Step or two,

they both kneel'd down together, and continu'd fo about 
two Minutes. 

My Friend could hear it no longer, but cries out aloud-, 
St. Paul, St. Paul ! hebold he prayeth : 1 was afraid dtkin» 
would hear him; therefore I intreated him to with hold 
himfelf awhile, that we might fee an End of the Scene, 
whichta me, I multconfefs, was the moft affe&ing, and 
yet the moft agreeable, that ever I faw in my Life. Well, 
he ftrove with himfelf, and contain'd himfelf for awhile, 
bot was in fuch Raptures of joy, to think that the poor 
Heathen/Woman was become a Chriftian, that he was 
not able to cootain himfelf; he wept feveral Times ; 
then throwing up his Hands, and crofling his ßreaft, faid 
over feveral things ejaculatory, and by Way cf gtving 
God Tbanks for fo miraculous aTeflimony of the Suc- 
cefs of our Endeavours ; fome he fpoke foftly, and I 
could not well hear; others audibly, fome in Laiin, iome 
in Frencb-y then two orthree Times the Tears of Joy 
would Interrupt him, that he could not fpeak at all. 
Bat I begg'd, that he would compofe himfelf, and let 
us more narrowly and fully obferve what was before us, 
which he did for a Time, and the Scene was not endcd 
Jthere yet : For, after the poor Man and his Wife were 
lifen again Yrom their Knees, we obferved he flood talk- 
ing flill eagerly to her ; and we obferved by her Mo- 
tion, that (he was greatly afFecled with v/hat he faid, by 
her frequent lifting up her Hands, laying her Hand to 
her Breaft, and fuch other Poilures, as ufually exprefa 
the greateft Serioufnefs and Attention : This continued 
about half a Quarter of an Hour, and *Len they walk- 
ed away too ; fo that we could fee no more of them in 
that Situation. 

I took. this Interval to talk with my Clergyman ; and 
firft, I told htm, I was glad to fee the Particulars we 
Jiad both becn Wit nettes to ; that though I was hard 
enough of Belief in fuch Cafes, yet that I began to 
think.it was all very iincere here, both in the Man and 
his Wife, however Ignorant they might both be ; and I 
hojped fuch a Beginning would have yet a more happy

Religion is natarally commur.icative; and he thati^onrt 
made a Chriitian, will never leave a Pagan behind aita, 
if he can help it. I own'd, it was a moft Chrißian Prltz- 
ciple to think fo, and a Teftimony of a true Zcal, il

But how does this comfort you, while thefe People are,in

wichout which you believe there is no Salvation ; fo that 
you eßeem thefe butHeretics ftill; and for other Reafoflt,

To this he an.'wered with A-b und ante of Candour,

rejoice thereibre, when I fee thi^poor Man, who, you 
üy, has bcen aProftigate, and almolt a Murderer, kncei 
down and pray to Jefus Chrilt, as we fuppofe he did, 
though not fuUy enlighten'd ; believing that God, from 
whom every fach Work procecds, will fenfibly touch his 
Heart, and bring him to the furche r Knowledge of the 
Trnth in bis own Time ; and if God fhall influence this 
soor Man to convert and inftruä the Ignorant Savage his

jnay not be brougbt quiie Home into the Bofom of the

leaving it to the Goodnefs of Chrift to perfekt his Work 
in bis own Tiroc, and his own Way ? Certainly I would 
rejoiee, if all the Savages in America were brought, like 
this poor Woman, to pray to God, though they were to 
be all Proteftants at firft, rather than they (bould continue 
Pagans and Heathens; fimily believing that he who had 
befiowed that firft Light upon them, would farther illu- 
jmnate them with a Bcam of his heavenly Grace, and 
bring them into the Pale of his Church, when be fhould 
fee good. 

I was aftonifhed at the Sincerity and Temper of this 
troly pious Papift, as mueb as I was öppreffrd by the 
Power of bis Reafoning : And it prefen'Jy oecurred to 
my Thoughts, that if fuch a Temper was univerfal, we - 
might be all Catholic ChritHans, whatever Church» or 
parcicular Profeffion, we joined to, or joined in ; that a 
Spirit of Charity would foon Work us all up into right 
Principles; and, in aWord, as he thought, that the like

Wdl, as Will. Atkim and bis Wife werc gone, oor

if we fliould difcover to him, that we had feen him ander

but that we fhould talk to him firft, and hear what he 
would fiy to us : So we called him in alone, nobody 
being in the Place but ourfelves ; and I began with him 
thus : 

Will. Atkim, faid I, prithee what Education had yoo ? 
What was your Father ? 

W. A. A berter Man than ever I fhall be. Sir, my 
Father was a Clergyman.

R. C. Well, I did not alle you about your Father, to 
extort this Confeffion ; I pray God give you Repentance 
for it, and forgive you that, and all your other Sins ; 
but I aiked you,. becaufe I fee, that though you have 
not much Learning, yet you are not fo Ignorant as Tome 
are, in things that are good ; that you have known mora 
of Religion a great deal than you practifed. 

W. d. Though you, Sir, did not extort the Confeffion 
that I.make about my Father, Coufcience does ; and 
whenever we come to look back upon our Lives, the 
Sins againft our indulgent Parents are certainly the firft 
that touch us ; the Wounds they make, lie deepeft ; and 
the Weight they leave, will lie heavieft upon the Mind* 
of all the Sins we can com mit.

tifi? he could not underftand her. Howevcr he tunn'd 
himfelf to me, and told me, that he believed there rauft 
jbe more to do with this Woman than to marry her : I 
did not underftand him at firft, bot at length he explained 
himfelf; <vi%. That fhe ought to be baptiz'd. 

J agreed with him in that Part readily, and was for 
.going about it prefently : No, no ; hold Sir, faid he, 
though I would have her baptiz'd by all Means, yet I 
muft obferve, That Will, dtkws, her Hufband, has, in* 
deed, brought her in a wonderful ra anner to be willing 
to embrace a religious Life ; and has given her juft Ideas 
of the Being of ä God, of bis Power, Juftice, and Mercy ; 
yet I defire to know of him, if he has faid any thing 
to her of Jefus Chrift, and of the Salvation of Sinners j 
of the Nature of Faith in him, and the Redemption by 
him ; of the Holy Spirit, the Rcfurre&ion, the laft Judg- 
ment, and a future State. 

I called Will. Atkins again, and afked him ; but the 
roor Fei low feil immediately into Tears, and told us, 
He had faid fomething to her of all thofe things, but 
that he was himfelf fo wicked a Creature, and his own 
Confcience fo reproached him with his horrid ungooiy 
Life, that he trembled at the Apprehenfions, that her 
Knowledge of him (hould leflen the Attention ihe ßiould 
give to thofe things, and make her rather contemn 
Religion, than receive it: But he was aflured, he faid, 
that her Mind was fo difpofed to receive due Imprcf- 
fions of all thofe things, that if I would but difcourfe 
with her, (he would make* it appear to my Satisfadion, 
that my Labour would not be loft upon her. 

Accordingly I called her in, and, placing myfelf as In- 
terpreter between my religious Prieit and the Woman, 
I intreated him to begin with her ; but füre fuch a Ser- 
mon was never pfeached by a Popifti Prieft in thefe latter 
Ages of the World ; and, as I told him, I thought he had 
all the Zeal, all the Knowledge, all the Sincerity of a 
Chriftian, withoutthe Errors of a Roman Catbolic; and that 
I took him to be fuch a Clergyman, as the Roman Bilhops 
were, before the Church of Rome afiumed fpiritual So>- 
vereignity over the Confciences of Men. 

In a word, he brought the poor Woman to embrace 
the Knowledge of Chrift, and of Redemnüan ^ Vcwc& %

When.he was preparing to baptizehtr, Lintreated him, 
that he would poiform that Office with fome Caotioir, 
that the Man mighc not pcrcoive he was of the Rosmg 
Church, if paffible; becaufe of other ill Gonfequecces 
which mighr attend a DifFcrence among as in chac very 
Religion, which we were inftrofting the other in. He toid 
ne, That as he had no confecratud Chapel, nor proper 
things for the Office, I fliould fee he would du itina 
manner, that I fhquld not know by it, that he was a Ro- 
ma» Catba/ic, myfelf, if I had not known k bcfore:. Aod 
fo he did ; for, faying only fome Words over to himfeif in 
Latin, which I could not und er Rand, he poar'd a wholc 
•Diih füll of Water upon the Wo man 's Hcad, pronounc- 
ing in Fratcb very loud, MJR1T; which was the Name her 
Hufband dciired me to give her, for 1 was her Goctfa*

diclion afrerwards in Latin ; but either IFUL Jtkins&A 
not know but it was in Frencb, or elfe did not take norice 
of it at that Time. 

As foon as this was over, he married them ; and af- 
ter the Marriage was over, he turned himfeif to Will. 
Jtkinst and in a very affeclionate manner exhorted him, 
not only to perfevere in that good Difpoütion he was. in, 
•but to fupport the Convidions that were upon him, by 
a Refolution to reform his Life; told him, k was in 
vain to fay he repented, if he did not forfake his-Crimea; 
reprefented to him, how God had honoured him with 
being the Inftrument of bringing his Wife to the Know-

carcful he did not dimonour the Grace of God ; and that, 
if he did, he would fee the Hcathen a better Chriftian

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 139 

Qoodnefs, gaVe tham the Benedi&ion agsin, I repeating 
€very thing co thcm in Engliß: And thus ended the Ce« 
nemony. I think it was the moft pleafant agreeablt Da/ 
tt> ma that ever I psfled in my whol« Life. 

Büt my Clergyman had not döne yet ; his Thought» 
hang continually upon the Converfion of the 37 Savages; 
*nd fain he would have ftaid upon the Ifland to hava 
«üdertaken it; bot I convinced him, Ptrß, That his Un- 
dcrtaking. was itapra&icable in itfelf ; and 7^, That» 
perhaps, I would put it intö aWay of being done, in his 
Abfence, to his Satisfaftion ; of which by-and-by. 

Having thasF bfought the AflP&ir of the Ifland to a nar* 
low "Compafs, I Was praparing to go on bbard the Ship» 
whentheyoung Man, whom I had taken out of the 
JamiuYd Snip's Company, came to nie, and told me, He 
inderftood I had a Clergyman wich nie ; and that I had 
caufed the Englijbmen to be married to the Savages* 
whom thcy called Wives; that he had a Match too, 
which he defired might be finifhed before I went, be- 
tween two Chriftians ; which, he hoped, would not be 
difagrecable to me. 

I knew this muft be the young Woman who was his 
Mother's Servant, fbr there was no other Chriflian Wo- 
man on the lfland ; fo I began to per fu ade him not to do 
ftny thing ofthat kind rafhly, or becaufe he found him- 
fclf in this folitary Circumftarcc: I reprefented, that he 
had fome confiderable Subltance in ihe World, and gcod 
Friends, as 1 underftood by himfelf, and by his Maid 
aifo; that the Maid was not only poor, and a Servant, 
fent was unequal to him, (he being 26 or 27 Years old, 
and he not above 1 7 or 1 $ ; that he might, very pro- 
bably, with my Affifrance, make a Remove from this 
Wildernefs, and come into his own Country again ; and 
Chat then it would be a rhoufand to one but he would 
fepent his Choice ; and the Diflike of that Circumftance 
Äight be difadvantageous to both. I was going to fay 
jnore, but he interrupted me, fmiHng ; and told me, 
with a great deal of Modefty, that I roiftook in my 
GuefTes ; that he had nothing ofthat kind in his Thoughts-, 
his prefent Cifcumftances being melanchoiy and difcon- 
frtlate enoügfi; and he was very glad to hear, that J had 
fhoughts of putting them m * W*y tb fefc \Yäw w«v

Country again ; and that nothing fhould have (et hin» 
upon ftaying there, buc chat the Voyage I was going was- 
ib exceeding long and hazardous, and would carry him 
quite out of the Reach of all his Friends ; that he had 
nothing to deüre of me, bot that I would fettle him in 
fome litrle Property in the Ifland where he was ; give 
him a Servant or two, and fome few Necefiaries, and 
he would fettle himfelf Jiere like a Planter, waiting the 
good Time whien, if ever I returned to England, I would 
redeem him, and hoped I would not be unmindful of 
him when I came to England ; that he would give me 
fome Letters to his Friends in London, to let them know 
how good I had been to him, and what Part of the 
World, and what Circumftances I had left him in : And 
he promifed me, that wheneycr I redeemed him, the 
Plantation, and all the Improvements he had made upoa 
it, let the Value be what it would, fhould be wholly mine. 

His Difcourfe was very prettily delivercd, confidering 
his Youth ; and was the more agrecable to me, becaufc 
he told me pofkively the Match was not for himfelf» 
I gave him all poifible Afiurances, that, if I lived to 
come fafe to England, I would deliver his Letters, and 
do his Bufinefs effedually ; and that he might depend i 
would never forget the Circumftances I left him in ; bat 
fhll I was impatient to know who was the Perfon to be 
married : Upon which he told me,. it was my Jack of all 
Trades, and his Maid Su/an. 

I was molt agreeably furprifed when he named tht 
Match; for, indeed, I had thought it very fuitable. 
The Charaäer of that Man I have given already ; and 
as for the Maid, fhe was a very honeft, modeft, fober, 
and religious young Woman ; had a very good Share of 
Senfe ; was agreeable enough in her Perfon ; fpoke very 
handfomely, and to the Purpofe ; always with Decency 
and good Manners, and not backward to fpeak, when 
any thing required it, or impertinently for ward to fpeak 
when it was not her Bufinefs ; very handy and houfe- 
wifely in any thing that was before her ; an excellent 
Manager, and fit indeed to have been Governefs to the 
whole Ifland ; fhe knew very well how to behave her- 
felf to all kind of Folks fhe had about her, and to better, 
if fhe had found any there. 

The 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 141 

: The Match belüg propofed in this Männer, we mar- 
xied ehern the fame Day ; and, as I was Father at the 
Altar, as I may &y, and gave her away, fo I gave her 
a Portion 5 for I appointed her and her Hufband a hand- 
fome large Space of Gronnd for their Plantation ; and, 
indeed, this Match, arid the Propofel the young Gentle- 
man made to me, to give him a fmall Property in the 
Jiland, put me opon parcelling it out among them, that 
Chey might not quarrel afterwards about their Situation. 

This marine out the Land to them I left to WilL At- 
iins> who, indeed, was now grown a moit (ober, grave, 
managing Fellow ? perfeäly reformed, exceeding pious 
and religious ; and, as far as I may be allowed to (peak 
pofitively in fach a Cafe, I verily believe, was a true, 
iincere Penitent. 

He divided things fo juftly, and fo much to every 
one's Satisfa&ion, that they only defired one general 
Writing ander my Hand for the whole ; which I caofed 
to be drawn up, and figned and fealed to them, fetting 
out the Bounds and Situation of every Man's Planta- 
tion, and teftirying, that I gave them thereby, feveral- 
ly, a Right to the whole PofTeflion and Inheritance of 
the refpe&ive Plantations or Farms, with their Improve- 
ments, to them and their Heirs ; referving all the reit 
of the Iiland as my own Property, and a certain Rent 
for every particular Plantatiori, after eleven Years, if I 
or any one from me, or in my Name, came to demand 
it, producing an atteßed Copy of the fame Writing. 
' As to the Government and Laws among them, I told 
them, I was not capable of giving them better Rulea 
than they were able to give themfelves ; only made 
them promife me, to live in Love and good Neighbour- 
hood with one another : And fo I prepared to leave 
them. 

One thing I muft not omit ; and that is, that being 
now fettled in a kind of Commonwealth among them- 
felves, and having much Bufinefs in Hand, it was but 
odd to have feven-and-thirty Indium live in a Nook of 
the Iiland, independent, and, indeed, unemployed ; for, 
excepting the providing themfelves Food, which they had 
Difficulty enough in too, fometimes, they had no man- 
ner of Bufinefs or Property to manage; I proooa'd th&t*- 



14* The'Lift mti ADyiNTüiE« ^ 

Jbre tothe Governor SpamarJ, that he fhould go to taea 
with Friday'% Färber, and propofe to them to ranote* 
and either plant for thenfclves, or take them into thek 
fevcral Familie* as Serrants, to bc matntained for thek 
Latour, but witbout being abioiote Slaves ; for I wouli 
not ad mit them to make them Slaves by Force» by aay 
meani, becaufe they had tbeir Liberty given by Capitu- 
Ittion, and, as it wtre, Articlc* .of Surrender, whick 
they ought not to break. 

They moft willingiy embraced tfae Propofal, and came 
all very chearful along with him ; fo we allotted them 
Land, and Plantatioas, which three or foor acccptcd of, 
bat all the reft chofe to be employed as Servonu in the 
fareral Familie« we iiad fettled ; and thus my Colony wat 
in a manner fettled, as follows : The Spaniards potiefied 
my original Habitation, which was the capital City, and 
extended their Plantation all along the Side of the Brook, 
which aiade the Creek rhu I have fo often de&ribed, as 
far as my ftower; and as they increafed their Cuhort, 
it wert always Eaftward ; the EngUJb lived in the North- 
Esft Part, wheneJPWf. Atkim nid his Comradta began, 
and oa«e on South ward, and South Weib, towards the 
back Part of the Spaniar/s ; and «very Plantation had a 
great Addition of Land to takc m, if they foond Octa- 
don ; fo that they need not jofüe oae aaotker for waot 
of Room. 

All the Wettend of the löand was left irainhabited, 
that if any of the Savages (houkl come on Shore the«, 
only for their oAial cußomary Barbarities, they otight 
cwne and go; if they difturbed nobody, nobody would 
difburb them ; and 110 doubt but they were oftcn «.(höre, 
and went away again ; for I acver heard, that the Plant- 
ar* were ever attacked and difturbed arvy morc. 

It now came into my Thoughts, that l had hinted to 
my Friend theClergynaan, that the Work of Converting 
the S avages mit» ht, perhaps, be fet on foot in his Ab- 
fence, to his Satisfaclion : And I tokl him, tbatnowl 
thooght it was put in a fair Way ; for the Sa vages beiag 
thus divided amoj&g the Chriftians, if they would bot 
every one of them do their Part with thofe which came 
under their Hands, I hop ed it roight have a very good 
EfFeü.

He agreed prefently in that, if, faid he, they will d* 
their Part ; but how, üljb he, lhall we obtain that of 
them ? I told him, we could call them all together, 
and leave it in Charge with them, or go to them one 
by one, which he thought bell ; fo we divided it ; he 
to fpeak to the Sfmxiardt, wbo were all Papifts ; and j 
to the Englißiy who wcre all Proteftants ; and we recom* 
wended it earnefily to them, and made them promife* 
that they would aever make any Diftinclion of Papift 
or Prote&ant, in their exhorting the Savages to turn 
Chriitians ; but teach them the general Knowledge of 
the true God, and of their Saviour Jefus Chrift ; and 
they likewife promifed us, that they would aever have 
any DifFerences or Difputes, one with another, about 
Religion ■ 

When I came to Will. Atkins\ Hou r e (I may call it fo t 
ior fach a Houfe, or foch a Piece of EaJket-work, I be* 
lieve, was not ftanding in the World again ! I fay, when 
J came thither) I foand the young Woman J have men- 
tioned above, and IVilUtm Atlunss Wife, were become 
Intimate* \ and this prüden*, reltgions, youog Woman, 
had perfc&ed the Work Will. Atkins had begun; and 
thoagh it was . not above four Days after what I have 
related, yet the fcew-baptized Savage Woman was made 
«fuch a Chriftian, as X have' feldom heard of any like 
her, in all tny Observation, or Converfation in the 
World. 

It came next into my Mind, in the Morning, before I 
ivent to them, that among all the needful things I had 
to leave with them, I had not left a Bible ; in which I 
ihewed myfdf Jefs confiderfug fbr them, than my good 
Ffiend the Widow was for me, when (he fent sie tha 
Cargo of 100 /. from Lijbon, where fhe packed up three 
Bibles and a Prayer.ßook. However, the good Woman's 
Charity had a greater Extent than ever ihe imagined ; 
for they were referved for the Com fort and Inftru&ion 
of thofe that made much better Ufe of them than I had 
done. 

I took one of the Bibles in my Pocket, and when 
I came to William Atkini* Tent or Houfe, I found 
the youog Woman, and Atkim\ baptized Wife, had 
bcen difcourfing of Religion together j (for William At-

thcy were together now ? * and he faid, Ves ; fo I went 
into the Houfe, and he with me, and we found them 
together very earneft in Difcoorfe : O, Sir, fays William 
Atkins> when God has Sinners to reconcile to himfelf, 
and Aliens to bring Home, he never wants a MefTen- 
ger: My Wife has got a new Inftruftor ; I knew I 
was unworthy, as I was uncapable of that Work ; that 
young Woman has been fent hither from Heaven ; fhe 
is enough to convert a whole Jfland of Savages. The 
young Woman blufhed, and rofe up to go away, bat 
I deiired her to fit Hill ; I told her fhe had a eood 
Work upon her Hands, and I hoped God would blefs 
her in it. 

We talked a little, and I did not perceive they had 
any Book among them, though I did not afk ; but I put 
my Hand in my Pocket, and pulied out my Bible ; Here, 
faid I to Atkinsy I have brought you an Alfiftant, that, 
perhaps, you had not before. The Man was fo con- 
founded, that he was not able to fpeak for fome Time; 
but, recovering himfelf, he takes it with both his Hands, 
and, turning to his Wife ; Here, my Dear, fays be, 
did not I teil you, our God, though he lives above, 
could hear whatwe faid ? Here is theitoolc I prayed for, 
when you and I kneel'd down under the Bufh ; now 
God has heard us and fent it. When he had faid thus, 
the Man feil into fuch Tranfports of a paflionate Joy, 
that between the Joy of having it, and giving God 
Thanks for it, the Tears tan down his Face like a Child 
that was crying. 

The Woman was furprifed, and was like to hare 
run into a Miftake, that none of us were aware of; 
for (he firmly believed God had fent the Book upon her 
Hufband's Petition : It is true, that providentially it 
was fo, and might be taken fo in a confequent Senfe ; 
bqt I believed it would have been no difficult Matter, at 
that Time, to have perfuaded the poor Woman to have 
believed, that an exprefs Meflenger came from Heaven, 
on purpofe to bring that individual Book ; but it was 
too ferious a Matter, to fufFer any Delufion to take 
place : So I turned to the young Woman, and told 
her, We did not defire to impofe upon the new Con- 
vert,

vcrt, in her firft, and raore ignorant underftanding of 
things ; and begged her to explain to her, that God 
may be very properly faid to anfwer our Petitions, when 
in die Courfe of his Providence, fuch things are, in a 
particular Manner, broughtto pafs, as we petition'd for; 
but we do not expedl Returns from Heaven, in a mira- 
raculous and particular Manner ; and that it is our Mer- 
cy it is not fo. 

This the young Wbman did afterward s effe&ually ; fo 
that there was, I aflure you, no Prieftcraft ufed here ; 
and I fhould have thought it one of the moft unjuftifiable 
Frauds in the World, to have had it fo ; but the Sur- 
prife of Joy upon Will. Atktm y is really not to be ex- 
preßed ; and there, we may be ftfre, was no Delufion : 
Sure no Man was ever morc thankful in the World for 
any thing of its kind, than he was for this Bible 1 and, 
I beüeve, never any Man was glad of a Bible from a 
better Principle ; and though he had been a moft profli- 
gate Creature, defperate, headftrong, outrageous, furi« 
ous, and wicked, to a great Degree ; yet this Man is a 
ftanding Rule to us all for the well inftrufting Childrcn ; 
nrix. that Parents fhould never give over to teafch and 
inftrucl, or ever defpair of the Succefs of their Endea- 
Vours, let the Children be ever fo obftinate, refra&ory, 
or, to Appearance, infenfible of Inflru&ion ; for, if ever 
God in his Providence touches the Confciences of fuch, 
the Force of their Education returns upon them, and the 
early Inftrußion of Parents is not loft, tho' it may have 
been many Years laid afleep ; but, fome Time or other, 
. they may find the Benefit of it. 

Thus it was with this poor Man, however Ignorant he 
was, or divefted of Religion and Chriftian Knowledge. 
He found he had fome to do with now more ignorant 
than himfelf ; and that the leait Part of the Inftruftioa 
öf Tiis good Father, that could now come to his Mind, 
was of U«"e to him. 

Among the reft it oecurred to him, he faid, how his 
Father ufed to infift much upon the inexpreffible Value 
of the Bible; the Privilege and Blcifing of it to Nations, 
Families, and Perfons ; but he never entertained the 
leaft Notion of the Worth of it tili now j when, being

with Chiid. 1 took another Draught or Water, with Su- 
gar in ü, but my Scomach loathcd the Sugar, and brocght 
i: all up again : Then I Cook a Draught of Water with- 
out Sugar, and that flayed with me ; and laid me down 
upon che ßcd, praying moft heartily, that it would pleafe 
God to takc me away ; and compofing my Mind in Hopes 
of it, I flumbered awhile ; and then waking, thought my- 
feh dying, being iight with Vapours from an empty Sto- 
xnach, I recommended my Soul to God, and earncftljr 
wifhed, that fomebody would throw me into the Sea. 

All this while my Miftrefs lay by me, juft, as I 
thouuht, expiring ; but bore it with mach more Patience 
than I, and gave the lall Bit of Brcad (he had to her 
Child, my young Malier, who would not have taken it, 
but {he obliged him to eat it ; and, I believe, it fared 
his Life. 

Towards the Morning, I flept *gain ; and ürfk t wheo 
I awaked, 1 feil into a violent Paluon of Crying ; and, 
after that, had a fecond Fit of violent Hunger, fo that 
I got up ravenoui, and in a moft dreadful Condition : 
Had my Miftrefs been dt ad, as much as I loved her, I 
am certain, I fhould have eaten a Piece of her Flefli with 
sl3 much RcliiTi, and as unconcerned, as ever I did the 
Flcfh of any Creature appointed for Food ; and, once 
or twice, l was going to bite my own Arm. At lad, 
1 faw the Bafon, in which was the Blood I had bled at 
my Nofe the Day before ; I ran to it, and fwaüowed it 
with fuch Hafte, and fuch a greedy Appetite, as if I had 
wor.clercd nobody had taken it before, and afraid it 
fhould be taken from me now. 

Thongh after it was down, the Thoughts of it filled 
me with Horror, yet it checked the Fit of Hunger; and 
I drank a Diaught of fair Water, and was compofed and 
refrefhed for fome Hours after it. This was the fourth 
Day, and thus I held it tili towards Night, when, within 
the Compafs of thrce Hours, I had all thefe feveral Cir- 
cumftances over again, one after another ; m. fiele, 
fleepy, eagerly hungry, Pain in the Stomach, then ra- 
venous again, then fick agsin, then lunatic, then crying, 
then ravenous again, and fo every Quarter of an Hour; 
snä my Strength watled excecdingly. At Night I laid 

me 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 140 

me down, having no Comfort, but in the Hope that I 
lhould die before Morning. 

All this Night I had no Sleep, but the Hunger was now 
turned into a Difeafe; and I had a terrible Cholic and 
Griping; Wind, inftead of Foöd, having fbund its Way 
into the Bowels ; and in this Condition J lay tili Morning, 
when I was furprifed a litcle with the Cries and Lamcu- 
tations of my young Mailer, who callcd out to me, thac 
bis Mother was dead. I lifted rnyfelf up a little, for I 
had not Strength to rife, but fbund fhe was not dead, tho' 
fiie was able to give very little Signs of Life. 

I had then fuch Convullions in my Stomach, for want 
of fome Suftenance, that J cannot defcribe them ; with 
fach freqnent Throes and Pangs of Appetite, that no- 
thing but the Tortures of Death can imitate : Ar.d thi9 
Condition I was in, when I heard the Seamen above 
cry out, A Sail y A Sail, and hallow and jump about as 
if they were dißrafled. 

I was not able to get off from the Bed, and my Mi- 
ftrefs much le(s ; and my Maßer was fo fiele, that I 
thought he had been expiring; fo we could not open the 
Cabin Door, or get any Account what it was that occa- * 
fioned fuch aCombuftion ; nor had we any Converfatiott 
with the Ship's Company for two Days, they having 
told as they had not a Mputhful of any thing to eat in 
the Ship : And they told us afterward s, they thought we 
had been dead. 

Jt was this dreadful Condition we were in, when you 
were fent to fave our Lives: And how you found us, Sir, 
you know as well as I, and better too. 

This was her own Relation, and is fuch a diftinft Ac- 
count of ftarving to Death, as, I confefs, I never met 
with, and was exceeding entertaining to me : I am the 
rather apt to believe it to be a true Account, becaufe the 
Youth gave me an Account of a good Part of it 5 thoughr 
I muß own, not fo diftinlt, and fo feclingly, as hi* 
Maid ; and the rather, becaufe, it feems, his Mother 
fed him at the Price of her own Life : But the poor 
Maid, though her Conftitution being ftronger than that 
©f her Miftrefs, who was in Years, and a weakly Woman 
too, me might ftruggle harder with it ; 1 Tay, the poor

ROB IN S O N CRUSOE. 153 

Upon this I ordered all my Men to keep clofe, left they 
ikould fhoot any more Arrows, and make all our Gans 
ready ; but, being fo near as to be within Hearing, I 
tnade Friday gQ out upon the Deck, and call out aloud 
to them in his Language, to know what they meant*; 
which accordingly he did; Whether they underftood 
him or not, that I knew not ; but, as foon as he had 
called to them» fix öf them, who vsere in the foremohV 
or nigheft Boat tt> us, turned their Canoes frorn* us ; and, 
ftooping down, (hewed us their naked Backiices ; juffc 
as if, in Engliß (faving your Prefence) they had bid u* 

Juß ; whether this was a. Defiance x>r Challenge, 

we know not; or whether it was done in.mere Con- 
tempt, or a Signal to the refl; but immediately friday 
cry'd out, They were going to fhoot; and unhappily 
for him (poor Feilow) they let fly about 300 of their 
^rrows ; and, to my inexpreffible Grief, kiüed poor 
Friday, no other Man being in their SighL The poor 
Feilow was fliot with no lefs than three Arrows, and 
about three. more feil very nigh him; fuch unlucky 
Markfmen they were. 

I was fo enraged with the Lof* of my old Servant, 
the Companion of all my Sorrows and Solitudes, that X 
immediately ordered five Guns to be loaded with fmalli 
Shot, and four with great ; and gave them fuch a Broad- 
Ade a& they had never heard in their Lives befcre, to be 
füre. 

They were not above half a Cable's Length off wfcenj 
we fired; and our Gunners took their Aim £0 well, that 
three or four of their Canoes were overfet, as we had: 
Reafon to believe, by one Shot only. 

The ill Manners of turning up their bare Backfides 
to as, gave us nd great Oftcnce; neither did I know for* 
certain, whether that, wh ; ch would pafsfor the greatefl: 
Contempt auiong us, might be underftood fo by them,. 
pr not; therefore in Return, I had only refolvcd co-havr ' 
fired fouror five Guns with Powderonly, which Lknew 
would fright them fufHciently : But when they fhot at us 
directly with all the Fury they were capable of r and 
efpecially as they had kiiled my poor Friday; whom I fo* 
jntirely loved and valued, and who* indeed,. fo well de-*

Arne Evening, we weighed, and fet Sajf for tbe Brsfib, . 
• We had a Prifoncr indeed, tu* tbe Creatare was fo 
füllen, that he would neitber eat or fpeak ; and we all 
fanfy'd be would üarve himfelf to Dcath : But I took 
a Way to eure htm ; for I made them tajce him, and turn 
bim into the Longboat, and makehim believe they would 
tofs him into the Sca again, and fo leave him where they 
round him, if he would not fpeak ; nor would that do, 
but they really dkl tbrow him into the Sea, and camc 
away frcni him ; and then hefollowed them, forhefwam 
like a Cork, and called tothem in hisTongue, tbo' the? 
knew not one Word of what he faid. However, at laft 
they took bim in again, and theo he began to be more 
tra&able ; nor did I ever defign they fhould drown bim. 
. We were now under Sail again ; but I was the moft 
diiconfolate Creature alhre, for want of my Man FriJay, 
and would have been very glad to have gone back to 
the Ifland, to have staken one of the reft from thence 
for my Ocoaiion, but it could not be j fo we went on : 
We had one Prifoner, as I have faid ; and it was a long 
while before we could make him underftand any thingj 
hat, in Time* ourMcn taogbt him fome E*gfifi, and ho

began to bc a little traäable : Afterwards \ve enquired 
what Country he came from, f but could make nothing 
of what he faid ; for his Speech was fo odd, all Gattu- 
rals, and fpoken in the Throat, in fuch an hol low and 
odd Manner, that we could never form a Word fron» 
him ; and we were all of Opinion, that they mighe 
fpeak that Language as well, if they were gagged, as 
«therwife ; nor could we perceive that they had any 
Occafion, either for Teeth, Tongae, Lips, or Palatey 
bot formed their Words, juft as a Hunting hörn forms 
a Tune, with an open Throat : He told us however, 
ibme Time after, when we had taught htm to fpeak a 
little Engli/b, that they were going, with their' Kings, 
to fight a great Battle. When he faid 'Kings, we afked 
him how may Kings ? He faid, There were fiw Na- 
tion (we could not make him underftand the plural S,) 
and that they all joined to» go againft two Nation. We 
afked him, What made them come up to «s ? He faid, 
7§ makee te great Wonder kok : Where it is to be ob- 
fcrved, That all thofe Natives-, as alfo thofe of Jfrica, 
when they learn Englijh, they always add two E*a at 
the End of the Words where we ufe onc, and place the 
Accent upon the laft of them ; as makee, takec^ and 
the like ; and we could not break them of it ; nay, 
I could haidly make Friday leave it off* though' at lafi 
he did. 

1 And now I name the poor FeHow once more, I 
ihuft take my laft Leave of him; poor honeft Friday! 
We buried him with att Deceney and Solemnity poßi- 
ble; by putting him into a Coffin, and throwing him 
into the Sea ; and I caufed them to fire eleven Guns for 
him ; and fo ended the Life of the ijioft grateful; faith- 
ful, honeft, and moft äffeäionate Servant that ever Man: 
had.

y Partner afterwards. . I got him foon loaded with the 
lall Cargo I häd fent them ; and one of our Seamen, 
at had been cm Shore with mc there, offered to go with 
e Sloop, and fettle there, upon my Letter to the Go- 
rnor Spartiard, to allot him a fufficient Quantity of 
and for a Plantation ; and giving him forae Cloaths, • 
id Tools for bis Planung- work, which, he faid, he un- 
:r(lood, having been an old Planter in Maryland, and a 
iccaneer into the Bargain. 

1 encouraged the Fei low by granting all he defired ; 
d, as an Addition, I gave him the Savage which we 
Ld taken Prifoner of War, to be his Slave, and ordered 
e Governor Spantard to give him his Share of every 
ing he wanted with the red. 

When we came to fit this Man out, my old Partner 
ld me, there was a certain very honelt Feilow, a Bra- 
Planter of his Acquaintance, who had fallen into the 
ifpleafure of the Church ; I know not what the Mat- 
r it with him, fays he ; but, on my Confcience, I 
ink he is an Heretic in his Heart ; and he has been 
iliged to conceal himfelf for fear of the Inquifuion ; 
at he would be very glad of fuch an Opportunity to 
ake his Efcape, with his Wife, and two Daughters ; 
id if I would let them go to my Ifland, and allot them 
Plantation, he would give them a fmall Stock to be- 
n with ; for the Officers of the Inquifition had feized 

I his Effecls and Eftate, and he had nothing left but a 
tle Houfhold-ftuff, and two Slaves. And, adds he, 
ough I hate his Principles, yet I would not have him 

II into their Hands ; for he will afluredly be burntalive, 
he does. 

I grantcd this prefently, and joined my Englißman 
tth them ; and we concealed the Man, and his Wife 
id Daughters, on board our Ship, . Till the Sloop 
it out to go to Sea ; and then (having put all their 
oods on board the Sloop fome Time before) we put 
cm on board the Sloop, after fhe was got out of ihe 

Our Seaman was mightily pleafed with this new

Among the left of the Sapplies fent my Tenants*in

them to marry them, and nie them klndly. ' I coold bare 
procured more Women, bot! remembered, that the poor 
perfecated Man had two Daaghters, and there were bat 
£ve of the Spaniards that wanted ; the reft had Wives of 
their own, tho* in-another Conntry. - . 

1 All this Cargo arrived fafe, and, as yoo may eifiry 
fnppofe, very welcome to my old Inhabitants, who were 
inow (with this Addition) between üxty and* {eteory 
People, befides little Children ; of which there were a 
great many : I foand Letters at London from them, all by 
Way of Lißon, when I carrie back to England '; being 
fent back to the Brafih by this Sloop 2 of which I fhali 
take fome Notice in its Place. 

I have now done with my Ifland, 'and all manner of 
Difcourfe aboat it \ and whoever read* the reft of mjr • 
Memorandums, would do 'well to turn bis Thooghts

tion, and for my People, took a Patent from tbe Govern- 
ment here, to hare fecured my Property, in Subjeclioh 
only to that of England \ which, to be füre, I might have 
obtained ; bad I carried over Cannon and Ammunition, 
Servants, and People to plant, and, taking Pofleffion of 
the Place, fortified and ftrengthened it in theName of 
England^ and increafed it with People, as I might eafily 
have done»; had I then fettled myfelf there, and fent the 
Ship back, loaden with good Rice, as I might alfo have 
done in üx Months Time, and order'd my Friends 
to have fitted her out again for our Supply ; had I done 
this, and ftayed rhere myfelf, I had, at leaft, acled like a 
Man of common Senfe ; bat I was poflefs'd with a wander- 
ing Spirit, fcorn'd all Advantages, pleas'd myfelf with be- 
ing the Patron of thefe People I had plac'd there, anddo- 
insr for them in a Kind of haughty majeftic Way, like an 
old Patriarchal Monarch ; providing for them, as if I had 
been Father of the whole Family, as well as of the Planta, 
tiou : But I never fo much as pretended to plant in the 
Name of any Government or Nation, or to acknowledge 
any Prince, or to call my People Subje&s to any one Na- 
tion more than another: Nay, I never fo much as gave 
the Place a Name ; but left it as I found it, belonging to 
no Man ; and the People under no Difcipline or' Govern- 
ment but my own ; who, though I had an Inßuence over 
them as Fatber and Benefa&or, had no Authority or Power 
to a£l or command one Way or other, farther than vo- 
■luntary Confent moved them to comply ; yet even this, 
had I ftayed there, would have done well enough ; but 
as I rambled from them, and came thither no more, the 
laß Letters I had from any of them, were by my Part- 
ners Means, who afcerwards fent another Sloop to the 
Place ; and who fent me Word, though J had not the 
Letter tili five Years after it was written, that they went 
on but poorly, were raalecontent with their long Stay 
there; that WilL Jtkins was dead ; that Ave of the Spant-

Crufie ; fo I mufl leave here the fruitlefs exclaiming at 
myfeif, and go on with my Voyage. 

From the Brafils we made directly away over the Atlan- 
tic Sea, to the Cape deforme Ffperance, or, as we call it, the 
Cape ofGoodHope-, and had a tblerable good Voyage, our 
Courfe generally South Ealr.; now-and-then a Storni, 
and fome contrary Winds. But my Difafters at Sea were 
at an End ; my future Rubs and crofs Events were to 
befal me on Shore ; that it might appear, the Land was 
as well prepared to be our Scourge, as the Sea ; when 
Heaven, who direcls the Circumftances of things > pleafes 
to appoint it to be'fo. 4 

Our Ship was oh aTrading Voyage, and had a Super- 
cargoon board, who was todirett all herMotions, after 
fhe arrived at the Cape ; only being limitted to certain 
Number of Days, for Stay, by Charter- party, at the 
feveral Ports fhe was to go to : This was npne of my 
Bufinefs, neither did I meddle with it all ; my «Nephew 
the Captain, and the Supercargo, adjufting all thofe things 
between them, as they thought fir. 

We made no Stay at the Cape, longer than was need- 
ful to take in frefh Witer ; but made the bell of our 
Way for the Coaft of Coromandel ; we were indeed in« 
fönned, that a Fr e neb Man of War of fifcy Guns, and 
two large Merchant fhips, were gone for the Indies ; 
and, as I knew we were at War with France, I had fome 
Apprehenfione of them ; but they went thexr own Way, 
and we heard so more of them. 

I (hall not pefter my Account, or the Reader, with 
Defcriptions of Places, Journals of our Voyages-, Varia- _ 
tions of the Compafs, Latitudes, Meridian Diftances, 
Trade-winds, Situation of Ports, and the like ; fach as 
a Impft all the Hiilories of long Navigation are füll of, 
x and which make the Reading tirefome enough ; and are 
perfeäly unprofitable to all that read, except only to 
thofe who are to go thofe Places themfclves. 

It is enough to name the Ports and Places which we 
touclred at ; and what oecurred to us upon our paffing 
from t>nje to another. We touch'd firlt at the Ifland of 
hladagajcar ; where, tho' the People are fierce and treache- 
rous, and in particular, very well armed with Lances and 
Bows, which they ufe with inconceivable DturtxnVj , ^^. 



r6i The Life ^Adventüres of 
we fared very well with them twhile ; they treated ui very 
civilly ; and, for fome Trifles which we gave them, fuch as 
Knives, Seiflars, &r. they brought us 1 1 good fat BoU .. 
lock», nriddling in Size, but very good in Fleln ;. which we 
took in, partly for freßi Provifions forourprefent fpeüd.

' Wt were obliged to ftay here for fome Time» after we 
had rurailhM ourfelves' with Provifions ; and 1, that | 
was always too curious to look into every Nook of 
the World # wherever I came, was for going on Short 
aa ofteo as I could. It was on the Eaft aide of die 
Jflaud that we went on Shore one Evening ; and the 
People^who, by the Way, are very nnmerous, came 
thronging abbat us, and ftood gazing at us, at a Di- j 
llance: As we had traded Freely with them, and had 
been kindfy nfed, we thooght ourielves in no Danger? 
bot when we faw the People, we cur three Boogb 
oot of a Tree, and ftack them up at a Diftance fron 
tos, which, it feeihs, is a Mark in the Country, not 
oniy of Trucc and Eriendöiip, but, when it is acoepteoY 
the other Side (et up three Poles, or Bougbs, aliöi 
which is a Signal, that they aeeept the Troce tooj bet 
then this is a known Condition of the Truce, that y<m - 
are not to pafs beyond their three Poles towards. them, 
nor they come paft your three ^oles or Bongh* toward 
yoo; fo that yoo are perfe&ly fecure within the three' 
Poles, and all the Space between your Poles andthein» 
is a^Iowed like a Market, for free Converfe, Traffick, 
and Commerce. When you go tbither,* yoa muft not 
carry your Weapons with you ; and if they conse fnto 
that Space, they ftick up their Javelins^and Lances, all 
at the firft Poles, and come on unarmed ; bat if any 
Violence is offered them, and the Truce thereby brokert, 
away they run tdthe Poles, and lay hold of their Wea- ' 
jons, and then the Truce is at an End. 

It happened, one Evening, when we went on S höre, 
that a greater Number of their People. came down 
than ufual; büt was all very friendly and civil. Thejr 
brought with them feveral Kinds of Provifions, fof 
which we fatisfied them, with fuch Toys as we had» 
their Women alfo brought us Milk and Roots, and ft> 
reral things very acceptable to us, and all. was qoiets

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 163 

*nd wc made us a little Tent, or Hut, of Tome Bonghs 
of Trees, and lay on Shore all tbat Night. 

I know not what was the Occafion, but I was not fo 
Well fatisficd to lie on Shore as the reft ; and the ßoat ly- 
ing at an Anchor, about a Stone's Caft from the Land, 
withtwo Men in her to take care of her, I made one of 
them come on Shore ; and, getting fome Boughs of 
Trees to cover as alfo in the Boat, I fpread the Sail on 
'the Bottom of the Boat, and lay on board, under the 
Cover of the Branches of the Trees, all Night. 

About Two o'Clock in the Morning we heard one 
of our Men make a terrible Noife on the Shore, calling 
out, for God's Sake, to bring the Boat in, and come 
and help them, for they were all like to be murcertd ; 
at the faine Time I heard the firing öf five Mufqucts, 
which was tbe Namber of the Guns they had, and that 
-three Times dver; for, it fee ms, the Natives here were 
*not fo eafily frighted with Guns, as the Savages were in 
-America, where I had to dp with them. 
' All this while 1 knew not what was the Matter ; but 
roufing immediately from Sleep with the Noife, I 
caufed -the Boat ro be thraft'in, and refolved, with 
: tbrce Fufils we ha4 on board, to land, and affift ouV 
Men. 

We got the Boat foon to the Shore 5 but our Men 
were in toomuch Hafte: For, bei ng come to the Shore, 
• fhey plunged into the Water, to get to the Boac wich 
all the Expedition thc'y could, being purfued by be. 
tween three and four hundred Men. Our Men were 
bot nine in all, and only hve of them had Fufils witft 
them j the reft, indeed, had Piftols and Swords, but 
they were of fmall Ufe to them. 

We took up feven of our Men, and with Difficulty 
-rnough too, three of them being very ill wounded ; 
and that which was Hill worfe, was, that while ue 
ftood in the Boat to take our Men in, we were in as much 
Dangeras they were in on Shore; for they pour'd their 
Arrows in upon us fo thick, that we were fain to 
barricade the Side of the Boat up with the Benches, 
and two or three loofe Boards, which-, to our great 
Satisfaäion, we had, by merc Accident, or Pro\ idence 
rathcr, in the Boat.

thofe Parts, put me upon it ; for he faid, he was füre 
the Inhabitants woold not have touched us, after we had 
made aTruce, if wc had not done fomething to pro- 
voke thezn to it : At length it came out, <viz. that an 
old Woman, who had come to feil us fome Milk, had 
brought it within our Poles, with a young Woman 
with her, who alfo brought fome Roots or Herbs ; 
änd while the old Woman (whether (he was Mother to 
the yoang Woman, or no, they could not teil) was fel- 
line us the Milk, one of our Men ofFered fome Rüde- 
fteis to the Wench that was with her ; at which the 
old Woman made a great Norfe. However, the Seaman 
would not quit his Prize, but carried her out of the old 
Woman'sSlght, among the Trees, it beingalmoft dark ; 
the old Woman went away with out her, and, as we 
foppofe, made an Outcry among the People fhe came 
frorn ; who, npon Notice, raifed this great Army upon 
us in three or four Hours ; and it was great Odds but 
we had been all deftroyed. 

One of our Men was killed with a Lance that was 
thrown at him, jufl at the Beginning of the Attack, as 
he faflyM out of the Tent we had made ; ' the reft came 
off free, all but the Fellow who was the Occafion of all 
the Mifchief; who paid dear enough for his black Ml- 
ftrefs, for we could not hear what became of him a 
great while ; we lay upon the Shore two Days after, 
though the Wind prefented, and made Signals for him } 
made our Boat fail up-fhore, and down -(höre, , feveral 
Leagues, but in vain; fo we were obÜgcd to give him 
over ; and if he alone had fuffered for it, the Lofs had 
been the lefs. 

I could not fatisfy myfelf, however, without ventur- 
ing on Shore once more, to try if I could learn any thing 
of him or them ; it was the third Night after the Aclion, 
that I had a great Mind to learn, if I cou'd by any Means, 
what Mifchief we had done, and how the Game ftoodon 
the lnäian Side : I was careful to do it in the Dark, left 
we (hould be attackM again ; but I ought indeed, to 
have been füre, that the Men I went with, had been un- 
der my Co mm and, before I engag'd in a thing fo hazar- 
dous and mifchievous, as I was brought into it without 
my Knowledge or Deüre. 



i66 Tbt Life and Ambntuiis ^ 

We took twenty ftont Fellows with us as any in the 
Ship, befides the Suftrcargo and myfelfj and we landed 
two Hours before Midnight, at tue. famc Place where 
the IntUans ftood drawn up the Evening betöre,» I landed 
herc, bccaufc my Defign, as I have faid, was chiefly to ' 
fee if they had quitted the Fiejd, and i£ they had left 
*ny Marks behind them, or of -the Mifchief we M 
Hone them ; and I thooght» if we. conld furprife one or 
two of them, perhaps we might get oor Man again, by 
Way of Exchange. 

• "We landed withoat any Noife, and div^ded pur Mea 
into two Companies, wnereof the Boätfwain com- 
manded one, and 1 theother: We nekber could hfir 
nor fce any Body ftirt when we landed^ fo we marched 
up, one Body at a Diftance from the. other, to the 
Field of Battle : At firft we conld fee npthing, it being 
very'dark; but by and by, our Boätfwain, that led the 
firft Party 9 ftnmbled and feil over & £ead Body: Thii 
made them* hart there awhile ; for, knowing by the Cir. 
cumftances, that they were at the Place where the h» 
Hans had ftood, they waited for my Coming up : Here 
we concluded to halt tili the Moon began to rife, which 
we knew would be in lefs than an Hour ; and thcn 
we conld eafily difcern the Havock we had made a- 
mong them : We told two and-tbirty Bodies upon the 
Ground, whereof two were not quite dead. Some had v 
an Arm, and fomea Leg, {bot* off; and one, hisHead: 
Thofe that were wounded, we fuppofed they had car* 
ricd away. 

When we had made, as I thought, a füll Difcovery 
öf all we could come at the Knowledge oT, I was for 
going on board again ; but the Boätfwain and his Party 
often fent me Word, that they were refolved to make-a 
Vifit to the Indian Town, where thefe Dogs, as they 
called them, dwelt ; and defired me to go along with 
them ; and if they could find them, as they ltill fanfied 
they (liould, they did not doubt, they faii, gstting a 
good Booty ; and it might be, they might find Thomas 
Jeffrys there ; that was the M^n's Name we had loft. 

Had they fent to afk my Leave to go, I knew well 
enough what Anfwer to have given them ; for I wonld 
have cominanded them inüantly on board, knowing it

was not a Hazard fit for us to run, who had a Ship, 
and a Ship's Loading in our Charge, and a Voyage to 
make, which dependecf very much upon the Lives of 
the Men ; buc as they fcnt me Word they were re- 
folved to go, and only afk'd me and tny Company to 
go aJong with them, I pofitively refufed it, and rofe 
ep (for I was fitting^on the Ground) in order togo to 
the Boat ; one -or two of the Men began to importune 
me to go ; and,- when I ftill refufed pofitively, began 
to grumble, and fay they Were not ander my Command, 
and they would go : Come, Jack % fays one of the Men, 
will vou go with me ? I will go for one. Jack faid he 
would ; and another followed, and then another ; and, 
in a Word, they all left me but one, whom, with much 
Difficulty too, I perfuaded to ftay ; fo the Supercargo 
and I, with pne Man, went back to the Boat, where, 
I told them, We would flay for them, and take care to 
take in as rnany of them as (hould be Jett ; for I told 
them, it was a mad thing they were going about, and 
fuppofed moft of them would run the Fate of Thomas 

7'ffrV-' 

They told me, like Seamen, they'd Warrant it they 
would come off again ; and they would take care, tffc. 
So away they went. I intreated them to conßder the 
Ship, and the Voyage ; that their Lives were not their 
own ; and that they were intrufted with the Voyage, 
in fome Meafure ; that if they mjfcarried, the Ship 
might be loft for Want of their Help ; and that they 
Could not anfwer it to G od and Man. I faid ä great 
dcal more to them on that Head, but I rnight as well 
have talked to the Main-maft of the Ship ; they were 
mad upon their Journey ; only they gave me good 
Words, and begg'd I would not be angry ; faid, they 
would be very cau.ious, and they diel not doubt but 
they would be back again in about an Hour at fartheit; 
for the Indian Tovvn, they faid, was not above half a 
Mile off: Though they found it above two Miles be- 
fore they go to it. 

Well, they all went away, as above ; and though the 
Attempt was defperate, and fuch, as none but Madmen 
would have gone about, yet, to give them their Due, 
they went about it warily, as well ab boldly. They were 



168 Tl)e Life and Adventures of 

gallantly armcd, that is true ; for they had every Man 
Fufil or Mufquct, a Bayonet, and every Man a PiftoH 
fome of them had broad Cutlaces, fome of them Hangers: 
and the fcoatfwain, and two more, had Pole-axes : B 
fides all which they had among them thirteen Hand-Gi — 
nadoes. Bolder Fellows, and better provided* neverwe= 
about any wicked Work in the Wtfrld. 

When they went out, their chief Defign was Plunder- 
and they were in mighty Hopes of finding Gold ther *i 
T>ut a Circumftance which none of them were aware <m 
kt them on Fire with Rerenge, and made Devils of th^ 
all : When they came to the few Indian Houfes, wh^SL 
they thought had been the Town, which were not abc^ 
half aMile off, they were under a great Difappointme ~mr 
for there were not above twelve or thirteen Houfes ; zm~ i 
where the Town was, or how big, they knewnot : Th. 
confulted therefore what to do, and were fome Time fc 
fore they 'could refolve ; for if they feil upon thefe, tY* 
muft cut all their Throats ; and it was ten toonebut fo*: 
of them might efcape, it beingin the Night, though c. 
Moon was up; and if one efcaped, he would run awa 
and raife all the Town, fo they fhould have a whole -A 
niy upon them. Again, on the other Hand, if cli« 
went away, and left thofe. untouch'd (for the Peop 
were all afleep) they could not teil which Way to loo 
for the Town. 

However, the lad was the bell Advice ; fo they re 
folved taleave thofe Houfes, and look for the Town *< 
well as they could : They went an a little Way, and 
found a Cow tied to aTree : This they prefently con- 
cluded woufd be a good Guide fo them ; for they faid, 
the Cow certainly belonged to thje Town before them, 
or the Town behind them ; and if they untied her, 
they fheukfYee which Way fhe went; if fhe weht back, 
they had nothing to fay to her ; but, if fhe went for- 
ward, they had nothing to do but to follow her ; fo 
they cut the Cord, which was made of twifled Flaes, 
and the Cow went on before them: In a Word, the 
Cow led them directly to the Town, which, as they 
reported, confifted of above 200 Houfes, or Huts j and 
in fome of thefe, they found -feveral Families living 
toecther. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 16* , 

Here they fonnd all filent ; as profoundly fecure, as 
Sieep and a Country that had never feen an Enemy of 
that Kind, could make them: Upon this they call'd ano- 
ther Council, Co confider what they had to do 5 and, 
in a Word, they refolv'd to divide themfelves into three 
Bodies, and to fet three Houfes on Fire in three Parts 
of the Town ; and as the Men came out, to feize them 
and bind them ; if any refifted, they need not be afked 
what to do then; and fo to fearch the red of the Houfes 
for Plunder $ but refolv'd to march filently firft through 
the Town, and fee what Dirnen fions it was of, and con- 
ti der if they might venture upon it, or no. 

They did fo, and defperately refolved that they would 
venture upon them ; but white they were animating one 
another to the Work, three of them, that were a little 
before the reft, called out aloud, and told them they had 
found Tko. Jtffrys ; they all ran up to the Place, and fo 
it was indeed, for there they found the poor Fellow hang- 
ed up naked by -one. Arm, and his Throat cur. There 
was an Indian Houfe jufl by the Tree, where they found 
iixteen or feventeen of the principal Indians, who had 
been conccrned in the Fray wich us before, and two or 
three of them wounded with our Shot; and our Men 
füund they were awake, and talking one to another in 
that Houfe, but knew not their Number. 

Tbe Sight of their poor mangled Comrade fo enraged 
them, as before, that they fwore to one another they 
would be revenged, and that not an Indian who came 
into their Hands üiouldhave Quarter; and to work they 
wem immediately ; ancTyec not fo madly as by the Rage 
and Fury they were in, might be expe&ed. Their firil 
Care was to get fomething that would foon take Fire; 
bnt after a littlc Search, they found that would be to no 
Purpofe, for moft of the Houfes wtre low, and thatch'd 
with Flags or Rulhes, of which the Country is füll ; fo 
they preiently made fome Wildörc, as we call it, by wet- 
ting a little Powder in the Palms of their Hands ; and, in 
a Quarter of an Hour, they fet the Town on Fire in four 
or 6ve Places ; and particularly that Houfe where the /«- 
giians were not gone to Bed. As foon as the Fire began 
to blaze, the poor frighted Creatures began to rafh out 
to fave their Livcs $ but met with their Fatt va vi» \v- 
. V o l. II. H *flpp* 



170 The Life and Ad venture s \of 
tempt, and cfpecially at the. Door, where they drove 
them back, the Boatfwain himfelf killing ons or two 
with his Pole-Ax ; the Houfe being largc, and many in 
it, he did not care to go in, but called for an Hand-gre- 
nado, and threw it amongthem, which, at-firit, frighted 
them ; but wben it burit, madc luch Havock among 
them, that they cried out in a hideous Manner. 

In (hört, moft of the Indians who were in the open 
Part of the Houfe, were killed or hurt with the Gre- 
n.ido, except two or three more, who .preüed to the 
Door, which the Boatfwain and two more kept with 
the Bayonets in the Muzzles of their Pieces, and dif- 
patehed all Who came that Way. But there was ano- 
ther Apartment in the Houfe, where the Prince or 
King, or whatfoever he was, and feveral others, were ; 
and they kept in, tili the Houfe, which was by this 
Time all of a light Flame, feil in upon them, and they 
were fmothered, or burnt together. 

AU this while they fired not x Gun, becaufe they 
would not waken the People faller than they could 
mafier them; but the Fire beganto waken them faß 
enough, and our Fellows were glad to keep a little to- 
gether in Bodies ; for the Fire grew fo raging, all the 
Houfes being made of light combuftiWe StufF, that they 
could hardly bear the Street betwcen them ; and their 
Bufinefs was to follow the Fire for the furer Execotion : 
As faft as the Fire eithcr forced the People out of thofe 
lioufes which were burning, or frighted them outofo- 
thers, our People were ready at their Doots to knock 
them on the Head, Hill callingänd hallowing taoneaa- 
other to remember Tbo. Jeffrys. 

While this was doing, I muß confefs I was very un- 
cafy, andefpecially when I faw the Flames of the Town, 
which, it being Night, feem'd to be juft by me. 

My Nephew the Captain, •■ who was rous'd by his Men 
too, feeing fuch a Fire, was very uneafy, ■ not knowiog 
what the Matter was, or what Danger I was in ; cfpeci- 
ally hearing the Guns too ; for by this Time they began 
to ufe their Fire- Arms : A thoufand Thoughts oppreis'a 1 
his Mind concerning me and the Supercargo, what (hould 
•-become of us : And, at laft, though he could ill fpare 
SLtiy more Men, yet, not knowing what Exigence we night 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 171 

be in, he takes another Boat, and, with thirteen Men. 
and himfelf, comes on Shore to me. 

He was furpris'd to fee me and the Super cargo in the 
Boat, with no more than two Men, for one had been 
lefc to keep the Boat; and though he was glad, that we 
were well, yet he was in the fame Impatience with us, 
to know what was doing ; for the Noife continued, and 
the Flame increafed : I confefs, it was next to an Impof- 
flbility for any Men in the World to reflrain their Curio- 
fity of knowing what had happened, or their Concern for 
the Safety of the Men. In a Word, the Captain told me, 
■He would go and help his Men, let what would come. 
I argued with hira, as I did before with the Men, the 
Safety of the Ship, and the Danger of the Voyage, the 
Intereft of the Owners and Merchants, &e. and told 
him, I would go, and the two Men, and only fee if we 
could, at a Diitance, learn what was like to bethe E- 
verit, and come back, and teil him. 

It was all one to talk to my Nephcw, as it was to talfe 
to the reft before; he would go, he faid, and hc only 
wifhed he had left but ten Men in the Ship ; for he 
could not think of having his Men loft for Want of 
Help : He had rather, he faid, lofe the Ship, the Voyage, 
and his Life, and all ; and fo away went he. 

Nor was I any more able to ftay behind now, than I 
was to perfuade them not. to go before ; fo, in (hört, 
the Captain ordered two Men to row back the Pin- 
hace, and fetch twelve Men more from the Ship, leav- 
ingthe Long-boat at an Anchor ; and that when they. 
carae back, fix Men ßiould keep the two Boats, and (ix 
more come after us ; fo that he left only fixteen Meu h\ 
the Ship ; for the whole Ship's Company confiited of 65 
Men, whereof two were loft in the firfl Quarrel, whicli 
brought thisMifchief on. 

Being now on the March, you may be füre we feie 
lictle of the Ground we trod on ; and being guided by 
the Fire, we kept no Path, but went direaiy to the 
Place of the Flame. If the Noife of the Guns were 
furprifing to us before, the Cries of the poor People 
were now quite of another Nature, and filled us with 
Horror. I muft confefs, I never was at the facking of 
* Cty> <F at the taking of a Town by Storm ; I have 



jyi The Life and Aöventurbs of 

heard of Oliver Cromvuell taking Drogheda in Irelani, 
and killing Man, Woman, and Child; and I had read 
of Count Tilly facking of the City of Magdeburg, and 
cutting the Throats of 22,000 of both Sexes ; bat I never 
had an Ideaof the Thing itfelf before; nor is it polüble 
• to defcribe it, or the Horror which was upon our Minds 
at hearing it. 

However, we went on, and. at ler gth, came to the 
Town, thoogh there was no entering the Strcets of it 
fpr the Fire. The firft Objeft we met with, was the 
Ruins of a Hut or Houfe, or rather the A flies of it, 
for the Houfe was confumed ; and juft before it, piain 
now to be feen by the Light of the Fire, lay four Men 
and three Women killed ; and, as we thought, one or 
two more lay in the Heap among the Fire. fn /hört, 
thefe were fuch Inftances of a Rage altogether barba- 
rous, and of a Fury fo mething beyond what was hu- 
man, that we thought it impoffible our Men could 
be guilty of it 5 or, if they were the Authors of it, we 
thought tbat every one of thcm ought to be put to 
the word of Deaths : But this was not all ; we faw the 
Fire increafed forward, and the Cry went on juft as 
the Fire went on, fo that we were in the utmoft Con- 
fufion. We advanced a little Way farthcr j.and behefd, 
to our Altonifhment, three Women naked, crying in a 
moft dreadful Manner, and flying as if they had, in- 
deed, had Wings, and after them fixteen or feventeen 
Men, Natives, in the fame Terror and Confternation, 
with three of our Engliß Butchers (for I can call thcm 
no better) in the Rear ; who, when they could not 0- 
vertake them, fired in among them, and one that was 
killed by their Shot feil down in our Sight ; when the 
reft faw us, believing us to be their Enemies, and that 
we would m arder them, as well as thofe that purfaed 
them, they fet up a moft dreadful Shriek, efpecially the 
Women; and two of them feil down as if aLeady dead 
with the Fright. 

My very Soul (hrunk within me, and my Blood ran 
chill in my Veins, when I faw this ; and, I believe, had 
the three Engliß Sailors, that purfued them, come on, 
I had made our Men kill them all. However, w« took 
fome Ways to let the poor flying Creatures know, that 

we 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. . 173 

wc would not hurt theni ; and immediately they came 
Dp to us, and kneeling down, with their Hands lifted 
up, made piteous Lamentation to us to fave them, 
which we let them know we would do ; whereupon 
they kept all tcgether in a Huddle, clofe behind us, 
For Protection. I lefc my Men drawn up together, and 
charged them to hurtNobody, but, if poflible, to get 
at fome of our People, and fee what Devil it was pof- 
fefled' them, and what they intended to do ; and, in a 
Word, to com m and them off j aiTuring them, that if 
they ftayeJ tili Day-light, they would have a hundred 
thoufand Men about their Ears : I fay, I left them, and 
went among thofe flying People, taking only two of 
our Men with me ; and there was, indeed, a piteous 
Speclacle among them : Some of them had their Feet 
terriöly burnt with trampling and rünning through the 
Fire ; others their Hands burnt ; one of the Women had 
fallen down in the Fire; and was almoft burnt to Death 
before fhe could get out again ; two or three of the 
Men had Cuts in their Backs and Thighs, from our 
Men purfuing ; and another was fhot through the Body, 
and died while I was there. 

I would fain havc learned what the Occafion of all 
this was, but I could not underftand one Word they 
faid ; though by Signs I perceived, that fome of them 
knew not what was the Occafion themfelves. I was (o 
terrified in myThoughts at this outrageous Attempt, 
that I could not ftay there, but went back to my own 
Men ; I told them my Refolution, and commanded them 
to follow me, when in the very Moment, came four 
of our Men, with the Boatfwain at their Head, running 
-over theHeapsof Bodies they had kill cd, all covered 
with Blood and Duft, as if they wanted möre People 
to maflacre ; when onr Men hallow'd to them as loud 
as they could hallow ; and, with much ado, one of 
them made them hear ; fo that they knew who we were, 
and come up to us. 

As foon as the Boatfwain faw us, he fet up a Hai- 
low like a Shout of Triumph, for havirsg, as he thought,. 
more Help come ; and without bearing to hear me, Cap- 
tain, fays Se, noble Captain, I am glad you are coaie\

would not give us Leave to fpeak a Word.

. F cönfefs, I was urged then myfelf, and at ano'ther

tley had carried their Rage too far, and thought of 
Jaccb's Words to his Sons Simeon and Lenri 9 Curfed bt 
their Anger ; fcr it was fierce ; and their Wrath % for it. 
nvas cruel. But I had now a new Tafk upon. my 
Hands ; for when the Men I carried with me faw the. 
Sight, as I had done, J had as much to do to refirain. 
them, as I fhould have had with the others j nay, my 
Nephew himfeif feil in with them, and told me, in their 
Hearing, that he was only concerned for fear of their 
Ken being overpowered ; for, as to the People, he 
thought not one of them ought to live ; for they had 
al! glutted themfelvcs with the Murder of the poor 
Man, and that they ought to be ufed like Murderers: 
Upon thefe Words, away ran eight of my Men with the 
Boatfwain, and his Crew, to complete their bloody Work: 
Aod I, feeing it quite out of my Power to reftrain them, 
came away penfive and fad ; for I could not bear the ; 
Sight, much lefs the horrible Noife and Ches, of the 
poor Wretches that feil into their Hands. 

I got nobody to come back with me but the S*ptr- 

€&rgo and two Men, and with thefe I walked back to 

the Boats. It was a very great Piece of Folly in me, 1 

confefs, to venture back, as it werealone; for, as it

over the Country, there ßood about forty Men armed 
wich Lances and Bows at the Utile Place where the 
twelre or thirteen Holifes ftood mentioned before ; bat 
by Accident I. mifs'd the Place, and came directly to the 
Sea-fide ; and by that Time I got to the Sea-fide, it 
was broad Day ; immediately I took the Pinnace, and 
went aboard; and fent her: back to affilt the Men in tvhat 
might happem 

1 obferved that aboot. the Time I came to the Böat- . 
fidc, the Fire was pretty well out* and the Noifeabated ; 
but in abont half an Hour after I got on board, I beard 
a Volley of our Mens Fire- Arms, and faw a great Smoke; 
this, as I underftood after war da, was our Men falling 
upon the forty Men, who, as I faid, ftood at the few 
Honfes on the Way ; of whom they killed fixteen or fe- . 
venteen, and.fet all thofe Houfea. Qn Fire, but did not 
jneddle with the Women or Children. 

By. that. Time the Men got tb the Shore again with the 
- Pinnace, onr Men began to appear ; they came dropping 
in, fome andfome; not in twoBodie», and in Form, as 
they went- out, bat all in Heaps, ftragglirrg herc-and- 
there, in. fach a Manner, that a fmall Force of refolute 
Men might have *eut ehern all off. 

Bot theDread of them was upon the whole Country : 
The People were amaz'd, and furprls'd, and fo frighted, 
that, I believe, an Hundred of them would have Sed ac 
the Sight of but fiVe of our Men. Nor in all this terrible 
Aclion was there aMan who made any confiderable De- 
fence ; they were fo furprifed between the Terror of the 
FSre, and the fiidden-Attack of our Men in the Dane, that 
they knew not which Way to turn themielves ; for if they 
fled one Way, they were met by one Party ; if back again,. 
by another; fo that they were every where knockcd 
down : Nor did any of our Men reeeive the leaft Hurt, 
except one who ilrained his Foot, and another had one 
of his Hands very much burnt. 

I was very angry with my Nephew the Captain, and* 
indeeef, with all the Men, in my Mind, but with him in 
particular ; -as well for his a&ing fo out of his Duty, as. 
Commander of the Ship, and having the Charge of the

The »ext Day we fet feil ; fo we never heard any 
snore of it. Oar Men differed ia the Acconnt of the. 
Namber they killed ; fome faid one thing, Jörne anochcr : 
Bot, accoiding to the beft of their Accoonts pat all to-

However juft our Men tboaght tbis Aöionto be, I.

told tbem, God would blaft the Voyage ; fbr I look'd 
upon tbe Blood they fbed tbat Night, to be Marder, ia*

thing but what was juft, and that the Laws of God al- 
lowed to be dore to Morderers. 

One would think this fhould have been enough to 
have warned us againft going on Shore among Heathen» 
and Barbarians; but it is impoffible co make Mankind 
wife, but at their own Experience ; and their Experi- 
ence feems f» be always of moft Ufe to them, when it is 
deareft bought. 

We were now bound to the Gnlph ofPer/ta, and from 
thence to the Coaft of Coromandel, only to touch at Surat ; 
but the chief of the Supereargd** Defign lay at the Bay 
of Bengale where, if he mifled of the Bufinefs outward - 
bound, he was to go up to China, and return to the Coaft 
as he came Home. ' 

The firft Difafter that befel us, was in the Gulph of 
Perßa, where five of our Men, venturing on Shore, oa 
the Arabian Side of the Gulph, were furrounded by 
the Arabs, and either all killed, or carried away into 
Slavery ; the reft of the Boats Crew were not able to 
refcue them, and had but juft Time to get off their 
Boat : I began to upbraid them with the juft Retribution 
of Heaven in this Cafe ; but the Boatfwain very warmly 
told me, he thought I went farther in my Cenfures, than 
I fhould fhew any Warrant for in Scripture, and referred 
to the thirtüenth of St. Luke, ver. 4. where our Saviour 
intimates, tbat thofe Men, on whom the Tower of Siloam 
feil-, were not Srnners above all the Ga/i Jeans; but tfyat 
which, indeed, put me to Silence in this Cafe, was, that 
aoneof thefe five Men, who were now loft, were of the 
Nuxnber of thofe who went on Shore to the Maflacre of 
Mndagafcar ffo I always called it, though our Men could 
aot bear the Word Maffacre with any Patience): And, 
indeed, this laft Circumftance, as I have faid, put me to 
SiJence for the pfefent. 

But my frequent Preaching to them on this Subjefr, 
had worfe Confequences chan I expecled ; and the Boat- 
fwain, who had been the Head of the Attefhpt, came 
op boldly to me one Time, and told me, He found that 
I continually brought that Affair upon the Stage ; that I 
made unjuft ReÜeclions upon it-, and had ufed the 
Men vcry ill on that Account, and himfelf in particu>

were not obliged to bcar it ; that they did not know 
iit I might have fomc ill Defiga in my Head, and» 
perhaps, to call them to an Account for it, whea they. 
came to England \ and ' that therefore, anlefa I would 
xefolve to havc done with it, and alfo not, to conccra 
myfelf farther with him, or any pf bis AfJairs, he would 
leave the Ship ; for hc did not think it waa &fe to fiül 
tvith me among them. 

I heard him patientry enoogh tili fac had done, and 
Inen told him, That I did confefs I had all along op- 
pofed the Mailacre of Madaga/ctr, for fach I would al- • 
wäyt call it ; and that I had ori all Occafions fpoken 
»y Mind frtfely aboot it, thoogh not more opon him 
than any of the reft 3 that aa to my having no Comnand 

äthe Ship, that was trat, nor did I exercife any Aa*

things which pnbljckly concerned ua all ; aa to wlpt 
Coocern I had in the .Voyage, that was none of h»

in that Claim Iconceivcd I had akight to fpeak, era

warm with him : He made bot little Repiy to me at 
that Time, and I thougbt that Affair had beenover. 
tVe were at this Time in the Road to Btqgal + and, 
fcemg willing to fee the Place, I went on Shore with 
the Suj>er<orgo, in the Ship's Boat, to divert myfelf \ and 
towards Evening, was preparxng to go 09 board, whea 
one of the Mcn came to me, and told me, he would 
not haye me trouble myfelf to come down to the Boat, 
for they had Orders not to carry me on board. . Any

no more to the Fcllow, but bid him let them know he

board the Ship in an Inekan Boat, and acquaint the 
Captain of it: Bat I might have fpar'd this Intelligence» 
for, befbre I had fpoken to him on Sborc, the Matter 
was effeäed on board : The fioatfwain, the Gunner* 
the Carpenter, and in a Word, all the inferior Officers, 
as foon as I was gone off in the Boat, came ap to the 
Qaarter-deck, and defired to fpeak with the Captain » 
and there the Boatfwain, making a long Harangue (foc 
the Fett ?wtalked very well), and repeatine all he had 
faid to me, told the Captain in a few Words, that as I 
was now gone peaceably on Shore, they were loth to 
vfe any Violence with me ; which, i£ I had not gone 
an Shore, they. would otherwife have done, to Obligo- 
me to have gone. They therefbre thought fit to teil 
him« that as they fhipped themfelves to ferve in the 
Ship, under his Co mm and, they would perform it 
faithfblly : Bat if I would not qait the Ship, or the. 
Captain oblige me to quit it, they would all leave the 
Ship, and fail no farther with him : And at that Word 
ALL, he turned his Face about towards the Main-mait* 
which was, it fcems, the Signal agreed on betweea 
them ; at which all the Seamen being got together, they 
cried out, One and ALL, One and ALL. 
'*' My Nephew the Captain was a Man of Spirit, and 
of great Prefence of Mind ; and though he was fur- 
prifed, you may be füre, at the thing, yet he told them 
calmly, he would confider of the Matter ; but that he 
eonld do nothing in it tili he had fpoken to me about 
k ; He ufed fome Arguments with them, to fhew them; 
the Unreafonablenefs and Injuftice of the thing ; bat it 
was all in vain 5 they fwore, and fhook Handa round» 
before his Faee, that they would go all on Shore, unjefl 
he wöuld ffngage to them, not toiuffer me to coxne on 
board the Ship. 

This was an hard Article upon him,. who knew hi», 
Obligation tp me, and did not know how I might 
täke it ; fo he began to talic cavalierly to them ;. told 
them, That I was a very.» confiderable Owoer of the 4 
Ship, and that in Juftice he could not put me out of 
my own Houfe j that this was next Door to ferving 
me, as the famous Pirate Kid had done, who made the> 
Mutiny in the Ship, fet (he Captain qu Statt v& .*wv\>xC\tv- 



■j£o The Life and Advent ures. of 
ha\>ited Ifland, and ran away with the Ship ; that let 
thcm go into what Ship they would, if cver thcy came 
to England again, it would coft them dear; that the 
Ship was mine, and that he would not put mc out of 
it ; and that he would jather lofe the Ship, and the 
Voyage too, than difoblige me fo much ; fo they might 
do as they pleafcd. However, . he would go on Shore, 
and talk with me there ; and invited the Boatfwain to 
go with him, and, perhaps, they might accommodate 
the Matter with me. 

But they all reje&ed the Propofal ; and faid, They 
would have nothing to do with me any more, neither 
on board, nor on Shore ; and if I came. on board, they 
would go on Shore. Well, faid the Captain, if you are 
all of this Mind, let me go on Shore, and talk with 
him ; fo away he came to me with this Account» a little 
after the Meflage had been brought to me from the 
Cockfwain. 

I was very glad to fee my Nephew, I muft confefs ; 
for I was not without Apprehenfions, that they would 
confine him by Violence, fet fail, and run away with 
the Ship ; and then I had been ftript naked in a remote 
Country, and nothing to help myfelf : In (hört, I had 
been in a worfe.Cafe, than when I was all alone in the 
Iflahd. 

But they had not come that Length, it feems, to my 
great Sarisfadion ; and when my Nephew told me what 
they had faid to him, and bow they had fworn, and 
fhook Hands, that they would one and all leave the 
Ship, if I was fuffered to come on board, I told hin, 
He fhouid not be concerned at it at all, for I would 
flay on Shore : I only defired he wonld take Care and 
fehd me all my neccflary things on Shore, and leave me 
a fufficient Sum of Money, and I would find my Way to 
England in well as I could. 

. This was a heavy Piece of News to my Nephew ; bat 
there was no Way to help it, but to comply with it. 
So in (hört, he went on board the Ship again, and fatif- 
üed the Men, that bis Uncle had yielded to their Im- 
port unity, and had fent for his Goods from on board 
ihc Ship. So the Matter was over in a very few 

Houra; 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. *8r 

Heran j the Men returncd to their Duty, and I begun to 
confidef what Courfe I ihould fteer. 

I was now alone in the remoteft Part of tbe World, 
as I think I may call it ; for I was near three thoufand 
JLeagues, by Sea, farther off from England, than I was 
at my Ifland ; only, it is true, I might travel here by 
Land over the Great MoguPs Country to Surat, might 
go from thence to Baffbra by Sea, up the Gulph of 
Perfia, and from thence might take the Way of the Ca- 
ravans, over the Defarts of Arabia to Alefpo and Scan- 
derom ; from thence by Sea again to Italy, and fo over 
Xand ihto Fronet ; and this, put together, might be, at 
leaft, a füll Diametcr of the Globe j b.ut, if it were to 
be meafured, I fuppofe it would appear to be a great 
deal more. , 

I had another Way before me, which was to wait 
for fome Eng/iß Ships, which were coming to Bengal, 
from Achin % on the Ifland of Sumatra, and get Paflage 
pn board them for England: But as I came hicher with- 
out any Concern with the Eng/iß Eafi-lndia Company, 
fo it would be difficult to go from hence without their 
Liccnce, unlefs with great Favour of the Captains of 
the Ships, or of the Company YFaäors j and to both 
I was an utter Stranger. 

Here I had the particular Pleafure, fpeaking by con~ 
traries, to fee the Ship fet fail without me ; a Treat- 
xnent, I think, a Man in my Circumftances, fearce ever 
met with, except from Pirates running away with a 
Ship, and fetting thofe that would not agree with their 
Villainy, on Shore : Indeed, this was the next Door to 
it, both Ways : However, my Nephew left me two Ser- 
vants, or rather, one Com panion, and one Servant; 
the fifft was Clerk to the Purfer, whom he engaged to 
go with me ; ' and the other was his own Servant : I 
took me alfo a good Lodging in the Houfe of an Eng» 
Uß Woman, wnere feveral Merchants lodged, fome 
Frencby two ha Hans, or rather Jews, and one Engliß* 
man.. Here I was handfomtly enough entertain'd ; and, 
that I might not be faid to run ramly upon any thing, I 
ftayed here above nine Months, confidering what Courfe 
- to take, and how to manage myfelf : I had fome Eng/iß 
Goods with me, of Value, aud & coi&dm&ta. ^^w <&

Money, my Nephew farnifhing me with a thoufand 
Picccs of Eight, and a Letter of Credit for more, if I 
had Occafion, thatlmight not be ftreightened, whatever 
might happen. 

I quickly difpofcd of my Goods, and to Advantage 
too ; and, as I originally intended, I bougbt here fome 
very good Diamonds, which, of all other things, was 
the moft proper fbr mc, in my Crrcumftances, beeaafe 
I might always carry my whole Eftate abont me. 

After a long Stay here, and many Propofals made for 
my Return to England, but nene faüing to my Mind, 
the Eftgliß Merchant, who lodged with me, and with 
whom I had contraßed an intimate Acquaintance, came 
to me one Morning ; Coantryman, fays he, I have a 
Projeft to communicate to you, which, as it fuits with 
my Thoughts, may, for aught I know, foit with yours 
alfo, when you (hall have thoroughily confidered it. 

Here we are pofted, fays he, you by Accident, and 
I by my own Choicc, in a Part of the World very re- 
mote from our own Coantry ; but it is in a Country, 
where, by U3, who underftand Trade and Bofinefs, a 
great desl of Money is to be got : If you will put a 
thoufand Pounds to my thoufand Pounds, we will hire 
a Ship here, the firft we can get to our Mirts ; yoo 
lhall be Captain, TU be Merchant ; and we will go a 
trading Voyage to China ; for what fhould we ftand 
flill for ? The whole World is in Motion, rollin g round 
and round ; all the Creatures of God, heavenly ßodies, 
and earthly, are bufy and diligent : Why fhould we be 
idlc ? Therc are no Drones, fays he, living in the World 
but Men : Why fhould we be ofthat Number ? 

I liked this Propofal very well, and the more, becaufe 
it feemed to be exprefled with fo much good Will, and 
in !o frlendly a Manner : I will not fay but that I might, 
by my loofe and unhingeJ Circumftances, be the fetter 
to embrace a Propofal for Trade, and, indeed, for any 
thing c\{q ; or, otherwifc, Trade was none of my Ele- 
ment : Howcver, I might, perhaps, fay, with fome 
Truth, That if Trade was not my Element, Ramblin* 
*'*s ; and no Prop-Tal for feeing any Part of the World 
^bich I had never feen before, could poffibly come a- 
***& to mc. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 183 

It was, however, fome Time before we could get a 
Ship to our Mind ; and when we got a VefTel, it was not 
cafy to get Eng/iß Sailors ; that is to fay, fo many as 
were necefiary to govern the Voyage, and manage the 
Saiiors which we (hould pick 11p there : After fome Time 
we got a Mate, a Boatfwain, and a Gunner, Engliß ; a 
ZW£ Carpenter, and three PortUgue/e Foremaft Men ; with, 
thefe, we found, we could do well enough, having Indian 
Seamen, fuch as they are, to make op. 

There are fo many Travellers, who have written the 
Hiftdry of thcir Voyages and Travels this Way, that it 
would be but very little Diverfion to any Body, to give 
a long Account of the Places we went to, and the People 
who inhabit there : Thofe things I leave to others, and 
refer the Reader to thofe Journals and Travels of £»- 
glijbmcn, many of which. Ifind, are publifhcd, and more 
promifed everv Day : It is enough for me to teil you, 
That we made the Voyage to Achin, in the Jfland ot 
Sumatra, firft ; and from thence to Siam, where we ex- 
changed fome öf our Wares for Opium, and for fome 
Arrack ; the firft, a CommdÜity which be^ars a great 
Price among the Cbinefi, and which, at that Time, was 
very much wanted there : In a Word, we went up to 
Sufiam, made a very great Voyage, were eight Months 
out, and returned to Bengali and I was very will fatif- 
fied with my Adventure. I obferve that our People in 
England often admire how the Öfficers^ wbich the Com- 
pany fend into Indta, and theMerchants which generally 
ftay there, get fuch very great Eftates as they do, and 
fometimes come Hom* worth fixty, to feventy, and an 
hundred thoufand Pounds at a Time. 

Bat it is no Wonder, or, at leaft, we fhall fee fo much 
farther into it, when we confider the innumerable Ports 
and Places where they have a free Commerce, that it 
will then be no Wonder ; and much lefs will it be fo, 
when we confider, that at all thofe Places and Ports, 
where the Engliß Ships come, there is fo much, and fuch 
conftant Demand for the Grow th of all other Countries, 
that there is a cert.iin Vent for the Return, as well as a. 
Market abroad for the Goods carried out. 

In (hört, we made a very good Voyage* and l «je*. <a

into the Method of getting morc, that, had I bcen twerity 
Years younger, I (hould havebeen tempted to bare ftayed 
here, and fouoht no farther for making my Fortune : But 
what was all thxs to a Man on the wrong Side of Tbree- 
fcore ; that was rieh enough, and came abroad more ia 
Obcdicnce to a reftlefs Defire of feeing the World, than 
a covetous Defire of getting in it ? And, indeed, I think, 
it is with great Jullice that I now call it a reftlefs Defire; 
for it was fo ; when I was at Home, I was reftlefs to go 
abroad ; and now I was abroad, I was reftlefs to be at 
Home : I fay, What was this Gain tome? I was rieh 
enough already ; nor had I any uneafy Defires about 
;etting more Money ; and therefore, the Profus of the 
/oyage to me, were things of no great Force to me, for 
the prompting me forward to farther Undertakings : Hence 
I thought, that by this Voyage I had made no Progrefs 
at all; becaufe I was come back, as I might call it, to 
the Place from whence I came, as to an Home ; whereas» 
my Eye, which, like that which Sclomon fpeaks of, was 
fi*ver fatisfed *witb feeing y was ftill more dehrous of wan- 
dering and feeing. I was come into a Part of the World 
which I never was in before ; and that Part in particular 
which I had heard much of; and was refolved to fee as 
much of it as I could ; and then I thought, I might fay, 
I had feen all the World that was worth feeing. 

But my Fellow-Traveller and I had difFerent Notions %. 
I do not name this, to infift upon my own, for I ac- 
knowledge his was the moft juft, and the moil fuited to 
the End of a Merchant's Life; who, when he is abroad 
upon Adventures, it is his Wifdom to ftick to that, as the 
beft thing for him, which he is like togetthe nwft Money 
by : My new Friend kept himfelf to the Nature of the 
thing, and would have been content to have gone like a 
Carrier's Horfe, always to the fame Inn, backward and 
forward, provided he could, as he called it, find hi,s Ac- 
count in it : On the other Hand, mine, as old as I was, 
was the Notion of a mad rambling Boy, that never cares 
to fee a thing twice over. 

But this was not all; I had a Kind of Impatience 
«pon me to be nearer Home, and yet the moft unfettled 
Resolution imaginable, which Way to go : In the Inter« 
v&l of thete Confukaüons, my Friend» wko was always 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. i&£ 

upon thc Search for Bufinefs, propofed another Voyage to 
nie, *vix. among thc Spiee- Ifland*; and to bring Home a 
Load of Cloves from the Manillas, or thereabouts ; Place» 
where, indeed, the Dutch do trade ; but thelflands belong 
partly to.tbe Spaniards; though we went not fo far, but to 
lome otber, where they have not the wl.ole Power as the/ 
have at Batwia, Ceylon, &c. We were not long in pre- 
paring for this Voyage ; the chief Difficulty was, in bring« 
ing me to corae into it ; however, at laß, nothing elfeof- 
fering, and Unding that really ftirfing about, and Trading, 
the Profit being fo great, and, as I may fay, certain, had 
siore Pleafure in it, aed more Satisfa&ion to ihe Mind, 
than fitting öill * which, to me efpecially, was the un- 
jiappieft Part of Life» I refolved on this Voyage too ; 
which we made vtry fuccefsfully, touching at Bomeo, 
and feveral Iflands, whofe Names I do not remember, 
and came Home in about five Months : We fold oar 
Spiee, which was chiefiy Cloves, and fome Nutmegs, 
tp the Perfian Merchants, who carried them away for the 
Gulph ; and, making near five of one, we really got a 
great dcal of Money. 

My Friend, when we made up this Account, fmüed 
at me : Well now, faid he, with a Sort of an agreeable 
Infalt apon my indolent Temper, is not this becter than 
Walking about here, like a Man of not hing to do, and 
fpcndipg our Time in ftaring at the Nonfenfe and Jg- 
norance of the Pagans ? Why truly, faid I, my Friend^ 
I think it is ; and I begin to be a Convert to the Princi- 
ples of Merchandizing i but 1 muH teil you, faid I, by 
the Way, you do not know what I am a doing ; for if 
once I conquer my Backwardnefs, and imbark heartily, 
as old as I am, I (hall harrafs you up and down the 
World tili I üre you ; for I mall purfue it fo eagerly, I 
lhall never let you lie Hill. 

But to be (hört with my SpecuJations : A little while 
after this, there came in a Dutch Ship from Batav/'a ; 
ihe was a Coafter, not an European Trader, and of about 
two hundred Tons Bürden : TheMen, as they pretended, 
having been fo fickly, that the Captain had not Men 
enough to go to Sea with, he lay by at Be*gal-, and, as 
if having got Money enough, pr being wiliing, for other 
Reafons, to go for Europe, he g&ve ^WüYvOfc ^1<vj£& % ^^

how or other, we ftiQ'uld have feen Reafon to have fuf- 
pecled them ; but the Man fliewed us a Bill of Säle for 
the Ship, to one Emanuel Cloßerßpven, ör fome fuch Name 
(for I fuppofe it was all a Forgefy), and called himfelf by 
that Name ; and we could not contradift him ; and, being 
withal a little too unwary, or, at leaft, having no Sufpicion 
of the thing, we went through with our Bargain. 

However, we picked up fome Englifi Seamen here after 
tnis, and fome Dutch ; and we now refolved for a fecond 
Voyage to the South- eaft, for Cloveß, fcff. that is tofay, 
among the Philippine and Malacca Iffes ; and, in (hört, not 
to fill this Part of my Stör)' with Trifles, vvhen what is 
yet to come is fp remarkable, I fpent, from firft to laft, 
fix Years in this Couhtry, tracing from Port to Pörr> 
backward and forward, ahd with very good Succefs ; 
and was now the laß Year with my Partner, going in 
the Ship abovementioned, on a Voyage to China ; but 
defigning firft to Siam, to buy Rice. 

In this Voyage, being, by contrary Winds, obliged to-. 
beat up and down a great whilc in the Streights of Ma- 
lacca, and among the Iflands, we w'ere no fooner got clear 
of thofe difficult Seas, but we found our Ship had fprung 
a Leak, and we were notable, by all our Jnduilry, to find 
out where it was. This forc'd us to make for fome Port; 
Und my Partner, who knew the Country better than I did, 
direcled the Captain to put into the River of Cambodia ;. 
for I had made the Ehgliß Mate, one Mr. Thompftm, Cap- 
tain, not being wüling tö takc the Charge of the Ship lip- 
on myfelf : This River lies on the North-fide of the great 
Bay or Gulph, which goes up to Siam. 

While we were here, and going often on Shore for Re- 
frefhment, there comes to me one Day an Rnglißtnan, 
and he was, it feems, a Gunner's Mate on board an En- 
gliß Eaß-lndia Ship, which rode in the fame River, up 
at, or near the City of. Cambodia ; what brought him hi- 
ther we knew not $ but he comes up to me, and, fpeak- 
ing Englißt Sir, fays he, you are Stranger to me, and I 
to you ; but I have fomethicg to teil you, that. very near. 
\y concerns you. 

I looked fteadily at him a good while, and he thought 
at firit I had knowh him, but I did not : If it very nearly 
concerns we, h\d I, and not yottffc\£% %\t& im*«* ^^ .

to teil it nie ? I am moved, fays he» by the imminent 
Danger you are in ; and, for aught I fee, you have na 
Knowledge of it: I know no Danger lam in, faid I, but 
that my Snip is leaky, and I c an not find it out ; but I 
propofe to lay her aground To-morrow, to fee tt I caa 
find it. But, Sir, fays he, leaky, or not leaky, find it, ' 
or not find it, you will be wifer than to lay your Ship- 
on Shore To morrow, when you hear what I haveto Tay 
to you : Do you know, Sir, faid he, the Town of Cam~ 
bodia lies about fifteen Leagues up this River ? and there 
are two large Engliß Ships about five Leagues on thisSide, 
and three Dutcb. Well, faid I, and what is that tome? 
Why, Sir, fays he, is it for a Man that is upon fuch Ad- 
ventures as you are, to come into aPort, and not examine 
firft what Ships there are there, and whether he is ableto 
deal with them r I fuppofe you do not think you are a 
Match for them. I was amufed very much at his Dif- 
courfe, but not amazed at it ; for I could not conceive 
what he meant ; and I turned (hört upon him, and faid, 
Sir, 1 wifh you would explain yourfelf ; I cannot imagine 
whatReafon l have tobe afraid of any of the Companys 
Ships, or Dutcb Ships ; 1 am no Interloper; what can 
they have to fay to me ? 

He looked like a Man half angry, half pleafed ; 
and, paufing awhile, büt fmiling, Well, Sir, fays he, if 
you think yourfelf fecure, you muß take your Chance; 
I am forry your Fate (hould blind you againft good 
Advice ; but aflure yourfelf, if you do not put to 
Sea immediately, you will the very next Tide, he 
attacked by five Long-boats füll of Men ; and, per« 
haps, if you are taken, you will be hanged for a Pi- 
rate, and the Particulars oe examined inco afterwards : I 
thought, Sir, added he, l fhould have met with a bet- 
ter Reception than this, for doirvg you a Piece of Ser- 
vice of fuch Importance. I can never be ungrateful, 
faid I, for any Service, or to any Man that offers me 
anyKindnefs; b-Jt it is paft my Compreheitiion, faid 
I, what they fhould have fuch a Defign upon me for : 
However, fmee you fay there is no Time to be loft, 
and that there is fome villainous Defign in hand againft 
me, I will go on board this Minute, and put to Sea im- 
*nedi&tc)y M if my Men caa ftop the Le&k, or if we can 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 189 

fwira without ftopping it: But, Sir, faid I, {hall I go 
away Ignorant of the Reafon of all this ? Can you give 
me no farther Light itito it ? 

I can teil you bdt Part of the Story, Sir, fays he; 
büt I have aDutch Seaman here with me, and, I be- 
lieye, I could perfuade him to teil you the reib ; but 
there is fcarce Time for it : But the {hört of the Story 
is this, the firft Part of wbich; I fuppofe, you know 
well enough, <viz. that you were with this Ship at Su- 
matra ; that there your Captain was murdered by the 
Ma/aecans, with three of bis Men ; and that you, or fome 
of thofe that were on board with you, ran away with 
the Ship, and are finceturncd PIRJTES. This is the 
Sum of the Story, and you will be all.fcized as Pirates, 
I can aflure you, andexecuted with very little Ceremony ; 
for you know Merchants Ships ftiew but little Law to Pi- 
rates, if they get them in their Power. 

Now you fpeak piain Englifl, faid I, and I thank 
you ; and though I know nothing that we have done, 
iike what you talk of, but I am füre we carne honeftly 
and fäirly by the Ship, yet, feeing fuch Work is a do- 
ing, as you fay, and that yöu feem to mean honeftly, 
i will be upon my Guard. Nay, Sir, fays he, do not 
talk of being upon your Guard; the beft Defence is to be 
out of the Danger ; if you have any Regard to your 
Life, and the Lives of all your Men, put out to Sea 
without fail at High-water ; and as you have a whoie 
Tide beföre you, you will be gone too fax out before 
they can come down ; for they will come away at 
High-water ; and as they have twenty Miles to come, 
you get near two Hours of them, by the DifFerence 
of the Tide, not reckoning the Length of the Way : 
Befides, as they are only Boats, and not Ships, thev 
will not venture to follow you far out to Sea, efpeciaüy 
if it blows. 

Well, faid I, you have been very kind in this : What 
fliall I do for you, to make you Amends? Sir, fays he, 
you may not be fo willing to make me Amends, be- 
caufe you may not be convinced of the Truch of it : I 
will make an Offer to you ; I have nineteen Months Pay 
due to me on board the Ship , which I came out 

of England in ; and the Dutcbm*n> that is with me, has 

San vjk 



«90 tt* Life and Adventures-c/ 

fcven Months Pay due to him; if you will make good 
our Pay to us, we will go along with you ; if you 
find nothing more in it, we will defire no more ; but.if 
we do convince you, that we have faved your Life, and 
the Ship, and the Lives of all the Men in her, we will 
leave the reft to you. 

I confented to this readily ; and went immediately on 
board, and the two Men with me. As foon as I came 
to the Ship-fide, my Partner, who was on board, came 
out on the Quarter-deck, and called to me, with jsl great 
deal pf Joy, O ho ! O ho ! we have ilopped the Leak l 
we have ftopped the Leak! Say you fo, faid I, thank 
God; but weigh the Anchor then imraediately : Weigh f 
fays he : What do you mean by that ? What is the Mat- 
ter ? fays he. Aik no Queftions, faid I, but all Hands to 
work, and weigh, without lofing a Minute: He was für- 
prifed : But, however, he called the Captain, and he im* 
mediately ordered the Anchor to be got up; and though 
the Tide was not quite done, yet a littleLand-breeze blow- 
ing, we ftood out to Sea: Then I called him into the Ca- 
bin, and told him the Story, at large; and we called in. 
the Men, and they told us the red of it ; but as it took 
vs up a great deal of Time, fo before we had done, a 
Seaman comes to the Cabin-door, and calls out to us, 
that the Captain bade him teil us, we were chafed 
Chafed, faid I, by whoni, and by what ? By fiveSloops, 
orBoats, faid the .Fellow, füll of Men. Very well, faid 
I ; then it is apparent there is (bmeching in it. Ia the 
next Place, I ordered all our Men to be called up ; and . 
told them, That there was a Defign to feize the Ship, 
and to take us for Pirates ; and afeed them, If they 
would Hand by us, and by one anocher ? The Men an- 
fwered, chearfully, that, one and all, they would live and 
die. with us. Then 1 afked the Captain, What Way hc 
thought bell for us to manage a Fight with them : For, 
refift them I refolved we would, ..and that to the lall 
Drop. He faid, readily, That the V/ay was to keep them 
©ff with our great Shot, as longas we could, and thento 
fire at them wich our fmall Arms, to keep them frqm 
boarding us ; but when reicher of thefe would do any 
. longer, we fhould retire to our elpfe Quarters ; perhaps 
th?y had not Materials to br&ltqpenour Bulk-heads, .or 
. jget in apon us. Tbc

The Gunner had in the mean Time, Orders to bring 
wo Guns to bear fore and aft, out of the Stee rage, to 
lear the Deck, and load thcm with Mufquet-bullets, 
nd fmall Pieces of old Iron, and what next came to 
land ; and thus we m ade. read y for Fight ; but all this 
irhtle kept out to Sea, with Wind enougj}, and could 
ce the Boats al; a Diftance, being five large Long-boats 
bllowing us 9 with all the. Sail they could make. 

Two of tiefe Boats, which, by our Glafles, we 
ould fee, were Englijh, had outfailed the reft, were 
lear two Leagues ahead of them, and gained upon us 
örifiderably ; fo that we found they would come up 
vithos; upon which we fired a Gun without a Shot, 
9 intimate that they fhould bring to ; and we put out a 
? lag of Truce, as a Signal* for Parley; but they kept 
rrowding after us, tili they came within Shot : Upon 
his we took in our white Flag, they having made no 
\nfwer to it, hung out the red Flag, and fired at them 
vith Shot : Not with flanding this, they came on tili 
hey were nearenough to call to them with a fpeaking 
Trampet, which we had on board ; fo we called to 
them, and bade them keep offat their Peril. 

It was all one, they crowded after us, and endeavoured 
tri come under our Stern, fo to board us on our Quar- 
ter : Upon which, feeing they were refolute for Mifchief, 
ind depended opon theStrength that followed them, I

Broadfide, when immediately we fired five Guns at them ; 
one of which had been levelled fo true as to carry away

becaufe we faw the reft of the Boats began to

Orders, and took up three Men ; one of which was 

juft drowning, and it was a good while before we could 

recover hini. As foon as they were on board, we 

crowdcd all the Sail we could raake, and ftood farther

t into the Secret of it at once ; telling us, That the Fel- 

low that fold us the Ship, as we faid, was no rnore thaa 

Thicf, that had run away with her. Then he told us 

w the Captain, whofc Name too he mentioned, though 

1 not remember it now, was treacheroufly murdered 

1 .he Natives on theCoaft of Ma/acca, with three ofhis 
*Jen ; and that he, this Dutchman, and four more, got in- 
to the Woods, where they wandered about a great while; 
tili at length, hc in particular, in a miraculous Manner, 

. made hu Efcapc, and fwam ofF to a Dutch Ship, which 
failing near the Shore, in its Way from China, had fent 
their ßoat on Shore for frcfli Water ; that he dürft not 

* come to that Part of the Snore where "the Boat was, but 
made Hilft in the Night, to take in the Water farther off, 
and, fwimming a great while, at lafl the Ship's Boat took 
him up. 

He then told us, That he went to Batavia, where two 
oftheSeamen, belonging to the Ship, had arrived, hav- 
ing deferted the reft in their Travels ; and gave an Ac- 
count, That the Fcllow who had run away with the Ship, 
fold her at Bengal to a Set of Pirates, which were gone a 
craiÄng in her; and that they had already taken an Engliflj^ 
Ship, andtwoZ)«/o&Ships, very ric/ily laden. 

This latter Part we found to concern us dire&ly, and 
though we knew it to be falfe, yet, as my Partner faid 
very well, if we had fallen into their Hands, and they 
ha 1 had fuch a Prepoffefüon againft us beforehand, it had 
been in vain for usto have defendcd ourfclves, or to hopc 
for any good Quarters at their Hands ; efpecially confider- 
ing that our Accufers had been our Judges, and that we 
could have expefted nothing from the 01 but what Rage 
would have di&ated, and ungoverned Pafiion have exe- 
cuted. And therefore it was his Opinion, we fhould go 
direCUy back to Bengal, from wlence we came, without 
puttingin at any Port whatever; becaufe there we could 
give an Account of ourfelves, and could prove where we 
werewhen the Ship put in, whom we bought her of, and 
the like ; and which was more than all the red, if we 
were put to the Neceflity of bringing it before the proper 
Judges, we fhould be füre to have fome Jufticej and not 
be hanged firft, and judged afterward,

I was fometime of my Partner'« Opinion ; but aftef 
a lictle more fcrious thinking, I told him, I thoaght it 
was a very great Hazard for us to attcmpt returning to 
Bengale for that we were on the wrong Side of the 
Streights of Malacca ; and that if the Alarm was given, 
we fhould be füre to be way-laid on. every Side, as well 
by the Duttb of Batavia, as the Engliß eifewhere ; that 
if we fhould be taken, as it were, running away, wc 
fhould even condemn ourfclves, and there would want 
no more Evidence to deftroy us. I alfo afked the Engliß 
Sailor's Opinion, who faid, He was of my Mind, and 
that we fhould certainly be taken. 

This Danger a lictle ilartled my Partner, and all the 
Ship's Company ; and we iramediately refolved to go 
away to the Coafl of Tonqutn t and fo on to China ; and 
from thence purfuing the firft Defign, as to Trade, find 
fome Way or other to difpofe of the Ship, and come 
back in fome of the VefTels of the Country, fuch as we 
could get. This was approved of as the beft Mcthod 
for our Security ; and accordingly we fteered away 
N. N. E. keeping above fifty Lcagues off from the ufaal 
Courfe to the Eaftward. 

This, hewevcr, put us to fome Inconveniencies ; for 
firft, the Winds, when we came to that Diftance from 
the Shore, feemed to be more fteadily againft us, blow- 
ing almoft Trade, as we call it, from the Eaft, and 
E. N. E. fo that we were a long while upon our Voy- 
age ; and we were but ill provided with Victuals for fo 
long a Run ; and, which was ßill worfe, there was fome 
Danger, that thofe Engliß and Dutch Ships, whofe Boats 
purfued us, whereof fome were bound that Way, might 
De gotin before us ; and if not, fome other Ship; bound 
to China, might have Information of us from them, and 
purfue us with the fame Vigour. 

I mufl confefs, I was now very uneafy, and thougot 
myfelf, including the late Efcape from the Long-boats, 
to have been in the moft dangerous Condition that ever 
I was in through all my paft Life ; for, whatever ill Cir« 
cumftances I had been in, I was never purfued for i 
Thief before ; nor had I ever done any thing that 
merited the Name of difhoneft, or fraudulent, mucii 
kfs thieviih. I had datefy Wti taine own Enemy 
4 <& 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 195 

Or, äs I may rightly fay, I had been nobody's Enemy 
bat my own. But now I was embarrafled in the worft 
Condition imaginable ; for thoagh I was perfeclly in- 
nocent, I was in no Condition to make that Innocence 
appear. And if I had been taken, it had been under a 
fuppofed Guilt of the worfl Kind ; at leaft, a Crime 
efteemed fo among the People I had to do wich. 

1 This made m; very anxious to make an Efcape, though 
which Way to do it, I knew not ; or whatPort or Place 
we (hould go to. My Partner, feeing me thus dejeded, 
though he was the moft concerned at firft, beganto en- 
coarage me^ and defcribing to me the feveral Ports of 
that Coaft, told me, He would put in on the Coaft of 
Cochincbina, or the Bay ofTonquin; intending to go after- 
wards XoMacaoy a Town once in the Pofleffion of the For» 
tuguefe, and where ftill a greatmany European Families re- 
fided, and particulärly the Miffionary Priefts ufually went 
thither, in order to their going forward to China. 

Hither then we refolved to go ; and accordingly, 
though after a tedious and irregulär Courfe, and very 
inuch ftreightened for Provifions, we came within Sight 
of the Coaft very early in the Morning; and, upon Re- 
fle&ion upon the paft Circumftances we were in, and the 
Danger, if we had not efcaped, we refolved to put into 
a finall River, which, however, had Depth enough of 
Water for us, and to fee if we could, either over Land, 
or by the Ship's Pinnace, come to know what Ships were 
in any Port thereabouts. This happy Step was, indeed, 
our Deliverance ; for though we did not immediately fee 
any European Ships in the Bay of Tonquin, yet, the next 
Morning, there cameinto the Bay two Dutcb Ships, and 
a third without any Colours fpread out, but which we 
believed to be a Dutchman, pafled by at about two 
Leagues Diftance, ßeering for the Coaft of China ; and 
in the Afternoon went by two Engliß Ships, fteering the 
fame Courfe ; and thus, we thought, we faw ourfelves 
befet with Enemies, both one Wäy and the other. The 
Place we were in was wild and barbarous, the People 
Thieves, even by Occupation or Profeflion ; and though, 
it is true, we had not much to feek of them, and, ex- 
cept getting a few Provifions, cared not how little we 
had to do with them, yet it was v*W\ xnq&\l 'CÄfcvÄfci

that we kcpt durfelrcs fxcm bring infultcd by thenv 

feveral Ways. 

W« wcrc in a fmall River of thisCountry, within ft 
few Leagues of ics atmoft Limits Northward ; and *by 
our Boat we coafted North-eaft to the Point of Land 
which opens to the great Bay ofTtxquin; and it was|in 
this bcating-up along the Shore, that we difcovered as 
above, that in a Word, wc were fürrounded with Ene- 
inies. The People we were among were the moft bar« 
barous of all the Jnhabitants of the Coaft ; having no 
Correfpondence with any other Nation, and dealing 
only in Fiih, and Oil, and fuchgrofs Commodities; and 
it may be particalarly feen, that they are, as I faidL, the 
moft barbarous of any of the Inhabitants ; <viz. that 
among other Cußom* they have this one, That if any 
Veffel have the Misfortune to be fhipwrecked upon their 
Coaft, they prefently make thcMen all Prifoners ; that 
is to fay, Slaves : And it was not long before we found 
a Spiee of their Kindnefs this Way, on the Occafion 
following. 

I have obferved above, that our Ship fprang a Leak 
at Sea, and that we could not find it out; and however 
it happened, that, as I have faid, it was ftopped unex- 
peäedly, in the happy Minute of our being to be fel?xß, 
by the Dutch and Engliß Ships, near the Bay of.Sta»; 
* yet, as we did not 'find. thje^Wp^fouperfeialy tight amf . 
found as we defired, we refblv!ed,. whlk \^e were in this 
Place, to lay her on Shore, take out Vwhat heavy things. 
w'e had on board, which were not many, and to waffi 
and clean her Bottom ; • and, if pofiible, to find out 
where the Leaks were. 

Accordingly, having lightened the Ship, and brougbt 
allourGuns, and other moveable things, to one Side, . 
we tried to bring her down, that we might come at her 
Bottom; for, on fecond Thoughts, we did not careto 
lay her dry aground, neither could we find out a proper 
Place for it. 

The Inhabitants who had neverbeen acquainted with 

fuch a Sight, came wondering down to the Shore, to 

look at us ; and feeing the fchip lie down oa one Side 

in fuch a Manner, and beding towards the Shore, and 

^ot ieeJng our Men, who were at work on her Bot»-

töm, with Stages, and with their Boats on the Qff fide, 
they prefently concluded, that the Ship was call away, 
and lay 4b very faft on the Ground. 

On this Suppofition they came all about us in two or 
three HoursTime, with ten or twelve lar&e Bbats, having 
ibme of them eight, fome ten Men in a Boat, intending, 
do doubt, to have come on board, and plundered the 
Ship, and if they had found us there, to havecarried us 
away for Slaves to their King, orwhatever they call him, 
for we knew nothrng who was their Governor. 
" When they came up to the Ship, and began to row 
round her, they difcovered us all hard at Work, on the 
Outfide of the Ship's Bottom and Side, waihing, and 
gravi ng, and ftopping, as every Seafaring Man knowa 

AOW. 

They ftood for awhile gazing at us, and we, who 
were a little furprifed, could not imagine what their 
Sefign was ; but, being willing to be füre, we took 
this Opportunity to get fome of as into the Ship, and 
pthers to hand down Arms and AmVnunition to thofe 
that were at Work, to defend themfelves with, if there 
fhould be Occafion ; and it was no more than Need ; 
for,« »n lefs. than a Quarter of an Hour's Confultation, 
t^ey agreed, it feems, that the Ship was really a Wreck ; 
that we wete all at Work,, endeavouring to fave her, or 
•to fave out Lives by the*H«lp©f our Boats ; and when 
we handed our jArm« into the Boats, they concluded, 
by that Motion, that we were endeavouring to fave 
fome of out Goods : Upon this they took it for granted 
they all belonged to them ; and away they came di- 
rectly upon our Men, as if it had been in a Line of 
Battle. 

Our Men, feeing fo many of them, began to be 
flrighted; for we lay but in an ill Pofture to fight, and 
crled out to us to know what they fhould do. I im- 
mediately called to the Men who workcd upon the 
Stages, to flip them down, and get up the Side into 
the Ship ; and bade thofe in the Boat to row round, and 
come on board ; and thofe few of us who were on 
board, worked with all the Strength and Hands we 
had, to bring the Ship to rights; but, however, neither 
die Men upon the Stage, nor thofe ifc \\ä Bsä2ä* <aw2A>

lipon them ; and, with two of their Boatt boarded our 
• Long- boat, and beganto lay hold of the Men as their 
Prifoners. 

The firft Man they laid hold of was an EmgU/t Seaman 
a ftoat ftrong Fellow, who having a Mofqoet in his Hand» 
never offered to fire it, bat laid it down in the Boat, like 
* Pool, as I thooght. Bot he underftood his Bufiriefs bet-

Dutcbma* % wko ftood next, took up the Mafquet, and 
with theBut-endof it, fo laid about him, that heknocked 
down live of them, who attemptedto enteren« Boat; bot 
this was little towards refifting thirty or forty Men, who 
fearleft, becaofe ignorant of their Danger, began to thrbw ' 
themfelves in(o che Long- boat, whercw^had bat fiff 
Men to defend it : ■• Bat one Acddc*ra*ve ow Men a 
c^mplete Viftory, which deferved our Langhter rathcr 
than any thing elfe ; and that was this : 

Our Carpenter bcing prepared to grave the Outfide 
of the S'ip, as well as to pay the Seamr where he had 
caulked her, to dop the Leaks, had got two Kcttles jafc 
let down into the Boat ; one filled with boiling Pitch* 
and thc other with Rofin, Tallow, and Oil, and fach 
ätufF as the Shipwrights ufe for that Work ; and the 
Man that tended the Carpenter, had a great iron La- 
die in his Hund, with which he fupplied the Men that 
were at Work with that hot Stuff; two of thc Entrmy'i 
Men entcrcd the Boat juft where this Fellow ftood, 
being in the Forefheets ; he immediately falated them 
with a Ladlefull of the Stuft", boiling het, which fo 
burnt and fcalded them, being half-naked, that they 
roared out like two Bulls, and enraged with the Fire, 
leaped both into the Sea. The Carpenter faw it, and 
cried out, Well done, Jack, give them fome more of 
it; when ftepping forward himfelf,- he tikes on« of 
their Mops, and drpping it in the Pitch-pot, he and his 
Man threw it among them fo plentifully, that, in (hört,

was not fcalded and burnt with it in a roofl frightful 
pitiful Manner, and made fach an Howling and Crying, 
that I never heard a worfe Noife, and, indecd, nothing 
like it; for it is worth obferving, That thoogh Pain na- 
turally makes all People cry out, yet every Nation have 
a particular Way of Exclamatioa, and make Noifes as 
difFerent from one another as their Speech. I cannot 
give the Noife thefe Creatures made, a better Name 
than Howling, nor a Name more proper to the Tone of 
it ; for I never heard any thing m©re like the Noife of 
the Wolves,. which, as I have faid, I heard hovvl in the 
Foreft on the Frontiers of Languedoc. 

I was never pleafed with a Viclory better in my Life ; 
not only as it was a perfeft Surprize to me, and jthat our 
Danger was imminent before; but as we got thls Victo- 
ry without any Bloodfhed, except of that Man the Fel- 
iow killed witn his naked Hands, and which I was very 
mach concerned at ; for I was fick of kiliing fach poor 
Savage Wretches, even tho' it was in my own Defence, 
knowing they came on Errands which tbey thought juft, 
and knew no better; and that tho' it may be a juiHhing, 
becaufe neceffary, for there is no neceßary Wickednef» 
in Nature ; yet I thought it was. a fad Life, whcn we 
muß be always obliged to be kiliing our Fellow-crea- 
tures to preferve ourfelves; and, indeed, I think fo ßill; 
and I would,. even now, fuffer a great deal, rathe* than 
I would take away the Life even of the worft Perfon in- 
juring me. I believe alfo, all confidering People, who 
know the Value of Life, would be of my Opinion, if 
they entered ferioufly into the Confideration of it. 

But to retarn to my Story : All the while this was do- 
ing, my Partner and I, who managed the red of the Men 
on board, had, with great Dexterity, brought the Ship 
almoft to rights ; and, having gotten their Guns into 
their Places again, the Gunner called to me, to bid our 
Boat get out of the Way, for he would let fly among 
them. I called back again to him, and bid him not of- 
fer to fire, for the Carpenter would do the Work with- 
out him ; but bade him heat another Pitch-kettle ; which 
our Cook, who was on board, took care of. But the 
Enemy was fo terrified with what they met with in their 
ürft Attack, that they would not come on again ; and

fome of them, that were fartheft off, feeing the Shfp 
fwim, as it werc, npright, began, as we fuppofed, to 
fee their Miflake, and gave over the Enterprize, findiag 
it was not as they expe&ed. Thtu we goc dear of this 
merry Fight ; and; having gotten fome Rice, and fomc 
Roots, and Bread, with about fixteen good big Hogs on 
board, two Days before, we refolved to ftay here no 
longer, bat go fbrward, whatever came of it ; for we 
jnade no donbt but we fliould be fnrroimded the next 
Day with Rogues enough, perhaps more than oar Pitch- 
kettle woald difpofc of for as. 

We, therefore, got all oar things on board the fame 
Evening, and the next Morning were ready to fail. In 
the nv*n Time, Iying at an Anchor fome Diftance from 
the Shoic, we were not fo mach concerned, being now 
in a fighting Pofture, as well, as in a faiiing Poftore, if 
any Encmy had prcfented. The next Day, having finita- 
cd our Work within board, and finding oar Ship was 
pcrfe&Iy healed of all her Leaks, we fet ftil ; we wooM 
liave gone into the Bay of fonquin, for we wanted to in- 
fprm ourfelves of what was to be known concerning the 
Dutcb Ships that had been there ; bat we dürft not ßand 
in there, becaufe we had feen fevcral Ships go in, as we 
fuppofed, but a little before ; fb we kept on N. E. to- 
wards the lfle of Formofa > as much afraid of being feen by 
a Dutcb or EngUJh Merchant Ship, as a Dutcb or Englijb 
Merchant Ship in the Meärterranean is of an Jlgtrint 
Man of War. 

When we were thus got to Sea, we kept on N. E. as 
if we woald go to the Mamllas or tbe Fbilippim Iflands ; 
and this we did, that we might not fall into the Way of 
any of the European Ships ; and then we fteered North 
again, tili we came to the Latitude of 22 Deg. 20 Min. 
by vvhich means we made the Ifland of Formofa direäly, 
where we came to an Anchor, in order to get Water and 
frefh Provifions, which the People there, who are very 
courteous and civil in their Manners, fupplied as with 
wiliingly, and dealt very fairly and pundlualiy with os in 
all thcir Agreements and Bargains ; which iswhat we did 
not find among other People ; and may be owing to the 
Remains of Chriftianity, which was once planted here 
by a Dutcb Million ary of Proteßants, and is a Teftixnony 

of 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. *or 

of what I have often obferved ; <viz. That the Chriftianr 
Religion always civilizes the People, and reforms their 
Manners, where it is received, whcther it works faving. 
Effects upon them or no. 

Froni hence we failed flill North, keeping the Coaft 
©f China at an equal Diftance, tili we knew we were 
beyond all the Ports of China, where our European Ships 
ufbally come ; being refolved^ if poflible, notto fall inta 
any of their Hands, efpecially in this Country, where, 
as our Circumüances were, we could not fail of being 
intirely ruined ; nay, fo great was my Fear in particular» 
as to my being taken by them, that I believe firroly, I 
would much rather have chofen to fall into the Hands of 
the Sfanißf Inquifition. 

Being now come to the Latitude of 30 Degrees, we 
refolved to put into the firft trading Port we (hould 
come at ; and, ftanding in for the Shore, a Boat came 
©ff two Leagues to us, with an old Portuguefe Pilot on 
board, who, knowing us to be an European Ship, came 
to offer his Service, which, indeed, we were very glad 
of, and took him on board : Upon which, without aflc- 
sng us whither we would go, he difmiiTed the Boat her 
came in, and fent it back. 

I thought it was now fo much in our Choice, to make* 
the old Man carry us whither we would, that I began te? 
talk with him about carrying of us to the Gulph of Nan- 
quin y which is the moft Northern Part of the Coaft of. 
China. The old Man faid he knew the Gulph of Nan- 
quin very well ; but, fmiling, afked us, what we would. 
do there. 

I told him we would feil our Cargo, and purchafe. 
China Wares, Callicoes, raw Silks, Tea, wrought Silks,, 
&c. and fo- would retürn by the fame Courfe we came- 
He told us our beft Port had been to have put in at Ma- 
cao, where we could not fail of a Market for our Opium,, 
to our Satisfa&ion, and might, for our Money, have 
purchafed all Sorts of China Goods, as cheap as we could. 
at Nanquin. 

Not being able to put the old Man out of his Talk, 
of which he was very opiniated, or conceited, I told' 
him, we were Gentlemen, as well as Merchants-; and 
that we had a Mind to go aud fet && ^ctax ^\Vi <&*

Why then, fays the old Man, you (hould go to Ningpo, 
Where, by thc River whiclrruns into the Sea there, you 
may go up within five Leagues of the Great Canal. This 
CanaT is a navigable made Stroara, which goes through 
the Heart of all that vaft Empire of China ■, croffes all the 
Rivers, paffes fome confiderable Hills, by the Help of 
Sluices and Gates, änd goes up to the City of Pekings 
being in Length near 270 Leagues. 

Well, faid I, Seignior Portuguefe, but that is not out 
Bufinefs now : The great Queftion is, If you can carry 
us up to the City of Nanquin, from whence we can travel 
to Peking afterward s ? Yes, he faid, he couid do fo very 
well, and there was a great Dutch Ship gone up that 
Way juft before. This gave me. a little Shock ; a Dutch 
Ship was now our Terror, and we had much rather 
have met the Devil, at leaft if he had not come in too 
frightful a Figure : We depended upon it, that a Dutch 
Ship would be our Deftru&ion, for we were in no Con- 
dition to fight them j all the Ships they trade with in 
thofe Parts being of great Bürden, and of much greater 
Force than we were. 

The old Man found me a little confufed, and under 
föme Concern, when he named a Dutch Ship ; and faid 
to me, Sir, you need be under no Apprehenfion of the 
Dutch, I fuppofe they are not now at War with your Na- 
tion. No, faid I, that's true ; but I know not what 
Liberties Men may take, when they are out of the Reach 
öf the Laws of their own Country» Why, faid he, yoo. 
are no Pirates, what need you fear ? They will not med- 
die with peaccable Merchants füre. 

If I had any Blood in my Body that did not fly up in., 
to my Face at that Word, it was hindered by fome Stop 
in the Veflels äppointed by Nature to circulate it ; for 
k put me intb the greateft Difofder and Confufion ima-

that the old Man eafily pereeived it. 

Sir, faid he, I find you are in fome Diforder in your 

Thoughts at my Talk ; pray be pleafed to go which 

Way yoti think fit 5 and, depend upon it, Y\\ do you all

fo, for what yon faid about Pirates ; I hope there are uo 
Pirates in thefe Seas ; we are bat in an ill Condition to 
ineet with them ; for you Tee we have but a fmall Force, 
and but very weakly manned. 

O, Sir, faid he, do not be concerned, I do not know, 
that there have been any Pirates in thefe Seas thefe fif- 
teen Years, except one, which was feen, as I hear, in the 
Bay of Siam, about a Month fince ; but you may be af-

of any great Force, or fit for the Work ; flie was not 
built for a Privateer, but was run away with by a repro- 
bate Crew that were on board, after the Captain and 
fome of his Men had been murdered by the Ma/accans, 
at or near the Ifland of Sumatra. 

What ! faid I, feemlng to know nothing of the Mat- 
ter, Did they murder the Captain ? No, faid he, I da 
not underßand that they murdered him ; but, as they 
afterwards ran away with the Ship, it is generally be- 
lieved they betrayed him into the Hands of the Malaccans, 
who did murder him; and, perhaps, they procured them 
to do it. Why then, faid I, they deferve Death, as much 
as if they had done it them fei ves. Nay, faid the old 
Man, they do deferve it; and they will certainly have it, 
if they light upon any Eng/iß or Dutcb Ship ; for they 
have all agreed together, that, if they meet that Rogue, 
they will give him no Quarter. 

But, faid I to him, you fay the Pirate is gone out of 
thefe Seas : How can they meet with him then ? Why, 
that is true, faid he, they do fay fo ; but he was, as I 
teil you, in the Bay of Siam, in the River CambcJia, and 
was difcovered there by fome Dutchmtn who belonged to 
the Ship, and who were left on Shore when they run away 
with her; and fome Eugliß and Dutcb Trädcrs being in 
the River, they were within a little of taking him. Nay, 
feid he, if tjie foremoft Boats had been well feconded by 
the reft, they had certainly taken him ; but he, Unding 
only two Boats within Reach of him, tack'd about, and 
jir'd at thefe two, and difabled them, before the other 
came up$ and then ßanding ofF to Sea, the. other wero 
not able to follow him, and fo he got away. But they

will be füre to know him ; and where- ever they find 
him, they have vowed to give no Quarter to either the 
Captain, or the Seamen, but to hang them all up at the 
Yard -arm. 

What ! faid I, will they execute them right or wrong, 
hang them firft, and judge them afterwärds ? O, Sir! 
faid the old Pilot, there is no need to make a formal 
Bufinefs of it with fuch Rogues as thofe ; let them tie 
them Back to Back, and fet them a diving ; it is no 
jnore than they rightly deferve. 

I knew I had my old Man fad aboard, and that he 
could do me no Harm ; fo that I turned fhort npon him; 
Well, now, Seignior, faid I, and this is the very Reafon 
ivhy I would have you carry us to Nanquin, and not to 
put back to Macea, or to any other Part of the Coun- 
try, where the Engliß or Dutcb Ships come ; for, be it 
known to you, Seignior, thofe Captains of the Englijb 
and Dutcb Ships, are a Parcel of rafh, proud, infolent 
Fellows, that neither know what belongs to Juftice, or 
how to bchave themfelves, as the Laws of God and Na- 
ture direft ; but, bcing proud of their Offices, and not 
underftanding their Power, they would act the Murder- 
crs to punifh Robbers ; would take upon them to infuit 
Mcn falüy accufed, and determine them guilty without 
«lue Inquiry ; and perhaps, I may live to call fome of 
ihem to an Account for it, where they may be taoght 
how Juftice is to be executed ; and that no Man ought 
to be treated as a Criminal, tili fome Evidence may be 
had of the Crime, and that he is the Man. 

With this 1 told him, that this was the vtry Ship they 
had attackedT; and gave him a füll Account of the Skir- 
miih we had with their Boats, and how foolilhly and 
Coward-like they had behaved. I told him all the Sto- 
ry of our buying the Ship, and how the Dutchmen ferved 
us. I told him the Reafons I had to believe, that this 
Story of killing the Marter, by the Malaccans, was not 
true ; as alfo the running away with the Ship ; but that 
it was all a Fielion of their own, to fuggeft that the Men 
were turned Pirates ; and they ought to have been füre 
it was fo, before they had ventured to attack us by Sur- 
prize, aad oblige us to refift them ; adding, that they 

would 



ROBINSON CRUSOE, 20$ 

would have the Blood of thofe Men, who werc killed 
there, in our juft Defence, to anfwer for. 

The old Man was amazed at this Relation ; and told 
us, We were very much hi the Right to go away to the 
North ; and that if he might advife us, it (hould be to 
feil the Ship in China> which we might very well do, and 
bay or build another in the Country : And, faid he, tho* 
you will not get fo good a Ship, yet you may get one 
able enough to carry you and all your Goods back again 
to Bengal, or any -where elfe. 

I told him, I would take his Advice, when I came to 
any Port where I could find a Ship for my Turn, or get 
.any Cuftomer to buy this. He replied, I fhould meet 
with Cuftomers enough for the Ship at Nanqum, and that 
a Chlnefe Junk would ferve me very well to go back again ; 
and that he would procure me People both to buy one, 
and feil the other. 

WeH, but, Seignior, fays I, as you fay they know the 
Ship fo well, I may, perhaps, if f follow yöur Mea- 
fures, be inftrumentai to bring fome honeft innocent Men 
into a terrible Broil, and, perhaps, be murdered in cold 
Blood ; for where- ever they find the Ship, they will prove 
the Guilt upon the Men, by proving this was the Ship ; 
and fo innocent Men may probably be overpowered and 
murdered. Why, faid the old Man, 1*11 find out a Way 
to prevent that alfo ; for as I know all thofe Command- 
ers you fpeak of very well, and (hall fee them all as they 
pafs by, I will be füre to fet them to rights in the thing, 
and let them know, that they had been fo much in the 
Wrong, that though the People who were on hoard at 
firft, might run away with ihe Ship, yet it was not.true, 
that they had turnedPirates; and that in particular, thofe 
were not the Men that firft went off with the Ship, but 
innocently bought her for their Trade ; and I am per- 
fuaded they will fo far believe me, as, at leaft, to adl 
more cautioufly for the Time to come. Well, faid f, 
and will you deliver one MefTage to them from me ? Yes, 
1 will, fays he, if you will give it under your Hand, in 
Writing, that I may be able to prove it came from you, 
and not out of my own Head. I aufvvered, That I would 
readily give it him under my Hand. So I took a Pen, 
and Jmk, and Paper, and wrote at iax%t xYä^\.w>j *A

My old Pilot read this over and over again, and aßced 
me fcveral Times, If I woold ftand to iL I afciwered, I 
would ftand to it as long as I had any thing left in the 
World i being fenfible that I fhoold, one Time or other, 
find an Opportnnity to pat it home to them. Bat we had^. 
no Occafion ever to lct the Pilot carry this Letter ; for' 
he never went back again. White thofe things were paf-' 
fing between us, by way of DHcourfe, we went forward 
direäly fQr Namnm, and, in about thirteen Rays {ail* 
came to an Anchor at the Sonth» Weft Point of the great 
Golph of Naxfmmi where, bv the Way, I came by Äc~ 
cidcnt .to onderftand, that the two Dutcb Shipt wem 

Sne that Lensth before me, and that I fliould certainly 
1 into their Rands. I confolted my Partner again in 
this Exigency, and he was as mnch at a Lofs a£ 1 was, 
and would very gladly bare been fafe on Shore almoft 
any-where. However,, I was not in fach Perplexity nei- 
tber, but I afked the old Pilot, if there was no Creek, 
or Harbour, which I might put into, and purfue my 
Bufinefa with the Cbine/$ privately, and be m no Danger 
of the Enemy ? He told me, if 1 woold fasl to the South- 
ward about two-and -forty Leagues, there was a little 
Port called Quincbang, where' the Fathers of the Minion 
ufually landed from Macao, on their Progrefs to teach . 
the Chriftian Religion to the Cbinefi, and where no- 
European Ships ever put in ; and, if I thought proper to 
put in there, I might conüder what farther Courfe to 
take when I was on Shore. He confefied, he faid, it 
was not a Place for Merchants, except that at fome cer- 
tain Times they had a kind of a Fair there, when the. 
Merchants from Jetfan came over thither to bay the Chi* 
**fi Merchandizes. 

We all agreed to go back to this Place; the Name 
«f the Port, as he called it, I may, perhaps, fpell wrong; 

for 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 207 
.sjfor I do not particularly remember it, having loft this 
k ^ogether with tne Names of many other Places fet down 
5* in a little Pocket-book, which was fpoiled by the Water, 
;, on an Accident which I (hall rclate in it» Order ; but this 

SI remember, that the Cbine/e or Japanefe Merchants we 
•correfpond with, call it by a different Name from that 
>which our Portuguefe Pilot gave it, and pronounced it as 
^ %bove, Qwnchang. 

g" . As we were unanimous in our Refolutions to go to 
: • this Place, we weighed the next Day, having only gone 
twice on Shore, where we were to get freßi Water ; on 
* both which Occafions, the People of the Country were 
[ very civil to us, and brought us Abundance of things to 
feil to as ; I mean of Proviiions, Plants, Roots, Tea, 
, Rice, and fome Fowls ; but nothing without Money. 
We came to the other Port (the Wind being contra - 
17) not tili five Days ; but it was y^xy much to our Sa- 
tisfaclion ; and, I was joyful, anü' I ™ay fay, thankful, 
when I fet my Foot fafe on Shore j refolving, and my 
Partner too, that if it was poffible to difpofe ofourfelves 
and Effe&s any other way, though not every way to our 
Satisfaclion, we would never fet one Foot on board that 
unhappy Veflel more ; and, indeed, I muit acknowledge, 
Chat of all the Circumftances of Life, that ever I had 
any Experience of, nothing makes Mankind fo complete- 
ly miferable, as that of being in conftant Fear. Weil 
«Joes the Scripture fay, The Fear of Man brings a Stiare ; 
it is a Life of Dea'.h ; and the Mind is fo intirely fup- 
preffed by it, that it is capable of no Relief; the ani- 
jnal Spirits fink, and all the Vigour of Nature, which 
ufually fupports Men under other AfHidlions, and is pre- 
fent to chem in the greateft Exigencies, fails them herc. 
Nor did it fail of its ufual Operations upon the Fancy, 
by heightening every Danger ; reprefentine the Engliß 
and Dutcb Captains to be Men uncapable of hearing 
. Reafon, or diftinguifhi gbetween honeft Men and Rogues; 
or beiwecn a Story calculated for our own Türe, made 
out of nothing, on puxpofe tj deeeive, and a true ge- 
nuine Account of our whole Voyage, Progrefs, and De- 
fign ; for we might many ways have convinced any 
reafonable Creature, that we were not Pirates ; the 
Goods we had on board, the Coxxtfem ^aw^> **x

frankly fhcwing ourfelves, and cntcring-into fach and 

fuch Ports ; evcn our vcry Männer, thc Force we had, 

the Number of Men, the few Arms, littlc Ammunition, 

ihort Provifions ; all thefe would have ferved to convince 

any Man, that wc werc no Pirates. The Opium, and 

other Goods, we had on board, would make it appear 

the Ship had been at Bengali the Dutcbmcn, who, it was 

faid, had the Names of all the Men that were in the 

Ship, might eafily fee, that we were a Mixture of Eng- 

fiß, Portuguefe, and InMans, and but twa Duuhmen oa 

board. Thefe, and many other particiliar Circumftance^ 

might have made it evident to the Underftanding of any 

Commander, whofe Hands we might fall into, that we 

were no Pirates. 

But Fear, that blind, ufelefs Paffion, worked another 

Way, and threw us into the Vapours ; it bewildered our 

Underftandings, and fct the Imagination at Work, t<i 

form a thouiand terribJe Things, that, perhaps, might 

never happen ; we firft fuppofed, as, indeed, every body 

had related to us, that the Seamen on board the Engliß 

and Dutcb Ships, but efpecially the Duteh, were fo en- 

raged at the Name of a Pirate, and efpecially at our 

bcatiDg of their Boats, and efeaping, that they would not 

give themfelves teaye to inquire, whether we were Pirates 

or no ,• but would execute us off-hand, as we call it-, 

witnout givmg us any room for a Befence. We refled- 

«o, that there was really fo much apparent Evidence

But let that be how it will, thofe were our Appre- 
henfions ; and both mv Partner and I too, fcarce fiept a 
Night without dreammg of Halters, ani Yard-arms ; 
that is to fay, Gibbets ; of Fighting, and being taken ; 
of Killing, and being killed ; and' one Night I was in 
füch a Fury in my Dream, fanfying the Dutchmen had 
boarded us, and I was knocking one of their Seamen 
down, that I flruck my double rill againft the Side of 
the Cabin I lay in, with fuch a Force as wounded my 
Hand moft grievoufly, broke my Knuckles, and cut and 
bruifed the Flefh ; fo that it not only waked me out of 
my Sleep, bat I was once afraid I fhould have loft two 
of my Fingers, 

Another Apprehenfion I had, was, of the cruel Ufage 
we (hould meet with from them, if we feil into their 
Hands : Then the Story of Amboyna came into my 
Head, and how the Dutch might, perhaps, torture us, 
as thcy did our Countrymen there ; and make fome of 
our Men, by Exfremity of Torture, confefs thofe Crimes 
they never were guiky of ; own themfelves, and all of 
us, to be Pirates ; and fo they would pirt us to Death, 
with a formal Appearance of Juftice ; and that they 
might be tempted to do this, for the Gain of our Ship 
and Cargo, which was worth four or five thoufand 
Pounds, put all together. 

Thefe things tormented me, and my Partner too, Night 
and Day; nor did we confider, that the Captains of* 
Ships have no Authority to act thus ; and if we had fur- 
rendered Prifoners to them, they could not anfwer the 
deftroying us, or torturing us, but would be accountable 
for it when they came into their own Country. This, I 
fay, gave me no Satisfaftion 3 for, if they will ac"l thus 
with us, what Advantage would itbe to us,that they would v 
be called to Account for it ; or, if we were firft to be 
murdered, what Satisfa&ion would it be to us, to have 
them pünimed when they came Home ? 

I cannot refrain taking Notice here, what Refle&ions 
I now had, upon the paft Variety of my particular Cir- 
comßances ; how hard I thought itwas, that 1, who had 
fpent forty Years in a Life of continued Difficulties, and ' 
was, at laft, come, as it were, at the Port or Haven 
which all Men drive at, viz. to have Reft aud PlwtY>

. After theie Thonghts, iömething of Religion woald 
come in; and I woald be confidering, that this feemed 
to me to be a Difpontkm of immediate Providcnce ; aai 
I onght to Iook upon it. and fabmit to it t as fach* 
that altbongh I was innocent as to Men, I was far fion

the Haods of the Savages, who were Men-eaters, and 
who, I was füre, woald feaft upon me, when they had 
taken me, than by thofe, who wo old perhaps, glot thcir 
Rage upon me, by inhuman Tortures and Barbaritks; 
that, in tbe Cafe of the Savages, I always refolved to 
die fighting, to the lad Gafp ; and why fhonld I not do 
fo now, feeing it was much more dreadful* to me at leaft, 
to think of falliog into thefe Men's Hands, than ever it 
was to think of being eaten by Men ? For the Savages, 
give them their Duc, would not eat a Man tili he was. 
dead ; and killed him firft, as we do a Bullock ; bot 
that thefe Men had many Arts beyond the Cruelty of 
Death. Whenever thefe Thoughts prevailed, I was füre 
to put myfelf into a kind of Fever, with the Agitation* 
of a fuppofed Fight ; my Blood would boil, and my Eyes 
fparkle, as if I was engaged ; and I always refolved, 
that I woald take no Quarter at their Hands ; but evca 
at laß, if i could refift no longei, I would blow up the 

Ship>

Sbip, and all that was in her, and leave them bat littlc 
> Booty to boaft of. 

But how much the grcater Weight the Anxieties and 
Perplexities of thcfe things were to our Thoughts whiler 
we were at Sea, by fo much the greater was our Satis- 
faclion, when we faw ourfelves on Shore ; and my Part- 
ner told me, he dreamed, That he had a very heavy 
' Load upon his Back, which he was to carry up an Hill, 
and found that he was not able to fland long under it ; 
but the Portuguefe Pilot came, and took it off his Back, 
and the Hill diiappeared, the Ground before him fhewing 
all fmooth and piain : And truly it was fo ; we were all 
like Men who had a Load taken off their Backs. 

For my part, I had a Weight taken off from my 
Heart, that I was not able any longer to bear ; and, at 
I faid above, we refolved to go no more to Sea in that 
Ship. When we came on Shore, the old Pilot, who was 
now our Frierid, got us a Lodging, and a Warehoufe 
fbr our Goods, which, by the way, was much the fame* 
it was a little Houfe or Hut, with a large Houfe joining 
to it, all built with Canes, and palifadoed round with 
large Canes, to keep out pilfering Thieves, of which it 
leems. there were not a few in the Country. However, 
the Magiftrates allovved us alfo a little Guard, and we 
had a Soldier with a kind of Haibert, or Half pike, who 
ftood Centinel at oar Door ; to wboin we allowed a Pint 
of Rice, and a little Piece of Money, about the Value 
of three Pcnce, per Day, fo that our Goods were kept 
Tery fafe. 

The Fair or Mart, ufually kept in this Place, had beca 
over fomc Time ; however, we found that there were 
three or four Junks in the River, and two Japaners, I 
snean, Ships from Japan, with Goods which they "had 
bought in China y and were not gone away, having Ja- 
fanefe Merchants on Shore. 

The firft thing our old Portugueft Pilot did for us, was, 
to bring us acquainted with three Miffionary £«/»(# Priefts, 
who were in the Town, and who had been there fome 
Time, Converting the People to Chrißianity ; but we 
thought they made but poor Work of it, and made them 
but forry Chriftians when they had done. However, 
that was not our Buünefs. One of thcfc wsa * Frtntb- 



•MT, whom they called Father £im» ; he was a joffy 

wcll-conditioned Man, very free in his Convention, 

ftot feeming fo fcrious and grave as the other two did; one 

©f whom wat m Poringueft, and the other a Genotß ; bot 

Father Si mo* wai courteoqs, cafy in his Manner, and very ] 

agreeable Company; the other two wcre more refervcd, 

fcemed rigid and auflere, and applied ferionfly to the 

Work they came abowt, «w*. to talk with, and infinnste 

themfelves among the Inhabitants, where-ever they had 

Opportnaity : We often cat and drank with thofe Men: 

And tho' I mnft confefs, the Converfion, as they call ir, 

of the Cbutefi to Chrilttaniry, is (o far from the troe 

Converfion reauired, to bring- Heathen People to the 

Faith of Chrift, that it feems to amoant to little more 

than letcing them know the Name of Chrift, . fay fome 

Prayers to the Virgin Mary, and her Son, in a Tongoe 

which they underftand not, and to crofs themfelves, and 

the like ; yet it muft be confefted, that thefe Religion*, 

whom we call Miffionaries, have a firm Belief that thefe 

People (hall be faved, and that they are the Intfammeat 

of it ; and, on this Account, they nndergo not onlf 

the Fatigne of the Voyage, and Hazards of liring i& 

fuch Place«, bat oftentimes Death itfelf, with the moft 

violent Tortures, for the fake of this Work} and it 

would be a great Want of Cbarity in as, whatever Opi- 

nion we have of the Work itfelf, and the Manner of 

their doing it, if we fhould not have a good Opinion of 

their Zeal, who andertake it with fo many Hazards, snd 

who have no Profpedl of the leaft temporal Advantage » 

themfelves. 

But to return to my Story : This Freneb Pricft, Father 
Simon, was appointed, it feems, by Order of the Chief 
of tbe Million, to go up to Peking, the Roy al Seat of che 
Cbinefe Emperor ; and waited only for another Prieft, 
who was ordered to come to him from Macao, to go along 
with him ; and we fcarce ever mct together, bat he was 
inviting me to go that Journey with him, telling me, 
How he would ihew me all the glorious things of that 
mighty Empire ; and among the reft, the greateft City 
in the World ; a City, faid he, that your London, and 
our Paris, put together, cannot be equal to. This was 
the City cd Peking, which, l confcfs, is vcry great, and

tely füll of People; but, as I looked on thofe things 
different Eyes from other Men, fo I fhall give my 
ion of them in few Words, whcn I come, in the 
fe of my Travels, to.fpeak more particularly of 

it firft, I come to my Friar, or Miffionary : Dining 
bim one Day, and being very merry together, I 
ed fome little Inclination to go with him ; and he x 
ed me and my Partner very hard, and with a great 
y Perfuafions to content. Why, Father Simon, fays 
Partner, why fhodd you deiire our Company fo 
fi ? You know we are Heretics, and you do not love 
nor can keep us Company with any Pleafure. O ! 
he, you may, perhaps, be good Catholics in Time ; 
Jufraefs here is to convert Heathens; and who knows 
[may convert you too ? Very well, Father, faid I, 
ou wijl preach to us all the Way. I won't be trou- 
>me to you, faid he ; our Religion does not diveft us 
ood Manners ; beides, faid he, we are here like 
atrymen; and fo we are, compared to the Place wc 
n ; and if you are Hugonots, and I a Catholic, we 
be all Chriflians at lad ; at leaft, faid he, we are all 
tlemen, and we may converfe fo, without being un- 
to one another. I liked that Part of his Difcourfe 
well, and it began to put me in mind of my Prieft 
I had left in the Brafils ; but this Father Simon did 
:ome up to his Charaäer by a great deal ; för tho* 
er Simon had no Appearance ot a criminal Levity in 
neither, yet he had not that Fund of Chriftian Zeal, 
Piety, and fincere AfFedion to Religion, that my 
r good Ecclefiaflic had, of whom I have faid fo 
h. 

ot to leave him a little, though he never left us» nor 
iting us to go with him, but we had fomething 
before us at that Time ; for we had, all this while, 
Ship and our Mercbandize to difpofe of ; and we 
m to be very doubtful what we ihould do, for we 
t now in a Place of very little Bufinefs ; and once I 
about to venture to fail for the River of Kilam, and 
2\ty of Nanquin : But Providence feemed now more 
•ly, as I thought, than ever, to concern itfelf in our 
irsi and I was encouraged from tl\\s \trj Tvcfc*\^

think, I fhould, one Way or otfacr, gct out of this tan« 
gled Circumftance, and be brought Home to my own 
Country again ; though I had not the lcaft View of the 
Manner ; and when I began fometimes to think of it, 
could not imagine by vshat Method it was to be done. 
Providence, I ?ay, began here to clear up our Way a 
iittle ; and the firft thing that offered was, that our old 
Portuguefe Pilot broaght a Japan Merchant to us, who 
began to inqoire what Goods we had ; and, in the firft 
Place, he bought all our Opium, and gave us a very 
good Price for it, paying us in Gold by Weight, fome in 
fmall Pieces of their own Com, and fome in fmall Wedges, 
of about ten or eleven Ounces each. While we were 
dealing with him for our Opium, it came into my Head, 
that he might, perhaps, deal with us for the Ship too ; 
and I ordered the Interpreter to propofe it to him. He 
fhrunk up his Shoulders at it, when it was firft propofed 
to him ; but, in a few Days after, he came to me, with 
one of the miffionary Priefts for his Interpreter, and told 
me, He had a Propofal to make to me, and that was 
this : He had bought a great Quantity of Goods of os, 
when he had no Thoughts (or Propofals made to him) 
of buying the Ship ; and that, therefore, he had not 
Money enough to pay for the Ship ; but if I would Iet 
the fame Men who were in the Ship navigate her, he 
would hire the Ship to go to Japan, and would fend 
them from thence to the Pbilippjne Iflands with anothcr 
Loading, which he would p3y the Freight of, before 
they went from Japan ; and that, at their Return, he 
would buy the Ship. I began to liften to this Propofal, 
and fo eager did my Head ßill run upon Rambling, that 
I could. not but begin to entertain a Notion myfelf of 
;oing with him, and fo to fail from the Pbilippine 
flands, away to the Soutb-Seas ; and accordingly I 
afked the Japanefe Merchant, if he would not hire us 
to the Pbilippine Iflands, and difcharge us there. He 
faid, No, he could not do that ; for then he could not 
have the Return of his Cargo ; but he would difcharge 
us in Japan, he faid, at the Ship's Return. Well, Hill 
I was for taking him at that Propofal, and going my- 
felf; but my Partner, wifer than myfelf, perfuaded me 
from it, reprefenting the. Dangers, as wqII of the Seas, 

as

as of the Japaneß, who are a falfe, cruel, and treache- 
tous People; and then of the Spaniards at the Pbilippinesi 
more falfe, more cruel, more treacheroas, than they. 

But to bring this long Turn of our Affairs to a Con- 
clufion ; the firft thing we had to do, was, to confult 
with the Captain of the Ship, and with the Men, and 
know if they were willing to go to Japan ; and, while 
I was doing this, the young Man, whom, as I faid, my 
Nephew had left with me as my Companion for my 
Travels, came to me, and told me, that he thought that 
Voyage promifed very fair, and that there was a great 
Profpeft of Advantage, and he would be very glad if I 
«ndertook it ; but that if I would not, and would give 
him Leave, he would go as a Merchant, or how I pleafed 
to order him ; that if ever he came to England, and I 
was there, and alive, he woold render me a faithful Ac- 
count of his Succefs, and it fhould be as much mine as 
I pleafed. 

I was really loth to part with him ; but, confidering 
the Profpe&of Advantage, which was really confiderable, 
and that he was a young Fei low as likely to do well in 
it as any I knew, I inclined to let him go ; but, ftrft, I 
told him I would confult my Partner, and give him an 
Anfwer the next Day. My Partner and I difcourfed 
about it ; and my Partner made a moft generous Offer : 
He told me, You know it has been an unlucky Ship, 
and we both refolve not to go to Sea in it again ; if 
your Steward (fo he called my Man) will venture the 
Voyage, VW leave my Snare of the Veflel to him, and , 
let him make the beft of it ; and if we live to meet in 
England, and he meets with Succefs abroad, he (hall ac~ 
count for one half of the Profits of-the Ship's Freight to 
us, the other (hall be his own. 

If my Partner, who was no Way concerned with my 
young Man, made him fuch an Offer, I could do no 
lefs than offer him the fame ; and all the Ship's Com- 
pany being willing to go with him, we made over half 
the Ship to him in Property, and took a Writing from 
him, obliging him to account for the other ; and away 
he went to Japan, The Japan Merchant proved a very 
pun&ual honeft Man • to him, protefted him at Japan* 
and got him a Licence to com« on SWn** vAvn^^^.

E*ro*ta*s in general have not lateljr obtained ; paid him 
' bis Freight vciy pon&ually, fent him to tbe PbtiippiniL 
loaded with Japan and China Ware», . and a Supercargo of 
their own, who, trafficking wich che Sfaniards, brought 
back European Goods again, and a grcat Quantity of 
Clovcs, and ocher Spiee ; and therc he was not only paid 
bis Freighc rcry well, and at a very good Price, # bat; 
being not wflling to feil che Ship then, the Merchant 
furniihed him with Good« on his own Account ; that, 
for fome Money, and foxne Spices of his own, which 
be brought with him, he went back to the Mam/las, to 
the Sfaniar<h, where he fold b» Cargo very well. 
Here, having gottea a good Acquaintance at Manilk, 
he got his Ship made a free Ship ; and the Governor 
of Maniila hired bim to go to Acapuko in America, Ofi 
the Coaft of Mexico ; and gave bim a Licence to iand 
there, and travcl to Mexico, and to pafs in any Spenj/b 
Ship to Exrope, with all his Men. 

He made the Voyage to Acapulco very happily, aad 
there he fold his Ship ; and hating there alfo obtained 
Allowance to travel by Land to Porto Bet/o, he foooj 
Means, fome how or other, to go to Jammca with all 
his Treafure; and, ab out cight Years after, came to 
England exceeding rieh ; of which I (hall take Notice ia 
its Place ; in the mean Time, I return to our particular 
Affairs. 

Being now to part with the Ship, aod Ship's Com* 

gany, it came before us, of courfe, to confider wbat 
ecompence we fhould give to the two Men, that 
gave us fuch timely Notice of the Defign againft us in 
the River of Cambodia. The Truth was, they had done - 
us a conüderable Service« and deferved well at our 
Hands ; though, by the Way, they were a couple of 
Rogues too ; for, as tbey believed the Story of our be- 
ing Pirates, and that we had really run away with the 
Ship, they came down to us, not only ta betray tbe 
Defign that was formed again ft us, but to go to Sea 
with us as Pirates; and one of.them confefled aftcr- 
wards, that notbing elfe but the Hopes of going a 
Roguing, brought him to do it, However, the Ser- 
vice they did us was not the lefs ; and therefore, as l 
had promifed to be grateful to them, I firft ordered th$ 

Money 



It 



ROBINSONCRUSOE. ar7 
Money to be paid to them, which they faid was doe 
CO tbcm on board their refpective Ships ; that is to 
: 4ay, the Englißman nineteen Months Pay, and to thc 
Dutcbman fe\ p en ; and, over and above that, I gave each 
of them a fmall Sum of Money in Gold, which con- 
L. t*nted them very well ; then I made the Englißman Gun- 
• ner in the Ship, the Gunner being now made Second 
- Mate and Pürier ; the Dutcbman I made Boatfvvain ; 
j- fo they were both very well pleafed, and proved very 
iL ferviceable, being both ablc Seamen, and very flout 
|;Fellows. 

Ki We were now on Shore in China. Jf I thought myfelf 
p^twinifhed, and remote from my own Country, at Bengale 
y where I had many Ways to eet Home for my Money. 
|f what could I think of myfelf now, when I was gotten 
fr about a thonfand Leagues farther off from Home, 
: and perftäly deftitute of all Männer of Profpedt of 
g Retarn ! 

IL _ AU -we had for it was this ; that in about four 
|P"Months Time there was to be another Fair at that 
B ' Place where we were, and then we might be able to 
!* porchafe all Sorts of the Manufaftures of the Country, 
and withal might poflibly find fome Chinefe Junks or 
Veflcls from Nanqtän, that would be to be fold, and' 
l would carry us and our Goods whither we pleafed. This 
H 1 liked very well, and refolved to wait ; befides, as our 
|rj>articdar Perfons were not obnoxious, fo if any Englifo 
\qk Dutcb Ships came thither, perhaps we might have an 
s Opportunity to load our Goods, and get PaiTage to fome 
* Otner Place in India nearer Home. 

Upon thefe Hopes we refolved to continue here; 
9Ut, to divert ourfelves, we took two or three Jour- 
Tnies into the Country ; firft we went ten Days Jour- 
|*cy to fee the City of Nanquin, a City well worth 
"being indeed ; they fay it has a Million of People in 
^ t ; which, however, I do not believe ; it is regularly 
"fenilt, the Streets all exadtly ftrait, and crofs one ano- 
ber, in direel Lines, which gives the Figure of it great 
[TA d van tage.

worth my wliile to wrice of, or any that (hall come afcer 
me to read. 

It is very obfervable, that we wonder at the Gran- 
deur, the Riches, the Pomp, the Ceremonies, the Go- 
vernment, the Manufactures, the Commerce, and the 
Conducl of thefe People ; not that it is to be wondered 
at, or indeed, in the leaft to be regarded ; but becaufe, 
having firil a Notion of the Barbarity of thofe Coun« 
tries, the Rudenefs, and the Ignorance that prevail 
there, we do not expedt to find any fuch things fo 
far ofF. 

Otherwife, what are their Buildings to the Palices 
and Royal Buildings of Europe? What their Trade, to 
the univerfal Commerce of England, Holland, France, 
and Sfain ? What their Cities to ours, for Wealth, 
Strength, Gaiety of Apparel, rieh Furnitare, and an in- 
finite Variety ? What are their Ports, fupplied with a 
few Junks and Barks, to our Navigation, our Mer- 
chants Fleets, our large and powerful Navies ? Our 
City of London has more Trade than all their mighty 
Empire. One Engliß, or Dutch, or French Man of 
War of 80 Gans, would fight with, and deftroy all 
the Shipping of China. But the Greatnefs of their 
Wealth, their Trade, the Power of their Government, 
and Strength of their Armies, is furprifing to us, be- 
caufe, as I have faid, confidering them as a barbaroai 
Nation of Pa^ins, little better than Savages, we did 
not expedl fuch things among them ; and this, indeed, 
is the Advaiuage with which all their Greatnefs and 
Power is r«,prefented to us ; otherwife it is in itfclf 
nothing at all ; for. as I have faid of their Ships, fo it 
anav be faid of their Armies and Troops ; all the Forces 
of 'he'r E.;*p.re, though they were to bring two Milli- 
on* of Meu iiuo t'c Field together, would be able to 
do not'.üng but ruin the Country, and ftarve themfelves. 
Jf the> were to befiege a ftrong Town in Flanders, or

ainft the Batteries and Attacks of an European Army ; 
d at the fame Time, all the Armies of China could 
ver take fuch a Town as Dunkirk, provided it was 
t ftarved ; no, not in ten Years Siege. They have 
re-arms, it is true ; but they are aukward, clumfy, 
d nncertain in going ofF; they have Powder, but it 
of no Strength 5 they have neither Difcipline in the

ange to me, when I came Home, and heard our Peo- 
5 £y fuch -fine things of the Power, Riches, Glory, 
agnificence, and Trade of the Cbineß, becaufe I faw 
d* knew, that they were a contemptible Herd or

not to go ; fo I referrcd him to my Partner, and fcft 
it wholly to his Choice ; who, at length, refolved '* 
in the Affirmative; and we prepared for our Joarney. 
We fet out with very good - Advantage, as to findiaf

take great State upon them, travelling with great At*

snt Provifions, both for ourfelves and our Horfes,

ere obiiged to pay for every thin* we had, after 
arket-price of the Country, and the Mandarin's

rom us, fo that our travelling in the Retinue of 
andarin, though it was a very great Kindnefs to 
vas not fuch a mighty Favour in him, but was, 
i, a great Advanrage to him, confidering there 

about thirty o'.her People travelied in the fame 
ier befides us, und er the Protedion of his Reti- 
or, as we may call it, under his Convoy. This, 

was a great Advantage to him ; for the Country 
Ihed all the Provifions for nothing, and he took all 
Aoney for. them. 

5-were five~and-twenty Days travelling to Peking, 
gh a Country infinuely populous, but miferably 
ated, the Hufbandry, Oeconomy, and the Way 
iving, all very miferablc, though they bor.:! {o

b it is, if we, who underixand how to live, v/ere 
idure it, or to comparc it with our own, but not 
thefe poor Wretches, who know no other. The 
s of thefe People is iniinitely great, and cxceeded by 
ng bat their Poverty, which adds to that which 
l their Mifery. I muft needs think the naked Sa- 
1 of Jimerica live much more happy, becaufe, as they 
nothing, fo they defire nothing ; whereas thefe are 
i and infolent, and, in the main, are mere Beggars 
Drudges ; their Oftentation is inexpreffible, and is 
ly ßiewed in their Cloaths and Buildings, and in the 
ing Multitudes of Servants or Slaves, and, which is 
e lau Degree ridiculous, their Contempt of all the 
Id but themfelves.

of Pomp and Poverty. , 

The Habit of this greafy Don was very proper for a 
Scaramouch, or Merry- Andrew ; being a dirty Callico, 
with all the tawdry Trappings of a Fool's Gozt, .fach « 
Hanging. Slceves, TafFety, and Cau and Slafhes ahnoft 
on every Siele ; it covered a rieh Taflety Veft, aa greafy ~

Head as his Slaves did about the Tail ; and thut he rede 
by os with aboat ten or twelvc Servants, and we wert 
told he was going from the City to his Country Seat, 
about half a Leagae before as. We travelled on gendy, 
but this Figure of a Gentleman rode away betöre as; 
and as we Sopped at a Village about an Hour to rem* 1

really pitied and contemned him, we purfued our

Honour to tafte of, and which was, I think, a Dofe

I been olered him, <viz. a Mefs of boiled Rice, with

At length we arrived at Peking ; I had nobody with 
me bat the Youth, whom my Nephew the Capuin had , 
given me to attend me as a Servant, and who proved i 
very trufty and diligent; and my Partner had nobody .J

and, indeed, this old Man was a moftufefal Implement co 
us every-where ; for we had not been above a Weck at 
Peking, when he came laughing : Ah, Seignior Jngleß, 
faid he, I have fomething to teil you, will make yoor

be ? I don't know any thing in this Coüntry can ei«

without a Ship, without a Horfe, without Pecune ? So hc

was furprifed with this News j a fecret Joy fpread it- 
felf over my whole Soul, which I cannot defcribe, and 
never feit before or ü nee ; and I had no Power, for a 
good while, to fpeak a Word to the old Man ; but at 
lall I turned to him : How do you know this ? faid I : 
Are you füre it is true ? Ycs, faid he, I met this Moni* 
ing, in the Street, an old Acquaintance of mine, an Ar- 
meniern, or one you call zGreaan, who is among them ; 
he came lad from Aßracan, and was defigning to go 
to Tonquin, where I formerly knew him, but has al- 
tered his Mind, and is now refolved to go back with 
the Caravan to Mofcvw, and fo down the River of

uneafy about beinc; left to go back alone ; if this be 
a Method for my Return to England, it fliall be your 
Paule, if you go back to Macao at all. We then went to 
Consulting together what was to be done, and afked my 
Partner what he thought of the Pilot's News, and whe- 
ther it would fuit with his Affairs ? He told me he 
would do juft as I would ; for he had fettled all his Af- 
fairs fo well at Bengale and left his Effedls in fuch good 
Hands, that as we had made a good Voyage here, if he 
could veft it in China Silks, wrought and raw, fuch as 
might be worth the Carriage, he would be content to 
go to England, and then make his Voyage back to Bengal 
by the Company 's Ships. 

Having refolved upon this, we agreed, that if our 
Portugal Pilot would go with us, we would bear his 
Charges to Mofcow, or to England, if he pleafed ; nor, 
indeed, were we to be efteemed over generous in that 
Part neither, if we had not rewarded him farther ; for, 
the Service he had done us was really worth all that, 
and more ; for he had not only been a PiJot to us at 
Sca, but he had been alfo like a Broker for us on Shore * 
and his procuring for us the Japan Merchant, was fome 
Hundred s of Pounds in our Pockets. So we confultcd 
together about it ; and, being willing to gratify him, 
which was, indeed, but doing him Juftice, and rery 
willing alfo to have him with us befides, for he was 
a raoft neceflary Man on all Occafions, we agreed to

agaihft my Partners Return ; befides this, we boaght 
a very large Quantity of Raw Silk, and fome otner 
Goods ; our Cargo amounting, in thefe Goods only, 
to about Thrce thoufand five handred Poands Ster- 
ling, which, tögether with Tea, and fome fine Cal- 
Jicocs, and three Camel-Ioads of Nutmegs and Cloves, 
loaded in all eighteen Cameis for our Share, befides 
tho r e we rode upori ; which, with two of three fpare 
Horfes, and two Horfes loaded with Provifions, made 
os, in fhort, twenty-fix Cameis and Horfes in our Re- 
tinae. 

The Company was very great, and, as near as I can- 
remember, made between three and four hundred Horfc 
and Cameis, and upward of an hundred and twenty 
Men, very well armed, and provided for all Events. 
For, as the Eaftern Caravans are fubjett to be attacked 
by the Jrabs, fo are thefe by the Tartan ; but they are 
not altogether fo dangerous as the Arabs> nor fo barba- 
rous when they prcvail. 

• The Company confißed of People of fevcral Nations, 
fach as Mufcovites chiefly $ for there were above fixty of 
them who were Merchants or Inhabitahts of Mcfiow % 
though of.them fome were Livoni ans, and to our par- 
ticular Satisfa&ion, five of them were Scots, who ap- 
.peared alfo to be Men of great Experience in Bu/inefs, 
and very good Subftance. 

When we had travelled one Day's Journey, the Guides, 
who were five in Number, callcd all the Gentlemen an dl 
Merchants ; that is to fay, all the Paflengers, except the 
Servants, to a great Council, as they termed it. At this 

freat Council every one depofited a certain Quantity of 
floney to a common Stock, for the neceflary Expence 
of baying Forage on the Way, where it was not other« 
wife to be had, and for fatisfying the Guides, getting 
Horfes, and the like. And here they conftituted the 
Journey, as they called it, <viz. They named Captains 
and Officers to draw us all up, and give the Command 
in Cafe of an Attack,- and gave every one their Turn of 
Command. Nor was this forming us into Order any 
more than what we found needful upon the Way, as 
flxall be obferved in its Place.

The Road all on this Side of tbc Country -is very po- 
nulous, and is füll of Potter«, and Earth-makers, tbat 
ii to fay 9 People that tempered tke Barth for the Cbha 
Ware; and, ai I was going along, oor Portugal Pilot, 
who had always fomething or other to fay to make as 
ncrry, came fneering to me, and told n.c, He would 
Acw me the greateft Rarity . in all the Conntry ; and that I 
ihoold have thit to fay of China, a6er all the ill hnmoored 
thingi I had fiud of it, that I had feen one thing which 
was not to be feen in all. the World befide. I was very. 
jmportunate to know what it war j at laß he told me, 
It wai a Gentleman*» Hanfe, buüt all wich China Ware. 
Well, faid I» are not . the Material« of their Baildiag 
the Produd of their own Country ; and fo it i« all 
Chinm Ware, is it not \ No, no, fays he, I mean, it is 
a Honfe all made of China Ware» foch as you call fo 
in England \ or^as-.it is called in onr Country, Pircdm*. 
Well, faid I, fuch a thing may be : How big is it? 
Can we carry it in a Box npon a Camel ? If we caa, 
we will bnyk it. ■ Upon a Camel ! faid the old Pilot, 
Holding up both his Hands $ why there is a Family of 
thirty reople lives in it. 

I was then curious, indeed, to fee it ; and when I 
came to it, it was nothing bat this ; it was a Timber 
Houfe, or a Houfe builc, as we call it in England, with 
Lath and Plaifter, but all the Pläiftering was really Chhs 
Ware, that is to fay, it was plaiftered with the Barth that 
jnakes China Ware. 

The Outfide, which the Sun fhone hot upon, was 
glazed* and looked very well, perfedtly white, and paint- 
cd with blueFigures, as the large ChinaWare in England 
is painted, and hard, as if it had been burnt. As to 
the Infide, all the Walls, inftead of Wainfcot, were lined 
up with hardened and painted Tiles, like the little fquare 
Tiles we call Gally-Ti/es in England, all made of the 
fcneit China, and the Figures exceeding iine indeed, with 
extraordinary Variety of Colours, mixed with Gold, 
raany Tiles making but one Figure, but joined fo artifi- 
cially with Mortar being made of the fame Earth, that 
it was very hard to fee where the Tiles met. Tae 
Floors of the Kooms were of the fame Compofitioo, 
and as hard as the eaxthen Floors we have in Ufe in 

Ceveral 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 229 

feveral Parts of England, efpecially Lincofoßire, Notting- 
bamßire, Leiceßerßire, &c. as hard as Stone, and fmooth, 
bat not burnt and painted, except fome fmaller Rooms, 
like Ciofets, which wcre all as it were paved with the 
■ famc Tilc ; the CieHngs, and, in a Word, all the Plai- 
ftcring-work in the whole Houfe, were of the fame 
Earth*; and, after all, the Roof was covered with Tiles 
of the fame, bat of a deep fhining Black. 

This was a China Warehoufe, indeed, truly and lite- 
rally to be called fo ; and, had I not been upon the 
Journey, I could have ftayed fome Days to fee and ex- 
amine the Particülars of it. They told me there were 
Mountains and Fifh-ponds in the Garden, all paved at 
the Bottom and Sides with tre fame, and fine Statoes 
fet up in Rows on the Walks, intirely formed of the 
Porcelain Earth, and burnt whole. 

As this is one of the Singularities of China, fo they 
may be allowed to excel in it ; but I am very füre they 
excel in their Accounts of h ; for they told me fuch . 
incredible things of their Performance in Crockcry- 
Ware, for fuch it is, that I carenot to relate, as know- 
ing it conld not be true : One told me, in particular, 
of a Workman that made a Ship, with all its Tackle, 
and Mails, and Sails, in Earthen-ware, big enough to 
carry fifty Men. If he had told me he launched it, and 
made a Voyage to 'Japan in it, I might have faid fome- 
thing to it indeed ; buc as it was, I knew the whole 
Story, which was, in fhort, aflting Pardon for the Word, 
that the Fellow ly'd ; fo I fmiled, and faid nothing 
tp it. 

This odd Sight kept me two Hours behind the Ca« 
ravan, for which the Leader of it for the Day, fined 
me abont the Value of three Shillings ; and told me, if 
it had been three Days Journey without the Wall, as 
it was three Days within, he muft have fined me four 
Times as much, and made me afk Pardon the next 
Council Day ; fo I promifed to be more orderly ; for, 
indeed, I found afterward s, the Orders made for keep- 
ing all together, were abfolutely ncceflary for our com- 
mon Safety.

paffing the Gate* I fay, I ftood ftrtl aa Hoar to look at 
it on every Side, near, and rar off, I mean, what was 
within my View; and, the Guide t>f our Caravan, who 
kad been extolling it fof the Wonder of the World, 
was mighty eager to hear my Opinion of it. I toW 
kirn it was a moft exccllcnt thing to keep off the fr»*« - 
t*n\ whkk he happened not to underftand as I meant 
it» and fo took it for a Compliment ; but the old Pilot 
langh'd ; O Seignior Inglefe* faid he, you fpeak in Co- 
loars. In Coloars ! faid I : What do yon mean br 
that ? Why you fpeak what looks white thia Way, and 
biack (hat Way ; gay one Way, and dull another Way; 
yon teil him it is a good Wall to keep out Tartars ; 
yon teil me by that, it is good for noching but tokeep 
out Tartars ; or, it will keep out none but Tartan j I 
underftand you, Seignior Inglefe % I underftand you, faid 
he, joking ; but Seignior Chinefi underftand you bis

Well, faid I, Seignior, do you think it would ftand 
out an Army of our Country People, with a good 
Train of Artillery ; or our Engineers, with two Com- 
panies of Miners ? Would they not batter it down in 
ten Days, that an Army mighe enter in Battalia, or blow 
it up into the Air, Foundation and all, that there (hould 
be no Sign of it left ? Ay, ay, faid he, I know that. 
The Cbinefc wanted mightily to know what I faid, 
and I gave him Leave to teil him a few Days after, 
for we were then almoft out of rheir Country, and 
he was to leave us in a iittle Tim? afterwards ; but when 
he knew what I had faid, he was duxnb all the reit 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 231 

of the Way, and weheajd no moreof his fine Story of 
the Chine fe Power and Greatncfs, while he ftayed. 

After we had oafled this mighty Not hing, caJled a Wall, 
fomething like the Pias Wall, fo famous in Northumber- 
landy and built by the Romans, we began to find the 
Country thinly inhabited, and the Pcople rather con- 
fined to live in fortified Towns and Cities, as being fub- 
jeft to thelnroads and Depredations ofthe Tartars, who 
rob in great Armies, and therefore are not to be refifted 
by the naked Inhabitants of an open Country. 

And here I began to find the Neceflity of keeping to- 
gether in a Caravan, as we travelled ; for we faw feve- 
ral Troops of Tartars roving about ; but when I camc 
to fee them diftir.&ly, I wondered more that the Chinefe 
Empire could be conquered by fuch contemptible Fel- 
lows ; for they are a mere Herd or Crowd of wild Fel- 
lows, keeping no Order, and underftanding no Difcipline, 
or Manner of Fight. 

Their Horfes are poor, Iean, ftarved Creatures, taught 
nothing, and are fit for noching ; and this we found 
the firft Day we faw them, which was after we en- 
tered the wilder Part of the Country ; our Leader for 
the Day gave Leave for about fmeen of us to go a 
hunting, as they call it; and what was this but hunt- 
ing of Sheep ! However, it may be called Hunting too ; 
for the Creatures are the wildeft, and fwifteft of Foot, 
that ever I faw of their Kind ; only they will not run a 
great Way, and you are füre of Sport when you begin 
. nie Chace ; for they appear generally by thirty or forty 
in a Flock, and, like true Sheep, always keep together 
when they fly* 

In Purfuit of this odd Sort of Game, it was our Hap 
to meet with about forty Tartan j whether they werc 
hunting Mutton as we were, or whether they looked 
for another Kind of Prey, I know not ; but as foon as 
they faw us, one of them blew a Kind of Hörn very 
loud, bat with a barbarous Sound that I had never 
heard before ; and, by the Way, never care to hear 
again. We all fuppofed this was to call their Friends 
about them ; and fo it was $ for in lefs than half a 
Quarter of an Hour, a Tr«op of forty or fifty more

appeared at about a Mile Diftance, but our Work waf 
over firft, as it happened. 

One of the Sco/s Merchants of Mofctnv - happened to 
be amongil us ; and as foon as he heard the Hörn, he 
told us, in (hört, That we had nothing to do, but to 
Charge them immediately, witbout Lofs of Time ; and, 
drawing us up in a Line, he afked, If we were refolved ? 
We told him, We were ready to follow him : So he rode 
directly up to them. They ilood gazing at us like a 
mere Crowd, drawn up in no Order, nor fliewing the 
Face of any Order at all ; but as foon as they faw as 
advance, they let fly their Arrows ; which, howerer, 
roifl'ed us very happily ; it feems they miflook not their 
Aim, but their Diilance ; for their Arrows all feil a 
little fhort of us, but with fo true an Aim, that had we 
been about twenty Yards nearer, we muß have had fe- 
Yeral Men wounded, if not killed. 

Immediately we halted ; and though it was at a 
great Diilance, we flred, and fent them Jeaden Bullets 
for wooden Arrows, following our Shot füll Gallop, 
refolving to fall in among them Sword in Hand ; for 
fo our bold Scot that led us dire&ed. He was, indeed, 
but a Merchant, but he behaved with that Vigour and 
Bravery on this Occafion, and yet with fuch a cool 
Courage too, that I never faw any Man in Aäion fit- 
ter for Command. As foon as we came up to them, 
we fired our Piilols in their Faces, and then drew ; 
but they fled in the greatefl Confufion imaginable ; 
the only Stand any of them made, was on our Right, 
where thrce of them flood, and, by s Signs, called the 
reft to come back to them, having a Kind of Scymitar 
in their Hands, and their Bows hanging at their Backs. 
Our brave Commander, without afleing any body to 
follow him, galloped up clofe to them, and with his 
Fufil knocked one of them off his Horfe, killed the 
fecond with his Piftol, and the third ran away ; and thus 
ended our Fight : But we had this Mibfortune attending 
it, <viz. That all our Mutton that we had in Chace, 
got away. We had not a Man killed or hurt ; but, 
as for the Tar/ars, there were about five of them killed ; 
how many were wounded, we knew not j but this we 

knew,

fertew, that the other Party was fo frighted with the Noife 
öf our Guns, that they fled, and never made any At- 
tempt opon us« 

We were all this white in the Chintfe Dominions, and 
therefore the Tartan were not fo bold as afterwards ; 
bot in about five Days we entered a vaft great wild De- 
fert, which heid us three Days and Nights March ; and 
we were obliged to carry our Water with us in great 
Leather Bottles, and to encamp all Night, juft as I have 
heard tbey do in the Deferts of Arabia. 

I afked our Guides, Whofe Dominion this was in ? 
find they told me, this was a Kind öf Border, that 
might be called No Mans Land; bring Part of the 
Great Karakatbay, or Grand Tartary ; but that howe- 
vcr, it was reckoned to China ; that there was no Care 
taken here, to preferve it from the Inroads of Thieves ; 
and therefore it was reckoned the worft Defert in the 
whole March, though we were to go over fome much 
larger. 

In paffing this Wildernefs, which, I confefs, was at 
the firft View very frightful to me, .we faw two or three 
Times little Parties ofthe Tartars, but they feemed to be 
upon their own AfFairs, and to have no Defign upon 
im ; and £b, like the Man who met the Devil, if they 
had nothing to fay to us, we had nothing to fay to them ; 
we let them go. 

Once, however, a Party of them came {o near, as 
to ftand and gaze at us ; whether it was to confider 
what they fbould do, *viz. to attack us, or not attack us, 
we knew not ; but when we were pafied at fome Di- 
ftance by them, we made a Rear-guard of forty Men, 
and ftood ready for them, letting the Caravan pafs 
half a Mile, or thereabouts, before us : After a while 
they marched off, only we foun-J they aflaulted us with 
üve Arrows at their parcing ; one of which wounded 
a Horfe, fo that it difabled him ; and we left him the 
next Day, poor Creature, in great Nced of a good Far- 
rier ; we fuppofe they might fhoot more Arrows, which 
mjght fall fhort of us ; but we faw no more Arrows, or 
Tartars, at that Time. 

We travelled near a Month after this, the Wajs being 
not fo good as at firß, though Hill ia üä U^m\\^v^& <&

The old Man, feeing mc down, with a böld Heart 
ltepped up to the Fellow that had druck ine, and laying 
hold of his Arm with one Hand, and pulling him down 
by main Force a little towards him with the other, he 
fhot him into the Head, and laid him dead on the Spot; 
he then immediately ftepped up to him who had ftopped 
ue,,as I faid, and before he could come forward again 
(for it was all done as k were in a Moment) made a 
Blow at him with a Scymitar, which he always wore ; 
but, miffing the Man, cut his Horfe into the Side of his 
Head, cut one of his Ears ofF by the Root, and a great 
Slice down the Side of his Face. The poor Beaft, en- 
raged with the Wounds, was no more to be governed by 
his Rider, though the Fellow fat well enough too ; but 
away he flew, and carried him quite out of the Pilot's 
Rcach, and at fome Diilance rifing upon his hind Legs, 
threw down the Tartar> and feil upon him. 

In this Interval the poor Ckintfe came in, who had loft 
the Camel, but he had no Weapon ; however, feeing the 
Tarier down, an<f his Hoffe fallen upon him, .he runs to 
him, and, feizing upon an ugly illfavoured Weapon he 
had by his Side, fomething like a Pole-ax, but not a 
Pole-ax neither, he wrenched it from him, and made 
fhift to knock his Tartarian Brains out with it. But mv 
old Man had the third Tartar to deal with (tili ; and, 
feeing he did not fly as he expe&ed, nor come on to 
fight him, as he apprehended, bat ftood ftock-ftill, the 
old Man ftood ftill too, and falls to Work with his 
Tackle to charge his Piftol again ; but as (oon as the 
Tartar faw the Piftol, whether he fuppofed it to be the 
fatne, or another, 1 know not ; but away he fcoured, and 
left my Pilot, my Champion I called him afterwards, a 
complete Vi&ory. 

By this Time I was a little awake ; for I thought, 
when I firft began to awake, that I had been- in a fweet 
Sleep ; but as I faid above, I wondered where I was, 
how I came upon the Ground, and what was the Mat-

Juftice. At the Stranger's Requeft, faid he. Why then, 
faid the Juftice, you were the Stranger's Servant for 
the Time ; and the Camel being dclivered to his 
Servant, it was delivered to him, and he muH pay 
for it. 

I confefs the thing was fo clear, thatl had not a Word 
to fay ; but, admiring to fee fach juft Reafohing upon 
the Confequence, and fo accurate ftating the Cafe, I paid 
wilJingly for the Camel, and fent for ahother ; but yoa 
may obferve, I fent for it ; I did not go to fetch it my- 
felf any more ; I had enough of that. 

The City of Kaum is a Frontier of the Chinefe Em- 
pire ; they call it fortified, and fo it is, as Fortifications 
£o there ; for this I will venture to affirrn, that all the 

Tartars 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 237 

Tartars in Karakatkay, which, I believe, are Tome Mil- 
lions, could not batcer down the Walls with their Bows 
and Arrows ; bur to call it ftrong, if it were attacked 
wich Cannon, would be to make thofe who underfland 
it, laugh at you. 

We wanted, as I have faid, above two Days Journey 
of this City, whcn Meflengers were fent Exprefs to 
every Part of the Road, to teil all Travellers and Ca- 
ravans to halt» tili they had a Guard fent to them ; for 
that an unufual Body of Tarlars, making ten thoufand 
in all, had appeared in the Way, about thirty Miles be- 
yond the-City. 

This was very bad News to Travellers ; however, it 
was carefully done of the Governor, and we were very 
glad to hear we fhould have a Guard. Aecordingly 
two Days after, we had 200 Soldiers fent us from a Gar- 
rifon of the Cbineß on our Left, and three hundred more 
from the City of Naum, and with thofe we advanced 
boldly j the three hundred Soldiers from Kaum marched 
in our Front, the two hundred in our Rear, and our 
Mcn on each Side of our Cameis with our Baggage, and 
the whole Caravan in the Center ; in this Order, and 
well prepared for" Battle, we thought ourfelves a Match 
for the whole ten thoufand Mogul Tartars, if they had 
appeared ; but the next Day, when they did appear, it 
was quite anothcr thing. 

It was early in the Morning, when marching from a 
little well-fituated Town, called Changu> we had a Ri- 4 
ver to pafs, where we were obliged to ferry ; and had* 
the Tartars had an Intelligence, then had been the Time 
to have attacked us, when the Caravan being over, 
the Rear- Guard was behind ; but they did not appear 
there. 

About three Hours after, when we were entered up- 
on a Defert of about fifteeu or fixteen Miles over, be- 
hold, by a Cloud of Duft they raifed, we faw anEnemy 
was at hand ; and they were at band indeed, for they 
came on upon the Spur. 

The Ckifiefe, our Guard on the Front, who had talk'd 
fo big the Day before, began to ftagger, and the Sol- 
diers frequently looked behind them ; which is a certain 
Sign in a Soldier, that he is juft twÄ^ \a vöbl *wvj * ^M 



238 Tbi Life tni AdvihtuUs tf 
old Pilot was of my Mind ; and, beindnear me, he call- 
od % out, Scignior Ag ^ft, faid he, thofc Fdlows mnft be 
encourmged, or they will roin as all; fbr if the Ttrtart 
come od» they will never ftand it. I am of yoor Mind, 
ihid I : Bot what Coarfe muft be dose t Done, faid hc, 
let fifty of our Men advance, and flank them on each 
Wing, and ehcoorage them, and they will fight like 
brave FeUows in brave Company ; bot without it they 
will every Man turn hit Back. Immediately I rode np 
to onr Leader, and told hjm, who was exaftly of our 
Mind j and accordingly fifty of os mafched to the right 
Wing, and fifty to the left, and the reft made a Line of 
Referve ; for fo we marched,' leaving the laft two hon- 
dred Men to make another Body by themielves, and tp 
eoard the Cameis ; only that, if need were, they fhoula 
Send an handred Men to affift the laft fifty. - 

In a Word» the Tmrtmrs came on» and an intoomeraMe 
Company they wert} how many, we could not teil; 
bot ten thoofand we thought was the leaft. A Party of 
them came on firft» and viewed oor Pofture, traveriing 
the Ground in the Front of oor Line ; and as we fbund 
. them within Gon-ihot, oor Leader ordered the two 
Wings to advance fwiftly, and give them a Salvo on each 
Wing, with their Shot, which was donc; bat they went 
off, and, I fuppofe, went back to give an Account of 
the Reception they were like to meet with; and, indeed, 
that Salute clogged their Stomachs; for t they immediately 
halted, ftood a while to confider of it, and» wheeling off 
to the Left, they gave over the Dcfign, and faid no more 
to us for that Time ; which was very agreeable to our 
Circumftances, which were but very indifferent for a 
Battle with fuch a Number. 

Two Days after this we came to the City Naum, or 
Naunm ; we thanked the Governor for bis Care for us, 
and colleäed to the Value of 100 Crowns, or there- 
abouts, which we gave to the Soldiers fent to guard us ; 
and hcre we refted one Day. This is a Garrifon indeed, 
and there were nine hundred Soldiers kept hcre; but the 
£eafon of it was, that formerly the Mufcowite Frontie rs 
in* n k are I t0 thcm than the y do now » the Mufcovites hav- 
thf ChvW * at P* rtof theCountry (which lies from 

c u * Weft, for about two hundred Miles) as defolate

jind unfit for Ufe ; and more efpecially, being fo very 
remote, and fo difficult to fend Troops thither for its De- 
fence ; for we had yet abovc two thoufand Miles to Muf- 
awy, properly fo called. 

After this we paffed feveral great Rivers, and two 
dreadful Deferts, one of which we were fixteen Days 
paffing over, and which, as I faid, was to be called No 
Man"s Land\ and, on the 13dl of April > we came to the 
Frontiers of the Mufcwite Dominions. I think the firft 
City, or Town, or Fortrefs, whatever it might be called, 
that belonged to the Czar of Mu/covy, was called Argun> 
being on the Weil Side of the River Argun. 

I could not but difcover an infinite Satisfa&ion, that I 
was now arrived in, as I called it, a Chriftian Country ; 
or, at leaft, in a Country governed by Chriftians ; for 
though the Mufcrvit es do, in my Opinion, butjuftde- 
ferve the Name of Chriftians, yet fuch they pretend to 
be, and are very devout in their Way. It wöuld certain- 
\y öccur to any Man who travels the World as I have 
done, and who had any Power of Refle&ion ; I fay, it 
would occur to him to refledl, what a Blefling it is to 
be broaght into the World where the Name of God, 
and of a Redeemer, is known, worlhipped and adored, 
and not, where the People, given up by Heaven to 
ftrong Delufions, worfhip the Devil, and proilrate them- 
felves to Stocks and Stones; worlhip Monitors, Ele- 
ments, horrible-fhaped Animals, and Statues, or Images 
of Monfters. Not a Town or City we pafled through, 
but had their Pagods, their Idols, and their Tempfes, 
and Ignorant People worftupping even the Works of their 
own Hands. 

Now we came where, at leaft, a Face of the Chriftian 
Worihip äppeared, where the Knee was bowed to Je- 
fus ; and wbether ignorantly or not, yet the Chriftian 
'Religion was owned, and the Name of the true God 
was called upon, and adored; and jt made the very 
Recefles of my Soul rejoice to fee it. I faluted the brave 
Scotch Merchant I mentioned above, with my firft Ac- 
knowledgment of this ; and, taking him by the Hand, 
I faid to him, Blefted be God, we are once again come 
among Chriftians. He fmiled, and anfwered, Do not 
rejoice too foon, Countryman > tbsfe Mufcvwtti ^^

As we e=:ered izreo dxe Majcaviu Dominions, a good 
whi'e beicre we came to any coanderable Town, we 
had nochizg to cb&rve there bot this ; firft, that all the 
Rivers run to the Ea:L As I underftood bj the Charts 
«hich lbcie of out Caravans had with them, it was 
piain, that all thofe Rivers ran into the great River 
Yaizsur, or Gammour. This River, by the natural 
Courfe of it, maft ran into the Eaft Sea, or Cbintfe 
Ocean. The Story they teil ns, that the Month of this 
River is choaked up with Bulrufhes of a monftroas ' 
Growth, w*. three Feet aboot, and twenty or thirty 
Feet high, I muft be allowed to fay, I believe nothing 
of ; but as its Navigation is of no Ufe, becaofe there 
is no Trade that Way, the Tartars, to whom alone it 
bclongs, dealing in nothing but Cattle, fo nobody 
that ever 1 heard of, haa bttn cxxno^ ^wou^h, either to 



U O B I N 8 O N C R ü S O E. 2 4 r 
ige down to the Mouth of it in Boats, or come up from 
(he Mouth of it in Ships -, but this is certain, that this 
River running dne Eaft, in the Latitude of 60 Degrees, 
carries a vaifc Concourfe of Rivers along with it, and 
finds an Ocean to empty itfelf in that Latitude ; fo we 
are füre of Sea there. 

Some Leagues to the' North of this River there are 
feveral confiderabie Rivers, whofe Streams ran as due 
North as the Tamour runs Eaft ; and thefe are all found 
to join their Waters with the great River Tartarus, named 
fo from the northermoft Nation« of the Mogul Tartars, 
who, the Cbinefe fay, were the firft Tartan in the World; 
•and who, as our Geographers alledge, are the Gog and 
Magcg .mtntloncd in facred Story. 

Thefe Rivers running all north ward, as well as all 
the other Rivers I am yet to fpeak of, make it evi- 
dent, that the Northern Ooean boonds the Land alfo 
an that Side ; £0 thatf it does not feem rational in the 
leaft to think, that the Land* can extend itfelf to join 
with America ön that Side, or that there is not a Com- 
manication between the Northern and the Eaflern 
Ocean ; bat of this I {hall fay no more ; it was my Ob- 
servation at that Time, and therefore I take Notice of 
it in this Place. We now advanced from the River Ar» 
guna by eafy and moderate Joarnies, and were very 
vifibly obliged to the Care the Czar of Mufcwy has 
taken, to have Cities and Towns built in as many Places 
as are poJfible to place them, where his Soldiers keep 
Garrifon fomething like the ftationary Soldiers placed 
by the Remans in the remoteft Countries of cheir Em« 
pire, fome of which I had read were particularly placed 
in Britain for the Security of Commerce, and for the 
Lodging of Travellers ; and thus it was here ; for 
where ver we came, though at thefe Towns and Stations,* 
the Garrifons and Governor were Rußartz, and profefled 
mere Pagans, facrificing to Idol«, and worfliipping the 
Sun, Moon, and Stars, or all the Hoft of Heavcn ; and 
not only fo, but were of all the Heatbem and Pagans 
that ever I met with, the moft barbarous, except only 
that they did not eat Man's Flefh, as our Savages of 
America did.

Sacrifices to that fenfelefs Log of an Idol ; and thefe 
three Mcn, Priefts belonging to it ; and the feventeefi 
proftrated Wretchcs were the People who brought the 
OfFering, and were making their Prayers to that Stock. 

I confefs I was more moved at their Stupidity, and 
this brutifh Worfhip of an Hgbgoblin, than ever I wa* 
at any thing in my Life ; to fee God's moft glorious 
and bell Creatore, to whom he had granted fo many 
Advantages, even by Creation, above the re$ of the 
Works of his Hands, vefted with a reafonable Soul, and 
that Soul adorned with Faculties and Capacities adopted 
both to honour his Maker, and be honoured by him 5 
I fay, to fee it funk and degenerated to a Degree fo 
more than ftupid, as to proftrate itfelf to a frightful 
Nothing, a mere imaginary Objecl, drefled up by 
trwmfelves, and made terrible to themfelves- by their 
own Contrivance, adorned only with Clouts and Rags ; 
and that this fhould be the Effeft of mere Ignorance, 
wrought up into hellißi Devotion by the Devil him- 
fetf"; who, envying to his Makcr, the Homage and 
Adoration of his Creatures, had dcluded them into fuch 
grofs furfeittng, fordid, and brutifh things, as One would 
think (hould fhock Nature itfelf. 

But what fignified all the Aftonifhment and Reflexion- 
ofThoughts? Thus it was, and I faw it before my 
Eye» ; and there was no Room to wonder at it, or think: ' 
it impoffible ; all my Admiration turned to Rage ; and 
I rode up to the Image or Mönfter, call it what you 
will, and with my Sword cut the Bonnct that was ort 
its Head in two, in the Middle, fo that it hung down 
by one of the Horns ; and one of our Men that was 
with me took hold of the Sheepfkin thatcovered it, 
and pulled at it, when, behold, a moft hideous Cutcry 
and Howling ran through the Village, and two or three 
hundred People came about my Ears, fo that I was 
glad to fcour for it ; for we faw ibme had Bows and

This, I confefs, put new Thoughts into my Head 
for awhile; but I harped upon the fame String ftilt; 
and all that Day I was nneafy to put my Projeft in 
Execution. Towards the Evening the Scots Merchant 
»et me by Accident in our Walk about the Town, 
and defired to fpcak with me : I believe, faid he, I 
have put you off of your good Defign ; I have been a 
little concerned about it ünce ; for I abhor the Idol and 
Jdolatry, as much.as you can do. Truly, faid I, you 
kave put it off a little as to the Execution of it, but 
you have not put it all out of my Thoughts ; and, I 
believe, I mall do it ftill before I quit this Place, tho* 
I were to be delivered up tathemfor Satisfaäion. No, 
no, faid he ; God forbid they ihould deliver you up to 
flieh a Crew of Monilers ! they (hall not do that nei- 
ther ; that would be . murdering you» indeed. Why, 
faid I, how would they ufe me ? TJfe you ! faid he ; I'll 
teil yon how they ferved a poor Rußan, who affronted 
thcm in their Worfhip juil as you did, and whom they 
took Prifoner ; after they had lamed him with an Ar- 
iK>w,. that he could not run away, they took him, and 
ßripped him ftark naked, and fet him upon the Top 
of the JdoKMonfter, and ftood all round him, and ftiot 
as many Arrows into him as would flick ovcr his 
whole Body ;. and then they burnt him, and all the 
Arrows fticking in- him, as a Sacrince to the Idol; 
And was this the fame Idol ?• faid I. Yes, faid he, the 
very fame. Well, faid I, I will teil you a Story : So* 
\ related the Story of our Men at Madägafcar, and how 
they burnt and facked the Village there, and killed 
Man, Woman, and Child, for their murdering one of 
our Men* juft as it is related before ; and when I had 
done, I added, that I thought we ought to do fo to 
this Village. 

He liftened very attentively to- the Story ; but when 
1 talked of doing fo to that Vilkge, .faid he, You mif- 
take very much ; it was not this Village, it was almoft 
a hundred Miles from this Place ; but it was the fame

t£d before. The People feemed to be all at their Reft ; 
©nly, that in thc grcat Hut, or Tent, as wc called it, 
where wc faw ttfe three Pricfts, whom we miftook for 
Butchers, we faw a Light, and, going* up clofe to the 
Door, we heard geopie talking, as if there were five 
-or fix of them ; we concluded therefbre, that if we 
fet Wildfire to the Idol, thefe Men would come out 
immediately, and run up to. the Place to refcue it from 
the Deftru&ion that we intended for it ; and what to 
do with them we knew not. Once we thought of 
earrying it away, and fetting Fire to it at aDiltance; 
bat when we came to handle it, we found it tqo bulky 
ibr our Carriage ; fo we were at a Lofs again. The 
fecond S cot/man was for fetting Fire to the Tent, or 
.Hut, and knocking the Creatures that were there on 
the Head, when they came out ; but I could not joia 
■with that; I was again ft killing them, if it was poffible 
to bc avoided. Well then, faid the. Scots Merchant, I 
will teil yon what we will do ; we will try to take them 
Prifoners, tie* their Hands, arid make them ftand and fee 
their Idol deftroyed. 

As it happened, we had Twine or Packthread enough 
about us, which we ufed to tie our*Fire-works toge- 
tber with ; fo we refolveoS to attack thefe People firir, 
and with as little Noife as we could. The firit thing 
.we did, we knocked at the Door, when one of the 
Priefts coming to the Door, we immediately feized upon 
bim, Äopped his Mouth, and tied his'Hands behindhim, 
and led him to the Idol, where we gagged him, that he 
snight not make a Noife ; tied his Feet alfo together, and 
left him on the G round. 

Two of us then waited at the Door, expe&ing that 
another would come out to fee what the Matter was ; 
but we waited folong tili thcthird Man came back to 
ns ; and then, nobody coming out, we knocked again 
gently, and immediately out came two more, and we 
Jerved them juft in the fame manner, but were obliged 
to go all with them, aod lay them down by the Idol 
foroe Diöance from one another ; when, going back, 
we found two more were come out to the Door, and 
a third ftoöd behind . them within the Door. We 
feized the two, and immediately tied theou* N*k&*> \.W

When the Forae we had thiwwn in had fiUed the Hat

wjiich flamed like" a Candle, «od, foUowiog it in, we

faid, we broaght them oat of the Hoafe, or Hot, firft; 
for, indced, we were not able to bear the Smoke aay

carried them all together to the Idol ; when we came 
there we feil to work with. him ; and ffirit we daobed 
him all over, and hii Robe» alfo, with Tar, and fad 
oiher StufF at we had, which was TaUow mixcd with 
Brimftone ; then we ftopped bis Eye«, and Ears, and

there lay a Heap of dry Forage, whether Straw or Ro&cs 
I do not remember ; away he and the other Scetfman 
ran, and fetched their Arms fuil of that. When we 
had done this, we took all our Prifoners, and broaght

Mouths, and made them ftand «p, and fet them jaft

Whole. 

We ftayed by it a Quarter of an Hour, or thereabouts r 
tib the Powder in the Eyes, and Mouth, and Ears of the 
Idol blcw up, and, as we could perceive, had fjplic and« 
deforraed the Shape of it ; and, in a Word, tili we faw 
it burn into a mere Block or Log of Wood; and then 
fetting the dry Forage to it, we found it would be fooiv 
quite confumed, fo we began to think of going away ;. 
bat the Scot/man faid : No, we mufl not go ; for thefe 
poor deluded Wretches will all throw themfelves into 
the Fire, and burn themfelves with the Idol ; £6 we re~ 
fblved to ftay tili the Forage was burnt down too, and- 
then we came away, and left them. 

In the Morning we appeared among our Fellow 
Travellers, exceeding bufy in getting ready for our 
Journey 5 nor could. any Man fuggeft, that we had becn^ 
any-where but in our Beds, as Travellers might be fup- 
pofed to be, to fit themfelves for the Fatigues of that 
Day's Journey. 

But itdid not end fo; for the next Day came a- great 
Multitude of the Country-People, not only of this 
Village, but of an Hundred more, for aught I know, to 
the Town-Gates v and, in a moft outrageous Manner, 
demanded- Satisfa&ion of the Ruffiatt Governor, for the 
infulting their Priefb, and burning their great Cham- . 
Gü-Tbaungu, fuch an hard Name they gare the mon- 
ftrous Creature they worfhipped ; the reople of Nert- 
xsttßaf were at firft in a great Confternation ; for, they 
faid, the Tartan were no lefs than thirty Thoufand, and 
that in a few Days more, they would be one hundred. 
Thoufand ftrong. 

The Ruffian Governor fent out Mefiengers- to appeafe 
tikem, and gave them all the good Word» imaginable. 
He aüured them he knew nothing of it, and that there 
had not a Soul of his Garrifon been abroad; that itr 
could not be from anybody there ; and if they would 
let him know who it was, they fhould be exemplarily 
ponifhed. They returned, haughtily, That ^ all the

bat had fuppofed we ihould have taken that Side of 
the Lake, whereas we very happily took the South 
Side ; and in two Days more we faw them not, for they v 
believing we were füll before them, pufhed *>n, tili they 
came to the River UtLla ; this is a very great River whea, 
it paffes farther North ; but when we camc to it, we 
found it narrow and fordable. 

The third Day they either found their Miftake, or 
had Intelligence of us, and came pouring in upon us, 
towards the Dufk of the Evening. We had, to our 
great Satisfa&ion, juft pitched upon a Place for our 
Camp, which was very convenient for the Night; for 
as we were upon a Defert, though but at the Begin- 
ning of it, that was above five hundred Miles over, wc 
had noTowns to lodge at, and, indeeJ, expeäed none 
but the City Jarawena, which we had yet two Days^ 
March to ; the Defert, however, had fome few Woods 
in it on this Side, and little Rivers, which ran all inte» 
the great River UdJa. It was in a narrow Streight be- 
tween two fmall, but very thick Woods, that we pitched 
our little Camp for that Night, expecüng to be attackedt 
in the Night. 

Nobody knew but ourfelves, what we were purfued 
for v but as it was ufual for the Mogul Tartars to go* 
about in Troops in that Defert, fo the Caravans alway* 
fortify themfelves every Night againft them, as againft. 
Armies of Robbers; and it was therefore no new thing, 
to be purfued. 

But we had this Night, of all the Night! of our 
Travels, a mofl advantageous Camp ; for we lay be- 
tween two Woods, with a little Rivulet running junV 
before our Front ; fo that we could not be furrounded» 
or attacked any Way, C but in our Front or Rear ; jver 
took Care alfo to make our Front as firong as we could,. 
by placing pur Packs, with our Camela and Horfes, all" 
in a Line, on the Infide of the River, and we felled 
ferne Tree/s to our Rear. 

In this Pofture we encamped for the Night; but the: 
Enemy was upon us baföre we had .finiihed our Sifaa«

the Mcn to be delivered to them, that had abufed their 
Fncite, and burnt thcir God Cham-CbiSlbaungu, that 
thcy might burn them with Fire ; and, upon this, they 
faid, they would go away, and do us no farther Harm , 
otherwifc they would burn us all wich Fire. Our 
Men looked very blank at this Meflage, and began 
to ftare at one another, to fee who looked with mofl 
GuiJt in their Faces ; but, nohody was the Word» nobody 
did it. The Leadcr of the Caravan fent Word, he was 
well aflured it was not done by any of our Camp; that 
wc were pcaceable Merchants travellingon ourBufinefs; 
that we had done no Harm to thejn, or to any one elfe* 
and therefore they muft look farther for their Enemies, 
who had injured them, for we were not the People ; fo 
defired them notto difturb us; for if they did, we fhould 
defend ourfelves. 

They were far from being fatisfied with this for an 
Anfwcr, and a great Crowd of them catne down in 
the Morning, by Break of Day, to our Camp ? but, 
fceing us in fuch an advantageous Situation, they dürft 
come no farther than the Brook in our Front, whcre- 
they ftood, and (hewed us fuch a Number, as, indeed, 
terrified us very much ; for thofe that fpoke leaft of 
them, fpoke of tcn Thoufand. Here they ftood, and 
looked at us awhile, and then fetting up a great Hawl, 
they let fly a Cloud cf Arrows among us ; but we wer* 
well enough fortified foi tiiat, for we were fheltered under 
our Baggage; and I do rot ren.cmber that one Man of 
us was hurt. 

Somc Time afttr this, we faw them move a little to 
our Right, and cxpcclvd them on the Rear, when a 
cunning Fellow, a Cojkck, as they call them, of Jara- 
'ikena, in the Pay of the Mujlo'vites, callingto theLead-

People away to SibtUka ; this was a City four or five

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 253 

a long Story, that the People who had burnt their Cbam- 
Chi-Tbaungu, were gone to Sibeilka, with a Caravan of 
Mifcreantts, as he callcd them ; that is to fay, Cbri- 
ßians ; and that they were refolved to burn the God 
Schal-Ifar> belonging to the Tongtißs. 

As this Fellow was a mere Tartar, and perfe&ly fpoke 
their Language ; he eounterfeited fo well» that they all 
. took it from him, and away they drove, in a moft vio* 
lent Harry, to Sibeitta, which, it feems, was Ave Days 
Journey to the South, and in lefs than three Hours they 
were intirely out of oor Sight, and we never heard any 
more of them, hör ever knew whether they went to that 
other Place called Sibeilka, or no. 

So we pafled fafely on to the City of Jaranvena, 
where there was a Garrifon of Mufcwitts ; and there we 
refted five Days, the Caravan being exceedingly fatigued 
with the laft Day*5"March, and with Want of Reft in the 
Night. 

I From this City we had a frightful Defert, which held 
us three- and -twenty Days March. We furniihed our- 
felves with fome Tents here, fbr the better accommodat- 
ing oorfelves in the Night ; and the Leader of the Ca- 
ravan procured fixteen Carriages, or Waggons, of the 
Country, for carrying our Water and Provifions ; and 
thefe Carriages were our Defence every Night round our 
little Camp ; fo that had the Tartars äppeared, unlefa 
they had been very numerous indeed, they would not 
have been able to hurt ns. 

We may well be fuppofed to want Reft again after 
this long Journey ; for, in this Defert, we faw neither 
Houfeor Trce, or fcarce a Bufh ; we faw, indeed, abun- 
dance of the. Sable- hunters, as they called them; thefe are 
all Tartars of the Mogul Tartary t of which this Countrjr 
is a Part ; and they frequently attack fmall Caravans ; 
but we faw no Numbers of them together. I was cu- 
rious to fee the Sable- (kins they catched ; but I could 
never fpeak with any of them ; for they dürft not come 
near us, neither dürft we ftraggle from our Company to 
go near them. 

After we had pafled this Defert, we came into a 
Country pretty well inhabited ; that is to fay, we found

of it bring another Deferr, which took us up twelve 
Days fevere travelling, wichoot Houfe, Tree or Bufln 
bat were obliged agtm to carry our own Provifions, as 
well Water as Bread. After we were out of this Defert, 
and had travelled two Days, - we came to Janexay r z 
Mufiontite City 01» Station, on the great River Janezap. 
This River, they told as, parted Evrtpe from Jlfia, tho* 
our Map makers, as I am told, do not agree to it; 
fcowever, it is ccrtainty the Eaftern Boundary of the an- 
tient Siberia, which now makes a Provence oaly of the 
▼aft Muftovite Empire, bat is itfelf eqaal in Bignefs tfr 
the whole Empire of Germ/sny. 

And yet here I oWerved Ignorance and Paganifm flill 
prevailed, except in the Mufcwiu Garrifons; all th^ 
Conntry between the River Oby> and the River Jam%ay y 
is as intirely Pagan, and the Peof fe as barbarom, at the 
remoteft of the Tartars, nay, as any Nation, for angst 
I know, in Jfia or x Amirica. I alfo found, which 1 I ob« 
ferved to the Mukwite Governors, whoni I had Oppor- 
tanity to con verfe with, that the Pagans are not mach 
the wifer, or the nearer Chriftianity, for being ander the 
Mufiwite Government ; which they acknowledged was 
true enough, but, they faid, it was none of their Bafi- 
nefs : That if the Czar expe&ed to convert bis SiberUw^ 
or Ttnguefe, or TarUr Subjekts, it fhould be done by fend- 
ing Clergymen among them not Soldiers ; and they add- 
ed, with more Sincerity than I expe&ed, that they foond 
it was not fo mach the Concern of their Monarch, to 
make the People Chrißians, as k was to make them 
Subjeäs. 

From this River, to the great River Oby, we crofled a 
wild uncultivated Country ; I cannot fay *tis a barbaroos 
Soil ; 'ta only barren of People, and good Manage- 
ment ; otherwife h is in itfelf a moft pleafant, fraitfol, 
and agreeable Country. What Inhabitaats we foond in 
it are all Pagans, except fuch as are fent among them 
from Rx/fia; for this is .the Country I mean on both 
Sides the River Oby y whither the Mufcrvitt Criminals, 
that are not pat to Death, are banimed, and from 
whence ic is next to impoflible they ihould tver com« 
away.

We Kid bccn now almftft jfmn Moatfa* on owr.

iag that we wer« boand fbr England, and not-fbr Mofi 
tmv, to confider how to difoofc of oorfe}ves. They 
told 01 of Sied«» and Rein-ßecr to carry tu oyer the 
Snow in the Wlnter-timc ; and» indeed» they have fuchr 
things, as it woold be incrcdible to relate the Par- 
ticalars of, by which means the Rnßam travel more 
in the Winter than they eaa in Sommer * becaofe in- 
thefe Sledge» they are able to run Night and Day; the 
Snow besag firosen, ii oae untvorfal Covering tö> Na«

Lake»» are- all fiaooth, and hard -ara Stone i and they* 
ran npon the Sorftae, withoat any Regard to wbat is* 
anderneath. 

Bat I had no Occafion to pu(h at a Winter Journey of 
this kind ; I was boand to England* not to Moßtnv, and 
sny Route lay two Ways ; either I muß go on as- the 
Caravan went, tili I came to Jariflaw, and. then go off 
Wert for Narva, and tha Gulph of Finland, and fo ei- 
thcr by Sea or Land to Danttäck, where X might poffihly 
feil my China Cargo to good Advantage, or I muß leave 
the Caravan at a little Town on the Dwina, from 
whence I had bat fix Days by Water to Arcb-Angel+ 
and from thence might be füre of Shipping, eithcr to 
England, Holland, or Hambnrgb. 

Now to go any of thefe Journies in tha Winter^ 
would have been prepoflerous ; . for as to DantzicA, the 
Baitick would be frozen up, and 1 could not get Pak 
fage; and to go by Land in thofe Countries, was far 
lefs fafe than among the Mogul Tartan; likewife to 
Arch. Angel in Qäober, all the Ships would be gone 
from thence, and even the Merchants, who dwell there 
in Summer,, retire South to Mo/cow in the Winter, 
when the Ships are gone; fo that I ihould have ao- 

thiug 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 257 

fbfng bot Extremity of Cold to cncoanter, with a Scap. 
city of Provifions, and muft lie there in an erapty Town 
all thc Winter : So that, upon thc whole, I thought it 
mach my better Way to Jet the Caravan go, and to 
make Provifion to winter where I was, vhs. at Tobolßi 
in Siberta* ki the Latirude of fixty Degrees, where £ 
was. füre of three things to wear out a cold Winter 
with* whc. Plenty of Provifion, fach as the Country a£- 
forded, & warm Houfe, with Fuel enough, and excellent 
Company ; of all which I fhall give a füll Account in ita 
Place. 

I was Bovr in a quite different Climate from my 
beloved Ifland, where I never feit Cold, except when 
I had my Aguc ; on the contrary, I had much fo d© 
to bear my Cloaths on my Back, and never made any 
Fire bot without Doors, and for my Neceffity, in drefT- 
ing my Food, &c. Now I made me three good Veft», 
with large Robes or Gowns over them to hang down 
to the Feet, and batton clofe to the Wrifts, and att 
thefe lined wich Fürs, to make them fufficiently 
warm, 

As to a warm Houfe, I muft confeft, I greatly dif- 
like out Way in. England, of making Fites in every 
Room in the Houfe, in open Cbimneys, which, when 
the Fire was out, always kept the Air in the Room 
cold as the Climate. But taking an Apartment in a 
good Houfe in the Town, I ordered a Chimney to be 
ouilt like a Furnace, in the Centre of fix feveral Rooms, 
like a Scove, the Funnel to carry the Smoke went up 
one Way, the Door to come at the Fire went in ano- 
ther, and all the Rooms were kept equally warm» 
bat no Fire feenj like as they heat the Bagnios ia 
England, 

By this Mean» we had always the fame Climate in all 
the Rooms, and an equal Heat was preferved ; and how 
cold foever it was without, it was always warm within ; 
and yet we faw no Fire, nor were ever incommoded with 
any Smoke. 

The moft wonderful thing of all was, that it (hould

After 



k ROBINSON CRUSOE. i$? 
After amufing, tbem with thefe Riddles in Govern- 
ment for a while, I opened the Cafe, and told them 
the Story at large ©f my livmg in the Iüand, and how 
I managed both myfolf and the Feople there that were 
under rae, jnft as 1 have fince minuted it down. Tbey 
were exceedingly taken with the Story, and efpecialiy 
the Prince, who told me wich a Sigh, that the troe 
Greatnefs of Life was to be Mailer of oarfelves ; that 
he woujd not have exchanged fuch a State of Life as 
xnine, to have been Czar of Mufcvvy ; and that he found 
more Felicity in the Retirement he feetned to be ba- 
nilhed to there, thaneverhe found in the higheft.Au- 
thority he enjoyed in the Court of his Matter the Czar : 
That the Height of human Wifdom'was to bring our 
Tempers down to our Circumftances, and to aiakea 
Calm within, under the Weight of the greateft Störm 
withoüt. When he came ürft hither, he faid, he nfed 
to tear the Hair frora his Head, and the Cloaths from 
his Back, as others had done before him ; but a little 
Time and Confideration had made him look into hira- 
folf, as well as round himfelf, to things without : 
That he found the Mind of Man, if it was but önce 
brought to reflecl upon the State of univerfal Life, and 
how little this World was concerned in its troe Feli- 
city, was perfedUy capable of making a Felicity for 
itfelf, fully fatisfying to itfelf, and fuitable to its own 
beft Ends and Defires, with but very little Afiiftance 
from the World. That Air to breathe in, Food to 
fuftain Life, Cloaths for Warmth, and Liberty for Exer- 
eife, in order to Health, compleated in his Opinion, all 
that the World could do for us ; and though the Great- 
nefs, the Aothority, the Riches, and the Pleafures, 
which fome enjoyed in the World, and which he had 
enjoyed his Share of, had mueh in them that was agree- 
able to us, yet he obfcrved, that all thofe things chiefly 
grati6ed the coarfeft of our AfFe&ions; fuch as our 
Ambition, our particiliar Pride, our Avance, our Va- 
nity, and our Senfuality; all which were, indeed, the 
raere Produft of the worft Part of Man, were in them- 
fei ves Crimes, and had in them the Seeds of all man- 
ner of Crimes ; but neither were related to, <w con-

take the Liberty to aflc you a Queftion ? With all my 
Heart, faid he. If the Door of your Liberty was open'd» 
faid I, wouid.not yoa take hold of it to deliver yourfelf 
fron» this Exile.? 

HoM> 



ttOBINSON CRUSOE. 261 

Hold, faid he, your Qaeftion is fubtle, and requires 
Tome ferious juft Diftin&rons, to give it a iJcccre An- 
fwer ; and I'U give it yoa from the Bottom of my 
Heart. Nothing that I know of in this World woald 
raove me to delirer myfelf from this State of Banifh- 
ment, except thefe two: Firft, ThetEnjoyment of my 
Relations ; and, Secondly, A little warmer Ciimate ; 
but I proteil to yoa, that to go back to the Pomp of 
the Court, the Glory, the Power, the Hurry of a Mi- 
nifter of State; the Wealth, the Gaiety, and the Plea- 
fures, that is to fay, Foilics of a Courtier ; if my Ma- 
fier fhould fend me Word this Moment, that he reftores 
me to all he banilhed me from ; I proteft, if I know 
myfelf at all, I woald not leave this Wildernefs, thefe 
Deferts, and thefe frozen Lakes, for the Palace of 
Mofcow. 

Bat, my Lord, faid I, perhaps yoa not only are ba- 
nißied from the Fleafures of the Court, and from the 
Power, and Aathority, and Wealth, you enjoyed be- 
fore; but yoa may be abfent too from fome of the 
Conveniencies of Life ; your Eflate, perhaps, confif- - 
cated, and your ErTeds plundered; and the Supplies 
- left yoa here may not be fuitable to the ordinary De- 
xnands of Life. 

Ay, faid he, that is as yoa fappofe me to be a Lord, 
er a Prince, &c. So, indeed, I am ; bat yoa are now 
to confder me only as a Man, an human Creature, not 
at all diftinguiihed from another ; and fo I can fuffer no 
Want, -nnlefs I fhould be vifited with Sicknefs and Di- 
ftempers. However, to put the Qaeftion out of Dif- 
pate ; yoa* fee oar Manner ; we are in this Place five 
Perfons of Rank ; we Ihre perfe&ly retired, as faited to 
a State of Banifhment ; we have fomething refcued from 
the Shipwreck- of our Fortanes, which keeps as from 
the mere Neceffity of hanting for our Food, but the 
poor Soldiers who are here, without that Help, live in 
as mach Plenty as we. They go into the Woods, and 
catch Sables and Foxes ; the Labour of a Month will 
maintain them a Yearj and as the Way of Living is 
not «xpenfive, fo it is not hard to get fufficient to our« 
felves : So that Objeäion is out of Doors.

ROBINSON CRUSOE. '263 

It was now Marcb, and the Days grown eonfider- 
rably longer, and the Weathar at leaft tolerable ; Co other 
Travellers began to prepare Sledges to carry them over 
the Snow, and to get things ready to be going ; but 
my Meafures being fixed, as I have faid, for Arch- 
Angel, and . not for Mufcwy or tbe B alt ick > I made no 
Motion ; knowing very well, that the Ships from the 
South do not fet out for that Part of the World tili 
May or June ; and that if I was there at the Beginning 
of Augufl, it would be as foon as any Ships would be 
N ready to go away ; and therefore, I (ay, I made na 
Hafte to be gone, as others did j in a Word» I faw a 
great rnany People, nay, all the Travellers, go away 
Before me. It feems, every Year they go from thence 
to Mofcrw for Trade; «was. to carry Fürs, and buy 
Neceßaries with them, which they bring back to für- 
nifh their Shops; alfo others went on the fame Errand 
to Arcb Angel; but then they alfo, being to come back 
again aboye eight hundred Miles, went all out before 
me. 

In (hört, about the latter End of Maj, I began to 
rnake all ready to pack op ; and at I was doing this, it 
occurred to me, that Üeeing all thefe People were ba- 
ni(hed by the Czar of Mufcovy to SiUria, and yet, when 
they came there, were at Liberty to go whither they 
would ; why did they n»t then go away to any Part of 
the World where-evcr they thought fit ? And I began to 
examine what ihould hinder them from making fuch an 
Attempt. 

But my Wonder was over, when I entered upon 
that Subject with the Perfoa I have mentioned, who 
anfwered me thus: Confider, firft, Sir, faid he, the 
Place where we are; and, fccondly, the Condition we 
are in ; efpecially, faid he, the Generality of the People 
who are baniflied hither. We are furrourided, faid he, 
with ftronger things than Bars and Bolts i on the 
North Side i» an unnavi gable Ocean, where Ship nevet 
failed, and Boat never fwam ; neither, if we had both, 
could we know whither to go with them. Every other 
Way, faid he« we have above a thoufand Miles to pafs 
through the Czar's own Dominions, and By-ways ut- 
terly irapaifeble, except by che Raada x&ad&V?} ^ögäQ^*-

was fincere, when I cold you I would not go back, if I 
was recalled even to be all that once I was in the Court, 
and with the Favour of the Czar my Maller? Did you 
believe me, my Friend, to be an honeft Man, or did yois 
think me to be a boalling Hypocrite ? Here he ftopped, 
as if he would hear what I would fay ; but, indced, I 
foon afcer perceived, that he ftopped becaufe his Spiritf 
were in Motion ; his Heart was füll of Str'uggles, and 
he could not go on. I was, I confefs, aftonifhed at 
the thing, as well as at the Man, and I ufed fome Ar« 
guments with him to urge hira to fet himfelf free : That 
he ought to look upon thii as a Door opened by Hea~ 
ven for his Deliverance, and a Summont by Provi- 
dence, who bäs the Care and good Difpofition of all 
Events, to do himfelf good, and to render himfelf ufe- 
ful in the World. 

He had by this Time recovered himfelf: How do> 
you know, Sir, faid he, warmly, bat that inftead of a 
Summons from Heaven, it may be a Feint of another 
Jnftrument, reprefenting, in all the alluring Colours, to 
me, the Shew of Felicity as a Deliverance, which may 
in itfelf be my Snare, and tend directly to my Ruin t 
Here I am free from the Temptation of returning to 
iny former miferable Grcatnefs ; there I am not iure, 
but that all the Seeds of Pride, Ambition, Avance, and 
Luxury, which I know remain in my Nature, may revive 
and take Root, and, in a Word, again overwhelm me ; 
and then the happy Prifoner, whom you fee now Ma- 
lter of his Sonl's Liberty, (hall be the miferable Slave of 
his own Senfes, in the füll of all perfonal Liberty. Dear 
Sir, let me remain in this blefled Confinement, banifhed 
from the Crimes of Life, rather than purchafe a Shew 7 
of Freedom, at the Expence of the Liberty of my Rea- 
fon/ and at the Expence of the future Happinefs which 
now I have in my View, but ft^all then, I fear, quickly

1 found he took for the Rarity of it, but would not take 
any more ; and fent Word by my Scrvant, that he de-

When I came to him, he told me, I knew what 
had paßed between us, and hoped I would not xnovc 
him any more in that Affair ; but that, fincc I made 
fuch a gencrous OiFer to him, he af*ed me, if I had 
Kindnefs enough to offer the fame to anoiher Per fön 
that hc would name to mc, in whom he had a ereat 
Share of Concern. I told him, That I could not (ay I 
inclined to do fo much for any one but himfelf, for ' 
whom I had a particular Value, and (hould have been 
glad to have been the Inflrument of bis Deliverance ; 
however, if he would pleafe to name the Perfon to me, 
I would give him my Anfwer, and hoped he would 
not bc difpleafed with me, if he was with my Anfwer. 
He told me, it was only his Son, who, though I had 
not feen, yet was in thc fame Condition with himfelf, 
and above two hundred Miles from him, on the other 
Side the Oby ; but that, if 1 confcnted, hc would fend

I made no Hefttation, but to!d him I would do it : 
I made fome Ceremony in kuing him underiland, that 
it was wholly on his Account ; and that feeing I could

Account of the Traffic we raade here. 

It was the Beginning of Juxe, when I left this remote 
Place, a City, 1 believc, little heard of in the World ; 
and, indeed, it is fo far out of the Road of Commerce, 
that I know not how it fhould be much talked of. 
We were now come to a very fmall Caravan, being 
only thirty-two Horfes and Cameis in all, and all of 
them paffed for mine, though my new G tieft was Pro- 
prietor of eleven of them. It was moft natural alfo, 
that I fhould take more Servants'with me than I had be- 
fore, and the yoong Lord paffed for my Steward ; what 
great Man I paffed. for myfelf, J know not, neither did 
it concern me to inquire. We had here the worft and 
the largeft Defert to pafs over that we met with in all 
the Journcy ; ir.deed I call it the worft, becaufe the 
Way was very deep in fome Places, and very uneven 
in others ; the beft we had to fay for it, was, that we 
though t we had no Troops of Tartan and Robbers to 
fear, and that they never came on this Side the River 
O/y, or at leaft but very feldom -, but we fonnd it other- 
wife. 

My young Lord had with him a faithful Mufco*viie 
Servant, or rather a Siberian Servant, who was per. 
fe&ly acquainted with the Country ; and who Jed us 
by private Roads, that we avoided Coming into the 
principal Towns and Cities, upon the great Road, fuch 
as Turren, Soloy-Kam^ßoy^ ar.d feveral others; becaufe 
the Mufcmite Garrifons which are kept there, are very 
curious and ftrift in their Obfervation upon Travellers, 
and fearching left any of the banifhed Perfons of Note 
fhould make their Efcape that Way into Mu/cc-vy ; but 
by this Means, as we were kept out of the Cities, fo 
cur whole Journey was a Defert, and we were obligcd 
to encamp and lic in our Tents, when we might have 
had good Accömmo&aüotv m tfis Cities on the Way : 



ROBINSONCRUSOE. 269 
This the young Lord was fo fenfible of, that he would 
not allow us to lie abroad, when we came to feveral 
Cities on thc Way ; but lay abroad himftlf, with his 
Servant, in the Woods, and met us always at the ap- 
pcinted Places. 

We were juil entered Europe, having pafled the River 
Kama, which. in thefe Parts, is the Boundary between 
Europa and Aßa ; and the firft City on the European Side 
was called Soloy-Kamo/hoy, which is as rauch as to fay f 
the great City on the River Kama ; and herc we thoughc 
to have feen fome evident Alteration in the People, their 
Manners, their Habit, their Religion, and their Bufi- 
nefs ; but we were miitaken ; for as we had a vaft De- 
fert to pafs, which, by Relation, is neär feven hundred 
Miles long in fome Places, but not above two hundred 
Miles over where we päfled itj fo, tili we came paft 
that horrible Place, we found very little Difference be- 
tween that Country, and the Mogul Tarlary ; the People 
moilly Pagans, and little better than the Savages of Ame- 
rica -, their Houfes and Towns füll of Idols, and their 
Way of Living wholly barbarous, except in the Cities , 
as above, and the Villages near them ; wherc they are 
Chriitians, as they call themfelves, zf the Grrek Church; 
but even thefe have their Religion minglcd with fo 
many Reliques of Superftition, that it is fearce to be 
known in fome Places for mere Sorcery and Witch- 
craft. . . 

In paffing this Foreft, \ thought, indeed, we mulr^ 
after all our Darigers were, in our Imagination, efeaped, 
as before, have been plundered and robbed, and per- 
haps murdered by a Troop of Thieves ; of what Coun- 
try they were, whether the roving Bands of the Oßia- 
'.Li, a kind of Tartan, or wild People 00 the Banks of 
the Oby, had ranged thus far ; or whether they were 
the Sable- hunters of Siberia, I am yet at a Lofs to 
know ; but they were all on Horfeback, carried Bows 
and Arrows, and were at firft about five- and- forty in 
N umher ; they came fo near to us, as within about 
two Mufquet-fhot ; and, afking no Queftions, they fnr- 
rounded us with their Horfe, and looked very earneftly 
upon us twice ; at length they placed themfelves juffc* 
in our Way ; upon which we dre« w^ *\xw V^^^JjJgP

This was (mall Cümfbrt to ns ; howercr, we had no 
Remedy : There was' on öur Lcft Hand, at aboat a 
Qoarter of a Mile's Diftance, * a iittle Grore or Clomp 
ofTrecs, which ftopd clofe togcthcr, and vcry near 
the Road ; I immediately refolvcd we wonld advance 
to thofe Trees, and fortify ourfelves as well as we 
could there ; for, firft, I conddered that the Trees wonld 
in a great' Meafure cover us from their Arrows ; and, in 
the next Place, they could not come to Charge us in a 
Body : It Was, indeed, my 'old Portuguefi Pilot who 
ropofcd it ; and who had this Exctliency attending 
iim. namely, that he was always readieft and moft apt 
10 direc"l and encourage us, in Cafes of the moft Dan- 
ger. We advanced immediately with what Speed we 
could, and gamed that Iittle Wood, the Tartan or 
Thieves, for we knew not what to call them, keep- 
ing their Stand, and not attempting to hinder us, 
When we^rame thither, we found, to our great Satif- 
fafiion, that it was a fwampy fpringy Piece of Ground, 
and, on the oiher Side, a very great Spring of Water, 
ivhich, running out in a Iittle Kill or Brook, was a

dred, bat were very large, and ftood p; etty thick ^ fo 
that as i'oon as we got in, we faw ourfelves perfe&ly fafe 
from the Enemy, unlefs they alighted and attacked us 
on Foot. 

Bat to make this jnore difEcult, our Portugutfi, witb 
indefatigäble Application, cut down great Arms of the 
Trees, and laid them hanging, not cot quite off, from 
one Tree to another ; fo that he made a continued 
Fence, almoft round us. 

We ftaid here, waiting the Motion of the Enemy 
fome Hours, without perceiving they made any Offer to 
ftir ; when, about two Hours before Night, they came 
down directly upon us j and, though we had not per- 
ceived it, we found they had been joined by fome more 
of the fame, fo that they were near fourlcore Horfey 
whereof, however, we fanfy'd fome were Women.- 
They came on tili they were within half a Shot of our 
little Wood, when we nred one Mufquet without Ball r 
and called to them in the Rußian Tongue, to know what 
they wanted, and bid them keep off; but, as if they 
knew nothing of what we faid, they came on wich a 
double Fury directly up to the Wood-fide, not imagining 
we were fo barricado'd, that they could not break in : 
Our old Pilot was our Captain, as well as he had been 
our Engineer ; and defired of us, not to fire upon them 
tili they came within Piftol fhot, that we might be füre 
to kill ; and that when we did fire, we (hould be füre to 
take good Aim. We bade him give the Word of Com- 
mand ; which he delayed fo long, that they were, fome 
of them, within two Pikes Length of us when we 
nred. 

We aim cd fo trae (or Providence direcled our Shot fo 
füre) that we killed fourteen of them at the firft Volley, 
and wounded feveral others, as alfo feveral of their 
Horfes ; for we had all of us loaded our Pieces with 
two or three Bullets apiece, at leaft. 

They were terribly furprifed with our Fire, and re* 
treated immediately about one hundred Rods from us ; 
in which Time we loaded our Pieces again, and, feeing 
them keep that Diftance, we fallied out» au\<L ^uu^s.-

Eod of my Jonrney, after fo many Dificulties and Ha-

for my Partner, he was raging : He declared, that to 
lofe his Goods would be his Rain ; and he would rather 
die than be ßarved; and he was for fighting to the lad 
Drop. 

The young Lord, as gallant as ever Flefh ihewed it- - 
felf, was for fighting to the lad alfo ; and my old Pikt 
was of the Opinion we were able to refilt them all, in 
the Situation we then were in ; and thus we fpent the 
Day in Debates of what we fhould do ; but, towards 
Evening, we found that the Number of our Enemics 
Hill increafed : Perhaps, as they were abroad in feveral 
Parties for Prey, the firft had fent out Scouts to call for 
Help, and to acquaint them of the Booty ; and we did 
not know but by the Möiüin^xYiey mv^u» to&bie a ^reater

Number; fo I began to enquire of thofe People .we 
had brought from Tobolßi, if there was no other, or 
more private Way 3, by which we might avoid them in 
the Night, and, perhaps, either retreat to fome Town, 
or get Help to guard us over the Defert. 

The Siberian, who was Servant to the young Lord, 
told us 9 if we defigned to avoid them, and not fight, he 
would engage to carry us off in the Night to a Way 
that went North towards the River Fttrax % by which he 
made no queftion but we might get away, and the Tar- 
tan never the wifer ; but he faid, his Lord had told 
him he would not return, but would rather chufe to fight. 
I told him, he miftook his Lord 5 for that he was too 
wife a Man to love fighting for the Sake of it ; that I 
knew his Lord was brave enough, by what he had fhew- 
ed already ; but that his Lord knew better, than to de- 
fire to have feventeen or eighteen Men fight five hundred, 
unlefs an unavoidabie Neteffity forced them to it ; and 
that if he thought it poffible for us to efcape in the Night, 
we had nothing elfe to do but to attempt it. He anfwer- 
ed, if his Lord gave him fuch Order, he would lofe his 
Life, if he did not perform it. We foon brought his 
Lord to give that Order, though privately, and we im- 
mediately prepared for the puttmg it in Praäice. 

And ftrft, as foon as it began to be dark, we kindled 
a Fire in our little Camp, which we kept burning, and 
prepared fo as to make it burn all Night, that the Tar- 
tan might conclude we were (tili there ; but, as foon as 
it was dark, that is to fay, fo as we could fee the Stars 
(for our Guide would not flir before) having all our 
Horfes and Cameis ready loaden, we followed our new 
Guide, who, I foon found, fteered himfelf by the Pole, 
or North Star, all the Country being level for a long 
Way. 

After we had travelled two Hours very hard, it began 
to be lighter (tili, not that it was quite dark all Night, 
but the Moon began to rife, fo that, in (hört, it was ra- 
ther lighter than we wifhed it to be ; but by fix o'Clock 
next Morning, we were gotten near forty Miles, though 
the Truth is, we almoft fpoüed our Horfes. Here we 
found a RuJJian Village, named Kirmasünßoy, where we 
rcfted, and heard nothing of the Calmuck ^ortari ^"^

Day. About two Moors bcfore Night we fet out again, 
and travelled tili eight the next Morning, though not 
quite fo haltily as before ; and about feven o'Clock we 
pafled a little River, calkd Kirtza, and came to a good 
large Town inhabited by Rußians^ and very populous, 
called Oxornys : There we heard, that feveral Troops or 
Hords of Calmuch had been abroad upon the Defert, but 
that we were now completely out of Danger of them, 
whichwas toour gr^at Satisfattion,yon may be füre. Here 
we were obliged to get fome frelh Horfes, and, having 
need enough of Reit, we ftaid hve Days j and my Part- 
ner and I agreed to give the honett Siberian, who brought 
us thither, the Value of ten Piftoles for his condudting 

US. 

In five Days more we caxne to Veußima, upon the Ri- 
ver Witzogda, which running into the River Dativa, we 
were there very happily near the End of ouv Travels by 
Land, that River being navigabk in feven Days Paf- 
fage to Arcb*ngtl: From hence we came to W 
renßoy, where the River joins, the third of Ju!y ; and 
provided ourfelvt-s with two Luggage- boats, and a Bärge, 
for our Conven-ience? we embarked the feventb, and ar- 
rived all Safe at Archangel the eighteenth, having been 
a Year, five Months, and three Days, on the Journey, 
including our Stay of eight Months and odd Days at 
Tdofjki. 

We were obliged to ftay at this Place fix Weeks for 
the Arrival of the Ships, and xnuft have tarried longer, 
had not a Hamburgber come in above a Month fooner 
thm any of the Engliß? Ships ; when, after fome Confi- 
deration, that the City of Hamburgb might happen to be 
as good a Market for our Goods as London, we all took 
Freight wich hini; and, having put our Goods on board, 
it was moft natural for me to puc my Steward on board 
to take care x>f them ; by which means my young Lord 
had a fumcicnt Opportunity to conceal himfelf, never 
Coming on Shore again, in all the Time we ftaid there; 
and this he did, that he might not be feen in the City, 
where fome of the Mofcotv Merchants would certainly 
have fcen and difcovered him.

arrived iti the Elbe, the- thirteenth of September: Here my 
Partner and I found ä very good Säle for our Goods, as 
well thofe öf China, as the Sables, £ffr. of Siberia; and 
dividing the Produce of our Effecls, my Share amounted 
to 3475 /. 17 s. 3 d. notwithiianding fo many Lößes we 
had fuftained, and Charges we had been at ; only re- 
membring that I had included, in this, about 600 /. 
worth of Diamonds, which 1 had purchafed at Bengal. 

Here the young Lord took bis Leave of us, and went 
up the Elbe, in order to go tö the Court of Vienna, where 
he refolved to feek Protedion, and where he could cor- . 
refpond with thofe of his Father's Friends who were left 
alive. He did not part without all the Teftimonies he 
could give, of Gratitude for the Service I had done him, 
and his Senfe of my Kindnefs to the Prince his Father. 

To conclude, having ftayed near four Months in Harn* 
hurgh, I came from thence, over Land, to the Hague, 
where I embarkcd'in the Packet, and arrived in London f 
the roth of January, 1705, having been gone from 
England ten Years and nine Months. 

And here, refolving to harrafs myfelf no more, I am 
preparing for a longer Journey than all thefe, having 
lived feventy-two Years a Life of infinite Variety, and 
learned fufficiently to know the Value of Retirement, 
and the Bleffing of ending our Days in Peace.
