LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

OF 

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 



I.— ROBINSON'S EARL Y LIFE. 

1. Crusoe's Birth and Family. — I was born in the 
year 1632, in the city of York, of a good family, though not 
of that country, my father being a foreigner of Bremen,^ 
named Kreutznaer, who settled first at Hull. He got a 
good estate by merchandise, and leaving off his trade, lived 
afterwards at York; from whence he had married my 
mother, whose relations were named Robinson, a very 
good family in that country, and after whom I was so called, 
that is to say, Robinson Kreutznaer; but, by the usual 
corruption of words in England, we are now called, nay, we 
call ourselves, and write our name, Crusoe; and so mjf 
companions always called me. 

I had two elder brothers, one of whom was lieutenant- 
colonel to an English regiment of foot in Flanders, formerly 
commanded by the famous Colonel Lockhart, and was 
killed at the battle near Dunkirk against the Spaniards. 
What became of my second brother, I never knew, any 
more than my father and mother did know what was become 
of me. 

2. A Roving Spirit. — Being the third son of the 
family, and not bred to any trade, my head began to be 
filled very early with rambling thoughts. My father, who 
was very aged, had given me a competent share of learning, 



6 ADVENTURES OF 

as far as house education and a country free school 
generally go, and designed me for the law; but I would be 
satisfied with nothing but going to sea ; and my inclination 
to this led me so strongly against the will, nay, the 
commands of my father, and against all the entreaties and 
persuasions of my mother and other friends, that there 
seemed to be something fatal in that propension^ of nature, 
tending directly to the life of misery which was to befall me. 

My father, a wise and grave man, gave me serious and 
excellent counsel against what he foresaw was my design. 
He called me one morning into his chamber, where he was 
confined by the gout, and expostulated very warmly with 
me upon this subject : he asked me what reasons, more 
than a mere wandering inclination, I had for leaving his 
house, and my native country, where I might be well 
introduced, and had a prospect of raising my fortune, by 
application and industry, with a life of ease and pleasure. 

After this he pressed me earnestly, and in the most 
affectionate manner, not to play the young man,^ nor to 
precipitate myself into miseries which nature, and the 
station of life I was bom in, seemed to have provided 
against; that I was under no necessity of seeking my bread; 
that he would do well for me ; and that if I was not very 
easy and happy in the world, it must be my mere fate, or 
fault, that must hinder it ; and, to close all, he told me I 
had my elder brother for an example, to whom he had used 
the same earnest persuasions to keep him from going into 
the Low Country* wars, but could not prevail, his young 
desires prompting him to run into the army, where he was 
killed; and though, he said, he would not cease to pray 
for me, yet he would venture to say to me, that if I did 
take this foolish step, God would not bless me ; and I would 
have leisure, hereafter, to reflect upon having neglected his 
counsel, when there might be none to assist in my recovery. 

I observed, in this last part of his discourse, which was 
truly prophetic, though, I suppose, my father did not know 
it to be so himself ; I say, I observed the tears run down 
his face very plentifully, especially when he spoke of my 
brother who was killed ; and that, when he spoke of my 
having leisure to repent, and none to assist me, he was so 



ROBINSON CRUSOS. 



moved, that he broke off the discourse, and told me his 
heart was so full, he could say no more to me. I was 
sincerely affected with this discourse ; as, indeed, who could 
be otherwise ? and I resolved not to think of going abroad 
any more, but to settle at home, according to my father's 
desire. But alas ! a few days wore it all off, 

3. Crusoe Makes off to Sea. — It was not, however, 
till almost a year after this that I broke loose ; though in 
the meantime I continued obstinately deaf to all proposals 
of settling to business, and frequently expostulating with 
my father and mother about their being so positively 
determined against what they knew my inclinations 
prompted me to. But being one day at Hull, whither I 
went casually, and without any purpose of making an elope- 
ment^ at that time, and one of my companions then going 
to London by sea in his father's ship, and prompting me to 
go with them by the common allurement of seafaring men, 
viz., that it should cost me nothing for my passage, I con 
suited neither father nor mother any more, nor so much as 
sent them word of it ; but left them to hear of it as they 
might, without asking God's blessing, or my father's, without 
any consideration of circumstances or consequences, and in 
an ill hour, God knows. On the ist of September, 1651, 
I went on board a ship bound for London.

II.— FIRST ADVENTURES AT SEA. 

I. First Taste of the Sea. — Never any young 
adventurer's misfortunes, I believe, began younger, or con- 
tinued longer, than mine. The ship had no sooner got out 
of the Humber, than the wind began to blow, and the 
waves to rise, in a most frightful manner ; and as I had 
never been at sea before, I was most ine^tpressibly sick in 
body, and terrified in mind. I began now seriously to 



8 ADVENTURES OF 

reflect upon what I had done, and how justly I was over- 
taken by the judgment of Heaven, for wickedly leaving my 
father's house. All the good counsels of my parents, my 
father's tears, and my mother's entreaties, came now fresh 
into my mind ; and my conscience, which was not yet come 
to the pitch of hardness to which it has been since, 
reproached me with the contempt of advice, and the 
abandonment of my duty. 

All this while the storm increased, and the sea, which I 
had never been upon before, went very high, though nothing 
like what I have seen many times since ; no, nor what I 
saw a few days after ; but, such as it was, enough to affect 
me then, who was but a young sailor, and had never known 
anything of the matter. I expected every wave would have 
swallowed us up, and that every time the ship fell down, as 
I thought, in the trough or hollow of the sea, we should 
never rise more ; and in this agony of mind I made many 
vows and resolutions, that if it would please God to spare 
my life this voyage, if ever I got my foot once on dry land, 
I would go directly home to my father, and never set it 
into a ship again while I lived; that I would take his 
advice, and never run myself into such miseries as these any 
more. 

These wise and sober thoughts continued during the 
storm, and indeed some time after ; but the next day, as 
the wind was abated, and the sea calmer, I began to be a 
little inured to it. However, I was very grave that day, 
being also a little sea-sick still : but towards night the 
weather cleared up, the wind was quite over, and a charming 
fine evening followed ; the sun went down perfectly clear, 
and rose so the next morning; and having little or no wind, 
and a smooth sea, the sun shining upon it, the sight was, 
as I thought, the most delightful that I ever saw. 

2. Crusoe Forgets his Vows. — I had slept well in 

the night, and was now no more seasick, but very cheerful, 
looking with wonder upon the sea that was so rough and 
terrible the day before, and could be so calm and pleasant 
in a little time after. And now, lest my good resolutions 
should continue, my companion, who had indeed enticed 
me away, came to me, and said, Well, Bob, clapping me on 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 9 

the shoulder, how do you do after it ? I warrant you you 
were frightened, wa'n't you, last night, when it blew but a 
capful of wind ? — A capful, do you call it ? said I ; 'twas 
a terrible storm. — A stprm, you fool ! replies he, do you call 
that a storm ? Why, it was nothing at all ; give us but a 
good ship, and sea-room, and we think nothing of such a 
squall of wind as that : you are but a fresh-water sailor, 
Bob ; come, let us make a bowl of punch, and we'll forget 
all that. D'ye see what charming weather 'tis now ? To 
make short this sad part of my story, we went the way of 
all sailors ; the punch was made, and I was made drunk 
with it ; and in that one night's wickedness I drowned all 
my repentance, all my reflections upon my past conduct, 
and all my resolutions for the future. In a word, as the 
sea was returned to its smoothness of surface and settled 
calmness by the abatement of the storm, so the hurry of my 
thoughts being over, my fears and apprehensions of being 
swallowed up by the sea forgotten, and the current of my 
former desires returned, I entirely forgot the vows and 
promises I had made in my distress. 

3. A Storm at Sea. — The sixth day of our being at 
sea we came into Yarmouth Roads :^ the wind having been 
contrary and the weather calm, we had made but little way 
since the storm. Here we were obliged to come to an 
anchor, and here we lay, the wind continuing contrary, viz. 
at south-west, for seven or eight days, during which time a 
great many ships from Newcastle came into the same roads, 
as the common harbour where the ships might wait for a 
wind for the river Thames. 

On the eighth day, in the morning, the wind increased, 
and we had all hands at work to strike our topmasts, and 
make everything snug and close, that the ship might ride 
as easy as possible. By noon the sea went very high indeed, 
and our ship rode forecastle^ in, shipped several seas, and 
we thought, once or twice, our anchor had come home ; 
upon which our master ordered out the sheet anchor; so 
that we rode with two anchors ahead, and the cables 
veered^ out to the better end. By this time it blew a 
terrible storm indeed ; and now I began to see terror and 
amazement in the faces of even the s^amecv >iJci^\XNS»^N^^» 



10 adv£Nti}res of" 

The master was vigilant in the business of preserving the 
ship ; but, as he went in and out of his cabin by me, I 
could hear him softly say to himself several times, Lord, be 
merciful to us ! we shall be all lost ; we shall be all 
undone ! and the like. 

Toward evening, the mate and boatswain begged the 
master of our ship to let them cut away the foremast, which 
he was very loath to do ; but the boatswain protesting to him, 
that if he did not, the ship would founder, he consented ; 
and when they had cut away the foremast, the mainmast 
stood so loose, and shook the ship so much, they were 
obliged to cut it away also, and make a clear deck. Any 
one may judge what a condition I must be in at all this, 
who was but a young sailor, and who had been in such a 
fright before at but a little. 

But the worst was not come yet : the storm continued 
with such fury, that the seamen themselves acknowledged 
they had never known a worse. We had a good ship, but 
she was deep laden, and so wallowed^ in the sea, that the 
seamen every now and then cried out she would founder. 
It was my advantage, in one respect, that I did not know 
what they meant by founder. However, the storm was so 
violent, that I saw what is not often seen, the master, the 
boatswain, and some others, more sensible than the rest, at 
their prayers, and expecting every moment the ship would 
go to the bottom. In the middle of the night, and under 
all the rest of our distresses, one of the men, that had been 
down on purpose to see, cried out, we had sprung a leak ; 
another said there was four feet of water in the hold. 

Then all hands were called to the pump. At that very 
word my heart, as I thought, died within me, and I fell 
backwards upon the side of my bed, where I sat in the 
cabin. However, the men roused me, and told me that I, 
who was able to do nothing before, was as well able to pump 
as another : at which I stirred up and went to the pump, 
and worked very heartily. While this was doing, the 
master seeing some light colliers,^ who, not able to ride out 
the storm, were obliged to slip and run away to sea, and 
would not come near us, ordered us to fire a gun, as a 
signal of distress. I, who knew nothing what that meant, 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. II 

• 

was SO surprised, that I thought the ship had broke, or some 
dreadful thing had happened. In a word, I was so surprised, 
that I fell down in a swoon. As this was a time when 
everybody had his own life to think of, no one minded me, 
or what was become of me : but another man stepped up 
to the pump, and thrusting me aside with his foot, let me 
lie, thinking I had been dead ; and it was a great while 
before I came to myself. 

We worked on ; but the water increasing in the hold, it 
was apparent that the ship would founder ; and although 
the storm began to abate a little, yet as it was not possible 
she could swim^ till we might run into a port, so the master 
continued firing guns for help ; and a light ship, who had 
rid it out just ahead of us, ventured a boat out to help us. 
It was with the utmost hazard the boat came near us, but 
it was impossible for us to get on board, or for the boat to 
lie near the ship's side ; till at last the men rowing very 
heartily, and venturing their lives to save ours, our men 
cast them a rope over the stern with a buoy to it, and then 
veered it out a great length, which they, after great labour 
and hazard, took hold of^ and we hauled them close under 
our stern, and got all into their boat 

It was to no purpose for them or us, after we were in the 
boat, to think of reaching their own ship ; so all agreed to 
let her drive, and only to pull her in towards shore as much 
as we could : and our master promised them, that if the 
boat was staved upon shore, he would make it good to their 
master. We were not much more than a quarter of an hour 
out of our ship when we saw her sink ; and then I under- 
stood, for the first time, what was meant by a ship foun- 
dering in the sea. At last, not without much difficulty, we 
got all safe on shore, and walked afterwards on foot to 
Yarmouth, where, as unfortunate men, we were used with 
great humanity, as well by the magistrates of the town, who 
assigned us good quarters, as by the particular merchants 
and owners of ships, and had money given us sufficient to 
carry us either to London or back to Hull, as we thought fit.

I a ADVENTURES OF 

London. It was my lot, first of all, to fall into pretty good 
company in London ; which does not always happen to such 
loose and misguided young fellows as I then was ; the devil, 
generally, not omitting to lay some snare for them very early. 
But it was not so with me : I first fell acquainted with the 
master of a ship, who had been on the coast of Guinea, and 
who, having had very good success there, was resolved to 
go again. He, taking a fancy to my conversation, which 
was not at all disagreeable at that time, and hearing me say 
I had a mind to see the world, told me, that if I would go 
the voyage with him, I should be at no expense ; I should 
be his messmate and his companion ; and if I could carry 
anything with me, I should have all the advantage of it that 
the trade would admit; and perhaps I might meet with 
some encouragement. I embraced the offer, and, entering 
into a strict friendship with this captain, who was an honest 
and plain-dealing man, I went the voyage with him, and 
carried a small adventure with me; which, by the dis- 
interested honesty of my friend the captain, I increased 
very considerably ; for I carried about forty pounds in such 
toys and trifles as the captain directed me to buy. This 
forty pounds I had mustered together by the assistance of 
some of my relations whom I corresponded with ; and who, 
I believe, got my father, or, at least, my mother, to con- 
tribute so much as that to my first adventure. This was 
the only voyage which I may say was successful in all my 
adventures, and which I owe to the integrity and honesty 
of my friend the captain, under whom also I got a com- 
petent knowledge of mathematics and the rules of navigation, 
learned how to keep an account of the ship's course, take 
an observation,*^ and, in short, to understand some things 
that were needful to be understood by a sailor ; for, as he 
took delight to instruct me, I took delight to learn ; and, in 
a word, this voyage made me both a sailor and a merchant : 
for I brought home five pounds nine ounces of gold dust 
for my adventure, which yielded me in London, at my return, 
almost three hundred pounds, and this filled me with those 
aspiring thoughts which have since so completed my ruin. 
Yet even in this voyage I had my misfortunes too ; par- 
ticularly, that I was continually sick, being thrown into a

III.— ROBINSON'S CAPTIVITY AND ESCAPE. 

I. Attacked by Pirates. — I was now set up for a 

Guinea trader ; and my friend, to my great misfortune, 
dying soon after his arrival, I resolved to go the same 
voyage again ; and I embarked in the same vessel with one 
who was his mate in the former voyage, and had now got 
the command of the ship. This was the unhappiest voy- 
age that ever man made j for though I did not carry quite 
a hundred pounds of my new-gained wealth, so that I had 
two hundred pounds left, and which I lodged with my 
friend's widow, who was very just to me, yet I fell into 
terrible misfortunes in this voyage : and the first was this, 
viz.— our ship, making her course towards the Canary 
Islands, or rather between those islands and the African 
shore, was surprised, in the grey of the morning, by a 
Turkish rover, of Sallee,^ who gave chase to us with all the 
sail she could make. We crowded also as much canvas as 
our yards would spread, or our masts carry, to get clear ; 
but finding the pirate gained upon us, and would certainly 
come up with us in a few hours, we prepared to fight, our 
ship having twelve guns and the rover eighteen. About 
three in the afternoon he came up with us ; and bringing to, 
by mistake, just athwart our quarter,^ instead of athwart our 
stern, as he intended, we brought eight of our guns to bear 
on that side, and poured in a broadside upon him, which 
made him sheer off again, after returning our fire, and 
pouring in also his small shot from near Vno VyMCi.^x^4m<^\:i 



14 ADVENTURES OF 

which he had on board. However, we had not a man 
touched, all our men keeping close. He prepared to attack 
us again, and we to defend ourselves ; but laying us on 
board the next time upon our other quarter, he entered 
sixty men upon our decks, who immediately fell to cutting 
and hacking the sails and rigging. We plied them with 
small shot, half-pikes, powder-chests, and such like, and 
cleared our deck of them twice. However, to cut short 
this melancholy part of our story, our ship being disabled, 
and three of our men killed and eight wounded, we were 
obliged to yield, and were carried all prisoners into Sallee, 
a port belonging to the Moors. 

2. Crusoe as a Slave. — The usage I had there was 
not so dreadful as at first I apprehended : nor was I carried 
up the country to the emperor's court, as the rest of our 
men were, but was kept by the captain of the rover as his 
proper prize,^ and made his slave, being young and nimble, 
and fit for his business. At this surprising change of my cir- 
cumstances, from a merchant to a miserable slave, I was per- 
fectly Overwhelmed ; and now looked back upon my father's 
prophetic discourse to me, that I should be miserable, and 
have none to relieve me; which I thought was now so 
effectually brought to pass, that it could not be worse ; that 
now the hand of Heaven had overtaken me, and I was 
undone, without redemption. But, alas ! this was but a 
taste of the misery I was to go through, as will appear in 
the sequel of this story. 

As my new patron, or master, had taken me home to his 
house, so I was in hopes he would take me with him when 
he went to sea again, believing that it would, some time or 
other, be his fate to be taken by a Spanish or Portuguese 
man-of-war, and that then I should be set at liberty. But 
this hope of mine was soon taken away, for when he went 
to sea .he left me on shore to look after his little garden, and 
do the common drudgery of slaves about his house ; and 
when he came home again from his cruise, he ordered me 
to lie in the cabin, to look after the ship. 

Here I meditated nothing but my escape, and what method 
I might take to effect it, but found no way that had the 
least probability in it. Nothing presented to make the 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 1 5 

supposition of it rational ; for I had nobody to communi- 
cate it to that would embark with me ; no fellow-slave, no 
Englishman, Irishman, or Scotchman there but myself; so 
that for two years, though I often pleased myself with the 
imagination, yet I never had the least encouraging prospect 
of putting it in practice. 

After about two years, an odd circumstance presented 
itself, which put the old thought of making some attempt 
for my liberty again in my head. My patron lying at home 
longer than usual, without fitting out his ship, which, as I 
heard, was for want of money, he used constantly, once or 
twice a week, sometimes oftener, if the weather was fair, to 
take the ship's pinnace, and go out into the road a-fishing ; 
and as he always took me and a young Moresco with him 
to row the boat, we made him very merry, and I proved 
very dexterous in catching fish, insomuch that sometimes 
he would send me with a Moor, one of his kinsmen, and 
the youth, the Moresco, as they called him, to catch a dish 
of fish for him. 

It happened one time, that going a-fishing in a stark* 
calm morning, a fog rose so thick, that though we were not 
half a league from the shore, we lost sight of it ; and row- 
ing, we knew not whither, or which way, we laboured all day, 
and all the next night, and when the morning came, we 
found we had pulled off" to sea, instead of pulling in for 
the shore, and that we were at least two leagues from the 
shore : however, we got well in again, though with a great 
deal of labour, and some danger, for the wind began to 
blow pretty fresh in the morning ; but particularly we were 
all very hungry. 

But our patron, warned by this disaster, resolved to take 
more care of himself for the future ; and having lying by 
him the long-boat of our English ship he had taken, he 
resolved he would not go a-fishing any more without a com- 
pass and some provision ; so he ordered the carpenter of 
the ship, who was an English slave, to build a little state- 
room or cabin in the middle of the long-boat, like that of a 
barge, with a place to stand behind it,* to steer and haul 
home the main sheet, and room before for a hand or two 
to stand and work the sails. She sailed witVv y^Yv^X ^9^^ csi&&<^

a shoulder-of-mutton sail, and the boom^ jibbed^ over the 
top of the cabin, which lay very snug and low, and had in 
it room for him to lie, with a slave or two, and a table to 
eat on, with some small lockers to put in some bottles of 
such liquor as he thought fit to drink, and particularly his 
bread, rice, and coffee. 

We went frequently out with this boat a-fishing, and as I 
was most dexterous to catch fish for him, he never went 
without me. It happened that he had appointed to go out 
in this boat, either for pleasure or for fish, with two or three 
Moors of some distinction in that place, and for whom he 
had provided extraordinarily, and had therefore sent on 
board the boat, overnight, a larger store of provisions than 
ordinary, and had ordered me to get ready three fusees,^ 
with powder and shot, which were on board his ship, for 
that they designed some sport of fowling as well as fishing. 

I got all things ready as he directed, and waited the next 
morning with the boat washed clean, her ensign and pen- 
dants® out, and everything to accommodate his guests : when, 
by-and-by, my patron came on board alone, and told me 
his guests had put off going, upon some business that fell 
out, and ordered me with a man and boy, as usual, to go 
out with the boat, and catch them some fish, for that his 
friends were to sup at his house ; and commanded, that as 
soon as I got some fish, I should bring it home to his 
house : all which I prepared to do. 

3. A Plan of Escape. — This moment my former 
notions of deliverance darted into my thoughts, for now I 
found I was like to have a little ship at my command ; and 
my master being gone, I prepared to furnish myself, not for 
a fishing business, but for a voyage ; though I knew not, 
neither did I so much as consider, whither I should steer ; 
for any where, to get out of that place, was my way. 

My first contrivance was to make a pretence to speak to 
this Moor, to get something for our subsistence on board ; 
for I told him we must not presume to eat of our patron's 
bread : he said, that was true ; so he brought a large basket 
of rusk or biscuit, of their kind, and three jars with fresh . 
water, into the boat. I knew where my patron's case of 
bottles stood, which it was evident, by the oiake, were 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 1 7 

taken out of some English prize, and I conveyed them into 
the boat while the Moor was on shore, as if they had been 
there before for our master. I conveyed also a great lump 
of bees-wax into the boat, which weighed above half a 
hundred-weight, with a parcel of twine or thread, a hatchet, 
a saw, and a hammer, all which were of great use to us 
afterwards, especially the wax, to make candles. Another 
trick I tried upon him, which he innocently came into also : 
his name was Ismael, whom they call Muley, or Moley : 
so I called to him — Moley, said I, our patron's guns are on 
board the boat, can you not get a little powder and shot ? 
it may be we may kill some alcamies (fowls like our curlews) 
for ourselves, for I know he keeps the gunner's stores in the 
ship. — Yes, says he, I will bring some ; and accordingly he 
brought a great leather pouch, which held about a pound 
and a half of powder, or rather more, and another with 
shot, that had five or six pounds, with some bullets, and 
put all into the boat : at the same time I found some 
powder of my master's in the great cabin, with which I 
filled one of the large bottles in the case, which was almost 
empty, pouring what was in it into another; and thus 
furnished with everything needful, we sailed out of the port 
to fish. The castle, which is at the entrance of the port, 
knew who we were, and took no notice of us ; and we were 
not above a mile out of the port, before we hauled in our 
sail, and set us down to fish. The wind blew from N.N.E., 
which was contrary to my desire; for, had it blown 
southerly, I had been sure to have made the coast of Spain, 
and at last reached to the bay of Cadiz ; but my resolutions 
were, blow which way it would, I would be gone from the 
horrid place where I was, and leave the rest to fate. 

After we had fished some time and catched^ nothing, for 
when I had fish on my hook I would not pull them up, that 
he might not see them, I said to the Moor, This will not do; 
our master will not be thus served ; we must stand farther 
off. He, thinking no harm, agreed ; and being at the head 
of the boat, set the sails ; and as I had the helm, I run the 
boat near a league farther, and then brought to, as if I 
would fish. Then giving the boy the helm, I stepped for- 
ward to where the Moor was, and I took Vv\m \>^ ^MX'^m^^

with my arm under his waist, and tossed him clear over- 
board into the sea. He rose immediately, for he swam 
like a cork, and called to me, begged to be taken in, and 
told me he would go all the world over with me. He swam 
so strong after the boat, that he would have reached me 
very quickly, there being but little wind ; upon which I 
stepped into the cabin, and fetching one of the fowling- 
pieces, I presented it at him, and told him, I had done him 
no hurt, and if he would be quiet, I would do him none. 
But, said I, you swim well enough to reach the shore, and 
the sea is calm ; make the best of your way to shore, and 
I will do you no harm : but if you come near the boat, I 
will shoot you through the head ; for I am resolved to have 
my liberty. So he turned himself about, and swam for the 
shore ; and I make no doubt but he reached it with ease, 
for he was an excellent swimmer. 

4. Crusoe Makes his Escape. — When he was gone 
I turned to the boy, whom they called Xury, and said to 
him, Xury, if you will be faithful to me I will make you a 
great man ; but if you will not stroke your face to be true 
to me (that is, swear by Mahomet and his father's beard), 
I must throw you into the sea too. The boy smiled in my 
face, and spoke so innocently, that I could not mistrust 
him ; and swore to be faithful to me, and go all over the 
world with me. 

While I was in view of the Moor that was swimming, I 
stood out directly to sea with the boat, that they might 
think me gone towards the Strait's mouth. But as soon as 
it grew dusk in the evening, I changed my course, and 
steered directly south and by east, bending my course a 
little towards the east, that I might keep in with the shore ; 
and having a fair fresh gale of wind, and a smooth quiet sea, 
I made such sail, that I believe by the next day, at three 
o'clock in the afternoon, when I made the land, I could 
not be less than one hundred and fifty miles south of Sallee, 
quite beyond the Emperor of Morocco's dominions, or 
indeed of any other king thereabout ; for we saw no people. 

Yet such was the fright I had taken at the Moors, and 
the dreadful apprehensions I had of falling into their hands, 
that I would not stop, or go on shore, or come to an anchor, 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 1 9 

the wind continuing fair, till I had sailed in that manner 
five days ; and then the wind shifting to the southward, I 
concluded also that if any of our vessels were in chase of 
me, they also would now give over ; so I ventured to make 
to the coast, and came to an anchor in the mouth of a little 
river, and got a supply of fresh water. 

After this stop we made on to the southward continually, 
for ten or twelve days, living very sparingly on our pro- 
visions, which began to abate very much, and going no 
oftener into the shore than we were obliged to for fresh water. 
My design in this was to make the river Gambia, or 
Senegal : that is to say, anywhere about the Cape de Verd, 
where I was in hopes to meet with some European ship ; 
and if I did not, I knew not what course I had to take, but 
to seek for the islands ^^ or perish among the Negroes. I 
knew that all the ships from Europe, which sailed either to 
the coast of Guinea, or to Brazil, or to the East Indies, 
made this Cape, or those islands : and in a word I put the 
whole of my fortune upon this single point, either that I 
must meet with some ship, or must perish. 

I made forward till I saw the land run out a great length 
into the sea, at about the distance of four or five leagues 
before me ; and the sea being very calm, I kept a large 
offing, to make this point. At length, doubling the point, 
at about two leagues from the land, I saw plainly land on 
the other side, to seaward : then I concluded, as it was 
most certain indeed, that this was the Cape de Verd, and 
those the islands, called, from thence, Cape de Verd 
Islands. However, they were at a great distance, and I 
could not well tell what I had best to do ; for if I should 
be taken with a gale of wind, I might neither reach one nor 
the other. 

5- A Sail in Sight. — In this dilemma, as I was very 
pensive, I stepped into the cabin, and sat me down, Xury 
having the helm ; when, on a sudden, the boy cried out. 
Master, master, a ship with a sail ! and the foolish boy was 
frightened out of his wits, thinking it must needs be some 
of his master's ships sent to pursue us, when I knew we 
were gotten far enough out of their reach. I Jumped o\it 
of the cabin, and immediately saw, not odl\^ Wm^ ^v^^\i^\.

what she was, viz. that it was a Portuguese ship, and, as I 
thought, was bound to the Coast of Guinea, for negroes. 
But, when I observed the course she steered, I was soon 
convinced they were bound some other way, and did not 
design to come any nearer to the shore; upon which, I 
stretched out to sea as much as I could, resolving to speak 
with them, if possible. 

With all the sail I could make, I found I should not be 
able to come in their way, but that they would be gone by 
before I could make any signal to them ; but after I had 
crowded to the utmost, and began to despair, they, it seems, 
saw me, by the help of their perspective" glasses, and that it 
was some European boat, which, they supposed, must 
belong to some ship that was lost : so they shortened sail, 
to let me come up. I was encouraged with this, and as I 
had my patron's ensign on board, I made a waft of it to 
them, for a signal of distress, and fired a gun, both which 
they saw ; for they told me they saw the smoke, though 
they did not hear the gun. Upon these signals, they very 
kindly brought to, and lay by for me ; and in about three 
hours' time I came up with them. 

They asked me what I was, in Portuguese, and in 
Spanish, and in French, but I understood none of them ; 
but, at last, a Scotch sailor who was on board, called to me, 
and I answered him, and told him I was an Englishman, 
that I had made my escape out of slavery from the Moors, 
at Sallee: they then bade me come on board, and very 
kindly took me in, and all my goods. 

It was an inexpressible joy to me, which anyone will 
believe, that I was thus delivered, as I esteemed it, from 
such a miserable, and almost hopeless, condition as I was 
in ; and I immediately offered all I had to the captain of 
the ship, as a return for my deliverance ; but he generously 
told me, he would take nothing from me, but that all I had 
should be delivered safe to me, when I came to the Brazils. 
For, says he, I have saved your life on no other terms than 
I would be glad to be saved myself; and it may, one time 
or other, be my lot to be taken up in the same condition. 
Besides, said he, when I carry you to the Brazils, so great 
a way from your own country, if I should take from you

what you have, you will be starved there, and then I only 
take away that life I had given. No, no, Senhor Ingles 
(Mr. Englishman), says he, I will carry you thither in 
charity, and these things will help to buy your subsistence 
there, and your passage home again. 

As he was charitable in this proposal, so he was just in 
the performance, to a tittle : for he ordered the seamen, 
that none should offer to touch anything I had : then he 
took everything into his own possession, and gave me back 
an exact inventory of them, that I might have them, even 
so much as my three earthen jars.

lY.—JIOn^ ROBINSOJSl CAME TO GRIEF. 
I. Crusoe Becomes a Planter. — We had a very 

good voyage to the Brazils, and arrived in the Bay de 
Todos los Santos, or All Saints* Bay, in about twenty-two 
days after. And now I was once more delivered from the 
most miserable of all conditions of life ; and what to do next 
with myself, I was now to consider. 

The generous treatment the captain gave me, I can never 
enough remember : he would take nothing of me for my 
passage, and caused everything I had in the ship to be 
punctually delivered to me ; and what I was willing to sell 
he bought of me ; such as the case of bottles, two of my 
guns, and a piece of the lump of bees-wax, — for I had made 
candles of the rest : in a word, I made about two hundred 
and twenty pieces of eight of all my cargo ; and with this 
stock, I went on shore in the Brazils. 

I had not been long here, before I was recommended to 
the house of a good honest man, like himself, who had an 
*' ingenio " as they call it (that is, a plantation and a sugar- 



ii AbVEiinrRES oIf 

house). I lived with him some time, and acquainted 

myself, by that means, with the manner of planting and of 

making sugar ; and seeing how well the planters lived, and 

how they got rich suddenly, I resolved, if I could get a 

licence to settle there, I would turn planter among them : 

endeavouring, in the meantime, to find out some way to get 

my money, which I had left in London, remitted to me. 

To this purpose, getting a kind of letter of naturalisation,^ I 

purchased as much land that was uncured as my money 

would reach, and formed a plan for my plantation and 

settlement. 

*♦*♦♦♦ 

You may suppose, that after living almost four years in 
the Brazils, and beginning to thrive and prosper very well 
upon my plantation, I had not only learned the language, 
but had contracted an acquaintance and friendship among 
my fellow-planters, as well as among the merchants at St Sal- 
vador, which was our port : and that, in my discourses among 
them, I had frequently given them an account of my two 
voyages to the coast of Guinea, the manner of trading with 
the Negroes there, and how easy it was to purchase on the 
coast for trifles — such as beads, toys, knives, scissors, 
hatchets, bits of glass, and the like — not only gold-dust, 
Guinea grains, elephants' teeth, &c., but Negroes, for the 
service of the Brazils, in great numbers. 

They listened always very attentively to my discourses on 
these heads, but especially to that part which related to the 
buying Negroes; which was a trade, at that time, not only 
not far entered into, but, as far as it was, had been carried 
on by the assiento^ or permission of the kings of Spain and 
Portugal, and engrossed^ from the public ; so that few 
Negroes were bought, and those excessively dear. 

It happened, being in company with some merchants and 
planters of my acquaintance, and talking of those things 
very earnestly, three of them came to me the next morning, 
and told me they had been musing very much upon what 
I had discoursed with them of the last night, and they came 
to make a secret proposal to me : and, after enjoining me 
to secrecy, they told me that they had a mind to fit out a 
ship to go to Guinea ; that they had all plantations as well 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 23 

as I, and were straitened for nothing so much as servants ; 
that as it was a trade that could not be carried on, because 
they could not publicly sell the Negroes when they came 
home, so they desired to make but one voyage, to bring 
the Negroes on shore privately, and divide them among 
their own plantations ; and, in a word, the question was, 
whether I would go their supercargo^ in the ship, to manage 
the trading part upon the coast of Guinea; and they 
offered me that I should have an equal share of the Negroes, 
without providing any part of the stocL 

2. Afloat Again. — This seemed a fair proposal, and I 
accepted it Accordingly, the ship being fitted out, and 
the cargo furnished, and all things done as by agreement 
by my partners in the voyage, I went on board in an evil 
hour again, the first of September, 1659, being the same day 
eight years that I went from my parents at Hull, in order 
to act the rebel to their authority, and the fool to my own 
interest. 

Our ship was about one hundred and twenty tons burden, 
carried six guns and fourteen men, besides the master, his 
boy, and myself; we had on board no large cargo of goods, 
except of such toys as were fit for our trade with the 
Negroes, such as beads, bits of glass, shells, and odd trifles, 
especially little looking-glasses, knives, scissors, hatchets, 
and the like. 

The very same day I went on board we set sail, standing 
away to the northward upon our own coast,* with design to 
stretch over for the African coast, when they came about 
ten or twelve degrees of northern latitude ; which, it seems, 
was the manner of their course in those days. We had very 
good weather, only excessively hot all the way upon our 
own coast, till we came the height of Cape St. Augustino ; 
from whence, keeping farther off at sea, we lost sight of land, 
and steered as if we were bound for the isle Fernando de 
Noronha, holding our course N.E. by N. and leaving those 
isles on the east. In this course we passed the Line in 
about twelve days' time, and were, by our last observation, 
in seven degrees twenty-two minutes northern latitude, when 
a violent tornado, or hurricane, took us quite out of our 
knowledge : it began from the south-east, came about to 



24 ADVENTURES OF 

the north-west, and then settled in the north-east; from 
whence it blew in such a terrible manner, that for twelve 
days together we could do nothing but drive, and, scudding 
away before it, let it carry us whithersoever fate and the fury 
of the winds directed ; and, during these twelve days, I need 
not say that I expected every day to be swallowed up ; nor, 
indeed, did any in the ship expect to save their lives. 

In this distress, we had, besides the terror of the storm, 
one of our men die of the calenture, and one man and a 
boy washed overboard. About the twelfth day, the weather 
abating a little, the master made an observation as well as 
he could, and found that he was in about eleven degrees 
north latitude, but that he was twenty-two degrees of longi- 
tude difference, west from Cape St. Augustino ; so that he 
found he was got upon the coast of Guiana, or the north 
part of Brazil, beyond the river Amazon, toward that of the 
river Orinoco, commonly called the Great River ; and began 
to consult with me what course he should take, for the ship 
was leaky and very much disabled, and he was for going 
directly back to the coast of Brazil. 

I was positively against that ; and looking over the charts 
of the sea-coast of America with him, we concluded there 
was no inhabited country for us to have recourse to, till we 
came within the circle of the Caribbee islands, and therefore 
resolved to stand away for Barbadoes ; which, by keeping 
off to sea, to avoid the indraught^ of the bay or gulf of 
Mexico, we might easily perform, as we hoped, in about 
fifteen days' sail ; whereas we could not possibly make our 
voyage to the coast of Africa without some assistance, both 
to our ship and ourselves. 

With this design, we changed our course, and steered 
away N.W. by W. in order to reach some of our English 
islands, where I hoped for relief. But our voyage was other- 
wise determined ; for being in the latitude of twelve degrees 
eighteen minutes, a second storm came upon us, which 
carried us away with the same impetuosity westward, and 
drove us so out of the very way of all human commerce, 
that had all our lives been saved, as to the sea, we were 
rather in danger of being devoured by savages than ever 
returning to our own country. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 25 

3. Agjound ! — In this distress, the wind still blowing very 
hard, one of our men early in the morning, cried out, Land I 
and we had no sooner run out of the cabin to look out, in 
hopes of seeing whereabouts in the world we were, than the 
ship struck upon a sand, and in a moment, her motion 
being so stopped, the sea broke over her in such a manner, 
that we expected we should all have perished immediately ; 
and we were immediately driven into our close quarters, to 
shelter us from the very foam and spray of the sea. 

It is not easy for any one who has not been in the like 
condition to describe or conceive the consternation of men 
in such circumstances : we knew nothing where we were, 
or upon what land it was we were driven, whether an island 
or the main, whether inhabited or not inhabited ; and as 
the rage of the wind was still great, though rather less than 
at first, we could not so much as hope to have the ship 
hold many minutes without breaking in pieces, unless the 
wind, by a kind of miracle, should immediately turn about. 
In a word, we sat looking upon one another, and expecting 
death every moment, and every man acting accordingly, as 
preparing for another world ; for there was little or nothing 
more for us to do in this : that which was our present 
comfort, and all the comfort we had, was, that, contrary to 
our expectation, the ship did not break yet, and that the 
master said the wind began to abate. 

Now, though we thought that the wind did a little abate, 
yet the ship having thus struck upon the sand, and sticking 
too fast for us to expect her getting off, we were in a 
dreadful condition indeed, and had nothing to do, but to 
think of saving our lives as well as we could. We had a boat 
at our stern just before the storm, but she was first staved 
by dashing against the ship's rudder, and, in the next place, 
she broke away, and either sunk, or was driven off to sea ; 
so there was no hope from her. We had another boat on 
board, but how to get her off into the sea was a doubtful 
thing ; however, there was no room to debate, for we fancied 
the ship would break in pieces every minute, and some told 
us she was actually broken already. 

In this distress, the mate cjf our vessel laid hold of the 
boat, and with the help of the rest of the men, they got her 



26 ADVENTURES OF 

flung over the ship's side ; and getting all into her, we let 
her go, and committed ourselves, being eleven in number, 
to God's mercy, and the wild sea : for though the storm 
was abated considerably, yet the sea went dreadfully high 
upon the shore, and might be well called den wild zee, as 
the Dutch call the sea in a storm. 

And now our case was very dismal indeed ; for we all saw 
plainly, that the sea went so high, that the boat could not 
live, and that we should be inevitably drowned. As to 
making sail, we had none j nor, if we had, could we have 
done anything with it \ so we worked at the oar towards the 
land, though with heavy hearts, like men going to execution ; 
for we all knew that when the boat came nearer to the 
shore, she would be dashed into a thousand pieces by the 
breach of the sea. However, we committed our souls to 
God in the most earnest manner; and the wind driving us 
towards the shore, we hastened our destruction with our 
own hands, pulling as well as we could towards land. 

What the shore was — whether rock or sand, whether 
steep or shoal — we knew not ; the only hope that could 
rationally give us the least shadow of expectation, was, if 
we might happen into some bay or gulf, or the mouth of 
some river, where by great chance we might have run our 
boat in, or got under the lee® of the land, and perhaps made 
smooth water. But nothing of this appeared ; and as we 
made nearer and nearer the shore, the land looked more 
frightful than the sea. 

4. A Struggle for Life. — After we had rowed, or 
rather driven, about a league and a half, as we reckoned it, 
a raging wave, mountain-like, came rolling astern of us, and 
plainly bade us expect the coup de grace? In a word, it 
took us with such fury, that it overset the boat at once j 
and separating us, as well from the boat as from one another, 
gave us not time hardly to say, *' O God ! " for we were all 
swallowed up in a moment 

Nothing can describe the confusion of thought which I 
felt when I sunk into the water ; for though I swam very 
well, yet I could not deliver myself from the waves so as to 
draw my breath, till that wave^ having driven me, or rather 
carried me, a vast way on towards the shore, and having 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. ^7 

spent itself, went back, and left me upon the land almost 
dry, but half dead with the water I took in. I had so much 
presence of mind, as well as breath left, that seeing myself 
nearer the main land than I expected, I got upon my feet, 
and endeavoured to make on towards the land as fast as I 
could, before another wave should return and take me up 
again ; but I soon found it was impossible to avoid it ; for 
I saw the sea come after me as high as a great hill, and as 
furious as an enemy which I had no means or strength to 
contend with. My business was to hold my breath, and 
raise myself upon the water, if I could; and so, by 
swimming, to preserve my breathing, and pilot myself 
towards the shore, if possible ; my greatest concern now 
being, that the wave, as it would carry me a great way 
towards the shore when it came on, might not carry me 
back again with it when it gave back towards the sea. 

The wave that came upon me again buried me at once 
twenty or thirty feet deep in its own body ; and I could feel 
myself carried with a mighty force and swiftness towards the 
shore, a very great way ; but I held my breath, and assisted 
myself to swim still forward with all my might. I was 
ready to burst with holding my breath, when, as I felt 
myself rising up, so, to my immediate relief, I found my 
head and hands shoot out above the surface of the water ; 
and though it was not two seconds of time that I could keep 
myself so, yet it relieved me greatly, gave me breath and 
new courage. I was covered again with water a good while, 
but not so long but I held it out ; and finding the water 
had spent itself, and began to return, I struck forward 
against the return of the waves, and felt ground again with 
my feet. I stood still a few moments, to recover breath, 
and till the water went from me, and then took to my heels, 
and ran with what strength I had farther towards the shore. 
But neither would this deliver me from the fury of the sea, 
which came pouring in after me again ; and twice more I 
was lifted up by the waves and carried forwards as before, 
the shore being very flat. 

The last time of these two had well nigh been fatal to 
me ; for the sea, having hurried me along, as before, landed 
me, or rather dashed me, against a piece of a rock, and that 



28 



ADVENTURES OF 



with such force, that it left me senseless, and indeed help- 
less, as to my own deliverance ; for the blow, taking my 
side and breast, beat the breath, as it were, quite out of my 
body ; and had it returned again immediately, I must have 
been strangled in the water : but I recovered a little before 
the return of the waves, and, seeing I should again be 
covered with the water, I resolved to hold fast by a piece 
of the rock, and so to hold my breath, if possible, till the 
wave went back. Now as the waves were not so high as 
the first, being nearer land, I held my hold till the wave 
abated, and then fetched another run, which brought me so 
near the shore, that the next wave, though it went over me, 
yet did not so swallow me up as to carry me away; and the 
next run I took, I got to the main land, where, to my 
great comfort, I clambered up the cliffs of the shore, and 
sat me down upon the grass, free from danger, and quite 
out of the reach of the water.

N.— ROBINSON FINDS HIMSELF ON A 
DESOLATE ISLAND. 



I. Safe on Shore. — I was now landed, and safe on 
shore ; and began to look up and thank God that my life 
was saved, in a case wherein there was, some minutes 
before, scarcely any room to hope. 1 believe it is im- 
possible to express, to the life, what the ecstasies and 
transports of the soul are, when it is so saved, as I may say, 
out of the grave ; and I do not wonder now at the custom, 
viz., that when a malefactor, who has the halter about his 
neck, is tied up, and just going to be turned off, and has a 
reprieve brought to him — I say, I do not wonder that they 
bring a surgeon with it, to let blood that very moment 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 29 

they tell him of it, that the surprise may not drive the 
animal spirits from the heart, and overwhelm him. 

For sudden joys, like griefs, confound at first. 

I walked about on the shore, lifting up my hands, and 
my whole being, as I may say, wrapped up in the con- 
templation of my deliverance ; making a thousand gestures 
and motions, which I cannot describe ; reflecting upon my 
comrades that were drowned, and that there should not be 
one soul saved but myself ; for, as for them, I never saw 
them afterwards, or any sign of them, except three of their 
hats, one cap, and two shoes that were not fellows. 

I cast my eyes to the stranded vessel — when the breach 
and froth of the sea being so big I could hardly see it, it lay 
so far off — and considered, how was it possible I could 
get on shore? 

After I had solaced my mind with the comfortable part 
of my condition, I began to look around me, to see what 
kind of a place I was in, and what was next to be done ; 
and I soon found my comforts abate, and that, in a word, 
I had a dreadful deliverance : for I was wet, had no clothes 
to shift me, nor anything either to eat or drink, to comfort 
me ; neither did I see any prospect before me, but that of 
perishing with hunger, or being devoured by wild beasts. 
And that which was particularly afflicting to me was, that I 
had no weapon either to hunt and kill any creature for my 
sustenance, or to defend myself against any other creature 
that might desire to kill me for theirs. In a word, I had 
nothing about me but a knife, a tobacco-pipe, and a little 
tobacco in a box. This was all my provision ; and this 
threw me into such terrible agonies of mind, that, for a 
while, I ran about like a madman. Night coming upon 
me, I began, with a heavy heart, to consider what would be 
my lot if there were any ravenous beasts in that country, 
seeing at night they always come abroad for their prey. 

2. First Night on the Island. — All the remedy 
that offered to my thoughts, at that time, was, to get up 
into a thick bushy tree, like a fir, but thorny — which grew 
near me, and where I resolved to sit all night— and con- 
sider the next day what death I should die, for as yet I saw 



30 ADVENTURES OF 

no prospect of life. I walked about a furlong from the 
shore, to see if I could find any fresh water to drink, which 
I did, to my great joy ; and having drunk, and put a little 
tobacco into my mouth to prevent hunger, I went to the 
tree, and getting up into it, endeavoured to place myself so 
as that, if I should fall asleep, I might not fall ; and having 
cut me a short stick, like a truncheon, for my defence, I 
took up my lodging; and having been excessively fatigued, 
I fell fast asleep, and slept as comfortably as, I believe, few 
could have done in my condition ; and found myself the 
most refreshed with it that I think I ever was on such an 
occasion. 

When I waked it was broad day, the weather clear, and 
the storm abated, so that the sea did not rage and swell as 
before; but that which surprised me most was, that the 
ship was lifted off in the night from the sand where she lay^ 
by the swelling of the tide, and was driven up almost as far 
as the rock which I at first menfioned, where I had been so 
bruised by the wave dashing me against it. This being 
within about a mile from the shore where I was, and the 
ship seeming to stand upright still, I wished myself on 
board, that at least I might save some necessary things for 
my use. 

When I came down from my apartment in the tree, I 
looked about me again, and the first thing I found was the 
boat ; which lay, as the wind and the s^a had tossed her 
up, upon the land, about two miles on my right hand. I 
walked as far as I could upon the shore to have got to her ; 
but found a neck, or inlet, of water, between me and the 
boat, which was about half a mile broad ; so I came back 
for the present, being more intent upon getting at the ship, 
where I hoped to find something for my present subsistence. 

3. First Visit to the Ship.— A little after noon, I 
found the sea very calm, and the tide ebbed so far out, that 
I could come within a quarter of a mile of the ship. And 
here I found a fresh renewing of my grief; for I saw 
evidently, that if we had kept on board, we had been all 
safe ; that is to say, we had all got safe on shore, and I 
had not been so miserable as to be left entirely destitute of 
all comfort and company, as I now was. This forced tears 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 3 1 

from my eyes again ; but as there was little relief in that, I 
resolved, if possible, to get to the ship : so I pulled off my 
clothes, for the weather was hot to extremity, and took the 
water. But when I came to the ship, my difficulty was still 
greater to know how to get on board ; for as she lay 
aground, and high out of the water, there was nothing 
within my reach to lay hold of. I swam round her twice, 
and the second time I spied a small piece of rope, which I 
wondered I did not see at first, hang down by the fore, 
chains so low, as that with great difficulty I got hold of it 
and by the help of that rope got into the forecastle of the 
ship. Here I found that the ship was bulged, and had a 
great deal of water in her hold ; but that she lay so on the 
side of a bank of hard sand, or rather earth, that her stern 
lay lifted up upon the bank, and her head low, almost to 
the water. By this means all her quarter was free, and all 
that was in that part was dry ; for you may be sure my first 
work was to search and to see what was spoiled and what 
was free : and, first, I found that all the ship's provisions 
were dry and untouched by the water ; and, being very well 
disposed to eat, I went to the bread-room, and filled my 
pockets with biscuit, and ate it as I went about other 
things, for I had no time to lose. I also found some rum 
in the great cabin, of which I took a large dram, and which 
I had indeed need enough of, to spirit me for what was 
before me. Now I wanted nothing but a boat, to furnish 
myself with many things which I foresaw would be very 
necessary to me. 

It was in vain to sit still and wish for what was not to be 
had, and this extremity roused my application. We had 
several spare yards, and two or three large spars of wood, 
and a spare topmast or two in the ship. I resolved to fall 
to work with these, and flung as many overboard as I could 
manage for their weight, tying every one with a rope, that 
they might not drive away. When this was done, I went 
down the ship's side, and puUing them to me, I tied four 
of them fast together at both ends, as well as I could, in 
the form of a raft, and laying two or three short pieces of 
plank upon them crossways, I found I could walk upon it 
very well, but that it was not able to bear any great weight, 



32 ADVENTURES OF 

the pieces being too light : so I went to work, and with the 
carpenter's saw I cut a spare topmast into three lengths, and 
added them to my raft, with a great deal of labour and 
pains. But the hope of furnishing myself with necessaries 
encouraged me to go beyond what I should have been able 
to have done upon another occasion. 

4. The First Cargo. — My raft was now strong enough 
to bear any reasonable weight. My next care was what to 
load it with, and how to preserve what I laid upon it from 
the surf of the sea ; but I was not long considering this. I 
first laid all the planks or boards upon it that I could get, 
and having considered well what I most wanted, I got three 
of the seamen's chests, which I had broken open and 
emptied, and lowered them down upon my raft ; these I 
filled with provisions, viz., bread, rice, three Dutch cheeses, 
five pieces of dried goats' flesh (which we lived much upon), 
and a little remainder of European corn, which had been 
laid by for some fowls which we had brought to sea with us, 
but the fowls were killed. There had been some barley and 
wheat together, but, to my great disappointment, I found 
afterwards that the rats had eaten or spoiled it all. As for 
liquors, I found several cases of bottles belonging to our 
skipper, in which were some cordial waters ; and, in all, 
about five or six gallons of rack. These I stowed by them- 
selves, there being no need to put them into the chests, nor 
any room for them. While I was doing this, I found the 
tide began to flow, though very calm ; and I had the 
mortification to see my coat, shirt, and waistcoat, which I 
had left on shore, upon the sand, swim away ; as for my 
breeches, which were only linen, and open-kneed, I swam 
on board in them, and my stockings. However, this put me 
upon rummaging for clothes, of which I found enough, but 
took no more than I wanted for present use, for I had other 
things which my eye was more upon ; as, first, tools to work 
with on shore. It was only after long searching that I found 
the carpenter's chest, which was indeed a very useful prize 
to me, and much more valuable than a ship-lading of gold 
would have been at that time. I got it down to my raft, 
even whole as it was, without losing time to look into it, for 
I knew in general what it contained.

ROBINSON CRUSOE, 33 

My next care was for some ammunition and arms. 
There were two very good fowling-pieces in the great cabin, 
and two pistols ; these I secured first, with some powder- 
horns and a small bag of shot, and two old rusty swords. 
I knew there were three barrels of powder in the ship, but 
knew not where our gunner had stowed them ; but with 
much search I found them, two of them dry and good, the 
third had taken water. Those two I got to my raft, with 
the arms. And now I thought myself pretty well freighted, 
and began to think how I should get to shore with them, 
having neither sail, oar, nor rudder; and the least capful of 
wind would have overset all my navigation. 

5. Making for Shore. — I had three encouragements: 
I St, a smooth, calm sea; 2ndly, the tide rising, and setting 
in to the shore ; 3rdly, what little wind there was blew me 
towards the land. And thus, having found two or three 
broken oars belonging to the boat, and besides the tools 
which were in the chest, I found two saws, an axe, and ■ a 
hammer ; and with this cargo I put to sea. For a mile, or 
thereabouts, my raft went very well, only that I found it 
drive a little distant from the place where I had landed be- 
fore; by which I perceived that there was some indraught of 
the water, and consequently I hoped to find some creek or 
river there, which I might make use of as a port to get to 
land with my cargo. 

As I imagined, so it was : there appeared before me a 
little opening of the land, and I found a strong current of 
the tide set into it ; so I guided my raft, as well as I could, 
to get into the middle of the stream. But here I had like 
to have suffered a second shipwreck, which, if I had, I 
think it verily would have broken my heart ; for, knowing 
nothing of the coast, my raft ran aground at one end of it 
upon a shoal, and, not being aground at the other end, it 
wanted but a little that all my cargo had slipped off towards 
that end that was afloat, and so fallen into the water. I did 
my utmost, by setting my back against the chests, to keep 
them in their places, but could not thrust off the raft with 
all my strength ; neither durst I stir from the posture I was 
in, but holding up the chests with all my might, I stood in 
that manner near half an hour, in which time the rising of 

c 



34 ADVENTURES OF 

the water brought me a little more upon a level ; and a little 
after, the water still rising, my raft floated again, and I thrust 
her off with the oar I had into the channel, and driving up 
higher, I at length found myself in the mouth of a little 
river, with land on both sides, and a strong current or tide 
running up. I looked on both sides for a proper place to get 
to shore, for I was not willing to be driven too high up the 
river, hoping, in time, to see some ship at sea, and there- 
fore resolved to place myself as near the coast as I could. 

At length I spied a little cove on the right shore of the 
creek, to which, with great pain and difficulty, I guided my 
raft, and at last got so near, as that, reaching ground with 
my oar, I could thrust her directly in. But here I had like 
to have dipped all my cargo into the sea again ; for that 
shore lying pretty steep, that is to say, sloping, there was no 
place to land, but where one end of my float, if it ran on 
shore, would lie so high, and the other sink lower, as before, 
that it would endanger my cargo again. All that I could 
do was to wait till the tide was at the highest, keeping the 
raft with my oar like an anchor, to hold the side of it fast 
to the shore, near a flat piece of ground, which I ex- 
pected the water would flow over ; and so it did. As soon 
as I found water enough, for my raft drew about a foot of 
water, I thrust her upon that flat piece of ground, and there 
fastened or moored her, by sticking my two broken oars into 
the ground, one on one side, near one end, and one on the 
other side, near the other end; and thus I lay till the 
water ebbed away, and left my raft and all my cargo safe on 
shore. 



Yl,— ROBINSON GATHERS HIS ROSSESSIONS 

ROUND HIM. 

I. A Tour of Discovery. — My next work was to view 
the country, and seek a proper place for my habitation, and 
where to stow my goods to secure them from whatever 
might happen. Where I was I yet knew not ; whether on 
the continent, or on an island ; whether inhabited, or not 
inhabited ; whether in danger of wild beasts, or not. There 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 35 

was a hill, not above a mile from me, which rose up very 
steep and high, and which seemed to overtop some other 
hills, which lay as in a ridge from it, northward. I took ou 
one of the fowling-pieces, and one of the pistols, and a 
horn of powder ; and thus armed, I travelled for discovery 
up to the top of that hill ; where, after I had, with great 
labour and difficulty, got up to the top, I saw my fate, to 
my great affliction — viz. that I was in an island, environed 
every way with the sea, no land to be seen^ except some 
rocks, which lay a great way off, and two small islands, less 
than this, which lay about three leagues to the west. 

I found also that the island I was in was barren, and, as 
I saw good reason to believe, uninhabited, except by wild 
beasts, of whom, however, I saw none ; yet I saw abundance 
of fowls, but knew not their kinds ; neither, when I killed 
them, could I tell what was fit for food, and what not At 
my coming back, I shot a great bird, which I saw sitting 
upon a tree, on the side of a great wood. I believe it was 
the first gun that had been fired there since the creation of 
the world : I had no sooner fired, but from all parts of the 
wood there arose an innumerable number of fowls, of many 
sorts, making a confused screaming, and crying, every one 
according to his usual note ; but not one of them of any 
kind that I knew. As for the creature I killed, I took it to 
be a kind of a hawk, its colour and beak resembling it, but 
it had no talons or claws more than common. Its flesh was 
carrion and fit for nothing. 

Contented with this discovery, I came back to my raft, 
and fell to work to bring my cargo on shore, which took me 
up the rest of that day : what to do with myself at night I 
knew not, nor indeed where to rest : for I was afraid to lie 
down on the ground, not knowing but some wild beast might 
devour me, though, as I afterwards found, there was really 
no need for those fears. However, as well as I could, I 
barricaded myself round with the chests and boards that I 
•had brought on shore, and made a kind of hut for that 
night's lodging. As for food, I yet saw not which way to 
supply myself, except that I had seen two or three creatures, 
like hares, run out of the wood where I shot the fowl. 

I now began to consider that I might yet get a great 



36 ADVENTURES OF 

many things out of the ship, which would be useful to me, 
and particularly some of the rigging and sails, and such 
other things as might come to land ; and I resolved to make 
another voyage on board the vessel, if possible. And as I 
knew that the first storm that blew must necessarily break 
her all in pieces, I resolved to set all other things apart, till 
I got everything out of the ship that I could get. Then I 
called a council, that is to say, in my thoughts, whether I 
should take back the raft ; but this appeared impracticable. 
So I resolved to go as before, when the tide was down ; and 
I did so, only that I stripped before I went from my hut ; 
having nothing on but a chequered shirt, a pair of linen 
drawers, and a pair of pumps on my feet. 

2. Second Visit to the Ship. — I got on board the 
ship as before, and prepared a second raft ; and having had 
experience of the first, I neither made this so unwieldy, nor 
loaded it so hard, but yet I brought away several things 
very useful to me; as, first, in the carpenter's stores I 
found two or three bags of nails and spikes, a great screw- 
jack, a dozen or two of hatchets ; and, above all, that most 
useful thing called a grindstone. All these I secured 
together, with several things belonging to the gunner; 
particularly, two or three iron crows, and two barrels of 
musket bullets, seven muskets, and another fowling-piece, 
with some small quantity of powder more ; a large bag full 
of small shot, and a great roll of sheet lead ; but this last 
was so heavy, I could not hoist it up to get it over the ship's 
side. Besides these things, I took all the men's clothes that 
I could find, and a spare fore-topsail, a hammock, and some 
bedding; and with this I loaded my second raft, and 
brought them all safe on shore, to my yery great comfort 

I was under some apprehensions lest, during my absence 
from the land, my provisions might be devoured on shore ; 
but when I came back, I found no sign of any visitor, only 
there sat a creature like a wild cat, upon one of the chests, 
which, when I came towards it, ran away a little distance, 
and then stood still. She sat very composed and uncon- 
cerned, and looked full in my face, as if she had a mind to 
be acquainted with me. I presented my gun to her, but, 
as she did not understand it, she was perfectly unconcerned 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 37 

at it, nor did she offer to stir away ; upon which I tossed 
her a bit of biscuit, though, by the way, I was not very free 
of it, for my store was not great ; however, I spared her 
a bit, I say, and she went to it, smelled of it, and ate it, 
and looked (as pleased) for more ; but I thanked her, and 
could spare no more : so she marched off. 

Having got my second cargo on shore, though I was fain 
to open the barrels of powder, and bring them by parcels-^ 
for they were too heavy, being large casks — I went to work 
to make me a little tent, with the sail, and some poles, 
which I cut for that purpose ; and into this tent I brought 
everything that I knew would spoil either with rain or sun ; 
and I piled all the empty chests and casks up in a circle 
round the tent, to fortify it from any sudden attempt either 
from man or beast. 

When I had done this, I blocked up the door of the tent 
with some boards within, and an empty chest set up on 
end without; and spreading one of the beds upon the 
ground, laying my two pistols just at my head, and my gun 
at length by me, I went to bed for the first time, and slept 
very quietly all night, for I was very weary and heavy ; for 
the night before I had slept little, and had laboured very 
hard all day, as well to fetch all those things from the ship, 
as to get them on shore. 

3. Crusoe's Possessions. — I had the biggest 
magazine of all kinds now that ever was laid up, I believe, 
for one man; but I was not satisfied still, for while the 
ship sat upright in that posture, I thought I ought to get 
everything out of her that I could ; so every day, at low 
water, I went on board, and brought away something or 
other. But particularly the third time I went, I brought 
away as much of the rigging as I could, as also all the small 
ropes and rope-twine I could get, with a piece of spare 
canvas, which was to mend the sails upon occasion, and 
a barrel of wet gunpowder. In a word, I brought away all 
the sails first and last ; only that I was fain to cut them in 
pieces, and bring as much at a time as I could ; for they 
were no more useful to be sails, but as mere canvas only. 

But that which comforted me still more was, that, last of 
all, after I had made five or six such voyages as these, and 



38 ADVENTURES OF 

thought I had nothing more to expect from the ship that 
was worth my meddling with ; I say, after all this, I found 
a great hogshead of bread, and three large runlets of rum or 
spirits, and a box of sugar, and a barrel of fine flour. This 
was surprising to me, because I had given over expecting 
any more provisions, except what was spoiled by the water. 
I soon emptied the hogshead of that bread, and wrapped 
it up, parcel by parcel, in pieces of the sails, which I cut 
out ; and, in a word, I got all this safe on shore also. 

The next day I made another voyage, and now having 
plundered the ship of what was portable and fit to hand out, 
I began with the cables, and cutting the great cable into 
pieces such as I could move, I got two cables and a hawser 
on shore, with all the iron work I could get ; and having 
cut down the spritsail-yard, and the mizen-yard, and every- 
thing I could, to make a large raft, I loaded it with all those 
heavy goods, and came away. But my good luck began now 
to leave me ; for this raft was so unwieldy, and so over- 
laden, that after I was entered the little cove, where I had 
landed the rest of my goods, not being able to guide it so 
handily as I did the other, it overset, and threw me and all 
my cargo into the water; as for myself, it was no great 
harm, for I was near the shore ; but as to my cargo, it was 
a great pirt of it lost, especially the iron, which I expected 
would have been of great use to me : however, when the 
tide was out, I got most of the pieces of cable ashore, and 
some of the iron, though with infinite labour ; for I was 
fain to dip for it into the water, a work which fatigued me 
very much. After this I went every day on board, and 
brought away what I could get. 

4. Last Visit to the Ship. — I had been now thirteen 
days ashore, and had been eleven times on board the ship ; 
in which time I had brought away all that one pair of hands 
could well be supposed capable to bring ; though I believe 
verily, had the calm weather held, I should have brought 
away the whole ship, piece by piece. But preparing, the 
twelfth time, to go on board, I found the wind began to 
rise : however, at low water, I went on board ; and though 
I thought I had rummaged the cabin so effectually as that 
nothing could be found, yet I discovered a locker with 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 39 

drawers in it, in one of which I found two or three razors, 
and one pair of large scissors, with some ten or a dozen of 
good knives and forks ; in another I found about thirty-six 
pounds in money, some European coin, some Brazil, some 
pieces of eight, some gold, and some silver. 

I smiled to myself at the sight of this money : O drug ! 
I exclaimed, what art thou good for ? Thou art not worth to 
me, no, not the taking off the ground ; one of those knives 
is worth all this heap : I have no manner of use for thee ; 
e'en remain where thou art, and go to the bottom, as a 
creature whose life is not worth saving. However, upon 
second thoughts, I took it away ; and wrapping all this in a 
piece of canvas, I began to think of making another raft ; 
but while I was preparing this, I found the sky overcast, 
and the wind began to rise, and in a quarter of an hour it 
blew a fresh gale from the shore. It presently occurred to 
me, that it was in vain to pretend to make a raft with the 
wind off shore; and that it was my business to be gone 
before the tide of flood began, or otherwise I might not be 
able to reach the shore at all. Accordingly I let myself 
down ihto the water, and swam across the channel which lay 
between the ship and the sands, and even that with difficulty 
enough, partly with the weight of the things I had about me, 
and partly the roughness of the water ; for the wind rose very 
hastily, and before it was quite high water it blew a storm. 

But I was got home to my little tent, where I lay, with 
all my wealth about me very secure. It blew very hard all 
that night, and in the morning, when I looked out, behold 
no more ship was to be seen! I was a little surprised, but 
recovered myself with this satisfactory reflection, viz. that I 
had lost no time, nor abated no diligence, to get everything 
out of her, that could be useful to me, and that, indeed, 
there was little left in her that I was able to bring away, it 
I had had more time. 



Yll.— ROBINSON'S ENCAMPMENT. 
I. Crusoe Shifts his Quarters. — I now gave over 

any more thoughts of the ship, or of anything out of her, 
except what might drive on shore, from her wreck; as, 



40 ADVENTURES OF 

indeed, divers pieces of her afterwards did j but those things 
were of little use to me. 

My thoughts were now wholly employed about securing 
myself against either savages, if any should appear, or wild 
beasts, if any were in the island ; and I had many thoughts 
of the method how to do this, and what kind of dwelling to 
make, whether I should make me a cave in the earth, 
or a tent upon the earth ; and, in short, I resolved upon 
both ; the manner and description of which, it may not be 
improper to give an account of. 

I soon found the place I was in was not for my settlement, 
particularly because it was upon a low, moorish ground, near 
the sea, and I believed would not be wholesome ; and more 
particularly because there was no fresh water near it ; so I 
resolved to find a more healthy and more convenient spot 
of ground. 

I consulted several things in my situation, which I found 
would be proper for me : first, air and fresh water, I just now 
mentioned ; secondly, shelter from the heat of the sun; thirdly, 
security from ravenous creatures, whether men or beasts ; 
fourthly, a view to the sea, that if God sent any ship in 
sight, I might not lose any advantage for my deliverance, 
of which I was not willing to banish all my expectations 
yet 

In search for a place proper for this, I found a little plain 
on the side of a rising hili, whose front towards this little plain 
was steep as a house-side, so that nothing could come down 
upon me from the top. On the side of this rock there was 
a hollow place, worn a little way in, like the entrance or 
door of a cave ; but there was not really any cave, or way 
into the rock, at all. 

On the flat of the green, just before this hollow place, I 
resolved to pitch my tent. This plain was not above a 
hundred yards broad, and about twice as long, and lay like 
a green before my door ; and, at the end of it, descending 
irregularly every way down into the low ground by the sea- 
side. It was on the N.N.W. side of the hill ; so that it was 
sheltered from the heat every day, till it came to a W. and 
by S.^ sun, or thereabouts, which, in those countries, is near 
the setting. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 4 1 

Before I set up my tent, I drew a half-circle before the 
hollow place, which took in about ten yards in its serai- 
diameter from the rock, and twenty yards in its diameter, 
from its beginning and ending. 

In this half-circle I pitched two rows of strong stakes, 
driving them into the ground till they stood very firm like 
piles, the biggest end being out of the ground, about five 
feet and a half, and sharpened on the top. The two rows 
did not stand above six inches from one another. 

Then I took the pieces of cable which I cut in the ship, 
and laid them in rows, one upon another, within the circle, 
between these two rows of stakes, up to the top, placing 
other stakes in the inside, leaning against them, about two 
feet and a half high, like a spur to a post ; and this fence was 
so strong, that neither man nor beast could get into it ox 
over it. This cost me a great deal of time and labour, 
especially to cut the piles in the woods, bring them to the 
place, and drive them into the earth. 

The entrance into this place I made to be not by a door, 
but by a short ladder to go over the top, which ladder, when 
I was in, I lifted over after me ; and so I was completely 
fenced in and fortified, as I thought, from all the world, and 
consequently slept secure in the night, which otherwise I could 
not have done ; though, as it appeared afterwards, there was 
no need of all this caution against the enemies that I 
apprehended danger from. 

2. Crusoe Stocks his House. — Into this fence, or 
fortress, with infinite labour, I carried all my riches, all my 
provisions, ammunition, and stores, of which you have the 
account above ; and I made a large tent, which, to preserve 
me from the rains that in one part of the year are very 
violent there, I made double, viz. one smaller tent within, 
and one larger tent above it, and covered the uppermost 
with a large tarpaulin,^ which I had saved among the sails. 

And now I lay no more for a while in the bed which I 
had brought on shore, but in a hammock, which was indeed 
a very good one, and belonged to the mate of the ship. 

Into this tent I brought all my provisions, and everything 
that would spoil by the wet ; and having thus enclosed all 
my goods, I made up the entrance, which till now I had 



42 ADVENTURES OF 

left open, and so passed and repassed, as I said, by a shor 
ladder. 

When I had done this, I began to work my way into the 
rock, and bringing all the earth and stones that I dug dowt 
out through my tent, I laid them up within my fence, in the 
nature of a terrace, so that it raised the ground within abouf 
a foot and a half; and thus I made me a cave, just behind 
my tent, which served me like a cellar to my house. It cost 
me much labour and many days before all these things were 
brought to perfection, and therefore I must go back to 
some other things which took up some of my thoughts. At 
the same time it happened, after I had laid my scheme foi 
the setting up my tent, and making the cave, that a storm 
of rain falling from a thick, dark cloud, a sudden flash oi 
lightning happened, and after that, a great clap of thundei 
as is naturally the effect of it. I was not so much surprisec 
with the lightning as I was with a thought, which darte< 
into my mind as swift as the lightning itself : O my powder 
My very heart sank within me when I thought that at on 
blast all my powder might be destroyed, on which, not m 
defence only, but the providing me food, as I thought 
entirely depended. I was nothing near so anxious abot 
my own danger, though, had the powder taken fire, I shoul 
never have known who had hurt me. 

Such impression did this make upon me, that after th) 
storm was over, I laid aside all my works, my building an( 
fortifying, and applied myself to make bags and boxes b 
separate the powder, and to keep it a little and a little in ; 
parcel, in hope that whatever might come, it might not al 
take fire at once ; and to keep it so apart, that it should no 
be possible to make one part fire another. I finished thi 
work in about a fortnight ; and I think my powder, whicl 
in all was about two hundred and forty pounds weight, wa 
divided into not less than a hundred parcels. As to th 
barrel that had been wet, I did not apprehend any dange 
from that ; so I placed that in my new cave, which, in m 
fancy, I called my kitchen, and the rest I hid up and dowi 
in holes among the rocks, so that no wet might come to il 
marking very carefully where I laid it

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 43 

interval of time while this was doing, I went out at least 
once every day with my gun, as well to divert myself as to 
see if I could kill anything fit for food ; and, as near as I 
could, to acquaint myself with what the island produced. 
The first time I went out, I presently discovered that there 
were goats upon the island, which was a great satisfaction 
to rae ; but then it was attended with this misfortune to 
me, viz., that they were so shy, so subtle, and so swift of 
foot, that it was the most difficult thing in the world to 
come at them. But I was not discouraged at this, not 
doubting but I might now and then shoot one, as it soon 
happened ; for after I had found their haunts a little, I laid 
wait in this manner for them : I observed, if they saw me 
in the valleys, though they were upon the rocks, they would 
run away in a terrible fright ; but if they were feeding 
in the valleys, and I was upon the locks, they took 
no notice of me ; from whence I concluded, that by the 
position of their optics,^ their sight was so directed down- 
nrards, that they did not readily see objects that were above 
them. So afterwards I took this method — I always climbed 
the rocks first, to get above them, and then had frequently 
a feir mark. The first shot I made among these creatures, 
[ killed a she-goat, which had a little kid by her, which she 
gave suck to, which grieved me heartily ; but when the old 
one fell, the kid stood stock still by her, till I came and 
took her up ; and not only so, but when I carried the old 
one with me, upon my shoulders, the kid followed me quite 
to my enclosure ; upon which I laid down the dam, and 
took the kid in my arms, and carried it over my pale, in 
hopes to have bred it up tame ; but it would not eat ; so I 
was forced to kill it, and eat it myself. These two supplied 
me with flesh a great while, for I ate sparingly, and pre- 
served my provisions (my bread especially) as much as 
possibly I could. And now being to enter into a melan- 
choly relation of a scene of silent life, such, perhaps, as 
was never heard of in the world before, I shall take it 
from its beginning, and continue it in its order. It was, 
by my account, the 30th of September, when, in the 
manner as above said, I first set foot upon this horrid island ; 
v^rhen the sun being to us in its autumnal equinox,^ was

almost just over my head ; for I reckoned myself, by obser- 
vation, to be in the latitude of nine degrees twenty-two 
minutes north of the Line.

Vlll.— ROBINSON SETTLES DOWN 

1. Crusoe's Almanac. — After I had been there about 
ten or twelve days, it came into my thoughts that I should 
lose my reckoning of time for want of books, and pen and 
ink, and should even forget the sabbath days from the 
working days ; but, to prevent this, I cut it with my knife 
upon a large post, in capital letters ; and making it into a 
great cross, 1 set it up on the shore where I first landed, 
viz., " I came on shore here on the 30th of September, 
1659." Upon the sides of this square post I cut every day 
a notch with my knife, and every seventh notch was as long 
again as the rest, and every first day of the month as long 
again as that long one : and thus I kept my calendar, or 
weekly, monthly, and yearly reckoning of time. 

2. Useful Tools Saved and \yanted. — But it 

happened that among the many things which I brought out 
of the ship, in the several voyages which, as above men- 
tioned, I made to it, I got several things of less value, 
but not at all less useful to me, which I found, some time 
after, in rummaging the chests : as, in particular, pens, ink, 
and paper ; several parcels in the captain^s, mate's, gunner's, 
and carpenter's keeping ; three or four compasses, some 
mathematical instruments, dials, perspectives, charts, and 
books of navigation ; all of which I huddled together, 
whether I might want them or no : also, I found three very 
good Bibles, which came to me in my cargo from England, 
and which I had packed up among my things ; some Por- 
tuguese books also, and, among them, two or three Popish 
prayer-books, and several other books, all which I carefully 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 45 

secured And I must not forget, that we had in the ship a 
dog and two cats, of whose eminent history I may have 
occasion to say something, in its place : for I carried both 
the cats with me ; and as for the dog, he jumped out of the 
ship himself, and swam on shore to me the day after I went 
on shore with my first cargo, and was a trusty servant to me 
for many years. I wanted nothing that he could fetch me, 
nor any company that he could make up to me ; I only 
wanted to have him talk to me, but that he would not do. As 
I observed before, I found pens, ink, and paper, and I hus- 
banded them to the utmost ; and I shall show that while 
my ink lasted, I kept things very exact, but after that was 
gone, I could not ; for I could not make any ink, by any 
means that I could devise. 

And this put me in mind that I wanted many things, 
notwithstanding all that I had amassed together; and of 
these, this of ink was one ; as also a spade, pickaxe, and 
shovel, to dig or remove the earth; needles, pins, and 
thread ; as for linen, I soon learned to want that without 
much difficulty. 

This want of tools made every work I did go on heavily : 
and it was near a whole year before I had entirely finished my 
little pale, or surrounded my habitation. The piles or stakes, 
which were as heavy as I could well lift, were a long time in 
cutting and preparing in the woods, and more by far in 
bringing home ; so that I spent sometimes two days in cutting 
and bringing home one of those posts, and a third day in 
driving it into the ground ; for which purpose, I got a heavy 
piece of wood at first, but at last bethought myself of one of 
the iron crows ; which, however, though I found it answer, 
made driving these posts or piles very laborious and tedious 
work. But what need I have been concerned at the 
tediousness of anything I had to do, seeing that I had time 
enough to do it in, nor had I any other employment, if that 
had been over, at least that I could foresee, except the 
ranging the island to seek for food, which I did, more or 
less, every day. 

3 Reflections. — I now began to consider seriously 
my condition, and the circumstances I was reduced to; 
and I drew up the state of my affairs in writing, not so 



46 ADVENTURES OF 

much to leave them to any that were to come after 
me (for I was like to have but few heirs), as to 
deliver my thoughts from daily poring upon them, and 
afflicting my mind ; and as my reason began now to master 
my despondency, I began to comfort myself as well as I 
could, and to set the good against the evil, that I might 
have something to distinguish my case from worse ; and I 
stated very impartially, like debtor and creditor,^ the comforts 
I enjoyed against the miseries I suffered, thus : — 

EVIL. GOOD.

of recovery. were,

I have got out so many necessary 
things, as will either supply my 
wants, or enable me to supply 
myself, even as long as I live. 

Upon the whole, here was an undoubted testimony, that 
there was scarce any condition in the world so miserable, 
but there was something negative,^ or something positive,^ to 
be thankful for in it : and let this stand as a direction, from 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 47 

the experience of the most miserable of all conditions in this 
world, that we may always find in it something to comfort 
ourselves from, and to set, in the description of good and 
evil, on the credit side of the account. 
4. Crusoe Sets his House in Order. — Having 

now brought my mind a little to relish my condition, 
and given over looking out to sea, to see if I could 
spy a ship ; I say giving over these things, I began to 
apply myself to accommodate my way of living, and to 
make things as easy to me as I could. 

I have already described my habitation, which was a tent 
under the side of a rock, surrounded with a strong pale of 
posts and cables ; but I might now rather call it a wall, for 
I raised a kind of wall against it of turfs, about two feet thick 
on the outside : and after some time (I think it was a year 
and a halQ I raised rafters from it, leaning to the rock, and 
thatched or covered it with boughs of trees, and such things 
as I could get, to keep out the rain ; which I found, at some 
times of the year, very violent 

I have already observed how I brought all my goods into 

this pale, and into the cave which I had made behind me. 

But I must observe, too, that at first this was a confused 

heap of goods, which, as they lay in no order, so they took up 

all my place. I had no room to turn myself, so I set myself 

to enlarge my cave, and work farther into the earth ; for it 

was a soft sandy rock, which yielded easily to the labour I 

bestowed on it : and when I found I was pretty safe as to the 

beasts of prey, I worked sideways to the right hand into 

the rock, and then turning to the right again, worked quite 

out, and made me a door to come out in the outside of my 

pale or fortification. This gave me not only egress and 

regress,^ as it were, a back way to my tent and to my 

storehouse, but gave me room to stow my goods. 

And now I began to apply myself to make such 
necessary things as I found I most wanted, particularly a 
chair and a table ; for without these I was not able to enjoy 
the few comforts I had in the world : I could not write, or 
eat, or do several things with so much pleasure, without a 
table ; so I went to work. And here I must needs observe, 
that as reason is the substance and original of the mathe- 



48 ADVENTURES OF 

matics, so by stating and squaring everything by reason, and 
by making the most rational judgment of things, every man 
may be, in time, master of every mechanic art. I had never 
handled a tool in my life; and yet, in time, by labour, 
application, and contrivance, I found at last that I wanted 
nothing but I could have made it, especially if I had had 
tools. However, I made abundance of things, even with- 
out tools ; and some with no more tools than an adze and a 
hatchet, which perhaps were never made that way before, 
and that with infinite labour. For example, if I wanted a 
board, I had no other way but to cut down a tree, set it on 
an edge before me, and hew it flat on either side with my axe, 
till I had brought it to be as thin as a plank, and then dub 
it smooth with my adze. It is true, by this method, I could 
make but one board of a whole tree; but this I had no 
remedy for but patience, any more than I had for a prodigious 
•deal of time and labour which it took me up to make a 
plank or board : but my time or labour was little worth, and 
so it was as well employed one way as another. 

However, I made me a table and a chair, as I observed 
above, in the first place ; and this I did out of the short 
pieces of boards that I brought on my raft from the ship. 
But when I wrought out some boards, as above, I made 
large shelves, of the breadth of a foot and a half, one over 
another, all along one side of my cave, to lay all my tools, 
nails, and iron work on ; and, in a word, to separate every 
thing at large, in their places, that I might easily come at 
them. I knocked pieces into the wall of the rock, to hang 
my guns, and all things that would hang up : so that had my 
cave been seen, it would have looked like a general maga- 
zine^ of all necessary things ; and I had every thing so 
ready at my hand, that it was a great pleasure to me to see 
all my goods in such order, and especially to find my stock 
of all necessaries so great. 

5. Beginning a Journal. — And now it was that 
I began to keep a journal ot every day's employ- 
ment; for, indeed, at first, I was in too much hurry, 
and not only as to labour, but in much discomposure 
of mind ; and my journal would, too, have been full of many 
dull things: for example, I must have said thus — ''^Z. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE.

30th. After I had got to shore, and had escaped drowning, 
instead of being thajnkful to God for my deliverance, having 
first vomited with the great quantity of salt water which was 
gotten into my stomach, and recovering myself a little, I ran 
about the shore, wringing my hands, and beating my head 
and face, exclaiming at my misery, and crying out I was 
undone, undone ! till, tired and faint, I was forced to lie 
down on the ground to repose ; but durst not sleep, for fear 
of being devoured " 

Some days after this, and after I had been on board the 
ship and got all that I could out of her, I could not forbear 
getting up to the top of a little mountain, and. looking out 
to sea, in hopes of seeing a ship : then fancy that at a vast 
distance I spied a sail, please myself with the hopes of it, 
and, after looking steadily, till I was almost blind, lose 
it quite, and sit down and weep like a child, and thus 
increase my misery by my folly. 

But, having gotten over these things in some measure, 
and having settled my household stuff and habitation, made 
me a table and a chair, and all as handsome about me as I 
could, I began to keep my journal, of which I shall here 
give you the copy (though in it will be told all these 
particulars over again) as long as it lasted ; for having no 
mox'e ink, I was forced to leave it off.

IX.— THE JOURNAL. 

September 30th, 1659. I, poor miserable Robinson 
Crusoe, being shipwrecked, during a dreadful storm, in 
the offing, came on shore on this dismal unfortunate island, 
which I called the Island of Despair, all the rest of the 
ship's company being drowned, and myself almost dead. 

All the rest of that day I spent in afflicting myself at the 
dismal circumstances I was brought to, viz., I had neither 

D 



50 ADVENTURES OF 

food, house, clothes, weapon, nor place to fly to ; and, in 
despair of any relief, saw nothing but death before me ; that 
I should either be devoured by wild beasts, murdered by 
savages, or starved to death for want of food. At the ap- 
proach of night I slept in a tree, for fear of wild creatures ; 
but slept soundly, though it rained all night. 

October i. In the morning I saw, to my great surprise, 
the ship had floated with the high tide, and was driven on 
shore again much nearer the island ; which, as it was some 
comfort on one hand (for seeing her sit upright, and not 
broken in pieces, I hoped, if the wind abated, I might get 
on board, and get some food and necessaries out of her for 
my relief), so, on the other hand, it renewed my grief at the 
loss of my comrades, who, I imagined, if we had all stayed 
on board, might have saved the ship, or, at least, that they 
would not have been all drowned, as they were ; and that, 
had the men been saved, we might perhaps have built us a 
boat, out of the ruins of the ship, to have carried us to 
some other part of the world. I spent great part of this 
day in perplexing myself on these things ; but, at length, 
seeing the ship almost dry, I went upon the sand as near as 
I could, and then swam on board. This day also it con- 
tinued raining, though with no wind at all. 

From the ist of October to the 24th. All these days en- 
tirely spent in making several voyages to get all I could out 
of the ship ; which I brought on shore, every tide of flood, 
upon rafts. Much rain also in these days, though with some 
intervals of fair weather ; but, it seems, this was the rainy 
season. 

Oct. 20. I overset my raft, and all the goods I had got 
upon it; but being in shoal water, and the things being 
chiefly heavy, I recovered many of them when the tide was 
out 

Oct. 25. It rained all night and all day, with some gusts 
of wind, during which time the ship broke in pieces (the 
wind blowing a little harder than before) and was no more 
to be seen, except the wreck of her, and that only at low 
water. I spent this day in covering and securing the goods 
which I had saved, that the rain might not spoil them. 

Oct. 26. I walked about the shore almost all day, to find 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 5 1 

out a place to fix my habitation, greatly concerned to 
secure myself from any attack in the night, either from wild 
beasts or men. Towards night I fixed upon a proper place, 
under a rock, and marked out a semicircle for my encamp- 
ment, which I resolved to strengthen with a work, wall, or 
fortification, made of double piles lined within with cables, 
and without with tur£ 

From the 26th to the 30th, I worked very hard in carrying 
all my goods to my new habitation, though some part of the 
time it rained exceedingly hard. 

The 31st, in the morning, I went out into the island with 
my gun, to see for some food, and discover the country ; 
when I killed a she-goat, and her kid followed me home, 
which I afterwards killed also, because it would not feed. 

November i. I set up my tent under a rock, and lay 
there for the first night ; making it as large as I could, with 
stakes driven in to swing my hammock upon. 

Nov. 2. I set up all my chests and boards, and the 
pieces of timber which made my rafts, and with them 
formed a fence round me, a little within the place I had 
marked out for my fortification. 

Nov. 3. I went out with my gun, and killed two fowls 
like ducks, which were very good food. In the afternoon I 
went to work to make me a table. 

Nov. 4. This morning I began to order my times of 
work, of going out with my gun, time of sleep, and time of 
diversion — viz., every morning I walked out with my gun 
for two or three hours, if it did not rain ; then employed 
myself to work till about eleven o'clock ; then ate what I 
had to live on ; and from twelve to two I lay down to 
sleep, the weather being excessive hot; and then, in the 
evening, to work again. The working part of this day and 
the next was wholly employed in making my table, for I was 
yet but a very sorry workman : though time and necessity 
made me a complete natural mechanic soon after, as I 
believe they would any one else. 

Nov. 5. This day went abroad with my gun and dog, 
and killed a wild cat ; her skin pretty soft, but her flesh good 
for nothing : of every creature that I killed I took off the 
^kins, and preserved them. Coming back by the seashore, 



52 ADVENTURES OF 

I saw many sorts of seafowl which I did not understand : 
but was surprised, and almost frightened, with two or 
three seals ; which while I was gazing at them (not well 
knowing what they were) got into the sea, and escaped me 
for that time. 

Nov. 6. After my morning walk, I went to work with 
my table again, and finished it, though not to my liking : 
nor was it long before I learned to mend it. 

Nov. 7. Now it began to be settled fair weather. The 
7th, 8th, 9th, loth, and part of the 12th (for the nth was 
Sunday, according to my reckoning), I took wholly up to 
make me a chair, and with much ado brought it to a toler- 
able shape, but never to please me ; and even in the making, 
I pulled it in pieces several times. 

Note. I soon neglected my keeping Sundays ; for omit- 
ting my mark for them on my post, I forgot which was 
which. 

Nov. 13. This day it rained; which refreshed me ex- 
ceedingly, and cooled the earth : but it was accompanied 
with terrible thunder and lightning, which frightened me 
dreadfully, for fear of my powder. As soon as it was 
over, I resolved to separate my stock of powder into as 
many little parcels as possible, that it might not be in 
danger. 

Nov. 14, 15, 16. These three days I spent in making 
little square chests or boxes, which might hold about a. 
pound, or two pounds at most, of powder : and so, putting 
the powder in, I stowed it in places as secure and as remote 
from one another as possible. On one of these three days 
I killed a large bird that was good to eat ; but I knew not 
what to call it. 

Nov. 17. This day I began to dig behind my tent, into 
the rock, to make room for my farther convenience. 

Note. Three things I wanted exceedingly for this work, 
viz., a pickaxe, a shovel, and a wheelbarrow, or basket ; so 
I desisted from niy work, and began to consider how to 
supply these wants, and make me some tools. As for a 
pickaxe, I made use of the iron crows, which were proper 
enough, though heavy : but the next thing was a shovel 
or spade ; this was so absolutely necessary, that, indeed, I 



i 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 53 

could do nothing effectually without it ; but what kind of 
one to make I knew not. 

Nov. 1 8. The next day, in searching the woods, I found 
a tree of that wood, or like it, which, in the Brazils, they 
call the iron tree, from its exceeding hardness : of this, with 
great labour, and almost spoiling my axe, I cut a piece ; 
and brought it home, too, with difficulty enough, for it was 
exceeding heavy. The excessive hardness of the wood, and 
my having no other way, made me a long while upon this 
machine: for I worked it effectually, by little and little, 
into the form of a shovel or spade; the handle exactly 
shaped like ours in England, only that the broad part 
having no iron shod upon it at the bottom, it would not 
last me so long: however, it served well enough for the 
uses which I had occasion to put it to ; but never was 
a shovel, I believe, made after that fashion, or so long in 
making. 

I was still deficient ; for I wanted a basket, or a wheel- 
barrow. A basket I could not make by any means, having 
no such things as twigs that would bend to make wicker 
ware ; at least, none yet found out : and as to the wheel- 
barrow, I fancied I could make all but the wheel, but that 
I had no notion of; neither did I know how to go about it : 
besides, I had no possible way to make iron gudgeons for 
the spindle or axis of the wheel to run in ; so I gave it 
over : and, for carrying away the earth which I dug out of 
the cave, I made me a thing like a hod, which the labourers 
carry mortar in for the bricklayers. This was not so diffi- 
cult to me as the making the shovel : and yet this and the 
shovel, and the attempt which I made in vain to make a 
wheelbarrow, took me up no less than four days ; I mean 
always excepting my morning walk with my gun, which I 
seldom omitted, and very seldom failed also bringing home 
something fit to eat. 

Nov. 23. My other work having now stood still, because 
of my making these tools, when they were finished I went on ; 
and working every day, as my strength and time allowed, I 
spent eighteen days entirely in widening and deepening my 
cave, that it might hold my goods commodiously. 

Note. During all this time, I worked to make this room

or cave spacious enough to accommodate me as a 
house or magazine, a kitchin, a dining-room, and a i 
As for a lodging, I kept to the tent : except that s 
times, in the wet season of the year, it rained so 
that I could not keep myself dry ; which caused me 
wards to cover all my place within my pale with 
poles, and in the form of rafters, leaning against the 
and load them with flags and large leaves of trees 
a thatch. 

December io. I began now to think my cave oi 
finished ; when on a sudden (it seems I had made 
large) a great quantity of earth fell down from the to 
one side ; so much, that, in short, it frightened mi 
not without reason too ; for if I had been under it, I s 
never have wanted a grave-digger. Upon this disas 
had a great deal of work to do over again, for I ha 
loose earth to carry out ; and, which was of more impor 
I had the ceiling to prop up, so that I might be si 
more would come down. 

Dec. 1 1 . This day I went to work with it accord 
and got two shores or posts pitched upright to th 
with two pieces of board across over each post : 
finished the next day; and setting more posts uj 
boards, in about a week more I had the roof secured 
the posts, standing in rows, served me for partitions t 
off my house. 

Dec. 17. From this day to the 30th, I placed si 
and knocked up nails on the posts, to hang everyth 
that could be hung up : and now I began to be in 
order within doors. 

Dec, 20. I carried everything into the cave, and 
to furnish my house, and set up some pieces of board 
a dresser, to order my victuals upon ; but boards be 
be very scarce with me : also I made me another tabl

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 55 

I had it home, I bound and splintered up its leg, which 
was broke. 

N.B. I took such care of it that it lived ; and the leg 
grew well, and as strong as ever : but, by nursing it so long, 
it grew tame, and fed upon the little green at my door, 
and would not go away. This was the first time that I 
entertained a thought of breeding up some tame creatures, 
that I might have food when my powder and shot was all 
spent. 

Dec. 28, 29, 30, 31. Great heats, and no breeze; so 
that there was no stirring abroad, except in the evening, 
for food ; this time I spent in putting all my things in order 
within doors. 



IL.— THE JOURNAL {continued). 

January i, 1660. Very hot still; but I went abroad 
early and late with my gun, and lay still in the middle of 
the day. This evening, going farther into the valleys 
which lay towards the centre of the island, I found there 
was plenty of goats, though exceeding shy, and hard to 
come at ; however, I resolved to try if I could not bring 
my dog to hunt them down. Accordingly, the next day, I 
went out with my dog, and set him upon the goats : but I 
was mistaken, for they all faced about upon the dog ; and 
he knew his danger too well, for he would not come near 
them. 

Jan. 3. I began my fence or wall ; which, being still 
jesdous of my being attacked by somebody, I resolved to 
make very thick and strong. 

N.B. This wall being described before, I purposely omit 
what was said in the journal ; it is sufficient to observe, that I 
was no less time than from the 3rd of January to the 14th of 
April, working, finishing, and perfecting this wall ; though it 
was no more than about twenty-five yards in length, being a 
half-circle, from one place in the rock to another place, 
about twelve yards from it, the door of the cave being in the 
centre, behind it. 

All this time I worked very hard ; the rains hindering me 



56 ADVENTURES OF 

many days, nay, sometimes weeks together : but I thought 
I should never be perfectly secure till this wall was finished ; 
and it is scarce credible what inexpressible labour everything 
was done with, especially the bringing piles out of the woods, 
and driving them into the ground ; for I made them much 
bigger than I needed to have done. 

When this wall was finished, and the outside double fenced, 
with a turf wall raised up close to it, I persuaded myself that 
if any people were to come on shore there they would not 
perceive anything like a habitation : and it was very well I 
did so, as may be observed hereafter, upon a very remark- 
able occasion. 

During this time, I made my rounds in the woods for 
game every day, when the rain permitted me, and made 
frequent discoveries, in these walks, of something or other to 
my advantage ; particularly, I found a kind of wild pigeons, 
who build, not as wood-pigeons, in a tree, but rather as 
house -pigeons, in the holes of the rocks : and, taking some 
young ones, I endeavoured to breed them up tame, and did 
so ; but when they grew older, they flew all away ; which, 
perhaps, was, at first, for want of feeding them, for I had 
nothing to give them ; however, I frequently found their 
nests, and got their young ones, which were very good 
meat. 

And now, in the managing my household affairs, I found 
myself wanting in many things, which I thought at first it 
was impossible for me to make ; as indeed, as to some of 
them, it was : for instance, I could never make a cask to be 
hooped. I had a small runlet or two, as I observed before; 
but I could never arrive at the capacity of making one by 
them, though I spent many weeks about it : I could neither 
put in the heads, nor join the staves so true to one another 
as to make them hold water ; so I gave that also over. In 
the next place, I was at a great loss for candle ; so that as 
soon as it was dark, which was generally by seven o'clock, I 
was obliged to go to bed. I remembered the lump of bees- 
wax with which I made candles in my African adventure ; 
but I had none of that now : the only remedy I had was, 
that when I had killed a goat, I saved the tallow ; and with 
a httle dish made of clay, which I baked in the sun, to which 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 57 

I added a wick of some oakum, I made me a lamp ; and this 
gave me a light, though not a clear steady light like a candle. 
In the middle of all my labours it happened, that in rummag- 
ing my things, I found a little bag ; which, as I hinted before, 
had been filled with corn, for the feeding of poultry ; not 
for this voyage, but before, as I suppose, when the ship 
came from Lisbon. What little remainder of corn had been 
in the bag was all devoured by the rats, and I saw nothing 
in the bag but husks and dust ; and being willing to have the 
bag for some other use (I think it was to put powder in, when 
I divided it for fear of the lightning, or some such use), I 
shook the husks of corn out of it, on one side of my forti- 
fications, under the rock. 

It was a little before the great rain just now mentioned, 
that I threw this stuff away ; taking no notice of anything, 
and not so much as remembering that I had thrown any- 
thing there : when, about a month after, I saw some few 
stalks of something green, shooting out of the ground, which 
I fancied might be some plant I had not seen ; but I was 
surprised, and perfectly astonished, when, after a little longer 
time, I saw about ten or twelve ears come out, which were 
perfect green barley, of the same kind as our European, nay, 
as our English barley. 

I carefully saved the ears of this com, you may be sure, 
in their season, which was about the end of June ; and, 
laying up every corn, I resolved to sow them all again ; 
hoping in time to have some quantity sufficient to supply 
me with bread. But it was not till the fourth year [that I 
could allow myself the least grain of this corn to eat, and 
even then but sparingly, as I shall show afterwards in its 
order ; for I lost all that I sowed the first season, by not 
observing the proper time ; for I sowed it just before the dry 
season, so that it never came up at all, at least not as it 
would have done— of which in its place. 

Besides this barley, there were twenty or thirty stalks of 
rice, which I preserved with the same care ; and whose use 
was of the same kind, or to the same purpose, viz., to make 
me bread, or rather food ; for I found ways to cook it up 
without baking, though I did that also after some time. 
But to return to my Journal. 



58 ADVENTURES OF 

I worked excessively hard these three or four months, to 
get my wall done ; and the 14th of April I closed it up, 
contriving to get into it, not by a door, but over the wall, by 
a ladder, that there might be no sign on the outside of my 
habitation. 

April 16. I finished the ladder ; so I went up with the 
ladder to the top, and then pulled it up after me, and let it 
down in the inside ; this was a complete enclosure to me ; 
for within I had room enough, and nothing could come at 
me from without, unless it could first mount my wall. 

The very next day after this wall was finished, I had 
almost all my labour overthrown at once, and myself killed. 
The case was thus : As I was busy in the inside of it, 
behind my tent, just at the entrance into my cave, I was 
terribly frightened with a most dreadful sutprising thing 
indeed; for, all on a sudden, I found the earth come 
crumbling down from the roof of my cave, and from the 
edge of the hill over my head, and two of the posts I had 
set up in the cave cracked in a frightful manner. I was 
heartily scared ; but thought nothing of what really was the 
cause, only thinking that the top of my cave was falling in^ 
as some of it had done before ; and for fear I should be 
buried in it, I ran forward to ray ladder, and not thinking 
myself safe there neither, I got over my wall for fear of the 
pieces of the hill which I expected might roll down upon 
me. I had no sooner stepped down upon the firm ground 
than I plainly saw it was a terrible earthquake ; for the 
ground I stood on shook three times at about eight minutes' 
distance, with three such shocks as would have overturned 
the strongest building that could be supposed to have stood 
on the earth ; and a great piece of the top of a rock, which 
stood about half a mile from me, next the sea, fell down 
with such a terrible noise as I never heard in all my life. I 
perceived also that the very sea was put into a violent 
motion by it ; and I believe the shocks were stronger under 
the water than on the island. 

1 was so much amazed with the thing itself (having never 
felt the like, nor discoursed with any one that had) that I 
was like one dead or stupefied; and the motion of the 
earth made my stomach sick, like one that was tossed at 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 59 

sea. But the noise of the falling of the rock awaked me, as 
it were ; and rousing me from the stupefied condition I was 
in, filled me with horror, and I thought of nothing but the 
hill falling upon my tent and my household goods, and 
burying all at once ; this sunk my very soul within me a 
second time. 

After the third shock was over, and I felt no more for 
some time, I began to take courage ; yet I had not heart 
enough to go over my wall again, for fear of being buried 
alive ; but sat still upon the ground greatly cast down, and 
disconsolate, not knowing what to do. All this while I had 
not the least serious religious thought; nothing but the 
common Lord^ have mercy upon me ! and when it was over 
that went away too. 

While I sat thus, I found the air overcast, and grow 
cloudy, as if it would rain ; and soon after the wind rose by 
little and little, so that in less than half-an-hour it blew a 
most dreadful hurricane : the sea was, all on a sudden, 
covered with foam and froth ; the shore was covered with a 
breach of the water ; the trees were torn up by the roots \ 
and a terrible storm it was. This held about three hours, 
and then began to abate ; and in two hours more it was 
quite* calm, and began to rain very hard. 

All this while I sat upon the ground, very much terrified 
and dejected ; when, on a sudden, it came into my thoughts 
that these winds and rain being the consequence of the 
earthquake, the earthquake itself was spent and over, and 
I might venture into my cave again. With this thought 
my spirits began to revive; and the rain also helping to 
persuade me, I went in, and sat down in my tent ; but 
the rain was so violent, that my tent was ready to be beaten 
down with it ; and 1 was forced to get into my cave, though 
very much afraid and uneasy, for fear it should fall on my 
head. 

This violent rain forced me to a new work, viz., to cut a 
hole through my new fortification, like a sink, to let the 
water go out, which would have else drowned my cave. 
After I had been in my cave for some time, and found no 
more shocks of the earthquake follow, I began to be more 
composed. And now, to support my spirits, which indeed 



6o ADVENTURES OF 

wanted it very much, I went to my little store, and took a 
small cup of rum ; which, however, I did then, and always, 
very sparingly, knowing I could have no more when that 
was gone. It continued raining all that night, and great 
part of the next day, so that I could not stir abroad ; but 
my mind being more composed, I began to think of what I 
had best do — concluding, that if the island was subject to 
these earthquakes, there would be no living for me in a cave, 
but I must consider of building me some little hut in an 
open place, which I might surround with a wall, as I had 
done here, and so make myself secure from wild beasts or 
men : for if I stayed where I was, I should certainly, one 
time or other, be buried alive. 

April 22. I now began to consider of means to put this 
measure into execution ; but I was at a great loss about the 
tools. I had three large axes, and abundance of hatchets 
(for we carried the hatchets for traffic with the Indians) ; 
but with much chopping and cutting knotty hard wood, 
they were all full of notches, and dull ; and though I had a 
grindstone, I could net turn it and grind my tools too. 
This caused me as much thought as a statesman would have 
bestowed upon a grand point of politics, or a judge upon 
the life and death of a man. At length I contrived a wheel 
with a string, to turn it with my foot, that I might have both 
my hands at liberty. 

Note. I had never seen any such thing in England, or 
at least not to take notice how it was done, though since I 
have observed it is very common there : besides that, my 
grindstone was very large and heavy. This machine cost 
me a full week's work to bring it to perfection. 

April 28, 29. These two whole days I took up in 
grinding my tools, my machine for turning my grindstone 
performing very well. 

April 30. Having perceived that my bread had been 
low a great while, I now took a survey of it, and reduced 
myself to one biscuit-cake a day, which made my heart 
very heavy. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 6 1 



Xt-^GOOD AND BAD FORTUNE. 

I. The Wreck Ashore. — In the morning of May 

I St, looking towards the seaside, the tide being low, I saw 

something lie on the shore bigger than ordinary, and it 

looked like a cask. When I came to it, I found a small 

barrel, and two or three pieces of the wreck of the ship, 

which were driven on shore by the late hurricane; and 

looking towards the wreck itself, I thought it seemed to lie 

higher out of the water than it used to do. I examined the 

barrel that was driven on shore, and soon found it was a 

banel of gunpowder; but it had taken water, and the powder 

was caked as hard as a stone : however, I rolled it farther on 

the shore for the present, and went on upon the sands, as 

near as I could to the wreck of the ship, to look for more. 

When I came down to the ship, I found it strangely 
removed. The forecastle, which lay before buried in the 
sand, was heaved up at least six feet : and the stem (which 
was broke to pieces, and parted from the rest, by the force 
of the sea, soon after I had left rummaging of her) was tossed, 
as it were, up, and cast on one side; and the sand was 
thrown so high on that side next her stern, that whereas there 
was a great piece of water before, so that I could not come 
within a quarter of a mile of the wreck without swimming, 
I could now walk quite up to her when the tide was out. 
I was surprised with this at first, but soon concluded it must 
be done by the earthquake ; and as by this violence the ship 
was more broken open than formerly, so many things came 
daily on shore, which the sea had loosened, and which the 
winds and water rolled by degrees to the land. 

This wholly diverted my thoughts from the design of 
removing my habitation ; and I busied myself mightily, that 
day especially, in searching whether I could make my way 
into the ship : but I found nothing was to be expected of 
that kind, for all the inside of the ship was choked up 
with sand. However, as I had learned not to despair of 
anything, I resolved to pull every thing to pieces that I could 
of the ship, concluding that every thing I could get from 
her would be of some use or other to me. 



62 ADVENTURES OF 

May 24. Every day, to this day, I worked on the wrecl 
and with hard labour I loosened some things so much wi 
the crow, that the first blowing tide several casks floated 01 
and two of the seamen's chests : but the wind blowing fro 
the shore, nothing came to land that day but pieces of timb< 
and a hogshead, which had some Brazil pork in it ; but tl 
salt water and the sand had spoiled it. I continued tli 
work every day to the 15 th of June, except the time nece 
sary to get food ; which I always appointed, during this pa 
of my employment, to be when the tide was up, that I mig 
be ready when it was ebbed out ; and by this time 1 had gott< 
timber, and plank, and iron work enough to have built 
good boat, if I had known how : and I also got, at sevei 
times, and in several pieces, near one hundred weight 
sheet-lead. 

June 16. Going down to the seaside, I found a lai) 
tortoise, or turtle. This was the first I had seen ; which, 
seems, was only my misfortune, not any defect of the plac 
or scarcity ; for had I happened to be on the other side 
the island, I might have had hundreds of them every day,; 
I found afterwards, but perhaps had paid dear enough^ f 
them. 

June 17. I spent in cooking the turtle. I found in h 
threescore eggs ; and her flesh was to me, at that time, tl 
most savoury and pleasant that I ever tasted in my lif 
having had no flesh, but of goats and fowls, since I landc 
in this horrid place. 

2. An Attack of Ague. — Rained all the next da; 
and I stayed within. I thought, at this time, the rain fc 
cold, and I was somewhat chilly ; which I knew was m 
usual in that latitude. 

June 19. Very ill, and shivering, as if the weather ha 
been cold. 

June 20. No rest all night ; violent pains in my hea< 
and feverish. 

June 21. Very ill ; frightened almost to death with tl 
apprehensions of my sad condition, to be sick, and no hel] 
Prayed to God, for the first time since the storm off Hul 
but scarce knew what I said, or why, my thoughts being a 
confused. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 63 

June 22. A little better, but under dreadful apprehen- 
sions of sickness. 

June 23. Very bad again : cold and shivering, and then 
a violent headache. 
June 24. Much better. 

June 25. An ague very violent : the fit held me seven 
hours ; cold fit, and hot, with faint sweats after it. 

June 26. Better ; and having no victuals to eat, took my 
gun, but found myself very weak : however, I killed a she- 
goat, and with much difficulty got it home, and broiled some 
of it^ and ate. I would fain have stewed it, and made some 
broth, but had no pot. 

June 27. The ague again so violent that I lay a-bed all 
day, and neither ate nor drank. I was ready to perish for 
thirst ; but so weak, I had not strength to stand up, or to 
get myself any water to drinL Prayed to God again, but 
was light-headed ; and when I was not, I was so ignorant 
that 1 knew not what to say : only lay and cried, Lord, look 
upon me ! Lord, pity me ! Lord, have mercy upon me ! I 
suppose I did nothing else for two or three hours ; till the 
fit wearing off, I fell asleep, and did not wake till far in the 
night. When I awoke, I found myself much refreshed, but 
veak, and exceeding thirsty : however, as I had no water in 
my whole habitation, I was forced to lie till morning, and 
went to sleep again. 

In this second sleep I had this terrible dream : I thought 
that I was sitting on the ground, on the outside of my 
wall, where I sat when the storm blew after the earth- 
quake, and that I saw a man descend from a great black 
cloud, in a bright flame of fire, and light upon the ground. 
He was all over as bright as a flame, so that I could but 
just bear to look towards him ; his countenance was most 
inexpressibly dreadful, impossible for words to describe : 
when he stepped upon the ground with his feet, I thought 
the earth trembled, just as it had done before in the 
earthquake; and all the air looked, to my apprehension, 
as if it had been filled with flashes of fire. He had no 
sooner landed upon the earth, but he moved forward to- 
wards me, with a long spear or weapon in his hand, to 
kill me ; and when he came to a rising ground, at some 



64 ADVENTURES OF 

distance, he spoke to me, or I heard a voice so terrible that 
it is impossible to express the terror of it All that I can 
say I understood was this: Seeing all these things have 
not brought thee to repentance, now thou shalt die; at 
which words, I thought he lifted up the spear that was in 
his hand, to kill me. 

No one that shall ever read this account will expect that 
I should be able to describe the horrors of my soul at this 
terrible vision ; I mean, that even while it was a dream, I 
even dreamed of those horrors ; nor is it any more possible 
to describe the impression that remained upon my mind 
when I awaked, and found it was but a dream. 

I had, alas ! no divine knowledge : what I had received 
by the good instruction of my father was then worn out, by 
an uninterrupted series, for eight years, of seafaring wicked- 
ness, and a constant conversation with none but such as 
were, like myself, wicked and profane to the last degree. 
I do not remember that I had, in all that time, one 
thought that so much as tended either to looking upward 
towards God, or inward towards a reflection upon my own 
ways ; but a certain stupidity of soul, without desire of good, 
or consciousness of evil, had entirely overwhelmed me ; and 
I was all that the most hardened, unthinking, wicked creature 
among our common sailors can be supposed to be; not 
having the least sense, either of the fear of God in danger, 
or of thankfulness to him in deliverances. 

3. Solemn Thoughts. — Having been somewhat re- 
freshed with the sleep I had had, and the fit being entirely 
off, I got up ; and though the fright and terror of my dream 
was very great, yet I considered that the fit of the ague 
would return again the next day, and now was my time to 
get something to refresh and support myself when I should 
be ill. The first thing I did was to fill a large square case- 
bottle with water, and set it upon my table, in reach of my 
bed ; and to take off the chill or aguish disposition of the 
water, I put about a quarter of a pint of rum into it, and 
mixed them together. Then I got me a piece of the goat's 
flesh, and broiled it on the coals, but could eat very litde. 
I walked about ; but was very weak, and withal very sad 
and heavy-hearted in the sense of my miserable concUtion, 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 65 

dreading the return of my distemper the next day. At 
night, I made my supper of three of the turtle's eggs, which 
I roasted in the ashes, and ate, as we call it, in the shell ; 
and this was the first bit of meat I had ever asked God's 
blessing to, as I could remember, in my whole life. After I 
had eaten, I tried to walk ; but found myself so weak, that 
I could hardly carry the gun (for I never went out without 
that) ; so I went but a little way, and sat down upon the 
ground, looking out upon the sea, which was just before me, 
and very calm and smooth. As I sat here, some such 
thoughts as these occurred to me : What is this earth and 
sea, of which I have seen so much ? Whence is it pro- 
duced ? And what am I, and all the other creatures, wild 
and tame, human and brutal ? Whence are we ? Surely, 
we are all made by some secret power, who formed the 
earth and sea, the air and sky. And who is that ? Then 
it followed most naturally, It is God that has made all. 
Well, but then, it came on, if God has made all these things, 
he guides and governs them all, and all things that concern 
them ; for the power that could make all things, must cer- 
tainly have power to guide and direct them If so, nothing 
can happen in the great circuit of his works, either without 
his knowledge or appointment. 

And if nothing happens without his knowledge, he 
knows that I am here, and am in this dreadful condition ; and 
if nothing happens without his appointment, he has ap- 
pointed all this to befall me. Nothing occurred to my 
thought, to contradict any of these conclusions ; and there- 
fore it rested upon me with the greatest force, that it must 
needs be that God had appointed all this to befall me ; that 
I was brought to this miserable circumstance by his direc- 
tion, he having the sole power, not of me only, but of 
everything that happens in the world. Immediately it 
followed, Why has God done this to me ? What have I 
done to be thus used? My conscience presently checked 
me in that inquiry, as if 1 had blasphemed, and methought 
it spoke to me like a voice : Wretch, dost thou ask what 
thou hast done? Look back upon a dreadful misspent 
life, and ask thyself what thou has not done ! Ask, why is it 
that thou wert not long ago destroyed ? Why wert thou not

ship was taken by the Sallee man-of-war ; or (kowned here^

tions, as one astonished, and had not a word to say — no, 
not to answer to myself; and, rising up pensive and sad, 
walked back to my retreat, and went over my wall, as if I 
had been going to bed. But my thoughts were sadly dis- 
turbed, and I had no inclination to sleep ; so I sat down in 
the chair, and lighted my lamp, for it began to be dark. 

4. A Double Cure. — Now, as the apprehension o! 
the return of my distemper terrified me very much, it 
occurred to my thought, that the Brazilians take no physic 
but their tobacco for almost all distempers ; and I had a 
piece of a roll of tobacco in one of the chests, which was 
quite cured ; and some also that was green, and not quite 
cured. I went, directed by Heaven, no doubt ; for in this 
chest I found a cure both for soul and body. I opened 
the chest, and found what I looked for, viz., the tobacco ; 
and as the few books I had saved lay there too, I took out 
one of the Bibles which I mentioned before, and which, to 
this time, I had not found leisure, or so much as inclination) 
to look into. I say, I took it out, and brought both that 
and the tobacco with me to the table. What use to make 
of the tobacco I knew not, as to my distemper, nor whether 
it was good for it or not ; but I tried several experiments 
with it, as if 1 was resolved it should hit one way or other. 
I first took a piece of a leaf, and chewed it in my mouth, 
which, indeed, at first, almost stupefied my brain, the 
tobacco being green and strong, and such as I had not 
been much used to. Then I took some and steeped it 
an hour or two in some rum, and resolved to take a 
dose of it when I lay down; and lastly, I burnt some 
upon a pan of coals, and held my nose close over the smoke 
of it as long as I could bear it, as well for the heat as 
almost for suffocation. 

In the interval of this operation, I took up the Bible, and 
began to read : but my head- was too much disturbed by the 
tobacco to bear reading, at least at that time ; only, having 
opened the book casually, the first words that occurred to 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 67 

me were these : " Call on me in the day of trouble, and I 
will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me." These words 
were very apt to my case, and maide some impression upon 
my thought at the time of reading them, though not so 
much as they did afterwards ; for, as for being delivered^ the 
word had no sound, as I may say, to me ; the thing was so 
remote, so impossible in my apprehension of things, that, as 
the children of Israel said when they were promised flesh to 
eat, " Can God spread a table in the wilderness ?" so I 
began to say. Can even God himself deliver me from this 
place ? And as it was not for many years that any hopes 
appeared, this prevailed very often upon my thoughts ; but, 
however, the words made a great impression upon me, and 
I mused upon them very often. 

It now grew late : and the tobacco had, as I said, dozed 
my head so much, that I inclined to sleep ; so I left my 
lamp burning in the cave, lest I should want anything 
in the night, and went to bed. But before I lay down, 
I did what I had never done in all my life : I kneeled 
down, and prayed to God to fulfil the promise to me, 
that if I called upon him in the day of trouble, he would 
deliver me. 

After my broken and imperfect prayer was over, I drank 
the rum in which I had steeped the tobacco ; which was so 
strong and rank of the tobacco, that indeed I could scarce 
get it down ; immediately upon this I went to bed. I found 
presently the rum flew up into my head violently ; but I fell 
into a sound sleep, and waked no more till, by the sun, it 
must necessarily be near three o'clock in the afternoon the 
next day ; nay, to this hour, I am partly of opinion, that I 
slept all the next day and night, and till almost three the 
day after ; for otherwise, I know not how I should lose a 
day out of my reckoning in the days of the week, as it 
appeared some years after I had done ; for if I had lost it by 
crossing and recrossing the Line,^ I should have lost more 
than one day ; but certainly I lost a day in my account, and 
never knew which way. Be that, however, one way or the 
other, when I awaked I found myself exceedingly refreshed, 
and my spirits lively and cheerful : when I got up I was 
stronger than I was the day before, and my stomach better,

for I was hungry ; and, in short, I had no fit the next day, 
but continued much altered for the better. 

July 3. I missed the fit for good and all, though I did 
not recover my full strength for some weeks aifter.

of the natives that visited that part 
of the island.

his reckoning here, for a day is not

mor« than 34 hours. 



Xll.— IMPORTANT DISCOVERIES. 

I. Survey of the Island. — It was on the 15th of July 
that I began to take a more particular survey of the island 
itself. I went up the creek first, where, as I hinted, I 
brought my rafts on shore. I found, after I came about 
two miles up, that the tide did not flow any higher ; and 
that it was no more than a little brook of running water, 
very fresh and good : but this being the dry season, there 
was hardly any water in some parts of it, at least not any 
stream. On the banks of this brook I found many pleasant 
savannahs or meadows, plain, smooth, and covered with 
grass ; and on the rising parts of them, next to the higher 
grounds (where the water, as it might be supposed, never 
overflowed), I found a great deal of tobacco, green, and 
growing to a very great and strong stalk : and there were 
divers other plants, which I had no knowledge of, or 
understanding about, and that might, perhaps, have virtues 
of their own, which I could not find out. I searched for the 
cassava root, which the Indians, in all that climate, make 
their bread of; but I could find none. I saw large plants 
of aloes, but did not understand them. I saw several sugar- 
canes, but wild ; and, for want of cultivation, imperfect I 
contented myself with these discoveries for this time ; and 
came back, musing with myself what course I might take to 
know the virtue and goodness of any of the fruits or plants 
which I should discover, but could bring it to no conclusion; 
for, in short, I had made so little observation while I was in 
the Brazils, that I knew little of the plants in the field ; at 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 69 

least, very little that might serve me to any purpose now in 
my distress. 

The next day, the i6th, I went up the same way again ; 
and after going something farther than I had gone the day 
before, I found the brook and the savannahs begin to cease, 
and the country become more woody than before. In this 
part I found different fruits ; and particularly I found 
melons upon the ground in great abundance, and grapes 
upon the trees : the vines, indeed, had spread over the trees, 
Mid the clusters of grapes were now just in their prime, very 
ripe and rich. This was a surprising discovery, and I was 
exceedingly glad of them, but I was warned by my ex- 
perience to eat sparingly of them — remembering that when 
I was ashore in Barbary, the eating of grapes killed several 
of our Englishmen, who were slaves there, by throwing them 
into fluxes^ and fevers. I found, however, an excellent use 
for these grapes ; and that was to cure or dry them in the 
sun, and keep them as dried grapes or raisins are kept; 
which I thought would be (as indeed they were) as whole- 
some and as agreeable to eat, when no grapes were to 
be had. 

I spent all that evening there, and went not back to my 
habitation ; which, by the way, was the first night, as I 
might say, I had lain from home. At night, I took my 
first contrivance, and got up into a tree, where I slept well ; 
and the next morning proceeded on my discovery, travelling 
near four miles, as I might judge by the length of the 
valley, keeping still due north, with a ridge of hills on the 
south and north sides of me. 

At the end of this march I came to an opening, where 
the country seemed to descend to the west ; and a little 
spring of fresh water, which issued out at the side of the 
hill by me, ran the other way, that is, due east ; and the 
country appeared so fresh, so green, so flourishing, every- 
thing being in a constant verdure, or flourish of spring, 
that it looked like a planted garden. I descended a little 
on the side of that delicious vale, surveying it with a secret 
kind of pleasure (though mixed with other afflicting 
thoughts), to think that this was all my own ; that I was king 
and lord of all this country indefeasibly,^ and had a right ot 



70 ADVENTURES OF 

possession ; and, if I could convey^ it, I might have it in 
inheritance as completely as any lord of a manor in England. 
I saw here abundance of cocoa-trees, and orange, lemon, and 
citron trees, but all wild, and very few bearing any firuit ; at 
least, not then. However, the green limes that I gathered 
were not only pleasant to eat, but very wholesome ; and I 
mixed their juice afterwards with water, which made it very 
wholesome, and very cool and refreshing. 

I found now I had business enough, to gather and carry 
home; and I resolved to lay up a store, as well of grapes as 
limes and lemons, to furnish myself for the wet season, which 
I knew was approaching. In order to this, I gathered a 
great heap of grapes in one place, a lesser heap in another 
place, and a great parcel of limes and lemons in another 
place ; and taking a few of each with me, I travelled home- 
wards, and resolved to come again, and bring a bag or sack, 
or what I could make, to carry the rest home. Accordingly, 
having spent three days in this journey, I came home (so I 
must call my tent and my cave) : but before 1 got thither, 
the grapes were spoiled ; the richness of the fruits, and the 
weight of the juice, having broken and bruised them, they 
were good for little or nothing : as to the limes, they were 
good, but I could bring only a few. 

The next day being the 19th, I went back, having made 
me two small bags to bring home my harvest ; but I was 
surprised when coming to my heap of grapes, which were so 
rich and fine when I gathered them, I found them all spread 
about, trod to pieces, and dragged about, some here, some 
there, and abundance eaten and devoured. By this I 
concluded there were some wild creatures thereabouts which 
had done this, but what they Were I knew not. However, 
as I found there was no laying them up in heaps, and no 
carrying them away in a sack ; but that one way they would 
be destroyed, and the other they would be crushed with 
their own weight, I took another course : I then gathered a 
large quantity of the grapes, and hung them upon the out- 
branches of the trees, that they might cure and dry in the 
sun; and as for the limes and lemons, I carried as many 
back as I could well stand under. 

2. Crusoe's Country House.— When I came home 



ROBINSON CRUSOB. 71 

from this journey, I contemplated with great pleasure the 
fhiitfiilness of that valley, and the pleasantness of the situa- 
tion ; the security from storms on that side ; the water and 
the wood ; and concluded that I had pitched upon a place 
to fix my abode in, which was by far the worst part of the 
country. Upon the whole, I began to consider of removing 
my habitation, and to look out for a place equally as safe as 
where I was now situate ; if possible, in that pleasant fruitful 
part of the island. 

This thought ran long in my head ; and I was exceeding 
fond of it for some time, the pleasantness of the place 
tempting me : but when I came to a nearer view of it, I 
considered that I was now by the seaside, where it was at 
least possible that something might happen to my advantage, 
and, by the same ill-fate that brought me hither, might 
bring some other unhappy wretches to the same place ; and 
though it was scarce probable that any such thing should 
happen, yet to enclose myself among the hills and woods in 
the centre of the island was to anticipate my bondage, and 
to render such an affair not only improbable, but impossible ; 
and that therefore I ought not by any means to remove. 
However, I was so enamoured of* this place, that I spent 
much of my time there for the whole remaining part of the 
month of July ; and though, upon second thoughts, I 
resolved, as above stated, not to remove, yet I built me a 
little kind of a bower, and surrounded it at a distance with 
a strong fence, being a double hedge, as high as I could 
reach, well staked, and filled between with brushwood. Here 
I lay very secure sometimes two or three nights together, 
always going over it with a ladder, as before : so that I 
fancied now I had my country and sea-coast house. This 
work took me up to the beginning of August. 

I had but newly finished my fence, and begun to enjoy my 
labour, when the rains came on, and made me stick close to 
my first habitation : for though I had made a tent like the 
other, with a piece of sail, and spread it very well, yet I had 
not the shelter of a hill to keep me from storms, nor a cave 
behind me to retreat into when the rains were extraordinary. 

About the beginning of August, as I said, I had finished 
my bower, and begun to enjoy myself. The 3rd of August 



72 ADVENTURES OF 

I found the grapes I had hung up were perfectly dried, an 
indeed were excellent good raisins of the sun ; so I bega 
to take them down from the trees ; and it was very happ 
that I did so, as the rains that followed would have spoUe 
them, and I should have lost the best part of my winter food 
for I had above two hundred large bunches of them. 

3. The Rainy Season. — No sooner had I taken th 
grapes all down, and carried most of them home to m 
cave, but it began to rain ; and from hence, which was th 
14th of August, it rained, more or less, every day till th 
middle of October, and sometimes so violently that I coul 
not stir out of my cave for several days. 

In this season I was much surprised with the increase c 
my family. I had been concerned for the loss of one of m 
cats, who ran away from me, or, as I thought, had bee 
dead ; and I heard no more of her till, to my astonishmen 
she came home with three kittens. From these three 
afterwards came to be so pestered with cats that I was force 
to kill them like vermin or wild beasts, and to drive thei 
from my house as much as possible. 

From the 14th of August to the 26th, incessant rain; s 
that I could not stir, and was now very careful not to b 
much wet. In this confinement I began to be straitene 
for food; but venturing out twice, I one day killed 
goat, and the last day, which was the 24th, found a vei 
large tortoise, which was a treat to me. My food was no 
regulated thus : I ate a bunch of raisins for my breakfast; 
piece of the goat's flesh, or of the turtle, broiled, for my dinni 
(for, to my great misfortune, I had no vessel to boil or ste 
anything); and two or three of the turtle's eggs for n 
supper. 

During this confinement in my cover from the rain, 
worked daily two or three hours at enlarging my cave ; ar 
by degrees worked it on towards one side, till I came to tl 
outside of the hill ; and made a door, or way out, whi< 
came beyond my fence or wall ; and so I came in ai 
out this way. But I was not perfectly easy at lying so opei 
for as I had managed myself before, I was in a perfe 
enclosure ; whereas now, I thought I lay exposed ; ai 
yet I could not perceive that there was any living thii 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 73 

to fear, the biggest creature that I had as yet seen upon 
the island being a goat. 

September 30. I was now come to the unhappy anni- 
versary of my landing; I cast up the notches on my 
post, and found I had been on shore three hundred 
and sixty-five days. I kept this day as a solemn fast, 
setting it apart for religious exercise, prostrating myself on 
the ground with the most serious humiliation, confessing 
^y sins to God, acknowledging his righteous judgments 
Upon me, and praying to him to have mercy on me ; and 
having not tasted the least refreshment for twelve hours, 
even till the going down of the sun, I then ate a biscuit and 
a bunch of grapes, and went to bed, finishing the day 
as I began it I had all this time observed no Sabbath day; 
for as at first I had no sense of religion upon my mind, 
I had, after some time, omitted to distinguish the weeks, by 
making a longer notch than ordinary for the Sabbath day, 
and so did not really know what any of the days were. But 
now having cast up the days, as above, I found I had been 
there a yezx ; so I divided it into weeks, and set apart every 
seventh day for a Sabbath : though I found at the end 
of my coimt,^ I had lost a day or two in my reckoning. A 
little after this, my ink beginning to fail me, I contented 
myself to use it more sparingly ; and to write down only the 
most remarkable events of my life, without continuing a 
daily memorandum of other things. 

The rainy season and the dry season began now to 
appear regular to me, and I learned to divide them so 
as to provide for them accordingly ; but I bought all my 
experience before I had it ; and what I am going to relate 
was one of the most discouraging experiments that I had 
made at all. 

4. Experience in Farming. — I have mentioned that 
I had saved a few ears of barley and rice, which I had so 
surprisingly found sprung up, as I thought, of themselves. 
I believe there were about thirty stalks of rice, and about 
twenty of barley ; and now I thought it a proper time to 
sow it after the rains ; the sun being in its southern position, 
going from me. Accordingly I dug a piece of ground, as 
well as I could, with my wooden spade ; and dividing it 



74 ADVENTURES OF 

into two parts, I sowed my grain ; but as I was sowii^, it 
casually occurred to my thoughts that I would not sow it 
all at first, because I did not know when was the proper 
time for it ; so I sowed about two-thirds of the seed, leaving 
about a handful of each : and it was a great comfort to me 
afterwards that I did so, for not one grain of what I sowed 
this time came to anything ; for the dry month following, 
and the earth having thus had no rain after the seed was 
sown, it had no moisture to assist its growth, and never 
came up at all till the wet season had come again, and then 
it grew as if it had been but newly sown. Finding my first 
seed did not grow, which I easily imagined was from the 
drought, I sought for a moister piece of ground to make 
another trial in ; and I dug up a piece of ground near my 
new bower, and sowed the rest of my seed in February, a 
little before the vernal equinox.^ This having the rainy 
months of March and April to water it, sprung up very 
pleasantly, and yielded a very good crop ; but having only 
part of the seed left, and not daring to sow all that I had, 
I got but a small quantity at last, my whole crop not amount- 
ing to above half a peck of each kind. But by this experi' 
ment I was made master of my business, and knew exactly 
when was the proper time to sow ; and that I might expect 
two seed-times, and two harvests, every year. 

While this corn was growing, I made a little discovery, 
which was of use to me afterwards. As soon as the rains 
were over, and the weather began to settle, which was 
about the month of November, I made a visit up the countr3r 
to my bower; where, though I had not been for some 
months, yet I found all things just as I had left them. The 
circle or double hedge that I had made was not only firm 
and entire, but the stakes which I had cut out of some 
trees that grew thereabouts were all shot out and grown 
with long branches, as much as a willow- tree usually shoots 
the first year after lopping its head ; but I could not tell 
what tree to call it that these stakes were cut from. I was 
surprised, and yet very well pleased, to see the young trees 
grow I and I pruned them, and led them to grow as much 
alike as I could : and it is scarce credible how beautiful a 
figure they grew into in three years ; so that though the 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 



75 



hedge made a circle of about twenty-live yards in diameter, 
yet the trees, for such I might now call them, soon covered 
it, and it was a complete shade, sufficient to lodge under 
all the dry season. This made me resolve to cut some 
more stakes, and make me a hedge like this, in a semi- 
circle round my wall (I mean that of my first dwelling), 
which I did ; and placing the trees or stakes in a double 
row, at about eight yards' distance from my first fence, they 
^ew presently ; and were at first a fine cover to my habita- 
tion, and afterwards served for a defence also, as I shall 
observe in its order.

yill.-^FURTHER ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE 

ISLAND. 

I. Two Seasons. — I found now that the seasons of the 
year might generally be divided, not into summer and 
winter as in Europe, but into the rainy seasons and the dry 
seasons, which were generally thus : From the middle of 
February to the middle of April, rainy ; the sun being then 
on or near the equinox. From the middle of April till the 
Jniddle of August, dry ; the sun being then north of the 
Line. From the middle of August till the middle of 
October, rainy ; the sun being then come back to the Line.* 
From the middle of October till the middle of February, 
dry ; the sun being then to the south of the Line. 

The rainy seasons held sometimes longer and sometimes 
shorter, as the winds happened to blow ; but this was the 
general observation I made. After I had found, by expe- 
rience, the ill consequences of being abroad in the rain, I 
took care to furnish myself with provisions beforehand, that 
I might not be obliged to go out ; and I sat within doors as 
much as possible during the wet months. 
a. Useful Occupation- — During the rainy season I 



76 ADVBNTURXS OF 

found much employment, and very suitable also to the 
time ; for I found great occasion for many things which I 
had no way to furnish myself with but by hard labour and 
constant application : particularly, I tried many ways to 
make myself a basket ; but all the twigs I could get for the 
purpose proved so brittle that they would do nothing. It 
proved of excellent advantage to me now, that when I was 
a boy, I used to take great delight in standing at a basket- 
maker's in the town where my father lived, to see them 
make their wicker-ware ; and being, as boys usually are, 
very officious to help, and a great observer of the manner 
how they worked those things, and sometimes lending a 
hand, I had by these means full knowledge of the methods 
of it, so that I wanted nothing but the materials ; when it 
came into my mind, that the twigs of that tree from whence 
I cut my stakes that grew might possibly be as tough as the 
sallows, willows, and osiers in England ; and I resolved to try. 
Accordingly, the next day, I went to my country-house, as 
I called it ; and cutting some of the smaller twigs, I found 
them to my purpose as much as I could desire : whereupon 
I came the next time prepared with a hatchet to cut down 
a quantity, which I soon found, for there was great plenty 
of them. These I set up to dry within my circle or hedge : 
and when they were fit for use, I carried them to my cave : 
and here, during the next season, I employed myself in 
making, as well as I could, several baskets ; both to carry 
earth, or to carry or lay up anything as I had occasion for. 
Though I did not finish them very handsomely, yet I made 
them sufficiently serviceable for my purpose : and thus, 
afterwards, I took care never to be without them ; and as 
my wicker-ware decayed, I made more ; especially strong 
deep baskets, to place my corn in, instead of sacks, when I 
should come to have any quantity of it. 

Having mastered this difficulty, and employed a world of 
time about it, I bestirred myself to see, if possible, how to 
supply two other wants. I had no vessel to hold anything 
that was liquid, except two runlets, which were almost full 
of rum ; and some glass bottles, some of the common size, 
and others (which were case bottles) square, for the holding 
of waters, spirits, &c. I had not so much as a pot to 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 77 

boil anything; except a great kettle, which I saved out 
of the ship, and which was too big for such use as I 
desired it, viz., to make broth, and stew a bit of meat by 
itself. The second thing I would fain have had, was a 
tobacco-pipe ; but it was impossible for me to make one ; 
however, I found a contrivance for that too at last. I em- 
ployed myself in planting my second row of stakes or piles, 
and also in this wicker-working all the summer or dry 
season ; when another business took me up more time than 
it could be imagined I could spare. 

3. On a Tour, — I mentioned before, that I had a great 
mind to see the whole island ; and that I had travelled up 
the brook, and so on to where I had built my bower, and 
where I had an opening quite to the sea, on the other side 
of the island. I now resolved to travel quite across to the 
seashore, on that side ; so taking my gun, a hatchet, and my 
dog, and a larger quantity of powder and shot than usual, 
with two biscuit-cakes and a great bunch of raisins in my 
pouch, for my store, I began my journey. When I had 
passed the vale where my bower stood, as above, I came 
within view of the sea, to the west ; and it being a very clear 
day, I fairly descried land, whether an island or continent I 
could not tell ; but it lay very high, extending from W. to 
W.S.W. at a very great distance ; by my guess, it could not 
be less than fifteen or twenty leagues off. 

I could not tell what part of the world this might be ; 
otherwise than that I knew it must be part of America ; and, 
as I concluded, by all my observations, must be near the 
Spanish dominions ; and perhaps was all inhabited by 
savages, where, if I should have landed, I had been in a 
worse condition than I was now. I therefore acquiesced^ in 
the dispositions of Providence, which I began now to own 
and to believe ordered everything for the best; I say, I 
quieted my mind with this, and left off afflicting myself with 
fruitless wishes of being there. 

With these considerations, walking very leisurely forward, 
I found this side of the island, where I now was, much 
pleasanter than mine ; the open or savannah fields sweetly 
adorned with flowers and grass, and full of very fine woods. 
I saw abundance of parrots ; and fain would have caught 



78 ADVENTURES OF 

one, if possible, to have kept it to be tame, and taught it to 
speak to me. I did, after taking some pains, catch a young 
parrot; for I knocked it down with a stick, and, having 
recovered it, I brought it home; but it was some years 
before I could make him speak ; however, at last I taught 
him to call me by my name very familiarly. But the accident 
that followed, though it be a trifle, will be very diverting 
in its place. 

I was exceedingly amused with this journey. I found in 
the low grounds hares, as I thought them to be, and foxes : 
but they differed greatly from all the other kinds I had met 
with ; nor could I satisfy myself to eat them, though I killed 
several. But I had no need to be venturous : for I had no 
want of food, and of that which was very good too, especi- 
ally these three sorts, viz. goats, pigeons, and turtle, or 
tortoise. With these, added to my grapes, Leadenhall 
Market could not have furnished a table better than I, in 
proportion to the company ; and though my case was 
deplorable enough, yet | had great cause for thankfulness, 
as I was not driven to any extremities for food, but had 
rather plenty, even to dainties. 

I never travelled on this journey above two miles outright 
in a day, or thereabout ; but I took so many turns and 
returns to see what discoveries I could make, that I came 
weary enough to the place where I resolved to sit down for 
the night ; and then I either reposed myself in a tree, or 
surrounded myself with a row of stakes, set upright in the 
ground, either from one tree to another, or so as no wild 
creature could come at me without waking me. 

As soon as I came to the seashore, I was surprised to see 
that I had taken up my lot on the worst side of the island ; 
for here indeed the shore was covered with innumerable 
turtles ; whereas, on the other side, I had found but three 
in a year and a half. Here was also an infinite number of 
fowls of many kinds, some of which I had seen, and some 
of which I had not seen before, and many of them were very 
good meat ; but such as I knew not the names of, except 
those called penguins. 

I could have shot as many as I pleased, but was very 
sparing of my powder and shot ; and therefore had moie 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 79 

mind to kill a she-goat, if I could, which I could better feed 
on. But, though there were many goats here, more than on 
my side the island, yet it was with much more difficulty 
that I could come near them ; the country being flat and 
even, and they saw me much sooner than when I was upon 
ahilL 

I confess this side of the country was much pleasanter 
than mine ; yet I had not the least inclination to remove ; 
for as I was fixed in my habitation, it became natural to me, 
and I seemed all the while I was here to be as it were upon 
a journey, and from home. However, I travelled along the 
seashore towards the east, I suppose about twelve miles; and 
then setting up a great pole upon the shore for a mark, I 
concluded I would go home again; and that the next 
journey I took should be on the other side of the island, 
east from my dwelling, and so round till I came to my post 
again : of which in its place. 

4. On the Way Back. — I took another way to come 
back than that I went, thinking I could easily keep so much of 
Uie island in my view, that I could not miss my first dwell- 
ing by viewing the country : but I found myself mistaken ; 
for being come out about two or three miles, I found myself 
descended into a very large valley, but so surrounded with 
hills, and those hills covered with wood, that I could not see 
which was my way by any direction but that of the sun, nor 
even then, unless I knew very well the position of the sun at 
that time of the day. And it happened to my farther mis- 
fortune, that the weather proved hazy for three or four 
days while I was iii this valley ; and not being able to see 
the sun, I wandered about very uncomfortable, and at 
last was obliged to find out the seaside, look for my post, 
and come back the same way I went ; and then by easy 
journeys I turned homeward, the weather being exceeding 
hot, and my gun, ammunition^ hatchet, and other things 
very heavy. 

In this journey my dog surprised a young kid, and seized 
upon it ; and running to take hold of it, I caught it, and 
saved it alive from the dog. I had a great mind to bring 
it home if I could ; for I had often been musing whether it 
might not be possible to get a kid or two, and so raise a 



8o ADVENTURES OF 

breed of tame goats, which might supply me when my 
powder and shot should be all spent. I made a collar for 
this little creature, and with a string which I had made of 
some rope-yam, which I always carried about me, I led him 
along, though with some difficulty, till I came to my bower, 
and there I enclosed him and left him ; for I was very im- 
patient to be at home, from whence I had been absent above 
a month. 

I cannot express what a satisfaction it was to me to come 
into my old hutch, and lie down in my hammock bed. This 
little wandering journey, without a settled place of abode, 
had been so unpleasant to me, that my own house, as I 
called it to myself, was a perfect settlement to me, compared 
to that ; and it rendered everything about me so comfortable 
that I resolved I would never go a great way from it again, 
while it should be my lot to stay on the island. 

I reposed myself here a week to rest and regale myself 
after my long journey, during which most of the time was 
taken up in the weighty affair of making a cage for my Poll, 
who began now to be more domestic, and to be mighty well 
acquainted with me. Then I began to think of the poor 
kid which I had penned within my little circle, and resolved 
to fetch it home, or give it some food : accordingly I went, 
and found it where I left it (for indeed it could not get out), 
but was almost starved for want of food. I went and cut 
boughs of trees, and branches of such shrubs as I could 
find, and threw it over, and having fed it, I tied it as I did 
before, to lead it away ; but it was so tame with being 
hungry that I had no need to have tied it, for it followed me 
like a dog : and as I continually fed it, the creature became 
so loving, so gentle, and so fond, that it was from that time 
one of my domestics also, and would never leave me 
afterwards. 

5. Close of the Second Year.—The rainy season of 
the autumnal equinox was now come, and I kept the 30th 
of September in the same solemn manner as before, being 
the anniversary of my landing on the island ; having now 
been there two years, and no more prospect of being deli- 
vered than the first day I came there. I spent the whole 
day in humble and thankful acknowledgments for the many 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 8 1 

wonderful mercies which my solitary condition was attended 
with, and without which it might have been infinitely more 
miserable. I gave humble and hearty thanks to God for 
having been pleased to discover to me, that it was possible 
I might be more happy even in this solitary condition than 
I should have been in the enjoyment of society, and in all 
the pleasures of the world ; that he could fully make up to 
me the deficiencies of my solitary state, and the want of 
human society, by his presence, and the communications of 
his grace to my soul; supporting, comforting, and encourag- 
ing me to depend upon his providence here, and to hope for 
his eternal presence hereafter. 

It was now that I began sensibly to feeF how much more 
happy the life I now led was, with all its miserable circum- 
stances, than the wicked, cursed, abominable life I led all the 
past part of my days : and now I changed both my sorrows 
and my joys, my very desires altered, my affections changed 
their gusts, and my delights were perfectly new from what 
they were, at my first coming, or indeed for the two years 
past. Before, as I walked about, either on my hunting or 
for viewing the country, the anguish of my soul at my con- 
dition would break out upon me on a sudden, and my very 
heart would die within me, to think of the woods, the 
mountains, the deserts I was in, and how I was a prisoner, 
locked up with the eternal bars and bolts of the ocean, in an 
uninhabited wilderness, without redemption.'* In the midst 
of the greatest composures of my mind, this would break 
out upon me like a storm, and make me wring my hands 
and weep like a child. Sometimes it would take me in the 
middle of my work, and I would immediately sit down and 
sigh, and look upon the ground for an hour or two together. 
This was still worse to me ; but if I could burst into tears, 
or give vent to my feelings by words, it would go off ; and 
my grief being exhausted, would abate. 

But now I began to exercise myself with new thoughts ; 
I daily read the Word of God, and applied all the comforts 
of it to my present state. One morning, being very sad, I 
opened the Bible upon these words, *' I will never leave 
thee, nor forsake thee : " immediately it occurred that these 
words were to me ; why else should they be directed in 

F

such a manner, just at the moment when I was mourning 
over my condition, as one forsaken by God and man ? Well 
then, said I, if God does not forsake me, of what ill con- 
sequence can it be, or what matters it, though the world 
should forsake me ; seeing, on the other hand, if I had all 
the world, and should lose the favour and blessing of God, 
there would be no comparison in the loss ?

XIY.— ROBINSON'S OCCUPATIONS. 

I. A Busy Worker.— Thus, and in this disposition 
of mind, I began my third year ; and though I have not 
given the reader the trouble of so particular an account of 
my works this year as the first, yet in general it may be 
observed, that I was very seldom idle ; but having regularly 
divided my time, according to the several daily em- 
ployments that were before me ; such as, first, my duty to 
God, and the reading the Scriptures, which I constantly set 
apart some time for, thrice every day: secondly, going 
abroad with my gun for food, which generally took me up 
three hours every morning, when it did not rain : thirdly, 
ordering, curing, preserving, and cooking what I had killed 
or catched for my supply ; these took up great part of the 
day. Also it is to be considered, that in the middle of the 
day, when the sun was in the zenith,^ the violence of the 
heat was too great to stir out ; so that about four hours in 
the evening was all the time I could be supposed to work 
in; with this exception, that sometimes I changed my 
hours of hunting and working, and went to work in the 
morning, and abroad with my gun in the afternoon. 

To this short time allowed for labour, I desire may 
be added the exceeding laboriousness of my work; the 
many hours which, for want of tools, want of help, and 



ROBINSON CRUSOE, 83 

want of skill, everything I did took up out of my time : for 
example, I was full two-and-forty days making me a board 
for a long shelf, which I wanted in my cave ; whereas, two 
sawyers, with their tools and a sawpit, would have cut six 
of them out of the same tree in half a day. 

My case was this : it was a large tree that was to be cut 
down, because my board was to be a broad one. This tree 
I was three days cutting down, and two more in cutting off 
the boughs, and reducing it to a log, or piece of timber. 
With inexpressible^ hacking and hewing, I reduced both the 
sides of it into chips, till it was light enough to move ; then 
I turned it, and made one side of it smooth and fiat as a 
board, from end to end ; then turning that side downward, 
cut the other side, till I brought the plank to be about 
three inches thick, and smooth on both sides. Any one 
may judge the labour of my hands in such a piece of work ; 
but labour and patience carried me through that, and many 
other things : I only observe this in particular, to show the 
reason why so much of my time went away with so little 
work, viz. that what might be a little to be done with help 
and tools, was a vast labour, and required a prodigious time 
to do alone, and by hand. Notwithstanding this, with 
patience and labour I went through many things ; and, 
indeed, everything that my circumstances made necessary 
for me to do, as will appear by what follows. 

2. Farming Operations. — I was now in the months 
of November and December, expecting my crop of barley 
and rice. The ground I had manured or dug up for them 
was not great ; for, as I observed, my seed of each was not 
above the quantity of half a peck, having lost one whole 
crop by sowing in the dry season : but now my crop 
promised very- well ; when, on a sudden, I found I was in 
danger of losing it all again by enemies of several sorts, 
which it was scarce possible to keep from it ; as, first, the 
goats, and wild creatures which I called hares, who, tasting 
the sweetness of the blade, lay in it night and day, as soon 
as it came up, and ate it so close, that it could get no time 
to shoot up into stalk. 

I saw no remedy for this, but by making an enclosure 
about it with a hedge, which I did with a great deal of toil ; 



84 ADVENTURES OF 

and the more, because it required speed. However, as my 
arable^ land was but small, suited to my crop, I got it 
tolerably well fenced in about three weeks' time ; and 
shooting some of the creatures in the daytime, I set my 
dog to guard it in the night, tying him up to a stake at the 
gate, where he would stand and bark all night long; so in 
a little time the enemies forsook the place, and the corn 
grew very strong and well, and began to ripen apace. 

But as the beasts ruined me before, while my corn was in 
the blade, so the birds were as likely to ruin me now, when 
it was in the ear ; for going along by the place to see how it 
throve, I saw my little crop surrounded with fowls, I know 
not of how many sorts, who stood, as it were, watching till 
I should be gone. I immediately let fly among them (for I 
always had my gun with me) ; I had no sooner shot, but 
there rose up a little crowd of fowls, which I had not seen 
at all, from among the corn itself. 

This touched me sensibly, for I foresaw that in a few days 
they would devour all my hopes ; that I should be starved, 
and never be able to raise a crop at all ; and what to do I 
could not tell : however, I resolved not to lose my corn, if 
possible, though I should watch it night and day. In the 
first place, I went among it to see what damage was already 
done, and found they had spoiled a good deal of it ; but 
that as it was yet too green for them, the loss was not so 
great, but that the remainder was likely to be a good crop, 
if it could be saved. 

I stayed by it to load my gun, and then coming away, I 
could easily see the thieves sitting upon al Ithe trees about 
me, as if they only waited till I was gone away ; and the 
event proved it to be so : for as I walked off, as if gone, I 
was no sooner out of their sight, than they dropped down, 
one by one, into the corn again. I was so provoked, that I 
could not have patience to stay till more came on, knowing 
that every grain they ate now was, as it might be said, a 
peck loaf to me in the consequence ; so coming up to the 
hedge, I fired again, and killed three of them. This was 
what I wished for ; so I took them up, and served them 
as we serve notorious thieves^ in England, viz. hanged them 
in chains, for a terror to others. It is impossible to 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 85 

imagine that this should have such an efifect as it had ; for 
the fowls not only never came to the corn, but, in short, they 
forsook all that part of the island, and I could never see a 
bird near the place as long as my scarecrows hung there. 
This I was very glad .of, you may be sure ; and about the 
latter end of December, which was our second harvest of 
the year, I reaped my com. 

I was sadly put to it for a scythe or sickle to cut it down 
and all I could do was to make one as well as I could, out 
of one of the broad swords, or cutlasses, which I saved 
among the arms out of the ship. However, as my first 
crop was but small, I had no great difficulty to cut it down : 
in short, I reaped it my way, for I cut nothing off but the 
ears, and carried it away in a great basket which I had made, 
and so rubbed it out with my hands ; and at the end of all 
my harvesting. I found that out of my half peck of seed I 
had near two bushels of rice, and above two bushels and a 
half of barley ; that is to say, by my guess, for I had no 
measure. 

However, this was great encouragement to me ; and I 
foresaw that, in time, it would please God to supply me 
with bread; and yet here I was perplexed again; for I 
neither knew how to grind, or make meal of my corn, or 
indeed how to clean it and part it ; nor if made into meal, 
how to make bread of it ; and if how to make it, yet I 
knew not how to bake it : these things being added to my 
desire of having a good quantity for store, and to secure a 
constant supply, I resolved not to taste any of this crop, 
but to preserve it all for seed against the next season ; and, 
in the meantime, to employ all my study and hours of 
working to accomplish this great work of providing myself 
with corn and bread. 

3. Numerous Wants.— It might be truly said, that 
now I worked for my bread. It is a little wonderful, and 
what I believe few people have thought much upon, viz. the 
strange multitude of little things necessary in the providing, 
producing, curing, dressing, making, and finishing this one 
article of bread, I, that was reduced to a mere state of nature, 
found this to my daily discouragement, and was made more 
sensible of it every hour, even after I had got the first 



S6 ADVENTURES OF 

handful of seed-corn, which, as I have said, came up unex- 
pectedly, and indeed to a surprise. 

First, I had no plough to turn up the earth ; no spade or 
shovel to dig it : well, this I conquered, by making a 
wooden spade, as I observed before ; but this did my work 
in but a wooden manner ; and though it cost me a great 
many days to make it, yet, for want of iron, it not only wore 
out the sooner, but made my work the harder, and per- 
formed it much worse. However, this I bore with, and was 
content to work it out with patience, and bear with the 
badness of the performance. When the corn was sown, I 
had no harrow, but was forced to go over it myself, and 
drag a great heavy bough of a tree over it, to scratch it, as 
it may be called, rather than rake or harrow it. 

When it was growing and grown, I have observed already 
how many things I wanted to fence it, secure it, mow or 
reap it, cure and carry it home, thresh, part it from the 
chaff, and save it : then I wanted a mill to grind it, sieves 
to dress it : yeast and salt to make it into bread, and an 
oven to bake it ; and yet all these things I did without, as 
shall be observed ; and the corn was an inestimable comfort 
and advantage to me. All this, as I said, made everything 
laborious and tedious to me, but that there was no help for ; 
neither was my time so much loss to me, because, as I had 
divided it, a certain part of it was every day appointed to 
these works ; and as I resolved to use none of the corn for 
bread till I had a greater quantity by me, I had the next 
six months to apply myself wholly, by labour and invention, 
to furnish myself with utensils proper for the performing all 
the operations necessary for making corn fit for my use. 

But now I was to prepare more land ; for I had seed 
enough to sow above an acre of ground. Before I did 
this, I had a week's work at least to make me a spade ; 
which, when it was done, was but a sorry one indeed, and 
very heavy, and required double labour to work with it. 
However, I went through that, and sowed my seed in two 
large flat pieces of ground, as near my house as I could find 
theni to my mind, and fenced them in with a good hedge ; 
the stakes of which were all cut off" that wood which I had 
set before, and knew it would grow ; so that, in one year's 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 



87 



time, I knew I should have a quick or living hedge, that 
would want but little repair. This work took me up full 
three months ; because a great part of the time was in the 
wet season, when I could not go abroad.

XY.— NECESSITY THE MOTHER OF 

INVENTION. 

I. Crusoe as a Potter. — Within doors, that is, when 
it rained, and I could not go out, I found employment on 
the following occasions ; always observing, that while I was 
at work, I diverted myself with talking to my parrot, and 
teaching him to speak ; and I quickly taught him to know 
his own name, and at last to speak it out pretty loud. Poll ; 
which was the first word I ever heard spoken in the island 
by any mouth but my own. This, therefore, was not my 
work, but an assistant to my work ; for now, as I said, I had 
a great employment upon my hands, as follows : I had long 
studied, by some means or other, to make myself some 
earthen vessels, which indeed I wanted much, but knew 
not where to come at them. However, considering the heat 
of the climate, I did not doubt but if I could find out any 
clay, I might botch up some such pot as might, being dried 
in the sun, be hard and strong enough to bear handling, 
and to hold anything that was dry, and required to be kept 
so ; and as this was necessary in the preparing corn, meal, &c., 
which was the thing I was upon, I resolved to make some 
as large as I could, and fit only to stand like jars, to hold 
what should be put into them. 

It would make the reader pity me, or rather laugh at me, 
to tell how many awkward ways I took to raise this pastil ;^ 
what odd, misshapen, ugly things I made; how many of 
them fell in, and how many fell out, the clay not being 
stiff enough to bear its own weight ; how many cracked by 
the over-violent heat of the sun, being set out too hastily ; 



S8 ADVENTURES OP 

and how many fell in pieces with only removing, as well 
before as after they were dried ; and, in a word, how, after 
having laboured hard to find the clay, to dig it, to temper 
it, to bring it home, and work it, I could not make above 
two large earthen ugly things (I cannot call them jars) in 
about two months' labour. 

However, as the sun baked these two very dry and hard, 
I lifted them very gently up, and set them down again in 
two great wicker baskets, which I had made on purpose for 
them, that they might not break ; and as between the pot 
and the basket there was a little room to spare, I stuffed it 
full of the lice and barley straw; and these two pots being 
to stand always dry, I thought would hold my dry corn, 
and perhaps the meal, when the corn was bruised. 

Though I miscarried so much in my design for large 
pots, yet I made several smaller things with better success ; 
such as little round pots, flat dishes, pitchers, and pipkins, 
and anything my hand turned to ; and the heat of the sun 
baked them very hard. 

But all this would not answer my end, which was to get 
an earthen pot to hold liquids, and bear the fire, which 
none of these could do. It happened some time after, 
making a pretty large fire for cooking my meat, when I went 
to put it out after I had done with it, I found a broken 
piece of one of my earthenware vessels in the fire, burnt as 
hard as a stone, and red as a tile. I was agreeably sur- 
prised to see it ; and said to myself, that certainly they 
might be made to burn whole, if they would bum broken. 

This set me to study how to order my fire, so as to make 
it burn some pots. I had no notion of a kiln, such as the 
potters burn in, or of glazing them with lead, though I had 
some lead to do it with ; but I placed three large pipkins 
and two or three pots in a pile, one upon another, and 
placed my fire-wood all round it, with a great heap of 
embers under them. I plied the fire with fresh fuel round 
the outside, and upon the top, till I saw the pots in the 
inside red-hot quite through, and observed that they did 
not crack at all. When I saw them clear red, I let them 
stand in that heat about five or six hours, till I found one ot 
them, though it did not crack, did melt or run ; for the 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 89 

sand which was mixed with the clay melted by the violence 

of the heat, and would have run into glass, if I had gone 

on ; SO I slacked my fire gradually, till the pots began to 

abate of the red colour ; and watching them all night, that 

I might not let the fire abate too fast, in the morning I had 

three very good, I will not say handsome, pipkins, and two 

other earthen pots, as hard burnt as could be desired ; and 

one of them perfectly glazed with the running of the sand. 

After this experiment, I need not say that I wanted ho 

sort of earthenware for my use : but I must needs say, as 

to the shapes of them, they were very indifferent, as any one 

may suppose, as I had no way of making them but as the 

children make dirt pies, or as a woman would make pies 

that never learned to raise paste. No joy at a thing of so 

mean a nature was ever equal to mine, when I found I had 

made an earthen pot that would bear the fire ; and I had 

hardly patience to stay till they were cold, before I set one 

on the fire again, with some water in it, to boil me some 

meat, which it did admirably well ; and with a piece of kid 

I made some very good broth ; though I wanted oatmeal, 

and several other ingredients requisite to make it so good 

as I would have had it. 

2. Crusoe as a Miller. — My next concern was to get 
a stone mortar^ to stamp or beat some corn in ; for as to the 
mill, there was no thought of arriving to that perfection of 
art with one pair of hands. To supply this want I was at 
a great loss ; for, of all trades in the world, I was as per- 
fectly unqualified for a stonecutter as for any whatever ; 
neither had I any tools to go about it with. I spent many 
a day to find out a great stone big enough to cut hollow, 
and make fit for a mortar; but could find none at all, 
except what was in the solid rock, and which I had no way 
to dig or cut out ; nor, indeed, were the rocks in the island 
of sufficient hardness, as they were all of a sandy crumbling 
stone, which would neither bear the weight of a heavy 
pestle,^ nor would break the corn without filling it with sand : 
so, after a great deal of time lost in searching for a stone, I 
gave it over, and resolved to look out a great block of hard 
wood, which I found indeed much easier ; and getting one 
as big as I had strength to stir, I rounded it, and formed it on 



90 ADVENTURKS OF 

the outside with my axe and hatchet ; and then, with the 
help of the fire, and infinite labour, made a hollow place in 
it, as the Indians in Brazil make their canoes. After this, 
I made a great heavy pestle, or beater, of the wood, called 
ironwood ; and this I prepared and laid by against I had 
my next crop of corn, when I proposed to myself to grind, 
or rather pound, my corn into meal, to make my bread. 

My next difficulty was to make a sieve, or search, to dress 
my meal, and to part it from the bran and the husk, without 
which I did not see it possible I could have any bread. 
This was a most difficult thing, even but to think on ; for 
I had nothing like the necessary thing to make it — I mean 
fine thin canvas or stuff, to search the meal through. Here 
I was at a full stop for many months ; nor did I really know 
what to do : linen I had none left, but what was mere rags ; 
I had goats' hair, but neither knew how to weave it nor 
spin it ; and had I known how, here were no tools to work 
it with. All the remedy I found for this was, at last 
recollecting I had, among the seamen's clothes which were 
saved out of the ship, some neckcloths of calico or muslin, 
with some pieces of these I made three small sieves, proper 
enough for the work ; and thus I made shift for some years : 
how I did afterwards, I shall show in its place. 

3. Crusoe as a Baker. — The baking part was the next 
thing to be considered, and how I should make bread when 
I came to have corn ; for, first, I had no yeast : as to that 
part, there was no supplying the want, so I did not concern 
myself much about it ; but for an oven I was indeed puzzled. 
At length I found out an expedient^ for that also, which was 
this : I made some earthen vessels, very broad, but not 
deep, that is to say, about two feet diameter, and not above 
nine inches deep : these I burned in the fire, as I had done 
the other, and laid them by ; and when I wanted to bake, 
I made a great fire upon my hearth, which I had paved 
with some square tiles, of my own making and burning also : 
but I should not call them square. When the firewood 
was burned into embers, or live coals, I drew them forward 
upon the hearth, so as to cover it all over, and there let 
them lie till the hearth was very hot : then sweeping away 
all the embers, I set down my loaf, or loaves, and covering 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 



91 



them with the earthen pot, drew the embers all round the 
outside of the pot, to keep in and add to the heat ; and 
thus, as well as in the best oven in the world, I baked my 
barley loaves, and became, in a little time, a good pastry- 
cook into the bargain ; for I made myself several cakes and 
puddings of the rice ; but made no pies, as I had nothing 
to put into them except the flesh of fowls or goats. 

4. Rich in Corn. — It need not be wondered at, if all 
these things took me up most part of the third year of my 
abode here ; for, it is to be observed, in the intervals of 
these things, I had my new harvest and husbandry^ to 
manage : I reaped my corn in its season, and carried it 
home as well as I could, and laid it up in the ear, in my 
large baskets, till I had time to rub it out ; for I had no 
floor to thresh it on, or instrument to thresh it with. 

And now, indeed, my stock of corn increasing, I really 
wanted to build my barns bigger : I wanted a place to lay 
it up in ; for the increase of the corn now yielded me so 
much, that I had of the barley about twenty bushels, and 
of rice as much, or more, insomuch that now I resolved to 
begin to use it freely ; for. my bread had been quite gone a 
great while. I resolved also to see what quantity would be 
sufficient for me a whole year, and to sow but once a year. 
Upon the whole, I found that the forty bushels of barley 
and rice were much more than I could consume in a year ; 
so I resolved to sow just the same quantity every year that 
I sowed the last, in hopes that such a quantity would fully 
provide me with bread, &c.

XVI.— FAILURES AND SUCCESSES. 

I. A Fruitless Attempt. — All the while these things 
were doing, you may be sure my thoughts ran many times 
upon the prospect of land which I had seen from the other 
side of the island ; and I was not without some secret 



92 ADVENTURES OF 

wishes that I was on shore there ; fancying, that seeing the 
main land, and an inhabited country, I might find some 
way or other to convey myself farther, and perhaps at last 
find some means of escape. 

Now I wished for my boy Xury, and the long-boat with 
the shoulder-of-mutton sail, with which I sailed above a 
thousand miles on the coast of Africa ; but this was in vain. 
Then I thought I would go and look at our ship's boat, which, 
as I have said, was blown up upon the shore a great way, in 
the storm, when we were first cast away. She lay nearly 
where she did at first, but not quite ; having turned, by the 
force of the waves and the winds, almost bottom upward, 
against a high ridge of beachy rough sand ; but no water 
about her, as before. If I had had hands to have refitted 
her, and to have launched her into the water, the boat 
would have done very well, and I might have gone back into 
the Brazils with her easily enough ; but I might have fore- 
seen that I could no more turn her and set her upright upon 
her bottom than I could remove the island. However, I went 
to the woods, and cut levers and rollers, and brought them to 
the boat, resolving to try what I could do — suggesting to 
myself, that if I could but turn her down, and repair the 
damage she had received, she would be a very good boat, 
and I might venture to sea in her. 

I spared no pains, indeed, in this piece of fruitless toil, 
and spent, I think, three or four weeks about it : at last, 
finding it impossible to heave her up with my little strength, 
I fell to digging away the sand, to undermine her, and so as 
to make her fall down, setting pieces of wood to thrust and 
guide her right in the fall. But when I had done this, I 
was unable to stir her up again, or to get under her, much 
less to move her forward towards the water ; so I was forced 
to give it over : and yet, though I gave over the hopes of the 
boat, my desire to venture over the main^ increased, rather 
than diminished, as the means for it seemed impossible. 

2. A Foolish Piece of Work. — At length, I began 
to think whether it was not possible to make myself a canoe, 
or periagua, such as the natives of those climates make, even 
without tools, or, as I might say, without hands,^ of the trunk 
of a great tree. This I not only thought possible, but easy, 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 93 

and pleased myself extremely with the idea of making it, 

and with my having much more convenience for it than any 

of the Negroes or Indians ; but not at all considering the 

particular inconveniences which I lay under more than the 

Indians did, viz., the want of hands to move it into the 

water when it was made, a difficulty much harder for me to 

surmount than all the consequences of want of tools could 

be to them. For what could it avail me, if, after I had chosen 

my tree, and with much trouble cut it down, and might be 

able with my tools to hew and dub out the inside into the 

proper shape of a boat, and burn or cut out the inside to 

make it hollow, so as to make a boat of it — if, after all this, 

I must leave it just where I found it, and was not able to 

launch it into the water ? 

One would imagine, if I had had the least reflection 
upon my mind of my circumstances while I was making 
this boat, I should have immediately thought how I was to 
get it into the sea ; but my thoughts were so intent upon my 
voyage in it, that I never once considered how I should get 
it off the land ; and it was really, in its own nature, more easy 
for me to guide it over forty-five miles of sea, than the forty- 
five fathoms of land, where it lay, to set it afloat in the water. 
I went to work upon this boat the most like a fool that 
ever man did, who had any of his senses awake. I pleased 
myself with the design, without determining whether I was 
able to undertake it ; not but that the difficulty of launching 
nay boat came often into my head ; but I put a stop to my 
own inquiries into it, by this foolish answer : Let us first 
make it ; I warrant I will find some way or other to get it 
along when it is done. 

This was a most preposterous method -^ but the eagerness 
of my fancy prevailed, and to work I went. I felled a cedar- 
tree, and I question much whether Solomon ever had such 
a one for the building of the Temple at Jerusalem ■; it was 
^y^ feet ten inches diameter at the lower part next the 
stump, and four feet eleven inches diameter at the end Oi 
twenty-two feet, where it lessened and then parted into 
branches. It was not without infinite labour that I felled this 
tree ; I was twenty days hacking and hewing at the bottom, 
and fourteen more getting the branches and limbs, and the 



94 ADVENTURES OF 

vast spreading head of it, cut oflf : after this, it cost me a 
month to shape it and dub it to a proportion, and to some- 
thing like the bottom of a boat, that it might swim upright as 
it ought to do. It cost me near three months more to clear 
the inside, and work it out so as to make an exact boat of 
it : this I did, indeed, without fire, by mere mallet and chisel, 
and by the dint of hard labour, till I had brought it to be a 
very handsome periagua, and big enough to have carried 
six-and-twenty men, and consequently big enough to have 
carried me and all my cargo. 

When I had gone through this work, I was extremely 
delighted with it. The boat was really much bigger than 
ever I saw a canoe or a periagua that was made of one tree, 
in my life. Many a weary stroke it had cost, you may be 
sure ; and there remained nothing but to get it into the 
water ; which, had I accomplished, I make no question but 
I should have begun the maddest voyage, and the most un- 
likely to be performed, that ever was undertaken. 

But all my devices to get it into the water failed me, 
though they cost me inexpressible labour too. It lay about 
one hundred yards from the water, and not more ; but the 
first inconvenience was, it was up hill towards the creek. 
Well, to take away this discouragement, I resolved to dig 
into the surface of the earth, and so make a declivity : this j 
I began, and it cost me a prodigious deal of pains ; but who 
grudge pains that have their deliverance in view ? When this 
was worked through, and this difficulty managed, it was 
still much the same, for I could no more stir the canoe than 
I could the other boat. Then I measured the distance of 
ground, and resolved to cut a dock, or canal, to bring the 
water up to the canoe, seeing I could not bring the canoe 
down to the water. Well, I began this work ; and when I 
began to enter upon it, and calculate how deep it was to be 
dug, how broad, how the stuff was to be thrown out, I found 
by the number of hands I had, having none but my own, 
that it must have been ten or twelve years before I could 
have gone through with it ; for the shore lay so high, that at 
the upper end it must have been at least twenty feet deep : 
this attempt, though with great reluctancy, I was at length 
obliged to give over also. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 9 

This grieved me heartily ; and now I saw, though too late, 
the folly of beginning a work before we count the cost, and 
before we judge rightly of our own strength to go through 
with it. 

3. Close of the Fourth Year. — In the middle of this 
work, I finished my fourth year in this place, and kept my 
anniversary with the same devotion, and with as much 
comfort as before. 

I had now been here so long, that many things which I 
brought on shore for my help were either quite gone, or 
very much wasted, and near spent. 

My ink, as I observed, had been gone for some time, all 
but a very little, which I eked out with water, a little and a 
little, till it was so pale, it scarce left any appearance of 
black upon the paper. As long as it lasted, I made use of it 
to minute down the days of the month on which any 
remarkable thing happened to me. 

The next thing to my ink being wasted, was that ot my 
bread, I mean the biscuit which I brought out of the ship : 
this I had husbanded to the last degree, allowing myself but 
one cake of bread a day for above a year ; and yet I was quite 
without bread for near a year before I got any corn of my 
own ; and great reason I had to be thankful that I had any 
at all, the getting it being, as has been already observed, 
next to miraculous. 

My clothes, too, began to decay mightily ; as to linen, I 

had none for a great while, except some chequered* shirts 

which I found in the chests of the other seamen, and which 

I carefully preserved, because many times I could bear no 

clothes on but a shirt, and it was a very great help to me 

that I had, among all the men's clothes of the ship, almost 

three dozen of shirts. There were also, indeed, several thick 

watchcoats of the seamen's which were left, but they were 

too hot to wear : and though it is true that the weather was 

so violently hot that there was no need of clothes, yet I 

could not go quite naked, no, though I had been inclined to 

it, which I was not, nor could I abide the thought of it, 

though I was all alone. The reason why I could not go 

quite naked was, I could not bear the heat of the sun so 

well when quite naked as with some clothes on ; nay, the 



96 ADVENTURES OF 

very heat frequently blistered my skin : whereas, with a shirt 
on, the air itself made some motion, and whistling under the 
shirt, was twofold cooler than without it. No more could I 
ever bring myself to go out in the heat of the sun without a 
cap or hat ; the heat of the sun beating with such violence as 
it does in that place, would give me the headache presently, 
by darting so directly upon my head, without a cap or hat 
on, so that I could not bear it ; whereas, if I put on my hat, 
it would presently go away. 

4- Tailoring and Umbrella Making. — Upon these 
views I began to consider about putting the few rags I had, 
which I called clothes, into some order. I had worn out all 
the waistcoats I had, and my business was now to try if I 
could not make jackets out of the great watchcoats that I had 
by me, and with such other materials as I had ; so I set to 
work a-tailoring, or rather, indeed, a-botching, for I made 
most piteous work of it. However, I made shift to make two 
or three new waistcoats, which I hoped would serve me a 
great while : as for breeches, or drawers, I made but a very 
sorry shift indeed, till afterwards. 

I have mentioned that I saved the skins of all the creatures 
that I killed, I mean four-footed ones ; and I had hung them 
up, stretched out with sticks, in the sun, by which means 
some of them were so dry and hard that they were fit for 
little, but others I found very useful. The first thing I made 
of these was a great cap for my head, with the hair on the 
outside, to shoot off the rain ; and this I performed so well, 
that after this I made me a suit of clothes wholly of the skins, 
that is to say, a waistcoat, and breeches, open at the knees, 
and both loose ; for they were rather wanting to keep mc 
cool than warm. I must not omit to acknowledge that they 
were wretchedly made ; for if I was a bad carpenter, I was a 
worse tailor. However, they were such as I made very good 
shift with ; and when I was abroad, if it happened to rain, 
the hair of my waistcoat and cap being uppermost, I was 
kept very dry. 

After this, I spent a great deal of time and pains to make 
me an umbrella. I was indeed in great want of one, and had 
a great mind to make one. I had seen them made in the 
Brazils, where they were very useful in the great heats which 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 



97 



are there ; and I felt the heats every jot as great here, and 

greater too, being nearer the equinox -? besides, as I was 

obliged to be much abroad, it was a most useful thing to me, 

as well for the rains as the heats. I took a world of pains 

at it, and was a great while before I could make anything 

likely to hold; nay, after I thought I had hit the way, I 

spoiled two or three before I made one to my mind, but at 

last I made one that answered indifferently well The main 

difficulty I found was to make it to let down : I could make 

it spread, but if it did not let down too, and draw in, it was 

not portable for me any way but just over my head, which 

would not do. However, at last, as I said, I made one to 

answer, and covered it with skins, the hair upwards, so that 

it cast off the rain like a pent-house,^ and kept off the sun so 

cflFectually, that I could walk out in the hottest of the 

weather with greater advantage than I could before in the 

coolest ; and when I had no need of it, could close it and 

cany it under my arm. 

Thus I lived mighty comfortably, my mind being entirely 
composed by resigning to the will of God, and throwing 
myself wholly upon the disposal of his providence. This made 
my life better than sociable ; for when I began to regret the 
want of conversation, I would ask myself, whether thus con- 
versing mutually with my own thoughts, and, as I hope I may 
say, with even God himself by ejaculations, was not better 
than the utmost enjoyment of human society in the world ?

XYll.— ROBINSON ATTEMPTS A CRUISE 

ROUND HIS ISLAND. 

1. A New Boat — I cannot say that after this, for five 
years, any extraordinary thing happened to me, but I lived 
on in the same course, in the same posture and place, just 

G 



9S ADVENTURES OF 

as before ; the chief things I was employed in, besides my 
yearly labour of planting my barley and rice, and curing my 
raisins, of both which I always kept up just enough to have 
sufficient stock of one year's provision beforehand : I say, 
besides this yearly labour, and my daily pursuit of going 
out with my gun, I had one labour, to make me a canoe, 
which at last I finished ; so that by digging a canal to it 
of six feet wide, and four feet deep, I brought it into the 
creek, almost half-a-mile. As for the first, which was so 
vastly big, as I made it without considering beforehand, as 
I ought to do, how I should be able to launch it, so, never 
being able to bring it into the water, or bring the water 
to it, I was obliged to let it lie where it was, as a memo- 
randum* to teach me to be wiser the next time : indeed, 
the next time, though I could not get a tree proper for 
it, and was in a place where I could not get the water 
to it at any less distance than, as I have said, near half-a- 
mile, yet as I saw it was practicable at last, I never gave it 
over ; and though I was near two years about it, yet I never 
grudged my labour, in hopes of having a boat to go off to 
sea at last. 

However, though my little periagua was finished, yet the 
size of it was not at all answerable to the design which 
I had in view when I made the first — I mean, of venturing 
over to the terra firina? where it was above forty miles 
broad ; accordingly, the smallness of my boat assisted to put 
an end to that design, and now I thought no more of it. 
As I had a boat, my next design was to make a cruise round 
the island ; for as I had been on the other side in one 
place, crossing, as I have already described it, over the 
land, so the discoveries I made in that little journey, 
made me very eager to see other parts of the coast ; and 
now I had a boat, I thought of nothing but sailing round 
the island. 

For this purpose, that I might do everything with discre- 
tion and consideration, I fitted up a little mast in my boat, 
and made a sail to it out of some of the pieces of the ship's 
sails which lay in store, and of which I had a great stock by 
me. Having fitted my mast and sail, and tried the boat, 
I found she would sail very well : then I made little 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 99 

lockers, or boxes, at each end of my boat, to put pro- 
visions, necessaries, ammunition, &c., into, to be kept 
dry, either from rain, or the spray of the sea ; and a little 
long hollow place I cut in the inside of the boat, where 
I could lay my gun, making a flap to hang down over it, to 
keep it dry. 

I fixed my umbrella also in a step at the stem, like 
a mast, to stand over my head, and keep the heat of the 
sun off me, like an awning ; and thus I every now and then 
took a little voyage upon the sea, but never went far out, 
nor far from the little creek. At last, being eager to view 
the circumference of my little kingdom, I resolved upon 
my cruise ; and accordingly, I victualled my ship for the 
voyage, putting in two dozen of loaves (cakes I should 
rather call them) of barley bread, an earthen pot full of 
parched rice (a food I ate a great deal of), a little bottle 
of mm, half a goat, and powder and shot for killing more, 
and two large watchcoats, of those which, as I mentioned 
before, I had saved out of the seamen's chests ; these I took, 
one to lie upon, and the other to cover me in the night. 

2. A Perilous Voyage. — It was the sixth of Novem- 
ber, in the sixth year of my reign, or my captivity, which 
you please, that I set out on this voyage, and I found it 
much longer than I expected ; for though the island itself 
Was not very large, yet when I came to the east side 
of it, I found a great ledge of rocks lie out about two 
leagues into the sea, some above water, some under it ; and 
beyond that a shoal of sand, lying dry half a league more, 
so that I was obliged to go a great way out to sea to double 
the point. 

When first I discovered them, I was going to give over 
my enterprise, and come back again, not knowing how far it 
might oblige me to go out to sea, and, above all, doubting 
how I should get back again ; so I came to an anchor — for 
I had made me a kind of anchor with a piece of broken 
grappling which I got out of the ship. 

Having secured my boat, I took my gun and went on 
shore, climbing up on a hill, which seemed to overlook 
that point, where I saw the full extent of it, and resolved to 
venture. 



100 ADVENTURES OF 

In my viewing the sea from that hill where I stood, I 
perceived a strong, and indeed a most furious current, 
which ran to the east, and even came close to the point ; 
and I took the more notice of it, because I saw there might 
be some danger that, when I came into it, I might be carried 
out to sea by the strength of it, and not be able to make 
the island again ; and, indeed, had I not got first upon 
this hill, I believe it would have been so ; for there was 
the same current on the other side the island, only that it set 
off at a farther distance, and I saw there was a strong eddy 
under the shore : so I had nothing to do but to get out oi 
the first current, and I should presently be in an eddy.^ 

I lay here, however, two days, because the wind blowing 
pretty fresh at E.S.E., and that being just contrary to the 
said current, made a great breach of the sea upon the 
point ; so that it was not safe for me to keep too close to 
the shore for the breach, nor to go too far off because of 
the stream. 

The third day, in the morning, the wind having abated 
overnight, the sea was calm, and I ventured ; but I am a 
warning-piece again to all rash and ignorant pilots : for no 
sooner was I come to the point, when I was not even my 
boat's length from the shore, but I found myself in a great 
depth of water, and a current like the sluice of a mill; it 
carried my boat along with it with such violence, that all I 
could do could not keep her so much as on the edge of it; 
but I found that it hurried me farther and farther out from 
the eddy, which was on my left hand. 

It is scarce possible to imagine the consternation I 
was now in, being driven from my beloved island (for so 
it appeared to me now to be) into the wide ocean, almost two 
leagues, and in the utmost despair of ever recovering il 
again. However, I worked hard, till indeed my strength was 
almost exhausted, and kept my boat as much to the north- 
ward, that is, towards the side of the current which the eddy 
lay on, as possibly I could ; when about noon, as the sun 
passed the meridian, I thought I felt a little breeze of 
wind in my face, springing up from S.S.E. This cheered 
my heart a little, and especially when, in about half an hour 
more, it blew a pretty gentle gale. By this time I was got at a 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 1 01 

frightful distance from the island, and had the least cloudy 
or hazy weather intervened, I had been undone another way 
too; for I had no compass on board, and should never 
have known how to have steered towards the island, if I had 
but once lost sight of it ; but the weather continuing clear, I 
applied myself to get up my mast again, and spread my sail, 
standing away to the north as much as possible, to get out of 
the current. 

Just as I had set my mast and sail, and the boat began to 
stretch away, I saw even by the clearness of the water some 
alteration of the current was near ; for where the current was 
so strong, the water was foul ; but perceiving the water clear, 
I found the current abate ; and presently I found to the 
east, at about half a mile, a breach of the sea upon some rocks : 
these rocks I found caused the current to part again, and as 
the main stress of it ran away more southerly, leaving the 
rocks to the north-east, so the other returned by the repulse 
of the rocks, and made a strong eddy, which ran away again 
to the north-west, with a very sharp stream. 

They who know what it is to have a reprieve'^ brought 
to them upon the ladder, or to be rescued from thieves just 
going to murder them, or who have been in such-like 
extremities, may guess what my present surprise of joy was, 
and how gladly I put my boat into the stream of this eddy; 
and the wind also freshening, how gladly I spread my sail to 
it, running cheerfully before the wind, and with a strong tide 
or eddy under foot. 

This eddy carried me about a league in my way back 
again, direct towards the island, but about two leagues more 
to the northward than the current which carried me away 
at first : so that when I came near the island, I found 
myself open to the northern shore of it, that is to say, 
the other end of the island, opposite to that which I went 
out from. 

When I had made something more than a league of way 
by the help of this current or eddy, 1 found it was spent, 
and served me no farther. However, I found that being 
between two great currents, viz. that on the south side, 
which had hurried me away, and that on the north, which 
lay about a league on the other side ; I say, between these 



102 ADVENTURES OF 

two, in the wake of the island, I found the water at least 
still, and running no way ; and having still a breeze of wind 
fair for me, I kept on steering directly for the island, though 
not making such fresh way as I did before. 

About four o'clock in the evening, being then within a 
league of the island, I found the point of the rocks which 
occasioned this disaster stretching out, as is described before, 
to the southward, and casting off the current more southerly, 
had, of course, made another eddy to the north ; and this I 
found very strong, but not directly setting the way my 
course lay, which was due west, but almost full north. 
However, having a fresh gale I stretched across this eddy, 
slanting north-west ; and, in about an hour, came within 
about a mile of the shore, where it being smooth water, 
I soon got to land. 

3. Safe in Harbour. — When I was on shore, I fell on 
my knees, and gave God thanks for my deliverance, resolv- 
ing to lay aside all thoughts of my deliverance by my boat ; 
and refreshing myself with such things as I had, I brought 
my boat close to the shore, in a little cove that I had spied 
under some trees, and laid me down to sleep, being 
quite spent with the labour and fatigue of the voyage. 

I was now at a great loss which way to get home with my 
boat. I had run so much hazard, and knew too much of the 
case, to think of attempting to risk it the way I went out ; and 
what might be at the other side (I mean the west side) 
I knew not, nor had I any mind to run any more ventures ; 
so I only resolved in the morning to make my way westward 
along the shore, and see if there was no creek where I might 
lay up my frigate in safety, so as to have her again, if ^ 
wanted her. In about three miles, or thereabouts, coastit^g 
the shore, I came to a very good inlet or bay, about a mU^ 
over, which narrowed till it came to a very little rivul^^ 
or brook, where I found a very convenient harbour f<^^ 
my boat, and where she lay as if she had been in a little do^^ 
made on purpose for her. Here I put in, and having 
stowed my boat very safe, I went on shore, to look about m^» 
and see where I was. 

I soon found I had but a little passed by the plac^ 
where I had been before, when I travelled on foot t^ 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. IO3 

that shore ; so taking nothing out of my boat but my gun 
and umbrella, for it was exceeding hot, I began my march. 
The way was comfortable enough after such a voyage as I 
had been upon, and I reached my old bower in the evening, 
where I found everything standing as I had left it; for 
I always kept it in good order, being, as I said before, my 
country house. 

I got over the fence, and laid me down in the shade 
to rest my limbs, for I was very weary, and fell asleep : but 
judge you, if you can, that read my story, what a surprise I 
must be in, when I was awaked out of my sleep by a 
voice, calling me by my name several times, Robin, Robin, 
Robin Crusoe ; poor Robin Crusoe ! Where are you, Robin 
Crusoe ? Where are you ? Where have you been ? 

I was so dead asleep at first, being fatigued with rowing, 

or paddling, as it is called, the first part of the day, and with 

walking the latter part, that I did not wake thoroughly ; but 

dozing between sleeping and waking, thought I dreamed 

that somebody spoke to me ; but as the voice continued to 

repeat Robin Crusoe, Robin Crusoe, at last I began to wake 

more perfectly, and was at first dreadfully frightened, and 

started up in the utmost consternation ; but no sooner were 

my eyes open, but I saw my Poll sitting on the top of the 

hedge ; and immediately knew it was he that spoke to me : 

^ot just in such bemoaning language I had used to talk to 

Win, and teach him : and he had learned it so perfectly, that 

j?e would sit upon my finger, and lay his bill close to my 

j^ce, and cry, Poor Robin Crusoe ! Where are you ? Where 

^ve you been ? How came you here ? and such things as 

^ had taught him. 

However, even though I knew it was the parrot, and 
•*^at indeed it could be nobody else, it was a good while 
5^^fore I could compose myself. First, I was amazed how 
^l^e creature got thither; and then how he should just keep 
^Oout the place, and nowhere else ; but as I was well satis- 
J^^d it could be nobody but honest Poll, I got over it ; and 
J^lding out my hand, and calling him by his name, Poll, 
^*^e sociable creature came to me, and sat upon my thumb, 
^ he used to do, and continued talking to me. Poor Robin 
^tusoe ! and how 4id I Qon^e here ? and where had I been ?

just as if he had been overjoyed to see me again : and si 
carried him home along with me. 

I now had enough of rambling to sea for some time, a 
had enough to do for many days to sit still, and to refl 
upon the danger I had been in. I would have been v 
glad to have had my boat again on my side of the islar 
but I knew not how it was practicable to get it about, 
to the east side of the island, which I had gone rounc 
knew well enough there was no venturing that way ; my v 
heart would shrink, and my very blood run chill, but 
think of it ; and as to the other side of the island, I did 
know how it might be there ; but supposing the current 
with the same force against the shore at the east as it pas 
by it on the other, I might run the same risk of be 
driven down the stream, and carried by the island, as 1 1 
been before of being carried away from it ; so, with th 
thoughts, I contented myself to be without any boat, thoi 
it had been the product of so many months' labour to m 
it, and of so many more to get it into the sea,

my temper I remained near a year, lived a very sed; 
retired life, as you may well suppose; and my thou^ 
being very much composed, as to my condition, and f 
comforted in resigning myself to the dispositions of Pn 
dence, I thought I lived really very happily in all thii 
except that of society. 

I improved myself in this time in all the mechanic e: 
cises which my necessities put me upon applying myself 
and I believe I could, upon occasion, have made a v 
good carpenter, especially considering how few tools I h 

Besides this, I arrived at an unexpected perfection in 
earthenware, and contrived well enough to make them v 
a wheel, which I found infinitely easier and better ; beca 
I made thbgs round and shapeable, which before were fil 
things indeed to look upon. But I think I was never w 
vain of my own performance, or more joyfu jfor anythir 
found out, than for my being able to make a tobacco-pi

done, and only burned red, like other earthenware, yet f

a my wickerware also I improved much, and made 
adance of necessary baskets, as well as my invention 
ved me ; though not very handsome, yet they were such 
rere very handy and convenient for my laying things up 
)r fetching things home. For example, if I killed a

cut it in pieces, and bring it home in a basket ; and the 
by a turtle : I could cut it up, take out the eggs, and a 
« or two of the flesh, which was enough for me, and 
ig them home in a basket, and leave the rest behind me. 
3 large deep baskets were the receivers of my corn, which 
ways rubbed out as soon as it was dry, and cured, and 
t it in great baskets.

was a want which it was impossible for me to supply, 
L I began seriously to consider what I must do when I

my being here, kept a young kid, and bred her up tame,

meaiis bring it to pass, till my kid grew an old goat ; 
! as I could never find in my heart to kill her, she died

MAN, 

* Crusoe as a Goatherd. — Being now in the 
enth year of my residence, and as I have said, my 
nunition growing low, I set myself to study some art to 



Io6 ADVENTURES OF 

trap and snare the goats, to see whether I could not catd 
some of them alive ; and particularly, I wanted a she-goa 
great with young. For this purpose, I made snares tc 
hamper them ; and I do believe they were more than ona 
taken in them : but my tackle was not good, for I had nc 
wire, and I always found them broken, and my bai 
devoured. At length I resolved to try a pitfall : so I duj 
several large pits in the earth, in places where I had observec 
the goats used to feed, and over those pits I placed hurdles 
of my own making too, with a great weight upon them ; anc 
several times I put ears of barley and dry rice, withou 
setting the trap ; and I could easily perceive that the goat< 
had gone in and eaten up the com, for I could see the marks 
of their feet. At length I set three traps in one night, anc 
going the next morning, I found them all standing, and yel 
the bait eaten and gone. This was very discouraging : how 
ever, I altered my traps ; and, not to trouble you with par 
ticulars, going one morning to see my traps, I found in one 
of them a large old he-goat, and in one of the others three 
kids, a male and two females. 

As to the old one, I knew not what to do with him ; he 
was so fierce, I durst not go into the pit to him ; that is to 
say, to go about to bring him away alive, which was what I 
wanted. I could have killed him, but that was not my 
business, nor would it answer my end ; so I even let him ou^ 
and he ran away, as if he had been frightened out of his 
wits. But I had forgot then, what I had learned after- 
wards, that hunger will tame a lion. If I had let him stay 
there three or four days without food, and then have carried 
him some water to drink, and then a little corn, he would 
have been as tame as one of the kids ; for they are mighty 
sagacious, tractable creatures, where they are well used. 
However, for the present I let him go, knowing no better at 
that time : then I went to the three kids, and taking them 
one by one, I tied them with strings together, and with some 
difficulty brought them all home. 

It was a good while before they would feed ; but throwing 
them some sweet corn, it tempted them, and they began lo 
be tame. And now I found that if I expected to supply 
myself with goat's flesh when I had no powder or shot 1^^ 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. I07 

breeding some up tame was my only way ; when, perhaps, I 
might have them about my house like a flock of sheep. But 
then it occurred to me, that I must keep the tame from the 
wild, or else they would always run wild when they grew 
up ; and the only way for this was, to have some enclosed 
piece of ground, well fenced, either with hedge or pale, to 
keep them in so effiectually, that those within might not 
break out, or those without break in. 

This was a great undertaking for one pair of hands ; yet 
as I saw there was an absolute necessity for doing it, my first 
work was to find out a proper piece of ground, where there 
was likely to be herbage for them to eat, water for them to 
drink, and cover to keep them from the sun. Having pitched 
upon a place proper for all these, as a first beginning I 
resolved to enclose a piece of about one hundred and fifty 
yards in length and one hundred yards in breadth, which, 
as it would maintain as many as I should have in any reason- 
able time, so as my stock increased, I could add more ground 
to ray enclosure. 

This was acting with some prudence, and I went to work 
with courage. I was about three months hedging in the first 
piece; and, till I had done it, I tethered the three kids in 
the best part of it, and used them to feed as near me as 
possible, to make them familiar ; and very often I would go 
and carry them some ears of barley, or a handful of rice, 
and feed them out of my hand : so that after my enclosure 
^as finished, and I let them loose, they would follow me up 
and down, bleating after me for a handful of corn. 

This answered my end, and in about a year and a half I 
'^ad a flock of about twelve goats, kids and all ; and in two 
y^^Ts more I had three-and-forty, besides several that I took 
^?d killed for my food. After that I enclosed five several 
j[J^eces of ground to feed them in, with little pens to drive 
'^em into, to take them as I wanted, and gates out of one 
^^^ce of ground into another. . 

-. But this was not all, for now I not only had goat's flesh to 
.^^d on when I pleased, but milk too — a thing which, 
^^deed, in the beginning, I did not so much as think of, and 
^hich, when it came into my thoughts, was really an agree- 
^ole surprise ; for now I set up my dairy, and had somet inches 



Io8 ADVENTURES OF 

a gallon or two of milk in a day. And as Nature, who 
gives supplies of food to every creature, dictates even 
naturally how to make use of it, so I, that had never milked 
a cow, much less a goat, or seen butter or cheese nuide, only 
when I was a boy, after a great many essays and miscarriages,' 
made me both butter and cheese at last, and also salt 
(though I found it partly made to my hand by the heat of 
the sun upon some of the rocks of the sea), and never 
wanted it afterwards. How mercifully can our Creator treat 
his creatures, even in those conditions in which they seemed 
to be overwhelmed in destruction ! How can he sweeten 
the bitterest providences,^ and give us cause to praise him 
for dungeons and prisons ! What a table was here spread 
for me in a wilderness, where I saw nothing, at first, but to 
perish for hunger ! 

2. Crusoe Draws his Portrait — It would have made 
a stoic^ smile to have seen me and my little family sit down 
to dinner. There was my majesty, the prince and lord of 
the whole island ; I had the lives of all my subjects at my 
absolute command, I could hang, draw, give liberty, and take 
it away ; and no rebels among all my subjects. • 

Then to see how like a king I dined too, all alone^ 
attended by my servants : Poll, as if he had been m^ 
favourite, was the only person permitted to talk to me. M^ 
dog, who was now grown very old and crazy, and had found. 
no species to multiply his kind upon, sat always at my righ.'t' 
hand ; and two cats, one on one side of the table, and one 
on the other, expecting now and then a bit from my hand, 
as a mark of special favour. 

But these were not the two cats which I brought on shore 
at first, for they were both of them dead, and had been 
interred near my habitation by my own hand ; but one of 
them having multiplied by I know not what kind of creature, 
these were two which I had preserved tame; whereas the 
rest ran wild in the woods, and became indeed troublesome 
to me at last ; for they would often come into my house, 
and plunder me too, till at last I was obliged to shoot them, 
and did kill a great many ; at length they left me. — With 
this attendance, and in this plentiful manner, I lived' 
neither could I be said to want anything but society; and 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. I09 

of that, some time after this, I was like to have too much. 
Had any one in England happened to meet such a man as 
I was, it must either have frightened him, or raised a great 
deal of laughter ; and as I frequently stood still to look at 
myself, I could not but smile at the notion of my travelling 
through Yorkshire, with such an equipage,^ and in such a 
dress. Be pleased to take a sketch of my figure, as follows. 
I had a great high shapeless cap, made of a goat's skin, 
with a flap hanging down behind, as well to keep the sun 
from me as to shoot the rain off from running into my neck; 
nothing being so hurtful in these climates as the rain upon 
the flesh, under the clothes. 

I had a short jacket of goat's skin, the skirts coming down 
to about the middle of the thighs, and a pair of open-kneed 
breeches of the same ; the breeches were made of the skin of 
an old he-goat, whose hair hung down such a length on 
either side, that, like pantaloons, it reached to the middle of 
my legs : stockings and shoes I had none, but had made me 
a pair of somethings, I scarce know what to call them, like 
buskins,^ to flap over my legs, and lace on either side like 
spatterdashes, but of a most barbarous shape, as indeed were 
all the rest of my clothes. 

I had on a broad belt of goat's skin dried, which I drew 
together with two thongs of the same, instead of buckles ; 
^nd in a kind of a frog^ on either side of this, instead of a 
sword and dagger, hung a little saw and a hatchet ; one on 
^ne side, and one on the other. I had another belt, not so 
"road, and fastened in the same manner, which hung over 
^y shoulder ; and at the end of it, under my left arm, hung 
^wo pouches, both made of goat's skin too : in one of which 
'^^ng my powder, in the other my shot. At my back I 
^rried my basket, and on my shoulder my gun ; and over 
^y head a great clumsy ugly goat's-skin umbrella, but which, 
^fter all, was the most necessary thing I had about me, next 
to my gun. As for my face, the colour of it was really not 
^ mulatto-like as one might expect from a man not at all 
ireful of it, and living within nine or ten degrees of the 
^^uinox.^ My beard I had once suffered to grow till it was 
^^out a quarter of a yard long ; but as I had both scissors 
^^d razors sufficient, I had cut it pretty short, except what 



no ADVENTURES OF 

grew on my upper lip, which I had trimmed into a large 
pair of Mahometan whiskers, such as I had seen worn by 
some Turks at Sallee ; for the Moors did not wear such, 
though the Turks did : of these mustachios or whiskers, I 
will not say they were long enough to hang my hat upon 
them, but they were of a length and shape monstrous 
enough, and such as, in England, would have passed for 
frightful. 

3. A Prosperous Man. — You are to understand that 
now I had, as I may call it, two plantations in the island — 
one, my little fortification or tent with the wall about it, 
under the rock, with the cave behind me, which, by this time, 
I had enlarged into several apartments or caves, one within 
another. One of these, which was the driest and largest, 
and had a door out beyond my wall or fortification, that is 
to say, beyond where my wall joined to the rock, was all 
filled up with the large earthen pots, of which I have given 
an account, and with fourteen or fifteen great baskets, which 
would hold five or six bushels each, where I laid up my 
stores of provision, especially my corn, some in the ear, 
cut off short from the straw, and the other rubbed out 
with my hand. 

As for my wall, made, as before, with long stakes or piles, 
those piles grew all like trees, and were by this time grown 
so big, and spread so very much, that there was not the 
least appearance, to any one's view, of any habitation behind 
them. 

Near this dwelling ot mine, but a little farther within th 
land, and upon lower ground, lay my two pieces of corn land„^ 
which I kept duly cultivated and sowed, and which duly^ 
yielded me theu: harvest in its season ; and whenever C 
had occasion for more corn, I had more land adjoining as fit^ 
as that. 

Besides this, I had my country seat ; and I had now 
tolerable plantation there also : for, first, I had my littl 
bower, as I called it, which I kept in repair ; that is to say 
I kept the hedge which encircled it in constantly fitted up t 
its usual height, the ladder standing always in the inside : 
kept the trees, which at first were no more than my stakes 
but were now grown very firm and tall, always cut, so thai 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. HI 

they might spread and grow thick and wild, and make the 
more agreeable shade, which they did effectually to my mind. 
In the middle of this I had my tent always standing, being 
a piece of a sail spread over poles, set up for that purpose 
and which never wanted any repair or renewing ; and 
under this I had made me a squab or couch, with the 
skins of the creatures I had killed, and with other soft things; 
and a blanket laid on them, such as belonged to our sea bed- 
ding, which I had saved, and a great watch-coat to cover me ; 
and here, whenever I had occasion to be absent from my 
chiefs seat, I took up my country habitation. 

Adjoining to this I had my enclosures for my cattle, that 
is to say, my goats ; and as I had taken an inconceivable 
deal of pains to fence and enclose this ground, I was so 
anxious to see it kept entire, lest the goats should break 
through, that I never left off, till, with infinite labour, I had 
stuck the outside of the hedge so full of small stakes, and 
so near to one another, that it was rather a pale than a 
hedge, and there was scarce room to put a hand through 
between them ; which afterwards, when those stakes grew, as 
they all did in the next rainy season, made the enclosure 
strong like a wall — indeed, stronger than any wall. 

This will testify for me that I was not idle, and that I 
spared no pains to bring to pass whatever appeared necessary 
for my comfortable support ; for I considered the keeping 
up a breed of tame creatures thus at my hand would be a 
living magazine of flesh, milk, butter, and cheese for me as 
long as I lived in the place, if it were to be forty years ; and 
that keeping them in my reach depended entirely upon my 
perfecting my enclosures to such a degree, that I might be 
sure of keeping them together ; which by this method, in- 
deed, I so effectually secured, that when these little stakes 
began to grow, I had planted them so very thick, that I was 
forced to pull some of them up again. 

In this place also I had my grapes growing, which I princi- 
pally depended on for my winter store of raisins, and which 
I never failed to preserve very carefully, as the best and most 
agreeable dainty of my whole diet; and, indeed, they were not 
only agreeable, but medicinal, wholesome, nourishing, and 
refreshing to the last degree.

As this was also about half-way between my othei 
habitation and the place where I had laid up my boat, I 
generally stayed and lay here in my way thither : for I used 
frequently to visit my boat ; and I kept all things about 
or belonging to her in very good order. Sometimes I went 
out in her to divert myself, but no more hazardous 
voyages would I go, nor scarce ever above a stone's cast 
or two from the shore, I was so apprehensive of being 
hurried out of my knowledge again by the currents oi 
winds, or any other accident. But now I come to a new 
scene of my life.

XIX.— THE FOOTPRINT IN THE SAN£>. 

I. Cause of Alarm. — It happened one day, about noon, 
going towards my boat, I was exceedingly surprised with the 
print of a man's naked foot on the shore, which was very 
plain to be seen in the sand. I stood like one thunderstruck, 
or as if I had seen an apparition -} I listened, I looked round 
me, but I could hear nothing, nor see anything ; I went up 
to a rising ground, to look farther ; I went up the shore, and 
down the shore, but it was all one ; I could see no other 
impression but that one. I went to it again to see if there 
were any more, and to observe if it might not be my fancy ; 
but there was no room for that, for there was exactly the 
print of a foot, toes, heel, and every part of a foot. How it 
came thither I knew not, nor could I in the least imagine ; 
but, after innumerable fluttering thoughts, like a man per- 
fectly confused and out of myself, I came home to my forti- 
fication, not feeling, as we say, the ground I went on, but 
terrified to the last degree, looking behind me at every two 
or three steps, mistaking every bush and tree, and fancying 
every stump at a distance to be a man. Nor is it possible to 
describe how many various shapes my affrighted imagination 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. II3 

represented things to me in, how many wild ideas were found 
every moment in my fancy, and what strange unaccountable 
whimsies^ came into my thoughts by the way. 

When I came to my castle (for so I think I called it ever 
after this), I fled into it like one pursued. Whether I went 
over by the ladder, as first contrived, or went in at the hole 
in the rock, which I had called a door, I cannot remember ; 
no, nor could I remember the next morning ; for never fright- 
ened hare fled to cover, or fox to earth, with more terror of 
mind than I to this retreat. I slept none that night, and to 
my sorrow I found that my fear banished all my religious 
hope, all that former confidence in God, which was founded 
upon such wonderful experience as I had had of his 
goodness. 

How strange a chequer-work^ of Providence is the life of 
man ! and by what secret different springs are the afiections 
hurried about, as different circumstances present ! To-day 
we love what to-morrow we hate ; to-day we seek what to- 
morrow we shun ; to-day we desire what to-morrow we fear, 
nay, even tremble at the apprehensions of. This was exempli- 
fied in me, at this time, in the most lively manner imaginable ; 
for I, whose only affliction was that I seemed banished from 
human society, that I was alone, circumscribed* by the 
boundless ocean, cut off from mankind, and condemned to 
what I called silent life ; that I was as one whom Heaven 
thought not worthy to be numbered among the living, or to 
appear among the rest of his creatures ; that to have seen 
one of my own species would have seemed to me a raising 
me from death to life, and the greatest blessing that Heaven 
itself, next to the supreme blessing of salvation, could bestow ; 
I say, that I should now tremble at the very apprehensions 
of seeing a man, and was ready to sink into the ground at but 
the shadow or silent appearance of a man's having set his 
foot in the island. 

My anxious thoughts took me up many hours, days, nay, 
I may say, weeks and months ; and one particular effect of 
my cogitations on this occasion I cannot omit. One morning 
early, lying in my bed, and filled with thoughts about my 
danger from the appearances of savages, I found it discom- 
posed me very much; upon which these words of the 

H 



114 ADVENTURES OF 

Scripture came into my thoughts : " Call upon me in the 
day of trouble, and I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify 
me." Upon this, rising cheerfully out of my bed, my heart 
was not only comforted, but I was guided and encouraged 
to pray earnestly to God for deliverance. When I had done 
praying, I took up my Bible, and opening it to read, the first 
words that presented to me were, " Wait on the Lord, and be 
of good cheer, and he shall strengthen thy heart ; wait, I say, 
on the Lord" It is impossible to express the comfort this 
gave me. In answer, I thankfully laid down the book, and 
was no more sad, at least on that occasion. 

In the middle of these cogitations, apprehensions, and 
reflections, it came into my thoughts one day, that all this 
might be a mere chimera^ of my own, and that this foot might 
be the print of my own foot, when I came on shore from my 
boat. This cheered me up a little too, and I began to persuade 
myself it was all a delusion ; that it was nothing else but my 
own foot : and why might I not come that way from the boat, 
as well as I was going that way to the boat? Again, I 
considered also, that I could by no means tell, for certain, 
where I had trod, and where I had not ; and that if, at last, 
this was only the print of my own foot, I had played the part 
of those fools who try to make stories of spectres^ and 
apparitions, and then are frightened at them more than 
anybody. 

Now I began to take courage, and to peep abroad again, 
for I had not stirred out of my castle for three days ancL- 
nights, so that I began to starve for provisions; for I had 
little or nothing within doors but some barley cakes and 
water. Then I knew that my goats wanted to be milked too, 
which usually was my evening diversion; and the poor 
creatures were in great pain and inconvenience for want o 
it : and, indeed, it almost spoiled some of them, and almost 
dried up their milk. Encouraging myself, therefore, with the 
belief that this was nothing but the print of one of my own 
feet, and that I might be truly said to start at my own. 
shadow, I began to go abroad again, and went to my country 
house to milk my flock : but to see with what fear I went 
forward, how often I looked behind me, how I was ready, 
every now and then, to lay down my basket, and run for my 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. I15 

life, it would have made any one think I was haunted with 
an evil conscience, or that I had been lately most terribly 
frightened ; and so, indeed, I had. However, as I went 
down thus two or three days, and having seen nothing, I 
began to be a little bolder, and to think there was really 
nothing in it but my own imagination ; but I could not 
persuade myself fully of this till I should go down to the 
shore again, and see this print of a foot, and measure it by 
my own, and see if there was any similitude or fitness, that 
I might be assured it was ray own foot. But when I came to 
the place, first, it appeared evidently to me, that when I laid 
up my boat, I could not possibly be on shore anywhere 
thereabout ; secondly, when I came to measure the mark 
with my own foot I found my foot not so large by a great 
deal Both these things filled my head with new imagina- 
tions, and gave me the vapours^^ again to the highest degree, 
so that I shook with cold like one in an ague ; and I went 
home again, filled with the belief that some man or men had 
been on shore there; or, in short, that the island was 
inhabited, and I might be surprised before I was aware ; and 
what course to take for my security I knew not. 

O what ridiculous resolutions men take when possessed 
with fear 1 It deprives them of the use of those means 
which reason offers for their relief. The first thing I pro- 
posed to myself was, to throw down my enclosures, and turn 
all my tame cattle wild into the woods, lest the enemy should 
find them, and then frequent the island in prospect of the 
same or the like booty ; then to the simple thing of digging 
up my two corn fields, lest they should find such a grain 
there, and still be prompted to frequent the island ; then to 
demolish my bower and tent, that they might not see any 
vestiges of habitation, and be prompted to look farther, in 
order to find out the persons inhabiting. 

These were the subject of the first night's cogitations after 
I was come home again, while the apprehensions which had 
so overrun my mind were fresh upon me, and my head was 
full of vapours, as above. Thus fear of danger is ten 
thousand times more terrifying than danger itself when 
apparent to the eyes ; and we find the burden of anxiety 
greater, by much, than the evil which we are anxious about 



Il6 ADVENTURES OF 

This confusion of my thoughts kept me awake all night ; 
but in the morning I fell asleep ; and having, by the amuse- 
ment of my mind, been as it were tired, and my spirits 
exhausted, I slept very soundly and waked much better 
composed than I had ever been before. 

2. He Prepares for Defence. — And now I began 
to think sedately ; and, upon the utmost debate with myself, 
I concluded that this island, which was so exceeding 
pleasant^ fruitful, and no farther from the main land than 
as I had seen, was not so entirely abandoned as I might 
imagine; that although there were no stated inhabitants 
who lived on the spot, yet that there might sometimes 
come boats off from the shore, who, either with design, 
or perhaps never but when they were driven by cross 
winds, might come to this place; that I had lived here 
fifteen years now, and had not met with the least shadow or 
figure of any people yet ; and that if at any time they should 
be driven here, it was probable they went away again as 
soon as ever they could, seeing they had never thought 
fit to fix here upon any occasion; that the most I could 
suggest any danger from, was from any casual accidental 
landing of straggling people from the main, who, as it was 
likely, if they were driven hither, were here against their 
wills ; so they made no stay here, but went off again with all 
possible speed, seldom staying one night on shore, lest they 
should not have the help of the tides and daylight 
back again ; and that, therefore, I had nothing to do but to 
consider of some safe retreat, in case I should see any 
savages land upon the spot. 

Now I began sorely to repent that I had dug my cave so 
large as to bring a door through again, which door, as I said, 
came out beyond where my fortification joined to the rock. 
Upon maturely considering this, therefore, I resolved to draw 
me a second fortification, in the same manner of a semicircle, 
at a distance from my wall, just where I had planted a double 
row of trees about twelve years before, of which I made 
mention. These trees having been planted so thick before, 
they wanted but few piles to be driven between them, that 
they might be thicker and stronger, and my wall would 
be soon finished: so that I had now a double wall ; and my 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. II7 

outer wall was thickened with pieces of timber, old cables* 
and everjrthing I could think of, to make it strong, having in 
it seven little holes, about as big as I might put my arm out 
at In the inside of this, I thickened my wall to about ten 
feet thick, with continually bringing earth out of my cave, 
and laying it at the foot of the wall, and walking upon 
it; and through the seven holes I contrived to plant the 
muskets, of which I took notice that I had got seven on shore 
out of the ship : these I planted like my cannon, and fitted 
them into frames, that held them like a carriage, so that I 
could fire all the seven guns in two minutes' time : this wall I 
was many a weary month in finishing, and yet never thought 
myself safe till it was done. 

When this was done, I stuck all the ground without my 
wall, for a great length every way, as full with stakes, or 
sticks, of the osier-like wood, which I found so apt to grow, 
as they could well stand ; insomuch, that I believe I might 
set in twenty thousand of them, leaving a pretty large space 
between them and my wall, that I might have room to see an 
enemy, and they might have no shelter from the young trees, 
if they attempted to approach my outer wall. 

Thus, in two years' time, I had a thick grove ; and in five 
or six years' time, I had a wood before my dwelling, growing 
so monstrous thick and strong, that it was indeed perfectly 
impassable ; and no man, of what kind soever, would ever 
imagine that there was anything beyond it, much less a 
habitation. As for the way which I proposed to myself to 
go in and out (for I left no avenue), it was by setting 
two ladders, one to a part of the rock which was low, 
and then broke in, and left room to place another ladder 
upon that : so when the two ladders were taken down, 
no man living could come down to me without doing himself 
mischief; and if they had come down, they were still on the 
outside of my outer wall. 

Thus I took all the measures human prudence could 
suggest for my own preservation; and it will be seen, at 
length, that they were not altogether without just reason, 
though I foresaw nothing at that time more than my mere 
fear suggested to me. 

3. Further Precautions. — While this was doing, I 



Il8 ADVENTURES OF 

was not altogether careless of my other affairs : for I had a 
great concern upon me for my little herd of goats ; they 
were not only a ready supply to me on every occasion, and 
began to be sufficient for me, without the expense of powder 
and shot, but also without the fatigue of hunting after 
the wild ones ; and I was loth to lose the advantage of them, 
and to have them all to nurse up over again. 

For this purpose, after long consideration, I could think 
of but two ways to preserve them : one was, to find another 
convenient place to dig a cave under ground, and to drive 
them into it every night ; and the other was, to enclose two 
or three little bits of land, remote from one another, and 
as much concealed as I could, where I might keep about half 
a dozen goats in each place : so that if any disaster happened 
to the flock in general, I might be able to raise them 
again with little trouble and time; and this, though it 
would require a great deal of time and labour, I thought 
was the most rational design. 

Accordingly, I spent some time to find out the most 
retired parts of the island ; and I pitched upon one, which 
was as private, indeed, as my heart could wish for : it was a 
damp little piece of ground, in the middle of the hollow and 
thick woods, where, as I observed, I almost lost myself once 
before, endeavouring to come back that way from the eastern 
part of the island. Here I found a clear piece of land, 
near three acres, so surrounded with woods, that it was 
almost an enclosure by nature ; at least it did not want near 
so much labour to make it so as the other pieces of ground 
I had worked so hard at. 

I immediately went to work with this piece of ground, and 
in less than a month's time I had so fenced it round, that 
my flock, or herd, call it which you please, who were not so 
wild now as at first they might be supposed to be, were well 
enough secured in it : so, without any further delay, I 
removed ten young she-goats and two he-goats to this 
piece ; and when they were there, I continued to perfect the 
fence, till I had made it as secure as the other, which, how- 
ever, I did at more leisure, and it took me up more time by 
a great deal. All this labour I was at the expense of purely 
from my apprehensions on the account of the print of a 



ROBINSON CRUSOE.

man's foot which I had seen ; for, as yet, I never saw any 
human creature come near the island ; and I had now lived 
two years under this uneasiness, which, indeed, made my 
life much less comfortable than it was before, as may be 
well imagined by any who knows what it is to live in the 
constant snare of the fear of man.

I. Relics of a Feast. — But to go on : after I had thus 
secured one part of my little living stock, I went about the 
whole island, searching for another private place to make 
such another deposit ; when, wandering more to the west 
point of the island than I had ever done yet, and looking 
out to sea, I thought I saw a boat upon the sea, at a great 
distance. I had found a perspective glass or two in one of 
the seamen's chests, which I saved out of our ship, but I 
had it not about me ; and this was so remote, that I could 
not tell what to make of it, though I looked at it till my 
eyes were not able to hold to look any longer : whether it 
was a boat or not, I do not know, but as I descended from 
the hill I could see no more of it, so I gave it over ; only I 
resolved to go no more out without a perspective glass in 
my pocket. When I was come down the hill to the end of 
the island, where, indeed, I had never been before, I was 
presently convinced that the seeing the print of a man's foot 
was not such a strange thing in the island as I imagined : 
and, but that it was a special providence that I was cast upon 
the side of the island where the savages never came, I should 
easily have known that nothing was more frequent than for 
the canoes from the main, when they happened to be a little 
too far out at sea, to shoot over to that side of the island for 
harbour: likewise, as they often met and fought in their 



I20 ADVENTURES OF 

canoes, the victors, having taken any prisoners, would bring 
them over to this shore, where, according to their dreadful 
customs, being all cannibals, they would kill and eat them ; 
of which hereafter. 

When I was come down the hill to the shore, as I said 
above, being the south-west point of the island, I was per- 
fectly confounded and amazed ; nor is it possible for me to 
express the horror of my mind, at seeing the shore spread 
with skulls, hands, feet, and other bones of human bodies ; 
amd, particularly, I observed a place where there had 
been a fire made, and a circle dug in the earth, like a cock- 
pit,* where I supposed the savage wretches had sat down 
to their inhuman feastings upon the bodies of their fellow- 
creatures. 

I was so sistonished with the sight of these things, that I 
entertained no notions of any danger to myself from it for 
a long while : all my apprehensions were buried in the 
thoughts of such a pitch of inhuman, hellish brutality, 
and the horror of the degeneracy of human nature, which, 
though I had heard of it often, yet I never had so near a 
view of before : in short, I turned away my face from the 
horrid spectacle ; my stomach grew sick, and I was just at 
the point of fainting, when nature discharged the disorder 
from my stomach : and having vomited with uncommon 
violence, I was a little relieved, but could not bear to 
stay in the place a moment ; so I got me up the hill again 
with all the speed I could, and walked on towards my own 
habitation. 

When I came a little out of that part of the island, I 
stood still awhile, as amazed, and then recovering myself, I 
looked up with the utmost aifection of my soul, and, with a 
flood of tears in my eyes, gave God thanks, that had cast 
my first lot in a part of the world where I was distinguished 
from such dreadful creatures as these; and that, though 
I had esteemed my present condition very miserable, had 
yet given me so many comforts in it, that I had still 
more to give thanks for than to complain of: and this, 
above all, that I had, even in this miserable condition, 
been comforted with the knowledge of Himself, and the 
hope of His blessing, which was a felicity more than sufli- 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 121 

ciently equivalent to all the misery which I had suffered or 
could suffer. 
2. Crusoe Lives in Retirement.— In this frame of 

thankfulness, I went home to my castle, and began to be much 
easier now, as to the safety of my circumstances, than ever 
I was before : for I observed that these wretches never came 
to this island in search of what they could get ; perhaps not 
seeking, not wanting, or not expecting, anything here, and 
having often, no doubt, been up in the covered woody part 
of it, without finding anything to their purpose. I knew I 
had been here now almost eighteen years, and never saw 
the least footsteps of human creature there before ; and I 
might be eighteen years more as entirely concealed as I was 
now, if I did not discover myself to them, which I had no 
manner of occasion to do; it being my only business to 
keep myself entirely concealed where I was, unless I found 
a better sort of creatures than cannibals to make myself 
known to. Yet I entertained such an abhorrence of the 
savage wretches that I have been speaking of, and of the 
Wretched inhuman custom of their devouring and eating 
One another up, that I continued pensive and sad, and kept 
close within my own circle, for almost two years after this ; 
When I say my own circle, I mean by it my three planta- 
tions, viz., my castle, my country seat, which I called my 
l>ower, and my enclosure in the woods : nor did I look after 
tliis for any other use than as an enclosure for my goats ; 
^cr the aversion which nature gave me to these wretches 
Was such, that I was as fearful of seeing them as of seeing 
the devil himself. 

I believe the reader of this will not think it strange if I 
Confess that these anxieties, these constant dangers I lived 
in, and the concern that was now upon me, put an end to 
^1 invention, and to all the contrivances that I had laid for 
^y future accommodations and conveniences. I had the 
care of my safety more now upon my hands than that of 
my food. I cared not to drive a nail, or chop a stick of 
wood now, for fear the noise I might make should be heard ; 
much less would I fire a gun, for the same reason ; and, 
above all, I was intolerably uneasy at making any fire, lest 
the smoke, which is visible at a great distance in the day. 



123 ADVENTURES OF 

should betray me. For this reason I removed that part of 
my business which required fire, such as burning of pots and 
pipes, &c., into my new apartment in the woods; where, 
after I had been some time, I found, to my unspeakable 
consolation, a mere natural cave in the earth, which went in 
a vast way, and where, I dare say, no savage, had he been 
at the mouth of it, would be so hardy as to venture in : nor, 
indeed, would any man else, but one who, like me, wanted 
nothing so much as a safe retreat 

2. Crusoe's Cave. — The mouth of this hollow was at 
the bottom of a great rock, where by mere accident (I would 
say, if I did not see abundant reason to ascribe all such 
things now to Providence) I was cutting down some thick 
branches of trees to make charcoal ; and, before I go on, I 
must observe the reason of my making this charcoal, which 
was thus : I was afraid of making a smoke about my habi- 
tation, as I said before ; and yet I could not live there with- 
out baking my bread, cooking my meat, &c., so I contrived 
to burn some wood here, as I had seen done in England, 
under turf, until it became chark, or dry coal : and then 
putting the fire out, I preserved the coal to carry home, and 
perform the other services for which fire was wanting, with- 
out danger of smoke. But this is by the by. 

While I was cutting down some wood here, I perceived 
that behind a very thick branch of low brushwood, or under- 
wood, there was a kind of hollow place. I was curious to 
look in it, and getting with difficulty into the mouth of it, I 
found it was pretty large ; that is to say, sufficient for me to 
stand upright in it, and perhaps another with me. But I 
must confess to you that I made more haste out than I did 
in, when, looking farthier into the place, and which was 
perfectly dark, I saw two broad shining eyes of some 
creature, whether devil or man I knew not, which twinkled 
like two stars, the dim light from the cave's mouth shining 
directly in, and making the reflection. However, after 
some pause, I recovered myself, and began to call myself a 
thousand fools, and to think, that he that was afraid to see 
the devil was not fit to live twenty years in an island all 
alone ; and that I might well think there was nothing in 
this cave that was more frightful than myselC 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. laj 

Upon thisy plucking up my courage, I took up a firebrand, 

and in I rushed again, with the stick flaming in my hand. 

I had not gone three steps in, but I was almost as much 

frightened as I was before ; for I heard a very loud sigh, 

like that of a man in some pain, and it was followed by a 

broken noise, like that of words half expressed, and then 

a deep sigh again. I stepped back, and was indeed struck 

with such a surprise, that it put me into a cold sweat ; and 

if I had bad a hat on my head, I will not answer for it, that 

my hair might not have lifted it off. But still pluckinp; up 

my spirits as well as I could, and encouraging myself a 

little with considering that the power and presence of God 

was ever3rwhere, and was able to protect me, upon this I 

stepped forward again, and by the light of the firebrand, 

holding it up a little over my head, I saw lying on the 

ground a most monstrous, frightful, old he-goat, just making 

his will, as we say, and gasping for life, and dying, indeed, 

of mere old age. I stirred him a little to see if I 

could get him out, and he essayed to get up, but was not 

able to raise himself; and I thought with myself he 

might even lie there ; for if he had h-ightened me, so he 

would certainly fright any of the savages, if any of them 

should be so hardy as to come in there while he had any 

life in him. 

I was now recovered from my surprise, and began to 

look round me, when I found the cave was but very small, 

that is to say, it might be about twelve feet over, but in 

no manner of shape, neither round nor square, no hands 

having ever been employed in making it but those of mere 

Nature. I observed also that there was a place at the 

&rther side of it that went in farther, but was so low that 

it required me to creep upon my hands and knees to go 

into it, and whither it went I knew not: so having no 

candle, I gave it over for that time ; but resolved to come 

again the next day, provided with candles and a tinder-box,^ 

which I had made of the lock of one of the muskets, with 

some wildfire^ in the pan. 

Accordingly, the next day I came provided with six large 
candles of my own making (for I made very good candles 
now of goafs tallow but was hard set for candle-wick, using 



124 ADVENTURES OF 

sometimes rags or rope-yarn, and sometimes the dried rind 
of a weed like nettles) ; and going into this low place, I 
was obliged to creep upon all-fours, as I have said, almost 
ten yards ; which, by the way, I thought was a venture 
bold enough, considering that I knew not how far it might 
go, nor what was beyond it. When I had got through the 
strait, I found the roof rose higher up, I believe near twenty 
feet ; but never was such a glorious sight seen in the island, 
I dare say, as it was, to look round the sides and roof of 
this vault or cave ; the wall reflected a hundred thousand 
lights to me from my two candles. What it was in the 
rock, whether diamonds, or any other precious stones, or 
gold, which I rather supposed it to be, I knew not. 

The place I was in was a most delightful cavity or 
grotto of its kind, as could be expected, though perfectly 
dark ; the floor was dry and level, and had a sort of a 
small loose gravel upon it, so that there was no nauseous or 
venomous creature to be seen, neither was there any damp 
or wet on the sides or roof : the only difficulty in it was the 
entrance, which, however, as it was a place of security, and 
such a retreat as I wanted, I thought that was a convenience, 
so that I was really rejoiced at the discovery, and resolved) 
without any delay, to bring some of those things which I 
was most anxious about to this place ; particularly, I 
resolved to bring hither my magazine of powder, and all 
my spare arms, viz., two fowling-pieces, for I had three in 
all, and three muskets, for of them I had eight in all : so I 
kept at my castle only five, which stood ready mounted like 
pieces of cannon, on my outmost fence, and were ready also 
to take out upon any expedition. 

Upon this occasion of removing my ammunition I 
happened to open the barrel of powder which I took up out 
of the sea, and which had been wet ; and I found that the 
water had penetrated about three or four inches into the 
powder on every side, which, caking and growing hard, had 
preserved the inside like a kernel in the shell, so that I had 
near sixty pounds of very good powder in the centre of the 
cask. This was a very agreeable discovery to me at that time; 
so I carried all away thither, never keeping above two or 
three pounds of powder with me in my castle, for fear of a 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 1 25 

surprise of any kind : I also carried thither all the lead I had 
left for bullets. 

I fancied myself now like one of the ancient giants, which 
were said to live in caves and holes in the rocks, where none 
could come at them ; for I persuaded myself, while I was 
here, that if five hundred savages were to hunt me, they 
could never find me out ; or, if they did, they would not 
venture to attack me here. 

The old goat, which I found expiring, died in the mouth 
of the cave the next day after I made this discovery : and I 
found it much easier to dig a great hole there, and throw 
him in and cover him with earth, than to drag him out ; 
so I interred him there, to prevent offence to my nose. 

3. Sources of Amusement — I was now in the 

twenty-third year of my residence in this island, and 

was so naturalised to the place and the manner of living, 

that could I have but enjoyed the certainty that no 

savages would come to the place to disturb me, I could 

have been content to have capitulated for spending the rest 

of my time there, even to the last moment, till I had laid 

me down and died, like the old goat in the cave. I had 

also arrived to some little diversions and amusements, which 

made the time pass a great deal more pleasantly with me 

than it did before : as, first, I had taught my Poll, as I noted 

before, to speak ; and he did it so familiarly, and talked so 

articulately and plain, that it was very pleasant to me ; for 

I believe no bird ever spoke plainer ; and he lived with me 

no less than six-and-twenty years. How long he might have 

lived afterwards I know not, though I know they have a 

notion in the Brazils that they live a hundred years. My 

dog was a very pleasant and loving companion to me for 

no less than sixteen years of my time, and then died of mere 

old age. As for my cats, they multiplied, as I have observed, 

to that degree, that I was obliged to shoot several of them at 

first, to keep them from devouring me and all I had ; but at 

length, when the two old ones I brought with me were gone, 

and after some time continually driving them from me, and 

letting them have no provision with me, they all ran wild 

into the woods, except two or three favourites, which I kept 

tame, and whose young, when they had any, I always 



126 



ADVENTURES OF 



drowned, and these were part of my family. Besides these, 
I always kept two or three household kids about me, whom 
I taught to feed out of my hand; and I had two more 
parrots, which talked pretty well, and would all call Robin 
Crusoe, but none like my first, nor, indeed, did I take the 
pains with any of them that I had done with him. I had 
also several tame seafowls, whose names I knew not, that I 
caught upon the shore, and cut their wings.; and the little 
stakes which I had planted before my castle wall being now 
grown up to a thick grove, these fowls all lived among these 
low trees, and bred there, which was very agreeable to me : 
so that, as I said above, I began to be very well contented 
with the life I led, if I could have been secured from the 
dread of the savages. 

But it was otherwise directed ; and it may not be amiss 
for all people who shall meet with my story, to make this 
just observation from it, viz., how frequently, in the course 
of our lives, the evil which in itself we seek most to shun, 
and which, when we are fallen into, is the most dreadful to 
us, is oftentimes the very means or door of our deliverance, 
by which alone we can be raised again from the affliction 
we are fallen into. I could give many examples of this in 
the course of my unaccountable life, but in nothing was it 
more particularly remarkable than in the circumstances of 
my last years of solitary residence in this island. 



1. Gpck-pit. In the time of Crusoe, 
cock-pits were common in England. 
They were pits in which game-cocks

XXL— J/Oi?^ SURPRISES. 

I. Savages Again. — It was now the month of Decern* 
ber, as I said above, in my twenty-third year ; and this being 
the southern solstice^ (for winter I cannot call it), was the 
particular time of my harvest, and required my being pretty 
much abroad in the fields ; when going out pretty early in 
the morning, even before it was thorough daylight, I was 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 137 

surprised with seeing a light of some fire upon the shore, at 
a distance from me of about two miles, towards the end of 
the island where I had observed some savages had been as 
before ; and not on the other side, but, to my great affliction, 
it was on my side of the island. 

I was indeed terribly surprised at the sight, and stopped 
short within my grove, not daring to go out, lest I might be 
surprised ; and yet I had no more peace within, from the 
apprehensions I had that if the savages, in rambling over the 
i^and, should find my com standing or cut, or any of my 
works and improvements, they would immediately conclude 
that there were people in the place, and would then never 
give over till they had found me out In this extremity, I 
went back directly to my castle, pulled up the ladder after 
me, and made all things without look as wild and natural as 
I could. 

Then I prepared myself within, putting myself in a posture 

of defence : I loaded all my cannon, as I called them, that 

is to say, my muskets, which were mounted upon my new 

fortification, and all my pistols, and resolved to defend 

myself to the last gasp ; not forgetting seriously to commend 

myself to the divine protection, and earnestly to pray to 

God to deliver me out of the hands of the barbarians. I 

continued in this posture about two hours ; and began to be 

mighty impatient for intelligence abroad, for I had no spies 

to send out. After sitting awhile longer, and musing what 

I should do in this, I was not able to bear sitting in ignorance 

any longer; so setting up my ladder to the side of the hill, 

where there was a fiat place, as I observed before, and then 

pulling the ladder up after me, I set it up again, and mounted 

to the top of the hill : and pulling out my perspective glass, 

which I had taken on purpose, I laid me down fiat on my 

belly on the ground, and began to look for the place. I 

presently found there were no less than nine naked savages, 

sitting round a small fire they had made, not to warm them, 

for they had no need of that, the weather being extremely 

hot, but, as I supposed, to dress some of their barbarous 

diet of human flesh, which they had brought with them, 

whether alive or dead I could not tell. 

They had two canoes with them, which they had hauled 



128 ADVSNTURES OF 

up upon the shore ; and as it was then tide of ebb,^ they 
seemed to me to wait for the return of the flood to go away 
again. It is not easy to imagine what confusion this sight 
put me into^ especially seeing them come on my side of the 
island, and so near me too ; but when I considered their 
coming must be always with the current of the ebb, I began 
afterwards to be more sedate in my mind, being satisfled 
that I might go abroad with safety all the time of the tide of 
flood, if they were not on shore before ; and having made 
this observation, I went abroad about my harvest work with 
the more composure. 

As I expected, so it proved ; for as soon as the tide made 
to the westward, I saw them all take boat, and row (or paddle, 
as we call it) away. I should have observed, that for an 
hour or more before they went off", they went a-dancing ; and 
I could easily discern their postures and gestures by my 
glass. I could not perceive, by my nicest^ observation, but 
they were stark naked, and had not the least covering upon 
them ; but whether they were men or women, I could not 
distinguish. 

As soon as I saw them shipped and gone, I took two guns 
upon my shoulders, and two pistols in my girdle, and my 
great sword by my side, without a scabbard, and with all the 
speed I was able to make, went away to the hill where I had 
discovered the flrst appearance of all ; and as soon as I got 
thither, which was not in less than two hours (for I could 
not go apace, being so loaden with arms as I was), I perceived 
there had been three canoes more of savages at that place; 
and looking out farther, I saw they were all at sea together, 
making over for the main. This was a dreadful sight to me, 
especially as, going down to the shore, I could see the marks 
of horror, which the dismal work they had been about had 
left behind it, viz. the blood, the bones, and part of the flesh 
of human bodies, eaten and devoured by those wretches 
with merriment and sport. I was so flUed with indignation 
at the sight, that I now began to premeditate the destruction 
of the next that I saw there, let them be whom or how many 
soever. It seemed evident to me that the visits which they 
made thus to this island were not very frequent, for it was 
above fifteen months before any more of them came on shore 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 1 29 

there again ; that is to say, I neither saw them, nor any 
footsteps or signals of them, in all that time ; for as to rainy 
seasons, then they are sure not to come abroad, at least not 
so far : yet all this while I lived uncomfortably, by reason of 
the constant apprehensions of their coming upon me by 
surprise ; from whence I observe, that the expectation of evil 
is more bitter than the suffering, especially if there is no 
room to shake off that expectation, or those apprehensions. 
2. Sigrnals of Distress.-j-The perturbation of my 
mind during this fifteen or sixteen months' interval was 
very great; I slept unquiet, dreamed always frightful 
dreams, and often started out of my sleep in the night : in 
the day, great troubles overwhelmed my mind ; and in the 
night, I dreamed often of killing the savages, and of the 
reasons why I might justify the doing of it But to waive all 
this for a while. — It was in the middle of May, on the 
sixteenth day, I think, as well as my poor wooden calendar 
would reckon, for I marked all upon the post still — I say, 
it was on the sixteenth of May that it blew a very great 
storm of wind all day, with a great deal of lightning and 
thunder, and a very foul night it was after it. I knew not 
what was the particular occasion of it, but as I was reading 
in the Bible, and taken up with very serious thoughts about 
my present condition, I was surprised with the noise of a 
gun, as I thought, fired at sea. This was, to be sure, a sur- 
prise quite of a different nature from any I had met with 
before, for the notions this put into my thoughts were quite 
of another kind. I started up in the greatest haste imagin- 
able, and, in a trice,* clapped my ladder to the middle place 
of the rock, and pulled it after me ; and mounting it the 
second time, got to the top of the hill the very moment that 
a flash of fire bid me listen for a second gun, which accord- 
ingly, in about half a minute, I heard ; and, by the sound, 
knew that it was from that part of the sea where I was driven 
down the current in my boat. I immediately considered 
that this must be some ship in distress, and that they had 
some comrade, or some other ship in company, and fired 
these guns for signals of distress, and to obtain help. I had 
the presence of mind, at that minute, to think that though I 
could not help them, it might be they might help me : so I 

I 



130 ADVENTURES OF 

brought together all the dry wood I could get at hand, and 
making a good handsome pile, I set it on fire upon the 
hill. The wood was dry, and blazed freely ; and though the 
wind blew very hard, yet it burnt fairly out : so that I was 
certain, if there was any such thing as a ship, they must 
needs see it ; and no doubt they did, for as soon as ever 
my fire blazed up I heard another gun, and after that 
several others, all from the same quarter. I plied my fire 
all night long, till daybreak ; and when it was broad day, 
and the air cleared up, I saw something at a great distance 
at sea, full east of the island, whether a sail or a hull I could 
not distinguish, no, not with my glass ; the distance was so 
great, and the weather still something hazy also ; at least it 
was so out at sea. 

3. A Wreck. — I looked frequently at it all day, and 
soon perceived that it did not move ; so I presently con- 
cluded that it was a ship at anchor, and being eager, you 
may be sure, to be satisfied, I took my gun in my hand and 
ran towards the south side of the island, to the rocks where 
I had formerly been carried away with the current ; and 
getting up there, the weather by this time being perfectly 
clear, I could plainly see, to my great sorrow, the wreck of a 
ship, cast away in the night upon those concealed rocks 
which I found when I was out in my boat, and which rocks, 
as they checked the violence of the stream, and made a kind 
of counter-stream, or eddy, were the occasion of my recover- 
ing from the most desperate, hopeless condition that ever I 
had been in in all my life. Thus, what is one man's safety 
is another man's destruction, for it seems these men, who- 
ever they were, being out of their knowledge, and the rocks 
being wholly under water, had been driven upon them in the 
night, the wind blowing hard E.N.E. There was not the 
least sign of any living creature on board. All, I feared, 
had certainly perished. 

A strange longing now seized my soul that one at least 
might have escaped to be my companion. Such were 
my earnest wishings that but one man had been saved, that 
I believe I repeated the words, " O that it had been but 
one 1 " a thousand times ; and my desires were so moved 
by it, that when I spoke the words my hands would clinch 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. I3I 

together, and my fingers would press the palms of my hands 
so, that if I had had any soft thing in my hand it would 
have crushed it involuntarily ; and the teeth in my head 
would strike together, and set against one another so strong, 
that for some time I could not part them again. 

Let the naturalists explain these things, and the reason 
and manner of them : all I can say to them is, to describe 
the fact, which was even surprising to me, when I found it, 
though I knew not from whence it proceeded: it was doubt- 
less the effect of ardent wishes, and of strong ideas formed 
in my mind, realising the comfort which the conversation 
of one of my fellow-Christians would have been to me. 

But it was not to be ; either their fate or mine, or both, 
forbade it : for till the last year of my being on this island, 
I never knew whether any were saved out of that ship or 
no ; and had only the affliction, some days after, to see the 
corpse of a drowned boy come on shore at the end of the 
island which was next the shipwreck. He had no clothes 
on but a seaman's waistcoat, a pair of open-kneed linen 
drawers, and a blue linen shirt ; but nothing to direct me 
so much as to guess what nation he was of: he had 
nothing in his pockets but two pieces-of-eight and a tobacco 
pipe : the last was to me of ten times more value than the 
first 

After much hesitation and great preparation, I ventured 
to set sail for the wreck in my canoe. And in less than two 
hours I reached it. It was a dismal sight to look at : the 
shipi which, by its building, was Spanish, stuck fast, jammed 
in between two rocks ; all the stem and quarter of her were 
beaten to pieces with the sea ; and as her forecastle, which 
stuck in the rocks, had run on with great violence, her 
mainmast and foremast were brought by the board, that is to 
say, broken short off ; but her bowsprit was sound, and the 
head and bow appeared firm. When I came close to her, 
a dog appeared upon her, who, seeing me coming, yelped, 
and cried ; and as soon as I called him jumped into the sea 
to come to me. I took him into the boat, but found him 
almost dead with hunger and thirst. I gave him a cake of 
my bread, and he devoured it like a ravenous wolf that had 
been starving a fortnight in the snow. I then gave the poor 



132 ADVENTURES OF 

creature some fresh water, with which, if I would have let 
him, he would have burst himself. After this, I went on 
board ; but the first sight I met with was two men drowned 
in the cook-room, or forecastle of the ship, with their arms 
fast about one another. I concluded, as is indeed probable, 
that when the ship struck, it being in a storm, the sea broke 
so high, and so continually over her, that the men were not 
able to bear it, and were strangled^ with the constant rushing 
in of the water, as much as if they had been under water. 

Besides the dog, there was nothing left in the ship that 
had life ; nor any goods, that I could see, but what were 
spoiled by the water. There were some casks of liquor, 
whether wine or brandy I knew not, which lay lower in the 
hold, and which, the water being cleared out, I could see ; 
but they were too big to meddle with. I saw several chests, 
which I believed belonged to some of the seamen ; and I 
got two of them into the boat, without examining what was 
in them. I found, besides these chests, a little cask full of 
liquor, of about twenty gallons, which I got into my boat 
with much difficulty. There were several muskets in the 
cabin, and a great powder-horn, with about foiu: pounds of 
powder in it : as for the muskets, I had no occasion for 
them, so I left them, but took the powder-horn. I took a. 
fire-shovel and tongs, which I wanted extremely; as also 
two little brass kettles, a copper pot to make chocolate, and^ 
a gridiron : and with this cargo, and the dog, I came away, - 
the tide beginning to make home again ; and the same= 
evening, about an hour within night, I reached the island - 
again, weary and fatigued to the last degree. 

4. Once More Ashore. — I reposed that night in the== 

boat ; and in the morning I resolved to harbour what I had 

got in my new cave, and not carry it home to my castle. 
After refreshing myself, I got all my cargo on shore, 
and began to examine the particulars. The cask of liquor 
I found to be a kind of rum, but not such as we had at^ 
the Brazils, and, in a word, not at all good; but when I earner 
to open the chests, I found several things of great use to me : 
for example, I found in one a fine case of bottles, oE' 
an extraordinary kind, and filled with cordial waters, fine and 
very good; the bottles held about three pints each, and 



i 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 1 33 

were tipped with silver. I found two pots of very good 
succades or sweetmeats, so fastened also on the top that 
the salt water had not hurt them ; and two more of the same, 
which the water had spoiled. I found some very good shirts, 
which were very welcome to me ; and about a dozen and a 
half of white linen handkerchiefs and coloured neckcloths ; 
the former were also very welcome, being exceeding refreshing 
to wipe my face in a hot day. Besides this, when I came to 
the till in the chest, I found there three great bags of pieces 
of eight, which held about eleven hundred pieces in all ; and 
m one of them, wrapped up in paper, six doubloons^ of gold 
and some small bars or wedges of gold : I suppose they might 
all weigh near a pound. In the other chest were some 
clothes, but of little value : but, by the circumstances, it 
must have belonged to the gunnei^s mate ; though there was 
no powder in it, except two pounds of fine glazed powder, in 
three small flasks, kept, I suppose, for charging their fowling- 
pieces on occasion. 

Upon the whole, I got very little by this voyage that was 
of any use to me : for, as to the money, I had no manner of 
occasion for it ; it was to me as the dirt under my feet ; 
and I would have given it all for three or four pair of 
English shoes and stockings, which were things I greatly 
wanted, but had not had on my feet now for many years. 
I had indeed got two pair of shoes now, which I took off the 
feet of the two drowned men whom I saw in the wreck, 
and I found two pair more in one of the chests, which were 
very welcome to me; but they were not like our English 
shoes, either for ease or service, being rather what we call 
pumps than shoes. I found in this ' seaman's chest about 
fifty pieces-of-eight, but no gold : I suppose this belonged 
to a poorer man than the other, which seemed to belong 
to some officer. Well, however, I lugged this money 
home to my cave, and laid it up, as I had done that before 
which I brought from our own ship. 

Having now brought all my things on shore, and secured 
them, I went back to my boat, and rowed or paddled her 
along the shore to her old harbour, where I laid her up, and 
made the best of my way to my old habitation, where I 
found every thing safe and quiet. I began now to repose

myself, live after my old fashion, and take care of my family 
affairs. I lived in this condition near two years more ; but 
my unlucky head, that was always to let me know that it was 
born to make my body miserable, was all these two years 
filled with projects and designs how, if it were possible, 
I might get away from this island.

XXll.— ROBINSON GETS A COMPANION. 

I. A Remarkable Dream. — I am now to be supposed 
retired into my castle, after my late voyage to the wreck, 
my frigate laid up and secured under water as usual, and 
my condition restored to what it was before. I had more 
wealth, indeed, than I had before, but was not at all the 
richer; for I had no more use for it than the Indians of 
Peru had before the Spaniards came there. 

It was one of the nights in the rainy season in March, the 
four-and-twentieth year of my first setting foot in this island 
of solitude, I was lying in my bed, or hammock, awake; 
very well in health, had no pain, no distemper, no uneasiness 
of body, nor any uneasiness of mind, more than ordinary, 
but could by no means close my eyes, that is, so as to sleep : 
no, not a wink, till- the night was almost spent. It is 
impossible to set down the innumerable crowd of thoughts 
that whirled through that great thoroughfare of the brain, the 
memory, in this night's time : I ran over the whole history 
of my life in miniature, or by abridgment, as I may call 
it, to my coming to this island, and also of that part of my life 
since I came to this island. 

At last I fell into a sound sleep and dreamed that as I 
was going out, as usual, from my castle, I saw upon the 
shore two canoes and eleven savages coming to land, and 
that they brought with them another savage, whom they 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 1 35 

were going to kill, in order to eat him ; when, on a sudden, 
the savage that they were going to kill jumped away, and 
ran for his life ; and I thought, in my sleep, that he came 
running into my little thick grove before my fortification, to 
hide himself; and that I, seeing him alone, and not per- 
ceiving that the others sought him that way, showed myself 
to him, and smiling upon him, encouraged him : that he 
kneeled down to me, seeming to pray me to assist him ; 
upon which I showed him my ladder, made him go up, 
and carried him into my cave, and he became my servant : 
and that as soon as I had got this man, I said to myself, 
Now I may certainly venture to the main land ; for this 
fellow will serve me as a pilot, and will tell me what to do, 
and whither to go for provisions, and whither not to go for 
fear of being devoured ; what places to venture into, and 
what to shun. 

I waked with this thought; and was under such inex- 
pressible impressions of joy at the prospect of my escape 
in my dream, that the disappointments which I felt upon 
coming to myself, and finding that it was no more than a 
dream, were equally extravagant the other way, and threw 
me into a very great dejection of spirits. Upon this, how- 
ever, I made this conclusion : that my only way to go 
about to attempt an escape was, if possible, to get a savage 
into my possession ; and, if possible, it should be one of their 
prisoners whom they had condemned to be eaten, and 
should bring hither to kill. 

2. A Run for Life. — ^About a year and a half after I 
entertained these notions (and by long musing had, as it 
were, resolved them all into nothing, for want of an occasion 
to put them into execution), I was surprised, one morning 
early, with seeing no less than five canoes all on shore 
together on my side the island, and the people who belonged 
to them all landed, and out of my sight. The number 
of them broke all my measures ; for seeing so many, and 
knowing that they always came four or six, or sometimes 
more, in a boat, I could not tell what to think of it, or how 
to take my measures, to attack twenty or thirty men single- 
handed ; so lay still in my castle, perplexed and discom- 
forted : however, I put myself into all the same postures 



136 ADVENTURES OF 

for an attack that I had formerly provided, and was just 
ready for action, if anything had presented. Having 
waited a good while, listening to hear if they made any 
noise, at length, being very impatient, I set my guns at the 
foot of my ladder, and clambered up to the top of the hill, 
by my two stages, as usual ; standing so, however, that my 
head did not appear above the hill, so that they could not 
perceive me by any means. Here I observed, by the help 
of my perspective glass, that they were no less than thirty 
in number ; that they had a fire kindled, and that they had 
meat dressed. How they had cooked it I knew not, or 
what it was ; but they were all dancing, in I know not how 
many barbarous gestures and figures, their own way, round 
the fire. 

While I was thus looking on them, I perceived, by my 
perspective glass, two miserable wretches dragged from the 
boats, where, it seems, they were laid by, and were now 
brought out for the slaughter. I perceived one of them 
immediately fall, being knocked down, I suppose, with a 
club or wooden sword, for that was their way, and two or 
three 'others were at work immediately, cutting him open 
for their cookery, while the other victim was left standing 
by himself, till they should be ready for him. In that very 
moment, this poor wrietch seeing himself a little at liberty, 
and unbound, nature inspired him with hopes of life, and 
he started away from them, and ran with incredible swift- 
ness along the sands, directly towards me, I mean towards 
that part of the coast where my habitation was. I was 
dreadfully frightened, I must acknowledge, when I per- 
ceived him run my way, and especially when, as I thought^ 
I saw him pursued by the whole body. And now I expected^ 
that part of my dream was coming to pass, and that he^ 
would certainly take shelter in my grove ; but I could not::^ 
depend, by any means, upon my dream for the rest of it^ 
viz. that the other savages would not pursue him thither^ 
and find him there. However, I kept my station, and m)r 
spirits began to recover, when I found that there was not 
above three men that followed him ; and still more was t 
encouraged when I found that he outstripped them ex- 
ceedingly in running, and gained ground of them, so that 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 137 

if he could but hold it for half an hour, I saw easily he 
would fairly get away from them all. 

There was between them and my castle the creek, which 
I mentioned often in the first part of my story, where I 
landed my cargoes out of the ship ; and this I saw plainly 
he must necessarily swim over, or the poor wretch would 
be taken there. But when the savage escaping came thither, 
he made nothing of it, though the tide was then up ; but 
plunging in, swam through in about thirty strokes, or there- 
abouts, landed, and ran on with exceeding strength and 
swiftness. When the three persons came to the creek, I 
found that two of them could swim, but the third could 
not, and that, standing on the other side, he looked at the 
others, but went no farther, and soon after went softly back 
again ; which, as it happened, was very well for him in the 
end. I observed that the two who swam were yet more 
than twice as long swimming over the creek as the fellow 
was that fled from them. 

3. Crusoe to the Rescue. — It came now very 
warmly upon my thoughts, and indeed irresistibly, that now 
was the time to get me a servant, and perhaps a companion 
or assistant, and that I was called plainly by Providence to 
save this poor creature's life. I immediately ran down the 
ladders, with all possible expedition, fetched my two guns, 
for they were both at the foot of the ladders, as I observed 
above, and getting up again, with the same haste, to the 
top of the hill, I crossed toward the sea, and having a very 
short cut, and all downhill, placed myself in the way 
between the pursuers and the pursued, hallooing aloud to 
him that fled, who, looking back, was at first, perhaps, as 
much frightened at me as them ; but I beckoned with my 
hand to him to come back ; and, in the meantime, I slowly 
advanced towards the two that followed : then rushing at 
once upon the foremost, I knocked him down with the stock 
of my piece. I was loath to fire, because I would not have 
the rest hear ; though, at that distance, it would not have 
been easily heard, and being out of sight of the smoke too, 
they would not have easily known what to make of it. 

Having knocked this fellow down, the other who pursued 
him stopped, as if he had been frightened, and I advanced 



138 ADVENTURES OF 

apace towards him: but as I came nearer, I perceived 
presently he had a bow and arrow, and was fitting it to 
shoot at me : so I was then necessitated to shoot at him 
first, which I did, and killed him at the first shot. 

The poor savage who fled but had stopped, though he 
saw both his enemies fallen and killed, as he thought, yet 
was so frightened with the fire and noise of my piece, that 
he stood stock still, and neither came forward nor went 
backward, though he seemed rather inclined still to fly than 
to come on. I hallooed again to him, and made signs to 
come forward, which he easily understood, and came a little 
way ; then he stopped again, and then a little farther, and 
stopped again ; and I could then perceive that he stood 
trembling, as if he had been taken prisoner, and had just 
been to be killed, as his two enemies were. I beckoned to 
him again to come to me, and gave him all the signs of 
encouragement that I could think of ; and he came nearer 
and nearer, kneeling down every ten or twelve steps, in 
token of acknowledgment for saving his life. I smiled at 
him, and looked pleasantly, and beckoned to him to come 
still nearer : at length he came close to me ; and then he 
kneeled down again, kissed the ground, and laid his head 
upon the ground, and taking me by the foot, set my foot 
upon his head : this, it seems, was in token of swearing to 
be my slave for ever. I took him up, and made much of 
him, and encouraged him all I could. 

But there was more work to do yet ; for I perceived the 
savage whom I knocked down was not killed, but stunned 
with the blow, and began to come to himself : so I pointed 
to him, and showed him the savage, that he was not dead : 
upon this he spoke some words to me, and though I could 
not understand them, yet I thought they were pleasant to 
hear ; for they were the first sound of a man's voice that I 
had heard, my own excepted, for above twenty-five years. 
But there was no time for such reflections now ; the savage 
who was knocked down recovered himself so far as to sit 
Jip upon the ground, and I perceived that my savage began 
to be afraid ; but when I saw that, I presented my other 
piece at the man, as if I would shoot him : upon this my 
^^vage, for so 1 call him now, made a motion to me to lend 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 139 

him my sword which hung naked in a belt by my side, 
which I did. He no sooner had it, but he runs to his 
enemy, and, at one blow, cut off his head so cleverly, no 
executioner in Germany could have done it sooner or 
better; which I thought very strange for one who, I had 
reason to believe, never saw a sword in his life before, 
except their own wooden swords : however, it seems, as I 
learned afterwards, they make their wooden swords so 
sharp, so heavy, and the wood is so hard, that they will cut 
off heads even with them, ay, and arms, and that at one 
blow too. When he had done this, he comes laughing to 
me, in sign of triumph, and brought me the sword again, 
and with abundance of gestures, which I did not under- 
stand, laid it down, with the head of the savage that he had 
killed, just before me. 

But that which astonished him most was to know how I 
killed the other Indian so far off : so pointing to him, he 
made signs to me to let him go to him ; so I bade him go, 
as well as I could. When he came to him, he stood like 
one amazed, looking at him, turning him first one side, then 
on the other, looked at the wound the bullet had made, 
which, it seems, was just in his breast, where it had made a 
hole, and no great quantity of blood had followed, but he 
had bled inwardly, for he was quite dead. He took up his 
bow and arrows, and came back ; so I turned to go away, 
and beckoned him to follow me, making signs to him that 
more might come after them. 

Upon this, he made signs to me that he should bury them 
with sand, that they might not be seen by the rest, if they 
followed ; and so I made signs to him again to do so. He 
fell to work ; and, in an instant, he had scraped a hole in 
the sand with his hands, big enough to bury the first in, and 
then dragged him into it, and covered him ; and did so by 
the other also : I believe he had buried them both in a 
quarter of an hour. Then calling him away, I carried him, 
not to my castle, but quite away, to my cave, on the farther 
part of the island : so I did not let my dream come to pass 
in that part, viz. that he came into my grove for shelter. 
Here I gave him bread and a bunch of raisins to eat, and a 
draught of water, which I found he was indeed in great 



140 ADVENTURES OF 

distress for, by his running ; and having refreshed him, I 
made signs for him to go and lie down to sleep, showing 
him a place where I had laid some rice straw, and a 
blanket upon it, which I used to sleep upon myself some- 
times ; so the poor creature lay down, and went to sleepi 

4. Friday. — He was a comely, handsome fellow, per- 
fectly well made, with straight, strong limbs, not too laigei 
tall, and well-shaped, and, as I reckon, about twenty-six 
years of age. He had a very good countenance, not a fierce 
and surly aspect; but seemed to have something veiy 
manly in his face ; and yet he had all the sweetness and 
softness of a European in his countenance too, especially 
when he smiled. His hair was long and black, not curled 
like wool ; his forehead very high and large ; and a great 
vivacity and sparkling sharpness in his eyes. The colour 
of his skin was not quite black, but very tawny ;^ and yet 
not an ugly, yellow, nauseous tawny, as the Brazilians and 
Virginians, and other natives of America are, but of a bright 
kind of a dun^ olive-colour, that had in it something very 
agreeable, though not very easy to describe. His face was 
round and plump ; his nose small, not flat like the Negroes; 
a very good mouth, thin lips, and his fine teeth wdl set, 
and as white as ivory. 

After he had slumbered, rather than slept, about half an 
hour he awoke again, and came out of the cave to me, for 
I had been milking my goats, which I had in the enclosure 
just by : when he espied me, he came running to me, laying 
himself down again upon the ground, with all the possible 
signs of an humble, thankful disposition, making a great 
many antic gestures^ to show it. At last, he lays his head 
flat upon the ground, close to my foot, and sets my other 
foot upon his head, as he had done before ; and after this 
made all the signs to me of subjection, servitude, and sub- 
mission imaginable, to let me know how he would serve 
me as long as he lived. I understood him in many things, 
and let him know I was very well pleased with him. In a 
little time I began to speak to him and teach him to speak 
to me; and, first, I let him know his name should be 
Friday, which was the day I saved his life : I called him 
so for the memory of the time. I likewise taught him to 




CRUSOE MEETING WITH FRTDAV. 



i 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. I4I 

say Master ; and then let him know that was to be my 
name : I likewise taught him to say Yes and No, and to 
know the meaning of them. I gave him some milk in an 
earthen pot, and let him see me drink it before him, and 
sop my bread in it ; and gave him a cake of bread to do 
the like, which he quickly complied with, and made signs 
that it was very good for him. 

I kept there with him all that night ; but as soon as it 
was day, I beckoned to him to come with me, and let him 
bow I would give him some clothes : at which he seemed 
ve7 glad, for he was stark naked. As we went by the 
place where he had buried the two men, he pointed exactly 
to the place, and showed me the marks that he had made 
to find them again, making signs to me that we should dig 
them up again, and eat them. At this I appeared very 
angry, expressed my abhorrence at it, made as if I would 
vomit at the thoughts of it, and beckoned with my hand to 
him to come away, which he did immediately, with great 
submission. I then led him up to the top of the hill, to 
see if his enemies were gone ; and pulling out my glass, I 
looked, and saw plainly the place where they had been, but 
no appearance of them or their canoes : so that it was plain 
that they were gone, and had left their two comrades behind 
them, without any search after them. 

But I was not content with this discovery ; but having 

now more courage, and consequently more curiosity, I took 

niy man Friday with me, giving him the sword in his hand, 

with the bow and arrows at his back, which I found he 

could use very dexterously, making him carry one gun for 

me, and I two for myself; and away we marched to the 

place where these creatures had been, for I had a mind now 

to get some fuller intelligence of them. When I came to 

the place, my very blood ran chill in my veins, and my 

heart sank within me, at the horror of the spectacle ; 

indeed, it was a dreadful sight, at least it was so to me, 

though Friday made nothing of it. The place was covered 

with human bones, the ground dyed with their blood, and 

great pieces of flesh left here and there, half-eaten, 

mangled, and scorched ; and, in short, all the tokens of the 

triumphant feast they had been making there, after a 



142 



ADVENTURES OF 



victory over their enemies. I saw three sculls, five hands, 
and the bones of three or four legs and feet, and abundance 
of other parts of the bodies ; and Friday, by his signs, 
made me understand that they brought over four prisoners 
to feast upon ; that three of them were eaten up, and that 
he, pointing to himself, was the fourth ; that there had 
been a great battle between them and their next king,* 
whose subjects, it seems, he had been one of, and that they 
had taken a great number of prisoners; all which were 
carried to several places by those who had taken them in 
the fight, in order to feast upon them, as was done here by 
these wretches upon those they brought hither. 

I caused Friday to gather up all the sculls, bones, flesh, 
and whatever remained, and lay them together in a heap, 
and make a great fire upon it, and bum them all to ashes. 
I found Friday had still a hankering stomach after some of 
the flesh, and was still a cannibal in his nature ; but I 
discovered so much abhorrence at the very thoughts of it, 
and at the least appearance of it, that he durst not dis- 
cover it : for I had, by some means, let him know that I 
would kill him if he offered it

^KXlll.—ROBINSON INSTRUCTS FRIDAY. 

I. Friday is Provided for. — ^When we had done 
this, we came back to our castle ; and there I fell to work 
for my man Friday : and, first of all, I gave him a pair of 
linen drawers, which I had out of the poor gunner's chest 
I mentioned which I found in the wreck, and which, with 
a little alteration, fitted him very well, and then I made 
him a jerkin^ of goat's skin, as well as my skill would allow 
(for I was now grown a tolerable^ good tailor) ; and I gave 
him a cap, which I made of hare's skin, very convenient 
and fashionable enough ; and thus he was clothed for the 
present tolerably well, and was mighty well pleased to see 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 1 43 

himself almost as well clothed as his master. It is true, 
he went awkwardly in those clothes at first : wearing the 
drawers was very awkward to him, and the sleeves of the 
waistcoat galled his shoulders and the inside of his arms ; 
but after a little easing them where he complained they 
hurt him, and using himself to them, he took to them at 
length very well 

The next day after I came home to my hutch with him, 
1 began to consider where I should lodge him ; and that I 
might do well for him, and yet be perfectly easy myself, I 
made a little tent for him in the vacant place between my 
two fortifications, in the inside of the last and in the out- 
side of the first As there was a door or entrance there 
into my cave, I made a formal framed doorcase, and a door 
to it of boards, and set it up in the passage, a little within 
the entrance ; and causing the door to open in the inside, I 
barred it up in the night, taking in my ladders too ; so that 
Friday could no way come at me in the inside of my inner- 
most wall, without making so much noise in getting over 
that it must needs waken me : for my first wall had now a 
Complete roof over it of long poles, covering all my tent, 
^jid leaning up to the side of the hill ; which was again 
^aid across with smaller sticks, instead of laths, and then 
thatched over a great thickness with the rice- straw, which 
^as strong, like reeds ; and at the hole or place which was 
l^ft to go in or out by the ladder, I had placed a kind of 
t:rap door, which, if it had been attempted on the outside, 
'^ould not have opened at all, but would have fallen down, 
^nd made a great noise : as to weapons, I took them all 
into my side every night. But I needed none of all this 
t)recaution; for never man had a more faithful, loving, 
sincere servant than Friday was to me ; without passions,^ 
^uUenness, or designs, perfectly obliged and engaged^ — his 
very affections wertf tied to me, like those of a child to a 
father ; and I dare say he would have sacrificed his life for 
the saving mine upon any occasion whatsoever : the many 
testimonies he gave me of this put it out of doubt, and 
soon convinced me that I needed to use no precautions as 
to my safety on his account 

I was greatly delighted with my new companion, and 



144 ADVENTURES OF 

made it my business to teach him everything that was 
proper to make him useful, handy, and helpful; but 
especially to make him speak, and understand me when I 
spoke : and he was the aptest scholar that ever was, and 
particularly was so merry, so constantly diligent, and so 
pleased when he could but understand me, or make me 
understand him, that it was very pleasant to me to talk to 
him. Now my life began to be so easy, that I began to say 
to myself, that could I but have been safe from more 
savages, I cared not if I was never to remove from the 
place where I lived. 

2. Friday is Lost in Amazement.— After I had 
been two or three days returned to my castle, I thought 
that, in order to bring Friday off from his horrid way of 
feeding, and from the relish of a cannibal's stomach, I 
ought to let him taste other flesh ; so I took him out with 
me one morning to the woods. I went, indeed, intending 
to kill a kid out of my own flock, and bring it home and 
dress it ; but as I was going, I saw a she-goat lying down 
in the shade, and two young kids sitting by her. I catched 
hold of Friday : " Hold," said I ; " stand still ; " and made 
signs to him not to stir : immediately I presented my piece, 
shot, and killed one of the kids. The poor creature, who 
had, at a distance, indeed, seen me kill the savage, his 
enemy, but did not know, nor could imagine, how it was 
done, was sensibly surprised, trembled and shook, and 
looked so amazed, that I thought he would have sunk down. 
He did not see the kid I shot at, or perceived I had killed 
it, but ripped up his waistcoat, to feel whether he was not 
wounded, and, as I found presently, thought I was resolved 
to kill him : for he came and kneeled down to me, and 
embracing my knees, said a great many things I did not 
understand; but I could easily see the meaning was, to 
pray me not to kill him. 

I soon found a way to convince him that I would do 
him no harm ; and taking him up by the hand, laughed at 
him, and pointing to the kid which I had killed, beckoned 
to him to run and fetch it, which he did ; and while he was 
wondering, and looking to see how the creature was killed, 
I loaded my gun again. By-and-by I saw a great fowl, 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 1 45 

like a hawk, sitting upon a tree, within shot ; so, to let 
Friday understand a little what I would do, I called him to 
me again, pointed at the fowl, which was indeed a parrot, 
though I thought it had been a hawk ; I say, pointing to 
the parrot, and to my gun, and to the ground under the 
parrot, to let him see I would make it fall, I made him 
understand that I would shoot and kill that bird : 
accordingly, I fired, and bade him look, and immediately 
he saw the parrot fall. He stood like one frightened again, 
notwithstanding all I had said to him ; and I found he was 
the more amazed, because he did not see me put anything 
into the gun, but thought that there must be some wonder- 
ful fund of death and destruction in that thing, able to kill 
man, beast, or bird, or anything near or far off; and the 
astonishment this created in him was such as could not 
wear off for a long time ; and I believe, if I would have let 
Mm, he would have worshipped me and my gun. As for 
the gun itself, he would not so much as touch it for several 
days after; but he would speak to it, and talk to it, 
as if it had answered him, when he was by himself; which, 
as I afterwards learned of him, was to desire it not to kill 
him. 

Well, after his astonishment was a little over at this, I 
pointed to him to run and fetch the bird I had shot, which 
he did, but stayed some time ; for the parrot, not being 
quite dead, had fluttered away a good distance from the 
place where she fell. However, he found her, took her up, 
and brought her to me ; and as I had perceived his 
ignorance about the gun before, I took this advantage to 
charge the gun again, and not to let him see me do it, that 
I might be ready for any other mark that might present ; 
but nothing more offered at that time. 

3. Lessons in Civilisation. — I brought home the 
kid, and the same evening I took the skin off, and cut it 
out as well as I could; and having a pot fit for that 
purpose, I boiled or stewed some of the flesh, and made 
some very good broth. After I had begun to eat some, I 
gave some to my man, who seemed very glad of it, and 
liked it very well : but that which was strangest to him was 
to see me eat salt with it. He made a sign to me that the 



146 ADVENTURES OF 

salt was not good to eat; and putting a little into his 
mouth, he seemed to nauseate it, and would spit and 
sputter at it, washing his mouth with fresh water after it : 
on the other hand, I took some meat into my mouth with- 
out salt, and I pretended to spit and sputter for want of 
salt, as fast as he had done at the salt; but it would not 
do ; he would never care for salt with his meat or in his 
broth — at least, not for a great while, and then but very 
little. 

Having thus fed him with boiled meat and broth, I was 
resolved to feast him the next day with roasting a piece of 
the kid : this I did by hanging it before the fire on a 
string, as I had seen many people do in England, setting 
two poles up, one on each side of the fire, and one across 
on the top, and tying the string to the cross stick,. letting 
the meat turn continually. This Friday admired very 
much : but when he came to taste the flesh, he took so 
many ways to tell me how well he liked it, that I could not 
but understand him ; and at last he told me, as well as he 
could, he would never eat man*s flesh any more, which I 
was very glad to hear. 

The next day I set him to work to beating some corn out, 
and sifting it in a manner I used to do, as I observed before; 
and he soon understood how to do it as well as I, especially 
after he had seen what the meaning of it was, and that it 
was to make bread of it : for after that I let him see me 
make my bread, and bake it too ; and in a little time 
Friday was able to do all the work for me, as well as I 
could do it myself. 

I began now to consider, that having two mouths to feed 
instead of one, I must provide more ground for my harvest, 
and plant a larger quantity of corn than I used to do : so I 
marked out a larger piece of land, and began the fence in 
the same manner as before, in which Friday worked not 
only very willingly and very hard, but did it very cheerfully. 
And I told him what it was for ; that it was for corn to make 
more bread, because he was now with me, and that I might 
have enough for him and myself too. He appeared very 
sensible^ of that part, and let me know that he thought I 
had much more labour upon me on his account than I had 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. I47 

for myself; and that he would work the harder for me, if I 
would tell him what to do. 

This was the pleasantest year of all the life I led in this 
place. Friday began to talk pretty well, and understand 
the names of almost every thing I had occasion to call for, 
and of every place I had to send him to, and talked a great 
deal to me : so that, in short, I began now to have some 
use for my tongue again, which, indeed, I had very little 
occasion for before, that is to say, about speech. Besides 
the pleasure of talking to him, I had a singular satisfaction 
m the fellow himself: his simple, unfeigned honesty ap- 
peared to me more and more every day, and I began really 
to love the creature ; and, on his side, I believe he loved 
me more than it was possible for him ever to love any thing 
before. 

4. A Curious Dialogue. — I had a mind once to try 
if he had any hankering inclination to his own country 
again ; and having taught him English so well that he could 
answer me almost any question, I asked him whether the 
nation that he belonged to never conquered in battle ? At 
which he smiled, and said, " Yes, yes, we always fight the 
better : " that is, he meant, always get the better in fight ; 
and so we began the following discourse : — 

Master. " You always fight the better ? how came you 
to be taken prisoner then, Friday ? " 
Friday. " My nation beat much, for all that." 
Master. " How beat ? If your nation beat them, how 
came you to be taken ? " 

Friday. " They more many than my nation in the place 
where me was ; they take one, two, three, and me ; my 
nation overheat them in the yonder place, where me no 
was ; there my nation take one, two, great thousand** 

Master. " But why did not your side recover you from 
the hands of your enemies, then ? " 

Friday. " They run one, two, three, and me, and make 

me go in the canoe; my nation have no canoe that time.', 

Master. " Well, Friday, and what does your nation do 

with the men they take ? Do they carry them away and eat 

them, as these did ? " 

Friday, " Yes, my nation eat mans too ; eat all up." 



148 ADVENTURES OF 

Master. ** Where do they carry them ? ** 

Friday. " Go to other place, where they think." 

Master. " Do they come hither ? " 

Friday. "Yes, yes, they come hither; come other else 
place." 

Master. " Have you been here with them ? " 

Friday. "Yes, I have been here" (points to the N.W. 
side of the island, which, it seems, was their side). 

By this I understood that my man Friday had formerly 
been among the savages who used to come on shore on the 
farther part of the island, on the same man-eating occasions 
he was now brought for : and some time after, when I took 
the courage to carry him to that side, being the same I 
formerly mentioned, he presently knew the place, and told 
me he was there once when they ate up twenty men, two 
women, and one child : he could not tell twenty in English, 
but he numbered them, by laying so many stones in a row, 
and pointing to me to tell them over. 

I have told this passage because it introduces what 
follows ; that after I had this discourse with him, I asked 
him how far it was from our island to the shore, and 
whether the canoes were not often lost. He told me there 
was no danger, no canoes ever lost ; but that, after a little 
way out to sea, there was a current and wind, always one 
way in the morning, the other in the afternoon. This I 
understood to be no more than the sets of the tide, as going 
out or coming in ; but I afterwards understood it was oc- 
casioned by the great draught and reflux^ of the mighty river 
Orinoco, in the mouth or gulf of which river, as I found 
afterwards, our island lay ; and that this land which I per- 
ceived to the W. and N.W. was the great island Trinidad, 
on the north point of the mouth of the river. I asked 
Friday a thousand questions about the country, the in- 
habitants, the sea, the coast, and what nations were near: 
he told me all he knew, with the greatest openness imagin- 
able. I asked him the names of the several nations of his 
sort of people, but could get no other name than Caribs : 
from whence I easily understood, that these were the 
Caribbees, which our maps place on the part of America 
which reaches from the mouth of the river Orinoco to 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 



149 



Guiana, and onwards to St. Martha. He told me that up 
a great way beyond the moon, that was, beyond the setting 
of the moon, which must be west from their country, there 
dwelt white bearded men like me, and pointed to my great 
whiskers, which I mentioned before ; and that they had 
killed much mans — that was his word : by all which I under- 
stood, he meant the Spaniards, whose cruelties in America 
had been spread over the whole country, and were remem- 
bered by all the nations, from father to son. 

I inquired if he could tell me how I might go from this 
island and get among those white men : he told me, " Yes, yes, 
you may go in two canoe." I could not understand what he 
meant, or make him describe to me what he meant by " two 
canoe ; " till, at last, with great difficulty, I found he meant 
it must be in a large boat, as big as two canoes. This part 
of Friday's discourse began to relish with me very well ; 
and from this time I entertained some hopes that, one time 
or other, I might find an opportunity to make my escape 
from this place, and that this poor savage might be a means 
to help me.

^SXIN.— PREPARATIONS FOR MIGRATING. 

I. A Talk Between Two Friends. — After Friday 
and I became more intimately acquainted, and that he could 
understand almost all I said to him, and speak pretty 
fluently, though in broken English, to me, I acquainted him 
with my own history, or at least so much of it as related to 
my coming to this place ; how I had lived here, and how 
long : I let him into the mystery, for such it was to him, of 
gunpowder and bullet, and taught him how to shoot. I 



150 ADVENTURES OF 

gave him a knife, which he was delighted with ; and I made 
him a belt with a frog^ hanging to it, such as in England we 
wear hangers in ; and in the frog, instead of a hanger,^ I 
gave him a hatchet, which was not only as good a weapon, 
in some cases, but much more useful upon other occasions. 

I described to him the country of Europe, particularly 
England, which I came from ; how we lived, how we wor- 
shipped God, how we behaved to one another, and how we 
traded in ships to all parts of the world. I gave him an 
account of the wreck which I had been on board of, and 
showed him, as near as I could, the place where she lay ; 
but she was all beaten in pieces before and gone. I showed 
him the ruins of our boat, which we lost when we escaped, 
and which I could not stir with my whole strength then; 
but was now fallen almost all to pieces. Upon seeing this 
boat, Friday stood musing a great while, and said nothing. 
I asked him what it was he studied upon ? At last, says 
he, " Me see such boat like come to place at my nation." I 
did not understand him a good while ; but, at last, when I 
had examined farther into it, I understood him, that a boat, 
such as that had been, came on shore upon the country 
where he lived; that is, as he explained it, was driven 
thither by stress of weather. I presently imagined that 
some European ship must have been cast away upon their 
coast, and the boat might get loose, and drive ashore ; but 
was so dull, that I never once thought of men making 
their escape from a wreck thither, much less whence they 
might come : so I only inquired after a description of the 
boat. 

Friday described the boat to me well enough; but 
brought me better to understand him when he added, with 
some warmth, " We save the white mans from drown." 
Then I presently asked him, if there were any white mans, 
as he called them, in the boat ? " Yes," he said ; " the 
boat full of white mans.'* I asked him, how many ? He 
told upon his fingers seventeen. I asked him then, what 
became of them ? He told me, " They live, they dwell at 
my nation." 

This put new thoughts into my head ; for I presently 
imagined that these might be the men belonging to the ship 



ROBINSON CRUSOK. 151 

that was cast away in the sight of my island, as I now 
called it ; and who, after the ship was struck on the rock, 
and they saw her inevitably lost, had saved themselves in 
their boat, and were landed upon that wild shore among 
the savages. Upon this, I inquired of him more critically^ 
what was become of them : he assured me they lived still 
there ; that they had been there about four years ; that the 
savages let them alone, and gave them victuals to live on. 
I asked him how it came to pass they did not kill them, and 
eat them. He said, " No, they make brother with them ; " 
that is, as I understood him, a truce ; and then he added, 
*' They no eat mans but when make the war fight ; " that is 
to say, they never eat any men but such as come to fight 
with them, and are taken in battle. 

2. A Glimpse of Friday's Country. — It was after 
this some considerable time, that, being upon the top of 
the hill, at the east side of the island, from whence, as I 
have said, I had, in a clear day, discovered the main or 
continent of America, Friday, the weather being very 
serene, looks very earnestly towards the main land, and, in 
a kind of surprise, falls a-jumping and dancing, and calls 
out to me, for I was at some distance from him. I asked him 
what was the matter. " O joy ! " says he : " O glad ! there 
see my country, there my nation ! '* 

I observed an extraordinary sense of pleasure appeared 
in his face, and his eyes sparkled, and his countenance 
discovered a strange eagerness, as if he had a mind to be 
in his own country again. This observation of mine put a 
great many thoughts into me, which made me at first not 
so easy about my new man, Friday, as I was before ; and I 
made no doubt but that if Friday could get back to his 
own nation again, he would not only forget all his religion, 
but all his obligation to me, and would be forward enough 
to give his countrymen an account of me, and come back 
perhaps with a hundred or two of them, and make a feast 
upon me, at which he might be as merry as he used to be 
with those of his enemies, when they were taken in war. 

But I wronged the poor honest creature very much, for 
which I was very sorry afterwards. However, as my jealousy 
increased, and held me some weeks, I was a little more cir- 



152 ADVENTURES OF 

cumspect, and not so familiar and kind to him as before ; 
in which I was certainly in the wrong too : the honest, 
grateful creature having no thought about it, but what con- 
sisted with* the best principles, both as a religious Christian 
and as a grateful friend, as appeared afterwards to my full 
satisfaction. 

While my jealousy of him lasted, you may be sure I was 
every day pumping him, to see if he would discover any 
of the new thoughts which I suspected were in him : but 
I found everything he said was so honest and so innocent, 
that I could find nothing to nourish my suspicion ; and, in 
spite of all my uneasiness, he made me at last entirely his 
own again ; nor did he, in the least, perceive that I was 
uneasy, and therefore I could not suspect him of deceit 

One day, walking up the same hill, but the weather being 
hazy at sea, so that we could not see the continent, I called 
to him, and said, " Friday, do not you wish yourself in 
your own country, your own nation?" — ** Yes," he said, 
"I be much O glad to be at my own nation." — "What 
would you do there ? " said I. " Would you turn wild again, 
eat men's flesh again, and be a savage, as you were before?" 
He looked full of concern, and shaking his head, said, "No, 
no ; Friday tell them to live good, tell them to pray God, 
tell them to eat corn-bread, cattle- flesh, milk; no eat man 
again." — " Why then," said I to him, " they will kill you." 
He looked grave at that, and then said, " No, no ; they no 
kill me, they willing love learn." He meant by this, they 
would be willing to learn. He added, they learned much 
of the bearded mans that came in the boat. Then I asked 
him if he would go back to them. He smiled at that, and 
told me that he could not swim so far. I told him, I would 
make a canoe for him. He told me he would go, if I would 
go with him. "I go ! " says I ; " why, they will eat me, 
if I come there." — "No, no," says he; " me make they no 
eat you; me make they much love you." He meant, he 
would tell them how I had killed his enemies, and saved his 
life, and so he would make them love me. Then he told 
me, as well as he could, how kind they were to seventeen 
white men, or bearded men, as he called them, who came 
on shore there in distress. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 153 

3. A Desire to Leave the Island. — From this time 

I confess I had a mind to venture over, and see if I could 

possibly join with those bearded men, who, I made no doubt, 

were Spaniards and Portuguese : not doubting but if I could, 

we might find some method to escape from thence, being 

upon the continent, and a good company together, better 

than I could from an island forty miles off the shore, and 

alone, without help. So, after some days, I took Friday to 

work again, and, by way of discourse, told him I would give 

him a boat to go back to his own nation ; and accordingly 

I carried him to my frigate, which lay on the other side of 

the island, and having cleared it of water (for I always kept 

it sunk in water), I brought it out, showed it him, and we 

both went into it. I found he was a most dexterous fellow at 

managing it, and would make it go almost as swift again as 

I could. So when he was in, I said to him, **Well, now, 

IFriday , shall we go to your nation ? '' He looked very dull 

St my saying so, which, it seems, was because he thought 

the boat too small to go so far. I then told him I had a 

ligger; so the next day I went to the place where the first 

loat lay which I had made, but which I could not get into 

the water. He said that was big enough : but then, as I had 

taken no care of it, and it had lain two or three-and-twenty 

3^ears there, the sun had split and dried it, that it was in a 

^nanner rotten. Friday told me such a boat would do very 

^ell, and would carry "much enough vittle, drink, bread:" 

that was his way of talking. 

Upon the whole, I was by this time so fixed upon my 
design of going over with him to the continent, that I told 
him we would go and make one as big as that, and he should 
go home in it. He answered not one word, but looked very 
grave and sad. I asked him, " What was the matter with 
him ? " — He asked me again, " Why you angry mad with 
Friday ? What me done ? " — I asked him, " What he 
meant ? " I told him, " I was not angry with him at all." — 
" No angry ? " says he, repeating the words several times. 
" Why send Friday home away to my nation ? *' — " Why," 
says I, " Friday, did not you say you wished you were 
there?" — "Yes, yes," says he, **wish we both there; no 
wish Friday there, no master there." In a word, he would 



154 ADVEXTCKES OF 

not think of gang there vithoat me. " I go there, Friday !'^ 
says I ; " what ^all I do theie?^ He returned very quick 
opon me at this : ** You do great deal much good," says he; 
''you teach wild mans be good« sober, tame mans ; you tell 
them know God, pray God, and live new life." — " Alas I 
Friday,** says I, ** thou knowest not what thou sayest ; 
I am but an ignorant man myself** — " Yes, yes," says he, 
" you teachee me good, you teachee them good.** — " No, 
no, Friday," says I, " you shall go without me ; leave me 
here to li\'e by myself as I did before." He looked coa- 
fiised again at that word; and running to one of the hatchets 
which he used to wear, he takes it up hastily, and gives it 
to me. '' What must I do with this ? " says I to him. — 
" You take kill Friday," says he. — " What must I kill you 
for?" said I again. He returns very quick, "What you 
send Friday away for? Take kill Friday, no send Friday 
away." This he spoke so earnestly, that I saw tears stand 
in his eyes : in a word, I so plainly discovered the utmost 
affection in him to me, and a firm resolution in him, that 
I told him then, and often after, that I would never send 
him away from me, if he was willing to stay with me. 

Upon the whole, as I found, by all his discourse, a settled 
affection to me, and that nothing should part him from me, 
so I found all the foundation of his desire to go to his own 
country was laid in his ardent affection to the people, and 
his hopes of my doing them good — a thing which, as I had 
no notion of myself, so I had not the least thought, or inten- 
tion, or desire, of undertaking it But still I found a strong 
inclination to my attempting an escape, as above, founded 
on the supposition gathered from the discourse, viz., that 
there were seventeen bearded men there: and, therefore, 
without any more delay I went to work with Friday, to find 
out a great tree proper to fell, and make a large periagua, or 
canoe, to undertake the voyage. 

4. Boat-Making. — ^There were trees enough in the 
island to have built a little fleet, not of periaguas, or canoes, 
but even of good large vessels ; but the main thing I looked 
at was, to get one so near the water that we might launch it 
when it was made, to avoid the mistake I committed at first - 
At last, Friday pitched upon a tree ; for I found he knevv

ROBINSON CRUSOF. 155 

much better than I what kind of wood was fittest for it ; nor 
can I tell| to this day, what wood to call the tree we cut 
dowp, except that it was very like the tree we call fustic, or 
between that and the Nicaragua wood, for it was much of 
the flame colour and smell. Friday was for burning the 
holloir or cavity of this tree out, to make it for a boat, but I 
showed him how to cut it with tools, which, after I had 
showed him how to use, he did very handily, and in about 
a month's hard labour we finished it, and made it very hand- 
some ; especially when, with our axes, which I showed him 
how to handle, we cut and hewed the outside into the true 
shape of a boat. After this, however, it cost us near a fort- 
night's time to get her along, as it were inch by inch, upon 
great rollers, into the water ; but when she was in, she would 
have carried twenty men with great ease. 

When she was in the water, and though she was so big, it 
amazed me to see with what dexterity and how swift my 
man Friday would manage her, turn her, and paddle her 
along. So I asked him if he would, and if we might, 
venture over in her. " Yes,*' he said ; " we venture over in her 
very well, though great blow wind." However, I had a further 
design, that he knew nothing of, and that was to make a 
mast and a sail, and to fit her with an anchor and cable. As 
to a mast, that was easy enough to get : so I pitched upon a 
straight young cedar-tree, which I found near the place, and 
which there were great plenty of in the island ; and I set 
Friday to work to cut it down, and gave him directions how 
to shape and order it But as to the sail, that was my 
particular care. I knew I had old sails, or rather pieces of 
old sails, enough; but as I had had them now six-and- 
twenty years by me, and had not been very careful to 
preserve them, not imagining that I should ever have this 
kind of use for them, I did not doubt but they were all 
rotten, and, indeed, most of them were so. However, I 
found two pieces, which appeared pretty good, and with 
these I went to work ; and with a great deal of pains, and 
awkward stitching, you may be sure, for want of needles, I 
at length made a three-cornered ugly thing, like what we call 
in England a shoulder-of-mutton sail, to go with a boom at 
bottom, and a little short sprit^ at the top, such as usually 



156 ADVENTURES OF 

our ship's long-boats sail with, and such as I best knew how 
to manage, as it was such a one I had to the boat in which 
I made my escape from Barbary, as related in the first part 
of my story. 

I was near two months performing this last work, viz., 
rigging and fitting my mast and sails ; for I finished them 
very complete, making a small stay, and a sail, or foresail, to 
it, to assist, if we should turn to windward ; and, which was 
more than all, I fixed a rudder to the stern of her to steer 
with. I was but a bungling shipwright, yet, as I knew the 
usefulness, and even necessity of such a thing, I applied 
myself with so much pains to do it, that at last I brought it 
to pass ; though, considering the many dull contrivances I 
had for it that failed, I think it cost me almost as much 
labour as making the boat. 

5. Getting Ready for Sea. — After all this was done 
I had my man Friday to teach as to what belonged to the 
navigation of my boat ; for, though he knew very well how 
to paddle a canoe, he knew nothing what belonged to a sail 
and a rudder ; and was the most amazed when he saw me 
work the boat to and again in the sea by the rudder, and 
how the sail jibbed,® and filled this way, or that way, as the 
-course we sailed changed ; I say, when he saw this, he stood 
like one astonished and amazed. However, with a little use, 
I made all these things familiar to him, and he became an 
expert sailor, except that, as to the compass I could make 
him understand very little of that. On the other hand, as 
there was very little cloudy weather, and seldom or never 
any fogs in those parts, there was the less occasion for a 
compass, seeing the stars were ^ways to be seen \fy night, 
and the shore by day, except in the rainy seasons, and then 
nobody cared to stir abroad, either by land or sea. 

I was now entered on. the seven-and-twentieth year of my 
captivity in this place ; though the three last years that I 
had this creature with me ought rather to be left out of the 
account, my habitation being quite of another kind than in 
all the rest of the time. I kept the anniversary of my land- 
ing here with the same thankfulness to God for his mercies 
as at first ; and if I had such cause of acknowledgment at 
first, I had much more so now, having such additional 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 



157 



testimonies of the care of Providence over me, and the 
great hopes I had of being effectually and speedily delivered, 
for I had an invincible impression^ upon my thoughts that 
my deliverance was at hand, and that I should not be 
another year in this place. I went on, however, with my 
husbandry, digging, planting, and fencing, as usual. I 
gathered and cured my grapes, and did every necessary 
thing as before. 

The rainy season was, in the meantime, upon me, when I 
kept more within doors than at oth er times. We had stowed 
our own vessel as secure as we could, bringing her up into the 
creek, where, as I said in the beginning, I landed my rafts 
from the ship ; and hauling her up to the shore, at high- 
water mark, I made my man Friday dig a little dock, just 
big enough to hold her, and just deep enough to give her 
water enough to float in ; and then, when the tide was out. 
we made a strong dam across the end of it, to keep the 
water out, and so she lay dry, as to the tide, from the sea : 
and to keep the rain off, we laid a great many boughs of trees 
so thick that she was as well thatched as a house ; and thus 
we waited for the months of November and December, in 
which I designed to make my adventure. 

When the settled season began to come in, as the thought 
of my design returned with the fair weather, I was preparing 
daily for the voyage, and the first thing I did was to lay by 
a certain quantity of provisions, being the stores for our 
voyage, and intended, in a week or a fortnight's time, to 
open the dock, and launch out our boat.

XXN.— BATTLE WITH SAVAGES. 

I. Arrival of Savages. — I was busy one morning upon 
some preparations for the voyage, when I called to Friday 
and bid him go to the sea-shore, and see if he could find a 



158 ADVENTURES OF 

turtle, or tortoise, a thing which we generally got once a 
week, for the sake of the eggs as well as the flesh. Friday 
had not been long gone, when he came running back, and 
flew over my outer wall, or fence, like one that felt not the 
ground, or the steps he set his feet on ; and before I had 
time to speak to him he cries out to me, "O master ! O 
master ! O sorrow ! O bad." — " What's the matter, Friday? " 
says I. * "O yonder there," says he, "one, two, three 
canoe : one, two, three ! '* By this way of speaking I con- 
cluded there were six, but on inquiry I found it was but 
three. ** Well, Friday,'* says I, "do not be frightened!" 
So I heartened him up . as well as I could : however, I saw 
the poor fellow was most terribly scared, for nothing ran in 
his head but that they were come to look for him, and would 
cut him in pieces and eat him, and the poor fellow trembled 
so that I scarce knew what to do with him. I comforted 
him as well as I could, and told him I was in as much danger 
as he, and that they would eat me as well as him. " But," 
says I, " Friday, we must resolve to fight them. Can you 
fight, Friday?" — "Me shoot," says he; "but there come 
many great number." — " No matter for that," said I again, 
^* our guns will fright them that we do not kill." So I asked 
him whether, if I resolved to defend him, he would defend 
me, and stand by me, and do just as I bid him. He said, 
'''Me die when you bid die, master." So I went and 
fetched a good dram of rum and gave him, for I had been 
so good a husband^ of my rum that I had a great deal left. 
When he drank it I made him take the two fowling-pieces, 
which we always carried, and loaded them with large swan- 
shot, as big as small pistol-bullets ; then I took four 
muskets, and loaded them with two slugs^ and five small 
bullets each ; and my two pistols I loaded with a brace of 
bullets each ; I hung my great sword, as usual, naked by 
my side, and gave Friday his hatchet. 

When I had thus prepared myself, I took my perspective 
glass, and went up to the side of the hill to see what I could 
discover ; and I found quickly, by my glass, that there were 
one-and-twenty savages, three prisoners, and three canoes; and 
that their whole business seemed to be the triumphant 
banquet upon these three human bodies — a barbarous feast 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 1 59 

indeed ! but nothing more than, as I had observed, was usual 
with them; I observed also, that they were landed, not where 
they had done when Friday made his escape, but nearer to 
my creek, where the shore was low, and where a thick 
wood came almost close down to the sea. This, with the 
abhorrence of the inhuman errand th ese wretches came 
about, filled me with such indignation, that I came down 
again to Friday, and told him I was resolved to go down to 
them and kill them all ; and asked him if he would stand by 
me. He had now got over his fright, and his spirits being 
a little raised with the dram I had given him, he was very 
cheerful, and told me, as before, " he would die when I 
bid die." 
2. Preparations for the Attack. — In this fit of fury, I 

took and divided the arms which I had charged, as before, 
between us ; I gave Friday one pistol to stick in his girdle, 
and three guns upon his shoulder ; and I took one pistol 
and the other three guns myself; and in this posture we 
marched out I took a small bottle of rum in my pocket, 
and gave Friday a large bag with more powder and bullets ; 
and, as to orders, I charged him to keep close behind me, 
and not to stir, or shoot, or do anything till I bid him ; and, 
in the meantime, not to speak a word. In this posture, I 
fetched a compass* to my right hand of near a mile, as well to 
get over the creek as to get into the wood, so that I might 
come within shot of them before I should be discovered, 
which I had seen, by my glass, it was easy to do. 

While I was making this march, my former thoughts 
returning, I began to abate my resolution. I do not mean 
that I entertained any fear of their number ; for as they were 
naked, unarmed wretches, it is certain I was superior to them ; 
nay, though I had been alone. But it occurred to my 
thoughts, what call, what occasion, much less what necessity 
I was in to go and dip my hands in blood, to attack people 
who had neither done nor intended me any wrong ? Who, 
as to me, were innocent, and whose barbarous customs were 
their own disaster ; being, in them, a token indeed of God's 
having left them, with the other nations of that part of the 
world, to such stupidity, and to such inhuman courses ; but 
did not call me to take upon me to be a judge of their actions. 



l6o AD\"EXTURES OF 

much les an executioner of his justice ; that, whenever he 
thought fit, he would take the cause into his own hands, and 
by national vengeance punish them, as a people, for national 
crimes; but that, in the meantime, it was none of my 
business ; that, it was true, Friday might justify it, because 
he was a declared enemy, and in a state of war with those 
Tery parricular people, and it was lawful for him to attack 
them ; but I could not say the same with respect to myself 
These things were so vrarmly pressed upon my thoughts 
all the way as I went, that I resolved I would only go 
and place myself near them, that I might observe their 
barbarous feast, and that I would act then as God should 
direct; but that, unless something offered that was more 
a call to me than yet I knew of, I would not meddle with 
them. 

With this resolution I entered the wood; and with all 
possible wariness and silence, Friday following close at my 
heels, I marched till I came to the skirt of the wood, on the 
side which was next to them, only that one comer of the 
wood lay between me and them. Here I called softly to 
Friday, and showing him a great tree, which was just at the 
comer of the wood, I bade him go to the tree, and bring me 
word if he could see there plainly what they were doing. 
He did so ; and came immediately back to me, and told me 
they might be plainly viewed there ; that they were all about 
their fire, eating the flesh of one of their prisoners, and that 
another lay bound upon the sand, a little from them, which, 
he said, they would kill next, and which fired all the very 
soul within me. He told me it was not one of their nation, 
but one of the bearded men he had told me of, that came to 
their country in the boat. I was filled with horror at the 
very naming the white bearded man ; and, going to the 
tree, I saw plainly, by my glass, a white man, who lay upon 
the beach of the sea, with his hands and his feet tied with 
flags, or things like rushes, and that he was a European, 
and had clothes on. 

There was another tree, and a little thicket beyond it, 
about fifty yards nearer to them than the place where I was, 
which, by going a little way about, I saw I might come at 
undiscovered, and that then I should be within half a shot 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. l6l 

of them ; so I withheld my passion, though I was indeed 
enraged to the highest degree : and going back about twenty 
paces, I got behind some bushes, which held all the way till 
I came to the other tree ; and then came to a little rising 
ground, which gave me a full view of them, at a distance of 
about eighty yards. 

I had now not a moment to lose, for nineteen of the 
dreadful wretches sat upon the ground, all close-huddled 
together, and had just sent the other two to butcher the 
poor Christian, and bring him, perhaps, limb by limb, to 
their fire ; and they were stooping down to untie the bands at 
his feet. I turned to Friday : " Now, Friday," said I, " do as 
I bid thee." Friday said he would. "Then, Friday," 
says . I, " do exactly as you see me do ; fail in nothing." 
So I set down one of the muskets and the fowling-piece 
upon the ground, and Friday did the like by his ; and with 
the other musket I took my aim at the savages, bidding 
him to do the like ; then asking him if he was ready, he 
said, " Yes." " Then fire at them," said I ; and the same 
moment I fired also. 

3. The Attack. — Friday took his aim so much better 
than I, that on the side that he shot he killed two of 
them, and wounded three more ; and on my side I killed 
one, and wounded two. They were, you may be sure, in 
a dreadful consternation; and all of them who were not 
hurt jumped upon their feet, but did not immediately 
know which way to run, or which way to look, for they 
knew not from whence their destruction came. Friday 
kept his eyes close upon me that, as I had bid him, he 
might observe what I did ; so, as soon as the first shot 
was made, I threw down the piece, and took up the 
fowling-piece, and Friday did the like : he saw me cock^ 
and present; he did the same again. "Are you ready, 
Friday?" said I. "Yes," says he. "Let fly, then," says I, 
" in the name of God ! " And with that, I fired again among 
the amazed wretches, and so did Friday ; and as our pieces 
were now loaden with what I called swan-shot, or small 
pistol-bullets, we found only two drop, but so many were 
wounded that they ran about yelling and screaming like 
mad creatures, all bloody, and most of them miserably 



1 62 ADVENTURES OF 

wounded, whereof three more fell quickly after, though not 
quite dead. 

^ Now, Friday," says I, laying down the discharged pieces, 
and taking up the musket which was yet loaden, " follow me," 
which he did with a great deal of courage ; upon which I 
rushed out of the wood and showed myself, and Friday 
close at my foot As soon as I perceived they saw me, I 
shouted as loud as I could, and bade Friday do so too ; and 
running as fast as I could, which, by the way, was not very 
fast, being loaded with arms as I was, I made directly 
towards the poor victim, who was, as I said, lying upon the 
beach, or shore, between the place where they sat and the 
sea. The two butchers, who were just going to work with 
him, had left him at the surprise of our first fire, and fled in 
a terrible fright to the sea-side, and had jumped into a 
canoe, and three more of the rest made the same way. I 
turned to Friday, and bade him step forwards, and fire at 
them ; he understood me immediately, and running about 
forty yards, to be nearer them, he shot at them, and I 
thought he had killed them all, for I saw them all fall of a 
heap into the boat, though I saw two of them up again 
quickly ; however, he killed two of them, and wounded the 
third, so that he lay down in the bottom of the boat as if he 
had been dead. 

While my man Friday fired at them I pulled out my 
knife, and cut the flags that bound the poor victim ; and 
loosing his hands and feet, I lifted him up, and asked him 
in the Portuguese tongue what he was. He answered in 
Latin, " Christianus;" but was so weak and faint that he could 
scarce stand or speak. I took my bottle out of my pocket, 
and gave it him, making signs that he should drink, which 
he did ; and I gave him a piece of bread, which he ate. 
Then I asked him what countryman he was ; and he said, 
" Espagniole ; " and being a little recovered, let me know, by 
all the signs he could possibly make, how much he was in 
my debt for his deliverance. " Signor," said I, with as much 
Spanish as I could make up, " we will talk afterwards, but we 
must fight now : if you have any strength left, take this 
pistol and sword, and lay about you." He took them very 
thankfully ; and no sooner had he the arms in his hands, 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 1 63 

but, as if they had put new vigour into him, he flew upon 
his murderers like a fury, and had cut two of them in pieces 
in an instant ; for the truth is, as the whole was a surprise 
to them, so the poor creatures were so much frightened 
with the noise of our pieces, that they fell down for mere 
amazement and fear, and had no more power to attempt 
their own escape than their flesh had to resist our shot : and 
that was the case of those Ave that Friday shot at in the 
boat ; for as three of them fell with the hurt they received, 
so the other two fell with the fright. 

I kept my piece in my hand still without firing, being 
willing to keep my charge ready, because I had given the 
Spaniard my pistol and sword ; so I called to Friday, and 
bade him run up to the tree from whence we first fired, and 
fetch the arms which lay there that had been discharged, 
which he did with great swiftness ; and then giving him my 
musket, I sat down myself to load all the rest again, and 
bade them come to me when they wanted. While I was 
loading these pieces, there happened a fierce engagement 
between the Spaniard and one of the savages, who made at 
him with one of their great wooden swords, the same-like 
weapon that was to have killed him before, if I had not pre- 
vented it. The Spaniard, who was as bold and brave as 
could be imagined, though weak, had fought this Indian a 
good while, and had cut him two great wounds in his head ; 
but the savage being a stout, lusty fellow, closing in with 
him, had thrown him down, being faint, and was wringing 
my sword out of his hand ; when the Spaniard, though 
undermost, wisely quitting the sword, drew the pistol from 
his girdle, shot the savage through the body, and killed him 
upon the spot, before I, who was running to help him, could 
come near him. 

Friday being now left to his liberty, pursued the flying 
wretches, with no weapon in his hand but his hatchet ; and 
with that he despatched those three, who, as I said before, 
were wounded at first, and fallen, and all the rest he could 
come up with : and the Spaniard coming to roe for a gun, I 
gave him one of the fowling-pieces, with which he pursued 
two of the savages, and wounded them both ; but, as he 
was not able to run, they both got from him into the wood. 



164 ADVENTURES OF 

where Friday pursued them, and killed one of them, but the 
other was too nimble for him ; and though he was wounded, 
yet had plunged himself into the sea, and swam with all 
his might oflf to those two who were left in the canoe, which 
three in the canoe, with one wounded that we knew not 
whether he died or no, were all that escaped our hands of 
one-and-twenty. The account of the whole is as follows : 
three killed at our first shot from the tree ; two killed at the 
next shot ; two killed by Friday in the boat ; two killed by 
Friday of those at first wounded; one killed by Friday 
in the wood ; three killed by the Spaniard ; four killed, 
being found dropped here and there of their wounds, 
or killed by Friday in his chase of them ; four escaped 
in the boat, whereof one wounded, if not dead — twenty-one 
in all. 

Those that were in the canoe worked hard to get out of 
gunshot, and though Friday made two or three shots at 
them, I did not find that he hit any of them. Friday would 
fain have had me take one of their canoes and pursue them; 
and, indeed, I was very anxious about their escape, lest, 
carrying the news home to their people, they should come 
back perhaps with two or three hundred of the canoes, and 
devour us by mere multitude ; so I consented to pursue 
them by sea, and running to one of their canoes, I jumped 
in, and bade Friday follow me ; but when I was in the 
canoe, I was surprised to find another poor creature lie 
there, bound hand and foot, as the Spaniard was, for the 
slaughter, and almost dead with fear, not knowing what 
was the matter ; for he had not been able to look up over 
the side of the boat, he was tied so hard neck and heels, 
and had been tied so long, that he had really but little life 
in him. 

4. Friday's Father. — I immediately cut the twisted 
flags or rushes which they had bound him with, and would 
have helped him up ; but he could not stand or speak, but 
groaned most piteously, believing, it seems, still that he 
was only unbound in order to be killed. When Friday 
came to him, I bade him speak to him, and tell him of his 
deliverance ; and, pulling out my bottle, made him give the 
poor wretch a dram; which, with the news of his being 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 1 65 

delivered, revived him, and he sat up in the boat But 
when Friday came to hear him speak, and look in his face, 
it would have moved any one into tears to have seen how 
Friday kissed him, embraced him, hugged him, cried, 
laughed, hallooed, jumped about, danced, sang ; then cried 
again, wrung his hands, beat his own face and head ; and 
then sang and jumped about again, like a distracted creature. 
It was a good while before I could make him speak to me, 
or tell me what was the matter ; but when he came a little 
to himself, he told me that it was his father. 

It is not easy for me to express how it moved me to see 
what ecstasy^ and filial affection had worked in this poor 
savage at the sight of his father, and of his being delivered 
from death ; nor,, indeed, can I describe half the extrava- 
gances of his affection after this ; for he went into the boat, 
and out of the boat, a great many times. When he went in 
to him, he would sit down by him, open his breast, 
and hold his father's head close to his bosom for many 
minutes together, to nourish it; then he took his arms 
and ankles, which were numbed and stiff with the binding, 
and chafed and rubbed them with his hands; and I, 
perceiving what the case was, gave him some rum out of 
my bottle to rub them with, which did them a great deal of 
good. 

This affair put an end to our pursuit of the canoe with the 
other savages, who were got now almost out of sight ; and it 
was happy for us that we did not, for it blew so hard within 
two hours after, and before they could be got a quarter of 
their way, and continued blowing so hard all night, and that 
from the north-west, which was against them, that I could 
not suppose their boat could live, or that they ever reached 
their own coast. 

But, to return to Friday; he was so busy about his father, 
that I could not find in my heart to take him off for some 
time : but after I thought he could leave him a little, I called 
him to me, and he came jumping and laughing, and pleased 
to the highest extreme ; then I asked him if he had given 
his father any bread. He shook his head, and said, " None ; 
ugly dog eat all up self." I then gave him a cake of bread 
out of a little pouch I carried on purpose : I also gave him 



l66 ADVENTURES OF 

a dram for himself, but he would not taste it, but carried it 
to his father. I had in ray pocket two or three bunches of 
raisins, so I gave him a handful of them for his father. He 
had no sooner given his father these raisins, but I saw him 
come out of the boat, and run away as if he had been be- 
witched, he ran at such a rate ; for he was the swiftest fellow 
on his feet that ever I saw : I say, he ran at such a rate that 
he was out of sight, as it were, in an instant ; and though I 
called, and hallooed out too, after him, it was all one, away 
he went ; and in a quarter of an hour I sa.w him come back 
again, though not so fast as he went ; and as he came nearer, 
I found his pace slacker, because he had something in his 
hand. When he came up to me, I found he had been quite 
home for an earthen jug, or pot, to bring his father some 
fresh water^ and that he had two more cakes or loaves of 
bread ; the bread he gave me, but the water he carried to his 
father; however, as I was very thirsty too, I took a little 
sup of it. The water revived his father more than all the 
rum or spirits I had given him, for he was just fainting with 
thirst. 

When his father had drunk, I called to him to know if there 
was any water left : he said, "Yes ;" and I bade him give it to 
the poor Spaniard, who was in as much want of it as his 
father : and I sent one of the cakes that Friday brought to 
the Spaniard too, who was indeed very weak, and was re- 
posing himself upon a green place under the shade of a tree; 
and whose limbs were also very stiff, and very much swelled 
with the rude bandage he had been tied with. When I saw 
that, upon Friday's coming to him with the water, he sat up 
and drank, and took the bread, and began to eat, I went to 
him and gave him a handful of raisins : he looked up in my 
face with all the tokens of gratitude and thankfulness that 
could appear in any countenance ; but was so weak, notwith- 
standing he had so exerted himself in the fight, that he could 
not stand up upon his feet ; he tried to do it two or three 
times, but was really not able, his ankles were so swelled and 
so painful to him ; so I bade him sit still, and caused Friday 
to rub his ankles, and bathe them with rum, as he had done 
his father's. 

I observed the poor affectionate creature every two 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 167 

minutes, or perhaps less, all the while he was here, turn his 
head about to see if his father was in the same place and 
posture as he left him sitting : and at last he found he was 
not to be seen ; at which he started up, and, without speak- 
ing a word, flew with that swiftness to him that one could 
scarce perceive his feet to touch the ground as he went : 
but when he came, he only found he had lain himself down 
to ease his limbs, so Friday came back to me presently. And 
then I spoke to the Spaniard to let Friday help him up, if he 
could, and lead him to the boat, and then he should carry 
him to our dwelling, where I would take care of him ; but 
Friday, a lusty strong fellow, took the Spaniard quite up 
upon his back, and carried him away to the boat, and set 
him down softly upon the side or gunnel of the canoe, with 
his feet in the inside of it ; and then, lifting him quite in, he 
set himself close to his father ; and presently stepping out 
again, launched the boat off, and paddled it along the shore 
faster than I could walk, though the wind blew pretty hard 
too : so he brought them both safe into our creek, and 
leaving them in the boat, ran away to fetch the other canoe. 
As he passed me, I spoke to him, and asked him whither he 
went. He told me, " Go fetch more boat : " so away he went 
like the wind, for sure never man or horse ran like him ; and 
he had the other canoe in the creek almost as soon as I got 
to it by land ; so he wafted me over, and then went to help 
our new guests out of the boat, which he did ; but they were 
neither of them able to walk, so that poor Friday knew not 
what to do. 

To remedy this, I went to work in my thought, and 
calling to Friday to bid them sit down on the bank while he 
came to me, I soon made a kind of hand-barrow to lay them 
on, and Friday and I carried them both up together upon it 
between us. But when we got them to the outside of our 
wall, or fortification, we were at a worse loss than before, for 
it was impossible to get them over, and I was resolved not to 
break it down. So I set to work again ; and Friday and I, in 
about two hours' time, made a very handsome tent, covered 
with old sails, and above that with boughs of trees, being in 
the space without our outward fence, and between that and 
the grove of young wood which I had planted ; and here we

XKYl.— ROBINSON'S NE W SUBJECTS. 

I. The King of the Island. — My island was now 
peopled, and I thought myself rich in Subjects : and it was 
a merry reflection, which I frequently made, how like a king 
I looked. First of all, the whole country was my own 
mere property, so that I had an undoubted right of domi- 
nion. Secondly, my people were perfectly subjected ; I was 
absolutely lord and lawgiver ; they all owed their lives to me, 
and were ready to lay down their lives, if there had been 
occasion for it, for me. It was remarkable, too, I had but 
three subjects, and they were of three different religions : my 
man Friday was a Protestant, his father was a Pagan and »i 
cannibal, and the Spaniard was a Papist : however, I allowed 
liberty of conscience^ through my dominions. But this is by 
the way. 

As soon as I had secured my two weak rescued prisoners, 
and given them shelter, and a place to rest them upon, 
I began to think of making some provision for them ; and 
the first thing I did, I ordered Friday to take a yearling goat, 
betwixt a kid and a goat, out of my particular flock, to be 
killed ; when I cut off the hinder quarter, and chopping it 
into small pieces, I set Friday to work to boiling and stewing, 
and made them a very good dish, I assure you, of flesh and 
broth, having put some barley and rice also into the broth : 
and as I cooked it without doors, for I made no fire within 
my inner wall, so I carried it all into the new tent, and 
having set a table there for them, I sat down, and ate my 
dinner also with them, and, as well as I could, cheered them, 
and encouraged them. Friday was my interpreter, especially 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 1 69 

to his father, and, indeed, to the Spaniard too; for the 
Spaniard spoke the language of the savages pretty well. 

After we had dined, or rather supped, I ordered Friday to 
take one of the canoes, and go and fetch our muskets and 
other firearms, which, for want of time, we had left upon the 
place of battle : and, the next day, I ordered him to go and 
bury the dead bodies of the savages, which lay open to the 
sun, and would presently be offensive. I also ordered him 
tQ bury the horrid remains of their barbarous feast, which I 
knew were pretty much, and which I could not think of 
doing myself; nay, I could not bear to see them, if I went 
that way ; all which he punctually performed, and effaced the 
very appearance of the savages being there ; so that when I 
went again, I could scarce know where it was, otherwise than 
by the corner of the wood pointing to the place. 

2. A Confidential Talk. — I then began to enter into a 
little conversation with my two new subjects : and, first, I 
set Friday to inquire of his father what he thought of 
the escape of the savages in that canoe, and whether we 
might expect a return of them, with a power too great for us 
to resist. His first opinion was, that the savages in the boat 
could never live out the storm which blew that night they 
went off, but must of necessity be drowned, or driven south 
to those other shores, where they were as sure to be devoured 
as they were to be drowned, if they were cast away. But as 
to what they would do if they came safe on shore, he said he 
knew not ; but it was his opinion that they were so dread- 
fully frightened with the manner of their being attacked, the 
noise, and the fire, that he believed they would tell the 
people they were killed by thunder and lightning, not by the 
hand of man ; and that the two that appeared, viz. Friday 
and I, were two heavenly spirits, or furies, come down 
to destroy them, and not men with weapons. This, he said, 
he knew, because he heard them all cry out so in their 
own language one to another ; for it was impossible for them 
to conceive that a man could dart fire, and speak thunder, 
and kill at a distance, without lifting up the hand, as was 
done now. And this old savage was in the right ; for, as 
I understood since, by other hands, the savages never 
attempted to go over to the island afterwards, they were so 



lyo ADVENTURES OF 

terrified with the accounts given by those four men (for, it 
seems, they did escape the sea), that they believed whoever 
went to that enchanted^ island would be destroyed by fire 
from the gods. 

This, however, I knew not ; and therefore was under 
continual apprehensions for a good while, and kept always 
upon my guard, with all my army : for, as there were now 
four of us, I would have ventured upon a hundred of them, 
fairly in the open field, at any time. 

In a little time, however, no more canoes appearing, the 
fear of their coming wore off; and I began to take my former 
thoughts of a voyage to the main into consideration ; being 
likewise assured, by Friday's father, that I might depend 
upon good usage from their nation, on his account, if I 
would go. 

But my thoughts were a little suspended when I had a 
serious discourse with the Spaniard, and when I understood that 
there were sixteen more of his countrymen and Portuguese, 
who, halving been cast away, and made their escape to that 
side, lived there at peace, indeed, with the savages, but were 
very sore put to it for necessaries, and indeed for life. I 
asked him all the particulars of their voyage, and found they 
were a Spanish ship, bound from the Rio de la Plata to the 
Havannah, being directed to leave their loading there, which 
was chiefly hides and silver, and to bring back what 
European goods they could meet with there ; that they had 
five Portuguese seamen on board, whom they took out of 
another wreck ; that five of their own men were drowned 
when first the ship was lost, and that these escaped through 
infinite dangers and hazards, and arrived, almost starved, 
on the cannibal coast, where they expected to have been 
devoured every moment. He told me they had some arms 
with them, but they were perfectly useless, for they had 
neither powder nor ball, the washing of the sea having spoiled 
all their powder, but a little, which they used at their first 
landing, to provide themselves some food. 

3. A New Proposal.— I asked him what he thought 
Would become of them there, and if they had formed 
no design of making any escape. He said they had 
many consultations about it; but that having .neither 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 17I 

vessel, nor tool to build one, nor provisions of any 
kind, their counsels always ended in tears and despair. 
I asked him how he thought they would receive a 
proposal from me, which might tend towards an escape ; 
and whether, if they were all here, it might not be done. I 
told him, with freedom, I feared mostly their treachery and 
ill usage of me, if I put my life in their hands, for that 
gratitude was no inherent^ virtue in the nature of man, nor 
did men alway square their dealings by the obligations they 
had received, so much as they did by the advantages they 
expected. I told him it would be very hard that I should be 
the instrument of their deliverance, and that they should 
afterwards make me their prisoner in New Spain, where an 
Englishman was certain to be made a sacrifice, what necessity 
or what accident soever brought him thither ; and that I had 
rather be delivered up to the savages, and be devoured alive, 
than fall into the merciless claws of the priests, and be 
carried into the Inquisition.* I added, that otherwise I was 
persuaded, if they were all here, we might, with so many 
hands, build a bark large enough to carry us all away, either 
to the Brazils southward, or to the islands, or Spanish coast 
northward ; but that if, in requital, they should, when I had 
put weapons into their hands, carry me by force among their 
own people, I might be ill used for my kindness to them, and 
make my case worse than it was before. 

He answered with a great deal of candour and ingenuous- 
ness,^ that their condition was so miserable, and they were so 
sensible of it, that he believed they would abhor the thought 
of using any man unkindly that should contribute to their 
deliverance ; and that, if I pleased, he would go to them 
with the old man, and discourse with them about it, and 
return again, and bring me their answer ; that he would make 
conditions with them upon their solemn oath, that they 
should be absolutely under my leading, as their commander 
and captain ; and that they should swear, upon the holy 
sacraments and gospel, to be true to me, and go to such 
Christian country as that I should agree to, and no other, 
and to be directed wholly and absolutely by my orders, till 
they were landed safely in such country as I intended ; and 
that he would bring a contract from them, under their hands, 



172 ADVENTURES OF 

for that purpose. Then he told me he would first swear to 
me himself that he would never stir from me as long as he 
lived, till I gave him orders ; and that he would take my side 
to the last drop of his blood, if there should happen the least 
breach of fadth among his countrymen. He told me they 
were all of them very civil, honest men, and they were under 
the greatest distress imaginable, having neither weapons, nor 
clothes, nor any food, but at the mercy and discretion of the 
savages ; out of all hopes of ever returning to their own 
country ; and that he was sure, if I would undertake their 
relief, they would live and die by me. 

4, Reasons for Delay. — Upon these assurances, I 
resolved to venture to relieve them, if possible, and to send 
the old savage and this Spaniard over to them to treat. But 
when we had got all things in readiness to go, the Spaniard 
himself started an objection, which had so much prudence 
in it on one hand, and so much sincerity on the other hand, 
that I could not but be very well satisfied .in it ; and, by his 
advice, put off the deliverance of his comrades for at least 
half a year. The case was thus : He had been with us now 
about a month, during which time I had let him see in what 
manner I had provided, with the assistance of Providence, 
for my support ; and he saw evidently what stock of corn 
and rice I had laid up; which, though it was more than 
sufficient for myself, yet it was not sufficient, without good 
husbandry,^ for my family, now it was increased to four ; but 
much less would it be sufficient if his countrymen, who were, 
as he said, sixteen, still alive, should come over ; and least of 
all would it be sufficient to victual our vessel, if we should 
build one, for a voyage to any of the Christian colonies of 
America ; so he told me he thought it would be more advis- 
able to let him and the other two dig and cultivate some 
more land, as much as I could spare seed to sow, and that 
we should wait another harvest, that we might have a supply 
of corn for his countrymen, when they should come ; for 
want might be a temptation to them to disagree, or not to 
think themselves delivered, otherwise than out of one 
difficulty into another. " You know," says he, "the children of 
Israel, though they rejoiced at first for their being delivered 
out of Egypt, yet rebelled even against God himself, that 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 173 

delivered them, when they came fo want bread in the 
wilderness." 

His caution was so seasonable, and his advice so good, 
that I could not but be very well pleased with his proposal, 
as well as I was satisfied with his fidelity. So we fell to 
<iigging all four of us, as well as the wooden tools we were 
furnished with permitted ; and in about a month's time, 
by the end of which it was seed-time, we had got as much 
land cured and trimmed up as we sowed two-and-twenty 
bushels of barley on, and sixteen jars of rice, which was, in 
short, all the seed we had to spare; nor, indeed, did we 
leave ourselves barley sufficient for our own food for the 
six months that we had to expect our crop ; that is to say, 
reckoning from the time we set our seed aside for sowing ; for 
it is not to be supposed it is six months in the ground in that 
country. 

Having now society enough, and our number being 
sufficient to put us out of fear oif the savages, if they had 
come, unless their number had been very great, we went 
freely all over the island, whenever we found occasion ; and 
as here we had our escape or deliverance upon our thoughts, 
it was impossible, at least to me, to have the means of it out 
of mind. For this purpose, I marked out several trees 
which I thought fit for our work, and I set Friday and his 
father to cutting them down ; and then I caused the Spaniard, 
to whom I imparted my thought on that affair, to oversee 
and direct their work. I showed them with what indefatig- 
able^ pains I had hewed a large tree into single planks, and I 
caused them to do the like, till they had made about a dozen 
large planks of good oak, near two feet broad, thirty-five feet 
long, and from two inches to four inches thick: what 
prodigious labour it took up, any one may imagine. 

At the same time, I contrived to increase my little flock 
of tame goats as much as I could ; and, for this purpose, I 
made Friday and the Spaniard go out one day, and myself 
with Friday the next day (for we took our turns), and by 
this means we got about twenty young kids to breed up with 
the rest ; for whenever we shot the dam, we saved the kids, 
and added them to our flock. But, above all, the season for 
curing the grapes coming on, I caused such a prodigious 



174 ADVESTTDXES OF 

quantity to be bung up in the sun, that, I believe, had 
we been at Alicant, -where the raisins are cured by the sun, we 
could have filled sixty or ea^ty banels ; and these, with our 
bread, was a great part of our food, and was very good 
lining too, I assure you, for it is exceedingly nourishing. 

It was now harvest, and our czt^ in good <Hder : it wbs 
not the most plentiful increase I had seen in the island, 
but, however, it w2« enough to answer our end ; for from 
twenty-two bushels of barley we brought in and threshed out 
above two hundred and twenty bushels, and the like in 
projxjition of the rice, which was store enough for our food 
to the next harvest, though all the sixteen Spaniards had 
been on shore with me; or if we had been ready for a 
voyage, it would very plentifully have victualled our ship to 
have carried us to any part of the world, that is to say, any 
part of America, ^^^len we had thus housed and secured 
our magazine of com, we fell to work to make more wicker- 
ware, \iz. great baskets, in which we kept it ; and the 
Spaniard was very handy and dexterous at this part, and 
often blamed me that I did not make some things for 
defence of this kind of work ; but I saw no need of it. 

5. An Embassy Eztraordinaxy. — ^And now, having a 
full supply of food for all the guests I expected, I gave the 
Spaniard leave to go over to the main, to see what he could 
do with those he had left behind him there. I gave him a 
strict charge not to bring any man with him who would not 
first swear, in the presence of him and the old savage, that he 
would no way injure, fight with, or attack the person he 
should find in the island, who was so kind as to send for 
them in order to their deliverance; but that they would 
stand by him, and defend him against all such attempts, and 
wherever they went, would be entirely under and subjected 
to his command ; and that this should be put in writing, and 
signed with their hands. How they were to have done this, 
when I knew they had neither pen nor ink, was a question 
which we never asked. Under these instructions, the 
Spaniard and the old savage, the father of Friday, went away 
in one of the canoes which they might be said to come in, 
or rather were brought in, when they came as prisoners to be 
devoured by the savages. I gave each of them a musket, 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 



175 



with a firelock on it, and about eight charges of powder and 
bally charging them to be very good husbands of both^ and 
not to use either of them but upon urgent occasions. 

This was a cheerful work, being the first measures used by 
me, in view of my deliverance, for now twenty-seven years 
and some days. I gave them provisions of bread, and dried 
grapes, sufficient for themselves for many days, and sufficient 
for the Spaniaids for about eight days' time ; and wishing 
them a good voyage, I saw them go ; agreeing with them 
about a signal they should hang out at their return, by 
which I should know them again, when they came back, at 
a distance, before they came on shore. They went away 
with a fair gale, on the day that the moon was at full, by 
my account in the month of October ; but as for an exact 
reckoning of days, after I had once lost it, I could never 
recover it again ; nor had I kept even the number of years 
so punctually as to be sure I was right ; though, as it proved 
when I afterwards examined my account, I found I had kept 
a true reckoning of years.

XXVII. —^iV^ EXTRAORDINARY OCCURRENCE. 

I. A Sail in Sight. — It was no less than eight days I 
had waited for my two friends, when a strange and unfore- 
seen accident intervened, of which the like has not perhaps 
been heard of in history. I was fast asleep in my hutch one 
morning, when my man Friday came running in to me, and 
called aloud, " Master, master, they are come, they are come !" 
I jumped up, and, regardless of danger, I went out as soon 
as I could get my clothes on, through my little grove, which, 
by the way, was by this time grown to be a very thick wood ; 
I say, regardless of danger, I went without my arms, which

i: -vxs Tiat zlt nHagm to do; hat I vas surprised, when 
xzmiog HIT er^es to die se&, I psesently saw a boat about a 
j£2£:d£ snd a IlbITs rJifffaixy, sta&ding id for the shore, with a 
SiLDiudsHDtPiziiiitoai suL as tibey call it, and the wind blowing 
jiTfiiT ^dr to bimg diem in : also I obserred presently, that 
iber ^d next come from that side which the shore lay on, 
l>i:i from the soodiemiDost end c^ the island. Upon this, I 
called Fiiday in. and bade him lie dose, for these were not 
the people we locked for. and that we might not know yet 
wbeiiber ibey were friends or enemies^ In the next place, I 
went in to fetch my perspective glass, to see what I could 
malLe of them ; and having taken the ladder out, I climbed 
np to the top of the hill, as I used to do when I was appre- 
hensive of anything, and to take my view the plainer without 
being didcoveied. I had scarce set my foot upon the hill, 
when my eye plainly discovered a ship lying at an anchor, 
at about two leagues and a half distance from me, S.S.E., but 
not above a league and a half from the shore. By my obser- 
vation, it appealed plainly to be an English ship^ and the 
boat appeal^ to be an Eng^h long-boat 

I cannot express the confosion I was in ; though the joy 
of seeing a ship, and one that I had reason to believe iK'as 
manned by my own countrymen, and consequently friends, 
was such as I cannot describe ; but yet I had some secret 
doubts hang about me — I cannot tell from whence they 
came — bidding me keep upon my guard. In the first place, 
it occurred to me to consider what business an English ship 
could have in that part of the world, since it was not the way 
to or from any part of the world where the English had any 
traffic ; and I knew there had been no storms to drive them 
in there, as in distress ; and that if they were really English, 
it was most probable that they were here upon no good de- 
sign ; and that I had better continue as I was, than fall into 
the hands of thieves and murderers. 

2. Prisoners Landed. — I had not kept myself long in 
this posture, but I saw the boat draw near the shore, as if 
they looked for a creek to thrust in at, for the convenience 
of landing. However, as they did not come quite far enough, 
they did not see the little inlet where I formerly landed my 
rafts, but run their boat on shore upon the beach, at about 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 177 

half a mile from me, which was very happy for me ; for 
otherwise they would have landed just at my door, as I may 
say, and would soon have beaten me out of my castle, and 
perhaps have plundered me of all I had. 

When they were on shore, I was fully satisfied they were 
Englishmen, at least most of them ; one or two I thought 
were Dutch, but it did not prove so. There were in all eleven 
men, whereof three of them I found were unarmed, and, as 
I thought, bound ; and when the first four or five of them 
were jumped on shore, they took those three out of the 
boat as prisoners — one of the three I could perceive using 
the most passionate gestures^ of entreaty, affliction, and 
despair, even to a kind of extravagance; the other two, 
I could perceive, lifted up their hands sometimes, and 
appeared concerned, indeed, but not to such a degree as 
the first. 

I was perfectly confounded at the sight, and knew not 
what the meaning of it should be. Friday called out to me 
m English, as well as he could, " O master ! you see 
English mans eat prisoner as well as savage mans." — " Why, 
Friday," says I, " do you think they are going to eat them 
then? " — *' Yes," says Friday, " they will eat them."—" No, 
no," says I, " Friday ; I am afraid they will murder them, 
indeed, but you may be sure they will not eat them." 

All this while I had no thought of what the matter really 
was, but stood trembling with the horror of the sight, expect- 
ing every moment when the three prisoners should be killed ; 
nay, once I saw one of the villains lift up his arm with a great 
cutlass, as the seamen call it, or sword, to strike one of the 
poor men ; and I expected to see him fall every moment, 
at which all the blood in my body seemed to run chill in my 
veins. 

I wished heartily now for my Spaniard, and the savage 
that had gone with him, or that I had any way to have come 
undiscovered within shot of them, that I might have rescued 
the three men, for I saw no fire-arms they had among them : 
but it fell out to my mind^ another way. 

After I had observed the outrageous usage of the three 
men by the insolent seamen, I observed the fellows run 
scattering about the island, as if they wanted to see the 

M 



178 ADVENTURES OF 

country. I observed that the three other men had liberty 
to go also where they pleased ; but they sat down all three 
upon the ground, very pensive, and looked like men in 
despair. 

This put me in mind of the first time when I came on 
shore, and began to look about me : how I gave myself over 
for lost ; how wildly I looked around me ; what dreadful 
apprehensions I had ; and how I lodged in the tree all night, 
for fear of being devoured by wild beasts. 

As I knew nothing that night of the supply I was to 
receive by the providential driving of the ship nearer the 
land by the storms and tide, by which I have since been so 
long nourished and supported ; so these three poor desolate 
men knew nothing how certain of deliverance and supply 
they were, how near it was to them, and how effectually and 
really they were in a condition of safety at the same time 
that they thought themselves lost and their case desperate. 
So little do we see before us in the world, and so much 
reason have we to depend cheerfully upon the great Maker 
of the world, that he does not leave his creatures so 
absolutely destitute, but that, in the worst circumstances 
they have always something to be thankful for, and some- 
times are nearer their deliverance than they imagine ; nay, 
are even brought to their deliverance by the means by which 
they seem to be brought to their destruction. 

It was just at the top of high -water when these people 
came on shore ; and partly while they stood parleying^ with 
the prisoners they brought, and partly while they rambled 
about to see what kind of a place they were in, they had 
carelessly stayed till the tide was spent, and the water was 
ebbed considerably away, leaving their boat aground. They 
had left two men in the boat, who, as I found afterwards, 
having drunk a little too much brandy, fell asleep. However, 
one of them waking a little sooner than the other, and finding 
the boat too fast aground for him to stir it, hallooed out 
for the rest, who were straggling about, upon which they 
all soon came to the boat. But it was past all their strength 
to launch her, the boat being very heavy, and the shore on 
that side being a soft oozy sand, almost like a quicksand. 
In this condition, like true seamen, who are perhaps the 



. ROBINSON CRUSOE. 1 79 

least of all mankind given to forethought, they gave it over, 
and away they strolled about the country again ; and I 
heard one of them say aloud to another, calling them off 
from the boat, " Why, let her alone, Jack, can't you? she'll 
float next tide," by which I was fully confirmed in the miin 
inquiry of what countrymen they were. 

3. An Unexpected Friend.— All this while I kept 
myself very close, not once daring to stir out of my castle 
any farther than to my place of observation, near the top 
of the hill ; and very glad I was to think how well it was 
fortified. I knew it was no less than ten hours before the 
boat could float again, and by that time it would be dark, 
and I might be at more liberty to see their motions, and 
to hear their discourse, if they had any. In the meantime, 
I fitted myself up for a battle, as before, though with more 
caution, knowing I had to do with another kind of enemy 
than I had at first I ordered Friday also, whom I had 
made an excellent marksman with his gun, to load himself 
with arms. I took myself two fowling-pieces, and I gave 
him three muskets. My figure, indeed, was very fierce : I 
had my formidable goat's-skin coat on, with the great cap 
I have mentioned, a naked sword by my side, two pistols 
in my belt, and a gun upon each shoulder. 

It was my design, as I said above, not to have made any 
attempt till it was dark ; but about two o'clock, being the 
heat of the day, I found that, in short, they were all gone 
straggling into the woods, and, as I thought, laid down to 
sleep. The three poor distressed men, too anxious for their 
condition to get any sleep, were, however, sat down under 
the shelter of a great tree, at about a quarter of a mile from 
me, and, as I thought, out of sight of any of the rest. 

Upon this I resolved to discover myself to the n, and 
learn something of their condition. Immediately I marched 
in the figure as above, my man Friday at a good distance 
behind me, as formidable for his arms as I, but not making 
quite so staring a spectre-like figure as I did. I came as 
near them undiscovered as I could, and then, before any 
of them saw me, I called aloud to them in Spanish, '* What 
are ye, gentlemen ? " 

They started up at the noise ; but were ten times more 



l8o ADVENTURES OF 

confounded when they saw me, and the uncouth figure that 
I made. They made no answer at all, but I thought I per- 
ceived them just going to fly from me, when I spoke to 
them in English. " Gentlemen," said I, " do not be sur- 
prised at me j perhaps you may have a friend near, when 
you did not expect it." — " He must be sent directly from 
Heaven then," said one of them very gravely to me, and 
pulling off his hat at the same time to me ; " for our con- 
dition is past the help of man." — " All help is from Heaven, 
sir," said I. " But can you put a stranger in the way how 
to help you ? for you seem to be in some great distress. I 
saw you when you landed ; and when you seemed to make 
supplication to the brutes that came with you, I saw one of 
them lift up his sword to kill you." 

4. The Captain's Story. — The poor man, with tears 
running down his face, and trembling, looking like one 
astonished, returned, ** Am I talking to God or man ? Is it 
a real man or an angel ? " — " Be in no fear about that, sir," 
said I ; "if God had sent an angel to relieve you, he would 
have come better clothed, and armed after another manner 
than you see me. Fray lay aside your fears. I am a man, 
an Englishman, and disposed to assist you : you see I have 
one servant only ; we have arms and ammimition ; tell us 
freely, can we serve you ? What is your case ? " — " Our 
case," said he, " sir, is too long to tell you, while our 
murderers are so near us; but, in short, sir, I was 
commander of that ship, my men have mutinied against 
me; they have been hardly prevailed on not to murder me; 
and at last have sent me on shore in this desolate place, 
with these two men with me, one my mate, the other 
a passenger, where we expected to perish, believing the 
place to be uninhabited, and know not yet what to think of 
it." — "Where are these brutes, your enemies?" said I. 
" Do you know where they are gone ? " — " There they lie, 
sir," said he, pointing to a thicket of trees. " My heart 
trembles for fear they have seen us, and heard you speak ; 
if they have, they will certainly murder us all." — " Have 
they any firearms ? " said I. He answered they had only 
two pieces, one of which they left in the boat. '*Well 
then," said I, " leave the rest to me. I see they are all

asleep, it is an easy thing to kill them all : but shall we 
rather take them prisoners ? *' He told me there were two 
desperate villains among them, that it was scarce safe to 
show any mercy to ; but if they were secured, he believed 
all the rest would return to their duty. I asked him which 
they were. He told me he could not at that distance dis- 
tinguish them, but he would obey my orders in anything I 
would direct. '* Well," says I, " let us retreat out of their 
view or hearing, lest they awake, and we will resolve 
further.". So they willingly went back with me, till the 
woods covered us from them. 

"Look you, sir," said I, "if I venture upon your deliverance, 
are you willing to make two conditions with me ? " He 
anticipated my proposals* by telling me that both he and 
the ship, if recovered, should be wholly directed and 
commanded by me in everything; and, if the ship was 
not recovered, he would live and die with me in what part 
of the world soever I would send him ; and the two other 
men said the same. "Well," says I, " my conditions are but 
two : first. That while you stay in this island with me, you 
will not pretend to any authority here ; and if I put arms 
in your hands, you will, upon all occasions, give them up 
to me, and do no prejudice^ to me or mine upon this island ; 
and, in the meantime, be governed by my orders : secondly, 
That if the ship is or may be recovered, you will carry me 
and my man to England passage free."

XXVIII.— ^ LESSON TO MUTINEERS, 

I. A Speedy Victory. — The captain gave me all the 
assurances that the invention^ or faith of man could devise, 
that he would comply with my most reasonable den^ands ; 



1 82 ADVENTURES OF 

and, besides, would owe his life to me, and acknowledge it 
upon all occasions, as long as he lived. " Well then," said I, 
** here are three muskets for you, with powder and ball : tell 
me next what you think is proper to be done." He showed 
me all the testimonies of his gratitude that he was able, but 
offered to be wholly guided by me. I told him I thought 
it was hard venturing anything; but the best method I 
could think of was to fire upon them at once, as they lay, 
and if any was not killed at the first volley, and offered to 
submit, we might save them, and so put it wholly upon 
God's providence to direct the shot. He said very modestly, 
that he was loath to kill them, if he could help it ; but that 
two of them were incorrigible villains, and had been the 
authors of all the mutiny in the ship, and if they escaped, 
we should be undone still ; for they would go on board and 
bring the whole ship's company, and destroy us all. '* Well 
then," says I, " necessity legitimates^ my advice, for it is the 
only way to save our lives." However, seeing him still 
cautious of shedding blood, I told him they should go 
themselves and manage as they found convenient. 

In the middle of this discourse we heard some of them 
awake, and soon after we saw two of them on their feet. I 
asked him if either of them were the heads of the mutiny. 
He said no. ' * Well then," said I, "you may let them escape ; 
and Providence seems to have awakened them on purpose 
to save themselves. Now," says I, " if the rest escape you, 
It is your fault." 

Animated with this, he took the musket I had given him 
m his hand, and a pistol in his belt, and his two comrades 
with him, with each a piece^ in his hand. The two men who 
were with him going first, made some noise, at which one of 
tne seamen who was awake turned about, and seeing them 
coming, cried out to the rest ; but it was too late then, for 
me moment he cried out they fired ; I mean the two men,

he should call upon God to forgive his villany; and 
with that word knocked him down with the stock of his 
musket, so that he never spoke more: there were three 
more in the company, and one of them was also slightly 
wounded. By this time I was come ; and when they saw 
their danger, and that it was in vain to resist, they begged 
for mercy. The captain told them he would spare their 
lives, if they would give him any assurance of their abhor- 
rence of the treachery they had been guilty of, and would 
swear to be faithful to him in recovering the ship, and 
afterwards in carrying her back to Jamaica, from whence 
they came. They gave him all the protestations* of their 
sincerity that could be desired, and he was willing to believe 
them, and spare their lives, which I was not against, only 
that I obliged him to keep them bound hand and foot 
while they were on the island. 

While this was doing, I sent Friday with the captain's 
mate to the boat, with orders to secure her, and bring 
away the bars and sails, which they did; and by-and-by 
three straggling men, that were (happily for them) parted 
from the rest, came back upon hearing the guns fired, and 
seeing the captain, who before was their prisoner, now 
their conqueror, they submitted to be bound also : and so 
our victory was complete. 

2. Crusoe and the Captain. — It now remained that 
the captain and I should inquire into one another's circum- 
stances. I began first, and told him my whole history, 
which he heard with an attention even to amazement ; and 
particularly at the wonderful manner of my being furnished 
with provisions and ammunition ; and, indeed, as my story 
is a whole collection of wonders, it affected him deeply. 
But when he reflected from thence upon himself, and how 
I seemed to have been preserved there on purpose to save 
his life, the tears ran down his face, and he could not speak 
a word more. After this communication was at an end, I 
carried him and his two men into my apartment, leading 
them in just where I came out, viz. at the top of the house, 
where I refreshed them with such provisions as I had, and 
showed them all the contrivances I had made during my 
long, long inhabiting that place. 



184 ADVENTURES OF 

All I showed them, all I said to them, was perfectly 
amazing ; but, above all, the captain admired my fortifica- 
tion, and how perfectly I had concealed my retreat with a 
grove of trees, which, having been now planted near twenty 
years, and the trees growing much faster than in England, 
was become a little wood, and so thick that it was impass- 
able in any part of it but at that one side where I had 
reserved my little winding passage into it. I told him this 
was my castle and my residence, but that I had a seat in 
the country, as most princes have, whither I could retreat 
upon occasion, and I would show him that too another 
time ; but at present our business was to consider how to 
recover the ship. 

He agreed with me as to that ; but told me he was per- 
fectly at a loss what measures to take, for that there were 
still six-and-twenty hands on board, who, having entered 
into a cursed conspiracy by which they had all forfeited 
their lives to the law, would be hardened in it now by des- 
peration, and would carry it on, knowing that, if they were 
subdued, they would be brought to the gallows, as soon as 
they came to England, or to any of the English colonies; 
and that, therefore, there would be no attacking them with 
so small a number as we were. 

I mused for some time upon what he had said, and found 
it was a very rational conclusion, and that,' therefore, some- 
thing was to be resolved on speedily, as well to draw the 
men on board into some snare for their surprise, as to 
prevent their landing upon us, and destroying us. Upon 
this,^ it presently occurred to me, that in a little while the 
ship's crew, wondering what was become of their comrades, 
and of the boat, would certainly come on shore in their 
other boat, to look for them ; and that then, perhaps, they 
might come armed, and be too strong for us: this he 
allowed to be rational. 

^,3. Cutting off the Retreat.— Upon this, I told him 
the first thmg we had to do was to stave the boat, which 
itV?^^ *^^ beach, so that they might not carry her off; 
and takmg everything out of her, leave her so far useless 

toow'' fv, ^ ^1°. l""^"^- Accordingly we went on board, 

took the arms which were left on board out of her, and 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 185 

whatever else we found there, which was a bottle of brandy, 
and another of rum, a few biscuit-cakes, a horn of powder, 
and a great lump of sugar in a piece of canvas (the sugar 
was five or six pounds) ; all which was very welcome to me, 
especially the brandy and sugar, of which I had none left 
for many years. 

When we had carried all these things on shore (the oars, 
mast, sail, and rudder of the boat were carried away before, 
as above), we knocked a great hole in her bottom, that if 
they had come strong enough to master us, yet they could 
not carry off the boat. Indeed, it was not much in my 
thoughts that we could be able to recover the ship ; but my 
view was, that if they went away without the boat, I did 
not much question to make her fit again to carry us to the 
Leeward Islands, and call upon our friends the Spaniards 
in my way ; for I had them still in my thoughts. 

While we were thus preparing our designs, and had first, 
by main strength, heaved the boat upon the beach so high 
that the tide would not float her off at high-water mark, and 
besides, had broke a hole in her bottom too big to be 
quickly stopped, and were set down musing what we should 
do, we heard the ship fire a gun, and saw her make a waft 
with her ensign as a signal for the boat to come on board : 
but no boat stirred ; and they fired several times, making 
other signals for the boat. 

4. A Critical Time. — At last, when all their signals 
and firing proved fruitless, and they found the boat did not 
stir, we saw them, by the help of my glasses, hoist another 
boat out, and row towards the shore ; and we found, as 
they approached, that there were no less than ten men in 
her, and that they had fire-arms with them. 

As the ship lay almost two leagues from the shore, we 
had a full view of them as they came, and a plain sight even 
of their faces ; because the tide having set them a little to 
the east of the other boat, they rowed up under shore, to 
come to the same place where the other had landed, and 
where the boat lay; by this means, I say, we had a full view 
of them, and the captain knew the persons and characters 
of all the men in the boat, of whom, he said, there were 
three very honest fellows, who, he was sure, were led into 



l86 ADVENTURES OF 

this conspiracy by the rest, being overpowered and 
frightened ; but that as for the boatswain, who, it seems, 
was the chief officer among them, and all the rest, they were 
outrageous as any of . the ship's crew, and were no doubt 
made desperate in their new enterprise; and terribly 
apprehensive he was that they would be too powerful for us. 

I smiled at him, and told him that men in our circum- 
stances were past the operation of fear ; that seeing almost 
every condition that could be was better than that which 
we were supposed to be in, we ought to expect that the 
consequence, whether death or life, would be sure to be a 
deliverance. I asked him what he thought of the circum- 
stances of my life, and whether a deliverance were not worth 
venturing for. "And where, sir," said I, "is your belief of my 
being preserved here on purpose to save your life, which 
elevated you a little while ago ? for my part," said I, " there 
seems to me but one thing amiss in all the prospect of it." 
'* What is that?" says he. "Why," says I, "it is, that as you 
say there are three or four honest fellows among them, which 
should be spared. Had they been all of the wicked part of 
the crew, I should have thought God's providence had 
singled them out to deliver them into your hands; for, 
depend upon it, every man that comes ashore are our own, 
and shall die or live as they behave to us." As I spoke this 
with a raised voice and cheerful countenance, I found it 
greatly encouraged him; so we set vigorously to our 
business. 

We had, upon the first appearance of the boat's coming 
from the ship, considered of separating our prisoners ; and 
we had, indeed, secured them effectually. Two of them, 
of whom the captain was less assured than ordinary, I sent 
with Friday, and one of the three delivered men, to my 
cave, where they were remote enough, and out of danger 
of being heard or discovered, or of finding their way out of 
the woods if they could have delivered themselves. Here 
they left them bound, but gave them provisions; and 
promised them if they continued there quietly, to give them 
their liberty in a day or two ; but that if they attempted 
their escape, they should be put to death without mercy. 
They promised faithfully to bear their confinement with 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 



187 



patience, and were very thankful that they had such good 
usage as to have provisions and light left them ; for Friday 
gave them candles (such as we made ourselves) for their 
comfort ; and they did not know but that he stood sentinel 
over them at the entrance. 

The other prisoners had better usage : two of them 
were kept pinioned,^ indeed, because the captain was not 
free to trust them ; but the other two were taken into my 
service, upon the captain's recommendation, and upon their 
solemnly engaging to live and die with us. So with them 
and the three honest men we were seven men well armed ; 
and I made no doubt we should be able to deal well enough 
with the ten that were coming, considering that the captain 
had said that there were three or four honest men among 
them also.

XXIX.— SNARING THE REBELS. 

I. The Mutineers* Surprise. — As soon as the men 
got to the place where their other boat lay, they ran their boat 
into the beach, and came on shore, hauling the boat up 
after them, which I was glad to see ; for I was afraid they 
would rather have left the boat at an anchor, some distance 
from the shore, with some hands in her to guard her, and 
so we should not be able to seize the boat. Being on shore, 
the first thing they did, they ran all to their other boat j and 
it was easy to see they were under a great surprise to 
find her stripped, as above, of all that was in her, 
and a great hole in her bottom. After they had mused 
awhile upon this, they set up two or three great shouts, 
hallooing with all their might, to try if they could make 
their companions hear ; but all was to no purpose : then 
they came all close in a ring, and fired a volley of their 
small ^rms, which, indeed, we heard} and the echoes made 



i88 ADTEsrmES of 

the wooAs ling : bat it was all one : those in the cave we 
were sure coold no( hear ; and those in our keeping, though 
dier heard it weQ enough, ret durst give no answer to theuL 
Tber were so astonished at the surprise of this, that, as they 
told us afterwards, they resolved to go all on board again 
to their ship, and let them know that the men were all 
murdered, and the long-boat staved; accordingly, they 
inmiediateiy launched their boat again, and got all of them 
on board. 

The captain was terribly amazed and even confounded 
at this, believing they would go on board the ship again, 
and set sail, giving their comrades over for lost, and so he 
should still lose the ship, which he was in hopes we should 
have recovered ; but he was quickly as much frightened the 
other way. 

They had not been long put off with the boat, but we 
perceived them all coming on shore again ; but with this 
new measure in their conduct, which it seems they con- 
sulted together upon, viz., to leave three men in the boat, 
and the rest to go on shore, and go up into the country to 
look for their fellows. This was a great disappointment to 
us, for now we were at a loss what to do ; as our seizing 
those seven men on shore would be no advantage to us. if 
we let the boat escape ; because they would then row 
away to the ship, and then the rest of them would be sure 
to weigh and set sail, and so our recovering the ship would 
be lost. 

However, we had no remedy but to wait and see what 
the issue^ of things might present The seven men came 
on shore, and the three who remained in the boat put her 
off to a good distance from the shore, and came to an 
anchor to wait for them ; so that it was impossible for us 
to come at them in the boat. Those that came on shore 
kept close together, marching towards the top of the little 
hill under which my habitation lay ; and we could see 
them plainly, though they could not perceive us. We could 
have been very glad they would have come nearer to us, so 
that we might have fired at them, or that they would have 
gone farther off, that we might have come abroad. But 
when they were come to the brow of the hill, where they 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 189 

could see a great way into the valleys and woods, which lay 
towards the north-east part, and where the island lay 
lowest, they shouted and hallooed till they were weary ; and 
not caring, it seems, to venture far from the shore, nor far 
from one another, they sat down together under a tree, to 
consider of it. Had they thought fit to have gone to sleep 
there, as the other part of them had done, they had done 
the job for us ; but they were two full of apprehensions of 
danger to venture to go to sleep, though they could not tell 
what the danger was they had to fear neither. 

2. Tactics of War. — ^The captain made a very just 
proposal to me upon this consultation of theirs, viz., that 
perhaps they would all fire a volley again, to endeavour to 
make their fellows hear, and that we should all sally upon 
them, just at the juncture^ when their pieces were all dis- 
charged, and they would certainly yield, and we should 
have them without bloodshed. I liked this proposal, pro- 
vided it was done while we were near enough to come up 
to them before they could load their pieces again. 

But this event did not happen ; and we lay still a long 
time, very irresolute what course to take. At length I told 
them there would be nothing done, in my opinion, till night; 
and then, if they did not return to the boat, perhaps we 
might find a way to get between them and the shore, and so 
might use some stratagem with them in the boat to get 
them on shore. We waited a great while, though very 
impatient for their removing ; and were very uneasy when, 
after long consultations, we saw them all start up, and march 
down towards the sea : it seems they had such dreadful 
apprehensions upon them of the danger of the place, that 
they resolved to go on board the ship again, give their 
companions over for lost, and so go on with their intended 
voyage with the ship. 

As soon as I perceived them to go towards the shore, I 
imagined it to be, as it really was, that they had given over 
their search, and were for going back again ; and the 
captain, as soon as I told him my thoughts, was ready to 
sink at the apprehensions of it : but I presently thought 
of a stratagem to fetch them back again, and which 
answered my end to a tittle.^ I ordered Friday and the 



190 ADVENTURES OF 

captain's mate to go over the little creek westward, towards 
the place where the savages came on shore when Friday 
was rescued, and as soon as they came to a little rising 
ground at about half a mile distance, I bade them halloo 
out as loud as they could, and wait till they found the sea- 
men heard them } that as soon as ever they heard the sea- 
men answer them, they should return it again ; and then, 
keeping out of sight, take a round, always answering when 
the others hallooed, to draw them as far into the island, 
and among the woods, as possible, and then wheel about 
again to me, by such ways as I directed them. 

They were just going into the boat when Friday and 
the mate hallooed : and they presently heard them, and 
answering them, ran along the shore westward, towards the 
voice they heard, when they were presently stopped by the 
creek, where the water being up, they could not get over, 
and called for the boat to come up and set them over ; as, 
indeed, I expected. When they had set themselves over, I 
observed that the boat being gone a good way into the 
creek, and, as it were, in a harbour within the land, they 
took one of the three men out of her, to go along with 
them> and left only two in the boat, having fastened her to 
the stump of a little tree on the shore. 

This was what I wished for ; and immediately leaving 
Friday and the captain's mate to their business, I took the 
rest with me, and crossing the creek out of their sight, 
we surprised the two men before they were aware — one of 
them lying on the shore, and the other being in the boat 
The fellow on shore was between sleeping and waking, and 
going to start up : the captain, who was foremost, ran in 
upon him, and knocked him down ; and then called out to 
him in the boat to yield, or he was a dead man. There 
needed very few arguments to persuade a single man to 
yield, when he saw five men upon him, and his comrade 
knocked down; besides, this was, it seems, one of the 
three who were not so hearty in the mutiny as the rest of 
the crew, and therefore was easily persuaded not only to 
yield, but afterwards to join very sincerely with us. 

In the meantime, Friday and the captain's mate so well 
managed their business with the rest, that they drew them, 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. I91 

by hallooing and answering, from one hill to another, and 
from one wood to another, till they not only heartily tired 
them, but left them where they were very sure they could 
not reach back to the boat before it was dark ; and, indeed, 
they were heartily tired themselves also, by the time they 
came back to us. 

3. Walking into the Trap. — We had nothing now 
to do but to watch for them in the dark, and to fall upon 
them, so as to make sure work with them. It was several 
hours after Friday came back to me before they came back 
to their boat j and we could hear the foremost of them, 
long before they came quite up, calling to those behind to 
come along ; and we could also hear them answer, and com- 
plain how lame and tired they were, and not able to come 
any faster, which was very welcome news to us. 

At length they came up to the boat ; but it is impossible 
to express their confusion when they found the boat fast 
aground in the creek, the tide ebbed out, and their two 
men gone. We could hear them call to one another in a 
most lamentable manner, telling one another they were got 
into an enchanted island ; that either there were inhabitants 
in it, and they should all be murdered, or else there were 
devils and spirits in it, and they should be all carried away 
and devoureJ. They hallooed again, and called their two 
comrades by their names a great many times ; but no answer. 
After some time, we could see them, by the little light 
there was, run about, wringing their hands like men in 
despair ; and that sometimes they would go and sit down 
in the boat, to rest themselves ; then come ashore again, 
and walk about again, and so the same thing over again. 

My men would fain* have had me give them leave to fall 
upon them at once in the dark ; but I was willing to take 
them at some advantage, so to spare them, and kill as few 
of them as I could; and especially I was unwilling to 
hazard the killing any of our men, knowing the others were 
very well armed. I resolved to wait, to see if they did not 
separate ; and therefore, to make sure of them, I drew my 
ambuscade^ nearer, and ordered Friday and the captain to 
creep upon their hands and feet, as close to the ground as 
they could, that they might not be discovered, and get as 



192 ADVENTURES OF 

near them as they could possibly, before they offered to 
fire. 

They had not been long in that posture, when the boat- 
si^ain, who was the principal ringleader of the mutiny, and 
had now shown himself the most dejected and dispirited of 
all the rest, came walking towards them, with two more of 
the crew. The captain was so eager at having this principal 
rogue so much in his power, that he could hardly have 
patience to let him come so near as to be sure of him, for 
they only heard his tongue before ; but when they came 
nearer, the captain and Friday, starting up on their feet, let 
fly at them. The boatswain was killed upon the spot ; the 
next man was shot in the body, and fell just by him, though 
he did not die till an hour or two after ; and the third ran 
for it. 

At the noise of the fire, I immediately advanced with my 
whole army, which was now eight men, viz. myself, general- 
issimo ; Friday, my lieutenant-general ; the captain and his 
two men, and the three prisoners of war, whom we had 
trusted with arms. We came upon them, indeed, in the 
dark, so that they could not see our number ; and I made 
the man they had left in the boat, who was now one of us, 
to call them by name, to try if I could bring them to a 
parley, and so might perhaps reduce them to terms^ which 
fell out just as we desired; for, indeed, it was easy to 
think, as their condition then was, they would be willing to 
capitulate.* 

So he calls out, as loud as he could, to one of them, 
" Tom Smith ! Tom Smith ! "—Tom Smith answered im- 
mediately, " Is that Robinson ? " for it seems he knew the 
voice, — The other answered, " Ay, ay 3 for God's sake, Tom 
Smith, throw down yoiur arms and yield, or you are all dead 
men this moment."—" Who must we yield to ? Where are 
they?** says Smith again.— " Here they are," says he; 
** here's our captain and fifty men with him, have been 
hunting you these two hours : the boatswam is killed. Will 
Fry is wounded, and I am a prisoner ; and if you do not 
yield, you are all lost"— "Will they give us quarter,Uhen?" 
says Tom Smith, "and we will yield."— •' I will go ask, if you 
promise to yield," says Robinson. So he asked the captain; 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 1 93 

and the captain himself then calls out, " You, Smith, you 
know my voice ; if you lay down your arms immediately, 
and submit, you shall have your lives, all but Will Atkins." 

4- Submission of the Rebels. — Upon this, Will Atkins 
cried out, " For God's sake, captain, give me quarter ; what 
have I done? They have all been as bad as I," which, by 
the way, was not true neither ; for, it seems, this Will Atkins 
was the first man that laid hold of the captain when they 
first mutinied, and used him barbarously, in tying his hands, 
and giving him injurious language. However, the captain 
told him he must lay down his arms at discretion,^ and trust 
to the governor's mercy, by which he meant me, for they 
all called me governor. 

In a word, they all laid down their arms, and begged their 
lives ; and I sent the man that had parleyed with them, and 
two more, who bound them all ; and then my great army of 
fifty men, which, particularly with those three, were in all but 
eight, came up and seized upon them, and upon their boat ; 
only that I kept myself and one more out of sight for reasons 
of state. 

Our next work was to repair the boat, and think of seizing 
the ship ; and as for the captain, now he had leisure to 
parley with them, he expostulated® with them upon the villany 
of their practices with him, and at length upon the further 
wickedness of their design, and how certainly it must bring 
them to misery and distress in the end, and perhaps to the 
gallows. 

They all appeared very penitent, and begged hard for their 
lives. As for that, he told them they were none of his 
prisoners, but the commander of the island; that they 
thought they had set him on shore on a barren, uninhabited 
island ; but it had pleased God so to direct them, that it was 
inhabited, and that the governor was an Englishman ; that 
he might hang them all there, if he pleased ; but as he had 
given them all quarter, he supposed he would send them to 
England, to be dealt with there as justice required, except 
Atkins, whom he was commanded by the governor to advise 
to prepare for death, for that he would be hanged in the 
morning. 

Though all this was but a fiction of his own, yet it had 

N

its desired efifect : Atkins fell upon his knees, to beg the 
captain to intercede with the governor for his life ; and all 
the rest begged of him, for God's sake, that they might not 
be sent to England.

yj^.— RECOVERY OF THE SHIP. 

I. Crusoe's Project — It now occurred to me, that the 
time of our deliverance was come, and that it would be a 
most easy thing to bring these fellows in to be hearty in 
getting possession of the ship ; so I retired in the dark from 
them, that they might not see what kind of a governor they 
had, and called the captain to me. When I called, as at a 
good distance, one of the men was ordered to speak again, 
and say to the captain, '' Captain, the commander calls for 
you ; " and presently the captain replied, " Tell his excellency 
I am just a-coming." This more perfectly amused* them, and 
they all believed that the commander was just by with his 
fifty men. Upon the captain's coming to me, I told him my 
project for seizing the ship, which he liked wonderfully well, 
and resolved to put it in execution the next morning. But, 
in order to execute it with more heart, and to be secure of 
success, I told him we must divide the prisoners, and 
that he should go and take Atkins and two more 
of the worst of them, and send them pinioned to the 
cave where the others lay. This was committed to Friday 
and the two men who came on shore with the captain. 
They conveyed them to the cave as to a prison ; and it was, 
indeed, a dismal place, especially to men in their condition. 
The others I ordered to my bower, as I called it, of which 
I have given a full description ; and as it was fenced in, and 
they pinioned, the place was secure enough, considering 
they were upon their behaviour. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 195 

To these in the morning I sent the captain, who was to 
enter into a parley with them ; in a word, to try them, and 
tell me whether he thought they might be trusted or no to 
go on board and surprise the ship. He talked to them of 
the injury done him, of the condition they were brought to, 
and that though the governor had given them quarter for 
their lives as to the present action, yet that if they were sent 
to England, they would all be hanged in chains, to be sure ; 
but that if they would join in so just an attempt as to recover 
the ship, he would have the governor's engagement for 
their pardon. 

Any one may guess how readily such a proposal would be 
accepted by men in their condition; they fell down on 
their knees to the captain, and promised, with the deepest 
imprecations,^ that they would be faithful to him to the last 
drop, and that they should owe their lives to him, and 
would go with him all over the world ; that they would own 
him as a father as long as they lived. 

" Well," says the captain, " I must go and tell the 
governor what ^ou say, and see what I can do to bring him 
to consent to it." So he brought me an account of the 
temper he found them in, and that he verily believed they 
would be faithful. 

However, that we might be very secure, I told him he 
should go back again and choose out five of them, and tell 
them, they might see that he did not want men, that he would 
take out those five to be his assistants, and that the governor 
would keep the other two, and the three that were sent pri- 
soners to the castle (my cave) as hostages for the fidelity of 
those five ; and that if they proved unfaithful in the execu- 
tion, the five hostages should be hanged in chains alive on 
the shore. This looked severe, and convinced them that 
the governor was in earnest : however, they had no way left 
them but to accept it ; and it was now the business of the 
prisoners, as much as of the captain, to persuade the other 
five to do their duty. 

2. The Attacking Party. — Our strength was now 
thus ordered for the expedition : first, the captain, his mate, 
and passenger ; second, the two prisoners of the first gang, 
to whom, having their character from the captain, I had 



196 ADTENTURES OF 

given their liberty, and trusted them with arms ; third, the 
other two that I had kept till now in my bower pinioned, 
but, on the <^ptain*s motion, had now released; fourth, these 
five released at last ; so that they were twelve in all, besides 
five we kept prisoners in the cave for hostages. 

I asked the captain if he was willing to venture with 
these hands on board the ship : but as for me and my man 
Friday, I did not think it was proper for us to stir, having 
seven men left behind ; and it was employment enough for 
us to keep them asunder, and supply them with victuals. As 
to the five in the cave, I resolved to keep them fast, but 
Friday went in twice a day to them, to supply them with 
necessaries ; and I made the other two carry provisions to 
a certain distance, where Friday was to take it. 

When I showed myself to the two hostages,^ it was with the 
captain, who told them I was the person the governor had 
ordered to look after them; and that it was the governor's 
pleasure they should not stir anywhere but by my direction; 
that if they did, they would be fetched into the castle, and 
be laid in irons : so that as we never suffered them to see me 
as a governor, I now appeared as another person, and spoke 
of the governor, the garrison, the castle, and the like, upon 
all occasions. 

The captain now had no difficulty before him, but to fur- 
nish his two boats, stop the breach of one, and man them. 
He made his passenger captain of one, with four of the men ; 
and himself, his mate, and five more went in the other; 
and they contrived their business very well, for they came 
up to the ship about midnight. 

3. The Attack. — ^As soon as they came within call of 
the ship, he made Robinson hail them, and tell them they 
had brought off the men and the boat, but that it was a long 
time before they had found them, and the like, holding 
them in a chat till they came to the ship's side ; when the 
captain and the mate entering first, with their arms, imme- 
diately knocked down the second mate and carpenter with 
the butt end of their muskets, being very faithfully seconded 
by their men ; they secured all the rest that were upon the 
main and quarter decks, and began to fasten the hatches,^ to 
keep them down that were below; when the other boat 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 



197 



and their men, entering at the forechains, secured the fore- 
castle of the ship, and the scuttle* which went down into 
the cook-room, making three men they found there 
prisoners. 

When this was done, and all safe upon deck, the captain 
ordered the mate, with three men, to break into the round- 
house, where the new rebel captain lay, who, having taken 
the alarm, had got up, and with two men and a boy had got 
fire-arms in their hands ; and when the mate, with a crow, 
split open the door, the new captain and his men fired 
boldly among them, and wounded the mate with a musket- 
ball, which broke his arm, and wounded two more of the 
men, but killed nobody. The mate calling for help, rushed, 
however, into the round-house, wounded as he was, and with 
his pistol shot the new captain through the head, the bullet 
entering at his mouth, and came out again behind one of his 
ears, so that he never spoke a word more : upon which the 
rest yielded, and the ship was taken effectually, without any 
more lives lost

XKXl.— ROBINSON TAKES HIS FAREWELL. 

I. Mutual Congratulations. — ^As soon as the ship 
was thus secured, the captain ordered seven guns to be 
fired, which was the signal agreed upon with me to give me 
notice of his success, which you may be sure I was very 
glad to hear, having sat watching upon the shore for it till 
near two o'clock in the morning. Having thus heard the 
signal plainly, I laid me down ; and it having been a day of 
great fatigue to me, I slept very sound, till I was something 
surprised with the noise of a gun ; and presently starting up, I 
heard a man call me by the name of " Governor, Governor," 
and presently I knew the captain's voice ; when climbing 
up to the top of the hill, there he stood, and pointing to the 
ship, he embraced me in his arms. " My dear friend and 



198 ADVENTURES OF 

deliverer," says he, " there's your ship, for she is all yours, and 
so are we, and all that belong to her." I cast my eyes to the 
ship, and there she rode within little more than half a mile 
of the shore ; for they had weighed her anchor as soon as 
they were masters of her, and the weather being fair, had, 
brought her to an anchor just against the mouth of the little 
creek ; and the tide being up, the captain had brought the 
pinnace^ in near the place where I first landed my rafts, and 
so landed just at my door. 

I was at first ready to sink down with the surprise ; for I 
saw my deliverance, indeed, visibly put into my hands, all 
things easy, and a large ship just ready to carry me away 
whither I pleased to go. At first, for some time, I was not 
able to answer him one word ; but as he had taken me in 
his arms, I held fast by him, or I should have fallen to the 
ground. He perceived the surprise, and immediately pulls 
a bottle out of his pocket, and gave me a dram of cordial, 
which he had brought on purpose for n^e. After I had drunk 
it, I sat down upon the ground ; and though it brought me 
to myself, yet it was a good while before I could speak a 
word to him. 

All this time the poor man was in as great an ecstasy as I, 
only not under any surprise, as I was; and he said a 
thousand kind and tender things to me, to compose and 
bring me to myself; but such was the flood of joy in my 
breast, that it put all my spirits into confusion : at last it 
broke out into tears, and in a little while after I recovered 
my speech. 

I then took my turn, and embraced him as my deliverer, 
and we rejoiced together. I told him I looked upon him 
as a man sent from Heaven to deliver me, and that the 
whole transaction seemed to be a chain of wonders ; that 
such things as these were the testimonies we had of a secret 
hand of providence governing the world, and an evidence 
that the eye of an Infinite Power could search into the 
remotest corner of the world, and send help to the miserable 
whenever he pleased. I forgot not to lift up my heart in 
thankfulness to Heaven ; and what heart could forbear to 
bless him who had not only in a miraculous manner provided 
for me in such a wilderness, and in such a desolate condition, 



• 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 1 99 



but from whom every deliverance must always be acknow- 
ledged to proceed ? 

2. An Acceptable Gift — ^When we had talked a while 
the captain told me he had brought me some little refresh- 

w ment, such as the ship afforded, and such as the wretches 
that had been so long his masters had not plundered him of. 
Upon this he called aloud to the boat, and bade his men 
bnng the things ashore that were for the governor; and indeed 
it was a present as if I had been one that was not to be 
carried away with them, but as if I had been to dwell upon 
the island still. First, he had brought me a case of bottles full 
of excellent cordial waters, six large bottles of Madeira wine 
(the bottles held two quarts each), two pounds of excellent 
good tobacco, twelve good pieces of the ship's beef, and six 
pieces of pork, with a bag of peas, and about a hundred- 
weight of biscuit; he also brought me a box of sugar, a box 
of dour, a bag full of lemons, and two bottles of lime-juice, and 
abundance of other things. But, besides these, and what 
was a thousand times more useful to me, he brought me six 
new clean shirts, six very good neckcloths, two pairs of 
gloves, one pair of shoes, a hat, and one pair of stockings, 
with a very good suit of clothes of his own, which had been 
worn but very little ; in a word, he clothed me from head to 
foot. It was a very kind and agreeable present, as any one 
may imagine, to one in my circumstances ; but never was any- 
thing in the world of that kind so unpleasant, awkward, and 
uneasy as it was to me to wear such clothes at first. 

3. Crusoe as Governor. — After these ceremonies were 
past, and after all his good things were brought into my 
little apartment, we began to consult what was to be done 
with the prisoners we had; for it was worth considering 
whether we might venture to take them away with us or no, 
especially two of them, whom we knew to be incorrigible and 
refractory to the last degree •? and the captain said he knew 
they were such rogues, that there was no obliging them ; and 
if he did carry them away, it must be in irons, as malefactors, 
to be delivered over to justice at the first English colony he 
could come at ; and I found that the captain himself was 
very anxious about it 

Upon this I told him, that if he desired it, I would 



mioertike to hasig tbe two men he spckic of to make their 
ovT&ieraesiiiLixtesboaldleaLve them upon the island ''I 
sbocLc be Tenr gl&d of that.'' saiys the captain, ''with all 
my heart.'" — ^^'W^I,' says I, ^ I wiU send for them up, and talk 
wish xhem for yofCL^ So I caused Friday and the two 
hoscagcs — for they veie now disdiaiged, their comrades 
ha¥ic§ poforoed their promise — I say I caused them to go 
to ihe cave, and bring up the five men, pinioned as they 
were, to the bov«r, and keep them theie till I came. 

A^er scMDoe time, I came thither diessed in my newhabit ; 
and now I was called gofemor again. Being all met, and 
the captain with me, I caused the men to be thought before 
me, and I told them I had got a lull account of their 
riUanous bdiaviour to the captain, and how they had run 
away with the diip. and were preparing to commit further 
robberies, but that PioTidence had ensnared them in their 
own ways, and that they were £adlen into the pit which they 
had dug for others. 1 1^ them know that by my direction 
the ship had been seiied ; that she lay now in the road ; and 
they might see, by-and-by, that their newcaptain had received 
the reward of his viUany, and that they would see him hanging 
at the yard-arm : that as to them, I wanted to know what 
they had to say why I should not execute them as pirates, 
taken in the fiaict, as by my commission^ they could not doubt 
but I had authority so to da 

One of them answered in the name of the rest, that they 
had nothing to say but this, that when they were taken, 
the captain promised them their lives, and they humbly 
implored my mercy. But I told them I knew not what 
mercy to show them ; for as for myself, I had resolved to 
quit the island with all my men, and had taken passage with 
the captain to go for England; and as for the captain, 
he could not carry them to England other than as prisoners, 
in irons, to be tried for mutiny, and running away with the 
ship; the consequence of which, they must needs know, 
would be the gallows : so I could not tell what ¥ras best for 
them, unless they had a mind to take their fate in the island. 
If they desired that, as I had liberty to leave the island, I 
had some inclination to give them their lives, if they thought 
they could shift on shore. They seemed very thankful for it, 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 20I 

and said they would much rather venture to stay there than 
be carried to England to be hanged; so I left it on that 
issue. 

However, the captain seemed to make some difficulty of 
it, as if he durst not leave them there. Upon this I seemed 
a little angry with the captain, and told him that they were 
my prisoners, not his ; and seeing that I had offered them 
so much favour, I would be as good as my word; and 
that if he did not think fit to consent to it, I would set 
them at liberty, as I found them ; and if he did not like it, 
he might take them again if he could catch them. Upon 
this th^y appeared very thankful, and I accordingly set them 
at liberty, and bade them retire into the woods to the place 
whence they came, and I would leave them some fire-arms, 
some ammunition, and some directions how they should live 
very well, if they thought fit. 

Upon this I prepared to go on board the ship ; but told 
the captain I would stay that night to prepare my things, 
and desired him to go on board in the meantime, and keep 
all right in the ship, and send the boat on shore next day 
for me ; ordering him, at all events, to cause the new captain, 
who was killed, to be hanged at the yard-arm, that these 
men might see him. 

When the captain was gone, I sent for the men up to me 
to my apartment, and entered seriously into discourse with 
them on their circumstances. I told them I thought they 
had made a right choice ; that if the captain had carried 
them away, they would certainly be hanged. I showed them 
the new captain hanging at the yard-arm of the ship, and 
told them they had nothing less to expect. 

When they had all declared their willingness to stay, I 
then told them I would let them into the story of my living 
there, and put them into the way of making it easy to them. 
Accordingly, I gave them the whole history of the place, and 
of my coming to it ; showed them my fortifications, the 
way I made my bread, planted my corn, cured my grapes ; 
and, in a word, all that was necessary to make them easy. 
I told them the story also of the seventeen Spaniards that 
were to be expected, for whom I left a letter, and made 
them promise to treat them in common with themselves. 



a02 ADVENTURES OF 

Here it may be noted that the captain had ink on board, who 
was greatly surprised that I never hit upon a way of making 
ink of charcoal and water, or of something else, as I had 
done things much more difficult. 

I left them my fire-arms, viz. five muskets, three fowling- 
pieces, and three swords. I had above a barrel and a half 
of powder left ; for after the first year or two I used but 
little, and wasted none. I gave them a description of the 
way I managed the goats, and directions to milk and fatten 
them, and to make both butter and cheese : in a word, 
I gave them every part of my own story, and told them 
I should prevail upon the captain to leave them two barrels 
of gunpowder more, and some garden seeds, which 1 told 
them I would have been very glad of : also I gave them the 
bag of peas which the captain had brought me to eat, and 
bade them be sure to sow and increase them. 

4. Crusoe's Departure. — Having done all this, I left 
them the next day, and went on board the ship. We pre- 
pared immediately to sail, but did not weigh* that night 
The next morning early, two of the five men came swimming 
to the ship's side, and making a most lamentable complaint 
of the other three, begged to be taken into the ship, for God's 
sake, for they should be murdered, and begged the captain 
to take them on board, though he hanged them immediately. 
Upon this, the captain pretended to have no power without 
me; but after some difficulty, and after their solemn 
promises of amendment, they were taken on board, and were 
some time after soundly whipped and pickled, after which 
they proved very honest and quiet fellows. 

Some time after this, the boat was ordered on shore, the 
tide being up, with the things promised to the men; to which 
the captain, at my intercession, caused their chests and 
clothes to be added, which they took, and were very thankful 
for. I also encouraged them, by telling them that if it lay 
in my power to send any vessel to take them in, I would not 
forget them. 

When I took leave of this island, I carried on board, for 
relics, the great goat-skin cap I had made, my umbrella, 
and one of my parrots ; also I forgot not to take the money 
I formerly mentioned, which had laid^ by me so long useless

that it was grown rusty or tarnished, and could hardly pass 
for silver till it had been a little rubbed and handled, as 
also the money I found in the wreck of the Spanish ship. 

And thus I left the island, the 19th of December, as I found 
by the ship's account, in the year 1686, after I had been 
upon it eight-and-twenty years, two months, and nineteen 
days j being delivered from this second captivity the same 
day of the month that I first made my escape in the long- 
boat from among the Moors of Sallee. In this vessel, after 
a long voyage, I arrived in England the nth of June, in the 
year 1687, having been thirty-five years absent.

XKXll.— ROBINSON MEETS OLD FRIENDS. 

I. Crusoe in England Again. — When I came to 
England, I was as perfect a stranger to all the world as if I 
had never been known there. My benefactor and faithful 
steward, who I had left in trust with my money, was alive, 
but had had great misfortunes in the world ; was become a 
widow the second time, and very low in the world. I made 
her easy as to what she owed me, assuring her I would give 
her no trouble ; but on the contrary, in gratitude to her 
former care and faithfulness to me, I relieved her as my 
little stock would afford, which at that time would indeed 
allow me to do but little for her ; but I assured her I would 
never forget her former kindness to me ; nor did I forget 
her, when I had sufficient to help her, as shall be observed 
in its place. 

I went down afterwards into Yorkshire, but my father 
was dead, and my mother, and all the family extinct, except 
that I found two sisters, and two of the children of one of 
my brothers ; and as I had been long given over for dead, 
there had been no provision made for me : so that in a 



204 ADVENTURES OF 

word, I found nothing to relieve or assist me ; and that 
little money I had, would not do much for me, as to settling 
in the world. 

I met with one piece of gratitude, indeed, which I did 
not expect ; and this was, that the master of the ship, whom 
I had so happily delivered, and by the same means saved 
the ship and cargo, having given a very handsome account 
to the owners of the manner how I had saved the lives of 
the men and the ship, they invited me to meet them and 
some merchants concerned, and all together they made me 
a very handsome compliment upon the subject, and a 
present of almost two hundred pounds sterling. 

But after making several reflections upon the circum- 
stances of my life, and how little way this would go towards 
settling me in the world, I resolved to go to Lisbon, and 
see if I might not come by some information of the state 
of my plantation in the Brazils, and of what was become of 
my partner, who I had reason to suppose had some years 
now given me over for dead. 

With this view I took shipping for Lisbon, where I 
arrived in April following ; my man Friday accompanying 
me very honestly in all ramblings, and proving a most 
faithful servant upon all occasions. 

2. A Visit to Lisbon. — ^When I came to Lisbon, I 
found out by inquiry, and to my particular satisfaction, my 
old friend the captain of the ship, who first took me up at 
sea, off the shore of Africa. He was now grown old, and 
had left ofif the sea, having put his son, who was far from a 
young man, into his ship, and who still used the Brazil 
trade. The old man did not know me, and, indeed, I 
hardly knew him ; but I soon brought him to my 
remembrance, and as soon brought myself to his remem- 
brance, when I told him who I was. 

After some passionate expressions^ of the old acquaintance^ 
I inquired, you may be sure, after my plantation and my 
partner. The old man told me he had not been in the 
Brazils for about nine years ; but that he could assure me^ 
that when he came away, my partner was living, but the 
trustees, who I had joined with him to take cogohsDCtf 
of my part, were both dead; that, however, he believed 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 205 

that I would have a very good account of the improvement 
of the plantation ; for that upon the general belief of my 
being cast away, and drowned, my trustees had given in the 
account of the produce of my part of the plantation to the 
Procurator Fiscal,' who had appropriated it, in case I never 
came to claim it — one-third to the king, and two-thirds to 
the monastery of St. Augustine, to be expended for the 
benefit of the poor, and for the conversion of the Indians 
to the Catholic faith ; but that if I appeared, or any one 
for me, to claim the inheritance, it should be restored, only 
that the improvement, or annual production, being dis- 
tributed to charitable uses, could not be restored. But he 
assured me, that the steward of the king's revenue (from 
lands) and the proviedore, or steward of the monastery, 
had taken great care all along, that the incumbent, that is 
to say my partner, gave every year a faithful account of the 
produce, of which they received duly my moiety. 

I asked him if he knew to what height of improvement 
he had brought the plantation, and whether he thought it 
might be worth looking after, orwhetheronmygoing thither 
I should meet with no obstruction to my possessing my just 
right in the moiety. 

He told me he could not tell exactly to what degree the 
plantation was improved, but this he knew, that my partner 
was grown exceeding rich upon the enjoying but one half 
of it ; and that, to the best of his remembrance, he had 
heard that the king's third of my part, which was it seems 
granted away to some other monastery, or religious house, 
amounted to above two hundred moidores* a year: that as 
to my being restored to a quiet possession of it, there was 
no question to be made of that, my partner being alive to 
witness my title, and my name being also enrolled in the 
register of the country. Also he told me, that the survivors 
of my two trustees were very fair, honest people, and very 
wealthy; and he believed I would not only have their 
assistance for putting me in possession, but would find a 
very considerable sum of money in their hands for my 
account, being the produce of the farm while their fathers 
held the trust, and before it was given up as above, which, as 
he remembered, was for about twelve years. 



2o6 ADTENTURXS OF 

I showed mysdf a little ocmcenied and uneasy at this 
account, and inquired of the 6Ld captain how it came to 
pass that the trustees should thus dispose my effects when 
he knew that I had made my will, and had made him, the 
Portuguese captain, my universal heir, &c. 

He told me that was true ; butthat as there was no proof 
of my being dead, he could not act as executor,^ until some 
certain account should come of my death, and that besides 
he was not willing to intermeddle with a thing so remote ; 
that it was true he had registered my will, and put in his 
claim ; and could he have given any account of my being 
dead or alive, he would have acted by procuration,* and 
taken possession of the Ingenio (so they called the sugar- 
house), and had given his son, who was now at the Bra^s, 
order to do it 

" But," says the old man, " I have one piece of newstotell 
you, which perhaps may not be so acceptable to you as 
the rest, and that is, that believing you were lost, and all the 
world believing so also, your partner and trustees did offsr 
to account to me in your name for six or eight of the first 
years of profits, which I received ; but there being at that 
time," says he, " great disbursements^ for increasing Reworks, 
building an Ingenio, and buying slaves, it did not amount to 
near so much as afterwards it produced: however," says the 
old man, " I shall give you a true account of what I have 
received in all, and how I have disposed of it" 

3. An Honourable Friend — ^After a few days' further 
conference with this ancient friend, he brought me an 
account of the six first years' income of my plantation, 
signed by my partner and the merchants trustees, being 
always delivered in goods, viz., tobacco in roll, and sugar 
in chests, besides rum, molasses, &c., which is the conse- 
quence® of a sugar work ; and I found by this account, that 
every year the income considerably increased, but, as above, 
the disbursement being large, the sum at first was small. 
However, the old man let me see that he was debtor to me 
470 moidores of gold, besides 60 chests of sugar, and 15 
double rolls of tobacco which were lost in his ship; he 
havingbeen shipwrecked coming home to Lisbon about eleven 
years after my leaving the place. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 207 

The good man then began to complain of his misfortunes, 
and how he had been obliged to make use of my money to 
recover his losses, and buy him a share in a new ship. 
" However, my old friend," says he, " you shall not want a 
supply in your necessity ; and as soon as my son returns, 
you shall be fully satisfied." 

Upon this, he pulls out an old pouch, and gives me i6o 
Portugal moidores in gold ; and giving me the writing of 
his title to the ship, which his son was gone to the Brazils 
in, of which he was a quarter-part owner, and his son 
another, he puts them both into my hands for security of 
the rest. 

I was too much moved with the honesty and kindness of 
the poor man to be able to bear this ; and remembering 
what he had done for me, how he had taken me up at sea, 
and how generously he had used me on all occasions, and 
particularly how sincere a friend he was now to me, I could 
hardly refrain weeping at what he said to me. Therefore, 
first I asked him, if his circumstances admitted him to 
spare so much money at that time, and if it would not 
straiten him. He told me he could not say, but it might 
straiten him a little ; but however it was my money, and 
I might want it more than he. 

Everything the good man said was full of affection, and 
I could hardly refrain from tears while he spoke. In short, 
I took a hundred of the moidores, and called for a pen and 
ink to give him a receipt for them ; then I returned him 
the rest, and told him, if ever I had possession of the plan- 
tation, I would return the other to him also, as indeed I 
afterwards did : and that as to the bill of sale of his part in 
his son's ship, I would not take it by any means ; but that 
if I wanted the money, I found he was honest enough to 
pay me ; and if I did not, but came to receive what he gave 
me reason to expect, I would never have a penny more 
from him. 

When this was past, the old man began to ask me if he 
should put me into a method to make my claim to my 
plantation. I told him I thought to go over to it myself. 
He said I might do so if I pleased ; but that if I did not, 
there were ways enough to secure my right, and im-

mediately to appropriate the profits to my use; and as 
there were ships in the River of Lisbon* just ready to go 
away to Brazil, he made me enter my name in a public 
register, with his affidavit,^*^ affirming upon oath that I was 
alive, and that I was the same person who took up the land 
for the planting the said plantation at first. 

This beingregularly attested bya notary," and a procuration 
affixed, he directed me to send it with a letter of his writing 
to a merchant of his acquaintance at the place, and then pro- 
posed my staying with him till an account came of the return. 

4. Crusoe becomes Rich. — Never anything was more 
honourable than the proceedings upon this procuration; 
for in less than seven months I received a large packet 
from the survivors of my trustees the merchants, for whose 
account I went to sea. I found myself master, all on a 
sudden, of above ;^5,ooo sterling in money, and had an 
estate, as I might well call it, in the Brazils of above a 
thousand pounds a year, as sure as an estate of lands in 
England : and in a word, I was in a condition which I 
scarce knew how to understand, or how to compose myself 
for the enjoyment of it. 

The first thing I did was to recompense my original bene- 
factor, my good old captain, who had been first charitable 
to me in my distress, kind to me in my beginning, and 
honest to me at the end. 

I was now to consider which way to steer my course next, 
and what to do with the estate that Providence had thus 
put into my hands ; and indeed I had more care upon my 
head now than I had in my silent state of life in the island, 
where I wanted nothing but what I had, and had nothing 
but what I wanted : whereas I had now a great charge upon 
me, and my business was how to secure it. I had never a 
cave now to hide my money in, or a place where it might 
lie without lock or key till it grew mouldy and tarnished 
before anybody would meddle with it. On the contrary, I 
knew not where to put it, or whom to trust with it. My 
old patron, the captain, indeed was honest, and that was 
the only refuge I had. 

In the next place, my interest in the Brazils seemed to 
summon me thither : but now I could not tell how to think 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 



209 



of going thither, till I had settled my affairs, and left my 
effects in some safe hands behind me. At first I thought of 
my old friend the widow, who I knew was honest, and would 
be just to me ; but then she was in years, and but poor, and 
for aught I knew might be in debt So that, in a word, I 
had no way but to go back to England myself, and take my 
effects with me. 

But I was so prepossessed against my going by sea at 
all, except from Calais to Dover, that I resolved to travel 
all the way by land ; which as I was not in haste, and did 
not value the charge, was by much the pleasanter way. 
And to make it more so, my old captain brought an English 
gentleman, the son of a merchant in Lisbon, who was willing 
to travel with me ; after which, we picked up two more 
English merchants also, and two young Portuguese gentle- 
men, the last going to Paris only ; so that we were in all 
six of us, and five servants : the two merchants and the two 
Portuguese contenting themselves with one servant between 
two, to save the charge ; and as for me, I got an English 
sailor to travel with me as a servant, besides my man Friday, 
who was too much a stranger to be capable of supplying 
the place of a servant on the road 

In this manner I set out from Lisbon ; and our company 
toeing all very well mounted and armed, we made a little 
troop, whereof they did me the honour to call me captain, 
as well because I was the oldest man as because I had two 
servants, and, indeed, was the original of the whole journey. 

As I have troubled you with none of my sea-journals, so 
I shall trouble you now with none of my land-journal : but 
some adventures that happened to us in this tedious and 
-difficult journey I must not omit.

SIC JLD¥SKTURSS OF 

XXKIIL—CI^OSSII^G THE PYRENEES. 

I. Perils Cram Saow. — ^When we came to Madrid, we 
bes2ig all of us strangers to Spain, w^e willing to stay some 
time CO see the Comt of Spain, and to see what was worth 
obsenrii^ ; but it being the latter part of the summer, we 
hastened away, and set out from Madrid about the middle 
of OctobCT. ' But when we came to the edge of Navarre, 
we woe alarmed at several towns on the way, with an 
account, that so much snow was fidlen on the French side 
of the mountains, that several travellers were obliged to 
come ba<± to Pampduna, after having attempted, at an 
extreme hazard, to pass on. 

Wlien we came to Pampduna itself we found it so indeed ; 
and to me that had been always used to a hot climate, and, 
indeed, to countries where we could scarce bear any clothes 
on, the cold was insufferable. Nor, indeed, was it more 
painful dian it was surprising, to come but ten days before 
out of the Old Castile, where the weather was not only 
warm but very hot, and immediately to feel a wind from 
the Pyrenean mountains so very keen, so severely cold, as 
to be intolerable, and to endanger benumbing and perishing 
of our fingers and toes. Poor Friday was really frighted 
when he saw the mountains all covered with snow, and felt 
cold weather, which he had never seen or felt before in 
his life. 

To mend the matter, when we came to Pampeluna, it 
continued snowing with so much violence, and so long, that 
the people said winter was come before its time ; and the 
roads which were difficult before, were now quite im- 
passable : for, in a word, the snow lay in some places too 
thick for us to travel ; and being not hard frozen, as is the 
case in northern countries, there was no going without 
being in danger of being buried alive every step. We 
stayed no less than twenty days at Pampeluna; when 
seeing the winter coming on, and no likelihood of its being 
better, for it was the severest winter all over Europe that 
had been known in the memory of man, I proposed that 
we should all go away to Fontarabia, and there take 
shippmg for Bordeaux, which was a very little voyage. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 211 

But while we were considering this, there came in four 
French gentlemen, who having been stopped on the French 
side of the passes^ as we were on the Spanish, had found 
out a guide, who traversing the country near the head of 
Languedoc, had brought them over the mountains by such 
ways, that they were not much incommoded with the 
snow; and where they met with snow in any quantity, 
they said it was frozen hard enough to bear them and their 
horses. 

We sent for this guide, who told us, he would undertake 
to carry us the same way with no hazard from the snow, 
provided we were armed sufficiently to protect ourselves 
from wild beasts ; for he said, upon these great snows, it 
was frequent for some wolves to show themselves at the 
foot of the mountains, being made ravenous for want of 
food, the ground being covered with snow. We told him, 
we were well enough prepared for such creatures as they 
were, if he would ensure us from a kind of two-legged 
wolves,* which we were told, we were in most danger from, 
especially on the French side of the mountains. He 
satisfied us there was no danger of that kind in the way 
that we were to go : so we readily agreed to follow him, as 
did also twelve other gentlemen, with their servants, some 
French, some Spanish ; who, as I said, had attempted to 
go, and were obliged to come back again. 

Accordingly, we all set out from Pampeluna, with our 
guide, on the fifteenth of November ; and, indeed, I was 
surprised, when instead of going forward, he came directly 
back with us, on the same road that we came from Madrid, 
above twenty miles; when being passed two rivers, and 
come into the plain country, we found ourselves in a warm 
climate again, where the country was pleasant, and no snow 
to be seen. But on a sudden, turning to his left, he 
approached the mountains another way ; and though it is 
true, the hills and precipices looked dreadful, yet he made 
so many tours,* such meanders, and led us by such winding 
ways, that we were insensibly passed the height of the 
mountains, without being much encumbered with the snow. 
And all on a sudden, he showed us. the pleasant fruitful 
provinces of Languedoc and Gascony, all green and flourish- 



212 ADVESmjRSS OF 

ing ; thoagh, indeed, it was a great distance, and we had 
some rough way to pass yet. 

We were a little uneasy, however, when we found it 
snowed one whole day and a night so £Eist that we could 
not travel ; but he bid us be easy, we should soon be past 
it all. We found, indeed, that we b^an to descend every 
day, and to come more north than before ; and so depend- 
ing upon our guide, we went on. 

2. A Timely Rescue. — It was about two hours before 
night, when our guide being something before us, and not 
just in sight, out rushed three monstrous wolves, and after 
them a bear, out of a hollow way, adjoining to a thick 
wood. Two of the wolves flew upon the guide, and had 
he been half a mile before us, he had been devoured indeed 
before we could have helped him. One of them festened 
upon his horse, and the other attacked the man with that 
violence, that he had not time, or not presence of mind 
enough to draw his pistol, but hallooed and cried out to us 
most lustily. My man Friday being next me, I bade him 
ride up and see what was the matter. As soon as Friday 
came in sight of the man, he hallooed as loud as the other, 
" O master ! O master ! " but like a bold fellow, rode directly 
up to the poor man, and with his pistol shot the wolf that 
attacked hun into the head. 

It was happy for the poor man that it was my man 
Friday ; for he having been used to that kind of creature 
in his country, had no fear upon him, but went close up to 
him, and shot him as above ; whereas any of us would 
have fired at a farther distance, and have perhaps either 
missed the wolf or endangered shooting the man. 

But it was enough to have terrified a bolder man than I, 
and indeed it alarmed all our company, when with the 
noise of Friday's pistol, we heard on both sides the dis- 
malest howling of wolves, and the noise redoubled by the 
echo of the mountains, that it was to us as if there had 
been a prodigious multitude of them ; and perhaps, indeed, 
there were not such a few as that we had no cause of 
apprehensions. 

However, as Friday had killed this wolf, the other that 
had Hastened upon the horse, left him immediately, and 



ROBINSON CRUSOE, 213 

fled; having happily fastened upon his head, where the 
bosses^ of the bridle had stuck in his teeth, so that he had 
not done him much hurt. The man, indeed, was most hurt ; 
for the raging creature had bit him twice, once on the arm, 
and the other time a little above his knee ; and he was 
just as it were tumbling down bjr the disorder of his horse, 
when Friday came up and shot the wolf. 

It is easy to suppose that at the noise of Friday's pistol 
we all mended our pace, and rode up as fast as the way 
(which was very difficult) would give us leave, to see what 
was the matter. As soon as we came clear of the trees, 
which blinded us before, we saw clearly what had been the 
case, and how Friday had disengaged the poor guide, 
though we did not presently discern what kind of creature 
it was he had killed. 

3. Friday and the Bear. — But never was a fight 
managed so hardily, and in such a surprising manner, as 
that which followed between Friday and the bear, which 
gave us all (though at first we were surprised and afraid for 
him) the greatest diversion imaginable. As the bear is a 
heavy, clumsy creature, and does not gallop as the wolf 
does, who is swift and light; so he has two particular 
qualities, which generally are the rule of his actions. First, 
as t6 men, who are not his proper prey; I say, not his 
proper prey, because though I cannot say what excessive 
hunger might do, which was now their case, the ground 
being all covered with snow ; but as to men, he does not 
usually attempt them, unless they first attack him. On the 
contrary, if you meet him in the woods, if you don't meddle 
with him, he won't meddle with you. But then you must 
take care to be very civil to him and give him the road, for 
he is a very nice gentleman, he won't go a step out of his 
way for a prince. Nay, if you are really afraid, your best way 
is to look another way, and keep going on ; for sometimes if 
you stop and stand still, and look steadily at him, he takes 
it for an affront. But if you throw or toss anything at him, 
and it hits him, though it were but a bit of stick as big as 
your finger, he takes it for an affront, and sets all his other 
business aside to pursue his revenge; for he will have 
satisfaction in point of honour, That is bis first quality.

Mt man Fiidaj had ddiveied oar gmde, and when

for die man was both hmt and fritted, and indeed 
the last more than die first — when on the sadden, we spied 
the bear come oat of die wood, and a vast monstrous one 
it was. die biggest b^ fu diat ever I saw. We were 
an a little suiptis e d when we saw him ; bat when Friday 
saw him, it was easy to see joy and coarage in the fdlow's 
coantenance. •'O ! O ! O !" says Friday, three times, point- 
ing to him : *' O master ! yoa give me te leave ! me shakee 
te hand with him : me msJce yoa good laugh." 

I was sarpnsed to see the feUow so pleased. ^^ You fool 
you," says I, "he win eat you up!" "Eatee me up! 
eatee me up!" says Friday twice over again; *'me eatee 
him up: me make you good laugh: you aU stay here, 
me show you good laugh ;" so down he sits and gets his 
boots off in a moment, and put on a pair of pumps (as we 
call the flat shoes they wear) and which he had in his 
pocket, gives my other servant his horse, and with his gun, 
away he flew swift like the wind. 

The bear was walking softly on and offered to me\ldle 
with nobody, till Friday coming pretty near calls to him, as 
if the bear could understand him. *« Hark ye, hark ye," 
says Friday, "me speakee wit you." We followed at 
a distance ; for now being come down on the Gascony side 
of the mountains, we were entered a vast great forest, where 
the country was plain and pretty open, though many trees 
in it scattered here and there. 

Friday, who had, as we say, the heels of the bear, came 
up with him quickly, and takes up a great stone and throws 
at him and hit him just on the head, but did him no more 
harm than if he had thrown it against a wall; but it 
answered Friday's end, for the rogue was so void of 
fear that he did it purely to make the bear follow him, and 
show us some laugh, as he called it. 

As soon as the bear felt the stone and saw him, he turns 
about and comes after him, taking terribly long strides and 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 215 

shuffling along at a strange rate, so as would have put a horse 
to a middling gallop. Away runs Friday, and takes his 
course as if he ran towards us for help. So we all resolved 
to fire at once upon the bear, and deliver my man, though 
I was angry at him heartily for bringing the bear back upon 
us, when he was going about his own business another 
way. And especially I was angry that he had turned the 
bear back upon us and then run away, and I called out, 
" You dog," said I, "is this your making us laugh ? Come 
away, and take your horse, that we may shoot the creature.'* 
He hears me, and cries out, '^ No shoot, no shoot, stand 
still, you get much laugh." And as the nimble creature ran 
two feet for the beast's one, he turned on a sudden on one 
side of us, and seeing a great oak-tree fit for his purpose, 
he beckoned to us to follow, and doubling his pace, he gets 
nimbly up the tree, laying his gun down upon the ground 
at about five or six yards from the bottom of the tree. 

The bear soon came to the tree, and we followed at a 
distance. The first thing he did, he stopped at the gun, 
smelt to it, but let it lie, and up he scrambles into the tree, 
climbing like a cat, though so monstrously heavy. I was 
amazed at the folly, as I thought it, of my man, and could 
not for my life see anything to laugh at yet, till seeing the 
bear get up the tree, we all rode nearer to him. 

When we came to the tree, there was Friday got out to 
the small end of a large limb of the tree, and the bear got 
about half way to him. As soon as the bear got out to 
that part where the limb of the tree was weaker, " Ha," says 
he to us, " now you see me teachee the bear dance." So 
he falls a-jumping and shaking the bough, at which the 
bear began to totter, but stood still and began to look 
behind him to see how he should get back ; then, indeed, 
we did laugh heartily. But Friday had not done with him 
by a great deal. When he sees him stand still, he calls out 
to him again, as if he had supposed the bear could speak 
English : ** What, you no come farther, pray you come 
farther." So he left jumping and shaking the tree ; and 
the bear, just as if he had understood what he said, did 
come a little farther ; then he fell a-jumping again, and the 
bear stopped again. 



2i6 AUfUiiiruB or 

We thoi^t nov vxs a good tune to knock him on the 
head, and I called to Fiiday to stand still and we would 
shoot the bear ; hot he ciied oat earnestly, *' O pray ! O 
pray! No shoot, me shoot, by and then "--he would have 
said ** by-and-by.* However, to shorten the story, Friday 
danced so moch, and the bear stood so ticklish, that we 
had lau^iing enough indeed, bat still could not imagine 
what the fdlow would do : for fiist we thought he depended 
upon shaking the bear off; and we found die bear was too 
cunning for ^t too, for he would not go out iaa enough to 
be thrown down, but clings fatst with his great broad claws 
and feet, so that we could not imagine what would be the 
end (^ it and where the jest would be at last 

But Friday put us out of doubt quickly, for seeing the 
bear ding fast to the bough, and that he would not be per- 
suaded to come any &rther, *'Well, weU," says Friday^ 
** you no come £uther, me go, me go ; you no come to me^ 
me go come to you." And upon this he goes out to the 
smallest end of the bough, where it would bend with his 
weight, and gently lets himself down by it, sliding down the 
bough till he came near enough to jump down on his feet, 
and away he ran to his gun, takes it up, and stands stilL 

" Well," said I to him, " Friday, what will you do now ? 
WTiy don't you shoot him?" ** No shoot," says Friday, 
*^ no yet, me shoot now, me no kill ; me stay, give you one 
more laugh." And, indeed, so he did, as you will see pre- 
sently ; for when the bear sees his enemy gone, he comes 
back from the bough where he stood, but did it mighty 
leisurely, looking behind him every step, and coming back- 
ward till he got into the body of the tree. Then with the 
same hinder end foremost, he came down the tree, grasping 
it with his claws and moving one foot at a time, very lei- 
surely. At this juncture, and just before he could set his 
hind feet upon the ground, Friday stepped up close to him, 
clapped the muzzle of his piece into his ear, and shot him 
dead as a stone. 

Then the rogue turned about to see if we did not laugh, 
and when he saw we were pleased by our looks, he falls 
a-laughing himself very loud. "So we kill bear in my 
country," says Friday. " So you kill them?" says I. "Why, 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 217 

you hav€ no guns/' " No,'* says he, " no gun, but shoot, 
great much long arrow." 

This was, indeed, a good diversion to us ; but we were 
still in a wild place, and our guide very much hurt, and 
what to do we hardly knew. The howling of wolves ran 
much in my head, and, indeed, except the noise I once 
heard on the shore of Africa, I never heard anything that 
filled me with so much horror. 

These things and the approach of night called us off, or 
else, as Friday would have had us, we should certainly have 
taken the skin of this monstrous creature off, which was 
worth saving ; but we had three leagues to go, and our 
guide hastened us, so we left him and went forward on our 
journey. 

4. Attacked by Wolves. — The ground was still 
covered with snow, though not so deep and dangerous as 
on the mountains, and the ravenous creatures, as we heard 
afterwards, were come down into the forest and plain 
country, pressed by hunger, to seek for food, and had done 
a great deal of mischief in the villages, where they surprised 
the country people, killed a great many of their sheep and 
horses, and some people too. 

We had one dangerous place to pass, which our guide 
told us, if there were any more wolves in the country, we 
should find them there; and this was in a small plain, 
surrounded with woods on every side, and a long narrow 
defile or lane, which we were to pass to get through the 
wood, and then we should come to the village where we 
were to lodge. 

It was within half an hour of sunset when we entered 
the first wood ; and a little after sunset when we came into 
the plain. We met with nothing in the first wood, except 
that in a little plain within the wood, which was not above 
two furlongs over, we saw five great wolves cross the road, 
full speed one after another, as if they had been in chase 
of some prey and had it in view. They took no notice of 
us, and were gone and out of sight in a few moments. 

Upon this our guide, who, by the way, was a wretched 
faint-hearted fellow, bid us keep in a ready posture, for he 
believed there were more wolves a-coming. 



2l8 ADVENTURES OF 

We kept our arms ready and our eyes about us, but we 
saw no more wolves till we came through that wood, which 
was near half a league, and entered the plain. As soon as 
we came into the plain we had occasion enough to look 
about us. The first object we met with was a dead horse — 
that is to say, a poor horse which the wolves had killed — 
and at least a dozen of them at work, we could not say 
eating of him, but picking of his bones rather, for they had 
eaten up all the flesh before. 

We did not think fit to disturb them at their feast, neither 
did they take much notice of us. Friday would have let 
fly at them, but I would not suffer him by any means, for I 
found we were like to have more business upon our hands 
than we were aware of. We were not gone half over the 
plain, but we began to hear the wolves howl in the wood on 
our left in a frightful manner ; and presently after we saw 
about a hundred coming on directly towards us all in a 
body, and most of them in a line, as regularly as an army 
drawn up by experienced officers. I scarce knew in what 
manner to receive them, but found to draw ourselves in a 
close line was the only way, so we formed in a moment. 
But that we might not have too much interval, I ordered 
that only every other man should fire, and that the others who 
had not fired should stand ready to give them a second 
volley immediately if they continued to advance upon us, 
and that then those who had fired at first should not pretend 
to load their fusees* again, but stand ready with every one 
a pistol ; for we were all armed with a fusee and a pair of 
pistols each man ; so we were by this method able to fire 
six volleys, half of us at a time. However, at present we 
had no necessity, for upon firing the first volley the enemy 
made a full stop, being terrified as well with the noise as 
with the fire; four of them being shot into the head 
dropped, several others were wounded, and went bleeding

istaken, for upon our shout they began to retire and turn 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 219 

about Then I ordered a second volley to be fired in their 
rear, which put them to the gallop, and away they went to 
the woods. 

This gave us leisure to charge our pieces again, and, that 
we might lose no time, we kept going ; but we had but 
little more than loaded our fusees and put ourselves into 
readiness when we heard a terrible noise in the same wood 
on our left, only that it was farther onward the same way 
we were to go. 

The night was coming on and the light began to be 
dusky, which made it worse on our side; but the noise 
increasing, we could easily perceive that it was the howling 
and yelling of those hellish creatures ; and on a sudden we 
perceived two or three troops of wolves, one on our left, 
one behind us, and one on our front, so that we seemed to 
be surrounded with them. However, as they did not fall 
upon us, we kept our way forward as fast as we could make 
our horses go, which the way being very rough was only a 
good large trot ; and in this manner we came in view of the 
entrance of a wood through which we were to pass, at the 
farther side of the plain ; but we were greatly surprised when 
coming nearer the lane, or pass, we saw a confused number 
of wolves standing just at the entrance. 

On a sudden, at another opening of the wood, we heard 
the noise of a gun, and looking that way, out rushed a horse 
with a saddle and a bridle on him, flying like the wind, and 
sixteen or seventeen wolves after him, full speed ; indeed, 
the horse had the heels of them, but as we supposed that 
he could not hold it at that rate, we doubted not but they 
would get up with him at last, and no question but they 
did. 

But here we had a most horrible sight, for riding up to 
the entrance where the horse came out, we found the 
carcass of another horse, and of two men, devoured by the 
ravenous creatures ; and one of the men was no doubt the 
same who we heard fire the gun, for there lay a gun just by 
him fired off; but as to the man, his head and the upper 
part of his body was eaten up. 

This filled us with horror, and we knew not what course 
to take, but the creatures resolved us soon ; for they gathered 



AMfTESTUmES OF 

abocx cs prescndtf , in hopes of prey ; and I verily believe 
there v^re three facmdred of them. It happened very 
moch to OGT adrantage^ ^^'^ ^ ^^ entxance into the wood, 
bat at a licde vay fipom k, there hiy some large timber 
trees vhidi had been cut dovn the sonmier before, and I 
Bippose lay there for cairijge. I diev my little troop in 
amoQg those trees» and plaring oorsdves in a line, behind 
ooe kng tree, I advked them all to li^t,^ and keeping that 
tree before n& for a breast-wtxk, to stand in a triangle, or 
three fronts, endosii^ oar horses in the centre. 

We did so, and it was wdl we did ; for never was a more 
fonoos charge than the creatores made upon us in the 
l^ce ; they came on us with a growling kmd of a noise 
(and mounted the piece of timb^, which as I said was our 
breast-wmk) as if diey were only rushing upon their prey ; 
and this fury of dieirs, it seons, was principally occasioned 
by their seeing our h<»ses bdiind us, which was the prey 
they aimed at I ordered our men to fire as before, eveiy 
other man ; and they took their aim so sure, that indeed 
they killed several of the wolves at the first volley; but 
there was a necessity to keep a continual firing, for they 
came on like devils, diose behind pushing on those before. 

WTien we had fired the second volley of our fusees, we 
thought they stopped a little, and I hoped they would have 
gone off; but it was but for a moment, for others came for- 
ward again: so we fired two volleys of our pistols, and I 
believe in these four firings we had killed seventeen or 
eighteen of them, and lamed twice as many ; yet they came 
on again. 

I was loath to spend our last shot too hastily ;• so I called 
my servant, not my man Friday, for he was better employed ; 
for with the greatest dexterity imaginable, he had charged 
my fusee and his own while we were engaged ; but as I 
said, I called my other man, and giving him a horn of 
powder, I bade him lay a train all along the piece of 
timber, and let it be a large train. He did so, and had but 
just time to get away, when the wolves came up to it, and 
some were got up upon it ; when I, snapping an uncharged 
pistol close to the powder, set it on fire : those that were 
upon the timber were scorched with it, and six or seven of 



kOBINSON CRX^SOE*

them fell, or rather jumped in among us, with the force and 
fright of the fire ; we dispatched these in an instant, and the 
rest were so frightened with the light, which the night, for it 
was now very near dark, made more terrible, that they drew 
back a little. 

Upon which I ordered our last pistol to be fired off in 
one volley, and after that we gave a shout ; upon this, the 
wolves turned tail, and we sallied immediately upon near 
twenty lame ones, who we found struggling on the ground, 
and fell a-cutting them with our swords, which answered 
our expectation; for the crying and howling they made 
was better understood by their fellows, so that they all fled 
and left us. 

We had, first and last, killed about threescore of them ; 
and had it been daylight, we had killed many more. The 
field of battle being thus cleared, we made forward again ; 
for we had still near a league to go. We heard the ravenous 
creatures howl and yell in the woods as we went several 
times, and sometimes we fancied we saw some of them; 
but the snow dazzling our eyes, we were not certain. So in 
about an hour more we came to the town where we were to 
lodge, which we found in a terrible fright, and all in arms ; 
for it seems, that the night before, the wolves and some 
bears had broken into the village in the night, and put 
them in a terrible fright, and they were obliged to keep 
guard night and day, but especially in the night, to preserve 
their cattle, and indeed their people.

XKXIY.— CONCLUDING CHAPTER. 

I. On Various Matters. — The next morning our 
guide was so ill, and his limbs swelled with the rankling of 
his two wounds, that he could go no farther ; so we were 
obliged to take a new guide there, and go to Toulouse, where 
we found a warm climate, a fruitful pleasant country, and 



aaa adventures of 

no snow, no wolves, or anything like them. But when we 
told our story at Toulouse, they told us it was nothing but 
what was ordinary in the great forest at the foot of the 
mountains, especially when the snow lay on the ground. 
But they inquired much what kind of a guide we had gotten 
that would venture to bring us that way in such a severe 
season, and told us it was very much we were not all de- 
voured. When we told them how we placed ourselves, and 
the horses in the middle, they blamed us exceedingly, and 
told us it was fifty to one but we had been all destroyed; 
for it was the sight of the horses which made the wolves so 
furious, seeing their prey, and that at other times they are 
really afraid of a gun, but they being excessive hungry and 
raging on that account, the eagerness to come at the horses 
had made them senseless of danger ; and that if we had not by 
the continued fire, and at last by the stratagem of the train 
of powder mastered them, it had been great odds but that we 
had been torn to pieces ; whereas had we been content to 
have sat still on horseback and fired as horsemen, they would 
not have taken the horses for so much their own when men 
were on their backs as otherwise ; and withal they told us 
that at last if we had stood altogether and left our horses, 
they would have been so eager to have devoured them that 
we might have come off safe, especially having our firearms 
in our hands, and being so many in number. 

For my part I was never so sensible of danger in my life, 
for seeing above three hundred devils come roaring and 
open-mouthed to devour us, and having nothing to shelter 
us or retreat to, I gave myself over for lost ; and as it was, I 
believe I shall never care to cross those mountains again. 
I think I would much rather go a thousand leagues by sea, 
though I were sure to meet with a storm once a week. 

I have nothing uncommon to take notice of in my pas- 
sage through France, nothing but what other travellers have 
given an account of with much more advantage than I can. 
I travelled firom Toulouse to Paris, and without any con- 
siderable stay came to Calais, and landed safe at Dover the 
fourteenth of January, after having had a severely cold 
season to travel in. 

During the next seven years I in part settled myself in 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 22$ 

England ; for first of all I married, and that not either to 
my disadvantage or dissatisfaction, and had three children, 
two sons and one daughter. But my wife dying, and my 
nephew coming home with good success from a voyage to 
Spain, my inclination to go abroad and his importunity 
prevailed, and engaged me to go in his ship as a private 
trader to the East Indies. This was in the year 1694. 

2. Crusoe Visits his Island. — In this voyage I visited 
my new colony in the island, saw my successors the Spani- 
ards, had the whole story of their lives and of the villains I 
left there ; how at first they insulted the poor Spaniards ; how 
they afterwards agreed, disagreed, united, separated; and 
how at last the Spaniards were obliged to use violence with 
them ; how they were subjected to the Spaniards ; how 
honestly the Spaniards used them : a history, if it were 
entered into, as full of variety and wonderful accidents as 
my own part, particularly also as to their battles with the 
Caribbeans, who landed several times upon the island; 
and as to the improvements they made upon the island 
itself; and how five of them made an attempt upon the 
mainland and brought away eleven men and five women 
prisoners, by which, at my coming, I found about twenty 
young children on the island. 

Here I stayed about twenty days, left them supplies of 
all necessary things, and particularly of arms, powder, shot, 
clothes, tools, and two workmen, which I brought from 
England with me, viz., a carpenter and a smith. 

Besides this, I shared the island into parts with them, 
and reserved to myself the property of the whole, but gave 
them such parts respectively as they agreed on ; and having 
settled all things with them, and engaged them not to leave 
the place, I left them there. 

From thence I touched at the Brazils, from whence I 
sent a bark, which I bought there, with more people to the 
island, and in it, besides other supplies, I sent seven women, 
being such as I found proper for service, or for wives to 
such as would take them. As to the Englishmen, I 
promised them to send them some women from England, 
with a good cargo of necessaries, if they would apply them- 
selves to planting, which I afterwards performed. And the 



224 ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSO£» 

fellows proved very honest and diligent after they were 
mastered, and had their properties set apart for them. I 
sent them also from the Brazils five cows, three of them 
being big with calf, some sheep, and some hogs, which, 
when I came again, were considerably increased. 

But all these things, with an account how three hundred 
Caribbees came and invaded them, and ruined their planta- 
tions, and how they fought with that whole number twice, 
and were at first defeated, and three of them killed ; but at 
last a storm destroying their enemy's canoes, they famished 
or destroyed almost all the rest, and renewed and recovered 
the possession of their plantation, and still lived upon 
the island. 

All these things, with some very surprising incidents in 
some new adventures of my own, for ten years more, I may 
perhaps give a further account of hereafter. 



THE END.
