Frontispiece to Vol. I. — Robinson Crusoe tak- 
ing leave of his Father and Mother. 

" My father was a wise and grave man ; gave me seri- 
ous and excellent counsel against what he foresaw was 
my design. He called me one morning into his chamber, 
where he was confined by the gout, and expostulated 
very warmly with me upon this subject." See page 2.

I, in about two hours time, made a very handsome tent, 
covered with old sails, and above that, with boughs of 
trees." See page 317.

to you : and then turning to them, and pointing to me, 
he let them know who I was : upon which they all came 
up one by one, not as if they had been sailors, and ordi-

ambassadors or noblemen, and I a monarch or a great 
conqueror." See page 44. 

SUBJECT OF PLATE XII.

About their hut, that when you came to the place, nothing 
was to be seen but a wood ; and though they had their

place; yet they had restored all again, and every thing

they brought with the women, who, it seems, proved very 
faithful to them, to lead them with their two wives, and 
whatever they could carry away with them, to their re- 
tired place in the woods." See page 99. 

SUBJECT OF PLATE XIV. 

The Spaniards and Englishmen burning the In- 
dians' boats. 

• r They went to work immediately with the boats ; and 
getting some dry wood together from a dead tree, they 
tried to set some of them on fire, but they were so wet,

a pick- axe, a crow, a broad-axe, and a saw." See 
page 138. 

SUBJECT OF PLATE XVI. 

A View of the Plantation of the three English- 
men. 

" Upon this he faced about just before me, as he walked 
along, and putting me to a full stop, made me a very

VOL. I, 



PREFACE. 



If ever the story of any private man's adven- 
tures in the world were worth making pub- 
lic, and were acceptable when published, the 
Editor of this account thinks this will be so. 

The wonders of this man's life exceed all 
that (he thinks) is to be found extant; the 
life of one man being scarce capable of a 
greater variety. 

The story is told with modesty, with se- 
riousness, and with a religious application of 
events to the uses to which wise mep always 
apply them ; viz. to the instruction of others, 
by this example, and to justify and honour 
the wisdom of Providence in all the variety 
of circumstances, let them happen how they 
will. 



Xll PREFACE. 

The Editor believes the thing to be a just 
history of facts; neither is there any appear- 
ance of fiction in it; and however thinks, be^ 
cause all such things are disputed, that the 
improvement of it, as well to the diversion a 
as to the instruction of the Reader, will be 
the same; and as such, he thinks, without 
further compliment to the world, he does 
them a great service in the publication. 



THE 



LIFE AND ADVENTURES 



OF 



ROBINSON CRUSOE, 



8$c. <$r. 



I was born in the year 1632, in the city of York, 
of a good family, though not of that country, my 
father being a foreigner of Bremen, who settled 
first at Hull: he got a good estate by merchandize, 
and leaving off his trade, lived afterward at York; 
from whence he had married my mother, whose 
relations were named Robinson, a very good family 
in that country, and from whom I was called 
Robinson Kreutznaer; but by the usual corruption 
of words in England, we are now called, nay we 
call ourselves, and write our name Crusoe, and so 
my companions always called me. 

I had two elder brothers, one of which was lieu- 
tenant colonel to an English regiment of foot in 
Flanders, formerly commanded by the famous colo- 

VOL. I. B 



2 XIFE AND ADVENTURES 

xiel Lockhart, and was killed at the battle near Dun- 
kirk against the Spaniards; what became of my 
second brother I never knew, any more than my 
father or mother did know what was become of me. 

Being the third son of the family, and not bred 
to any trade, my head began to be filled very early 
with rambling thoughts: my father, who was very 
ancient, had given me a competent share of learning, 
as far as house education, and a country free-school 
generally goes, and designed me for the law; but I 
would be satisfied with nothing but going to sea; 
and my inclination to this led me so strongly against 
the will, nay the commands of my father, and 
against all the entreaties and persuasions of my 
mother and other friends, that there seemed to be 
something fatal in that propension of nature tending 
directly to the life of misery which w T as to befal me. 

My father, a wise and grave man, gave me serious 
and excellent counsel against what he foresaw was 
my design. He called me one morning into his 
chamber, where he was confined by the gout, and 
expostulated very warmly with me upon this sub- 
ject: he asked me what reasons more than a mere 
wandering inclination I had for leaving my father's 
house and my native country, where I might be 
well introduced, and had a prospect of raising my 
fortune by application and industry, with a life of 
ease and pleasure. He told me it was for men of 
desperate fortunes on one hand, or of aspiring su- 
perior fortunes on the other, who went abroad upon 
adventures, to rise by enterprize, and make them- 
selves famous in undertakings of a nature out of 
the common road; that these things were all eitker 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. $ 

too far above me, or too far below me; that mine 
was the middle state, or what might be called the 
upper station of low life, which he had found by 
long experience was the best state in the world, the 
most suited to human happiness, not exposed to the 
miseries and hardships, the labour and sufferings 
of the mechanic part of mankind, and not embar- 
rassed with the pride, luxury, ambition, and envy 
of the upper part of mankind. He told me, I might 
judge of the happiness of this state, by this one 
thing, viz. That this was the state of life which all 
other people envied; that Kings have frequently 
lamented the miserable consequences of being Jborn 
to great things, and wish they had been placed in 
the middle of the two extremes, between the mean 
and the great; that the wise man gave his testi- 
mony to this as the just standard of true felicity 
when he prayed to have neither poverty or riches. 
He bid me observe it, and I should always find, 
that the calamities of life were shared among the 
upper and lower part of mankind ; but that the mid- 
dle station had the fewest disasters, and was not 
exposed to so many vicissitudes as the higher or 
lower part of mankind; nay, they were not sub- 
jected to so many distempers and uneasinesses 
either of body or mind, as those were, who by 
vicious living, luxury, and extravagancies on one 
hand, or by hard labour, want of necessaries, and 
mean or insufficient diet on the other hand, bring 
distempers upon themselves by the natural conse- 
quences of their way of living; that the middle 
station of life was calculated for all kind of virtues 
and all kind of enjoyments; that peace and plenty 

b 2 



4 LfFE AND ADVENTURES OF 

were the handmaids of a middle fortune; that 
temperance, moderation, quietness, health, society, 
all agreeable diversions, and all desirable pleasures, 
were the blessings attending the middle station of 
life; that this way men went silently and smoothly 
through the world, and comfortably out of it, not 
embarrassed with the labours of the hands or of 
the head, not sold to the life of slavery for daily 
bread, or harassed with perplexed circumstances, 
which rob the soul of peace, and the body of rest; 
not enraged with the passion of envy, or secret 
burning lust of ambition for great things; but in 
easy circumstances sliding gently through the 
world, and sensibly tasting the sweets of living, 
without the bitter, feeling that they are happy, and 
learning by every day's experience to know it 
more sensibly. 

After this, he pressed me earnestly, and in the 
most affectionate manner, not to play the young 
man, not to precipitate myself into miseries which 
nature and the station of life I was born in seemed 
to have provided against; that I was under no ne- 
cessity of seeking my bread; that he would do 
well for me, and endeavour to enter me fairly into 
the station of life which he had been just recom- 
mending to me; and that if I was not very easy 
and happy in the world, it must be my mere fate 
or fault that must hinder it, and that he should 
have nothing to answer for, having thus discharged 
his duty in warning me against measures which 
he knew would be to my hurt: in a word, that as 
he would do very kind things for me if I would 
stay and settle at home as he directed, so he would 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 5 

not have so much hand in my misfortunes, as to 
give me any encouragement to go away: and to 
close all, he told me I had my elder brother for an 
example, to whom he had used the same earnest 
persuasions to keep him from going into the low 
country wars, but could not prevail, his joung de- 
sires prompting him to run into the army, where 
he was killed; and though he said he would not 
cease to pray for me, yet he would venture to say 
to me, that if I did take this foolish step, God 
would not bless me, and I would have leisure here- 
after to reflect upon having neglected his counsel 
when there might be none to assist in my re- 
covery. 

I observed in this last part of his discourse, 
which was truly prophetic, though I suppose my 
father did not know it to be so himself; I say, I 
observed the tears run down his face very plenti- 
fully, and especially when he spoke of my brother 
who was killed; and that when he spoke of my 
having leisure to repent, ard none to assist me, he 
was so moved, that he broke off the discourse, and 
told me, his heart was so full, he could say no 
more to me. 

I was sincerely affected with this discourse, as 
indeed who could be otherwise? and I resolved 
not to think of going abroad any more, but to settle 
at home according to my father's desire. But alas! 
a few days wore it all off; and, in short, to prevent 
any of my father's farther importunities, in a few 
weeks after I resolved to run quite away from him. 
However, I did not act so hastily neither as my 
first heat of resolution prompted, but I took my 



6 LIFE AXD ADVENTURES 

mother, at a time when I thought her a little plea- 
santer than ordinary, and told her, that my thoughts 
were so entirely bent upon seeing the world, that 
I should never settle to any thing with resolution 
enough to go through with it, and my father had 
better give me his consent than force me to go 
without it; that I was now eighteen years old, 
which was too late to go apprentice to a trade, or 
clerk to an attorney; that I was sure, if I did, I 
should never serve out my time, and I should cer- 
tainly run away from my master before my time 
was out, and go to sea; and if she would speak to 
my father to let me go one voyage abroad, if I 
came home again and did not like it, I would go 
no more, and I would promise by a double dili- 
gence to recover that time I had lost. 

This put my mother into a great passion: she 
told me, she knew it would be to no purpose to 
speak to my father upon any such subject ; that he 
knew too well what was my interest to give his 
consent to any such thing so much for my hurt, 
and that she wondered how I could think of any 
such thins; after such a discourse as I had had with 
my father, and such kind and tender expressions 
as she knew my father had used to me; and that, 
in short, if I would ruin myself, there was no help 
for me; but I might depend I should never have 
their consent to it: that for her part she would 
not have so much hand in my destruction; and I 
should never have it to say, that my mother was 
willing when my father was not. 

Though my mother refused to move it to my 
father, yet, as I have heard afterwards, she reported 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 7 

all the discourse to him, and that my father, after 
shewing a great concern at it, said to her with a 
sigh, " That boy might be happy if he would stay 
at home, but if he goes abroad, he will be the most 
miserable wretch that was ever born; I can give 
no consent to it." 

It was not till almost a year after this that I 
broke loose, though in the mean time I continued 
obstinately deaf to all proposals of settling to busi- 
ness, and frequently expostulating with my father 
and mother about their being so positively deter- 
mined against what they knew my inclinations 
prompted me to. But being one day at Hull, where 
I went casually, and without any purpose of mak- 
ing an elopement that time; but I say, being there, 
and one of my companions being going by sea to 
London, in his father's ship, and prompting rne to 
go with them, with the common allurement of sea- 
faring men, viz. That it should cost me nothing 
for my passage, I consulted neither father or mo- 
ther any more, not so much as sent them word of 
it: but leaving them to hear of it as they might, 
without asking God's blessing, or my father's, 
without any consideration of circumstances or con- 
sequences, and in an ill hour, God knows, on the 
first of September 1651, I went on board a ship 
bound for London: never any young adventurer's 
misfortunes, I believe, began sooner, or continued 
longer than mine. The ship was no sooner gotten 
out of the Humber, but the wind began to blow, 
and the waves to rise in a most frightful manner; 
and as I had never been at sea before, I was most 



8 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

inexpressibly sick in body, and terrified in mind: 
I began now seriously to reflect upon what I had 
done, and how justly I was overtaken by the judg- 
ment of Heaven for my wicked leaving my father's 
house, and abandoning mv duty; all the o-ood 
counsel of my parents, my father's tears and my 
mother's entreaties came now fresh into my mind, 
and my conscience, which was not yet come to the 
pitch of hardness to which it has been since, re- 
proached me with the contempt of advice, and the 
breach of my duty to God and my father. 

All this while the storm increased, and the sea, 
which I had never been upon before, went very 
high, though nothing like what I have seen many 
times since; no, nor like what I saw a few days 
after: but it was enough to affect me then, who 
was but a young sailor, and had never known any 
thing of the matter. I expected every wave would 
have swallowed us up, and that every time the ship 
fell down, as I thought, in the trough or hollow 
of the sea, we should never rise more; and in this 
agony of mind I made many vows and resolutions, 
that if it would please God here to spare my life 
this one voyage, if ever I got once my foot upon 
dry land again I would go directly home to my 
father, and never set it into a ship again while I 
lived; that I would take his advice, and never 
run myself into such miseries as these any more. 
Now I saw plainly the goodness of his observa- 
tions about the middle station of life, how easy, 
how comfortably he had lived all his days, and 
never had been exposed to tempests at sea, or 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 9 

troubles on shore; and I resolved that I would, 
like a true repenting prodigal, go home to my 
father. 

These wise and sober thoughts continued all the 
while the storm continued, and indeed some time 
after; but the next day the wind was abated and 
the sea calmer, and I began to be a little inured to 
it: however I was very grave for all that day, being 
also a little sea-sick still; but towards night the 
weather cleared up, the wind was quite over, and 
a charming fine evening followed; the sun went 
down perfectly clear, and rose so the next morn- 
ing; and having little or no wind, and a smooth 
sea, the sun shining upon it, the sight was, as I 
thought, the most delightful that ever I saw. 

I had slept well in the night, and was now no 
more sea-sick, but very cheerful, looking with 
wonder upon the sea that was so rough and terrible 
the day before, and could be so calm and so plea- 
sant in so little time after. And now, least mv 
good resolutions should continue, my companion, 
who had indeed indeed me away, 1 comes to me, 
1 Well, Bob,* says he, (clapping me upon the 
shoulder,) ' how do you do after it? I warrant you 
were frighted, wa'n't you, last night, when it blew 
but a cap full of wind?' ' A cap full do you call it?' 
said I. ' It was a terrible storm. 5 ' A storm, you 
fool you,' replied he, • do 3^011 call that a storm? 
why it was nothing at all ; give us but a good ship 
and sea-room, and we think nothing of such a 
squall of wind as that; but you're but a fresh-water 
sailor, Bob : come, let us make a bowl of punch, 
and we'll forget all that: do you see what charm- 



JO iiVe and adventures 

ing weather it is now?' To make short this sad part 
of my story, we went the old way of all sailors; 
the punch was made, and I was made drunk with 
it, and in that one night's wickedness I drowned 
all my repentance, all my reflections upon my past 
conduct, and all my resolutions for my future. In 
a word, as the sea was returned to its smoothness 
of surface and settled calmness by the abatement 
of that storm, so the hurry of my thoughts being 
over, my fears and apprehensions of being swal- 
lowed up by the sea being forgotten, and the cur- 
rent of my former desires returned, I entirely for- 
got the vows and promises that I made in my dis- 
tress. I found indeed some intervals of reflection, 
and the serious thoughts did, as it were, endeavour 
to return again sometimes, but I shook them off, 
and roused mvself from them as it were from a 
distemper, and applying myself to drinking and 
company, soon mastered the return of those fits, 
for so I called them, and I had in five or six days 
got as complete a victory over conscience as any 
young fellow that resolved not to be troubled with 
it could desire. But I was to have another trial 
for it still; and Providence, as in such cases gene- 
rally it does, resolved to leave me entirely without 
excuse. For if I would not take this for a deli- 
verance, the next was to be such a one as the worst 
and most hardened wretch among us would con- 
fess both the danger and the mercy. 

The sixth day of our being at sea we came into 
Yarmouth Roads; the wind having been contrary, 
and the weather calm, we had made but little way 
since the storm. Here we were obliged to come 



OF ROBINSON CitUSOE. 11 

to anchor, and here we lay, the wind continuing 
contrary, viz. at south-west, for seven or eight 
days, during which time a great many ships from 
Newcastle came into the same roads, as the com- 
mon harbour where the ships might wait for a 
wind for the river. 

We had not however rid here so long, but should 
have tided it up the river, but that the wind blew 
too fresh; and after we had lain four or five days, 
blew very hard. However the roads being reck- 
oned as good as a harbour, the anchorage good, 
and our ground-tackle very strong, our men were 
unconcerned, and not in the least apprehensive of 
danger, but spent the time in rest and mirth, after 
the manner of the sea; but the eighth day in the 
morning, the wind increased, and we had all hands 
at work to strike our top-masts, and make every 
thing snug and close, that the ship might ride as 
easy as possible. By noon the sea went very high 
indeed, and our ship rid forecastle in, shipped seve- 
ral seas, and we thought once or twice our anchor 
had come home; upon which our master ordered 
out the sheet anchor; so that we rode with two 
anchors a-head, and the cables veered out to the 
better end. 

By this time it blew a terrible storm indeed; 
and now I began to see terror and amazement in 
the faces even of the seamen themselves. The 
master, though vigilant in the business of preserv- 
ing the ship, yet as he went in and out of his cabin 
by me, I could hear him softly to himself say 
several times, \ Lord, be merciful to us, we shall be 
all lost, we shall be all undone;' and the like. Du- 



12 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

ring these first hurries, I was stupid, lying still in 
my cabin, which was in the steerage, and cannot 
describe my temper: I could ill re-assume the first 
penitence which I had so apparently tranifrted upon, 
and hardened myself against: I thought the bitter- 
ness of death had been past, and that this would 
be nothing like the first. But when the master 
himself came by me, as I said just now, and said 
we should be all lost, I was dreadfully frighted: I 
got up out of my cabin, and looked out; but such 
a dismal sight I never saw: the sea went moun- 
tains high, and broke upon us every three or four 
minutes: when I could look about, I could see 
nothing but distress round us : two ships that rid 
near us, we found, had cut their masts by the board, 
being deep loaden; and our men cried out, that a 
ship which rid about a mile a^head of us was foun- 
dered. Two more ships being driven from their 
anchors, were run out of the roads to sea, at all 
adventures, and that with not a mast standing. 
The light ships fared the best, as not so much la- 
bouring in the sea; but two or three of them drove, 
and came close by us, running away with only their 
spritsail out before the wind. 

Towards evening the mate and boatswain beg- 
ged the master of our ship to let them cut away 
the fore-mast, which he was very unwilling to do: 
but the boatswain protesting to him, that if he did 
not, the ship would founder, he consented; and 
when they had cutaway the fore-mast, the main- 
mast stood so loose, and shook the ship so much, 
they were obliged to cut her away also, and make 
a clear deck. 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 13 

Any one may judge what a condition I must be 
in at all this, who was but a young sailor, and who 
had been in such a fright before at but a little. 
But if I can express at this distance the thoughts 
I had about me at that time, I was in tenfold more 
horror of mind upon account of my former con- 
victions, and the having returned from them to 
the resolutions I had wickedly taken at first, than 
I was at death itself; and these, added to the ter- 
ror of the storm, put me in such a condition, that 
I can by no words describe it. But the worst was 
not come yet; the storm continued with such fury, 
that the seamen themselves acknowledged they had 
never known a worse. We had a good ship, but 
she was deep loaden, and wallowed in the sea, that 
the seamen every now and then cried out, she 
would founder. It was my advantage in one re- 
spect, that I did not know what they meant by 
founder, till I enquired. However, the storm was 
so violent, that I saw what is not often seen, the 
master, the boatswain, and some others more sen- 
sible than the rest, at their prayers, and expecting 
every moment when the ship would go to the bot- 
tom. In the middle of the night, and under all 
the rest of our distresses, one of the men that had 
been down on purpose to see, cried out, we had 
sprung a leak; another said there was four foot 
water in the hold. Then all hands w r ere called to 
the pump. At that very word my heart, as I thought, 
died within me, and I fell backwards upon the side 
of my bed where I sat, into the cabin. However, 
the men roused me, and told me, that I that was 
able to do nothing before, was as well able^to pump 



14 tlfi: AND ADVENTURES 

as another: at which I stirred up, and went to the 
pump and worked very heartily. While this was 
doing, the master seeing some light colliers, who, 
not able to ride out the storm, were obliged to slip 
and run awav to sea, and would come near us, 
ordered to fire a gun as a signal of distress. I who, 
knew nothing what that meant, was so surprised, 
that I thought the ship had broke, or some dread- 
ful thing happened.- In a word, 1 was so surprised 
that I fell down in a swoon. As this was a time 
when every body had his own life to think of, no- 
body minded me, or what was become of me; but 
another man stepped up to the pump, and thrusting 
me aside with his foot, let me lie, thinking I had 
been dead; and it was a great while before I came 
to myself. 

We worked on, but the water increasing in the 
hold, it was apparent that the ship would founder; 
and though the storm began to abate a little, yet 
as it was not possible she could swim till we might 
run into a port, so the master continued firing 
guns for help; and a light ship who had rid it out 
just a-head of us, ventured a boat out to help us. 
It was with the utmost hazard the boat came near 
us, but it was impossible for us to get on board, or 
for the boat to lie near the ship's side; till at last, 
the men rowing very heartily, and venturing their 
lives to save ours, our men cast them a rope over 
the stern with the buoy to it, and then veered it 
out a great length, which they after great labour 
and hazard took hold of, and we hauled them close 
under our stern and got all into their boat. It was 
to no purpose for them or us after we were in the 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 15 

boat to think of reaching to their own ship, so all 
agreed to let her drive, and only to pull her in 
towards shore as much as we could, and our master 
promised them, that -if the boat was staved upon 
shore he would make it good to their master: so> 
partly rowing and partly driving, our boat went 
away to the northward, sloping towards the shore 
almost as far as Winterton-Ness. 

We were not much more than a quarter of an 
hour out of our ship before we saw her sink, and then 
I understood for the first time what was meant by 
a ship foundering in the sea; I must acknowledge 
I had hardly eyes to look up when the seamen told 
me she was sinking ; for from that moment they 
rather put me into the boat than that I might be 
said to go in: my heart was as it were dead with- 
in me, partly with fright, partly with horror of 
mind, and the thoughts of what was yet before me. 

While we were in this condition, the men yet 
labouring at the oar to bring the boat near the 
shore, we could see (when our boat mounting the 
waves we were able to see the shore) a great many 
people running along the shore to assist us when 
we should come near, but we made but slow wav 
towards the shore, nor were we able to reach the 
shore, till being past the light-house at Winterton, 
the shore falls off to the westward towards Cromer, 
and so the land broke off a little the violence of the 
wind: here we got in, and, though not without 
much difficulty, got all safe on shore, and walked 
afterwards on foot to Yarmouth, where, as unfor- 
tunate men, we were used with great humanity, as 
well by the magistrates of the town, who assigned 



16 LIFE AND ADVENTUKES OF 

us good quarters, as by particular merchants and 
owners of ships, and had money given us sufficient 
to carry us either to London or back to Hull, as 
we thought fit. 

Had I now had the sense to have gone back to 
Hull, and have gone home, I had been happy, and 
my father, an emblem of our blessed Saviour's pa- 
rable, had even killed the fatted calf for me; for 
hearing the ship I went away in was cast away in 
Yarmouth Road, it was a great while before he 
had any assurance that I was not drowned. 

But my ill fate pushed me on now with an obsti- 
nacy that nothing could resist; and though I had 
several times loud calls from my reason and my 
more composed judgment to go home, yet I had 
no power to do it. I know not what to call this, 
nor will I urge that it is a secret overruling decree 
that hurries us on to be the instruments of our own 
destruction, even though it be before us, and that 
we push upon it with our eyes open. Certainly 
nothing but some such decreed unavoidable misery 
attending, and which it was impossible for me to 
escape, could have pushed me forward against the 
calm reasonings and persuasions of my most retired 
thoughts, and against two such visible instructions 
as I had met with in my first attempt. 

My comrade, who had helped to harden me be- 
fore, and who was the master's son, was now less 
forward than I; the first time he spoke to me after 
we were at Yarmouth, which was not till two or 
three days, for we were separated in the town to 
several quarters ; I say, the first time he saw me, 
it appeared his tone was altered; and looking me 7 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 17 

lancholy, and shaking his head, asked me how I 
did, and telling his father who I was, and how I 
had come this voyage only for a trial, in order to 
go farther abroad; his father turning to me with 
a very grave and concerned tone, Young man, 
says he, you ought never to go to sea any more; 
you ought to take this for a plain and visible token 
that you are not to be a seafaring man. Why, 
Sir, said I, will you go to sea no more? That is 
another case, said he, it is my calling, and there- 
fore my duty; but as you made this voyage for a 
trial, you see what a taste Heaven has given you 
of what you are to expect if you persist; perhaps 
this is all befallen us on your account, like Jo- 
nah in the ship of Tarshish. Pray, continued he, 
what are you? and on what account did you go 
to sea? Upon that I told him some of my story; 
at the end of which he burst out with a strange 
kind of passion; What had I done, says he, that 
such an unhappy wretch should come into my 
ship! I would not set my foot in the same ship 
with thee again for a thousand pounds. This in- 
deed was, as I said, an excursion of his spirits, 
which were yet agitated by the sense of his loss, 
and was farther than he could have authority to 
go. However he afterwards talked very gravely 
to me, exhorted me to go back to my father and 
not tempt Providence to my ruin; told me I might 
see a visible hand of heaven against me; and, 
young man, said he, depend upon it, if you do 
not go back, wherever you go, you will meet with 
nothing but disasters and disappointments, till 
your father's words are fulfilled upon you.

18 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

We parted soon after; for I made him little an- 
swer, and I saw him no more; which way he went 
I know not. As for me, having some money in 
my pocket, I travelled to London by land; and 
there, as well as on the road, had many struggles 
with myself, what course of life I should take, 
and whether I should go home, or go to sea. 

As to going home, shame opposed the best mo- 
tions that offered to my thoughts; and it imme- 
diately occurred to me how I should be laughed 
at among the neighbours, and should be ash&med 
to see, not my father and mother only, but even 
every body else; from whence I have since often 
observed, how incongruous and irrational the 
common temper of mankind is, especially of youth, 
to that reason which ought to guide them in such 
cases, viz. that they are not ashamed to sin, and 
yet are ashamed to repent; nor ashamed of the 
action for which they ought justly to be esteemed 
fools, but are ashamed of the returning, which 
only can make them be esteemed wise men. 

In this state of life however I remained some 
time, uncertain what measures to take, and what 
course of life to lead. An irresistible reluctance 
continued to going home; and as I stayed a while, 
the remembrance of the distress I had been in wore 
off; and as that abated, the little motion I had in 
my desires to a return wore off with it, till at last 
I quite laid aside the thoughts of it, and looked 
out for a voyage. 

That evil influence which carried me first away 
from my father's house, that hurried me into the 
wild and indigested notion of raising my fortune; 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 19 

and that imprest those conceits so forcibly upon 
me, as to make me deaf to all good advice, and to 
the entreaties and even the command of my father: 
I say, the same influence, whatever it was, pre- 
sented the most unfortunate of all enterprizes to 
my view; and I went on board a vessel bound to 
the coast of Africa; or, as our sailors vulgarly call 
it, a vovage to Guinea. 

It was my great misfortune that in all these ad- 
ventures I did not ship myself as a sailor; whereby, 
though I might indeed have worked a little harder 
than ordinary, yet at the same time I had learned 
the duty and oliice of a fore-mast man; and in 
time might have qualified myself for a mate or 
lieutenant, if not for a master. But as it was 
always my fate to choose for the worse, so I did 
here; for having money in my pocket, and good 
clothes upon my back, I would always go on board 
in the habit of a gentleman; and so I neither had 
any business in the ship, or learned to do any. 

It was my lot first of all to fall into pretty good 
company in London, which does not always happen 
tu such loose and unguided young fellows as I then 
was; the devil generally not omitting to lay some 
snare for them very early: but it was not so with 
me. I first fell acquainted with the master of a 
ship who had been on the coast of Guinea; and 
who having had very good success there, was re- 
solved to go again; and who taking a fancy to my 
conversation, which was not at all disagreeable at 
that time, hearing me say I had a mind to see the 
world, told me if I would go the voyage with him 
I should be at no expence; I should be his mess- 

c 2 



20 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

mate and his companion, and if I could carry any 
thing with me, I should have all the advantage of 
it that the trade would admit; and perhaps I might 
meet with some encouragement 

I embraced the offer, and entering into a strict 
friendship with this captain, who was an honest 
and plain-dealing man, I went the voyage with 
him, and carried a small adventure with me, which 
by the disinterested honesty of my friend, the cap- 
tain, I increased very considerably; for I carried 
about 40/, in such toys and trifles as the captain 
directed me to buy. This 40/. I had mustered 
together by the assistance of some of my relations 
whom I corresponded with, and who, I believe, 
got my father, or at least my mother, to contribute 
so much as that to my first adventure. 

This was the only voyage which I may say was 
successful in all my adventures, and which I owe 
to the integrity and honesty of my friend the cap- 
tain, under whom also I got a competent know- 
ledge of the mathematics, and the rules of naviga- 
tion, learned how to keep an account of the ship's 
course, take an observation, and, in short, to un- 
derstand some things that were needful to be un- 
derstood by a sailor: for as he took delight to in- 
struct me, I took delight to learn; and, in a word, 
this voyage made me both a sailor and a merchant: 
for I brought home 5 pounds 9 ounces of gold dust 
for my adventure, which yielded me in London at 
my return, almost 300/. and this filled me with 
those aspiring thoughts which have since so com- 
pleted mv ruin. 

Yet even in this voyage I had my misfortunes 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 21 

too; particularly, that I was continually sick, being 
thrown into a violent calenture by the excessive 
heat of the climate; our principal trading being 
upon the coast, from the latitude of 15 degrees 
north even to the line itself. 

I was now set up for a Guinea trader ; and my 
friend, to my great misfortune, dying soon after his 
arrival, I resolved to go the same voyage again, 
and I embarked in the same vessel with one who 
was his mate in the former voyage, and had now 
got the command of the ship. This was the un- 
happiest voyage that ever man made; for though 
I did not carry quite 100/. of my new gained 
wealth, so that I had 200 left, and which 1 lodged 
with my friend's widow, who was very just to me, 
yet I fell into terrible misfortunes in this voyage; 
and the first was this, viz. Our ship making her 
course towards the Canary Islands, or rather be- 
tween those islands and the African shore, was 
surprised in the grey of the morning, by a Turkish 
rover of Sallee, who gave chase to us with all the 
sail she could make. We crowded also as much 
canvas as our yards would spread, or our masts 
carry, to have got clear; but finding the pirate 
gained upon us, and would certainly come up with 
us in a few hours, we prepared to fight; our ship 
having ] c 2 guns, and the rogue 18. About three 
in the afternoon he came up with us, and bringing 
to, by mistake, just athwart our quarter, instead of 
athwart our stern, as he intended, we brought eight 
of our guns to bear on that side, and poured in a 
broadside upon him, which made him sheer off 
again, after returning our fire, and pouring in also 



%k Life and adventures 

his small shot from near £00 men which he had 
on board. However, we had not a man touched, 
all our men keeping close. He prepared to attack 
us again, and we to defend ourselves; but laying 
us on board the next time upon our other quarter, 
he entered 60 men upon our decks, who immedi- 
ately fell to cutting and hacking the decks and 
rigging. We plied them With small shot, half- 
pikes, powder-chests, and such like, and cleared 
our deck of them twice. However, to cut short 
this melancholy part of our stor\~, our ship being- 
disabled, and three of our men killed, and eight 
wounded, we were obliged to yield, and were car- 
ried all prisoners into Sallee, a port belonging to 
the Moors. 

The usage I had there was not so dreadful as at 
first I apprehended, nor was I carried up the coun- 
try to the emperor's court, as the rest of our men 
were, but was kept by the captain of the rover, as 
his proper prize, and made his slave, being young 
and nimble, and fit for his business. At this sur- 
prising change of my circumstances, from a mer- 
chant to a miserable slave, I was perfectly over- 
whelmed; and now I looked back upon my father's 
prophetic discourse to me, that I should be mise- 
rable, and have none to relieve me, which I thought 
was now so effectually brought to pass, that I could 
not be worse; that now the hand of Heaven had 
overtaken me, and I was undone without/redemp- 
tion. But, alas! this was but a taste of the misery 
I was to go through, as will appear in the sequel 
of the story. 
• As my new patron or master had taken me home 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 23 

to his house, so I was in hopes that he would take 
me with him when he went to sea again, believing 
that it would some fime or other be his fate to be 
taken by a Spanish or Portugal man of war; and 
that then I should be set at liberty. But this hope 
of mine was soon taken away; for when he went 
to sea, he left me on shore to look after his little 
garden, and do the common drudgery of slaves 
about his house; and when he came home again 
from his cruise, he ordered me to lie in the cabin 
to look after the ship. 

Here I meditated nothing but my escape; and 
what method I might take to effect it, but found 
no way that had the least probability in it: nothing 
presented to make the supposition of it rational; 
for I had nobody to communicate it to, that would 
embark with me; no fellow-slave, no Englishman, 
Irishman, or Scotsman, there but myself; so that 
for two years, though I often pleased myself with 
the imagination, yet I never had the least encou- 
raging prospect of putting it in practice. 

After about two years an odd circumstance pre- 
sented itself, which put the old thought of making 
some attempt for my liberty again in my head: 
my patron lying at home longer than usual, with- 
out fitting out his ship, which, as I heard, was for 
want of money, he used constantly, once or twice 
a week, sometimes oftener, if the weather was fair, 
to take the ship's pinnace, and go out into the 
road a fishing; and as he always took me and a 
young Maresco with him to row the boat, we 
made him very merry, and I proved very dexte- 



24 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

rous in catching fish; insomuch that sometimes he 
would send me with a Moor, one of his kinsmen, 

and the youth, the Maresco as they called him, to 

catch a dish offish for him. 

It happened one time, that going a fishing in a 
stark calm morning, a fog rose so thick, that 
though we were not half a league from the shore, 
we lost sight of it; and rowing we knew not 
whither or which way, we laboured all day, and 
all the next night, and when the morning came 
we found we had pulled off to sea instead of pull- 
ing in for the shore; and that we were at least 
two leagues from the shore: however we got well 
in again, though with a great deal of labour, and 
some danger; for the wind began to blow pretty 
fresh in the morning; but particularly we were all 
very hungry. 

But our patron, warned by this disaster, resolved 
to take more care of himself for the future; and 
having lying by him the long boat of our English 
ship he had taken, he resolved he would not go a 
fishing any more without a compass and some pro- 
vision; so he ordered the carpenter of his ship, 
who also was an English slave, to build a little 
state-room or cabin in the middle of the long-boat, 
like that of a barge, with a place to stand behind 
it to steer and hale home the main-sheet; and room 
before for a hand or two to stand and work the 
sails; she sailed with what we call a shoulder of 
mutton sail; and the boom gibed over the top of 
the cabin, which lay very snug and low, and had 
in it room for him to lie, with a slave or two, and 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 25 

a table to eat on, with some small lockers to put 
in some bottles of such liquor as he thought fit to 
drink; particularly his bread, rice, and coffee. 

We went frequently out with this boat a fishing, 
and as I was most dexterous to catch fish for him, 
he never went without me. It happened that he 
had appointed to go out in this boat, either for 
pleasure or for fish, with two or three Moors of 
some distinction in that place, and for whom he 
had provided extraordinarily; and had therefore 
sent on board the boat over night a larger store 
of provisions than ordinary; and had ordered me 
to get ready three fusees with powder and shot, 
which were on board his ship; for that they de- 
signed some sport of fowling, as well as fishing. 

I got all things ready as he had directed, and 
waited the next morning with the boat washed 
clean, her ancient and pendants out, and every 
thing to accommodate his guests; when by and 
by my patron came on board alone, and told me 
his guests had put off going, upon some business 
that fell out, and ordered me with the man and 
boy, as usual, to go out with the boat and catch 
them some fish, for that his friends were to sup at 
his house; and commanded that as soon as I got 
some fish I should bring it home to his house; all 
which I prepared to do. 

This moment my former notions of deliverance 
darted into my thoughts, for now I found I was 
like to have a little ship at my command; and my 
master being gone, I prepared to furnish myself, 
not for fishing business, but for a voyage ; though 
I knew not, neither did I so much as consider, 



26 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

whither I should steer; for any where to get out 
of that place was my way. 

My first contrivance was to make a pretence to 
speak to this Moor, to get something for our sub- 
sistance on hoard; for I told him we must not 
presume to eat of our patron's bread: he said, that 
was true; so he brought a large basket of rusk or 
biscuit of their kind, and three jars with fresh 
water into the boat. I knew where my patron's 
case of bottles stood, which it was evident by the 
make were taken out of some English prize; and 
I conveyed them into the boat while the Moor 
was on shore, as if they had been there before for 
our master: I conveyed also a great lump of bees- 
wax into the boat, which weighed above half a 
hundred weight, with a parcel of twine or thread, 
a hatchet, a saw, and a hammer, all which were of 
great use to us afterwards; especially the wax to 
make candles. Another trick I tried upon him, 
which he innocently came into also; his name 
was Ismael, who they call Muly, or Moley; so I 
called to him, Moley, said I, our patron's guns are 
on board the boat, can you not get a little powder 
and shot, it may be we may kill some Alcamics (a 
fowl like our curlews) for ourselves, for I know 
he keeps the gunner's stores in the ship? Yes, 
says he, I'll bring some, and accordingly he 
brought a great leather pouch which held about a 
pound and a half of powder, or rather more; and 
another with shot, that had five or six pounds, 
with some bullets, and put all into the boat: at 
the same time I had found some powder of my 
master's in the great cabin, with which I filled one 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 27 

of the large bottles in the case, which was almost 
empty; pouring what was in it into another: and 
thus furnished with everything needful,, we sailed 
out of the port to fish. The castle which is at the 
entrance of the port knew who we were, and took 
no notice of us; and, we were not above a mile 
out of the port before we haled in our sail, and set 
us, down to fish: the wind blew from the N. N. E. 
which was contrary to my desire; for had it blown 
southerly I had been sure to have made the coast 
of Spain, and at least reached to the bay of Cadiz; 
but my resolutions were, blow which way it would, 
I would be gone from that horrid place where I 
w r as, and leave the rest to fate. 

After we had fished some time and catched no- 
thing, for when I had fish on my hook I would 
not pull them up, that he might not see them; I 
said to the Moor, this will not do, our master will 
not be thus served, we must stand farther off: he 
thinking no harm agreed, and being in the head 
of the boat set the sails; and as I had the helm I 
run the boat out near a league farther, and then 
brought her to as if I would fish, when giving the 
boy the helm, I stept forward to where the Moor 
was, and making as if I stooped for something 
behind him, I took him by surprise with my arm 
under his twist, and tossed him clear overboard 
into the sea. He rose immediately, for he swam 
like a cork, and calling to me, begged to be taken 
in, told me he would go all over the world with 
me; he swam so strong after the boat that he 
would have reached me very quickly, there being 
but little wind; upon which I- stept into the cabin, 



28 LIFE AND ADVENTUliES 

and fetching one of the fowling-pieces, I presented 
it at him, and told him, I had done him no hurt, 
and if he would be quiet I would do him none: 
but, said I, you swim well enough to reach to the 
shore, and the sea is calm, make the best of your 
way to shore, and I will do jou no harm, but if 
you come near the boat I'll shoot you through the 
head; for I am resolved to have my liberty: so he 
turned himself about and swam for the shore, and 
I make no doubt but he reached it with ease, for 
he was "an excellent swimmer. 

I could have been content to have taken this 
Moor with me, and have drowned the boy, but 
there was no venturing to trust him. When he was 
gone I turned to the boy, who they called Xury, 
and said to him, Xury, if you will be faithful to 
me I'll make you a great man, but if you will not 
stroke your face to be true to me, that is, swear 
by Mahomet and his father's beard, I must throw 
you into the sea too: the boy smiled in my face, 
and spoke so innocently that I could not mistrust 
him; and swore to be faithful to me, and go all 
over the world with me. 

While I was in view of the Moor that was swim- 
ming, I stood out directly to sea with the boat, 
rather stretching to windward, that they might 
think me gone towards the Straits mouth (as in- 
deed any one that had been in their wits must 
have been supposed to do,) for who would have 
supposed we were sailed on to the southward to 
the truly Barbarian coast, where whole nations of 
negroes were sure to surround us with their canoes, 
and destroy us; where we could never once go on 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 29 

shore but we should be devoured by savage beasts, 
or more merciless savages of human kind? 

But as soon as it grew dusk in the evening, I 
changed my course, and steered directly south and 
by east, bending my course a little toward the east, 
that I might keep in with the shore; and having 
a fair fresh gale of wind, and a smooth quiet sea, I 
made such sail that I believe by the next day at 
three o'clock in the afternoon, when I first made 
the land, I could not be less than 150 miles south 
of Sallee; quite beyond the emperor of Morocco's 
dominions, or indeed of any other king thereabouts, 
for we saw no people. 

Yet such was the fright I had taken at the 
Moors, and the dreadful apprehensions I had of 
falling into their hands, that I would not stop, or 
go on shore, or come to an anchor. The wind con- 
tinuing fair till I had sailed in that manner five 
days, and then the wind shifting to the south- 
ward, I concluded also that if any of our vessels 
were in chase of me, they also would now give 
over; so I ventured to make to the coast, and 
come to an anchor in the mouth of a little river, 
I knew not what, or where; neither what latitude, 
what country, what nation, or what river: I nei- 
ther saw, or desired to see any people, the princi- 
pal thing I wanted was fresh water. We came 
into this creek in the evening, resolving to swim 
on shore as soon as it was dark, and discover the 
country; but as soon as it was quite dark, we heard 
such dreadful noises of the barking, roaring, and 
howling of wild creatures of we knew not what 
kinds, that the poor boy was ready to die with fear, 



30 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

and begged of me not to go on shore till day. 
Well, Xury, said I, then I won't, but it may be we 
may see mjen by day, who will be as bad to us as 
those lions. Then we give them the shoot gun, 
says Xury, laughing; make them run wey. Such 
English Xury spoke by conversing among us slaves. 
However I was glad to see the boy so cheerful, 
and I gave him a dram (out of our patron's case 
of bottles) to cheer him up: after all, Xury's ad- 
vice was good, and I took it; we dropped our little 
anchor and lay still all night; I say still, for we 
slept none ; for in two or three hours we saw vast 
great creatures (we knew not what to call them) 
of manv sorts, come down to the sea-shore and run 
into the water, wallowing and washing themselves 
for the pleasure of cooling themselves; and they 
made such hideous bowlings and yellings, that I 
never indeed heard the like. 

Xury was dreadfully frighted, and indeed so was 
I too; but we were both more frighted when we 
heard one of these mighty creatures come swim- 
ming towards our boat: we could not see him, but 
we might hear him by his blowing to be a mon- 
strous huge and furious beast. Xury said it was a 
lion, and it might be so for aught I know; but 
poor Xury cried to me to weigh the anchor and 
row away. No, says I, Xury, we can slip our cable 
with a buoy to it and go off to sea, they cannot 
follow us far. I had no sooner said so, but I per- 
ceived the creature (whatever it was) within two 
oars length, which something surprised me; how- 
ever I immediately stept to the cabin-door, and 
taking up my gun fired at him, upon which he 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 31 

immediately turned about, and swam towards the 
shore again. 

But it is impossible to describe the horrible 
noises, and hideous cries and howlings, that were 
raised, as well upon the edge of the shore, as higher 
within the country, upon the noise or report of 
the gun; a thing I have some reason to believe 
those creatures had never heard before : this con- 
vinced me that there was no going on shore for 
us in the night upon that coast, and how to ven- 
ture on shore in the day was another question too; 
for to have fallen into the hands of any of the 
savages, had been as bad as to have fallen into the 
hands of lions and tigers; at least we were equally 
apprehensive of the danger of it. 

Be that as it would, we were obliged to go on 
shore somewhere or other for water, for we had 
not a pint left in the boat; when or where to get 
to it was the point. Xury said, if I would let him 
go on shore with one of the jars, he w r ould find if 
there was any water and bring some to me. I 
asked him why he would go? why I should not go 
and he stay in the boat? The boy answered with 
so much affection that made me love him ever 
after. Says he, If wild mans come, they eat me, 
you go wey. Well, Xury, said I, we will both 
go, and if the wild mans come, we will kill them, 
they shall eat neither of us; so I gave Xury a 
piece of rusk-bread to eat, and a dram out of our 
patrons case of bottles which I mentioned before; 
and we haled the boat in as near the shore as we 
thought was proper, and waded on shore; carrying 
nothing but our arms, and two jars for water. 



32 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

I did not care to go out of sight of the boat, 
fearing the coming of canoes with savages down 
the river: but the boy seeing a low place about a 
mile up the country rambled to it; and by and by 
I saw him come running towards me. I thought 
he was pursued by some savage, or frighted with 
some wild beast, and I ran forward towards him 
to help him, but when I came nearer to him, I 
saw something hanging over his shoulders, which 
was a creature that he had shot, like a hare, but 
different in colour, and longer legs; however we 
were very glad of it, and it was very good meat; 
but the great joy that poor Xury came with, was 
to tell me he had found good water, and seen no 
wild mans. 

But we found afterwards that we need not take 
such pains for water; for a little higher up the 
creek where we were, we found the water fresh 
when the tide was out, which flows but a little 
way up; so we filled our jars and feasted on the 
hare we had killed, and prepared to go on our 
way, having seen no foot-steps of any human 
creature in that part of the country. 

As I had been one voyage to this coast before, 
I knew very well that the islands of the Canaries, 
and the Cape de Verd islands also, lay not far off 
from the coast. But as I had no instruments to 
take an observation to kuow what latitude we were 
in, and not exactly knowing, or at least remem- 
bering, what latitude they were in, I knew not 
where to look for them, or when to stand off to 
sea towards them; otherwise I might now easily 
have found some of these islands. But my hope 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 33 

was, that if I stood along this coast till I came to 
that part where the English traced, I should find 
some of their vessels upon their usual design of 
trade, that would relieve and take us in. 

By the best of my calculation, that place where 
I now was, must be that country, which lying be- 
tween the emperor of Morocco's dominions and 
the Negroes, lies waste, and uninhabited, except 
by wild beasts; the Negroes having abandoned 
it, and gone farther south for fear of the Moors; 
and the Moors not thinking it worth inhabiting, 
by reason of its barrenness; and indeed both for- 
saking it because of the prodigious number of 
tigers, lions, leopards, and other furious creatures 
which harbour there; so that the Moors use it for 
their hunting only, where they go like an army, 
two or three thousand men at a time; and indeed 
for near an hundred miles together upon this coast, 
we saw nothing but a waste uninhabited country 
by day; and heard nothing but bowlings and roar- 
ing of wild beasts by night. 

Once or twice in the day time I thought I saw 
the Pico of Tenerifre, being the high top of the 
mountain Teneriffe in the Canaries; and had a 
great mind to venture out in hopes of reaching 
thither; but having tried twice, I was forced in 
again by contrary winds, the sea also going too 
high for my little vessel, so I resolved to pursue 
my first design and keep along the shore. 

Several times I was obliged to land for fresh 
water, after we had left this place; and once in 
particular, being early in the morning, we came 
to an anchor under a little point of laud which was 

VOL. I. v 



34 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

pretty high, and the tide beginning to flow, we lay- 
still to go farther in. Xury, whose eyes were more 
about him than it seems mine were, calls softly to 
me, and tells me that we had best go farther off 
the shore; for, says he, look yonder lies a dread- 
ful monster on the side of that hillock fast asleep. 
I looked where he pointed, and saw a dreadful 
monster indeed, for it was a terrible great lion that 
lay on the side of the shore, under the shade of a 
piece of the hill that hung as it were a little over 
him. Xury, says I, you shall go on shore and kill 
him: Xury looked frighted, and said, Me kill! he 
eat me at one mouth; one mouthful he meant. 
However, I said no more to the boy, but bade him 
lie still; and took our biggest gun, which was 
almost musquet-bore, and loaded it with a good 
charge of powder, and with two slugs, and laid it 
down; then I loaded another gun with two bul- 
lets; and the third, for we had three pieces, I 
loaded with five smaller bullets. I took the best 
aim I could with the first piece, to have shot him 
into the head, but he lay so with his leg raised a 
little above his nose, that the slugs hit his leg about 
the knee, and broke the bone. He started up 
growling at first, but finding his leg broke fell 
down again, and then got up upon three legs, and 
gave the most hideous roar that ever I heard. I 
was a little surprised that I had not hit him on 
the head; however, I took up the second piece 
immediately, and, though he began to move off, 
fired again, and shot him into the head, and had 
the pleasure to see him drop, and make but little 
noise, but lay struggling for life. Then Xury 



i)T ROBINSON CRUSOE. $5 

took heart, and would have me let him go on shore. 
Well, go, said I. So the boy jumped into the water, 
and taking a little gun in one hand, swam to shore 
with the other hand, and coming close to the crea- 
ture, put the muzzle of the piece to his ear, and 
shot him into E the head again, which dispatched 
him quite. 

This was game indeed to us, but this was no 
food; and I was very sorry to lose three charges 
of powder and shot upon a creature that was good 
for nothing to us. However, Xury said he would 
have some of him; so he comes on board, and 
asked me to give him the hatchet. For what. 
Xury? said I. Me cut off his head, said he. 
However, Xury could not cut off his head, but he 
cut off a foot, and brought it with him, and it was 
a monstrous great one. 

I bethought myself however, that perhaps the 
skin of him might one way or other be of some 
value to us; and I resolved to take off his skin, if 
I could. So Xurv and I went to work with him: 
but Xury was much the better workman at it, for 
I knew very ill how to do it. Indeed it took us 
up both the whole day; but at last we got off the 
hide of him, and spreading it on the top of our 
cabin, the sun effectually dried it in two days time, 
and it afterwards served me to lie upon. 

After this stop, we made on to the southward 
continually for ten or twelve days, living very 
sparing on our provisions, which began to abate 
very much, and going no oftener into the shore 
than we were obliged to for fresh water: my de- 
sign in this was, to make the river Gambia or Se- 

d 2 



56 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

negal, that is to say, any where about the Cape de 
Verd, where I was in hopes to meet with some 
European ship; and if I did not, I knew not what 
course I had to take, but to seek for the Islands, 
or perish there among the Negroes. I knew that 
all the ships from Europe, which sailed either to 
the coast of Guinea or to Brasil, or to the East In- 
dies, made this Cape, or those Islands; and, in a 
word, I put the whole of my fortune upon this 
single point, either that I must meet with some 
ship, or must perish. 

When I had pursued this resolution about ten 
days longer, as I have said, I began to see that the 
land was inhabited; and in two or three places, as 
we sailed by, we saw people stand upon the shore 
to look at us ; we could also perceive they were 
quite black, and stark naked. I was once inclined 
to have gone on shore to them; but Xury was 
my better counsellor, and said to me, No go, no 
go: however I hauled in nearer the shore that I 
might talk to them, and I found they ran along 
the shore by me a good way. I observed they had 
no weapons in their hands, except one, who had a 
long slender stick, which Xury said was a lance, 
and that they would throw them a great way with 
good aim. so I kept at a distance, but talked with 
them by signs as well as I could; and particularly 
made signs for something to eat: they beckoned 
to me to stop my boat, and they would fetch me 
some meat; upon this I lowered the top of my 
sail, and lay by, and two of them ran up into the 
country, and in less than half au hour came back, 
and brought with them two pieces of dry flesh 



or ROBINSON CRUSOE. 37 

and some corn, such as is the produce of their 
country; but we neither knew what the one nor 
the other was : however, we were willing to accept 
it, but how to come at it was our next dispute, for 
I was not for venturing on shore to them, and 
they were as much afraid of us; but they took a 
safe way for us all, for they brought it to the shore 
and laid it down, and went and stood a great way 
off till we fetched it on board, and then came close 
to us again. 

We made signs of thanks to them, for w r e bad 
nothing to make them amends; but an opportunity 
offered that very instant to oblige them wonder- 
fully; for w r hile we were lying by the shore, came 
two mighty creatures, one pursuing the other (as 
we took it) with great fury, from the mountains 
towards the sea: whether it was the male pursuing 
the female, or whether they were in sport or in 
rage, we could not tell, any more than we could 
tell whether it was usual or strange, but I believe 
it was the latter; because, in the first place, those 
ravenous creatures seldom appear but in the night; 
and in the second place, we found the people ter- 
ribly frighted, especially the women. The man 
that had the lance or dart did not fly from them, 
but the rest did; however, as the two creatures 
ran directly into the water, they did not seem to 
offer to fall upon any of the Negroes, but plunged 
themselves into the sea, and swam about as if they 
had come for their diversion. At last one of them 
began to come nearer our boat than at first I ex- 
pected, but I lay ready for him, for I had loaded 
my gun with all possible expedition, and badeXury 



58 LIVE AND ADVENTURES 

load both the others. As soon as hecwrue fairly 
within my reach, I fired, and shot him directly 
into the head. Immediately he sunk down into 
the water, but rose instantly, and plunged up and 
down as if he was struggling for life; and so in- 
deed he was: he immediately made to the shore, 
but between the wound, which was his mortal 
hurt, and the strangling of the water, he died just 
before he reached the shore. 

It is impossible to express the astonishment of 
these poor creatures at the noise and the fire of my 
gun; some of them were even ready to die for fear, 
and fell down as dead with the very terror. But 
when they saw the creature dead, and sunk in the 
water/ and that I made signs to them to come to 
the shore, they took heart and came to the shore, 
and began to search for the creature. I found him 
by his blood staining the water; and by the help 
of a rope, which I slung round him, and gave the 
Negroes to haul, they dragged him on shore, and 
found that it was a most curious leopard, spotted 
and fine to an admirable degree, and the Negroes 
held up their hands with admiration to think what 
it was I had killed him with. 

The other creature, frighted with the flash of fire 
and the noise of the gun, swam on shore, and ran 
up directly to the mountains from whence they 
came, nor could I at that distance know what it 
was. I found quickly the Negroes were for eat- 
ing the flesh of this creature, so I was willing to 
have them take it as a favour from me, which 
when I made signs to them that they might take 
him, they were very thankful for. Immediately 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 39 

they fell to work with him, and though they had 
no. knife, yet with a sharpened piece of wood they 
took off his skin as readily, and much more readily, 
than we could have done with a knife : they offered 
me some of the flesh, which I declined, making as 
if I would give it them, but made signs for the 
skin, which they gave me very freely, and brought 
me a great deal more of their provision, which 
though I did not understand, yet I accepted; then 
I made signs to them for some water, and held out 
one of my jars to them, turning it bottom upward, 
to shew that it was empty, and that I wanted to 
have it filled. They called immediately to some 
of their friends, and there came two women, and 
brought a great vessel made of earth, and burnt, as 
I suppose, in the sun; this they set down for me> 
as before, and I sent Xury on shore with my jars, 
and filled them all three. The women were as 
stark naked as the men. 

I was now furnished with roots and corn, such 
as it was, and water; and, leaving my friendly 
Negroes, I made forward for about eleven days 
more, without offering to go near the shore, till I 
saw the land run out a great length into the sea, 
at about the distance of four or five leagues before 
me; and, the sea being very calm, I kept a large 
offing to make this point: at length, doubling the 
point at about two leagues from the land, I saw 
plainly land on the other side to seaward ; then I 
concluded, as it was most certain indeed, that this 
was the Cape de Verd, and those the islands, called 
from thence Cape de Verd Islands. However, 
they were at a great distance, and I could not well 



40 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

tell what I had best to do, for if I should be taken 
with a fresh of wind I might neither reach one nor 
the other. 

In this dilemma, #s I was very pensive, I stept 
into the cabin and set me down, Xury having the 
helm; when on a sudden the boy cried out, Master, 
master, a ship with a sail! and the foolish boy was 
frighted out of his wits, thinking it must needs be 
some of his master's ships sent to pursue us, when 
I knew we were gotten far enough out of their 
reach. I jumped out of the cabin, and immedi- 
ately saw not only the ship, but what she was, (viz.) 
that it was a Portuguese ship, and, as I thought, 
was hound to the coast of Guinea for Negroes. 
But when I observed the course she steered, I was 
soon convinced they were bound some other way, 
and did not design to come any nearer to the shore; 
upon which I stretched out to sea as much as I 
could, resolving to speak with them if possible. 

With all the sail I could make, I found I should 
not be able to come in their way, but that they 
would be gone by before I could make any signal 
to them. But after I had crowded to the utmost, 
and began to despair; they, it seems, saw me by 
the help of their perspective-glasses, and that it 
was some European boat, which, as they supposed, 
must belong to some ship that was lost; so they 
shortened sail to let me come up. I was encou- 
raged with this, and as I had my patron's ancient 
on board, I made a waft of it to them for a signal 
of distress, and fired a gun, both which they saw; 
for they told me they saw the smoke, though they 
did not hear the gun. Upon these signals they 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 41 

very kindly brought-to, and lay-by for me, and in 
about three hours time I came up with them. 

They asked me what I was, in Portuguese, and 
in Spanish, and in French; but I understood none 
of them; but at last a Scots sailor, who was on 
board, called to me, and I answered him, and told 
him I was an Englishman, that I had made my 
escape out of slavery from the Moors at Sal lee. 
Then they bade me come on board, and very kindly 
took me in, and all my goods. 

It was an inexpressible joy to me, that any one 
would believe that I was thus delivered, as I 
esteemed it, from such a miserable and almost 
hopeless condition as I was in, and immediately 
offered all I had to the captain of the ship, as a 
return for my deliverance; but he generously told 
me, he would take nothing from me, but that all 
I had should be delivered safe to me when I came 
to the Brasils; for, says he, I have saved your 
life on no other terms than I would be glad to be 
saved myself; and it may one time or other be my 
lot to be taken up in the same condition: Besides, 
said he, when I carry you to the Brasils, so great 
a way from your own country, if I should take 
from you what you have, you will be starved there, 
and then I only take away that life I have given. 
No, no, Seignior Inglese, says he, Mr. English- 
man, I will carry you thither in charity, and those 
things will help you to buy your subsistence there, 
and your passage home again. 

As he was charitable in his proposal, so he was 
just in the performance to a tittle, for he ordered 
the seamen, that none should offer to touch any 



42 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

thing I had; then he took every thing into his 
own possession, and gave me back an exact inven- 
tory of them, that I might have them; even so 
much as my three earthen jars. 

As to my boat, it was a very good one, and that 
he saw, and told me he would buy it of me for the 
ship's use, and asked me what I would have for it? 
I told him, he had been so generous to me in every 
thing, that I could not offer to make any price of 
the boat, but left it entirely to him; upon which 
he told me he would give me a note of his hand 
to pay me 80 pieces of eight for it at Brasii; and 
when it came there, if any one offered to give 
more, he would make it up; he offered me also 60 
pieces of eight more for my boy Xury, which I 
was loth to take; not that I was not willing to 
let the captain have him, but I was very loth to 
sell the poor boy's liberty, who had assisted me so 
faithfully in procuring my own. However, when 
I let him know my reason, he owned it to be just, 
and offered me this medium, that he would give 
the boy an obligation to set him free in ten years, 
if he turned Christian. Upon this, and Xury say- 
ing he was willing to go to him, I let the captain 
have him. 

We had a very good voyage to the BrasiJs, and 
arrived in the Bay de Todos, los Samos, or All- 
Saints- Bay, in about twenty-two clays after. And 
now I was once more delivered from the most 
miserable of all conditions of life, and what to do 
next with myself I was now to consider. 

The generous treatment the captain gave me, 
I can never enough remember; he would take 



OF EOBINSON CRUSOE. 43 

nothing of me for my passage, gave me twenty 
ducats for the leopard's skin, and forty for the 
lion's skin, which I had in my boat, and caused 
every thing I had in the ship to he punctual \y de- 
livered me; and what I was willing to sell lie 
bought, such as the case of bottles, two of my 
guns, and a piece of the lump of bees-wax, for I 
had made candles of the rest; in a word, I /made 
about 220 pieces of eight of all my cargo, and with 
this stock I went on shore in the Brasils. 

I had not been long here, but being recom- 
mended to the house of a good honest man like 
himself, who had an Ingenio as they call it; that 
is, a plantation and a sugar house, I lived with 
him some time, and acquainted myself by that 
means with the manner of their planting and mak- 
ing of sugar; and seeing how well the planters 
lived, and how they grew rich suddenly, I resolved, 
if I could get license to settle there, I would turn 
planter among them, resolving in the mean time 
to find out some way to get my money, which I 
had left in London, remitted to me To this pur- 
pose, getting a kind of a letter of naturalization, 
I purchased as much land that was uncured as my 
money would reach, and formed a plan for my 
plantation and settlement, and such a one as might 
be suitable to the stock which I proposed to my- 
self to receive from England. 

I had a neighbour, a Portuguese of Lisbon, but 
born of English parents, whose name was Wells, 
and in much such circumstances as I was. I call 
him neighbour, because his plantation lay next to 
mine, and we went qia very sociable together. My 



44 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

stock was but low, as well as his; and we rather 
planted for food, than any thing else, for about 
two years. However, we began to increase, and 
our land began to come into order; so that the 
third year we planted some tobacco, and made each 
of us a large piece of ground ready for planting 
canes in the year to come; but we both wanted 
help; and now I found, more than before, I had 
done wrong in parting with my boy Xury. 

But alas ! for me to do wrong, that never did 
right, was no great wonder: I had no remedy but 
to go on ; I was gotten into an employment quite 
remote to my genius, and directly contrary to. the 
life I delighted in, and for which I forsook my 
father's house, and broke through all his good ad- 
vice; nay, I was coming into the very middle 
station, or upper degree of low life, which my fa- 
ther advised me to before; and which if I resolved 
to go on with, I might as well have staid at home, 
and never have fatigued myself in the world as I 
had done; and I used often to say to myself, I 
could have done this as well in England among 
my friends, as have gone five thousand miles off 
to do it, among strangers and savages in a wilder- 
ness, and at such distance as never to hear from 
any part of the world that had the least knowledge 
of me. 

In this manner I used to look upon my condition 
with the utmost regret. I had nobody to converse 
with, but now and then this neighbour: no work 
to be done, but by the labour of my hands; and I 
used to say, I lived just like a man cast away upon 
some desolate island, that had nobody there but 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 45 

himself. But how just has it been, and how should 
all men reflect, that, when they compare their pre- 
sent conditions with others that are worse, Hea- 
ven may oblige them to make the exchange, and 
be convinced of their former felicity, by their ex- 
perience; I say, how just has it been, that the truly 
solitary life I reflected on in an island of mere de- 
solation should be my lot, who had so often un- 
justly compared it with the life which I then led, 
in which, had I continued, I had in all probability 
been exceeding prosperous and rich. 

I was in some degree settled in my measures 
for carrying on the plantation, before my kind 
friend the captain of the ship, that took me up at 
sea, went back; for the ship remained there, in 
providing his loading, and preparing for his voy- 
age, near three months; when, telling him what 
little stock I had left behind me in London, he 
gave me this friendly and sincere advice: Seignor 
Inglese, says he (for so he always called me) If you 
will give me letters, and a procuration here in 
form to me, with orders to the person who has 
your money in London, to send your effects to 
Lisbon, to such persons as I shall direct, and in 
such goods as are proper for this country, I will 
bring you the produce of them, God willing, at 
my return ; but since human affairs are all subject 
to changes and disasters, I would have you give 
orders but for one hundred pounds sterling, which 
you say is half your stock, and let the hazard be 
run for the first; so that if it eome safe, you may 
order the rest the same way; and if it miscarry, 



•i6 LSMS AND ADVENTURES 

you may have the other half to have recourse to 
for your supply. 

This was so wholesome advice, and looked so 
friendly, that I could not hut he convinced it was 
the best course I could take; so I accordingly pre- 
pared letters to the gentlewoman with whom I had 
left my money, and a procuration to the Portu- 
guese captain, as he desired. 

I wrote the English captain's widow a full ac- 
count of all my adventures, my slavery, escape, 
and how I had met with the Portugal captain at 
sea, the humanity of his behaviour, and what con- 
dition I was now in, with all other necessary 
directions for my supply; and when this honest 
captain came to Lisbon, he found means, by some 
of the English merchants there, to send over, not 
the order only, but a full account of my story, to 
a merchant at London, who represented it effec- 
tually to her ; whereupon, she not only delivered 
the money, but out of her own pocket sent the 
Portugal captain a very handsome present for his 
humanity and charity to me. 

The merchant in London vesting this hundred 
pounds in English goods, such as the captain had 
written for, sent them directly to him at Lisbon, 
and he brought them all safe to me to the Brasils; 
among which, without my direction (for I was too 
young in my business to think of them) he had 
taken care to have all sorts of tools, iron-work, and 
utensils necessary for my plantation, and which 
were of great use to me. 

When this cargo arrived I thought my fortune 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 47 

made, for I was surprised with joy of it; and my 
good steward the captain had laid out the five 
pounds which rny friend had sent him for a pre- 
sent for himself, to purchase, and bring me over a 
servant under bond for six years service, and would 
not accept of any consideration, except a little to- 
bacco, which I would have him accept, being of 
my own produce. 

Neither was this all; but my goods being all 
English manufactures, such as cloth, stuffs, baize, 
and things particularly valuable and desirable in 
the country, I found means to sell them to a very 
great advantage, so that I may say I had more 
than four times the value of my first cargo, and 
was now infinitely beyond my poor neighbour, I 
mean in the advancement of my plantation; for 
the first thing I did, I bought me a negro slave, 
and an European servant also; I mean another 
besides that which the captain brought me from 
Lisbon. 

But as abused prosperity is oftentimes made the 
very mean: of our greatest adversity, so was it 
with me. I went on the next year with great 
success in my plantation: 1 raised fifty great rolls 
of tobacco on my own ground, more than I had 
disposed of for necessaries among my neighbours ; 
and these fifty rolls, being each of above an hun- 
dred weight, were well cured and laid by against 
the return of the fleet from Lisbon. And now,, 
increasing in business and in wealth, my head be- 
gan to be full of projects and undertakings beyond 
my reach ; such as are indeed often the ruin of the 
best heads in this business. 



48 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

Had I continued in the station I was now in, I 
bad room for all the happy things to have yet be- 
fallen me, for which my father so earnestly recom- 
mended a quiet retired life, and of which he had 
so sensibly described the middle station of life to 
be full; but other things attended me, and I was 
still to be the wilful agent of all my own miseries; 
and particularly to increase my fault, and double 
the reflections upon myself, which in my future 
sorrows I should have leisure to make. All these 
miscarriages were procured by my apparent obsti- 
nate adhering to my foolish inclination of wander- 
ing abroad, and pursuing that inclination, in con- 
tradiction to the clearest views of doing myself 
good in a fair and plain pursuit of those prospects 
and those measures of life, which nature and Pro- 
vidence concurred to present me with, and to 
make my duty. 

As I had done thus in breaking away from my 
parents, so I could not be content now, but I must 
go and leave the happy view I had of being a rich 
and thriving man in my new plantation, only to 
pursue a rash and immoderate desire of rising faster 
than the nature of the thing admitted; and thus I 
cast myself down again into the deepest gulph of 
human misery that ever man fell into, or perhaps 
could be consistent with life and a state of health 
in the world. 

To come then by the just degrees to the parti- 
culars of this part of my story; you may suppose, 
that having now lived almost four years in the 
Brasils, and beginning to thrive and prosper very 
weli upon my plantation, I had not only learned 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 49 

the language, but had contracted acquaintance and 
friendship among my fellow-planters, as well as 
among the merchants at St. Salvadore, which was 
our port; and that in my discourse among them. 
I had frequently given them an account of my two 
voyages to the coast of Guinea, the manner of 
trading with the Negroes there, and how easy it 
was to purchase upon the coast, for trifles, such as 
beads, toys, knives, scissars, hatchets, bits of glass, 
and the like, not only gold dust, Guinea grains, 
elephants teeth, &c. but Negroes for the service 
of the Brasils, in great numbers. 

They listened always very attentively to my dis- 
courses on these heads, but especially to that part 
which related to the buying Negroes, which was a 
trade at that time not only not far entered into., 
but as far as it was, had been carried on by the 
Assientos, or permission of the kings of Spain and 
Portugal, and engrossed in the public, so that few 
Negroes were bought, and those excessive dear. 

It happened, being in company with some mer- 
chants and planters of my acquaintance, and talk- 
ing of those things very earnestly, three of them 
came to me the next morning:, and told me thev 
had been musing very much upon what I had dis- 
coursed with them of the last night, and they came 
to make a secret proposal to me; and after enjoin- 
ing me secrecy, they told me, that they had a 
mind to.. fit out a ship to go to Guinea; that they 
had all plantations as well as I, and were strait- 
ened for nothing so much as servants; that as it 
was a trade could not be carried on, because thev 
could not publicly sell the Negroes when they 
VOL. i. e 



50 LIFE AND ADVENTURED 

oame home; so they desired to make but one voy- 
age, to bring the Negroes on shore privately, and 
divide them among their own plantations; and in 
a word, the question was, whether I would go 
their supercargo in the ship, to manage the trading 
part upon the coast of Guinea; and they offered 
me that I should have my equal share of the Ne- 
groes, without providing any part of the stock. 

This was a fair proposal, it must be confessed, 
had it been made to any one that had not had a 
settlement and plantation of his own to look after, 
which was in a fair way of coming to be very con- 
siderable, and with a good stock upon it. But for 
me, that was thus entered and established, and had 
nothing to do but go on as I begun, for three or 
four years more, and to have sent for the other 
hundred pounds from England, and who in that 
time, and with that little addition, could scarce 
have failed of being worth three or four thousand 
pounds sterling, and that increasing too; forme 
to think of such a voyage, was the most prepos- 
terous thing that ever man in such circumstances 
could be guilty of. 

But I, that was born to be my own destroyer, 
could no more resist the offer, than I could restrain 
my first rambling designs, when my father's good 
counsel was lost upon me. In a word, I told them 
I would go with all my heart, if they would under- 
take to look after my plantation in my absence, 
and would dispose of it to such as I should direct 
if I miscarried. This they all engaged to do, and 
entered into writings or covenants to do so; and 
I made a formal will, disposing of my plantation 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 51 

and effects, in case of my death, making the cap- 
tain of the ship that had saved my life as before, 
my universal heir, but obliging him to dispose of 
my effects as I had directed in my will, one half 
of the produce being to himself, and the other to 
be shipped to England. 

In short, I took all possible caution to preserve 
my effects, and keep up my plantation; had I used 
half as much prudence to have looked into my own 
interest, and have made a judgment of what I 
ought to have done, and not to have done, I had 
certainly never gone away from so prosperous an 
undertaking, leaving all the probable views of a 
thriving circumstance, and gone upon a voyage to 
sea, attended with all its common hazards; to ;say 
nothing of the reasons I had to expect particular 
misfortunes to myself. 

But I was hurried on, and obeyed blindly the 
dictates of my fancy rather than my reason : and 
accordingly the ship being fitted out, and the 
cargo furnished, and all things done as by agree- 
ment by my partners in the voyage, I went on 
board in an evil hour, the first of September, being 
the same day eight years that I went from my 
father and mother at Hull, in order to act the rebel 
to their authority, and the fool to my own interest. 

Our ship was about 120 ton burthen, carried 6 
guns, and 14 men, besides the master, his boy and 
myself; we had on board no large cargo of goods, 
except of such toys as were fit for our trade with 
the negroes, such as beads, bits of glass, shells, and 
odd trifles, especially little looking-glasses, knives, 
scissars, hatchets, and the like.

52 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

The same day I went on board we set sail', 
standing away to the northward upon our own 
coast, with design to stretch over for the African 
coast, when they came about 10 or 12 degrees of 
northern latitude, which it seems was the manner 
of their course in those days. We had very good 
weather, only excessive hot, all the way upon our 
own coast, till we came the height of Cape St. 
Augustino; from whence keeping farther off at 
sea we lost sight of land, and steered as if we were 
bound for the isle Fernand de Noronha, holding 
our course N. E. by N. and leaving those isles on 
the east. In this course we passed the line in 
about twelve days time, and were by our last ob- 
servation in 7 degrees 22 min. northern latitude, 
when a violent tornado or hurricane took us quite 
out of our knowledge: it began from the south- 
east, came about to the north-west, and then set- 
tled into the north-east, from whence it blew in 
such a terrible manner, that for twelve days toge- 
ther we could do nothing but drive; and scudding 
away before it, let it carry us whither ever fate 
and the fury of the winds directed; and during 
these twelve days, I need not say that I expected 
every day to be swallowed up, nor indeed did any 
in the ship expect to save their lives. 

In this distress, we had, besides the terror of the 
storm, one of our men died of the calenture, and 
one man and the boy washed over-board. About 
the twelfth day, the weather abating a little, the 
master made an observation as w r eli as he could, 
and found that he was in about 11 degrees north 
latitude, but that he was 22 degrees of longitude 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. S3 

difference west from Cape St Augustino; so that 
he found he was gotten upon the coast of Guinea, 
or the north part of Brasii, beyond the river Ama- 
zones, toward that of the river Oronoque, com- 
monly called the Great River, and began to con- 
sult with me what course he should take, for the 
ship was leaky and very much disabled, and he 
was going directly back to the coast of Brasii. 

I was positively against that; and looking over 
the charts of the sea-coasts of America with him, 
we concluded there was no inhabited country for 
us to have recourse to, till we came within the 
circle of the Caribbee-islands, and therefore re- 
solved to stand away for Barbadoes, which by 
keeping off at sea, to avoid the indraft of the bay 
or gulph of Mexico, we might easily perform, as 
we hoped, in about fifteen days sail; whereas we 
could not possibly make our voyage to the coast 
of Africa without some assistance, both to our ship 
and to ourselves. 

With this design we changed our course, and 
steered away N. W. by W. in order to reach some 
of our English islands, wh€re I hoped for relief; 
but our voyage was otherwise determined; for 
being in the latitude of 12 deg. 18 min. a second 
storm came upon us, which carried us away with 
the same impetuosity westward, and drove us so 
out of the very way of all human commerce, that 
had all our lives been saved, as to the sea, we were 
rather in danger of being devoured by savages 
than ever returning to our country. 

In this distress, the wind still blowing very hard, 
one of our men early in the morning cried out, 



54 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

land! and we had no sooner ran out of the cabin 
to look out, in hopes of seeing whereabouts in the 
.world we were, but the ship struck upon a sand, 
and in a moment, her motion being so stopped, 
the sea broke over her in such a manner, that we 
expected we should all have perished immediately; 
and we were immediately driven into our close 
quarters, to shelter us from the very foam and 
spray of the sea. 

It is not easy for any one, who has not been in 
the like condition, to describe or conceive the con- 
sternation of men in such circumstances: we knew 
nothing where we were, or upon what land it was 
we were driven, whether an island or the main, 
whether inhabited or not inhabited; and as the 
rage of the w T ind was still great, though rather 
iess than at first, we could not so much as hope to 
have the ship hold many minutes without breaking 
in pieces, unless the winds by a kind of miracle 
should turn immediately about In a word, we 
sat looking one upon another, and expecting death 
every moment, and every man acting accordingly 
as preparing for another world, for there was little 
or nothing more for us to do in this: that which 
was our present comfort, and all the comfort we 
had, was, that contrary to our expectation the ship 
did not break yet, and that the master said the 
wind began to abate. 

Now though we found that the wind did a little 
abate, yet the ship having thus struck upon the 
sand, and sticking too fast for us to expect her 
getting off, we were in a dreadful condition indeed, 
and had nothing to do but to think of saving our 



OF -EOBltfSON CRUSOE. 5-5 

lives as well as we could. We had a boat at our 
stern, just before the storm, but she was first staved 
by dashing against the ship's rudder, and in the 
next place she broke away, and either sunk or 
was driven off to sea, so there was no hope from 
her; we had another boat on board, but how to 
get her offinto the sea was a doubtful thing: how- 
ever, there was no room to debate, for we fancied 
the ship would break in pieces every minute, and 
some told us she was actually broken already. 

In this distress, the mate of our vessel lays hold 
of the boat, and with the help of the rest of the 
men, they got her slung over the ship's side, and 
getting all into her, let go, and committed our- 
selves, being eleven in number, to God's mercy, 
and the wild sea; for though the storm was abated 
considerably, yet the sea went dreadful high upon 
the shore, and might well be called, den wild zee, 
as the Dutch call the sea in a storm. 

And now our case was very dismal indeed; for 
we all saw plainly, that the sea went so hig^, that 
the boat could not live, and that we should be in- 
evitably drowned. As to making sail, we had 
none, nor, if we had, could we have done any thing 
with it; so we worked at the oar towards the land, 
though with heavy hearts, like men going to ex- 
ecution: for we all knew, that when the boat came 
nearer the shore, she would be dashed in a thou- 
sand pieces by the breach of the sea. However, 
we committed our souls to God in the most earnest 
manner, and the wind driving us towards the 
shore, we hastened our destruction with our own 
hands, pulling as well as we could towards land- 



56 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

What the shore was, whether rock or sand, 
whether steep or shoal, we knew not; the only 
hope, that could rationally give us the least shadow 
of expectation, was, if we might happen into some 
bay or gulph, or the mouth of some river, where 
by great chance we might have run our boat in, 
or got under the lee of the land, and perhaps made 
smooth water. But there was nothing of this ap- 
peared; but as we made nearer and nearer the 
shore, the land looked more frightful than the sea. 

After we had rowed, or rather driven about a 
league and a half, as we reckoned it, a raging wave, 
mountain-like, came rolling a-stern of us, and 
plainly bade us expect the coup-de-grace. In a 
word, it took us with such a fury, that it overset 
the boat at once; and separating us, as well from 
the boat as from one another, gave us not time 
hardly to say, O God ! for we were all swallowed 
up in a moment. 

Nothing: can describe the confusion of thought 
which I felt when I sunk into the water; for 
though I swam very well, yet I could not deliver 
myself from the waves so as to draw breath, till 
that wave having driven me, or rather carried me 
a vast way on towards the shore, and having spent 
itself, went back, and left me upon the land almost 
drv, but half dead with the water I took in. I had 
so much presence of mind as well as breath left, 
that seeing myself nearer the main land than I ex- 
pected, I got upon my feet, and endeavoured to 
make on towards the land as fast as I could, before 
another wave should return and take me up again. 
But I soon found it was impossible to avoid it; 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 57 

for I saw the sea come after me as high as a great 
hill, and as furious as an enemy which I had no 
means or strength to contend with; my business 
was to hold my breath, and rise myself upon the 
water, if I could : and so by swimming to preserve 
my breathing, and pilot myself towards the shore, 
if possible: my greatest concern now being that 
the sea, as it would carry me a great way towards 
the shore when it came on, might not carry me 
back again with it when it gave back towards the 
sea. 

The wave that came upon me again, buried me 
at once 20 or 30 foot deep in its own body; and I 
could feel myself carried with a mighty force and 
swiftness towards the shore, a very great way; 
but I held my breath, and assisted myself to swim 
still forward with all my might. I was ready to 
burst with holding my breath, when, as I felt my- 
self rising up, so, to my immediate relief, I found 
my head and hauds shoot out above the surface of 
the water; and though it was not two seconds of 
time that I could keep myself so, yet it relieved 
me greatly, gave me breath and new courage. I 
was covered again with water a good while, but 
not so long but I held it out; and finding the 
water had spent itself, and began to return, I struck 
forward against the return of the waves, and felt 
ground again with my feet. I stood still a few 
moments to recover breath, and till the water went 
from me, and then took to my heels, and run with 
what strength I had farther towards the shore. 
But neither would this deliver me from the fury 
of the sea, which came pouring in after me again, 



58 LIFE AND ADTENTURES 

and twice more I was lifted up by the waves and 
carried farwards as before, the shore being very 
flat. 

The last time of these two had well near been 
fatal to me; for the sea having hurried me along 
as before, landed me, or rather dashed me against 
a piece of a rock, and that with such force, as it 
left me senseless, and indeed helpless, as to my 
own deliverance; for the blow taking my side and 
breast, beat the breath as it were quite out of my 
body; and had it not returned again immediately, 
I must have been strangled in the water; but I 
recovered a little before the return of the waves, 
and seeing I should be covered again with the 
water, I resolved to hold fast by a piece of the 
rock, and so to hold my breath, if possible, till the 
wave went back. Now as the waves were not so 
high as at first, being near land, I held my hold 
till the wave abated, and then fetched another run, 
which brought me so near the shore, that the next 
wave, though it went over me, yet did not so swal- 
low me up as to carry me away; and the next run 
I took I got to the main land, where, to my great 
comfort, I clambered up the clifts of the shore, 
and sat me clown upon the grass, free from danger, 
and quite out of the reach of the water. 

I was now landed, and safe on shore, and began 
to look up and thank God that my life was saved 
in a case wherein there was some minutes before 
scarce any room to hope. I believe it is impossi- 
ble to express to the life what the ecstasies and 
transports of the soul are, when it is so saved, as I 
may say, out of the very grave; and I do not won-

<ter now at that custom, viz. that when a malefac- 
tor, who has the halter about his neck, is tied up, 
and just going to be turned off, and has a reprieve 
brought to him : I say, I do not wonder that they 
bring a surgeon with it, to let him blood that very 
moment they tell him of it, that the surprise may 
not drive the animal spirits from the heart, and 
overwhelm him: 

For sudden joys, like griefs, confound at first. 

I walked about on the shore, lifting up my hands 
and my whole being, as I may say, wrapt up in 
the contemplation of my deliverance, making a 
thousand gestures and motions which I cannot 
describe, reflecting upon all my comrades that 
were drowned, and that there should not be one 
soul saved but myself; for, as for them, I never 
saw them afterwards, or any sign of them, except 
three of their hats, one cap, and two shoes that 
were not fellows. 

I cast my eyes to the stranded vessel, when the 
breach and froth of the sea being so big, I could 
hardly see it, it lay so far oif, and considered, Lord ! 
how was it possible I could get on shore! 

After I had solaced my mind with the comfort- 
able part of my condition, I began to look round 
me, to se« what kind, of place I was in, and what 
w T as next to be done; and I soon found my com- 
forts abate, and that, in a word, I had a dreadful 
deliverance: for I was wet, had no clothes to shift 
me, nor any thing either to eat or drink to cpm- 
fort me; neither did I see any prospect before 
me, but that of perishing with hunger, or being 



6(3 LTFE AND ADVENTURES 

devoured by wild beasts: and that which was par- 
ticularly afflicting to me, was, that I had no wea- 
pon either to hunt and kill any creature for my 
sustenance, or to defend myself against any other 
creature that might desire to kill me for theirs: in 
a word, I had nothing about me but a knife, a to- 
bacco pipe, and a little tobacco in a box; this was 
all my provision, and this threw me into terrible 
agonies of mind, that for a while I ran about like 
a mad-man; night coming upon me, I began with 
a heavy heart to consider what would be my lot if 
there were any ravenous beasts in that country, 
seeing at night they always come abroad for their 
prey. 

All the remedy that offered to my thoughts at 
that time, was, to get up into a thick bushy tree 
like a fir, but thorny, which grew near me, and 
where I resolved to sit all night, and consider the 
next day what death I should die, for as yet I saw 
no piospectof life. I walked about a furlong from 
the shore, to see if I could find any fresh water to 
drink, which I did, to my great joy y and having 
drank, and put a little tobacco in my mouth to 
prevent hunger, I went to the tree, and getting 
up into it, endeavoured to place myself so, as that 
if I should sleep I might not fall; and having cut 
me a short stick, like a truncheon, for my defence, 
I took up my lodging, and having been excessively 
fatigued, I fell fast asleep, and slept as comfortably 
as, I believe, few could have clone in my condition, 
and found myself the most refreshed with it that 
I think I ever was on such an occasion. 

When I waked it was broad dav, the weather 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 6} 

clear, and the storm abated, so that the sea did 
not rage and swell as before: but that which sur- 
prised me most, was, that the ship was lifted off 
in the night from the sand where she lay, by the 
swelling of the tide, and was driven up almost as 
far as the rock which I first mentioned, where I 
had been so bruised by the dashing me against it; 
this being within about a mile from the shore 
where I was, and the ship seeming to stand upright 
still, I wished myself on board, that, at least, I 
might save some necessary things for my use. 

When I came down from my apartment in the 
tree, 1 looked about me again, and the first thing 
I found was the boat, which lay as the wind and 
the sea had tossed her, up upon the land, about 
two miles on my right hand : I walked as far as I 
could upon the shore to have got to her, but found 
a neck or inlet of water between me and the boat, 
which was about half a mile broad; so I came 
back for the present, being more intent upon get- 
ting at the ship, where I hoped to find something 
for my present subsistence. 

A little after noon I found the sea very calm r 
and the tide ebbed so far out, that I could come 
within a quarter of a mile of the ship; and here I 
found a fresh renewing of my grief; for I saw 
evidently, that if we had kept on board, we had 
been all safe, that is to say, we had all got safe on 
shore, and I had not been so miserable as to be left 
entirely destitute of all comfort and company, as 
I now was: this forced tears from my eyes again, 
but as there was little relief in that, I resolved, if 
possible, to get to the ship; so I pulled off my 



62 L1FI AND ADVENTURES 

clothes, for the weather was hot to extremity, and 
took the water; but when I came to the ship, my 
difficulty was still greater to know how to get on 
board, for as she lay a-ground, and high out of the 
water, there was nothing within my reach to lay 
Jiold of. I swam round her twice, and the second 
time I spied a small piece of a rope, which I won- 
dered I did not see at first, hang down by the fore- 
chains so low as that with great difficulty I got 
hold of it, and by the help of that rope got up into 
the forecastle of the ship: here I found that the 
ship was bulged, and had a great deal of water in 
her hold, but that she lay so on the side of a bank 
of hard sand, or rather earth, and her stern lay 
lifted up upon the bank, and her head low almost 
to the water; by this means all her quarter was 
free, and all that was in that part was dry; for 
you may be sure my first work was to search and 
to see what was spoiled and what was free: and 
first I found that all the ship's provisions were 
dry, and untouched by the water; and being very 
well disposed to eat, I went to the bread-room and 
filled my pockets with biscuit, and eat it as I went 
about other things, for I had no time to lose. I 
also found some rum in the great cabin, of which 
I took a large dram, and which I had indeed need 
enough of to spirit me for what was before me. 
Now I wanted nothing but a boat to furnish my- 
self with many things which I foresaw would be 
very necessary to me. 

It was in vain to sit still and wish for what was 
not to be had, and this extremity roused my ap- 
plication. We had several spare }ards, and two 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 63 

or three large spars of wood, and a spare top-mast 
or two in the ship; I resolved to fall to work with 
these, and slung as many of them over-board as I 
could manage of their weight, tying every one 
with a rope that they might not drive away; when 
this was done I went down the ship's side, and 
pulling them to me, I tied four of them fast to- 
gether at both ends, as well as I could, in the form 
of a raft, and laying two or three short pieces of 
plank upon them cross-ways, I found I could walk 
upon it very well, but that it was not able to bear 
any great weight, the pieces being too light; so I 
went to work, and with the carpenter's saw I cut 
a spare top-mast into three lengths, and added 
them to my raft, with a great deal of labour and. 
pains: but hope of furnishing myself with neces- 
saries, encouraged me to go beyond what I should 
have been able to have done upon another occasion. 
My raft was now strong enough to bear any 
reasonable weight; my next care was what to load 
it with, and how to preserve what I laid upon it 
from the surf of the sea ; but I was not long con- 
sidering this; I first laid all the planks or boards 
upon it that I could get, and having considered 
well what I most wanted, I first got three of the 
seamen's chests, which I had broken open and 
emptied, and lowered them down upon my raft; 
the first of these I filled with provisions, viz. bread, 
rice, three Dutch cheeses, five pieces of dried goat's 
flesh, which we lived much upon, and a little re- 
mainder of European corn which had been laid by 
for some fowls which we brought to sea with us, 
but the fowls were killed; there had been some 



64* LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

barley and wheat together, but, to my great disap- 
pointment, I found afterwards that the rats had 
eaten or spoiled it all; as for liquors, I found seve- 
ral cases of bottles belonging to our skipper, in 
which were some cordial waters, and in all above 
five or six gallons of rack; these I stowed by 
themselves, there being no need to put them into 
the chest, nor no room for them. While I was 
doing this, I found the tide began to flow, though 
very cairn; and I had the mortification to see my 
coat, shirt, and waistcoat, which I had left on 
shore upon the sand, swim away; as for my 
breeches, which were only linen, and open-kneed, 
I swam on board in them and my stockings: how- 
ever, this put me upon rummaging for clothes, of 
which I found enough, but took no more than I 
wanted for present use, for I had other things 
which my eye was more upon ; as, first, tools to 
work with on shore; and it was after long search- 
ing that I found out the carpenter's chest, which 
was indeed a very useful prize to me, and much 
more valuable than a ship-loading of gold would 
have been at that time: 'I got it down to my raft, 
even whole as it was, without losing time to look 
into it, for I knew in general what it contained. 

My next care was for some ammunition and 
arms: there were two very good fowling-pieces in 
the great cabin, and two pistols; these I secured 
first, with some powder-horns, and a small bag of 
shot, and two old rusty swords: I knew there were 
three barrels of powder in the ship, but knew not 
where our gunner had stowed them; but with 
much search I found them, two of them dry and

good, the third had taken water: those two I got 
to my raft, with the arms; and now I thought 
myself pretty well freighted, and began to think 
how I should get to shore with them, having nei- 
ther sail, oar, or rudder, and the least cap-full of 
wind would have overset all my navigation. 

I had three encouragements: 1. A smooth, calm 
sea: 2. The tide rising and setting into the shore: 
3. What little wind there was, blew me towards 
the land: and thus, having found two or three 
broken oars belonging to the boat, and besides the 
tools which were in the chest, I found two saws, 
an axe and a hammer, and with this cargo I put 
to sea. For a mile, or thereabouts, my raft went 
very well, only that I found it drive a little distant 
from the place where I had landed before, by 
which I perceived that there was some indraft of 
the water, and consequently I hoped to find some 
creek or river there, which I might make use of 
as a port to get to land with my cargo. 

As I imagined, so it was; there appeared before 
me a little opening of the land, and I found a 
strong current of the tide set into it, so I guided 
my raft as well as I could to keep in the middle 
of the stream: but here I had like to have suffered 
a second shipwreck, which, if I had, I think verily 
would have broke my heart; for knowing nothing 
of the coast, my raft run a-ground at one end of 
it upon a shoal, and not being a-ground at the 
other end, it wanted but a little that all my cargo 
had slipped off towards that end that was a float, 
and so fallen into the water. I did my utmost, by 

tting my back against the chests, to keep them 

VOL. I. F 



66 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

in their places, but could not thrust off the raft 
with all my strength, neither durst I stir from the 
posture I was in; but holding up the chests with 
all my might, stood in that manner near half an 
hour, in which time the rising of the water brought 
me a little more upon a level; and a little after, 
the water still rising, my raft floated again, and I 
thrust her off with the oar I had, into the channel; 
and then driving up higher, I at length found my- 
self in the mouth of a little river, with land on 
both sides, and a strong current or tide running 
up: 1 looked on both sides for a proper place to 
get to shore, for I was not willing to be driven 
too high up the river, hoping in time to see some 
ship at sea, and therefore resolved to place myself 
as near the coast as I could. 

At length I spied a little cove on the right shore 
of the creek, to which, with great pain and diffi- 
culty, I guided my raft, and at last got so near, as 
that, reaching ground with my oar, I could thrust 
her directly in; but here I had like to have dipped 
all my cargo in the sea again; for that shore lying 
pretty steep, that is to say sloping, there was no 
place to land, but where one end of the float, if it 
run onshore, would lie so high, and the other sink 
lower as before, that it would endanger my cargo 
again: all that I could do, was to wait till the tide 
was at the highest, keeping the raft with my oar 
like an anchor to hold the side of it fast to the 
shore, near a flat piece of ground, which I expected 
the water would flow over; and so it did. As 
soon as I found water enough (for my raft drevr 
about a foot of water) I thrust her on upon that 



OF ROBINSOIST CRUSOE.' 67 

flat piece of ground, and there fastened or moored 
her by sticking my two broken oars into the 
ground; one on one side near one end, and one on 
the other side near the other end; and thus I lay 
till the water ebbed away, and left my raft and all 
my cargo safe on shore. 

My next work was to view the country, and 
seek a proper place for my habitation, and where 
to stow my goods, to secure them from whatever 
might happen; where I was I yet knew not; 
whether on the continent or on an island, whe- 
ther inhabited or not inhabited, whether in dan- 
ger of wild beasts or not: there was a hill not 
above a mile from me, which rose up very steep 
and high, and which seemed to over-top some 
other hills which lay as in a ridge from it north- 
ward; I took out one of the fowling-pieces, and 
one of the pistols, and an horn of powder, and 
thus armed I travelled for discovery up to the top 
of that hill, where, after I had with great labour 
and difficulty got to the top, I saw mj^fates to 
my great affliction, viz. that I was in an island 
environed every way with the sea, no land to be 
seen, except some rocks which lay a great way 
off, and two small islands less than this, which 
lay about three leagues to the west. 

I found also that the island I was in was bar- 
ren, and, as I saw good reason to believe, unin- 
habited, except by wild beasts, of whom however 
I saw none; yet I saw abundance of fowls, but 
knew not their kinds, neither when I killed them 
could I tell what was fit for food, and what not. 
At my coming back, I shot at a great bird, which 

F % 



68 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

I saw sitting upon a tree on the side of a great 
wood; I believe itrwas the first gun that had been 
fired there since the creation of the world. I had 
no sooner fired, but from all the parts of the wood 
there arose an innumerable number of fowls of 
many sorts, making a confused screaming, and 
crying every one according to his usual note; but 
not one of them of any kind that I knew: as for 
the creature I killed, I took it to be a kind of 
hawk, its colour and beak resembling it, but had 
no talons or claws more than common; its flesh 
was carrion, and fit for nothing. 

Contented with this discovery, E came back to 
my raft, and fell to work to bring my cargo on 
shore, which- took me up the rest of that day; 
and what to do with myself at night I knew not, 
nor indeed where to rest; for 1 was afraid to lie 
down on the ground, not knowing but some wild 
beast might devour me, though, as I afterwards 
found, there was really no need for those fears. 

However, as well as I could, I barricadoed my- 
self round with the chests and boards that I had 
brought on shore, and made a kind of a hut for 
that night's lodging: as* -for food, I yet saw not 
which way to supply myself, except that I had 
seen, two or three creatures, like hares, run out of 
the wood where I shot the fowl. 

I now began to consider, that I might yet get a 
great many things out of the ship, which would 
be useful to me, and particularly some of the rig- 
ging and sails, and such other things as might 
come to land, and I resolved to make another 
voyage on board the vessel, if possible; and as -I 



Of ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

knew that the first storm that blew must necessa- 
rily break her all in pieces, I resolved to set all. 
other things apart, till I got every thing out of 
the ship that I could get: then I called a council, 
that is to say, in my thoughts, whether I should 
take back the raft; but this appeared imprac- 
ticable; so I resolved to go as before, when the 
tide was down, and I did so, only that I stripped 
before I went from my hut, having nothing on 
but a chequered shirt, and a pair of linen trow- 
sers, and a pair of pumps on my feet. 

I got on board the ship, as before, and prepared 
a second raft; and having had experience of the 
first, I neither made this so unwieldv, nor loaded 
it so hard; but yet I brought away several things 
very useful to me; as first, in the carpenter's 
stores, I found two or three bags full of nails and 
spikes, a great screw-jack, , a dozen or two of 
hatchets, and above all, .that most useful thing 
called a grindstone: all these I secured, together 
with several things belonging to the gunner, par- 
ticularly two or three iron crows, and two barrels 
of umsquet-bullets, seven musquets, and another 
fowling-piece, with some small quantity of pow- 
der more; a large bag full of small shot, and a 
great roll of sheet lead; but this last was so heavy, 
I could not hoist it up to get it over the ship's 
side. 

Besides these things, I took all the men's 
clothes that I could find, and a spare fore-top-sail, 
hammock, and some bedding; and with this I 
loaded my second raft, and brought them all safe 
on shore, to my very great comfort. 



70 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

I was under some apprehensions during my ab- 
sence from the land, that at least my provisions 
might be devoured on shore; but when I came 
back, I found no sign of any visitor, only there 
sat a creature like a wild cat upon one of the 
chests, which, when I came towards it, ran away 
a little distance, and then stood still: she sat very 
composed, and unconcerned, and looked full in my 
face, as if she bad a mind to be acquainted with 
me; I presented my gun at her, but as she did 
not understand it, she was perfectly unconcerned 
at it, nor did she offer to stir away; upon which 
I tossed her a bit of biscuit, though by the way 
I was not very free of it, for my store was not 
great: however, I spared her a bit, I say, and she 
went to it, smelled at it, ate it, and looked, as 
pleased, for more; but I thanked he?, and could 
spare no more; so she marched off. 

Having got my second cargo on shore, though I 
was fain to open the barrels of powder, and bring 
them by parcels, (for they were too heavy, being 
large casks,) I went to work to make me a little 
tent with the sail and some poles which I cut for 
that purpose; and into this tent I brought every 
thing that I knew would spoil, either with rain 
or sun, and I piled all the empty chests and casks 
up in a circle round the tent, to fortify it from 
any sudden attempt, either from man or beast. 

When I had done this I blocked up the door of 
the tent with some boards within, and an empty 
chest set up an-end without: and spreading one 
of the beds upon the ground, laying my two pis- 
tols just at my head, and my gun at length by me, 



VF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 71 

I went to bed for the first time, and slept veiy 
quietly all night, for I was very weary and heavy; 
for the night before I had slept little, and had 
laboured very hard all day, as well to fetch all 
those things from the ship, as to get them on 
shore. 

I had the biggest magazine ef all kinds now 7 
that ever were laid up> I believe for one man; but 
I was not satisfied still; for while the ship sat up- 
right in that posture, I thought I ought to get 
every thing out of he]- that 1 could; so every day 
at low water I went on board, and brought awav 
something or other; but particularly the third 
time I went, I brought away as much of the rig- 
ging as I could, as also all the small ropes and rope 
twine I could get, with a pi-ece of spare canvass, 
which was to mend the sails upon occasion, and 
the barrel of wet gun-powder: in a word, I brought 
away all the sails first and last, only that I was 
fain to cut them in pieces, and bring as much at a 
time as I could; for they were no more useful to 
be sails, but as mere canvass only. 

But that which comforted me more still, was ? 
that, last of all, after I had made five or six such 
voyages as these, and thought I had nothing more 
to expect from the ship that was worth my med- 
dling with; I say, after all this, I found a great 
hogshead of bread, and three large runlets of rum 
or spirits, and a box of sugar and a barrel of fine 
flour: this was surprising to me, because I had 
given over expecting any more provisions, except 
what was spoiled by the water : I soon emptied 
the hogshead of that bread, and wrapped it up, 



78 LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF 

parcel by parcel, in pieces of the sails, which I 
cut out : and, in a word, I got all this safe on shore 
also. 

% The next day I made another voyage; and now, 
having plundered the ship of what was portable 
and fit to hand out, I began with the cables; and 
cutting the great cable into pieces, such as I could 
wove, I got two cables and a hawser on shore, 
with ail the iron-work I could get; and having 
cut down the spritsail-yard, and the mizen-yard, 
and every thing I could to make a large raft, I 
loaded it with all those heavy goods, and came 
away: but my good luck began now to leave me; 
for this raft was so unwield} 7 and so overladen, 
that after I was entered the little cave, where I 
had landed the rest of my goods, not being able 
to guide it so handily as I did the other, it overset, 
and threw me and all mv cargo into the water. 
As for myself it was no great harm, for I was near 
the shore; but as to my cargo, it was great part cf 
it lost, especially the iron, which I expected 
would have been of great use to me: however, 
"when the tide was out, I got most of the pieces 
of cable ashore; and some of the iron, though 
with infinite labour; for I was fain to dip for it 
into the water, a work which fatigued me very 
much. After this, I went every day on board, 
and brought away what I could get. 

I had been now 13 days on shore, and had been 
II times on board the ship; in which time I had 
brought away all that one pair of hands could wc'l 
be supposed capable to bring; though I belie\e 
verily, had the calm weather held, I should have

OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 73 

brought away the whole ship, piece by piece; but 
preparing the 12th time to go on board, I found 
the wind began to rise; however at low water I 
went on board, and though I thought I had rum- 
maged the cabin so effectually, as that nothing 
more could be found, yet I discovered a locker 
with drawers in it, in one of which I found two 
or three razors, and one pair of large scissars, with 
some ten or a dozen of good knives and forks; in 
another I found about thirty-six pounds value in 
money, some European coin, some Brasil, some 
pieces of eight, some gold, some silver. 

I smiled to myself at the sight of this money. 
O Drug! said I, aloud, what art thou good for? 
thou art not worth to me, no not the taking off 
of the ground: one of those knives is worth all 
this heap: I have no manner of use for thee, even 
remain where thou art and go to the bottom, as a 
creature whose life is not worth saving. How- 
ever, upon second thoughts, I took it away, and 
wrapping all this in a piece of canvas, I began to 
think of making another raft; but while I was 
preparing this, I found the sky over-cast, and the 
wind began to rise, and in a quarter of an hour it 
blew a fresh gale from the shore. It presently oc- 
curred to me, that it was in vain to pretend to 
make a raft with the wind off shore, and that it 
was my business to be gone before the tide of flood 
began, otherwise I might not be able to reach the 
shore at all: accordingly I let myself down into 
the water, and swam cross the channel, which lay 
between the ship and the sands, and even that 
with difficulty enough, partly with the weight of 



74> LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

things 1 had about me, and partly the roughness 
of the water; for the wind rose very hastily, and 
before it was quite high water it blew a storm. 

But I was gotten home to my little tent, where 
I lay with all my wealth about me very secure. It 
blew very hard all that night; and in the morning 
when I looked out, behold no more ship was to be 
seen: I was a little surprised, but recovered my- 
self with this satisfactory reflection, viz. That I 
had lost no time, nor abated any diligence to get 
every thing out of her that could be useful to me; 
and that indeed there was little left in her that I 
was able to bring away, if I had had more time. 

I now gave over anymore thoughts of the ship, 
or of any thing out of her, except what might 
drive on shore from her wreck, as indeed divers 
pieces of her afterwards did; but those things 
were of small use to me. 

My thoughts were now wholly employed about 
securing myself against either savages (if any 
should appear) or wild beasts, if any were in the 
island; and I had many thoughts of the method 
how to do this, and what kind of dwelling to make ; 
whether I should make me a cave in the earth, or 
a tent upon the earth: and, in short, I resolved 
upon both, of the manner and description of 
which it may not be improper to give an ac- 
count. 

I soon found the place I was in was not for my 
settlement, particularly because it was upon a low 
moorish ground near the sea, and I believed w r ould 
not be wholesome, and more particularly because 
there was no fresh water near it; so I resolved to 



OP ROBINSON CRUSOE. 75 

find a more healthy and more convenient spot of 
ground. 

I consulted several things in my situation which 
I found would be proper for me: 1st, Health, and 
fresh water, I just now mentioned. 2dly, Shelter 
from the heat of the sun. 3dly, Security from 
ravenous creatures, whether man or beast. 4thly, 
A view to the sea; that if God sent any ship in 
sight, I might not lose any advantage for my 
deliverance, of which I was not willing to banish 
all my expectation yet. 

In search of a place proper for this, I found a 
little plain on the side of a rising hill, whose front 
towards this little plain was steep as a house-side, 
so that nothing could come down upon me from 
the top; on the side of this rock there was a hol- 
low place, worn a little way in, like the entrance 
or door of a cave; but there was not really any 
cave or wav into the rock at all. 

On the flat of the green, just before this hollow 
place, I resolved to pitch my tent; this plain was 
not above an hundred yards broad, and about 
twice as long, and lay like a green before my 
door, and at the end of it descended irregularly 
every way down into the low grounds by the sea- 
side. It was on the N.N.W. side of the hill, so 
that I was sheltered from the heat every day, till 
it came to a W. and by S. sun, or thereabouts, 
which in those countries is near the setting. 

Before I set up my tent, I drew a half circle 
before the hollow place, which took in about ten 
yards in its semi-diameter from the rock, and 



■", b LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

twenty yards in its diameter, from its beginning 
and ending. 

In this half circle I pitched two rows of strong 
stakes, driving them into the ground till they stood 
very firm, like piles, the biggest end being out of 
the ground about five foot and a half, and sharp- 
ened on the top; the two rows did not stand above 
six inches from one another. 

Then I took the pieces of cable which I had cut 
in the ship, and laid them in rows one upon an- 
other, within the circle between these two rows 
of stakes, up to the top, placing other stakes in 
the inside, leaning against them, about two foot 
and a half high, like a spur to a post; and this 
fence was so strong, that neither man or beast 
could get into it or over it: this cost me a great 
deal of time and labour, especially to cut the piles 
in the woods, bring them to the place, and drive 
them into the earth. 

The entrance into this place I made to be not 
by a door, but by a short ladder, to go over the 
top; which ladder, when I was in, I lifted over 
after me; and so I was completely fenced in, and 
fortified, as I thought, from all the world, and con- 
sequently slept secure in the night, which other- 
wise I could not have done; though, as it appeared 
afterward, there was no need of all this caution 
from the enemies that I apprehended danger from. 

Into this fence or fortress, with infinite labour, 
I carried all my riches, all my provisions, ammu- 
nition and stores, of which you have the account 
above; and I made me a large tent, which, to pre' 



f""H* 



OP ROBINSON CRUSOE.' 77 

serve me from the rains, that in one part of the 
year are very violent there, I made double, viz. 
one smaller tent within, and one larger tent above 
it, and covered the uppermost with a large tar- 
paulin which I had saved among the sails. 

And now I lay no more for a while in the bed 
which I had brought on shore, but in a hammock, 
which was indeed a very good one, and belonged 
to the mate of the ship. 

Into this tent I brought all my provisions, and 
everything that would spoil by the wet; and hav- 
ing thus enclosed all my goods, I made up the 
entrance, which till now I had left open, and so 
passed and repassed, as 1 said,, by a short ladder. 

When I had done this, I began to work my way 
into the rock; and bringing all the earth and 
stones that I dug down, out through my tent, I 
laid them up within my fence in the nature of a 
terrace, that so it raised the ground within about 
a foot and a half: and thus I made me a cave just 
behind my tent, which served me like a cellar to* 
my house. 

It cost me much labour, and many days, before 
all these things were brought to perfection, and 
therefore I must go back to some other things 
which took up some of my thoughts. At the 
same time it happened, after I had laid my scheme 
for the setting up my tent, and making the cave, 
that a storm of rain falling from a thick dark cloud, 
a sudden flash of lightning happened, and after 
that a great clap of thunder; as is naturally the 
effect of it: I was not so much surprised with the 
lightning, as I was with a thought which darted 



78 LIFE AXD ADVENTURES 

into my mind as swift as the lightning itself: O 
my powder! my very heart sunk within me, when 
I thought, that at one blast all my powder might 
be destroyed: on which, not my defence only, 
but the providing me food, as I thought, entirely 
depended; I was nothing near so anxious about 
my own danger; though had the powder took 
lire, I had never known who had hurt me. 

Such impression did this make upon me, that 
after the storm was over, I laid aside all my works, 
my building, and fortifying, and applied myself 
to make bags and boxes to separate the powder, 
and to keep it a little and a little in a parcel, in 
hope, that whatever might come, it might not all 
take fire at once; and to keep it so apart, that it 
should not be possible to make one part fire an- 
other. I finished this work in about a fortnight; 
and I think, my powder, which in all was about 
240 pounds weight, was divided in not less than a 
hundred parcels : as to the barrel that had been 
wet, I did not apprehend any danger from that, so 
I placed it in my new cave, which in my fancy I 
called my kitchen; and the rest I hid up and 
down in holes among the rocks, so that no wet 
might come to it, marking very carefully where I 
laid it. 

In the interval of time while this was doing, I 
went out once at least every day with my gun, as 
well to divert myself, as to see if I could kill any 
thing fit for food, and, as near as I could, to ac- 
quaint myself with what the island produced. The 
first time I went out I presently discovered that 
there were goats in the island, which was a great 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 79 

satisfaction to me; but then it was attended with 
this misfortune to me, viz, that they were so shy, 
so subtle, and so swift of foot, that it was the most 
difficult thing in the world to come at them; but 
I was not discouraged at this, not doubting but I 
might now and then shoot one, as it soon hap- 
pened; for after I had found their haunts a little, 
I laid wait in this manner for them: I observed, if 
they saw me in the rallies, though they were upon 
the rocks, they would run away as in a terrible 
fright; but if they were feeding in the valleys, 
and I was upon the rocks, they took no notice of 
me: from whence I concluded, that by the posi- 
tion of their optics, their sight was so directed 
downward, that they did not readily see objects 
that were above them : so afterward I took this 
method: I always climbed the rocks first, to get 
above them, and then had frequently a fair mark. 
The first shot I made among these creatures, -I 
killed a she-goat, which had a little kid by her, 
which she gave suck to, which grieved me heartily; 
but when the old one fell, the kid stood stock still 
by her till I came and took her up; and not only 
so, but when I carried the old one with me upon 
my shoulders, the kid followed me quite to my 
enclosure, upon which I laid down the dam, and 
took the kid in my arms, and carried it over my 
pale, in hopes to have bred it up tame, but it would 
not eat, so I was forced to kill it and eat it myself: 
these two supplied me with flesh a great while, for 
I eat sparingly; and saved my provisions (my 
bread especially) as much as possibly I could. 
Having now fixed my habitation, I found it ab- 



80 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

solutely necessary to provide a place to make a 
fire in, and fewel to burn; and what I did for that, 
as also how I enlarged my cave, and what conve- 
niences I made, I shall give a full account of in its 
place: but I must first give some little account of 
myself, and of my thoughts about living, which it 
may well be supposed were not a few. 

I had a dismal prospect of my condition; for as 
I was not cast away upon that island without being 
driven, as is said, by a violent storm quite out of 
the course of our intended voyage, and a great 
way, viz. some hundreds of leagues out of the 
ordinary course of the trade of mankind, I had 
great reason to consider it as a determination of 
Heaven, that in this desolate place, and in this de- 
solate manner, I should end my life. The tears 
would run plentifully down my face when I made 
these reflections, and sometimes I would expostu- 
late with myself, why Providence should thus 
completely ruin his creatures, and render them so 
absolutely miserable, so without help abandoned, 
so entirely depressed, that it could hardly be ra- 
tional to be thankful for such a life. 

But something always returned swift upon me 
to check these thoughts, and to reprove me; and 
particularly one day, walking with my gun in my 
hand by the sea-side, I was very pensive upon the 
subject of my present condition, when reason as 
it were expostulating with me the other way, thus: 
Well, you are in a desolate condition, it is true; 
but pray remember, where are the rest of } r ou~ 
Did not you come eleven of you into the boat ? 
Where are the ten? Why were they not saved and 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 81 

you lost? Why were you singled out? Is it better 
to be here or there? and then I pointed to the 
sea. All evils are to be considered with the good 
that is in them, and with what worse attended 
them. 

Then it occurred to me again, how well I was 
furnished for mv subsistence, and what would have 
been my case if it had not happened, which was 
an hundred thousand to one, that the ship floated 
from the place where she first struck, and was 
driven so near the shore that I had time to get all 
these things out of her: what would have been 
my case if I had been to have lived in the condi- 
tion in which I at first came on shore, without ne- 
cessaries of life or necessaries to supply and pro- 
cure them? Particularly, said I aloud, (though to 
myself) what should I have done without a gun, 
without ammunition, without any tools to make 
any thing, or to work with; without clothes, bed- 
ding, a tent, or any manner of covering: and that 
now I had all these to a sufficient quantity, and 
was in a fair way to provide myself in such a man- 
ner, as to live without my gun when my ammuni- 
tion was spent; so that I had a tolerable view of 
subsisting, without any want, as long as I lived; 
for I considered from the beginning how I should 
provide for the accidents that might happen and 
for the time that was to come, even not only after 
my ammunition should be spent, but even after 
my health or strength should decay. 

I confess I had not entertained any notion of 
my ammunition being destroyed at one blast, I 
mean my powder being blown up by lightning,*

and this made the thoughts of it so surprising to 
me when it lightened and thundered, as I observed 
just now. 

And now being about to enter into a melancholy 
relation of a scene of silent life, such perhaps as 
was never heard -of in the world before, I shall 
take it from its beginning, and continue it in its 
order. It was, by my account, the 30th of Sep- 
, tember, when, in the manner as abovesaid, I first 
set foot upon fhis horrid island, when the sun 
being, to us, in its autumnal equinox, was almost 
just over my head; for I reckoned myself, by ob- 
servation, to be in the latitude of 9 degrees 22 
minutes north of the line. 

After I had been there about ten or twelve days, 
it came into my thoughts, that I should lose my 
reckoning of time for want of books, and pen and 
ink, and should even forget the sabbath days from 
the working days; but to prevent this, I cut it 
with my knife upon a large post in capital letters, 
and making it into a great cross, I set it up on the 
shore where I first landed, viz. I came on shore 
here on the 30th of Sept. I6f)9- Upon the sides 
of this square post, I cut every day a notch with 
my knife, and every seventh notch was as long 
again as the rest, and every first day of the month 
as long again as that long one; and thus I kept 
my calendar, or weekly, monthly, and yearly reck- 
oning of time. 

In the next place we are to observe, that among 
the many things which I brought out of the ship 
in the several voyages, which, as abovementioned, 
I made to it, I got. several things of less value, 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE* 83 

but not all less useful to me, which I omitted setr 
ting down before; as in particular, pens, ink, and 
paper; several parcels in the captain's, mate's, gun- 
ner's, and carpenter's keeping; three or four com- 
passes, some mathematical instruments, dials, per- 
spectives, charts, and books of navigation, all 
which I huddled together, whether I might want 
them or no: also, I found three very good bibles 
which came to me in my cargo from England, and 
which I had packed up among my things; some 
Portugueze books also, and among them two or 
three popish prayer-books, and several other books, 
all which I carefullv secured. And I must not 
forget, that we had in the ship a dog and two cats, 
of whose eminent history I may have occasion to 
.say something in its place; for I carried both the 
cats with me; and as for the dog, he jumped out 
of the ship of himself, and swam on shore to me 
the day after I went on shore with my first cargo, 
and was a trusty servant to me many years; I 
wanted nothing that he could fetch me, nor any 
company that he could make up to me; I only 
wanted to have him talk to me, but that he could 
not do. As I observed before, I found pen, ink 
and paper, and I husbanded them to the utmost; 
and I shall shew, that while my ink lasted, I kept 
things very exact ; but* after that was gone, I 
could not; for I could not make any ink, by any 
means that I could devise. 

And this put me in mind that I wanted many 
things, notwithstanding all that I had amassed to- 
gether; and of these this of ink was one, as also 
spade, pick-axe and shovel, to dig or remove the 

g 2 



84 LtFE AND ADVENTURES 

earth; nfcedles, pins, and thread; as for linen, I 
soon learned to want that without much difficulty. 
This want of tools made every work I did go on 
heavily, and it was near a whole year before I had 
entirely finished my little pale or surrounded ha- 
bitation : the piles or stakes^ which were as heavy 
as I could well lift, were a long time in cutting 
and preparing in the woods, and more by far in 
bringing home; so that I spent sometimes two days 
in cutting and bringing home one of those posts, 
and a third day in driving it into the ground; for 
which purpose I got a heavy piece of wood at 
first, but at last bethought myself of one of the 
iron crows, which however, though I found it, yet 
it made driving those posts or piles very laborious 
and tedious work.' 

But what need I have been concerned at the 
tediousness of any thing I had to do, seeing I had 
time enough to do it in, nor had I any other 
employment if that had been over, at least, that I 
could foresee, except the ranging the island to seek 
for food, which I did more or less every day. 

I now began to consider seriously my condition, 
and the circumstance I was reduced to, and I 
drew up the state of my affairs in writing; not so 
much to leave them to any that were to come 
after me, for I was like to have but few heirs, as 
to deliver my thoughts from daily poring upon 
them, and afflicting my mind; and as my reason 
.began now to master my despondency, I began to 
comfort myself as well as I could, and to set the 
good against the evil, that I might have some- 
thing to distinguish my case from worse; and 



PF ROBINSON CRUSOE. &§ 

I stated it very impartially, like debtor and credi- 
tor, the comforts I enjoyed against the miseries I 
suffered, thus :

and what if I had been 
shipwrecked there ? 

I have no soul to speak But God wonderfully 
to, or relieve me, sent the ship in near 

enough to the shore, that 
I have gotten out so many 
necessary things as will 
either supply my zvants, 
or enable me to supply 
myself even as long as I 
live. 

Upon the whole, here was an undoubted testi- 
mony, that there was scarce any condition in the 
world so miserable, but there was something nega- 
tive or something positive to be thankful for in 
it; and let this stand as a direction from the ex- 
perience of the most miserable of all conditions in 
this world, that we may always find in it some- 
thing to comfort ourselves from, and to set in 
the description of good and evil, on the credit side 
pf the account. 

Having now brought my mind a little to relish 
my condition, and given over looking out to sea, 
to see if I could spy a ship; I say, giving over 
these things, I began to apply myself to accom- 
modate my way of living, and to make things as 
easy to me as I could. 

I have already described my habitation, which 
was a tent under the side of a rock, surrounded 



OF ROBINSOX CRUSOE. %1 

with a strong pale of posts and cables, but I might 
now rather call it a wall, for I raised a kind of 
wall up against it of turfs, about two feet thick 
■on the outside, and after some time, I think it 
was a year and a half, I raised rafters from it, 
leaning to the rock, and thatched or covered it 
with boughs of trees, and such things as I could 
get to keep out the rain, which I found at some 
times of the year very violent. 

I have already observed how I brought all my 
goods into this pale, and into the cave which I 
had made behind me: but I must observe too that 
at first this was a confused heap of goods, which 
as they lay in no order, so they took up all my 
place, I had no room to turn myself; so I set my- 
self to enlarge my cave and works farther into 
the earth; for it was a loose sandy rock, which 
yielded easily to the labour I bestowed on it: and 
so when I found I was pretty safe as to beasts of 
prey, I worked sideways to the right hand into 
the rock; and then, turning to the right again, 
worked quite out, and made me a door to come 
out, on the outside of my pale or fortification. 

This gave me not only egress and regress, as it 
were a back-way to my tent and to my store-house, 
but gave me room to stow my goods, 

And now I began to apply myself to make such 
necessary things as I found I most wanted, parti- 
cularly a chair and a table; for without these I 
was not able to enjoy the few comforts I had in 
the world; I could not write or eat, or do several 
things with so much pleasure without a table. 

So I, went to work; and here I must needs ob- 



88 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

serve, that as reason is .the substance and original 
of the mathematics, so by stating and squaring 
every thing by reason, and by making the most 
rational judgment of things, every man may be in 
time master of every mechanic art. I had never 
handled a tool in my life, and yet in time by la- 
bour, application and contrivance, I found at last 
that I wanted nothing but I could have made it, 
especially if I had had tools; however I made abun- 
dance of things, even without tools, and some 
with no more tools than an adze and a hatchet, 
which perhaps were never made that way before, 
and that with infinite labour; for example, if I 
wanted a board, I had rjo other way but to cut 
down a tree, set it on an edge before me, and hew 
it flat on either side with my axe, till I had 
brought it to be as thin as a plank, and then dub 
it smooth with my adze. It is true, by this me- 
thod I could make but one board out of a whole 
tree, but this I had no remedy for but patience, 
any more than I had for the prodigious deal of time 
and labour which it took me up to make a plank 
or board: but mv time or labour was little worth, 
and so it was as well employed one way as another. 
However, I made me a table and a chair, as I 
observed above, in the first place, and this I did 
out of the short pieces of boards which I brought 
on my raft from the ship: but when I had wrought 
out some boards, as above, I made large shelves, 
of the breadth of a foot and a half one over ano- 
ther, all along one side of my cave, to lay all my 
tools, nails, and iron-work, and in a word, to se- 
parate every thing at large in their places, that I

OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 89 

might come easily at them ; I knocked pieces into 
the wall of the rock to hang my guns and all 
things that would hang up. 

So that had mv cave been to be seen, it looked 
like a general magazine of all necessary things; 
and I had every thing so ready at my hand, that 
it was a great pleasure to me to see all my goods 
in such order, and especially to find my stock of 
all necessaries so great. 

And now it was that J began to keep a journal 
of every day's employment; for indeed at first I 
was in too much a hurry; and not only hurry as 
to labour, but in too much discomposure of mind, 
and my journal would have been full of many dull 
things. For example, I must have said thus: 
Sept. the 30th, after I got to shore, and had 
escaped drowning, instead of being thankful to 
God for my deliverance, having first vomited with 
the great quantity of salt water which was gotten 
into my stomach, and recovering myself a little* I 
ran about the shore, wringing my hands, and beat- 
ing my head and face, exclaiming at my misery, 
and crying out, I was undone, undone; till, tired 
and faint, I was forced to lie down on the ground 
to repose, but durst not sleep for fear of being de- 
voured. 

Some days after this, and after I had been on 
board the ship, and got all that I could out of her, 
yet I could not forbear getting up to the top of a 
little mountain, and looking out to sea in hopes 
of seeing a ship; then fancy at avast distance I 
spied a sail; please myself with the hopes of it; 
and then, after looking steadily till I was almost 



SO LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

blind, lose it quite, and sit down and weep like a 
child, and thus increase my misery by my folly. 

But having gotten over these things in some 
measure, and having settled my household-stuff 
and habitation, made me a table and a chair, and 
all as handsome about me as I could, I began to 
keep my journal, of which I shall here give you 
the copy (though in it will be told all these parti- 
culars over again) as long as it lasted; for having 
no more ink, I was forced to leave it off. 



THE JOURNAL. 

Sept. 30, 1659: 

I poor miserable Robinson Crusoe, being ship- 
wrecked, during a dreadful storm, in the offing, 
came on shore on this dismal unfortunate island, 
which I called the Island of Despair, all the rest 
of the ship's company being drowned, and myself 
almost dead. , 

All the rest of that day I spent in afflicting my- 
self at the dismal circumstances I was brought to, 
viz I had neither food, house, clothes, weapon, or 
place to fly to, and in despair of any relief, saw 
nothing but death before me, either that I should 
be devoured by wild beasts, murdered by savages, 
or starved to death for want of food. At the ap- 
proach of night I slept in a tree, for fear of wild 
creatures, but slept soundly though it rained all 
night. 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 91 

October 1. In the morning I saw to my great 
surprise, the ship had floated with the high tide, 
and was driven on shore again much nearer the 
island, which as it was some comfort on one hand, 
for seeing her sit upright, and not broken to 
pieces, 1 hoped, if the wind abated, I might get 
on board, and get some food or necessaries out of 
her for my relief; soon the other hand, it renewed 
my grief at the loss of my comrades, who I ima- 
gined if we had all staid on board might have saved 
the ship, or at least that they would not have 
been all drowned, as they were; and that, had the 
men been saved, we might perhaps have built us 
a boat out of the ruins of the ship, to have carried 
us to some other part of the world. I spent great 
part of this day in perplexing myself on these 
things; but at length, seeing the ship almost dry, 
I went upon the sand as near as I could, and then 
swam on board; this day also it continued raining, 
though with no wind at all. 

From the 1st of October to the 24th. All these 
days entirely spent in making several voyages to 
get all I could out of the ship, which I brought 
on shore, every tide of flood, upon rafts. Much 
rain also in these days, though with some intervals 
of fair weather: but, it seems, this was the rainy 
season. 

Oct. 20. I overset my raft, and all the goods 
I had got up upon it: but being in shoal water, 
and the things being chiefly heavy, I recovered 
many of them when the tide was out. 

Oct. 2.5. It rained all night and all day, with 
some gusts of wind, during which time die ship 



92 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

broke in pieces, the wind blowing a little harder 
than before, and was no more to be seen, except 
the wreck of her, and that only at low water* I 
spent this day in covering and securing the goods 
which I had saved, that rain might not spoil 
them. 

Oct. 26\ I walked about th$ shore almost all 
day, to find out a place to fix my habitation, 
greatly concerned to secure myself from any at- 
tack in the night, either from wild beasts or men. 
Towards night I fixed upon a proper place under 
a rock, and marked out a semi-circle for my en- 
campment, which I resolved to strengthen with a 
work, wall, or fortification made of double piles, 
lined within with cable, and without with turf. 
- From the %6xh to the 30th, I worked very hard 
in carrying all my goods to my new habitation, 
though some part of the time it rained exceeding 
hard. 

The 31st, in the morning, I went out into the 
island with my gun, to see for some food, and dis- 
cover the country; when I killed a she-goat, and 
her kid followed me home; which I afterwards 
killed also, because it would not feed. 

November i. I set up my tent under a rock, 
and lay there for the first night, making it as large 
as I could with stakes driven in to swing my ham- 
mock upon. 

Nov. 2. I set up all my chests and boards, and 
the pieces of timber which made my rafts, and with 
them formed a fence round me, a little within the 
place I had marked out for my fortification. 

Nov. 3. I went out with my gun, and killed 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 93 

two fowls like ducks, which were very good 
food. In the afternoon went to work to make me 
a table. 

Nov. 4. This morning I began to order my 
times of work, of going out with my gun, time of 
sleep, and time of diversion; viz. every morning 
I walked out with my gun for two or thre hours, 
if it did not rain, then employed myself to work 
till about eleven o'clock, then eat what I had to 
live on, and from twelve to two I lay down to 
sleep, the weather being excessive hot, and then 
in the evening to work again : the working part 
of this day, and of the next, were wholly em- 
ployed in making my table, for I was yet but a 
very sorry workman, though time and necessity 
made me a complete natural mechanic soon after, 
as I believe it would do any one else. 

Nov. 5. This day went abroad with my gun 
and my dog, and killed a wild cat, her skin pretty 
soft, but her flesh good for nothing: every crea- 
ture I killed I took off the skins and preserved 
them. Coming back by the sea-shore I saw many 
sorts of sea-fowls, which I did not understand; 
but was surprised and almost frighted with two or 
three seals, which, while I was gazing at, not 
well knowing what they were, got into the sea, 
and escaped me for that time. 

Nov. 6. After my morning walk I went to work 
with my table again, and finished it, though ntft 
to m'y liking: nor was it long before I learned to 
mend it. 

Nov. 7. Now it began to be settled fair wea~ 
ther. The 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, and part of the 



94 LI*£ AND ADVENTURES 

12th, (for the 1 1 tli was Sunday) I took whdiy up 
to make me a chair, and with much ado brought 
it to a tolerable shape, but never to please me; 
and even in the making I pulled it in pieces several 
times. Note, I soon neglected my keeping Sun- 
days, for omitting my mark for them on my post, 
I forgot which was which. 

Nov. 13. This day it rained, which refreshed 
me exceedingly, and. cooled the earth, but it was 
accompanied with terrible thunder and lightning, 
which frighted me dreadfully for fear of my pow- 
der: as soon as it was over I resolved to separate 
my stock of powder into as many little parcels as 
possible, that it might not be in danger. 

Nov. 14, 15, 16. These three days I spent in 
making little square chests or boxes, which might 
hold about a pound, or two pounds, at most, of 
powder; and so putting the powder in, I stowed 
it in places as' secure and remote from one another 
as possible. On one of these three days I killed a 
large bird that was good to eat, but I knew not 
what to call it. 

Nov. 17. 'This day I began to dig behind my 
tent into the rock, to make room for my farther 
conveniency. Note, three things I wanted ex- 
ceedingly for this work, viz. a pick-axe, a shovel, 
and a wheel-barrow or basket, so I desisted from 
my work, and began to consider how to supply 
that want, and make me some tools: as for a 
pick-axe, I made use of the iron crows, which 
were proper enough, though heavy; but the next 
thing w T as a shovel or spade ; this was so absolutely 
.necessary, that- indeed I could do nothing eftec 



OF ROBINSON CItUSOE. 95. 

tually without it; but what kind of one to make 
I knew not. 

Nov. 18. The next day, in searching the woods 
I found a tree of that wood, or like it, which in 
the Brasils they call the Iron Tree, for its exceed- 
ing hardness; of this, with great labour and almost 
spoiling my axe, I cut a piece, and brought it 
home too with difficulty enough, for it was ex- 
ceeding heavy. 

The excessive hardness of the wood, and having 
no other way, made me a long while upon this ma- 
chine; for I worked it effectually by little and 
little into the form of a shovel or spade, the handle 
exactly shaped like ours in England, only that the 
broad part having no iron shod upon it at bottom, 
it would not last me so long; however it served 
well enough for the uses which I had occasion to 
put it to; but never was a shovel, I believe, made 
after that fashion, or so long a making. 

I was still deficient, for I wanted a basket or a 
wheel-barrow: a basket I could not make by any 
means, having no such things as twigs that would 
bend to make wicker ware, at least none yet found 
out; and as to a wheel-barrow, I fancied I could 
nmke all but the wheel, but that I had no notion 
of, neither did I know how to go about it; besides, 
I had no possible way to make the iron gudgeons 
for the spindle or axis of the wheel to run in, so I 
gave it over; and so for carrying aw T ay the earth 
which I dug out of the cave, I made me a thing 
like a hod which the labourers carry mortar in; 
when they serve the bricklayers. . 



96 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

This was not so difficult to me as the making the 
shovel; and yet this, and the shovel, and the at- 
tempt which I made in vain to make a wheelbarrow, 
took me up no less than four days, I mean always 
excepting my morning walk with my gun, which 
I seldom failed ; and very seldom failed also bring- 
ing home something to eat. 

Nov. 23. My other work having now stood still, 
because of my making these tools, when they were 
finished I went on, and working every day, as my 
strength and time allowed, I spent eighteen days 
entirely in widening and deepening my cave, that 
it might hold my goods commodiously. 

Note, During all this time, I worked to make 
this room or cave spacious enough to accommodate 
me as a warehouse or magazine, a kitchen, a dining- 
room, and a cellar; as for my lodging, I kept to 
the tent, except that sometimes in the wet season 
of the year, it rained so hard that I could not keep 
myself dry, which caused me afterwards to cover 
all my place within my pale with long poles in the 
form of rafters, leaning against the rock, and load 
them with flags and large leaves of trees like a 
thatch. 

December 10. I began now to think my cave 
or vault finished, when on a sudden (it seems I had 
made it too large) a great quantity of earth fell 
down from the top and one side, so much that in 
short it frighted me, and not without reason too; 
for if I had been under it I had never wanted a- 
grave-digger: upon this disaster I had a great deal 
#£ work to do over again; for I had the lpose earth

to carry out, and, which was of more importance, 
I had the deling to prop up, so that I might be 
sure no more would come down. 

Dec. 11. This day I went to work with it ac- 
cordingly, and got two shores or posts pitched up- 
right to the top, with two pieces of boards across 
over each post; this I finished the next day; and 
setting more posts up with boards, in about a week 
more I had the roof secured; and the posts, stand- 
ing in rows, served me for partitions to part off 
my house. 

Dec. 17. From this day to the twentieth I 
placed shelves, and knocked up nails on the posts 
to hang every thing up that could be hung up ; 
and now I began to be in some order within doors. 

Dec. 20. Now I carried everv thins into the 
cave, and began to furnish my house, and set up 
some pieces of boards, like a dresser, to order my 
victuals upon; but boards began to be very scarce 
with me: also I made me another table. 

Dec. 24. Much rain all night and all day; no 
stirring out. 

Dec. 2.5. Rain all clay. 

Dec. 26, No rain, and the earth much cooler 
than before, and pleasanter. 

Dec. 27. Killed a young goat, and lamed an- 
other, so that I caught it, and led it home in a 
string; when I had it home, I bound and splin- 
tered up its leg, which was broke. N. B. I took 
such care of it, that it lived, and the leg grew well 
and as strong as ever; but by nursing it so long it 
grew tame, and fed upon the little green at my 
door, and would not go away: this was the first 

VOL. I. H 



98 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

time that I entertained a thought of breeding up- 
some tame creatures, that I might have food when 
my powder and shot was all spent. 

Dec. £8, 29, 30. Great heats and no breeze: 
so that there was no stirring abroad, except in the 
evening for food: this time I spent in putting all 
my things in order within doors. 

January I. Very hot still, but I went abroad 
early and late with my gun, and lay still in the 
middle of the day. This evening, going farther 
into the valleys, which lay towards the centre of 
the island, I found there was plenty of goats, 
though exceeding shy and hard* to come at; how- 
ever I resolved to try if I could not bring my dog 
to hunt them down. 

Jan. 2. Accordingly, the next day, I went out 
with my dog, and set him upon the goats; but I 
was mistaken, for they all faced about upon the 
dog; and he knew his danger too well, for he 
would not come near them. 

Jan. 3. I began my fence or wall; which, being 
still jealous of my being attacked by somebody, I 
resolved to make very thick and strong. 

N. B. This wall being described before, I 
purposely omit what was said in the Jour- 
nal; it is sufficient to observe, that I was 
no less time than from the 3d of January 
to the 14th of April, working, finishing, 
and perfecting this wall, though it was 
no more than about 24 yards in length, 
being a half circle from one place in the 
rock to another place about eight yards 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 99 

from it, the door of the cave being in 

the centre behind it. 
All this time I worked very hard, the rains hin- 
dering me many days, nay, sometimes weeks toge- 
ther; but I thought I should never be perfectly 
secure until this wall was finished; and it is scarce 
credible what inexpressible labour every thing was 
done with, especially the bringing piles out of the 
woods, and driving them into the ground, for I 
made them much bigger than I need to have done. 
When this wall was finished, and the outside 
double fenced with a turf-wall raised up close to 
it, I persuaded, myself that if any people were to 
come on shore there, they would not perceive any 
thing like a habitation; and it was very well I did 
so, as may be observed hereafter upon a very re- 
markable occasion. 

During this time I made mv rounds in the woods 
for game every day, when the rain admitted me, 
and made frequent discoveries in these walks of 
something or other to my advantage; particularly 
I found a kind pf wild pigeons, who built not as 
wood pigeons, in a tree, but rather as house pigeons, 
in the holes of the rocks; and taking some young 
ones, I endeavoured to breed them up tame, and 
did so; but when they grew older they flew away, 
which perhaps was at first for want of feeding 
them, for I had nothing to give them ; however I 
frequently found their nests, and got their young 
ones, which were very good meat. 

And now, in the managing my household affairs, 
I found myself wanting in many things, which I 
thought at first it was impossible for me to make, 

ii 2 



!00 LTFE AJTD ADVENTURES OF 

as indeed, as to some cf them, it was; for instance, 
I could never make a cask to be hooped: I had a 
small runlet or two, as I observed before, but I 
could never arrive to the capacity of making one 
by them, though I spent many weeks about it; I 
could neither put in the heads, or joint the staves 
so true to one another as to make them hold water; 
so I gave that also over. 

In the next place, I was at a great loss for can- 
dle; so that as soon as ever it was dark, which 
was generally by seven o'clock, I was obliged to 
go to bed: I remembered the lump of bees-wax 
with which I made candies in my African adven- 
ture, but I had none of that now; the only remedy 
I had, was, that when I had killed a goat I saved 
the tallow, and with a little dish made of clay, 
which I baked in the sun, to which I added a wick 
of some oakum, I made me a lamp ; and this gave 
me light, though not a clear steady light like a 
candle. In the middle of all my labours it hap- 
pened, that rummaging my things, I found a little 
bag, which, as I hinted before, had been filled with 
corn for the feeding of poultry — not for this voy- 
age, but before, as I suppose, when the ship came 
from Lisbon; what little remainder of corn had 
been in the bag, was all devoured with the rats, 
and I saw nothing in the bag but husks and dust; 
and being willing to have the bag for some other 
use, I think it was to put powder in, when I di- 
vided it for fear of the lightning, or some such 
use, I shook the husks of corn out of it on one side 
of my fortification under the rock. 

It was a little before the great rains, just now 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. TCI 

mentioned, that I threw this stuff away ? taking no 
notice of any thing, and not so much as remem- 
bering that I had thrown any thing there; when 
about a month after, or thereabout, I saw some 
few stalks of something green shooting out of the 
ground, which I fancied might be some plant I 
had not seen; but I was surprised and perfectly 
astonished, when after a little longer time I saw 
about ten or twelve ears come out, which were 
perfect green barley of the same kind as our Euro- 
pean, nay, as our English barley. 

It is impossible to express the astonishment and 
confusion of my thoughts on this occasion; I had 
hitherto acted upon no religious foundation at all; 
indeed I had very few notions of religion in my 
head, or had entertained any sense of any thing 
that had befallen me, otherwise than as a chance, 
or, as we lightly say, what pleases God; without 
so much as inquiring into the end of Providence 
in these things, or his order in governing events 
in the world; but after I saw barley grow there, 
in a climate which I knew was not proper for corn, 
and especially that I knew not how it came there, 
it startled me strangely; and I began to suggest, 
that God had miraculously caused this grain to 
grow without any help of seed sown, and that it 
was so directed purely for my sustenance on that 
wild miserable place. \ 

This touched my heart a little, and brought 
tears out of my eyes, and I began to bless myself, 
that such a prodigy of nature should happen upon 
my account; and this was the more strange to me, 
because I saw near it still, all along by the side of 



102 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

the rock, some other straggling stalks, which 
proved to be stalks of rice, and which I knew, be- 
cause I had seen it grow in Africa, when I was 
ashore there. 

I not only thought these the pure productions 
of Providence for my support, but not doubting 
but that there was more in the place, I went all 
over that part of the island, where I had been be- 
fore, peeping in every corner and under every rock 
to see for more of it, but I could not find any; at 
last it occurred to my thought, that I had shook 
a bag of chickens meat out in that place, and then 
the wonder began to cease; and I must confess, 
my religious thankfulness to God's providence 
began to abate too, upon discovering that all this 
was nothing but what was common; though I 
ouo*ht to have been as thankful for so strange and 
unforeseen a providence as if it had been miracu- 
lous; for it was really the work of Providence as 
to me, that should order or appoint ten or twelve 
grains of corn to -remain unspoiled, when the rats 
had destroyed all the rest, as if it had been dropped 
from heaven: as also, that I should throw it out 
in that particular place, where, it being in the 
shade of a high rock, it sprang up immediately; 
whereas if I had thrown it any where else at that 
time^ it had been burnt up and destroyed. 

I carefully saved the ears of corn, you may be 
sure, in their season, which was about the end of 
June, and laying up every corn, I resolved to sow 
them all again, hoping in time to have some quan- 
tity sufficient to supply me with bread ; but it was 
not till the fourth year that I could allow myself 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 103 

the least grain of this corn to eat, and even then 
but sparingly, as I shall say afterwards in its order; 
for I lost all that I sowed the first season, by not 
observing the proper time; for I sowed it just be- 
fore the dry season, so that it never came up at all, 
at least not as it would have done: of which in 
its place. 

Besides this barley, there were, as above, twenty 
or thirty stalks of rice, which I preserved with the 
same care, and whose use was of the same kind or 
to the same purpose, viz. To make me bread, or 
rather food; for I found ways to cook it up with- 
out baking, though I did that also after some time. 
But to return to my journal 

I worked excessive hard these three or four 
months to get my wall done; and the 14th of 
April I closed it up, contriving to go into it, not 
by a door, but over the wall by a ladder, that there 
might be no sign in the outside of my habitation. 

April 16. I finished the ladder, so I went up 
with the ladder to the top, and then pulled it up 
after me, and let it down on the inside: this was 
a complete enclosure to me; for within I had room 
enough, and nothing could come at me from with- 
out, unless it could first mount my wall. 

The very next day after this wall was finished, 
I had almost had all my labour overthrown at once, 
and myself killed; the case was thus: As I was* 
busy in the inside of it, behind my tent, just in 
the entrance into my cave, I was terribly frighted 
with a most dreadful surprising thing indeed; for 
on a sudden I found the earth come crumbling- 
down from the roof of my cave, and from the edge 



104 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

of the hill, over my head, and two of the posts I 
had set up in the cave cracked in a frightful man- 
ner: I was heartily scared, but thought nothing 
of what was really the cause, only thinking that 
the top of my cave was failing in, as some of it had 
done before; and for fear I should be buried in it, 
I ran forward to my ladder; and not thinking my- 
self safe there neither, I got over my wall for fear 
of the pieces of the hill which 1 expected might 
roll down upon me: I was no sooner stepped down 
upon the firm ground, but I plainly saw it was a 
terrible earthquake, for the ground I stood on 
shook three times at about eight minutes distance, 
with three such shocks, as would have overturned 
the strongest building that could be supposed to 
have stood on the earth ; and a great piece of the 
top of a rock, which stood about half a mile from 
me next the sea, fell down with such a terrible 
noise as I never heard in all my life: I perceived 
also the very sea was put into violent motion by 
it; and I believe the shocks were stronger under 
the water than on the island. 

I was so amazed with the thing itself, having 
never felt the like, or discoursed with any one that 
had, that I was like one dead or stupified; and 
the motion of the earth made my stomach sick, 
like one that was tossed at sea; but the noise of 
the falling of the rock awaked me, as it were, and 
rousing me from the stupified condition I was in, 
filled me with horror, and I thought of nothing 
then but the hill falling upon my tent, and all my 
household goods, and burying all at once; and this 
sunk my very soul within me a second time. 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 105 

After the third shock was over, and I felt no 
more for some time, I began to take courage, and 
yet I had not heart enough to get over my wall 
again, for fear of being buried alive, but sat still 
upon the ground, greatly cast down and disconso- 
late, not knowing what to do: all this while I had 
not the least serious religious thought, nothing 
but the common, Lord have mercy upon me; and 
when it was over, that went away too. 

While I sat thus, I found the air overcast, and 
grow cloudy, as if it would rain; soon after that 
the wind rose by little and little, so that in less 
than half an hour it blew a most dreadful hurri- 
cane: the sea was all on a sudden covered over 
with foam and froth, the shore was covered with 
the breach of the water, the trees were torn up by 
the roots, and a terrible storm it was; and this 
held about three hours, and then began to abate, 
and in two hours more it was stark calm, and began 
to rain very hard. 

All this while I sat upon the ground, very much 
terrified and dejected, when on a sudden it came 
into my thoughts, that these winds and rain being 
the consequence of the earthquake, the earthquake 
itself was spent and over, and I might venture 
into my cave again: with this thought my spirits 
began to revive, and the rain also helping to per- 
suade me, I went in and sat down in mv tent, but 
the rain was so violent, that my tent was ready to 
be beaten down with it; and I was forced to go 
into my cave, though very much afraid and uneasy, 
for fear it should fall on my head. 

This violent rain forced me to a new work, viz. 



IQf> LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

to cut a hole through my new fortification like a 
sink to let water go out^-which would else have 
drowned my cave. After I had been in my cave 
some time, and found still no more shocks of the 
earthquake follow, I began to be more composed; 
and now, to support my spirits, which indeed 
wanted it very much, I went to my little store, 
and took a small sup of rum, which however I did 
then, and always, very sparingly, knowing I could 
have no more when that was gone. 

It continued raining all that night, and great 
part of the next day, so that I could not stir 
abroad; but my mind being more composed, I 
began to think of what I had best do, concluding, 
that if the island was subject to these earthquakes, 
there would be no living for me in a cave, but I 
must consider of building me some little hut in an 
open place, which I might surround with a wall 
as I had done here, and so make myself secure 
From wild beasts or men: but concluded, if I staid 
where I was, I should certainly, one time or other, 
be buried alive. 

With these thoughts I resolved to remove my 
tent from the place where it stood, which was just 
under the hanging precipice of the hill, and which, 
if it should be shaken again, would certainly fall 
upon my tent : and I spent the two next days, 
being the 19th and 20th of April, in contriving 
where and how to remove my habitation. 

The fear of being swallowed up alive, made me 
that I never slept in quiet; and yet the apprehen- 
sion of lying abroad, without any fence, was almost 
equal to it; but still, when I looked about and saw 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 107 

how every thing was put in order, how pleasantly 
concealed I was, and how safe from danger, it 
made me very loth to remove. 

In the mean time it occurred to me that it 
would require a vast deal of time for me to do this, 
and that I must be contented to run the venture 
where I was, till I had formed a camp for myself, 
and had secured it so as to remove to it; so with 
this resolution I composed myself for a time, and 
resolved that I would go to work with all speed to 
build me a wall with piles and cables, &c. in a 
circle as before; and set my tent up in it when it 
was finished, but that I would venture to stay 
where I was till it was finished and fit to remove 
to. This was the 21st. 

April 22. The next morning I began to consi- 
der of means to put this resolve in execution, but 
I was at a great loss about my tools ; I had three 
large axes and abundance of hatchets, (for we 
carried the hatchets for traffick with the Indians) 
but with much chopping and cutting knotty hard 
wood, they were all full of notches and dull, and 
though I had a grind-stone, I could not turn it and 
grind my tools too: this cost me as much thought 
as a statesman would have bestowed upon a grand 
point of politics, or a judge upon the life and death 
of a man. At length I contrived a wheel with a 
siring, to turn it with my foot, that I might have 
both my hands at liberty. Note, I had never seen 
any such thing in England, or at least not to take 
notice how it was done, though since I have ob- 
served it is very common there; besides that, my 
grind-stone was very large and heavy. This ma- 



108 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

chine cost me a full week's work to bring it to 
perfection. 

April £8, 29. These two whole days I took up 
in grinding my tools, my machine for turning my 
grind-stone performing very well. 

April 30. Having perceived my bread had been 
low a great while, now I took a survey of it, and 
reduced myself to one biscuit cake a day, which 
made my heart very heavy. 

May 1. In the morning, looking towards the 
sea-side, the tide being low, I saw something lie 
on the shore bigger than ordinary; and it looked 
like a cask. When I came to it, I found a small 
barrel, and two or three pieces of the wreck of 
the ship, which were driven on shore by the late 
hurricane; and looking towards the wreck itself, 
I thought it seemed to lie higher out of the water 
than it used 6 to do: I examined the barrel which 
was driven on shore, and soon found it was a 
barrel of gunpowder, but it had taken water, and 
the powder was caked as hard as a stone; however 
I rolled it farther on shore for the present, and 
went on upon the sands as near as I could to the 
wreck of the ship, to look for more. 

When I came down to the ship, I found it 
strangely removed ; the fore-castle, which lay be- 
fore buried in sand, was heaved up at least six 
foot; and the stern, which was broke to pieces, 
and parted from the rest by the force of the sea, 
soon after I had left rummaging her, was tossed, 
as it were, up, and cast on one side, and the sand 
was thrown so high on that side next her stern, that 
whereas there was a great place of water before, 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 10.0 

so that I could not come within a quarter of a 
mile of the wreck without swimming, I could now 
walk quite up to her when the tide was out. I was 
surprised with this at first, but soon concluded it 
must be done by the earthquake: and as by this 
violence the ship was more broken open than for- 
merly, so many things came daily on shore, which 
the sea had loosened, and which the winds and 
water rolled by degrees to the land. 

This wholly diverted my thoughts from the de- 
sign of removing my habitation; and I busied my- 
self mightily that day especially, in searching 
whether I could make any way into the ship; but 
I found nothing was to be expected of that kind, 
for that all the inside of the ship was choaked up 
with sand: however, as I had learnt not to despair 
of any thing, I resolved to pull every tiling to 
pieces that I could of the ship, concluding, that 
every thing I could get from her would be of some 
use or other to me. 

May 3. I began with my saw, and cut a piece 
of a beam through, which I thought held some 
of the upper part or quarter-deck together; and 
when I had cut it through, I cleared away the 
sand as well as I could from the side which lay 
highest; but the tide coming in, I was obliged to 
give over for that time. 

May 4. I went a fishing, but caught not one 
fish that I durst eat of, till I was weary of my 
sport; when just going to leave off, I caught a 
young dolphin. I had made me a long line of some 
rope yarn, but I had no hooks, yet I frequently 



110 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

caught fish enough, as much as I cared to eat; all 
which I dried in the sun, and eat them dry. 

May 5. Worked on the wreck, cut another 
beam asunder, and brought three great fir planks 
off from the decks, which I tied together, and 
made swim on shore when the tide of flood came 
on. 

May 6. Worked on the wreck, got several iron 
bolts out of her, and other pieces of iron-work; 
worked very hard, and came home very much 
tired, and had thoughts of giving it over. 

May 7. Went to the wreck again, but with an 
intent not to work, but found the weight of the 
wreck had broke itself down, the beams being 
cut, that several pieces of the ship seemed to lie 
loose; and the inside of the hold lay so open, that 
I could see into it, but almost full of water and 
sand. 

May 8. W T ent to the wreck, and carried an iron 
crow to wrench up the deck, which lay now 
quite clear of the water or sand; I wrenched open 
two planks, and brought them on shore also with 
the tide: I. left the iron crow in the wreck for 
next day. 

May 9- Went to the wreck, and with the crow 
made way into the body of the wreck, and felt 
several casks, and loosened them with the crow, 
but could not break them up; I felt also the roll of 
English lead, and eould stir it, but it was too 
heavy to remove. 

May 10, 1 1, 12, 13, 14. Went every day to the 
wreck, and got a great many pieces of timber, 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. Ill 

and boards, or plank, and two or three hundred 
weight of iron. 

May 15. I carried two hatchets, to try if I 
could not cut a piece off the roll of lead, by 
placing the edge of one hatchet, and driving it 
with the other; but as it lay about a foot and a 
half in the water, I could not make any blow to 
drive the hatchet. 

May 16\ It had blowed hard in the night, and 
the wreck appeared more broken by the force of 
the water; but I staid so long in the woods to get 
pigeons for food, that the tide prevented me going 
to the wreck that day. 

May 17. I saw some pieces of the wreck blown 
on shore, at a great distance, near two miles off 
me, but resolved to see what they were, and found 
it was a piece of the head, but too heavy for me 
to bring away. 

May 24. Every day to this day I worked on 
the wreck, and with hard labour I loosened some 
things so much with the crow, that the first blow- 
ing tide several casks floated out, and two- of the 
seamen's chests; but the wind blowing from the 
shore, nothing came to land that day but pieces 
of timber, and a hogshead, which had some Bra- 
zil pork in it, but the salt water and the sand had 
spoiled it. 

I continued this work every day to the 15th of 
June, except the time necessary to get food, which 
I always appointed, during this part of my employ- 
ment, to be when the tide was up, that I might 
be ready when it was ebbed out; and by this time 
I had gotten timber, and plank, and iron- work 



1 12 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

enough to have built a good boat, if I had known 
how; and also, I got at several times, and in seve- 
ral pieces, near 100 weight of the sheet-lead. 

June' 16. Going down to the sea side, I found 
a large tortoise or turtle; this was the first I had 
seen, which it seems was only my misfortune, not 
any defect of the place, or scarcity; for had I 
happened to be on the other side of the island, I 
might have had hundreds of them every day; as I 
found afterwards; but perhaps had paid dear 
enough for them. 

June 17. I spent in cooking the turtle; I found 
in her threescore eggs ; and her flesh was to me at 
that time the most savoury and pleasant that ever 
I tasted in my life, having had no flesh, but of 
goats and fowls, since I landed in this horrid 
place. 

June 18. Rained all dav, and I staved within. 
I thought at this time the rain felt cold, and I was 
something chilly, which I knew was not usual in 
that latitude. 

June 19. Very ill, and shivering, as if the wea- 
ther had been cold. 

June 20. No rest all night, violent pains m 
my head, and feverish. 

June 21. Very ill, frighted almost to death 
with the apprehensions of my sad condition, to be 
sick and no help: Prayed to God for the first 
time since the storm off Hull, but scarce knew 
what I said, or why; my thoughts being all con- 
fused. 

June 22. A little better, but under dreadful 
apprehensions of sickness. 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 1 l5 

June 25. Very bad again, cold and shivering, 
and then a violent head-ach. 

June 24. Much better. 

June 25. An ague very violent; the fit held 
me seven hours, cold fit and hot, with faint sweats 
after it. 

June 26. Better; and having no victuals to eat, 
took my gun, but found myself very weak; how- 
ever I killed a she-goat, and with much difficulty 
got it home, and broiled some of it, and eat; I 
would fain have stewed it, and made some broth, 
but had no pot. 

June 27. The ague again so violent, that I lay 
a-bed all day, and neither eat or drank. I was 
ready to perish for thirst, but so weak I had not 
strength to stand up, or to get myself any water 
to drink: prayed to God again, but was light- 
headed; and when I was not, I was so ignorant 
that I knew not what to say; only I lay and cried, 
Lord look upon me; Lord pity me; Lord have 
mercy upon me : I suppose I did nothing else for 
two or three hours, till the fit wearing off, I fell 
asleep, and did not wake till far in the night; when 
I waked, I found myself much refreshed, but weak, 
and exceeding thirsty : however, as I had no water 
in my whole habitation, I was forced to lie till 
morning, and went to sleep again. In this second 
sleep I had this terrible dream. 

I thought that I was sitting on the ground on 
the out-side of my wall, where I sat when the 
storm blew after the earthquake, and that I saw a 
man descend from a great black cloud, in a bright 
flame of fire, and a light upon the ground. He was 

vox-, r. 1 . 



114 LITE AND ADVENTURES 

all over as bright as a flame, so that I could but 
just bear to look towards him; his countenance 
was most inexpressibly dreadful, impossible for 
words to describe; when he stepped upon the 
ground with his feet I thought the earth trem- 
bled, just as it had done before in the earthquake* 
and all the air looked to my apprehension as if it 
had been filled with flashes of fire. 

He was no sooner landed upon the earth, but he 
moved forward towards me, with a long spear or 
weapon in his hand to kill me ; and when he came 
to a rising ground, at some distance, he spoke to 
me, or I heard a voice so terrible^ that it is impos- 
sible to express the terror of it; all that I can say I 
understood was this, ' Seeing all these things have 
not brought thee to repentance, now thou shalt 
die:' at which words I thought he lifted up the 
spear that was in his hand to kill me. 

No one, that shall ever read this account, w T ill 
expect that I should be able to describe the horrors 
of my soul at this terrible vision; I mean, that 
even while it was a dream, I even dreamed of 
those horrors; nor is it any more possible to de- 
scribe the impression that remained upon my mind, 
when I awaked, and found it was but a dream. 

I had, alas! no divine knowledge; what I had 
received by the good instruction of my father was 
then worn out by an uninterrupted series, for eight 
years, of sea-faring wickedness, and a constant 
conversation with nothing but such as were like 
myself, wicked and profane to the last degree: 
I do not remember that I had in all that time one 
thought that so much as tended either to looking 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 115 

upwards towards God, or inwards toward a reflec- 
tion upon my own ways: but a certain stupidity 
of soul, without desire of good, or conscious of 
evil, had entirely overwhelmed me, and I was 
all that the most hardened, unthinking, wicked 
creature among our common sailors can be sup- 
posed to be, not having the least sense, either of 
the fear of God in danger, or of thankfulness to 
God in deliverances. 

In the relating what is already past of my story, 
this will be the more easily believed, when I shall 
add, that through all the variety of miseries that 
had to this day befallen me, I never had so much 
as one thought of it being the hand of God, or 
that it was a just punishment' for my sin, my re- 
bellious behaviour against my father, or my present 
sins, which were great; or so much as a punish- 
ment for the general course of my wicked life. 
When I was on the desperate expedition on the 
desert shores of Africa, I never had so much as 
one thought of what would become of me; or one 
wish to God to direct me whither I should go, or 
to keep me from the danger which apparently sur- 
rounded me, as well from voracious creatures as 
cruel savages: but I was merely thoughtless of a 
God, or a Providence; acted like a mere brute from 
the principles of nature, and by the dictates of 
common sense only, and indeed hardly that. 

When I was delivered, and taken up at sea by 
the Portugal captain, well used, and dealt justly 
and honourably with, as well as charitably, I had 
not the least thankfulness on my thoughts : when 
again I was shipwrecked, ruined, and in danger of

LIFE AND ADVENTURES 



drowning on this island, I was as far from remorse, 
or looking on it as a judgment; 1 only said to my- 
self often, that I was an unfortunate dog, and born 
to be always miserable. 

It is true, when I got on shore first here, and 
found all my ship's crew drowned, and myself 
spared, I was surprised with a kind of ecstasy, and 
some transports of soul, which, had the grace of 
God assisted, might have come up to true thank- 
fulness; but it ended where it begun, in a mere 
common flight of joy, or, as I may say, being glad 
I was alive, without the least reflection upon the 
distinguishing goodness of the hand which had 
preserved me, and had singled me out to be pre- 
served, when all the rest were destroyed; or an 
inquiry why Providence had been thus merciful to 
me; even just the same common sort of joy which 
seamen generally have, after they have got safe 
on shore from a shipwreck, which they drown all 
in the next bowl of punch, and forget, almost as 
soon as it is over; and all the rest of my life wa^ 
like it. 

Even when I was afterwards, on due considera- 
tion, made sensible of my condition; how I was 
cast on this dreadful place, out of the reach of 
human kind, out of all hope of relief, or prospect 
of redemption; as soon as I saw but a prospect of 
living, and that I should not starve and perish for 
hunger, all the sense of my affliction wore off, and 
I began to be very easy, applied myself to the 
works proper for my preservation and supply, and 
was far enough from being afflicted at my condi- 
tion, as a judgment from heaven, or as the hand of 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 117 

God against me: these were thoughts which very 
seldom entered into my head. 

The growing up of the corn, as is hinted in my 
journal, had at first some little influence upon me, 
and began to afreet me with seriousness, as long as 
I thought it had something miraculous in it; but 
as soon as ever that part of thought was removed, 
all the impression which was raised from it wore 
off also, as I have noted alreadv. 

Even the earthquake, though nothing could be 
more terrible in its nature, or more immediately 
directing to the invisible power, which alone directs 
such things; yet no sooner was the first fright 
over, but the impression it had made went off also, 
I had no more sense of God, or his judgments, 
much less of the present affliction of my circum- 
stances being from his hand, than if I had been in 
the most prosperous condition of life. 

But now, when I began to be sick, and a 
leisurely view of the miseries of death came to 
place itself before me; when my spirits began to 
sink under the burden of a strong distemper, and 
nature was exhausted with the violence of the 
fever; conscience, that had slept so long, began 
to awake, and I began to reproach myself with 
my past life, in which 1 had so evidently, by un- 
common wickedness, provoked the justice of God 
to lay me under uncommon strokes, and to deal 
with me in so vindictive a manner. 

These reflections oppressed me from the second 
or third day of my distemper, and in the violence, 
as well of the fever as of the dreadful reproaches 
of my conscience, extorted some words from me, 



118 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

like praying to God, though I cannot say they 
were either a prayer attended with desires, or with 
hopes; it was rather the voice of mere fright and 
distress: my thoughts were confused, the convic- 
tions great upon my mind, and the horror of dying 
in such a miserable condition, raised vapours into 
my head with the mere apprehensions; and, in 
these hurries of my soul, I knew not what my 
tongue might express. But it was rather exclama- 
tion; such as, Lord! what a miserable creature am 
I ! If I should be sick, I shall certainly die for 
want of help, and what will become of me? Then 
the tears burst out of my eyes, and I could say no 
more for a good while. 

In this interval the good advice of my father 
came to my mind, and presently his prediction, 
which I mentioned in the beginning of this story; 
viz. That if I did take this foolish step, God would 
not bless me, and I would have leisure hereafter 
to reflect upon having neglected his counsel, when 
there might be none to assist in m}^ recovery. 
Now, said I aloud, my dear father's words are 
come to pass: God's justice has overtaken me, and 
I have none to help or hear mQ; I rejected the 
voice of Providence, which had mercifully put me 
in a posture or station of life wherein I might have 
been happy and easy; but I would neither see it 
myself, nor learn to know the blessing of it from 
my parents; I left them to mourn over my folly, 
and now I am left to mourn under the conse- 
quences of it: I refused their help and assistance, 
who would have lifted me into the world, and 
would have made every thing easy to me ; and 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 2 I§ 

now I have difficulties to struggle with, too great 
for even nature itself to support, and no assistance, 
no help, no comfort, no advice. Then I cried out, 
Lord, be my help, for I am in great distress! 

This was the first prayer, if I might call it so, 
that I had made for many years. But I return to 
my journal. 

June 28. Having been somewhat refreshed with 
the sleep I had had, and the fit being entirely off, 
I got up : and though the fright and terror of my 
dream was very great, yet I considered, that the 
fit of the ague would return again the next day, 
and now was my time to get something to refresh 
and support myself when I should be ill; and the 
first thing I did, I filled a large square case bottle 
with water, and set it upon my table, in reach of 
my bed; and to take off the chill or aguish dispo- 
sition of the water, I put about a quarter of a pint 
of rum into it, and mixed them together: then 1 
got me a piece of the goat's flesh, and broiled it 
on the coals, but could eat very little. I walked 
about, but was very weak, and, withal, very sad 
and heavy-hearted under a sense of my miserable 
condition, dreading the return of my distemper 
the next day : at night I made my supper of three 
of the turtle's eggs, which I roasted ill ihk ashes, 
and eat, as we call it, in the shell; and this was 
the first bit of meat I had ever asked God's bless- 
ing to, even, as I could remember, in my whole 
life. 

After I had eaten I tried to walk; but found 
myself so weak, that I could hardly carry the gun 
(for I never went out without that); so I went 
but a little way, and sat down upon the ground, 



120 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

looking out upon the sea, which was just before 
me, and very calm and smooth. As I sat here, 
some such thoughts as these occurred to me: — 

What is the earth and sea, of which I have seen 
so much? Whence is it produced? And what am 
I, and all the other creatures, wild and tame, hu- 
man and brutal; whence are we? 

Sure we are all made by some secret power, who 
formed the earth and sea, the air and skv; and 
who is that? 

Then it followed, most naturally: it is God that 
has made it all. Well, but then it cam eon strangely; 
if God has made all these things, he guides and 
governs them all, and all things that concern them; 
for the Being that could make all things, must 
certainly have power to guide and direct them. 

If sq, nothing can happen in the great circuit 
of his works, either without his knowledge or ap- 
pointment. 

And if nothing happens without his knowledge, 
he knows that I am here, and am in a dreadful 
condition; and if nothing happens without his 
appointment, he has appointed all this tu befall me. 

Nothing occurred to my thoughts to contradict 
any of these conclusions; and therefore it rested 
upon me with the greater force, that it must needs 
be, that God had appointed all this to befall me; 
that I was brought to this miserable circumstance 
by his direction, he having the sole power, not of 
me only, but of every thing that happened in the 
world. Immediately it followed, 

Why has God done this to me? What have I 
done to be thus used? 

My conscience presently checked me in tha c 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 121 

kiquiry, as if I had blasphemed; and methought 
it spoke to me, like a voice; Wretch! dost thou 
ask what thou hast done? Look back upon a dread- 
ful misspent life, and ask thyself what thou hast not 
done? Ask. why is it that thou wert not long ago 
destroyed? Why wert thou not drowned in Yar- 
mouth Roads? killed in the fight when the ship 
was taken by the Sallee man of war? devoured by 
the wild beasts on the coast of Africa? or, drowned 
HERE, when all the crew perished but thyself? 
Dost thou ask, What have I done? 

I was struck with these reflections as one asto- 
nished, and had not a word to say, no, not to an- 
swer to myself; but rose up pensive and sad, 
walked back to my retreat, and went up over my 
wall, as if I had been going to bed; but my thoughts 
were sadly disturbed, and I had no inclination to 
sleep; so I sat down in my chair, and lighted my 
lamp, for it began to be dark. Now, as the ap- 
prehensions of the return of my distemper terrified 
me very much, it occurred to my thought, that 
the Brasilians take no physic but their tobacco, 
for almost all distempers; and I had a piece of a 
roll of tobacco in one of the chests, which was 
quite cured, and some also that was green, and 
not quite cured. 

I went, directed by Heaven, no doubt! for in 
this chest I found. a cure both for soul and body! 
I opened the chest, and found what I looked for, 
viz. the tobacco; and as the few books I had saved 
lav there too, I took out one of the bibles which 
I mentioned before, and which, to this time, I had 
not found leisure, or so much as inclination, to 



I2£ LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

iook into; I say I took it out, and brought both 
that and the tobacco with me to the table. 

What use to make of the tobacco I knew not, 
as to my distemper, or whether it was good for it 
or no; but I tried several experiments with it, as 
if. I resolved it should hit one way or other: I first 
took a piece of a leaf, and chewed it in my mouth, 
which indeed at first almost stupified my brain, 
the tobacco being green and strong, and that I 
had not been much used to it; then I took some, 
and steeped it an hour or two in some rum, and 
resolved to take a dose of it when I lay down; 
and lastly, I burnt some upon a pan of coals, and 
held my nose close over the smoke of it, as long 
as I could bear it, as well for the heat as the virtue 
of it, and I held almost to suffocation. 

In 4;he interval of this operation I took up the 
bible, and began to read; but my head was too 
much disturbed with the tobacco to bear reading, 
at least at that time; only having opened the book 
casually, the first words that occurred to me were 
these, " Call on me in the day of trouble, and I will 
deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me." 

The words were very apt to my case, and made 
some impression upon my thoughts at the time of 
reading them, though not so much as they did 
afterwards ; for, as for being delivered, the word 
had no sound, as I may say, to me; the thing was 
so remote, so impossible in my apprehension of 
things, that I began to say as the children of Israel 
did when they were promised flesh to eat, " Can 
God spread a table in the wilderness?" so I began 
to say, Can God himself deliver me from this 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 123 

place? And as it was not for many years that any 
hope appeared, this prevailed very often upon my 
thoughts; but, however, the words made a very 
great impression upon me, and I mused upon them 
very often. It grew now late, and the tobacco 
had, as I said, dozed my head so much, that I in- 
clined to sleep; so that I left my lamp burning in 
the cave, lest I should want any thing in the night, 
and went to bed: but before I lay down, I did 
what 1 never had done in all my life; I kneeled 
down and prayed to Gob to fulfil the promise to 
me, that if I called upon him in the day of trouble, 
he would deliver me. After my broken and im- 
perfect prayer was over, I drank the rum in which 
I had steeped the tobacco, which was so strong 
and rank of the tobacco, that indeed I could scarce 
get it down* Immediately upon this I went to 
bed, and I found presently it flew up into my head 
violently; but I fell into a sound sleep, and waked 
no more, till by the sun it must necessarily be near 
three o'clock in the afternoon the next day; nay, 
to this hour I am partly of the opinion, that I 
slept all the next day and night, and till almost 
three the day after ; for otherwise I knew not how 
I should lose a day out of my reckoning in the 
days of the week, as it appeared some years after 
I had done; for if I had lost it by crossing and 
recrossing the line, I should have lost more than 
a day : but in my account it was lost, and I never 
knew which way. 

Be that however one way or other, when I 
awaked, I found myself exceedingly refreshed, 
and my spirits lively and cheerful. When I got 



124 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

up, I was stronger than I was the day before, and 
my stomach better; for I was hungry; and, in 
short, I had no fit the next day, but continued 
much altered for the better. This was the 29 th. 

The 30th was my well day, of course; and I 
went abroad with my gun, but did not care to 
travel too far: I killed a sea-fowl or two, something 
like a brand goose, and brought them home, but 
was not very forward to eat them ; so I eat some 
more of the turtle's eggs, which were very good. 
This evening I renewed the medicine which I had 
supposed did me good the day before, viz. the to- 
bacco steeped in rum; only I did not take so much 
as before, nor did I chew any of the leaf, or hold 
my head over the smoke: however, I was not so 
well the next day, which was the first of July, as 
I hoped I should have been; for I had a little 
spice of the cold fit, but it was not much. 

July 2. I renewed the medicine all the three 
ways, and dosed myself with it at first, and doubled 
the quantity which I drank. 

July 3. I missed the fit for good and all, though 
I did not recover my full strength for some weeks 
after. While I was thus gathering strength, my 
thoughts run exceedingly upon this scripture, " I 
will deliver thee;" and the impossibility of my de- 
liverance lay much upon my mind, in bar of my 
ever expecting it: but as I was discouraging my- 
self with such thoughts, it occurred to my mind, 
that I pored so much upon my deliverance from 
the main affliction, that I disregarded the deliver- 
ance I had received; and I was, as it were, made 
to ask myself such questions as these; viz. Have 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 19,5 

I not been delivered, and wonderfully too, from 
sickness? from the most distressed condition that 
could be, and that was so frightful to me? and 
what notice had I taken of it? had I done my part? 
God had delivered me: but I had not glorified 
him : that is to sav, I had not owned and been 
thankful for that as a deliverance; and how could 
I expect greater deliverance? 

This touched my heart very much, and imme- 
diately I kneeled down, and gave God thanks 
aloud, for my recovery from my sickness. 

July 4. In the morning I took the bible; and, 
beginning at the New Testament, I began seri- 
ously to read it, and imposed upon myself to read 
awhile every morning and every night, not tying 
myself to the number of chapters, but as long as 
my thoughts should engage me: it was not long 
after I set seriously to this work, but I found my 
heart more deeply and sincerely affected with the 
wickedness of my past life; the impression of my 
dream revived, and the words, All these things 
have not brought thee to repentance, ran seriously 
in my thoughts. I was earnestly begging of God 
to give me repentance, when it happened provi- 
dentially the very day, that, reading the scripture, I 
came to these words, " He is exalted a Prince and 
a Saviour, to give repentance, and to give remis- 
sion." I threw down the book, and with mv heart 
as well as my hand lifted up to heaven, in a kind 
of ecstasy of joy, I cried outj aloud, Jesus, thou 
son of David, Jesus, thou exalted Prince and Sa- 
viour, give me repentance! 

This was the first time that I could say, in the 



126 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

true sense of the words, that I prayed in all my 
life; for now 1 prayed with a sense of rny condi- 
tion, and with a true scripture view of hope, 
founded on the encouragement of the word of 
God; and from this time, I may say, I began to 
have hope that God would hear me. 

Now I began to construe the words mentioned 
above, " Call on me, and I will deliver thee," in a 
different sense from what I had ever done before; 
for then 1 had no notion of any thing being called 
deliverance, but my being delivered from the 
captivity I was in; for though I was indeed at 
large in the place, yet the island was certainly a 
prison to me, and that, in the worst sense in the 
world; but now I learned to take it in another 
sense. Now I looked back upon my past life with 
such horror, and my sins appeared so dreadful, that 
my soul sought nothing of God, but deliverance 
from the load of guilt that bore^down all my com- 
fort. As for my solitary life, it was nothing; I did 
not so much as pray to be delivered from it, or 
think of it; it was all of no consideration, in com- 
parison of this: and I added this part here, to hint 
to whoever shall read it, that whenever they come 
to a true sense of things, they will find deliver- 
ance from sin a much greater blessing than deli- 
verance from affliction. 

But, leaving this part, I return to my journal. 

My condition began now to be, though not less 
miserable as to my way of living, yet much easier 
to my rnind; and my thoughts being directed by a 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 127 

constant reading the scripture, and praying to 
God, to things of a higher nature, I had a great 
deal of comfort within, which till now I knew no- 
thing of: also as my health and strength returned, 
I bestirred myself to furnish myself with every 
thing that I wanted, and make my way of living 
as regular as I could. 

From the 4th of July to the 14th, I was chiefly 
employed in walking about with my gun in my 
hand, a little and a little at a time, as a man that 
was gathering up his strength aftejr a fit of sick- 
ness; for it is hardly to be imagined how low I was, 
and to what weakness 1 was reduced. The applica- 
tion which I made use of was perfectly new, and 
perhaps what had never cured an ague before; 
neither can I recommend it to any one to practise 
by this experiment; and though it did carry off 
the fit, yet it rather contributed to weaken me; 
for- 1 had frequent convulsions in my nerves and 
limbs for some time. 

I learnt from it also this in particular, that be- 
ing abroad in the rainy season was the most perni- 
cious thing to my health that could be, espe- 
cially in those rains which came attended with 
storms and hurricanes of wind; for as the rain 
which came in a dry season was always most ac- 
companied with such storms, so I found this rain 
was much more dangerous than the rain which fell 
in September and October. 

I had been now in this unhappy island above 
ten months; all possibility of deliverance from 
this condition seemed to be entirely taken from 
me; ^nd I firmly believed that no human shape 



128 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

had ever set Foot upon that place. Having now 
secured my habitation, as I thought, fully to my 
mind, I had a great desire to make a more perfect 
discovery of the island, and to see what other pro- 
ductions I might find, which yet I knew nothing 
of. 

It was the 15th of July that I began to take a 
more particular survey of the island itself; I went 
up the creek first, where, as I hinted, I brought 
my rafts on shore. I found, after I came about 
two miles up, that the tide did not flow any 
higher, and that it was no more than a little brook 
of running water, and very fresh and good; but 
this being the dry season, there was hardly any 
water in some parts of it, at least not enough to 
run into any stream, so as it could be perceived. 

On the bank of this brook I found many plea- 
sant savannas or meadows, plain, smooth, and co- 
vered with grass; and on the rising parts of them 
next to the higher grounds, where the water, as it 
might be supposed, never overflowed, I found a 
great deal of tobacco, green, and growing to a 
great and very strong stalk: there were divers 
other plants which I had no notion of, or under- 
standing about; and might perhaps have virtues 
of their own, which I could not find out. 

I searched for the cassave root, which !the In- 
dians in all that climate make their bread of, but 
I could find none. I saw large plants of aloes, but 
did not then understand them: I saw several sugar 
canes, but wild, and, for want of cultivation, im- 
perfect. I contented myself with these discove- 
ries for this time, and came back musing with 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 1QQ 

myself what course I might take to know the. vir- 
tue and goodness of any of the fruits or plants 
which I should discover, but could bring it to no 
conclusion : for, in short, I had made so little ob- 
servation while I was in the Brasils, that I knew 
little of the plants of the field, at least very little 
that might serve me to any purpose now in my 
distress. 

The next day, the 16th, I went up the same 
way again; and, after going something farther 
than I had done the day before, I found the brook 
and the savannas began to cease, and the country 
became more woody than before. In this part I 
found different fruits, and particularly I found 
melons upon the ground in great abundance, and 
grapes upon the trees; the vines had spread indeed 
over the trees, and the clusters of grapes were just 
now in their prime, very ripe and rich. This was 
a surprising discovery, and I was exceeding glad 
of them, but I was warned by my experience to 
eat sparingly of them, remembering, then when I 
was ashore in Barbaiy, the eating of grapes killed 
several of our Englishmen who were slaves there, 
by throwing them into fluxes and fevers: but I 
found an €xcellent use for these grapes, and that 
was to cure or dry them in the sun and keep them 
as dried grapes or raisins are kept, which I thought 
would be, as indeed th k ey were, as wholesome, and 
as agreeable to eat, when no grapes might be had. 

I spent all that evening there, and went not 
back to my habitation, which by the way was the 
first night, as I might say, I had lain from home, 

I In the night I took my first contrivance, and got 
vol. r. k 



130 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

tip into a tree, where I slept well, and the next 
morning proceeded upon my discovery, travelling- 
near four miles, as I might judge by the length of 
the valley, keeping still due north, with a ridge of 
hills on the south and north side of me. 

At the end of this march I came to an opening, 
where the country seemed to descend to the west; 
and a little spring of fresh water, which issued out 
of the side of the hill by me, ran the other way, 
that is, due east; and the country appeared so 
fresh, so green, so flourishing, every thing being 
in a constant verdure or flourishing of spring, that 
it looked like a planted garden. 

I descended a little on the side of that delicious 
valley, surveying it with a secret kind of pleasure 
(though mixed with other afflicting thoughts) to 
think that this was all my own, that I was king 
and lord of all this country indefeasibly, and had 
a right of possession; and if I could convey it, I 
might have it in inheritance, as completely as any 
lord of a manor in England. I saw here abun- 
dance of cocoa-trees, orange and lemon, and ci- 
tron-trees, but all wild, and few bearing any 
fruit; at least, not then: however, the green limes 
that I gathered were not only pleasant to eat, but 
very wholesome; and I mixed their juice afterwards 
with water, which made jt very wholesome, and 
very cool and refreshing. 

I found now I had business enough to gather 
and carry home; and resolved to lay up a store, 
as-well of grapes as limes and lemons, to furnish 
myself for the wet season, which I knew was ap- 
proaching. 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 131 

In order to do this I gathered a great heap of 
grapes in one place, and a lesser heap in another 
place, and a great parcel of limes and lemons in 
another place ; and taking a few of each with me, 
I travelled homeward, and resolved to come again, 
and bring a bag or sack, or what I could make, 
to carry the rest home. 

Accordingly, having spent three days in thfs 
journey, I came home (so I must now call my 
tent, and my cave;) but before I got thither, the 
grapes were spoiled; the richness of the fruit, and 
the weight of the juice, having broken them, and 
bruised them, they w r ere good for little or nothing: 
as to the limes, they were good, but I could bring 
but a few. 

The next day, being the 19th, I went back, 
having made me two small bags to bring home 
my harvest. But I was surprised, when coming to 
my heap of grapes, which were so rich and fine 
when I gathered them, I found them all spread 
abroad, trod to pieces, and dragged about, some 
here, some there, and abundance eaten and de- 
voured. By this I concluded there were some wild 
creatures thereabouts, which had done this; but 
what they were I knew not. 

However, as I fouud there was no laying them 
up on heaps, and no carrying them away in a sack, 
but that one way they would be destroyed, and 
the other way they would be crushed with their 
own weight, I took another course; for I gathered 
a large quantity of the grapes, and hung them 
upon the out branches of the trees, that they might 
cure and drv in the sun; and as for the limes and 

K 2 



13 L 2 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

lemons, I carried as many back as I could well 
stand under. 

When I came home from this journey, I con- 
templated with great pleasure on the fruitfulness 
of that valley, and the pleasantness of the situa- 
tion, the security from storms on that side of the 
water, and the wood; and concluded that I had 
pitched upon a place to fix my abode which was 
by far the worst part of the country. Upon the 
whole, I began to consider of removing my habi- 
tation, and to look out for a place equally safe as 
where I now was situated, if possible, in that plea- 
sant fruitful part of the island. 

This thought ran long in my head, and I was 
exceeding fond of it for some time, the pleasant- 
ness of the place tempting me; but when I came 
to a nearer view of it, and to consider that I was 
now by the sea side, where it was at least possible 
that something might happen to my advantage, 
and that the same ill fate that brought me hither, 
might bring some other unhappy wretches to the 
same place; and though it was scarce probable 
that any such thing should ever happen, yet to en- 
close myself among the hills and woods, in the 
centre of the island, was to anticipate my bondage, 
and to render such an affair not only improbable, 
but impossible; and that therefore I ought not by 
any means to remove. 

However, I was so enamoured with this place, 
that I spent much of my time there for the whole 
remaining part of the month of July; and though, 
upon second thoughts I resolved as above, not to 
remove, yet I built me a little kind of a bower, 



/ _ 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 133 

and surrounded it at a distance with a strong fence, 
being a double hedge, as high as I could reach, 
well staked and filled between with brushwood; 
and here I lay very secure, sometimes two or three 
nights together, always going over it with a lad- 
der, as before; so that I fancied now I had my 
country house, and my sea-coast house: and this 
work took me. up the beginning of August. 

I had but newly finished my fence, and began 
to enjoy my labour, but the rains came on, and 
made me stick close to my first habitation; for 
though I had made me a tent like the other, with 
a piece of a sail, and spread it very well, yet I had 
not the shelter of a hill to keep me from storms, 
nor a cave behind me to retreat into when the 
rains were extraordinary. 

About the beginning of August, as I said, I had 
finished my bower, and began to enjoy myself. 
The third of August I found the grapes I had 
hung up were perfectly dried, and indeed were 
excellent good raisins of the sun; so I began to 
take them down from the trees, and it was very 
happy that I did so; for the rains which followed 
would have spoiled them, and I had lost the best 
part of my winter food; for I had above two hun- 
dred large bunches of them. No sooner had I 
taken them all down, and caaried most of them 
home to my cave, but it began to rain; and from 
thence, which was the fourteenth of August, it 
rained more or less every day, till the middle of 
October; and sometimes so violently, that I could 
not stir out of my cave for several days. 

In this season I was much surprised with the 



134 fciri AND ADVENTURES 

increase of my family : I had been concerned for 
the loss of one of my cats, who ran away from me, 
or, as I thought, had been dead ; and I heard no 
more tale or tidings of her, till, to my astonishment, 
she came home about the end of August, with 
three kittens. This was the more strange to me, 
because though I had killed a wild cat, as I called 
it, with my gun, yet I thought it was a quite dif- 
ferent kind from our European cats; yet the young- 
cats were the same kind of house breed like the 
old one ; and both my cats being females, I thought 
it very strange: but from these three cats, I after- 
wards came to be so pestered with cats, that I was 
forced to kill them like vermin, or wild beasts, 
and to drive them from my house as much as 
possible. 

From the fourteenth of August to the twenty- 
sixth, incessant rain, so that I could not stir, and 
was now very careful not to be much wet. In 
this confinement I began to be straitened for food; 
but venturing out tw r ice, I one day killed a goat: 
and the last day, which was the twenty-sixth, 
found a very large tortoise, which was a treat to 
me; and my food was regulated thus: I eat a 
bunch of raisins for my breakfast, a piece of the 
goat's flesh, or of the turtle, for my dinner, broiled 
(for to my great misfortune I had no vessel to boil 
or stew any thing;) and two or three of the turtle's 
eggs for supper. 

During this confinement in my cover by the 
rain, I worked daily two or three hours at enlarg- 
ing my cave; and, by degrees, worked it on to- 
wards one side, till I came to the outside of the 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 135 

hill, and made a door or way out, which came be- 
yond my fence or wall ; and so I came in and out 
this way: but I was not perfectly easy at laying 
so open; for as I had managed myself before, I 
was in a perfect enclosure, whereas now I thought 
I lay exposed ; and yet I could not perceive that 
there was any living thing to fear, the biggest 
creature that I had seen upon the island being a 
goat. 

September the thirtieth. I was now come to 
the unhappy anniversary of my landing: I cast 
up the notches on my post, and found I had been 
on shore three hundred and sixty-five days. I 
kept this day as a solemn fast, setting it apart to 
a religious exercise, prostrating myself to the 
ground with the most serious humiliation, confess- 
ing myself to God, acknowledging his righteous 
judgment upon me, and praying to him to have 
mercy on me, through Jesus Christ; and having 
not tasted the least refreshment for twelve hours, 
even to the going down of the sun, I then eat a 
biscuit-cake, and a bunch of grapes, and went to 
bed, finishing the day as I began it. 

I had all this time observed no sabbath day; for 
as at first I had no sense of religion upon my mind, 
I had after some time omitted to distinguish the 
weeks, by making a longer notch than ordinary 
for the sabbath day, and so did not really know 
what any of the days were; but now, having cast 
up the days as above, I found I had been there a 
year; so I divided it into weeks, and set apart 
every seventh day for a sabbath; though I found 



136 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

at the end of my account I had lost a clay or two 
of my reckoning. 

A little after this my ink began to fail me, and 
so I contented myself to use it more sparingly, 
and to write down only the most remarkable events 
of my life, without continuing a daily memoran- 
dum of other things. 

The rainy season, and ,the dry season, began 
now to appear regular to me, and I learned to di- 
vide them so as to provide for them accordingly. 
But I bought all my experience before I had it; 
and this I am going to relate, was one of the most 
discouraging experiments that I made at all. I 
have mentioned, that I had saved the few ears of 
barley and rice which I had so surprisingly found 
spring up, as I thought, of themselves, and believe 
there were about thirty stalks of rice, and about 
twenty of barley; and now I thought it a proper 
time to sow it after the rains, the sun being in its 
southern position going from me. 

Accordingly I dug up a piece of ground, as well 
as I could, with my wooden spade, and dividing it 
into two parts, I sowed my grain; but as I was 
sowing, it casually occurred to my thought, that 
I would not sow it all at first, because I did not 
know when was the proper time for it; so I sowed 
about two thirds of the seeds, leaving about an 
handful of each. It was a great comfort to me 
afterwards that I did so, for not one grain of that 
I sowed this time came to any thing; for the dry 
months following, the earth having had no rain 
after the seed was sown, it had no moisture to 



OF -ROBINSON CRUSOE. 137 

assist its growth, and never came up at all, till the 
wet season had come again, and then it grew as if 
it had been newly sown. 

Finding my first seed did not grow, which I 
easily imagined was by the drought, I sought for 
a moister piece of ground to make another trial in; 
and I dug up a piece of ground near my new 
bower, and sowed the rest of my seed in February, 
a little before the vernal equinox ; and this, having 
the rainy months of March and April to water it ; 
sprung up very pleasantly, and yielded a very good 
crop; but having part of the seed left only, and 
not daring to sow all that I had yet, I had but a 
small quantity at last, my whole crop not amount- 
ing to above half a peck of each kind. 

But by this experience I was made master of 
my business, and knew exactly when the proper 
season was to sow; and that I might expect two 
seed times, and two harvests every year. 

While this corn was growing, I made a little 
discovery, which was of use to me afterwards. As 
soon as the rains were over, and the weather began 
to settle, which was about the month of Novem- 
ber, I made a visit up the country to my bower, 
where though I had not been some months, yet I 
found all things just as I left them. The circle or 
double hedge that I had made, was not only firm 
and entire, but the stakes which I had cut off of 
some trees that grew thereabouts, were all shot 
out, and grown with long branches, as much as a 
willow tree usually shoots the first year after lop- 
ping its head. I could not tell what tree to call 
it that these stakes were cut from. I was sur- 



J38 LIFF AND ADVENTURES 

prised, and yet very well pleased, to see the young 
trees grow ; and I pruned them, and led them up 
to grow as much alike as I could, and it is scarce 
credible, how beautiful a figure they grew into in 
three years; so that though the hedge made a 
circle of about twenty-five yards in diameter, yet 
the trees, for such I might now call them, soon 
covered it; and it was a complete shade, sufficient 
to lodge under all the dry season. 

This made me resolve to cut some more stakes, 
and make me an hedge like this in a semicircle 
round my wall, I mean that of my first dwelling, 
which I did; and placing the trees or stakes in a 
double row, at above eight yards distance from 
my first fence, they grew presently, and were at 
first a fine cover to my habitation, and afterwards 
served for a defence also, as I shall observe in its 
order. 

I found now, that the seasons of the year might 
generally be divided, not into summer and winter, 
as in Europe, but into the rainy seasons, and the 
dry seasons, which were generally thus;

The rainy season sometimes held longer or 
shorter, as the winds happened to blow; but this 
was the general observation I made. After I had 
found, by experience, the ill consequence of being 
abroad in the rain, I took care to furnish myself 
with provision beforehand, that I might not be 
obliged to go out; and I sat within doors as much 
as possible during the wet months. 

In this time I found much employment, (and 
very suitable also to the time) for I found great 
occasion of many things which I had no way to 
furnish myself with, but by hard labour and con- 
stant application: particularly, 1 tried many ways 
to make myself a basket; but all the twigs I could 
get for the purpose proved so brittle, that they 
would do nothing. It proved of excellent advan- 
tage to me now, that when I was a boy, I used to 
take great delight in standing at a basket-maker's 
in the town where my father lived, to see them 
make their wicker ware; and being, as boys usually 
are, very officious to help, and a great observer of 
the manner how they worked those things, and 
sometimes lent a hand, I had bv this means so 



140 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

full knowledge of the methods of it, that I wanted 
nothing but the materials; when it came into my 
mind, that the twigs of that tree from whence I 
cut my stakes that grew, might possibly be as 
tough as the sallows and willows, and osiers, in 
England; and I resolved to try. 

Accordingly the next day I went to my coun- 
try-house, as I called it, and cutting some of the 
smaller twigs, I found them to my purpose as 
much as I could desire; whereupon I came the 
next time prepared with an hatchet to cut down a 
quantity, which I soon found, for there was a 
great plenty of them: these I set up to dry within 
my circle or hedges; and when they were fit for 
use, I carried them to my cave; and here during 
the next season I employed myself in making, (as 
well as I could) a great many baskets, both to 
carry earth, or to carry or lay up any thing, as I 
had occasion; and though I did not finish them 
very handsomely, yet I made them sufficiently 
serviceable for my purpose; and thus afterwards 
I took care never to be without them; and as my 
wicker-ware decayed, I made more; especially I 
made strong deep baskets to place my corn in, in- 
stead of sacks, when I should come to have any 
quantity of it. 

Having mastered this difficulty, and employed a 
world of time about it, I bestirred myself to see, 
if possible, how to supply two wants. I had no 
vessels to hold any thing that was liquid, except 
two rundlets, which were almost full of rum, and 
some glass bottles, some of the common size, and 
others which were case-bottles square, for the 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 14 1 

holding of waters, spirits, &c. I had not so much 
as a pot to boil any thing in, except a great ket- 
tle which I saved out of the ship, and which was 
too big for such uses as I desired it for, viz. to 
make broth, and stew a bit of meat by itself. The 
second thing I would fain have had, was a to- 
bacco pipe, but it was impossible for me to make 
one; however I found a contrivance for that too 
at last. 

I employed myself in planting my second rows 
of stakes of piles, and in this wicker work, all the 
summer, or dry season; when another business 
took me up more time than it could be imagined I 
could spare. 

I mentioned before, that I had a great mind to 
see the whole islaud, and that I had travelled up 
the brook, and so on to where I built my bower, 
and where I had an opening quite to the sea, on the 
other side of the island. I now resolved to travel 
quite across to the sea shore on that side : so taking 
my gun, and hatchet, and my dog, and a larger 
quantity of powder and shot than usual, with two 
biscuit-cakes, and a great bunch of raisins in my 
pouch, for my store, I began my journey. When 
I had passed the vale where my bower stood, as 
above, I came within view of the sea, to the west ; 
and it being a very clear day, I fairly descried land, 
whether an island or continent I could not tell; 
but it lay very high, extending from the West, 
to the W. S.W. at a very great distance; by my 
guess it could not be less than fifteen or twenty 
leagues off. 

1 could not tell what part of the world this 



142 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

might be, otherwise than that I knew it must be 
part of America; and, as I concluded by all my 
observations, must be near the Spanish dominions, 
and perhaps was all inhabited by savages, where 
if I should have landed, I had been in a worse 
condition than I was now; and therefore I acqui- 
esced in the dispositions of Providence, which I 
began now to own, and to believe, ordered every 
thing for the best; I say> I quieted my mind with 
this, and left afflicting myself with fruitless wishes 
of being there. 

Besides, after some pause upon this affair, I con- 
sidered, that if this land was the Spanish coast, I 
shciuid certainly, one time or other, see some ves- 
sels pass or repass one way or other; but if not, 
then it was the savage coast between the Spanish 
country and Brasil, which were indeed the worst 
of savages; for they are cannibals, or men-eaters, 
and fail not to murder and devour all the human 
bodies that fall into their hands. 

With these considerations I walked very lei- 
surely forward. I found that side of the island 
where I now was, much pleasanter than mine, the 
open or savanna fields sweet, adorned with flowers 
and grass, and full of very fine woods. I saw 
abundance of parrots, and fain would I have 
caught one, if possible, to have kept it to be tame, 
and taught it to speak to me. I did, after some 
pains taken, catch a young parrot; for I knocked 
it down with a stick, and having recovered it, I 
brought it home, but it was some years before I 
could make him speak. However, at last I taught 
him to call me by my name, very familiarly: but 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 143 

the accident that followed, though it be a trifle, 
will be very diverting in its place. 

I was exceedingly diverted with this journey : I 
found in the low grounds, hares, as I thought 
them to be, and foxes, but they differed greatly 
from all the other kinds I had met with; nor could 
I satisfy myself to eat them, though I killed seve- 
ral: but I had no need to be ventrous; for I had 
no want of food, and of that which was very 
good too : especially these three sorts, viz. goats, 
pigeons, and turtle or tortoise; which, added to 
my grapes, Leadenhall market could not have 
furnished a better table than I, in proportion to 
the company: and though my case was deplorable 
enough, yet I had great cause for thankfulness, 
that I was not driven to anv extremities for food; 
but rather plenty, even to dainties. 

I never travelled in this journey above two miles 
outright in a day, or thereabouts; but I took so 
many turns and returns, to see what discoveries I 
could make, that I came weary enough to the 
place where I resolved to sit down for all night j 
and then either reposed myself in a tree, or sur- 
rounded myself with a row of stakes set upright in 
the ground, either from one tree to another, or so 
as no wild creature could come at me without 
waking me. 

As soon as I came to the sea- shore, I was sur- 
prised to see that I had taken up my lot on the 
worst side of the island; for here indeed the shore 
was covered with innumerable turtles, whereas on 
the other side I had found but three in a year and 
an half. Here was also an infinite number of fowls 



144 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

of many kinds, some of which I had not seen be- 
fore, and many of them very good meat; but such 
as I knew not the names of, except those called 
penguins. 

I could have shot as many as I pleased, but 
was very sparing of my powder and shot: and 
therefore had more mind to kill a she-a*oat, if I 
could, which I could better feed on: and though 
there were many more goats here than on the 
other side of the island, yet it was with much more 
difficulty that I could come near them: the coun- 
try being flat and even, and they saw me much 
sooner than when I was on the hills. 

I confess this side of the* country was much 
pleasanter than mine, but yet I had not the least 
inclination to remove; for as I was fixed in my ha- 
bitation, it became natural to me; and I seemed 
all the while I was here, to be, as it were, upon a 
journey, and from home. However, I travelled 
along the shore of the sea towards the east, I sup- 
pose, about twelve miles; and then setting up a 
great pole upon the shore for a mark, I concluded 
I would go home again; and the next journey I 
took should be on the other side of the island, east 
from my dwelling, and so round, till I came to 
my post again: of which in its place. 

I took another way to come back than that I 
went, thinking I could easily keep all the island so 
much in my view, that I could not miss finding 
my first dwelling by viewing the country; but I 
found myself mistaken; for being come about two 
or three miles, I found myself descended into a 
very large valley; but so surrounded with hills, 






OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 145 

and those hills covered with woods, that I could 
not see which was my way by any direction but 
that of the sun; nor even then, unless I knew 
very well the position of the sun at that time of 
the day. 

It happened, to my farther misfortune, that the 
weather proved hazy for three or four days, while 
I was in this valley ;, and not being able to see the 
sun, I wandered about very uncomfortably, and 
at last was obliged to find out the sea-side, look for 
my post, and come back the same way I went; 
and then by easy journies I turned homeward, the 
weather being exceeding 'hot; and my gun, ammu- 
nition, hatchet, and other things, very heavy. 

In this journey my dog surprised a young kid, 
and seized upon it; and I running in to take hold 
of it, caught it, and saved it alive from the dog. 
I had a great mind to bring it home, if I could; 
for I had often been musing whether it might not 
be possible to get a kid or two, and so raise a 
breed of tame goats, which might supply me when 
my powder and shot should be spent. 

I made a collar for this little creature; and with 
a string which I made of some rope yarn, which I 
always carried about me, I led him along, though 
with some difficulty, till I came to my bower, and 
there I enclosed him, and left him; for I was very 
impatient to beat home, from whence I had been 
absent above a month. 

I cannot express what a satisfaction it was to 
me to come into my old hutch, and lie down in 
my hammock-bed : this little wandering journey, 
without a settled place of abode, had been so un- 

VOL. I. L 



146 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

pleasant to me, that my own house, as I called it to 
myself, was a perfect settlement to me, compared to 
that; and it rendered every thing about me so 
comfortable, that I resolved I would never go a 
great way from it again, while it should be my lot 
to stay on the island. 

I reposed myself here a week, to rest and regale 
myself after my long journey; during which, most 
of the time was taken up in the weighty aifair of 
making a cage for my Poll, who began now to be 
a mere domestic, and to be mighty well acquainted 
with me. Then I began now to think of the poor 
kid, which I had pent in within my little circle, 
.and resolved to go and fetch it home, and give it 
some food : accordingly I went, and found it 
where I left it; for indeed it could not get out, 
but was almost starved for want of food. I went 
and cut boughs of trees and branches of such 
shrubs as I could find, and threw it over; and 
having fed it, I tied it as I did before to lead it 
away; but it was so tame with being hungry, that 
I had no need to have tied it; for it followed me 
like a dog; and as I continually fed it, the crea- 
ture became so loving, so gentle, and so fond, that 
it became from that time one of my domestics 
also, and would never leave me afterwards. 

The rainy season of the autumnal equinox was 
now come, and I kept the 30th of September in 
the same solemn manner as before, being the anni- 
versary of my landing on the island, having now 
been there two years, and no more prospect of 
being delivered than the first day I came there. I 
spent the whole day in humble and thankful ac- 






OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 147 

knowledgments of the many wonderful mercies 
which my solitary condition was attended with, 
and without which it might have been infinitely 
more miserable. I gave humble and hearty thanks, 
that God had been pleased to discover to me, even 
that it was possible I might be more happy in this 
solitary condition, than I should have been in a 
liberty of society, and in all the pleasures of the 
world: that he could fully make up to me the de- 
ficiences of my solitary state and the want of hu- 
man society, by his presence, and the communica- 
tion of his grace to my soul, supporting, comfort- 
ing, and encouraging me to depend upon his pro- 
vidence here, and hope for his eternal presence 
hereafter. 

It was now that I began sensibly to feel how 
much more happy the life I now led was, with all 
its miserable circumstances, than the wicked 
cursed abominable life I led all the past part of my 
days; and now, having changed both my sorrows 
and my joys, my very desires altered, my affec- 
tions changed their gust, and my delights were 
perfectly new from what they were at first com- 
ing, or indeed for the two years past. 

Before as I walked about, either on my hunting, 
or for viewing the country, the anguish of my soul 
at my condition would break out upon me on a 
sudden, and my very heart would die within me, 
to think of the woods, the mountains, the deserts 
I was in; and how I was a prisoner, locked up 
with the eternal bolts and bars of the ocean, in an 
uninhabited wilderness, without redemption. In 
the midst of the greatest composures of my mind, 

l 2 



148 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

this would break out upon me like a storm, and 
made me wring my hands, and weep like a child. 
Sometimes it would take me in the middle of my 
work* and I would immediately sit down and 
sigh, and look upon the ground for an hour or two 
together; and this was still worse to me; for if I 
could burst out into tears, or vent myself by 
words, it would go off, and the grief, having ex- 
hausted itself, would abate. 

But now I began to exercise myself with new 
thoughts; I daily read the word of God, and ap- 
plied all the comforts of it to my present state. 
One morning, being very sad, I opened the bible 
upon these words, " I will never, never leave thee, 
nor forsake thee!" Immediately it occurred, that 
these words were to me, why else should they be 
directed in such a manner, just at the moment 
when I was mourning over my condition, as one 
forsaken of God and man? Well then, said I, if 
God does not forsake me, of what ill consequence 
can it be, or what matters it, though the world 
should all forsake me; seeing on the other hand, 
if I had all the world, and should lose the favour 
and blessing of God, there would be no compari- 
son in the loss? 

From this moment I began to conclude in my 
mind, that it was possible for me to be more happy 
in this forsaken, solitary condition, than it was 
probable I should have ever been in any other par- 
ticular state in the world; and with this thought 
I was going to give thanks to God for bringing 
me to this place. 

I know not what it was, but something shocked 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 149 

my mind at that thought, and I durst not speak 
the words. How canst thou be such an hypocrite 
(said I, even audibly), to pretend to be thankful 
for a condition, which, however thou mayest en- 
deavour to he contented with, thou wouldest ra- 
ther pray heartily to be delivered from? So I stop- 
ped there; but though I could not say I thanked 
God for being there* yet I sincerely gave thanks 
to God for opening my eyes, by whatever afflicting 
providences, to see the former condition of my 
life, and to mourn for my wickedness, and repent 
I never opened the bible, or shut it, but my very 
soul within me blessed God for directing my friend 
in England, without any order of mine, to pack it 
up among my goods; and for assisting rne after- 
wards to save it out of the wreck of the ship. 

Thus, and in this disposition of mind, I began 
my third year; and though I have not given the 
reader the trouble of so particular an account of 
my works this year as at the first, yet in general 
it may be observed, that I was very seldom idle; 
having regularly divided my time, according to 
the several daily employments that were before 
me; such as, first, my duty to God, and reading 
the scriptures, which I constantly set apart some 
time for, thrice every day. Secondly, the going 
abroad with my gun for food, which generally 
took me up three hours every morning when it 
did not rain. Thirdly, the ordering, curing, 
preserving, and cooking what I had killed or 
catched for my supply. These took up great part 
of the day. Also it is to be considered, that in the 
middle of the day, when the sun was in the ze- 




150 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

nith, the violence of the heat was too great to stir 
out; so that about four hours in the evening was 
all the time I could be supposed to work in; with 
this exception, that sometimes I changed my 
hours of hunting and working, and went to work 
in the morning, and abroad with my gun in the 
afternoon. 

To this short time allowed for labour, I desire 
may be added the exceeding laboriousness of my 
work; the many hours which, for want of tools, 
want of help, and want of skill, every thing that I 
did took up out of my time: for example, I was 
full two-and-forty days making me a board for a 
long shelf, which I wanted in my cave; whereas 
two sawyers, with their tools and saw-pit, would 
have cut six of them out of the same tree in half 
a day. 

My case was this: It was to be a large tree 
which was to be cut down, because my board was 
to be a broad one. The tree I was three days a 
cutting down, and two more cutting off the boughs, 
and reducing it to a log, or piece of timber. With 
inexpressible hacking and hewing, I reduced both 
the sides of it into chips, till it began to be light 
enough to move; then I turned it, and made one 
side of it smooth and flat, as a board, from end to 
end: then turning that side downward, cut the 
other side till I brought the plank to be about three 
inches thick, and smooth on both sides. Any one 
may judge the labour of my hands in such a piece 
of work; but labour and patience carried me 
through that and many other things; I only ob- 
serve this in particular, to shew the reason why 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 151 

so much of my time went away with so little work, 
viz. That what might he a little to be done with 
help and tools, was a vast labour, and required a 
prodigious time to do alone, and by hand. 

But notwithstanding this, with patience and la- 
bour I went through many things, and indeed 
every thing that my circumstances made necessary 
for me to do, as will appear by what follows. 

I was now in the months of November and De- 
cember, expecting my crop of barley and rice. The 
ground I had manured or dug up for them was not 
great; for, as I observed, my seed of each was not 
above the quantity of half a peck; for I had lost 
one whole crop by sowing in the dry season; but 
now my crop promised very well, when on a sud- 
den I found I was in danger of losing it all ao-ain 
by enemies of several sorts, which it was scarce 
possible to keep from it; at first, the goats, and 
wild creatures which I called hares, which, tast- 
ing the sweetness of the blade, lay in it night 
and day, as soon as it came up, and eat it so close, 
that it could get no time to shoot up into stalks. 

This I saw no remedy for, but by making an 
inclosure about it with an hedge, which I did with 
a great deal of toil; and the more, because it re- 
quired a great deal of speed; the creatures daily 
spoiling my corn. However, as my arable land 
was but small, suited to my crop, I got it totally 
well fenced in about three weeks time; and shoot- 
ing some of the creatures in the day-time, I set 
my dog to guard it in the night, tying him up to 
a stake at the gate, where he would stand and 
bark all nightlong: so in a little time the enemies 



15$ LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

forsook the place, and the corn grew very strong 
and well, and began to ripen apace. 

But as the beasts ruined me before, while my 
corn was in the blade, so the birds were as like to 
ruin me now, when it was in the ear; for going 
along by the place to see how it throve, I saw my 
little crop surrounded with fowls of I know not 
how many sorts, which stood as it were watching 
till I should be gone. I immediately let fly among 
them, (for I always had my gun with me.) I had 
no sooner shot, but there arose up a little cloud 
of fowls, which I had not seen at all, from among 
the corn itself. 

This touched me sensibly; for I foresaw, that 
in a few days they would devour all my hopes: 
that I should be starved, and never be able to 
raise a crop at all; and what to do I could not 
tell; however, I resolved not to lose my corn, if 
possible, though I should watch it night and day. 
In the first place, I weal among it to see what 
damage was already done, and found they had 
spoiled a good deal of it; but that, as it was yet 
too green for them, the loss was not so great, but 
the remainder was like to be a good crop, if it 
could be saved. 

I staid by it to load my gun, and then coming 
away, I could easily see the thieves sitting upon 
all the trees about me, as if they only waited till I 
was gone way, and the event proved it to be so; 
for as I walked off, as if I was gone, I was no 
sooner out of their sight, but they dropped down 
one by one into the corn again. I was so provoked, 
that I could not have patience to stay till more 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. ]53 

came on> knowing that every grain that they eat 
now was, as it might he said, a peck loaf to me in 
the consequence; but coming up to the hedge, I 
fired again, and killed three of them. This was 
what I wished for; so I took them up, and served 
them as we serve notorious thieves in England, 
viz. hanged them in chains, for a terror to others. 
It is impossible to imagine almost, that this should 
have such an effect as it had; for the fowls would 
not only not come at the corn, but in short they 
forsook all that part of the island, and I could never 
see a bird near the place as long as my scarecrows 
hung there. 

This I was very glad of, you may be sure; and 
about the latter end of December, which was our 
second harvest of the year, I reaped my corn. 

I was sadly put to it for a scythe or a sickle to 
cut it down, and all I could do was to make one 
as well as I could, out of one of the broad-swords, 
or cutlasses, which I saved among the arms out of 
the ship. However, as my crop was but small, I 
had no great difficulty to cut it down: in short, I 
reaped it my way, for I cut nothing off but the 
ears, and carried it away in a great basket which 
I had made, and so rubbed it out with my hands: 
and at the end of all my harvesting 1 found, that 
out of my half-peck of seed, I had near two 
bushels of rice, and above two bushels and a half 
of barley, that is to say, by my guess, for I had 
no measure at that time. 

However, this was a great encouragement to 
me; and I foresaw that in time it would please 
God to supply me with bread: and yet here I was 



154 LIFE AKD ADVENTURES 

perplexed again ; for I neither knew how to grind 
or make meal of my corn, or indeed how to clean 
it, and part it; nor, if made into meal, how to 
make bread of it; and if how to make it, yet I 
knew not how to bake it. These things being: 
added to my desire of having a good quantity for 
store, and to secure a constant supply, I resolved 
not to taste any of this crop, but to preserve it all 
for seed against the next season, and in the mean 
time to employ all my study and hours of working 
to accomplish this great work of providing myself 
with corn and bread. 

It might be truly said, that I now worked for 
my bread. It is a little wonderful, and what I 
believe few people have thought much upon; viz. 
the strange multitude of little things necessary in 
the providing, producing, curing, dressing, mak- 
ing, and finishing, this one article of bread. 

I, that was reduced to a mere state of nature, 
found this to be my daily discouragement, and was 
made more and more sensible of it every hour, 
even after I got the first handful of seed corn, 
which, as I have said, came up unexpectedly, and 
indeed to a surprise. 

First, I had no plough to turn the earth,Tio spade 
or shovel to dig it. Well, this I conquered by 
making a wooden spade, as I observed before, but 
this did my work but in a wooden manner; and 
though it cost me a great many days to make it, 
yet for want of iron, it not only wore out the 
sooner, but made mv work the harder, and made 
it be performed much worse. 

However, this I bore with too, and was content 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 155 

to work it out with patience, and bear with the 
badness of the performance. When the corn was 
sowed, I had no harrow, but was forced to go over 
it myself, and drag a great heavy bough of a tree 
over it, to scratch the earth, as it may be called, 
rather than rake or harrow it. 

When it was growing or grown, I have observed 
already how many things I wanted, to fence it, 
secure it, mow or reap it, cure or carry it home, 
thresh, part it from the chaff, and save it. Then 
I wanted a mill to grind it, sieves to dress it, yeast 
and salt to make it into bread, and an oven to 
bake it in; and all these things I did without, as 
shall be observed; and yet the corn was an inesti- 
mable comfort and advantage to me too: but all 
this, as I said, made every thing laborious and 
tedious to me, but that there was no help for; 
neither was' my time so much loss to me, because 
I had divided it. A certain part of it was every 
day appointed to these works; and as I resolved 
to use none of the corn for bread till I had a greater 
quantity by me, I had the next six months to 
apply myself, wholly by labour and invention, to 
furnish myself with utensils proper for the per- 
forming all the operations necessary for the making 
the corn, when 1 had it, fit for my use. 

But first I was to prepare more land, for I had 
now seed enough to sow above an acre of ground. 
Before I did this, I had a week's work at least to 
make me a spade, which, when it was done, was a 
very sorry one indeed, and very heavy, and required 
double labour to work with it; however, I went 
through that, and sowed my seeds in two large flat 



156 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

pieces of ground, as near my house as I could find 
them to my mind, and fenced them in with a good 
hedge, the stakes of which were all cut off that 
wood which I had set before, which I knew would 
grow; so that in one year's time I knew I should 
have a quick or living hedge, that would want 
but little repair. This work was not so little as 
to take me up less than three months; because 
great part of that time was in the wet season, 
when I could not go abroad. 

Within-door, that is, when it rained, and I could 
not go out, I found employment on the following- 
occasion, always observing, that all the while I 
was at work, I diverted myself with talking to my 
parrot, and teaching him to speak; and I quickly 
learnt him to know his own name ; at last, to speak 
it out pretty loud, Poll •, which was the first word 
I ever heard spoken in the island by any mouth 
but my own. This therefore was not my work, 
but an assistant to my work ; for now, as I said, I 
had a great employment upon my hands, as fol- 
lows: viz. I had long studied, by some means or 
other, to make mvself some earthen vessels, which 
indeed I wanted sorely, but knew not where to 
come at them : however, considering the heat of 
the climate, I did not doubt but if I could find out 
any such clay, I might botch up some such pot, 
as might, being dried by the sun, be hard enough, 
and strong enough, to bear handling, and to hold 
any thing that was dry, and required to be kept 
so; and as this was necessary in preparing corn, 
meal, &c. which was the thing I was upon, I re- 
solved to make some as large as I could, and fit 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 157 

only to stand like jars to hold what should be put 
into them. 

I would make the reader pity me, or rather 
laugh at me, to tell how many auk ward ways I 
took to raise this paste, what odd misshapen ugly 
things I made, how many of them fell in, and how 
many fell out. the clay not being stiff enough to 
bear its own weight; how many cracked by the 
over violent heat of the sun, being set out too 
hastily; and how many fell to pieces with only 
removing, as well before as after they were dried; 
and, in a word, how, after having laboured hard 
to fiqd the clay, to dig it, to temper it, to bring it 
home, and work it, I could not make above two 
large earthen ugly things, I cannot call them jars, 
in about two months labour. 

However, as the sun baked these two very dry 
and hard, I lifted them very gently up, and set 
them down again in two great wicker baskets, 
which I had made on purpose for them, that they 
might not break; and, as between the pot and the 
basket there was a little room to spare, I stuffed 
it full of the rice and barley straw; and these two 
pots being to stand always dry, I thought would 
hold my dry corn, and perhaps the meal when the 
corn was bruised. 

Though I miscarried so much in my design for 
large pots, yet I made several smaller things with 
better success; such as little round pots, flat dishes, 
pitchers, and pipkins, and any thing my hand 
turned to; and the heat of the sun baked them 
strangely hard. 



158 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

But all this would not answer my end, which 
was to get an earthen pot to hold what was liquid, 
and hear the fire, which none of these could do. 
It happened after some time, making a pretty 
large fire for cooking my meat, when I went to 
put it out after 1 had done with it, I found a bro- 
ken piece of one of my earthen-ware vessels in the 
fire, burnt as hard as a stone, and red as a tile. I 
was agreeably surprised to see it, and said to my- 
self, that certainly they might be made to burn 
whole, if they would burn broken. 

This set me to study how to order my fire, so 
as to make it burn me some pots. I had no notion 
of a kiln, such as the potters burn in, or of glazing 
them with lead, though I had some lead to do it 
with; but I placed three large pipkins, and two 
or three pots, in a pile one upon another, and 
placed my fire-wood all round it, with a great heap 
of embers under them : I plied the fire with fresh 
fuel round the outside, and upon the top, till I saw 
the pots in the inside red-hot quite through, and 
observed that thev did not crack at all: when I 
saw them clear red, I let them stand in that heat 
about five or six hours, till I found one of them, 
though it did not crack, did melt or run; for the 
sand which was mixed with the clay, melted by 
the violence of the heat, and would have run into 
glass, if I had gone on; so I slacked my fire gra- 
dually, till the pots began to abate of the red co- 
lour; and watching them all night, that I might 
not let the fire abate too fast, in the morning I 
had three very good, I will not say handsome pip- 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 159 

kins, and two other earthen pots, as hard burnt as 
could be desired ; and one of them perfectly glazed 
with the running of the sand. 

After this experiment I need not say that I 
wanted no sort of earthen- ware for my use; but 
I must needs say, as to the shapes of them, they 
were very indifferent,- as any one may suppose, 
when I had no way of making them, but as the 
children make dirt-pies, or as a woman would 
make pies that never learnt to raise paste. 

No joy at a thing of so mean a nature was ever 
equal to mine, when I found 1 had made an earthen 
pot that would bear the fire ; and 1 had hardly patience 
to stay till they were cold, before I set one upon 
the fire again, with some water in it, to boil me 
some meat, which I did admirably well; and with 
a piece of a kid I made some very good broth, 
though I wanted oatmeal, and several other ingre- 
dients requisite to make it so good as I would have 
had it. 

My next concern was to get me a stone mortar 
to stamp or beat some corn in; for as to the mill, 
there was no thought of arriving to that perfection 
of art with one pair of hands. To supply this 
want, I was at a great loss; for of all trades in the 
world I was as perfectly unqualified for a stone- 
cutter, as for any whatever; neither had I any 
tools to go about it with. I spent many a day to 
find out a great stone big enough to cut hollow, 
and make fit for a mortar, and could find none at 
all, except what was in the solid rock, and which 
I had no way to dig or cut out; nor indeed were 
the rocks in the island of hardness sufficient, but 



]&0 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

were all of a sandy crumbling stone, which would 
neither bear the weight of an heavy pestle, nor 
would break the corn without filling it with sand; 
so, after a great deal of time lost in searching for 
a stone, I gave it over, and resolved to look out a 
great block of hard wood, which I found indeed 
much easier; and getting one as big as I had 
strength to stir, I rounded it, and formed it on the 
outside with my axe and hatchet; and then, with 
the help of fire and infinite labour, made an hollow 
place in it, as the Indians in Brasil make their 
canoes. After this, I made a great heavy pestle 
or beater, of the wood called the iron- wood; and 
this I prepared and laid by against I had my next 
crop of corn, when I proposed to myself to grind, 
or rather pound, my corn or meal to make my 
bread. 

My next difficulty was to make a sieve or searce, 
to dress my meal, and part it from the bran and 
the husk, without which I did not see it possible I 
could have any bread. This was a most difficult 
thing, so much as but to think on; for, to be sure, 
I had nothing like the necessary things to make 
it with; 1 mean fine thin canvass, or stuff*, to searce 
the meal through. And here I was at a full stop 
for many months; nor did I really know what to 
do: linen I had none left but what was mere rags; 
I had goat's hair, but neither knew I how to weave 
or spin it; and had I known how, here were no 
tools to work it with. All the remedy that I found 
for this, was, that at last I did remember I had 
among the seamen's clothes, which were saved out 
of the ship, some neckcloths of calico or muslin; 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 161 

and with some pieces of these I made three small 
sieves, but proper enough for the work: and thus 
I made shift for some years; how I did afterwards, 
I shall shew in its place. 

The baking part was the next thing to be con- 
sidered, and how I should make bread when I 
came to have corn; for, first, I had no yeast, As 
to that part, there was no supplying the want, so 
I did not concern myself much about it. But for 
an oven, I was indeed in great pain. At length I 
found out an experiment for that also, which was 
this: I made some earthen vessels verv broad, but 
not deep; that is to say, aboat two feet diameter, 
and not above nine inches deep; these I burnt in 
the fire, as I had done the other, and laid them 
by : and when I wanted to bake, I made a great 
fire upon the hearth, which I had paved with some 
square tiles of my own making and burning also; 
but I should not call them square. 

When the fire-wood was burnt pretty much into 
embers, or live coals, I drew them forward upon 
this hearth, so as to cover it all over; and there I 
let them lie, till the hearth was very hot: then 
sweeping away all the embers, I set down my loaf, 
or loaves; and whelming down the earthen pot 
upon them, drew the embers all round the outside 
of the pot, to keep in, and add to the heat: and 
thus, as well as in the best oven in the world, I 
baked my barley-loaves, and became in a little 
time a mere pastry-cook into the bargain; for I 
made myself several cakes of the rice, and pud- 
dings; indeed I made no pies, neither had I any 

VOL. I. M 



162 . LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

thing to put into them, supposing I had, except 
the flesh either of fowls or goats. 

It need not be wondered at, if all these things 
took me up most part of the third year of my 
abode here; for it is to be observed, that in the 
intervals of these things, I had my new harvest 
and husbandry to manage: for I reaped my corn 
in its season, and carried it home as well as I could, 
and laid it up in the ear, in my large baskets, till 
I had time to rub it out; for I had no floor to 
thrash it on, or instrument to thrash it with. 

And now indeed, my stock of corn increasing, 
I really wanted to build my barns bigger: I wanted 
a place to lay it up in; for the increase of the corn 
now yielded me so much, that I had of the barley 
about twenty bushels, and of the rice as much, or 
more; insomuch that I now resolved to begin to 
use it freely, for my bread had been quite gone a 
great while; also I resolved to see what quantity 
would be sufficient for nie a whole year, and to 
sow but once a year. 

Upon the whole, I found that the forty bushels 
of barley and rice were much more than I could 
consume in a year; so I resolved to sow just the 
same quantity every year that I sowed the last, in 
hopes that such a quantity would fully provide 
me with bread, &c. 

All the while these things were doing, you may 
be sure my thoughts ran many times upon the 
prospect of land which I had seen from the other 
side of the island; and I was not without secret 
wishes that I was on shore there, fancying; that 



OP ROBINSON CRUSOE. 163 

seeing the main land, and an inhabited country, I 
might find some way or other to convey myself 
farther, and perhaps at last find some means of 
escape. 

But all this while I made no allowance for the 
clangers of such a condition, and how I might fall 
into the hands of savages, and perhaps such as I 
mio-ht have reason to think far worse than the 
lions and tigers of Africa: that if I once came into 
their power, I should run an hazard more than a 
thousand to one of being killed, and perhaps of 
being eaten; for I had heard that the people of 
the Caribean coasts were cannibals, or men-eaters; 
and I knew by the latitude that I could not be 
far off from that shore: that, suppose they were 
not cannibals, yet they might kill me, as many 
Europeans who had fallen into their hands had 
been served, even when they had been ten or 
twenty together; much more I that was but one, 
and could make little or no defence. All these 
things, I say, which I ought to have considered 
well of, and I did cast up in my thoughts after- 
wards, yet took none of my apprehensions at first; 
and my head ran mightily upon the thoughts of 
getting over to that shore. 

Now I wished for my boy Xury, and the long 
boat with the shoulder-of-mutton sail, with which 
I sailed above a thousand miles on the coast of 
Africa; but this was in vain. Then I thought I 
would go and look on our ship's boat, which, as I 
have said, was blown up upon the shore a great 
way in the storm, when we were first cast away. 
She lay almost where she did at first, but not 

m 2 



164 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

quite; and was turned, by the force of the waves 
and the winds, almost bottom upwards, against the 
high ridge of a beachy rough sand, but no water 
about her as before. 

If I had had hands to have refitted her, and 
have launched her into the water, the boat would 
have done well enough, and I might have gone 
back into the Brasils with her easy enough; but I 
might have easily foreseen, that I could no more 
turn her, and set her upright upon her bottom, 
than I could remove the island. However I went 
to the wood, and cut levers and rollers, and brought 
them to the boat, resolving to try what I could 
do; suggesting to myself, that if I could but turn 
her down, I might easily repair the damage she 
had received, and she vvould be a very good boat, 
and I might go to sea in her very easily. 

I spared no, pains indeed in this piece of fruitless 
toil, and spent, I think, three or four weeks about 
it: at last finding it impossible to heave it up with 
my little strength, I fell to digging away the sand 
to undermine it; and so to make it fall down, set- 
ting pieces of wood to thrust and guide it right in 
the fall. 

But when I had done this, I was unable to stir 
it up again, or to get under it, much less to move 
it forwards towards the water; so I was forced to 
give it over: and yet, though I gave over hopes 
of the boat, my desire to venture over for the 
main increased, rather than decreased, as the means 
for it seemed impossible. 

This at length set me upon thinking whether it 
was not possible to make myself a canoe or pe* 






OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 165 

riagua, such as the natives of those climates make, 
even without tools, or as I might say, without 
hands, viz. of the trunk of a great tree. This I 
not only thought possible, but easy; and pleased 
myself extremely with my thoughts of making it, 
and with my having much more convenience for 
it than any of the negroes or Indians; but not at 
all considering the particular inconveniences which 
I lay under more than the Indians did, viz. want 
of hands to move it into the w^ater, when it was 
made; a difficulty much harder for me to surmount 
than all the consequences of want of tools could 
be to them: for what was it to me, that when I 
had chosen a vast tree in the woods, I might with 
great trouble cut it down, if, after I might be able 
with my tools to hew and dub the outside into a 
proper shape of a boat, and burn or cut out the 
inside to make it hollow, so to make a boat of it; 
if, after all this, I must leave it just there where I 
found it, and was not able to launch it into the 
water? 

One w T ould have thought, I could not have had 
the least reflection upon my mind of my circum- 
stances, while I was making my boat, but I should 
have immediately thought how I should get it 
into the sea; but my thoughts were so intent upon 
my voyage over the sea in it, that I never once 
considered how I should get it off the land ; and 
it was really in its own nature more easy for me to 
guide it over forty-five miles of sea, than about 
forty-five fathom of land, where it lay, to set it 
afloat in the water* 

I went to work upon this boat the most like a 



166* LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

fool that ever man did, who had any of his senses 
awake. I pleased myself with the design, without 
determining whether I was ever able to undertake 
it; not but that the difficulty of launching my boat 
came often into my head; but I put a stop to my 
own inquiries into it by this foolish answer, which 
I gave myself; Let me first make it, I will war- 
rant I will find some way or other to get it along, 
when it is done. 

This was a most preposterous method; but the 
eagerness of my fancy prevailed, and to work I 
went, and felled a cedar-tree: I question much 
whether Solomon ever had such an one for the 
building the temple of Jerusalem; it was five feet 
ten inches diameter at the lower part next the 
stump, and four feet eleven inches diameter at the 
end of twenty-two feet, after which it lessened for 
a while, and then parted into branches. It was 
not without infinite labour that I felled this tree: 
I was twenty days hacking and hewing at it at the 
bottom; I was fourteen more getting the branches 
and limbs, and the vast spreading head of it cut 
off, which I hacked and hewed through with my 
axe and hatchet, with inexpressible labour; after 
this it cost me a month to shape it, and dub it to 
a proportion, and to something like the bottom of 
a boat, that it might swim upright as it ought to 
do. It cost me near three months more to clear 
the inside, and work it out so as to make an exact 
boat of it: this I did indeed without fire, by mere 
mallet and chissel, and by the dint of hard labour; 
till I had brought it to be a very handsome pe- 
riagua, and big enough to have carried six-and- 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 167 

wenty men, and consequently big enough to have 
carried me and all my cargo. 

When I had gone through this work, I was 
extremely delighted with it: the boat was really 
much bigger than I ever saw a canoe or periagua, 
that was made of one tree, in my life; many a 
weary stroke it had cost, you may be sure, for 
there remained nothing but to get it into the 
water; and had I gotten it into the water, I make 
no question but I should have begun the maddest 
voyage, and the most unlikely to be performed, that 
ever was undertaken. 

But all my devices to get it into the water failed 
me, though they cost infinite labour too; it lay 
about one hundred yards from the water, and not 
more; but the first inconvenience was, it was up 
hill towards the creek. Well, to take away this 
discouragement, I resolved to dig into the surface 
of the earth, and so make a declivity; this I began, 
and it cost me a prodigious deal of pains: but who 
grudge pains, that have their deliverance in view? 
But when this was worked through, and this diffi- 
culty managed, it was still much at one; for I could 
no more stir the canoe, than 1 could the other boat. 

Then I measured the distance of ground, and re- 
solved to cut a dock, or canal, to bring the water 
up to the canoe, seeing I could not bring the canoe 
down to the water. Well, I began this work, and 
when I began to enter into it, and calculated how 
deep it was to be dug, how broad, how the stuff 
to be thrown out, I found, that by the number of 
hands I had, being none but my own, it must have 
been ten or twelve years before I should have gone 



i<58 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

through with it; for the shore lay high, so that at 
the upper end it must have been at least twenty 
feet deep ; so at length, though with great reluc- 
tancy, I gave this attempt over also. 

This grieved me heartily; and now I saw, though 
too late, the folly of beginning a work before we 
count the cost, and before we judge rightly of our 
own strength to go through with it. 

In the middle of this work I finished my fourth 
year in this place, and kept my anniversary with 
the same devotion, and with as much comfort, as 
ever before; for by a constant study, and serious 
application of the word of God, and by the assist- 
ance of his grace, I gained a different knowledge 
from what I had before; I entertained different 
notions of things; I looked now upon the world as 
a thing remote; which I had nothing to do with, 
no expectation from, and indeed no desires about: 
in a word, I had nothing indeed to do with it, nor 
was ever like to have; so I thought it looked, as we 
may perhaps look upon it hereafter, viz. as a place 
I had lived in, but was come out of it; and well 
I might say, as father Abraham to Dives, Between 
me and thee there is a great gulph fixed. 

in the first place, I w r as removed from all the 
wickedness of the world here: I had neither the 
lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye, or the pride 
of life: I had nothing to covet, for I had all I was 
now capable of enjoying: I was lord of the whole 
manor; or, if I pleased, I might call myself king 
or emperor over the whole country which I had 
possession of: there were no rivals : I had no com- 
petitor, none to dispute sovereignty or command 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 1^9 

with me ; I might have raised ship-loadings of corn* 
but I had no use for it; so I let as little grow as I 
thought enough for my occasion: I had tortoises, 
or turtles enough; but now and then one was as 
much as I could put to any use: I had timber 
enough to have built a fleet of ships; I had grapes 
enough to have made wine, or to have cured into 
raisins, to have loaded that fleet when they had 
been built. 

But all 1 could make use of, was all that was 
valuable: I had enough to eat, and to supply my 
wants, and what was all the rest to me? If I 
killed more flesh than I could eat, the dog must 
eat it, or the vermin; if I sowed more corn than 
I could eat, it must be spoiled: the trees that I 
cut down were lying to rot on the ground, I could 
make no more use of them than for fuel; and that 
I had no occasion for, but to dress my food. 

In a word, the nature and experience of things 
dictated to me, upon just reflection, that all the 
good things of this world are no farther good to 
us, than as they are for our use: and that what- 
ever we may heap up indeed to give to others, we 
enjoy as much as we can use, and no more. The 
most covetous griping miser in the world would 
have been cured of the vice of covetousness, if he 
had been in my case ; for I possessed infinitely 
more than I knew what to do with. I had no 
room for desire, except it was; of things which I 
had not, and they were but trifles, though indeed 
of great use to me. I had, as I hinted before, a 
parcel of money, as well gold as silver, about 
thirty-six pounds sterling; alas! there the nasty, 



170 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

sorry, useless stuff lay; I had no manner of busi- 
ness for it; and I often thought with myself, that 
I would have given an handful of it for a gross of 
tobacco-pipes, or for an hand-mill to grind my 
corn; nay, I would have given it all for six-penny 
worth of turnip and carrot seed out of England, or 
for an handful of peas and beans, and a bottle of 
ink: as it was, I had not the least advantage by 
it, or benefit from it; but there it lay in a drawer, 
and grew mouldy with the damp of the cave in 
the wet season; and if I had had the drawer full of 
diamonds, it had been the same case; and they 
had been of no manner of value to me, because of 
no use. 

I had now brought my state of life to be much 
easier in itself than it was at first, and much easier 
to my mind, as well as to my body. I frequently 
sat down to my meat with thankfulness, and ad- 
mired the hand of Gop's providence, which had 
thus spread my table in the wilderness. I learned 
to look more upon the bright side of my condition, 
and less upon the dark side; and to consider what 
I enjoyed, rather than what I wanted; and this 
gave me sometimes such secret comforts, that I 
cannot express them; and which I take notice of 
here, to put those discontented people in mind of 
it, who cannot enjoy comfortably what God hath 
given them, because they see and covet something 
that he has not given them: all our discontents 
about what we want, appeared to me to spring 
from the want of thankfulness for what we have. 

Another reflection was of great use to me, and 
doubtless would be so to any one that should fall 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 171 

into such distress as mine was; and this was, to 
compare my present condition with what I at first 
expected it should be; nay, with what it would 
certainly have been, if the good providence of God 
had not wonderfully ordered the ship to be cast 
up near to the shore, where I not only could come 
at her, but could bring what I got out of her to 
the shore for my relief and comfort; without 
which I had wanted tools to work, weapons for de- 
fence, or gunpowder and shot for getting my food. 

I spent whole hours, I may say whole days, in 
representing to myself in the most lively colours, 
how I must have acted, if I had got nothing out 
of the ship; how I could not have so much as got 
any food, except fish and turtles; and that, as it 
was long before I found any of them, I must have 
perished first: that I should have lived, if I had 
not perished, like a mere savage: that if I had 
killed a goat or a fowl by any contrivance, I had 
no way to slay or open them, or part the flesh 
from the skin and the bowels, or to cut it up; but 
must gnaw it with my teeth, and pull it with my 
claws, like a beast. 

These reflections made me very sensible of the 
goodness of Providence to me, and very thankful 
for my present condition, with all its hardships 
and misfortunes: and this part also I cannot but 
recommend to the reflection of those who are apt 
in their misery to say, Is any affliction like mine? 
Let them consider, how much worse the cases of 
some people are, and what their case might have 
been, if Providence had thought fit. 

I had another reflection which assisted me also 



172 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

to comfort my mind with hopes; and this was, 
comparing my present condition with what I had 
deserved, and had therefore reason to expect from 
the hand of Providence; I had lived a dreadful 
life, perfectly destitute of the knowledge and fear 
of God: I had been well instructed by my father 
and mother; neither had they been wanting to 
me in their early endeavours, to infuse a religious 
awe of God into my mind, a sense of my duty, 
and of what the nature and end of my being re-* 
quired of me. But, alas! falling early into the sea- 
faring life, which of all the lives is the most desti- 
tute of the fear of God, though his terrors are 
always before them; I say, falling' early into the 
seafaring life, and into seafaring company, all that 
little sense of religion which I had entertained, 
was laughed out of me by my messmates; by an 
hardened despising of dangers, and the views of 
death, which grew habitual to me; by my long 
absence from ail manner of opportunities to con- 
verse with any thing but what was like myself, or 
to hear any thing of what was good, or tended to- 
wards it. 

So void was I of every thing that was good, or 
of the least sense of what I was, or was to be, that 
in the greatest deliverance I enjoyed, such as my 
escape from Sallee, my being taken up by the 
Portuguese master of the ship, my being planted 
so well in Brasil, my" receiving the cargo from 
England, and the like, I never once had the words 
Thank God, so much as on my mind, or in my 
mouth ; nor in the greatest distress, had I so much 
thought as to pray to him ; nor so much as to say, 



OP ROBINSON CRUSOE. 175 

Lord have mercy upon me! No, not to mention 
the name of God, unless it was to swear by, and 
blaspheme it. 

I had terrible reflections upon my mind for 
many months, as I have already observed, on the 
account of my wicked and hardened life past; and 
when I looked about me, and considered what 
particular Providences had attended me, since my 
coming into this place, and how God had dealt 
bountifully with me; had not only punished me 
less than my iniquity deserved, but had so plenti- 
fully provided for me; this gave me great hopes 
that my repentance was accepted, and that God 
had yet mercies in store for me. 

With these reflections I worked my mind up, 
not only to resignation to the will of God in the 
present disposition of my circumstances, but even 
to a sincere thankfulness of my condition; and 
that I, who was yet a living man, ought not to 
complain, seeing I had not the due punishment of 
my sins; that I enjoyed so many mercies, which 
I had no reason to have expected in that place; 
that I ought never more to repine at my condition, 
but to rejoice, and to give daily thanks for that 
daily bread which nothing but a cloud of wonders 
could have brought: that I ought to consider I 
had been fed even by a miracle, even as great as 
that of feeding Elijah by ravens; nay, by a long 
series of miracles; and that I could hardly have 
named a place in the uninhabited part of the world, 
where I could have been cast more to my advan- 
tage: a place where, as I had no society, which 
was mv affliction on one hand, so 1 found no ra- 



174 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

venous beasts, no furious wolves or tigers, to 
threaten my life; no venonous creatures, or poi- 
sonous, which I might have fed on to my hurt; 
no savages to murder and devour me. 

In a word, as my life was a life of sorrow one 
way, so it was a life of mercy another: and I 
wanted nothing to make it a life of comfort, but 
to be able to make my sense of God's goodness to 
me, and care over me in this condition, be my 
daily consolation; and after I made a just improve- 
ment of these things, I went away, and was no 
more sad. 

I had now been here so long, that many things 
which I brought on shore for my help, were either 
quite gone, or very much wasted, and near spent. 

My ink, as I observed, had been gone for some 
time, all but a very little, which I eked out with 
water a little and a little, till it was so pale it scarce 
left any appearance of black upon the paper: as 
long as it lasted, I made use of it to minute down 
the days of the month on which any remarkable 
thing happened to me; and first, by casting up 
times past, I remember that there was a strange 
concurrence of days, in the various providences 
which befell me, and which, if I had been super- 
stitiously inclined to observe days as fatal or for- 
tunate, I might have had reason to have looked 
upon with a great deal of curiosity. 

First, I had observed, that the same day that I 
broke away from my father and my friends, and 
ran away to Hull in order to go to sea, the same 
day afterwards I was taken by the Sallee man of 
war, and made a slave. 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 175 

The same day of the year that I escaped out of 
the wreck of that ship in Yarmouth Roads, that 
same day of the year afterwards I made my escape 
from Sallce in the boat. 

The same day of the year I was born on, viz, 
the 20th of September, the same day I had my 
life so miraculously saved 26 years after, when I 
was cast on shore in this island; so that my wicked 
life, and solitary life, both began on a day. 

The next thing to my ink's being wasted, was 
that of my bread, I mean the biscuit which I 
brought out of the ship. This I had husbanded to 
the last degree, allowing myself but one cake of 
bread a day, for above a year: and yet I was quite 
without bread for a year before I got any corn of 
my own; and great reason I had to be thankful 
that I had any at all, the getting it being, as has 
been already observed, next to miraculous. 

My clothes too began to decay mightily: as to 
linen, I had none a good while, except some che- 
quered shirts which I found in the chests of the 
other seamen, and which I carefully preserved, 
because many times I could bear no other clothes 
on but a shirt; and it was a very great help to me, 
that I had among all the men's clothes of the ship 
almost three dozen of shirts. There were also 
several thick watch-coats of the seamen, which 
were left behind, but they were too hot to wear; 
and though it is true, that the weather was so 
violent hot, that there was no need of clothes, yet 
I could not go quite naked; no, though I had 
been inclined to it, which I was not; nor could I 
abide the thoughts of it, though I was all alone. 



]76 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

One reason why I could not go quite naked, 
was, I could not bear the heat of the sun so well 
when quite naked, as with some clothes on; nay, 
the very heat frequently blistered my skin; whereas, 
with a shirt on, the air itself made some motion, 
and whistling under the shirt, was twofold cooler 
than without it: no more could I ever bring my- 
self to go out in the heat of the sun without a cap 
or an hat; the heat of the sun beating with such 
violence as it does in that place, would give me 
the head-ach presently, by darting so directly on 
my head, without a cap or hat on, so that I could 
not bear it; whereas, if I put on my hat, it would 
presently go away. 

Upon these views I began to consider about 
putting the few rags I had, which I called clothes, 
into some order; I had worn out all the waistcoats 
I had, and my business was now to try if I could 
not make jackets out of the great watch-coats 
which I had by me, and with such other materials 
as I had; so I set to work a- tailoring, or rather in- 
deed a botching; for I made most piteous work 
of it. However, I made shift to make two or 
three waistcoats, which I hoped would serve me 
a great while; as for breeches or drawers, I made 
but very sorry shift indeed, till afterwards. 

I have mentioned that I saved the skins vf all 
the creatures that I killed, I mean four-footed 
ones; and I had hung them up stretched out wi h 
sticks in the sun; by which means some of them 
were so dry and hard, that they were fit for little; 
but others, it seems, were very useful. The first 
thing I made of these was a great cap for my 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 177 

head, with the hair on the outside to shoot off 
the rain; and this I performed so well, that after 
this I made a suit of clothes wholly of those skins; 
that is to say, a waistcoat and breeches open at 
the knees, and both loose; for they were rather 
wanted to keep me cooi, than to keep me warm. 
I must not omit to acknowledge, that they were 
wretchedly made; for if I was a bad carpenter, I 
was a worse tailor: however, they were such as I 
made a very good shift with; and when I was 
abroad, if it happened to rain, the hair of the waist- 
coat and cap being outmost, I was kept very dry. 
After this I spent a deal of time and pains to 
make me an umbrella: 1 was indeed in great want 
of one, and had a great mind to make one : I had 
seen them made in the Brasils, where they are very 
useful in the great heats which are there; and I 
felt the heats every jot as great here, and greater 
too, being nearer the equinox ; besides, as I was 
obliged to be much abroad, it was a most useful 
thing to me, as well for the rains as the heats. I 
took a world of pains at it, and was a great while 
before 1 could make any thing likely to hold; nay, 
after I thought I had bit the way, I spoiled two 
or three before I made one to my mind; but at 
last I made one that answered indifferently well; 
the main difficulty I found was to make it to let 
'"down. I could make it to spread; but if it did 
not let down too, and draw in, it would not be 
portable for me any way, but just over my head, 
which would not do. However, at last, as I said, 
I made one to answer; I covered it with skins, 
the hair upwards, so that it cast off the rain like 

VOL- I. N 



J78 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

a pent-house, and kept off the sun so effectually, 
that I could walk out in the hottest of the weather, 
with greater advantage than I could before in the 
coolest; and when I had no need of it, I could 
close it, and carry it under my arm. 

Thus I lived mighty comfortably, my mind 
being entirely composed by resigning to the will 
of God, and throwing myself wholly upon the 
disposal of his Providence: this made my life bet- 
ter than sociable; for when I began to regret the 
want of conversation, I would ask myself, whether 
thus conversing mutually with my own thoughts, 
and, as I hope, I may say, with even my Maker, 
by ejaculations and petitions, was not better than 
the utmost enjoyment of human society in the 
world? 

I cannot say, that after this, for five years, any 
extraordinary thing happened to me; but I lived 
on in the same course, in the same posture and 
place just as before: the chief thing I was em- 
ployed in, besides my yearly labour of planting 
my barley and rice, and curing my raisins, of both 
which I always kept up just enough to have suffi- 
cient stock of the year's provisions before-hand; I 
say, besides this yearly labour, and my daily labour 
of going out with my gun, I had one labour to 
make me a canoe, which at last I finished: so that 
by digging a canal to it, six feet wide, and four 
feet deep, I brought it into the creek, almost half 
a mile. As for the first, that was so vastly b\g y 
as I made it without considering beforehand, as I 
ought to do, how I should be able to launch it; 
so never being able to bring it to the water, or 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. ..] 79 

bring the water to it, I was obliged to let it lie 
where it was, as a memorandum to teach me to be 
wiser next time. Indeed the next time, though 
I could not get a tree proper for it, and was in a 
place where I could not get the water to it, at any 
less distance than, as I have said, of near half a 
mile; yet as I saw it was practicable at last, I 
never gave it over; and though I was near two 
years about it, yet I never grudged my labour, in 
hopes of having a boat to go off to sea at last. 

However, though my little periagua was finished, 
yet the size of it was not at all answerable to the 
design which I had in view, when I made the first; 
I mean of venturing over to the terra firma, where 
it was above forty miles broad; accordingly, the 
smallness of my boat assisted to put an end to that 
design, and now I thought no more of it. But as 
I had a boat, my next design was to make a tour 
round the island ; but as I had been on the other 
side, in one place, crossing, as I have already de- 
cribed it, over the land, so the discoveries 1 made 
in that journey made me very eager to see the 
other parts of the coast; and now I had a boat, I 
thought of nothing but sailing round the island. 

For this purpose, and that I might do every 
thing with discretion and consideration, I fitted 
up a little mast to my boat, and made a sail to it 
out of some of the pieces of the ship's sails, which 
lay in store, and of which I had a great store by 
me. 

Having fitted my mast and sail, and tried the 
boat, I found she would sail very well. Then I 

N 2 



ISO LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

made little lockers and boxes at each end of my 
boat, to put provisions, necessaries, and ammuni- 
tion, &c. into, to be kept dry, either from rain, or 
the spray of the sea; and a little long hollow place 
I cut in the inside of the boat, where 1 could lay 
my gun, making a flap to hang down over it to 
keep it dry. 

I fixed my umbrella also in a step at the stern, 
like a mast, to stand over my head, and keep the 
heat of the sun off me, like an awning; and thus 
I every now and then took a little voyage upon 
the sea, but never went far out, nor far from the 
little creek;- but at last, being eager to view the 
circumference of my little kingdom, I resolved 
upon my tour, and accordingly I victualled my 
ship for the voyage ; putting in two dozen of my 
loaves (cakes I should rather call them) of barley- 
bread; an earthen pot full of parched rice, a food 
I eat a great deal of; a little bottle of rum, half a 
goat, and powder with shot for killing more, and 
two large watch-coats, of those which, as I men- 
tioned before, I had saved out of the seamen's 
chests; these I took, one to lie upon, and the otheF 
to cover me in the night. 

It was the sixth of November, in the sixth year 
of my reign, or my captivity, which you please, 
that I set out on this voyage, and I found it much 
longer than I expected: for though the island 
itself was not very large, yet when I came to the 
east side of it, I found a great ledge of rocks lie 
out about two leagues into the sea, some above 
, water, some under it; and beyond this a shoal of 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE, 181 

sand, lying dry half a league more; so that I was 
obliged to go a great way out to sea to double that 
point. 

When I first discovered them, I was going to 
give over my enterprize, and come back again, not 
knowing how far it might oblige me to go out to 
sea, and above all, doubting how I should get back 
again; so I came to an anchor, for I had made me 
a kind of an anchor with a piece of broken grap- 
pling which I got out of the ship. 

Having secured my boat, I took my gun, and 
went on shore, climbing up an hill, which seemed 
to overlook that point, where I saw the full extent 
of it, and resolved to venture. 

In my viewing the sea from that hill where I 
stood, I perceived a strongs and indeed, a most fu- 
rious current, which ran to the east, even came 
close to the point; and I took the more notice of 
it, beeause I saw there might be some danger, 
that when I came into it, I might be carried out 
to sea by the strength of it, and not be able to 
•make the island again. And indeed, had I not 
gotten first upon this hill, I believe it would have 
been so; for there was the same current on the 
other side of the island, only that it set it off at a 
farther distance; and I saw there was a strong 
eddy under the shore; so I had nothing to do but 
to get out of the first current, and I should pre- 
sently be in an eddy. 

I lay here, however, two days; because the wind 
blowing pretty fresh (E. at S. E. ami that being 
just contrary to the said current) made a great 
breach of the sea upon the point; so that it was 



182 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

not safe for me to keep too close to the shore for the 
breach, nor to go too far ofT because of the stream. 

The third day in the morning, the wind having 
abated over night, the sea was calm, and I ven- 
tured; but I am a warning-piece again to ail rash 
and ignorant pilots; for no sooner was I come to 
the point, when I was not my boat's length from 
the shore, but I found myself in a great depth of 
water, and a current like the sluice of a mill It 
carried my boat along with it with such violence, 
that all I could do could not keep her so much as 
on the edge of it: but I found it hurried me far- 
ther and farther out from the eddy, which was on 
the left hand. There was no wind stirring to help 
me, and all that I could do with my paddles sig- 
nified nothing: and now I began to give myself 
over for lost; for, as the current was on both sides 
the island, I knew in a few leagues distance they 
must join again, and then I was irrecoverably 
gone; nor did I see any possibility of avoiding it: 
so that I had no prospect before me but of perish- 
ing; not by the sea, for that was calm enough, 
but of starving for hunger, I had indeed found a 
tortoise on the shore, as big almost as I could 
lift, and had tossed it into the boat; and I had a 
great jar of fresh water, that is to say, one of my 
earthen pots: but what was all this to being dri- 
ven into the vast ocean, where, to be sure, there 
was no shore, no main land or island, for a thou- 
sand leagues at least! 

And now I saw how easy it was for the Provi- 
dence of God to make the most miserable condi- 
tion that mankind could be in, worse. Now I 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 183 

looked back upon my desolate solitary island, as 
the most pleasant place in the world, and all the 
happiness my heart could wish for, was to be there 
again. I stretched out my hand to it with eager 
wishes; O happy desert, said I, I shall never see 
thee more! O miserable creature! said I, whither 
am I going! Then I reproached myself with my 
unthankful temper, and how I had repined at my 
solitary condition; and now what would I give to 
be on shore there again i Thus we never see the 
true state of our condition, till it is illustrated to 
us by its contraries; nor know how to value what 
we enjoy, but by the want of it. It is scarce pos- 
sible to imagine the consternation I was now in, 
being driven from my beloved island (for so it ap- 
peared to me now to be) into the wide ocean, al- 
most two leagues, and in the utmost despair of 
ever recovering it again: however, I worked hard, 
till indeed my strength was almost exhausted; and 
kept my boat as much to the northward, that is, 
towards the side of the current which the eddy lay 
on, as possibly I could; when about noon, as the 
sun passed the meridian, I thought I felt a little 
breeze of wind in my face, springing up from the 
S. S. E. This cheared my heart a little, and espe- 
cially when in about half an hour more, it blew a 
pretty small gentle gale. By this time I was got- 
ten at a frightful distance from the island; and, 
had the least cloud or hazy weather intervened, I 
had been undone another way too; for I had no 
compass on board, and should never have known 
how to have steered towards the island, if I had 
but once lost sight of it; but the weather contiuu- 



184 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

ing clear, I applied myelf to get up my mast again, 
and spread my sail, standing away to the north as 
much as possible, to get out of the current. 

Just as I had set my mast and sail, and the boat 
began to stretch away, I saw even by the clear- 
ness of the water, some alteration of the current 
was near; for where the current was so strong, the 
water was foul; but perceiving the water clear, I 
found the current abate, and presently I found to 
the east, at about half a mile, a breach of the sea 
upon some rocks ; these rocks I found caused the 
current to part again; and as the main stress of it 
ran away more southerly, leaving the rocks to the 
north-east, so the other returned by the repulse of 
the rock, and made a strong eddy, which ran back 
again to the north-west with a very sharp stream. 

They who know what it is to have a reprieve 
brought to them upon the ladder, or to be rescued 
from thieves just going to murder them, or who 
have been in such like extremities, may guess 
"what my present surprise of joy was, and how 
gladly I put my boat into the stream of this eddy; 
and the wind also freshening, how gladly I spread 
my sail to it, running cheerfully before the wind, 
and with a strong tide or eddy under foot. 

This eddy carried me about a league in my way 
back again directly towards the island, but about 
two leagues more towards the northward than the 
current lay, which carried me away at first; so 
that when I came near the island, I found myself 
open to the northern shore of it, that is to say, 
the other end of the island, opposite to that which 
I went out from. 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 18$ 

When I had made something more than a league 
of way by the help of this current or eddy, I found 
it was spent, and saved me no farther. However, 
I found, that being between the two great cur- 
rents, viz. that on the south side which had hur- 
ried me away, and that on the north, which lay 
about two leagues on the other side'; I say, be- 
tween these two, in the west of the island, I found 
the water at least still, and running no way; and 
having still a breeze of wind fair for me, I kept on 
steering directly for the island, though not making 
such fresh way as I did before. 

About four o'clock in the evening, being then 
within about a league of the island, I found the 
point of the rocks which occasioned this distance, 
stretching out as is described before, to the south- 
ward, and, casting off the current more southerly, 
had of course made another eddy to the north; 
and this I found very strong, but directly setting 
the way my course lay, which was due west, but 
almost full north. However, having afresh gale, 
I stretched across this eddy, slanting north-west, 
and in about an hour came within about a mile of 
the shore, it being smooth water, I soon got to 
land. 

When I was on shore, I fell on my knees, and 
gave God thanks for my deliverance, resolving to 
lay aside all thoughts of my deliverance by my 
boat; and refreshing myself with such things as I 
had, I brought my boat close to the shore, in a 
little cove that I had espied under some trees, and 
laid me down to sleep, being quite spent with the 
labour and fatigue of the voyage. 



186 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

I was now at a great loss which way to get home 
with my boat; I had run so much hazard, and 
knew too much the case, to think of attempting 
it by the way I went out; and what might be at 
the other side (I mean the west side) I knew not, 
nor had I any mind to run any more ventures; so I 
only resolved in the morning to make my way 
westward along the shore, and to see if there was 
no creek where I might lay up my frigate in safety, 
so as to have her again if I wanted her. In about 
three miles, or thereabouts, coasting the shore, I 
came to a very good inlet, or bay, about a' mile 
over, which narrowed till it came to a very little 
rivulet, or brook, where I found a convenient har- 
bour for my boat, and where she lay as if she had 
been in a little dock made on purpose for her: here 
I put in, and having stowed my boat very safe, I 
went on shore to look about me, and see where I 
was. 

I soon found I had but a little passed by the 
place where I had been before when I travelled on 
foot to that shore; so taking nothing out of my 
boat but my gun and my umbrella, for it was exceed- 
ing hot, I began my march : the way was comforta- 
ble enough after such a voyage as I had been upon, 
and I reached my old bower in the evening, where 
I found every thing standing as I left it; for I 
always kept it in good order, being, as I said be- 
fore, my country-house. 

I got over the fence, and laid me down in the 
shade to rest my limbs, for I was very weary, and 
fell asleep: but judge you, if you can, that read 
my story, what a surprise I must be in, when I 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 187 

was awaked out of my sleep by a voice calling me 
by my name several times, Robin, Robin, Robin 
Crusoe, poor Robin Crusoe! Where are you, Ro- 
bin Crusoe? Where are you? Where have you 
been? 

I was so dead asleep at first, being fatigued with 
rowing, or paddling, as it is called, the first part of 
the day, and walking the latter part, that I did 
not awake thoroughly ; and dozing between sleep- 
ing and waking, thought I dreamed that somebody 
spoke to me: but as the voice continued to repeat 
Robin Crusoe, Robin Crusoe, at last I began to 
awake more perfectly, and was at first dreadfully 
frighted, and started up in the utmost consterna- 
tion: but no sooner were my eyes open, but I saw 
my Poll sitting on the top of the hedge, and im- 
mediately knew that this was he that spoke tome; 
for just in such bemoaning language I had used to 
talk to him, and teach him; and he had learned 
it so perfectly, that lie would sit upon my finger, 
and lay his bill close to my face, and cry, Poor 
Robin Crusoe, Where are you? Where have you 
been? How came you here? — and such things as I 
had taught him. 

However, even though I knew it was the par- 
rot, and that indeed it could be nobody else, it 
was a good while before I could compose myself. 
First, I was amazed how the creature got thither, 
and then how he should just keep about the place, 
and no where else: but as I was well satisfied it 
could be nobody but honest Poll, I got it over; 
and holding out my hand, and calling him by his 
name, Poll, the sociable creature came to me, and 



ISS LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

sat upon my thumb, as he used to do, and continued 
talking to me, Poor Robin Crusoe, and, how did I 
come here? and, where had I been? just as if he 
had been overjoyed to see me again; and so I car- 
ried him home along with me. 

I had now had enough of ra*nbling to sea for 
some time, and had enough to do for many clays 
to sit still, and reflect upon the danger I had been 
in. I would have been very glad to have had my 
boat again on my side of the island, but I knew 
not how it was practicable to get it about. As to 
the east-side of the island, which I had gone round, 
I knew well enough there was no venturing that 
way; my very heart would shrink, and my very 
blood run chill, but to think of it; and to the other 
side of the island, I did not know how it might be 
there; but supposing the current ran with the 
same force against the shore at the east, as it passed 
by it on the other, I might run the same risk of 
being driven down the stream, and carried by the 
island, as I had been before of beins; carried awav 
from it: so with these thoughts I contented my- 
self to be without any boat, though it had been 
the product of so many months labour to make it 
and of so many more to get it into the sea. 

In this government of my temper J remained 
near a year, lived a very sedate retired life, as you 
may well suppose ; and my thoughts being very 
much composed, as to my condition, and fully 
comforted in resigning myself to the dispensations 
of Providence, I thought I lived really very hap- 
pily in all things except that of society. 

1 improved myself, in this time, in all the me- 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 18$ 

chanic exercises which my necessities put me upon 
applying myself to; and I believe could, upon oc- 
casion, have made a very good carpenter, especially 
considering how few tools I had. 

Besides this, I arrived at an unexpected perfec- 
tion in my earthen ware, and contrived well enough 
to make them with a wheel, which I found infi- 
nitely easier and better, because I made things 
round and shapeable, which before were filthy 
things indeed to look on. But I think I never 
was more vain of my own performance, or more 
joyful for any thing I found out, than for my being 
able to make a tobacco-pipe; and though it was a 
very ugly clumsy thing when it was done, and 
only burnt red like other earthen-ware, yet as 
it was hard and firm, and would draw the smoke, 
I was exceeding! v comforted with it; for I had 
been always used to smoke, and there were pipes 
in the ship, but I forgot them at first, not knowing 
there was tobacco in the island; and afterwards, 
when I searched the ship again, I could not come 
at any pipes at all. 

In my wicker-ware I also improved much, and 
made abundance of necessary baskets, as well as 
my invention shewed me, though not very hand- 
some, yet convenient for my laying things up in, 
or fetching things home in. For example, if I 
killed a goat abroad, I could hang it up in a tree, 
flay it, and dress it, and c u tit in pieces, and 
bring it home in a basket; and the like by a tur- 
tle: I could cut it up, take out the eggs, and a 
piece or two of the flesh, which was enough for 
me, and bring them home in a basket, and leave 



190 LIFE AND AD VENTURES 

the rest behind me: also large deep baskets were 
my receivers for my corn, which I always rubbed 
out as soon as it was dry, and cured; and kept it 
in great baskets instead of a granary. 

I began now to perceive my powder abated con- 
siderably; and this was a want which it was im- 
possible for me to supply : then I began seriously 
to consider what I must do when I should have 
no more powder; that is to say, how I should do 
to kill any goats. I had, as I observed, in the 
third year of my being here, kept a young kid, 
and bred her tame; I was in hopes of getting an 
he kid, but I could not by any means bring it to 
pass, till my kid grew an old goat; and I could 
never find in my heart to kill her, till she died at 
last of mere age. 

But being now in the eleventh year of my resi- 
dence, and, as I have said, my ammunition grow- 
ing low, I set myself to study some art to trap 
and snare the goats, to see whether I could not 
catch some of them alive; and particularly I 
wanted a she-^oat great with young. 

To this purpose I made snares to hamper them; 
and believe they were more than once taken in 
them; but my tackle was not good, for I had no 
wire, and always found them broken, and my bait 
devoured. 

At length I resolved to try a pit-fall; so I dug 
several large pits in the earth, in places where I 
had observed the 9:oats used to ieed. and over 
these pits I placed hurdles of my own making too, 
with a great weight upon them; and several times 
I put ears of barley, and dry rice, without setting 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 1<}1 

the trap; and I could easily perceive that the goats 
had gone in, and eaten up the corn, that I could 
see the mark of their feet: at length, I set three 
traps in one night, and going the next morning, 
I found them all standing, and yet the bait eaten 
and gone. This was very discouraging; however, 
I altered my trap; and, not to trouble you with 
particulars, going one morning to see my traps, I 
found in one of them a large old he-goat; and, in 
one of the others, three kids, a male and two 
females. 

As to the old one, I knew not what to do with 
him; he was so fierce 1 durst not go into the pit 
to him; that is to say, to go about to bring him 
away alive, which was w 7 hat I wanted; I could 
have killed him, but that was not my business, 
nor would it answer my end; so I e'en let him 
out, and he ran away as if he had been frightened 
out. of his wits; but I did not then know what I 
afterwards learned, that hunger would tame a 
lion: if I had let him stay there three or four days 
without food, and then have carried him some 
water to drink, and then a little corn, he would 
have been as tame as one of the kids; for they are 
mighty sagacious, tractable creatures, where they 
are well used. 

However, for the present I let him go, knowing 
no better at that time; then I went to the three 
kids; and taking them one by one, I tied them 
with strings together; and with some difficulty 
brought them all home. 

It. was a good while before they would feed; 
but throwing them some sweet corn, it tempted 



i£2 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

them, and they began to be tame: and now I found, 
that if I expected to supply myself with goats- 
flesh, when I had no powder or shot left, breeding 
some up tame was my only way, when perhaps I 
might have them about my house like a flock of 
sheep. 

But then it presently occurred to me, that I 
must keep the tame from the wild, or else they 
would always run wild when they grew up; and 
the only way for this was to have some inclosed 
piece of ground, well fenced either with hedge or 
pale, to keep them up so effectually, that those 
within might not break out, or those without 
break in. 

This was a great undertaking for one pair of 
hands; yet as I saw there was an absolute necessity 
of doing it, my first piece of work was to find out 
a proper piece of ground; viz. where there was 
likely to be herbage for them to eat, water for 
them to drink, and cover to keep them from the 
sun. 

Those who understand such inclosures, will 
think I had very little contrivance, when I pitched 
upon a place very proper for all these, being a plain 
open piece of meadow-land or savanna (as our peo- 
ple call it in the western colonies) which had two 
or three little drills of fresh water in it, and at one 
end was very woody; I say they will smile at my 
forecast, when I shall tell them I began my in- 
closing of this piece of ground in such a manner, 
that my hedge, or pale, must have been at least 
two miles about; nor was the madness of it so 
great as to the compass; for if it was ten miles 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE, 193 

about. I was like to have time enough to do it in; 
but I did not consider, that ray goats would be as 
wild in so much compass, as if they had had the 
whole island; and I should have so much room to 
chase them in, that I should never catch them. 

My hedge was began and carried on, I believe, 
about fifty yards, when this thought occurred to 
me; so I presently stopped short, and for the first 
beginning I resolved to enclose a piece of about 
150 yards in length, and 100 jards in breadth, 
which as it would maintain as many as I should 
have in any reasonable time, so, as my flock in- 
creased, I could add more ground to my enclosure. 

This was acting with some prudence, and I went 
to work with courage. I was about three months 
hedging in. the first piece; and, till I had done it, 
I tethered the three kids in the best part of it, and 
used them to feed as near me as possible, to make 
them familiar; and very often I would go and 
carry them some ears of barley, or an handful of 
rice, and feed them out of my hand; so that after 
my enclosure was finished, and I let them loose, 
they would follow me up and down, bleating after 
me for an handful of corn. 

This answered my end, and in about a year and 
a half I had a flock of about twelve goats, kids 
and all; and in two years more I had three-and- 
forty, besides several that I took and killed for 
my food ; and after that I enclosed five several 
pieces of ground to feed them in, with little pens 
to drive them into, to take them as I wanted them; 
and gates out of one piece of ground into another. 

But this was not all; for now I not only had 
vol. i. o 



194 LIFF AND ADVENTURES 

goat's flesh to feed on when I pleased, but milk 
too, a thing which indeed in my beginning I did 
not so much as think of, and which, when it came 
into my thoughts, was really an agreeable surprise; 
for now I set up my dairy, and had sometimes a 
gallon or two of milk in a day. And as Nature, 
who gives supplies of food to every creature, dic- 
tates even naturally how to make use of it, so I, 
that never milked a cow, much less a goat, or saw 
butter or cheese made, very readily and handily, 
though after a great many essays and miscarriages, 
made me both butter and cheese at last, and never 
wanted it afterwards. 

How mercifully can our great Creator treat his 
creatures, even in those conditions in which they 
seemed to be overwhelmed in destruction! How 
can he sweeten the bitterest providences, and give 
us cause to praise him for dungeons and prisons! 
What a table was here spread for me in a wilder- 
ness, where I saw nothing at first but to perish for 
hunger! 

It would have made a stoic smile, to have seen 
me and my little family sit down to dinner: there 
was my majesty, the prince and lord of the whole 
island; I had the lives of all my subjects at abso- 
lute command; I could hang, draw, give life and 
liberty, and take it away, and no rebels among all 
mv subjects ! 

Then to see how like a king I dined too, all 
alone, attended by my servants! Poll, as if he had 
been my favourite, as the only person permitted 
to talk to me; my dog, which was now grpwn 
very old and crazy, and found no species to niul- 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 195 

tiply his kind upon, sat always at my right hand; 
and two cats, one on one side the table, and one 
on the other, expecting now and then a bit, from 
my hand, as a mark of special favour. 

But these were not the two cats which I brought 
on shore at first; for they were both of them dead, 
and had been interred near my habitation by my 
own hands; but one of them having multiplied by 
I know not what kind of creature, these were two 
which I preserved tame, whereas the rest ran wild 
into the woods, and became indeed troublesome to 
me at last; for they would often come into my 
house, and plunder me too, till at last I was obliged 
to shoot them, and did kill a ^reat manv ; at 
length they left me with this attendance, and in 
this plentiful manner I lived; neither could I be 
said to want any thing but society, and of that, in 
some time after this, I was like to have too much. 

I was something impatient, as I had observed, 
to have the use of my boat, though very loth to 
run anv more hazard: and therefore sometimes I 
sat contriving ways to get her about the island, 
and at other times I sat myself down contented 
enough without her. But I had a strange uneasi- 
ness in my mind to go down to the point of the 
island, where, as I have said in my last ramble, I 
went up the hill to see how the shore lay, and how 
the current set, that I might see what I had to do: 
this inclination increased upon me every day; and 
at length I resolved to travel thither by land, and 
following the edge of the shore, I did so: but had 
any one in England been to meet such a man as I 
was, it must either have frighted them, or raised 

o £ 



196 LTFE AND ADVENTURES 

a great deal of laughter; and as I frequently stood 
still to look at myself, I could not but smile at the 
notion of my travelling through Yorkshire with 
such an equipage, and in such a dress. Be pleased 
to take a sketch of my figure, as follows: 

I had a -great high shapeless cap, made of goat's- 
skin, with a flap hanging down behind, as well to 
keep the sun from me, as to shoot the rain off 
from running into my neck ; nothing being so 
hurtful in these climates, as the rain upon the flesh 
under the clothes. - 

I had a short jacket of goat's- skin, the skirts 
coming down to about the middle of my thighs; 
and a pair of open-kneed breeches of the same: 
the breeches were made of a skin of an old he- 
goat, whose hair hung down such a length on 
either side, that, like pantaloons, it reached to the 
middle of my legs. Stockings and shoes I had 
none; but I had made me a pair of something, I 
scarce knew what to call them, like buskins, to 
flap over my legs, and lace on either side like spat- 
terdashes; but of a most barbarous shape, as indeed 
were all the rest of my clothes. 

I had on a broad belt of goat's-skin dried, which 
I drew together with two thongs of the same, in- 
stead of buckles; and in a kind of frog on either 
side of this, instead of a sword and dagger, hung 
a little saw and a hatchet; one on one side, one 
on. the other: I had another belt not so broad, 
and fastened in the same manner, which hung over 
my shoulder; and at the end of it, under my left 
arm, hung two pouches, both made of goat's skiu 
.too; in one of which hung my powder, in the 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 197 

other my shot: at my back I carried my basket, 
on my shoulder my gun, and over my head a great 
clumsy ugly goat's-skin umbrella, but which, after 
all, was the most necessary thing I had about me, 
next to my gun : as for my face, the colour of it 
was really not so Mulatto like, as one might ex- 
pect from a man not at all careful of it, and living 
within nine or ten degrees of the equinox. My 
beard I had once suffered to grow till it w r as about 
a quarter of a yard long ; but as I had both scis- 
sars and razors sufficient, I had cut it pretty short, 
except what grew on my upper lip, which I had 
trimmed into a large pair of Mahometan whiskers, 
such as I had seen worn by some Turks whom I 
saw at Sallee: for the Moors did not wear such, 
though the Turks did. Of these mustachios, or 
whiskers, I will not say they were long enough to 
hang my hat upon them; but they were of length 
and shape monstrous enough, and such as in En- 
gland would have passed for frightful. 

But all this is by the bye; for as to my figure, 
I had so few to observe me, that it was of no 
manner of consequence; so I say no more to that 
part: in this kind of figure I went my new jour- 
ney, and was out five or six days. I travelled first 
along the sea-shore, directly to the place where I 
first brought my boat to an anchor, to get up upon 
the rocks i and, having no boat now to take care 
of, I went over the land a nearer way, to the same 
height that I was upon before; when looking for- 
ward to the point of the rock which lay out, and 
which I was to double with my boat, as I said 
above, I was surprised to see the sea all smooth 



198 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

and quiet; no rippling, no motion, no current, any 
more there than in other places. 

I was at a strange loss to understand this, and 
resolved to spend some time in the observing of it, 
to see if nothing from the sets of the tide had oc- 
casioned it: but I was presently convinced how it 
was; viz. that the tide of ebb setting from the 
west, and joining with the current of waters from 
some great river on the shore, must be the occasion 
of this current i and that according as the wind 
blew more forcible from the west, or from the 
north, this current came near, or went farther 
from the shore; for, waiting thereabouts till even- 
ing, I went up to the rock again, and then the 
tide of ebb being made, I plainly saw the current 
again as before, only that it ran farther off, being 
near half a league from the shore; whereas in my 
case, it set close upon the shore, and hurried me 
in my canoe along with it, which at another time 
it would not have done. 

This observation convinced me, that I had no- 
thing to do but to observe the ebbing and the 
flowing of the tide, and I might very easily bring 
my boat about the island again: but when I began 
to think of putting it in practice, I had such a ter- 
ror upon my spirits at the remembrance of the dan- 
ger I had been in, that I could not think of it 
again with any patience; but, on the contrary, I 
took up another resolution, which was more safe, 
though more laborious; and this was, that I would 
build, or rather make me another periagua, or 
canoe; and so have one for one side of the island, 
and one for the other. 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 199 

You are to understand, that now I had, as I may 
call it, two plantations in the island; one my little 
fortification or tent, with the wall about it under 
the rock, with the cave behind me, which by this 
time I had enlarged into several apartments or 
caves, one within another. One of these, which 
was the driest and largest, and had a door yet be- 
yond my wall or fortification, that is to say, be- 
yond where my wall joined to the rock, was all 
filled up with large earthen pots, of which I have 
given an account, and with fourteen or fifteen 
great baskets, which would hold five or six bushels 
each, where I laid up my stores of provision, espe- 
cially my corn, some in the ear cut off short from 
the straw, and the other rubbed out with my 
hands. 

As for my wall, made as before, with long stakes 
or piles, those piles grew all like trees, and were 
by this time grown so big, and spread so very 
much, that there was not the least appearance, to 
any one's view, of any habitation behind them. • 

Near this dwelling of mine, but a little farther 
within the land, and upon lower ground, lay my 
two pieces of corn ground; which 1 kept duly 
cultivated and sowed, and which duly yielded me 
their harvest in its season: and whenever I had 
occasion for more corn, I had more land adjoining 
as fit as that. 

Besides this, I had my country-seat, and I had 
now a tolerable plantation there also; for first, I 
had my little bower, as I called it, which I kept 
in repair; that is to say, I kept the hedge which 
circled it in, constantly fitted up to its usual 



200 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

beigKt, the ladder standing always in the inside; i 
kept the trees, which at first were no more than 
my stakes, but were now grown very firm and tall ; 
I kept them always so cut, that they might spread 
and grow thick and wild, and make the more 
agreeable shade, which they did effectually to my 
mind. In the middle of this I had my tent always 
standing, being a piece of a sail spread over poles 
set up for that purpose, and which never wanted 
any repair or renewing; and under this I had 
made me a squab or couch, with the skins of the 
creatures I had killed, and with other soft things, 
and a blanket laid on them, such as belonged to 
our sea-bedding, which I had saved, and a great 
watch-coat to cover me; and here, whenever I had 
occasion to be absent from my chief seat, I took 
up my country habitation. 

Adjoining to this I had my enclosures for my 
cattle, that is to say, my goats: and as I had taken 
an inconceivable deal of pains to fence and enclose 
this ground, I was so uneasy to see it kept entire, 
lest the goats should break through, that I never 
left off, till with infinite labour I had stuck the out- 
side of the hedge so full of small stakes, and so 
near to one another, that it was rather a pale thau 
an hedge, and there was scarce room to put an 
hand through between them, winch afterwards, 
when those stakes grew, as they all did in the 
next rainy season, made the enclosure strong, like 
a wall, indeed stronger than any wall. 

This will testify for me that I was not idle, and 
that I spared no pains to bring to pass whatever 
appeared necessary for my comfortable support;

years; and that keeping them in my reach, de- 
pended entirely upon my perfecting my enclosures 
to such a degree, that I might be sure of keeping 
them together; which by this method indeed I so 
effectually secured, that when these little stakes 
began to grow, i had planted them so very'thick, 
I was forced to pull some of them up again. 

In this place also I had my grapes growing, 
which I principally depended on for my winter 
store of raisins, and which I never failed to pre- 
serve very carefully, as the best and most agreea- 
ble dainty of my whole diet; and indeed they were 
not only agreeable, but physical, wholesome, nou- 
rishing, and refreshing to the last degree. 

As this was also about half way between my 
other habitation and the place where I had laid up 
my boat, I generally staid and lay here in my way 
thither; for I used frequently to visit my boat, 
and I kept all things about or belonging to her in 
very good order: sometimes I went out in her to 
divert myself, but no. more hazardous voyages 
would I go, nor scarce ever above a stone's cast or 
two from the shore, I was so apprehensive of be- 
ing hurried out of my knowledge again by the cur- 
rents, or winds, or any other accident. But now 
I come to a new scene of my life. 

It happened one day about noon, going towards 
my boat, I was exceedingly surprised with the 
print of a man's naked foot on the shore, which 



202 LIFE AND ADVENTURE5 

was very plain to be seen in the sand. I stood like 
one thunderstruck, or as if I had seen an appari- 
tion. I listened, 1 looked round me, I could hear 
nothing, nor see any thing; I went up to a rising 
ground to look farther. I went up the shore, and 
down the shore, but it was all one, I could see no 
other impression but that one. I went to it again 
to see if there were any more, and to observe if it 
might not be my fancy, but there was no room for 
that, for there was exactly the very print of a foot, 
toes, heel, and every part of a foot: how it came 
thither I knew not, nor could in the least imagine. 
But after innumerable fluttering thoughts, like a 
man perfectly confused, and out of myself, I came 
home to my fortification, not feeling, as we say, 
the ground I went on, but terrified to the last de^l 
gree, looking behind me at every two or three 
steps, mistaking every bush and tree, and fancying 
every stump at a distance to be a man; nor is it 
possible to describe how many various shapes an 
affrighted imagination represented things to me 
in; how many wild ideas were formed every mo- 
ment in my fancy, and what strange unaccountable 
whimsies came into my thoughts by the way. 

When I came to my castle, for so I think I called 
it ever after this, I fled into it like one pursued; 
whether T went over by the ladder, as first con- 
trived, or went in at the hole in the rock, which I 
called a door, I cannot remember; for never 
frighted hare fled to cover, or fox to earth, with 
more terror of mind than I to this retreat. 

I had no sleep that night: the farther I was from 
the occasion of my fright, the greater my apprehen- 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 203 

sions were; which is something contrary to the 
nature of such things, and especially to the usual 
practice of all creatures in fear. But I was so em- 
barrassed with mv own frightful ideas of the 
thing, that I formed nothing but dismal imagina- 
tions to mvself even though I was now a sreat 
way off it. Sometimes I fancied it must be the de- 
vil; and reason joined in with me upon this suppo- 
sition. For how should any other thing in human 
shape come into the place? Where was the vessel 
that brought them ? What marks were there of 
any other footsteps ? And how was it possible a 
man should come there? But then to think that 
Satan should take human shape upon him in such 
a place, where there could be no manner of occa- 
sion for it, but to leave the print of his foot behind 
him, and that even for no purpose too (for he 
could not be sure I should see it,) this was an 
amazement the other way. I considered that the 
devil might have found out abundance of other 
ways to have terrified me, than this of the single 
print of a foot. That as I lived quite on the other 
side of the island, he would never have been so 
simple to leave a mark in a place where it was ten 
thousand to one whether I should ever see it or 
not; and in the sand too, which the first surge of 
the sea upon an high wind would have defaced 
entirely. All this seemed inconsistent with the 
thing itself, and with all notions we usually enter- 
tain of the subtlety of the devil. 

Abundance of such things as these assisted to 
argue me out of all apprehensions of its being the 
devil. And I presently concluded that it must be 



204 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

some more dangerous creature; viz. That it mu 
be some of the savages or the main land over 
against me, who had wandered out to sea in their 
canoes, and, cither driven by the currents, or by 
contrary winds, had made the island; and had 
been on shore, but were gone away again to sea, 
being as loth, perhaps, to have staid in this deso- 
late island, as I would have been to have had them. 

While these reflections were rolling upon my 
mind, I was very thankful in my thought, that I 
was so happy as not to be thereabouts at that time, 
or that they did not see my boat, by which they 
would have concluded, that some inhabitants had 
been in the place, and perhaps have searched far- 
ther for me. Then terrible thoughts racked mv 
imaginations about their having found my boa^ 
and that there were people here; and that if so, I 
should certainly have them come again in greater 
numbers, and devour me; that if it should happen 
so that they should not find me, yet they would 
find my enclosure, destroy all my corn, carry away 
all my flock of tame goats, and I should perish at 
last for mere want. 

Thus my fear banished all my religious hope: all 
that former confidence in God, which was founded 
upon such wonderful experience as I had had of 
his goodness, now vanished; as if he that had fed 
me by miracle hitherto, could not preserve by his 
power the provision which he had made for me by 
his goodness. I reproached myself with my uneasi- 
ness, that I would not sow any more corn one year, 
than would just serve me till the next season, as if 
no accident could intervene to prevent my enjoying 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 205 

the crop that was upon the ground. And this I 
thought so just a reproof, that I resolved for the 
future to have two or three years corn Before-hand, 
so- that whatever might come, I might not perish t 
for want of bread. 

How strange a chequer-work of Providence is 
the life of man! And by what secret differing 
springs are the affections hurried about, as differ- 
ing circumstances present! To-day we love what 
to-morrow we hate; to-day we seek what to-mor- 
row we shun; to-day we desire what to morrow we 
fear, nay, even tremble at the apprehensions of. 
This was exemplified in me at this time, in the 
most lively manner imaginable; for I, whose only 
affliction was, that I seemed banished from human 
Pciety, that I was alone, circumscribed by the 
boundless ocean, cut off from mankind, and con- 
demned to what I call a silent life; that I was as 
one whom Heaven thought not worthy to be num- 
bered among the living, or to appear among the 
rest of his creatures; that to have seen one of 
my own species, could have seemed to me a rais- 
ing me from death to life, and the greatest bless- 
ing that Heaven itself, next to the supreme bless- 
ing of salvation, could bestow ; I say, that I should 
now tremble at the very apprehensions of seeing a 
man, and was ready to sink -into the ground, at but 
the shadow, or silent appearance of a man's hav- 
ing set his foot on the island ! 

Such is the uneven state of human life; and it 
afforded me a great many curious speculations 
afterwards, when I had a little recovered my first 
surprise. I considered that this was the station off 



g06 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

life the infinitely wise and good providence of God 
had determined for fliej that as I could not fore- 
see what the ends of divine wisdom might he in all 
this, so I was not to dispute his sovereignty, who, 
as I was his creature, had an undoubted right, by 
creation, to govern and dispose of me absolutely 
as he thought fit; and who, as I was a creature 
who had offended him, had likewise a judicial 
right to condemn me to what punishment he 
thought fit; and that it was my part to submit to 
bear his indignation, because I had sinned against 
him. 

I then reflected, that God, who was not only 
righteous, but omnipotent, as he had thought fit 
thus to punish and afflict me, so he was able to de- 
liver me; that if he did not think fit to do it,V 
was my unquestioned duty to resign myself abso- 
lutely and entirely to his will. And, on the other 
hand, it was my duty also to hope in him, pray to 
him, and quietly to attend the dictates and direc- 
tions of his daily providence. 

These thoughts took me up many hours, days, 
nay, I may say, weeks and months; and one par- 
ticular effect of my cogitations on this occasion I 
cannot omit; viz. one morning early, lying in my 
bed, and filled with thoughts about my danger from 
the appearance of savages, I found it discomposed 
me very much; upon which those words of the 
scripture came into my thoughts, " Call upon me 
in the day of trouble, and I will deliver thee, and 
thou shalt glorify me." 

Upon this, rising chearfully out of my bed, my 
heart was not only comforted, but I was guided- 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 20/ 

and encouraged to pray earnestly to God for deli- 
verance. When I had done praying, I took up 
my bible, and opening it to read, the first words 
that presented to me, were, " Wait on the Lord, 
and be of good cheer, and he shall strengthen thy 
heart: wait, I say, on the Lord." It is impossible 
to express the comfort this gave me; and in return, 
I thankfully laid down the book, and was no more 
sad, at least, not on that occasion. 

In the middle of these cogitations, apprehen- 
sions, and reflections, it came into my thoughts 
one day, that all this might be a mere chimera of 
my own, and that this foot might be the print of 
my own foot, when I came on shore from my boat. 
This cheared me up a little too, and I began to 
Jftrsuade myself it was all a delusion; that it was 
nothing else but my own foot; and why might not 
I come that wav from the boat as well as I was 
going that way to the boat? Again, I considered 
also, that I could by no means tell for certain 
where I had trod, and where I had not; and that, 
if at last this was only the print of my own foot, 
I had played the part of those fools, who strive to 
make stories of spectres and apparitions, and then 
are themselves frighted at them more than any 
body else. 

Now I began to take courage, and to peep 
abroad again ; for I had not stirred out of my cas- 
tle for three days and nights, so that I began to 
starve for provision; for I had little or nothing 
within doors, but some barley-cakes and water. 
Then I knew that my goats wanted to be milked 
too, which usually was my evening diversion; and 
the poor creatures were in great pain and incon- 



208 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

venicncc for want of it; and indeed it almost 
spoiled some of them, and almost dried up their 
milk. 

Heartening mvself therefore with the belief, 
that this was nothing but the print of one of my 
own feet, (and so I might be truly said to start at 
my own shadow,) I began to go abroad again, and 
went to my country-house to milk my ilock; but 
to see with what fear I went forward, how often I 
looked behind me, how I was ready, every now- 
and-then, to lay down my basket, and run for my 
life; it would have made anv one have thought I 
was haunted with an evil conscience, o;\that I had 
been lately most terribly frighted; and so indeed I 
had. 

However, as I went down thus two or thrM 
days, and having seen nothing, I began to be a lit- 
tle bolder, and to think there was really nothing in 
it but my own imagination ; but I could not per- 
suade myself fully of this, till I should go down 
fo the shore again, and see this print of a foot, 
and measure it by my own, and see if there was 
any similitude or fitness, that I might be assured 
it was my own foot. But when I came to the 
place first, it appeared evidently to me, that when 
I laid up my boat, I could not possibly be on shore 
any where thereabouts. Secondly,- when I came 
to measure the mark with mv own foot, I found 
my foot not so large by a great deal. Both these 
things filled my head with new imaginations, and 
gave me the vapours again to the highest degree; 
so that I shook with cold, like one in an ague, and 
I went home again, filled with the belief that some 
man or men had been on shore there; or, in short 






OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 209 

that the island was inhabited, and I might be sur- 
prised before I was aware; and what course to take 
for my security, 1 knew not. 

O what ridiculous resolutions men take, when 
possessed with fear! It deprives them of the use 
of those means which reason offers for their relief. 
The first thing I proposed to myself was, to throw 
down my inclosures, and turn all my tame cattle 
wild into the woods, that the enemy might not 
find them, and then frequent the island in prospect 
of the same, or the tike booty; then to the simple 
thing of digging up my two corn-fields, that they 
might not find such a grain there, and still to be 
prompted to frequent the island; then to demolish 
my bower and tent, that they might not see any 
j#stiges of my habitation, and be prompted to look 
farther, in order to find out the persons inhabiting. 

These were the subjects of the first night's cogi- 
tation, after 1 was come home again, while the ap-> 
prehensions which had so over-run my mind were 
fresh upon me, and my head was full of vapours, 
as above. Thus fear of danger is ten thousand 
times more terrifying than danger itself, when ap- 
parent to the eyes; and we find the burden of 
anxiety, greater by much than the evil which we 
are anxious about; but, which was worse than all 
this, I had not that relief in this trouble from the 
resignation I used to practise that I hoped to have. 
I looked, I thought, like Saul, who complained 
not only that the Philistines were upon him, but 
that God had forsaken him; for I did not now 
take due ways to compose my mind, by crying to 
God in my distress, and resting upon his provi- 

vol. i, p 



210 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

dence, as I had done before, for my defence and 
deliverance; which if I had done, I had at least, 
been more cheerfully supported under this new 
surprise, and perhaps carried through it with more 
resolution. 

This confusion of my thoughts kept me waking 
all night; but in the morning I fell asleep, and 
having by the amusement of my mind been, as it 
were, tired, and my spirits exhausted, I slept very 
soundly, and awaked much better composed than 
I had ever been before. And now I began to think 
sedately; and, upon the utmost debate with my- 
self, I concluded, that this island, which was so 
exceeding pleasant, fruitful, and no farther from 
the main land than as I had seen, was not so en- 
tirely abandoned as I might imagine. That al- 
though there were no stated inhabitants who lived 
on the spot; yet that there might sometimes come 
boats off from the shore, who either with design, 
or perhaps never but when they were driven by 
cross winds, might come to this place. 

That I had lived here fifteen years now, and had 
not met with the least shadow or figure of any 
people before; and that if at any time they should 
be driven here, it was probable they went away 
again as soon as ever they could, seeing they had 
never thought fit to fix there upon any occasion, 
to this time. 

That the most I could suggest any danger from, 
was, from any such casual accidental landing of 
straggling people from the main, who, as it was 
likely, if they were driven hither, were here against 
their wills; so they made no stay here, but went 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE, 211 

off again with all possible speed, seldom staying 
one night on shore, lest they should not have the 
help of the tides and day-light back again; and 
that therefore I had nothing to do but to consider 
of some safe retreat, in case I should see any sa- 
vages land upon the spot. 

Now I begun sorely to repent that I had dug 
my cave so large, as to bring a door through again, 
which door, as I said, came out beyond where my 
fortification joined to the rock. Upon maturely 
considering this, therefore, I resolved to draw me 
a second fortification, in the manner of a semi- 
circle, at a distance from my wall, just where I 
had planted a double row of trees about twelve 
years before, of which I made mention : these trees 
having been planted so thick before, there wanted 
but a few piles to be driven between them, that 
they should be thicker and stronger, and my wall 
would be soon finished. 

So that I had now a double wall, and my outer 
wall was thickened with pieces of timber, old 
cables, and every thing I could think of to make 
it strong; having in it seven little holes, about as 
big as I might put my arm out at. In the inside 
of this I thickened my wall to about ten feet thick, 
continually bringing earth out of my cave, and 
laying it at the foot of the wall, and walking upon 
it; and through the seven holes I contrived to 
plant the muskets, of which I took notice that I 
got seven on shore out of the ship; these, I say, 
I planted like my cannon, and fitted them into 
frames that held them like a carriage, that so I 
eould fire all the seven guns in two minutes time: 

p % 



212 'LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

this wall I was many a weary month in finishing, 
and yet never thought myself safe till it was done. 

When this was done, I stuck all the ground 
without my wall, for a great way every way, as 
full with stakes or sticks of the osier-like wood, 
which I found so apt to grow, as they could well 
stand; insomuch that I believe I might set in near 
twenty thousand of them, leaving a pretty large 
space between them and my wall, that I might 
have room to see an enemy, and they might have 
no shelter from the young trees, if they attempted 
to approach rny outer wall. 

Thus in two years time I had a thick grove; and 
in five or six years time I had a wood before my 
dwelling, grown so monstrous thick and strong, 
that it was indeed perfectly impassable; and no 
man of what kind soever would ever imagine that 
there was any thing beyond it, much less an habi- 
tation: as for the way I proposed myself to go in 
and out (for I left no avenue) it was by setting 
two ladders; one to a part of the rock which was 
low, and then broke in, and left room to place an- 
other ladder upon that; so when the two ladders 
were taken down, no man living could come down 
to me without mischiefing himself; and if they 
had come down, they were still on the outside of 
my outer wall. 

Thus I took all the measures human prudence 
could suggest for my own preservation; and it will 
be seen £t Jength, that they were not altogether 
without just Reason; though I foresaw nothing at 
that time more than my mere fear suggested. 

While this was doing, I was not altogether care- 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE.: $13 

less of my other affairs; for I had a great concern 
upon me for my little herd of goats; they were 
not only a present supply to me upon every occa- 
sion, and began to be sufficient for me, without 
the expense of powder and shot, but also abated 
the fatigue of my hunting after the wild ones; and 
I was loth to lose the advantage of them, and to 
have them all to nurse up over again. 

To this purpose, after long consideration, I could 
think but of two ways to preserve them : one was 
to find another convenient place to dig a cave 
under ground, and to drive them into it every 
night; and the other was to enclose two or three 
little bits of land, remote from one another, and as 
much concealed as I could, where I might keep 
about half a dozen young goats in each place; so 
that if any disaster happened to the flock in gene- 
ral, I might be able to raise them again with little 
trouble and time : and this, though it would re- 
quire a great deal of time and labour, I thought 
was the most rational design. 

Accordingly I spent some time to find out the 
most retired parts of the island; and I pitched 
upon one, which was as private indeed as my heart 
could wish ; for it was a little damp piece of ground 
in the middle of the hollow and thick woods, 
where, as is observed, I almost lost myself once 
before, endeavouring to come back that way from 
the eastern part of the island : here I found a clear 
piece of land, near three acres, so surrounded with 
woods that it was almost an inclosure by nature: 
at least it did not want near so much labour to 



214 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

make it so, as the other pieces of ground I had 
worked so hard at. 

I immediately went to work with this piece of 
ground, and in less than a month's time I had so 
fenced it round, that my flock or herd, call it 
which you please, which were not so wild now as 
at first they might be supposed to be, were well 
enough secured in it. So without any farther de- 
lay, I removed ten she-goats and two he-goats to 
this piece; and when there, I continued to per- 
fect the fence, till I had made it as secure as the 
other, which, however, I did at more leisure, and 
it took me up more time by a great deal. 

All this labour I was at the expense of, purely 
from my apprehensions on the account of the 
print of a man's foot which I had seen; for as yet, 
I never saw any human creature come near the 
island, and I had now lived two years under these 
uneasinesses, which indeed made my life much 
less comfortable than it was before; as mav well 
be imagined, by any who know what it is to 
live in the constant snare of the fear of man: and 
this I must observe with grief too, that the dis- 
composure of my mind had too great impressions 
also upon the religious part of my thoughts : for 
the dread and terror of falling into the hands of 
savages and cannibals lay so upon my spirits, that 
I seldom found myself in a due temper for applica- 
tion to my Maker; at least, not with the sedate 
calmness and resignation of soul which I was wont 
to do. I rather prayed to God as under great 
affliction and pressure of mind, surrounded with 
danger, and in expectation every night of being 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE; £15 

murdered and devoured before the morning; and I 
inust testify from my experience, that a temper of 
peace, thankfulness, love and affection, is much 
more the proper frame for prayer than that of ter- 
ror and discomposure; and that under the dread of 
mischief, impending, a man is no more fit for a 
comforting performance of the duty of praying to 
God, than he is for repentance on a sick-bed; for 
these discomposures affect the mind as the others do 
the body; and the discomposure of the mind must 
necessarily be as great a disability as that of the 
body, and much greater: praying* to God being 
properly an act of the mind, not of the body. 

But to go on: after I had thus secured one part 
of my little living stock, I went about the whole 
island, searching for another private place, to make 
such another deposit; when wandering more to the 
west point of the island than I had ever done yet, 
and looking out to sea, I thought I saw a boat upon 
the sea at a great distance. I had found a per- 
spective glass or two in one of the seamen's chests, 
which I saved out of our ship; but I had it not 
about me; and this was so remote, that I could 
not tell what to make of it, though I looked at it 
till my eyes were not able to look any longer: whe- 
ther it was a boat, or not, I do not know; but as I 
descend from the hill, I could see no more 
of it, so I gave it over; only I resolved to go no 
more without a perspective glass in my pocket. 

When I was come down the hill, to the end of 
the island, where indeed I had never been before, 
I was presently convinced, that the seeing the 
print of a man's foot, was not such a strange thing 
in the island as I imagined; and, but that it was a 



2\() LIFE AND ADYfcNTUllES 

special Providence that I was cast upon the side 
of the island where the savages never came, I 
should easily have known, that nothing was more 
frequent than for the canoes from the main, when, 
they happened to be a little too far out at sea, to 
shoot over to that side of the island for harbour; 
likewise, as they often met and fought in their ca- 
noes, the victors, having taken any prisoners, 
would bring them over to this shore, where, ac- 
cording to their dreadful customs, being all canni- 
bals, they would kill and eat them : of which here- 
after. 

When I was come down the hill to the shore, as 
I said above, being the S. W. point of the island, 
I was perfectly confounded and amazed; nor is it 
possible for me to express the horror of my mind, 
at seeing the shore spread with skulls, hands, feet, 
and other bones of human bodies; and particularly 
I observed a place where there had been a fire 
made, and a circle dug in the earth, like a cock- 
pit, where it is supposed the savage wretches had 
sat down to their inhuman feastings upon the bo-" 
dies of their fellow-creatures. 

I was so astonished with the sight of these 
things, that I entertained no notions of any dan- 
ger to myself from it, for a long while; all my ap- 
prehensions were buried in the thoughts of such a 
pitch of inhuman, hellish brutality, and the horror 
of the degeneracy of human nature; which, though 
X had heard of often, yet I never had so near a 
view of before: in short, I turned away my face 
from the horrid spectacle, my stomach grew sick, 
and I was just at the point of fainting, when na- 
ture discharged the disorder from my stomach, 



OP ROBINSON CRUSOE. 217 

and, having vomited with an uncommon violence^ 
I was a little relieved, but could not bear to stay in 
the place a moment ; so I got me up the hill again 
with all the speed I could, and walked on towards 
my own habitation. 

When I came a little out of that part of the is- 
land, I stood still awhile as amazed; and then re- 
covering myself, I looked up with the utmost af- 
fection of my soul, and, with a flood of tears in my 
eyes, gave God thanks, that had cast my first lot in 
a part of the world where I was distinguished from 
such dreadful creatures as these; and that though 
I had esteemed my present condition very misera- 
ble, had yet given me so many comforts in it, that 
I had still more to give thanks for than to com- 
plain of; and this above all, that I had, even in 
this miserable condition, been comforted with the 
knowledge of himself, and the hope of his bless- 
ing, which was a felicity more than sufficiently 
equivalent to all the misery which I had suffered 
or could suffer. 

In this frame of thankfulness I went home to 
my castle, and began to be much easier now, as to 
the safety of my circumstances, than ever I was 
before; for I observed, that these wretches never 
came to this island in search of what they could 
get; perhaps not seeking, not wanting, or not ex- 
pecting any thing here; and having often, no 
doubt, been up in the covered woody part of it, 
without rinding any thing to their purpose. I 
knew I had been here now almost eighteen years, 
and never saw the least footsteps of a-human crea- 
ture there before; and might be here eighteen 



21S IirE AND ADVENTURES 

more as entirely concealed as I was now, if I did 
not discover myself to them, which I had no man- 
ner of occasion to do, it being my only business 
to keep myself entirely concealed where I was, 
unless I found a better sort of creatures than can- 
nibals to make myself known to. 

Yet I entertained such an abhorrence of the sa- 
vage wretches that I have been speaking t>f, and 
of the wretched inhuman custom of their devour- 
ing and eating one-another up, that I continued 
pensive and* sad, and kept close within my own 
circle for almost two years after this: when I say 
my own circle, I mean by it my three plantations, 
viz. my castle, my country-seat, which I called my 
bower, and my enclosure in the woods; nor did I 
look after this for any other use than as an enclo- 
sure for my goats ; for the aversion which nature 
gave me to these hellish wretches was such, that 
I was as fearful of seeing them as of* seeing the 
devil himself; nor did I so much as go to look 
after my boat in all this time, but began rather to 
think of making me another; for I could not think 
of ever making any more attempts to bring the 
other boat round the island to me, lest I should 
meet with some of those creatures at sea, in which, 
if I had happened to have fallen into their hands, 
I knew what would have been iny lot. 

Time, however, and the satisfaction I had, that 
I was in no danger of being discovered by these 
people, began to wear off my uneasiness about 
them; and I began to live just in the same com- 
posed manner as before; only with this difference, 
that I used more caution, and kept my eyes more 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 219 

about me than I did before, lest I should happen 
to be seen by any of them ; and particularly, I 
was more cautious of firing my gun, lest any of 
them on the island should happen to hear it; and 
it was therefore a very good providence to me, 
that I had furnished myself with a tame breed of 
goats, that I had no need to hunt any more about 
the woods, or shoot at them ; and if I did catch 
any more of them after this, it was with traps and 
snares, as I had clone before: so that for two years 
after this, I believe I never fired my ^un once off, 
though I never went out without it; and, which 
was more, as I had saved three pistols out of the 
ship, I always carried them out with me, or at least 
two of them, sticking them in my goat-skin belt. 
I likewise furbished up one of the great cutlasses 
that I had out of the ship, and made me a belt to 
put it in also; so that I was now a most formida- 
ble fellow to look at when I went abroad, if you 
add to the former description of myself, the par- 
ticular of two pistols, and a great broad-sword 
hanging at my side in a belt, but without a scab- 
bard,. 

Things going on thus, as I have said, for some 
time, I seemed, excepting these cautions, to be re- 
duced to my former calm sedate way of living; 
all these things tended to shew me more and more 
how far my condition was from being miserable, 
compared to some others; nay, to many other par- 
ticulars of life, which it might have pleased God 
to have made my lot. It put me upon reflecting, 
how little repining there would be among man- 
kind, at any condition of life, if people would ra* 



220 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

ther compare their condition with those that are 
worse, in order to be thankful, than be always 
comparing them with those which are better, to 
assist their murmurings and complainings. 

As in my present condition there were not really 
many things which I wanted, so indeed I thought 
that the frights I had been in about these savage 
wretches, and the concern I had been in for my 
own preservation, had taken off the edge of my 
invention for my own conveniences ; and I had 
dropt a good design, which I had once bent my 
thoughts upon ; and that was, to try if I could not 
make some of my barley into malt, and then try to 
brew myself some beer: this was really a whim- 
sical thought, and I reproved myself often for the 
simplicity of it; for I presently saw there would be 
the want of several things necessary to the making 
nvy beer, that it would be impossible for me to sup- 
ply ; as, first, casks to preserve it in, which was 
a thing that, as I have observed already, I could 
never compass; no, though I spent not many days, 
but weeks, nay months, in attempting it, but to 
no purpose. In the next place, I had no hops to 
make it keep, no yeast to make it work, no copper 
or kettle to make it boil; and yet, had not all 
these things intervened, I mean the frights and 
terrors I was in about the savages, I had under- 
taken it, and perhaps brought it to pass too; for I 
seldom gave any thing over without accomplishing 
it, when I once had it in my head enough to be- 
gin it. 

But my invention now ran quite another way; 
for night and day I could think of nothing but 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. <221 

how I might destroy some of these monsters in 
their cruel bloody entertainment, and, if possible, 
save the victim they should bring hither to destroy. 
It would take up a larger volume than this whole 
work is intended to be, to set down all the con- 
trivances I hatched, or rather brooded upon in my 
thoughts, for the destroying these creatures, or at 
least frightening them, so as to prevent their com- 
ing hither any more; but all was abortive; nothing 
could be possible to take effect, unless I was to be 
there to do it myself; and what could one man 
do among them, when perhaps there might be 
twenty or thirty of them together, with their darts, 
or their bows and arrows, with which they could 
shoot as true to a mark as I could with my gun? 

Sometimes I contrived to dig an hole under the 
place where they made their fire, and put in five 
or six pounds of gunpowder, which when they 
kindled their fire, would consequently take fire, 
and blow up all that was near it; but, as in the 
first place I should be very loth to waste so much 
powder upon them, my store being now within the 
quantity of a barrel, so neither could I be sure of 
its going off at any certain time, when it might 
surprise them; and, at best, that it would do little 
more than just blow the fire about their ears, and 
fright them, but not sufficient to make them for- 
sake the place; so I laid it aside, and then pro- 
posed, that I would place myself in ambush, in 
some convenient place, with my three guns all 
double-loaded, and in the middle of their bloody 
ceremony let fly at them, when I should be sure 
to kill or wound perhaps two or three at every 



2S2 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

fchot; and then falling in upon them with my three 
pistols and my sword, I made no douht but that, 
if there were twenty, I should kill them all: this 
fancy pleased my thoughts for some weeks, and I 
was so full of it that I often dreamt of it; and 
sometimes, that I was just going to let fly at them 
in my sleep. 

I went so far with it in my indignation, that I 
employed myself several days to find out proper 
places to put myself in ambuscade, as I said, to 
watch for them; and I went frequently to the 
place itself, which was now grown more familiar 
to me; and especially while my mind was thus 
filled with thoughts of revenge, and of a bloody 
putting twenty or thirty of them to the sword, as 
I may call it; but the horror I had at the place, 
and at the signals of the barbarous wretches de- 
vouring one another, abated my malice. 

Well, at length I found a place in the side of 
the hill, where I was satisfied 1 might securely 
wait till I saw any of the boats coming, and might 
then, even before they would be ready to come on 
shore, convey myself unseen into thickets of trees, 
in one of which there was an hollow large enough 
to conceal me entirely; and where I might sit, 
and observe all their bloody doings, and take my 
full aim at their heads, when they were so close 
together, as that it w r ould be next to impossible 
that I should miss my shoot, or that I could fail 
wounding three or four of them at the first shoot. 

In this place then I resolved to fix my design; 
and accordingly I prepared two muskets and my 
ordinary fowling-piece. The two muskets I loaded 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 2 ( 25 

with a brace of slugs each, and four or five smaller 
bullets, about the size of pistol- bullets, and the 
fowling-piece I loaded with near an handful of 
swan-shot, of the largest size; I also loaded my 
pistols with about four bullets each: and in this 
posture, well provided with ammunition for a 
second and third charge, I prepared myself for 
my expedition. 

After I had thus laid the scheme for my design, 
and in my imagination put it in practice, I conti- 
nually made my tour every morning up to the top 
of the hill, which w r as from my castle, as I called 
it, about three miles or more, to see if I could ob- 
serve any boats upon the sea, coming near the 
island, or standing over towards it; but I began 
to tire of this hard duty, after I had for two or 
three months constantly kept my watch; but came 
always back without any discovery, there having 
not in all that time been the least appearance, not 
only on or near the shore, but not on the whole 
ocean, so far as my eyes or glasses could reach 
every way. 

As long as I kept up my daily tour to the hill to 
look out, so long also I kept up the vigour of my 
design, and my spirits seemed to be all the while 
in a suitable frame for so outrageous an execution, 
as the killing twenty or thirty naked savages, for 
an offence, which I had not at all entered into a 
discussion of in my thoughts, any further than my 
passions were at first fired by the horror I con- 
ceived at the unnatural custom" of the people of 
that country, who, it seems, had been suffered by 
Providence, in his wise disposition of the world, 



224 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

to have no other guide than that of their own abo- 
minable and vitiated passions; and consequently 
were left, and perhaps had been for some ages, to 
act such horrid things, and receive such dreadful 
customs, as nothing but nature, entirely abandoned 
of Heaven, and actuated by some hellish degene- 
racy, could have run them into; but now, when, 
as I have said, I began to be weary of the fruitless 
excursion which I had made so long, and so far, 
every morning in vain; so my opinion of the 
action itself began to alter, and I began, with 
cooler and calmer thoughts, to consider what it 
was I was going to engage in ; what authority or 
call I had to pretend to be judge and executioner 
upon these men as criminals, whom Heaven had 
thought fit for so many ages to suffer, unpunished, 
to go on, and to be, as it were, the executioners 
of his judgments upon one another; also, how far 
these people were offenders against me, and what 
right I had to engage in the quarrel of that blood 
which they shed promiscuously one upon another. 
I debated this very often with myself thus: How 
do I know what God himself judges in this parti- 
cular case? It is certain these people do not com- 
mit this as a crime; it is not against their own 
consciences reproving, or their light reproaching 
them. They do not know it to be an offence, and 
then commit it in defiance of divine justice, as we 
do in almost all the sins we commit. They think 
it no more a crime to kill a captive taken in war, 
than we do to kill an ox; nor to eat human flesh, 
than we do to eat mutton. 

When I had considered this a little, it followed 



OF ROBINSON CllUSOE. 225 

necessarily; that I was certainly in the wrong in 
it; that these people were not murderers in the 
sense that I had before condemned them in my 
thoughts, any more than those Christians were 
murderers, who often put to death the prisoners 
taken in.battle, or more frequently, upon many 
occasions, put whole troops of men to the sword, 
without giving quarter, though they threw down 
their arms and submitted. 

In the next place, it occurred to me, that albeit 
the usage they gave one another was thus brutish 
and inhuman, yet it was really nothing to me: 
these people had done me no injury: that if they 
attempted me, or I saw it necessary for my imme- 
diate preservation to fall upon them, something 
might be said for it; but that I was yet out of 
their pow^r, and they had really no knowledge of 
me, and consequently no design upon me; and 
therefore it could not be just for me to fall upon 
them: that this would justify the conduct of 
the Spaniards, in all their barbarities practised in 
America, where they destroyed millions of these 
people, who, however they were idolaters and bar- 
barians, and had several bloody and barbarous 
rites in these customs, such as sacrificing human 
bodies to their idols, were yet, as to the Spaniards, 
very innocent people; and that the rooting them 
out of the country is spoken of with the utmost 
abhorrence and detestation, even by the Spaniards 
themselves, at this time, and by all other Christian 
nations of Europe, as a mere butchery, a bloody 
and unnatural piece of cruelty, unjustifiable either 
to God or man; and such, as for which the very 

VO£. I. Q 



£26 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

name of a Spaniard is reckoned to be frightful and 
terrible to all people of humanity, or of Christian 
compassion: as if the kingdom of Spain were par- 
ticularly eminent for the product of a race of men, 
who were without principles of tenderness, or tire 
common bowels of pity to the miserable, which is 
reckoned to be a mark of a generous temper in 
the mind. 

These considerations really put me to a pause, 
and to a kind of a full stop; and I began by little 
and little to be off 'of my design, and to conclude 
I had taken a wrong measure in my resolutions to 
attack the savages; that it was not my business 
to meddle with them, unless they first attacked 
me, and this it was my business, if possible, to pre- 
vent; but that, if I were discovered and attacked, 
then I knew my duty. ^ 

On the other hand, I argued with myself, that 
this really was the way, not to deliver myself, but 
entirely to ruin and destroy myself; for unless I 
was sure to kill every one that not only should be 
on shore at that time, but that should ever come 
on shore afterwards, if but one of them escaped 
to tell their country-people what had happened, 
they would come over again by thousands to re- 
venge the death of their fellows; and I should 
only bring upon myself a certain destruction, 
which at present I had no manner of occasion for. 

Upon the whole, I concluded, that neither in 
principles nor in policy, I ought one way or other 
to concern myself in this affair: that my business 
was by all possible means to conceal myself from 
them, and not to leave the least signal to them to 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 987 

guess by, that there were any living creatures upon 
the island, I mean of human shape. 

Religion joined in with this prudential, and I 
was convinced now many ways that I was perfectly 
out of my duty, when I was laying all my bloody 
schemes for the destruction of innocent creatures, 
I mean innocent as to me; as to the crimes they 
were guilty of towards one another, I had nothing 
to do with them ; they were national punishments 
to make a just retribution for national offences; 
and to bring public judgments upon those who 
offend in a public manner, by such ways as best 
please God. 

This appeared so clear to me now, that nothing 
was a greater satisfaction to me, than that I had 
not been suffered to do a thing which I now saw 
so much reason to believe would have been no less 
a sin than that of wilful murder, if I had com- 
mitted it; and I gave most humble thanks on my 
knees to God, that had thus delivered me from 
blood-guiltiness; beseeching him to grant me the 
protection of his Providence, that I might not fall 
into the hands of barbarians; or that I might not 
lay my hands upon them, unless I had a more 
clear call from Heaven to do it, in defence of my 
own life. 

In this disposition I continued for near a year 
after this: and so far was I from desiring an occa- 
sion for falling upon these wretches, that in all 
that time I never once went up the hill to see 
whether there were any of them in sight, or to 
know whether any of them had been on shore 
there, or not; that I might not be tempted to re* 

q 2 



228 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

new any of my contrivances against' them, or be 
provoked, by any advantage which might present 
itself, to fall upon them; only this I did, I went 
and removed my boat, which I had on the other 
side of the island, and carried it down to the east 
end of the whole island, where I ran it into a little 
cove which I found under some high rocks, and 
where I knew, by reason of the currents, the sa- 
vages durst not, at least would not, come with 
their boats, upon any account whatsoever. 

With my boat I carried away every thing that 
I had left there belonging to her, though not ne- 
cessary for the bare going thither; viz. a mast 
and sail, which I had made for her, and a thing 
like an anchor, but indeed, which could not be 
called either anchor or grappling; however, itVas 
the best I could make of its kind. AllAhese I re- 
moved, that there might not be the least shado\r 
of any discovery, or any appearance of any boat, 
or of any habitation upon the island. 

Besides this, I kept myself, as I said, more re- 
tired than ever, and seldom went from my cell, 
other than upon my constant employment, viz. to 
milk my she-goats, and manage my little flock in 
the wood, which, as it was quite on the other part 
of the island, was quite out of danger: for certain 
it is,, that these savage people, who sometimes 
haunted this island, never came with any thoughts 
o{' finding any thing here, and consequently never 
wandered off from the coast; and I doubt not but 
they might have been several times on shore, after 
my apprehensions of them had made me cautious, 
as well as before; and indeed I looked back with 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 229 

some horror upon the thoughts of what my condi- 
tion would have been, if I had chopped upon them, 
and been discovered before that, when naked and 
unarmed, except with one gun, and that loaded 
often onlv with small shot. 1 walked every where 
peeping and peering about the island, to see what 
I could get: what a surprise should I have been 
in, if, when I discovered the print of a man's foot, 
I had instead of that seen fifteen or twenty savages 
and found them pursuing me, and, by the swift- 
ness of their running, no possibility of my escap- 
ing them! 

The thoughts of this sometimes sunk mv very 
soul within me, and distressed my mind so much, 
that I could not soon recover it: to think what I 

o 

should have done, and how I not only should not 
have beei^able to resist them, but even should not 
have had presence of mind enough to do what I 
might have done; much less what now, after so 
much consideration and preparation, I might be 
able to do. Indeed, after serious thinking of 
these things, . I would be very melancholy, and 
sometimes it would last a great while; but I re- 
solved it at last all into thankfulness to that Pro- 
vidence which had delivered me from so many un- 
seen dangers, and had kept me from those mis- 
chiefs, which I could no wav have been the ao;ent 
in delivering myself from: because I had not the 
least notion of any such thing depending, or the 
least supposition of its being possible. 

This renewed a contemplation, which often had 
come to my thoughts in former time, when first I 
began to sec the merciful dispositions of Heaven, 



230 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

in the dangers we run through in this life; how 
wonderfully we are delivered when we know no- 
thing of it: how, when we are in a quandary (as 
we call it) a doubt or hesitation, whether to go 
this way or that way, a secret hint shall direct us 
this way, when we intended to go another way; 
nay, when sense, our own inclination, and perhaps 
business, has called to go the other way, yet a 
strange impression upon the mind, from we know 
not what springs, and by we know not what power, 
shall over-rule us to go this way; and it shall af- 
terwards appear, that had we gone that way which 
we would have gone, and even to our imagination 
ought to have gone, we should have been ruined 
and lost. Upon these, and many like reflections, I 
afterwards made it a certain rule with me, that 
whenever I found those secret hints, 01* pressings 
of my mind, to doing or not doing any thing that 
presented, or to going this way or that way, I 
never failed to obey the secret dictate j though I 
knew no other reason for it, than that sucli a pres- 
sure, or such an hint, hung upon my mind. I 
could give many examples of the success of this 
conduct in the course of my life ; but more espe- 
cially in the latter part of my inhabiting this un- 
happy island; besides many occasions which it i$ 
very likely I might have taken notice of, if I had 
seen with the same eyes then that I saw with now. 
But it is never too late to be wise; and I cannot 
but advise all considering men, whose lives are at- 
tended with such extraordinary incidents as mine, 
or even though not so extraordinary, not to slight 
such secret intimations of Providence, let them 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOEc 231 

come from what invisible intelligence they will. 
That I shall not discuss, and perhaps cannot ac- 
count for; but certainly they are a proof of the 
converse of spirits, and the secret communication 
between those embodied, and those unembodied; 
and such a proof as can never be withstood; of 
which I shall have occasion to give some very re- 
markable instances, in the remainder of my soli- 
tary residence in this dismal place. 

I believe the reader of this will not think it 
strange, if 1 confess that these anxieties, these 
constant dangers I lived in, and the concern that 
was now upon me, put an end to all invention, and 
to all the contrivances that I had laid for my fu- 
ture accommodations and conveniences. I had 
the care of my safety more now upon my hands 
than tha%of my food. I cared not to drive a nail, 
or chop a stick of wood now, for fear the noise I 
should make should be heard; much less would I 
fire a gun, for the same reason ; and above all, I 
was very uneasy at making any fire, lest the 
smoke, which is visible at a great distance in the 
day, should betray me: and for this reason I re- 
moved that part of my business, which required 
fire, such as burning of pots and pipes, &c. into 
my new apartment in the wood; where, after I 
had been some time, I found, to my unspeakable 
consolation, a mere natural cave in the earth, 
which went in a vast way, and where, I dare say, 
no savage, had he been at the mouth of it, would 
be so hardy as to venture in, nor indeed would 
any man else, but one who, like me, wanted no- 
thing so much as a safe retreat. 



232 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

The mouth of this hollow was at the bottom of 
a great rock, where by mere accident (I would 
say, if I did not see an abundant reason to ascribe 
all such thing's now to Providence), I was cut- 
ting down some thick branches of trees to make 
charcoal; and before I go on, I must observe the 
reason of my making this charcoal, which was 
thus : 

I was afraid of making a smoke about my ha- 
bitation, as I said before; and yet I could not live 
there without baking my bread, cooking my meat, 
&c. so I contrived to burn some wood here, as I 
had seen done in England under turr, tilt it became 
chark, or dry coal; and then putting the fire out, 
I preserved the coal to carry home, and perform 
the other services which fire was wanting for at 
home, without any danger of smoke. ^ 

But this by. the bye. While I was cutting down 
some wood here, I perceived that behind a very 
thick branch of low brushwood, or underwood, there 
was a kind of hollow place. I was curious to look 
into it, and getting with difficulty into the mouth 
of it, I found it was pretty large, that is to say, 
sufficient for me to stand upright in it, and per- 
haps another with me; but I must confess to you, 
I made more haste out than I did in; when look- 
ing farther into the place, which was perfectly 
dark, I saw two broad shining eyes of some crea- 
ture, whether devil or man I knew not, which 
twinkled like two stars, the dim light from the 
cave's mouth shining directly in, and making the 
reflection. 

However, after some pause, I recovered myself, 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 233 

and began to call myself a thousand fools, and tell 
myself, that he that was afraid to see the devil, was 
not fit to live twenty years in an island all alone, 
and that I durst to believe there was nothing in 
this cave that was more frightful than myself: 
upon this, plucking up my courage, I took up a 
large firebrand, and in I rushed again, with the 
stick flaming in my hand. I had not gone three 
steps in, but I w r as almost as much frightened as 
I was before; for I heard a very loud sigh, like 
that of a man in some pain; and it was followed 
by a broken noise, as if of words half-expressed, 
and then a deep sigh again. I stepped back, and 
was indeed struck with such a surprise, that it put 
me into a cold sweat; and if I had had an hat on 
my head, I will not answer for it that my hair 
might not have lifted it off. But still, plucking 
up my spirits as well as I could, and encouraging 
myself a little, with considering that the power 
and presence of God was every- where, and was 
able to protect me; upon this I stepped forward 
again, and by the light of the firebrand, holding it 
up a little over my head, I saw lying on the ground 
a most monstrous frightful old he-goat, just mak- 
ing his will, as we say, gasping for life, and dying 
indeed of mere old ao-e. 

I stirred him a little to see if I could get him 
out, and he essayed to get up, but was not able 
to raise himself; and I thought with mvself, he 
might even lie there; for if he had frightened me 
so, he would certainly fright any of the savages, if 
any of them should be so hardy as to come in there, 
while he had anv life in him. 



£34 LIFE AND ADVENTUIltS 

I was now recovered from my surprize, and be- 
gan to look round me, when I found the cave was 
but very small; that is to say, it might be about 
twelve feet over, but in no manner of shape, either 
lound or square, no hands ever having been em- 
ployed in making it but those of mere nature. I 
observed also, that there was a place at the farther 
side of it that went in farther, but so low, that it 
required me to creep upon my hands and knees 
to get into it, and whither it went, I knew not; so 
having no candle, I gave it over for some time, 
but resolved to come again the next day, provided 
with candles and a tinder box, which I had made 
of the lock of one of the musquets, with some wild- 
fire in the pan. 

Accordingly, the next day, I came provided 
with six large candles of my own making (for I 
made very good candles now of goats tallow); and 
going into this low place, I was obliged to creep 
upon all fours, as I have said, almost ten yards; 
which, by the way, I thought was a venture bold 
enough, considering that I knew not how far it 
might go, or what was beyond it. When I was 
got through the streight, I found the roof rose 
higher up, I believe near twenty feet; but never 
was such a glorious sight seen in the island, I dare 
say, as it was, to look round the sides and roof of 
this vault or cave. The walls reflected an hundred 
thousand lights to me from my two candles: what 
it was in the rock, vvhether diamonds, or any other 
precious stones, or gold, which I rather suppose it 
to be, I knew not.* 

The place I was in was a most delightful cavity, 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 235 

or grotto, of its kind, as could be expected, though 
perfectly dark; the floor was dry and level, and 
had a sort of small loose gravel upon it; so that 
there was no nauseous creature to be seen; nei- 
ther was there any damp or wet on the sides of 
the roof; the only difficulty in it was the en- 
trance, which, however, as it was a place of secu- 
rity, and such a retreat as I wanted, I thought 
that was a convenience; so that I was really re- 
joiced at the discovery, and resolved, without any 
delay, to bring some of those things which I was 
most anxious about to this place; particularly, I 
resolved to bring hither my magazine of powder, 
and all my spare arms, viz. two fowling-pieces (for 
I had three in all) and three musquets (for of them 
I had eight in all); so I kept at my castle only five, 
which stood ready mounted, like pieces of cannon> 
on my outmost fence, and were ready also to take 
out upon any expedition. 

Upon this occasion of removing my ammunition, 
I was obliged to open the barrel of powder which 
I took up out of the sea, and which had been wet; 
and I found that the water had penetrated about 
three or four inches into the powder on every side, 
which, caking and growing hard, had preserved 
the inside like a kernel in a shell; so that I had 
near sixty pounds of very good powder in the cen- 
tre of the cask; and this was an agreeable disco- 
very to me at that time; so I carried all away thi- 
ther, never keeping above two or three pounds of 
powder with me in my castle, for fear of a sur- 
prise of any kind. I also carried thither all the 
lead I had left for the bullets, 



236 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

I fancied myself now like one of the ancient 
giants, which were said to live in caves and holes 
in the rock, where none could come at them; for 
I persuaded myself while I was here, if five hun- 
dred savages were to hunt me, they could never 
find me out; or if they did, they would not ven- 
ture to attack me here. 

The old goat, which' I found expiring, died in 
the mouth of the cave the next day after I made 
this discovery; and I found it much easier to dig 
a great hole there, and throw him in, and cover 
him with earth, than to drag him out; so I interred 
him there, to prevent offence to my nose. 

I was now in my twenty-third year of residence 
in this island, and was so naturalized to the place, 
and to the manner of living, that could I have but 
enjoyed the certainty that no savages would come 
to the place to disturb me, I could have been con- 
tent to have capitulated for spending the rest of 
my time there, even to the last moment, till I had 
laid me down and died, like the old goat in the 
cave. I had also arrived to some little diversions 
and amusements, which made the time pass more 
pleasantly with me a great deal than it did before; 
as, first, I had taught my Poll, as I noted before, 
to speak; and he did it so familiarly, and talked 
so articulately and plain, that it was very pleasant 
to me; and he lived with me no less than six-and- 
twenty years: how long he might live afterwards 
I knew not; though I know they have a notion in 
the Brasils, that they live an hundred years; per- 
haps some of myPolls may be alive there still, call- 
ing after poor Robin Crusoe to this day; I wish 



OF HOEINSON CRUSOE. 237 

no Englishman the ill luck to come there and hear 
them; but if he did, he would certainly believe jt 
was the devil. My dog was a very pleasant and 
loving companion to me for no less than sixteen 
vears of mv time, and then died of mere old a<re: 
as for my cats, they multiplied, as I have observed, 
to that degree, that I was obliged to shoot several 
of them at first, to keep them from devouring me 
and all I had; but at length, when the two old 
ones I brought with me were gone, and after some 
time continually driving them from me, and let- 
ting them have no provision with me, they all ran 
wild into the woods, except two or three fa- 
vourites, which I kept tame, and whose young, 
when they had any, I always drowned, and these 
were part of my family. Besides these, I always 
kept two or three household kids about me, which 
I taught to feed out of my hand; and I had also 
more parrots which talked pretty well, and would 
all call Robin Crusoe, but none like my first; nor, 
indeed, did I take the pains with any of them that 
I had done with him. I had also several tame sea- 
fowls, whose names I know not, which I caught 
upon the shore, and cut their wings ; and the lit- 
tle stakes, which I had planted before my castle 
wall, being now grown up to a good thick grove, 
these fowls all lived among these low trees, and 
bred there, which was very agreeable to me; so 
that, as I said above, I began to be very well con- 
tented with the life I led, if it might but have 
been secured from the dread of savages. 

But it was otherwise directed; and it might not 
be amiss for all people who shall meet with my 



238 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

story to make this just observation from it, viz. 
How frequently, in the course of our lives, the 
evil which in itself we seek most to shun, and 
which, when we are fallen into, is the most dread- 
ful to us, is oftentimes the very means or door of 
our deliverance, by which alone we can be raised 
again from the affliction we are fallen into. I 
could give man}' examples of this in the course of 
my unaccountable life; but in nothing was it more 
particularly remarkable, than in the circumstances 
of my last years of solitary residence in this 
island. 

It was now the month of December, as I said 
above, in my twenty-third year; and this being the 
southern solstice, for winter 1 cannot call it, was 
the particular time of my harvest, and required my 
being pretty much abroad in the fields; when go- 
ing out pretty early in the morning, even before 
it was thorough day-light, I was surprised with 
seeing a light of some fire upon the shore, at a dis- 
tance from me of about two miles, towards the 
end of the island, where I had observed some sa- 
vages had been, as before; but not on the other 
side: but to my great affliction, it was on my side 
of the island. 

I was indeed terribly surprised at the sight, and 
stopped short within my grove, not daring to go 
out, lest I might be surprised; and yet I had no 
more peace within, from the apprehensions I had, 
that if these savages, in rambling over the island, 
should find my corn standing, or cut, or any of my 
works and improvements, they would immediately 
conclude that there were people in the place, and 



OF ROBINSON CKUSOE. £3<) 

would then nevej give over till they found me out* 
In this extremity I went back directly to my cas- 
tle, pulled up the ladder after me, having made all 
things without look as wild and natural as I could, 

Then I prepared myself within, putting myself 
in a posture of defence. I loaded all my cannon, 
as I called them, that is to say, my musquets, 
which were mounted upon my new fortification, 
and all my pistols, and resolved to defend myself 
to the last gasp; not forgetting seriously to re- 
commend myself to the divine protection, and ear- 
nestly to pray to God to deliver me out of the 
hands of the barbarians; and in this posture I con- 
tinued about two hours, but began to be mighty im- 
patient for intelligence abroad, for I had no spies 
to send out. 

After sitting a while longer, and musing what I 
should do in this case, I was not able to bear sit- 
ting in ignorance longer; so setting up my ladder 
to the side of the hill, where there was a flat 
place, as I observed before, and then pulling the 
ladder up after me, I set it up again, and mounted 
to the top of the hill; and pulling out my perspec- 
tive glass, which I had taken on purpose, I laid me 
do\vn flat on my belly on the ground, and began 
to look for the place. I presently found there 
were no less than nine naked savages sitting round 
a small fire they had made; not to warm them, 
for they had no need of that, the weather being 
extreme hot; but, as I supposed, to dress some of 
their barbarous diet of human flesh which they 
had brought with them, whether alive or d^d I 
could not knc 



240 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

They had two canoes with them, which they had 
hauled up upon the shore; and as it was then tide 
of ebb, they seemed to me to wait the return of 
the flood to go away again. It is not easy to ima- 
gine what confusion this sight put me into, espe- 
cially seeing them come on my side the island, and 
so near me, too; but when I observed their coming 
must be always with the current of the ebb, I be- 
gan afterwards to be more sedate in my mind, 
being satisfied that I might go abroad with safety 
all the time of tide of flood, if they were not on 
shore before; and having made this observation, I 
went abroad about my harvest work with the 
more composure. 

As I expected, so it proved; for as soon as the 
tide made to the westward, I saw them all take 
boat, and row (or paddle as we call it) all away. 
I should have observed, that for an hour and more 
before they went off, they went to dancing, and 
I could easily discern their postures and gestures 
by my glasses : I could only perceive, by my 
nicest observation, *that they were stark naked, 
and had not the least covering upon them; but 
whether they were men or women, that I could 
not distinguish. 

As soon as I saw them shipped and gone, I took 
two guns upon my shoulders, and two pistols at my 
girdle, and my great sword by my side, without a 
scabbard; and with all the speed I was able to 
make, I went away to the hill, where I had disco- 
vered the first appearance of all. As soon as I got 
thither, which was not less than two hours (for 
I could not go apace, being so loaded with arms 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 241 

as I was), I perceived there had been three canoes 
more of savages on that place; and looking out 
farther, I saw they were all at sea together, mak- 
ing over for the main. 

This was a dreadful sight to me, especially, when 
going down to the shore, I could see the marks 
of horror which the dismal work they had been 
about had left behind it, viz. the blood, the bones, 
and part of the flesh of human bodies, eaten and 
devoured by those wretches with merriment and 
sport. I was so filled with indignation at the sight, 
that I began now to premeditate the destruction of 
the next that I saw there, let them be who or how 
many soever. 

It seemed evident to me, that the visits which 
they thus made to this island were not very fre- 
quent; for it was above fifteen months before any 
more of them came on shore there again; that is 
to say, I never saw them, or any footsteps or sig- 
nals of them, in all that time; for as to the rainy 
seasons, then they are sure not to come abroad, at 
least not so far: yet all this while I lived uncom- 
fortably, by reason of the constant apprehensions I 
was in of their coming upon me by surprize; from 
whence I observe, that the expectation of evil is 
more hitter than the suffering, especially if there 
is no room to shake oft' that expectation or those 
apprehensions. 

During all this time, I was in the murdering 
humour; and took up most of my hours, which 
should have been better employed, in contriving 
how to circumvent and fall upon them the very 
next time I should see them; especially if they 
Vol. i. r 



242 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

should be divided, as they were the last time, into 
two parties; nor did I consider at all, that if I 
killed one party, suppose ten or a dozen, I was 
still the next day, or week, or month, to kill 
another, and so another, even ad infinitum, till I 
should be at length no less a murderer than they 
were in being men-eaters, and perhaps much 
more so. 

I spent my days now in great perplexity and 
anxiety of mind, expecting that I should one day 
or other fall into the hands of those merciless 
creatures. If I did at any time venture abroad, it 
was not without looking round me with the great- 
est care and caution imaginable; and now I found, 
to my great comfort, how happy it was that I had 
provided a tame flock or herd of goats; for I durst 
not, upon any account, fire my gun, especially near 
that side of the island where they usually came, 
lest I should alarm the savages; and if they had 
fled from me now, I was sure to have them come 
back again, with perhaps two or three hundred 
canoes with them in a few days, and then I knew 
what to expect. 

However, I wore out a year and three months 
more before I ever saw any more of the savages, 
and then I found them again, as I shall soon ob- 
serve. It is true, they might have been there once 
or twice, but either they made no stay, or, at least, 
I did not hear them; but in the month of May, as 
near as I could calculate, and in my four-and-twen- 
tieth year, I had a ver)i strange encounter with 
them, of which in its place. 

The perturbation of my mind, during this fifteen 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 243 

or sixteen months interval, was very great; I slept 
unquiet, dreamed always frightful dreams, and 
often started out of my sleep in the night: in the 
day great troubles overwhelmed my mind; in the 
night I dreamed often of killing the savages, and 
the reasons why I might justify the doing of it. 
But to wave all this for a while, it was the middle 
of May, on the sixteenth day, I think, as well as 
my [poor wooden calendar would reckon, for I 
marked all upon the post still ; 1 say, it was on the 
sixteenth of May, that it blew a great storm of 
wind all day, with a great deal of lightning and 
thunder, and a very foul night was after it. I 
know not what was the particular occasion of it: 
but as I was reading in the bible, and taken up 
with serious thoughts about my present condition, 
I was surprised with the noise of a gun, as I 
thought, fired at sea. 

This was, to be sure, a surprise of a quite dif- 
ferent nature from any I had met with before; for 
the notions this put into my thoughts were quite 
of another kind. I started up in the greatest haste 
imaginable ; and in a trice clapped up my ladder 
to the middle place of the rock, and pulled it after 
me, and mounting it the second time, got to the 
top of the hill; that very moment a flash of fire 
bade me listen for a second gun, which accord- 
ingly in about half a moment I heard, and by the 
sound knew that it was from that part of the sea 
where I was driven out with the current in my 
boat 

I immediately considered that this must be some 
ship in distress, and that they had some comrade, 

RS 



244 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

or some other ship in company, and fired these 
guns for signals of distress, and to obtain help. I 
had this presence of mind at that minute as to 
think, that though I could not help them, it may 
be they might help me: so I brought together all 
the dry wood I could get at hand, and making a 
good handsome pile, I set it on fire upon the hill: 
the wood was dry, and blazed freely, and though 
the wind blew very hard, yet it burnt fairly out, 
so that I was certain, if there was any such thing 
as a ship, they must needs see it, and no doubt they 
did; for as soon as ever my fire blazed up, I heard 
another gun, and after that several others, all from 
the same quarter. I plied my fire all night long, 
till day broke; and when it was broad day, and 
the air cleared up, I saw something at a great dis- 
tance at sea, full east of the island; whether a sail 
or an hull I could not distinguish, no, not with 
my glasses, the distance was so great, and the wea- 
ther still something hazy also; at least it was so 
out at sea. 

I looked frequently at it all that day, and soon 
perceived that it did not move; so I presently 
concluded that it was a ship at anchor; and being 
eager, you may be sure, to be satisfied, I took my 
gun in my hand, and ran towards the south-east 
side of the island, to the rocks, where I had been 
formerly carried away with the current; and get- 
ting up there, the weather by this time being per- 
featly clear, I could plainly see, to my great sor- 
row, the wreck of a ship cast away in the night 
upon ihose concealed rocks which I found when 
I was out in my boat; and which rocks, as they 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 245 

checked the violence of the stream, and made a 
kind of counter-stream, or eddy, were the occa- 
sion of my recovering then from the most despe- 
rate, hopeless condition, that ever I had been in 
all my life. 

Thus, what is one man's safety is another man's 
destruction; for it seems these men, whoever they 
were, being out of their knowledge, and the rocks 
being wholly under water, had been driven upon 
them in the night, the wind blowing hard at E. 
and E. N.E.. Had they seen the island, as I must 
necessarily suppose they did not, they must, as I 
thought, have endeavoured to have saved them- 
selves on shore by the help of their boat; but the 
firing of their guns for help, especially when they 
saw, as I imagined, my fire, filled me with mauy 
thoughts: first, I imagined, that, upon seeing my 
light, they might have put themselves into their 
boat, and have endeavoured to make the shore; 
but that the sea going very high, they might have 
been cast away: other times I imagined, that they 
might have lost their boat before, as might be the 
case many ways ; as particularly, by the breaking 
of the sea upon their ship, which many times 
obliges men to stave, or take in pieces their boat; 
and sometimes to throw it overboard with their 
own hands; other times I imagined, they had 
some other ship or ships in Company, who, upon 
the signals of distress they had made, had taken 
them up, and carried them off; otherwhiles I fan- 
cied they were all gone off to sea in their boat, and 
being hurried away by the current that I had been 
formerly in, were carried out into the great ocean, 



246 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

where there was nothing but misery and perishing; 
and that perhaps they might by this time think of 
starving, and of being in a condition to eat one 
another. 

As all these were but conjectures at best, so, in 
the condition I was in, I could do no more than 
look upon the misery of the poor men, and pity 
them; which had still this good effect on my side, 
that it gave me more and more cause to give thanks 
to God, who had so happily and comfortably pro- 
vided for me in my desolate condition; and that 
of two ships companies, who were now cast away 
upon this part of the world, not one life should 
be spared but mine. I learned here again to ob- 
serve, that it is very rare that the providence of 
God casts us into any condition of life so low, or 
any misery so great, but we may see something or 
other to be thankful for, and may see others in 
worse circumstances than our own. 

Such certainly was the case of these men, of 
whom I could not so much as see room to suppose 
any of them were saved ; nothing could make it 
rational, so much as to wish or expect that they 
did not all perish there, except the possibility 
only of their being taken up by another ship in 
company: and this was but mere possibility in- 
deed; for I saw not the least signal or appearance 
of any such thing. 

I cannot explain, by any possible energy of 
words, what a strange longing, or hankering of 
desire, I felt in my soul upon this sight; breaking 
out sometimes thus: O that there had been but 
one or two, nay, but one soul saved out of the ship, 



OF ROBIXSON CRUSOE. 247 

to have escaped to me, that I might but have had 
one companion, one fellow-creature to have spoken 
tome, and to have conversed with! In ail the time 
of my solitary life, I never felt so earnest, so strong 
a desire after the society of my fellow-creatures, 
or so deep a regret at the want of it. 

There are some secret moving springs in the 
affections, which, when they are set a going by 
some object in view, or be it some object though 
not in view, yet rendered present to the mind by 
the power of imagination, that motion carries out 
the soul by its impetuosity to such violent eager 
embracings of the object, that the absence of it is 
insupportable. 

Such were these earnest wishings, That but one 
man had been saved! O that it had been but one! 
I believe I repeated the words, O that it had been 
but one! a thousand times; and my desires were 
so moved by it, that when I spoke the words, my 
hands would clinch together, and my fingers press 
the palms of my hands, that if I had had any soft 
thing in my hand, it would have crushed it invo- 
luntarily; and my teeth in my head would strike 
together, and set against one another so strong, 
that for some time I could not part them again. 

Let the naturalists explain these things, and the 
reason and manner of them: all lean say of them 
is, to describe the fact, which was ever surprising 
to me when I found it, though I knew not from 
what it should proceed; it was doubtless the effect 
of ardent wishes, and of strong ideas formed in 
my mind, realizing the comfort which the conver- 



248 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

sation of one of my fellow-christians would have 
been to me. 

But it was not to be; either their fate, or mine, 
or both, forbad it ; for till the last year of my being 
on this island, I never knew whether auy were 
saved out of that ship, or no; and had only the 
affliction some days after to see the corpse of a 
drowned bov come on shore, at the end of the 
island which was next the shipwreck: he had on 
no clothes but a seaman's waistcoat, a pair of open 
kneed linen drawers, and a blue linen shirt; but 
nothing to direct me so much as to guess what 
nation he was of: he had nothing in his pocket 
but two pieces of eight, and a tobacco-pipe; the 
last was to me of ten times more value than the 
first. 

It was now calm, and I had a great mind to 
venture out in my boat to this wreck, not doubt- 
ins: but I might find something on board that 
might be useful to me; but that did not altoge- 
ther press me so much, as the possibility that there 
might be yet some living creature on board, whose 
life I might not only save, but might, by saving 
that life, comfort my own to the last degree: and 
this thought clung so to my heart, that I could 
not be quiet night nor day, but I must venture 
out in my boat on board this wreck; and commit- 
ting the rest to God's providence, I thought the 
impression was so strong upon my mind, that it 
could not be resisted, that it must come from some 
invisible direction, and that I should be wanting 
to myself if I did not go. 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 249 

Under the power of this impression, I hastened 
back to my castle, prepared every thing for my 
voyage, took a quantity of bread, a great pot for 
fresh water, a compass to steer by, a bottle of rum 
(for I had still a great deal of that left,) a basket- 
full of raisins: and thus loading myself with every 
thing necessary, 1 went down to my boat, got the 
water out of her, and got her afloat, loaded all my 
cargo in her, and then went home again for more: 
my second cargo was a great bag- full of rice, the 
umbrella to set up over my head for shade, an- 
other large pot-full of fresh water, and about two 
dozen of my small loaves, or barley cakes, more 
than before, with a bottle of goat's milk, and a 
cheese; all which, with great labour and sweat, I 
brought to my boat; and praying to God to direct 
my voyage, I put out, and rowing or paddling the 
canoe along the shore, I came at last to the utmost 
point of the island, on that side, viz. N. E. And 
now I was to launch out into the ocean, and either 
to venture, or not to venture; I looked on the 
rapid currents which ran constantly on both sides 
of the island, at a distance, and which were very 
terrible to me, from the remembrance of the hazard 
I had been in before, and my heart began to fail 
me; for I foresaw, that if I was driven into either 
of those currents, I should be carried a vast way 
out to sea, and perhaps out of my reach or sight 
of the island again; and that then, as my boat was 
but small, if any little gale of wind should rise, I 
should be inevitably lost. . 

These thoughts so oppressed my mind, that I 
began to give over my enterprise; and having 



250 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

haled my boat into a little creek on the shore, I 
stepped out, and sat me down upon a little spot of 
rising ground, very pensive and anxious, between 
fear and desire, about my voyage; when, as I was 
musing, I could perceive that the tide was turned, 
and the flood came on, upon which my going was 
for so many hours impracticable: upon this it pre- 
sently occurred to me, that I should go up to the 
highest piece of ground I could find, and observe, 
if I could, how the sets of the tide or currents lay^ 
when the flood came in, that I might judge whe- 
ther, if I was driven one way out, I might not 
expect to be driven another way home, with the 
same rapidness of the currents. This thought was 
no sooner in my head, but I cast my eyes upon a 
little hill which sufficiently overlooked the sea both 
ways, and from whence I had a clear view of the 
currents, or sets of the tide, and which way I was 
ta guide myself in my return: here I found, that as 
the current of the ebb- set out close by the south 
point of the island, so the current of the flood set 
in close by the shore of the north-side; and that I 
had nothing to do but to keep to the north of the 
island in my return, and I should do well enough. 

Encouraged with this observation, I resolved 
the next'morning to set out with the first of the 
tide; and reposing myself for that night in the 
canoe, under the great watch-coat I mentioned, I 
launched out. 1 made first a little out to sea, full 
north, till I began to feel the benefit of the cur- 
rent, which set eastward, and which carried me at 
a great rate, and yet did not so hurry me as the 
southern-side current had done before, and so a? 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 251 

to take from me all government of the boat; but 
having a strong steerage with my paddle, I went, 
I say, at a great rate, directly for the wreck, and 
in less than two hours I came up to it. 

It was a dismal sight to look at: the ship, which 
by its building was Spanish, stuck fast, jambed in 
between two rocks; all the stern and quarter of her 
was beaten to pieces with the sea; and as her fore- 
castle, which stuck in the rocks, had run on with 
great violence, her main -mast and fore-mast were 
brought by the board, that is to say, broken short 
off, but her bowsprit was sound, and the head and 
bow appeared firm. When I came close to her, a 
dog appeared upon her, which, seeing me coming, 
yelped and cried, and as soon as 1 called him, 
jumped into the sea to come to me; and I took 
liim into the boat, but found him almost dead for 
hunger and thirst I gave him a cake of my bread, 
and he ate like a ravenous wolf that had been 
starving a fortnight in the i^lfow. I then gave 
the poor creature some fresh water, with which, if 
I would have let him, he would have burst him- 
self. 

After this I went on board: the first sight I met 
with was two men drowned in the cook-room, or 
forecastle of the ship, with their arms fast about 
one another. I concluded, as is indeed probable, 
that when the ship struck, it being in a storm, the 
sea broke so high, and so continually over her, 
that the men were not able to bear it, and were 
strangled with the constant rushing in of the water, 
as much as if they had been under water; besides 
the dog, there was nothing left in the ship tliat 



252 LTFE AND ADVENTURES 

had life, nor any goods that I could see, but what 
were spoiled by the water: there were some casks 
of liquor, whether wine or brandy 1 knew not, 
which lay lower in the hold, and which, the water 
being ebbed out, I could see; but they were too 
big to meddle w r ith. I saw several chests, which 
I believed belonged to some of the seamen, and I 
got two of them into the boat without examining 
what was in them. 

Had the stern of the ship been fixed, and the 
fore- part broken off, I am persuaded I might have- 
made a good voyage; for by what I found in these 
two chests, I had room to suppose the ship had a 
great deal of wealth on board; and if I may guess 
by the course she steered, she must have been 
bound from the Buenos Ayres, or the Rio de la 
Plata, in the south part of America, beyond the 
Brasils, to the Havanna, in the gulph of Mexico, 
and so perhaps to Spain. She had, no doubt, a 
great treasure in her, but of no use at that time to 
any body; and what became of the rest of her 
people I then knew not. 

I found besides these chests, a little cask full of 
liquor, of about twenty gallons, which I got into 
my boat with much difficulty: there were several 
musquets in a cabin, and a great powder-horn, 
with about four pounds of powder in it; as for the 
musquets, I had no occasion for them, so I left 
them, but took the powder-horn ; I took a fire- 
shovel and tongs, which I wanted extremely; as 
also two little brass kettles, a copper pot to make 
chocolate, and a grid-iron ; and with this cargo, 
and the dog, I came away, the tide beginning to 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. Q53 

make home again; and the same evening about an 
hour within night, I reached the island again, 
weary and fatigued to the last degree. 

I reposed that night in the boat, and in the morn- 
ing I resolved to harbour what I had gotten in 
my new cave, not to carry it home to my castle. 
After refreshing myself, I got all " my cargo on 
shore, and began to examine the particulars: the 
cask of liquor I found to be a kind of rum, but not 
such as we had at the Brasils; and, in a word, not 
at all good; but when I came to open the chests, 
I found several things which I wanted: for exam- 
ple, I found in one a fine case of bottles, of an ex- 
traordinary kind, and filled with cordial waters, 
tine, and very good ; the bottles held about three 
pints each, and were tipped with silver. I found 
two pots of very good succades, or sweet-meats, 
so fastened also on the top, that the salt water had 
not hurt them; and two more of the same, which 
the water had spoiled. I found some very good 
shirts, which were very welcome to me, and about 
a dozen and a half of white linen handkerchiefs, 
and coloured neck-cloths*; the former were also 
very welcome, being exceeding refreshing to wipe 
my face in an hot day : besides this, when I came to 
the till in the chests, I found there three great bags 
of pieces of eight, which held about eleven hundred 
pieces in all; and in one of them, wrapt up in a 
paper, six doubloons of gold, and some small bars 
or wedges of gold; I suppose they might all weigh 
near a pound. 

The other chest I found had some clothes in it, 
but of little value; but by the circumstances, it 



254 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

must have belonged to the gunner's mate, as there 
was no powder in it, but about two pounds of 
glazed powder in the three flasks, kept, I suppose, 
for charging their fowling-pieces on occasion. 
Upon the whole, I got very little by this voyage 
that was of much use to me; for as to the money, 
I had no manner of occasion for it; it was to me 
as the dirt under my feet; and I would have given, 
it for three or four more pair of English shoes arid 
stockings, which were things I greatly wanted;, 
but had not had on my feet now for many years, 
I had, indeed, got two pair of shoes now, which I 
took off the feet of the two drowned men whom 
I saw in the wreck; and I found two pair more in 
one of the chests, which were very welcome to 
me; but they were not like our English shoes, ei- 
ther for ease or service, being rather what we call 
pumps than shoes. I found in the seaman's chest 
about fifty pieces of eight in royals, but no gold; 
I suppose this belonged to a poorer man than the 
other, which seemed to belong to some officer. 

Well, however, I lugged the money home to my 
cave, and laid it up, as I had done that before 
which I brought from our own ship; but it was 
great pity, as I said, that the other part of the ship 
had not come to my share, for I am satisfied I 
might have loaded my canoe several times over 
with money, which, if I had' ever escaped to En- 
gland, would have lain here safe enough till I 
might have come again and fetched it. 

Having now brought all my things on shore, and 
secured them, I went back to my boat, and rowed 
or paddled her along the shore to her old harbour. 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. &55 

where I laid her up, and made the best of my way 
to my old habitation, where I found every thing 
safe and quiet; so I began to repose myself, live 
after my old fashion, and take care of my family 
affairs; and for a while I lived easy enough, only 
that I was more vigilant than I used to be, looked 
out oftener, and did not go abroad so much; and 
if at any time I did stir with any freedom, it was 
always to the east part of the island, where I was 
pretty well satisfied the savages never came, and 
where I could go without so many precautions, 
and such a load of arms and ammunition, as I al- 
ways carried with me, if I went the other way/; 

I lived in this condition near two years more; 
but my unlucky head, that was always to let me 
know it was born to make my body miserable, was 
all these two years filled with projects and designs, 
how, if it were possible, I might get away from 
this island; for sometimes I was for making ano- 
ther voyage to the wreck, though my reason told 
me, that there was nothing left there worth the 
hazard of my voyage: sometimes for a ramble one 
way, sometimes another; and I believe verily, if I 
had the boat that I went from Sallee in, I should 
have ventured to sea, bound any where, I knew 
not whither. 

I have been, in all my circumstances, a memento 
of those who are touched with that general plague 
of mankind, whence, for aught I know, one half 
of their miseries flow; I mean, that of not being 
satisfied with the station wherein God and nature 
hath placed them; for, not to look back upon my 
primitive condition, and the excellent advice of my 



<£56 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

father, the opposition to which was, as I may call 
it, my original sin, my subsequent mistakes of the 
same kind have been the means of my coming into 
this miserable condition; for had that Providence, 
which so happily had seated me at the Brasils as a 
planter, blessed me with confined desires, and 
could I have been contented to have gone on gra- 
dually, I might have been by this time, I mean 
in the time of my being on this island, one of the 
most considerable planters in the Brasils; nay, I 
am persuaded, that by the improvement I had 
made in that little time I lived there, and the in- 
crease I should probably have made if I had staid, 
I might have been worth an hundred thousand 
moidores; and what business had I. to leave a set- 
tled fortune, well-stocked plantation, improving 
and increasing, to turn super-cargo to Guinea, to 
fetch Negroes, when patience and time would so 
have increased our stock at home, v that we could 
have bought them at our own doors, from those 
whose business it was to fetch them? And though 
it had cost us something more, yet the difference 
of that price was by no means worth saving at so 
great a hazard. 

But as this is ordinarily the fate of young heads, 
so reflection upon the folly of it is as ordinarily the 
exercise of more years, or of the dear-bought ex- 
perience of time; and so it was with me now; and 
yet, so deep had the mistake taken root in my 
temper, that I could not satisfy myself in my sta- 
tion, but was continually poring upon the means 
and possibility of my escape from this place: and 
that I may, with the greatej pleasure to the 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. £5? 

I er, bring on the remaining part of my story, it 
may not be improper to give some account of my 
first conceptions on the subject of this foolish 
scheme for my escape ; and how and upon what 
foundation, I acted. 

I am now to be supposed to be retired into my 
castle, after my late voyage to the wreck, my fri- 
gate laid up, and secured under water as usual, and 
my condition restored to what it was before. I 
had more wealth, indeed, than I had before, but 
was not at all the richer; for I had no more use 
for it than the Indians of Peru had before the Spa- 
niards came thither. 

It was one of the nights, in the rainy season in 
March, the four-and-twentieth year of my first 
setting foot in this island of solitariness, I was ly- 
ing in my bed or hammock, awake, and very well 
in health, had no pain, no distemper, no uneasiness 
of body, no, nor any uneasiness of mind more than 
ordinary, but could by no means close my eyes, 
that is, so as to sleep; no, not a wink all night 
long, otherwise than as follows: 

It is as impossible as needless, to set down the 
innumerable crowd of thoughts that whirled 
through that great thoroughfare of the brain, the 
memory, in this night's time. I ran over the 
whole history of my life in miniature, or by abridg- 
ment, as I may call it, to my coming to this island; 
and also of that part of my life since I came to 
this island. In my reflections upon the state of 
my case, since I came on shore on this island, I 
was comparing the happy posture of my affairs in 
the first years of my habitation here, to that 

vol, i. s 



258 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

course of anxiety, fear, and care, which I had 
lived in ever since I had seen the print of a foot 
in the sand; not that I did not believe the savages 
had frequented the island even all the while, and 
might have been several hundreds of them at times 
on the shore there; but as I had never known it, 
and was incapable of any apprehensions about it, 
my satisfaction was perfect, though my danger was 
the same; and I was as happy in not knowing my 
danger, as if I had never really been exposed to it; 
this furnished my thoughts with many very pro- 
fitable reflections, and particularly this one: How 
infinitely good that Providence is, which has set- 
tled in its government of mankind such narrow 
bounds to his sight and knowledge of things; and 
though he walks in the midst of so many thousand 
dangers, the sight of which, if discovered to him, 
would distract his mind, and sink his spirits, he is 
kept serene and calm, by having the event of 
things hid from his eyes, and knowing nothing of 
the dangers which surround him. 

After these thoughts had for some time enter- 
tained me, I came to reflect seriously upon the real 
danger I had been in for so many years in this very 
island; and how I had walked about in the great- 
est security and with all possible tranquillity, even 
perhaps when nothing but a brow on a hill, a 
great tree, or the casual approach of night, had 
been between me and the worst kind of destruc- 
tion, viz. that of falling into the hands of canni- 
bals and savages, who would have seized on me 
w r ith the same view as I did on a goat or a turtle, 
and have thought it no more a crime to kill and 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 259 

devour me, than I did of a pigeon or a curlew; I 
should unjustly slande'r myself, if I shckild say I 
was not sincerely thankful to my great Preserver, 
to whose singular protection I acknowledged, with 
great humility, that all these unknown deliverances 
were due, and without which I should inevitahly 
have fallen into their merciless hands. 

When these thoughts were over, my head was 
for some time taken up in considering the nature 
of these wretched creatures, I mean, the savages; 
and how it came to pass in the world, that the 
wise Governor of all things should give up any of 
his creatures to such inhumanity, nay, to some- 
thing so much below even brutality itself, as to 
devour its own kind: but as this ended in some 
(at that time fruitless) speculations, it occurred to 
me to inquire what part of the world these 
wretches lived in; how far off the coast was from 
whence they came; what they ventured so far 
from home for; what kind of boats they had; and 
why I might not order myself, and my business 
so, that I might be as able to go over thilher as 
they were to come to mer u **■ v 

I never so much as troubled myself to consider, 
what I should do with myself when I came thi- 
ther; what should become of me if I fell into the 
hands of the savages; or how I should escape from 
them, if they attempted me; no, nor so much as 
how it was possible for me to reach the coast, and 
not be attacked by some or other of them, without 
any possibility of delivering myself; and if I should 
not fall into their hands, what I should do for pro- 
vision, or whither I should bend my course; none 

s 2 



260 LIFE AND ADVENTUR1S 

of these thoughts, I say, so much as came in my 
way; but my mind was wholly bent upon the 
notion of my passing over in my boat to the main 
land. I looked back upon my present condition as 
the most miserable that could possibly be; that I 
was not able to throw myself into any thing but 
death, that could be called worse; that if I reached 
the shore of the main, I might, perhaps, meet with 
relief; or I might coast along, as I did on the 
shore of Africa, till I came to some inhabited 
country, and where I might find some relief; and 
after all, perhaps, I might fall in with some Chris- 
tian ship that might take me in; and if the worst 
came to the worst, I could but die, which would 
put an end to all these miseries at once. Pray, 
note, all this was the fruit of a disturbed mind, an 
impatient temper, made, as it were, desperate by 
the long continuance of my troubles, and the dis- 
appointments I had met in the wreck I had been 
on board of, and where I had been so near the ob- 
taining of what I so earnestly longed for, viz. 
somebody to speak to, and to learn some know- 
ledge from of the place where I was, and of the 
probable means of m}' deliverance: I say, I was 
agitated wholly by these thoughts. All my calm 
of mind in my resignation to Providence, and 
waiting the issue of the dispositions of Heaven, 
seemed to be suspended; and I had, as it were, no 
power to turn my thoughts to any thing but the 
project of a voyage to the main; which came upon 
me with such force, and such an impetuosity of 
desire, that it was not to be resisted. 

When this had agitated my thoughts for tw r o 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. Q6i 

hours or more, with such violence that it set my 
very blood into a ferment, and my pulse beat as 
high as if I had been in a fever, merely with the 
extraordinary fervour of my mind about it; na- 
ture, as if I had been fatigued and exhausted with 
the very thought of it, threw me into a sound 
sleep: one would have thought I should have 
dreamed of it; but I did not, nor of any thing re- 
lating to it; but I dreamed that as I was going 
out in the morning, as usual, from my castle, I saw 
upon the shore two canoes, and eleven savages 
coming to land, and that they brought with them 
another savage, whom they were going to kill, in 
order to eat him ; when, on a sudden, the savage 
that they were going to kill, jumped away, and 
ran for his life : then I thought in my sleep, that 
he came running into my little thick grove, before 
my fortification, to hide himself; and that I seeing 
him alone, and not perceiving that the others 
sought him that way, shewed myself to him, and 
smiling upon him, encouraged him, that he kneeled 
down to me, seeming to pray me to assist him; 
upon which I shewed my ladder, made him go up 
it, and carried him into my cave, and he became 
my servant; and that as soon as I had got this 
man, I said to myself, Now I may certainly ven- 
ture to the main land; for this fellow will serve 
me as a pilot, and will tell me what to do, and 
whither to go for provisions, and whither not to 
go for fear of being devoured; what places to ven- 
ture into, v and what to escape. I waked with tljis 
thought, and was under such inexpressible impres- 
sions of joy at the prospect of my escape in my 



Z6 C 2 LIFE AX-D ADVENTUUKS 

dream, that the disappointments which I felt upon 
coming to myself, and finding it was no more than 
a dream, were equally extravagant the other way, 
and threw me into a very great dejection of spirit. 

Upon this, however, I made this conclusion, 
that my only way to go about -an attempt for an 
escape, was, if possible, to get a savage in my pos- 
session; and, if possible, it should be one of their 
prisoners whom they had condemned to be eaten, 
and should bring hither to kill; but these thoughts 
still were attended with this difficulty, that it was 
impossible to effect this, without attacking a whole 
caravan of them, and killing them all; and this 
was not only a very desperate attempt, and might 
miscarry; but, on the other hand, I had greatly 
scrupled the lawfulness of it to me, and my heart 
trembled at the thoughts of shedding so much 
blood, though it was for my deliverance. I need 
not repeat the arguments which occurred to me 
against this, they being the same mentioned before: 
but though I had other reasons to offer now, viz. 
that those men were enemies to my life, and would 
devour me, if they could; that it was self-preser- 
vation, in the highest degree, to deliver myself 
from this death of life, and was acting in my own 
defence, as much as if they were actually assault- 
ing me, and the like; I say, though these things 
argued for it, yet the thoughts of shedding human 
blood for my deliverance were very terrible to me, 
and such as I could by no means reconcile myself 
to a great while. 

However, at last, after many secret disputes 
with myself, and after great perplexities about it 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 263 

(for all these arguments, one way and another, 
struggled in my head a long time,) the eager pre- 
vailing desire of deliverance at length mastered 
all the rest, and I resolved, if possible, to get on£ 
of these savages into my hands, cost what it would : 
the next thing then was to contrive how to do it; 
and this indeed was very difficult to resolve ou: 
but as I could pitch upon no probable means for 
it, so I resolved to put myself upon the watch to 
see them when they came on shore, and leave the 
rest to the event, taking such measures as the op- 
portunity should present, let it be what it \vould. 

With these resolutions in my thoughts, I set 
myself upon the scout as often as possible, and 
indeed so often, till I was heartily tired of it; for 
it was above a year and an half that I waited, and 
for a great part of that time went out to the west 
end, and to the south-west corner of the island, 
almost every day, to see the canoes, but none ap- 
peared: this was very discouraging, and began to 
trouble me much; though I cannot say that it did 
in this case, as it had done some time before that, 
viz. wear off the eilge of my desire to the thing; 
but the longer it seemed to be delayed, the more 
eager I was for it: in a word, I was not at first 
more careful to shun the sight of these savages, 
and avoid being seen by them, than I was now 
eager to be upon them. 

Besides, I fancied myself able to manage one, 
nay, two or three savages, if I had them, so as to 
make them entirely slaves to me, to do whatever 
I should direct them, and to prevent their being 
able, at any time, to do me any hurt. It was a 



Q6i lite a>:d adventuuks 

great while that I pleased myself with this affair, 
hut nothing still presented; all my fancies and 
schemes came to nothing, for no savages came 
near me for a great while. 

About a year and an half after I had entertained 
these notions, and, by long musing, had, as it were, 
resolved them all into nothing, for want of an 
occasion to put them in execution, I was surprised 
one morning early, with seeing no less than five 
canoes all on shore together, on my side the island, 
and the people who belonged to them all landed, 
and out of my sight: the number of them broke 
all my measures; for seeing so many, and knowing 
that they always came four, or six, or sometimes 
more, in a boat, I could not tell what to think of 
it, or how to take my measures to attack twenty 
or thirty men single-handed; so I lay still in my 
castle, perplexed and discomforted : however, I 
put myself into all the same postures for an attack 
that I had formerly provided, and was just ready 
for action, if any thing had presented. Having 
waited a good while, listening to hear if they made 
any noise; at Jength being very impatient, I set 
my guns at the foot of my ladder, and clambered 
tip to the top of the hill by my two stages, as 
usual; standing so, however, that my head did not 
appear above the hill, so that they could not per- 
ceive me by any means: here I observed, by the 
help of my perspective glass, that they were no 
less than thirty in number; that they had a fire 
kindled, and that they had meat dressed; how 
they cooked it, that I knew not, or what it was; 
but they were all dancing in I know not how 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. £6\5 

many barbarous gestures and figures, their own 
way, round the lire. 

When I was thus looking on them, I perceived 
by my perspective two miserable wretches dragged 
from the boats, where, it seems, they were laid 
by, and were now brought out for the slaughter. 
I perceived one of them immediately fall, being 
knocked down, I suppose, with a club or wooden 
sword, for that was their way; and two or three 
others were at work immediately, cutting him 
open for their cookery, while the other victim was 
left standing by himself, till they should be ready 
for him: in that very moment this poor wretch, 
seeing himself a little at liberty, nature inspired 
him with hopes of life, and he started away from 
them, and ran with incredible swiftness along the 
sands, directly towards me, I mean, towards that 
part of the coast where my habitation w r as. 

I was dreadfully frighted (that I must acknow- 
ledge) when I perceived him to run my way ; and es- 
pecially when, as I thought, I saw him pursued by 
the whole body ; and now I expected that part of 
my dream was coming to pass, and that he would 
certainly take shelter in my grove; but I could 
not depend, by any means, upon my dream for 
the rest of it, viz. that the other savages would 
not pursue him thither, and find him there. How- 
ever, I 'kept my station, and my spirits began to 
recover, when I found that there were not above 
three men that followed him; and still more was 
I encouraged, when I found he outstrip! them ex- 
ceedingly in running, and gained ground of them, 



266 LIVE AND ADVENTURES 

so that if he could but hold it for half an hour, I 
saw easily he would fairly get away from them all. 

There was between them and my castle the 
creek, which I mentioned often at the first part of 
my story, when I landed my cargoes out of the 
ship; and this I knew, he must necessarily swim 
over, or the poor wretch would be taken there: 
but when the savage escaping came thither, he 
made nothing of it, though the tide was then up; 
but plunging in, swam through in about thirty 
strokes, or thereabouts, landed, and ran on with 
exceeding strength and swiftness. When the three 
pursuers came to the creek, I found that two of 
them could swim, but the third could not, and 
that he, standing on the other side, lopked at the 
other, but went no farther; and soon after went 
softly back again, which, as it happened, was very 
well for him in the main. 

I observed, that the two who swam were yet 
more than twice as long swimming over the creek 
than the fellow was that fled from them. It came 
now very warmly upon my thoughts, and indeed 
irresistibly, that now was my time to get a ser- 
vant, and perhaps a companion, or assistant, and 
that I was called plainly by Providence to save this 
poor creature's life. I immediately got down the 
ladders with all possible expedition, fetched my 
two guns, for they were both at the foot of the 
ladder, as I observed above; and getting up again 
with the same haste to the top of the hill, I crossed 
towards the sea; and having a very short cut, and 
all down hill, clapped myself in the way between

the pursuers and the pursued, hallooing aloud to 
him that fled, who, looking back, was at first per- 
haps as much frighted at me as I at them; but I 
beckoned with my hand to him to come back; and 
in the mean time, I slowly advanced towards the 
two that followed ; then rushing at once upon the 
foremost, I knocked him down with the stock of 
my piece; I was loth to fire, because I would not 
have the rest hear, though at that distance it 
would not have been easily heard; and being out 
of sight of the smoke too, they would not have 
easily known what to make of it. Having knocked 
this fellow down, the other who pursued him 
stopped, as if he had been frightened, and I ad- 
vanced apace towards him; but as I came nearer, 
I perceived presently he had a bow and arrow, 
and was fitting it to shoot at me; so I was then 
necessitated to shoot at him first; which I did, and 
killed him at the first shot. The poor savage who 
fled, but had stopped, though he saw both his 
enemies fallen, and killed (as he thought) yet was 
so frighted with the fire and noise of my piece, 
that he stood stock-still, and neither came forward 
nor went backward, though he seemed rather in- 
clined to fly still, than to come on. I hallooed 
again to him, and made signs to come forward, 
which he easily understood, and came a little way, 
then stopped again, and then a little farther, and 
stopped again; and I could then perceive that he 
stood trembling, as if he had been taken prisoner, 
and had just been to be killed, as his two enemies 
were. I beckoned him again to come to me, and 
gave him all the signs of encouragement that I 



268 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

could think of; and he came nearer and nearer* 
kneeling down every ten or twelve steps, in token 
of acknowledgment for saving his life. I smiled 
at him and looked pleasantly, and beckoned to 
him to come still nearer. At length he came close 
to me, and he then kneeled down again, kissed 
the ground, and laid his head upon the ground, and 
taking me by the foot, set my foot upon his head. 
This, it seems, was in token of swearing to be my 
slave for ever. I took him up, and made much of 
him, and encouraged him all I could. But there 
was more work to do yet; for I perceived the sa- 
vage, whom I knocked down, was not killed, but 
stunned with the blow, and began to come to him- 
self: so I pointed to him, and shewed him the sa- 
vage, that he was not dead: upon this he spoke 
some words to me; and though I could not under- 
stand them, yet I thought they were pleasant to 
hear, for they were the first sound of a man's 
voice, that I had heard, my own excepted, for 
above five-and-twenty years. But there was no 
time for such reflections now: the savage, who. 
was knocked down, recovered himself so far as 
to sit up upon the ground; and I perceived that 
my savage began to be afraid; but when I saw 
that, I presented my other piece at the man, as if I 
would shoot him: upon this my savage, for so I 
call him now, made a motion to me to lend him 
my sword, which hung naked in a belt by my 
side; so I did: he no sooner had it, but he runs 
to his enemy, and at one blow cut off his head so 
cleverly, no executioner in Germany could have 
done it sooner or better; which I thought it very 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 269 

strange for one, who, I had reason to believe, never 
saw a sword in his life before, except their own 
wooden swords. However it seems, as I learned 
afterwards, they make their wooden swords so 
sharp, so heavy, and the wood is so hard, that 
they will cut off heads even witji them, nay, and 
arms, and that at one blow too. When he had 
done this, he comes laughing* to me in sign of 
triumph, and brought me the sword again, and., 
with abundance of gestures, which I did not un- 
derstand, laid it down, with the head of the sa- 
vage that he had killed., just before me. 

But that which astonished him most was, to 
know how I had killed the other Indian so far off; 
so pointing to him, he made signs to me to let 
him go to him: so I bade him go, as well as I 
could. When he came to him, he stood like 
one amazed, looking at him; turned him first on 
one side, then on, the other; looked at the wound 
the bullet had made, which it seems was just in 
his breast, where it had made an hole, and no 
great quantity of blood had followed; but he had 
bled inwardly, for he was quite dead: then he took 
up his bow and arrows, and came back; so 1 
turned to go away, and beckoned him to follow 
me, making signs to him that more might come 
after them. 

Upon this he signed to me, that he should bury 
them with sand, that they might not be seen by 
the rest, if they followed; and so I made signs 
again to him to do so: he fell to work, and in an 
instant he had scraped an hole in the sand with 
his hands, big enough to bury the first in, and 



270 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

then dragged him into it, and covered him, and 
did so also by the other. I believe he had buried 
them both in a quarter of an hour: then calling 
him away, I carried him not to my castle, but 
quite away to my cave, on the farther part of the 
island ; so I did not let my dream come to pass in 
that part; viz. that he came into my grove for 
shelter. 

Here I gave him bread, and a bunch of raisins 
to eat, and a draught of water, which I found lie 
was indeed in great distress for, by his running; 
and having refreshed him, I made signs for him 
to go lie down and sleep, pointing to a place 
where I had laid a great parcel 6f rice-straw, and 
a blanket upon it, which I used to sleep Upon my- 
self sometimes: so the poor creature lay down, 
and went to sleep. 

He was a comely .handsome fellow, perfectly 
well made, with straight long limbs, not too 
large, tall, and well-shaped, and, as I reckon, 
about twenty-six years of age. He had a very 
good countenance, not a fierce and surly aspect, 
but seemed to have something very manly in his 
face, and yet he had all the sweetness and softness 
of an European in his countenance too, especially 
when he smiled: his hair was long and black, not 
curled like wool; his forehead very high and large, 
and a great vivacity and sparkling sharpness in 
his eyes. The colour of his skin was not quite 
black, but very tawny, and yet not of an ugly 
yellow nauseous tawny, as the Brasilians and Vir- 
ginians, and other natives of America are; but of 
a bright kind of a dun olive colour, that had in it 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 2/1 

something very agreeable, though not very easy 
to describe. His face was round and plump, his 
nose small, not flat like the negroes, a very good 
mouth, thin lips, and his teeth fine, well-set, and 
white as ivory. After he had slumbered, rather 
than slept, about half an hour, he waked again, 
and comes out of the cave to me, for I had been 
milking my goats, which I had in the enclosure 
just by. When he espied me, he came running to 
me, laying himself down again upon the ground, 
with all the possible signs of an humble thankful 
disposition, making many antic gestures to shew 
it. At last he lays his head flat upon the ground, 
close to my foot, and sets my other foot upon his 
head, as he had done before; and after this, made 
all the signs to me of subjection, servitude, and 
submission imaginable, to let me know how much 
he would serve me as long as he lived. I under- 
stood him in many things, and let him know I was 
very well pleased with him. In a little time I 
began to speak to him, and teach him to speak to 
me : and first, I made him know his name should 
be Friday, which was the day I saved his life; and 
I called him so for the memory of the time, I 
likewise taught him to say Master, and then let 
him know that was to be my name; I likewise 
taught him to say Yes and No, and to know the 
meaning of them. I gave him some milk in an 
earthen pot, and let him see me drink it before 
him, sop my bread in it; and I gave him a cake 
of bread to do the like, which he quickly com- 
plied with, and made signs that it was very good 
for him. 



272 LIFE AXD ADVENTURES 

I kept there with him all that night ; but as soon 
as it was day, I beckoned him to come with me, 
and let him know I would give him some clothes; 
at which he seemed very glad, for he was stark- 
naked. As we went by the place where he had 
buried the two men, he pointed exactly to the 
spot, and shewed me the marks that he had made 
to find them again, making signs to me that we 
should dig them up again, and eat them. At this I 
appeared very angry, expressed my abhorrence of 
it, made as if I would vomit at the thoughts of it, 
and beckoned with my hand to him to come away, 
which he did immediately, with great submission. 
I then led him up to the top of the hill, to see if 
his enemies were gone, and pulling- out my glass, I 
looked, and saw plainly the place where they had 
been, but no appearance of them, or of their ca- 
noes; so that it was plain that they were gone, 
and had left their two comrades behind them, 
without any search after them. 

But I was not content with this discovery; but 
having now more courage, and consequently more 
curiosity, I took my man Friday with me, giving 
him the sword in his hand, with the bow and ar- 
rows at his back, which I found he could use very 
dexterously, making him carry one gun for me, 
and I two for myself, and away we marched to the 
place where these creatures had been; for^I had a 
mind now to get some fuller intelligence of them. 
When I came to the place, my very blood ran chili 
in my veins, and my heart sunk within me at the 
horror of the spectacle: indeed it was a dreadful 
sight, at least it was so to me, though Friday made 



Otf ROBINSON CRUSOE. g/3 

nothing of it. The place was covered with human 
bones, the ground dyed with the blood, great pieces 
of flesh left here and there half-eaten, mangled, 
and scorched; and, in short, all the tokens of the 
triumphant feast they had been making there, after 
a victory over their enemies. I saw three skulls, 
five hands, and the bones of three or four legs and 
feet, and abundance of other parts of the bodies; 
and Friday, by his signs, made me understand that 
they brought over four prisoners to feast upon; 
that three of them were eaten up, and that he, 
pointing to himself, was the fourth: that there had 
been a great battle between them and their next 
king, whose subjects, it seems, he had been one of; 
and that they had taken a great number of pri- 
soners, all which were carried to several places by 
those that had taken them in the flight, in order to 
feast upon them, as was done here by these 
wretches upon those they brought hither. 

I caused Friday to gather all the skulls, bones, 
flesh, and whatever remained, and lay them toge- 
ther on an heap, and make a great fire upon it, 
and burn them all to ashes. I found Friday had 
still an hankering stomach after some of the flesh, 
and was still a cannibal in his nature; but I disco- 
vered so much abhorrence at the very thoughts of 
it, and at the least appearance of it, that he durst 
not discover it; for I had, by some means, let him 
know, that I would kill him if he offered it. 

When he had done this, we came back to our 
castle, and there I fell to work with my mai Fri- 
day. And first of all, I gave him a pair of linen 
drawers which I had out of the poor gunner's 

VOL L T 



74 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 



chest I mentioned, and which I found in the 
wreck; and which, with a little alteration, fitted 
him very well: then I made him a jerkin of goat's- 
skin as well as mv skill would allow, and I was 
now grown a tolerably good tailor: and I gave him 
a cap, which I had made of an hare-skin, very con- 
venient, and fashionable enough: and thus he was 
dressed, for the present, tolerably well, and mighty 
well was he pleased to see himself almost as well 
clothed as his master: it is true, he went awk- 
wardly in these things at first; wearing the 
drawers was very awkward to him. and the sleeves 
of the waistcoat galled his shoulders and the in- 
side of his arms ; but a little easing them, where 
he complained they hurt him, and using himself to 
them, at length he took to them very well. 

The next day after I came home to my hutch 
with him, I began to consider where I should 
lodge him; and that I might do well for him, and 
yet be perfectly easy myself, I made a little tent 
for him in the vacant place between my two forti- 
fications, in the inside of the last, and in the out 
side of the first: and as there was a door or en- 
trance there into my cave, I made a formal framed 
door-case, and a door to it of boards, and set it up 
in the passage, a little within the entrance ; and 
causing the door to open on the inside, I barred it 
up in the night, taking in my ladders too; so that 
Friday could no way come at me hi the inside of 
my innermost wall, without making so much noise 
in getting over, that it must needs awaken me; 
for my first wall had now a complete roof over it of 
long poles, covering all my tent, and leaning up to 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 275 

the side of the hill, which was again laid cross 
with small sticks instead of laths, and then 
thatched over a great thickness with the rice- 
straw, which was strong like reeds; and at the 
hole or place which was left to go in or out by the 
ladder, I had placed a kind of trap -door, which if 
it had been attempted on the outside, would not 
have opened at all, but would have fallen down, 
and made a great noise; and as to weapons, I took 
them all into my side every night. 

But I needed none of all this precaution ; for 
never man had a more faithful, loving, sincere ser- 
vant than Friday was to me; without passions, sul- 
lenness, or designs; perfectly obliging and engag- 
ing; his very affections were tied to me, like those 
of a child to a father; and I dare say, he would 
have sacrificed his life for the saving mine, upon 
any occasion whatsoever: the many testimonies 
he gave me of this, put it out of doubt; and soon 
convinced me, that I needed to use no precautions 
as to my safety on his account. 

This frequently gave me occasion to observe, 
and that with wonder, that, however, it had pleased 
God in his providence, and in the government of 
the works of his hands, to take from so great a 
part of the world, of his creatures, the best uses to 
which their faculties and the powers of their souls 
are adapted; yet that he has bestowed upon them 
the same powers, the same reason, the same affec- 
tions, the same sentiment's of kindness and obliga- 
tion, the same passions and resentments of wrongs, 
the same sense of gratitude, sincerity, fidelity, and 
all the capacities of doing good, and receiving good, 

t 2 



276 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

that he has given to us; and that when he pleased 
to offer them occasions of exerting these, they are 
as ready, nay, more ready to apply them to the 
right uses for which they were bestowed, than wc 
are. And this made me very melancholy some- 
times, in reflecting, as the several occasions pre- 
sented, how mean a use we make of all these, even 
though we have these powers enlightened by the 
great lamp of instruction, the Spirit of God, and 
by the knowledge of his word, added to our un- 
derstanding; and why it has pleased God to hide 
the like saving knowledge from so many millions 
of souls, who if one might judge by this poor sa- 
vage, would make a much better use of it than 
we did. 

From hence I sometimes was led too far to in- 
vade the sovereignty of Providence; and, as it 
were, arraign the justice of so arbitrary a disposi- 
tion of things, that should hide that light from 
some, and reveal it toothers, and yet expect a like 
duty from both: but I shut it up, and checked my 
thoughts with this conclusion. First, that we do 
not know by what light and law these should be 
condemned; but that as God was necessarily, and 
by the nature of his being, infinitely holy and just, 
so it could not be, but that if these creatures were 
all sentenced to absence from himself, it was on 
account of sinning against that light, which, as 
the scripture says, was a law to themselves, and 
by such rules as their consciences would acknow- 
ledge to be just, though the foundation was not 
discovered to us: and, secondly, that still, as we 
are all clay in the hand of the potter, no vessel 



QF ROBI3CSON CRUSOE. %77 

could say to him, why hast thou formed me 
thus ? 

But to return, to my ciew /companion. I wag 
greatly delighted with him, and made it my busi- 
ness to teach him every thing that was proper to 
make him useful, handy, and helpful; but espe* 
dally to make him speak, and understand me 
when I spake: and he was the aptest scholar that 
ever was; and particularly was so merry, so con- 
stantly diligent, and so pleased when he could but 
understand me, or make me understand him, that 
it was very pleasant to me to talk to him. And 
now my life began to be so easy, that I began to 
say to my elf, that could I but have been safe from 
more savages, I cared not if I was never to remove 
from the place while I lived. 

After I had been two or three days returned to 
my castle, I thought that, in order to bring Friday 
off from his horrid way of feeding, and from the 
relish of a cannibal's stomach, I ought to let him 
taste other flesh; so I took him out with me one 
morning to the woods. I went, indeed, intending 
to kill a kid out of my own flock, and bring it 
home and dress it: but as I was going, I saw a 
she-goat lying down in the shade, and two young 
kids sitting by her. I catched hold of Friday, 
Hold, said I, stand still; and made signs to him 
not to stir; immediately I presented my piece, 
shot and killed one of the kids. The poor crea- 
ture, who had, at a distance indeed, seen me kill 
the savage his enemy, but did not know or could 
imagine how it was done, was sensibly surprised, 
trembled and shook, and looked so amazed, that 



278 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

I thought he would have sunk down; he did not 
see the kid I had shot at, or perceive I had killed 
it, but ripped up his waistcoat to feel if he was 
not wounded; and, as I found, presently thought 
I was resolved to kill him; for he came and 
kneeled down to me, and, embracing my knees, 
said a great many things I did not understand; 
but I could easily see that his meaning was to 
pray me not to kill him. 

I soon found a way to convince him, that I 
would do him no harm ; and taking him up by the 
hand, laughed at him, and pointing to the kid 
which I had killed, beckoned to him to run and 
fetch it, which he did; and while he was wonder- 
ing and looking to see how the creature was killed, 
I loaded my gun again, and by and by I saw a 
great fowl, like an hawk, sit upon a tree within 
shot: so, to let Friday understand a little what I 
would do, I called him to me again, pointing at 
the fowl, which was indeed a parrot, though I 
thought it had been an hawk; I say, pointing to 
the parrot, and to my gun, and to the ground under 
the parrot, to let him see I would make him fall, 
I made him understand that I would shoot and 
kill that bird; accordingly I fired, and bid him 
look, and immediately he saw the parrot fall. He 
stood like one frighted again, notwithstanding all 
that I had said to him; and I found he was the 
more amazed, because he did not see me put any 
thing into the gun; but thought there must be 
some wonderful fund of death and destruction in 
that thing, able to kill man, beast, bird, or any 
thing near or far off: for the astonishment this 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. £79 

created in him was such, as co\ild not wear off for 
along time; and I believe, if I would have let him, 
he would have worshipped me and my gun : as for 
the gun itself, he would not so much as touch it 
for several days after; but would speak to it, and 
talk to it, as if it had answered him, when he was 
by himself; which, as I afterwards learned of him, 
was to desire it not to kill him. 

Well: after his astonishment was a little over at 
this, I pointed to him to run and fetch the bird I 
had shot, which he did, but staid some time ; for 
the parrot, not being quite dead, had fluttered a 
good way off from the place where she fell; how- 
ever he found her, took her up, and brought her 
to me; and, as I had perceived his ignorance about 
the gun before, I took this advantage to charge 
the gun again, and not let him see me do it, that 
I might be ready for any other mark that might 
present; but nothing more offered at that time: 
so I brought home the kid; and the same evening I 
took the skin off, and cut it out as well as I could ; 
and having a pot for that purpose, I boiled or 
stewed some of the flesh, and made some very 
good broth. After I had began to eat some, I gave 
some to my man, who seemed very glad of it, and 
liked it very well; but that which was strangest 
to him, was, to see me eat salt with it. He made 
a sign to me that the salt was not good to eat; and 
putting a little into his own mouth, he seemed to 
nauseate it, and would spit and sputter at it, wash- 
ing his mouth with fresh water after it; on the 
other hand, I took some meat in my mouth with- 
out salt, and I pretended to spit and sputter for 



280 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

want of salt, as fast as he had done at the salt; 
but it would not do, he would never care for salt 
with meat, or in his broth; at least, not a great 
while, and then but a very little. 

Having thus fed him with boiled meat and 
broth, I was resolved to feast him the next clay 
with roasting a piece of the kid: this I did by 
hanging it before the fire in a string, as I had seen 
many people do in England, setting two poles up, 
one on each side the fire, and one across on the 
top, and tying the string to the cross stick, letting 
the meat turn continually: this Friday admired 
very much; but when he came to taste the flesh, 
he took so many ways to tell me how well he liked 
it, that I could not but understand him ; and at last 
he told me he would never eat man's flesh any 
more, which I was very glad to hear. 

The next day I set him to work to beating some 
corn out, and sifting it in the manner I used to do, 
as I observed before; and he soon understood how 
to do it as well as I, especially after he had seen 
what the meaning of it was, and that it was to 
make bread of; for after that I let him see me 
make my bread, and bake it too; and in a little 
time Friday was able to do all the work for me, as 
well as I could do it myself. 

I began now to consider, that having .two 
mouths to feed instead of one, I must provide more 
ground for my harvest, and plant a larger quantity 
of corn than I used to do ; so I marked out a lar- 
ger piece of land, and began the fence in the same 
manner as before, in which Friday not only worked 
very willingly, and very hard, but did it v^vy 



OF fcOfclNSON CRUSOE. £81 

cheerfully; and I told him what it was for, that it 
was for corn to make more bread, because he was 
now with me, and that I might have enough for him 
and myself too : he appeared very sensible of that 
part, and let me know, that he thought I had much 
more labour upon me on his account, than I had 
for myself, and that he would work the harder for 
me, if I would tell him what to do. 

This was the pleasantest year of all the life I led 
in this place. Friday began to talk pretty well, 
and understand the names of almost every thing 
I had occasion to call for, and of every place I had 
to send him to, and talk a great deal to me ; so 
that, in short, I began now to have some use for 
my tongue again, which indeed I had very little 
occasion for before; that is to say, about speech. 
Besides the pleasure of talking to him, I had a sin- 
gular satisfaction in the fellow himself; his simple 
unfeigned honesty, appeared to me more and more 
every day, arid I began really to love the creature; 
and on his side, I believe he loved me more than 
it was possible for him ever to love any thing be- 
fore. 

I had a mind once to try if he had any hanker- 
ing inclination to his own country again; and 
having taught him English so well, that he could 
answer me almost any questions, I asked him, whe- 
ther the nation that he belonged to never conquered 
in battle? At which he smiled, and said, Yes, yes, 
we always fight the better; that is, he meant, 
always get the better in fight; and so we began 
the following discourse, You always fight the 



£82 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

better! said I. How came you to be taken pri- 
soner then, Friday? 

Friday. My nation beat much for all that. 

Master. How beat? if your nation beat them, 
how came you to be taken? 

Friday. They more than my nation in the place 
where me was ; they take one, two, three, and me. 
My nation over beat them in the yonder place, 
where me no was; there my nation take one, two, 
great thousand. 

Master. But why did not your side recover you 
from the hands of your enemies then? 

Friday. They run one, two, three, and me, and 
make go in the canoe; my nation have no canoe 
that time. 

Master. Well, Friday, and what does your na- 
tion do with the men they take? Do they carry 
them awav, and eat the in as these did? 

Friday. Yes, my nation eat mans too, eat all up. 

Master. Where do they carry them ? 

Friday. Go to other place where they think. 

Master. Do they come hither? 

Friday. Yes, yes, they come hither; come 
other else place. 

Master. Have vou been herewith them? 

Friday. Yes, I been here [points to the N. W. 
side of the island, which, it seems, was their 
side.] 

By this I understood, that my man Friday had 
formerly been among the savages, who used to 
come on shore, on the farther part of the island, 
on the said man-eating occasions- that he was now 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 283 

brought for; and some time afta», when I took 
the courage to carry him to that side, being the 
same I formerly mentioned, he presently knew 
the place, and told me, he was there once when 
they eat up twenty men, two women, and one 
child: he could not tell twenty in English, but he 
numbered them by laying so many stones in a row, 
and pointed to me to tell them over. 

I have told this passage, because it introduces 
what follows ; — that after I had had this discourse 
with him, I asked him, flow far it was from oiir 
island to the shore, and whether the canoes were 
not often lost? He told me there was no danger, 
no canoes ever lost; but that after a little way 
out to sea, there was a current, and a wind always 
one way in the morning, the other in the after- 
noon. 

This I understand to be no more than the sets 
of the tide, as going out, or coming in; but I after- 
wards understood it was occasioned by the great 
draught and reflux of the mighty river Oroonoque; 
in the mouth of which river, as I thought after- 
wards, our island lay; and that this land, which I 
perceived to the W. and N. W. was the great 
island Trinidad, on the north point of the mouth 
of the river: I asked Friday a thousand questions 
about the country, the inhabitants, ihe sea, the 
coast, and what nations were near: he told me all 
he knew, with the greatest openness imaginable. 
I asked him the names of the several nations of 
Jiis sort of people, but could get no other name 
than C'aribs; from whence I easily understood, 
that these were the Caribbees, which our maps 



£84 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

place on that p*rt of America which reaches from 
the mouth of the river Oroonoque to Guinea, and 
onwards to St. Martha: he told me, that up a 
great way beyond the moon, that was, beyond 
the setting of the moon, which must be W. from 
their country, there dwelt white-bearded men, like 
me, and pointed to my great whiskers, which I 
mentioned before; and that they had killed much 
mans, that was his word: by which I understood 
he meant the Spaniards, whose cruelties in Ame- 
rica had been spread over the whole countries, 
and were remembered by all the nations from 
father to son. 

I inquired if he could tell me how I might come 
from this island, and get among those white men: 
he told me, Yes, yes, I might go in two canoe ; I 
could not understand what he meant by two canoe; 
till at last, with great difficulty, I found he meant, 
that it must be in a large great boat as big as two 
canoes. 

This part of Friday's discourse began to relish 
with me very well; and from this time I enter- 
tained some hopes, that one time or other I might 
find an opportunity to make my escape from this 
place, and that this poor savage might be a means 
to help me to do it. 

During the long time that Friday had now been 
with me, and that he began to speak to me, and 
understand me, I was not wanting to lay a foun- 
dation of religious knowledge in his mind; parti- 
cularly, I asked him one time, Who made him? 
The poor creature did not understand me at all, 
but thought I had asked who was his father: but 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 28.5 

I took it by another handle, and asked him, Who 
made the sea, the ground he walked on, and the 
hills and woods? He told me, it was one old Ben- 
amuckee that lived beyond all; he could describe 
nothing of this great person, but that he was very 
old; much older, he said, than the sea or the land, 
than the moon or the stars. I asked him then, If 
this old person had made all things, why did not 
all things worship him? He looked very grave, 
and with a perfect look of innocence, said, All 
things said O ! to him. I asked him if the people 
who die in his country, went away any- where? 
He said, Yes, they all went to Benamuckee. Then 
I asked him, whether those they eat up went 
thither too? he said, Yes. 

From these things I began to instruct him in 
the knowledge of the true God. I told him, that 
the great Maker of all things lived there, pointing 
up towards heaven : that he governs the world by 
the same power and providence by which he made 
it; that he was omnipotent, could do every thing 
for us, give every thing to us, take every thing 
from us; and thus, by degrees, I opened his eyes. 
He listened with great attention, and received with 
pleasure the notion of Jesus Christ being sent to 
redeem us, and of the manner of making our 
prayers to God, and his being able to hear us, 
even into heaven. He told me one day, that if 
our God could hear us up beyond the sun, he 
must needs be a greater God than their Bena- 
muckee, who lived but a little way off, and yet 
could not hear, till they went up to the great 



286 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

mountains, where he dwelt, to speak to him. I 
asked him, if ever he went thither to speak to him? 
He said, No, they never went that were young 
men; none went thither but the old men; whom 
he called their Oowookakee, that is, as I made 
him explain it to me, their religious, or clergy; 
and that they went to say O ! (so he called saying 
prayers) and then came back, and told them what 
Benamuckee said. By this I observed that there 
is priestcraft even amongst the most blinded igno- 
rant Pagans in the world; and the policy of mak- 
ing a secret religion, in order to preserve the vene- 
ration of the people to the clergy, is not only to 
be found in the Roman, but perhaps among all re- 
ligions in the world, even among the most brutish 
and barbarous savages. 

I endeavoured to clear up this fraud to my man 
Friday; and told him, that the pretence of their 
old men going up to the mountains to say O! to 
their god Benamuckee, was a cheat; and their 
bringing word from thence what he said, was 
much more so; that if they met with any answer, 
or spoke with any one there, it must be with an 
evil spirit: and then I entered into a long dis- 
course with him about the devil, the original of 
him, his rebellion against God, his enmity to man, 
the reason of it, his setting himself up in the dark 
parts of the world to be worshipped instead of 
God, and as God, and the many stratagems he 
made use of to delude mankind to their ruin; how 
he had a secret access to our passions and to our 
affections, to adapt his snares so to our inclinations, 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 287 

^s to cause us even to be our own tempters, and 
to run upon our own destructions by our own 
choice. 

I found it was not so easy to imprint right no- 
tions in his mind about the devil, as it was about 
the being of a God : nature assisted all my argu- 
ments to evidence to him even the necessity of a 
great first cause, and over-ruling governing power 
a secret directing Providence, and of the equity 
and justice of paying homage to him that made 
us, and the like: but there appeared nothing of 
all this in the notion of an evil spirit; of his ori- 
ginal, his being, his nature, and above all, of his 
inclination to do evil, and to draw us in to do so 
too: and the poor creature puzzled me once in 
such a manner, by a question merely natural and 
innocent, that I scarce knew what to say to him. 
I had been talking a great deal to him of the power 
of God, his omnipotence, his dreadful aversion to 
sin, his being a consuming fire to the workers of 
iniquity; how, as he had made us all, he could 
destroy us, and all the world, in a moment; and 
lie listened with great seriousness to me all the 
while. 

After this, I had been telling him how the devil 
was God's enemy in the hearts of men, and used 
all his malice and skill to defeat the good designs 
of Providence, and to ruin the kingdom of Christ 
in the world, and the like: Well, says Friday, but 
you say God is so strong, so great, is he not much 
strong, much might as the devil? Yes, yes, said I, 
Friday, God is stronger than the devil: God is 
above the devil, and therefore we pray to God to 



288 LU?E AND ADVENTURES 

tread him under our feet, and enable us to resist 
his temptations, and quench his fiery darts. But, 
says he again, If God much strong, much might 
as the devil, why God not kill the devil, so make 
him no more wicked? 

I was strangely surprised at his question; and 
after all, though I was now an old man, yet I was 
but a young doctor, and ill enough qualified for a 
casuist or a solver of difficulties: and, at first, I 
could not tell what to say; so I pretended not to 
hear him, and asked him what he said? but he was 
too earnest for an answer to forget his question; 
so that he repeated it in the very same broken 
words, as above. By this time I had recovered 
myself a little, and I said, God will at last punish 
him severely; he is reserved for the judgment, 
and is to be cast into the bottomless pit, to dwell 
with everlasting fire. This did not satisfy Friday; 
but he returns upon me, repeating my words, Re- 
serve at last! me no understand: but why not kill 
the devil now, not kill great ago? You may as 
well ask me, said I, why God does not kill you 
and me, when we do wicked things here that 
offend him: we are preserved to repent and be 
pardoned. He muses a while at this: Well, well, 
iays he, mighty affectionately, that well; so you, 
I, devil, all wicked, all preserve, repent, God par- 
don all. Here I was run clown again by him to 
the last degree, and it was a testimony to me, how 
the mere notions of nature, though they will guide 
reasonable creatures to the knowledge of a God, 
and of a worship or homage due to the supreme 
being of God, as the consequence of our nature; 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. £89 

vet nothing bat divine revelation can form the 
knowledge of Jesus Christ, and of a redemption 
purchased for us; of a Mediator; of a new cove- 
nant; and of an Intercessor at the footstool of 
God's throne: I say nothing but a revelation from 
Heaven can form these in the soul; and that there- 
fore the Gospel of our Lord and Saviour Jesus 
Christ, I mean the word of God, and the Spirit 
of God, promised for the guide and sanctifier of 
his people, are the absolutely necessary instructors 
of the souls of men in the saving knowledge of 
God, and the means of salvation. 

I therefore diverted the present discourse be- 
tween me and my man, rising up hastily, as upon 
some sudden occasion of going out; then sending 
him for something a great way off, I seriously 
prayed to God, that he would enable me to in- 
struct savingly this poor savage, assisting by his 
Spirit the heart of the poor ignorant creature to 
receive the light of the knowledge of God in 
Christ, reconciling him to himself, and would 
guide me to speak so to him from the word of 
God, as his conscience might be convinced, his 
eyes opened, and his soul saved: when he came 
again to me, I entered into a long discourse with 
him upon the subject of the redemption of man 
by the Saviour of the world, and of the doctrine 
of the Gospel preached from heaven, viz. of re- 
pentance towards God, and faith in our blessed 
Lord Jesus; I then explained to him, as well as 
I could, why our blessed Redeemer took not on 
him the nature of angels, but the seed of Abraham, 
and how, for that reason, the fallen angels had no 
vol. i, u 



£90 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

share in the redemption; that he came only to the 
lost sheep of the house of Israel, and the like. 

I had, God knows, more sincerity than know- 
ledge, in all the methods I took for this poor 
creature's instruction ; and must acknowledge, what 
I believe all that act upon the same principle 
will find, that in laying things open to him, I 
really informed and instructed myself in many 
things, that either I did not know, or had not 
fully considered before ; but which occurred na- 
turally to my mind, upon my searching into them 
for the information of this poor savage ; and I had 
more affection in my inquiry after things upon 
this occasion, than ever I felt before: so that whe- 
ther this poor wild wretch was the better for me 
or no, I had great reason to be thankful that ever 
he came to me: my grief sat lighter upon me, my 
habitation grew comfortable to me beyond mea- 
sure; and when I reflected, that in this solitary 
life, which I had been confined to, I had not only 
been moved myself to look up to Heaven, and to 
seek to the hand that brought me thither, but was 
now to be made an instrument, under Providence, 
to save the life, and, for aught I know, the soul of 
a poor savage, and bring him to the true know- 
ledge of religion, and of the Christian doctrine, 
that he might know Christ Jesus, to know whom 
is life eternal; I say, when I inflected upon all 
these things, a secret joy ran through every part 
of my soul, and I frequently rejoiced that ever I 
was brought to this place, which I had often 
thought the most dreadful of all afflictions that 
x:ouid possibly have befallen me. 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. , 291 

In tills thankful frame I continued all the re- 
mainder of my time; and the conversation which 
employed the hours between Friday and me was 
such, as made the three years which we lived there 
together perfectly and completely happy, if any 
such thing as complete happiness can be found in 
a sublunary state. The savage was now a good 
Christian, a much better than I; though I have 
reason to hope, and bless God for it, that we were 
equally penitent, and comforted restored peni- 
tents: we had here the word of God to read, and 
no farther off from his Spirit to instruct than if we 
had been in England. 

I always applied myself to reading the Scripture, 
and to let him know, as well as I could, the mean- 
ing of what I read; and he again by his serious 
inquiries and questions, made me, as I said before, 
a much better scholar in the Scripture knowledge, 
than I should ever have been by my own private 
reading: another thing I cannot refrain from ob- 
serving here also, from experience, in this retired 
part of my life; viz. how infinite and inexpressi- 
ble a blessing it is, that the knowledge of God, 
and of the doctrine of salvation by Christ Jesus, 
is so plainly laid down in the word of God, so 
easy to be received and understood, that as the 
bare reading the Scripture made me capable of un- 
derstanding enough of my duty to carry me di- 
rectly on to the greaUwork of sincere repentance 
for my sins, and laying hold of a Saviour for life 
and salvation, to a stated reformation in practice, 
and obedience to all God's commands, and this 
without any teacher or instructor, (I mean, hu- 

u 2 



292 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

man) so the plain instruction sufficiently served 
to the enlightening this savage creature, and 
bringing him to be such a Christian, as I have 
known few equal to him in my life. 

As to the disputes, wranglings, strife and con- 
tention, which has happened in the world about 
religion, whether niceties jn doctrines, or schemes 
of church government, they were all presently 
useless to us, as, for aught I can yet see, they 
have been to all the rest in the world: we had 
the sure guide to heaven, viz. the Word of God; 
and we had, blessed be God! comfortable views of 
the Spirit of God, teaching and instructing us by 
h s word, leading us into all truth, and making us 
both willing and obedient to the instruction of 
his word : and I cannot see the least use that the 
greatest knowledge of the disputed points in reli- 
gion, which have made such confusions in the 
world, would have been to us, if we could have 
obtained it — But I must go on with the historical 
part of things, and take every part in its order. 

After Friday and I became more intimately ac- 
quainted, and that he could understand almost all 
I said to him, and speak fluently, though in bro- 
ken English, to me, I acquainted him with my 
own story, or at least so much of it as related to 
1113 7 coming into the place; how I had lived there, 
and how long. I let him into the mystery (for 
such it was to him) of gunpowder and bullets, and 
taught him how to shoot. I gave him a knife, 
which he was wonderfully delighted with ; and I 
made him a belt with a frog hanging to it, such as 
in England we wear hangers in; and in the frog, 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 2£)5 

instead of an hanger, I gave him an hatchet, which 
was not only as good a weapon in some cases, but 
much more useful upon many occasions. 

I described to him the countries of Europe, and 
particularly England, which I came from; how we 
lived, how we worshipped God, how we behaved 
to one another, and how we traded in ships to all 
the parts of the world. I gave him an account of 
the wreck which 1 had been on board of, and 
shewed him, as near as I could, the place where 
she lay ; but she was all beaten in pieces long be- 
fore, and quite gone. 

I shewed him the ruins of our boat, which we 
lost when we escaped, and which I could not stir 
with my whole strength then, but was now fallen 
almost all to pieces. Upon seeing this boat, Fri- 
day stood musing a great while, and said nothing; 
I asked him what it was he studied upon? At last, 
says he, Me see such boat like come to place at my 
nation. 

I did not understand him a good while; but at 
last, when I had examined further into it, I under- 
stood by him, that a boat, such as that had been, 
came on shore upon the country where he lived, 
that is, as he explained it, was driven thither by 
stress of weather. I presently imagined that some 
European ship must have been cast away upon 
their coast, and the boat might get loose, and drive 
ashore; but was so dull, that I never once thought 
of men making escape from a wreck thither, much 
less whence they might come; so I only inquired 
after a description of the boat. 

Friday described the boat to me well enough; 



294 LlfE AND ADVENTURES 

but brought me better to understand him, when 
he added, with some warmth, We save the white 
mans from drown: then I presently asked him, 
if there were any white mans, as he called them, 
in the boat? Yes, he said, the boat full of white 
mans. I asked him, how many? he told upon his 
fingers seventeen. I asked him then, what became 
of them? he told me, They live, they dwell at my 
nation. 

This put new thoughts into my head again; for 
I presently imagined, that these might be the men 
belonging to the ship that was cast away in sight 
of my island, as I now call it; and who, after the 
ship was struck on the rock, and they saw her in- 
evitably lost, had saved themselves in their boat, 
and were landed upon that wild shore among the 
savages. 

Upon this I inquired of him more critically, 
what was become of them? He assured me they 
lived still there, that they had been there about four 
years, that the savages let them alone, and gave 
them victuals to eat. I asked him, how it came 
to pass they did not kill them, and eat them? he 
said, No, they make brother with them: that is, as 
I understood him, a truce: and then he added, 
They eat no mans but when make the war fight: 
that is to say, they never eat any men, but such 
as come to fight with them, and are taken in 
battle. 

It was after this some considerable time, that 
being on the top of the hill, at the east side of the 
island, from whence, as I have said, I had in a 
clear day discovered the main or continent of Ame- 



OF ROBIXSON CRUSOE. 29«5 

rica; Friday, the weather being very serene, looks 
very earnestly towards the main land, and in a 
kind of surprise falls a jumping and dancing, and 
calls out to me, for I was at some distance from 
him. I asked him what was the matter? Ojoy! 
says he, O glad ! there see my country, there my 
nation ! 

I observed an extraordinary sense of pleasure 
appeared in his face, and his eyes sparkled, and 
his countenance discovered a strange eagerness, as 
if he had a mind to be in his own country again; 
and this observation of mine put a great many 
thoughts into me; which made me at first not so 
easy about my new man Friday as I was before; 
and I made no doubt, but that if Friday could get 
back tq his own nation again, he would not only 
forget all his religion, but all his obligations to 
me; and would be forward enough to give his 
countrymen an account of me, and come back per- 
haps with an hundred or two of them, and make 
a feast upon me, at which he might be as merry 
as he used to be with those of his enemies, when 
they were taken in war. 

But I wronged the poor honest creature very 
much, for which I was very sorry afterwards : 
however, as my jealousy increased, and held me 
some weeks, I was a little more circumspect, and 
not so familiar and kind to him as before; in which 
I was certainly in the wrong too, the honest 
grateful creature having no thought about it, but 
what consisted of the best principles, both as a 
religious Christian, and as a grateful friend ; as 
appeared afterwards, to my full satisfaction. 



296 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

Whilst my jealousy of him lasted, you may he 
sure I was every clay pumping him, to sec if he 
would discover any of the new thoughts which I 
suspected were in him ; but I found every thing he 
said was so honest, and so innocent, that I could 
find nothing to nourish my suspicion ; and, in spite 
of all my uneasiness, he made me at last entirely 
his own again; nor did he in the least perceive 
that I was uneasy; and therefore I could not sus- 
pect him of deceit. 

One day, walking up the same hill, but the wea- 
ther being hazy at sea, so that we could not see 
the continent, I called to him, and said, Friday, 
do not you wish yourself in your own country, 
your own nation? Yes, he said, I be much O glad 
to be at my own nation. What would you do 
there? said I: would you turn wild again, eat 
men's flesh again, and be a savage as you were be- 
fore? He looked full of concern, and shaking his 
head, said, No, no, Friday tell them to live good, 
tell them to pray God, tell them to eat corn-bread, 
cattle-flesh, milk, no eat man again. Why then, 
said I to him, they will kill you. He looked 
grave at that, and then said, No, they no kill me, 
they willing love learn: he meant by this, they 
would be willing to learn. He added, they learned 
much of the bearded mans that came in the boat. 
Then I asked him, if he would go back to them? 
He smiled at that, and told me he could not swim 
so far. I told him I would make a canoe for him. 
He told me he would go, if I would go with him. 
I go ! said I, why they will eat me if I come 
there. No, no, says he, Me make them no eat 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. %97 

you. me make them much love you: he meant he 
would tell them how I had killed his enemies and 
saved his life, and so he would make them love me. 
Then he told me, as well as he could, how kind 
they were to seventeen white men, or bearded 
men, as he called them, who came on shore in dis- 
tress. 

From this time, I confess, I had a mind to 
venture over, and see if I could possibly join with 
these bearded men, who, I made no doubt, were 
Spaniards or Portuguese; not doubting but if I 
could, we might find some method to escape from 
thence, being upon the continent, and a good com- 
pany together, better than I could from an island 
forty miles off the shore, and alone without help. 
So, after some days, I took Friday to work again, 
by way of discourse; and told him, I would give 
him a boat to go back to his own nation ; and ac- 
cordingly I carried him to my frigate, which lay 
on the other side of the island ; and having cleared 
it of water (for I always kept it sunk in the water), 
I brought it out, shewed it him, and we both went 
into it. 

I found he was a most dexterous fellow at ma- 
naging it; he would make it go almost as swift and 
fast again as I could ; so when he was in, I said 
to him, Well, now Friday, shall we go to your 
nation? lie looked very dull at my saying so, 
which, it seems, was because he thought the boat 
too small to go so far. I told him then I had a 
bigger : so the next day I went to the place where 
the first boat lay which I had made, but which I 
could not get into the water : he said that was big 



£9$ life and adventures 

enough ; hut then, as I had taken no care of it, 
and it had lain two or three-and-twenty years 
there, the sun had split and dried it, that it was 
in a manner rotten. Friday told me, such a boat 
would do very well, and would carry ' much 
• enough vittle, drink, bread ;' that was his way of 
talking. 

Upon the whole, I was by this time so fixed 
upon my design of going over with him to the con- 
tinent, that I told him we would go and make one 
as big as that, and he should go home in it. He 
answered not one word, but looked very grave and 
sad. I asked him, what was the matter with him? 
He asked me again thus, Why you angry mad 
with Friday? what me done? I asked him what 
he meant? I told him I was not angry with him 
at all. No angry ! no angry! says he, repeating the 
words several times. Why send Friday home away 
to my nation? Why, said I, Friday, did you not say 
you wished you were there? Yes, yes, says he, 
wish he both there; no wish Friday there, no 
master there. In a word, he would not think of 
going there without me. I go there, Friday! said 
I, what should I do there? Fie turned very quick 
upon me at this. You do great deal much good, 
says he, you teach wild mans be good, sober, tame 
mans; you tell them know God, pray God, and 
live new life. Alas, Friday, said I, thou knowest 
not what thou say est; I am but an ignorant man 
myself. Yes, yes, says he, you teechee me good, 
you teechee them good. No, no, Friday, said I, 
you shall go without me; leave me here to live 
by myself, as I did before. Pie looked confused 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOli. 9Q9 

ascain at that word, and running to one of the hat- 
chets which he used to wear, he takes it up has- 
tily, and gives it me. What must I do with this? 
said I to him. You take kill Friday, says he. 
What must I kill you for? said I again. He re- 
turns very quick, What you send Friday away for? 
Take kill Friday, no send Friday away. This he 
spoke so earnestly, that I saw tears stand in his 
eyes. In a word, I so plainly discovered the ut- 
most affection in him to me, and a firm resolution 
in him, that I told him then, and often after, that 
I would never send him away from me, if he was 
willing to stay with me. 

Upon the whole, as I found by all his discourse 
a settled affection to me, and that nothing should 
part him from me, so I found all the foundation of 
his desire to go to his own country w r as laid in his 
ardent affection to the people, and his hopes of my 
doing them good; a thing, which as I had no no- 
tion of myself, so I had not the least thought, or 
intention, or desire of undertaking it: but still I 
found a strong inclination to my attempting an es- 
cape, as above, founded on the supposition ga- 
thered from the former discourse ; viz. that there 
were seventeen bearded men there: and therefore, 
without any delay, I went to work with Friday, to 
find out a great tree proper to fell, and make a 
large periagua or canoe, to undertake the voyage. 
There were trees enough in the island to have 
built a little fleet, not of periaguas and canoes only, 
but even of good large vessels: but the main thing 
I looked at, was to get one so near the water, 



300 LTFK AND A T) VENTURES 

that we might launch it when it was made, to 
avoid the mistake I committed at first. 

At last Friday pitched upon a tree; for I found 
he knew much better than I what kind of wood 
was fittest for it; nor can I tell to this clay what 
wood to call the tree we cut down, except that it 
was very like the tree we call fustic, or between 
that and the Nicaragua wood, for it was much of 
the same colour and smell. Friday was for burning 
the hollow or cavity of this tree out, to make it 
into a boat : but I shewed him how rather to cut it 
out with tools, which after I shewed him how to 
use, he did very handily; and in about a- month's 
hard labour we finished it, and made it very hand- 
some, especially when, with our axes, which I 
shewed him how to handle, we cut and hewed the 
outside into the true shape of a boat. After this, 
however, it cost us near a fortnight's time to get 
her along, as it were inch by inch, upon great 
rollers into the water: but when she was in, she 
would have carried twenty men with great ease. 

When she was in the water, and though she 
was so big, it amazed me to see with what dexte- 
rity and how swift my man Friday could manage 
her, turn her, and paddle her along; so I asked 
him if he would go, and if we might venture over 
in her? Yes, he said, he venture over in her very 
well, though great blow wind: however, I had a 
farther design that he knew nothing of, and that 
was to make a mast and sail, and to fit her with an 
anchor and cable. As to a mast, that was easy 
enough to gel; so I pitched upon a straight young 










/• .,, J //:■::'. ■.■.,./,/,/„ I" ....'/.//. /,.,,./,/.'\ 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 301 

cedar-tree, which I found near the place, and 
which there was a great plenty of in the island; 
and I set Friday to work to cut it down, and gave 
him directions how to shape and order it: but as 
to the sail, that was my particular care; I knew I 
had old sails or rather pieces of old sails enough ; 
but as I had had them now twenty-six years by me, 
and had not been very careful to preserve them, 
not imagining that I should ever have this kind of 
use for them, I did not doubt but they were all 
rotten; and indeed most of them were so: however, 
I found two pieces which appeared pretty good, 
and with these I went to work, and with a great 
deal of pains, and awkward tedious stitching (you 
may be sure) for want of needles, I at length 
made a three-cornered ugly thing, like what we 
call in England a shoulder-of-mutton sail, to go 
with a boom at bottom, and a little short sprit at 
the top, such as usually our ships long-boats sail 
with, and such as I best knew how to manage; 
because it was such an one as I used in the boat in 
which I made my escape from Barbary, as related 
in the first part of my story. 

I was near two months performing this last 
'work; viz. rigging and fitting my mast and sails; 
for I finished them very complete, making a 
small stay, and a sail or foresail to it, to assist, if 
we should turn to windward; and, which was more 
than all, I fixed a rudder to the stern of her, to 
steer with; and though I was but a bungling ship- 
wright, yet, as I knew the usefulness, and even 
necessity of such a thing, I applied myself with so 
much pains to do it, that at last I brought it to 



302 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

pass, though, considering the many dull contri- 
vances I had for it that failed, I think it cost me 
almost as much labour as making the boat. 

After all this was done, I had my man Friday to 
teach as to what belonged to the navigation of my 
boat; for though he knew very well how to pad- 
dle the canoe, he knew nothing what belonged to 
a sail and a rudder, and was the more amazed when 
he saw me work the boat to-and-again in the sea 
by the rudder, and how the sail gybed, and filled 
this way or that way, as the course we sailed 
changed; I say, when he saw this he stood like 
one astonished and amazed; however, with a little 
use, I made all these things familiar to him, and 
he became an expert sailor, except that as to the 
compass I could make him understand very little 
of that : on the other hand, as there was very little 
cloudy weather, and seldom or never any fogs in 
those parts, there was the less occasion for a com- 
pass, seeing the stars were always to be seen by 
night, and the shore by day, except in the rainy 
seasons; and then nobody cared to stir abroad, 
either by laud or sea. 

I was now entered on the seven-and-twentieth 
year of my captivity in this place ; though the three 
last years that I had this creature with me, ought 
rather to be left out of the account, my habita- 
tion being quite of another kind than in all the 
rest of my time. I kept the anniversary of my 
landing here with the same thankfulness to God 
for his mercies as at first; and if I had such cause 
of acknowledgment at first, I had much more so 
now, havipg such additional testimonies of the care 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 303 

of Providence over me, and the great hopes I had 
of being effectually and speedily delivered; for I 
had an invincible impression upon my thoughts, 
that my deliverance was at hand, and that I should 
not be another year in this place: however, I went 
on with my husbandry, digging, planting, and 
fencing, as usual; I gathered and cured my grapes, 
and did every necessary thing, as before. 

The rainy season was in the mean time upon me, 
when I kept more within doors than at other times; 
so I had stowed our new vessel as secure as we 
could, bringing her up into the creek, where, as 1 
said in the beginning, I landed my rafts from the 
ship; and haling her up to the shore, at high-water 
mark, I made my man Friday dig a little dock, 
just big enough for her to float in; and then, when 
the tide was out, we made a strong dam cross the 
end of it, to keep the water out; and so she lay 
dry, as to the tide, from tl>e sea; and to keep the 
rain off, we laid a great many boughs of trees so 
thick, that she was as well thatched as an house; 
and thus we waited for the months of November 
and December, in which I designed to make my 
adventure. 

When the settled season began to come in, as 
the thought of my design returned with the fair 
weather, I was preparing daily for the voyage; 
and the first thing I did was to lay up a certain 
quantity of provision, being the store for the voy- 
age; and intended, in a week or a fortnight's time, 
to open the dock, and launch out our boat; I was 
busy one morning upon something of this kind, 
when I called to Friday, and bid him go to the 



304? LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

sea-shore, and see if he could find a turtle or tor- 
toise, a thing which we generally got once a week, 
for the sake of the eggs, as well as the flesh. Fri- 
day had not heen long gone, when he came run- 
ning back, and flew over my outward wall, or 
fence, like one that felt not the ground, or the 
steps he set his feet on ; and before I had time to 
speak to him, he cried out to me, O master! O 
master! O sorrow! O bad! What's the matter, 
Friday, said I? O yonder there, says he, one, two, 
three, canoe! one, two, three! By this way of 
speaking I concluded there were six; but on in- 
quiry I found there were but three. Well, Friday, 
said I, do not be frighted; so I heartened him up 
as well as I could. However, I saw the poor fel- 
low most terribly scared; for nothing ran in his 
head but that they were come to look for him, and 
would cut him in pieces, and eat him ; the poor 
fellow trembled so, that I scarce knew what to do 
with him: I comforted him as well as I could, 
and told him I was in as much danger as he, and 
that they would eat me as well as him: but, said 
I, Friday, we must resolve to fight them : Can you 
fight, Friday? Me shoot, says he, but there come 
many great number. No matter for that, said I 
again, our guns will fright them that we do not 
kill. So I asked him, whether, if I resolved to 
defend him, he would defend me, and stand by 
me, and do just as I bade him? He said, Me die, 
when you bid die, master; so I went and fetched 
a good dram of rum, and gave him; for I had been 
so good an husband of my rum, that I had a great 
deal left: when he had drank it, I made him take 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 305 

the two fowling-pieces which we always carried, 
and load them with large swan shot as big as small 
pistol-bullets; then I took four muskets, and loaded 
them with two slugs, and five small bullets each; 
and my two pistols I loaded with a brace of bul- 
lets each: I hung my great sword, as usual, naked 
by my side, and gave Friday his hatchet. 

When I had thus prepared myself, I took my 
perspective-glass, and went up to the side of the 
hill, to see what I could discover; and I found 
quickly, by my glass, that there were one-and- 
twenty savages, three prisoners, and three canoes; 
and that their whole business seemed to be the 
triumphant banquet upon these three human bo- 
dies; a barbarous feast indeed, but nothing more 
than as I had observed was usual with them. 

I observed also, that they were landed, not where 
they had done when Friday made his escape, but 
nearer to my creek, where the shore was low, and 
where a thick wood came close almost down to 
the sea: this, with the abhorrence of the inhuman 
errand these wretches came about, so filled me with 
indignation, that I came down again to Friday, 
and told him, I was resolved to go down to them, 
and kill them all; and asked him if he would stand 
by me. He was now gotten over his fright, and 
his spirits being a little raised with the dram 1 had 
given him, he was very cheerful; and told me, as 
before, he would die when I bid die. 

In this fit of fury, I took first and divided the 
arms which 1 had charged, as before, between us; 
I gave Friday one pistol to stick in his girdle, and 
three guns upon his shoulder; and I took one pis- 

VOL. I X 



30(> LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

tol, and the other three myself; and in this posture 
we marched out. I took a small bottle of rum in 
my pocket, and gave Friday a large bag with more 
powder and bullets; and as to orders, I charged 
him to keep close behind me, and not to stir, shoot, 
or do any thing till I bid him; and in the mean 
time, not to speak a word : in this posture I fetched 
a compass to my right hand of near a mile, as well 
to get over the creek as to get into the wood; so 
that I might come within shot of them before I 
could be discovered, which I had seen by my glass 
it was easy to do. 

While I was making this march, my former 
thoughts returning, I began to abate my resolu- 
tion; I do not mean, that I entertained any fear 
of their number; for as they were naked, unarmed 
wretches, it is certain I was superior to them ; nay, 
though I had been alone: but it occurred to mv 
thoughts, what call, what occasion, much less 
what necessity, I was in to go and dip my hands 
in blood, to attack people who had neither done 
or intended me any wrong; who, as to me, were 
innocent, and whose barbarous customs were their 
own disaster, being in them a token indeed of 
God's having left them, with the other nations of 
that part of the world, to such stupidity and to 
such inhuman courses; but did not call me to take 
upon me to be a judge of their actions, much less 
an executioner of his justice; that whenever he 
thought fit, he would take the cause into his own 
hands, and by national vengeance punish them for 
national crimes; but that in the mean time, it was 
none of my business : that it was true, Friday might 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 307 

justify it, because he was a declared enemy, and 
in a state of war with those very particular people, 
and it was lawful for him to attack them; but I 
could not say the same with respect to me. These 
things were so warmly pressed upon my thoughts 
all the way as I went, that I resolved I would only 
go place myself near them, that I might observe 
their barbarous feast, and that I would act then, as 
.God should direct; but that unless something 
offered that was more a call to me than yet I knew 
of, I would not meddle with them. 

With this resolution I entered the wood, and 
with all possible wariness and silence (Friday fol- 
lowing close at my heels) I marched till I came 
to the skirt of the wood, on the side which was 
next to them; only that one corner of the wood 
lay between me and them : here I called softly to 
Friday, and shewing him a great tree, which was 
just at the corner of the wood, I bade him go to 
the tree, and bring me word if he could see there 
plainly what they were doing: he did so, and 
came immediately back to me, and told me they 
might be plainly viewed there; that they were all 
about the fire, eating the flesh of one of their pri- 
soners; and that another lay bound upon the sand, 
a little from them, whom he said they would kill 
next, and which fired the very soul within me. 
He told me, it was not one of their nation, but 
one of the bearded men whom he had told me of, 
who came to their country in the boat. I was 
filled with horror at the very naming the white- 
bearded man, and, going to the tree, I saw plainly, 
by my glass, a white man, who lay upon the beach 

X c 2 



308 LIFE AND ADVENTUUFS 

of the sea, with his hands and his feet tied with 
flags, or things like rushes; and that he was an 
European, and had clothes on. 

There was another tree, and a little thicket be- 
yond it, about fifty yards nearer to them than the 
place where I was, which, by going a little way 
about, I saw I might come at undiscovered, and 
that then I should be within half shot of them; so 
I withheld my passion, though I was indeed en- 
raged to the highest degree : and going back about 
twenty paces, I got behind some bushes, which 
held all the way till I came to the other tree, and 
then I came to a little rising ground, which gave 
me a full view of them, at the distance of about 
eighty yards. 

I had now not a moment to lose; for nineteen 
of the dreadful wretches sat upon the ground all 
close huddled together, and had just sent the other 
two to butcher the poor Christian, and bring him, 
perhaps limb by limb, to their fire; and they were 
stooped down to untie the bands at his feet. I 
turned to Friday; Now, Friday, said I, do as I bid 
thee. Friday said, he would. Then, Friday, said 
I, do exactly as you see me do; fail in nothing. 
So I set down one of the muskets and the fowling- 
piece upon the ground, and Friday did the like by 
his; and with the other musket I took my aim at 
the savages, bidding him do the like. Then ask- 
ing him if he was ready, he said, Yes. Then fire 
at them, said I; and the same moment I fired 
also. 

Fridav took his aim so much better than I, that 
on the side that he shot, he killed two of them, 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 309 

and wounded three more; and on my side, I killed 
one, and wounded two. They were, you may be 
sure, in a dreadful consternation: and all of them, 
who were not hurt, jumped up upon their feet im- 
mediately, but did not know which way to run, 
or which way to look; for they knew not from 
whence their destruction came. Friday kept his 
eyes close upon me, that as I had bid him, he 
might observe what I did; so as soon as the first 
shot was made, I threw down the piece, and took 
up the fowling-piece, and Friday did the like: he 
sees me cock, and present; he did the same again. 
Are you ready, Friday? said I. Yes, says he. Let 
fly then, said I, in the name of God; and with 
that I fired again among the amazed wretches, and 
so did Friday; and as our pieces were now loaden 
with what I called Swan-shot, or small pistol bul- 
lets, we found only two drop; but so many were 
wounded, that they ran about yelling and scream- 
ing like mad creatures, all bloody, and miserably 
wounded most of them; whereof three more fell 
quickly after, though not quite dead. 

Now, Friday, said I, laying down the discharged 
pieces, and taking up the musket, which was yet 
loaden, follow me, said I; which he did, with a 
deal 'of courage; upon which I rushed out of the 
wood, and showed myself, and Friday close at my 
foot: as soon as I perceived they saw me, I shouted 
as loud as I could, and bade Friday do so too; and 
running as fast as I could, which by the way was 
not very fast, being loaded with arms as I was, I 
made directly towards the poor victim, who was 
as I said, lying upon the beach, or shore, between 



$\Q LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

the place where they sat and the sea; the two 
butchers, who were just going to work with him, 
had left him, at the surprise of our first fire, and 
fled in a terrible fright to the sea-side, and had 
jumped into a canoe, and three more of the rest 
made the same way: I turned to Friday, and bade 
him step forwards, and fire at them; he understood 
me immediately, and running about forty yards to 
be near them, he shot at them, and I thought he 
had killed them all; for I saw them all fall on an 
heap into the boat; though I saw two of them up 
again quicfkly: however, he killed two of them, 
and wounded the third, so that he lay down in the 
bottom of the boat, as if he had been dead. 

While my man Friday fired at them, I pulled 

out my knife, and cut the flags that bound the 

poor victim ; and loosing his hands and feet I 

lifted him up, and asked him in the Portuguese 

tongue, what he was? He answered in Latin, 

Christianus; but was so weak and faint, that he 

could scarce stand, or speak; I took my bottle out 

of my pocket, and gave it him, making signs that 

he should drink, which he did; and I gave him a 

piece of bread, which he eat; then I asked him, 

what countryman he was? and he said, Espagnole; 

and, being a little recovered, let me know, by all 

the signs he could possibly make, how much he 

was in my debt for his deliverance. Seignior, said 

I, with as much Spanish as I could make up, we 

will talk afterwards, but we must fight now: if 

you have any strength left, take this pistol and 

sword, and lay about you: he took them very 

thankfully, and no sooner had he the arms in his 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 31 1 

hands, but as if they had put new vigour into him, 
he flew upon his mnrderers like a fury, and had 
cut two of them in pieces in an instant; for the 
truth is, as the whole was a surprise to them, so 
the poor creatures were so much frighted with 
the noise of our pieces, that they fell down for 
mere amazement and fear, and had no more power 
to attempt their own escape, than their flesh had 
to resist our shot; and that was the case of those 
five that Friday shot in the boat; for as three of 
them fell with the hurt they received, so the other 
two fell with the fright. 

I kept my piece in my hand still, without firing, 
being willing to keep my charge ready, because I 
had given the Spaniard my pistol and sword: so 
I called to Friday, and bade him run up to the 
tree from whence we first fired, and fetch the arms 
which lay there, that had been discharged, which 
he did with great swiftness; and then giving him 
my musket, I sat down myself to load all the rest 
again, and bade them come to me when they 
wanted. While I was loading these pieces, there 
happened a fierce engagement between the Spa- 
niard and one of the savages, who made at him 
with one of their great wooden swords, the same 
weapon that was to have killed him before, if I 
had not prevented it. The Spaniard, who was as bold 
and as brave as could be imagined, though weak, 
had fought this Indian a good while, and had cut 
him two great wounds on his head; but the savage, 
being a stout lusty fellow, closing in with him, 
had thrown him down (being faint), and was 
wringing my sword out of his hand, when the 
Spaniard, though undermost, wisely quitting his 



3\& LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

sword, drew the pistol from his girdle, shot the 
savage through the body, and killed him upon the 
spot, before I, who was running to help, could 
come near him. 

Friday, being now left at his liberty, pursued 
the flying wretches with no weapon in his hand 
but his hatchet; and with that he dispatched those 
three, who, as I said before, were wounded at first, 
and fallen, and all the rest he could come up with; 
and the Spaniard coming to me for a gun, I gave 
him one of the fowling pieces, with which he pur- 
sued two of the savages, and wounded them both; 
but as he was not able to run, they both got from 
him into the wood, where Friday pursued them, 
and killed one of them ; but the other was too 
nimble for him; and though he was wounded, yet 
he plunged into the sea, and swam with all his 
might off to those who were left in the canoe, 
which three in the canoe, with one wounded, who 
we know not whether he died or no, were all that 
escaped our hands of one-and- twenty. The ac- 
count of the rest is as follows: 

3 Killed at our shot from the tree. 

2 Killed at the next shot. 

2 Killed by Friday in the boat 

2 Killed by ditto, of those at first wounded. 
1 Killed by ditto, in the wood. 

3 Killed by the Spaniard. 

4 Killed, being found dropped here and there 
of their wounds, or killed by Friday in his 
chace of them. 

4 Escaped in the boat, whereof one wounded, 
if not dead. 
21 in all. 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 313 

Those that were in the canoe, worked hard to 
get out of gun-shot; and though Friday made two 
or three shot at them, I did not find that he hit 
any of them. Friday would fain have had me 
take one of their canoes, and pursue them; and in- 
deed I was very anxious about their escape, lest 
carrying the news home to their people, they 
should come back, perhaps, with two or three 
hundred of their canoes, and devour us by mere 
multitudes; so I consented to pursue them by sea; 
and running to one of their canoes, I jumped in, and 
bade Friday follow me; but when I was in the 
canoe, I was surprised to find another poor crea- 
ture lie there alive, bound hand and foot, as the 
Spaniard was, for the slaughter, and almost dead 
with fear, not knowing what the matter was ; for 
he had not been able to look up over the side of the 
boat, he was tied so hard, neck and heels, and had 
been tied so long, that he had really little life in 
him. 

I immediately cut the twisted flags, or rushes, 
which they had bound him with, and would have 
helped him up; but he could not stand, or speak^ 
but groaned most piteously, believing, it seems 
still, that he was onlv unbound in order to be 
killed. 

When Friday came to him, I bade him speak to 
him, and tell him of his deliverance ; and pulling 
out my bottle, made him give the poor wretch a 
dram, which, with the news of his being delivered, 
revived him, and he sat up in the boat; but when 
Friday came to hear him speak, and looked in his 



314 1IFE AND ADVENTURES 

face, it would have moved any one to tears, to have 
seen how Friday kissed him, embraced him, hugged 
him, cried, laughed, hallooed, jumped about, 
danced, sung, then cried again, wrung his hands, 
beat his own face and head, and then sung and 
jumped about again like a distracted creature. It 
was a good while before I could make him speak 
to me, or tell me what was the matter; but when 
he came a little to himself, he told me that it was 
his father. 

It was not easy for me to express how it moved 
me, to see what ecstasy and filial affection had 
worked in this poor savage, at the sight of his fa- 
ther, and of his being delivered from death; nor 
indeed can I describe half the extravagancies of his 
affection after this; for he went into the boat and 
out of the boat a great many times: when he went 
in to him, he would sit down by him, open his 
breast, and hold his father's head close to his bo- 
som half an hour together, to nourish it ; then he 
took his arms and ankles, which were numbed and 
stiff with the binding, and chafed and rubbed them 
with his hands; and I, perceiving what the case 
was, gave him some rum out of my bottle to rub 
them with, which did them a great deal of good. 

This action put an end to our pursuit of the 
canoe with the other savages, who were now gotten 
almost out of sight; and it was happy for us that 
we did not; for it blew so hard within two. hours 
after, and before they could be gotten a quarter of 
their way, and continued blowing so hard all night, 
and that from the north-west, which was against 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 315 

them, that I could not suppose their boat could 

live, or that they <5ver reached to their own coast. 

But to return to Friday; he was so busy about 

his father, that I could not find in my heart to take 

him off for some time : but after I thought he could 

leave him a little, I called him to me, and he came 

jumping and laughing, and pleased to the highest 

extreme. Then I asked him, if he had given his 

father any bread? He shook his head, and said, 

None: ugly dog eat all up self. So I gave him a 

cake of bread out of a little pouch I carried on 

purpose; I also gave him a dram for himself, but 

he would not taste it, but carried it to his father. 

I had in my pocket also two or three bunches of 

my raisins, so I gave him a handful of them for 

his father. He had no sooner given his father 

these raisins, but I saw him come out of the boat, 

and run away as if he had been bewitched. He 

ran at such a rate, (for he was the swiftest fellow 

of his feet that ever I saw) I say, he ran at 

such a rate, that he was out of sight, as it were, 

in a instant; and though I called and hallooed too 

after him, it was all one; away he went, and in a 

quarter of an hour I saw him come back again, 

though not so fast as he went; and as he came 

nearer, I found his pace was slacker, because he 

had something in his hand. 

When he came up to me, I found he had been 
quite home for an earthen jug, or pot, to bring his 
father some fresh water; and that he had got two 
more cakes or loaves of bread. The bread he gave 
me, but the water he carried to his father: how- 
ever, as I was very thirsty too, I took a little sup 



316 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

of it: this water revived his father more than all 
the rum or spirits I had given him; for he was 
just fainting with thirst. 

When his father had drank, I called him, to 
know if there was any water left; he said, Yes; and 
I bade him give it to the poor Spaniard, who was 
in as much want of it as his father; and I sent one 
of the cakes, that Friday brought, to the Spaniard 
too, who was indeed very weak, and was reposing 
himselt upon a green place, under the shade of a 
tree, and whose limbs were also very stiff, and 
very much swelled with the rude bandage he had 
been tied with: when I saw that upon Friday's 
coming to him with the water, he sat up and drank, 
and took the bread, and began to eat, I went to 
him, and gave him an handful of raisins; he looked 
up in my face with all the tokens of gratitude and 
thankfulness that could appear in any countenance; 
but was so weak, notwithstanding he had so exerted 
himself in the fight, that he could not stand upon 
his feet; he tried to do it two or three times, but 
was really not able, his ankles were so swelled and 
so painful to him; so I bade him sit still, and 
caused Friday to rub his ankles, and bathe them 
with rum, as he had done his father's. 

I observed the poor affectionate creature every 
two minutes, or perhaps less, all the while he was 
here, turned his head about, to see if his father was 
in the same place and posture as he left him 
sitting; and at last he found he was not to be 
seen; at which he started up, and, without speak- 
ing a word, flew with that swiftness to him, that 
one could scarce perceive his feet to touch the

OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 317 

ground as he went: but when he came, he only 
found he had laid himself down to ease his limbs: 
so Friday came back to me presently, and I then 
spoke to the Spaniard to let Friday help him up, 
if he could, and lead him to the boatjand then he 
should carry him to our dwelling, where I would 
take care of him : but Friday, a lusty young fellow, 
took the Spaniard quite up upon his back, and car- 
ried him away to the boat, and set him down softly 
upon the side or gunnel of the canoe, with his 
feet in the inside of it, and then lifted them quite 
in, and set him close to his father, and presently 
stepping out again, launched the boat off, and 
paddled it along the shore faster than I could walk, 
though the wind blew pretty hard too; so he 
brought them both safe into our creek; and leav- 
ing them in the boat, runs away to fetch the other 
canoe. As he passed me, I spoke to him, and 
asked him, whither he went? He told me, Go 
fetch more boat; so away he went like the wind; 
for sure never man or horse ran like him, and he 
had the other canoe in the creek almost as soon as 
I got to it by land ; so he wafted me over, and then 
went to help our new guests out of the boat, 
which he did; but they were neither of them 
able to walk; so that poor Friday knew not what 
to do. 

To remedy this, I went to work in my thought, 
and calling to Friday to bid them sit down on the 
bank while he came to me, I soon made a kind of 
hand-barrow to lay them on, and Friday and I car- 
ried them up both together upon it between us; 
but when we got them to the outside of our wall or 



$18 MFE AND ADVENTURES 

fortification, we were at a worse loss than before; 
for it was impossible to get them over; and I was 
resolved not to break it down : so I set to work 
again; and Friday and I, in about two hours time, 
made a very handsome tent, covered with old sails, 
and above that with boughs of trees, being in the 
space without our outward fence, and between 
that and the grove of young wood which I had 
planted; and here we made two beds of such 
things as I had; viz. of good rice-straw, with 
blankets laid upon it to lie on, and another to 
cover them on each bed. 

My island was now peopled, and I thought my- 
self very rich in subjects; and it was a merry re- 
flection which I frequently made, how like a king 
I looked: first of all the whole country was my own 
mere property; so that I had an undoubted right 
of dominion; 2dly, My people were perfectly sub- 
jected. I was absolute lord and lawgiver; they 
all owed their lives to me, and were ready to lay 
down their lives, if there had been occasion for it, 
for me: it was remarkable too, I had but three 
subjects, and they were of three different religions. 
My man Friday was a protestant, his father a pagan 
and a cannibal; and the Spaniard was a papist: 
however, I allowed liberty of conscience through- 
out my dominions : but this by the way. 

As soon as I had secured my two weak rescued 
prisoners, and given them shelter, and a place to 
rest them upon, I began to think of making some 
provision for them; and the first thing I did, I 
ordered Friday to take a yearling goat, betwixt a 
kind and a goat, out of my particular flock, to be 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 319 

killed : then I cut off the hind quarter, and, chop- 
ping it into small pieces, I set Friday to work 
to boiling and stewing, and made them a very good 
dish, I assure you, of flesh and broth; having put 
some barley and rice also into the broth, and as I 
cooked it without doors (for I made no fire within 
my inner wall) so I carried it all into the new 
tent; and having set a table there for them, I sat 
down and eat my dinner also with them ; and, as 
well as I could, cheered them and encouraged 
them, Friday being my interpreter, especially to 
his father, and indeed to the Spaniard too; for the 
Spaniard spoke the language of the savages pretty 
well. 

After we had dined, or rather supped, I ordered 
Friday to take one of the canoes, and go and fetch 
our musquets and other fire-arms, which, for want 
of time, we had left upon the place of battle; and 
the next day I ordered him to go and bury the dead 
bodies of the savages, which lay open to the sun, 
and would presently be offensive ; and I also ordered 
him to bury the horrid remains of their barbarous 
feast, which I knew were pretty much, and which 
I could not think of doing myself; nay, I could 
not bear to see them, if I went that way; all which 
he punctually performed, and defaced the very ap- 
pearance of the savages being there; so that when 
I went again, I could scarce know where it was, 
otherwise than by the corner of the wood pointing 
to the place. 

I then began to enter into a little conversation 
with my two new subjects; and first I set Friday 
to inquire of his father, what bethought of the 



320 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

escape of the savages in that canoe ? and whether 
he might expect a return of them with a power 
too great for us to resist? His first opinion was, 
that the savages in the boat never could live out 
the storm which blew that night they went off, 
but must of necessity be drowned or«driven south 
to those other shores, where they were as sure to 
be devoured, as they were to be drowned if they 
were cast away; but as to what they would do if 
they came safe on shore, he said he knew not; but 
it was his opinion, that they were so dreadfully 
frighted with the manner of being attacked, the 
noise, and the fire, that he believed they would 
tell their people they were all killed by thunder 
and lightning, and not by the hand of man; and 
that the two which appeared (viz. Friday and I) 
were two heavenly spirits or furies come down to 
destroy them, and not men with weapons. This, 
he said, he knew, because he heard them cry out 
so in their language to one another; for it was im- 
possible for them to conceive that a man should 
dart fire, and speak thunder, and kill at a distance, 
without lifting up the hand, as was done now. 
And this old savage was in the right, for, as I un- 
derstood since by other hands, the savages of that 
part never attempted to go over to the island af- 
terwards. They were so terrified with the accounts 
given by these four men (for it seems they did 
escape the sea), that they believed whoever went 
to that enchanted island, would be destroyed with 
fire from the eods. 

This, however, I knew not, and therefore was 
under continual apprehensions for a good while, 



OF ROBINSON* CRUSOE* 321 

and kept always upon my guard, I and all mv 
army; for as there were now four of us, I would 
have ventured upon an hundred of them fairly in 
the open field at any time. 

In a little time, however, no more canoes ap- 
pearing, the fear of their coming wore off, and I 
began to take my former thoughts of a voyao-e to 
the main into consideration, being likewise as- 
sured by Friday's father, that I might depend upon 
good usage from their nation on his account, if I 
would go. 

But my thoughts were a little suspended, when 
I had a serious discourse with the Spaniard, and 
when I understood, that there were sixteen more 
of his countrymen and Portuguese, who having 
been cast away, and made their escape to that side, 
lived there at peace indeed with the savages, but 
were very sore put to it for necessaries, and indeed 
for life. I asked him all the particulars of their 
voyage, and found they were a Spanish ship, 
bound from the Rio de la Plata to the Havanna, 
being directed to leave their loading there, which 
was chiefly hides and silver, and to bring back 
what European goods they could meet with there; 
that they had five Portuguese seamen on board, 
whom they took out of another wreck; that 
five of their own men were drowned when first 
the ship was lost; and that these escaped through 
infinite dangers and hazards, and arrived almost 
starved on the Cannibal coast, where they ex- 
pected to have been devoured every moment. 

He told me, they had some arms with them, but 
they were perfectly useless, for that they had neither 

VOL. I- Y 



322 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

powder or ball, the washing of the sea having 
spoiled ail their powder, but a little which they 
used at their first landing to provide themselves 
some food. 

I asked him what he thought would become of 
them there; and if they had formed no design of 
making any escape? He said, they had many con- 
sultations about it; but that having neither vessel, 
nor tools to build one, or provisions of any 
kind, their counsels always ended in tears and de- 
spair. 

I asked him, how he thought they would receive 
a proposal from me, which might tend towards an 
escape; and whether, if they were all here, it might 
not be done? I told him with freedom, I feared 
mostly their treachery and ill usage of me, if I put 
my life in their hands; for that gratitude was no 
inherent virtue in the nature of man;" nor did men 
always square their dealings by the obligations they 
had received, so much as they did by the advan- 
tages they expected. I told him, it would be very 
hard, that 1 should be the instrument of their deli- 
verance, and that they should afterwards make me 
their prisoner in New Spain, where an Englishman 
was certain to be made a sacrifice, what necessity, 
or what accident soever, brought him thither; and 
that I had rather be delivered up to the savages, 
and be devoured alive, than fall into the merciless 
claws of the priests, and be carried into the inqui- 
sition. I added, that otherwise I was persuaded, 
if they were all here, we might, with so many 
hands, build a bark large enough to carry us all 
away either to the Brasils southward, or to the 



OF ROBINSODf CRUSOE- 32S 

islands or Spanish coast northward r tut that if in 
requital they should, when I had put weapons into 
their hands, carry me by force among their own 
people, I might be ill used for my kindness to 
them, and make my case worse than it was before. 

He answered, with a great deal of candour and 
ingenuity, that their condition was so miserable, 
and they were so sensible of it, that he believed 
they would abhor the thought of using any man 
unkindly that should contribute to their deliver- 
ance; and that, if I pleased, he would go to them 
with the old man, and discourse with them about 
it, and return again, and bring me their answer: 
that he would make conditions with them upon 
their solemn oath, that they would be absolutely 
under my leading, as their commander and captain; 
and that they should swear upon the holy sacra- 
ments and. gospel, to be true to me, and go to such 
christian country as I should agree to, and no 
other; and to be directed wholly and absolutely 
by my orders, till they were landed safely in such 
country as I intended; and that he would bring a 
contract from them under their hands for that 
purpose. 

Then he told me, he would first swear to me 
himself, that he would never stir from me as long 
as he lived, till I gave him order; and that he 
would take my side to the last drop of blood, if 
there should happen the least breach of faith among 
}iis countrymen. 

He told me, they were all of them very civil 
honest men, and they were under the greatest dis- 
tress imaginable, having neither weapons or clothes, 

x 2

nor any food^ but at the mercy and discretion of 
the savages; out of all hopes of ever returning to 
their own country; and that he was sure, if I 
would undertake their relief, they would live and 
die by me. 

Upon these assurances, I resolved to venture to 
relieve them, if possible, and to send the old savage 
and this Spaniard over to them to treat: but when 
he had gotten all things in readiness to go, the 
Spaniard himself started an objection, which had 
so much prudence in it on one hand, and so much 
sincerity on the other hand, that I could not but 
be very well satisfied in it; and, by his advice, 
put off the deliverance of his comrades for at least 
half a year* The case was thus : 

He had been with us now about a month; du- 
ring which time I had let him see in what manner 
I had provided, with the assistance of Providence, 
for my support; and he saw evidently what stock 
of corn and rice I had lain up; which, as it was 
more than sufficient for myself so it was not suf- 
ficient, at least without good husbandry, for my 
family, now it was increased to number four: but 
much less would it be sufficient, if his country- 
men, who were, as he said, fourteen still alive, 
should come over; and least of all would it be suf- 
ficient to victual our vessel, if we should build 
one, for a vova<re to anv of the christian colonies 
of America. So he told me, he thought it would 
be more adviseable, to let him and the other two 
dig and cultivate some more land, as much as I 
could spare seed to sow; and that we should wait 
another harvest, that we might have a supply of 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 525 

corn for his countrymen when they should come; 
for want might be a temptation to them to disa- 
gree, or not to think themselves delivered, other- 
wise than out of one difficulty into another. You 
know, says he, the children of Israel, though they 
rejoiced at first at their being delivered out of 
Egypt, yet rebelled even against God himself, that 
delivered them, when they came to want bread in 
the wilderness. 

His caution was so seasonable, and his advice sq 
good, that I could not but be very well pleased 
with his proposal; as ^vell as I was satisfied with 
his fidelity: so we fell to digging, ail four of us, 
as well as the wooden tools we were furnished 
with permitted; and in about a month's time, by 
the end of which it was seed-time, we had gotten 
as much land cured and trimmed up as we sowed 
twenty-two bushels of barley on, and sixteen jars 
of rice, which was, in short, all the seed we had 
to spare; nor indeed did We leave ourselves barley 
sufficient for our own food for the six months that 
we had to expect our crop, that is to say, reckon- 
ing from the time we set our seed aside for sowing; 
for it is not to be supposed it is six months in the 
ground in that country. 

Having; now societv enough, and our number 
being sufficient to put us out of fear of the savages, 
if they had come, unless their number had been 
very great, we went freely all over the island, 
wherever we found occasion; and as here we had 
our escape or deliverance upon our thoughts, it 
was impossible, at least for me, to have the means 
pf it out of mine; to this purpose, I marked out 



$%6 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

several trees, which I thought fit for our work, 
and I set Friday and his father to cutting them 
down; and then I caused the Spaniard, to whom 
I imparted my thoughts on that affair, to oversee 
and direct their work: I shewed them with what 
indefatigable pains I had hewed a large tree into 
single planks, and I caused them to do the like, 
till they had made about a dozen large planks of 
good oak, near two feet broad, thirty-five feet long, 
and from two inches to four inches thick: what 
prodigious labour it took up, any one may imagine. 

At the same time I contrived to increase my 
little flock of tame goats as much as I could; and 
to this purpose I made Friday and the Spaniard to 
go out one day, and myself, with Friday, the next 
day, for we took our turns : and by this means we 
got about twenty young kids to breed up with the 
rest: for whenever we shot the dam, we saved the 
kids, and added them to our flock: but, above all, 
the season for curing the grapes coming on, I 
caased such a prodigious quantity to be hung up 
in the sun, that I believe, had we been at Alicant, 
"where the raisins of the sun are cured, we should 
have filled sixty or eighty barrels; and these, with 
our bread, was a great part of our food, and very 
good living too, I assure you; for it is an exceed- 
ing nourishing food. 

It- was now harvest, and our crop in good order: 
it was not the most plentiful increase I had seen 
in the island, but, however, it was enough to an- 
swer cur end; for from twenty-two bushels of 
barley, we brought in and threshed out above two 
hundred and twenty bushels, and the like in pro : 



OV ROBINSON CRUSOE. S27 

portion of the rice, which was store enough for 
our food to the next harvest, though all the six- 
teen Spaniards had been on shore with me; or, if 
we had been ready for a voyage, it would very 
plentifully have victualled our ship, to have car- 
ried us to any part of the world, that is to say, of 
America. When we had thus housed and secured 
our magazine of corn, we fell to work to make 
more wicker-work; viz. great baskets, in which 
we kept it; and the Spaniard was very handy and 
dexterous at this part, and often blamed me, that 
I did not make some things for defence of this 
kind of work; but I saw no need of it. And now, 
having a full supply of food for all the guests ex- 
pected, I gave the Spaniard leave to go over to 
the main, to see what he could do with those he 
left behind him there. I gave him a strict charge 
in writing not to bring any man with him, who 
would not first swear, in the presence of himself 
and of the old savage, that he would no way in- 
jure, fight with, or attack the person he should 
find in the island, who was so kind to send for 
them in order to their deliverance; but that they 
would stand by and defend him against all such 
attempts; and wherever they went, would be en- 
tirely under, and subjected to his command; and 
that this should be put in writing, and signed with 
their hands: how we were to have this done, when 
I knew they had neither pen or ink, that indeed 
was a question which we never asked. 

Under these instructions, the Spaniard, and the 
©Id savage (the father of Friday) went away in 



S2B LIFE AND ADVENTURES

one of the canoes, which they might be said t& 
come in, or rather were brought in, when they 
came as prisoners to be devoured by the savages. 

I gave each of them a musket with a firelock 
on it, and about eight charges of powder and ball, 
charging them to be very good husbands of both, 
and not to use either of them hut upon urgent 
occasions. 

This was a cheerful work, being the first mea- 
sures used by me in view of my deliverance for 
now 9.7 years and some days; I gave them provi- 
sions of bread, and of dried grapes, sufficient for 
themselves for many days, and sufficient for their 
countrymen for about eight days time; and wish- 
ing them a good voyage, I let them go, agreeing 
with them about a signal they should hang out at 
their return, by which I should know them again, 
when they came back, at a distance, before they 
came on shore. 

They went away with a fair gale on the day 
that the moon was at the full; by my account in 
the month of October; but as for the exact reck- 
oning of days, after I had once lost it, I could 
never recover it again; nor had I kept even the 
number of years so punctually, as to be sure that 
I was right, though, as it proved when I after- 
wards examined my account, I found I had kept 
a true reckoning of years. 

It was no less than eight days I waited for them, 
when a strange and unforeseen accident intervened> 
of which the like has not, perhaps, been heard of 
in history. I was fast asleep in my hutch png 



OF ROBINSON" CRUSOE. 329 

morning, when my man Friday came running in 
to me, and called aloud, Master, master, they are 
come, they are come. 

I jumped up, and, regardless of danger, I went 
out as soon as I could get my clothes on, through 
my little grove, which (hy the way) was by this 
time grown to be a vety thick wood; I say, re- 
gardless of danger, I went without my arms, which 
was not my custom to do; but I was surprised, 
when, turning my eyes to the sea, I presently saw 
a boat at about a league and a half's distance, 
standing in for the shore, with a shoulder of mutton 
sail, as they call it, and the wind blowing pretty 
fair to bring them in: also I observed presently, 
that they did not come from that side which the 
shore lay on, but from the southermost end of the 
island. Upon this I called Friday in, and bid him 
lie close, for these were not the people we looked 
for, and that we did not know yet whether they 
were friends or enemies. 

In the next place, I went in to fetch my perspec- 
tive glass, to see what I could make of them; and 
having taken the ladder out, I climbed up to the 
top of the hill, as I used to do when I was appre- 
hensive of any thing, and to take my view the 
plainer without being discovered. 

I had scarce set my foot on the hill, when my 
eye plainly discovered a ship lying at an anchor, 
at about two leagues and a half's distance from 
me, S. S. E., but not above a league and a half 
from the shore. By my observation it appeared 
plainly to be an English ship, and the boat appeared 
to be an English long-boat. 



350 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

I cannot express the confusion I was in, though 
the joy of seeing a ship, and one whom I had rea- 
son to believe was manned by my own country- 
men, and consequently friends, was such as I can- 
not describe; but yet I had some secret doubts 
hung about me, I cannot tell from whence they 
came, bidding me keep upon my guard. In the 
first place it occurred to me to consider what busi- 
ness an English ship could have in that part of the 
world; since it was not the way to or from any 
part of the world where the English had any traf- 
iick; and I knew there had been no storms to drive 
them in there, as in distress; and if they were 
English really, it was most probable that they 
were here upon no good design; and that I had 
tetter continue as I was, than fall into the hands 
of thieves and murderers. 

Let no man despise the secret hints and notices 
of danger, which sometimes are given him when 
he may think there is no possibility of its being 
real. That such hints and notices are given us, 
I believe few that have made any observations of 
things can deny; that they are certain discoveries 
of an invisible world, and a converse of spirits, we 
cannot doubt; and if the tendency of them seems 
to be to warn us of danger, why should we not 
suppose they are from some friendly agent (whe- 
ther supreme, or inferior and subordinate, is not 
the question), and that they are given for our 
good ? 

The present question abundantly confirms me in 
the justice of this reasoning; for had I not been 
made cautious by this secret admonition, come 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 351 

from whence it will, I had been undone inevitably, 
and in a far worse condition than before, as vou 
will see presently. 

I had not kept myself long in this posture, but I 
saw the boat draw near the shore, as if they looked 
for a creek to thrust in at for the convenience of 
landing; however, as they did not come quite far 
enough, they did not see the little inlet where I 
formerly landed my rafts, but run their boat on 
shore upon the beach, at about half a mile from 
me, which was very happy for me; for otherwise 
they would have landed just, as I may say, at my 
door, and would have soon beaten me out of my 
castle, and, perhaps, have plundered me of all I 
had. 

When they were on shore, I was fully satisfied 
they were Englishmen, at least most of them; one 
or two I thought were Dutch, but it did not prove 
so; there were in all eleven men, whereof three 
of them I found were unarmed, and (as I thought) 
bound; and when the first four or five of them 
were jumped on shore, they took those three out 
of the boat as prisoners. One of the three I could 
perceive using the most passionate gestures of en- 
treaty, affliction, and despair, even to a kind of 
extravagance; the other two, I could perceive, 
lifted up their hands sometimes, and appeared con- 
cerned indeed, but not to such a degree as the 
first. 

I was perfectly confounded at the sight, and 
knew not what the meaning of it should be. Fri- 
day called out to me in English, as well as he could, 



332 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

master! you see English mans eat prisoners as 
well as savage mans. Why, said I, Friday, do you 
think they are going to eat them then? Yes, says 
Friday, they will eat them. No, v.o, said I, Fri- 
day; lam afraid they will murder them indeed; 
but you may be sure they will not eat them. 

All this while I had no thought of what the mat- 
ter really was, but stood trembling with horror 
of the sight, expecting every moment when the 
three prisoners should be killed; nay, once I saw 
one of the villians lift up his arm with a great cut- 
lace (as the seamen call it) or sword, to strike one 
of the poor men; and I expected to see him fall 
every moment, at which all the blood in my body 
seemed to run chill in my veins. 

I wished heartily now for our Spaniard, and the 
savage that was gone with him; or that I had any 
way to have come undiscovered within shot of 
them, that I might have rescued the three men; 
for I saw no fire-arms they had among them; but 
it fell out to my mind another way. 

After I had observed the outrageous usage of 
the Three- men by the insolent seamen, I observed 
the fellows ran scattering about the land, as if 
they wanted to see the country. I observed also, 
that the three other men had iiberty to go where 
they pleased; but they sat down all three upon 
the ground very pensive, and looked like men in 
despair. 

This put me in mind of the first time when I 
came on shore, and began to look about me; how 

1 gave myself over for lost, how wildly I looked 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 333 

round me, what dreadful apprehensions I had, and 
how I lodged in the tree all night for fear of being- 
devoured by wild beasts. 

As I knew nothing} that night of the supply I 
I was to receive by the providential driving of 
the ship nearer the land, by the storms and tides, 
bv which I have since been so long nourished and 
supported; so these three poor desolate men knew 
nothing how certain of deliverance and supply 
they were, how near it was to them, and how ef- 
fectually and really they were in a condition of 
safety, at the same time they thought themselves 
lost, and their case desperate. 

So little do we see before us in the world, and 
so much reason have we to depend cheerfully upon 
the great Maker of the world, that he does not 
leave his creatures so absolutely destitute, but that 
in the worst circumstances they have alwa\'S some- 
thing to be thankful for, and sometimes are nearer 
their deliverance than they imagine; nay, are 
even brought to their deliverance by the means by 
which they seem to be brought to their destruc- 
tion. 

It was just at the top of high- water when these 
people came on shore, and while partly they stood 
parly ing with the prisoners they brought, and 
partly while they rambled about to see what kind 
of place they were in, they had carelessly staid till 
the tide was spent, and the water was ebbed con- 
siderably away, leaving their boat aground. 

They had left two men in the boat, who, as I 
found afterwards, bavins: drank a little too much 
brandy, fell asleep; however, one of them waking 



334 XI1<E AND ADVENTURES 

sooner than the other, and finding the boat too 
fast aground for him to stir it, hallooed for the 
rest who were straggling about, upon which they 
all soon came to the boat; but it was past all their 
strength to launch her, the boat being very heavy, 
and the shore on that side being a soft oosy sand, 
almost like a quicksand. 

In this condition, like true seamen, who are, 
perhaps, the least of all mankind given to fore- 
thought, they gave it over, and away they strolled 
about the country again ; and I heard one of them 
say aloud to another (calling them off from the 
boat), Why let her alone, Jack, can't ye? she'll 
float next tide. By which I was fully confirmed in 
the main inquiry, of what countrymen they were. 

All this while I kept myself close, not once dar- 
ing to stir out of my castle, any further than to 
my place of observation, near the top of the hill; 
and very glad I was, to think how well it was for- 
tified. I knew it was no less than ten hours be- 
fore the boat could be on float again, and by that 
time it would be dark, and I might be more at 
liberty to see their motions, and to hear their dis- 
course, if they had any. 

In the mean time I fitted myself up for a battle, 
as before, though with more caution, knowing I 
had to do with another kind of enemy than 1 had 
at first. I ordered Friday also, whom I had made 
an excellent marksman with his gun, to load him- 
self with arms. I took myself two fowling-pieces, 
and I gave him three rnusquets: my figure, indeed, 
was very fierce; I had my formidable goat-skin 
coat on, with the great cap I mentioned, a naked 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 335 

sword, two pistols in my belt, and a gun upon 
each shoulder. 

It was my design, as I said above, not to have 
made any attempt till it was dark; but about two 
o'clock, being the heat of the day, I found that in 
short they were all gone straggling into the woods, 
and, as I thought, were all laid down to sleep : the 
three poor distressed men, too anxious for their 
condition to get any sleep, were however set down 
under the shelter of a great tree, at about a quar- 
ter of a mile from me, and, as I thought, out[of 
sight of any of the rest. 

Upon this I resolved to discover myself to them, 
and learn something of their condition. Immedi- 
ately I marched in the figure above, my man Fri- 
day at a good distance behind me, as formidable 
for his arms as I, but not making quite so staring* 
a spectre-like figure as I did. 

I came as near them undiscovered as I could, 
and them, before any of them saw me, I called 
aloud to them in Spanish, What are ye, Gentle- 
men? 

They started up at the noise; but were ten times 
more confounded when they saw me, and the un- 
couth figure that I made: they made no answer 
at all, but I thought I perceived them just going 
to fly from me, when I spoke to them in English. 
Gentlemen, said I, do not be surprised at me; per- 
haps you may have a friend near you, when you 
did not expect it. He must be sent directly from 
Heaven then, said one of them very gravely to 
me, pulling off his hat at the same time, for our 

I condition is past the help of man. All help i< from 



336 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

Heaven, Sir, said I: but can you put a stranger in 
the way how to help you? For you seem to me 
to be in some great distress. I saw you when you 
landed; and when you seemed to make application 
to the brutes that came with you — I saw one of 
them lift up his sword to kill you. 

The poor man with tears running down his face, 
and trembling, looking like one astonished, re- 
turned, Am I talking to God or man? Is it a real 
man, or an angel? Be in no fear about that, Sir, 
said I: if God had sent an angel to relieve you, 
he would have come better clothed, and armed 
after another manner than you see me in; pray 
lay aside your fears; I am a man, an Englishman, 
and disposed to assist you; you see I have one ser- 
vant only; we have arms and ammunition; tell us 
freely, Can we serve you? What is your case? 

Our case, said he, Sir, is too long to tell you, 
while our murderers are so near; but in short, Sir, 
I was commander of that ship; my men having 
mutinied against me, they have been hardly pre- 
vailed on not to murder me, and at last have set 
me on shore in this desolate place, with these two 
men with me, one my mate, the other a passenger; 
where we expected to perish, believing the place 
to be uninhabited, and know not what to think 
of it. 

Where are those brutes, your enemies? said I; 
Do you know where they- are gone? There they 
are, Sir, said he, pointing to a thicket of trees, 7 my 
heart trembles for fear they have seen us, and 
heard you speak; if they have, they will certainly 
murder us all. 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 337 

Have they any fire-arms? said I: he answered, 
they had only two pieces, and one which they left 
in the boat. Well then, said I, leave the rest to 
me; I see they are all asleep; it is an easy thing 
to kill them all; but shall we rather take them 
prisoners? He told me there were two desperate 
villains among them, that it was scarce safe to 
shew any mercy to; but if they were secured, he 
believed all the rest would return to their duty. 
I asked him, Which they were? He told me, he 
could not at that distance describe them; but he 
would obey my orders in any thing I would direct. 
Well, said I, let us 'retreat out of their view or 
hearing, lest they awake, and we will resolve far- 
ther; so they willingly w r ent back with me, till 
.the woods covered us from them. 

Look you, Sir, said I, if I venture upon your 
deliverance, are you willing to make two condi- 
tions with me? He anticipated my proposals, by 
telling me, that both he and the ship, if recovered, 
should be wholly directed and commanded by me 
in every thing; and if the ship was not recovered, 
he would live and die with me in what part of the 
world soever I would send him ; and the two other 
men said the same. 

Well, said I, my conditions are but two: 1. 
That while you stay on this island with me, you 
will not pretend to any authority here; and if I 
put arms into your hands, you will upon all occa- 
sions give them up to me, and do no prejudice to 
me or mine, upon this island, and in the mean 
time to be governed by my orders. 

% That if the ship is, or may be recovered, you

will carry me and my man to England, passage 
free. 

He gave me all the assurance that the invention 
and faith of a man could devise, that he would 
comply with these most reasonable ie n a rids; and 
besides, would owe his life to me, and acknow- 
ledge it upon all occasions as long as he lived. 

Well then, said I, here are three muskets for 
you, with powder and ball; tell me next what you 
think is proper to be done: he shewed all the tes- 
timony of his gratitude that he was able; but of- 
fered to be wholly guided by me: I told him, I 
thought it was hard venturing any thing; but the 
best method I could think of, was to fire upon 
them at once, as they lay; and if any were not 
killed at the first volley, and offered to submit, 
we might save them, and so put it wholly upon 
God's providence to direct the shot. 

He said, very modestly, that he was loth to kill 
them, if he could help it; but that those two were 
incorrigible villains, and had been the authors of 
all the mutiny in the ship; and if they escaped, 
we should be undone still: for they would go on 
board, and bring the whole ship's company, and 
destroy us all. Well then, said I, necessity legiti- 
mates my advice; for it is the only way to save 
our lives. However, seeing him still cautious of 
shedding blood, I told him, they should go them- 
selves, and manage as they found convenient. 

In the middle of this discourse we heard some 

of them awake, and soon after we saw two of them 

on their feet. I asked him, If either of them were 

the men who he had said were the heads of the 

i 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 3$9 

mutiny ? He said, No. Well then, said I, you may- 
let them escape, and Providence seems to have 
wakened them on purpose to save themselves: 
Now, said I, if the rest escape you, it is your fault. 
Animated with this, he took the musket I had 
given him in his hand, and pistol in his belt, and 
his two comrades with him, with each man a piece 
in his hand: the two men, who were with him, 
going first, made some noise, at which one of the 
seamen, who was awake, turned about, and seeing 
them coming, cried out to the rest; but it was too 
late then; for the moment he cried out, they fired, 
I mean the two men, the captain wisely reserving 
his own piece: they had so well aimed their shot 
at the men the}^ knew, that one of them was killed 
on the spot, and the other very much wounded; 
but not being dead, he started up on his feet, and 
called eagerly for help to the other; but the cap- 
tain, stepping to him, told him it was too late to 
cry for help; he should call upon God to forgive 
his villainy; and with that word knocked him 
down with the stock of his musket, so that he 
never spoke more: there were three more in the 
company, and one of them was also slightly 
» wounded; by this time I was come; and when 
they saw their danger, and that it was in vain to 
resist, they begged for mercy. The captain told 
them, he would spare their lives, if they would 
give him any assurance of their abhorrence of the 
treachery they had been guilty of, and would swear 
to be faithful to him in recovering the ship, and 
afterwards in carrying her back to Jamaica, froiu 
whence they came. They gave him all the pro- 

z 2 



540 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

testations of their sincerity that could be desired; 
and he was willing to believe them, and spare their 
■ lives, which I was not against; only I obliged him 
to keep them bound hand and foot while they were 
upon the island. 

While this was doing, I sent Friday with the 
captain's mate to the boat, with orders to secure 
her, and bring away the oars and sail, which they 
did; and by and bye, three straggling men, that 
were (happily for them) parted from the rest, came 
back upon hearing the guns fired; and seeing their 
captain, who before was their prisoner, now their 
conqueror, they submitted to be bound also, and 
so our victory was complete. 

It now remained, that the captain and I should 
inquire into one another's circumstances. I began 
first, and told him my whole history, which he 
heard with an attention even to amazement, and 
particularly at the wonderful manner of my being 
furnished with provisions and ammunition; and 
indeed, as my story is a whole collection of won- 
ders, it affected him deeply; but when he reflected 
from thence upon himself, and how I seemed to 
have been preserved there on purpose to save his 
life, the tears ran down his face, and he could not 
speak a word more. 

After this communication was at an end, I car- 
ried him and his two men into my apartments, 
leading them in just where I came out, viz. at the 
top of the house; where I refreshed them with 
such provisions as I had, and shewed them all the 
contrivances I had made during my long, long in- 
habiting that place. 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 341 

All I shewed them, all I said to them, was per- 
fectly amazing; but, above all, the captain adfni red 
my fortification; and how perfectly I had con- 
cealed my retreat with a grove of the trees, which, 
having now been planted near twenty years, and 
the trees growing much faster than in England, 
was become a little wood, and so thick, that it 
was impassable in any part of it, but at that one 
side where I had reserved my little winding pas- 
sage into it: this I told him was my castle, and 
my residence; but that I had a seat in the coun- 
try, as most princes have, whither I could retreat 
upon occasion, and I would shew him that too an- 
other time; but at present our business was to 
consider how to recover* the ship. He agreed with 
me as to that; but told me, he was perfectly at a 
loss what measure to take; for that there were 
still six-and-twenty hands on board, who having 
entered into a cursed conspiracy, by which they 
had all forfeited their lives to the law, would be 
hardened in it now by desperation; and would 
carry it on, knowing that if they were reduced, 
they should be brought to the gallows as soon as 
they came to England, or to any of the English 
'colonies; and that therefore there would be no 
attacking them with so small a number as we were. 

I mused for some time upon what he had said, 
and found it was a very rational conclusion, and 
that therefore something was to be resolved on 
very speedily, as well to draw the men on board 
into some snare for their surprise, as to prevent 
their landing upon us, and destroying us: upon 
this it presently occurred to me, that in a little 



342 LIFE AND. ADVENTURES 

while, the ship's crew, wondering what was be- 
come*of their comrades, and of the boat, would 
certainly come on shore in their other boat to see 
for them; and that then perhaps they might come 
armed, and be too strong for us: this he allowed, 
was rational. 

Upon this I told him, the first thing we were to 
do, was to save the boat, which lay upon the 
beach, so that they might not carry her off; and 
taking everything out of her, leave her so far use- 
less as not to be fit to swim; accordingly we went 
on board, took the arms which were left on board 
out of her, and whatever else we found there, 
which was a bottle of brandy, and another of rum, 
a few biscuit cakes, an horn of powder, and a great 
great lump of sugar in a piece of canvas; the sugar 
was five or six pounds; all which was very wel- 
come to me, especially the brandy and sugar, of 
which I had had none left for many years. 

When we had carried all these things on shore 
(the oars, mast, sail, and rudder of the boat, were 
carried before, as above), we knocked a great hole 
in her bottom, that if thev had come strong; enough 
to master us, yet they could not carry off the boat. 

Indeed it was not much in my thoughts, that 
we could be capable to recover the ship; but my 
view was, that if they went away without the 
boat, I did not much question to make her fit 
again to cany us away to the Leeward Islands, and 
call upon our friends the Spaniards in my way; for 
I had them still in my thoughts. 
. While we were thus preparing our designs, and 
had first, by main strength, heaved the boat up 



OP ROBINSON CRUSOE. 313 

iipon the beach, so high that the tide would not 
float her off at high-water mark; and, besides, 
had broken an hole in her bottom, too bio- to be 
quickly stopped, and were sat down musing what 
we should do, we heard the ship fire a gun, and 
saw her make a waft with her ancient, as a signal 
for the boat to come on board; but no boat stirred; 
and they fired several times, making other signals 
for the boat. 

At last, when all their signals and firings proved 
fruitless, and they found the boat did not stir, we 
saw them (by the help of our glasses) hoist another 
boat out, and row towards the shore; and we 
found, as they approached, that there were no less 
than ten men in her, and that they had fire-arms 
with them. 

As the ship lay almost two leagues from the 
shore, we had a full view of them as they came, 
and a plain sight of the men, even of their faces; 
because the tide having set them a little to the east 
of the other boat, they rowed up under shore, to 
come to the same place where the other had 
landed, and where the boat lay. 

By this means, I say, we had a full view of 
them, and the captain knew the persons and cha- 
racters of all the men in the boat; of whom he said 
that there were three very honest fellows, who, 
he was sure, were led into this conspiracy by the 
rest, being overpowered and frighted. 

But that for the boatswain, who, it seems, was 
the chief officer among them, and all the rest, they 
were as outrageous as any of the ship's crew; and 
were, no doubt, made desperate in their new en- 



344 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

terprize; and terribly apprehensive he was, that 
they would be too powerful for us. 

I smiled at him, and told him, that men in our 
circumstances were past the operations of fear: 
that seeing almost every condition that could be 
was better than that we were supposed to be in, 
we ought to expect that the consequence, whether- 
death or life, would be sure to be a deliverance. I 
asked him, what he thought of the circumstances 
of my life, and whether a deliverance was not worth 
venturing for? And where, Sir, said I, is your be- 
lief of my being preserved here on purpose to save 
your life, which elevated you a little while ago? 
For my part, said I, there seems to be but one 
thing amiss in all the prospect of it. What is that? 
says he. Why, said I, it is that, as you say, there 
are three or four honest fellows among them, 
which should be spared ; had they been all of the 
wicked part of the crew, I should have thought 
God's providence had singled them out to deli- 
ver them into your hands; for, depend upon it, 
every man of them that comes ashore are our own, 
and shall die or live, as they behave to us, 

As I spoke this with a raised voice, and cheer- 
ful countenance, I found it greatly encouraged 
him; so we set vigorously to our business: we had, 
upon the first appearance of the boat's coming 
from the ship, considered of separating our pri- 
soners, and had indeed secured them effectually. 

Two of them, of whom the captain was less as- 
sured than ordinary, I sent with Friday, and one 
of the three (delivered men) to my cave, where 
they were remote enough, and out of danger 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE, 345 

of being heard or discovered, or of finding their 
way out of the woods, if they could have delivered 
themselves: here they left them bound, but gave 
them provisions, and promised them, if they con- 
tinued there quietly, to give them their liberty in 
a day or two; but that if they attempted their 
escape, they should be put to death without 
mercy. They promised faithfully to bear their con- 
finement with patience, and were very thankful 
that they had such good usage as to have provi- 
sions, and a light left them; for Friday gave them 
candles (^such as we made ourselves) for their com- 
fort; and they did not know but that he stood 
centinel over them at the entrance. 

The other prisoners had better usage; two of 
them were kept pinioned indeed, because the cap- 
tain was not free to trust them; but the other two 
Avere taken into my service upon their captain's 
recommendation, and upon their solemnly engaging 
to live and die with us; so, with them and the 
three honest men, we were seven men well armed; 
and I made no doubt we should be able to deal 
well enough with the ten that were coming, con- 
sidering that the captain had said, there were three 
or four honest men among them also. 

As soon as they got to the place where their 
other boat lay, they ran their boat into the beach, 
and came all on shore, hauling the boat up after 
them, which I was glad to see; for I was afraid 
they would rather have left the boat at an anchor, 
some distance from the shore, with some hands in 
her to guard her; and so we should not be able to 
seize the boat, 



346 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

Being on shore, the first thing they did, they 
ran all to the other boat; and it was easy to see 
they were under a great surprise to find her strip- 
ped, as above, of all that was in her, and a great 
hole in her bottom. 

After they had mused awhile upon this, they 
set up two or three grest shouts, hallooing with 
all their might, to try if they could make their 
companions hear; but all was to no purpose; then 
they came all close in a ring, and fired a volley of 
their small arms, which indeed we heafd, and the 
echoes made the woods ring; but it was all one; 
those in the cave, we were sure, could not hear; 
and those in our keeping, though they heard it 
well enough, yet durst give no answer to them. 

They were so astonished at the surprise of this, 
that as they told us afterwards, they resolved to 
go all on board again to their ship, and let them 
know there, that the men were all murdered, 
and the long-boat staved; accordingly, they imme- 
diately launched the boat again, and got all of 
them on board. 

The captain was terribly amazed, and even con- 
founded at this, believing they would go on board 
the ship again, and set sail, giving their comrades 
up for lost, and so he should still lose the ship, 
which he was in hopes we should have recovered; 
but he was quickly as much frighted the other 
way. 

They had not been long put off with the boat, 
but we perceived them all coming on shore again; 
but with this new .measure in their conduct, 
which, it seems, they consulted together upon, viz, 



N>. 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 347 

to leave three men in the boat, and the rest to go 
on shore, and go up into the country to look for 
their fellows. 

This was a great disappointment to us; for now 
we were at a loss what to do; for our seizing those 
seven men on shore would be no advantage to us 
if we let the boat escape, because they would 
then row away to the ship ; and then the rest of 
them would be sure to weigh, and set sail, and so 
our recovering the ship would be lost. 

However, we had no remedy but to wait and see 
"what the issue of things might present: the seven 
men came on shore, and the three who remained 
in the boat put her off to a good distance from the 
shore, and came to an anchor to wait for them; so 
that it w r as impossible for us to come at them in 
the boat. i 

Those that came on shore kept close together, 
marching towards the top of the little hill, under 
which my habitation lay; and we could see them 
plainly, though they could not perceive us : we 
could have been very glad they would have come 
nearer to us, so that we might have fired at them; 
or that they would have gone farther off, that we 
might have come abroad. 

But when they were come to the brow of the 
hill, where they could see a great way in the 
valley and woods, which lay towards the north- 
east part, and where the island lay lowest, they 
shouted and hallooed till they were weary; and 
not caring, it seems, to venture far from the shore, 
nor far from one another, they sat down together 
under a tree, to consider of it: had they thought 



348 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

fit to have gone to sleep there, as the other party 
of them had done, they had done the job for us; 
but they were too full of apprehensions of danger, 
to venture to go to sleep, though they could not 
tell what the danger was they had to fear neither. 

The captain made a very just proposal to me 
upon this consultation of theirs ; viz. that perhaps 
they would all fire a volley again, to endeavour 
to make their fellows hear, and that we should 
all sally upon them, just at the juncture when their 
pieces were all discharged, and they would cer- 
tainly yield, and we should have them without 
bloodshed. I liked the proposal, provided it was 
done while we were near enough to come up to 
them, before they could load their pieces again. 

But this event did not happen, and we lay still 
a long time, very irresolute what course to take; 
at length I told them, there would be nothing to 
be done in my opinion till night; and then, if they 
did not return to the boat, perhaps we might find 
a way to get between them arid the shore, and so 
might use some stratagem with them in the boat, 
to get them on shore. 

We waited a great while, though very impatient 
for their removing, and were very uneasy : when, 
after long consultations, we saw them start all up, 
and march down toward the sea: it seems, they 
had such dreadful apprehensions upon them of the 
danger of the place, that they resolved to go on 
board the ship again, give their companions over 
for lost, and so go on with their intended voyage 
with the ship. 

As soon as I perceived them go towards the 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 349 

shore, I imagined it to be as it really was; that 
they had given over their search, and were for 
going back again ; and the captain, as soon as I 
told him my thoughts, was ready to sink at the ap- 
prehensions of it; but I presently thought of a 
stratagem to fetch them back again, and which 
answered my end to a tittle. 

I ordered Friday, and the captain's mate, to go 
over the little creek westward, towards the place 
where the savages came on shore when Friday was 
rescued; and as soon as they came to a little rising 
ground, at about half a mile's distance, I bade 
them halloo as loud as they could, and wait till 
they found the seamen heard them ; that as soon 
as ever they heard the seamen answer them, they 
should return it again, and then, keeping out of 
sight, take a round, always answering when the 
others hallooed, to draw them as far into the island, 
and among the woods, as possible, and then wheel 
about again to me, by such ways as I directed. 

They were just going into the boat, when Friday 
and the mate hallooed, and they presently heard 
them, and answering ran along the shore westward 
towards the voice they heard, when they were 
presently stopped by the creek, where, the water 
being up, they could not get over, and called for 
the boat to come up, and set them over, as indeed 
I expected. 

When they had set themselves over, I observed 
that the boat being ^one up a good way into the 
creek, and as it were in an harbour within the 
land, they took one of the three men out of her to 
go along with them, and left only two in the boat, 



350 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

having fastened her to the stump of a little tree 
on the shore. 

This was what I wished for, and immediately 
leaving Friday and the captain's mate to their bu- 
siness, I took the rest with me, -and, crossing the 
creek out of their sight, we surprised the two men 
before they were aware, one of them lying on 
shore, and the other being in the boat; the fellow 
on shore was between sleeping and waking, and 
going to start up, the captain, who was foremost, 
ran in upon him, and knocked him down, and 
then called out to him in the boat to yield, or he 
was a dead man. 

There needed very few arguments to persuade a 
single man to yield, when he saw five men upon 
him, and his comrade knocked down; besides, this 
was, it seems, one of the three that were not so 
hearty in the mutiny as the rest of the crew, and 
therefore was easily persuaded not only to yield, 
but afterwards to join very sincerely with us. 

In the mean time, Friday and the captain's mate 
so well managed their business with the rest, that 
they drew them, by hallooing and answering, from 
one hill to another, and from one wood to another, 
till they not only heartily tired them, but left them 
where they were very sure they could not reach 
back to the boat before it was dark; and indeed 
they were heartily tired themselves also by the time 
they came back to us. 

We had nothing now to do but to watch for 
them in the dark, and to fall upon them, so as to 
make sure work with them. 

It was several hours after Friday came back tq 



OF ROBIXSON CRUSOE. 351 

me before they came back to their boat; and we 
could hear the foremost of them, long before they 
came quite up, calling to those behind to come 
along; and could also hear them answer, and com- 
plain how lame and tired they were, and not being 
able to come any faster, which was very welcome 
news to us. 

At length they came up to the boat; but it is 
impossible to express their confusion, when they 
found the boat fast a-ground in the creek; The 
tide ebbed out, and their two men gone; we could 
hear them call to one another in a most lamenta- 
ble manner, telling one another they were gotten 
into an enchanted island; that either there were 
inhabitants in it, and they should all be murdered; 
or else there were devils or spirits in it, and they 
should be all carried away and devoured. 

They hallooed again, and called their two com- 
rades by their names a great many times, but no 
answer: after some time, we could see them, by 
the little light there was, run about wringing their 
hands, like men in despair; and that sometimes 
they would go and sit down in the boat to rest 
themselves, then come ashore, and walk about 
again, and so the same thing over again. 

My men would fain have had me give them 
leave to fall upon them at once in the dark; but 
I was willing to take them at some advantage, so 
to spare them, and kill as few of them as I could; 
and especially I was unwilling to hazard the killing 
any of our men, knowing the other men were very 
well armed : I resolved to wait to see if ihey did 
uot separate; and therefore, to make sure of them, 



352 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

I drew my ambuscade nearer; and ordered Friday 
and the captain to creep upon their hands and feet 
as close to the ground as they could, that they 
might not be discovered, and get as near them as 
they could possibly, before they offered to fire. 

They had not been long in that posture, till the 
boatswain, who was the principal ringleader of the 
mutiny, and had now shewn himself the most de- 
jected and dispirited of all the rest, came walking 
towards them with two more of the crew; the 
captain was so eager, at having the principal rogue 
so much in his power, that he could hardly have 
patience to let him come so near as to be sure of 
him; for they only heard his tongue before: but 
when they came nearer, the captain and Friday, 
starting up on their feet, let fly at them. 

The boatswain was killed upon the spot; the 
next man was shot in the body, and fell just by 
him, though he did not die till an hour »or two 
after; and the third ran for it. 

At the noise of the fire, I immediately advanced 
with my whole army, which was now eight men; 
viz. myself generalissimo; Friday my lieutenant- 
general i the captain and his two men, and the 
three prisoners of war, whom he had trusted with 
arms. 

We came upon them indeed in the dark, so that 
they could not see our number; and I made the 
man they had left in the boat, who was now one 
of us, to call them by name, to try if I could bring 
them to a parley, and so might perhaps reduce 
them to terms- which fell out just as we desired: 
for indeed it was easy to think, as their condition 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 353 

then was, they would be very willing to capitulate; 
so he calls out, as loud as he could, to one of them, 
Tom Smith, Tom Smith. Tom Smith answered 
immediately, Who's that! Robinson! For it seems 
he knew his voice. The other answered, Ay, ay; 
for God's sake, Tom Smith, throw down your arms, 
and yield, or you are all dead men this moment. 

Who must we yield to? Where are they? says 
Smith again. Here thev are, says he: here is our 
captain and fifty men with him, have been hunting 
you this two hours; the boatswain is killed; Will 
Frye is wounded, and I am a prisoner; and if you 
do not yield, you are all lost. 

Will they give us quarter then? says Tom Smith, 
and we will yield. I'll go and ask, if you promise 
to yield, says Robinson. So he asked the captain, 
and the captain himself then calls out; You, Smith, 
you know my voice, if you lay down ,your arms 
immediately, and submit, you shall have your 
lives, all but Will Atkins. 

Upon this Will Atkins cried out, For God's 
sake, captain, give me quarter: what have I done? 
they have been all as bad as I: (which by the way 
was not true, either; for it seems this Will Atkins 
was the first man that laid hold of the captain 
when they first mutinied, and used him barbarously, 
hi tying his hands, and giving him injurious Ian- 
guage:) however, the captain told him he must 
lay down his arms at discretion, and trust to the 
governor's mercy, by which he meant me; for they 
all called me governor. 

In a wwd, thev ail laid down their arms* and 

VOL. I. 9 A 



$54* LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

begged their lives; and I sent the man that had 
parlied with them, and two more, who bound them 
all; and then my great army of fifty men, which, 
particularly with those three, were all but eight, 
came up and seized upon them all, and upon their 
boat, only that i kept myself and one more out of 
sight, for reasons of state. 

Our next work was to repair the boat, and to 
think of seizing the ship; and as for the captain, 
now he had leisure to parley with them, he expos- 
tulated with them upon the villany of their prac- 
tices with him, and at length, upon the further 
wickedness of their design; and how certainly it 
must bring them to misery and distress in the end, 
and perhaps to the gallows. 

They all appeared very penitent, and begged 
hard for their lives. As for that, he told them they 
were none of his prisoners, but the commander's 
of the island; that they thought they had set him 
on shore in a barren uninhabited island; but it 
had pleased God so to direct them, that the island 
was inhabited, and that the governor was an En- 
glishman; that he might hang them all there, if 
he pleased ; but as he had given them all quarter, 
he supposed he would send them to England, to 
be dealt with there as justice required, except At- 
kins, whom he was commanded by the governor 
to advise to prepare for death; for that he would 
be hanged in the morning. 

Though this was all a fiction of his own, yet it 
had its desired effect: Atkins fell upon his knees 
to beg the captain to intercede with the governor 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 355 

for his life; and all the rest begged of him for 
God's sake, that they might not be sent to 
England. 

It now occurred to me, that the time of our de- 
liverance was come, and that it would be a most 
easy thing to bring these fellows in to be hearty 
in getting possession of the ship; so I retired in 
the dark from them, that they might not see what 
kind of a governor they had, and called the cap- 
tain to me; when I called, as at a good distance, 
one of the men was ordered to speak again, and 
say to the captain, Captain, the commander calls 
for you; and presently the captain replied, Tell 
his excellency I am just a coming. This more 
perfectly amused them; and they all believed, that 
the commander was just by with his fifty men. 

Upon the captain's coming to me, I told him 
my project for seizing the ship, which he liked 
wonderfully well, and resolved to put it in execu- 
tion the next morning. 

But, in order to execute it with more art, and 
to be secure of success, I told him we must divide 
the prisoners, and that he should go and take At- 
kins, and two more of the worst of them, and send 
them pinioned to the cave where the others lay: 
this was committed to Friday, and the two men 
who came on shore with the captain. 

They conveyed them to the cave, as to a prison ; 
and it was indeed a dismal place> especially to men 
in their condition. 

< The others I ordered to my bower, as I called 
it, of which I have given a full description; and 
as it was fenced in, and they pinioned, the place 

2 A 2 



356 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

was secure enough, considering they were upon 
their behaviour. 

To these in the morning I sent the captain, who 
was to enter into a parley with them; in a word, 
to try them, and tell me, whether he thought they 
might be trusted or no, to go on board, and sur- 
prise the ship: he talked to them of the injun r 
done him, of the condition they were brought to; 
and that though the governor had given them 
quarter for their lives as to the present action, yet 
that if they were sent to England, they would all 
be hanged in chains, to be sure; but that if they 
would join in such an attempt, as to recover the 
ship, he would have the governor's engagement 
for their pardon. 

Any one may guess how readily such a proposal 
would be accepted by men in their condition; they 
fell down on their knees to the captain, and pro- 
mised with the deepest imprecations, that they 
would be faithful to him to the last drop, and that 
they should owe their lives to him, and would go 
with him all over the world; that thev would own 
him for a father to them as long as they lived. 

Well, says the captain, I must go and tell. the 
governor what vou sav, and see what I can do to 
bring him to consent to it:, so he brought me an 
account of the temper he found them in, and tha£ 
he verily believed they would be faithful. 

However, that we might be very secure, I told 
him he should go back again, ami choose out five 
of them, and tell them, that they should see that 
they did not want men; but he would take out 
those five to be his assistants, and that the gover- 



OY ROBINSON CRUSOE. 357 

nor would keep the other two, and the three that 
were sent prisoners to the castle, (my cave) as hos- 
tages, for the fidelity of those five ; and that if 
they proved unfaithful in the execution, the 
five hostages should be hanged in chains alive 
upon the shore. 

This looked severe, and convinced them that the 
governor was in earnest; however, they had no 
way left them but to accept it; and it was now 
the business of the prisoners, as much as of the 
captain, to persuade the other five to do their 
duty. 

Our strength was now thus ordered for the ex- 
pedition. 1. The captain, his mate, and passenger. 
<2. Then the two prisoners of the first gang, to 
whom, having their characters from the captain, I 
had given their liberty, and trusted them with 
arms. 3. The other two whom I kept till now in 
my bower pinioned; but, upon the captain's mo- 
tion, had now released. 4. These five released at 
last; so that they were twelve in all, besides five 
we kept prisoners in the cave for hostages. 

I asked the captain if he was willing to venture 
with these'hands on board the ship: for, as for me 
and my man Friday, I did not think it was proper 
for us to stir, having seven men left behind; and 
it was employment enough for us to keep them 
asunder, and supply them with victuals. 

As to the five in the cave, I resolved to keep 
them fast; but Friday went twice a day to them, 
to supply them with necessaries; and I made the 
other two carry provisions to a certain distance^ 
where Friday was to take it. 



358 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

When I shewed myself to the two hostages, it 
was with the captain, who told them, I was the 
person the governor had ordered to look after 
them, and that it was the governor's pleasure that 
they should not stir any where but by my direc- 
tion; that if they did, they should be fetched into 
the castle, and be laid in irons; so that as we never 
suffered them to see me as governor, so I now 
appeared as another person, and spoke of the go- 
vernor, the garrison, the castle, and the like, upon 
all occasions. 

The captain now had no difficulty before him, 
but to furnish his two boats, stop the breach of 
one, and man them: he made his passenger cap- 
tain of one, with four other men; and himself, and 
his mate, and five more, went in the other; and 
they contrived their business very well; for they 
came up to the ship about midnight. As soon as 
they came within call of the ship, he made Robin- 
son hail them, and tell them he had brought off 
the men and the boat, but that it was a long time 
before they had found them, and the like; holding 
them in a chat, till they came to the ship's side; 
when the captain and the mate, entering first with 
their arms, immediately knocked down the second 
mate and carpenter with the but end of their mus- 
quets, being very faithfully seconded by their men ; 
they secured all the rest that were upon the main 
and quarter-decks, and began to fasten the hatches 
to keep them down who were below, when the 
other boat, and their men, entering at the fore- 
chains, secured the forecastle of the ship, and the 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. $5$ 

skuttle which went down into the cook-room, 
making* three men they found there prisoners. 

When this was done, and all safe upon the deck, 
the captain ordered the mate with three men to 
break into the round house, where the new rebel 
captain lay, and, having taken the alarm, was got- 
ten up, and with two men and a boy had gotten 
fire-arms in their hands; and when the mate with 
a crow split open the door, the new captain and 
his men fired boldly anion p* them, and wounded 
the mate with a musquet ball, which broke his 
arm, and wounded two more of the men, but 
killed nobody. 

The mate, calling for help, rushed, however, 
into the round-house, wounded as he was, and 
with his pistol shot the new captain through the 
head, the bullets entering at his mouth, and came 
out again behind one of his ears; so that he never 
spoke a word ; upon which the rest yielded, and 
the ship was taken effectually, without any more 
lives being lost. 

As soon as the ship was thus secured, the captain 
ordered seven guns to be fired, which was the sig- 
nal agreed upon with me, to. give me notice of his 
success; which you may be sure I was very glad 
to hear, having sat watching upon the shore for 
it till near two of the clock in the morning. 

Having thus heard the signal plainly, I laid me 
down; and it having been a day of great fatigue 
to me, I slept very sound, till I was something sur- 
prised with the noise of a gun; and presently 
starting up, I heard a man call me by the name 



360 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

of Governor, governor; and presently I knew 
the captain's voice, when climbing up to the top 
of the hill, there he stood, and pointing to the ship, 
he embraced me in his arms. My dear friend 
and deliverer, says he, there is your ship, for she 
is all your's, and so are we, and all that belong to 
her. I cast my eyes to the ship, and there she 
rode within a little more than half a mile of the 
shore; for they had weighed her anchor as soon 
as they were masters of her; and the weather be- 
ing fair, had brought her to an anchor just against 
the mouth of a little creek; and the tide being up, 
the captain had brought the pinnace in near the 
place where I first landed my rafts, and so landed 
just at my door. 

I was, at first, ready to sink down with the sur- 
prise: for I saw my deliverance indeed visibly put 
into my hands, all things easy, and a large ship 
just ready to carry me away whither I pleased to 
go. At first, for some time, I was not able to answer 
one word; but as he had taken me in his arms, 
I held fast by him, or I should have fallen to the 
ground. 

He perceived the surprise, and immediately 
pulled a bottle out of his pocket, and gave me a 
dram of cordial, which he had brought on purpose 
for me. After I drank it, I sat down upon the 
ground, and though it brought me to myself, yet 
it was a good while before I could speak a word 
to him. 

All this while the poor man was in as great an 
ecstasy as I, only not under any surprise, as I 
was; and he said a thousand kind tender things 



OV ROBINSON CRUSOE. 36l 

to me, to compose and bring me to myself; but 
such was the flood of joy in my breast, that it put 
all my spirits into confusion; at last it broke into 
tears, and in a little while after I recovered my 
speech. 

Then I took my turn and embraced him as my 
deliverer, and we rejoiced together. I told him, 
I looked upon him as a man sent from Heaven to 
deliver me, and that the whole transaction seemed 
to be a chain of wonders; that such things as 
these were the testimonies we had of a secret hand 
cf Providence governing the world, and an evi- 
dence, that the eyes of an infinite power could 
search into the remotest corner of the world, and 
send help to the miserable whenever he pleased. 

I forgot not to lift up my heart in thankfulness 
to Heaven; and what heart could forbear to bless 
Him, who had not only in a miraculous manner 
provided for one in such a wilderness, and in such 
a desolate condition, but from whom every deli- 
verance must always be acknowledged to pro- 
ceed ! 

When we had talked a while, the captain told 
me, he had brought me some little refreshments, 
such as the ship afforded, and such as the wretches, 
who had been so long his masters, had not plun- 
dered him of: upon this he called aloud to the boat, 
and bids his men bring the things ashore that were 
for the governor; and indeed it was a present, as 
if I had been one, not that I was to be carried 
along with them, but as if I had been to dwell 
upon the island still, and they were to go without 
me. 



36$ LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

First, he had brought me a case of bottles fait 
of excellent cordial waters, six large bottles of 
Madeira wine; the bottles held two quarts a piece; 
two pounds of excellent good tobacco, twelve 
good pieces of the ship's beef, and six pieces of 
pork, with a bag of peas, ^and about an hundred 
weight of biscuit. 

He brought me also a box of sugar, a box of 
flour, a bag full of lemons, and two bottles of 
lime-juice, and abundance of other things: but be- 
sides these, and what was a thousand times more 
useful to me, he brought me six clean new shirts, 
six very good neckcloths, two pair of gloves, one 
pair of shoes, an hat, and one pair of stockings, 
and a very good suit of clothes of his own, which 
had been worn but verv little: in a word, he 
clothed me from head to foot. 

It was a very kind and agreeable present, as any 
one may imagine, to one in my circumstances; 
but never was any thing in the world of that kind 
so unpleasant, awkward, and uneasy, as it was to 
me to wear such clothes at their first putting on. 

After these ceremonies passed, and after all his 
good things were brought into my little apart- 
ment, we began to consult what was to be done 
with the prisoners we had; for it was worth con- 
sidering whether we might venture to take them 
away with us or no, especially two of them, whom 
we knew to be incorrigible and refractory to the 
last degree; and the captain said, he knew they 
were such rogues, that there was no obliging 
them; and if he did carry them away it must be 
in irons, as malefactors, to be delivered over to 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 363 

justice at the first English colony he could come 
at; and I found that the captain himself was very 
anxious about it. 

Upon this, I told him, that if he desired it, I 
durst undertake to bring the two men he spoke of, 
to make it their own request that he should leave 
them upon the island. I should be very glad of 
that, says the captain, with all my heart. 

Wei), said I, I will send for them, and talk with 
them for you: so I caused Friday and the two 
hostages, for they were now discharged, their 
comrades having performed their promise; I say, 
I caused them to go to the cave, and bring up the 
five men, pinioned as they were, to the bower, and 
keep them there till I came. 

After some time, I came thither dressed in my 
new habit, and now I was called governor again. 
Being all met, and the captain with me, I caused 
the men to be brought before me, and I told them, 
I had had a full account of their villainous beha- 
viour to the captain, and how they had run away 
with the ship, and were preparing to commit fur- 
ther robberies ; but that Providence had ensnared 
them in their own ways, and that they were fallen 
into the pit which they had digged for others. 

I let them know, that by my direction the ship 
had been seized, that she lay now in the road, and 
they might see by and by, that their new captain 
had received the reward of his villany; for that 
they might see him hanging at the yard-arm. 

That as to them, I wanted to know what they 
had to say, why I should not execute them as pi- 



364i LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

rates taken in the fact, as by my commission they 
could not doubt I had authority to do. 

One of them answered in the name of the rest, 
that they had nothing to say but this, That when 
they were taken, the captain promised them their 
lives, and they humbly implored my mercy: but I 
told them I knew not what mercy to shew them; 
for, as for myself, I had resolved to quit the island 
with all my men, and had taken passage with the 
captain to go for England: and as for the captain, 
he could not carry them to England, other than 
as prisoners in irons to be tried for mutiny, and 
running away with the ship; the consequence of 
which, they must needs know, would be the gal- 
lows; so that I could not tell which was best for 
them, unless they had a mind to take their fate in 
the island: if they desired that, I did not care, as 
I had liberty to leave it; I had some inclination 
to give them their lives, if they thought they 
could shift on shore. They seemed very thank- 
ful for it; said they would much rather venture 
to stay there, than to be carried to England to be 
hanged; so I left it on that issue. 

However, the captain seemed to make some 
difficulty of it, as if he durst not leave them there: 
upon this I seemed to be a little angry with the 
captain,, and told him, that they were my prisoners, 
not his; and that seeing I had offered them so 
much favour, I would be as good as my word; 
and that if he did not think fit to consent to it, I 
would set them at liberty as I found them; and if 
he did not like that, he might take them again, if 
he could catch them. 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 365 

' Upon this they appeared very thankful, and I 
accordingly set them at liberty, and bade them 
retire into the woods, to the place whence they 
came, and I would leave them some fire-arms, 
some ammunition, and some directions how they 
should live very well, if they thought fit. 

Upon this, I prepared to go on board the ship; 
but told the captain, that I would stay that night 
to prepare my things; and desired him to go on 
board in the mean time, and keep all right in the 
ship, and send the boat on shore the next day for 
me; ordering him, in the mean time, to cause the 
new captain who was killed, to be hanged at the 
yard-arm, that these men might see him. 

When the captain was gone, I sent for the men 
up to me to my apartment, and entered seriously 
into discourse with them of their circumstances. 
1 told them, I thought they had made a right 
choice; that if the captain carried them away, 
they would certainly be hanged. I shewed them 
their captain banging at the yard-arm of the ship, 
and told them they had nothing less to expect. 

When they had all declared their willingness to 
stay, I then told them, I would let them into the 
story of my living there, and put them into the 
way of making it easy to them : accordingly I gave 
them the whole history of the place, and of rny 
coming to it; shewed them my foi tiiications, the 
way I made my bread, planted my corn, cured my 
grapes; and, in a word, all that was necessary to 
make them easy. I told them the story of the 
sixteen Spaniards that were to be expected; for 



366 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

whom I left a letter, and made them promise to 
treat them in common with themselves. 

I left them my fire-arms; viz. five musquets, 
three fowling-pieces, and three swords. I had 
about a barrel of powder left; for after the first 
year or two I used but little, and wasted none. I 
gave them a description of the way I managed the 
goats, and directions to milk and fatten them, to 
make both butter and cheese. 

In a word, I gave them every part of my own 
story; and I told them, I would prevail with the 
captain to leave them two barrels of gunpowder 
more, and some garden-seed, which I told them I 
would have been very glad of; also I gave them 
the bag of peas which the captain had brought me 
to eat, and bade them be sure to sow and increase 
them. 

Having done all this, I left them the next day, 
and went on board the ship: we prepared imme- 
diately to sail, but did not weigh that night. The 
next morning early, two of the five men came 
swimming to the ship's side, and making a most 
lamentable complaint of the other three, begged 
to be taken into the ship, for God's sake, for they 
should be murdered; and begged the captain to 
take them on board, though he hanged them imme- 
diate! v. 

Upon this the captain pretended to have no 
power without me; but after some difficulty, and 
after their solemn promises of amendment, they 
were taken on board, and were some time after 
soundly whipped and pickled; after which they 
proved very honest and quiet fellows. 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 36/ 

Some time after this, I went with the boat on 
shore, the tide being up, with the things promised 
to the men, to which the captain, at my interces- 
sion, caused their chests and clothes to be added, 
which they took, and were very thankful for. I 
also encouraged them, by telling them, that if it 
lay in my way to send a vessel to take them in, I 
would not forget them. 

When 1 took leave of this island, I carried on 
board for reliques the great goat's skin cap I had 
made, my umbrella, and one of my parrots; also I 
forgot not to take the money I formerly mention- 
ed, which had lain by me so long useless that it 
was grown rusty, or tarnished, and could hardly 
pass for silver, till it had been a little rubbed and 
handled; and also the money I found in the wreck 
of the Spanish ship. 

And thus I left the island the nineteenth of De- 
cember, as I found by the ship's account, in the 
year i.6'86, after I had been upon it eight and 
twenty years, two months, and nineteen days; 
being delivered from the second captivity the same 
day of the month that I first made my escape in 
the Barco-longo, from among the Moors of Sallee. 

In this vessel, after a long voyage, I arrived in 
England the eleventh of June, in the year 1687, 
having been thirty and five years absent. 

When I came to England, I was a perfect 
stranger to all the world, as if I had never been 
known there: my benefactor, and faithful steward, 
whom I had left in trust with my money, was 
alive but had had great misfortunes in the world, 
was become a widow the second time, and very low 
in the world. I made her easy as to what she 



36S LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

she owed me,' assuring her, I would give her no 
trouble; but on the contrary, in gratitude to her for- 
mer care and faithful nes to me, I relieved her as 
my little stock would afford, which at that time 
would indeed allow me to do but little for her: 
but I assured her, I would never forget her for- 
mer kindness to me; nor did I forget her, when 
I had sufficient to help her; as shall be observed 
in its place. 

I went down afterwards into Yorkshire; but 
my father was dead, and my mother, and all the 
family extinct; except that I found two sisters, 
and two of the children of one of my brothers: 
and as I had been long ago given over for dead, 
there had been no provision made for me, so that, 
in a word, I found nothing to relieve or assist me; 
and that little money I had, would not do so much 
for me as to settling in the world. 

I met with one piece of gratitude, indeed, which 
I did not expect; and this was, that the master of 
the ship, whom I had so happily delivered, and by 
the same means saved the ship and cargo, having 
given a very handsome account to the owners, of 
the manner how I had saved the lives of the men, 
and the ship, they invited me to meet them, and 
some other merchants concerned, and all together 
made me a very handsome compliment upon that 
subject, and a present of almost two hundred 
pounds sterling. 

But after making several reflections upon the 
circumstances of my life, and how little way this 
would go towards settling me in the world, I re- 
solved to go to Lisbon, and see if I might not 
come by some information of the state of my plan- 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 069 

tation in the Brasils, and what was become of my 
partner, who, I had reason to suppose, had some 
years now given me over for dead. 

With this view I took shipping for Lisbon, 
where I arrived in April following; my man Fri- 
day accompanying me very honestly in all these 
ramblings, and proving a most faithful servant 
upon all occasions. 

When I came to Lisbon, I found out, by in- 
quiry, and to my particular satisfaction, my old 
friend, the captain of the ship, who first took me 
up at sea, off the shore of Africa: he was now 
grown old, and had left off the sea, having put his 
son, who was far from a young man, into his ship; 
and who still used the Brasil trade. The old man 
did not know me, and, indeed, I hardly knew him; 
but I soon brought myself to his remembrance, 
when I told him who I was. 

After some passionate expressions of our old ac- 
quaintance, I inquired, you may be sure, after my 
plantation, and my partner. The old man told me, 
he had not been in the Brasils for about nine 
years; but that he could assure me, that when he 
came away, my partner was living; but the trus- 
tees, whom I had joined with him, to take cogni- 
zance of my part, were both dead; that, however, 
he believed that I would have a very good account 
of the improvement of the plantation; for that, 
upon the general belief of my being cast away and 
drowned, my trustees had given in the account of 
the produce of my part of the plantation, to the 
procurator Fiscal; who had appropriated it, in case 
I never came to claim it, one third to the King, 

VOL. I. 2 n 



$70 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

and two-thirds to the monastery of St. Augustine, 
to be expended for the benefit of the poor, and for 
the conversion of the Indians to the Catholic faith; 
but that if I appeared, or any one for me, to claim 
the inheritance, it would be restored; only that 
the improvement, or annual production, being dis- 
tributed to charitable uses, could not be restored; 
but he assured me, that the steward of the king's 
revenue (from lands) and the provedore, or steward 
of the monastery, had taken great care all along, 
that the incumbent, that is to say, my partner, 
gave every year a faithful account of the produce, 
of which they received duly my moiety. 

I asked him, if he knew to what height of im- 
provement he had brought the plantation: and 
whether he thought it might be worth looking 
after; or whether, on my going thither, I should 
meet with no obstruction to my possessing my just 
right in the moiety. 

He told me, he could not tell exactly to what 
degree the plantation was improved; hut this he 
knew, that my partner was growing exceeding 
rich upon the enjoying but one half of it! and 
that, to the best of his remembrance, he had heard, 
that the king's third of my part, which was, it 
seems, granted away to some other monastery, or 
religious house, amounted to above two hundred 
moidores a year; that, as to my being restored to 
a quiet possession of it, there was no question to 
be made of that, my partner being alive to witness 
my title, and my name being also inrolled in the 
register of the country. Also he told me, that 
the survivors of my two trustees were very fair, 



OP ROBINSON CRUSOE. 371 

honest people, and very wealthy, and he believed 
I would not only have their assistance for putting 
me in possession, but would find a very conside- 
rable sum of money in their hands for my account, 
being the produce of the farm, while their fathers 
held the trust, and before it was given up, as above, 
which, as he remembered, was about twelve years. 

I shewed myself a little concerned and uneasy 
at this account, and inquired of the old captain, 
how it came to pass, that the trustees should thus 
dispose of my effects, when he knew that I had 
made my will, and had made him, the Portuguese 
captain, my universal heir, &c. 

He told me, that was true; but that, as there 
was no proof of my being dead, he could not act 
as executor, until some certain account should come 
of my death; and that, besides, he was not willing 
to intermeddle with a thing so remote; that it 
was true, he had registered my will, and put in 
his claim ; and could he have given any account 
of my being dead or alive, he would have acted 
by procuration, and taken possession of the Inge- 
nio (so they called the sugar-house) and had given 
his son, who w T as now at the Brasils, order to do it. 

But, (says the old man) I have one piece of 
news to tell you, which perhaps may not be so 
acceptable to you as the rest; and that is, that 
believing you were lost, and all the world believ- 
ing so also, your partner and trustees did offer to 
account to me in your name, for six or eight of 
the first years of profit, which I received; but 
there being at that time, says he, great disburse- 
ments for increasing the works, building an inge- 

2B2 



372 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

nio, and buying slaves, it did not amount to near 
so much as afterwards it produced: however, says 
the old man, I shall give you a true account of 
what I have received in all, and how I have dis- 
posed of it. 

After a few days further conference with this 
ancient friend, he brought me an account of the 
six first years income of my plantation, signed by 
my partner, and the merchant's trustees, being 
always delivered in goods; viz. tobacco in roll, 
and sugar in chests, besides rum, molasses, &c. 
which is the consequence of a sugar-work; and I 
found by this account, that every year the income 
considerably increased : but, as above, the disburse- 
ment being large, the sum at first was small: how* 
ever, the old man let me see, that he was debtor 
to me 470 moidores of gold, besides 60 chests of 
sugar, and 15 double rolls of tobacco, which were 
lost in his ship, he having been shipwrecked com- 
ing home to Lisbon, about eleven years after my 
leaving the place. 

The good man then began to complain of his 
misfortunes, and how he had been obliged to make 
use of my money to recover his losses, and buy 
him a share in a new ship; However, my old friend, 
says he, You shall not want a supply in your ne- 
cessity; and as soon as my son returns, you shall 
be fully satisfied. 

Upon this he pulls out an old pouch, and gives 
me two hundred Portugal moidores in gold; and 
giving me the writings of his title to the ship 
which his son was gone to the Brasils in, of which 
he was a quarter part owner, and his son another, 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 373 

he put them both in my hands for security of the 
rest. 

I was too much moved with the honesty and 
kindness of the poor man, to be able to bear this; 
and remembering what he had done for me, how 
he had taken me up at sea, and how generously 
he had used me on all occasions, and particularly 
how sincere a friend he was now to me, I could 
hardly refrain weeping at what he said to me. 
Therefore, first I asked him if his circumstances 
admitted him to spare so much money at that 
time, and if it would not straiten him? He told 
me he could not say but it might straiten him a 
little; but, however, it was my money, and I might 
want it more than he. 

Every thing the good man said was full of af- 
fection, and I could hardly refrain from tears while 
he spoke. In short, I took one hundred of the 
moidores, and called for a pen and ink to give him 
a receipt for them; then I returned him the rest, 
and told him, if ever I had possession of the plan- 
tation, I would return the other to him also, as 
indeed I afterwards did: and that, as to the bill 
of sale of his part in his son's ship, I would not 
take it by any means; but that if I wanted the 
money, I found he was honest enough to pay me; 
and if. I did not, but came to receive what he gave 
me reason to expect, I would never have a penny 
more from him. 

When this was passed, the old man began to ask 
me if he should put me in a method to make my 
claim to my plantation. I told him, I thought to 
go over to it myself. He said, I might do so if I 



37* LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

pleased; but that if I did not, there were ways 
enough to secure my right, and immediately to 
appropriate the profits to my use; and as there 
were ships in the river of Lisbon, just ready to go 
away to Brasil, he made me enter my name in a 
public register, with his affidavit, affirming upon 
oath that I was alive, and that I was the same per- 
son who took up the land for the planting the said 
plantation at first. 

This being regularly attested by a notary, and a 
procuration affixed, he directed me to send it with 
a letter of his writing, to a merchant of his ac- 
quaintance at the place; and then proposed my 
staying with him till an account came of the 
return. 

Never any thing was more honourable than the 
proceedings upon this procuration; for in less than 
seven months I received a large packet from the 
survivors of my trustees, the merchants, on whose 
account I went to sea, in which were the following 
particular letters and papers enclosed. 

First, There was the account current of the pro* 
duce of my farm, or plantation, from the year when 
their fathers had balanced with my old Portugal 
captain, being for six years; the balance appeared 
to be 1174 moidores in my favour. 

Secondly, There was the account of four years 
more while they kept the effects in their hands, 
before the government claimed the administration, 
as being the effects of a person not to be found, 
which they call Civil Death; and the balance of 
this, the value of the plantation increasing, amounted 
to cruisadoes, which made 3241 moidores. 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 3/5 

Thirdly, There was the prior of the Augustines 
account, who had received the profits for above 
fourteen years; but not being able to account for 
what was disposed to the hospital, very honestly 
declared he had 872moidores not distributed, which 
he acknowledged to my account. As to the king's 
part, that refunded nothing. 

There was also a letter of my partner's, congra- 
tulating me very aifectionately upon my being 
alive; giving me an account how the estate was 
improved, and what it produced a year, with a par- 
ticular of the number of squares, or acres, that it 
contained; how planted, how many slaves there 
were upon it; and, making two and twenty crosses 
for blessings, told me he had said so many Ave 
Marias to thank the blessed Virgin that I was alive, 
inviting me very passionately to come over and 
take possession of my own, and in the mean time 
to give him orders to whom he should deliver my 
effects, if I did not come myself; concluding with 
an hearty tender of his friendship, and that of his 
family; and sent me, as a present, seven fine leo- 
pards skins, which he had, it seems, received from 
Africa by some other ship which he had sent thi- 
ther, and who, it seems, had made a better voyage 
than I. He sent me also five chests of excellent 
sweetmeats, and an hundred pieces of gold un- 
coined, not quite so large as moidores. 

By the same fleet my merchant-trustees shipped 
me 1200 chests of sugar, 800 rolls of tobacco, and 
the rest of the whole account in gold. 

I might well say now, indeed, that the latter 
end of Job was better than the beginning. It is 



576* LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

impossible to express the flutterings of my very 
heart, when I looked over these letters, and espe- 
cially when I found all my wealth about me; for 
as the Brasil ships came all in fleets, the same ships 
which brought my letters brought my goods; and 
the effects were safe in the Tagus before the letter 
came to my hand. In a word, I turned pale, and 
grew sick; and had not the old mad ran and 
fetched me a cordial, I believe the sudden surprise 
of joy had overset nature, and I had died upon the 
spot. 

Nay, after that, I continued very ill, and was 
so some hours, till a physician being sent for, and 
something of the real cause of my illness being 
known, he ordered me to be let blood, after which 
I had relief, and grew well; but I verily believe, 
if it had not been eased by the vent given in that 
manner to the spirits, I should have died. 

I was now master all on a sudden, of above 
«£50,000 sterling in money, and had an estate, as I 
might well call it, in the Brasils, of above a thou- 
sand pounds a year, as sure as an estate of lands 
in England; and in a word, I was in a condition 
which I scarce knew how to understand, or how 
to compose myself for the enjoyment of. 

The first thing I did was to recompense my ori- 
ginal benefactor, my good old captain, who had 
been first charitable to me in my distress, kind to 
me in the beginning, and honest to me at the end. 
I shewed him all that was sent me; I told him that, 
next to the providence of Heaven, which disposes 
all things, it was owing to him; and that it now 
lay on me to reward him, which I would do an 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 377 

hundred fold. So I first returned to him the hun- 
dred moidores I had received of him; then I sent 
for a notary, and caused him to draw up a general 
release or discharge for the 470 moidores, which he 
had acknowledged he owed me, in the fullest and 
firmest manner possible; after which I caused a 
procuration to be drawn, empowering him to be 
my receiver of the annual profits of my plantation, 
and appointing my partner to account to him, and 
make the returns by the usual fleets to him in my 
name; and a clause in the end, being a grant of 
100 moidores a year to him during his life, out of 
the effects; and fifty moidores a year to his son 
after him, for his life. And thus I requited my 
old man. 

I was now to consider which way to steer my 
course next, and what to do with the estate that 
Providence had thus put into my hands; and, in- 
deed, I had more care upon my head now than I 
had in my silent state of life in the island, where I 
wanted nothing but what I had, and had nothing 
but what I wanted; whereas I had now a great 
charge upon me, and my business was how to se- 
cure it. I. had never a cave to hide my money in, 
or a place where it might lie without lock or key, 
till it grew mouldy and tarnished before any body 
would meddle with it. On the contrary, I knew 
not where to put it, or whom to trust with it; my 
old patron, the captain, indeed, was honest, and 
that was the only refuge I had. 

In the next place, my interest in the Brasils 
seemed to summon me thither; but now I could not 
tell how to think of going thither till I had set- 



378 LIFE AND ADVEtfTUJRES 

tied my affairs, and left my effects in some safe 
hands behind me. At first I thought of my old 
friend the widow, who, I knew, was honest, and 
would be just to me; but then she was in years, 
and but poor, and, for aught I knew, might be in 
debt; so that, in a word, I had no way but to go 
back to England myself, and take my effects with 
me. 

I was some months, however, before I resolved 
upon this; and therefore as I had rewarded the old 
captain fully, and to satisfaction, who had been 
my former benefactor, so I began to think of my 
poor widow, whose husband had been my first be- 
nefactor, and she, while it was in her power, my 
faithful steward and instructor. So the first thing* 
I did, I got a merchant in Lisbon to write to his 
correspondent in London, not only to pay a bill, 
but to go find her out, and carry her in money an 
hundred pounds from me, and to talk with her, 
and comfort her in her poverty, by telling her she 
should, if I lived, have a further supply. At the 
same time I sent my two sisters in the country, 
each of them an hundred pounds, they being, 
though not in want, yet not in very good circum- 
stances; one having been married, and left a wi- 
dow; and the other having an husband not so 
kind to her as he should be. 

But among all my relations or acquaintances, I 
could not yet pitch upon one to whom I durst com- 
mit the gross of my stock, that I might go away to 
the Brasils, and leave things safe behind me; and 
this greatly perplexed me. 

I had once a mind to have gone to the Brasils, 



OF ROBlNSOtf CRUSOE. 379 

and have settled myself there, for I was, as it were, 
iia£tiralized to the place; but I had some little 
scruple in my mind about religion, which insensi- 
bly drew me back, of which I shall say more pre- 
sently. However, it was not religion that kept 
me from going thither for the present; and as I 
had made no scruple of being openly of the religion 
of the country, all the while I was among them, 
so neither did I yet; only that now and then hav- 
ing of late thought more of it than formerly, when 
I began to think of living and dying among them, I 
began to regret my having professed myself a Pa- 
pist, and thought it might not be the best religion 
to die in. 

But, as I have said, this was not the main thing 
that kept me from going to the Brasils, but that 
really I did not know with whom to leave my ef- 
fects behind me; so I resolved at last to go to En- 
gland with them, where, if I arrived, I concluded 
I should make some acquaintance, or find some re- 
lations, that would be faithful to me; and accord- 
ingly I prepared to go for England with all my 
wealth. 

In order to prepare things for my going home, 
I first, (the Brasil fleet being just going away) re- 
solved to give answers suitable to the just and 
faithful account of things I had from thence; and 
first to the prior of St. Augustine, I wrote a letter 
full of thanks for his just dealings, and the offer 
of the 872 moidores, which was undisposed of, 
which I desired might be given; 500 to the mo- 
nastery; and 372 to the poor, as the prior should 



380 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

direct, desiring the good Padre's prayers for me, 
and the like. 

I wrote next a letter of thanks to my two trus- 
tees, with all the acknowledgment that so much 
justice and honesty called for; as for sending them 
any present, they were far above having any occa- 
sion of it. 

Lastly I wrote to my partner, acknowledging 
his industry in the improving the plantation, and 
his integrity in increasing the stock of the works, 
giving him instructions for his future government 
of my part according to the powers I had left with 
my old patron, to whom I desired him to send 
whatever became due to me, till he should hear 
from me more particularly: assuring him that it 
was my intention, not only to come to him, but to 
settle myself there for the remainder of my life. 
To this I added a very handsome present of some 
Italian silks for his wife and two daughters, for 
such the captain's son informed me he had; with 
two pieces of fine English broad-cloth, the best I 
could get in Lisbon, five pieces of black baize, and 
some Flanders lace of a good value. 

Having thus settled my affairs, sold my cargo, 
and turned all my effects into good bills of ex- 
change, my next difficulty was, which way to go 
to England. I had been accustomed enough to 
the sea, and yet I had a strange aversion to go 
to England by sea at that time; and though I 
could give no reason for it, yet the difficulty in- 
creased upon me so much, that though I had once 
shipped my baggage in order to go, yet I altered 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 381 

my mind, and that not once, but two or three 
times. 

It is true, I had been very unfortunate by sea, 
and this might be one of the reasons. But let no 
man slight the strong impulsesof his own thoughts 
in cases of such moment. Two of the ships which 
I had singled out to go in, I mean more particu- 
larly singled out than any other, that is to say, so 
as in one of them to put my things on board, and 
in the other to have agreed with the captain ; I say, 
two of these ships miscarried, viz. one was taken by 
the Algerines, and the other was cast away on the 
Start, near Torbay, and all the people drowned ex- 
cept three; so that in either of those vessels I had 
been made miserable, and in which most, it was 
hard to say. 

Having been thus harassed in my thoughts, 
my old pilot, to whom I communicated every thing, 
pressed me earnestly not to go to sea; but either 
to go by land to the Groyne, and cross over the 
Bay of Biscay to Rochelle, from whence it was but 
an easy and safe journey by land to Paris, and so 
to Calais and Dover; or to go up to Madrid, and 
so all the way by land through France. 

In a word, I was so prepossessed against my go- 
ing by sea at all, except from Calais to Dover, that 
I resolved to travel all the way by land; which, 
as I was not in haste, and did not value the charge, 
was by much the pleasanter way; and to make it 
more so, my old captain brought an English gen- 
tleman, the son of a merchant in Lisbon, who was 
willing to travel with me; after which, we picked 
up two who were English, and merchants also, 



382 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

and two young Portuguese gentlemen, the last go- 
ing to Paris only; so that we were in all six of us, 
and five servants, the two merchants, and the two 
Portuguese, contenting themselves with one ser- 
vant between two, to save the charge; and as for 
me I got an English sailor to travel with me as a 
servant, besides my man Friday, who was too much 
a stranger to be capable of supplying the place of 
a servant upon the road, 

In this manner I set out for Lisbon: and our 
company being all very well mounted and armed, 
we made a little troop, whereof they did me the 
honour to call me captain, as well because I was 
the oldest man, as because I had two servants, 
and indeed was the original of the whole journey. 

As I have troubled you with none of my sea 
journals, so shall I trouble you with none of my 
land journals. But some adventures that happened 
to us in this tedious and difficult journey, I must 
not omit. 

When we came to Madrid, we, being all of us 
strangers to Spain, were willing to stay some 
time to see the court of Spain, and to see what 
was worth observing; but it being the latter part 
of the summer, we hastened away, and set out 
from Madrid about the middle of October. But 
when we came to the edge of Navarre, we were 
alarmed at several towns on the way, with an 
account that so much snow was fallen on the 
French side of the mountains, that several tra- 
vellers were obliged to come back to Pampeluna, 
after having attempted, at an extreme hazard, to 
pass on. 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 383 

When we came to Pampeluna itself, we found 
it so indeed ; and to me that had been always used 
to an hot climate, and indeed to countries where 
we could scarce bear any clothes on, the cold was 
insufferable; nor, indeed, was it more painful than 
it was surprising, to come but ten days before out 
of the Old Castile, where the weather was not only- 
warm, but very hot, and immediately to feel a wind 
from the Pyrenean mountains, so very keen, so 
severely cold, as to be intolerable, and to endanger 
benumbing and perishing of our fingers and toes, 
was very strange. 

Poor Friday was really frighted when he saw 
the mountains all covered with snow, and felt cold 
weather, which he had never seen or felt before 
in his life. 

To mend the matter, after we came to Pampe- 
luna, it continued snowing with so much violence, 
and so long, that the people said, winter was come 
before its time; and the roads, which were difficult 
before, were now quite impassable: in a word, the 
snow lay in some places too thick for us to travel ; 
and being not hard frozen, as is the case in north- 
ern countries, there was no going without being 
in danger of being buried alive every step. We 
staid no less than twenty days at Pampeluna; 
when (seeing the winter coming on, and no like- 
lihood of its being better, for it was the severest 
winter all over Europe that had been known in 
many years) I proposed that we should all go away 
to Fontarabia, and there take shipping for Bour- 
deaux, which was a very little voyage. 

But white we were considering this, there came 



384 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

in four French gentlemen, who, having been stop- 
ped on the French side of the passes, as we were 
on the Spanish, had found oat a guide, who tra- 
versing the country near the head of Languedoc, 
had brought them over the mountains by such 
ways, that they were not much incommoded with 
the snow; and where they met with snow in any 
quantity, they said it was frozen hard enough to 
bear them and their horses. 

We sent for this guide, who told us, he would 
undertake to carry us the same way, with no 
hazard from the snow, provided we were armed 
sufficiently to protect us from wild beasts; for he 
said, upon these great snows, it was frequent for 
some wolves to shew themselves at the foot of the 
mountains, being made ravenous for want of food, 
the ground being covered with snow. We told 
him we were well enough prepared for such crea- 
tures as they were, if he would insure us from a 
kind of two-legged wolves, which we were told 
we were in most danger from, especially on the 
Frerfch side of the mountains. 

Ut satisfied us there was no danger of that kind 
in the way that we were to go: so we readily 
agreed to follow him: as did also twelve other 
gentlemen, with their servants, some French, some 
Spanish, who, as I said, had attempted to go, and 
were obliged to come back again. 

Accordingly we all set out from Pampeluna, 
with our guide, on the fifteenth of November; 
and indeed, I was surprised, when, instead of 
going forward, he came directly back with us, on 
the same road that we came from Madrid, above 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 3S5 

twenty miles; when having passed two rivers, and 
come into the plain country, we found ourselves 
in a warm climate again, where the country was 
pleasant, and no snow to be seen; but on a sudden, 
turning to the left, he approached the mountains 
another way; and though it is true, the hills and 
the precipices looked dreadfully, yet he made so 
many tours, such meanders, and led us by sucli 
winding ways, we insensibly passed the height of 
the mountains, without being much incumbered 
with the snow; and all on a sudden he shewed us 
the pleasant fruitful provinces of Languedoc and 
Gascoigne, all green and flourishing; though in- 
deed they were at a great distance, and we had 
some rough way to pass yet. 

We were a little uneasy, however, when we 
found it snowed one whole day and a night, so 
fast, that we could not travel; but he bid us be 
easy, we should soon be past it all. We found,, in- 
deed, that we began to descend every day, and to 
come more north than before; and so, depending 
upon our guide, we went on. 

It was about two hours before night, when our 
guide being something before us, and not just in 
sight, out rushed three monstrous wolves, and after 
them a bear, out of an hollow way, adjoining to a 
thick wood: two of the wolves flew upon the 
guide, and had he been half a mile before us, he 
had been devoured indeed, before we could have 
helped him: one of them fastened upon his horse 
and the other attacked the man with that violence 
that he had not time, or not presence of mind 
vol. i. 2 c 



386 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

enough, to draw his pistol, but hallooed and cried 
out to us most lustily. My man Friday being next 
to me, I bid him ride up, and see what was the 
matter. As soon as Friday came in sight of the 
man, he hallooed, as loud as the other, O master! 
O master! But, like a bold fellow, rode directly 
tip to the man, and with his pistol shot the wolf 
that attacked him in the head. 

It was happy for the poor man that it was my 
man Friday; for he, having been used to that kind 
of creature in his country, had no fear upon him, 
but went close up to him, and shot him as above; 
whereas any of us would have fired at a further 
distance, and have perhaps either missed the wolf, 
or endangered shooting the man. 

But it was enough to have terrified a bolder 
man than I, and indeed it alarmed all our company, 
when, with the noise of Friday's pistol, we heard 
on both sides the dismallest bowlings of wolves, 
and the noise redoubled by the echo of the moun- 
tains, that it was to us as if there had been a pro- 
digious multitude of them; and perhaps indeed 
there was not such a few, as that we had no cause 
of apprehensions. 

However, as Friday had killed this wolf, the 
other, that had fastened upon the horse, left hirh 
immediately, and fled, having happily fastened 
upon his head, where the bosses of the bridle had 
stuck in his teeth, so that he had not done him 
much hurt: the man, indeed, was most hurt; for 
the raging creature had bit him twice, once on 
i\\e arm, and the other time a little above his knee; 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 38? 

and he was just as it were tumbling down by the 
disorder of the horse, when Friday c&me up, and 
shot the wolf. 

It is easy to suppose, that at the noise of Friday's 
pistol we all mended our pace, and rid up as fast 
as the way (which was very difficult) would give 
us leave, to see what was the matter: as soon as 
we came clear of the trees, which blinded us before, 
we saw plainly what had been the case, and how 
Friday had disengaged the poor guide; though 
we did not presently discern what kind of creature 
it was he had killed. 

But never was a fight managed so hardily, and 
in such a surprising manner, as that which fol- 
lowed between Friday and the bear, which gave 
us all (though at first we were surprised and afraid 
for him) the greatest diversion imaginable; as the 
bear is an heavy, clumsy creature, and does not 
gallop as the wolf does, which is swift and light; 
so he has two particular qualities, which generally 
are the rule of his actions; first as to men, who 
are not his proper prey, I say not his proper prey, 
because though I cannot say what excessive hun- 
ger might do, which was now their case, the 
ground being all covered with snow; yet as to 
men, he does not usually attempt them, unless they 
first attack him; on the contrary, if you meet him 
in the woods, if you do not meddle with him, he 
will not meddle with you; yet then you must take 
care to be very civil to him, and give him the 
road; for he is a very nice gentleman; he will not 
go a step out of the way for a prince; nay, if you 
are really afraid, your best way is to look another 

2C2 



388 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

way, and keep going on ; for sometimes, if you 
stop, and stand still, and look stedfastlyat him, he 
takes it for an affront; and if you throw or toss 
any thing at him, and it hits him, though it were 
but a bit of stick as big as your finder, he takes it 
for an affront,^, and sets all other business aside to 
pursue his revenge; for lie wdi have satisfaction in 
point of honour, and this is his first quality; the 
next is, that if he be once affronted, he will never 
leave you, night or clay, till he has his revenge, 
but follow at a good round rate till he overtakes 
you. 

My man Friday had delivered our guide, and 
when we came up to him, he was helping him off 
from his horse; for the man was both hurt and 
frighted, and indeed the last more than the first ; 
when, on a sudden, we espied the bear come out 
of the wood, and a very monstrous one it was, the 
biggest by far that ever I saw : we were all a little 
surprised when we saw him; but when Friday saw 
him, it was easy to see joy and courage in the 
fellow's countenance: O! O! O! says Friday, three 
times, pointing to him, O master! you give me te 
leave, me shakee te hand with him, me makeeyou 
good laugh. 

I was surprised to see the fellow so pleased. 
You fool you, said I, he will eat you up. Eatee 
me up! eatee me up! says Friday, twice over again; 
Me eatee him up; me make you good laugh; you 
all stay here, me shew you good laugh ; so down 
he sits, and gets his boots off in a moment, and 
put on a pair of pumps (as we call the flat shoes 
they wear) and which he had in his pocket, and 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE, 58,9 

gives my other servant his horse, and, with his 
gun, away he flew, swift like the wind. 

The bear was walking softly on, and offered to 
meddle with nobody, till Friday coming pretty 
near, calls to him, as if the bear could understand 
him: Hark ye, hark ye, says Friday, me speakee 
wit vou. We followed at a distance: for now 
being come down to the Gascoigne side of the 
mountains, we were entered a vast great forest, 
where the country was plain, and pretty open, 
though many trees in it scattered here and there?. 

Friday, who had, as we say, the heels of the 
bear, came up with him quickly, and takes up a 
great stone, and throws at him, and hit him just 
on the head; but did him no more harm than if 
he had thrown it against a wall; but it answered 
Friday's end; for the rogue was so void of fear, 
that he did it purely to make the bear follow him, 
and shew us some laugh, as he called it. 

As soon as the bear felt the stone, and saw him, 
he turns about, and comes after him, taking de- 
vilish long strides, and shuffling along at a strange 
rate, so as he would put an horse to a middling 
gallop: away runs Friday, and takes his course, as 
if he ran towards us for help; so we all resolved 
to fire at once upon the bear, and deliver my man; 
though I was angry at him heartily for bringing 
the bear back upon us, when he was going about 
his own business another way; and especially I 
was angry that he had turned the bear upon us, 
and then run away; and I called out, You dog, 
said I, is this your making us laugh? Come away, 
and take your horse, that we may shoot the crea- 



390 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

ture. He hears me, and cries out, No shoot, no 
shoot, stand still, you get much laugh: and as the 
nimble creature ran two feet for the beast's one, 
lie turned on a sudden, on one side of us, and see- 
ing a great oak tree, fit for his purpose, he beck- 
oned us to follow, and doubling his pace, he gets 
nimbly up the tree, laying his gun down upon the 
ground, at about five or six yards from the bottom 
of the tree. 

The bear soon came to the tree, and we fol- 
lowed at a distance; the first thing he did, he 
stopped at the gun, smelt to it, but let it lie, and up 
he scrambles into the tree, climbing like a cat, 
though so monstrous heavy. I was amazed at the 
folly, as I thought it, of my man, and could not 
for my life see any thing to laugh at yet, till see- 
ing the bear get up the tree, we all rode nearer to 
him. 

When we came to the tree, there was Friday got 
out to the small of a large limb of the tree, and 
the bear got about half way to him; as soon as the 
bear got out to that part where the limb of the 
tree was weaker, Ha, says he to us, now you see 
me teachee the bear dance; so he falls a jumping, 
and shaking the bough, at which the bear began 
to totter, but stood still, and began to look behind 
him, to see how he should get back; then indeed 
we did laugh heartily. But Friday had not done 
with him by a great deal: when he sees him stand 
still, he calls out to him again, as if he had sup- 
posed the bear could speak English, What, you 
come no further? Pray you come further. So he 
left jumping and shaking the bough; and the bear. 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 391 

just as if he understood what he said, did come a 
little further;, then he fell a jumping again, and 
the bear stopped again. 

We thought now was a good time to knock him 
on the head, and called to Friday to stand still, 
and we would shoot the bear; but he cried out 
earnestly, O pray! O pray! no shoot, me shoot 
by and then; he would have said, by and bye. 
However, to shorten the story, Friday danced so 
much and the bear stood so ticklish, that we had 
laughing enough indeed, but still could not ima- 
gine what the fellow would. do; for first we thought 
he depended upon shaking the bear off; and we 
found the bear was too cunning for that too; for 
he would not get out far enough to be thrown 
down, but clings fast with his great broad claws and 
feet, so that we could not imagine what would be 
the end of it, and where the jest would be at last. 

But Friday put us out of doubt quickly; for 
seeing the bear cling fast to the bough, and that 
he would not be persuaded to come any further, 
Well, well, said, said Friday, you no come further, 
me go, me go; you no come to me, me come to 
you; and upon this he goes out to the smallest 
end of the bough, where it would bend with his 
weight, and gently lets himself down by it sliding 
down the bough, till he came near enough to jump 
down on his feet, and away he ran to his gun, takes 
it up, and stands still. 

Well, said I to him, Friday, what will you do 
now? Why don't you shoot him? No shoot, says 
Friday, no yet; me shoot now me no kill; me stay, 
give you one more laugh; and indeed so he did, as 



3£2 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

you will see presently; for when the bear saw his 
enemy gone, he comes back from the bough 
where he stood, but did it mighty leisurely, 
looking behind him every step, and coming back- 
ward till he got into the body of the tree; then 
with the same hinder end foremost, he came down 
the tree, grasping it with his claws, and moving 
one foot at a time, very leisurely; at this junc- 
ture, and just before he could set his hind feet upon 
the ground, Friday stepped close to him, clapped 
the muzzle of his piece into his ear, and shot him 
as dead as a stone. 

Then the rogue turned about, to see if we did 
not laugh; and when he saw we were pleased by 
our looks, he falls a laughing himself very loud; 
So we kills bear in my country, says Friday. So 
you kill them, said I; why you have no guns. 
No, says he, no guns, but shoot great much long 
arrow. 

This was, indeed, a good diversion to us, but we 
were still in a wild place, and our guide very much 
hurt, and what to do we hardly knew; the howl- 
ing of wolves ran much in my head; and indeed 
except the noise I once heard on the shore of 
Africa, of which I have said something already, I 
never heard any thing that filled me with so much 
horror. 

These things, and the approach of night, called 
us off, or else, as Friday would have had us, we 
should certainly have taken the skin of this mon- 
strous creature off, which was worth saving; but 
we had three leagues to go, and our guide hastened 
us; so we left him, and went forward on our jour- 
ney* 



OF ROBINSON" CRUSOE. 393 

The ground was still covered with snow, though 
not so deep and dangerous as on the mountains; 
and the ravenous creatures, as we heard afterwards, 
were come down into the forest and plain country, 
v pressed by hunger, to seek for food, and had done 
a great deal of mischief in the villages,- where they 
surprised the country people, killed a great many 
of their sheep and horses, and some people too. 

We had one dangerous place to pass, of which 
our guide told us, if there were any more wolves 
in the country, we should find them there; and 
this was a small plain, surrounded with woods on 
every side, and a long narrow defile or lane, which 
we were to pass to get through the wood, and then 
we should come to the village where we were to 
lodge. 

It was within half an hour of sunset when we 
entered the first wood; and a little after sunset, 
when we came into the plain. We met with no- 
thing in the first wood, except that in a little plain 
within the wood, which was not above two fur- 
longs over, we saw five great wolves cross the road, 
full speed one after another, as if they had been 
in chase of some prey, and had it in view; they 
took no notice of us, and were gone and out of 
sight in a few moments. 

Upon this our guide, who, by the way, was a 
wretched faint-hearted fellow, bade us keep in a 
ready posture; for he believed there were more 
wolves a coming. 

We kept our arms ready, and our eyes about us; 
but we saw no more wolves till we came through 
that wood, which was near half a league, and en- 



3<)4 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

tered the plain; as soon as we came into the plain, 
we had occasion enough to look about us. The 
first object we met with was a dead horse, that is 
to say, a poor horse which the wolves had killed, 
and at least a dozen of them at work; we could 
not say eating of him, but picking of Ills bones 
rather; for they had eaten up all the flesh before. 
We did not think lit to disturb them at their 
feast, neither did they take much notice of us. 
Friday would have let fly at them, but I would 
not suffer him by any means; for I found we were 
like to have more business upon our hands than 
we were aware of. We were not half gone over 
the plain, but we began to hear the wolves howl 
in the woods, on our left, in a frightful manner; 
and presently after we saw about an hundred com- 
ing on directly towards us, all in a body, and most 
of them in a line, as regularly as an army drawn 
up by experienced officers. I scarce knew in 
what manner to receive them; but found to draw 
ourselves in a close line, was the only way; so we 
formed in a moment; but, that we might not have 
too much interval, I ordered, that only every other 
man should fire; and that the others, who had not 
fired, should stand ready to give them a second 
volley immediately, if they continued to advance 
upon us; and that then those who had fired at 
first, should not pretend to load their fusils again, 
but stand ready, with every one a pistol, for we 
were all armed with a fusil, and a pair of pistols 
each man; so we were, by this method, able to 
fire six volleys, half of us at a time; however, at 
present we had no necessity; for, upon firing the 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 395 

first volley, the enemy made a full stop, being 
terrified, as well with the noise as with the fire; 
four of them, being shot in the head, dropped; 
several others were wounded, and went bleeding 
off, as we could see by the snow: I found they 
stopped, but did not immediately retreat; where- 
upon remembering that I had been told, that the 
fiercest creatures were terrified at the voice of a 
man, I caused all our company to halloo as loud 
as we could, and I found the notion not altogether 
mistaken; for upon our shout, they began to 
retire, and turn about; then I ordered a second 
volley to be fired in their rear, which put them 
to the gallop, and away they went to the woods. 

This gave us leisure to charge our pieces again, 
and that we might lose no time, we kept doing; 
but we had but little more than loaded our fusils, 
and put ourselves into a readiness, when we heard 
a terrible noise in the same wood, on our left ; 
only that it was further onward the same way we 
were to go. 

The night was coming on, and the night began 
to be dusky, which made it the worse on our side; 
but, the noise increasing, we could easily perceive 
that it was the howling and yelling of those hell- 
ish creatures; and, on a sudden, we perceived two 
or three troops of wolves on our left, one behind 
us, and one on our front, so that we seemed to be 
surrounded with them; however, as they did not 
fall upon us, we kept our way forward, as fast as 
we could make our horses go, which, the way 
being very rough, was only a good large trot; and 
in this manner we only came in view of the en- 



396 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

trance of the wood through which we were to 
pass, at the farther side of the plain: but we were 
greatly surprised, when, coming near the lane, or 
pass, we saw a confused number of wolves stand- 
ing just at the entrance. 

On a sudden, at another opening of the wood, 
we heard the noise of a gun; and, looking that 
way, out rushed an horse, with a saddle and a 
bridle on him, flying like the wind, and sixteen 
or seventeen wolves after him full speed; indeed 
the horse had the heels of them; but as we sup- 
posed that he could not hold it at that rate, we 
doubted not but they would get up with him at 
last; and no question but they did. 

Here we had a most horrible sight; for, riding up 
to the entrance where the horse came out, we found 
the carcase of another horse, and of two men de- 
voured by these ravenous creatures, and of one 
the man was no doubt the same whom we heard 
fire a gun, for there lay a gun just by him fired 
off; but as to the man, his head, arid the upper 
part of his body, were eaten up. 

This filled us with horror, and we knew not 
what course to take; but the creatures resolved 
us soon, for they gathered about us presently, in 
hopes of prey; and I verily believe there were 
three hundred of them. It happened very much 
to our advantage, that at the entrance into the 
wood, but a little way from it, there lay some large 
timber trees, which had been cut down the sum- 
mer before, and I suppose lay there for carriage; 
I drew my little troop in among these trees, and 
placing ourselves in a^line behind one long tree, I 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 397 

advised them all to alight, and, keeping that tree 
before us, for a breast-work, to stand in a triangle, 
or three fronts, inclosing our horses in the centre. 

We did so, and it was well we did; for never 
was a more furious charge than the creatures made 
upon us in this place; they came on us with a 
growling kind of a noise, and mounted the piece 
of timber (which, as I said, was our breast-work,) 
as if they w'ere^only rushing upon their prey ; and 
this fury of theirs, it seems, was principally occa- 
sioned by their seeing our horses behind us, which 
was the prey they aimed at: I ordered our men 
to fire as before, every man; and they took their 
aim so sure, that indeed they killed several of the 
wolves at the first volley; but there was a neces- 
sity to keep a continual firing, for they came on 
like devils, those behind pushing on those before. 

When we had fired our second volley of fusils, 
we thought they stopped a little, and I hoped they 
would have gone off, but it was but a moment, for 
others came forward again ; so we fired our volleys 
of pistols; and 1 believe in these four firings, we 
killed seventeen or eighteen of them, and lamed 
twice as many; yet they came on again. 

I was loth to spend our last shot too hastity; so 
I called my servant, not my man Friday, for he 
was better employed; for, with the greatest dex- 
terity imaginable, he charged my fusil and his 
own, while we were engaged; but, as I said, I 
called my other man; and giving him a horn of 
powder, I bade him lay a train all along the piece 
of timber, and let it be a large train; he did so, 
and had but time to get away, when the wolves 



398 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

came up to it, and some were got up upon it; 
when I, snapping an uncharged pistol close to the 
powder, set it on fire; and those that were upon 
the timber were scorched with it, and six or seven 
of them fell, or rather jumped in among us, with 
the force and fright of the fire; we dispatched 
these in an instant, and the rest were so frighted 
with the light, which the night, for now it was 
very near dark, made more terrible, that they drew 
back a little. 

Upon which I ordered our last pistols to be 
fired off in one volley, and after that we gave a 
shout; upon this the wolves turned tail, and we 
sallied immediately upon near twenty lame ones, 
which we found struggling on the ground, and 
fell a cutting them with our swords, which an- 
swered our expectation; for the crying and howl- 
ing they made were better understood by their 
fellows; so that they fled and left us. 

We had, first and last, killed about threescore 
of them; and had it been day-light, we had killed 
many more. The field of battle being thus cleared, 
we made forward again, for we had still near a 
league to go; we heard the ravenous creatures 
howl and yell in the woods as we went, several 
times; and sometimes we fancied we saw some of 
them, but the snow dazzling our eyes, we were 
not certain ; so in about an hour more we came to 
the town where we were to lodge, which we found 
in a terrible fright, and all in arms; for, it seems, 
that, the night before, the wolves and some bears 
had broken into that village, and put them in a 
terrible fright; and they were obliged to keep 



OP ROBINSON CRUSOE. 399 

guard night and day, but especially in the night, 
to preserve their cattle, and indeed their people. 

The next morning our guide was so ill, and his 
limbs so swelled with the rankling of his two 
wounds, that he could go no further; so we were 
obliged to take a new guide there, and go to Tho- 
louse, where We found a warm climate, a fruitful, 
pleasant country, and no snow, no wolves, or any 
thing like them; but when we told our story at 
Tholouse, they told us it was nothing but what 
was ordinary in the great forest at the foot of the 
mountains, especially when the snow lay on the 
ground; but they inquired much what kind of a 
guide we had gotten, that would venture to bring 
us that way in such a severe season; and told us, 
it was very much we were not all devoured. When 
we told them how we placed ourselves, and the 
horses in the middle, they blamed us exceedingly, 
and told us it was fifty to one but we had been all 
destroyed; for it was the sight of the horses that 
made the wolves so furious, seeing their prey; and 
that at other times they are really afraid of a gun; 
but they being excessive hungry, and raging on 
that account, the eagerness to come at the horses 
had made them senseless of danger; and that if 
we had not by the continued fire, and at last by 
the stratagem of the train of powder, mastered 
them, it had been great odds but that we had been 
torn to pieces; whereas, had we been content to 
have sat still on horseback, and fired as horsemen, 
they would not have taken the horses so much foe 
their own, when men were on their backs, as other- 
wise; and withal they told us, that at last, if we 



400 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

had stood altogether, and left our horses, they 
would have been so eager to have devoured them, 
that we might have come off safe, especially hav- 
ing our fire-arms in our hands, and being so many 
in number. 

For my part, I was never so sensible of danger 
in my life; for seeing above three hundred devils 
come roaring and open-mouthed to devour us, and 
having nothing to shelter us, or retreat to, I gave 
myself over for lost; and as it was, I believe, I 
shall never care to cross those mountains again; I 
think I would much rather go a thousand leagues 
by sea, though I were sure- to meet with a storm 
once a week. 

I have nothing uncommon to take notice of in 
my passage through France; nothing but what 
other travellers have given an account of, with 
much more advantage than I can. I travelled from 
Tholouse to Paris, and without any considerable 
stay, came to. Calais, and landed safe at Dover, 
the fourteenth of January, after having had a 
severe cold season to travel in. 

I was now come to the centre of my travels, 
and had in a little time all my new discovered 
estate safe about me, the bills of exchange, which 
I brought with me, having been very currently 
paid. 

My principal guide and privy counsellor, was 
my good ancient widow, who, in gratitude for the 
money I had sent her, thought no pains too much, 
or care too great, to employ for me; and I trusted 
her so entirely with every thing, that I was per- 
fectly easy as to the security of my effects; and 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 401 

indeed I was very happy from my beginning* and 
now to the end, in the unspotted integrity of thi* 
good gentlewoman. 

And now I began to think of leaving my effects 
with this woman, and setting out for Lisbon, and 
so to the Brasils: but now another scruple came 
in the way, and that was religion ; for as I had ■ 
entertained some doubts about the Roman religion, 
even while I was abroad., especially in my state of 
solitude; so I knew there was no going to the 
Brasils for me, much less going to settle there, un- 
less I resolved to embrace the Roman Catholic re- 
ligion, without any reserve; except on the other 
hand I resolved to be a sacrifice to my principles, 
be a martyr for religion/ and die in the Inquisition: 
so I resolved to stay at home, and if I could find 
means for it, to dispose of my plantation. 

To this purpose I wrote to my old friend at Lis- 
bon, who in return gave me notice, that he could 
easily dispose of it there: but that if I thought 
fit to give him leave to offer it in my name to the 
two merchants, the survivors of my trustees who 
lived in the Brasils, who must fully understand 
the value of it, who lived just upon the spot, and 
who I knew to be very rich, so that he believed 
they would be fond of buying it; he did not 
doubt, but I should make 4 or 5000 pieces of 
eight the more of it 

Accordingly I agreed, gave him orders to offer 
it to them, and he did so; and in about eight 
months more, the ship being then returned, he 
sent me an account, that they had accepted the 
offer, and had remitted 33,000 pieces of eight to 
vol. j, a D 



40& LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

a correspondent of theirs at Lisbon, to pay for 
it. 

In return, I signed the instrument of sale in the 
form which they sent from Lisbon, and sent it to 
my old man, who sent me the bills of -exchange 
for 32,800 pieces of eight for the estate; reserving 
the payment of 100 moidores a year, to him, (the 
old man,) during his life, and 50 moidores after- 
wards to his son for his life, which I had promised 
them; and which the plantation was to make good 
as a rent charge. And thus I have given the first 
part of a life of fortune and adventure, a life of 
Providence's chequer-work, and of a variety which 
the world will seldom be able, to shew the like of: 
beginning foolishly, but closing much more hap- 
pily than any part of it ever gave me leave so 
much as to hope for. 

Any one would think, that in this state of com- 
plicated good fortune, I was past running any more 
hazards, and so indeed I had been, if other circum- 
stances had concurred: but I was inured to a 
wandering life, had no family, nor many relations: 
nor, however rich, had I contracted much ac- 
quaintance; and though I had sold my estate in 
the Brasils, yet I could not keep that country out 
of my head, and had a great mind to be upon the 
wing again; especially I could not resist the strong 
inclination I had to see my island, and to know if 
the poor Spaniards were in being there; and how 
the rogues I left there had used them. 
. My true friend the widow earnestly dissuaded 
me from it, and so far prevailed with me, that 
almost for seven years she prevented my running 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 403 

abroad ; during which time I took my two nephews, 
the children of one of my brothers, into my care: 
the eldest having something of his own, I bred up 
as a gentleman, and gave him a settlement of some 
addition to his estate, after my decease; the other 
I put out to a captain of a ship; and after five 
years, finding him a sensible, bold, enterprising 
young fellow, I put him into a good ship, and sent 
him to sea: and this young fellow afterwards drew 
me in, as old as I was, to further adventures 
myself. 

In the mean time, I in part settled myself here: 
for, first of all I married, and that not either to 
my disadvantage or dissatisfaction; and had three 
children, two sons and one daughter: but my wife 
dying, and my nephew coming home with good 
success from a voyage to Spain, my inclination to 
go abroad, and his importunity, prevailed, and en- 
gaged me to go in his ship as a private trader to 
the East Indies. This was in the year I694. 

In this voyage I visited my new colony in the 
island, saw my successors the Spaniards, had the 
whole storv of their lives, and of the villains I left 
there; how at first they insulted the poor Spaniards, 
how they afterwards agreed, disagreed, united, 
separated, and hew at last the Spaniards were 
obliged to use violence with them; how they were 
subjected to the Spaniards; how honestly the 
Spaniards used them ; an history, if it were entered 
into, as full of variety and wonderful accidents as 
my own part; particularly also as to their battles 
with the Caribbeans, who landed several times 
upon the island, and as to the improvement they 

d 2 



404 3LI*E AND ADVENTURES 

made upon the island itself; and how five of them 
made an attempt upon the main land, and brought 
away eleven men and five women prisoners; by 
winch, at my coming, I found about twenty young 
children on the island. 

Here I stayed about twenty days; left them 
supplies of all necessary things, and particularly of 
arms, powder, shot, clothes, tools, and two work- 
men, which I brought from England with me; 
viz. a carpenter and a smith. 

Besides this, I shared the land into parts with 
them, reserved to myself the property of the whole, 
but gave them such parts, respectively, as they 
agreed on; and, having settled all things with 
them, and engaged them not to leave the place, I 
left them there. 

From thence I touched at the Brasils, from 
whence I sent a bark, which I bought there, with 
more people, to the island; and in it, besides other 
supplies, I sent seven women, being such as I 
found proper for service, or for wives to such as 
^vould take them. As to the Englishmen, I pro- 
mised them to send them some women from Ei> 
gland, with a good cargo of necessaries, if they 
would apply themselves to planting; which I 
afterwards could not perform ; the fellows proved 
very honest and diligent, after they were mastered, 
and had their properties set apart for them. I 
sent them also from the Brasils five cows, three of 
them being big with calf, some sheep, and some 
hogs, which, when I came again, were consider- 
ably increased. 

But all these things, with an account how 500 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 405 

Caribbees came and invaded them, and ruined 
their plantations, and how they fought with that 
whole number twice, and were at first defeated 
and one of them killed; but at last a storm de- 
stroying their enemies' canoes, they famished or 
destroyed almost all the rest, and renewed and 
recovered the possession of their plantation, and 
Still lived upon the island. 

All these things, with some very surprising in- 
cidents in some new adventures of my own, for 
ten years more, I may, perhaps, give a further 
(account of hereafter.
