My days and nights were mu of joy,
My mates were blythe and kind;

No wonder that I sometimes sigh,

And dash the tear-drop from my eye,
To cast a look behind 1

ROBINSON CRUSOE RUNS AWAY FROM
HOME.

Robinson was the "only child of Mr.
and Mrs. Crusoe, Who once' lived in the
town. of Exeter. The boy liked better
to play than to learn any thing, andQ
thus his life went on, till he grew to be
a tall, stout lad, and then his father
said that he must be put 'to learn a10 ROBINSON onuson

trade, and so be made a man of. The
thought of going to work did not suit
Robinson at all, he said that he wished
to go abroad to see the world. When
a man wishes to be any the better for
seeing other lands, he must read and
know a great deal before-hand, but
Robinson was much too idle, and self-
willed, to do this. Robinson had wasted
the first sixteen years of his life, and
every day teased his father for leave to
go to sea. His father told him he did
not know what he asked, and would not
hear a word about it. His mother always
said, " My dear boy, stay in your own
land, and never think of going away from

9'

us.

One day as Robinson was going along
the street, with hands in his pockets as
usual, he met an old play-mate, WhoseRUNS AWAY FROM HOME. 11

father was captain of a ship, and had just
come from Plymouth to see some of his
friends at Exeter.

The young man told Robinson that his
father would be off in a day or two for
Amsterdam--" Would he like to go
there?"
' " Yes, very muc , said Robinson,
" but my parents will not give me leave."

" Peoh, said the other, come off with
me, as you are, just for the fun. We.
shall be back in a month or six weeks;

n

and as to your father and mother, you
have only to let them know Where you are
gone." _

" Bu ," said Robinson, "I have no"
money in my purse."

" You will not want any," said his
friend, " and if you .do, when we get to
Amsterdam I will lend you some."
Young Robinson did not take time for
more thought, but giving his friend aslap
on the back, and a shake by the hand,
said, " Well my boy! I will go, let us be
off to Plymouth at once!" He had the
grace to leave a message for his parents '
to say that he would not come home that
night, nor for a week or two, as he was
gone to see the Dutch city of Amsterdam.

After Robinson and the captain's son
had got on board ship, the sailors weighed
anchor, and set their sails. The wind
blew fresh, and they were soOn out of
port. Crusoe staid on deck with his
friendhalmost out of his wits with joy----
for he had now set oif to see the world.

With a. good breeze they were soon out
of sight of land, and Robinson saw nothing
but the sky over-head, and nothing round
about him but the sea and its white waves.
For two days they had fair weather,
but on the third day the sky grew dark
with clouds, and a storm came on. Rain
fell like a flood, and the wind tossed the
sea about in such a way that the waves
rose to a great height.

Then the ship went see-saW,--at one
time a wave seemed to take it up to the
clouds, and then again down it went,
as if into the very depths of the ocean.
It rolled from side to side, so that at
times the masts were even with the top of
the water. What a noise amongst the
ropes, and what a clatter on deck! Even
the sailors were obliged to hold fast, for
fear of being washed over-board. .

Robinson Crusoe felt so sick and ill, ,
that he thought he should die. He was ,
What We call sea-sick, and bad enough
that is to bear. He lay like a log, but
now and then "he had just sense enough
to moan, and cry, " Oh ! my poor mother,
she will never see me again; what a foolish
and bad boy I have been." Crack! went
something on deck--the sailors clasped
their hands. " What is the matter?"
cried Robinson, who was half dead with
fear.

" Oh! we are lost," said one of the sea-
men. " Our mizen mast is in pieces, (that
is, the hind-mast of a ship with three
masts), and the main-mast stands by such
slight hold that we must cut it down, and
throw it over-board."

" We are lost!" cried a voice from
-' below. " The ship has sprung a leak,
and there are four feet water in the hold.

At these words, Robinson, who sat on
the cabin-floor, fell back-wards quite faint.
All the rest ran to the pumps, and set to
work at them, as the only hope to keep
the ship afloat. At last one of the sailors
shook Robinson, to wake him up, and
asked if " he meant to be the only one to
do nothing, while all the rest would work
till they could not stand."

At this, Robinson tried to rise, weak
as he was, and took his place at one
of the pumps. In the mean-time, the
captain gave orders to fire some guns, as
signs of distress to any ship that might
be within hearing.

Robinson did not know what these
shots were for, and from fear, he fainted
away. A sailor took his place at the

pump, and pushed Robinson aside With 5

his foot, and left him there, stretched at
full length, for he thought him dead. The
men pumped with all their strength, but
the water rose so fast in the hold, they
saw the ship must soon sink. A ship far
off had heard the guns, and when the
storm began to abate, a boatwas sent
from it, to try to save the crew. The
waves ran so high, that no boat could get
near, but a rope was thrown out from the
sinking ship, and to its stem the little
boat was towed, when every one on board
who could use his legs jumped into it.
Robinson, who could not stand, was
thrown in by a sailor, who had more pity
than the rest.
A VOYAGE AND SHIPWRECK.

The ship that saved Robinson and
the rest of the crew was bound for
London. In four days she reached the
Nore, which is a sand-bank at the mouth
of the river Thames, where two lights
are hung up every night as a guide to
ships when they enter the river. All
went on shore with thankful hearts.

As to Robinson, his first care was, to
see London, and he spent two days in
walking about the city, where he met
with many things quite new to him,
which put all past danger out of mind,

as well as all thought for what was
' 3
to come. One day he met the captain
in whose ship he had sailed from
Plymouth, and was asked to dine with
him. Robinson was glad of this, for
he had spent the. money lent him by
the captain's son, and had no means left
to pay for a meal.

While they were at dinner, the captain
asked Robinson why he was going to
Amsterdam, and what he had to do there?
Robinson owned the truth, that he had
gone out just for a frolic, unknown to
his father and mother, and now could
not tell what to do with himself. " Not
known to your father and mother!" said
the Captain, laying down his knife and
fork. " Young man, if I had known
of this at Plymouth, I would not have
taken you on board my ship for all the

. gold in the world." '
Robinson sat mute for very shame,
he could not think of any excuse for his
folly. The good captain tried to make
him feel the wrong he had done. At
last he was sorry for it, and wept to
think of his parents. " But what can
I do now?" said the youth. " You can
do, what you ought," said his friend;
" go back to your parents, and beg them
to forgive you." " Will you take me
back to Plymouth again?" asked he.
"Have you forgot then that my ship is
lost? It will be a good while before I
go there in one of my own. As for you,
there is no time to lose. You should
go on board this very day." "But,"
said Robinson, "I have no money."
" Well, I will lend you some, out of the
little I have to spare. G0 at once, and

if you are truly sorry, your return may
B 2
be more happy than your out-set has
been." With these words, and having
made an end of dinner, he shook
Robinson by the hand, and wished him
: well. The young man went away with
' many thanks for so much kindness and
good advice. Robinson went down tc
the river side, and on the way thought
to himself--" What will my father and
mother say if I go back to them now?
Surely they will punish me for what I
have done; and worse than this, all the
lads will make game of me for coming
back when I have only seen a few streets
in London."

This last thought made him stop short
He did not like to go home so soon.
but then the captain had said, he wouli'
never be happy if he did not ~- go bacl
to his parents. He could not for .
long time make up his mind. At last,
he went down to the river, and found
there was no ship bound for Plymouth.
The man who then spoke to Robinson
was captain of a ship going to sail to
the coast of Guinea, in Africa, and when
he heard the youth wishing to see the
world, offered to take him, and show
him how to trade in that land.

"But," said Robinson, "I have very
little money." "Lay it out," said the
other, "in goods to sell again." " What
goods?" said Robinson. " All sorts of
toys, glass-beads, knives, scissors, and
gay ribbons, which the people in Africa
like so much, they will give you plenty
of gold and ivory in return for them."

Robinson was pleased, and at once
forgot his parents and friends, besides
all good advice. " Captain," he said,
"I am ready to go when you please."
" Done," said the other, taking him by
the hand, and so they went to the ship.
The captain soon put out to sea, and
again Robinson saw the great ocean.
Their course was south, and after a time
they heard guns of distress. They came
in sight of a ship, which had lost the
fore-mast and her bow-sprit, which is a
little mast that does not stand straight
up, but slopes out from the fore-part of
a. ship.

When near enough to speak, they
found it was an English ship, bound for
the West Indies. A fearful storm had
done the damage which kept them out
at sea, so long, they had no food left.
Robinson went on board with the
captain, and saw the sad state of the
crew--some dead, and others dying, fromA VOYAGE AND snrrwnncx. 23

want of food. Robinson's captain gave
all the help he could, and then told
them how to find their way to the
nearest land, which was that of the
Madeira Islands, where he, also, was
obliged to go, to take in fresh stores of
food and water.

The name Madeira, means a wood, or
forest; for such the island appears in
the midst of the ocean. '

Grapes grow well in Madeira, from
which wine is made. They used to
throw the grapes into a large tub, and
tread on them with the feet, or crush
them with the elbows.

Orange trees grow in Madeira, and
are a pretty sight. White flowers, of
sweet scent, with fruit in every state of
green, yellow, and bright tints, are seen
on them at the same time. These, when
ripe, are the rich golden balls, that are
so nice to eat.

Robinson was quite happy at first,
but soon got tired, and wished to be off
again.

He met with the captain of a ship
from Brazil, in South America, and from
him he heard some fine tales of gold-
dust, and bright stones of great price,
that might be picked up. As Robinson
would not read, or learn any thing while
at school, he did not know that all such
things belong to the king of the land
where they are found, and no one else
has a right, or dares to take them.
Robinson told the English captain that
he was going to leave him, and set off
on a voyage to Brazil. The captain was
willing to pay for the toys and hard-
ware that Robinson now wished to sell,
and was glad to part with him, having
found out that he was very idle, and
going about the world without leave of
his friends.

Robinson sailed quite across the
Atlantic ocean, and on the way he saw
some flying-fish. These are pretty fish,
with two long , fins that help them to
take a leap out of the water; but they
cannot fly like a bird. Sometimes they
fell on the deck and were caught, for
they are good to eat.

In seven days there was a cry of land!
Then came a shock, which made every-
one fall down.

The ship had run upon a sand-bank,
and there it stuck fast, as if nailed to
the spot. Great waves dashed over the
deck with such force that all were
obliged to get into the cabin. There,
nothing was heard but cries and groans.
Some were stupid with fear and grief.
This was the case with Robinson, who
felt more dead than alive. Then some
one called out that the ship had split,
and the crew rushed upon deck, to get
out the boats and jump into them with
all haste. A wave struck the boat in
which Robinson was, and upset it. He
was rudely thrown upon a piece of rock,
and the pain caused by the jolt, roused
him to the use of his senses. He opened
his eyes, and saw dry ground not far off,
if he could but reach it. This was done
by a last effort of his strength, and then
he lay a long time like one quite dead.
Life was still in him; and, after awhile,
he came to himself and looked round.
The ship--the boat--all was gone--
all lost! He could see nothing but a
few planks which the waves drove on to
the shore. He alone was saved--but,
what would become of him? No one to
speak to him--no one to help--in a
strange land! What would he find in"
it? Would there be wild beasts, or
men, more wild and savage still? Every
bone in his body shook with fear. He
dared not stir; but a burning thirst
came on, and forced him to try and find
some brook, or a spring of fresh water.
He soon saw a stream, so pure and clear
that he drank freely. He did not care
for food--it was not that he had most
need of; but where must he 'pass the
night? He saw no signs of but or cave,
and knew not what to do. Tears came
into his eyes, and he cried like a child.
This did him good, and then he
thought of the birds, and that he could
climb one of the tall trees not far off,
and there be safe from Wild beasts.

He found one, with boughs so thick
and close he could sit among them, so
as to stretch his stiff and weary limbs.

He fell asleep, and began to dream of
home, and his parents. He moved in
his sleep to rise and kiss them, and so
lost his seat on the branches and fell out
of the tree. He had not far to fall, and
the grass was so high and thick he was
not hurt. He climbed up once more
into the tree, and lay there till sun-rise.
He then began to think What he must
do to get food. He had no bread or
meat, and even if meat could be had,
there was no fire to roast, and no pot to
boil it in. The trees about him bore
no fruit, and he could see nothing else--
but grass and sand.
He wished now, that he too had been
lost in the waves, for he thought that a
slow death from hunger would be
worse.

While in this sad state of mind he
saw a sea-bird catch a fish, and fly off
with it. This put better thoughts into
his mind, and he tried to walk along the
shore hoping to find some shell-fish
there. He saw a heap of oyster-shells
torn up by the force of the storm from
their rocky bed, and to his great joy,
oysters were in some of them.

When this food had given Robinson
some strength, he was better able to
think, and plan some place of safety for
the next night. He had no tools--
nothing but his two hands, and they
were not used to any kind of work.
Then again he thought of his kind father
and mother and all their past love, and
care, and he fell down upon the ground
weeping for them.

While thus he lay in bitter g1 ief, a.
hymn that his mother used to sing came
into his mind, and the words of it
brought back hope and trust. He rose
up to try and find some place of safety.

For a long time his search was in
vain, but at last- he came to a hill, which
on one side was steep as a wall, and if
he had but a pick-axe, a cave could soon
be made there. The puzzle was, how to
do it with no tools. At last he thought
that he could pull up some young trees,
and plant them before the hole, so as to
screen it well, and then he could lie
down and sleep behind them. He set
about doing this, but it was slow work,
for he had to scoop out the earth with
his hands. The sun set, when he had
moved five or six trees.

Then he went along the shore to look
again for oysters, but this time it was in
vain. For want of knowing about the
tide, he had not put any oysters out of
reach of the waves, and now they could
not be seen, and so Robinson lost his
supper. He went to bed in the tree
again, but this time he took off his
garters, and tied himself tight to the
branches, that he might sleep Without
fear of a fall.
A NEW H OME-

Robinson slept till day-break, and
then felt ready to go to work again.
The first thing he did, was to set off for
the shore, in search of oysters. On his
way, he saw a tree which bore large
fruit. He did not know what it was,
but in the hope of something good to
eat he knocked one down. It was a
nut, the size of a small child's head.
The rind was full of stringy stuff like
hemp, and the shell under this, was very
hard. Robinson saw at once, that the
shell could be made into a cup. Inside
the nut was a white, hard, kernel, and
in the midst of it was some juice like
milk.

This was a great treat to the hungry,
half-starved Robinson, who did not guess
that he had found a cocoa-nut tree. It
proved to be the only one on his island.
Of this fruit it has been said,--

" The Indian nut alone
Is clothing, meat and trencher, drink and pan,
Boat, cable, sail and needle, all in one."

A few oysters were found, and this time
Robinson laid them up safely, for dinner.
On the shore he picked up a large shell,
which he thought would do for a spade.
He also found a plant with a stalk full of '
threads, like flax. He tied some of these
stalks into small bundles, and put them
to soak in fresh water. In a few days he

was able to make use of the stringy part
c
of these stalks by twisting them, so as to
form a sort of rough cord. He tied his
great shell to the end of a thick stick,
and this was his first tool. With its help
he then went on planting, tree close by
tree, until they made a slight fence. He
set a second row of trees in front of the
first, near enough for the branches to
meet. He filled up the space between
the two rows of trees with earth, so that
at last the fence was as firm as a wall.

Twice a day he took water from the
spring, with his cocoa-nut cup, to refresh
the young trees, which soon began to
sprout, and grow very nicely.

He spent awhole day in making pieces
of cord, for his plan was, to have no door
to his house, but get in and out by a
ladder of ropes.

There was a tree at the t0p of the rock
above the hole that was to be Robinson's
house, and to this tree he fixed the rope-
ladder. The next thing was, to make
the hole in the rock large enough to live
in. This could not be done with the
hand alone. Robinson went to a place
where he had seen some great stones on
the ground; he turned them over, and to
his great joy one of them had a round
hole through it. In shape it was rather
like a hatchet. With much trouble the
hole was made larger, to hold a strong
stick put into it by way of handle, and
made fast with cord. He sought again
amongst the stones, and found one that
would serve pretty well for a hammer.
He pulled some grass with his hands,
which was soon dried in the sun, and

this he took back to the hole in the rock, .

and made himself a bed.
0 2
From this time Robinson went to rest
like a man, instead of going to perch and
roost up in the trees, like a bird. When
Robinson lay down for the first time on
a soft bed of hay, he felt very thankful--
it was now his home!

Robinson had no paper, and nothing
to write with, but he chose four trees
near to each other, with smooth bark.
On one tree he made a notch every night,
to show that a day was gone. When
seven notches were made, he put one
notch in the next tree, to mark a week.
When that tree had four notches, he put
one notch in the third tree, to mark a
month, and when twelve months had
passed away he meant to put a notch in
the fourth tree, to show that a year was
gone. In this way Robinson could tell
when the Sabbath-day came round, and
make it, what the word means,--a " rest-
day."

Robinson knew that the large nuts on
his one tree would soon come to an end,
and it was but now and then that he
could find any oysters. What was to be
done to get more food? He must be
brave, and go abroad to see what was in
the island. The heat of the sun was so
great he could not bear it long without
some thing to serve as an umbrella.

One day he cut some sprigs of a tree
like a willow, and made a large, round
basket, not very deep. In the midst of
it he set a stick, and tied it fast with his
cord. He then went to the cocoa-nut
tree for some large leaves to fix on the
outside with fish bones, which did the
part of pins, and thus he made a rough
kind of umbrella to serve well for a shade; .
Robinson had now learned to be busy
in thought, and in his walks by the shore,
it struck him that the fish-bones he often
saw there might be of use as pins or

small nails, and he had picked up a store
of them.

When the umbrella was done,
Robinson looked at it with joy--but
then came the thought which he often
spoke aloud, " Oh! that I had never
been idle. How gladly now would I
work hard with tools, and learn a trade
with all my heart !"

The next thing he wanted, was a bag
or pouch to carry food. He had made
plenty of thin cord, and with that he might
weave a piece of net-work. Robinson
looked out for two trees, not more
than one yard apart, and to each of these
be fixed some threads, one close below
the other, thus making what weavers
would call the warp. Next he put
threads from top to bottom, knotting the
thread that went down with every thread
that went across, which in making cloth
would be called the woof.

In this way Robinson soon had'a nice
piece of net-work, such as fisher-men use.
He took his net from the trees,--joined
the sides with cord run in and out, and
left no part open but the top. Both ends
of a stout piece of cord were fitted to the
pouch, and by slipping the loop round
his neck the bag could be hung safely
by' his side. Robinson was so happy
when he saw the umbrella and bag ready
for use that he could hardly sleep at
night.
FIRST WALK INTO THE ISLAND.

Again Robinson was ready to get up
at sun-rise. He slipped the pouch-string
round his neck--put a strong cord round
his waist, by way of girdle, in which he
stuck the stone hatchet, to serve as a
sword in case of need. He took the
umbrella on his shoulder, and began to
march.

He went first to the cocoa-nut tree,
and put two nuts into his bag. Then
he sought for some oysters--eat a few,
and laid up a small store. The sun rose
grandly, and the birds began to sing.
Robinson also felt glad in the pure, fresh
air. He, too, raised his voice, and sang
the morning hymn, which his mother
had taught when he sat on her knee.
Robinson's fear of strange things, both
man and beast, made him keep on the
open ground, where he could see all
around him. This open space was so
bare that he walked a long way, and did
not find any thing of the least use. At
last he saw some plants with green fruit
and pulled them. up by the roots, to
which hung some knobs, and a few of
these he put into his pouch. .

These knobs were potatoes; but Ro-
binson knew nothing about them.

He went on his way, though the least
noise, even the wind among the trees,
was a sound to make him start.

At last he sat down by the side of w
brook, and began to eat his dinner. All
at once there was a loud rustle behind
him, and a troop of wild beasts sprung
out. No lions or tigers, but a kind of
sheep with a hump on their backs, and
soft woolly coats. They were lamas.

When the fright was over, Robinson
had time to think of the fresh meat to
live upon, if he could kill one of the
young lamas. They were so close to
him that he struck at one with his
hatchet; and it fell at his feet. There
lay the poor beast; but how to cook it
with no fire?

In the hope of striking a light, by
rubbing two bits of dry wood, Robinson
took up the lama, and turned his face
home-waid. On the way, he saw some
lemon-trees, and picked up Some of the
ripe fruit which had fallen, on the ground.
He took care so to mark this place in
his mind that he might know it again,
and then made haste to his cave.

When there, the first thing was, to
skin the lama. He did this by means of
a sharp flint, which served for a knife.
The skin was stretched out in the sun,
with great care, to dry. Robinson's
shoes and stockings were in holes, and
he thought the skin would do to make
new ones, so that he need not walk quite
bare-foot.

He thought, too, that winter must
come, for he had never read, and did not
know, that where the cocoa-nut tree
grows, there is no fear of cold, though
much need of Ishelter at the time of year
when rain falls for some weeks, all day
and all night:

Robinson soon made a spit of wood,
and put a piece of meat upon it. He
set to work with two bits of dry wood to
try and kindle a spark of fire, but in
vain--he could not do it. He did not
know that one piece of wood must be
hard and the other soft, to strike a light.
He sat down with a deep sigh. There
was the meat, and it would soon spoil.
Then he tried to beat the meat with
stones, which would make it tender, and
at least fit to eat. This done, he squeezed
a little lemon-juice upon it, and made a
good meal, feeling very thankful for once
more having food enough, and to spare.
He went to bed and was soon asleep,
after his long walk and the heat of the
day.THE STORM--A TREE SET ON FIRE.

Robinson slept for many hours, and
when he awoke, was sorry to find the
sun had been up long before him.

He wished to set off at once, to watch
for the lamas. No sooner did he put his
head out of the cave, than he was obliged
to draw it in again. It rained so hard
that he could not go out; and the storm
grew worse and --worse. Flashes ., of
lightning and loud claps of thunder
often made him start.

Thus he spent most of the day quite
shut up, and in fear for his life. At last
the rain began to abate. He was going
out to look round, when all at once he
fell back-wards. The tree which grew
at the top of the rock was struck
by lightning, and Robinson lay quite
stunned. When he came to his senses
he rose up, and found, out-side the cave,
many pieces of bark and wood from the
tree which the lightning had split.

A sad loss to Robinson; for how
could he fix the ladder of ropes if the
whole tree was gone, as he thought it
must be. When the storm was quite
over, Robinson took courage to go out;
and what did he see? The tree, struck
by lightning, was on fire!

Thus his fear was turned into jOy,
and he wept to think of his want .of
trust, while the sky had been over-cast.
Robinson looked at the piece of meatTHE STORM. 47

which was still upon the spit, raised up on
two forked sticks, just as he had left it the
day before. He soon found some bits of
dry wood--then took a burning branch
of the tree, and made a good fire to
roast his meat. He turned the spit with

care, but still he wanted some salt.
He thought of the salt sea-water so

near at hand, and fetched a. cup-full to
sprinkle over the meat. It was soon
done, and what Robinson" felt on the
first taste of it, can only be known by
those, who have been for a long time
forced to work on poor food, and without
any fire to cook it rightly. His daily_
care must now be to keep in the fire.
Heavy rain might put it out; the cave >>
was so small he could not keep it there,
for the smoke Would stifle him. What
was he to do? While in thought about
it, his eyes were fixed on the rock at the
edge of his cave, and a plan came into
his mind. .

One part of the rock jutted out about
a yard from the ground, and under this
ledge the earth was quite dry. Robinson
saw at once this would be the safe spot
for a kitchen hearth and fire-place. In
one of his walks he had seen some clay
which he. thought would do to make
bricks. This was the time to try, and
then build a wall on each side of the
hearth.

To the clay-field he went, with his
shell-spade, and knife of flint. Owing
to the rain he found the clay quite soft,
and easy to work into the shape of
bricks, which he cut smooth. with his
knife. He made many bricks, and put
them side by side, to bake in the' hot,THE s'romr. 49

sun. Then he went home to eat the
rest of his meat, and make it a feast-
day with part of a cocoa-nut. Robinson
was thankful, but sad thoughts came
over him, and he sighed--" How happy
should I be, thought he, if I had but
one friend, one man to live with me."
To hear "the sweet music of speech,"
was the deep want of his soul. It is the
gift that raises man above all. the beasts"
of the field, when he does not abuse it.
Poor Robinson! He sighed again,
"If I had but a dog or a'cat, I could
make it love me; but here I am so
lonely, the one living man on the face
of this earth." Tears fell fast, for he
knew how often he had cared for no one,
and spoken unkind words at home. Just
then, he saw a spider, which had spread

its Web in a corner. He would catch
n
flies for it, and make it know his hand.
Again he felt more hopeful, and taking
up his spade, set to work to dig out a
floor for the kitchen. While doing this,
he struck against something very hard
in the earth, and almost broke the spade.
He thought it was a stone; but no, it
was a large and heavy lump of gold!
He threw it aside--" Lie there," he said,
" the only metal that I do not care to
see. How much better for me had I
found a hatchet, a knife, a handful of
nails, or a loaf of bread!" Robinson
thought of an old fable his mother used
to tell about a cock that was scratching
in a dung-hill, and found a pearl of_
great price. A bright thing it was, and
fair to look upon. ' "But," said the

hungry cock, " a grain of barley would
be more to my taste."
ROBINSON BRINes HOME SOME LIVE
s'rooK. --

In Robinson's island, the heat of the
sun was so great, that he was obliged to
do the out-door work very early in the
day, or in the cool of the evening.

He rose before the sun, put fresh
wood on his fire, and ate the half of a
cocoa-nut, which was all he could spare
for breakfast. He meant to have put a
joint of meat on the spit ready for
dinner, but the heat had spoiled it, and
he was obliged to go Without meat for
that day. Taking up his pouch, he

found the roots in it which he fhad
' D '2
brought home two days before. There
was no harm in trying to cook them,
so they were put amongst the ashes
close to the fire, and then Robinson set
off to the clay-pit.

He made some bricks, and then went
I down to the shore to look for oysters.
They were scarce; but he saw a living.
thing that he had heard of as good to
eat. It was a turtle, which has a strong,
heavy shell on its back, and looks just
like a huge tortoise. Robinson killed
the poor thing, and took it home on his
back. He was very hungry, and lost
no time in roasting some of the flesh.
But What to do with the rest, to make
it keep for a day or two? He thought
awhile, and said to himself, " The shell
shall do for a bowl to salt it 'in: but
where is the salt?"BRINGS HOME SOME LIVE STOCK. 53

He thought again for a moment or two
" How stupid I must be to want salt.
Surely it will be all right, if I steep the
rest of my turtle in salt sea water."

A bright thought it seemed to him,
and he turned the spit faster than before.
His dinner proved very nice, and all he
wished for, was a bit of bread to eat with
it. This made him think of home, and
how often he had wasted a piece, because
not content with good, white, dry bread.
He went to look at the roots left in the
ashes. When put down they were quite
hard, and now the skin had parted, so as
to show the white, mealy stuff inside. The
smell tempted him to taste, and he found
it good, as well he might, for it was--a
potatoe! He was very thankful, for
these roots would serve him in the
place of bread.
He lay down to rest in the heat of the
noon-day, and began to plan for the next
piece of work. He could not yet build
the walls of his kitchen, for the bricks
were not dry. The best thing would be
to go out and try to kill a lama. But
how to keep the meat? " What if I
hang some of it up to dry in the smoke
of the kitchen?" Still, he had to wait
till the walls were built. " Why not try
to catch a lama alive," and then; " Oh!
if he could but tame it ?" Robinson
sought out his best piece of cord, made
a noose upon it, and put everything ready
to start at an early hour next day to the
wood, through which the lamas must _
pass, on their way to a stream of fresh
water.

When the air was cold, he went to
walk on the shore, to look over that Wide
ocean which rolled between him and his
parents. His thoughts were very sad.
" What are they doing now? How have
they borne the grief I caused them?"
He turned aside to lean against a tree near
the place. By way of comfort, he cuton _
its tender bark the names of his much-
loved father and mother, and pressed his
lips upon the words to kiss them.

He went down again to the beach,
thinkifg it might be as well to bathe.
He took off his clothes, and was ashamed
to see the ragged, dirty state, in which he
had worn them so long. He washed his
shirt and hung it on the tree to dry. He
could swim well, and tried to reach a
sand-bank some way off, to look about
for fish. He saw that he might ' often
catch some there, if he could make a
fishing net. He put on a clean shirt,

'
making a resolve that it should never be
in such a sad plight again. It was then
time to go home, and to bed.

Next day he set off early with some
roasted potatoes and a slice of turtle in his
. pouch. The cord for catching lamas was
tied round his waist, and with umbrella
in hand, he began his march. In the
wood he saw some parrots, and he sought
for a nest, in the hope of getting a young
bird to rear and tame. He could not
find a nest, but looking down between
the cracks of a rock, he saw something
white, lie on the ground. He let himself
down by his hands and feet, for he felt
ahnost sme that itwas some good, dry,salt.

It was a prize to him for sea-water has
a bitter taste, and it had been a great.
mistake of his to think that meat would
keep in a bowl of salt water. The salt
that is in the sea-water is good, but the
water is only kept pure and fresh by the
ever rest-less tide which comes and goes.
If let to stand, sea-water will soon be
bad, just like the rain-waterin our ponds
and ditches. It is the running stream ,
only, that is fresh and good to drink, and I
to use in cooking. '

Robinson had a long time to wait
before any lamas were seen, and then a
troup Qshed by, out _of reach. The last
of them had two young ones, and came
near him. Then he threw the cord and
noose, which caught and held the poor
thing so tight she could not move or
bleat, and the young ones staid beside
her. He patted the pretty little things,
and they licked his hands as if begging
him to let their mother'go free.

It was no easy matter to drag the

'
lamas home, and when there at last,
how was he to get her inside the cave?
She could not mount the rope-ladder, so
Robinson tied her to a tree until he could
make some sort of stable. He set to
work, and planted trees side by side, as
he had done at first for his fence,'but
stopped many times to look at the living
things that would now dwell with him.
He might use a little of the milk, and in
time make some butter and che& of it.
This would be a new store of food,
" against a rainy day." The spider was
quite tame now, and the lamas might be
so in a short time. The cocoa-nut shells
would do for pails and milk-pans. When
night came he lay down to rest, with a
mind full of busy thoughts how to weave

baskets for the lamas to carry, and so
fell fast asleep.
AN EARTHQUAKE, AND EIGHT WEEKS 0F
RAIN.

One night, while Robinson lay on his
bed of dry grass, he was waked out of a
sound sleep, for the earth shook, and a
strange noise was heard.

He started up in great fear, and ran
out-side the cave, not knowing where
to go.

A storm came on, which tore up trees,
and even rocks, and the roar of the sea
was very loud. 'No sooner had Robinson

left the cave, than a piece of rock fell
down upon his bed. He ran for his life,
and the lamas went with him to the
top of a hill, to get out of the way of
falling trees, but even there he did not
feel safe. He ran to the sea-side where
the scene was very awful. The clouds
seemed as if in a heap, one upon the
other. They burst by their own weight,
and the rain came down like a flood, the
land was soon under water.
' Robinson climbed up a tree, while his
poor lamas were washed along by the
force of the flood. He could hear them
bleat, but they were out of his reach for
help. The earth shook for a little time,
and then there was a dead calm.
Robinson had seen and felt an earth-
quake ! After awhile Robinson came
down from the tree. He was worn-out
with fear. He leaned against the stem
of the tree all night, for he dared notAN EARTHQUAKE. 61

stir, and could not sleep. His only
thought was, " What will become of
me? " At length day-light came, and
with it the bright sunshine. All things
looked pure and fresh.

Robinson was still almost stupid from
fear, and slowly went to look at the
ruins of his home. There he saw his
dear lamas safe and sound, and they
ran to meet him. He could hardly
believe his eyes, but they came up and
licked his hands.

Then he felt hope again, and shed
tears while he thought on the mercy
which had spared his life. The lamas
had been washed along, until they
rested on some high ground, Where they
stood, till the waters sank as fast as they
had risen, and very soon the lamas
found their way home.
When Robinson stood in front of his
cave, he saw that the piece of rock which
had fallen could be pushed away, and
his house would be much better than
before. It was his duty now to set to
work, and try to clear the cave of ruins.
The rock which lay in it, had broken in
two parts, but he could not move either
of them with his hands.

At last Robinson thought of the way
he had seen heavy casks moved about
the "streets, in the days of his idle life at
Exeter. He sought for a stout pole, and
put one end of it close under a piece of .
rock, and then pressed down upon the
other end of the pole with all his might.
Thus he made use of what we call a
lever. In half an hour the two pieces
of rock were rolled out of. the cave, and
as far as he could see, there was 'no
crack over-head. His roof was safe,
and he had now a larger room, much
more fit to dwell in. Besides this, the
earthquake had caused a wide hole near
to his cave which would serve for a
larder and store-house.

He went to look at the potato-field
and found all safe there, and he resolved
to plant some in other places, to give the
better hope for always saving a good
crop. Robinson's next care was, to try
and catch some more lamas with his
rope and noose. The flesh was hung up
in his kitchen to smoke--but first he let
it lie some days 1n salt, because he had
seen his mother do the same at home,
when she made bacon.

He still thought that winter would
come, and laid in a stock of wood for
fuel. He dug up all the potatoes he
could find, to store them up also. It
was hard work to cut grass enough to
make hay for the lamas. He made
a stack of it, but forgot to toss the
hay about, until quite dry. The hay-
cock began to smoke--he thrust in
his hand to feel the heat, but could
not think how the fire got there.

Robinson took down the hay-cock
as fast as he could, before the fire
burst forth, but the hay was spoiled.
He had now learnt a new lesson, "that
hay must be free from damp, to keep
it safe from fire, so he made a fresh
stack, and put a top to it with rushes,
to serve as thatch.

Robinson went one day to the lemon-
tree to get all its ripe fruit.

The cold of winter did not come, but
rain set in, and for weeks he could not
go out. The days and nights were long
and dreary, for he had nothing to do.
How he wished for the books that onCe
were thrown away--and what would he
not give now for the pens, ink, and paper,
so often wasted at school.

At last he began to think how to
make a lamp out of some clay which was
not far off. He did not mind a wetting
to get at it. He tried many times before
he could mould a shape to his mind, and '_
then set it near the kitchen fire to dry,
and after that he made some pots and
pans. Then he tried to weave a fishing-
net with his rough sort of pack-thread.
While doing this his mind was'busy, and
he thought how useful it would be to
make a bow and arrows. He could then
shoot birds for food, and defend himself

in case of need. He had no iron, but
1:
could use a fish-bone, or piece of flint in
the place of it, and the same would do
for the point of a lance or spear.

The clay-pots were now dry, and he
tried to use them. He took a lump of
fat from the lama meat, which he wanted
to melt, and use as oil for his lamp.
How sorry he was to see it drain out,
drop by'drop, from the pot. His hopes
of light from a lamp, and a hot basin of
soup were at end. " Why was it that
the jugs and pots at home did not soak
through?" At last he thought of it--
" they were glazed! How was it done?
Surely they were put into a great heat
to glaze?" He made a good fire, and
set his best pot in the midst, but alas!
crack it went--and split all to bits.
" Hey-day !" said Robinson, "who would
have thought it? What can be the cause
of this?" He tried again to bake a pot
gently, but still it was not glazed, and he
thought he must wait to build an oven
which might do better than the open fire.
The rain fell for eight weeks, and then
begun to clear up. Robinson - thought
the winter would set in, but it was past!
He saw the grass look fresh and green,
and fresh buds and flowers came forth
every dav. He went forth to his work
out of doors. Robinson was now well
off, but his spirit was sad--there was no
parent or friend to love him, and be loved
again. It was well for him that he was
forced to set about making some clothes,
for his own were quite worn out, and the
stings of a large gnat through every hole
in his dress, gave him much pain.
Robinson used often to stand on the

shore, and watch for a ship. At times
2-]:
he ' mistook a small cloud far off for a
ship in full sail, and when it did not
prove what he so prayed to see, the tears
fell as he went back to his home all
alone.

One day Robinson cut down a. tree,
and set it upright on the shore. He
took the last piece of his shirt to make a
flag that would flutter in the breeze, so
as to be seen, if a ship should ever pass
by the island.
ROBINSON'S NEW DRESS--HIS ILLNESS-
FOOT-PRINTS ARE SEEN.

Having set up his stafi' - and flag,
Robinson went home to take in hand the
trade of a tailor. He had stretched out
all the skins of the dead lamas, and dried
them in the sun. It cost' him much
time and pains to cut out a pair of shoes
and leggings with a piece of flint, and he
did not know how to sew. He made
small holes at the edges of the pieces of
skin, and laced them on to his legs and
feet with string. The hair was put out-
side. The skins were hard and stiff, and
made blisters on his feet, but this was
better than the sharp stings of great
gnats. One piece of skin, very stiff, but
a little bent, was made into a mask, with
two small holes for the eyes, and one for
the mouth--to breathe through. Three
pieces of skin made a jacket, two for the
arms and one for the body, and these
were joined by string. The trowsers
were made of one piece before and one
behind, laced up at the sides. When
done, he put them on, and laid by the
old clothes, all in rags as they were, but
still dear to his sight from thoughts of
I home, and he meant to wear them on the
birth-days of his father and mother.
. Robinson was a strange sort of figure in
his full dress. From head to foot he
wore a cover of skins with the hair out-
side. A large stone hatchet was slungaonmsou's NEW DRESS. 71

by his side. On his back a pouch--also
a bow and arrows. In his right hand a
spear, almost twice as long as himself.
His umbrella was like a basket up-side
down. The cap on his head had a point
at the top, it was made of rushes and
skin. No one could have taken him for
a man. He laughed out-right, when, on
the bank of a clear stream, he saw his
own image in the water.

When the tailor-work was done, he
thought of his oven, and built it with care,
to hold a strong fire, in which he set the
pots. They did not crack this time, and to
his joy he found one--but only one--was
glazed at the bottom. " Why was this?"
He could not guess, but at last it came I
into his mind that the glazed one had
held some salt, and a little of it might
have been left when the pot was put into
the fire. Next day he tried again--~he
washed some of the pots in salt-water,
and put dry salt in others.

In the midst of this busy work he
was taken ill. . . . . The aches
and pains in his head and limbs were so
bad that again he said to himself, " What
will become of me? No one to care for
me; no one to nurse me; I shall die all
alone!" He felt so ill and weak that he
could hardly crawl to fetch a cup full of
water, and get a lemon to put beside him
as he lay on his hard bed. The cold fit of
ague was upon him for two hours, and after
it the heat and thirst of its fever fit came
on, which was much the worst to bear.

After a time this went off, but left him
so weak that he could only crawl on
all fours to reach the fire and throw on
some wood, lest it should go out. HenIs ILLNESS. 73

could not sleep all night, and next day
was too ill to move. The fire went out,
but he did not know it; for he lay with-
: out sense or feeling. Many hours passed,
but at last Robinson drew a deep breath,
and opened his eyes. He felt very weak,
but the pain in his limbs was gone. He
had still to suffer from thirst, for he had
no water; but a lemon was left, and he
tried to suck the juice of it. This did
him good, and he fell asleep. When
Robinson woke, his lama stood close .
beside him. He tried to milk her, and
got a little, which he drank, and fell
asleep again. Next day he had strength
to crawl to the edge of the cave. He
felt the sweet air, and then arose in
him new hope of life and health. He
was still very weak, but patient and
thankful. Soon after this, Robinson was
able to get to the spring of fresh water.
To bathe in it, and drink milk was the
best way of cure. In a few more days, he
was able to go about. He looked into
his oven, and found his pots all right and
well glazed; but--he had now no fire.
He did not murmur; he thought over
the many comforts spared to him. He
had no wintry cold to dread, and he could
live upon milk and cheese and fruit, with
oysters now and then, and small shell-
fish. From this time his mind was taken
up with a new thought. How to build
a small boat? One day he went out to
seek for a large tree to cut down, that he
might hollow out the trunk of it. On'
the way he found some maize, or Indian
corn. He took away the seeds of it.
He also saw some young parrots, and
caught one of them. Robinson went
home with a happy mind, for he hoped
to teach the parrot to speak a few words.

Robinson now laid down a daily plan
for his work, so that he might make the
best use of day-light hours, and each day

he meant to work hard at cutting down
the tree for his boat.

Three years passed away, and the tree
was only out half way through, with so
poor a tool as the stone hatchet. About
this time he began to think it would be
well to make a tour of the island. In
truth he had not been brave enough to
go far from home for fear of meeting with
wild beasts. It might be safe to go
' along the shore.

He set all things in order, put a load
on the back of his lama, with food to
last four days, and set out on his travels.
He saw many fine trees quite new to him,
and went on until he came to what was
the south point of the island. In some
places the soil was sandy. He had .a
mind to walk along a sand-bank which
stretched far out into the sea. All at
once he started back and grew pale with
fear. He stood stock still, as if he had
been struck by a thunder-bolt. He saw
the fresh foot-prints of a man 1

Robinson had gained many wrong
notions when a child, and amongst them,
that all Indians are wild and cruel.
Robinson gave way to terror, and ran as
if a wild beast were at his heels. He
threw away his spear, and bow and
arrows. He ran for an hour, without
any thought of where he was going to,
and came round about to the same spot
from whence he had set out.

He forgot the place; had no idea that
he had seen it before, and ran from it
again.

So he went on, till he fell down with-
out sense or motion. Then his lama
overtook him, and lay down by his side.
It was the very ground on which
Robinson had thrown down his bow and
arrows. When he came to himself he could
not think why they lay there, for fright
had made him lose all common sense.

After a while he rose up, and tried to
go home, but his strength was wasted,
and he could not make haste. At night-
fall he was about two miles from his cave,
at a place he had fenced in as a park for
his young lamas, He lay down to rest
a little, when a voice in the air made him
start up again, but he did not rush off as
before. He was calm enough to hear
the words, " Robinson ! poor Robinson !
where have you been? How came you
here P" He found it was no voice in the
air, but the call of his own parrot, which
was perched on the branch of a tree close
by. No doubt the bird was tired of its
life alone in the cave, and as it had often
been in the park-field with its master,
had come to seek him there.

Fear was soon over this time.
Robinson put out his hand and called,
" Poll." The bird flew to him with its
one song of " Robinson, poor Robinson,
where have you been?"

Robinson could not sleep that night,
he thought of all that could be done for
defence from any attack oi' savage men.
He would spoil his pretty field,----throw
down the hedges and fences, and dwell only
in his cave. There should be no trace left
of a living man, on his side of the Island.
I INDIANS COME TO THE ISLAND--MAN
FRIDAY SAVED.

It was well that Robinson had so
much to do when he got back to his
cave, that he was tired out, and had a
night to rest, and sleep over his strange
thoughts, before he began to act upon
them. The mild air of a new day gave
a better tone to the state of his body
and mind, and he felt the folly of all
hasty schemes to destroy the many
things of use and beauty, which it had
been the labour and joy of years to raise
up around him. Robinson now saw that
his best plan would be to plant a
great many trees, so as to look like a
wood, and by that means hide his home.
Besides this, he thought of digging a way
from the back of his cave to the other
side of the rock, by which he might
escape, if there was need for it. For
this work he must give up the making
of his canoe for awhile. He laid in a
store of cheese, fruits, and oysters; these
he meant to change, and keep them
always fresh, for fear of a siege. In
the course of time his back-road was
made, and he again set to work for the
canoe. One fine, clear day, while busy
at the tree, he saw a thick smoke rise
some way off. He went to the top of
the hill, and then saw five or six canoes
come to land, and it was plain that some
of the men in them were captives. On
a sudden, one of these started up, and
fled swiftly towards the wood in front
of Robinson's cave. Two men ran after
him, but they were not so quick of
foot.

Robinson forgot all his timid fears,
and took a short way to meet the man
who seemed to be flying for his life. He
called out to him, " Stop! stop!" Upon
which, the other seeing so strange a
figure, took him for some thing more than
a man, and did not know what to do.
Robinson put out his hand to show that
he was a friend, and then threw his spear
at the Indian behind, who fell to the
ground. The second man shot an arrow
at Robinson, which would have killed
him, but for the thick skin of his jacket.
Robinson gave no time to do the same

again, but rushed upon his foe with such
1*
force, that he soon lay in the dust.
Robinson then turned to the Indian
whom he had thus tried to save, and
showed him by signs, that he would take
care of him. Robinson took off his
mask, and then the poor man saw that
a kind face had been hidden by that
rough out-side. The two Indians who

lost their lives were buried out of sight,
and Robinson went home that night
with a friend. They kept guard most
part of the night, but as all was quite
still, they at last laid down their bows
and arrows, and Robinson brought out
some supper. It was on a Friday that
this great event came to pass, and
Robinson gave the name of Friday to the
man whose life he had saved. The Indian
was a young man about twenty years
of age. In his ears he wore some
feathers and shells, which he seemed to
think very fine. Robinson tried to fit
Friday with a skin dress, and then they
were ready for a meal. Friday sat on
,the ground, while Robinson was on a
seat of turf; and thus we see Robinson
for the first time like a king in his island.
Friday was shown where to make a bed
for himself, While his master took care to
carry the bows and spear into his own
part of the cave.
LAUNCH OF THE BOAT--DISTRESS--
DANGER, AND SAFE RETURN.

Next day Robinson went to see if he
could find a spark of fire amongst the
ashes which the Indians had left. He
turned the ashes to and fro, but in vain;
it was too late. Friday saw his master
do this, and then go from the place with
sad looks. He made some signs, took
up the hatchet, and ran off into the
wood. Robinson did not know what
this meant; and his first thought was,
to go after Friday and punish him.
Robinson did not go far in his haste, forLAUNCH on THE BOAT. 85

Friday ran back faster than he went
away, holding a bunch of dry grass in
the air, which began to smoke, and then
was on fire. Friday had gone into the
wood to fetch two dry bits of stick which
he knew how to rub so as to be ready to
take fire. He then wrapped them up in
dry grass, and, moving with it quickly
through the air, the fire soon broke out
into a blaze. Robinson made a vow to
himself to be more just, and believe all
right till he found it wrong, that he
might never again think ill of Friday
without cause. Robinson caught up a
stick on fire, and ran with it to the
hearth-place near his cave, threw on more
wood, and. put some potatoes to roast.
Then he killed a young lama, put a joint
of meat on the spit, and showed Friday
how to turn it. While this went on,
Robinson ground some maize between
two flat stones, to make flour of it, which
he put with some pieces of meat into a
pot. This was filled with water, and
some salt thrown in, and the pot set
over the fire. He was going to make
soup, which he had not tasted for many
years. Friday knew what roast meat
was for, but he had never seen a pot
boil. When it began to bubble up,
Friday thought there was some live thing
in it, and put his hand in, to seize and
drag it out, for fear the food should be
lost.

In an instant Friday set up a loud
scream of pain. Robinson was just out-
side the cave, and his first thought was,
of the Indians, and how to save himself
by the new way under ground. His
next thought was a better one--more
brave and true. To save Friday, he ran
to him spear in hand, but found him all
alone, twisting about and making wry
faces. It was a long time before Robinson
could do any thing to give relief from
pain or to comfort the poor man, as they
could only talk by signs, and a very few
words.

The hot supper was quite to Robinson's
taste, but Friday 'could only nurse his
scalded hand.

Robinson did his best to teach Friday
words of English, and in six months
he could speak it pretty well. Then
Robinson asked his advice about the
canoe. Friday laughed to see how little

had been done with so much toil, and
showed Robinson how to hollow out

the wood of the tree with fire; but this
must be put off till the rainy season
88 ROBINSON CRUSOE.

was over. They had enough to do in-
doors. From the bark of trees Friday
could weave mats so soft and fine, they
were like linen cloth, and much better
for clothes than the raw hides which
Robinson had been obliged to wear.
Friday also made strong cord out of
the stringy cover of the cocoa-nuts, and
his fishing-nets were very firm and well
done. The weeks of rain did not seem
long or dull; for while they sat at work,
Robinson taught Friday to speak English.
When the sky was clear, they went out
to begin the boat. More was done for
it in two months than Robinson had
been able to do in two years. They
only wanted a sail, which Friday was to
weave, while Robinson made the oars.
The next thing was, to get the boat to
the sea-shore. This was done by means
of two round poles, put under each end
of the boat, on which it was rolled along.

In two days the boat floated on the
water.

Robinson had now his heart's desire,
and could speak of his joy to Friday.
" But where should they sail to?"
Friday wished to try and find his own
island, which Was not a great way off.
Robinson wanted to find the main-land,
which he thought must be some part of
South America; and if he c0uld get
there, ships would be more likely to pass
within hail, and take. them up.

The next day Robinson went out alone,
to think of all that had passed, and what
he had done since he came to that
Strange land, and how many comforts he
had now to be thankful for, on the once
dreary spot. _ He saw the clear lamas
feeding near, and he must leave them.
Poll flew to him, and rested on his
shoulder; it would be easy to feed Poll,
so the bird might go with them.

Friday was in haste to leave while the
tide was up, and it was well for Robinson
that he had no time to look back on
what he left behind. .

They went on board without delay.

Robinson had been nine years on his
island, and now set sail from it with a
fair wind and a fresh breeze.

They were not far out at sea when they
came upon a ridge of rocks. The force
of the water took them out of their course
with the sail up, and they soon lost sight
of land. They pulled in the sail, and
tried to row back, but they had no

steel, rubbed on a magnet to make itDANGER. 91

point north and south, and is kept in a
small 'box. By its help, sailors can safely
steer across the wide ocean. Robinson
and Friday had only sea and sky to look
upon, and the food in their boat would
last but four days.

RobinSon did his best to speak words
of good cheer to Friday. They put up
the sail again, and tried to get into
smooth water, and soon Robinson felt
sure he could see the hill-tops of his
island-home. Then he said to Friday,
" Come my friend, we are near the end
of our day's toil." The words were but
just spoken, when they both felt a great
shock, and were thrown from their seats
upon each other. The boat Was set fast,
and the waves broke over it.

Robinson soon got up, and made haste
to feel all round the boat with his oar.
The water was not more than two feet
deep, and he could feel a hard ground
beneath. He jumped into the sea, and
Friday did the same. They were glad
to find the boat had run upon a sand-
bank, and not upon a rock. They pushed
with all their might to free the boat from
the sand, and when once more afloat
they got into it again. The next thing
was, to bale out the water with their
hands, as well as they could. From this
time they were careful to use oars instead
of a sail, and so guide the boat more
surely.

Robinson saw they were now upon the
very same sand-bank on which his ship
had struck when he was cast ashore.
They were forced to row a very long way
round the bank, and it was hard work,
but the island was near them. They

reached it just at sun-set, and landed,
quite weary, but very thankful to be safe
from the perils of the sea. Having had
no food all day, they sat down on the
beach to eat a meal from the stores in the
boat. This done, they drew it up above
the water-mark, and went home to sleep
in the cave. Next day Robinson Spoke
first.

" Well Friday, will you go with me
once more and try our fate on the sea?"

FRIDAY.--" Oh no! dear master, pray
do not ask me."

ROBINSON.--" Then you are content
to spend all the rest of your days with
me upon this island?"

FRIDAY.--" Yes, if my father were here
to live with us."

ROBINSON.--" Is your father still .
alive?"
FRIDAY.--" Unless he has died since
I left him."

Then Friday wept sadly.

ROBINSON.--" Do not fear, Friday;
some day we will go and seek for your
father, and bring him here."

This news made Friday jump up, and
dance round his master for joy. His
heart was so full, he could not speak a
word.

It was then time to go to work, each
to his task. They dug more ground,
and sowed more maize, and went to catch
fish to dry, and lay up for store--then to
bathe, which they did twice a day.

Robinson had some fears about keeping
his word to Friday, and asked him, " If ,
the men on his island would be kind
to himself and to a strange guest, if he
went there?" Friday was quite sure itSAFE RETURN. 95

would be so, and they fixed to sail next
day. I They laid in a stock of food for
eight days, and went early to bed, to be
ready for a'start at sun-rise.
A STORM--SHIP IN SIGHT--THE WRECK--
THE RAFT--FRIDAY SAVES THE LIFE OF
HIS MASTER.

Robinson and Friday might have been
asleep about half an hour, when they
were both roused up at once by a clap of
thunder. The noise of the wind was
very loud, but Robinson thought he
heard the sound of a gun a great way
off.

Friday said it was thunder, but
Robinson knew the sound of a great gun
fired by ships in distress. They went
out, and lit a fire on the top of the hill,
for a sign to any ship in sight. Soon as
the blaze was up, a storm of hail and rain
came on and put it out, which forced
Robinson, much against his will, to go
back with Friday to the cave, for fear of
a flood.

Ten times he ran out to try and light
the fire again, and as often the rain put
it out. By day-light the storm was over,
and they went down to the sea-side.
Poor Friday! The first thing he saw
was the boat out of reach--washed away,
and far out at sea. -

He wept as if his heart would break.
Robinson tried to soothe him, and said,
'_' who knows but this storm may have
done us some great 'good." " What
good? " said Friday in a sharp tone,-
" it has taken the canoe from us, that is
al ." " Nay," said Robinson that is not

all, we might have gone out in the canoe
a
and so have lost our lives." Canoe is
the Indian word for boat, and means,
" the hollow trunk of a tree."

Robinson went from hlll to hill to see
the shore on every side, for he could not
rest while he thought a ship might be in
sight--and there was one--far ofl'
indeed, but still, no doubt, a ship, and
of large size.

Robinson shouted to Friday "come!
come ! There they are! quick, quick l"

Friday thought he was to see canoes
full of the men who had used him so
badly, and held back in great fear.

Robinson showed him the new sight
of a ship.

They made a great fire, which now
blazed well.

Robinson kept his eye on the ship,
hoping to see a boat put out--but all inSHIP IN SIGHT. 99

vain. After waiting along time, Friday
said he would swim to the ship, though
it was so far off. Robinson let him go.
Friday took off his dress of matting--
broke off a green bough from a tree,
which he held between his teeth, and
sprang boldly into the waves. The
green branch is a sign of peace with all
the Indian tribes of men. He got to
the ship and called out, but no one
heard him. Seeing a ladder by the
ship's side he went up it, with the
branch in his hand. When he was high
enough to look all over the deck he took
fright, for there was a beast he had
never seen before. It had black hair,
and made a noise he did not like. Its
face was not fierce, and it kept wagging
its tail as it drew close to him. For the

first time in his life Friday patted a dog.
G 2
Then he got on deck and saw many
other things-quite new to him, but not
one man could be found. All at once
Friday felt a blow upon the back, and
fell flat on his face. He got up and
saw a beast of large size, with crooked
horns, and a long bushy beard, reared
up on its hind legs, ready to strike at
him again. Friday shouted as loud as
he could, and jumped into the sea. The
dog jumped in after him, and Friday,
who dared not look behind, thought it
was the beast with horns, and could
hardly swim from fear. When he
reached the shore, he fell down quite
faint. Robinson did all he could to
revive his friend, but it was some time
before Friday could speak, to tell of
What he had seen, and of the monster
with horns that was master of theTHE WRECK. 101

ship. Robinson, guessed that Friday
had seen a goat -- but what had
become of the crew? Had they been
lost in their boats, or thrown on some
other island in the ocean? What
could be done? It would take too
much time to make a new boat, and
Robinson could not swim so far.
There was only one way left. They
could tie the stems of some trees side
by side, and so make a raft, which
would float out with the tide, and be,
washed back by 'it. The dog was
made welcome, and that night lay
down to sleep at their feet.

A raft was made in one day, and
when the tide came in at day-break,
they got upon it, and very soon
Robinson set foot on board a ship
from Europe. He swam round it, and
saw that it would never move again;
It was set fast between two rocks,
and would be washed to pieces by
the dashing waves at high tides.
Friday did not like to go on board
the ship again, but he was too brave
to leave his master, and then saw
that the beast with horns, was tame
enough. It could not now rise on its
legs, being very weak from want of
food.

Robinson found good stores in the
ship, of far more worth to him than
the lump of gold which still lay, of
no use, near his cave.

There were casks of biscuits and
flour, besides other food--tools of all
kinds, and a. chest full of clothes.

They had not time to save everything,
so he chose what would be of most use.THE RAFT. .103

It was no easy matter to do this. What
joy it gave him to find some books, paper,
pens and ink, also a tinder-box, with
matches, flint and steel. The raft was
laden, but he could not bear to leave the
goat to starve and die, so room was made
for it, and everything was tied fast on the
raft to bear tossing about on the water.

They left many things, but the tide
waits for no man, and without it they
could not reach the shore.

At supper-time Robinson gave Friday
a knife and fork, and showed him how to
use them. At first he could not guide
the meat to his mouth--it was apt to go
off to his ears.

They were in haste to pile up their
goods in safety, and then, to make Friday
stare, his master went behind a bush, and
soon came forth in the dress of an officer,
with shoes and stockings, all right.
Friday started back; but Robinson held
out his hand, and then gave him a sailor's
dress to put on, and it was hard work to
fit himself into it._ He liked everything
but the shoes, which he could not walk
in. thile Friday was busy with the
buttons of his jacket, Robinson loaded a
gun and fired at a sea-gull which fell dead
at his feet. Poor Friday! Fear almost
took away his senses ; but Robinson
told him that with the gun they were
safe, even if many men came from other
islands to make war upon them, and their
home of peace.

Robinson and Friday made many trips
to the ship, and brought away the most
useful things. They did not care for a
cask of gold dust, so it was left with a
box of bright and rare stones.
When at last Robinson saw so many
comforts around his cave, he began to
blame himself for having left the gold-
- dust which might some day be sought
for, if the captain of the ship or any of
the crew were saved, after the storm
which drove the ship between the rocks.

He made a trip to fetch the gold-dust
and stones. The next care was to put
all his gun-powder in a place quite safe
fromrain or fire.

One night Robinson lighted his lamp
to look over the papers found in the ship,
but he could not read them, for they
were not written in English. Again he
had to grieve for the waste of time in
young days at school, when he would not
learn French, His sorrow now, was too
late. He could only make out that the
ship came from Africa, with 100 slaves
on board, and was bound for some place
in the West Indies, where the slaves would
be sold.

Robinson told Friday all this, and said,
" Who knows but the poor slaves were
made free by the storm that caused the
ship to strike? Perhaps some of them
are safe on an island and may now live
in peace P" Friday thought it might
be so.

"Well then, my friend," said Robinson,
" you must see that some good has been
done by the storm that washed away
our canoe."

Robinson took great care of the papers,
for he hoped some day to make out the
person to whom he might give back the
gold-dust and stones, saved from the
wreck. In six days they went to and fro
on the raft to pick up all they could fromFRIDAY SAVES ms MASTER'S LIFE. 107

the ship. They did not watch for the ,
signs of a storm, which came on with a
gale, and made the cords of the raft give
way. Friday could swim to land.

Robinson lost his breath, and would
have sunk to rise no more, but Friday
caught hold, and used all his strength to
reach the shore with his master's body.

Friday laid him on the sand and rubbed,
till Robinson opened his eyes, and, in a.
weak voice, said, " Where am I?" " In
my arms, dear master," said Friday, with
tears in his eyes. Robinson could not
thank him enough, and his poor friend
was almost wild with joy to see him come
to himself again.
INDIANS ARE SEEN AGAIN--THE FIGHT--
FRIDAY FINDS HIS FATHER.

A night of good rest in a tent, and
on a bed saved from the wreck, made
Robinson feel quite well again, and he
rose up very thankful for his life and
health.

Robinson now dressed himself like a
sailor, to save his best clothes. He made
a harness of rope for the dog, that it

might help to draw some of their goods

to the cave. Robinson had seven lamas,
and they could each bear a load.

A store-house was wanted, and with
good tools, it did not take long to build
one strong enough and water-tight.

They had all that two men could
want, and yet at times Robinson felt sad.
They were shut out from the rest of the
world, and one of them would some day
be left to die alone. Six months passed
away, and Robinson began to think of
making a new boat, to go in search of
Friday's father.

Friday was out on the shore looking
for turtle, when he came back out of
breath, and could but just say, " Here
they are! Here they are! " " Who?
What?" said Robinson.

" Oh, master, one----two----three------six
canoes." ' .

Robinson ran to the top of the hill.
It was too true; there were six canoes '
full of Indians ready to land.
Robinson asked Friday " If he would
stand by him and do his best?" " Yes,"
said he, "so long as I live." "Then,"
said Robinson, " do not fear, though this
is not the time to talk, we must act.
They went out each with a gun and
sword, and drew a great gun to a place
where it could be fired over the heads
of the Indians. Friday went near to
watch them, and said, he could see a
white man with a beard, and they were
going to kill him. Robinson fired off
the great gun, and the Indians fell back,
as if they had all been shot at once.
Some ran to the canoes, but others took
up their bows and arrows. These set
up a loud shout, and began their war-
dance with fierce cries. They laid hold
of the white man. Robinson fired his
gun, Friday did the same. Five menTHE FIGHT. 111

fell, and others were hurt. The rest ran
away at first, but soon came back, as
if ready to fight. Robinson and Friday
fired again, and more men fell. Then
Robinson burst his way through the
bushes, and with his knife cut the bonds
of the White man, whose hands and feet
were tied. He spoke to him in English,
but the reply was a word or two in
Latin, that he came from Spain, and was
a Christian. Robinson took a pistol
from his belt, and gave it him with a
sword. The man flew at his foes, and
they were soon driven off.

Friday and the Spaniard wished to
get into a canoe left behind, and go after .
the Indians, but Robinson would not let
them. He said, " It is enough, we have
shed their blood; let those live who'
have done us no harm." Friday said,
" If we let them go free, they will bring
back many more."

Two canoes were left behind, and in
one of them lay an old Indian, tied
hand and foot, more dead than alive.
Robinson made haste to cut the cords
which bound him, and tried to raise him

to give help, than he was like a man out
of his senses. He ran to the old Indian,
took him in his arms, and began to cry
and laugh by turns, then to jump and
dance about in a strange way.

At last he said, " It is my father." He
sat down and pressed close to his father
to try and give him warmth; then rubbed
the joints of his arms and legs, which
were sadly swelled by the tight bonds.
He kissed his father again and again. i
Robinson asked if he had any food
for his father. " No," said Friday, "the
greedy one (and he pointed to himself)
had eaten it all." Robinson gave up
his own breakfast for the poor man, on
which his son ran off, and before the
master could say, " Where are you
going?" Friday was out of sight. He
came back at a slow pace, with a jug of
water in one hand, and a basket full of
the best food he could find, for his
master. The cold water was a blessing
to the old man, who was faint With thirst.
The Spaniard lay upon the grass; he
strove to rise, but was not able from
'pain in his arms and legs, and loss of
blood in the fight. Friday sat down to
bathe, and rub his limbs as he had done
those of his father, whom he watched
all the time. Friday was to row his,

a
father in a canoe to the best place for
taking him up to the cave, and then to
do the same for the Spaniard. They
were both laid upon beds of fresh hay.
Supper was made ready, and then it was
found out that the Spaniard knew some
of the words which Friday and his father
spoke to each other. Thus Friday could
learn how the crew of the ship had
reached his own island, and were kindly
used, till other tribes made war upon
them, when the old man and his white
guest were made captives at the same
time.

The ship had been sent out from
Spain, and the gold dust was due to one.
of her owners. An Englishman was
going back in the ship, but he died.
and had prayed them to give up tne
stores to his widow.
A NEW SHIP SEEN--ITS HISTORY--ROBIN-
SON LEAVES THE ISLAND--HIS VOYAGE '
--HE ARRIVES AT EXETER.

The next day it was needful to bury
the dead.

Robinson gave the name of Thursday
to the old Indian, and then asked advice
of his three friends how to save the rest
of the white men.

The plan was, for Thursday and the
Spaniard to go and fetch them. Poor
Friday could hardly make up his mind to
part with his father, though it was for the,
best.

112
A Week past by, when Robinson, who
was always on the watch, saw a new ship,
which sent out a boat, and as it drew
near, he felt sure the men were English
sailors. His heart beat fast--but surely,
some thing was wrong--he waited, and
saw three men put on shore and left there.
They were bound and could not move.
The other men went away.

Robinson went up to the three men
left on the shore, and spoke, " Who are
you 5'" They all started at the sight of
him. He soon learnt that one was captain
of the ship then in sight. The crew were
many of them bad men, who had seized
upon their officers, and meant to leave
them on the island to starve. Once
more free, the captain and his mates,
laid a plan, with help from Friday, to
regain the ship and punish the' sailors.
Robinson was to stay in the cave, but he
could take no rest.

When day-light came, he went to the
top of the hills. No ship could be seen.
To lose it was almost more than he could
bear. In an hour he heard voices, and
Friday came back with the captain. All
was right, and the ship at anchor on the
other side of the island in a fine bay.

Friday went away, leaving the captain
with Robinson, but soon brought news
to them that his father was coming
with more White men--and off again
went Friday to meet his father on the
shore.

The white men proved to be sailors
from the ship that came from Spain, and
who wished to stay on the island, if
Robinson would give them, leave. _

This he agreed to, on their promise to
live in peace when he was gone away.
He would give up to them all his stores,
and only choose out a few things to take
home--these were--the dress of skin he
had worn, his umbrella, spear, bow and
arrows, the stone hatchet, Poll, two
lamas, and the dog, the gold. dust and
lump of gold, also the box of rare stones.

All these were put on board the English
ship, and at sun-set Robinson went to
the hill-top for the last time--alone. He
spent an hour there, and came back to
those who had need of his care, with a
heart and hand, ready to do good to every
one.

The time came to go on board.
Thursday and Friday would not leave
him.

The wind was fresh and bore them
fast away. ' ' 'ROBINSON LEAVES THE ISLAND. 119

Robinson stood on deck with his eyes
fixed on the spot where he had lived for
twelve years, and which was now almost
as dear to him, as the land of his birth.

They had a fair voyage to Cadiz in
Spain, where Robinson found the owner
of the gold-dust, and saved him from
great distress,

From Cadiz they set sail for England.
Poor old Thursday fell ill, and no care
could save him. He died--to the great
grief of his son. The two lamas died
soon after, for they could not bear the
life on ship-board.

In course of time the ship reached
Portsmouth, where Robinson sought for,
and found the widow who was to have his
box of rare stones. She was poor, and her
children in great want. Robinson gave
them their own, and was glad at heart to
see them rejoice. He then set sail
with Friday in a small ship bound for
Plymouth. A storm came on, and they
were wrecked. No lives were lost, but

all besides. The lump of gold was gone.

He had nothing left but his dog, which
swam, and the bird that flew after him

to the shore. A poor fisherman picked
up the umbrella and dress of skins, and
these were brought to him.

Thus Robinson went into Plymouth,
poor as he left it, but a wiser and a
better man. He and Friday got on the
top of a coach for Exeter. His mother
was dead, but his father was still living,
and when they met, " Oh, my father,"
" My dear son," was all they could say.
Friday had so much use for his eyes that
he could not speak at all.

The news of Robinson Crusoe's returnHE Annrvns AT EXETER. 121

spread through the city of Exeter. His
father's house was full of people all day
long, who came to hear and tell the
strange story of his life.

Robinson and Friday were not idle.
They could work as carpenters, and thus
earned their bread.

One day in each week was set apart
to live as they used to do on their island,
so far at least as it could be done.

They were always ready to give a
helping hand to those in need. They
lived to old age in health and peace.

" One by one thy duties wait thee,
Let thy whole strength go to each;
Let no future dreams elate thee,
Learn thou first what these can teach.

In the year 1859, the " Golden
Rocket," with 55 passengers on board,
was on her course from Boston to
California.

Getting short of water, the captain
was obliged to steer for Juan Fernandez,
that island being nearly in his track. It
is on the west coast of South America.

While the crew were busy rolling their
water-casks to and from the shore, some
of the passengers set off to ramble about
the island. They found that the land
rose high above the sea, and the tops
of the hills were over-hung with
clouds.

The valleys were full of grass, grown
to the height of six or eight feet. '

Fig, peach, and cherry trees were seen,
and plenty of strawberries.

The " Golden Rocket " lay at anchor
in March, the season for peaches, and
took in a store of them, for the trees on
every hill-side were laden with ripe fruit.

Three great caves were found, in which
fourteen people had made a home, like so
many hermits, apart from the world.

Robinson Crusoe's abode was on the
other side of the island, and such a steep
hill to cross that no one was bold enough
to make the trip, for fear of being left

behind.
'Goats ranabout all over the island,
and the deep sea around it was full' of
fish.

Pure water ran down in streams from
the rocky hills, the tops of which could
never be seen, owing to their cap of
clouds.

" As the fresh rose-bud needs the silvery shower,

The golden sunshine, and the pearly dew,
The Joyous day with all its changes new,

Ere it can bloom into the perfect flower,

So with the human rose-bud; from sweet airs
Of heaven will fragrant purl be caught,
And influences benign of ten er thought

Inform the soul, like angels, unawares."--MABY Howrrr.
