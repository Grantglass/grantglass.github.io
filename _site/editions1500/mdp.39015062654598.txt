Twenty Designs—All Different
The Complete Story of Robinson Crusoe
in Silhouettes
 
HESE twenty silhouettes together with the
captions to each picture give a complete
account of the famous Robinson Crusoe story.
1 These silhouettes are very simple, carefully
drawn, and well printed, being especially designed
for the use of children. They are excellent patterns
for free hand paper cutting, tearing and pasting, for
poster patterns, and for patterns for brush and ink
drawing. The judicious use of these pictures will
materially increase the interest in the reading of this
great story. These silhouettes are well adapted for use
in connection with reading and language work as
patterns for making silhouettes to illustrate original
Robinson Crusoe books made by the pupils.

Robinson Crusoe lived in England* He left his English home, and
sailed away in a great ship far over the ocean. The ship was wrecked and
Robinson Crusoe swam to an island.
Robinson Crusoe was all alone on the island. The waves tossed the
wrecked ship near the land. Crusoe swam to the ship. He made a raft
on which he took food and tools to the island. He made a tent out of the
ship's sails.
Robinson Crusoe wanted a chair and a table. He made them from
boards he took from his raft. They were very queer looking, but they were
strong and he could use them.

From trees Robinson Crusoe cut big posts and made a strong wall
around his tent. He did not have a door. He was afraid of wild animals.
He made a ladder to use in place of a door.
Robinson Crusoe shook out a little bag he took from the ship. A few
grains of barley fell on the ground. This grew and raised seed which
Crusoe sowed.

When the barley was ripe Robinson Crusoe had to cut it with a sword.
The sword was one that had been on the ship. It was a queer tool for cut-
ting a crop of barley, but Robinson Crusoe had nothing better.
Robinson Crusoe made a calendar from a post. Every day he cut a
notch in the post with his^ knife. Then he could always tell how long he had
been away from his English home.
Many kinds of fruit grew there, and how thankful Robinson Crusoe was
to find the fruit! He could have fruit to eat now, and how good it was.

Robinson Crusoe hung the grapes upon the trees where the sun was
shining* He knew the sun would dry the grapes through. When they were
dried they would make good raisins.

Robinson Crusoe found a parrot. "I can teach the parrot to talk to me,"
he thought, "and I can talk to the parrot." The parrot learned to talk, and
Robinson Crusoe was very happy.
Robinson Crusoe took a piece of hard wood, and shaped it like a big
dish. He burned out the inside with fire, and he shaped the outside with his
ax and his hatchet.

Robinson Crusoe made a cap, jacket, and breeches from goat's skin.
He made an umbrella and covered it with skin. He looked very queer with
his new suit and new umbrella.
For many months and years Robinson Crusoe lived quietly upon the
island. But one day, as he (walked near the water, he saw.the print of a
foot in the sand. It was the print of a man's foot. Robinson Crusoe was
frightened.
Friday tried to tell Robinson Crusoe that he would be his servant, but
he could not talk the white man's language. He put his head on the ground,
then he put Robinson Crusoe's foot on his head.
