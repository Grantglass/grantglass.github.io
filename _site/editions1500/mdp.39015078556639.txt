ROBINSON CRUSOE.
PREFACE.
[THE fact was, they, meaning J. Spraggles and his fellow-students
at TICKLETOBY'S, had lost the only printed copy of De Foe's won-
derful story that had ever been seen in that part of the world.
J. S. was not the smartest boy there, but he was the oddest and
best natured; given to story relating, and moreover, in the opinion
of his schoolmates, a great genius with his pencil. So, one winter
evening, when they found themselves shut in from the busy world,
alone, and at leisure from their tasks, he was entreated, nem. con.r
to tell the story of Robinson Crusoe, from memory.
His words, and the drawings with which he eked out his
description of the daring .navigator's adventures are as follow: ]
ROBINSON CRUSOE, you see, was the son of a merchant in
York, England. His father meant him for a merchant like him-
self; but Robinson, I guess, had been reading books of travels
and adventures; books of shipwrecks, and icebergs—of burning
mountains, and waterspouts and things. I guess too, he had been
to the circus and seen the jolly Jack Tar in his daring hornpipe act
on the back of a spirited Arabian charger; or else to the museum
to witness Black Eyed Susan, or Captain Cook. Anyhow, he would
go to sea, and go to sea he did. Didn't he get served out ?—hold
on and you'll see.
Well, he went on a voyage. You'll excuse my not recollecting
the names of all the places he went to, or all the people he met in
his first voyage. It aint material. And the best part is where he
gets to a certain uninhabited island in the Pacific ocean. (Here
an impatient little student interrupts things with the request " Oh,
do Jim tell us that part first.") No, no, Johnny, wait awhile *
everything in its turn. First let me tell you Robby had no sooner
got in a storm than he began to be sorry he went. The waves
rolled high as mountains. The thunder and lightning scared him
above a bit. He thought, every time the ship went up sky hign
onto the top of a wave, that he was going to the bottom. Oh, says
Robinson, this storm has been sent as a punishment for me. Why
didn't I stay home and be a merchant? If ever (says he) I get
home again, please the L—d, I'll be a merchant right away, and
never, never, never, want to go to sea again.
Perhaps it was real sorrow for having disobeyed his papa that
made him say this, and perhaps it was only scariness. It don't
matter. By and by, the storm ceased, and the ship was steady.
But a second storm arose; and this time the ship went down. R.
C. was saved in a boat and went to London. From there he went
to sea again, to the gold coast with a Captain in the Guinea trade.
Guineas, boys, are currency in England, where they don't have
greenbacks. So the Guinea trade was some, I tell you. But here
Robinson was again unlucky, and he and the ship's crew were
taken prisoners by the Algerine pirates and sold for slaves.
Now we come to the bully part. Rob he soon cuts off from the
pirates' land and gets to sea again. This time it was a West India
trader that he went with. I believe the vessel went there—but it
also went to some other places—as you will see. But the place of
all places it went to, in the end, was near an uninhabited island—
where he met Friday and shot the black savages, who were going
to eat him after roasting, besides dancing a break-down around his
quivering remains, all stuck full of arrows. But that comes after-
wards. (The before-noticed impatient student here again interpo-
lates the query "Will it be long before you come to that part ? ")
No, not long, Johnny. Don't you be too fast.
Here in this picture you see him climbing the cliffs of the
island. The ship has only a part of its mast sticking out of the
water. The sun is sinking too. Those birds and goats I put in
here as there is a good deal about them further on, and I thought
I would introduce them now.
Well poor Crusoe, you can bet, didn't feel good the first night
or two of his sleeping upon the uninhabited island. But then he
had little time for reflection. The punkeys were about; and then
he had to scare up something to live upon. So he casts about, up
and down the beach, and picks up peanuts and clams enough to
keep him alive. Then he sits down and considers. There is the
wreck which the tide has left high and dry. "Probably," says
Robinson to himself—he had nobody else to say it to,—" there is
something left in the old ship that might help towards house fur-
nishing, supposing I have to stop here and live." But how to get
to the wreck. It was over a mile from low-water mark. "Say,
Robinson," says he—always to himself mind you, for as yet he
hadn't Friday to talk to,—" say, Robinson, you had better try and
fix up something of a raft, and on that make a voyage to the
wreck." Yes, but how? R. C. had no tools to make a raft with.
He concluded then to swim off to the wreck and fetch away any
odd tools that might Remain, with as much wood and rope and
such like notions as would make one.
Well, after some trouble he got together a raft, such as you see
I have drawn in the next picture. When he reached the wreck
the first time, with his raft, Robinson was a bit put to it, what to
take and what to leave: for his raft wasn't much of an affair,
Robby being but a poor carpenter, never having done anything in
that way before, except a little whittling, perhaps, at times. It,
the raft, might upset in the water, and then he would have all his
trouble for nothing. So he put onto it a few necessary things,
just enough to begin housekeeping, with some biscuits, some rum,
a barrel of gunpowder, all the ammunition he could collect, besides
boards, ropes, clothes, and the balance of the ship's treasure—a
biggish pile of guineas. This money, to be sure, wasn't of much
use to him just then; he could have no occasion for it in such a
place. There were no stores to spend it at, he had no rent to pay,
nor taxes. There wasn't even a savings bank to put it in. Any-
how he took it, there being no other owner for it, and he thought
it would be a shame to leave it for the fishes to swallow.
After getting these things upon his raft, and steering it to
land, Robinson next cast about for a place to build himself a
hut in.
There were plenty of vacant lots, to be sure, but the thing was
to find one that was well away from storms and danger, not too
near nor too far from the sea-shore. He had had some experience
of storms you know, and didn't want to be caught suddenly by a
tornado and whirled like a dried leaf up into the air, nor did he
want to be woke up in the night to find himself floating out to
sea like another little Moses in the bulrushes. At length he
pitched upon a spot and began in earnest to fix up. He drove
stakes into the ground to form an enclosure, then he boarded this
round, all the time finding it hard to do carpentering without the
right sort of tools. The fact is, he broke down more than once,
and had to go many times to the wreck for materials. One day he
found some nails, another day he happened upon a grindstone;
but it was many weeks before he had anything to grind upon it,
his first hatchet being only a wooden one made by himself out of
a hard-tree stump.
It took Robinson a long time, you may guess, before his hut
was fit to live in. Glad enough he must have been to have
it finished. Before then he had to sleep in a hole in the rocks
or in hollows of trees, or under a pile of barrels and awnings;
terribly afraid of wild beasts, reptiles, and, for what he knew,
horrid savages. For remember he had not yet explored the
island, and was far from certain as to his being the only man
upon it.
Then the earthquake—but stop, that did not happen till after
he had moved into his hut. I can't say whether it was on a First
of May that this took place. Anyhow, Robinson found it real hard
to do the moving in without a cart or a man to help him, espe-
cially with the big things. At last, however, he began to get fixed
up—sort of comfortable, leastways as much so as he could expect
under the circumstances, seeing he had neither chair, nor table,
nor bedstead, nor bureau. How he made these afterwards, I shall
explain to you, if I don't forget.
But it was time now to go out and look about the island, to
see if there really were no other human beings; also to try and
shoot something good to eat. Robinson took two guns with him
and a good sharp sword, and went along cautiously at first, you
may guess.
Well, he saw nobody that time, and shot only a young goat or
two, which he cooked afterwards and eat.
I have drawn a picture of this shooting excursion, such as I
fancy it must have been. The goats are scared, naturally, for you
know they had never before heard the report of a gun, and possi-
bly didn't quite know what it meant.
They learned that bit of science, however, pretty soon, for
Robinson went out shooting nearly every day from that time.
Talking of time, reminds me of what Robinson did to keep count
of the days and the weeks. He set up a post, and for every day
that passed he made a notch with his knife. In this way he knew
when Sunday came round; and always took care upon that day
to refrain from work as far as possible and to stay indoors and
read prayers.
One day a terrible earthquake came. Do you know what an
earthquake is? Well, I see you all know. It knocked things
about and nearly destroyed poor Robinson's hut. So he bethought
himself of building a safer place to hide in; the more so as his
store of gunpowder was always liable to be blown up by light-
ning or other causes. He set to work again, and this time dug
himself a cave in the earth; a sort of big sub-cellar, rather dark,
but safer as a store than his hut. To this cave he carried his
powder and the things he most wanted to keep out of harm's way.
You see he was never sure of being quite alone upon the island,
and by and by you will learn that he was right to have doubts
about that.
I ought to mention, before I forget, how Robinson Crusoe took
to farming. It was by a sort of accident. He had brought from
the wreck a bag of bird seed, which had been put on board to
feed chickens with. This had got wet, and Robinson concluding
that it was spoiled, threw it over the fence of his hut. Lucky for
him it was he did that. Among the seeds thrown away were
some barley and com seeds; and these after a time sprung up.
and bore a good crop. Now Robinson, when he saw this, was
wonderfully glad. He carefully gathered the ears of barley and
wheat, and when the proper time came round planted them, and
in the end raised a good harvest.
There will not be time to tell you how Crusoe made a boat to
go cruising about the bays and creeks in; how his clothes wore
out and he had to turn tailor and make himself a new suit; and
that, mind you, not out of cloth, or calico, but out of the only
other things he had, goats' skins and birds' feathers. How he fell
sick and had no doctor, nor medicine; how when he got over his
fever and ague, he had the blues real bad, and was light-headed
and saw visions and much more of that sort. How from talking
much to himself, his parrot learned to talk, and one day when
poor Crusoe was out in the woods, it scared him above a bit by
calling him by his name. How the parrot came to learn his name
I forget, and can't guess, unless it was that it saw it painted upon
his poor master's trunk.
We come now to the part where, after having been some years
in his island, walking one day upon the sea-shore, he saw the
print of a man's foot in the sand. Just fancy, all this time he had
been living as though there was no man upon it but himself, and
here was a foot-print. Robinson jumped as though he had seen a
ghost.
He didn't stay long to examine the mark. Off he cut, right
home. Why? you say; perhaps Crusoe didn't know why himself.
He was just scared, that was all. It was what he had not looked
for. He ran home, as I said to his hut, and bolted and barred
himself in, right away. Was he sorry then that there were, per-
haps, other people besides himself upon the island? At first I
suppose he hardly knew whether he was glad or sorry. He sat
thinking and thinking all that day about it, and at last he went to
bed and dreamt of it. He says in his book, that what scared him
most was, not that it might be the foot-print of a man, for he
could not tell how any MAN could have got there without his know-
ing it, but that it might be the foot-print of .
Don't look so scared, you Dick, I shan't mention any bad
names. Robinson took in earnest to his prayer-book, and read it
from end to end before he was quite himself again. Then he de-
termined to go out and have another look at the foot-print, "for,"
said he, "it may be only fancy, perhaps it was no foot-print at
all;" or perhaps, only one of my own steps when I came first
ashore.
So, after keeping indoors for three days and nights, and getting
nearly starved to death, R. C. went out once more and proceeded
cautiously to the beach; this time looking sharply around him to
see if there were any more things of the same sort. But he found
none. There was the foot-print, and measuring it, to make sure
that it was not one of his own, he found it several sizes larger than
any boot he had ever worn.
/
Robinson Crusoe then went back to his hut and set to work to
fortify it; thickening its walls with stumps of trees, putting up
double doors, making port-holes to shoot through and all that.
In fact, his fear was, that what human beings were likely to be
there, were not such as himself, fellows who had been brought up
respectably, and read their Bibles and prayer-books, but horrid
pagan savages, man-eaters; running about naked, may be, and as
black as your hat. So, after making his hut as strong as he could,
he set about finding a more secure place for his flock of goats.
He took long walks into the back part of the island and at last
found the sort of place he wanted. But I must now tell you of
another scare poor Crusoe got.
He was prospecting, as we may say, one day, among the rocks
and caves of his island, still scarey and nervous about the black
savages, that, for aught he knew, might be prowling around under
the trees, when he found his way into a cavern.
He had never seen this before. It was a dark place, narrow at
its mouth and wider as you got in. Crusoe crept along, at first
upon his hands and knees, then upon his toes, feeling his way
cautiously with his hands. All at once he sees something away
back in the dark—two great, round, storey eyes. Yes, two bright
flaming lights. What could this be? May be, thought Crusoe,
this is the fellow who made the foot-print on the sand. However,
lie would not be beaten this time. So he got a light, and was
about to go further ahead, when he heard a deep sigh, or moan,
like that of a man or animal in pain. Never mind, thought
Crusoe—though he felt all his hair stand on end—I'm going to see
what this is about anyway; and go he did.
Look at this picture here. You see what it was. There was a
very old goat that had managed to get into the cave and hadn't
found strength enough to get out again. ^
Robinson was glad it was no worse. He tried to get the old
goat out of the cave, but it was of no use. The old thing had
lived long enough to suit it, and so died peaceably the next day.
This sort of life was led by poor Crusoe for near upon twenty
years. I dare say you boys (said J. Spraggles) have many times
thought to yourselves, when you've heard tell of Robinson Crusoe
and his island, "Oh, wouldn't it be real bully to go to sea and get

landed on a desert island, and build a hut, and shoot goats, and
have a Man Friday, and all that;" but (continued J. S.) do you
know, I think you wouldn't like it after all. You'd find it dull to
be twenty years without seeing anybody else; and you'd do what
Robinson did, in his book. I mean, you would look upon it all as
a punishment sent him for not staying at home and doing what
his father wanted him to.
[Here several of J. Spraggles' hearers yawn and show symptoms
of sleepiness—so he thus resumes]:
One day Robinson was out walking, with his gun in one hand
and his prospect-glass in the other, when all of a sudden he
thought he saw, far away in the distance, something that looked
like the smoke of a fire. Now this was to him another scare.
There could be no fire other than the fire upon his own hearth, un-
less it was kindled by strangers. But what strangers? Had this
anything to do with the foot-print? Poor Robby! Once more he
ran home to his hut; he saw that all was right there. He loaded
his guns; made fast all his doors and waited and waited. After a
time, when he could wait no longer, he went out again. This time
he ascended a hill, from which he could have a better view, and
not content with that, he climbed a tree. Then, putting up his
glass, what should he see, but, far off on the sea-shore, a lot of
savages dancing around a big fire, in which he thought he made
out something roasting. There was over a dozen of the black
men, and Robinson could do nothing but sit and watch them.
After a while they went away in two boats, or canoes, as they are
called, and Crusoe saw no more of them.
Poor Crusoe! here was something fresh for him to think about.
He HAD neighbors, to be sure. How many he could not even con-
jecture. But what neighbors—savages! cannibals! who might
one of those days come down upon his farm and eat him, goats
and all. But Crusoe saw no more of this lot for more than a year.
When they came again he was ready for them, and it was that
way he became possessed of his Man Friday.
^ This is how it came about. Robinson was always upon .the
watch for the savages, after their first visit; so, one day when he
saw them coming, he went out and planted himself near by where
he guessed they would land—that is a couple of miles from the
place. There were more than thirty of them this time, and they
brought to the island what seemed to be three or four prisoners
taken in war and tied up ready to be cooked and eaten. Yes,
there were four—three of them were soon killed and put down to
roast, but it happened so that the fourth prisoner, watching his
chance, bolted away from the fire and ran towards where Crusoe
was hiding. Two of the cannibals then left the rest and set to
running after the darkey that wanted to gscapc. The others
being, I guess, too busy with their nasty cooking to notice. The
poor darkey who was escaping—that's him that is afterwards
called Man Friday—ran, as I said, towards Crusoe. He was a
good one to run; also to swim. There was a creek between Cru-
soe and the savages; Man Friday jumps in and swims. Didn't he
swim? I bet you. The two savages jumped in too; but just as
they got out on the side next to Crusoe, Robinson comes out and
hits one of them a stunner on the head with the butt end of his
gun. Then the other stops and aims at Crusoe with his bow and
arrow. My! those arrows of the Indian savages are, as you've
heard, dipped in a poison, made, they say, from boiled alligators'
tongues, some also from rattle-snakes' brains and such. "Well, he
took a good aim; but Robinson, my boys, took a better one, you
may guess, and soon brought the old darkey down. Then up
comes Friday to Crusoe, and lays himself down at his feet, to
thank him. He couldn't thank him in words, not knowing the
language, but this is what he did. |He took Crusoe's foot and put
it upon his head, to show that he would be his slave forever after-
wards. Then they went to work to bury the dead bodies, for fear
the other savages should find them and want to revenge their
deaths.
Friday, who as yet didn't know any better, wanted to eat them,
but Crusoe, of course, wouldn't hear of it, and so buried they were,
in the sand just where they fell, and served them right. Crusoe
took Friday home with him, mighty glad after all that at last he
had somebody to talk to, even though only a darkey and he naked.
How to make Friday some clothes was the next question. Cru-
soe's "left off" would have done, but there were none. So he put
together some goat skins for a vest and pair of pants, and after
some trouble got Friday to put them on.
It was a gay time for Friday, no doubt, when first he found
himself in a Christian house. Nor was it less pleasant for Crusoe
to have a rational creature to room with him, after being for over
• twenty years shut up with goats and cats. Friday proved real
smart, and soon learned to understand his master's orders. After
a day or two they went down to the beach, where the cannibals
had held their carouse, and found the leavings of the feast, strewn
about—bones, skulls, and cinders. The sight almost made Crusoe
sick; but Friday had seen too many such festivals to be at all
moved by it.
?: If Crusoe was glad of the company of Friday, it did not make
him forget that by and by the cannibals would be pretty sure to
return; and thaj; they would in all likelihood come in greater
numbers and better prepared for opposition.
So along with his A, B, C, Crusoe would have to teach Friday
the use of a gun and the paces of a soldier. This he did, and an
apt scholar he proved. They had no school-books to study from,
but that didn't signify so very much. Crusoe got a big black-
board, and chalked up the lessons, as you see in my drawing. It
must have been real fun sometimes, when Friday was at his tasks,
the cat, the goats, and the parrot looking on, and no doubt think-
ing that they knew far more about grammar than the poor darkey
scholar.
Where there's a will there's a way, as the copy-heads run.
Friday had a good will and soon made good headway. The book
says that after a bit he got on to talk quite well with Crusoe
in the English tongue; and that, when his master came in time to
mention subjects out of the Bible and prayer-books, Friday more
than once brought tears into his teacher's eyes, by his simple
questions. But we will hurry on to the place where the savages
pay them another visit.
It was some months afterwards. They had been very busy on
their plantations, when one morning Friday came running into the
hut terribly scared. There were three canoes in sight, laden with
cannibals. This time also, they brought two prisoners to roast
and eat Crusoe and his Man Friday were up at once, and armed
to the teeth, as they say. Like a shot they set off to a wood that
overlooked the beach, and there waited for the darkeys. There
they came, and they were not long in beginning their horrid work.
But Crusoe and his man let fly among them, and quicker than I
can tell you, put the whole squad to flight. Off they scampered—
leastways those that were not killed—to their boats, and were
soon out of sight.
The rescued prisoners turned out to be, one of them a white
man—a Spaniard—the other a darkey, and no other than Friday's
old dad. It must have been as good as Christy's Minstrels to see
those two colored chaps meet at such a time; Friday, pleased as
Punch, to see his father, and the old man no less gay to be saved
from the roasting.
So now Crusoe's island began to be somewhat less lonely. He
was a sort of little King or Emperor, with just three subjects to
rule over.
The poor old colored man and the Spaniard had to be nursed
till they got well, which, however, would have been a long
business, had not Crusoe and Man Friday been such first-class
nurses. Then the Spaniard told his history and the old savage
told his.
The Spaniard was one of a ship's crew that had been wrecked
upo'n the coast where Friday's old father had lived. The savages
there were a sort of good-natured wild men, such I guess, as those
P. T. Barnum catches and hires, who for a few dollars are willing
to ride about in cars from one city to another and show the pale
faces (as they call us) the war dance, and all the other kick-ups of
their forest life. Anyhow the Spaniard's comrades were now left
among them, and he made out to Crusoe that they, although not
badly treated, would be glad enough to get away home, should the
opportunity ever turn up.
This set Crusoe thinking, and woke up the old wish he had, to
see once more people of his own sort; and even to return to his
own country again. He said to himself, if I can contrive to make
a boat big enough and strong enough to cross over to this Black-
man's land, it might lead £b something in the end, such as I wish;
at any rate the attempt will be worth making.
So he and Friday set to work to look out a big tree, whereof to
form a sailing boat. Friday was now a real help, as he was posted
in matters of boat making, and had built many a canoe in his own
*s
country. They found a tree near to the creek of a very hard sort
of wood, which they cut down and began to labor upon.
They had to hollow it out with what poor tools they had, till
there was room enough for two or three to sit down, and some spare
besides for provisions and ammunition.
Friday wanted to burn out the hollow of the tree, as he had
been accustomed to do in his own land; but Crusoe concluded that
his own way of whittling was the best. It took them more than a
month to do this, and they then hewed away at the outside till the
tree begun to look something like a boat, and in Friday's eyes was
about the handsomest vessel possible. Being shaped, the next
thing was to launch it. They had selected a tree near to the creek
in order to lessen this difficulty, but nevertheless, it took them a
fortnight more before they saw it floating upon the water. Then
Crusoe fitted a mast, which he made out of a young cedar tree;
and with his old ropes, and bits of sail cloth, saved twenty odd
years before from the shipwreck, he constructed a sail and rigging.
This was a surprise to Friday, who had been used only to such
canoes as were managed with an oar or paddle. But Crusoe soon
taught him the use of a rudder and how to work the ropes and to
tack, so that in a very short time the craft, with Robinson for
captain and Friday for crew, was ready for sea.
The next thing was, to wait for the most favorable season. In
that part of the world, as Crusoe had come to know, there was a
time for sailing, and a time for lying by and keeping quiet. The
rainy season was then at hand, when it would have been danger-
ous to have set out with so small a vessel. So Crusoe and Friday
hauled their boat into the creek at high water, and to make all
snug, they constructed a dock for it to float in at all times, with a
break-water or dam across the end of it, and so she lay dry as to
the tide from the sea; and to keep the rain off, they made a roof
of boughs of trees, so thick that she was as well thatched as a
house; and then they waited for the season wherein to make the
proposed voyage.
The Spaniard was all this time side; but gradually he got well,
and as you may be sure, felt very grateful to Crusoe for his care of
him. Crusoe told him of his intended voyage, and they had a
good deal of talk about it. In the end it was determined to let
the Spaniard go, with Friday's father, in the boat to the place
where the other Spaniards were left; and if they found all right,
they were to return and report. So, bidding Crusoe and Friday
good bye, away they went on their voyage.
Now we come to the part where those things happened that
led to Crusoe's leaving his island and returning to his home in
England.
One morning, when Crusoe and Friday were anxiously upon
the watch in the "look out" which they had constructed near the
beach, they thought they espied a sail far off upon the horizon.
This time it appeared to be either an English or some other
European vessel. Gradually it neared the island, and then Crusoe
made out with his glass that it was an English ship. Presently
they saw a boat lowered, and, with a party of men in it, approach
the shore.
The men soon landed, and Crusoe, from his hiding place, dis-
covered them to be mutineers, who had risen upon their captain,
bound his hands and feet, and were now putting him upon what
they believed to be a desolate and uninhabited island, meaning to
leave him there to starve. Robinson learned all this easily as the
sailors spoke in English.
Now what did Crusoe and Friday do? They waited till the
mutineers had set their captain down and left him, and started to
have a stroll upon the island; then, coming out from their hiding
place, they untied the poor captain's hands and feet, and took him
to the hut. When they got him in there, he, gladly enough told
Crusoe all the particulars of the mutiny on shipboard, and, in the
end, they arranged a plan to serve the mutineers out. First, they
went to their boat, which the sailors had drawn up.onto the
beach, and knocked a hole in it. Then they took out of it the
oars, and guns, and other things the rascals had left, so that the
boat was of no use to the mutineers. Then they lay in wait
behind some trees, and when the rascals came back intending to
return to the ship, Crusoe and the captain and Man Friday came
rushing down upon them and tired the guns, killing some and
wounding the rest.
Then the other mutineers, left in the ship, finding their friends
didn't return or make signals, began to be frightened.
By and by they sent another boat ashore with more men to
look after the first. But Crusoe's party served this batch much as
they had served the others, and, to cut the story short, in the end,
the poor captain, that was to have been left on the island to
starve, got his ship back, and you may be sure was very grateful
to Robinson Crusoe, who had helped him to do so.
Then he proposed to take Crusoe home to England, and gave
up to him the whole command of the ship, and the arrangement
of the voyage.
Robinson was not slow to accept this oifer. He wanted to see
the old country again. He looked upon the coming of the vessel
and the events that followed as the ordering of Providence in his
favor. So he resolved to go, Friday also was to go with him and
his favorite parrot and all his pets. When Crusoe came to bid
good bye to these and to his island, he felt kind of sorry. Twenty-
five years had passed since he first landed; the place had come to
be pleasant to him.
I dare say the goats too liked him, and, as he could not take
them all away with him, maybe some of them felt bad at his de-
parture, and there was his hut, and his cave, and the plantations.
Poor Robinson didn't quite like to abandon these forever. So
what does he do? He gets some of the ships' crew to stay and
mind them—makes one of them a present of the governorship of
the island, and promises to come again, or to send them word from
England as soon as he gets there, and then bid them and his little
empire farewell.
The second part of the History of Robinson Crusoe tells of his
return to the island; what he found there; and what followed:
but these things we must not talk of now. Let's to bed—perhaps
on another night we may talk of them also.



PREFACE.
[THE fact was, they, meaning J. Spraggles and his fellow-students
at TICKLETOBY'S, had lost the only printed copy of De Foe's won-
derful story that had ever been seen in that part of the world.
J. S. was not the smartest boy there, but he was the oddest and
best natured; given to story relating, and moreover, in the opinion
of his schoolmates, a great genius with his pencil. So, one winter
evening, when they found themselves shut in from the busy world,
alone, and at leisure from their tasks, he was entreated, nem. con.r
to tell the story of Robinson Crusoe, from memory.
His words, and the drawings with which he eked out his
description of the daring .navigator's adventures are as follow: ]
ROBINSON CRUSOE, you see, was the son of a merchant in
York, England. His father meant him for a merchant like him-
self; but Robinson, I guess, had been reading books of travels
and adventures; books of shipwrecks, and icebergs—of burning
mountains, and waterspouts and things. I guess too, he had been
to the circus and seen the jolly Jack Tar in his daring hornpipe act
on the back of a spirited Arabian charger; or else to the museum
to witness Black Eyed Susan, or Captain Cook. Anyhow, he would
go to sea, and go to sea he did. Didn't he get served out ?—hold
on and you'll see.
Well, he went on a voyage. You'll excuse my not recollecting
the names of all the places he went to, or all the people he met in
his first voyage. It aint material. And the best part is where he
gets to a certain uninhabited island in the Pacific ocean. (Here
an impatient little student interrupts things with the request " Oh,
do Jim tell us that part first.") No, no, Johnny, wait awhile *
everything in its turn. First let me tell you Robby had no sooner
got in a storm than he began to be sorry he went. The waves
rolled high as mountains. The thunder and lightning scared him
above a bit. He thought, every time the ship went up sky hign
onto the top of a wave, that he was going to the bottom. Oh, says
Robinson, this storm has been sent as a punishment for me. Why
didn't I stay home and be a merchant? If ever (says he) I get
home again, please the L—d, I'll be a merchant right away, and
never, never, never, want to go to sea again.
Perhaps it was real sorrow for having disobeyed his papa that
made him say this, and perhaps it was only scariness. It don't
matter. By and by, the storm ceased, and the ship was steady.
But a second storm arose; and this time the ship went down. R.
C. was saved in a boat and went to London. From there he went
to sea again, to the gold coast with a Captain in the Guinea trade.
Guineas, boys, are currency in England, where they don't have
greenbacks. So the Guinea trade was some, I tell you. But here
Robinson was again unlucky, and he and the ship's crew were
taken prisoners by the Algerine pirates and sold for slaves.
Now we come to the bully part. Rob he soon cuts off from the
pirates' land and gets to sea again. This time it was a West India
trader that he went with. I believe the vessel went there—but it
also went to some other places—as you will see. But the place of
all places it went to, in the end, was near an uninhabited island—
where he met Friday and shot the black savages, who were going
to eat him after roasting, besides dancing a break-down around his
quivering remains, all stuck full of arrows. But that comes after-
wards. (The before-noticed impatient student here again interpo-
lates the query "Will it be long before you come to that part ? ")
No, not long, Johnny. Don't you be too fast.
Here in this picture you see him climbing the cliffs of the
island. The ship has only a part of its mast sticking out of the
water. The sun is sinking too. Those birds and goats I put in
here as there is a good deal about them further on, and I thought
I would introduce them now.
Well poor Crusoe, you can bet, didn't feel good the first night
or two of his sleeping upon the uninhabited island. But then he
had little time for reflection. The punkeys were about; and then
he had to scare up something to live upon. So he casts about, up
and down the beach, and picks up peanuts and clams enough to
keep him alive. Then he sits down and considers. There is the
wreck which the tide has left high and dry. "Probably," says
Robinson to himself—he had nobody else to say it to,—" there is
something left in the old ship that might help towards house fur-
nishing, supposing I have to stop here and live." But how to get
to the wreck. It was over a mile from low-water mark. "Say,
Robinson," says he—always to himself mind you, for as yet he
hadn't Friday to talk to,—" say, Robinson, you had better try and
fix up something of a raft, and on that make a voyage to the
wreck." Yes, but how? R. C. had no tools to make a raft with.
He concluded then to swim off to the wreck and fetch away any
odd tools that might Remain, with as much wood and rope and
such like notions as would make one.
Well, after some trouble he got together a raft, such as you see
I have drawn in the next picture. When he reached the wreck
the first time, with his raft, Robinson was a bit put to it, what to
take and what to leave: for his raft wasn't much of an affair,
Robby being but a poor carpenter, never having done anything in
that way before, except a little whittling, perhaps, at times. It,
the raft, might upset in the water, and then he would have all his
trouble for nothing. So he put onto it a few necessary things,
just enough to begin housekeeping, with some biscuits, some rum,
a barrel of gunpowder, all the ammunition he could collect, besides
boards, ropes, clothes, and the balance of the ship's treasure—a
biggish pile of guineas. This money, to be sure, wasn't of much
use to him just then; he could have no occasion for it in such a
place. There were no stores to spend it at, he had no rent to pay,
nor taxes. There wasn't even a savings bank to put it in. Any-
how he took it, there being no other owner for it, and he thought
it would be a shame to leave it for the fishes to swallow.
After getting these things upon his raft, and steering it to
land, Robinson next cast about for a place to build himself a
hut in.
There were plenty of vacant lots, to be sure, but the thing was
to find one that was well away from storms and danger, not too
near nor too far from the sea-shore. He had had some experience
of storms you know, and didn't want to be caught suddenly by a
tornado and whirled like a dried leaf up into the air, nor did he
want to be woke up in the night to find himself floating out to
sea like another little Moses in the bulrushes. At length he
pitched upon a spot and began in earnest to fix up. He drove
stakes into the ground to form an enclosure, then he boarded this
round, all the time finding it hard to do carpentering without the
right sort of tools. The fact is, he broke down more than once,
and had to go many times to the wreck for materials. One day he
found some nails, another day he happened upon a grindstone;
but it was many weeks before he had anything to grind upon it,
his first hatchet being only a wooden one made by himself out of
a hard-tree stump.
It took Robinson a long time, you may guess, before his hut
was fit to live in. Glad enough he must have been to have
it finished. Before then he had to sleep in a hole in the rocks
or in hollows of trees, or under a pile of barrels and awnings;
terribly afraid of wild beasts, reptiles, and, for what he knew,
horrid savages. For remember he had not yet explored the
island, and was far from certain as to his being the only man
upon it.
Then the earthquake—but stop, that did not happen till after
he had moved into his hut. I can't say whether it was on a First
of May that this took place. Anyhow, Robinson found it real hard
to do the moving in without a cart or a man to help him, espe-
cially with the big things. At last, however, he began to get fixed
up—sort of comfortable, leastways as much so as he could expect
under the circumstances, seeing he had neither chair, nor table,
nor bedstead, nor bureau. How he made these afterwards, I shall
explain to you, if I don't forget.
But it was time now to go out and look about the island, to
see if there really were no other human beings; also to try and
shoot something good to eat. Robinson took two guns with him
and a good sharp sword, and went along cautiously at first, you
may guess.
Well, he saw nobody that time, and shot only a young goat or
two, which he cooked afterwards and eat.
I have drawn a picture of this shooting excursion, such as I
fancy it must have been. The goats are scared, naturally, for you
know they had never before heard the report of a gun, and possi-
bly didn't quite know what it meant.
They learned that bit of science, however, pretty soon, for
Robinson went out shooting nearly every day from that time.
Talking of time, reminds me of what Robinson did to keep count
of the days and the weeks. He set up a post, and for every day
that passed he made a notch with his knife. In this way he knew
when Sunday came round; and always took care upon that day
to refrain from work as far as possible and to stay indoors and
read prayers.
One day a terrible earthquake came. Do you know what an
earthquake is? Well, I see you all know. It knocked things
about and nearly destroyed poor Robinson's hut. So he bethought
himself of building a safer place to hide in; the more so as his
store of gunpowder was always liable to be blown up by light-
ning or other causes. He set to work again, and this time dug
himself a cave in the earth; a sort of big sub-cellar, rather dark,
but safer as a store than his hut. To this cave he carried his
powder and the things he most wanted to keep out of harm's way.
You see he was never sure of being quite alone upon the island,
and by and by you will learn that he was right to have doubts
about that.
I ought to mention, before I forget, how Robinson Crusoe took
to farming. It was by a sort of accident. He had brought from
the wreck a bag of bird seed, which had been put on board to
feed chickens with. This had got wet, and Robinson concluding
that it was spoiled, threw it over the fence of his hut. Lucky for
him it was he did that. Among the seeds thrown away were
some barley and com seeds; and these after a time sprung up.
and bore a good crop. Now Robinson, when he saw this, was
wonderfully glad. He carefully gathered the ears of barley and
wheat, and when the proper time came round planted them, and
in the end raised a good harvest.
There will not be time to tell you how Crusoe made a boat to
go cruising about the bays and creeks in; how his clothes wore
out and he had to turn tailor and make himself a new suit; and
that, mind you, not out of cloth, or calico, but out of the only
other things he had, goats' skins and birds' feathers. How he fell
sick and had no doctor, nor medicine; how when he got over his
fever and ague, he had the blues real bad, and was light-headed
and saw visions and much more of that sort. How from talking
much to himself, his parrot learned to talk, and one day when
poor Crusoe was out in the woods, it scared him above a bit by
calling him by his name. How the parrot came to learn his name
I forget, and can't guess, unless it was that it saw it painted upon
his poor master's trunk.
We come now to the part where, after having been some years
in his island, walking one day upon the sea-shore, he saw the
print of a man's foot in the sand. Just fancy, all this time he had
been living as though there was no man upon it but himself, and
here was a foot-print. Robinson jumped as though he had seen a
ghost.
He didn't stay long to examine the mark. Off he cut, right
home. Why? you say; perhaps Crusoe didn't know why himself.
He was just scared, that was all. It was what he had not looked
for. He ran home, as I said to his hut, and bolted and barred
himself in, right away. Was he sorry then that there were, per-
haps, other people besides himself upon the island? At first I
suppose he hardly knew whether he was glad or sorry. He sat
thinking and thinking all that day about it, and at last he went to
bed and dreamt of it. He says in his book, that what scared him
most was, not that it might be the foot-print of a man, for he
could not tell how any MAN could have got there without his know-
ing it, but that it might be the foot-print of .
Don't look so scared, you Dick, I shan't mention any bad
names. Robinson took in earnest to his prayer-book, and read it
from end to end before he was quite himself again. Then he de-
termined to go out and have another look at the foot-print, "for,"
said he, "it may be only fancy, perhaps it was no foot-print at
all;" or perhaps, only one of my own steps when I came first
ashore.
So, after keeping indoors for three days and nights, and getting
nearly starved to death, R. C. went out once more and proceeded
cautiously to the beach; this time looking sharply around him to
see if there were any more things of the same sort. But he found
none. There was the foot-print, and measuring it, to make sure
that it was not one of his own, he found it several sizes larger than
any boot he had ever worn.
/
Robinson Crusoe then went back to his hut and set to work to
fortify it; thickening its walls with stumps of trees, putting up
double doors, making port-holes to shoot through and all that.
In fact, his fear was, that what human beings were likely to be
there, were not such as himself, fellows who had been brought up
respectably, and read their Bibles and prayer-books, but horrid
pagan savages, man-eaters; running about naked, may be, and as
black as your hat. So, after making his hut as strong as he could,
he set about finding a more secure place for his flock of goats.
He took long walks into the back part of the island and at last
found the sort of place he wanted. But I must now tell you of
another scare poor Crusoe got.
He was prospecting, as we may say, one day, among the rocks
and caves of his island, still scarey and nervous about the black
savages, that, for aught he knew, might be prowling around under
the trees, when he found his way into a cavern.
He had never seen this before. It was a dark place, narrow at
its mouth and wider as you got in. Crusoe crept along, at first
upon his hands and knees, then upon his toes, feeling his way
cautiously with his hands. All at once he sees something away
back in the dark—two great, round, storey eyes. Yes, two bright
flaming lights. What could this be? May be, thought Crusoe,
this is the fellow who made the foot-print on the sand. However,
lie would not be beaten this time. So he got a light, and was
about to go further ahead, when he heard a deep sigh, or moan,
like that of a man or animal in pain. Never mind, thought
Crusoe—though he felt all his hair stand on end—I'm going to see
what this is about anyway; and go he did.
Look at this picture here. You see what it was. There was a
very old goat that had managed to get into the cave and hadn't
found strength enough to get out again. ^
Robinson was glad it was no worse. He tried to get the old
goat out of the cave, but it was of no use. The old thing had
lived long enough to suit it, and so died peaceably the next day.
This sort of life was led by poor Crusoe for near upon twenty
years. I dare say you boys (said J. Spraggles) have many times
thought to yourselves, when you've heard tell of Robinson Crusoe
and his island, "Oh, wouldn't it be real bully to go to sea and get
•Robinson. OUT

landed on a desert island, and build a hut, and shoot goats, and
have a Man Friday, and all that;" but (continued J. S.) do you
know, I think you wouldn't like it after all. You'd find it dull to
be twenty years without seeing anybody else; and you'd do what
Robinson did, in his book. I mean, you would look upon it all as
a punishment sent him for not staying at home and doing what
his father wanted him to.
[Here several of J. Spraggles' hearers yawn and show symptoms
of sleepiness—so he thus resumes]:
One day Robinson was out walking, with his gun in one hand
and his prospect-glass in the other, when all of a sudden he
thought he saw, far away in the distance, something that looked
like the smoke of a fire. Now this was to him another scare.
There could be no fire other than the fire upon his own hearth, un-
less it was kindled by strangers. But what strangers? Had this
anything to do with the foot-print? Poor Robby! Once more he
ran home to his hut; he saw that all was right there. He loaded
his guns; made fast all his doors and waited and waited. After a
time, when he could wait no longer, he went out again. This time
he ascended a hill, from which he could have a better view, and
not content with that, he climbed a tree. Then, putting up his
glass, what should he see, but, far off on the sea-shore, a lot of
savages dancing around a big fire, in which he thought he made
out something roasting. There was over a dozen of the black
men, and Robinson could do nothing but sit and watch them.
After a while they went away in two boats, or canoes, as they are
called, and Crusoe saw no more of them.
Poor Crusoe! here was something fresh for him to think about.
He HAD neighbors, to be sure. How many he could not even con-
jecture. But what neighbors—savages! cannibals! who might
one of those days come down upon his farm and eat him, goats
and all. But Crusoe saw no more of this lot for more than a year.
When they came again he was ready for them, and it was that
way he became possessed of his Man Friday.
^ This is how it came about. Robinson was always upon .the
watch for the savages, after their first visit; so, one day when he
saw them coming, he went out and planted himself near by where
he guessed they would land—that is a couple of miles from the
place. There were more than thirty of them this time, and they
brought to the island what seemed to be three or four prisoners
taken in war and tied up ready to be cooked and eaten. Yes,
there were four—three of them were soon killed and put down to
roast, but it happened so that the fourth prisoner, watching his
chance, bolted away from the fire and ran towards where Crusoe
was hiding. Two of the cannibals then left the rest and set to
running after the darkey that wanted to gscapc. The others
being, I guess, too busy with their nasty cooking to notice. The
poor darkey who was escaping—that's him that is afterwards
called Man Friday—ran, as I said, towards Crusoe. He was a
good one to run; also to swim. There was a creek between Cru-
soe and the savages; Man Friday jumps in and swims. Didn't he
swim? I bet you. The two savages jumped in too; but just as
they got out on the side next to Crusoe, Robinson comes out and
hits one of them a stunner on the head with the butt end of his
gun. Then the other stops and aims at Crusoe with his bow and
arrow. My! those arrows of the Indian savages are, as you've
heard, dipped in a poison, made, they say, from boiled alligators'
tongues, some also from rattle-snakes' brains and such. "Well, he
took a good aim; but Robinson, my boys, took a better one, you
may guess, and soon brought the old darkey down. Then up
comes Friday to Crusoe, and lays himself down at his feet, to
thank him. He couldn't thank him in words, not knowing the
language, but this is what he did. |He took Crusoe's foot and put
it upon his head, to show that he would be his slave forever after-
wards. Then they went to work to bury the dead bodies, for fear
the other savages should find them and want to revenge their
deaths.
Friday, who as yet didn't know any better, wanted to eat them,
but Crusoe, of course, wouldn't hear of it, and so buried they were,
in the sand just where they fell, and served them right. Crusoe
took Friday home with him, mighty glad after all that at last he
had somebody to talk to, even though only a darkey and he naked.
How to make Friday some clothes was the next question. Cru-
soe's "left off" would have done, but there were none. So he put
together some goat skins for a vest and pair of pants, and after
some trouble got Friday to put them on.
It was a gay time for Friday, no doubt, when first he found
himself in a Christian house. Nor was it less pleasant for Crusoe
to have a rational creature to room with him, after being for over
• twenty years shut up with goats and cats. Friday proved real
smart, and soon learned to understand his master's orders. After
a day or two they went down to the beach, where the cannibals
had held their carouse, and found the leavings of the feast, strewn
about—bones, skulls, and cinders. The sight almost made Crusoe
sick; but Friday had seen too many such festivals to be at all
moved by it.
?: If Crusoe was glad of the company of Friday, it did not make
him forget that by and by the cannibals would be pretty sure to
return; and thaj; they would in all likelihood come in greater
numbers and better prepared for opposition.
So along with his A, B, C, Crusoe would have to teach Friday
the use of a gun and the paces of a soldier. This he did, and an
apt scholar he proved. They had no school-books to study from,
but that didn't signify so very much. Crusoe got a big black-
board, and chalked up the lessons, as you see in my drawing. It
must have been real fun sometimes, when Friday was at his tasks,
the cat, the goats, and the parrot looking on, and no doubt think-
ing that they knew far more about grammar than the poor darkey
scholar.
Where there's a will there's a way, as the copy-heads run.
Friday had a good will and soon made good headway. The book
says that after a bit he got on to talk quite well with Crusoe
in the English tongue; and that, when his master came in time to
mention subjects out of the Bible and prayer-books, Friday more
than once brought tears into his teacher's eyes, by his simple
questions. But we will hurry on to the place where the savages
pay them another visit.
It was some months afterwards. They had been very busy on
their plantations, when one morning Friday came running into the
hut terribly scared. There were three canoes in sight, laden with
cannibals. This time also, they brought two prisoners to roast
and eat Crusoe and his Man Friday were up at once, and armed
to the teeth, as they say. Like a shot they set off to a wood that
overlooked the beach, and there waited for the darkeys. There
they came, and they were not long in beginning their horrid work.
But Crusoe and his man let fly among them, and quicker than I
can tell you, put the whole squad to flight. Off they scampered—
leastways those that were not killed—to their boats, and were
soon out of sight.
The rescued prisoners turned out to be, one of them a white
man—a Spaniard—the other a darkey, and no other than Friday's
old dad. It must have been as good as Christy's Minstrels to see
those two colored chaps meet at such a time; Friday, pleased as
Punch, to see his father, and the old man no less gay to be saved
from the roasting.
So now Crusoe's island began to be somewhat less lonely. He
was a sort of little King or Emperor, with just three subjects to
rule over.
The poor old colored man and the Spaniard had to be nursed
till they got well, which, however, would have been a long
business, had not Crusoe and Man Friday been such first-class
nurses. Then the Spaniard told his history and the old savage
told his.
The Spaniard was one of a ship's crew that had been wrecked
upo'n the coast where Friday's old father had lived. The savages
there were a sort of good-natured wild men, such I guess, as those
P. T. Barnum catches and hires, who for a few dollars are willing
to ride about in cars from one city to another and show the pale
faces (as they call us) the war dance, and all the other kick-ups of
their forest life. Anyhow the Spaniard's comrades were now left
among them, and he made out to Crusoe that they, although not
badly treated, would be glad enough to get away home, should the
opportunity ever turn up.
This set Crusoe thinking, and woke up the old wish he had, to
see once more people of his own sort; and even to return to his
own country again. He said to himself, if I can contrive to make
a boat big enough and strong enough to cross over to this Black-
man's land, it might lead £b something in the end, such as I wish;
at any rate the attempt will be worth making.
So he and Friday set to work to look out a big tree, whereof to
form a sailing boat. Friday was now a real help, as he was posted
in matters of boat making, and had built many a canoe in his own
*s
country. They found a tree near to the creek of a very hard sort
of wood, which they cut down and began to labor upon.
They had to hollow it out with what poor tools they had, till
there was room enough for two or three to sit down, and some spare
besides for provisions and ammunition.
Friday wanted to burn out the hollow of the tree, as he had
been accustomed to do in his own land; but Crusoe concluded that
his own way of whittling was the best. It took them more than a
month to do this, and they then hewed away at the outside till the
tree begun to look something like a boat, and in Friday's eyes was
about the handsomest vessel possible. Being shaped, the next
thing was to launch it. They had selected a tree near to the creek
in order to lessen this difficulty, but nevertheless, it took them a
fortnight more before they saw it floating upon the water. Then
Crusoe fitted a mast, which he made out of a young cedar tree;
and with his old ropes, and bits of sail cloth, saved twenty odd
years before from the shipwreck, he constructed a sail and rigging.
This was a surprise to Friday, who had been used only to such
canoes as were managed with an oar or paddle. But Crusoe soon
taught him the use of a rudder and how to work the ropes and to
tack, so that in a very short time the craft, with Robinson for
captain and Friday for crew, was ready for sea.
The next thing was, to wait for the most favorable season. In
that part of the world, as Crusoe had come to know, there was a
time for sailing, and a time for lying by and keeping quiet. The
rainy season was then at hand, when it would have been danger-
ous to have set out with so small a vessel. So Crusoe and Friday
hauled their boat into the creek at high water, and to make all
snug, they constructed a dock for it to float in at all times, with a
break-water or dam across the end of it, and so she lay dry as to
the tide from the sea; and to keep the rain off, they made a roof
of boughs of trees, so thick that she was as well thatched as a
house; and then they waited for the season wherein to make the
proposed voyage.
The Spaniard was all this time side; but gradually he got well,
and as you may be sure, felt very grateful to Crusoe for his care of
him. Crusoe told him of his intended voyage, and they had a
good deal of talk about it. In the end it was determined to let
the Spaniard go, with Friday's father, in the boat to the place
where the other Spaniards were left; and if they found all right,
they were to return and report. So, bidding Crusoe and Friday
good bye, away they went on their voyage.
Now we come to the part where those things happened that
led to Crusoe's leaving his island and returning to his home in
England.
One morning, when Crusoe and Friday were anxiously upon
the watch in the "look out" which they had constructed near the
beach, they thought they espied a sail far off upon the horizon.
This time it appeared to be either an English or some other
European vessel. Gradually it neared the island, and then Crusoe
made out with his glass that it was an English ship. Presently
they saw a boat lowered, and, with a party of men in it, approach
the shore.
The men soon landed, and Crusoe, from his hiding place, dis-
covered them to be mutineers, who had risen upon their captain,
bound his hands and feet, and were now putting him upon what
they believed to be a desolate and uninhabited island, meaning to
leave him there to starve. Robinson learned all this easily as the
sailors spoke in English.
Now what did Crusoe and Friday do? They waited till the
mutineers had set their captain down and left him, and started to
have a stroll upon the island; then, coming out from their hiding
place, they untied the poor captain's hands and feet, and took him
to the hut. When they got him in there, he, gladly enough told
Crusoe all the particulars of the mutiny on shipboard, and, in the
end, they arranged a plan to serve the mutineers out. First, they
went to their boat, which the sailors had drawn up.onto the
beach, and knocked a hole in it. Then they took out of it the
oars, and guns, and other things the rascals had left, so that the
boat was of no use to the mutineers. Then they lay in wait
behind some trees, and when the rascals came back intending to
return to the ship, Crusoe and the captain and Man Friday came
rushing down upon them and tired the guns, killing some and
wounding the rest.
Then the other mutineers, left in the ship, finding their friends
didn't return or make signals, began to be frightened.
By and by they sent another boat ashore with more men to
look after the first. But Crusoe's party served this batch much as
they had served the others, and, to cut the story short, in the end,
the poor captain, that was to have been left on the island to
starve, got his ship back, and you may be sure was very grateful
to Robinson Crusoe, who had helped him to do so.
Then he proposed to take Crusoe home to England, and gave
up to him the whole command of the ship, and the arrangement
of the voyage.
Robinson was not slow to accept this oifer. He wanted to see
the old country again. He looked upon the coming of the vessel
and the events that followed as the ordering of Providence in his
favor. So he resolved to go, Friday also was to go with him and
his favorite parrot and all his pets. When Crusoe came to bid
good bye to these and to his island, he felt kind of sorry. Twenty-
five years had passed since he first landed; the place had come to
be pleasant to him.
I dare say the goats too liked him, and, as he could not take
them all away with him, maybe some of them felt bad at his de-
parture, and there was his hut, and his cave, and the plantations.
Poor Robinson didn't quite like to abandon these forever. So
what does he do? He gets some of the ships' crew to stay and
mind them—makes one of them a present of the governorship of
the island, and promises to come again, or to send them word from
England as soon as he gets there, and then bid them and his little
empire farewell.
The second part of the History of Robinson Crusoe tells of his
return to the island; what he found there; and what followed:
but these things we must not talk of now. Let's to bed—perhaps
on another night we may talk of them also.
