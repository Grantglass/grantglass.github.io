THE
LIFE AND ADVENTURED
ROBINSON CRUSOE.
OOfoo
I Was born in York, in the year 1632, of a
reputable family. My father was a native of
Bremen; who by merchandizing at Hull for
some time, gained a very plentiful fortune. He
married my mother at York, who received her
first breath in that country: and as her maiden
name was Robinson, I was called Robinson
Kreutznaer, which not being easily pronounced
in the English tongue, we are commonly known
by the name of Crusoe.
I was the youngest of three brothers. The
eldest was a lieutenant-colonel in Lockhart's
regiment, but slain by the Spaniards; what be-
came of the other I could never learn.
No charge nor pains were wanting in my edu-
;ation. My father designed me for the law, yei
aothing could serve me but I must go tt «««

both against the will of mv father, the tears of
my mother, and the entreaties of friends. One
morning, my father expostulated very warmly
with me. What reason, says he, have you to
leave your tiative country, where there must be
a more certain prospect of content and happiness,
\o enter into a wandering condition of uneasiness
and uncertainty 1 He recommended to me
Agar's wish, neither to desire poverty nor rich-
es; that a middle state of life was the most hap-
py; arid that the high towering thoughts of
raising our condition by wandering abroad, were
surrounded with misery and danger, and ofte'rt
ended with confusion and disappointment. I en-
treat you, nay, I command you (says he,) to
desist from these intentions. If you will go,
(added he,) my prayers shall, however, be offer-
ed for your preservation; but a time may cdme;
when desolate, oppressed, or forsaken, you may
Mish you had taken your poor despised father's
counsel.—He pronounced these words with such
a moving and paternal eloquence, while floods of
tsars ran down his aged cheeks, that it seemed
to stem the torrent of my resolution. But this
soon wore off; and a little after, I informed rny
mother that I couid not settle at any business;
my resolutions were so strong to see the world,
and begged she would gain my father's consent
only to go one voyage; which if it did not prove
prosperous, I would never attempt a second.
But my desire was as vain as my folly in asking.
My mother passionately expressed her dislike to
this proposal, telling me that as she saw I was
fcent on my own destruction, contrary to their
ROBINSON CRUSOE.
will and my duty, she would say no more, but
leave me to myself to do whatever I pleased.
1 was then; I think, nineteen years old, when
one time being at Hull, I met a school-fellow of
mine going along wilh his father, who was mas-
ter of a ship, to London; and acquainting him
with my wandering desires, he assured me of a
free passage; and a plentiful share of what was
necessary. Thus, without imploring a blessing,
or taking farewell of my parents, I took shipping
on the 1st of September, 1651.
Upon the 6th day, we came to an anchor in
Harwich roadt where we lay wind-bound with
some Newcastle ships; and there being a good
anchorage, and our cables sound, the seamen for-
got their late toil and danger, and spent the time
as merrily as if they had been on shore. But on
the eighth day, there arose a brisk gale of wind,
which prevented our tiding it up the river; and
it still increasing, our ship rode forecastle in, and
shipped several large seas.
It was not long before horror seized the sea-
men themselves, and I heard the master express
this rselancholy ejaculation; Lord have mercy
upon us, we shall all be lost and undone! For
my part, sick unto death, I kept my cabin, till
the universal and terribly dreadful apprehensions
of our speedy fate made me get upon deck, and
there I was affrighted indeed. The sea went
mountains high: I could see nothing but distress
around us: two ships had cut away their masts,
and another had foundered; two more that had lost
tl.eir anchors, were forced out to the mercy of
the ocean; and, to save our lives, we wer6

forced to cut our foremast and mainmast quite
away.
Who is there so ignorant as not. to judge of
my dreadful condition? I was but a fresh water
sailor, and therefore seemed more terrified.
Our ship was very good, but overloaded; which
made the sailors often cry out, She will founder:
word? I then was ignorant of. All this while,
the storm continuing, and rather increasing, the
master and the more sober part of the men went
to prayers, expecting death every moment. In
ihe middle of the night one cried out, We had
sprung a leak: another, That there was four feet
water in the hold. I was just ready to expire
with fear, when immediately all hands were call-
ed to the pump; and the men forced me also in
that extremity to share with them in their labour.
While thus employed, the master espying some
colliers, fired a gun as a signal of distress; and
I not understanding what it meant, and thinking
that either the ship broke, or some dreadful thing
happened, fell into a swoon. Even in that con-
dition of woe, nobody minded me, excepting to
thrust me aside with their feet, thinking me dead;
and it was a great while before I recovered.
Happy it was for us, when upon the signal
given, they ventured out their boat to save our
lives, All our pumping had been in vain, and
vain had all our attempts been, had they not come
to our ships side, and our men cast them a rope
over the stern with a bouy to it, which after great
difficulty they got hold of, and we hauling them
to us, got into their boat, and left our ship which
we perceived sink within less than a quarter of
- I' i - '=a
art hour; and thus I learnt what was meant by
foundering at sea. And now the men incessant-
ly laboured to recover their own ship; but the
sea ran so high, and the wind blew so hard, that
they thought it convenient to haul in shore, which
with great difficulty and danger at last we happily
effected, landing at a place called Cromer, not
far from Winterton light-house; from whence
we all walked to Yarmouth, where, as objects of
pity, many good people furnished us with the
necessaries to carry us either to Hull, or London.
Strange! that after all this, I did not, like the
prodigal son, return to my'father; who hearing
of the skip's calamity, for a long time thought me
entombed in the deep. No doubt but I should
have shared in his fatted calf, as the Scripture
expresseth it; but my wayward disposition still
pushed trie on, in spite of the powerful convic-
tions of reason and conscience. When we had
been at Yarmouth three days I met my old com-
panion, who had given me the invitation to go on
board along with his father. His behaviour and
speech was altered, and; in a melancholy manner
he asked me how I did 1 telling his father who I
was, and how I had made this voyage for a trial
only to proceed farther abroad. Upon which the
old gentleman turning to me, said, Young man^
you ought never to go to sea any more, but to
take this for a certain sign, that you will never
prosper in a sea-faring condition. Sir, answered
I; will you take the same resolution? It is a
different case, said he, it is my calling, and con-
sequently my duty; but ns vou have made this
voyage for a trial, you see what ill luck heaven
fias set before your eyes; and perhaps our mi-
series have been on your account, like Jonah in
the ship of Tarshish. But pray what are you,
and on what account did you go to sea 1 Upon
which, I very freely declared my whole story; at
the end of which he made this exclamation, Ye
sacred powers! what had I committed, that such
a wretch should enter into my ship, to heap upon
me such a deluge of miseries 1 But soon recol-
lecting himself, Young man, said he, if you do
not go back, depend upon it, wherever you go,
you will meet with disasters, and disappointments,
till your father's words are fulfilled upon you.
And so we parted.
I thought at first to return home; but shame
opposed that good notion, as thinking I should
be laughed at by my neighbours and acquaint-
ances. So strange is the nature of youth!
They are not ashamed to sin, but yet ashamed to
repent; and so far from being sorry for those
actions for which they may be accounted fools,
they think it folly to return to their duty, which is
the principle mark of wisdom. In short, I tra-
velled up to London, resolving upon a voyage,
and a voyage I soon heard of, by my acquaint-
ance with a captain who took a fancy to me, to
go to the coast of Guinea. Having some mo-
ney and appearing like a gentleman, I went on
board, not as a common sailor or foremast-man;
nay, the commander agreed 1 should go that
voyage with him without any expense: that I
should be his messmate and companion, and that
I was welcome to carry any thing with me, and
make the best merchandise I could.
I blessed my happy fortune, and humbly
thanked my captain for his offer, and acquainting
my friends in Yorkshire, forty pounds were sent
me, the greatest part of which my dear father
and mother contributed, with which I bought toys
and trifles as the captain directed me. My cap-
tain also taught me navigation, how to keep an
account of the ship's course, take an observation,
and led me into the knowledge of several useful
branches of the mathematics. And indeed this
voyage made me both a sailor and a merchant;
for I brought home five pound nine ounces of
gold dust, for my adventure, which produced, at
my return to London, almost three hundred
pounds; but in this voyage I was extremely
sick, being thrown into a violent fever, through
excessive heat, trading upon the coast from the
latitude of fifteen degrees north, even to the line
itself.
But, alas! my dear friend the captain soon
departed this life after his arrival. This was a
sensible grief to me; yet I resolved to go ano-
ther voyage with his mate, who had now got
command of the ship. This proved a very un-
successful one; for though I did not carry a
hundred pounds of my late acquired wealth, (so
that I had two hundred pounds left, which I re-
posed with the captain's widow, who was an ho-
nest gentlewoman,) yet my misfortunes in this
unhappy voyage were very great. For our ship
sailing towards the Canary Islands, we were
chased by a Salee roveT; and in spite of all the
haste we could make, by crowding as much can-
vass as our yards could spread, or our masts
carry, the pirate gained upon us, so ihat we pre-
pared ourselves to fight. They had eighteen
guns, and we had but twelve. About three in
the afternoon there was a desperate engagement,
wherein many were killed and wounded on both
sides: but finding ourselves over-powered with
numbers, our ship disabled, and ourselves too
impotent to have the least hopes of success, we
were forced to surrender; and accordingly we
were all carried prisoners into the port of Salee.
Our men were sent to the Emperor's court to
be sold'there; but the pirate captain taking no-
tice of me, kept me to be his own slave.
In this condition, I thought myself the most
miserable creature on earth, and the prophesy of
my father came afresh into my thoughts. How-
ever, my condition, was better than I thought it
to be, as will soon appear. Some hopes, indeed,
I had that my new patron would go to sea again,
where he might be taken by a Spanish or Portu-
guese man of war, and then I should be set at
liberty. But in this I was mistaken; for he nev-
er took me with him, but left me to look after his
little garden, and do the drudgery of his house,
and when he returned from sea, would make me
lie in the cabin and look after the ship. I had no
one that I could communicate my thoughts to,
which were continually meditating my escape.
No Englishman, Irishman, or Scotchman here
but myself: and for two years I could see no-
thing practicable, but only pleased myself with
the imagination.
After some length of time, my patron as I
found, grew so poor, that he could not fit out hi*
ship as usual; and then he used constantly, once
or twice a week, if the weather was fair, to go
out a fishing, taking me and a young Moorish
boy to row the boat; and so much pleased was
ho with me for my dexterity in catching the fish,
that he would often send me with a Moor, who
was one of his kinsmen, and the youth before-
mentioned, to catch a dish of fish for him.
One morning, as we were at sport, there arose
such a thick fog, that we lost sight of the shore;
and rowing, we knew not which way, we labour-
ed all the night, and in the morning we found
ourselves in the ocean, two leagues from land.
However, we attained there at length, and made
the greatest haste, because our stomachs were
exceedingly sharp and hungry. In order to pre-
vent such disasters for the future, my pation or-
dered a carpenter to build a little state-room or
cabin in the middle of the long-boat: with a
place behind it to steer and haul home the main-
sheet, with other conveniences to keep him from
the weather, as also lockers to put in all manner
of provisions; with a handsome shoulder-ofi-
mutton sail gibing over the cabin.
In this, he frequently took us out a fishing;
and one time, inviting two or three persons of
distinction to go with him, laid in provisions ex-
traordinary; providing also three fusees, with
powder and shot, that they might have some
sport fowling along the sea-coast. The next
morning, the boat was made clean, her ancients
and pendants out, and every thing ready: but
their minds altering, my patron ordered us to go
a fishing, for that his guests would certainly sup
with him that night.
And now I began to think of my deliverance
indeed. In order to this, I persuaded the Moor
to get some provisions on board, and to procure
some powder and shot, pretending to kill sea-
curlews, which he innocently and readily agreed
to. In short, being provided with all things ne-
cessary, we sailed out.
When we had passed the castle, we fell to
fishing; but though I knew there was a bite, I
concealed the matter, in order to put farther out
to sea. Accordingly we ran a league farther,
when, giving the boy the helm, and pretending to
stoop for something, I seized Muley by surprise
and threw him overboard. As he was an excel-
lent swimmer, he soon arose and made towards
the boat; upon which I took out a fusee, and
presented it at him: " Muley," said I, " I never
yet designed to do you any harm, and seek no-
thing now but my freedom. I know you are
able enough to swim to shore, and save your life;
but if you are resolved to follow me to the en-
dangering of mine, the very moment you pro-
ceed, I will shoot you through the head." The
harmless creature, at these words, turned himself
from me and I make no doubt, got safe to land.
Then turning to the boy Xury, I perceived he
trembled at the action; but I put him out of all
fear telling him, that if ho would be true and
and faithful to me, I would do well by him and
not hurt him.
We then pursued our voyage: I kept to the
southward, to the truly Barbarian coast; but in
the dark of the evening, I changed my course,
that I might keep near the shore; and having a
fresh gale of wind, with a very pleasant smooth
sea, by three o'clock next day, I was one hundred
and fifty miles beyond the Emperor of Moroc-
co's dominions. I continued sailing for five days
successively, till such time as the wind shifting
to the southward, made me conclude, that if any
vessel was in chase of me, they would proceed
10 farther.
After so much fatigue and thought, I anchored
at the mouth of a little river, I knew not what or
where, neither did I then see any people. What
[ principally wanted was fresh water; and I was
resolved about the dusk of the evening to swim
ashore: but no sooner the gloomy clouds of
night began to succeed the declining day, than we
heard such barking, roaring, and howling of wild
creatures, that one might have thought the very
strongest monsters of nature had their residence
there. Poor Xury, who was almost dead with
fear, entreated me hot to go on shore that night.
"Suppose I don't Xury," said I, "and in the
morning we should see men who are worse than
those we fear, what then V "0 den we may
give, them the shoot gun," said he, laughing,
"and the gun make them all run away." The
wit, and broken English which the boy had learn-
ed among the captives of our nation pleased me
entirely, and made me still fonder of him than
before. We could get but little sleep all night
for the terrible howlings they made; and indeed
we were very much affrighted.
a
The next morning, I was resolved to go on
shore to get in fresh water, and venture myself
among the beasts or savages, should either at-
tack me. Xury said he would take one of the
jars and bring me some. I asked him why he
would go and not I? The poor boy answered,
"If wild mans come, they eat me, you go away."
This, indeed, increased my affection for the
child. "Well, dear Xury," said I, " we will
both go ashore, both kill wild mans, and they
shall eat neither of.us." So giving Xury a
piece of bread to eat, we waded ashore, carrying
nothing with us but our arms, and two jars for
water. I did not go out of sight of the boat, as
dreading the savages coming down the river
in their canoes: but the boy seeing a low de-
scent or vale about a mile in the country, he
wandered to it; and then running back to me
with great precipitation, I thought he was pur-
sued by some savages or wild beasts; upon
which I approached, resolving to perish, or pro-
tect him from danger. As he came nearer to me,
I saw something hanging wer his shoulder,
which was a creature he had shot, like a hare, but
different in colour, and with longer legs; how-
ever we were glad of it, for it proved wholesome
and nourishing meat; but what added to our joy
was, my boy assured me there was plenty of
water, and that he "saw no wild mans." And
greater still was our comfort when we found
fresh water in the creek where we were when the
tide was out, without going so far up into the
country.
In this place I began to hope that I should
meet some of the English trading vessels, who
would relieve anJ take us in.
The place I was in, was no doubt, that wild
country inhabited only by a few, that lies be-
tween the Emperor of Morocco's dominions and
the negroes. It is filled with wild beasts, and
the Moors use it for hunting chiefly. From this
place I thought I saw the top of the mountain
TenerhTe, in the Canaries, which made me try
twice to attain it, but as often was I driven back>
and so forced to pursue my fortune along shore.
Early one morning we came to an anchor
under a little point of land, but pretty high; and
the tide beginning to flow, we lay ready to go
further in; but Xury whose youthful and pene-
trating eyes were sharper than mine, in a soft
tone desired me to keep far from land, lest we
should be devoured ; " For look yonder master,
and see 'de dreadful monster fast asleep on de
side of de hill." Accordingly looking where he
pointed, I espied a fearful monster indeed. It
was a terrible great lion that lay on shore, cover-
ed as it were by a shade of a piece of the hill.
"Xury," said I, " you shall go on shore and kill
him." But the boy looked amazed. "Me kill
him!" says he, "he eat me at one mouth,"
meaning one mouthful. Upon which I bid him
lie still, and charging my biggest gun with two
slugs, and a good charge of powder, I took the
best aim I could to shoot him through the head;
»ut his leg lying over his nose, the slug broke his
Knee-bone. The lion awaking with the pain,
got up, but soon fell down, giving the most hide-
ous groan I ever heard; but taking my second
piece I shot him through the head, and then he
lay struggling for life. Upon this Xury took
heart, and desired my leave to go on shore.
'" Go then," said I. Upon which, taking a little
gun in one hand, he swam to shore with the
other, and coming close to the lion put a period
to his life, by shooting him again through the
head.
But this was spending our ammunition in vain',
the flesh not being good to eat. Xury was like
a champion, and comes on board for a hatchet to
cut off the head of his enemy; but wanting
strength to perform it, he cut off and brought me
a foot. I bethought me, however, that this skill
would be of use. This cost Xury and me a
whole day: when spreading it on the top of our
cabin, the hot beams of the sun effectually dried
it in two days time, and it afterwards served me
for a bed to lie on.
And now we sailed southerly, living sparingly
on our provisions, and went no oftener on shore
than we were obliged for fresh water, in hopes to
meet some European ship. If providence did
not favour me, my next course was to seek
for the islands, or lose my life among the ne-
groes; in a word, either I must rreet with some
ship, or certainly perish.
One day as we were sailing along, we saw
people stand on the shore looking at us; we
could also perceive they were black, and stark
naked. I was inclined to go on shore; but
Xury cried, No, no; however, I approached
nearer, and I found they ran along the shore
by me a long way. They had no weapons ki
\
their hands, except one, who held a long stick,
which Xury told me was a lance, with which they
could kill at a great distance. I talked to them
by signs, and made them sensible I wanted
something to eat; they beckoned to me to stop
my boat, while two of them ran up into the
country, and in less than half an hour came back
and brought with them two pieces of dry flesh,
and some corn, which we kindly accepted; and
to prevent any fears on either side, they brought
the food to the shore, laid it down, then went and
stood a great way off, till we fetched it on board
and then came close to us again.
But while we were returning thanks to them,
being all we could afford, two mighty creatures
came from the mountains, one as it were pursu-
ing the other with great fury, which we were the
rather inclmed to believe, as they seldom appear
but in the night, and both these swiftly passing
by the negroes, jumped into the sea, wantonly
swimming about, as though the diversion of the
waters had put a stop to their fierceness. At
last one of them coming nearer to my boat than
I expected, or desired, I shot him directly through
the head, upon which he sunk immediately, yet
rising again, he would have willingly made to the
shore, but between the wound and the struggling
of the water, he died before he could reach it.
It is impossible to express the consternation
the poor negroes were in at the firing of my gun;
much less can I mention their surprise, when
they perceived the creature to be slain by it. I
made signs to them to draw near it with a rope,
and then gave it to them to haul on shore. It
, 2*
- *
was a beautiful leopard, which made me desire
its skin; and the'negroes seeming to covet the
carcase, I freely gave it to them. As for the
other leopard, it made to shore, and ran with a
prodigious swiftness out of sight. The negroes
having kindly furnished me with water, and with
what roots and grains their country afforded, I
took my leave, and, after eleven days sail cams
in sight of the Cape de Verd. But the great
distance I was from it, and fearing contrary
winds would prevent me reaching them, I began
to grow melancholy and dejected, when upon a
sudden Xury cried out, " Master, Master," look-
ing as affrighted as if it was his master's ship
sent in search of us. But I soon discovered
she was a Portuguese ship. Upon which I strove
for life to come up to them. But in vain had
it been, if through their perspective glasses, they
had not perceived us, and shortened their sail to
let us come in. Encouraged at this, I set up my
patron's ancient, and fired a gun, both as signals
of distress; upon which they very kindly lay to,
so that in three hours time I came up with them.
They spoke to me in Portuguese, Spanish, and
French, but none of these did I understand, till
at length a Scots sailor called, and then I told him
I was an Englishman, who had escaped from the
Moors at Salee, upon which they took me kindly
on board, with all my effects.
Having a pleasant voyage to the Brazils, we
arrived in the Bay de Todos los Santos, or, All
Saints Bay, in twenty-two days after. And
here I cannot forget the generous treatment of
the captain. He would take nothing for my pas-
sage, gave me twenty ducats for the leopard's
skin, and thirty for the lion's. Every thing he
caused to be delivered, and what I would sell,
he bought. In short, I made 220 pieces of my
cargo, and with this stock I entered once more,
as I may say, into the scene of life.
To be brief, I bought a settlement next to an
honest and kind neighbour, born at Lisbon, of
English parents, whose plantation joining to
mine, we improved very amicably together. Both
our stocks were low: and for two years we
planted only for food; but the third year we
planted some tobacco, and each of us dressed
a large piece of ground the ensuing year for
planting sugar-canes.
I was in some measure settled> before the cap-
tain who took me up departed from the Brazils.
One day I went to him, and told him what stock
I had in London, desiring his assistance in get-
ting it sent out to me; to which the good gentle-
man readily'consented, but would only have me
send for half my money, lest it should miscarry,
which, if it did, I might still have the remainder
to support me; and so taking letters of procura-
tion from me, bid me trouble myself no further
about it.
And indeed, he not only procured the money
I had drawn for upon my captain's widow, but
sent me over a servant, with a cargo proportion-
able to my condition. He also sent me tools of
all sorts, iron work and utensils necessary for
my plantation.
Wealth now encreasing on me, and uncommon
success crowning my prosperous labours, I
might have rested happy in that middle state of
life my father so often recommended; yet no-
thing would content me. Having lived four
years in Brazil, I had not only learned the lan-
guage, but contracted acquaintance with the
most eminent planters, and even with the mer-
chants of St. Salvadore, three of whom came one
morning to me saying they had a secret proposal
to make. After enjoining me to secrecy * they
told me they had a mind to fit out a ship to go to
Guinea, in order to stock the plantation with ne-
groes, which as they could not be publicly sold,
they would divide among them; and if I would
go their supercargo in the ship, to manage the
trading part, I should have an equal share of the
negroes, without providing any stock. The thing
indeed was fair enough, had I been in another
condition: however, I could not resist the pro-
posal, but accepted the offer, upon condition of
their looking after my plantation.
The ship being fitted out, and all things ready,
we set sail the first of September 1659. We
sailed northward upon the coast, from whence
going farther into the ocean out of the sight of
land, we steered as though we were bound for
the island Fernand de Noremba, leaving the is-
lands on the east, and then it was we met with a
terrible tempest, which continued for twelve days
successively, so that the winds carried us where-
soever they pleased. In this perplexity one' of
our men died, and a man and a boy were washed
overboard. When the weather cleared up a lit-
tle, we found ourselves upon the coast of Guinea.
Upon this the captain gave reasons for returning;
which I opposed, counselling him to stand away
for Barbadoes, which as I supposed might be
attained in fifteen days. So altering our course,
we sailed north-west and by west in order to
reach the Leeward Islands; but a second storm
succeeding, drove us to the westward, so that wa
were justly afraid of falling into the hands of cru-
el savages, or the paws of the devouring beasts
of prey.
In this great distress, one of the men, early in
the morning, cried out, Land! land! which he
had no sooner said, than our ship struck upon a
sand bank, and, in a moment, the sea broke over
her in such a manner that we expected we should
perish immediately. We knew not where we
were, or upon what land we were driven, wher
ther it was an island, or the main, inhabited or
not inhabited, and we could not so much as hope
that the ship would hold out many minutes, withr
out breaking in pieces, unless the wind by a mir-
acle should turn about immediately. While we
stood looking at one another, expecting death
every moment, the mate lays hold of the boat, and
with the help of the rest got her flung over the
ship's side; into this we all got being eleven in
number, and committed ourselves to God's mer-
cy, and the wild sea. And now we saw that this
last effort would not be a sufficient protection
from death; so high did the sea rise, that it was
impossible the boat should live. As to making
a sail, we had none, neither if we had could we
make use of any. So that when we had rowed
or rather were driven about a league and a half,
a raging wave, like a lofty mountain came rolling
astern of us, and took us with such fury, that at
once it overset the boat. Thus being swallowed
up in a moment, we had only time to call upon
the awful name of God, and to implore, in dy*
ing ejaculations, his infinite mercy to receive our
departing souls.
Men are generally counted insensible, when
struggling in the pangs of death; but while I
was overwhelmed with water, I had the most
dreadful apprehensions imaginable, for the joys
of heaven, and the torments of hell, seemed to
present themselves before me in these dying
agonies, and even small space of time, as it were,
between life and death. I was going I thought
I knew not whither, in a dismal gulph unknown,
and as yet unperceived, never to behold my
friends, nor the light of this world any more! I
strove however to the last extremity, while all my
companions were overpowered and entombed in
the deep; and it was with great difficulty I kept
my breath till the wave spent itself, and, retiring
back, left me on the shore half dead with the wa-
ter I had taken in. As soon as I got on my feet,
I ran as fast as I could, lest another wave should
pursue me, and carry me back again. But for
all the haste I made, I could not avoid it, for the
sea came after me like a high mountain, or a fu-
rious enemy; so that my business was to hold
my breath, and by raising myself on the water,
to save myself by swimming. The next dread-
ful wave buried me at once twenty or thirty feet
deep, but, at the same time, carried me with a
mighty force and swiftness towards the shore,
when raising myself, I held out as well as possi*
bio, till, at length, the water having spent itself,
began to return, at which I struck forward, and
feeling ground again with my feet, I took to my
heels. "Thus being served twice more, I was at
last dashed against a piece of rock, in such a
manner as left me senseless, but recovering a
little before the return of the wave, which no
doubt would then overwhelm me, I held fast by
the rock till those succeeding waves abated; and
then fetching another run, was overtaken by a
small wave, which was soon conquered. But
before any more could overtake me, I reached
the main land, where clambermg up the cliffs of
the shore, tired and almost spent, I sat down on
the grass, free from the danger of the foaming
ocean.
No tongue can express the transports that my
soul felt at this happy deliverance. I was wrapt
up in contemplation, and often lifted up my hands
with the profoundest humility, jto the Divine
Power for saving my life; when the rest of my
companions were all drowned. And now I be-
gan to cast my eyes around, and to behold what
place I was in, and what I had next to do. I
could see no house nor people; I was wet, yet
had no clothes to shift me; hungry and thirsty,
yet had nothing to eat or drink, no weapon to
destroy any creature for my sustenance, nor de-
fend myself against devouring beasts; in short
I had nothing but a knife, a tobacco pipe, and a
box half filled with tobacco. The darksome
night coming upon me, increased my fears of
being devoured by wild creatures, my mind was
plunged into despair, and having no orosp.ect, as
I thought, of life before me, I prepared for ano-
ther kind of death than what I had lately escaped.
I walked about a furlong, to see if I could find
any fresh water, which I did, to my great joy;
and taking a quid of tobacco to prevent hunger,
I got up into a thick bushy tree, and seating my-
self so that I could not fall, a deep sleep over-
took me, and for that night, buried my sorrows
in a quiet repose.
It was broad day the next morning before I
awoke, when I not only perceived the tempest
was ceased, but saw the ship driven almost as
far as the rock before-mentioned, which was
about a mile from the place where I was.—
When I came down from my apartment in the
tree, I perceived the ship's boat two miles dis-
tant on my right hand, lying on shore as the
waves had cast her. I thought to have got t*
her; but there being an inlet of water about
half a mile's breadth between it and me, I re-
turned again towards the ship, as hoping to find
something for my more immediate subsistence.
About noon when the sea was so calm that I
could come within a quarter of a mile of her, it
was to my grief I perceived, that if we had kept
on board, all our lives would have been saved.
These thoughts,and my solitude, drew tears from
my eyes, though all in vain. So resolving to
get to the ship, I stripped and leaped into the
water; when swimming round her, I was afraid
I could not get any thing to lay hold of; but it
was my good fortune to espy a small piece of
rope hanging down so low, that, by the help of
it, though with great difficulty, I got into the ship.
Here I found that the ship was bilged, and had
a great deal of water in her, her stern was lifted
up against a bank, and her head almost in the
water. All her quarter, and what was there,
were free and dry. The provisions I found in
good order, and losing no time, ate while I was
doing other things. I also found some rum, of
which I took a little; and now I wanted for no-
thing except a boat, which indeed was all, to
can \ away what was needful for me.
Necessity occasions a quickness of thought.
We had several spare yards, a spare topmast or
two, and two or three large spars of wood. With
these I fell to work, and slung as many of them
overboard as I could manage, tying every one of
them with a rope that they might not drive away.
This done, I went down the ship's side and tied
four of them fast together at both ends, in form
of a raft, and laying two or three short pieces of
plank upon them cross ways, I found it would
bear me but not any considerable weight. Upon
which I went to work again, cutting a spare top-
mast into three lengths, adding them to mv rai't
with a great deal of labour and pains. I llren
Srst laying upon it all the planks and boards .
could get, next lowered down three of the sea-
men's chests after I had filled them with bread,
rice, three Dutch cheese, five pieces of dried
goat's flesh, and some European corn, what lit-
tle the rats had spared; and for liquors, I found
several cases of bottles, in which were some cor-
dial waters, and four or five gallons of arrack.
By this time the tide beginning to flow, I per-
ceived mv coa.t waistcoat and shir,t swini awar
3
Which I had left on shore; as for my linen
breeches and stockings, I swam with them to
the ship,; but I soon found clothes enough^
though I .took no more than I wanted for the
present. My eyes were chiefly on tools to work
with, and after a long search, I found out the
carpenter's cliest, iyhich I got safe down on my
raft. I then looked for arms and ammunition, and
in the great cabin, found two good fowling pieces;
two pistols, several powder horns filled, a small
bag of shot, arid two rusty swords. I likewise
found three barrels of powder, two of which
were good, but the third had taken water, also
two or three broken oars; two saws, ah axe, ana
a hammer. I then put to sea, and in getting to
shore had three encouragements. 1. A smooth
'calm sea: 2. The tide rising and setting in to the
shore: 3. The little wind there was, blowing
towards land. After I had sailed about a mile;
I found the raft driving a little distance from the
place where I first landed; and when I perceived
tin opening of the land, with a strong current of
the tide running into it, .Upon which I kept the
middle of the stream, But great was my con-
cern, when on a sudden the forepart of my raft
ran aground. But after some time, the rising of
the water caused the raft to float again, and com-
ing up a little river, with land on both sides, I
landed in a little cave, as near the mouth as pos-
sible, the better to discover a sail, if any such
providentially passed that way.
Not far off, I espied a hill of stupendous
height, surrounded with smaller hills about it,
Bad thither I was resolved to go and view the
country, that I might see what part was best to
fix my habitation in. Accordingly, arming my-
self with a pistol, a fowling piece, powder, and
ball, I ascended the mountain. There I per-
ceived I was in an island, encompassed by the
sea, no distant lands to be seen, but scattering
rocks that lay to the west; that it seemed to be
a barren place, and as I thought only inhabited
by wild beasts. I perceived abundance of fowls,
but was ignorant of what kind, or whether good
for nourishment. I shot one of them at my re-
i«rn, which occasioned a confused screaming
among the other birds, and I found it, by its co-
lour and beak, to be a kind of hawk, but its flesh
was tferfe.ct carrion.
"W hen I came to my raft I brought my effects
on. shore} which work spent that day entirely;
^nd fearing that some cruel beast might devour
me in the night time while I slept, I made a kind
of hut, or barricade, with the chests and boards I
had brought on shore. That night I slept very
'comfortably; and the next morning my thoughts
were employed to make a further attempt to the
ship, and bring away what necessaries I could
find, before another storm should break her in
pieces. Accordingly, I got on board as before*
and prepared a second raft far better than the
first; upon which, I brought away the carpen-
ter's stores, two or three bags full of nails, a
great jack-screw, a dozen or two of hatchets,
and a grind-stone. I also took two or three iron
crows, two barrels of musket-bullets, another
fowling piece, a small quantity of powder, and
a large hag full of small shot. Besides these, I
took all the men's clothes I could find, a spare
fore-top-sail, a hammock, and some bedding;
and thus completing my second cargo, I made all
the haste on shore I could, fearing some wild
beast might destroy what I had there already.
But I only found a little wild cat sitting on one
of the chests, who not seeming to fear me or the
gun that I presented at her, I threw her a piece of
biscuit, which she instantly ate and departed.
When I had got these effects on shore, I went
to work, in order to make me a little tent with
the sail and some poles, which I had cut for the
purpose, and having finished it, what things might
be damaged by the weather, I brought in, piling
all the empty chests and casks in a circle, the
better to fortify it against any sudden attempt of
man or beast. After this I blocked up the doors
with some boards, and an empty chest turned
the long way out. I then charged my gun and
pistol, and laying my bed on the ground, slept as
comfortably till the next morning, as though I had
been in a christian countrv.
Now, though I had enough to subsist me a
long time, yet despairing of a sudden deliver-
ance, and fearing that both ammunition and pro-
vision might be spent before such a thing hap-
pened, I saved as much as I could, and so long
as the ship remained in that condition, I daily
brought away one necessary or other; particu-
larly, the rigging, sails, and cordage, some.twine,
a barrel of wet powder, some sugar, a barrel of
meal, three casks of rum, and indeed what was
most welcome to me, a whale hogshead of
bread.
The next time I went, I cut the cables in
pieces, carried off a hawser whole, with a great
deal of iron work, and made another raft; but
this being so imwieldy, by the too heavy burden
upon it, and I not being able so dexterously to
guide it as the former, both my cargo and myself
were overturned. For my part all the damage
I sustained was a wet skin ;. and at low water,
after much labour in diving, I got up most of the
cables; and some pieces of iron. Thirteen days
had I now been on the island, and eleven days
on board, bringmg away all that was possible.
As I was going the twelfth time, the wind began
to rise; however, I ventured at low water, and
rummaging the cabin, in a locker, I found seve-
ral razors, scissors, and some dozens of knives
dnd forks, and in another, thirty-six pounds in
pieces of eight, silver and gold. I wrapt the mo-
up in a piece of canvas, arid began to think of
making another raft; but I soon perceived the
wind beginning to rise, a fresh gale blowing from
the shore; and the sky overcast with clouds and
darkness. So thinking a raft to be in vain, I let
myself into the water with what things I had
about me; and it was with great difficulty I got
ashore, when soon after it blew a fearful storm.
That night I slept very contentedly in my little
tent, surrounded with\all my effects; but when I
looked out in the morning, no more ship was to
be- seen. This much surprised me for the pre-
sent: yet, when I considered that I had lost no
time, abated no pains, and had got every thing
useful out of her, I comforted myself in the best
3*
i in
manner, and entirely submitted to divine Provi-
dence.
My next thoughts were, how I should defend
and secure myself from savages and wild beasts,
if any such were in the island.
"When I considered the ground where I was.
that it was marshy, and had no fresh water near
it, my resolutions were to search for a soil heal-
thy and well watered, where I might not only be
shekel ed from the sun's scorching heat, but be
more conveniently situated, as well to be secur-
ed from wild men, and beasts of prey, as more
easily to discover any distant sail, should it ever
so happen.
And indeed it was not long before I had my
desire. I found a little plain near a rising hill,
the front towards which, being as steep as a
house-side, nothing could descend on me from
the top.
On the side of this rock was a little hollow
place, resembling the entrance or door of a cave.
Just before this place, on the circle of the green.
I resolved my tent should stand. This plain did
not much exceed a hundred yards broad, and
about twice as long, like a delightful green before
my door, with a pleasing, though irregular de-
scent every way to the low grounds by the sea
side, sheltered from the excessive heat of the
«un. After this, I drew a simicircle, twenty
yards in diameter, driving down two rows of
strong stakes not six inches from each other.
Then, with the pieces of cable which I had cut
onboard, I regularly laid them in a circle between
the piles, up to their tops, which were more than
five feet out of the earth, .and then drove another
row of piles, looking within side against them,
between two or three feet high, which made me
conclude it a little castle, impregnable by men
and beasts. And for my better security I would
have no door, but entered in and came out by the
help of a ladder, which I abo made.
Here was my fence and fortress, into which I
carried all my riches, ammunition and stores.
After which, working on the rock, what with the
dirt and stones I dug out, I not only raised my
ground two feet, but made a little cellar to my
mansion-house; and this cost me many days la-
bour and pains. One day in particular, a show-
er of rain falling, thunder and lightning ensued,
which put me in terror lest my powder should
take fire, and not only hinder my necessary sub-
sistence, by killing my food, but even blow up
me and my habitation. To prevent which, I fell
to making boxes and bags, in order to separate
it, having by me near 1501b. weight. And thus
being established as king of the island, every day
I went out with my gun to see what I could kill
that was fit to eat. 1 soon perceived numbers of
goats, but very shy; yet having watched them
narrowly, and seeing I could better phoot off the
rocks than when in the low grounds, I happened
to shoot a she-goat suckling a young kid; which,
not thinking its dam slain, stood by her uncon-
cerned; and when I took the dead creature up,
the young one followed me even to the enclosure.
I lifted the kid over the pales, and would willing-
ly have kept it alive, but finding it could not be
mi
brought to eat, I was forced to slay it also for my
subsistence.
Thus, entered into as strange a state as ever
any man was in, I had most melancholy appre-
hensions concerning my deplorable condition;
and many times the tears would plentifully run
down my face, when I considered how I was de-
barred from all communication with human kind.
Yet while these desponding cogitations would
seem to make me accuse Providence, other good
thoughts would interpose and reprove me after
this manner ; >' Well, supposingyou are desolate,
is it not better to be so, than totally perish 1 Why
should you complain, when not only your life is
preserved, but the ship driven into your reach, in
order to take what was necessary out of her for
a subsistence V But to proceed: it was, by the
account I kept, the thirtieth of September, when
I first landed on this island. About twelve days
after, fearing lest I should lose my reckoning of
time, nay even forget the sabbath days for want
of pen, ink, and paper, I carved with a knife up-
on a large post, in great letters, I came on shore,
Sep. 30, 1659, and set it up in the similitude of
a cross, on the sea shore where I landed. Every
day I cut a notch with my knife on the sides
of the square post, and that on the sabbath was
as long again as the rest, and every first day of
the month as long again as that long one. la
this manner I kept my calendar, weekly, month-
ly, or yearly reckoning of time. But had I
made a more strict search (as I did afterwards,)
I need not have set up this mark. For among
,tf»e parcels belonging to the gunner, carpenter,
and captain's mate, I found those very things I
wanted; particularly pens, ink, and paper; al-
so I found two or three compasses, some mathe-
matical instruments, dials, perspective glasses
books of navigation, three English Bibles, and
several other good books, which I carefully put
up. Here I cannot but call to mind, our having
a dog and two cats on board, whom I made in-
habitants with me in my castle. Though one
might think 1 had all the necessaries that were
desirable, yet still I found several things wanting.
My ink was daily wasting: I wanted needles,
pins, and thread, to mend or keep my clothes to-
gether: and particularly a spade, pick-axe, or
shovel, to remove the earth. It was a year be-
fore I finished my little bulwark; and having
some intervals of relaxation, after my daily wan-,
dering abroad for provision, I drew up this plan
alternately, as creditor and debtor, to remind me
of the miseries and the blessings of my hfe, under
so many v.arious circumstances.

LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF
Like- a hermit (ra-
ther should I say a
lonely anchorite,) am I
forced from human
conversation.
My clothes, after
some time will be worn
out, and then I shall
have none to cover
When my ammuni-
tion is wasted, then
shall I remain without
any defence against
wild men and beasts.
I have no creature,
no soul to speak to;
none to beg assistance
from. Some comfort
would it be to resound
my woes where I am
understood, and beg
assistance where I
might hope for relief.
However, I have
food to eat, and even
a happy prospect of
subsistence whilst life
endures.
At present I enjoy
what is absolutely
needful; and the cli-
mate is so hot, that
had I ever so many
I should hardly wear
them.
Yet even thus, I see
no danger of any to
hurt me, as in Africa;
and what if I had been
cast away upon that
coast.
Is there not God to
converse with, and is
not he able to deliver
thee? already has he af-
forded thee sustenance
and put it in thy powei
to provide for thyself,
till he sends thee a de-
liverance.
And now, easing my mind a little by these re-
flections, I began to render my life as easy as
possible.
I must here add to the description I have
given of my habitation, that having raised a turt
wall against the outside of it, I thatched it so
close as might keep it from the inclemency of
the weather; I also improved it within, enlarged
my cave, and made a passage and a door in the
rock, which came out beyond the pale of my
fortification. I next proceeded to make a chair
and table, and so began to study such mechanical
arts as seemed to me practicable. When I
wanted a plank or board, I hewed down a tree
with my hatchet, making it as thin with my axe as
possible, and then smooth enough with an adze,to
answer my designs; yet though I could make no
more this way than one board out of a tree, in
length of time I got boards enough to shelter all my
stores, every thing being regularly placed, and my
guns securely hanging against the side of a rock.
This made it a very pleasant sight to me, being
the result of vast labour and great diligence;
which leaving for a while, and me to the enjoy-
ment of, I shall give the reader an account of
some parts of my journal from the day of my
landing, till the setting of my habitation, as
heretofore shown.
JOURNAL.
September 30th, 1659,1, unhappy Robinson
Crusoe, havmg suffered shipwreck, was driven
on this desolate island, which I named the
Desolate Island of Despair, the rest of my com-
panions being swallowed up in the tempestuous
ocean. The next day I spent in consideration
of my unhappy circumstances, having no pros-
peet but of death, either to be starved with hun-
ger, or devoured by wild beasts or merciless
savages.
Oct. 1. That morning, with great comfort, I
beheld the ship drove ashore. Some hopes I
had, that when the storm was abated I might be
able to get some food and necessaries out of
her; which I conceived were not damaged, be-
cause the ship did stand upright. At this time,
I lamented the loss of my companions, and our
misfortune in leaving the vessel. When I per-
ceived the ship, as it were) to lie dry, I waded
through the sands, then swam aboard, the wea-
ther being very rainy, and with scarcely any
wind.
To the 14th of this month,' my time was em-
ployed in making voyages every tide; getting
what I could out of the ship: The weather very
wet and uncertain.
Oct. 25. My raft, and all the goods thereon
were overset; yet I recovered most again at low
water.
Oct. 25. It blew hard, and rained night and
day, when the ship went in pieces, so that nothing
was seen of her but the wreck at low water.
This day I secured my goods from the incle-
mency of the weather.
Oct. 26. I wandered to see where I could
find a place convenient for my abode: I fixed
upon a rock in the evenings marked out a half
moon-, intending to erect a wall fortified with
piles, lined within with pieces of cables, and
covered with turf.
Nov. 3. I shot two wild-fowls^ resembling
i - =i
ducks, which were good to eat, and in the after-
noon made me a table.
Nov. 4. I began to live regularly. In the'
morning I allowed myself two or three hours to
Walk out with my gun; I then worked till near
eleven o'clock; and afterwards refreshed myself
with what I had to eat. From twelve to two, I
would lie down to sleep. Extreme sultry
Weather. In the evening go to work again.
Nov. 5. Went out with my gun and dog, shot
i wild cat with a soft skin, but her flesh was good
for nothing. The skins of those killed I pre-
served. On my return I perceived many wild
birds, and was terrified by some seals which
made off to sea.
Nov. 6. Completed my table.
Nov. 7. Fair weather. I worked to the 12th,
but omitted the llth> which according to my
calculation* I supposed to be Sunday.
Nov. 17. I began to dig in the rock, yet was
obliged to desist for want of a pick-axe, shovel
and wheel-barrow. Iron crows I used to supply
the place of the first, but with all my art I could
not make a wheel-barrow.
Nov. 19. It was my fortune to find a tree re-
sembling what the Brazilians call an iron tree.
I had like to spoil my laxe with cutting it, it
being very hard, and exceedingly heavy; yet
with much labour and industry I made a sort of
spade out of it.
Nov. 23. These tools being made, I daily
carried on my business; eighteen days I allowed
for enlarging my cave, that it might serve me,
'not only for a ware-house, but kitchen, parlour
4
and cellar. I commonly lay in the tent, unless
the weather was so rainy that I could not lie dry.
So wet would it be at certain seasons, that I
was obliged to cover all within the pale with long
poles, in the form of rafters, leaning against the
rock, and load them with flags and large leaves
of trees resembling a thatch.
Dec. 10. No sooner did I think my habitation
fmished, but suddenly a great deal of the top
broke in, so that >t was a mercy I was not buried
in the ruins. This occasioned a great deal of
pains and trouble to me before I could make it
firm and durable.
Dec. 17. I nailed up some shelves, and drove
nails and staples in the wall and posts, to hang
every thing out of the way.
Dec. 20. Every thing I got into its place,
then made a sort of dresser, and another table.
Dec. 27. I chanced to light on some goats,
shot one, wounded another; I led it home in a
string, bound up its leg, and cured it in a little
time; at length, it became so tame and familiar
as to feed before the door, and follow me where
I pleased. This put me, in mind to bring up
tame creatures, in order to supply me with food
after my ammunition was spent.
Dec. 28, 29, 30. The weather being exces-
sively hot, with little air, obliged me for the
most part to keep within doors.
Jan. 3, to 14. My employment this time
was to finish the wall before described, and
search the island. I discovered a kind of pi-
geons, like our house-pigeons, in a nest among
the rocks. I brought them home, nursed them
till they could fly, and then they left me. Af->
ter this* I shot some, which proved excellent
food. Some time I spent vainly contriving to
make a cask, I may well say it was in vain, be-
cause I could neither joint the staves, nor fix
the heads, so as to make it tight; so leaving
that, I took some goats tallow I had by me,
and a little oakum for the wick, and provided
myself with a lamp, which served instead of
candles.
But now a very strange event happened. For
being in the height of my search, what should
come into my hand, but a bag which was used
to hold corn (-as I supposed,) for the fowls; so
immediately resolving to put gunpowder into it,
I shook all the husks and dirt upon one side of
a rock, little expecting what the consequence
would be. The rain had fallen plentifully a
few days before; and about a month after, to
my great amazement, something began to look
out very green and flourishing; and when I
came to view it more nicely, every day as it
grew, I found aboit ten or twelve ears of green
barley of the very same shape and make as that
in England.
I can scarcely express the agitation of my
mind at this sight. Hitherto, I had looked
upon the actions of this life no otherwise than
only as the events of blind chance, and fortune.
But now, the appearance of this barley, flour-
ishing in a barren soil, and my ignorance in
not conceiving how it should come there, made
me conclude, "that miracles were not yet ceas-
ed;" nay, I even thought that God had appoint-
==- r=at
ed it to grow there without any seed, purely for
my sustenance in this miserable and desolate
island. And indeed such great effect had this
upon me, that it often made me melt into tears
through a grateful sense of God's mercies; and
the greater still was my thankfulness, when I
perceived about this little field of bailey, some
ride stalks, also wonderfully flourishing.
While thus pleased in mind, I concluded
there must be some more corn in the island;
and therefore made a diligent search narrowly
among the rocks; but not being able to fina
any, on a sudden it came into my mind, how I
had shaken the husks of corn out of the bag
and then my admiration ceased, with my grati-
tude to the Divine Being, as thinking it was but
natural, and not to be conceived a miracle;
though even the manner of its preservation
might have made me own it as a wonderful
event of God's kind providence.
It was about the latter end of June when the
ears of the corn ripened, which I laid up very
carefully, together with 20 or 30 stalks of rice;
expecting one day I should reap the fruit of
my labour; yet four years were expired before
I could allow myself to eat any barley bread,
and much longer time before I had any rice.
After this, with indefatigable pains and indus-
try for three or four months, at last I finished
my house on the 14th of April, having no way
to go into it, but by a ladder against the wall.
-April 16. I finished my ladder, and ascended
it; afterwards pulled it up, then let it down on
the other side, and descended into my new ha-
ROBINSON CRUSOE. 41
bitation, where I had space enough, and so forr
tified, that nothing could attack me without
scaling the walls.
But what does all human art and industry
avail, if the blessing of God does not crown
our labours? Or who can stand before the Al-
mighty, when he stretcheth forth his arm? For
one time as I was at the entrance of my cave,
there happened such a dreadful earthquake,
that not only the roof of the cave came tumbling
about my ears, but the posts seemed to crack
terribly at the same time. This put me in a
great amazement; and running to the ladder
and getting over the wall, I then plainly knew
it was an earthquake, the place I stood on sus-
taining three terrible shocks in less than three
minutes. But judge of my terror when I saw
the top of a great rock roll into the sea; I then
expected the island would be swallowed up
every moment: and what made the scene still
more dreadful, was to see the sea thrown into
the most violent agitations and disorders by this
tremendous accident.
For my part, I expected every moment to be
swallowed up. At the moving of the earth, I
was, as it were, sea-sick; and very much afraid
lest the rock, under which was my fence and
habitation, should overwhelm me and it in a
lasting tomb.
It was not long after, when a horrible tem-
pest arose at the same time attended with a
hurricane of wind. Three hours did this storm
continue, and in so violent a manner as to tear
the very trees up by the roots, which was suc»
4»
ceeded by abundance of rain. When the tem-
pest was over, I went to my tent; but the rain
coming on in a furious manner, I was obliged
to take shelter in the cave, where I was forced
to cut a channel through my fortification, to
let the water out. It continued raining all that
night, and some time the next day. These ac-
cidents made me resolve, as soon as the wea-
ther cleared up, to build me a little hut in some
open place, walled round, to defend me from
wild creatures and savages; not doubting, but
at the next earthquake, the mountain would
fall on my habitation and me, and swallow, up
all in its bowels.
April 16—20. These days I spent in con-
triving how and in what, manner I should fix
my place of abode. All this while, I was unr
der the most dreadful apprehensions. When
I looked round my habitation, every thing I
found in its proper place. I had several de-
bates whether I should move or not; but at
length resolved to stay where I was, till I
found out a convenient place where I might
pitch my tent.
April 22. When I began to put my resolu-
tions in practice, I was stopped for want of
tools and instruments to work with. Most of
my axes and hatchets were useless, occasioned
by cutting the hard timber that grew on the
island. It took me up a full week to make my
grindstone of use to me; and at last I found
out a way to turn it about with my foot, by help
of a wheel and a string.
April 30. My bread falling short, I allow-
ed myself but one biscuit a day.
May 1. As I walked along the sea-shore
I found a barrel of gunpowder, and sevem,
pieces of the wreck which the sea had flung up.
Having secured these, I made to the ship, who.su
stern was torn off, and washed a great distance
ashore; but the rest lay in the sands. This, 1
suppose, was occasioned by the earthquake. I
now resolved to keep my old place of abode:
and also to get to the ship that day, but found
it impossible.
May 3. This day I went on board, and with
my saw sawed off one of the beams, which kept
her quarter-deck. I then cleared the sand till
flood.
May 4. I caught some fish, but they wero
not wholesome. The same day, I also caught
a young dolphin.
May 5. This day also I repaired to the
wreck, and sawed another piece of timber,
and when the flood came, I made a float of
three great planks, which were driven ashorn
by the tide.
May 6—9. These days, I brought off the
iron bolts, opened the deck with the iron crow,
and carried two planks to land, having made a
way into the very middle of the wreck.
May 10—13. All this time I spent in bring-
ing off great quantities of iron and timber.
May 15. Took with me two hatcheta oa
purpose to cut off some lead from the roll but
.all in vain, for it lay too low under water.
May 24. To this day, I worked on th»
wreck, and with great difficulty loosened some
things so much with the crow, that at the first
blowing tide, several casks floated out, and se-
veral of the seamen's chests; yet that day no-
thing came to land but pieces of timber, and a
nogshead which had some pork in it. I con-
tinued working to the 15th of June; (except
necessary times for food and rest,) and had I
known how to build a boat, I had timber and
planks enough; I had also near 100 weight of
sheet lead.
June 16. As I was wandering towards the
sea-siide, I found a large tortoise or turtle, be-
ing the first I had seen on the island, though,
as I afterwards found, there were many on the
other side of it.
June 17. This day I spent in cooking it,
found in her threescore eggs, and her flesh the
most savory and pleasant I ever tasted in my
life.
June 18. I staid within this day, there be-,
ing a continual rain; and it was somewhat
more chilly and cold than usual.
June 19. Exceedingly ill, taken with a
trembling and shivering.
June 20. Awake all night, my head racked
with pain, and feverish.
June 21. Sick unto death, and terrified
with dismal apprehensions of my condition.
Prayed to God more frequently, but very con-
fusedly.
June 22. Something better, but still uneasy
in my mind.
June 23. Again relapsed much as before.
June 24. Mended a second time.
June 25. A violent ague for seven hours,
cold and hot fits, succeeded with faint sweats.
June 26. Better, but very weak; yet I
scrambled out, shot a she goat, brought it
home, and broiled some of it; I would wil-
lingly have stewed it and made some broth,
but had no pot.
June 27. All this day I was afflicted with
an ague; thirsty, yet could not help myself to
water; prayed to God in these words: "Lord;
in pity look upon me: Lord, have mercy upon
/ne, have mercy upon me!" After this I fell
asleep, which, when I awaked, I found had
much refreshed me.
I rose up, in a pensive manner, being so
thoughtful that I could not go to sleep: and
fearing the dreadful return of my distemper, it
caused me to remember, that the Brazilians
use tobacco for almost all diseases. I then
went to my chest, m order to find some, where
heaven, no doubt, directed me to find a cure,
both for soul and body; for there I found one
of the bibles, which, till this time, I had neither
leisure nor inclination to look into; I took
both the tobacco and that out of my chest, and
laid them on the table. Several experiments did
I try with the tobacco. First, I took a piece of
leaf, and chewed it; but it being very green
and strong, almost stupified me: next I steep-
ed it in some rum an hour or two, resolving
when I went to bed, to take a dose of it: and,
in the third place, I burnt soma over a pan of
fire, holding my nose over it so long as I could
endure it without suffocation.
In the intervals of this operation, though my
head was giddy and disturbed by the tobacco,
I took up the Bible to read. No sooner did I
Open, but there appeared to me these words,
"Call on me in the day of trouble and I will
deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me."
At first, this sentence made a very deep im-
pression on my heart: but it soon wore off
again when I considered the word " deliver" was
foreign to me. And as the children of Israel
said, when they were promised flesh to eat,
'* Can God spread a table in the wilderness V in
the like manner I began to say, Can God him-
self deliver me from this desolate Island? How-
ever, the words would still return to my mind,
and afterwards made a greater impression upon
me. As it now was very late, and the tobacco
had dozed my head, I was inclined to sleep;
but before I would lie down, I fell on my knees,
and implored the promise that God had made to
me in the holy Scriptures, that " if I called on
him in the day of trouble, he would deliver me."
With much difficulty I afterwards drank the
rum, wherein I had steeped the tobacco, which
flying into my head,- threw me into such a
profound sleep, that it was three o'clock the
next day before I awoke; or rather I believe, I
slept two days, having certainly lost a day in my
account, and I could never tell any other way.
When I got up, my spirits were lively and
cheerful; my stomach much better, being very
hungry; and, in short no tit returned the next
day, which was the 29th, but I found myself
much altered for the better.
July 3. The fit quite left me, but very weak.
In this condition, I often thought of these
words, "I will deliver thee:" and while at
sometimes I would think of the impossibility of
it, other thoughts would reprehend me, for
disregarding the deliverances I had received
even from the most forlorn and distressed con-
dition. I asked myself, what regard have I had
to God for his abundant mercies? Have I
done my part? *' He 'has delivered me, but I
have not glorified him;" as if I had said I had
riot owned and been thankful for these as de-
liverances, 'and how could I expect greater?
So much did this sensibly touch my heart, that
I ga<ve God thanks for my recovery from sick-
ness in the most humble posture.
-July 4. This morning I began seriously to
ponder on what is written in the New Testament,
resolving to read a chapter every morning and
night, as long as my thoughts would engage me
As soon as I set about this work seriously, 1
found my heart deeply affected with the impiety
of my past life. After this, I begged of God
to assist me with his holy Spirit in returning to
my duty. One day, in perusing the Scriptures,
I came to these words, "He is exalted a Frince
and a Saviour, to give repentance, and to give
remission:" Immediately I laid down the
book, and, with uplifted hands to heaven, loudly
•cried, " 0 'blessed Jesus, thou son of David!
'testis, thou exalted Priaoe and Saviour, give
hie repentance:" And, now indeed, I prayed
with a true sense of my condition, and a more
Certain hope, founded on the word of God. Now
J had a different sense of these words, "Call on
me, and I will deliver thee," that is from the
dreadful load of guilt, which oppressed my sinful
soul, and not from a solitary life: in a word* I
came to this conclusion, that a deliverance from
sin was a much greater blessing than a deliver-
ance from affliction.
To the 14th of July, I walked about with my
gun, little and little at a time, having been re-
duced to the greatest extremity of weakness^.
The applications and experiments I used were
perfectly new: neither could I recommend them
to any one's practice. For though it carried off
the fit, it very much weakened me; and I had
frequently convulsions in my nerves and limbs
for some time. From hence I learned, that
going abroad in rainy weather, especially when
it was attended with storms and hurricanes of
wind was most pernicious to health. I had now
been above ten months in the island; and as I
never had seen any of the human kind, I
therefore accounted myself as sole monarch;
and as I grew better, having secured my habita-
tion to my mind, I resolved to make a tour round
my kingdom, in order to make new discoveries.
The 15th of July, I began my journey. I
first went to the creek, where I had brought my
rafts on shore: and travelling farther found the
tide went no higher than two miles up, where
there was a little brook of running water, on the
bank of which were many pleasant savannahs
or meadows, smooth, plain and covered with
grass. On the rising parts, where I supposed
the water did not reach, I perceived a great deal
of tobacco growing to a very strong stalk.
Several other plants I likewise found, the virtue
of which I did not understand. I searched a
long time for the cassava root, which I knew the
Indians in that climate made their bread of; but
all in vain. There were several plants of aloes,
though at that time I knew not what they were:
likewise I saw several sugar-canes, but imperfect
for want of cultivation. With these few disco-
veries, I came back that night, and slept con-
tentedly in my little castle.
The next day, being the 16th, going the same
way, but farther than the day before, I found the
country more adorned with woods and trees.
Here I perceived different fruits in great abun-
dance. Melons in plenty lay on the ground, and
clusters of grapes, ripe and very rich, spread
over the trees. You may imagine 1 was glad of
this discovery, yet ate very sparingly, lest I
should throw myself into a -flux or fever. The
grapes I found of excellent use; for when t
dried them in the sun, which preserved them as
dried rasins are kept, they proved very whole-
some and nourishing, and served me in those
seasons when no grapes were to be had.
The night drawing on apace, I ascended up a
tree, and slept very comfortably, though it was
the first time I had slept out of my habitation.
And when the morning came, I proceeded
^ith (great pleasure on my way, travelling about
?«>u> miles, as I imagmed, by the length of the
5
Valley. At the end of this valley I came to an
opening, where the country seemed to descend
to the west; there I found a spring of fresh
water, proceeding out of the side of the hill,
with its crystal streams running directly east.
And indeed here my senses were charmed
with the most beautiful landscape nature could
afford; for the country appeared so flourishing,
green and delightful, that to me it seemed like a
planted garden. I then descended on the side
of that delicious vale, when I found abundance
of cocoa, orange, lemon, and citron trees, but
very wild and barren at that time. As for the
limes, they were delightful and wholesome, the
juice of which I afterwards used to mix in water,
which made it very cool and refreshing. And
now I was resolved to carry home and lay up a
store of grapes, limes and lemons, against the
approaching wet season. So laying them up in
separate parcels, and then taking a few of each
with me, I returned to my little castle, after
having spent three days in this journey. Be-
fore I got home, the grapes were so bruised that
they were utterly spoiled: the limes indeed
were good, but of those, I could bring only a
few.
July 19. Having prepared two bags, 1 re-
turned thither again, but lo my great surprise,
fownd all the grapes spread about, trod to pieces,
and abundance eaten, which made me conclude
there were wild beasts thereabouts. To prevent
this happening again, I gathered a large quantity
of the grapes, and hung them upon the out
branches of the tree, both to keep them unhurt,
and tlvat they might cure and dry in the sun; and
having well loaded myself with limes and lemons,
I returned once more to my old olace of resi-
dence.
And now, reflecting on the fruitfulness of this
valley, the pleasantness of its situation, its
recurity from storms, and the delightfulness of
the adjacent woods, I concluded I was settled in
the worst part of the country, and therefore was
thinking to remove my habitation.
lint when I considered again, that though it
was pleasant, it was off from the sea-side, where
there Was a possibility, some time or other, a
ship might either be driven or sail by; and that
to inclose myself among hills and woods must
certainly put an end to my hopes of deliverance;
I resolved to let my castle remain where Provi-
dence had first placed it. Yet, so delighted was
I with this place, that I made me a little kind of
bower, surrounding it with a double hedge, as
high as I Could reach, well staked and filled with
bulrushes : and having spent a great part of the
month of July, I think it was the first of A ugust
before I began to enjoy my labour.
Jlugusl 3. Perceiving my grapes to be dry,
I took them from the trees, and they proved ex-
cellent good raisins of the sun: the most of
which I carried to my cave: and happy for me I
did so, by which I saved the best part of my
winter food.
Jhigust 14. This day it began to rain; and
though I had made me a tent like the other, yet
having no shelter of a hill to keep me from
•terms, nor a cave behind me to retreat to, I
was obliged to return to my old castle, the rain
continued more or less every day, till the middle
of October; and sometimes so violently, that I
could not stir out of my cave for several days.
This season I found my family to increase;
for one of my cats that had run away from me,
and which I thought had been dead, returned
about August, with three kittens at her heels,
like herself ; from these cats proceeded such
numbers, that I was forced to kill and destroy
them as I would do wild beasts or vermin.
To the 26th of this month, I could not stir out,
it raining incessantly; when beginning to want
food, I was compelled to venture twice, the first
of which times I shot a goat, and afterwards
found a very large tortoise. The manner of
regulating my food was thus: a bunch of raisins
served me for my breakfast; a piece of goats
flesh or turtle boiled for my dinner, and two or
three turtle eggs for my supper. While the rain
lasted, I daily worked two or three hours at
enlarging my cave, and, by degrees worked it
on towards one side of the hill, and made a
door or way out, which came beyond my fence
or wall, and so I came in and out this way.
But after I had done this, I was troubled to see
myself thus exposed; though I could not per-
ceive any thing to fear, a goat being the biggest
creature I had seen upon this island.
September 30. Casting up the notches on my
post, they amounted to 365, I concluded this to
be the anniversary of my landing; and there-
fore, humbly prostrating myself on the ground
-confessing my sins, acknowledging God'*
righteous judgments upon me, and praying to
Jesus Christ to have mercy upon me, I fasted for
twelve hours till the going down of the sun;
and then eating a biscuit and a bunch of grapes,
laid me on a bed, and with great comfort took
my night's repose. Till this time, I seldom had
distinguished the Sabbath-day; but now I made
a longer notch than ordinary for the days of
rest, and divided the weeks as well as I could,
though I found I had lost a day or two in my
account. My ink failing soon after, I omitted
in my daily memorandum, things of an indif-
ferent nature, and contented myself to write down
only the most remarkable events of my life.
The rainy and dry seasons appeared now regular
to me, and experience taught me how to provide
for them; yet in one thing I am going to relate,
my experience very much failed me. You may
call to mind, what I have mentioned of some
barley and rice which I had saved; about thirty
stalks of the former, and twenty of the latter;
and, at that time, the sun's being in its southern
position, going from me, together with the rains,
made me conclude it a very proper season to
sow it. Accordingly I dug up a piece of ground,
with my wooden spade, and dividing it in two
parts, sowed about two thirds of my seed, pre-
serving by me a handful of each. And happy it
was I did so; for no rains falling, it was choked
up, and never appeared above the earth till the
wet season came again, and then part of it grew,
as if it had been newly sown.
I was resolved still to make another trial; and
.asking for a moister piece of ground near my
5*
bower, I there sowed the rest of my seed in Feb-
ruary, which, by having the rainy months of
March and April to water it, yielded a noble
crop, and sprung up very pleasantly. I had still
saved part of the seed, not daring to venture
all; and by the time I found out the proper
seasons to sow it in, and that I might expect
every year two seed-times and two harvests, my
stock amounted to above half a peck of each sort
of grain.
No sooner were the rains over, but the stakes
which I had cut from the trees, shot out like
willows, the first year after lopping their heads.
I was ignorant of the tree I cut them from; but
they grew so regularly beautiful, that they made-
a most lively appearance, and so flourished in
three years time, that I resolved to cut more of
them; and these soon growing made a glorious
fence, as afterwards I shall observe.
And now I perceived that the seasons of the
year might generally be divided, not into sum-
mer and winter, as in Europe, but into wet, and
dry seasons, as in this manner.
From ( February 15, i Rainy, sun coming near
To ( April 15, J the Equinox, 2 months.
From ( Jipril 15, | On/, sun getting north
To ( August 15, ) from the line, 4 months.
From ( August 15, > Wet, the. sun being thev
To ( October 15, ) come back, 2 monllis.
From ( October 15, \ Dry, sun running south
To ) February 15, ) of the line 4 months.
The wet seasons would contmue longer or
shorter, as the wind continued or ceased to blow.
3ut having found the ill consequences of be^
iug abroad in the rain, I took care before hand to
furnish myself with provisions: and, during the
wet months, sat within doors as much as pos-
sible. At this time I contrived to make many
handy things that I wanted, though it cost me
much labour and pains, before I could accom-
plish them. The first I tried was to make a
basket; but all the twigs I could get, proved so
brittle, that I could not then perform it. It now
proved of great use to me, that when a boy, I
took great delight in standing at a basket ma-
ker's, in the same town where my father lived, tQ
view his men at work: like other boys, being
curious to see the manner of their working these
things, and very officious to assist, I perfectly
learned the method of it, and wanted nothing
but the tools. And it coming into my mind, that
the twigs of that tree of which I made my stakes,
might be as tough as a sallow, willow, or
osiers growing in England, I resolved to make
an experiment, and wenj the next day to my
country seat, and found some fit for my turn;
and after cutting down a quantity with my hat-
chet, I dried them in my pale, and when fit to
work with, carried them to my cave, where t
employed myself in making several sorts of bas-
kets, insomuch that I could put in whatsoever I
pleased. It is true, they wexe not cleverly made,
yet they served my turn upon all occasions.
But still I wanted two necessary things. J
Had no cask to hold my liquor, except two almost
full of rum, a few bottles of an ordinary size,
and some square case bottles; neither had I a
pot to boil any thing in, only a large kettle, unfit
to make broth, or stew a bit of meat: I wanted
likewise at the beginning of this dry season a
tobacco-pipe; but for this I afterwards found an
expedient.
I kept myself employed in planting my se-
cond row of stakes. But remembering that when
I travelled up to the brook I had a mind to see
the whole island, I now resumed my intention,
and taking my dog, gun, hatchet, two biscuit
cakes, a great bunch of raisins, with a larger
quantity of powder and shot than usual, I began
my journey. Having passed the vale where my
bower stood, I came within view of the sea lying
to the west; when, it being a clear day, I fairly
descried land, extending from the west to the
south-west about 10 or 15 leagues, as I con-
cluded; but could not say whether it was an
island or a continent. Neither could I tell what
this place might be; only thought it was part of
America, and where I might have been in a
miserable condition had I landed. Again I con-
sidered, that if this was the Spanish coast, cer-
tainly, one time or the other, I should see some
ships pass by; and if it was not, then it must be
the savage coast, between the Spanish country
and Brazil, which abounds with cannibals or man
eaters.
As I proceeded forward, I found this side oi
the island much more pleasant than mine; the
fields fragrant, adorned with sweet flowers and
verdant grass, together with several very fine
woods. There were parrots in plenty which
made me long for one to be my companion,; but
it was with great difficulty I could knock one
57
down with my stick; md I kept him at home
some years, before I c uld get him td call me by
name.
In the low grounds [ found various sorts of
hares and foxes as I took them to be, but much
different from those in England. Several of
these I killed, but never ate them; neither in-
deed had I any occasion; for abounding with
goats, pigeons, turtle, and grapes, I could defy
any market to furnish me a better table. In
this journey I did not travel above two miles a
day, because I took several turns and windings,
to see what discoveries I could make, returning
weary enough to the place where I designed to
rest all night, which was either in a tree, or to a
place which I surrounded with stakes, that no
-wild creature might suddenly surprise me.
When I came to the sea-shore, ,1 was amazed
to see the splendour of it. Its strand was cover-
ed with shells of the most beautiful fish, and
constantly abounding with innumerable turtles,
and fowls of many kinds, which I was ignorant
of, except those called penguins. I might have
shot as many as I pleased, but was sparing of
my ammunition, rather choosing to kill a she-
goaj, which I did with'much difficulty, on account
of the flatness of the country.
Now, though this journey produced the most
pleasing satisfaction, yet mj habitation was so
much to my liking, that I dm not repine at my
being seated on the worst part of the island. I
continued my journey, travelling about twelve
miles further towards the east, where I set a
great pile on the shore for a mark, concluding
that my next journey should bring me to the
other side of the island, east from my castle, and
so round till I came to my post again. As I had
a constant view of the country, I thought I could
not miss my way; but scarce had I travelled
three miles, when I descended into a very large
valley, so surrounded with hills covered with
wood, that having no guide but the sun, and to
add to my misfortune, the weather proving very
hazy, I was obliged to return to my post by the
sea-side, and so backwards the same way I
came. In this journey my dog surprised a kid,
and would have killed it had I not prevented him.
As I had often been thinking of getting a kid
or two, and so raising a breed of tame goats to
supply me after my ammunition was spent, 1 took
this opportunity of beginning: and, having made
a collar for this little creature, with a string made
of rope-yarn, I brought it to my bower, and there
inclosed and left him; and having spent a month
in this journey, at length I returned to my oltf
habitation.
Nobody can doubt of my satisfaction, when I
Returned to my little castle, and reposed myseli
in my hammock. After my journey I rested
myself a week, which time I employed in making
a cage for my pretty poll. I now began to re-
collect the poor kid I had left in the bower, and
immediately went to fetch it home. When I
came there, I found the young creature almost
starved; I gave it some food, and tied it as
before; but there was no occasion, for it followed
me like a dog; and as I constantly fed it, be-
came so loving, gentle, and fond, that it com-
fncnocd one of my domestics, and would never
leave me.
The rainy season of the autumnal equinox
being now come, I kept the 30th of September
in the most solemn manner, as usual, it being
the third year of my abode in the island. I spent
the whole day in acknowledging God's mercies,
in giving thanks for makir.g this solitary life as
agreeable, and less sinful, than that of human
society; and for the communication of his grace
to my soul, in supporting, comforting, and en*
couraging me to depend upon his Providence, and
hope for his eternal presence in the world to
come.
Indeed, I often did consider how much more
happy I was, in this state of life, than in that
acotfrsed manner of living I formerly used;
sometimes, however, when hunting, or viewing
the country, the anguish of my soul would break
out upon me, and my very heart would sink
within me, to think of the woods, the mountains,
the deserts I was in; and how I was a prisoner
locked up within the eternal bars and bolts of the
ocean, in an uninhabited wilderness, without hopes,
and without redemption. In this condition, I would
often wring my hands, and weep like a child: and
even sometimes in the middle of my work, this fit
would often take me; and then I would sit dow,n
and sigh, looking on the ground for an hour or
two together, till such time as my grief got vent
in a flood of tews.
One' morning, as I was fully employed in this
manner I opened my Bible, when immediately I
fixed my eyes upon these words "I will never
leave thee, nor forsake thee!" Surely, if God
does not forsake me, what matters it, since he
can make me more happy in this state of life,
that if I enjoyed the greatest splendour in the
, world? And whenever I opened or shut the
Bible, I blessed kind Providence, that directed
my good friend in England to send it among my
goods without my order, and for assisting me to
save it from the power of the raging ocean.
And now beginning my third year, my several
daily employments were these: First; My duty
to Heaven, and diligently reading the Holy
Scriptures which I did twice or thrice every day;
Secondly, Seeking provisions with my gun, which
commonly took me up, when it did not rain, three
hours every morning; Thirdly, The ordering,
curing, preserving, and cooking what I had killed,
or catched for my supply, which took me up a
great part of the day; for in the middle of the
day, the sun being in its height, it was, so hot,
that I could not stir out; so that I had but
four hours in the evening to work in: and
then the want of tools, of assistance, and skill,
wasted a great deal of time to little purpose,
I was no less than two and forty days, making a
board fit for a long shelf which two sawyers, with
their tools and saw-pit, would have cut out of
the same tree in half a day. It was of a large
tree, as my board was to be broad. I was three
days in cutting it down, and two more in lopping
off the boughs, and reducing it to a piece of tim-
ber. Thus I hacked and hewd off each side,
till it became light to move; then 1 turned it,
"made one side of it smooth and flat as a board
from end to end, then turned it downward, cut-
ting the other side, till I brought the plank to be
about three inches thick, and smooth on both
sides. Any body may judge my great labour
and fatigue in such a piece of work; but this I
went through with patience, as also many other
things, that my circumstances made necessary
for me to do.
The harvest months, November and Decem-
ber, were now at hand, in which I had the plea-
sing prospect of a very good crop. But here I
met with a new misfortune, for the goats and
hares, having tasted of the sweetness of the blade,
kept it so short that it had no strength to shoot up
into a stalk. To prevent this, I enclosed it with
a hedge, and by day shot some of its devourers;
and my dog, which I had tied to the field-gate,
keeping barking all night, so frightened these
'creatures that I got entirely rid of them.
But, no sooner did I get rid of these, than
'other enemies appeared; to wit, whole flocks
of several sorts of birds, who only waited till my
back was turned, to ruin me. So much did this
provoke me, that I let fly, and killed three of the
malefactors; and afterward served them as they
do notorious thieves in England, hung them up
in chains as a terror to others. And, indeed, so
good an effect had this, that they not only forsook
the corn, but all that part of the island, so long
as these criminals hung there. .
My corn having ripened apace, the latter end
of December, which was my second harvest, I
reaped it with a scythe, made of one of my
broad swords. 'I had no fatigue in cutting down

UPE AND ADVENTURES OF
my first crop, it was so slender. The ears I
carried home in a basket, rubbing the grain out
with my hands, instead of threshing it; and,
when my harvest was over, found my half peck ot
seed had produced nearly two buskels of rice,
and two bushels and a half of barley. And now
I plainly foresaw, that, by God's goodness, I
should be furnished with bread: but yet I was
concerned, because I knew hot how to grind or
make meal of my corn neither knew I how to
bake it into bread. I would not, however, taste
any of the crop, but resolved to preserve it
against next season, and, in the mean while, use
my best endeavours to provide myself with other
food.
But where were my labours to end? the want
of a plough to turn up the earth, or shovel to dig
it, I conquered by making me a wooden spade.
The want of a harrow I supplied, by dragging
over the corn a great bough of a tree. When it
Was growing, I was forced to fence it: when
ripe, to mow it, carry it home, thresh it, part it
from the chaff, and save it. And, aPer all, I
wanted a mill to grind it, a sieve to dress it, yeast
and salt to make it into bread, and an oven to
bake it. This set my brains to work, to find
some expedient for every one of these necessa-
ries, against the next harvest.
And now having more seed, my first care was
to prepare me more land. I pitched upon two
large flat pieces of ground, near my castle, for
that purpose, in which I sowed my seed, and
fenced it with a good hedge. This took me up
thiee months: by which time, the wet season
coming on, and the rain keeping me within doors.
I found several occasions to employ myself;
and, while at work, used to divert myself with
talking to my parrot, teaching him to know and
speak his own name Poll, the first welcome word
I ever heard spoken in the island. I had been a
.ong time contriving how to make earthen ves-
sels, which I wanted extremely; and when I
considered the heat of the climate, I did not
doubt but, if I could find any such clay, I might
botch up a pot, strong enough, when dried in the'
sun, to bear handling, and to hold any thing that
was dry, as corn, meal, and other things.
To be short, the clay I found; but it would
occasion the most serious person to smile, to see
what awkward ways I took, and what ugly mis-
shapen things I made; how many either fell out
or cracked by the violent heat of the sun, and
fell in pieces when they were removed, so that I
think it was two months before I could perfect
any thing; and even then but two clumsy things
in imitation of earthen jars. These, however, I
very gently placed in wicker baskets, made on
purpose for them; and between the pot and the
baskets, stuffed it full of rice and barley straw;
and these I presumed would hold my dried corn,
and perhaps the meal, when the corn was bruised.
As for the smaller things, I made them with
better success; such as little round pots, flat
dishes, pitchers, and pipkins, the sun baking
them very hard.
Yet still I wanted one thing absolutely neces-
sary, and that was an earthen pot, not only to
hold my liquid, but also to bear the fire, which
none of these could do. It once happened that
as I was putting out my fire, I found therein a
broken piece of one of my vrssels, burnt hard
as a rock, and red as a tile. This made me think
of burning some pots; and having no notion of
a kiln, or of glazing them with lead, I fixed
three large pipkins, and two or three pots in a
pile one upon another. The fire I piled round
the outside, and dry wood on the top, till I saw
the pots in the inside red hot, aftd found that they
did not crack at all: and when I perceived
them perfectly red, I let them stand in the fire
about five or six hours, till the clay melted by the
extremity of the heat, and would have run to
glass had I suffered it; upon which, I slacked
my fire by degrees, till the redness abated; and
watching them till the morning, I found I had
three very good pipkins, and two earthen pots,
as well burnt and fit for my turn as I could desire.
The first use to which I turned my pipkins
vas to make some salt, which I had long waa'
ed. For this purpose, I filled them with sea-
water, and kept it slowly boiling over the fire,
till the whole of the water had boiled away in
steam, leaving, at the bottom of the vessel, a
thin crust of salt, which I found very good for
giving a relish to my food.
The next concern I had, was to get me a
stone-mortar to beat some corn in, instead of a
mill to grind it. Here, indeed, I was at a great
loss, as not being fit for a stone-cutter; and
many days I spent to find out a great stone big
enough to cut hollow and make fit for a mortar
and strong enough to bear the weight of a pea
tie, that would break the corn without filling
it with sand. But all the stones of the island
being; of a mouldering nature, rendered my
search fruitless; and then I resolved to look
out a great block of hard wood; which having
found, I formed it by my axe and hammer, and
then, with infinite labour, made a hollow in it,
just as the Indians of Brazil make their canoes.
When I had finished this I made a great pestle
of iron-wood, and then laid them up against my
succeeding harvest.
My next business was to make me a sieve, to
sift my meal and part it from the bran and husk.
Having no fine thin canvass to search the meal
through, I could not tell what to do. What linen
I had was reduced to rags; I had goat's hair
enough, but neither tools to work it, nor did I
know how to spin it. At length, I remembered
I had some neck-cloths of calico or muslin of
the sailors, which I had brought out of the ship,
and with these, I made three small sieves proper
enough for the work.
I come now to consider the baking part.
The want of an oven I supplied, by making
some earthen pans very broad, but not deep,
When I had a mind to bake, I made a great fire
upon my hearth, the tiles of which 1 had made
myself, and when the wood was burnt into live
coals, I spread them over it, till it became very
hot; then sweeping them away, I set down my
loaves, and whelming down the earthen pots
upon them, drew the ashes and coals all around
the outsides of the pots to continue the heat;
and in this manner, I baked my barley loaves, as
6*
well as if I had been a complete pastry cook,
and also made of the rice, several cakes and
puddings.
It is no wonder that all these things took me
up the best part of a year, since what inter-
mediate time I had, was bestowed in managing
-my new harvest and husbandry; for in the proper
season, I reaped my corn, carried it home and
laid it up in the ear, in my large baskets, till I
had time to rub, instead of thrashing it. And
now indeed, my corn increased so much, that it
toduccd me twenty bushels of barley, and as
much of rice, that I not only began to use it
freely, but was thinking how to enlarge my barns,
and resolved to sow as much at a time as would
be sufficient for. a whole year:
All this while, the prospect of land, which I
had seen from the other side of the island, ran in
my mind. I still meditated a deliverance from
this place, though the fear of greater misfortunes
might have deterred me from it. For allowing
that I had attained that place, I ran the hazard of
being killed and eaten by the devouring cannibals;
and if they were not so yet 1 might be slain, as
other Europeans had been, who fell into their
hands. Notwithstanding all this, my thoughts
ran continually upon that shore. I now wished
for the long boat with the shoulder of mutton sail.
I went to the ship's boat, that had been cast a
great way on the shore in the late storm. She
was removed but a little; and her bottom being
turned up by the impetuosity and surge of the
waves and wind, I fell to work with all the
strength I had, and with levers and rollers I had
cut from the wood, to turn her, and repair the
damages she had sustaiued. This work took me
up three or four weeks, when finding my litfle
strength all in vain, I fell to undermining it by
digging away the sand, and so to make it fall
down, setting pieces of wood to thrust and guide
it in the fall. But after this was done, I was still
unable to stir it up, or to get under it, much less
to move it forward towards the water an'l so I
was forced to give it over.
This disappointment, however, did not frighten
me. I began to think, whether it was not possible
for me to make a canoe or Perigua, such as the
Jndians make of the trunk of a tree. But here
I lay under particular inconveniences.; want of
tools to make it, and wa,nt of hands ,to move it
into the water when it was made. However, to
work I went upon it, stopping all the enquiries I
could make with this very simple answer I made
to myself, let's first make it, I'll warrant I'll find
some way or other to get it along when it is done.
I first cut down a cedar tree, which was five
feet ten inches diameter at the lower part nex£
the stump, and four feet eleven inches diameter
at the end of .twenty^two feet, after which it
lessened for a space, and then parted into
branches. Twenty days was I hacking and
hewing it at the bottom, fourteen more in cutting
/Off the branches and limbs, and a whole month
in shaping it like the bottom of a boat. As for
the inside, I was three weeks with a mallet and
chissel, clearing it in such a manner, as that it
was big enough to carry 26 men, much bigger
.than any canoe I ever saw in my life, and conse-
quently sufficient to transport me and all my
effects to that wished for shore I so ardently
desired.
Nothing remained now, but indeed the greatest
difficulty, to get it into the water, it lying about
100 yards from it. To remedy the first incon-
venience, which was a rising hill between the
boat and the creek, with wonderful pains and
labour i dug into the surface of the earth, and
made a declivity. But when this was done, all
the strength I had was as insufficient to move it,
as it was when I first made the attempt. I then,
proceeded- to measure the distance of ground,
resolving to make a canal, in order to bring the
water to the canoe, since I could not bring the
canoe to the' water. But as this seemed to be-
impracticable to myself alone under the space of
eleven or twelve years, it brought me into some
sort of consideration-; so that I concluded this
also to be impossible, and the attempt vain. I
now saw, and not before, what stupidity k is to
begin work before we reckon its costs, or judge
rightly our own abilities to go through with its
performance.
In the height of this work my fourth year ex-
pired from the time I was cast on this island.
At this time I did not forget my anniversary:
but kept it with rather greater devotion than be-
fore. For now my hopes being frustrated, I
looked upon this world as a thing I had nothing
to do with; and very well might I say, as father
Abraham said unto Dives, ." between me, and
thee there is a gulph fixed.'' And indeed I was
separated-from its wickedness too, havir.g neither
noniNsoN crusoe. 69
the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye, nor the
pride of life; I had nothing to covet, being lord,
king and emperor over the whole country I had in
possession, without dispute and without controul:
I had loadings of corn, plenty of turtles, timber in
abundance, and grapes alcove measure. What
was all the rest to me ?, the money I had lay by
me as despicable dross, which I would freely
have given for a gross of tobacco pipes or a
hand-mill to grind my corn: in a word, the
nature and experience of these things dictated to
me this just reflection. That the good things of
this world are no further good to us than as they
are for our use; and that whatever we may heap
up, we can but enjoy as much as we use and no
more.
These thoughts rendered my mind more easy
than usual. Every time I sat down to meat, I did
eat with thankfulness, admiring the providential
hand of God, who, in this wilderness had spread a
table to me. And now I considered what I enjoy,
ed, rather than what I wanted, compared my pre-
sent condition with what Iatfirstexpectedit should
be ; how I should have done, if I had got no-
thing out of the ship; that I must have perished
before I had caught fish or turtles; or lived, had I
found them, like a mere savage, by eating them
raw, and pulling them to pieces with my claws,
like a beast. I next compared my station to
that which I deserved; how undutiful 1 had been
to my parents; how destitute of the fear of
God; how void of every thing that was good;
and how ungrateful for those abundant mercies I
."ad received from heaven, being fed, as it were
by a miracle, even aa great as Elijah's being fed
by ravens; and cast on a place where there are
ho venomous cieatures to poison or devour me;
in short, making God's tender mercies matter of
great consolation, I relinquished all sadness, and
gave way to contentment.
As long as my ink continued, which with wa-
ter I made last as long as I could, I used to mi-
nute down the days of the month on which any
remarkable thing happened.
The next thing that wasted after my ink, was
the biscuit, which I had brought out of the ship;
and though I allowed myself but one cake a
day for about a twelvemonth, yet I was quite out
of bread for nearly a year, before I got any corn
if my own.
In the next place, rriy clothes began to de-
cay, and my linen had been gone long before.
However, I had preserved about three dozen of
the sailor's chequered shirts which proved a great
refreshment to me, when the violent beams of the
sun would not suffer me to bear any of the sea-
men's heavy watch-coats; which made me turn
tailor, and, after a miserable botching manner,
convert them to jackets. To preserve my head,
I made a cap of goatskins, with the hair out-
wards to keep out the rain; which indeed served
me so well, that afterward I made a waistcoat
and open-kaeed breeches of the same: and then
[contrived a sort of umbrella, covering it with
skins, which not only kept out the heat of the
sun, but the rain also. Thus being easy and
Settled in my mind, my chief happiness was to
converse with God, in most heavenly and com-
fortable ejaculations.
For five years after this, I cannot say any ex-
traordinary thing occurred to me. My chief
employment was to cure my raisins, and plant
my barley and rice, of both which I had a year's
provision before-hand. But though I was dis-
appointed in my first canoe, I made it, at inter-
mediate times, my business to make a second of
much inferior size: and it was two years before
I had finished it. But as I perceived it would
in no wise answer my design of sailing to the
other shore, my thoughts were confined to take a
tour round the island, to see what further dis-
coveries I could make. To this intent, after
having moved her to the water, and tried how
she would sail, I fitted up a little mast to my
boat, and made a sail of the ship's sails that lay
by me. I then made lockers or boxes at the
end of it to put in necessaries, provision and
ammunition, which would preserve them dry
either from the rain, or the spray of the sea; and,
in. the inside of the boat, I cut me a long hoilow
place to tay my gun, and to keep it dry, made a
cover for it. My umbrella, I fixed in a step in
the stern, like a mast, to keep the heat of the
sun off me. And now resolving to see the
circumference of my little kingdom, I victualled
my ship for the voyage, putting in two dozen of
my barley bread loaves, an «arthen pot full of
parched rice, a utile Dottle of rum, half a goat,
powder and shot, ana two watch-coats. It was
the sixth of November, in the sixth year of my
reign, or captivity, ti*tt I set out on this voyage;
which was much longer than I expected, being
obliged to put farther out, by reason of the rocks
that lay a great way in the sea.
And indeed; so much did these rocks swrprise
me, that I was for putting back, fearing that if I
entured farther, it would be out of my power
to return: in this uncertamty I came to anchor
just off the shpre, to which I waded with my gun
on my shoulder, and then climbing up a hill,
which over-looked that point, I saw the full ex-
tent of it, and so resolved to run all hazards.
In this prospect from the hill, I perceived a
violent current running to the east, coming very
close to the point; which I the more carefully
observed, thinking it dangerous, and that when I
same to it, I might be driven into the sea by its
lorce, and not able to return to the island: and
certainly it must have been so, had I not made
this observation; for on the other side was a
like current, with this difference, that it set off at
a greater distance; and I perceived there was a
strong eddy under the land; so that my chief
business was to work out of the first current',
and conveniently get jnto the eddy. Two days I
staid here, the wind blowing very briskly east
£outh east, which being contrary to the current;
leaves a great breach of the sea upon the point;
so it was neither fit for me to keep too near the
shore, on account of the breach; nor stand at
too great distance for fear of the streams. That
night the wind abating, it grew so calm, that I
ventured out: and here I may be a monument to
all rash and ignorant pilots; for I was no sooner
come to the point, and not above the boat's
length from shore, but I was got into deep
water, with a current like a mill-race, which drove
my boat along so violently, that it was impossible
for me to keep near the edge of it, for it forced
me more and more out from the eddy to the left
of me; and all I could do with my paddles was
useless, there being no wind to help me.
Now I began to look upon myself as quite
lost, since, as the current ran on both sides of
the island, I was very certain they must join
again, and then I had no hopes but of perishing
for want, in the sea, after what provision I had
was spent, or before, if a storm should happen to
arise.
Who can conceive the present anguish of my
mind at this calamity 1 with longing eyes did I
look upon my little kingdom, and thought the
island the pleasantest place in the universe. Hap-
py, thrice happy desert, said I, shall I never see
thee more 1 Wretched creature! wither am I
going 1 Why did I murmur at my lonesome
condition, when now I would give the whole
wide world to be thither again? While I was
thus complaining, I found myself to be driver!
about two leagues into the sea; however, I la-
boured till my strength was far spent, to keep my
boat as far north as I possibly could, to that side
of the current where the eddy lay. About noon
I perceived a little breeze of wind, spring up front
the south south east, which overjoyed my heart;
and I was still more elated, when in about half
an hour, it blew a gentle fine gale. Had any
thick weather sprung up, I had been lost another
Way: for having no compass on board, I should
7
*T
never have found the way to steer towards the
island, if once it had disappeared; but it proving
the contrary, I set up my mast again, spread rhy
sail and stood away northward, as much as I
could, to get rid of the current. And no sooner
did the boat begin to stretch away, but I perceiv-
ed by the clearness of the water, a change of the
current was near; for, where it was strong, the
water was foul; and where it was clear the Cur-
rent abated.
Those who have been in the like calamities
with my own, may guess my present excess of
joy, how heartily I ran my boat in the stream of
this eddy, and how joyfully I spread my sail to
the refreshing wind, standing cheerfully before it,
with a smart tide under foot. By the assistance
of this eddy, I was carried above a league home
again, when, being in the wake of the island, be-
twixt the two currents, I found the water to be
in a sort of a stand. About four o'clock in the
afternoon, I reached within a league of the island,
- and perceived the points of the rock, which caus
ed this disaster, stretching out, as I observed be
fore, to the southward, which throwing off the
current more southerly, had occasioned another
eddy to the north. But having a fair brisk gale,
I stretched across this eddy, and in an hour came
within a mile of the shore, where I soon landed to
my unspeakable comfort; and after an humble
prostration, thanking God for my deliverance,
with a resolution to lay all thoughts of escaping
aside, I brought ray boat safe to a little cove, and
laid me down to take a welcome repose. When
i awoke, 1 was considering how I might get my
boat home; and coasting along the shore I came
to it good bay, which ran up to a rivulet or brook,-
where, finding a harbour, I stowed her as safe as
if she had been in a dry dock, made on purpose
for her.
I now perceived myself not far from the place,
were before I had travelled on foot: so taking
nothing with me, except my gun and umbrella, I
began my journey, and in the evening came to
my bower, where I again laid me down to rest.
I had not slept long before I awakened in great
surprise, by a strange voice that called me seve-
ral times, "Robin, Robin; Robinson Crusoe;
poor Robin! Where are you, Robinson Crusoe?
Where are you 1 Where have you been?"
So fast was I asleep, that at first I did not
awake thoroughly; but half asleep, and half
awake, I thought I dreamed that some body spoke
tb me. But as the voice repeated, " Robinson
Crusoe," several times, being terribly frightened,
I started up in the utmost confusion; and, no
sooner were my eyes fully open, but I beheld my
pretty poll sitting on the top of the hedge, and
soon knew that it was he that called me; for
just in such bewailing language, I used to talk
and teach him; which he so exactly learned, that
he would sit upon my finger, and lay his bill close
to my face, and cry, " poor Robinson Crusoe,
where are you? where Have you been? how
came you here?" and such like prattle I had con-
stantly taught him. But even though I knew it
to be the parrot, it was a great time before I could
adjust myself: being amazed how the creature
got thither, and that he should fix about that
place, and no where else. But now, being as-
sured it could be no other than my honest" Poll,"
my Wonder ceased, and reaching out my hand,
and calling " Poll," the creature came to me fa-
miliarly, and perched upon my thumb, as he was
wont, constantly prating to me with "poor Ro-
binson Crusoe, and how did I come here, and
where had I been V as if the bird was overjoy-
ed to see me, and so I took him home along with
me. I was now pretty well cured of rambling
to sea; yet I could wish my boat, which had
cost me so much trouble and pains, on this side
the island once more, but this, indeed was im-
practicable. I therefore began to lead a very
retired life, living nearly a twelvemonth in a very
contented manner, wanting for nothing but con-
versation. As to mechanic labours, which my
necessities obliged me to, I fancied I could, upon
occasion, make a tolerable carpenter, were the
poor tools I had to work withal, but good. Be-
sides, as I improved in my earthenware, I con-
trived to make them with a wheel, which I found
much easier and better, making my work
shapely, which before was rude and ugly. But,
I think I never was so much elevated with my
own performance or project as when able to
make a tobacco-pipe, which, though it proved an
awkward clumsy thing, yet it was very sound,
and carried the smoke perfectly well, to my great
satisfaction.
I also improved my wicker ware, made me
abundance of necessary baskets, which, though
not very handsomo, were very handy and conve*
niimt to fetch things home in, as also for holding
my stores, barley, rice, and other provisions.
My powder beginning to fail, made me exar.
mine after what manner I should kill the goats or
birds, to live on, after it was all gone. Upon
which I contrived many ways to ensnare the
goats, and see if I could catch them alive, parti-
cularly a she-goat with young.
At last I had my desire; for, making pit-falls
and traps, baited with barley and rice, I found,
one morning, in one of them, an old he goat, and
in the other, three kids, one male, and two fe-.
males.
So boisterous was the old one,, that I could
not bring him away. But I .orgot the old pro-
verb, " That hunger will tame a lion:" for, had I
kept him three or four days without provisions,
and then given bim some water with a, little corn*
he would have been as tame as a young kid.
The other creatures I bound with strings toge-:
ther; but I had great difficulty, before I could
bring them to my habitation. It was some time
before they would feed; but, throwing them
sweet corn, it so much tempted them, that they
began to be tamer. From hence I concluded,
that if I designed to furnish myself with goat's
flesh, when my ammunition was spent, the tame-:
ly breeding them up, like a flock of sheep about
my settlement, was the only method I could tajte,
I concluded also that I must separate the wild
from the tame, or else they would always runwil4
as they grew up; and the best way for this, was
to have some enclosed piece of ground, well
fenced, cither with a hedge or pale, to keep them
7*
so effectually, that those within might not break
out, nor those without break in. Such an under-
taking was very great for one pair of hands; but
as there was an absolute necessity for doing it,
my first care was to find a cpnvenient piece of
ground, where there was likely to be herbage for
them to eat, water to drink, and cover to keep
them from the sun.
Here again, I gave another instance of my ig-
norance and inexperience, pitching upon a piece
of meadow land so large, that had I enclosed it,
the hedge or pale must have been at least two
miles about. This thought came into my head,
after I had carried it on, I believe, about fifty
yards: I therefore altered my scheme, and re-
solved to enclose a piece of ground about 150
yards in length, and 100 in breadth, large enough
for as many as would maintain me, till such tjme
as my flock increased, and then I could add more
ground. I now vigorously prosecuted my work,
and it took me about three months in hedging
the first piece; in which time I tethered the three
kids in the best part of it; feeding them as near
me as possible, to make them familiar: and, in-
deed, I very often would carry some ears of bar-
ley, or a handfull of rice, and feed them out of
my hand ; by which they grew so tame, that when
my enclosure was finished, and I had let them
loose, they would run after me for a handful of
corn. This indeed answered my end: and in a
year and a half's time, I had a flock of about
twelve goats, kids and all; and in two years af-
ter, they amounted to for.ty^three, besides what f
jhad taken and killed for my sustenance.
After which, I enclosed five several pieces of
ground to feed them in, with pens to drive them
into, that I might take them as I had occasion.
In this project I likewise found additional
blessings; for I not only had plenty of goat's
flesh, but milk too, which in the beginning, I did
not so much as think of. And, indeed, though I
had never milked a cow, much less a goat, or
seen butter or cheese made, yet, after some
essays and miscarriages, I made me both, and
never afterward wanted.
How mercifully can the Almighty comfort his
creatures, even in the midst of their greatest
calamities 1 How can he sweeten the bitterest
evils, and give us reason to magnify him in
dungeons and prisons; what a bounteous table
was here spread in the wilderness for me, where
I expected nothing at first, but to perish for
hunger.
Certainly any one would have smiled to see
me at dinner. There sat my royal majesty, an
absolute prince and ruler of my kingdom, at-
tended by my dutiful subjects, whom if I pleased,
1 could either hang, draw, quarter, give them
liberty, or take it away. When I dined, I seemed
a king, eating alone, none daring to presume to
do so till I had done. Poll as if he had been
my principal court favourite, was the only person
permitted to talk with me. My old but faithful
dog, now grown exceedingly crazy, continually
sat on my right hand; while my two cats sat on
each side of the table, expecting a bit from my hand,
as a principal mark of my royal favour. These
were no;t the cats I had brought frorn tlje ship j
they had been dead long before, and intered near
my habitation by mine own hand. But a couple
of their young I had made tame; the rest ran
wild into the woods, and in time grew so impu-
dent, as to return and plunder me of my stores,
till such time as I shot a great many, and the
rest left me without troubling me any more. In
this plentiful manner did I live, wanting for no-
thing but conversation. One thing indeed con-
cerned me, the want of my boat; I knew not
which way to get her round the island. One
time I resolved tp go along the shore by land to
her; but had any one at home met such a figure,
it would either have affrighted him, or made him
burst into laughter; nay, I could not but smile
myself at my habit, which I think in this place
will be very proper to describe.
The cap I wore upon my head, was great,
high, and shapeless, made of a goat's skin, with a
flap or pent-house hanging down behind, not
only to keep the sun from me, but to shoot the rain
off from running into my neck, nothing being
more pernicious than the rain falling upon the
flesh in these climates. I had a short jacket of
goat's skin, whose hair hung down such a length
on each side, that it reached down to the calves
of my legs. As for shoes and stockings, I had
none, but made a resemblance of something,
I know not what to call them; they were made
like buskins, and laced on the sides like spatter-
dashes, barbarously shaped, like the rest of my
habit. I had a broad belt of goat's skin dried,
girt round me with a couple of thongs, instead of
buckles; on each of which, to supply the defici-
ency of sword and dagger, hung my hatchet and
saw. I had another belt, not so broad, yet fast*
ened in the same manner, which hung over my
shoulder, and at the end of it, under my left arm,
hung two pouches, made of goat's skin, to hold
my powder and shot. My basket I carried on my
back, and my gun on my shoulder; and over my
head a great clumsy ugly goat's skin umbrella,
which however, next to my gun, was the most
necessary thing about me. As for my face, the
colour was not so swarthy as the Mulattoes, or
as might have been expected from one who took
so little care of it, in a climate within nine or ten
degrees of the line. At one time, my beard
grew so long that it hung down above a quarter
of a yard; but as I had both razors and scissors
in store, I cut it all of, and suffered none to grow
except a large pair of Mahometan whiskers, the
like of which I had seen worn by some Turks at
Salee, not long enough indeed to hang a hat upon,
but of such a monstrous size, as would have
amazed any in England to have seen.
But all this was of no consequence here, there
being none to observe my behaviour or habit.
And so, without fear and without control, I pro-
ceeded on my journey, the prosecution of which
took me up five or six days. I travelled along
the sea shore, directly to the place where I first
brought my boat to an anchor, to get upon the
rocks; but now having no boat to take care of,
I went over land, a nearer way to the same height
that I was before upon; wnen looking forward
to the point of the rock, which lay out, and which
I was forced to double with my boat, I was
amazed to see the sea so smooth and quiet, there
being no rippling motion, nor current, any more
than in other places. And now I was convinced
that by observing the ebb and flow of the tide, I
might easily bring my boat round the island
again. But when I began to think of putting it
m practice, the remembrance of the late danger
strbck me with such horror that I took another
resolution, though more laborious; and this was
to make a second canoe* and so have one for one
side of the island, and one for the other.
I had now two plantations in the island; the
first my little fortification, fort, or castle with
many large and spacious improvements, for by
this time I had enlarged the cave behind me with
several little caves, one within an dtheri to hold
my baskets, corn, arid straw. The piles with
which I made my wall were grown so lofty and
great, as obscured my habitation^ And near this
commodious and pleasant settlement, lay my well
cultivated and improved corn fields, which kindly
yielded me their fruit in their proper season. My
second plantation was that near my country seat
or little bower, where my grapes flourished, and
where, having planted my stakes, I made enclo-
sures for my goats, so strongly fortified by labour
and time, that it was much stronger than a wall,
and, consequently, impossible for them to break
through. As for my bower itself, I kept it con-
stantly in repair, and cut the trees in such a man-
ner, as made them grow wild, and form a most
delightful shade* In the centre of this, stood my
tent, thus erected. I had driven four piles in the
ground, spreading over it a piece of the ship's
» --• "v
sail, beneath which, I made me a sort of couch
with the skins of the creatures I had slain, and
other things; and having laid thereon one of the
sailor's blankets, which I had saved from the
wreck of the ship, and covering myself with a
great watch-coat, I took up this place for my
country retreat.
Very frequently, from this settlement did I use
to visit my boat, and keep her in very good order.
And sometimes would I venture in her a cast of
two from shore, but no farther. But now I en*
treat your attention, whilst I proceed to inform
you of a new,' but most surprising scene of life
iwhich here befel me.
You may easily suppose, that, after having
been here so long, nothing could be more amaz-
ing than to see a human creature. One day it
happened, that going to my boat, I saw the print
*(£ a man's naked foot on the shore, very evident
'p'n the sand, as the toes, heels, and every part of
ft. Had I seen a monster of the most frightful
shape, I could not have been more confounded.
My willing ears gave the strictest attention. I
cast my eyes around, but could satisfy neither
the one nor the other, I proceeded alternately to
-every part of the shore, but with equal effect;
neither could I see any other mark though the
sand about it was as susceptible to take impres-
sion as that which was so plainly stamped. Thus
struck with confusion and horror, I returned to
my habitation, frightened at eveiry bush and tree»
taking every thing for men; and possessed with
the wildest idea! That night my eyes never
«losed. T formed nothing but the most dismal
imaginations. In a word, all my religious hopes
vanished, as though I thought God would hot
now protect me by his power, who had wonder-
fully preserved me so long.
What various chains of events are therein tho
life of man! HoW changeable are our affec-
tions, according to different circumstances! We
love to-day, what we hate to-ni'ovrow; We shun
one hour, what we seek the next. This was evi-
dent in me in the most conspicuous rtwnner; for
I, who had so much before lamented my condi-
tion, in being banished from all hurhan kind, was
now ready to expire, when I considered that a
man had set his foot on this desolate island.
But when I considered my station of life, de-
c-reed by the infinitely wise and good providence
of God, that I ought not to dispute my Creator's
sovereignty, who had-an undoubted right to go-
vern and dispose of his creitures as he thmkr
convenient; and that his justice and mercy could
either punish or deliver me, I *.iv, when I consid-
ered all this; I comfortably fviod it my duly to.
bust sincerely in him, pray ai "(vntly to him. ana
humbly resign myself to his divp\i will.
One morning, lying on my t,e.», these words
of the sacred writings came into ,oy wild, " Call
upon me in the day of trouble, nr»i 1 will deliver
thee, and thou shalt glorify me." Uoon this
sentence, rising more cheerfully from my bed, I
offered up my prayers in the most devout man-
ner; and when I had done, taking up my Bible
to read, these words appeared first in my sight,
"Wait on the Lord, and be of good cheer, and
he shall strengthen thy heart: Wait, I say, on
the Lord." Such divine comfort did this give
me, as to remove all cause of sadness upon that
occasion.
Thus, after a world of apprehensions and fears
for three days and nights, I at last ventured out
of my castle, and milked my goats, one of which
was almost spoiled for want of it. I next (though
in great fear,) visited my bower, and milked my
flocks there also; when growing bolder, I went
down to the shore again, and measuring the
print of the foot to mine, to see perhaps whether
I myself had not occasioned that mark, t found
it much superior in largeness: and so returned
home, absolutely convinced, that either some
men had been ashore, or that the island must be
inhabited; and therefore that I might be sur-
prised before I was aware.
I now began to think of providing for my secu-
rity, and resolved in my mind many different
schemes for that purpose. I first proposed to
cut down my enclosures, and turn niy tame cattle
wild into the woods, that the enemy might not
find them, and frequent the island in hopes of
killing the same. Secondly, I was for digging
up my corn-fields for the very same reason.
And, lastly, I concluded to demolish my bower,
lest, seeing a place of human contrivance, they
might come farther, and find out and attack me
in my castle.
Sleep was an litter stranger to my eyes that
bight; yet nature, spent and tired, submitted to
a silent repose the next morning, and then joining
reason with fear, I considered, that this delight-
ful and pleasant island might not be so entirely
8
Forsaken as I might think; but that the inhabi-
tants from the other shore might sail, either with
design or from necessity, by cross winds; and,
tf the latter circumstance, I had reason to believe
they would depart the first opportunity. How-
ever, my fear made me think of a place of re»
treat upon an attack. I now repented that I had
made my door to come out beyond my fortifica-
tion; to remedy which, I resolved to make me a
second one: I fell to work, therefore, and drove
betwixt that double row of trees, which I planted
above twelve years before, several strong piles,
-thickening it with pieces of timber and old cables,
and strenthening the foot of it with earth which I
dug out of my cave; I also made me seven holes,
Wherein I planted my muskets like cannon, fitting
-them into frames resembling carriages. This
being finished with indefatigable industry, for a
Seat way every where, I planted sticks of osiers
;e a wood, about twenty thousand of them,
•leaving a large space between them and my wall,
that I might have room to see an enemy, and that
they might not be sheltered among the young
trees, if they offered to approach the outer wall.
And indeed, scarce two years had passed over
my head, when there appeared a lovely shady
grove, and in six it became a thick wood perfect-
ly impassible. For my safety I left no avenue to
go in or out; instead of which, I set two ladders,
-one to a part of the rock which was low, and then
broke in, leaving room to place another ladder
npon that; so that when I took those down, it
was impossible for any man to descend Without
fcurting himself; and h* they had, they WooW still
be at the outside of my outer wall. But while I
took all the3e measures of human prudence for
my own preservation; I was not altogether un-
mindful of other affairs. To preserve my stock
bf tame goats, that the enemy should not take all
at once, I looked out for the most retired part of
the island, which was the place where I had lost
myself before mentioned, and there finding a
clear piece of land, containing three acres, sur-
rounded with thick woods, I wrought so hard,
that in less than a month's time, I fenced it so
well round; that my flocks were very well secur-
ed in it, and I put thei -sin two he goats, and ten
she ones.
AH this labour was occasioned purely by fear-
ful apprehensions, on account of seeing the print
of a man's foot. And not contented yet with
what I had done, I searched for another place
towards the west part of the island, where I might
also retain another flock. Then wandering on
this errand more to the west of the island than
ever I had yet done, and casting my eyes towards
the sea, methought I perceived a boat at a great
distance; but could not possibly tell what it was
for want of my spy-glass. I considered then, it
was no strange thing to see the print of a man's
foot; and concluding them cannibals, blessed
God for being cast on the other side of the is-
land, where none of the savages, as I thought
ev( r came. But when I came down the hill to
the shore-, which was the south-west point of the
island, I was soon confirmed in my opinion; nor
can any one describe my horror and amazement,
when I saw the ground spread with sculls, hands,
feet, and bones of human bodies; and particu*
larly, I perceived a space like a circle, in the
midst of which had been a fire, about which I
conjectured those wretches sat, and unnaturally
sacrificed and devoured their fellow creatures.
The horror and loathsomeness of this dreadful
spectacle, both confounded my senses, and made
jne discharge from my stomach in an excessive
manner. I then returned towards my habitation;
and in my way thither shedding floods of tears,
and falling down on my bended knees, gave God
tnanks for making my nature contrary to those
wretches, and delivering me so long out of their
hands.
Though reason and my long residence here
had assured me, that the savages never came up
to the thick woody part of the country, and that I
had no reason to be apprehensive of a discovery,
yet such an abhorrence did I still retain, that for
two years after, I confined myself only to my three
plantations ; I mean my castle, country seat, and
enclosure in the woods, though in process of time
my dreadful apprehensions began to wear away.
Thus my circumstances for some time remain-
ed very calm and undisturbed; though indeed,
the terror which the savages had put me in, spoil-
ed some inventions for my own conveniences.
One of my projects was to brew me some beer:
a very whimsical one indeed, when it is consid-
ered, that I had neither casks sufficient, nor
could I make any to preserve it in; neither had
t hops to make it keep, yeast to make it work,
nor a copper or kettle to make it boil. Perhaps,
indeed, after some years, I might bring this to
)ui' i i i'' i
bear, as I had done other things. But now my
inventions were placed another way; and day
and night I could think of nothing but how I
might destroy some of these cannibals, when
proceeding to their bloody entertainments; and
so saving a victim from being sacrificed, that ha
might afterwards become my servant. Many
were my contrivances for this purpose, and many
more objections occurred, after I had hatched
them. I once contrived to dig a hole under the.
place where they made their fire, and put therein,
five or six pounds of gunpowder, which wquld
consequently blow up all those that were near it;
but then I was loth to spend so much upon themv
lest it should not do that certain execution I deT
sired, and only affright and not Hill them. Hav-
ing laid this design aside, I again proposed to,
myself to lie privately in ambush in some conve-
nient place, with my three guns double loaded,
and let fly at them in the midst of their dreadful
ceremony; and having killed two or three of-
them at every shot, fall upon the rest suddenly
with my three pistols, and let not one mother's
son escape. This imagination pleased my fancy
so much that I used to dream of it in the night
time. To put my design in execution I was not
long seeking for a place convenient for my pur-
pose, where unseen I might behold every action
of the savages. Here I placed my two mus-
kets, each of which was loaded with a brace of
slugs, and four or five smaller bullets about the
size of pistol bullets; the fowling piece was
charged with nearly a handful of the largest swan
shot, and in every pistol about four bullets. An4
8*
80 life and Adventures or
thus all things being prepared, no sooner did the
welcome light spread over the element, but I
would issue forth from my castle, and from a lofty
hill, three miles distant, try if I could see any
invaders approach unlawfully to my kingdom,
But having waited in vain two or three months,
it grew very tiresome to me.
I new argued with myself, it was better for me
never to attack, but to remain undiscovered as
long as I possibly could; that an opposite con-
duct would certainly prove destructive; for as it
was scarcely to be supposed I could kill them all,
I might be either overpowered by the remainder,
or that some escaping might bring thousands to
my certain destruction. And, indeed, religion
took their part so much as to convince me how
contrary it was to my duty, to be guilty of shed-
ding human blood, innocent blood, innocent as
to me in particular, whatever they are to one ano-
ther; that I had nothing to do with it, but leave
it to the God of all power and dominion, as I said
before, to do therein what seemed convenient ta
his heavenly wisdom. And, therefore, on my
knees I thanked the Almighty for delivering me
from bloody guiltiness, and begged his protec-r
tion that I might never fall into their hands.
Thus giving over an attempt which I had rashly
begun, I never ascended the hill on that occasion
afterward; I only removed my boat, which lay
on the other side of the island, and every thing
that belonged to her, towards the east, into a lit-
tle cove, that there might not be the least shadow
of any boat near, or habitation upon the island.
My castle then became tny c.ell, keeping always
retired in it, except when I went out to milk my
she-goats, or my little flock in the wood, which
was quite out of danger: for sure I was, that
these savages never came here with cxpectatiori
to nnd any thing, and consequently never wander-
ed from the coast; however, as they might have
several times been on shore, as well before as after
my dreadful apprehensionsj looked back with hor-
ror to think in what state I might have been, had
I suddenly met them, slenderly armed, with one
gun only loaded'with small shot; and h»w great
would have been my amazement, if, instead of
seeing the print of one man's foot, I had per-
ceived fifteen or twenty savages, who, having
once set Jheir eyes upon me, by the swiftness of
their feet, would have left' me no possibility of
escaping? These thoughts would sink my very
soul, so that I would fall into a deep melancholy,
till such time as the consideration of my gratitude
to the divine Being moved it from my heart. I
then fell into a contemplation of the secret
springs of Providence; and how wonderfully we
are delivered, when insensible of it; and when
in uncertain mazes or labyrinths of doubt or he-
sitation, what secret hint directs us, in the right
way when we intended to go out of it; nay per-
haps contrary to our business, sense, or inclina-
tion.
Anxieties of mind, and the care of my preser-
vation, put a period to all future inventions and
contrivances, either for accommodation, or con-
venience, I now cared not to drive a nail, chop a
stick, fire a gun, or make a fire, lest either the
noise should be heard, or the smoke discover
me. And on this account I used to burn my
earthen ware privately in a cave, which I found
in the wood, and which I made convenieut for
that purpose; the principal cause that brought
me here was to make charcoal, so that I might
bake and dress my bread and meat without any
danger.
At that time a curious accident happened to
me, which I shall now relate.
While I was cutting down some wood for
making my charcoal, I perceived a cavity behind
a very thick branch of underwood. Curious to
look into it, I attained its mouth, and perceived
it sufficient for me to stand upright in.
But when I had entered, having crept upon my
hands and feet through this strait, I found the roof
higher up, I think about twenty feet. But surely
never mortal saw such a glorious sight before!
the roof and walls of this cave reflected a hun-
dred thousand lights to me from my two candles,
as though they were indented with shining gold,
precious stones, or sparkling diamonds. And
indeed it was the most delightful cavity or grotto
of its kind that could be desired, though entirely
dark. The floor was dry and level, and had a
kind of gravel upon it; no nauseous venemous
creatures to be seen here, neither any damp or
wet about it. I could find no fault but in the
entrance, and I began to think, that even this
might be very necessary for my defence, and
therefore resolved to make it my principal maga-
zine. I brought hither two fowling pieces and
three muskets, leaving only five pieces at my
castle, planted in the nature of cannon. In a
barrel of gunpowder, which I took out of the sea,
I brought away about sixty pounds of good pow-
der, which was not damaged; and this, with a
great quantity of lead for bullets, I removed from
my castle to this retreat, now fortified both by
art and nature.
I fancied myself now like one of the giants
of old, who were said to live in caves and holes
among the rocks, inaccessible to any but them-
selves, or, at least, most dangerous to attempt.
And now I defied both the cunning and strength
of the savages, either to find me out or to hurt
me.
I think I was now in the twenty-third year of
my reign, and my thoughts much easier than
formerly, having contrived several pretty amuse-
ments, and diversions to pass away the time in
a pleasant manner. By this time my pretty Poll
had learned to speak English, and pronounce his
words very articulately and plain; so that for
many hours we used to chat together after a very
familiar manner, and he lived no less than twenty-
six years. My dog which was nineteen years
old, sixteen of which he lived with me, died some
time ago, of mere old age. As for my cats,
they multiplied so fast, that I was forced to kill
or drive them into the woods, except two or three
which became my particular favourites. Be-
sides these, I continually kept two or three house-
hold kids about me, which I taught to feed out of
my hand, and two more parrots which could talk
indifferently, and call Robinson Crusoe, but not
so excellently as the first, by my not taking so
much pains with them. I had also several sea

fowls which I had wounded and cut their wings;
and growing tame they used to breed among the
low trees about my castle walls, all of which made
my abode very agreeable.
, But what unforeseen events suddenly destroy
the enjoyments of this uncertain state of life,
when we least expect them! It was now the
month of December, ajid the particular time in
my harvest, which required my attendance in the
fields; when going out pretty early in the mor-
ning, before it was day-light, there appeared to
me from the sea-shore, a flaming light, about two
miles from me at the east end of the island,
where I had observed, some savages had been,
before, not on the oth;er side, but to my great
affliction it was on my side of the island.
Struck with a terrible surprise, and my usual
apprehensions, that the savages would perceive
my improvements, I returned directly to my
castle, pulled the ladder after me, making all
things look as wild and natural as I possibly
could. In the next place, I put myself in a pos-
ture of defence, loaded my muskets and pistols,
and committing myself to God's protection, I
resolved to defend myself till my last breath.
Two hours after, impatient for intelligence, I set
my ladder up to the.side of the hill, where there
was a flat place, and then pulling the ladder after
me, ascending to the top, where laying myself
on my belly, with my perspective glass I per-
ceived no less than nine naked savages, sitting
round a small fire, eating as I supposed, human
jjlesh, with their two canoes hauled on shore,
waiting for the flood to carry them off again.
ROBINSON CftlTtOf. 96
The consternation I was in at this sight, espe-
cially seeing them near me, was very great; but
when I perceived their coming must be always
with the current of the ebb, I became more easy
in my thoughts, being fully convinced, that I
might go abroad with security all the time of
flood, if they were not before landed. And, in-
deed, this proved just as I imagined; for no
sooner did they all take boat and paddle away,
but the tide made north-west. When I saw them
gone, I took two guns upon my shoulders, and
placing a couple of pistols in my belt, with my
great sword hanging by my side, I went to the
hill, where at first I made a discovery of these
cannibals, and then saw there had been three ca-
noes more of the savages on shore at that place,
which with the rest, were making over to the
main land.
But nothing could be more horrid to me, when
going to the place of sacrifice, the blood, the
bones, and other mangled parts of human bodies
appeared in my sight; and so fired was I with
indignation, that I was fully resolved to be re-
venged on the first that came there, though I lost
my life in the execution. It then appeared to
me, that the visits which they make to this island
are not very frequent, it being fifteen months
before they came again: but still I was very
uneasy, by reason of the dismal apprehensions
of their surprising me unawares; nor dared I
offer to fire a gun on that side of the island where
they used to appear, le?t, taking the alarm, they
might return with many hundred canoes, and then
God only knows in what manner I should'
made my end. Thus was I a year or more
before I saw any of these devouring cannibals
again.
But to wave this, the following accident, which
demands attention, for a while, eluded the force
jpf my thoughts in revengmg myself on those
heathens. .
t On the 16th of May (according to my wooden
.calendar,) the wind blew exceedingly hard, ac-
companied with abundance., of thunder and light-
ning all day, and succeeded by a very stormy
night. The seeming anger, of the heavens made
me have recourse to my Bible. Whilst I; was
.seriously pondering . upon it, I was suddenly
alarmed with the noise of a gun, which I con-
jectured was fired upon the ocean. Such an un-
usual surprise made me .start up in a minute;
when, with my ladder, ascending the mountain
as before, that very moment a flash of fire pre-
saged the report of another gun, whichl presently
heard, and found it„was from the part of the sea
where the current drove me away, I could not
but then think, that this must be a ship in distress,
and that these were the melancholy signals for a
speedy deliverance. i Great, indeed, was my sor
row upon this occasion; but my labours to assist
them must have proved altogether vain and fruit-
less. However, I brought together all the dry
wood that was at hand, and making a pretty large
,pile, set it on nre on tho hill. I was certain they
.plainly perceived it, by their firing another gun
kas soon as it began to blaze, and after that seve-
ral more from the same quarter. All night long
I kept up my fire; and when the air cleared u'ji,
(*' '>
1 perceived something a great way at sea, directly
east, but could not distinguish what it was, even
with my glass, the weather being so very foggy
out at sea. However, keeping my eyes directly
fixed upon it, and perceiving it did not stir, I
presently concluded it must be a ship at anchor,
and so very hasty was I to be satisfied, that,
taking my gun, I went to the south-west part of
the island, to the same rocks where I had been
formerly driven away by the current; in which
time, the weather being perfectly cleared up, to
my great sorrow, I perceived the wreck of a ship
cast away upon those hidden rocks I had found
when, I was out with my boat; and which, by
making a kind of an eddy, were the occasion of
my preservation.;
When I considered seriously every thing con-
cerning this wreck, and could perceive no room
to suppose any of them saved, I cannot explain,
by any possible force of words, what longings
my so'il felt on this occasion, often breaking out
m this manner. Oh! that there had been but
two or three, nay, even one person saved, that
we might have lived together, conversed with,
and comforted one another! and so much were
my desires moved, that when I repeated these
words, "oh! that there had been but one !" my
hands would so clench together, and my fingers
press the palms of my hands so close, that, had
any soft thing been between, they would have
crushed it, while my teeth would strike together,
and set against each other so strong, that it re-
quired some tine for me to part them.
Till the last year of my being on this islanfi,
9
I never knew whether or not any had been saved
out of this ship. I had the affliction, some time
after, to see the corpse of a drowned boy come
on shore, at the end of the island which was next
the shipwreck; there was nothing on him but a
seaman's waistcoat, a pair of open-kneed linen
drawers, and a blue linen shirt, but no particular
mark to guess what nation he was of. In his
pocket were two pieces of eight, and a tobacco
pipe, the last of which I preferred much more
than I did the first. And now the calmness ot
the sea tempted me to venture out in my boat to
this wreck, not only to get something necessary
out of the ship, but perhaps, some living creature
might be on board, whose life I might preserve.
This had such an influence upon my mind, that
immediately I went home, and prepared every
thing necessary for the voyage, carrying on board
my boat, provisions of all sorts, with a good
quantity of rum, fresh water, and a compass:
so putting off, I paddled the canoe along the
shore, till I came to the north-east part of the
island, from whence I was to launch into the
ocean; but here the current ran so violently, and
appeared so terrible, that my heart began to fail
me; foreseeing, that if I was driven into any of
these currents, I might be carried not only out
of the reach or sight of the island, but even
inevitably lost in the boiling surges of the ocean.
So oppressed was I at these troubles, that I
gave over my enterprize, sailing to a little creek
on the shore, where, stepping out, I sat me down
on a rising hill, very pensive and thoughtful.
I then perceived iiat fee tide was turned, and
(he flood come on, which made it impracticable
for me to go out for so many hours.
That night, I reposed myself in my canoe,'
covered with my watch-coat instead of a blan-
ket, the heavens being my tester. I set out with
the first of the tide full north, till I felt the bene-
fit of the current, which carried me at a great
rate eastward, yet not with such impetuosity as
before, as to take from me all government of my
canoe: so that in two hours I came up to the
wreck, which appeared to me a most melancholy
sight. It seemed to be a Spanish vessel by its
building, stuck fast between two rocks; her stern
and quarters beaten to pieces by the sea; her
main-mast and foremast were brought oft' by the
board; that is, broken short off". As I ap-
proached nearer, I perceived a dog on board,
who, seeing me coming, yelped and cried: and
no sooner did I call him, but the poor creature
jumped into the seal out of which I took him up
almost famished with hunger and thirst: so that
when I gave him a cake of bread, no ravenous
wolf could devour it more greedily; and he
drank to that degree of fresh water, that he would
have burst himself had I suffered him.
The first sight I .met with in the ship, were
two men drowned in the cock-rooiri, or forecastle,
enclosed in one another's arms: hence I very
probably supposed, that when the vessel struck
m the storm, so high and incessantly did the
waters break in and over her, that the men not
being able to bear itj were strangled by the con-
stant rushing of the waves. There were sevep
ml casks of liquor', whether wine or brandy 1
could not be positive, which lay in the lower hold,
as were plainly perceptible by the ebbing out of
the water, yet were too large for me to pretend
to meddle with: likewise I perceived several
chests, whic\ I supposed belonged to the seamen,
two of whic'l I got into my boat, without ex-
amining what Vas in them. What became of
the sailors I c\ Hid not certainly tell; and all her
riches signified lothing at that time to any body.
Searching farmer, I found a cask, containing
about twenty gallons full of liquor, which with
some labour I got into my boat; in the cabin
were several muskets, which I let remain there;
but took away with me a great powder horn, with
about four pounds of powder in it. I took also
a fire-shovel and tongs, with two brass kettles, a
copper pot to make chocolate, and a grid-iron;
all which were extremely necessary to me,
especially the fire-shovel and tongs. And so
with this cargo, accompanied by my dog, I came
away, the tide serving for that purpose: and the
same evening, about an hour within night, I at-
tained the island, after the greatest toil and fa-
tigue imaginable.
That night I reposed my weary limbs in the
boat, resolving the next morning to harbour what
I had gotten, in my new found under ground grot-
to; and not carry my cargo home to my ancient
castle. Having refreshed myself, and got all
my efFects on shore, I next proceeded to examine
the particulars; and so tapping the cask, I foun/
the liquor to be a kind of rum, but not like wha.
we had at the Brazils, nor indeed near so good.
At the opening of the chest, several things ap-
peared very useful to me; for instance, I found
in one, a very fine case of bottles, containing the
finest and best sort of cordial waters; each
bottle held about three pints, curiously tipt with
silver. I found also two pots full of the choicest
sweetmeats, and two more which the water had
utterly spoiled. There were likewise several
good shirts, exceedingly welcome to me, and
about one dozen and a half of white linen hand-
kerchiefs, and coloured neckcloths, the former of
which were absolutely necessary for wiping my
face in a hot day; and in the till, I found three
bags of money, in one of which, decently wrapt
up in a piece of paper, were six doubloons of
gold, and some small bars and wedges of the
same metal, which I believe might weigh near a
pound. In the other chest, I only found some
cloths of very little, value, and about two pounds
of fine glazed powder, in three flasks, kept as I
believe, for charging their fowling pieces on any
occasion, so that, on the whole I made very little
of this voyage. The money was indeed as
mere dirt to me, useless and unprofitable, all,
which I would have freely parted with, for two
or three pair of English shoes and stockings,
things that for many years I had not worn except,
those which I had lately taken off" the feet of the
unfortunate men I found drowned in the wreck,
yet not so good as English shoes either for ease
or service. I found no gold in the second chest;
so concluded that what I took from the first be-
longed to an officer, the latter appearing to have
a much inferior person for its owner. However,
as despicable as the money seemed, I likewise
9*
Jugged it to my cave, laving it up securely, as I
did the rest of my cargo, and intending to seek
out, and return it to the family of the unfortunate
owner, if ever I should return to Europe; and
after I had done all this, I returned back to my boat
rowing or paddling her along till I came to my
old harbour, where I carefully laid her up, and
so made the best of my way to my castle.
When I arrived there, every thing seemed safe
and quiet; so that now, my only business was to
repose myself after my wonted manner, and take
care of my domestic affairs. But though I
might have lived very easy, as wanting for no-
thing absolutely needful; yet still I was more
vigilant than usual, upon account of the savages,
never going much abroad; or if I did, it was td
the east part of the island, where I was well as-
sured that the savages never came, and where I
might not be troubled to carry such a heavy load
of weapons for my defence, as I was obliged to
do if I went the other way.
Two years did I live in this anxious condition,
in all which time, contrary to my former re-
solutions, my head was fijled with nothing but
projects and designs how I might esape from this
-island; and so much were my wanderingthoughts
tent upon a rambling disposition, that had I had
the same boat that I went from Salee in, I should
have ventured once more to the uncertainty of
.the raging ocean.
Having retired to my castle, after my late
voyage to the ship, my frigate laid up and secured,
as usual, and my condition the same as before',
except being richer, though I had as little o<£
casion for riches as the Indians of Peru had for
gold, before the cruel Spaniards came among
them; one night in March, being the rainy season,
in the four and twentieth year of my solitude, 1 lay
down to sleep, very well in health, without dis-
temper, pain, or uncommon uneasiness either of
body or mind; yet notwithstanding, I could not
compose myself to sleep ali the night long. All
this tedious while, it is impossible to express what
innumerable thoughts came into my head. I
traced quite over, the whole history of my life in
miniature, from my utmost remembrance of
things till I came to this island; and then pro-
ceeded to examine every action and passage thai
had occurred since I had taken possession of
my kingdom. In my reflections upon the latter,
I was comparing the happy posture of my affairs
in the beginning of my reign, to this life of
anxiety, fear, and concern, since I had discovered
the print of a foot in the sand; that while I con-
tinued without apprehension, I was incapable of
feeling the dread and .terror I now suffered.
Mow thankful rather ought I to have been for the
knowledge of my danger, since the greatest hap-
piness a man can be possessed of is to have
sufficient time to provide against it? How stu-
pendous is the goodness of Providence, whicl
sets such narrow bounds to the sight and know
ledge of human nature, that while men walk in
the midst of 90 many dangers, they are kept
serene and calm, by having ,the events of things
hid from their eyes, and knowing nothing of
those many dangers that surround them, till per
haps they are dissipated and vanished away.
104 LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF
About a year and half after, one morning
early, I was very much surprised by seeing no
less than five canoes all on shore together, on
my side of the island, and the savages that be-
longed to them all landed, and out of my sight.
Upon which, much dispirited and perplexed, I
lay still in my castle; which, however, I put ii.
a proper posture for an attack; and having for-
merly provided all that was necessary, was soon
ready to enter upon an engagement, should they
attempt it. Having waited for some time, my
impatient temper would let me bear it no longer;
I set my guns at the foot of my ladder, and, as
usual, ascended up to the top of the hill at two
stages, standing, however, in such a manner, that
my head did not appear above the hill, so that
they could not easily perceive me: and here, by
the assistance of my perspective glass, I ob-
served no less than thirty in number around a
fire, feasting upon what meat they had dressed:
how they cooked it, or what it was, I could not
then perfectly tell; but they were all dancing
and capering about the flames, using many fright-
ful and barbarous gestures.
But while, with a curious eye, I was behold-
ing these wretches, my spirits sunk within me,
when I perceived fhem drag two miserable crea-
tures from the boats, to act afresh the dreadful
tragedy, as I supposed they had done before.
It was not long before one of them fell upon the
ground, knocked down as I suppose, with a club
or wooden sword, for that was their manner;
while two or three others went immediately to
work, cutting him open for their cookery, and
then fell to devour him as they had done the for-
mer: while the last unhappy captive was left by
himself, till such time as they were ready for him.
The poor creature looked round him with a sor-
rowful eye, trembling at the thoughts of death;
yet seeing himself a little at liberty, nature, that
very moment, as it were, inspired him with hopes
of life: he started away from them, and ran, with
incredible swiftness, along the sands, directly to
that part of the coast where my ancient and ve-
nerable castle stood.
You may well imagine I was dreadfully af-
frighted upon this occasion, when as I thought,
they pursued him in a whole body, all running to-
wards my palace. And now, indeed, I expected
that he would certainly fly to my grove for pro-
tection. However, my spirits beginning to re-
cover, I still kept upon my guard; and I now
plainly perceived, there were but three men out
of the number that pursued him. I was infinitely
pleased at the swiftness with which the poor
creature ran fiom his pursuers, gaining so much
ground upon them, that I plainly perceived, could
he thus hoid it out for half an hour, there was
not the least doubt but he would save his life from
the power of his enemies.
Between them and my castle, there was a
creek, the very same which I sailed into with all
my effects from the wreck of the ship, on the steep
banks of which, I very much feared the poor
victim would be taken, if he could not swim for
his escape: but soon was I out of pain for him,
when I perceived he made nothing of it, though
at full tide, but with an intrepid courage, spurn, d
—— »
on by the sense of danger, he plunged into the
flood, swimming over in about thirty strokes,
and then landing, ran with the same incredible
strength and swiftness as before. When the
three pursuers came to the creek, two of them,
who I perceived could not swim, happily for
themselves," returned to their company, while the
other, with an equal courage but much less swift-
ness attained the other side, as though he was
resolved never to give over the pursuit. And
now or never, I thought, was the time for me to
procure me a servant, companion, or assistant,
and that I was decreed by Providence to be the
instrument to save this poor creature's life. I
immediately descended my two ladders with the
greatest expedition; I took up my two guns,
which,! said before, were at the bottom of them;
a.nd getting up again with the same haste to-
wards ,the hill, I made nearer the sea. In a
word, taking a short cut down the hill, I inter-
posed between the pursuer and pursued, hal-
looing aloud to the latter, who venturing to look
back, was no doubt, as much terrified at me as
at the enemy from whom he fled. I beckoned
to him, with my hand, to return back, and, in the
mean time, advanced towards the pursuer. I
was very unwilling to fire lest the rest should hear,
though, at that distance, I questioned whether they
could or no; and being out of sight of the smoke,
they could not easily have known what to make of
it. The savage stopped as if he had been amazed;
wl)sn, advacing towards him, I cpuld perceive,
tjira take his bow from his back, and. after fixing
in a> row to it, preparing to shoot at me, and, with-
out dispute, he might have lodged it in my breast;
but in this absolutely necessary case of self-
preservation, I immediately fired, and shot him
dead, just as his hand was going to draw the fatal
string. All this while, the savage, who had fled
before, stood still, and had the satisfaction to see
his enemy killed, as he thought, who designed to
take away his life; so affrighted was he with the
fire and noise of my piece, that he stood as it
were like Lot's wife, fixed and immoveable with-
out either sense or motion. This obliged me to
halloo to him again, making the plainest signs I
could to him to draw nearer. I perceived he
understood these tokens, by his approaching to
me a little way when as if afraid I should kill
him too, he stopped again. Several times did he
advance, and as often stop in this mannei, till,
coming more to my view, I perceived him trem-
bling, as if he was to undergo the same fate.
Upon which I looked upon him with a smiling
countenance, and' still beckoning to him; at
length he came close to me, and kneeled down,
kissed the ground, laid his head upon it, and
taking me by the foot, set it upon his head;
which, as I understood afterwards, was a token of
swearing to be my slave for ever. I took him
up, and making much of him, encouraged him in
the best manner I could. The greatest asto-
nishment that my new servant conceived, was
at the manner of killing the savage at such a
distance, without a bow and arrow; and such
was his longing desire to know it, that he first
pointed to the dead carcase, and then made signs
to me to grant him leave to go to it Upon
which I bid him go, and, as well as I could,
made him sensible I granted his request. But
when he came there how wonderfully was he
struck with amazement! First, he turned it oh
one side, then on another, wondering he could
perceive no quantity of blood, he bleeding in-
wardly: and after sufficiently admiring the
wound the bullet had made in the breast, he took
up his bow and arrows, and came back again;
upon which, I turned to go away, making signs
to him to follow, lest the rest missing their com-
panion, might r'3e in pursuit of him, and this 1
Found he :mdirstood very well, by making me to
understand that his design was to bury it, that it
might not be seen; and which by signs again 1
made him sensible I very much approved of.
Immediately he fell to work, and never was grave-
digger more dexterous in the world than he was;
for in an ins'ant, as I might say, he scraped a
large hole in the sands with his hands, sufficient
to bury it in; there he dragged it, and, without
any ceremony, covered it over. I then called
him away, and instead of carrying him directly to
my castle at first, I conveyed him to my cave
on the farther part of the island.
Weary and faint, hungry and thirs'Vl undoubt-
edly must this poor creature be, supported chiefly
by the vivacity of spirit, and uncommon trans-
ports of joy that his deliverance occasioned.
Here I gave him bread and a bunch of raisins to
oat, and water to drink, on which he fed very
cheerfully, to his exceeding refreshment. I theh
made him a convenient bed, with a parcel of rice
straw, and a blanket upon it, (a bed which I used

J
myself sometimes,) and then pointing to it, made
signs for him to lie down to sleep, upon which
the poor creature went to take a welcome re-
pose.
Indeed he was a very comely, handsome,
young fellow, extremely well made, with straight
long limbs, not too large, but tall and well shaped,
artd, as near as I could reckon, about twenty-six
years of age. His countenance had nothing in
it fierce or surly, but rather a sort of majesty
in his face; and especially when he smiled, he
had all the sweetness of a European. His hair
was not ciirled like wool, as many of the blacks
are, but long and black, with the most beautiful,
yet careless tresses spreading over his shoulders.
He had a very high and large forehead, with a
great vivacity and sparkling sharpness in his
eyes. His skin was not so tawny as that of the
Americans; but rather of a light dun olive
colour, that had something agreeable in it, though
not very easy to give a description of. His face
was round and plump, with a small nose, very
different from the flatness of the negroes, a pretty
small mouth, thin lips, fine teeth, very well set,
and white as the driven snow. In a word, such
handsome features, and exact symmetry in every
part, made me consider, that I had saved the life
of an Indian prince, no less graceful and accom-
plished than the great Oroonoke, whose memo-
rable behaviour and unhappy contingencies of
life, have charmed the world, both to admiration
of his person, and compassion for his sufferings.
He had not, I think; slept above an hour, when
he awaked again, and while I was milking my
10
goats hard by, out he runs from the cave towards
me in my enclosure, and laying himself down on
the ground in the lowest prostration, made all the
antic gestures imaginable, to express his thank-
fulness to me for being his deliverer. He laid
down his head again upon the ground, close to
my foot, and set my other foot upon his head, as
he had done before, making all the signs of sub-
jection, servitude, and submission imaginable, to
let me understand he would serve me as long as
his life endured. As I understood him in many
things, I made him sensible I was very well
pleased with him; and, in a little time, I began
to speak to him, and teach him how to talk to me
again.
In the first place, I made him understand his
name was to be Friday, because it was upon that
day I saved his life; I then taught him to say
Master, which I made him sensible was to be my
name; I likewise taught him to say yes and no,
and to know what they meant. I gave him some
milk in an earthen pot, making him view me
while I drank it before him, and soaked my bread
in it; I gave him a cake of bread, and caused
him to soak it likewise, to which he readily con-
sented, making signs of the greatest satisfaction
imaginable.
All that night did I keep him there; but no
sooner did the morning light appear, than 1 order-
ed him to arise and come along with me, with cer-
tain tokens that I would give him some clothes
like mine, at which he seemed very glad, being
stark naked, without the least covering whatever.
As we passed by the place where the man had
been interred, my man pointed directly to his
grave, showing me the marks that he had made
to find it again, giving me to understand, by
signs, that we should dig him up and devour him.
At this I appeared extremely displeased, express-
ed my utmost abhorrence, as if I would vomit at
the apprehensions of it, beckoning with my hand
to come away, which he did with the greatest
reverence and submission. After this, I con-
ducted him to the top of the hill, to view if the
rest of the savages were yet remaining there;
but when I looked through my perspective glass,
I could see no appearance of them, nor of their
canoes; so that it was very evident they never
minded their deceased companion whom we had
slain; which if they had, they would surely have
searched for or left one boat behind for him to
follow, after he returned from his pursuit.
Curiosity, and a desire of satisfaction, anima-
ting me with courage, to see this scene of barba-
rity, I took my man Friday with me to the place
of their bloody entertainment. But when I came
there, I was struck with the utmost horror at so
dreadful a spectacle, whilst Friday was no way
concerned about it, being no doubt in his turn,
one of these devourers. Here lay several human
bones, there several pieces of mangled flesh,
half eaten, mangled and scorched, whilst streams
of blood ran promiscuously as water from a
fountain. As I was musing on this dreadful
sight, Friday took all the pains he could by par-
ticular signs, to make me understand that they
had brought over four prisQners to feast upont
three of whom they had eaten up, and that he
was the fourth, pointing to himself: that there
having been a bloody battle between them and
his great king, in the just defence of whom he
was taken prisoner, with many others; all of
these were carried off to different places to be
devoured by their conquerors; and that it was
his fortune to be brought hither by these wretches
for the very same purpose.
After I was made sensible of these things, I
caused Friday to gather those "horrid remains,
and lay them together upon a heap, which I
ordered to be set on fire, and burnt them to
fishes; my man, however, still retained the na-
ture of a cannibal, having a hankering stomach
after some of the flesh: but such an extreme
.abhorrence did I express at the least appearance
.of it, that he durst not but conceal it; for I made
him very sensible, that if he attempted any such
thing, I would certainly shoot him.
This being done, I carried my man with me to
my castle, and gave him a pair of linen drawers,
which I had taken out of the poor gunner's chest
before mentioned; and which, with a little altera-
tion, fitted him very well: in the next place, I
made him a jerkin of goat skin, such as my skill
was able to manage, and indeed I thought myself
then a tolerably good tailor. I gave him also a
cap, which I made of a hare's skin, very conve-
nient and fashionable. Thus being clothed to-
lerably well, my man was no less proud of his
habit than I was at seeing him in it. Indeed he
went very awkwardly at first, but by use, at length
he took to them very well.
My next concern was, where I should lodge
- '* —
him; and that I might do well by him, and yet
be perfectly easy myself, I erected a tent for
him in the vacant place between my two fortifi-
cations, in the inside of the last, and the outside
of the first; and as there was an entrance or
door into my cave, I made a formal framed door-
case, and a door to open on the inside; J barred
it up jn the night-time, taking in my ladders Joo,
so that, was my man to prove treacherpus, there
could be no way to come at me in the inside of
my innermost wall, without making so much
noise in getting over, that it must needs wakei)
me; for my first wall had now a complete roof
over it of long poles, spreading oyer my tent,
and leaning up to the side of the mountain, which
was again laid across with smaller sticks instead
of laths, and thatched over to a great thickness
with the rice straw, which was as strong as reeds;
and at the hole of the place, left on purpose to
go in or out by the ladder, I had placed a kind of
a trap-door, which, if i). had beep attempted on
the outside, would nof have opened at ajl, but
have fallen down, and made a great noise; and
as to my weapons, every night I took fhem all to
my bed-side.
But there was no opcasipn for this precaution;
for surely never Master had a more sincere,
faithful and loving servant than Friday proved to
me. Without passion, sullenness, or design,
perfectly obliging afld engaging, his affections
were as much tied to me as those of a child to
bis parents; and I might venture to say, he
would have sacrificed his life for the saving of
mine, upon any occasion whatsoever, and, in-
10*
deed, the many testimonies he gave me of this,
sufficiently convinced me that I had no occasion
to use all these precautions.
I had not been above two or three days returned
to my castle, but my chief design was, how I
should bring Friday off from his horrid way of
feeding; and, to take from him that inhuman
relish he by habit had been accustomed to, 1
thought it my duty to let him taste other flesh,
which might the rather tempt him to the same
abhorrence I so often expressed against their
accursed way of living. Upon which, one morn-
ing, I took him out with me, with an intention to
kill a kid out of the flock, and bring it home,
and dress it. As I was going, I perceived a she
goat lying down in the shade, and two young kids
sitting by her. Immediately I catched hold of my
man Friday, and bidding him stand still, and not
stir, I presented my piece, and shot one of tht kids.
My poor servant, who had at a distance perceived
me kill his adversary, and yet did not know by
what means, or how it was done, stood trembling
and surprised, and looked so amazed, that I
thought he would have sunk into the earth. He
did net see the kid I aimed at, or behold I had
Mtled it, but ripped up his waistcoat to see if he
"vas not wounded, thinking my resolution was to
WW him; for coming to me, he fell on his knees
earnestly pronouncing many things which 1 did
not understand the meaning of; which at length
i perceived was, that I would not take awuy his
life. Indeed, so much compassion had I for this
sreature, that it was with difficulty I refiained
from t«,,.T3. \5ut, however, as another sort of
countenance was necessary, and to convince him
that I would do him no harm, I took him, smiling,
by the hand, then laughed at him, and pointing to
the kid which I had slain, made signs to him to
fetch it, which accordingly he did. No less cu-
rious was he in viewing how the creature was
killed, than he was before in beholding the In-
dian; which, while he was admiring, I charged
my gun again, and presently perceived a great
fowl like a hawk, perching upon a tree within
shot; and, therefore, to let Friday understand
what I was going to do, I called him to me again,
pointing at the fowl, which I found to be a parrot.
I made him understand that I would shoot and
kill that bird; accordingly I fired, and bade him
look, when immediately he saw the parrot fall
down. Again he stood like one amazed, not-
withstanding all I had said to him: and the more
confounded he was, because he did not perceive
me put any thing in my gun. As for it in par-
ticular, he would not so much as touch it for
several days after; but would come and com-
municate his thoughts to it, and talk to it, as if
the senseless piece had understood and answered
him; all this I could perceive him to do, when
he thought my back was turned, the chief intent
of which was, to desire it not to kill him, as I
afterward came to understand.
I never strove to prevent his admiration, nor
hinder him from these comical gestures he used
on such occasions; but when hi* astonishment
was a little over, I made tokens to him to run
and fetch the parrot that I had shot; which ac-
cordingly ho did, staying somo time longer than
Usual, by reason that the bird not being quite
dead, had fluttered some way farther from the
place where she fell. In the mean time, as he
was looking for her, I took the advantage of
charging my gun again, that so I might be ready
for any other mark that offered; but nothing
more occurred at the time. So I brought home
the kid, and the same evening too'*!; oft" the skin,
and divided the carcase as weil as'1 could. Part
of the flesh I stewed and boiled in a po't I had for
this purpose. And then, spreading my table, I
sat down, giving my man some of it to cat, who
was wonderfully pleased, and seemed to like it
x ery well: but what was the most surprising to
him was to see me eat salt with t: upon which
he made me understand, that the salt was very
bad for me; when putting a little into his mouth,
he seemed to nauseate it in such a manner, as to
spit and sputter at it, and then washed his mouth
with fresh water: but to show him how contrary
iii? opinion was to mine, I put some meat into
\ny mouth without salt, and feigned to spit and
sputter as much for want of it, as he had done
at it; yet all this proved of no signification to
Friday, and it was a long while before he could
endure ariy salt in his meat or bfc-th, and even
then but a small quantity.
Thus, having fed him sufficiently with bbill;8
meat and broth at that time, the next day I wiiS
Resolved to feast him with a roasted piecfe of tHfe
kid. And having no spit to fasten it, nor jack to
turn it, I made use of that common artifice which
many of the people of England have, that is, to
Ktet two poles iij ou each side of the fire, and one
across on the top, hanging the meat thereon with
a string, and so turning it round continually, till
it was sufficiently roasted. This practice caused
great admiration in my man Friday, being quite
another way than that to which the savages were
accustomed. But when he came to taste the
sweetness and tenderness of the flesh, he ex-
pressed his entire satisfaction above a thousand
different ways. As I could not but understand
his meaning, you may be sure I was as wonder-
fully pleased, especially when he made it also
very plain to me, that he would never, while he
lived, eat man's flesh more.
It was now high time I should set my new ser-
vant to work; so next day, I put him to beat out
some corn, and sift it in the same manner as I
had done before. And really the fellow was very
quick and handy in the execution of any thing I
ordered him to go about. I made him understand
that it was to make bread for us to eat, and after-
wards let him see me bake it. In short, he did
every thing as I ordered him in a little time as
well as I could perform it myself.
But now, considering that I had two mouths
to feed instead of one, it was necessary that I
should provide more ground for my harvest, and
plant a larger quantity of corn than I commonly
used to do; upon which, I marked out a larger
piece of land, fencing it in the same manner as
I had done before; in the execution of which, I
must give Friday this good word, mat no man
could work more hardy, or with better will than
fee did; and when I made him sensible that it
wan for bread to serve him as well as me, he then
rery passionately made me understand; that he'
thought I had much more labour on his account
than I had for myself; and that no pains or dili-
gence should be wanting in him", if I would but
direct him in those works, wherein he might pro-
ceed.
I must certainly own, that this was the most
pleasant year I ever had in the island; for after
some time, Friday began to talk pretty well, and
understood the names of those thmgs which I
was wont to call for, and the places where I usfed
to send him. Sd that my long silent tongue,
which had been so many years unused, except
when praying to God; or conversing with my poll,
now began to be occupied in teaching, and talk-
ing to my man Friday; for indeed I had such a
singular satisfaction in the fellow himself, so
innocent did his simple and Unfeigned honesty
appear more and more every day; that I really
began entirely to love him; and, for his part, I
believe there was no love lost, and that his nature
had been more charmed by my exceeding kind-
ness, and his affection more placed upon me', that
upon any other object whatsoever among his owii
countrymen.
I once had a great desire to try if he had any
hankering inclination to his own country again:
and by this tinle. having taught him English so
well, that he could .give me tolerable answers to
any question which I demanded, I asked him
whether that nation to which he belonged evei
'conquered inbattle? This question madeFriday
smile, and to which he answered, "Yes, yes, we
%lways fight the better;" as much to say, they
**^*^Mlpc^gB - - - 'fc-t-tirt:1 --'-- --:------- ". :-^'--_" . ---- ,-
always got the better in fight. You say, saia I,
that you always fight the better; why then, Fri-
day, how came you to be taken prisoner \
Friday. But for ail that, my nation beat much.
Master. How, say you, beat! if your nation
beat then, how came you to be taken 1
Friday. The more many mans than my na-
tion, in the place where me was, they take one-,
two, three and me; my nation much overheat
them in the yonder place where me no was, there
my nation mans beat one, two, three great thou-
sands'.
Master. Then why did not your men recover
yog from the hands of your enemies I
Friday. They run one, two, or three, and
me; tney make all go into the canoe; my nation
have no canoe that time.
Matter. 'Tis very well, Friday; but what
does your nation do with the prisoners they take;
Do they carry them away and eat them as they
have done 1
Friday- Yes, yes, my nation eat mans too,
eat up all.
Master* To what place do they carry them
to be devoured?
Friday. Go to other nations where they think.
Master. Do they bring them hither?
^Friday. Yes, come over hither, come over
other place.
Master. And have you been with them here,
Friday?
Friday. Yes, me been here, (pointing to the
north-west of the island, being the side where
they used to land.
Thus having gotten what account I could from
my man, I plainly understood-, that he had been
as bad as any of the rest of the cannibals, having
been formerly among the savages who used to
come on shore on the farthest part of the island,
upon the same bloody occasions as he was
brought hither for: and some time after, I carried
him to that place where he pointed; and no
sooner did he come there, but he presently knew
the ground, signifying to me that he was once
there when they ate up twenty men, two women
and a young child; but as he could not explain
the number in English, he did it by so man)
stones in a row, making a sign to me to count
them.
My next question was, how far it was from the
island to the shore, and whether canoes were not
often lost in the ocean? to which he answered,
there was no danger; that no canoes were evei
lost; but that after a little way out to the sea,
there was a strong current, and a wind always
one way, in the afternoon. This I thought at
first to be no more than the sets of tide, of going
out or coming in; but I afterwards understood
it was occasioned by the great draught and reflux,
of the mighty river Oroonoko, in the mouth or
gulph of which, I imagined my kingdom lay;
and that the land which I perceived to the west,
and north-west must be the great island Trinidad,
on the north of the river.
Well, you may be sure, this knowledge, which
the imperfect information of my man had led me
to, was very comfortable to me, and made me so
curious as to ask him, how I might depart from

this island, and get amongst those white men?
He told me, "Yes, yes, I might go in two canoes."
In two canoes, thought I, what does my man
mean. And, indeed it was. a Jong time before I
understood his meaning, which was, that it must
be a large boat, as big as two canoes, able to
bear with the waves, and not so liable to be over-
whelmed as one must be.
I believe there is no state of life but what may
be happy, if people would but endeavour for their
part to make it so. He is not the happiest man
that has the most riches, but he that is content
with what he hath. Before I had my servant, 1
thought myself miserable till I had him; and
now that I had enjoyed the happy benefits of him,
I still complained, and begged a deliverance from"
a place of retirement, ease and plenty, where
Providence had sufficiently blessed me. . In a
word, from this time, I entertained some hopes,
that one time or other, I might find an opportunity
to make my escape from this island, and that this
poor savage might be a jn;reat furtherance thereto:
I now began to instruct my servant, in the
saving knowledge of the true Deity, in which
the directions of God's holy Spirit assisted inc.
Friday, said I, you must know, that before this
world was made, there was an Almighty Being
existing, by whose power all things were made,
and whose majesty shall have no end. To be
glorified and adored by beings of a heavenly
nature, he created angels and archangels, that
is, glorified spirits resembling himself to en-
compass his throne, eternally singing forth his
11
praise, in the most heavenly sounds and divine
harmony.
I found it easy enough to imprint the right
notions in his mind of God: for nature assisted
me in all my arguments, to show him plainly the
necessity of a great and overruling, governing
power, of a secret directing providence, and of
the equity and reasonableness of paying adora-
tion to our Creator.
I then entered into a long discourse with him,
upon the subject of the world's redemption by
the Saviour of it, and the doctrine of repentance
preached from heaven, together with an holy faith
in our blessed Redeemer Jesus Christ.
By the constant application 1 made of the
Scriptures, as I read them to my man Friday, I
earnestly endeavoured to make him understand
every part of them as much, as lay in my power.
He also, on the other hand, by his very serious
questions and enquiries, made me a much better
proficient' in Scripture knowledge, than I should
have been by my own private reading and study.
You may well suppose, that, by the frequent
discourse we had together, my man and I be-
came most intimately acquainted, and that there
was very little that I could say, but what Friday
understood; and indeed, he spoke very fluently,
though it was but broken English. I now took
a particular pleasure in relating all my adventures,
especially those that occurred since my being
cast on this island. I made him understand that
wonderful mystery, as he conceived, of gunpowder
fclJ mllet, and taught him how to shoot. I also
presented to him a knife, which pleased him ex-
ceedingly, making him a belt, with a frog hang-
ing thereto, like those in which we wear hangers
in England; and instead of a hanger to put in
the frog, I gave him a hatchet, which was not
only as good, but even a better weapon upon many
occasions. In a word my man thus accoutred,
looked upon himself as great as Don Quixote,
when that celebrated champion went to combat
the windmill.
I next gave him a very particular description
of my misfortune in being shipwrecked; show-
ing him, as near as I could the place where the
ship lay, which had been gone long before; but
I brought him to the ruins of my boat, which, be-
fore, my whole strength could not move, but now
was almost rotten and fallen to pieces. I ob-
served my man Friday to view this boat with an
uncommon curiosity; which when he had done,
he stood pondering a great while, and said no-
thing,. At last, said I, Friday, what makes you
ponder so much "i He replied, "0 master, me
see like boat come to place at my nation."
It was some time, indeed, before I understood
what my man meant; but examining strictly into
it, I plainly found, that such another boat, re-
sembling mine, had come upon the country where
he dwelt: that is to say, by his farther explana-
tion, that the boat was driven there through stress
of weather.
Indeed Friday answered my demands very
well, making every thing plain to my understand-
ing; but beyond measure was I satisfied when he
toW mc with great warmth and ardour, "0 mas-
ter, we save white mans from drown;" upon
which I immediately asked him, if there were
any white mans, as he called them, in the boat;
"Yes, ves," said he, "the boat full, very full of
white mans." How many, Friday, said I. Here-
upon he numbered his fingers, and counted seven-
teen. And when I asked him what became of
them all, and whether they lived or not? he re-
plied, "Yes, master, they all live, they be live
among my nation." This information put fresh
thoughts into my head, that these must be the
very men who before I concluded had been
swallowed up in the ocean, after they had left
their ship that had struck upon the rocks of my
kingdom, and after escaping the fury of the deep,
landed upon the wild shore, and committed them-
selves to the fury of the devouring Indians.
The manner of their cruelties to one another,
which consequently, as I thought, must be acted
with greater barbarity to strangers, created in me
a great anxiety, and made me still more curious
to ask Friday concerning them. He told me, hje
was suro they still lived there, having resided
among them above four years, and that the sav-
ages gave them victuals to live upon. But pray,
Friday, said I, whence proceeded all this good
nature and generosity? How came it to pass that
they did not kill and eat them, to please their
devouring appetites; and occasion so splendid
an entertainment among them ?" No, no,"
said Friday, "they not kill 'em, they make bro-
ther with 'em;" by which I understood there was
a truce between them. And then I had a more
favourable ooinion of the Indians, upon Fri8ay>s
uttering the words: "My nation t'other natiqn
no eat man's but when mans make war fight:"
as though he had said, that neither those of his
kingdom, nor any other nations that he knew of,
ever ate their fellow-creatures, but such as their
law of arms allowed to be devoured: that is,
those miserable captives, whose misfortune it
should be to be made prisoners of war.
Some considerable time after, upon a very plea-
sant (Jay, in most serene weather, my man and I
stood upon the top of a hill, on the island, whence
I had once before beheld the continent of Ame-
rica. I could not tell immediately what was the
matter: for suddenly Friday, fell a jumping and
dancing as if he had been mad; and upon my
demanding the reason of his behaviour, " 0 joy,"
said he, "0 glad! there see my country, there
my nation, there white mans gether." And in-
deed such a rapturous sense of pleasure, ap-
peared in his countenance, that his eyes had an
uncommon sparkling and brightness, and such a
strange eagerness, as if he had a longing desire to
be in his own country again. This made me not
so well satisfied with my man Friday as before;
for by this appearance, I made no dispute, but
that if he could get back thither again, he would
not paly be unmindful of what religion I had
taught him, but likewise of the great obligation
he owed me for his wonderful deliverance; nay,
that he would not only inform his countrymen of
me, but accompany hundreds of them to my
kingdom, and make me a miserable sacrifice, like
those unhappy wretches taken in battle.
, indeed I was very much to blame to have
11*
these cruel, and unjust suspicions, and must freely
own I wronged the poor creature very much,
who was of a quite contrary temper. And had
he had that discerning acuteness which many
Europeans have, he would certainly have per-
ceived my coldness and indifference, and also
have been very much concerned upon that ac-
count.'
As we were walking up the same hill another
day, when the weather was so hazy at sea, that I
could not perceive the continent, Friday, said I,
don't you wish yourself to be in your own country
your own nation, among your old friends and ac-
quaintances? "Yes," said he, " me much 0 glad
to be at ray own nation." And what would you
do there, Friday? Would you turn wild again, eat
man's flesh, and be a savage as you were for-
merly 1 "No, no," (answered he, full of con-
cern, and shaking his head,) "Friday now tell
them to live good, tell them pray God, tell them
to eat corn, bread, cattle, flesh, milk, no eat man
again." But surely, replied I, if you should
offer to do all this, they will kill you; and to
manifest their contempt of such instruction, eat
you up when they have done. He then put on a
grave, yet innocent and smooth countenance,
saying, "No, they no kill me, they willing love
learn:" that is, that they would be very willing
to learn: adding withal, "that they had learned
very much of the bearded mans that came in the
boat." Will you, said I, go back again, Friday?
He smiled at that, and told me, that he could not
swim so far. But said I, I will make a canoe
for you: "Ye» master," oaid he, "me go if you
go, tne no go if you stay." I go, Friday! why
would you have them eat me up, and devour your
kind master 1 "No, no," said he, "me make
them no eat master, and me make them much
love you;" that is, he would tell them how I had
slain his enemies, and thereby saved his life, for
which reason he would make them love me: and
then he related to me, as well as he was able,
how exceeding kind those of his nation were to
the white, or bearded men, as he called them,
who in their great calamity, Were driven into their
country.
It was from" this time, indeed, I had strong in*
clinations to venture over* and use my utmost
efforts, if possible, to join with these white beard-
ed men, who undoubtedly were Spaniards or
Portuguese; for, thought I, it must be certainly
a better and safer way, to escape when there is a
good company, than for me alone, from an island
forty miles off the shore, and without any assist-
ance. Some days after, Friday and I being at
work, as usual* at the same time diverting our-
selves with various discourses, I told him I had a
boat which I would bestow upon him, whenever
he pleased to return to his own nation: and to
convince him of the truth of what I said, I took
him with me to the other side of the island, where
my "frigate lay, and then taking it from under
water, (for I always kept it sunk for fear of a
discovery,) we both went into it to see how it
would manage such an expedition.
And really never could any be more dexterous
in rowing than my faithful servant, making the
boat go as fast again as I could. Well, now,
Friday, said I, shall we now go to your much
desired nation? But, instead of meeting with
that cheerfulness I expected, he looked very dull
and melancholy at my saying so; which indeed
at first surprised me, till he made me sensible,
that his concern was about the boat's being too
small to go so far a voyage. Upon which, I let
him understand I had a much bigger; and ac-
cordingly, the next day went to the place, where
the first boat lay, which I had made, when all the
strength I had, or art I could use) failed me in
my attempt to get it into the water: but now it
having lain in the sun two and twenty years, and
ho care being taken of it all that while, it be-
came in a manner rotten. My man told me,
that such a boat would do very well for the
purpose, sufficient to carry "enough vittle, dring,
bread," for that was his manner of talking. In
short, my mind being strongly fixed, upon my
design of going over with him to the continent,
1 very plainly told him, that we would both go
and make a boat full as big, and more propor-
tionable than that, wherein he might safely re-
turn to his own nation.
Go your way, since you desire it, and leave
me alone by myself, as I was before I saved
vc-ar life.
Never was any creature more thunderstruck
than Friday was at these words, "Go me away,
leave master away," said he, after a long silence,
*• No, no, Friday die, Friday live not master
gone;" as though he had said, I neither can nor
will live, if my master sends me from him.
Friday felt towards me the greatest gratitude,
and the most sincere love; he found me not only
his deliverer, but his preserver and comforter;
not a severe and cruel tyrant, but a kind, loving,
and affable friend. He wanted for no manner of
sustenance; and when he was ill, or out of order,
I was his physician) not only for his body, but
his soul; and therefore no wonder was it, that
such an innocent creature, long since divested of
his former natural cruelty^ should have an un-
common concern at so cruel a separation from
me, which pierced him to the very soul, and
made him desire even to die, rather than live
without me.
After I had told Friday, in a very careless
manner, that he should be at his liberty as soon
as the boat was made, the language of his eyes
expressed all imaginable confusion; when, inv
mediately running to one of his hatchets, which
he used to wear as a defensive weapon, he gives
it into my hand, with a heart so full, that he could
scarcely speak. Friday, said I, what is it you
mean 1 What must I do with this?" Only kill
Friday," said he, "Friday care not live long."
But what must I kill you for? replied I again.
"Ah, dear master, what made you Friday save
from eat a me up, so keep long Friday, make Fri-
day love God, and now Friday send away, never
see Friday more." Arid while he spoke thus, the
tears ran down his cheeks in such a plentiful
manner, that I had much ado to refrain from
weeping also when I beheld the poor creature's
affection: so that I was forced to comfort him in
the best manner I could, which I did, by telling
130 LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF
him, if he was content to abide with me, I should
bo over willing to keep him.
After Friday's grief was somewhat abated,
more fully to convince me of his affection, he
said, " 0 master, me not care to be in my nation,
leave you here, me desire nation learn good,
that's all:" meaning, that his desire was for the
conversion of that barbarous people: and that
he wished me to go with him. And indeed, I
began to desire to go also, from my late discourse
with Friday, about these seventeen white beard-
ed men, that had been driven upon the barbarian
coast; whom I designed to join, as the only
means to further our escape. To which intent,
my man and I went to search for a proper tree to
fell, whereof we might make a perigua or canoe,
to undertake the voyage; and, indeed, we were
not long in finding one fit for our purpose, there
being enough of wood in the island to have built
a fleet of lurge vessels, but the thing we prin-
cipally wanted, was, to get one so near the water,
that we might launch it after it was finished, and
not commit so horrid a mistake as I had done
once before.
Well, after a great search for what was best
and most convenient, Friday, at last, whose judg-
ment in such affairs was much superior to mine,
pitches upon a kind of wood the most fitting for
it. But though my man exceeded me in the
knowledge of the most proper tree, yet I showed
him a much better and cleaner way to make a
'canoe than ever he knew before; for he wus for
burning the hollow or cavity of the tree, m order
to make this boat; but I then told hitn how we
might do with tools, teaching him at the same
time how to use them, which indeed he did very
dexterously; so that in a month's time we finish-
ed i% making it very handsome, by cutting the
outside in the true shape of a boat. After this,
it took us a full fortnight before we could get her
into the water, which we did, as it were, inch by
inch, upon great rollers: but when she was in,
she would have carried twenty men, with ail the
ease imaginable.
As I was very well pleased, you may be
sure, at the launching of this man of war of mine,
I was no less amazed to behold with what dex-
terity my man could manage her, turn her, and
paddle her along. Well, Friday, said I, what
:do you think of it now 1 Do you think this will
carry us over?" Yes, master," said he, "we
venture over well, though great blow wind." But
my design was yet farther, which he was insen-
sible of; and that to make a mast and a sail,
and provide her with an anchor and cable. As
to a mast that was no difficult thing at all to pro-
cure: so fixing upon a straight young cedar tree,
which I found near the place* (great plenty of it
abounding in the island,) and setting Friday to
cut it down, I gave him particular directions how
to shape and order it; but as to the sail, that, I
managed myself. I very well knew I had some
old ones, or pieces of sails enough, which had
lain six and twenty years by me; but not being
'careful to preserve them, as thinking I should
have no occasion to use them any more, when I
came to look over them, I found them almost all
rotten, except two; and with these I went to
work, and after a great deal of pains and awk-
ward tedious stitching for want of needles, at
length I finished a three-cornered ugly thing like
that we call in England, a shoulder of mutton
sail, to go with a boom at the bottom, and a small
sprit at the top, like those which our long-boats
use, and which I very well knew how to manage,
especially since it was like that which I had in
my patron's fishing-boat, when with my boy
Xury, I made my escape from the barbarian
shore.
It was nearly two months, I think, before I
completed this work, that is, the rigging, and
fitting up my mast and sails; and indeed they
were nicely done, having made a small stay, and
a sail, or foresail to it, to assist, if we should
turn to the windward; and, which was still more,
I fixed a rudder to the stern of her, to steer with;
and though I was but a very indifferent ship-wright,
"yet, as I was sensible of the great usefulness
and absolute necessity of a thing like this, I ap-
plied myself to it with such a constant applica-
tion, that at last I accomplished my design; but
what with the many dull contrivances I had
-about it, and the failure of many things, it cost
tne as much pains in ordering as in making the
boat. Besides, when all this was done, I had
my man to teach what belonged to its navigation;
for though he very well understood how to pad-
dle a canoe alone, he was an utter stranger to a
sail and a rudder, arid was amazed when he saw
me work the boat to and again in the sea, by
them, and how the sail jibbed and filled this way
or that way, as the course we sailed changed.
After some time, and a little use, I made all these
things very familiar to him, so that he becdme an
expert sailor, except in relation to the compass,
and that I could make him understand but little
of. But as it happened, there was seldom oc-
casion for it, there being but little cloudy weather,
and scarcely any fog in those parts; the stars
were always visible in the night, and the shore
by day, except in the rainy season, which con-
fined every one to his habitation. Thus entered
into the seven and twentieth year of my reign
or captivity, which you please, (the last three of
which, blessed with the company of my man
Friday, ought not to be reckoned,) I kept the
anniversary of my landing here with the same
thankfulness to God for his tender mercies, as I
did before; and certainly as I had great cause
for thankful acknowledgment for my deliverance
at first, I had much greater now for such singular
and additional testimonies of the care of Provi-
dence over me, in all my distresses of both body
and mind, and the great hopes I had of being
effectually and speedily delivered; for I had a
strong impression upon my mind, that I should
not be another year in this island. But, how-
ever, I still continued on with my husbandry,
digging, planting, and fencing as usual: gather-
ing and curing my grapes, and doing all other
things that were necessary.
And now the rainy season beginning to come
on, obliged me to keep the longer within doors;
but before this, I brought my new vessel into the
creek, where I had landed my rafts, from the
12
ship; so we waited for the months of November
and DccemDer, in which I designed to venture
over the ocean.
No sooner did the seasonable weather begin
to draw near, but so much was I elevated with
this new designed adventure, that I daily pre-
pared for the voyage. The first thing that 1
thought on was, to lay by a certain quantity of
provisions, as a sufficient store for such an expe-
dition, intending in a week or a fortnight's time
to open the dock, and launch out the boat for that
purpose. But one morning, as I was very busy
upon something necessary for this occasion, I
called Friday to me, and bid him to go to the
sea-shore, and see if he could find a turtle or
tortoise, a thing which we commonly had once a
week, as much upon account of the eggs, as for
the sake of the flesh. He had not been long
gone, but he came running back, as though he
was pursued for life, and as it were flew over my
outer wall, or fence, like one that felt not the
ground, or steps he set his feet on: before i had
time to enquire the reason of his precipitation,
he cries out, " 0 dear master, 0 sorrow! sorrow!
Bad! O bad!" Why, what's the matter, Fri-
day? said I. "0 yonder, yonder," said he
"there be one, two, three canoes! two, three."
Surely (thought I,) there must be six, by my
man's way of reckoning; but on a stricter en
quiry, I found there were but three. Well, Friday,
said I, don't be terrified. I warrant you we will
defend ourselves against them But though I
comforted him in the best manner I could, the
poor creature trembled so, that I scarcely knew
what to do with him: "0, master," said he,
41 they come look Friday, cut pieces Friday, cut
a me up."
Why, Friday, said I, they will eat me up as
well as you, and my danger is as great as your's.
But since it is so, we must resolve to fight for
our lives. What say you 1 Can you fight Fri-
day 1 "Yes," said he very faintly, "me shoot,
me kill what I can, but there come great many
number." That's no matter, said I again, our
guns will terrify those that we do not kill; I am
very willing to stand by you to the last drop of
my blood.
Now, tell me, if you will do the like by me,
and obey my orders in whatsoever I command I
Friday then answered, "0 master, me lose life,
for you, me die when you bid die." Thus con-
cluding all questions' concerning his fidelity, I
ordered him to take the two fowling pieces, which,
we always carried, and load them with large
swan-shot, as big as small pistol bullets; then I
took four muskets and loaded them with two
slugs, and five small bullets each; charging my
two pistols each with a brace, I hung my great
sword, as customary, naked to my side, and
gave Friday his hatchet, as a most excellent
weapon for defence.
Thus prepared, I took my perspective glass,
and went up to the side of the hill, to see what I
could discover; and I perceived very soon, by
my glass, that there were one and twenty savages,
three prisoners, and three canoes, and their chief
concern seemed to be the triumphant banquet
upon three poor human bodies, a thing which by
this time I had observed was very common with
them. UpoD which I called to Friday; and
showing him a great tree, that was just at the
corner of the wood, near which they were, I
ordered him to repair thither, and bring me word,
if he could plainly perceive their actions; accord-
ingly he did as J .commanded him, and came back
with this melancholy story, that they were all
about their $re, eating the flesh of one of their
prisoners; and that another lay bound upon the
sand, a little distance from them, whom they
designed for their next sacrifice; and this he
told me, was not one of their nation, but one of
those very bearded men, who was driven by a
storm into their country, and whom he had so
often spoken to me about. You may be sure,
that, upon hearing this, my souj was ready to
sink within me; when ascending up into a tree,
I saw plainly, by my glass, a white man, who lay
upon the beach of the sea, with his hands tied
with flags or things resembling rushes, being
covered with clothes, and seerning to be an Euro*
pean. From the tree where I took this pnospect,
I perceived another tree, and a thicket beyond it,
about fifty yards nearer to them that where I was,
which by taking a small circle round, I might
come at undiscovered, and then I should be with-
in half a shot of these devourers. I therefore
got behind some bushes, which held all the way
till I came to the other tree; and then I ascended
to a little rising ground, not above eighteen yards
distance, and there I had a .full view of these
creatures, and could perceive all their actions.
Such a sight did then appear, as obliged me
noniNSON cnusoE. . 137
not to lose a moment's time. No less than
nineteen of these dreadful wretches sat upon the
ground, close huddle/1 together, expressing all
the delight imaginable at so barbarous an enter-
tainment; and they had just sent the other two
.to murder this poor unhappy Christian, and bring
him limb by limb to their tire; for they were then
just going to untie the bands from his feet.
Hereupon, immediately turning to my man,
Now, Friday, said I, mind what I say, fail in
nothing, but do exactly as you see me do. All
which he promising to perform, I set down one
of my muskets, and the fowling-piece upon the
ground, and Friday did the same by his; and
with the other musket I took my aim at ihe sav-
ages, bidding him to do the like; are you ready,
said I; "Y.es, muster," said he, why then fire at
them said I; and at that very moment I gave
fire likewise.
I only killed one and wounded two: but my
man Friday, taking his aim much better than I,
killed two, and wounded three. You may be
sure they were in a dreadful consternation, at
such an unexpected disaster; and those who had
yet escaped our penetrating shot, immediately
jumped upon their feet, but were in such a con-
fusion, that they knew not which way to nui'-or
look; not knowing from whence their destruction
came. We threw down oar pieces, and took up
others, giving a second dreadful volley; but as
they were only loaded with swan-shot or small
pistol bullets, we perceived only two of them
fall, though many were wounded who ran yelling
"and screaminT about like mad creatures. Now,
12*
138 IIPB AND ABVIKTCRBS OF
Friday, said I lay, down your piece, and take up
the musket, and follow me. He did so with
great courage, when showing ourselves to the
savages, we gave a great shout, and made direct-
ly to the poor victim, who would have been sa-
crificed, had not our first fire obliged the butch-
ers, with three others, to jump into a canoe.
By my order, Friday fired at them, at which shot
I thought he had killed them all, by reason of
their falling to the bottom of the boat; however
he killed two, and mort#lly wounded a third. In
the. mean time I cut the flags that tied the hands
and feet of the poor creature, and lifting him up,
asked him in the Portuguese tongue, What he
was? he answered me in Latin, "Christianus:"
but so very weak and faint, that he could scarcely
stand or speak. And I next asked him, what
countryman he was? He said "Espaniola," and
then uttered all the thankfulness imaginable for
his deliverance. Signior, (said I with as much
Spanish as I was master of,) let us talk afterwards
hut fight now; here, take this sword and pistol,
and do what you can. And indeed he did so with
such courage and intrepidity, that he cut two of
them to pieces in an instant. I ordered Friday
to run for the guns we had left at the tree, which
he brought to me with great swiftness, and then I
gave hire my musket, while I loaded the rest.
But now there happened a fierce encounter be-
tween the Spaniard and one of the savages, who
made at him with one of their wooden swords;
and though the former was as brave as could be
expected, having twice wounded his enemy in
the he* 1; yet beinj weak and faint, the Indian

-«^ - r
had thrown him upon the ground, and was
wresting my sword out of his hand, which the
Spaniard very wisely quitting, drew out his pistol,
and shot him through the body before 1 could
come near him, though I was running to his
assistance. As to Friday, he pursued the flying
wretches with his hatchet, dispatching three, but
the rest were too nimble for him. The Spaniard
taking one of the fowling pieces, wounded two,
who running into the wood, Friday pursued and
killed; but the other,notwithstanding his wounds,
plunged himself into the sea, and .-warn to those
who were left in the canoe, which with one
wounded, were all that escaped out of one and
twenty.
The savages in the canoe worked very hard
to get out of our reach, and Friday was as eager
in pursuing them: and, indeed, I was no less
anxious about their escape, lest after the news
had been carried to their people, they should
return in multitudes, and destroy us. So being
resolved to pursue them, I jumped into one of
their canoes, and bid Friday follow me; but no
sooner was I in, than, to my surprise, I found
another poor creature, bound hand and foot for
the slaughter, just as the Spaniard had been,
with very little life in him. Immediately I un-
bound him, and would have helped him up; but
he could neither stand nor speak but groaned so
piteously, as thinking he was unbound in order
to be slain. Hereupon I bid Friday speak to
him, and tell him of his deliverance; when pull-
ing out my bottle, I made the poor wretch drink
a littl«, which, with tha joyful n»ws h» had rs~
ceived, so revived his heart; that he sat up in .the
boat. As soon as Friday began to hear hirh
speak, and look more fully in his face, it wolilfl
have moved any one to tears to perceive his
uncommon transports of joy; for he kissed;
embraced him, hugged him, cried, laughed, hal-
looed, jumped about, danced, sung, (hen cried
again, wrung his hands, beat his face and head,
then sung and jumped about again, like a dis-
tracted creature: so that it was a great while
befoic 1 could make him speak to me, or tell me
what was the matter with him; but when he
came to the liberty of his speech, at last he told
me it was his father.
Here, indeed, I was infinitely moved to see
that dutiful and tender affection this poor savage
had to his aged parent. He would sit down by
him in the boat; open his breast, and hold his
father's head close to his bosomi half nh hottr
together, to cherish him: then he took.his arms
and ankles, which were stiff and numbed, with
binding, mid chafed and rubbed them with his
hands; by which means, perceiving what the
case was, I gave him some rum, which proved of
s;rent benefit to him.
While we were busy in this action, the snyawes
<)ad gotten almost out of sight; and happy h
was we did not pursue them: for there arose
from the north-west, such a violent storm, which
continued all night long, that I could not suppose
otherwise but that they were all drowned. After
this, I called Friday to me, and asked him, if he
had given his father any bread J He shook bis
bead, und said, "• iSone, not one bit, nie eat a

koBiRson entries. 141
up all;" so I gave him a cake of bread out of a
little pouch I carried for this end. I likewise
gave him two or three bunches of raisins for his
father.
Away he then runs out of the boat as if ho
was bewitched, with such an extraordinary swift-
ness, that he was out of sight as it were in an
instant; but, at his return, I perceived him slack-
en his pace, because he had something in his
hand. And this 1 found to be, as he approached
nearer, an earthen jug with some water for his
father, with two more cakes of bread, which ho
delivered into my hands. Being very thirsty
myself, I drank some of the water, of which
when his father hud drank sufficiently, it more
revived his spirits than all the rum I had given
him.
I then called Friday to me, and ordered him
'o carry one of the cakes, and some water to the
Spaniard, who was reposing himself upon a
green place under the shade of a tree, but so
weak, that though he exerted himself, he could
not stand upon his feet. Upon which, I ordered
Friday to rub and bathe his ankles with rum, as
ne did his father's. But every minute he was
employed in this, he would cast his eyes towards
the boat, where he left his father sitting; who
suddenly disappearing, he flew like lightning to
him. and finding he only laid himself down to
ease his limbs, he returned back to me presently,
and then I spoke to the Spaniard to let Friday
help him, and lead him to the boat in order to be
conveyed to my dwelling, where I would take
care «f him. Upon which, Fir'ay towk hia

upon his back, and so carried him to the canoe,
setting him close by his father; and presently
stepping out again, launched the boat off, and
paddled it along the shore faster than I could
.walk, though the wind blew very hard too; and
having brought them safe to the creek, away he
runs to fetch the other canoe, which he brought
to the creek almost as soon as I got to it by land;
then wafting me over, he took our new guests
out of the boat; but so weak were they, that I
was forced to make a kind of a hand-barrow;
and when I came to my castle; not being willing
to make an entrance into my wall, we made t'nem
a handsome tent, covered with old sails, and
boughs of trees', making two gdod beds of rice
straw, with blankets to lie upon arid cover tiiem.
Thus, like an absolute king, over subjects who
owed their lives to me, I thought myself very
considerable.
To get provisions for my poo* .'cak suLjects,
I ordered Friday to kill me a yearling goat;
which when he had done, I cut off the hinder
quarters, and chopping it irito small pieces', boiled
and stewed it, putting barley and rice into the
broth. This I carried into their tent, set a table',
dined with them, and encouraged them. Friday
.was my interpreter to his father, and indeed to
,the Spaniard too, who spoke the language of
the savages pretty well. After dinner,I ordeied
Friday to fetch home all our arms from the field
of battle, and the next day to bury the dead
bodies, which he did accordingly. And now I
made Friday enquire of his father, whether he
thought those savu.Tes bud escaped the late storm
V
rohIhsoh CRUSOE. 143
«BC n - I,' —=-—:
in their canoe, and if so, whether they would not
return with a force too great for us to resist?
He answered, that he thought it impossible they
could outlive the storm: or if they were driven
southwardly, they would come to a laud where
they would as certainly be devoured, as if thev
were drowned in the sea. And suppose they had
attained their own country, the strangeness of
their fatal and bloody attack would make.them
tell then; people that the rest of them were killed
by thunder and lightning, not hj the hand of
hian, but by two heavenly spirits (meaning Fri-
day and me,) who were sent from above to destroy
them'. And this, he said, he knew, I e'cause he
heard them say the same to one another. And
ihd'eed he was in the right on't; fori have heard
lince, that these four men gave out, that whoever
ent to that enchantea .,iund, would be destroyed
. "ire from the gods.
So canoes appearing some time after, as I
vuected, my apprehensions ceased; instead of
/liich my lorimer thoughts of a voyage took
place, especially when Friday's lather assured
me I should have good usage in his nation. As
to the Spaniard', he told me that sixteen more-of
his countrymen^ and Portuguese, who had been
shipwrecked, made their escape, thither; 'hat
though they were in Union with the savages, yet
they were very miserable for want of provisions
and other necessaries. When I asked him about
the particulars of his voyage, he answered, that
their ship was bound from Rio de la Plata to the
Havana ;. that \yhen the ship was lost only five
men perished in 'he ocean; the rest having saved
themselves in the boat, were now landed on the
main continent. And what do they intend to do
there t said I. He replied, they had concertea
measures to escape by building a vessel, but
that they had neither tools nor provisions) so
that all their designs came to nothing. Sup-
posing (said I,) I should make a proposal, and
invite them here, would they not carry me priso-
ner to New Spain? He answered no; for he
knew them to be such honest men, as would
scorn to act with such inhuman baseness to
their deliverer: than if I pleased, he and the old
savage would go over to them, talk with them
about it, and bring me an answer: that they
should all swear fidelity to me as their leader,
upon the holy sacrament; and, for his part, he
would not only do the same, but stand by me to
the last drop of his blood, should there be oc-
casion.
These solemn assurances made me resolve to
grant them relief, and to send these two over
for that purpose; but when every thing was ready,
the Spaniard raised an objection, which carried
a great deal of weight in it: "You know, Sir,
said he, that having been some time with you, I
cannot but be sensible that your stock of rice
and corn may be sufficient, perhaps, for us at
present, but not for them, should they come over
presently, much less to victual a vessel for an
intended voyage. And therefore, my advice is,
to wait another harvest, and in the mean time,
cultivate and improve some more land, whereby
we may have plenty of provisions, in order t*
"execute our design."
This advice of the Spaniard I approved ex-
tremely; and so satisfied was I of his fidelity,
tlvt I esteemed him ever after. And thus we
all four went to work upon some more land, and
against seed-time, we had gotten so much cured
and trimmed up, as was sufficient to sow 22
bushels of barley on, and 16 jars of rice, which
was in short all the seed we had to spare. As
we were four in number; and by this time all in
good health, we feared not an hundred of Indians,
should they venture to attack us; and while the
com was \growing, I pitched upon some trees,
fit to build us a large vessel, in case the Span-
iards canle over; which being marked, I ordered
Friday and his father to cut them down, appoint-
ing the Spaniard, who was now my privy coun-
sellor, to oversee and direct the work. 1 like-
wise increased my flocks of goats, by shooting
the wild dams, and bringing home their kids to
my enclosure; nor did I neglect the grape
season, but cured them as usual, though I had
such a quantity now, as would have filled 80
barrels with raisins.
And thus all of us being employed, they in
working, and I in providing for them, till harvest
came, God Almighty bjessed the increase of it
so much, that from twenty-two bushels of barley,
we threshed out two hundred and twenty, and the
like quantity of rice, sufficient to victual a ship
fit to carry me and all the Spaniards to any part
of America.
Thus the prinsipnl objection being answered,
by a sufficient stoclt of provisions, I sent my
two amLassadors over to the main land, with a
13
,11 , - i i 1
regal authority to administer the oaths of allegi-
ance and fidelity, and have an instrument signed
under their hands, though I never asked whether
they had pen, ink, or paper; when giving each
of them a musket with eight charges of powder
and ball, and provisions enough for eight days,
they sailed away with a fair gale, on a day when
the moon was at full.
Scarcely a fortnight had passed over my head;
but impatient for their return, I laid me down to
sleep one morning, when a strange accident
happened, which was ushered in by my man's
coming running to me, and calling aloud, " Mas-
ter, master, they are come, they are come."
Upon which, not dreaming of any danger, out I
jumped from my bed, put on my clothes, and
hurried through my little grove; when looking
towards the sea, 1 perceived a boat, about a league
and a half distant, standing in for the shore, with
a fair wind. I beheld they did not come from
the side where the landHay on, but from the south-
most end of the island. So these being none ol
the people we wanted, I ordered Friday to lie still,
till such time as I came down from the mountain,
which, with my ladder, I now ascended, in ordVr
ti discover more fully what they were; and now.
with the help of my perspective glass, I plainly
perceived an English ship, which I concluded it
to be, by the fashion of its long boat; and which
filled me with such uncommon transports of joy,
that I cannot tell how to describe; and yet some
secret doubts hung ab<3ut me, proceeding from I
know not what cause, as though I had reason to
ba on my guiyd.
Not long it was, before I perceived the boat to
approach the shore, as though they looked for
a place where they might conveniently land;
and at last they ran their Coat on the shore upon
the beach, about half a mile distance; which
proved so much the happier for me", since, had
they come into the creek, they had landed, just at
my door, and might not only have forced me out
of my castle, but plundered me of all I had in
the world. Now I was fully convinced they
were all Englishmen, three of whom were un-
armed and bound; when immediately, the first
four or five leaped on shore, and took those three
out of the boat as prisoners, one of whom I could
perceive used the most passionate gestures of
«8itreaty, affliction and despair, while the others
in a less degree showed abundance of concern.
Not knowing the meaning of this, I beckoned
to Friday, who was below, to ascend the moun-
tain, and likewise view this sight. "0 master,"
said he to me, "you see English mans eat priso
ners as well as savage mans." And do you
think they will eat them, Friday? said I. "Yes,"
said Friday, "they eat a all up." No, no, said I,
Friday, I am much more concerned lest they
murder them; but ns for eating them up, that I
am sure they will never do.
And now I not only lamented my misfortune
in not having the Spaniard and Savage with me,
but also that I could not come within shot of them
unperceived, (they having no fire-arms among
them,) and save these three men, whom I thought
they were going to kill with their swords. But
- -—' 'mT*r
some comfort it was to me, that I perceived they
were set at liberty to go .where they pleased, the
rascally seamen scattering about as though they
had a mind to see the place; and so long did they
negligently ramble, that the tide had ebb^ed so low,
as to leave the boat aground. Nor were the two
men that were in her more circumspect: for
having drunk a little too much liquor, they fell
fast asleep; but one of them waking before the
other, and perceiving the boat too fast aground
for his strength to move it, he hallooed out to the
rest, who made all possible expedition to come
to him; but as Providence ordered it, all their
force was ineffectual to launch her, when I could
hear them speak to one another. "Why let her
alone, Jack, can't ye, she'll float next tide;" by
which words I was fully convinced they were
my own countrymen. I this while lay very quiet,
as being fully sensible it could be no less than
ten hours before the boat would be afloat, and
then it would be so dark, that they could not
easi'yperceive me, by which means I should be
at more liberty to hear their talk, and observe alj
their motions; not but .that I prepared for my
defence: yet as I had another sort of enemy to
combat with, I acted with more caution. I took
two fusees on my shoulder, and gave Friday
three muskets; besides my formidable goat-skin,
and monstrous cap, made me look as fierce and
terrible as Hercules of old, especially wfoen two
pistols were stuck in my belt, and my naked
sword was hanging by my side.
The three poor distressed creatures, $00 anx-
ious to get any repose, were, however, seated
under the shade of a great tree, about a quarter
of a mile from ine.
Upon which, without any more ado, I ap-
proached towards them, with my man following
behind me, and, before I was perceived, I called
aloud to them in Spanish, what are y$ gentle-
men?
At these words they started up in great con-
fusion, when they beheld the strange figure I
made; they returned no answer but seemed as
if they would fly from me: Gentlemen, (said I
in English,) don't be afraid, perhaps you have a
friend nearer than you expect. "He must be
from heaven," said one of them, gravely pulling
off his hat, "for we are past all help in this
world." All help is from heaven, said 1, but
Sir as I have perceived every action between you
and these brutes since your landing, only inform
me how to assist you, and I will do it to the
utmost of my power.
Am I talking with God or man? said he, in
melting tears. Are you of human kind, or an
angel'! "Sir," said I, "my poor habit will tell you
1 am a man, and an Englishman, willing to assist
you, having but this servant only, here are arms
and ammunition; tell freely your condition, can
we save you'!" The story, said he, is too long to
relate, since our butchers are so near: but, Sir,
I was master of that ship, my men have mutined,
and it is as a favour they have put my mate, this
passenger, and me, on shore without murdering
us, though wo expect nothing but perishing her-j.
44 Are your enemies gone V said I. No, replied
13*
he (pointing to a thicket,) there they lie, while
my heart tre'hibles, lest, having seen and heard
us, they should murder us all. "Have they fire-
arms?" said I. They have hut two pieces, said
be, one of which is left in the boat. He also
told me, there were two enormous villains
amongst them, that were the authors of this
mutiny, who if they were killed or seized, the
rest might be induced to return to their obedience.
When he had given me all the satisfaction I
could desire, I gave him and his two companions
each of them a gun, with powder and ball suflir
cient, and firing myself, killed one of the Cap-
tain's enemies, and wounded the other who
eagerly called for assistance; but the Captain
(who had reserved his piece,) coming up to him,
"Sirrah," said he, "tis too late to call for assist
ance, you should rather cry to God to pardon
your villainy:" and so knocked him down with
the stock of his gun: three others were also
slightly wounded, who, at my appoach, cried out
for mercy. This the Captain granted,
condition that they would swear to be. true him
in recovering the ship, which they solemnly did:
however, I obliged the Captain to keep then}
bound. After which I sent Friday and the Cap-
tain's mate to secure the boat, and bring away the
oars and sail; when the men, seeing their late
distressed Captain, now their conqueror, sub-
mitted to be bound also. And then it was, that
having more liberty, I related the adventures ol
my whole life, which he heard with a serious at-
tention. After this, I carried him and his two
companions mto my little fortified castle, show-
i
ed them all my conveniences, and, when this was
over, we began to consider about regaining the
ship: he said that there were twenty-six hands
on board, who knowing their lives were forfeited
by the law, for conspiracy and mutiny, were so
very hardened, that it would be dangerous for
our small company to attack them. This was a
reasonable inference, indeed; but something we
must resolve on, and immediately put in execu-
tion: we therefore heaved the boat upon the
beach so high that she could not shoot off at high
water mark, and broke a hole in her not easy to be
stopped; so that all the signals they gave for the
boat to come on board were in vain. This oblig-
ed them to send another boat ashore, with ten
men armed, whose faces the Captain plainly des-
cried, the boatswain being the chief officer; but
he said there were three honest lads among them,
who were forced into the conspiracy. Here-
upon, I gave him fresh courage, (for I had perceiv-
ed he was in concern,) in the mean while securing
our prisoners, except two, whom we took to our
assistance, we thought ourselves able enough to
endure a battle. When the sailors landed, and
beheld their boat in that condition, they not only
hallooed, but fired, for their companions to hear,
yet they received no answer. This struck them
with horror and amazement, thinking their com-
panions were murdered, they made as if they
would return to the ship. I could perceive the
Captain's countenance change at this, till, of a
sudden, three men were ordered to look after the
boat, while the other seven leapt on shore, in
order to search for their companions; and, in-
deed, they came to the brow of the hill, near my
ancient castle, from whence they could see to a
great distance in the woods, and there shouting
and hallooing till tired and weary, they at length
sealed themselves under a spreadmg tree. My
opinion was, that nolhing could be done till night,
when I might use some artifice to get them all
/ut of the boat; but of a sudden they started up,
and made towards the sea-side; hereupon I or-
dered Friday and the Captain's mate to go over
fhe creek, and halloo as loud as they could, nnd
to decoying them into the woods, come round to
•ne again. And this, indeed, had good effect;
for they followed the noise, till coming westward
to the creek, they called for their boat to carry
thetn over, and taking one of the men out of her,
left two to look after her, having fastened her to
the stump of a little tree on the shore. Hereupon
immediately the Captain and our party passing
the creek, out of their sight, we surprised them
both, by the Captain's knocking down one and
ordering the other to surrender upon pain of
death, and who being the honestest of them all,
sincerely joined with us. By this time it was
pretty late; when the rest returning to their boat,
which they found aground in the creek, the tide
out, and the men gone, they ran about wringing
their hands, crying it was an enchanted island,
and that they should be all murdered by spirits or
devils. My men would willingly have fallen
upon them, but I would not agree to hazard any
of our party. But to be more certain, Fridny
and the Captain crawled upon their hands nnd
feet, as near as possible; and when the boatswain
approached in sight, so eager was the Captain,
that he fired, and killed him on the spot: Friday
wounded the next man, and a third ran away.
Hereupon I advanced with my whole army; and
it being dark, I ordered the man we had surprised
in the boat, to call them by their names, and to
parley with them. Accordingly he called out
aloud, "Tom Smith, Tom Smith!" He an-
swered, "Who's that;" "Robinson!" answer-
ed the other, " For God's sake, Tom, surrender
immediately, or you're all dead men." "Who
must we surrender to?" says Smith. "To our
Captain and a large force here, who have taken
me prisoner, wounded Will Fyre, and killed the
boatswain." "Shall we have quarter then?"
said he. Hereupon the Captain calls out, "Yoi:
Smith, you know my voice, surrender imme-
diately, and you shall have your lives granted
except Will Atkins." Hereupon Atkins cries
out, "What have I done, Captain, more than
the rest, who have been as bad as me;" but that
was a lie, for he was the person that laid hold of
him, and bound him. However, he was ordered
to submit to the governor's mercy, for such was
I called. And so laying down their arms, we
bound them all, and seized on their boat.
After this, the Captain expostulated with them,
telling them that the governor was an Englishman,
who might execute them there; but he thought
they would be sent to England. Her on they
implored the Captain to intercede f< lives,
and begged they might not be sent t ngland.
This answered our project for seizing the ship,
for, after sending them, fast bound, to the cave.
I sent the Captain to treat with them in the
governor's name, offering them pardon if they
would assist in recovering the ship. Upon
which, t.iey all promised to stand by him till the
last drop of their blood; and whoever acted
treacherously should be hanged in chains upon
the beach. They were all released on these
assurances: and then the Captain repaired to the
other boat, making hU passenger Captain of her,
and gave him four men well armed; while, him-
self, his mate, and five more, went in the other
boat. By midnight they came within call of the
ship, when the Captain ordered Robinson to hail
her, and tell them that with great difficulty they
had found the men at last. But while they were
discoursing, the Captain, his mate, and the rest
entered, and knocked down the second mate,
and carpenter, secured those that were upon the
deck, by putting them under hatches, while the
other boat's crew entered and secured the fore-
castle; they then broke into the round-house,
where the mate, after some resistance, shot the
pirate Captain through the head, upon which all
the rest yielded themselves prisoners. And thus
the ship being recovered, the joyful signal was
fired, which I heard with the greatest joy imagin-
able: nor was it long before he brought the ship
to an anchor at the creek's mouth, w here coming
to me urm'vares, "There," says he, :' my dear-
est friend and deliverer, there is your ship, and
we are your servants:" a comfort so unspeak-
able, as made me swoon in his arms, while, with
^gratitude to heaven, we were tenderly embracing
each other.
Nothing now remained, but to consult what
we should do with the prisoners, whom he
thought it was not safe to lake on hoard. Here-
upon, concerting with the Captain, I dressed
myself in one of his suits, and sending for them',
told them, that as I was going to leave the island
with all my people, if they would tarry there,
their lives should be spared; if not, they should
be hanged at the first port they came to. They
agreed to slay. Hereupon I told them my wtiole
story, charging them to be kind to the Spaniards
that were expected, gave them all my arms, and
informing them of every thing necessary for their
subsistence, I, and my man Friday, went on
board. But the next morning two of the men
came swimming to the ship's side, desiring the
Captain to take them on board, though he hanged
them afterwards, complaining mightily how barba-
rously the others used them. Upon which I
prevailed with the Captain to take them in; and
having received some punishment, they proved
more honest for the future. And so I bid fare-
Well to this island, carrying along with me my
money, my parrot, unbrella, and goat-skin cap;
setting sail December 12', 1687, after twenty-
eight years, two months, and nineteen days resi-
dence, and landing in England, June 11, 1688',
after five and thirty years absence from my own
country, which rendered me altogether a stranger
there.

LIFI AND ADVENTURES
ROBINSON CRUSOE,
EMBELLISHED WITH ENGRAVINGS,
BY IfM. ROBERTSON.
ITHACA, N. Y-:
MACl£ ANDRUS & WOODRUFF.
LIFE AND ADVENTURED
ROBINSON CRUSOE.
OOfoo
I Was born in York, in the year 1632, of a
reputable family. My father was a native of
Bremen; who by merchandizing at Hull for
some time, gained a very plentiful fortune. He
married my mother at York, who received her
first breath in that country: and as her maiden
name was Robinson, I was called Robinson
Kreutznaer, which not being easily pronounced
in the English tongue, we are commonly known
by the name of Crusoe.
I was the youngest of three brothers. The
eldest was a lieutenant-colonel in Lockhart's
regiment, but slain by the Spaniards; what be-
came of the other I could never learn.
No charge nor pains were wanting in my edu-
;ation. My father designed me for the law, yei
aothing could serve me but I must go tt «««
both against the will of mv father, the tears of
my mother, and the entreaties of friends. One
morning, my father expostulated very warmly
with me. What reason, says he, have you to
leave your tiative country, where there must be
a more certain prospect of content and happiness,
\o enter into a wandering condition of uneasiness
and uncertainty 1 He recommended to me
Agar's wish, neither to desire poverty nor rich-
es; that a middle state of life was the most hap-
py; arid that the high towering thoughts of
raising our condition by wandering abroad, were
surrounded with misery and danger, and ofte'rt
ended with confusion and disappointment. I en-
treat you, nay, I command you (says he,) to
desist from these intentions. If you will go,
(added he,) my prayers shall, however, be offer-
ed for your preservation; but a time may cdme;
when desolate, oppressed, or forsaken, you may
Mish you had taken your poor despised father's
counsel.—He pronounced these words with such
a moving and paternal eloquence, while floods of
tsars ran down his aged cheeks, that it seemed
to stem the torrent of my resolution. But this
soon wore off; and a little after, I informed rny
mother that I couid not settle at any business;
my resolutions were so strong to see the world,
and begged she would gain my father's consent
only to go one voyage; which if it did not prove
prosperous, I would never attempt a second.
But my desire was as vain as my folly in asking.
My mother passionately expressed her dislike to
this proposal, telling me that as she saw I was
fcent on my own destruction, contrary to their
will and my duty, she would say no more, but
leave me to myself to do whatever I pleased.
1 was then; I think, nineteen years old, when
one time being at Hull, I met a school-fellow of
mine going along wilh his father, who was mas-
ter of a ship, to London; and acquainting him
with my wandering desires, he assured me of a
free passage; and a plentiful share of what was
necessary. Thus, without imploring a blessing,
or taking farewell of my parents, I took shipping
on the 1st of September, 1651.
Upon the 6th day, we came to an anchor in
Harwich roadt where we lay wind-bound with
some Newcastle ships; and there being a good
anchorage, and our cables sound, the seamen for-
got their late toil and danger, and spent the time
as merrily as if they had been on shore. But on
the eighth day, there arose a brisk gale of wind,
which prevented our tiding it up the river; and
it still increasing, our ship rode forecastle in, and
shipped several large seas.
It was not long before horror seized the sea-
men themselves, and I heard the master express
this rselancholy ejaculation; Lord have mercy
upon us, we shall all be lost and undone! For
my part, sick unto death, I kept my cabin, till
the universal and terribly dreadful apprehensions
of our speedy fate made me get upon deck, and
there I was affrighted indeed. The sea went
mountains high: I could see nothing but distress
around us: two ships had cut away their masts,
and another had foundered; two more that had lost
tl.eir anchors, were forced out to the mercy of
the ocean; and, to save our lives, we wer6
1*
forced to cut our foremast and mainmast quite
away.
Who is there so ignorant as not. to judge of
my dreadful condition? I was but a fresh water
sailor, and therefore seemed more terrified.
Our ship was very good, but overloaded; which
made the sailors often cry out, She will founder:
word? I then was ignorant of. All this while,
the storm continuing, and rather increasing, the
master and the more sober part of the men went
to prayers, expecting death every moment. In
ihe middle of the night one cried out, We had
sprung a leak: another, That there was four feet
water in the hold. I was just ready to expire
with fear, when immediately all hands were call-
ed to the pump; and the men forced me also in
that extremity to share with them in their labour.
While thus employed, the master espying some
colliers, fired a gun as a signal of distress; and
I not understanding what it meant, and thinking
that either the ship broke, or some dreadful thing
happened, fell into a swoon. Even in that con-
dition of woe, nobody minded me, excepting to
thrust me aside with their feet, thinking me dead;
and it was a great while before I recovered.
Happy it was for us, when upon the signal
given, they ventured out their boat to save our
lives, All our pumping had been in vain, and
vain had all our attempts been, had they not come
to our ships side, and our men cast them a rope
over the stern with a bouy to it, which after great
difficulty they got hold of, and we hauling them
to us, got into their boat, and left our ship which
we perceived sink within less than a quarter of
- I' i - '=a
art hour; and thus I learnt what was meant by
foundering at sea. And now the men incessant-
ly laboured to recover their own ship; but the
sea ran so high, and the wind blew so hard, that
they thought it convenient to haul in shore, which
with great difficulty and danger at last we happily
effected, landing at a place called Cromer, not
far from Winterton light-house; from whence
we all walked to Yarmouth, where, as objects of
pity, many good people furnished us with the
necessaries to carry us either to Hull, or London.
Strange! that after all this, I did not, like the
prodigal son, return to my'father; who hearing
of the skip's calamity, for a long time thought me
entombed in the deep. No doubt but I should
have shared in his fatted calf, as the Scripture
expresseth it; but my wayward disposition still
pushed trie on, in spite of the powerful convic-
tions of reason and conscience. When we had
been at Yarmouth three days I met my old com-
panion, who had given me the invitation to go on
board along with his father. His behaviour and
speech was altered, and; in a melancholy manner
he asked me how I did 1 telling his father who I
was, and how I had made this voyage for a trial
only to proceed farther abroad. Upon which the
old gentleman turning to me, said, Young man^
you ought never to go to sea any more, but to
take this for a certain sign, that you will never
prosper in a sea-faring condition. Sir, answered
I; will you take the same resolution? It is a
different case, said he, it is my calling, and con-
sequently my duty; but ns vou have made this
voyage for a trial, you see what ill luck heaven
fias set before your eyes; and perhaps our mi-
series have been on your account, like Jonah in
the ship of Tarshish. But pray what are you,
and on what account did you go to sea 1 Upon
which, I very freely declared my whole story; at
the end of which he made this exclamation, Ye
sacred powers! what had I committed, that such
a wretch should enter into my ship, to heap upon
me such a deluge of miseries 1 But soon recol-
lecting himself, Young man, said he, if you do
not go back, depend upon it, wherever you go,
you will meet with disasters, and disappointments,
till your father's words are fulfilled upon you.
And so we parted.
I thought at first to return home; but shame
opposed that good notion, as thinking I should
be laughed at by my neighbours and acquaint-
ances. So strange is the nature of youth!
They are not ashamed to sin, but yet ashamed to
repent; and so far from being sorry for those
actions for which they may be accounted fools,
they think it folly to return to their duty, which is
the principle mark of wisdom. In short, I tra-
velled up to London, resolving upon a voyage,
and a voyage I soon heard of, by my acquaint-
ance with a captain who took a fancy to me, to
go to the coast of Guinea. Having some mo-
ney and appearing like a gentleman, I went on
board, not as a common sailor or foremast-man;
nay, the commander agreed 1 should go that
voyage with him without any expense: that I
should be his messmate and companion, and that
I was welcome to carry any thing with me, and
make the best merchandise I could.
I blessed my happy fortune, and humbly
thanked my captain for his offer, and acquainting
my friends in Yorkshire, forty pounds were sent
me, the greatest part of which my dear father
and mother contributed, with which I bought toys
and trifles as the captain directed me. My cap-
tain also taught me navigation, how to keep an
account of the ship's course, take an observation,
and led me into the knowledge of several useful
branches of the mathematics. And indeed this
voyage made me both a sailor and a merchant;
for I brought home five pound nine ounces of
gold dust, for my adventure, which produced, at
my return to London, almost three hundred
pounds; but in this voyage I was extremely
sick, being thrown into a violent fever, through
excessive heat, trading upon the coast from the
latitude of fifteen degrees north, even to the line
itself.
But, alas! my dear friend the captain soon
departed this life after his arrival. This was a
sensible grief to me; yet I resolved to go ano-
ther voyage with his mate, who had now got
command of the ship. This proved a very un-
successful one; for though I did not carry a
hundred pounds of my late acquired wealth, (so
that I had two hundred pounds left, which I re-
posed with the captain's widow, who was an ho-
nest gentlewoman,) yet my misfortunes in this
unhappy voyage were very great. For our ship
sailing towards the Canary Islands, we were
chased by a Salee roveT; and in spite of all the
haste we could make, by crowding as much can-
vass as our yards could spread, or our masts
carry, the pirate gained upon us, so ihat we pre-
pared ourselves to fight. They had eighteen
guns, and we had but twelve. About three in
the afternoon there was a desperate engagement,
wherein many were killed and wounded on both
sides: but finding ourselves over-powered with
numbers, our ship disabled, and ourselves too
impotent to have the least hopes of success, we
were forced to surrender; and accordingly we
were all carried prisoners into the port of Salee.
Our men were sent to the Emperor's court to
be sold'there; but the pirate captain taking no-
tice of me, kept me to be his own slave.
In this condition, I thought myself the most
miserable creature on earth, and the prophesy of
my father came afresh into my thoughts. How-
ever, my condition, was better than I thought it
to be, as will soon appear. Some hopes, indeed,
I had that my new patron would go to sea again,
where he might be taken by a Spanish or Portu-
guese man of war, and then I should be set at
liberty. But in this I was mistaken; for he nev-
er took me with him, but left me to look after his
little garden, and do the drudgery of his house,
and when he returned from sea, would make me
lie in the cabin and look after the ship. I had no
one that I could communicate my thoughts to,
which were continually meditating my escape.
No Englishman, Irishman, or Scotchman here
but myself: and for two years I could see no-
thing practicable, but only pleased myself with
the imagination.
After some length of time, my patron as I
found, grew so poor, that he could not fit out hi*
ship as usual; and then he used constantly, once
or twice a week, if the weather was fair, to go
out a fishing, taking me and a young Moorish
boy to row the boat; and so much pleased was
ho with me for my dexterity in catching the fish,
that he would often send me with a Moor, who
was one of his kinsmen, and the youth before-
mentioned, to catch a dish of fish for him.
One morning, as we were at sport, there arose
such a thick fog, that we lost sight of the shore;
and rowing, we knew not which way, we labour-
ed all the night, and in the morning we found
ourselves in the ocean, two leagues from land.
However, we attained there at length, and made
the greatest haste, because our stomachs were
exceedingly sharp and hungry. In order to pre-
vent such disasters for the future, my pation or-
dered a carpenter to build a little state-room or
cabin in the middle of the long-boat: with a
place behind it to steer and haul home the main-
sheet, with other conveniences to keep him from
the weather, as also lockers to put in all manner
of provisions; with a handsome shoulder-ofi-
mutton sail gibing over the cabin.
In this, he frequently took us out a fishing;
and one time, inviting two or three persons of
distinction to go with him, laid in provisions ex-
traordinary; providing also three fusees, with
powder and shot, that they might have some
sport fowling along the sea-coast. The next
morning, the boat was made clean, her ancients
and pendants out, and every thing ready: but
their minds altering, my patron ordered us to go
a fishing, for that his guests would certainly sup
with him that night.
And now I began to think of my deliverance
indeed. In order to this, I persuaded the Moor
to get some provisions on board, and to procure
some powder and shot, pretending to kill sea-
curlews, which he innocently and readily agreed
to. In short, being provided with all things ne-
cessary, we sailed out.
When we had passed the castle, we fell to
fishing; but though I knew there was a bite, I
concealed the matter, in order to put farther out
to sea. Accordingly we ran a league farther,
when, giving the boy the helm, and pretending to
stoop for something, I seized Muley by surprise
and threw him overboard. As he was an excel-
lent swimmer, he soon arose and made towards
the boat; upon which I took out a fusee, and
presented it at him: " Muley," said I, " I never
yet designed to do you any harm, and seek no-
thing now but my freedom. I know you are
able enough to swim to shore, and save your life;
but if you are resolved to follow me to the en-
dangering of mine, the very moment you pro-
ceed, I will shoot you through the head." The
harmless creature, at these words, turned himself
from me and I make no doubt, got safe to land.
Then turning to the boy Xury, I perceived he
trembled at the action; but I put him out of all
fear telling him, that if ho would be true and
and faithful to me, I would do well by him and
not hurt him.
We then pursued our voyage: I kept to the
southward, to the truly Barbarian coast; but in
the dark of the evening, I changed my course,
that I might keep near the shore; and having a
fresh gale of wind, with a very pleasant smooth
sea, by three o'clock next day, I was one hundred
and fifty miles beyond the Emperor of Moroc-
co's dominions. I continued sailing for five days
successively, till such time as the wind shifting
to the southward, made me conclude, that if any
vessel was in chase of me, they would proceed
10 farther.
After so much fatigue and thought, I anchored
at the mouth of a little river, I knew not what or
where, neither did I then see any people. What
[ principally wanted was fresh water; and I was
resolved about the dusk of the evening to swim
ashore: but no sooner the gloomy clouds of
night began to succeed the declining day, than we
heard such barking, roaring, and howling of wild
creatures, that one might have thought the very
strongest monsters of nature had their residence
there. Poor Xury, who was almost dead with
fear, entreated me hot to go on shore that night.
"Suppose I don't Xury," said I, "and in the
morning we should see men who are worse than
those we fear, what then V "0 den we may
give, them the shoot gun," said he, laughing,
"and the gun make them all run away." The
wit, and broken English which the boy had learn-
ed among the captives of our nation pleased me
entirely, and made me still fonder of him than
before. We could get but little sleep all night
for the terrible howlings they made; and indeed
we were very much affrighted.
a
The next morning, I was resolved to go on
shore to get in fresh water, and venture myself
among the beasts or savages, should either at-
tack me. Xury said he would take one of the
jars and bring me some. I asked him why he
would go and not I? The poor boy answered,
"If wild mans come, they eat me, you go away."
This, indeed, increased my affection for the
child. "Well, dear Xury," said I, " we will
both go ashore, both kill wild mans, and they
shall eat neither of.us." So giving Xury a
piece of bread to eat, we waded ashore, carrying
nothing with us but our arms, and two jars for
water. I did not go out of sight of the boat, as
dreading the savages coming down the river
in their canoes: but the boy seeing a low de-
scent or vale about a mile in the country, he
wandered to it; and then running back to me
with great precipitation, I thought he was pur-
sued by some savages or wild beasts; upon
which I approached, resolving to perish, or pro-
tect him from danger. As he came nearer to me,
I saw something hanging wer his shoulder,
which was a creature he had shot, like a hare, but
different in colour, and with longer legs; how-
ever we were glad of it, for it proved wholesome
and nourishing meat; but what added to our joy
was, my boy assured me there was plenty of
water, and that he "saw no wild mans." And
greater still was our comfort when we found
fresh water in the creek where we were when the
tide was out, without going so far up into the
country.
In this place I began to hope that I should
meet some of the English trading vessels, who
would relieve anJ take us in.
The place I was in, was no doubt, that wild
country inhabited only by a few, that lies be-
tween the Emperor of Morocco's dominions and
the negroes. It is filled with wild beasts, and
the Moors use it for hunting chiefly. From this
place I thought I saw the top of the mountain
TenerhTe, in the Canaries, which made me try
twice to attain it, but as often was I driven back>
and so forced to pursue my fortune along shore.
Early one morning we came to an anchor
under a little point of land, but pretty high; and
the tide beginning to flow, we lay ready to go
further in; but Xury whose youthful and pene-
trating eyes were sharper than mine, in a soft
tone desired me to keep far from land, lest we
should be devoured ; " For look yonder master,
and see 'de dreadful monster fast asleep on de
side of de hill." Accordingly looking where he
pointed, I espied a fearful monster indeed. It
was a terrible great lion that lay on shore, cover-
ed as it were by a shade of a piece of the hill.
"Xury," said I, " you shall go on shore and kill
him." But the boy looked amazed. "Me kill
him!" says he, "he eat me at one mouth,"
meaning one mouthful. Upon which I bid him
lie still, and charging my biggest gun with two
slugs, and a good charge of powder, I took the
best aim I could to shoot him through the head;
»ut his leg lying over his nose, the slug broke his
Knee-bone. The lion awaking with the pain,
got up, but soon fell down, giving the most hide-
ous groan I ever heard; but taking my second
piece I shot him through the head, and then he
lay struggling for life. Upon this Xury took
heart, and desired my leave to go on shore.
'" Go then," said I. Upon which, taking a little
gun in one hand, he swam to shore with the
other, and coming close to the lion put a period
to his life, by shooting him again through the
head.
But this was spending our ammunition in vain',
the flesh not being good to eat. Xury was like
a champion, and comes on board for a hatchet to
cut off the head of his enemy; but wanting
strength to perform it, he cut off and brought me
a foot. I bethought me, however, that this skill
would be of use. This cost Xury and me a
whole day: when spreading it on the top of our
cabin, the hot beams of the sun effectually dried
it in two days time, and it afterwards served me
for a bed to lie on.
And now we sailed southerly, living sparingly
on our provisions, and went no oftener on shore
than we were obliged for fresh water, in hopes to
meet some European ship. If providence did
not favour me, my next course was to seek
for the islands, or lose my life among the ne-
groes; in a word, either I must rreet with some
ship, or certainly perish.
One day as we were sailing along, we saw
people stand on the shore looking at us; we
could also perceive they were black, and stark
naked. I was inclined to go on shore; but
Xury cried, No, no; however, I approached
nearer, and I found they ran along the shore
by me a long way. They had no weapons ki
\
their hands, except one, who held a long stick,
which Xury told me was a lance, with which they
could kill at a great distance. I talked to them
by signs, and made them sensible I wanted
something to eat; they beckoned to me to stop
my boat, while two of them ran up into the
country, and in less than half an hour came back
and brought with them two pieces of dry flesh,
and some corn, which we kindly accepted; and
to prevent any fears on either side, they brought
the food to the shore, laid it down, then went and
stood a great way off, till we fetched it on board
and then came close to us again.
But while we were returning thanks to them,
being all we could afford, two mighty creatures
came from the mountains, one as it were pursu-
ing the other with great fury, which we were the
rather inclmed to believe, as they seldom appear
but in the night, and both these swiftly passing
by the negroes, jumped into the sea, wantonly
swimming about, as though the diversion of the
waters had put a stop to their fierceness. At
last one of them coming nearer to my boat than
I expected, or desired, I shot him directly through
the head, upon which he sunk immediately, yet
rising again, he would have willingly made to the
shore, but between the wound and the struggling
of the water, he died before he could reach it.
It is impossible to express the consternation
the poor negroes were in at the firing of my gun;
much less can I mention their surprise, when
they perceived the creature to be slain by it. I
made signs to them to draw near it with a rope,
and then gave it to them to haul on shore. It
, 2*
- *
was a beautiful leopard, which made me desire
its skin; and the'negroes seeming to covet the
carcase, I freely gave it to them. As for the
other leopard, it made to shore, and ran with a
prodigious swiftness out of sight. The negroes
having kindly furnished me with water, and with
what roots and grains their country afforded, I
took my leave, and, after eleven days sail cams
in sight of the Cape de Verd. But the great
distance I was from it, and fearing contrary
winds would prevent me reaching them, I began
to grow melancholy and dejected, when upon a
sudden Xury cried out, " Master, Master," look-
ing as affrighted as if it was his master's ship
sent in search of us. But I soon discovered
she was a Portuguese ship. Upon which I strove
for life to come up to them. But in vain had
it been, if through their perspective glasses, they
had not perceived us, and shortened their sail to
let us come in. Encouraged at this, I set up my
patron's ancient, and fired a gun, both as signals
of distress; upon which they very kindly lay to,
so that in three hours time I came up with them.
They spoke to me in Portuguese, Spanish, and
French, but none of these did I understand, till
at length a Scots sailor called, and then I told him
I was an Englishman, who had escaped from the
Moors at Salee, upon which they took me kindly
on board, with all my effects.
Having a pleasant voyage to the Brazils, we
arrived in the Bay de Todos los Santos, or, All
Saints Bay, in twenty-two days after. And
here I cannot forget the generous treatment of
the captain. He would take nothing for my pas-
sage, gave me twenty ducats for the leopard's
skin, and thirty for the lion's. Every thing he
caused to be delivered, and what I would sell,
he bought. In short, I made 220 pieces of my
cargo, and with this stock I entered once more,
as I may say, into the scene of life.
To be brief, I bought a settlement next to an
honest and kind neighbour, born at Lisbon, of
English parents, whose plantation joining to
mine, we improved very amicably together. Both
our stocks were low: and for two years we
planted only for food; but the third year we
planted some tobacco, and each of us dressed
a large piece of ground the ensuing year for
planting sugar-canes.
I was in some measure settled> before the cap-
tain who took me up departed from the Brazils.
One day I went to him, and told him what stock
I had in London, desiring his assistance in get-
ting it sent out to me; to which the good gentle-
man readily'consented, but would only have me
send for half my money, lest it should miscarry,
which, if it did, I might still have the remainder
to support me; and so taking letters of procura-
tion from me, bid me trouble myself no further
about it.
And indeed, he not only procured the money
I had drawn for upon my captain's widow, but
sent me over a servant, with a cargo proportion-
able to my condition. He also sent me tools of
all sorts, iron work and utensils necessary for
my plantation.
Wealth now encreasing on me, and uncommon
success crowning my prosperous labours, I
might have rested happy in that middle state of
life my father so often recommended; yet no-
thing would content me. Having lived four
years in Brazil, I had not only learned the lan-
guage, but contracted acquaintance with the
most eminent planters, and even with the mer-
chants of St. Salvadore, three of whom came one
morning to me saying they had a secret proposal
to make. After enjoining me to secrecy * they
told me they had a mind to fit out a ship to go to
Guinea, in order to stock the plantation with ne-
groes, which as they could not be publicly sold,
they would divide among them; and if I would
go their supercargo in the ship, to manage the
trading part, I should have an equal share of the
negroes, without providing any stock. The thing
indeed was fair enough, had I been in another
condition: however, I could not resist the pro-
posal, but accepted the offer, upon condition of
their looking after my plantation.
The ship being fitted out, and all things ready,
we set sail the first of September 1659. We
sailed northward upon the coast, from whence
going farther into the ocean out of the sight of
land, we steered as though we were bound for
the island Fernand de Noremba, leaving the is-
lands on the east, and then it was we met with a
terrible tempest, which continued for twelve days
successively, so that the winds carried us where-
soever they pleased. In this perplexity one' of
our men died, and a man and a boy were washed
overboard. When the weather cleared up a lit-
tle, we found ourselves upon the coast of Guinea.
Upon this the captain gave reasons for returning;
which I opposed, counselling him to stand away
for Barbadoes, which as I supposed might be
attained in fifteen days. So altering our course,
we sailed north-west and by west in order to
reach the Leeward Islands; but a second storm
succeeding, drove us to the westward, so that wa
were justly afraid of falling into the hands of cru-
el savages, or the paws of the devouring beasts
of prey.
In this great distress, one of the men, early in
the morning, cried out, Land! land! which he
had no sooner said, than our ship struck upon a
sand bank, and, in a moment, the sea broke over
her in such a manner that we expected we should
perish immediately. We knew not where we
were, or upon what land we were driven, wher
ther it was an island, or the main, inhabited or
not inhabited, and we could not so much as hope
that the ship would hold out many minutes, withr
out breaking in pieces, unless the wind by a mir-
acle should turn about immediately. While we
stood looking at one another, expecting death
every moment, the mate lays hold of the boat, and
with the help of the rest got her flung over the
ship's side; into this we all got being eleven in
number, and committed ourselves to God's mer-
cy, and the wild sea. And now we saw that this
last effort would not be a sufficient protection
from death; so high did the sea rise, that it was
impossible the boat should live. As to making
a sail, we had none, neither if we had could we
make use of any. So that when we had rowed
or rather were driven about a league and a half,
a raging wave, like a lofty mountain came rolling
astern of us, and took us with such fury, that at
once it overset the boat. Thus being swallowed
up in a moment, we had only time to call upon
the awful name of God, and to implore, in dy*
ing ejaculations, his infinite mercy to receive our
departing souls.
Men are generally counted insensible, when
struggling in the pangs of death; but while I
was overwhelmed with water, I had the most
dreadful apprehensions imaginable, for the joys
of heaven, and the torments of hell, seemed to
present themselves before me in these dying
agonies, and even small space of time, as it were,
between life and death. I was going I thought
I knew not whither, in a dismal gulph unknown,
and as yet unperceived, never to behold my
friends, nor the light of this world any more! I
strove however to the last extremity, while all my
companions were overpowered and entombed in
the deep; and it was with great difficulty I kept
my breath till the wave spent itself, and, retiring
back, left me on the shore half dead with the wa-
ter I had taken in. As soon as I got on my feet,
I ran as fast as I could, lest another wave should
pursue me, and carry me back again. But for
all the haste I made, I could not avoid it, for the
sea came after me like a high mountain, or a fu-
rious enemy; so that my business was to hold
my breath, and by raising myself on the water,
to save myself by swimming. The next dread-
ful wave buried me at once twenty or thirty feet
deep, but, at the same time, carried me with a
mighty force and swiftness towards the shore,
when raising myself, I held out as well as possi*
bio, till, at length, the water having spent itself,
began to return, at which I struck forward, and
feeling ground again with my feet, I took to my
heels. "Thus being served twice more, I was at
last dashed against a piece of rock, in such a
manner as left me senseless, but recovering a
little before the return of the wave, which no
doubt would then overwhelm me, I held fast by
the rock till those succeeding waves abated; and
then fetching another run, was overtaken by a
small wave, which was soon conquered. But
before any more could overtake me, I reached
the main land, where clambermg up the cliffs of
the shore, tired and almost spent, I sat down on
the grass, free from the danger of the foaming
ocean.
No tongue can express the transports that my
soul felt at this happy deliverance. I was wrapt
up in contemplation, and often lifted up my hands
with the profoundest humility, jto the Divine
Power for saving my life; when the rest of my
companions were all drowned. And now I be-
gan to cast my eyes around, and to behold what
place I was in, and what I had next to do. I
could see no house nor people; I was wet, yet
had no clothes to shift me; hungry and thirsty,
yet had nothing to eat or drink, no weapon to
destroy any creature for my sustenance, nor de-
fend myself against devouring beasts; in short
I had nothing but a knife, a tobacco pipe, and a
box half filled with tobacco. The darksome
night coming upon me, increased my fears of
being devoured by wild creatures, my mind was
plunged into despair, and having no orosp.ect, as
I thought, of life before me, I prepared for ano-
ther kind of death than what I had lately escaped.
I walked about a furlong, to see if I could find
any fresh water, which I did, to my great joy;
and taking a quid of tobacco to prevent hunger,
I got up into a thick bushy tree, and seating my-
self so that I could not fall, a deep sleep over-
took me, and for that night, buried my sorrows
in a quiet repose.
It was broad day the next morning before I
awoke, when I not only perceived the tempest
was ceased, but saw the ship driven almost as
far as the rock before-mentioned, which was
about a mile from the place where I was.—
When I came down from my apartment in the
tree, I perceived the ship's boat two miles dis-
tant on my right hand, lying on shore as the
waves had cast her. I thought to have got t*
her; but there being an inlet of water about
half a mile's breadth between it and me, I re-
turned again towards the ship, as hoping to find
something for my more immediate subsistence.
About noon when the sea was so calm that I
could come within a quarter of a mile of her, it
was to my grief I perceived, that if we had kept
on board, all our lives would have been saved.
These thoughts,and my solitude, drew tears from
my eyes, though all in vain. So resolving to
get to the ship, I stripped and leaped into the
water; when swimming round her, I was afraid
I could not get any thing to lay hold of; but it
was my good fortune to espy a small piece of
rope hanging down so low, that, by the help of
it, though with great difficulty, I got into the ship.
Here I found that the ship was bilged, and had
a great deal of water in her, her stern was lifted
up against a bank, and her head almost in the
water. All her quarter, and what was there,
were free and dry. The provisions I found in
good order, and losing no time, ate while I was
doing other things. I also found some rum, of
which I took a little; and now I wanted for no-
thing except a boat, which indeed was all, to
can \ away what was needful for me.
Necessity occasions a quickness of thought.
We had several spare yards, a spare topmast or
two, and two or three large spars of wood. With
these I fell to work, and slung as many of them
overboard as I could manage, tying every one of
them with a rope that they might not drive away.
This done, I went down the ship's side and tied
four of them fast together at both ends, in form
of a raft, and laying two or three short pieces of
plank upon them cross ways, I found it would
bear me but not any considerable weight. Upon
which I went to work again, cutting a spare top-
mast into three lengths, adding them to mv rai't
with a great deal of labour and pains. I llren
Srst laying upon it all the planks and boards .
could get, next lowered down three of the sea-
men's chests after I had filled them with bread,
rice, three Dutch cheese, five pieces of dried
goat's flesh, and some European corn, what lit-
tle the rats had spared; and for liquors, I found
several cases of bottles, in which were some cor-
dial waters, and four or five gallons of arrack.
By this time the tide beginning to flow, I per-
ceived mv coa.t waistcoat and shir,t swini awar
3
Which I had left on shore; as for my linen
breeches and stockings, I swam with them to
the ship,; but I soon found clothes enough^
though I .took no more than I wanted for the
present. My eyes were chiefly on tools to work
with, and after a long search, I found out the
carpenter's cliest, iyhich I got safe down on my
raft. I then looked for arms and ammunition, and
in the great cabin, found two good fowling pieces;
two pistols, several powder horns filled, a small
bag of shot, arid two rusty swords. I likewise
found three barrels of powder, two of which
were good, but the third had taken water, also
two or three broken oars; two saws, ah axe, ana
a hammer. I then put to sea, and in getting to
shore had three encouragements. 1. A smooth
'calm sea: 2. The tide rising and setting in to the
shore: 3. The little wind there was, blowing
towards land. After I had sailed about a mile;
I found the raft driving a little distance from the
place where I first landed; and when I perceived
tin opening of the land, with a strong current of
the tide running into it, .Upon which I kept the
middle of the stream, But great was my con-
cern, when on a sudden the forepart of my raft
ran aground. But after some time, the rising of
the water caused the raft to float again, and com-
ing up a little river, with land on both sides, I
landed in a little cave, as near the mouth as pos-
sible, the better to discover a sail, if any such
providentially passed that way.
Not far off, I espied a hill of stupendous
height, surrounded with smaller hills about it,
Bad thither I was resolved to go and view the
country, that I might see what part was best to
fix my habitation in. Accordingly, arming my-
self with a pistol, a fowling piece, powder, and
ball, I ascended the mountain. There I per-
ceived I was in an island, encompassed by the
sea, no distant lands to be seen, but scattering
rocks that lay to the west; that it seemed to be
a barren place, and as I thought only inhabited
by wild beasts. I perceived abundance of fowls,
but was ignorant of what kind, or whether good
for nourishment. I shot one of them at my re-
i«rn, which occasioned a confused screaming
among the other birds, and I found it, by its co-
lour and beak, to be a kind of hawk, but its flesh
was tferfe.ct carrion.
"W hen I came to my raft I brought my effects
on. shore} which work spent that day entirely;
^nd fearing that some cruel beast might devour
me in the night time while I slept, I made a kind
of hut, or barricade, with the chests and boards I
had brought on shore. That night I slept very
'comfortably; and the next morning my thoughts
were employed to make a further attempt to the
ship, and bring away what necessaries I could
find, before another storm should break her in
pieces. Accordingly, I got on board as before*
and prepared a second raft far better than the
first; upon which, I brought away the carpen-
ter's stores, two or three bags full of nails, a
great jack-screw, a dozen or two of hatchets,
and a grind-stone. I also took two or three iron
crows, two barrels of musket-bullets, another
fowling piece, a small quantity of powder, and
a large hag full of small shot. Besides these, I
took all the men's clothes I could find, a spare
fore-top-sail, a hammock, and some bedding;
and thus completing my second cargo, I made all
the haste on shore I could, fearing some wild
beast might destroy what I had there already.
But I only found a little wild cat sitting on one
of the chests, who not seeming to fear me or the
gun that I presented at her, I threw her a piece of
biscuit, which she instantly ate and departed.
When I had got these effects on shore, I went
to work, in order to make me a little tent with
the sail and some poles, which I had cut for the
purpose, and having finished it, what things might
be damaged by the weather, I brought in, piling
all the empty chests and casks in a circle, the
better to fortify it against any sudden attempt of
man or beast. After this I blocked up the doors
with some boards, and an empty chest turned
the long way out. I then charged my gun and
pistol, and laying my bed on the ground, slept as
comfortably till the next morning, as though I had
been in a christian countrv.
Now, though I had enough to subsist me a
long time, yet despairing of a sudden deliver-
ance, and fearing that both ammunition and pro-
vision might be spent before such a thing hap-
pened, I saved as much as I could, and so long
as the ship remained in that condition, I daily
brought away one necessary or other; particu-
larly, the rigging, sails, and cordage, some.twine,
a barrel of wet powder, some sugar, a barrel of
meal, three casks of rum, and indeed what was
most welcome to me, a whale hogshead of
bread.
The next time I went, I cut the cables in
pieces, carried off a hawser whole, with a great
deal of iron work, and made another raft; but
this being so imwieldy, by the too heavy burden
upon it, and I not being able so dexterously to
guide it as the former, both my cargo and myself
were overturned. For my part all the damage
I sustained was a wet skin ;. and at low water,
after much labour in diving, I got up most of the
cables; and some pieces of iron. Thirteen days
had I now been on the island, and eleven days
on board, bringmg away all that was possible.
As I was going the twelfth time, the wind began
to rise; however, I ventured at low water, and
rummaging the cabin, in a locker, I found seve-
ral razors, scissors, and some dozens of knives
dnd forks, and in another, thirty-six pounds in
pieces of eight, silver and gold. I wrapt the mo-
up in a piece of canvas, arid began to think of
making another raft; but I soon perceived the
wind beginning to rise, a fresh gale blowing from
the shore; and the sky overcast with clouds and
darkness. So thinking a raft to be in vain, I let
myself into the water with what things I had
about me; and it was with great difficulty I got
ashore, when soon after it blew a fearful storm.
That night I slept very contentedly in my little
tent, surrounded with\all my effects; but when I
looked out in the morning, no more ship was to
be- seen. This much surprised me for the pre-
sent: yet, when I considered that I had lost no
time, abated no pains, and had got every thing
useful out of her, I comforted myself in the best
3*
i in
manner, and entirely submitted to divine Provi-
dence.
My next thoughts were, how I should defend
and secure myself from savages and wild beasts,
if any such were in the island.
"When I considered the ground where I was.
that it was marshy, and had no fresh water near
it, my resolutions were to search for a soil heal-
thy and well watered, where I might not only be
shekel ed from the sun's scorching heat, but be
more conveniently situated, as well to be secur-
ed from wild men, and beasts of prey, as more
easily to discover any distant sail, should it ever
so happen.
And indeed it was not long before I had my
desire. I found a little plain near a rising hill,
the front towards which, being as steep as a
house-side, nothing could descend on me from
the top.
On the side of this rock was a little hollow
place, resembling the entrance or door of a cave.
Just before this place, on the circle of the green.
I resolved my tent should stand. This plain did
not much exceed a hundred yards broad, and
about twice as long, like a delightful green before
my door, with a pleasing, though irregular de-
scent every way to the low grounds by the sea
side, sheltered from the excessive heat of the
«un. After this, I drew a simicircle, twenty
yards in diameter, driving down two rows of
strong stakes not six inches from each other.
Then, with the pieces of cable which I had cut
onboard, I regularly laid them in a circle between
the piles, up to their tops, which were more than
five feet out of the earth, .and then drove another
row of piles, looking within side against them,
between two or three feet high, which made me
conclude it a little castle, impregnable by men
and beasts. And for my better security I would
have no door, but entered in and came out by the
help of a ladder, which I abo made.
Here was my fence and fortress, into which I
carried all my riches, ammunition and stores.
After which, working on the rock, what with the
dirt and stones I dug out, I not only raised my
ground two feet, but made a little cellar to my
mansion-house; and this cost me many days la-
bour and pains. One day in particular, a show-
er of rain falling, thunder and lightning ensued,
which put me in terror lest my powder should
take fire, and not only hinder my necessary sub-
sistence, by killing my food, but even blow up
me and my habitation. To prevent which, I fell
to making boxes and bags, in order to separate
it, having by me near 1501b. weight. And thus
being established as king of the island, every day
I went out with my gun to see what I could kill
that was fit to eat. 1 soon perceived numbers of
goats, but very shy; yet having watched them
narrowly, and seeing I could better phoot off the
rocks than when in the low grounds, I happened
to shoot a she-goat suckling a young kid; which,
not thinking its dam slain, stood by her uncon-
cerned; and when I took the dead creature up,
the young one followed me even to the enclosure.
I lifted the kid over the pales, and would willing-
ly have kept it alive, but finding it could not be
mi
brought to eat, I was forced to slay it also for my
subsistence.
Thus, entered into as strange a state as ever
any man was in, I had most melancholy appre-
hensions concerning my deplorable condition;
and many times the tears would plentifully run
down my face, when I considered how I was de-
barred from all communication with human kind.
Yet while these desponding cogitations would
seem to make me accuse Providence, other good
thoughts would interpose and reprove me after
this manner ; >' Well, supposingyou are desolate,
is it not better to be so, than totally perish 1 Why
should you complain, when not only your life is
preserved, but the ship driven into your reach, in
order to take what was necessary out of her for
a subsistence V But to proceed: it was, by the
account I kept, the thirtieth of September, when
I first landed on this island. About twelve days
after, fearing lest I should lose my reckoning of
time, nay even forget the sabbath days for want
of pen, ink, and paper, I carved with a knife up-
on a large post, in great letters, I came on shore,
Sep. 30, 1659, and set it up in the similitude of
a cross, on the sea shore where I landed. Every
day I cut a notch with my knife on the sides
of the square post, and that on the sabbath was
as long again as the rest, and every first day of
the month as long again as that long one. la
this manner I kept my calendar, weekly, month-
ly, or yearly reckoning of time. But had I
made a more strict search (as I did afterwards,)
I need not have set up this mark. For among
,tf»e parcels belonging to the gunner, carpenter,
and captain's mate, I found those very things I
wanted; particularly pens, ink, and paper; al-
so I found two or three compasses, some mathe-
matical instruments, dials, perspective glasses
books of navigation, three English Bibles, and
several other good books, which I carefully put
up. Here I cannot but call to mind, our having
a dog and two cats on board, whom I made in-
habitants with me in my castle. Though one
might think 1 had all the necessaries that were
desirable, yet still I found several things wanting.
My ink was daily wasting: I wanted needles,
pins, and thread, to mend or keep my clothes to-
gether: and particularly a spade, pick-axe, or
shovel, to remove the earth. It was a year be-
fore I finished my little bulwark; and having
some intervals of relaxation, after my daily wan-,
dering abroad for provision, I drew up this plan
alternately, as creditor and debtor, to remind me
of the miseries and the blessings of my hfe, under
so many v.arious circumstances.

LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF
Like- a hermit (ra-
ther should I say a
lonely anchorite,) am I
forced from human
conversation.
My clothes, after
some time will be worn
out, and then I shall
have none to cover
When my ammuni-
tion is wasted, then
shall I remain without
any defence against
wild men and beasts.
I have no creature,
no soul to speak to;
none to beg assistance
from. Some comfort
would it be to resound
my woes where I am
understood, and beg
assistance where I
might hope for relief.
However, I have
food to eat, and even
a happy prospect of
subsistence whilst life
endures.
At present I enjoy
what is absolutely
needful; and the cli-
mate is so hot, that
had I ever so many
I should hardly wear
them.
Yet even thus, I see
no danger of any to
hurt me, as in Africa;
and what if I had been
cast away upon that
coast.
Is there not God to
converse with, and is
not he able to deliver
thee? already has he af-
forded thee sustenance
and put it in thy powei
to provide for thyself,
till he sends thee a de-
liverance.
And now, easing my mind a little by these re-
flections, I began to render my life as easy as
possible.
I must here add to the description I have
given of my habitation, that having raised a turt
wall against the outside of it, I thatched it so
close as might keep it from the inclemency of
the weather; I also improved it within, enlarged
my cave, and made a passage and a door in the
rock, which came out beyond the pale of my
fortification. I next proceeded to make a chair
and table, and so began to study such mechanical
arts as seemed to me practicable. When I
wanted a plank or board, I hewed down a tree
with my hatchet, making it as thin with my axe as
possible, and then smooth enough with an adze,to
answer my designs; yet though I could make no
more this way than one board out of a tree, in
length of time I got boards enough to shelter all my
stores, every thing being regularly placed, and my
guns securely hanging against the side of a rock.
This made it a very pleasant sight to me, being
the result of vast labour and great diligence;
which leaving for a while, and me to the enjoy-
ment of, I shall give the reader an account of
some parts of my journal from the day of my
landing, till the setting of my habitation, as
heretofore shown.
JOURNAL.
September 30th, 1659,1, unhappy Robinson
Crusoe, havmg suffered shipwreck, was driven
on this desolate island, which I named the
Desolate Island of Despair, the rest of my com-
panions being swallowed up in the tempestuous
ocean. The next day I spent in consideration
of my unhappy circumstances, having no pros-
peet but of death, either to be starved with hun-
ger, or devoured by wild beasts or merciless
savages.
Oct. 1. That morning, with great comfort, I
beheld the ship drove ashore. Some hopes I
had, that when the storm was abated I might be
able to get some food and necessaries out of
her; which I conceived were not damaged, be-
cause the ship did stand upright. At this time,
I lamented the loss of my companions, and our
misfortune in leaving the vessel. When I per-
ceived the ship, as it were) to lie dry, I waded
through the sands, then swam aboard, the wea-
ther being very rainy, and with scarcely any
wind.
To the 14th of this month,' my time was em-
ployed in making voyages every tide; getting
what I could out of the ship: The weather very
wet and uncertain.
Oct. 25. My raft, and all the goods thereon
were overset; yet I recovered most again at low
water.
Oct. 25. It blew hard, and rained night and
day, when the ship went in pieces, so that nothing
was seen of her but the wreck at low water.
This day I secured my goods from the incle-
mency of the weather.
Oct. 26. I wandered to see where I could
find a place convenient for my abode: I fixed
upon a rock in the evenings marked out a half
moon-, intending to erect a wall fortified with
piles, lined within with pieces of cables, and
covered with turf.
Nov. 3. I shot two wild-fowls^ resembling
i - =i
ducks, which were good to eat, and in the after-
noon made me a table.
Nov. 4. I began to live regularly. In the'
morning I allowed myself two or three hours to
Walk out with my gun; I then worked till near
eleven o'clock; and afterwards refreshed myself
with what I had to eat. From twelve to two, I
would lie down to sleep. Extreme sultry
Weather. In the evening go to work again.
Nov. 5. Went out with my gun and dog, shot
i wild cat with a soft skin, but her flesh was good
for nothing. The skins of those killed I pre-
served. On my return I perceived many wild
birds, and was terrified by some seals which
made off to sea.
Nov. 6. Completed my table.
Nov. 7. Fair weather. I worked to the 12th,
but omitted the llth> which according to my
calculation* I supposed to be Sunday.
Nov. 17. I began to dig in the rock, yet was
obliged to desist for want of a pick-axe, shovel
and wheel-barrow. Iron crows I used to supply
the place of the first, but with all my art I could
not make a wheel-barrow.
Nov. 19. It was my fortune to find a tree re-
sembling what the Brazilians call an iron tree.
I had like to spoil my laxe with cutting it, it
being very hard, and exceedingly heavy; yet
with much labour and industry I made a sort of
spade out of it.
Nov. 23. These tools being made, I daily
carried on my business; eighteen days I allowed
for enlarging my cave, that it might serve me,
'not only for a ware-house, but kitchen, parlour
4
and cellar. I commonly lay in the tent, unless
the weather was so rainy that I could not lie dry.
So wet would it be at certain seasons, that I
was obliged to cover all within the pale with long
poles, in the form of rafters, leaning against the
rock, and load them with flags and large leaves
of trees resembling a thatch.
Dec. 10. No sooner did I think my habitation
fmished, but suddenly a great deal of the top
broke in, so that >t was a mercy I was not buried
in the ruins. This occasioned a great deal of
pains and trouble to me before I could make it
firm and durable.
Dec. 17. I nailed up some shelves, and drove
nails and staples in the wall and posts, to hang
every thing out of the way.
Dec. 20. Every thing I got into its place,
then made a sort of dresser, and another table.
Dec. 27. I chanced to light on some goats,
shot one, wounded another; I led it home in a
string, bound up its leg, and cured it in a little
time; at length, it became so tame and familiar
as to feed before the door, and follow me where
I pleased. This put me, in mind to bring up
tame creatures, in order to supply me with food
after my ammunition was spent.
Dec. 28, 29, 30. The weather being exces-
sively hot, with little air, obliged me for the
most part to keep within doors.
Jan. 3, to 14. My employment this time
was to finish the wall before described, and
search the island. I discovered a kind of pi-
geons, like our house-pigeons, in a nest among
the rocks. I brought them home, nursed them
till they could fly, and then they left me. Af->
ter this* I shot some, which proved excellent
food. Some time I spent vainly contriving to
make a cask, I may well say it was in vain, be-
cause I could neither joint the staves, nor fix
the heads, so as to make it tight; so leaving
that, I took some goats tallow I had by me,
and a little oakum for the wick, and provided
myself with a lamp, which served instead of
candles.
But now a very strange event happened. For
being in the height of my search, what should
come into my hand, but a bag which was used
to hold corn (-as I supposed,) for the fowls; so
immediately resolving to put gunpowder into it,
I shook all the husks and dirt upon one side of
a rock, little expecting what the consequence
would be. The rain had fallen plentifully a
few days before; and about a month after, to
my great amazement, something began to look
out very green and flourishing; and when I
came to view it more nicely, every day as it
grew, I found aboit ten or twelve ears of green
barley of the very same shape and make as that
in England.
I can scarcely express the agitation of my
mind at this sight. Hitherto, I had looked
upon the actions of this life no otherwise than
only as the events of blind chance, and fortune.
But now, the appearance of this barley, flour-
ishing in a barren soil, and my ignorance in
not conceiving how it should come there, made
me conclude, "that miracles were not yet ceas-
ed;" nay, I even thought that God had appoint-
==- r=at
ed it to grow there without any seed, purely for
my sustenance in this miserable and desolate
island. And indeed such great effect had this
upon me, that it often made me melt into tears
through a grateful sense of God's mercies; and
the greater still was my thankfulness, when I
perceived about this little field of bailey, some
ride stalks, also wonderfully flourishing.
While thus pleased in mind, I concluded
there must be some more corn in the island;
and therefore made a diligent search narrowly
among the rocks; but not being able to fina
any, on a sudden it came into my mind, how I
had shaken the husks of corn out of the bag
and then my admiration ceased, with my grati-
tude to the Divine Being, as thinking it was but
natural, and not to be conceived a miracle;
though even the manner of its preservation
might have made me own it as a wonderful
event of God's kind providence.
It was about the latter end of June when the
ears of the corn ripened, which I laid up very
carefully, together with 20 or 30 stalks of rice;
expecting one day I should reap the fruit of
my labour; yet four years were expired before
I could allow myself to eat any barley bread,
and much longer time before I had any rice.
After this, with indefatigable pains and indus-
try for three or four months, at last I finished
my house on the 14th of April, having no way
to go into it, but by a ladder against the wall.
-April 16. I finished my ladder, and ascended
it; afterwards pulled it up, then let it down on
the other side, and descended into my new ha-
ROBINSON CRUSOE. 41
bitation, where I had space enough, and so forr
tified, that nothing could attack me without
scaling the walls.
But what does all human art and industry
avail, if the blessing of God does not crown
our labours? Or who can stand before the Al-
mighty, when he stretcheth forth his arm? For
one time as I was at the entrance of my cave,
there happened such a dreadful earthquake,
that not only the roof of the cave came tumbling
about my ears, but the posts seemed to crack
terribly at the same time. This put me in a
great amazement; and running to the ladder
and getting over the wall, I then plainly knew
it was an earthquake, the place I stood on sus-
taining three terrible shocks in less than three
minutes. But judge of my terror when I saw
the top of a great rock roll into the sea; I then
expected the island would be swallowed up
every moment: and what made the scene still
more dreadful, was to see the sea thrown into
the most violent agitations and disorders by this
tremendous accident.
For my part, I expected every moment to be
swallowed up. At the moving of the earth, I
was, as it were, sea-sick; and very much afraid
lest the rock, under which was my fence and
habitation, should overwhelm me and it in a
lasting tomb.
It was not long after, when a horrible tem-
pest arose at the same time attended with a
hurricane of wind. Three hours did this storm
continue, and in so violent a manner as to tear
the very trees up by the roots, which was suc»
4»
ceeded by abundance of rain. When the tem-
pest was over, I went to my tent; but the rain
coming on in a furious manner, I was obliged
to take shelter in the cave, where I was forced
to cut a channel through my fortification, to
let the water out. It continued raining all that
night, and some time the next day. These ac-
cidents made me resolve, as soon as the wea-
ther cleared up, to build me a little hut in some
open place, walled round, to defend me from
wild creatures and savages; not doubting, but
at the next earthquake, the mountain would
fall on my habitation and me, and swallow, up
all in its bowels.
April 16—20. These days I spent in con-
triving how and in what, manner I should fix
my place of abode. All this while, I was unr
der the most dreadful apprehensions. When
I looked round my habitation, every thing I
found in its proper place. I had several de-
bates whether I should move or not; but at
length resolved to stay where I was, till I
found out a convenient place where I might
pitch my tent.
April 22. When I began to put my resolu-
tions in practice, I was stopped for want of
tools and instruments to work with. Most of
my axes and hatchets were useless, occasioned
by cutting the hard timber that grew on the
island. It took me up a full week to make my
grindstone of use to me; and at last I found
out a way to turn it about with my foot, by help
of a wheel and a string.
April 30. My bread falling short, I allow-
ed myself but one biscuit a day.
May 1. As I walked along the sea-shore
I found a barrel of gunpowder, and sevem,
pieces of the wreck which the sea had flung up.
Having secured these, I made to the ship, who.su
stern was torn off, and washed a great distance
ashore; but the rest lay in the sands. This, 1
suppose, was occasioned by the earthquake. I
now resolved to keep my old place of abode:
and also to get to the ship that day, but found
it impossible.
May 3. This day I went on board, and with
my saw sawed off one of the beams, which kept
her quarter-deck. I then cleared the sand till
flood.
May 4. I caught some fish, but they wero
not wholesome. The same day, I also caught
a young dolphin.
May 5. This day also I repaired to the
wreck, and sawed another piece of timber,
and when the flood came, I made a float of
three great planks, which were driven ashorn
by the tide.
May 6—9. These days, I brought off the
iron bolts, opened the deck with the iron crow,
and carried two planks to land, having made a
way into the very middle of the wreck.
May 10—13. All this time I spent in bring-
ing off great quantities of iron and timber.
May 15. Took with me two hatcheta oa
purpose to cut off some lead from the roll but
.all in vain, for it lay too low under water.
May 24. To this day, I worked on th»
wreck, and with great difficulty loosened some
things so much with the crow, that at the first
blowing tide, several casks floated out, and se-
veral of the seamen's chests; yet that day no-
thing came to land but pieces of timber, and a
nogshead which had some pork in it. I con-
tinued working to the 15th of June; (except
necessary times for food and rest,) and had I
known how to build a boat, I had timber and
planks enough; I had also near 100 weight of
sheet lead.
June 16. As I was wandering towards the
sea-siide, I found a large tortoise or turtle, be-
ing the first I had seen on the island, though,
as I afterwards found, there were many on the
other side of it.
June 17. This day I spent in cooking it,
found in her threescore eggs, and her flesh the
most savory and pleasant I ever tasted in my
life.
June 18. I staid within this day, there be-,
ing a continual rain; and it was somewhat
more chilly and cold than usual.
June 19. Exceedingly ill, taken with a
trembling and shivering.
June 20. Awake all night, my head racked
with pain, and feverish.
June 21. Sick unto death, and terrified
with dismal apprehensions of my condition.
Prayed to God more frequently, but very con-
fusedly.
June 22. Something better, but still uneasy
in my mind.
June 23. Again relapsed much as before.
June 24. Mended a second time.
June 25. A violent ague for seven hours,
cold and hot fits, succeeded with faint sweats.
June 26. Better, but very weak; yet I
scrambled out, shot a she goat, brought it
home, and broiled some of it; I would wil-
lingly have stewed it and made some broth,
but had no pot.
June 27. All this day I was afflicted with
an ague; thirsty, yet could not help myself to
water; prayed to God in these words: "Lord;
in pity look upon me: Lord, have mercy upon
/ne, have mercy upon me!" After this I fell
asleep, which, when I awaked, I found had
much refreshed me.
I rose up, in a pensive manner, being so
thoughtful that I could not go to sleep: and
fearing the dreadful return of my distemper, it
caused me to remember, that the Brazilians
use tobacco for almost all diseases. I then
went to my chest, m order to find some, where
heaven, no doubt, directed me to find a cure,
both for soul and body; for there I found one
of the bibles, which, till this time, I had neither
leisure nor inclination to look into; I took
both the tobacco and that out of my chest, and
laid them on the table. Several experiments did
I try with the tobacco. First, I took a piece of
leaf, and chewed it; but it being very green
and strong, almost stupified me: next I steep-
ed it in some rum an hour or two, resolving
when I went to bed, to take a dose of it: and,
in the third place, I burnt soma over a pan of
fire, holding my nose over it so long as I could
endure it without suffocation.
In the intervals of this operation, though my
head was giddy and disturbed by the tobacco,
I took up the Bible to read. No sooner did I
Open, but there appeared to me these words,
"Call on me in the day of trouble and I will
deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me."
At first, this sentence made a very deep im-
pression on my heart: but it soon wore off
again when I considered the word " deliver" was
foreign to me. And as the children of Israel
said, when they were promised flesh to eat,
'* Can God spread a table in the wilderness V in
the like manner I began to say, Can God him-
self deliver me from this desolate Island? How-
ever, the words would still return to my mind,
and afterwards made a greater impression upon
me. As it now was very late, and the tobacco
had dozed my head, I was inclined to sleep;
but before I would lie down, I fell on my knees,
and implored the promise that God had made to
me in the holy Scriptures, that " if I called on
him in the day of trouble, he would deliver me."
With much difficulty I afterwards drank the
rum, wherein I had steeped the tobacco, which
flying into my head,- threw me into such a
profound sleep, that it was three o'clock the
next day before I awoke; or rather I believe, I
slept two days, having certainly lost a day in my
account, and I could never tell any other way.
When I got up, my spirits were lively and
cheerful; my stomach much better, being very
hungry; and, in short no tit returned the next
day, which was the 29th, but I found myself
much altered for the better.
July 3. The fit quite left me, but very weak.
In this condition, I often thought of these
words, "I will deliver thee:" and while at
sometimes I would think of the impossibility of
it, other thoughts would reprehend me, for
disregarding the deliverances I had received
even from the most forlorn and distressed con-
dition. I asked myself, what regard have I had
to God for his abundant mercies? Have I
done my part? *' He 'has delivered me, but I
have not glorified him;" as if I had said I had
riot owned and been thankful for these as de-
liverances, 'and how could I expect greater?
So much did this sensibly touch my heart, that
I ga<ve God thanks for my recovery from sick-
ness in the most humble posture.
-July 4. This morning I began seriously to
ponder on what is written in the New Testament,
resolving to read a chapter every morning and
night, as long as my thoughts would engage me
As soon as I set about this work seriously, 1
found my heart deeply affected with the impiety
of my past life. After this, I begged of God
to assist me with his holy Spirit in returning to
my duty. One day, in perusing the Scriptures,
I came to these words, "He is exalted a Frince
and a Saviour, to give repentance, and to give
remission:" Immediately I laid down the
book, and, with uplifted hands to heaven, loudly
•cried, " 0 'blessed Jesus, thou son of David!
'testis, thou exalted Priaoe and Saviour, give
hie repentance:" And, now indeed, I prayed
with a true sense of my condition, and a more
Certain hope, founded on the word of God. Now
J had a different sense of these words, "Call on
me, and I will deliver thee," that is from the
dreadful load of guilt, which oppressed my sinful
soul, and not from a solitary life: in a word* I
came to this conclusion, that a deliverance from
sin was a much greater blessing than a deliver-
ance from affliction.
To the 14th of July, I walked about with my
gun, little and little at a time, having been re-
duced to the greatest extremity of weakness^.
The applications and experiments I used were
perfectly new: neither could I recommend them
to any one's practice. For though it carried off
the fit, it very much weakened me; and I had
frequently convulsions in my nerves and limbs
for some time. From hence I learned, that
going abroad in rainy weather, especially when
it was attended with storms and hurricanes of
wind was most pernicious to health. I had now
been above ten months in the island; and as I
never had seen any of the human kind, I
therefore accounted myself as sole monarch;
and as I grew better, having secured my habita-
tion to my mind, I resolved to make a tour round
my kingdom, in order to make new discoveries.
The 15th of July, I began my journey. I
first went to the creek, where I had brought my
rafts on shore: and travelling farther found the
tide went no higher than two miles up, where
there was a little brook of running water, on the
bank of which were many pleasant savannahs
or meadows, smooth, plain and covered with
grass. On the rising parts, where I supposed
the water did not reach, I perceived a great deal
of tobacco growing to a very strong stalk.
Several other plants I likewise found, the virtue
of which I did not understand. I searched a
long time for the cassava root, which I knew the
Indians in that climate made their bread of; but
all in vain. There were several plants of aloes,
though at that time I knew not what they were:
likewise I saw several sugar-canes, but imperfect
for want of cultivation. With these few disco-
veries, I came back that night, and slept con-
tentedly in my little castle.
The next day, being the 16th, going the same
way, but farther than the day before, I found the
country more adorned with woods and trees.
Here I perceived different fruits in great abun-
dance. Melons in plenty lay on the ground, and
clusters of grapes, ripe and very rich, spread
over the trees. You may imagine 1 was glad of
this discovery, yet ate very sparingly, lest I
should throw myself into a -flux or fever. The
grapes I found of excellent use; for when t
dried them in the sun, which preserved them as
dried rasins are kept, they proved very whole-
some and nourishing, and served me in those
seasons when no grapes were to be had.
The night drawing on apace, I ascended up a
tree, and slept very comfortably, though it was
the first time I had slept out of my habitation.
And when the morning came, I proceeded
^ith (great pleasure on my way, travelling about
?«>u> miles, as I imagmed, by the length of the
5
Valley. At the end of this valley I came to an
opening, where the country seemed to descend
to the west; there I found a spring of fresh
water, proceeding out of the side of the hill,
with its crystal streams running directly east.
And indeed here my senses were charmed
with the most beautiful landscape nature could
afford; for the country appeared so flourishing,
green and delightful, that to me it seemed like a
planted garden. I then descended on the side
of that delicious vale, when I found abundance
of cocoa, orange, lemon, and citron trees, but
very wild and barren at that time. As for the
limes, they were delightful and wholesome, the
juice of which I afterwards used to mix in water,
which made it very cool and refreshing. And
now I was resolved to carry home and lay up a
store of grapes, limes and lemons, against the
approaching wet season. So laying them up in
separate parcels, and then taking a few of each
with me, I returned to my little castle, after
having spent three days in this journey. Be-
fore I got home, the grapes were so bruised that
they were utterly spoiled: the limes indeed
were good, but of those, I could bring only a
few.
July 19. Having prepared two bags, 1 re-
turned thither again, but lo my great surprise,
fownd all the grapes spread about, trod to pieces,
and abundance eaten, which made me conclude
there were wild beasts thereabouts. To prevent
this happening again, I gathered a large quantity
of the grapes, and hung them upon the out
branches of the tree, both to keep them unhurt,
and tlvat they might cure and dry in the sun; and
having well loaded myself with limes and lemons,
I returned once more to my old olace of resi-
dence.
And now, reflecting on the fruitfulness of this
valley, the pleasantness of its situation, its
recurity from storms, and the delightfulness of
the adjacent woods, I concluded I was settled in
the worst part of the country, and therefore was
thinking to remove my habitation.
lint when I considered again, that though it
was pleasant, it was off from the sea-side, where
there Was a possibility, some time or other, a
ship might either be driven or sail by; and that
to inclose myself among hills and woods must
certainly put an end to my hopes of deliverance;
I resolved to let my castle remain where Provi-
dence had first placed it. Yet, so delighted was
I with this place, that I made me a little kind of
bower, surrounding it with a double hedge, as
high as I Could reach, well staked and filled with
bulrushes : and having spent a great part of the
month of July, I think it was the first of A ugust
before I began to enjoy my labour.
Jlugusl 3. Perceiving my grapes to be dry,
I took them from the trees, and they proved ex-
cellent good raisins of the sun: the most of
which I carried to my cave: and happy for me I
did so, by which I saved the best part of my
winter food.
Jhigust 14. This day it began to rain; and
though I had made me a tent like the other, yet
having no shelter of a hill to keep me from
•terms, nor a cave behind me to retreat to, I
was obliged to return to my old castle, the rain
continued more or less every day, till the middle
of October; and sometimes so violently, that I
could not stir out of my cave for several days.
This season I found my family to increase;
for one of my cats that had run away from me,
and which I thought had been dead, returned
about August, with three kittens at her heels,
like herself ; from these cats proceeded such
numbers, that I was forced to kill and destroy
them as I would do wild beasts or vermin.
To the 26th of this month, I could not stir out,
it raining incessantly; when beginning to want
food, I was compelled to venture twice, the first
of which times I shot a goat, and afterwards
found a very large tortoise. The manner of
regulating my food was thus: a bunch of raisins
served me for my breakfast; a piece of goats
flesh or turtle boiled for my dinner, and two or
three turtle eggs for my supper. While the rain
lasted, I daily worked two or three hours at
enlarging my cave, and, by degrees worked it
on towards one side of the hill, and made a
door or way out, which came beyond my fence
or wall, and so I came in and out this way.
But after I had done this, I was troubled to see
myself thus exposed; though I could not per-
ceive any thing to fear, a goat being the biggest
creature I had seen upon this island.
September 30. Casting up the notches on my
post, they amounted to 365, I concluded this to
be the anniversary of my landing; and there-
fore, humbly prostrating myself on the ground
-confessing my sins, acknowledging God'*
righteous judgments upon me, and praying to
Jesus Christ to have mercy upon me, I fasted for
twelve hours till the going down of the sun;
and then eating a biscuit and a bunch of grapes,
laid me on a bed, and with great comfort took
my night's repose. Till this time, I seldom had
distinguished the Sabbath-day; but now I made
a longer notch than ordinary for the days of
rest, and divided the weeks as well as I could,
though I found I had lost a day or two in my
account. My ink failing soon after, I omitted
in my daily memorandum, things of an indif-
ferent nature, and contented myself to write down
only the most remarkable events of my life.
The rainy and dry seasons appeared now regular
to me, and experience taught me how to provide
for them; yet in one thing I am going to relate,
my experience very much failed me. You may
call to mind, what I have mentioned of some
barley and rice which I had saved; about thirty
stalks of the former, and twenty of the latter;
and, at that time, the sun's being in its southern
position, going from me, together with the rains,
made me conclude it a very proper season to
sow it. Accordingly I dug up a piece of ground,
with my wooden spade, and dividing it in two
parts, sowed about two thirds of my seed, pre-
serving by me a handful of each. And happy it
was I did so; for no rains falling, it was choked
up, and never appeared above the earth till the
wet season came again, and then part of it grew,
as if it had been newly sown.
I was resolved still to make another trial; and
.asking for a moister piece of ground near my
5*
bower, I there sowed the rest of my seed in Feb-
ruary, which, by having the rainy months of
March and April to water it, yielded a noble
crop, and sprung up very pleasantly. I had still
saved part of the seed, not daring to venture
all; and by the time I found out the proper
seasons to sow it in, and that I might expect
every year two seed-times and two harvests, my
stock amounted to above half a peck of each sort
of grain.
No sooner were the rains over, but the stakes
which I had cut from the trees, shot out like
willows, the first year after lopping their heads.
I was ignorant of the tree I cut them from; but
they grew so regularly beautiful, that they made-
a most lively appearance, and so flourished in
three years time, that I resolved to cut more of
them; and these soon growing made a glorious
fence, as afterwards I shall observe.
And now I perceived that the seasons of the
year might generally be divided, not into sum-
mer and winter, as in Europe, but into wet, and
dry seasons, as in this manner.
From ( February 15, i Rainy, sun coming near
To ( April 15, J the Equinox, 2 months.
From ( Jipril 15, | On/, sun getting north
To ( August 15, ) from the line, 4 months.
From ( August 15, > Wet, the. sun being thev
To ( October 15, ) come back, 2 monllis.
From ( October 15, \ Dry, sun running south
To ) February 15, ) of the line 4 months.
The wet seasons would contmue longer or
shorter, as the wind continued or ceased to blow.
3ut having found the ill consequences of be^
iug abroad in the rain, I took care before hand to
furnish myself with provisions: and, during the
wet months, sat within doors as much as pos-
sible. At this time I contrived to make many
handy things that I wanted, though it cost me
much labour and pains, before I could accom-
plish them. The first I tried was to make a
basket; but all the twigs I could get, proved so
brittle, that I could not then perform it. It now
proved of great use to me, that when a boy, I
took great delight in standing at a basket ma-
ker's, in the same town where my father lived, tQ
view his men at work: like other boys, being
curious to see the manner of their working these
things, and very officious to assist, I perfectly
learned the method of it, and wanted nothing
but the tools. And it coming into my mind, that
the twigs of that tree of which I made my stakes,
might be as tough as a sallow, willow, or
osiers growing in England, I resolved to make
an experiment, and wenj the next day to my
country seat, and found some fit for my turn;
and after cutting down a quantity with my hat-
chet, I dried them in my pale, and when fit to
work with, carried them to my cave, where t
employed myself in making several sorts of bas-
kets, insomuch that I could put in whatsoever I
pleased. It is true, they wexe not cleverly made,
yet they served my turn upon all occasions.
But still I wanted two necessary things. J
Had no cask to hold my liquor, except two almost
full of rum, a few bottles of an ordinary size,
and some square case bottles; neither had I a
pot to boil any thing in, only a large kettle, unfit
to make broth, or stew a bit of meat: I wanted
likewise at the beginning of this dry season a
tobacco-pipe; but for this I afterwards found an
expedient.
I kept myself employed in planting my se-
cond row of stakes. But remembering that when
I travelled up to the brook I had a mind to see
the whole island, I now resumed my intention,
and taking my dog, gun, hatchet, two biscuit
cakes, a great bunch of raisins, with a larger
quantity of powder and shot than usual, I began
my journey. Having passed the vale where my
bower stood, I came within view of the sea lying
to the west; when, it being a clear day, I fairly
descried land, extending from the west to the
south-west about 10 or 15 leagues, as I con-
cluded; but could not say whether it was an
island or a continent. Neither could I tell what
this place might be; only thought it was part of
America, and where I might have been in a
miserable condition had I landed. Again I con-
sidered, that if this was the Spanish coast, cer-
tainly, one time or the other, I should see some
ships pass by; and if it was not, then it must be
the savage coast, between the Spanish country
and Brazil, which abounds with cannibals or man
eaters.
As I proceeded forward, I found this side oi
the island much more pleasant than mine; the
fields fragrant, adorned with sweet flowers and
verdant grass, together with several very fine
woods. There were parrots in plenty which
made me long for one to be my companion,; but
it was with great difficulty I could knock one
57
down with my stick; md I kept him at home
some years, before I c uld get him td call me by
name.
In the low grounds [ found various sorts of
hares and foxes as I took them to be, but much
different from those in England. Several of
these I killed, but never ate them; neither in-
deed had I any occasion; for abounding with
goats, pigeons, turtle, and grapes, I could defy
any market to furnish me a better table. In
this journey I did not travel above two miles a
day, because I took several turns and windings,
to see what discoveries I could make, returning
weary enough to the place where I designed to
rest all night, which was either in a tree, or to a
place which I surrounded with stakes, that no
-wild creature might suddenly surprise me.
When I came to the sea-shore, ,1 was amazed
to see the splendour of it. Its strand was cover-
ed with shells of the most beautiful fish, and
constantly abounding with innumerable turtles,
and fowls of many kinds, which I was ignorant
of, except those called penguins. I might have
shot as many as I pleased, but was sparing of
my ammunition, rather choosing to kill a she-
goaj, which I did with'much difficulty, on account
of the flatness of the country.
Now, though this journey produced the most
pleasing satisfaction, yet mj habitation was so
much to my liking, that I dm not repine at my
being seated on the worst part of the island. I
continued my journey, travelling about twelve
miles further towards the east, where I set a
great pile on the shore for a mark, concluding
that my next journey should bring me to the
other side of the island, east from my castle, and
so round till I came to my post again. As I had
a constant view of the country, I thought I could
not miss my way; but scarce had I travelled
three miles, when I descended into a very large
valley, so surrounded with hills covered with
wood, that having no guide but the sun, and to
add to my misfortune, the weather proving very
hazy, I was obliged to return to my post by the
sea-side, and so backwards the same way I
came. In this journey my dog surprised a kid,
and would have killed it had I not prevented him.
As I had often been thinking of getting a kid
or two, and so raising a breed of tame goats to
supply me after my ammunition was spent, 1 took
this opportunity of beginning: and, having made
a collar for this little creature, with a string made
of rope-yarn, I brought it to my bower, and there
inclosed and left him; and having spent a month
in this journey, at length I returned to my oltf
habitation.
Nobody can doubt of my satisfaction, when I
Returned to my little castle, and reposed myseli
in my hammock. After my journey I rested
myself a week, which time I employed in making
a cage for my pretty poll. I now began to re-
collect the poor kid I had left in the bower, and
immediately went to fetch it home. When I
came there, I found the young creature almost
starved; I gave it some food, and tied it as
before; but there was no occasion, for it followed
me like a dog; and as I constantly fed it, be-
came so loving, gentle, and fond, that it com-
fncnocd one of my domestics, and would never
leave me.
The rainy season of the autumnal equinox
being now come, I kept the 30th of September
in the most solemn manner, as usual, it being
the third year of my abode in the island. I spent
the whole day in acknowledging God's mercies,
in giving thanks for makir.g this solitary life as
agreeable, and less sinful, than that of human
society; and for the communication of his grace
to my soul, in supporting, comforting, and en*
couraging me to depend upon his Providence, and
hope for his eternal presence in the world to
come.
Indeed, I often did consider how much more
happy I was, in this state of life, than in that
acotfrsed manner of living I formerly used;
sometimes, however, when hunting, or viewing
the country, the anguish of my soul would break
out upon me, and my very heart would sink
within me, to think of the woods, the mountains,
the deserts I was in; and how I was a prisoner
locked up within the eternal bars and bolts of the
ocean, in an uninhabited wilderness, without hopes,
and without redemption. In this condition, I would
often wring my hands, and weep like a child: and
even sometimes in the middle of my work, this fit
would often take me; and then I would sit dow,n
and sigh, looking on the ground for an hour or
two together, till such time as my grief got vent
in a flood of tews.
One' morning, as I was fully employed in this
manner I opened my Bible, when immediately I
fixed my eyes upon these words "I will never
leave thee, nor forsake thee!" Surely, if God
does not forsake me, what matters it, since he
can make me more happy in this state of life,
that if I enjoyed the greatest splendour in the
, world? And whenever I opened or shut the
Bible, I blessed kind Providence, that directed
my good friend in England to send it among my
goods without my order, and for assisting me to
save it from the power of the raging ocean.
And now beginning my third year, my several
daily employments were these: First; My duty
to Heaven, and diligently reading the Holy
Scriptures which I did twice or thrice every day;
Secondly, Seeking provisions with my gun, which
commonly took me up, when it did not rain, three
hours every morning; Thirdly, The ordering,
curing, preserving, and cooking what I had killed,
or catched for my supply, which took me up a
great part of the day; for in the middle of the
day, the sun being in its height, it was, so hot,
that I could not stir out; so that I had but
four hours in the evening to work in: and
then the want of tools, of assistance, and skill,
wasted a great deal of time to little purpose,
I was no less than two and forty days, making a
board fit for a long shelf which two sawyers, with
their tools and saw-pit, would have cut out of
the same tree in half a day. It was of a large
tree, as my board was to be broad. I was three
days in cutting it down, and two more in lopping
off the boughs, and reducing it to a piece of tim-
ber. Thus I hacked and hewd off each side,
till it became light to move; then 1 turned it,
"made one side of it smooth and flat as a board
from end to end, then turned it downward, cut-
ting the other side, till I brought the plank to be
about three inches thick, and smooth on both
sides. Any body may judge my great labour
and fatigue in such a piece of work; but this I
went through with patience, as also many other
things, that my circumstances made necessary
for me to do.
The harvest months, November and Decem-
ber, were now at hand, in which I had the plea-
sing prospect of a very good crop. But here I
met with a new misfortune, for the goats and
hares, having tasted of the sweetness of the blade,
kept it so short that it had no strength to shoot up
into a stalk. To prevent this, I enclosed it with
a hedge, and by day shot some of its devourers;
and my dog, which I had tied to the field-gate,
keeping barking all night, so frightened these
'creatures that I got entirely rid of them.
But, no sooner did I get rid of these, than
'other enemies appeared; to wit, whole flocks
of several sorts of birds, who only waited till my
back was turned, to ruin me. So much did this
provoke me, that I let fly, and killed three of the
malefactors; and afterward served them as they
do notorious thieves in England, hung them up
in chains as a terror to others. And, indeed, so
good an effect had this, that they not only forsook
the corn, but all that part of the island, so long
as these criminals hung there. .
My corn having ripened apace, the latter end
of December, which was my second harvest, I
reaped it with a scythe, made of one of my
broad swords. 'I had no fatigue in cutting down
6
UPE AND ADVENTURES OF
my first crop, it was so slender. The ears I
carried home in a basket, rubbing the grain out
with my hands, instead of threshing it; and,
when my harvest was over, found my half peck ot
seed had produced nearly two buskels of rice,
and two bushels and a half of barley. And now
I plainly foresaw, that, by God's goodness, I
should be furnished with bread: but yet I was
concerned, because I knew hot how to grind or
make meal of my corn neither knew I how to
bake it into bread. I would not, however, taste
any of the crop, but resolved to preserve it
against next season, and, in the mean while, use
my best endeavours to provide myself with other
food.
But where were my labours to end? the want
of a plough to turn up the earth, or shovel to dig
it, I conquered by making me a wooden spade.
The want of a harrow I supplied, by dragging
over the corn a great bough of a tree. When it
Was growing, I was forced to fence it: when
ripe, to mow it, carry it home, thresh it, part it
from the chaff, and save it. And, aPer all, I
wanted a mill to grind it, a sieve to dress it, yeast
and salt to make it into bread, and an oven to
bake it. This set my brains to work, to find
some expedient for every one of these necessa-
ries, against the next harvest.
And now having more seed, my first care was
to prepare me more land. I pitched upon two
large flat pieces of ground, near my castle, for
that purpose, in which I sowed my seed, and
fenced it with a good hedge. This took me up
thiee months: by which time, the wet season
coming on, and the rain keeping me within doors.
I found several occasions to employ myself;
and, while at work, used to divert myself with
talking to my parrot, teaching him to know and
speak his own name Poll, the first welcome word
I ever heard spoken in the island. I had been a
.ong time contriving how to make earthen ves-
sels, which I wanted extremely; and when I
considered the heat of the climate, I did not
doubt but, if I could find any such clay, I might
botch up a pot, strong enough, when dried in the'
sun, to bear handling, and to hold any thing that
was dry, as corn, meal, and other things.
To be short, the clay I found; but it would
occasion the most serious person to smile, to see
what awkward ways I took, and what ugly mis-
shapen things I made; how many either fell out
or cracked by the violent heat of the sun, and
fell in pieces when they were removed, so that I
think it was two months before I could perfect
any thing; and even then but two clumsy things
in imitation of earthen jars. These, however, I
very gently placed in wicker baskets, made on
purpose for them; and between the pot and the
baskets, stuffed it full of rice and barley straw;
and these I presumed would hold my dried corn,
and perhaps the meal, when the corn was bruised.
As for the smaller things, I made them with
better success; such as little round pots, flat
dishes, pitchers, and pipkins, the sun baking
them very hard.
Yet still I wanted one thing absolutely neces-
sary, and that was an earthen pot, not only to
hold my liquid, but also to bear the fire, which
none of these could do. It once happened that
as I was putting out my fire, I found therein a
broken piece of one of my vrssels, burnt hard
as a rock, and red as a tile. This made me think
of burning some pots; and having no notion of
a kiln, or of glazing them with lead, I fixed
three large pipkins, and two or three pots in a
pile one upon another. The fire I piled round
the outside, and dry wood on the top, till I saw
the pots in the inside red hot, aftd found that they
did not crack at all: and when I perceived
them perfectly red, I let them stand in the fire
about five or six hours, till the clay melted by the
extremity of the heat, and would have run to
glass had I suffered it; upon which, I slacked
my fire by degrees, till the redness abated; and
watching them till the morning, I found I had
three very good pipkins, and two earthen pots,
as well burnt and fit for my turn as I could desire.
The first use to which I turned my pipkins
vas to make some salt, which I had long waa'
ed. For this purpose, I filled them with sea-
water, and kept it slowly boiling over the fire,
till the whole of the water had boiled away in
steam, leaving, at the bottom of the vessel, a
thin crust of salt, which I found very good for
giving a relish to my food.
The next concern I had, was to get me a
stone-mortar to beat some corn in, instead of a
mill to grind it. Here, indeed, I was at a great
loss, as not being fit for a stone-cutter; and
many days I spent to find out a great stone big
enough to cut hollow and make fit for a mortar
and strong enough to bear the weight of a pea
tie, that would break the corn without filling
it with sand. But all the stones of the island
being; of a mouldering nature, rendered my
search fruitless; and then I resolved to look
out a great block of hard wood; which having
found, I formed it by my axe and hammer, and
then, with infinite labour, made a hollow in it,
just as the Indians of Brazil make their canoes.
When I had finished this I made a great pestle
of iron-wood, and then laid them up against my
succeeding harvest.
My next business was to make me a sieve, to
sift my meal and part it from the bran and husk.
Having no fine thin canvass to search the meal
through, I could not tell what to do. What linen
I had was reduced to rags; I had goat's hair
enough, but neither tools to work it, nor did I
know how to spin it. At length, I remembered
I had some neck-cloths of calico or muslin of
the sailors, which I had brought out of the ship,
and with these, I made three small sieves proper
enough for the work.
I come now to consider the baking part.
The want of an oven I supplied, by making
some earthen pans very broad, but not deep,
When I had a mind to bake, I made a great fire
upon my hearth, the tiles of which 1 had made
myself, and when the wood was burnt into live
coals, I spread them over it, till it became very
hot; then sweeping them away, I set down my
loaves, and whelming down the earthen pots
upon them, drew the ashes and coals all around
the outsides of the pots to continue the heat;
and in this manner, I baked my barley loaves, as
6*
well as if I had been a complete pastry cook,
and also made of the rice, several cakes and
puddings.
It is no wonder that all these things took me
up the best part of a year, since what inter-
mediate time I had, was bestowed in managing
-my new harvest and husbandry; for in the proper
season, I reaped my corn, carried it home and
laid it up in the ear, in my large baskets, till I
had time to rub, instead of thrashing it. And
now indeed, my corn increased so much, that it
toduccd me twenty bushels of barley, and as
much of rice, that I not only began to use it
freely, but was thinking how to enlarge my barns,
and resolved to sow as much at a time as would
be sufficient for. a whole year:
All this while, the prospect of land, which I
had seen from the other side of the island, ran in
my mind. I still meditated a deliverance from
this place, though the fear of greater misfortunes
might have deterred me from it. For allowing
that I had attained that place, I ran the hazard of
being killed and eaten by the devouring cannibals;
and if they were not so yet 1 might be slain, as
other Europeans had been, who fell into their
hands. Notwithstanding all this, my thoughts
ran continually upon that shore. I now wished
for the long boat with the shoulder of mutton sail.
I went to the ship's boat, that had been cast a
great way on the shore in the late storm. She
was removed but a little; and her bottom being
turned up by the impetuosity and surge of the
waves and wind, I fell to work with all the
strength I had, and with levers and rollers I had
cut from the wood, to turn her, and repair the
damages she had sustaiued. This work took me
up three or four weeks, when finding my litfle
strength all in vain, I fell to undermining it by
digging away the sand, and so to make it fall
down, setting pieces of wood to thrust and guide
it in the fall. But after this was done, I was still
unable to stir it up, or to get under it, much less
to move it forward towards the water an'l so I
was forced to give it over.
This disappointment, however, did not frighten
me. I began to think, whether it was not possible
for me to make a canoe or Perigua, such as the
Jndians make of the trunk of a tree. But here
I lay under particular inconveniences.; want of
tools to make it, and wa,nt of hands ,to move it
into the water when it was made. However, to
work I went upon it, stopping all the enquiries I
could make with this very simple answer I made
to myself, let's first make it, I'll warrant I'll find
some way or other to get it along when it is done.
I first cut down a cedar tree, which was five
feet ten inches diameter at the lower part nex£
the stump, and four feet eleven inches diameter
at the end of .twenty^two feet, after which it
lessened for a space, and then parted into
branches. Twenty days was I hacking and
hewing it at the bottom, fourteen more in cutting
/Off the branches and limbs, and a whole month
in shaping it like the bottom of a boat. As for
the inside, I was three weeks with a mallet and
chissel, clearing it in such a manner, as that it
was big enough to carry 26 men, much bigger
.than any canoe I ever saw in my life, and conse-
quently sufficient to transport me and all my
effects to that wished for shore I so ardently
desired.
Nothing remained now, but indeed the greatest
difficulty, to get it into the water, it lying about
100 yards from it. To remedy the first incon-
venience, which was a rising hill between the
boat and the creek, with wonderful pains and
labour i dug into the surface of the earth, and
made a declivity. But when this was done, all
the strength I had was as insufficient to move it,
as it was when I first made the attempt. I then,
proceeded- to measure the distance of ground,
resolving to make a canal, in order to bring the
water to the canoe, since I could not bring the
canoe to the' water. But as this seemed to be-
impracticable to myself alone under the space of
eleven or twelve years, it brought me into some
sort of consideration-; so that I concluded this
also to be impossible, and the attempt vain. I
now saw, and not before, what stupidity k is to
begin work before we reckon its costs, or judge
rightly our own abilities to go through with its
performance.
In the height of this work my fourth year ex-
pired from the time I was cast on this island.
At this time I did not forget my anniversary:
but kept it with rather greater devotion than be-
fore. For now my hopes being frustrated, I
looked upon this world as a thing I had nothing
to do with; and very well might I say, as father
Abraham said unto Dives, ." between me, and
thee there is a gulph fixed.'' And indeed I was
separated-from its wickedness too, havir.g neither
the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye, nor the
pride of life; I had nothing to covet, being lord,
king and emperor over the whole country I had in
possession, without dispute and without controul:
I had loadings of corn, plenty of turtles, timber in
abundance, and grapes alcove measure. What
was all the rest to me ?, the money I had lay by
me as despicable dross, which I would freely
have given for a gross of tobacco pipes or a
hand-mill to grind my corn: in a word, the
nature and experience of these things dictated to
me this just reflection. That the good things of
this world are no further good to us than as they
are for our use; and that whatever we may heap
up, we can but enjoy as much as we use and no
more.
These thoughts rendered my mind more easy
than usual. Every time I sat down to meat, I did
eat with thankfulness, admiring the providential
hand of God, who, in this wilderness had spread a
table to me. And now I considered what I enjoy,
ed, rather than what I wanted, compared my pre-
sent condition with what Iatfirstexpectedit should
be ; how I should have done, if I had got no-
thing out of the ship; that I must have perished
before I had caught fish or turtles; or lived, had I
found them, like a mere savage, by eating them
raw, and pulling them to pieces with my claws,
like a beast. I next compared my station to
that which I deserved; how undutiful 1 had been
to my parents; how destitute of the fear of
God; how void of every thing that was good;
and how ungrateful for those abundant mercies I
."ad received from heaven, being fed, as it were
by a miracle, even aa great as Elijah's being fed
by ravens; and cast on a place where there are
ho venomous cieatures to poison or devour me;
in short, making God's tender mercies matter of
great consolation, I relinquished all sadness, and
gave way to contentment.
As long as my ink continued, which with wa-
ter I made last as long as I could, I used to mi-
nute down the days of the month on which any
remarkable thing happened.
The next thing that wasted after my ink, was
the biscuit, which I had brought out of the ship;
and though I allowed myself but one cake a
day for about a twelvemonth, yet I was quite out
of bread for nearly a year, before I got any corn
if my own.
In the next place, rriy clothes began to de-
cay, and my linen had been gone long before.
However, I had preserved about three dozen of
the sailor's chequered shirts which proved a great
refreshment to me, when the violent beams of the
sun would not suffer me to bear any of the sea-
men's heavy watch-coats; which made me turn
tailor, and, after a miserable botching manner,
convert them to jackets. To preserve my head,
I made a cap of goatskins, with the hair out-
wards to keep out the rain; which indeed served
me so well, that afterward I made a waistcoat
and open-kaeed breeches of the same: and then
[contrived a sort of umbrella, covering it with
skins, which not only kept out the heat of the
sun, but the rain also. Thus being easy and
Settled in my mind, my chief happiness was to
converse with God, in most heavenly and com-
fortable ejaculations.
For five years after this, I cannot say any ex-
traordinary thing occurred to me. My chief
employment was to cure my raisins, and plant
my barley and rice, of both which I had a year's
provision before-hand. But though I was dis-
appointed in my first canoe, I made it, at inter-
mediate times, my business to make a second of
much inferior size: and it was two years before
I had finished it. But as I perceived it would
in no wise answer my design of sailing to the
other shore, my thoughts were confined to take a
tour round the island, to see what further dis-
coveries I could make. To this intent, after
having moved her to the water, and tried how
she would sail, I fitted up a little mast to my
boat, and made a sail of the ship's sails that lay
by me. I then made lockers or boxes at the
end of it to put in necessaries, provision and
ammunition, which would preserve them dry
either from the rain, or the spray of the sea; and,
in. the inside of the boat, I cut me a long hoilow
place to tay my gun, and to keep it dry, made a
cover for it. My umbrella, I fixed in a step in
the stern, like a mast, to keep the heat of the
sun off me. And now resolving to see the
circumference of my little kingdom, I victualled
my ship for the voyage, putting in two dozen of
my barley bread loaves, an «arthen pot full of
parched rice, a utile Dottle of rum, half a goat,
powder and shot, ana two watch-coats. It was
the sixth of November, in the sixth year of my
reign, or captivity, ti*tt I set out on this voyage;
which was much longer than I expected, being
obliged to put farther out, by reason of the rocks
that lay a great way in the sea.
And indeed; so much did these rocks swrprise
me, that I was for putting back, fearing that if I
entured farther, it would be out of my power
to return: in this uncertamty I came to anchor
just off the shpre, to which I waded with my gun
on my shoulder, and then climbing up a hill,
which over-looked that point, I saw the full ex-
tent of it, and so resolved to run all hazards.
In this prospect from the hill, I perceived a
violent current running to the east, coming very
close to the point; which I the more carefully
observed, thinking it dangerous, and that when I
same to it, I might be driven into the sea by its
lorce, and not able to return to the island: and
certainly it must have been so, had I not made
this observation; for on the other side was a
like current, with this difference, that it set off at
a greater distance; and I perceived there was a
strong eddy under the land; so that my chief
business was to work out of the first current',
and conveniently get jnto the eddy. Two days I
staid here, the wind blowing very briskly east
£outh east, which being contrary to the current;
leaves a great breach of the sea upon the point;
so it was neither fit for me to keep too near the
shore, on account of the breach; nor stand at
too great distance for fear of the streams. That
night the wind abating, it grew so calm, that I
ventured out: and here I may be a monument to
all rash and ignorant pilots; for I was no sooner
come to the point, and not above the boat's
length from shore, but I was got into deep
water, with a current like a mill-race, which drove
my boat along so violently, that it was impossible
for me to keep near the edge of it, for it forced
me more and more out from the eddy to the left
of me; and all I could do with my paddles was
useless, there being no wind to help me.
Now I began to look upon myself as quite
lost, since, as the current ran on both sides of
the island, I was very certain they must join
again, and then I had no hopes but of perishing
for want, in the sea, after what provision I had
was spent, or before, if a storm should happen to
arise.
Who can conceive the present anguish of my
mind at this calamity 1 with longing eyes did I
look upon my little kingdom, and thought the
island the pleasantest place in the universe. Hap-
py, thrice happy desert, said I, shall I never see
thee more 1 Wretched creature! wither am I
going 1 Why did I murmur at my lonesome
condition, when now I would give the whole
wide world to be thither again? While I was
thus complaining, I found myself to be driver!
about two leagues into the sea; however, I la-
boured till my strength was far spent, to keep my
boat as far north as I possibly could, to that side
of the current where the eddy lay. About noon
I perceived a little breeze of wind, spring up front
the south south east, which overjoyed my heart;
and I was still more elated, when in about half
an hour, it blew a gentle fine gale. Had any
thick weather sprung up, I had been lost another
Way: for having no compass on board, I should
7
*T
never have found the way to steer towards the
island, if once it had disappeared; but it proving
the contrary, I set up my mast again, spread rhy
sail and stood away northward, as much as I
could, to get rid of the current. And no sooner
did the boat begin to stretch away, but I perceiv-
ed by the clearness of the water, a change of the
current was near; for, where it was strong, the
water was foul; and where it was clear the Cur-
rent abated.
Those who have been in the like calamities
with my own, may guess my present excess of
joy, how heartily I ran my boat in the stream of
this eddy, and how joyfully I spread my sail to
the refreshing wind, standing cheerfully before it,
with a smart tide under foot. By the assistance
of this eddy, I was carried above a league home
again, when, being in the wake of the island, be-
twixt the two currents, I found the water to be
in a sort of a stand. About four o'clock in the
afternoon, I reached within a league of the island,
- and perceived the points of the rock, which caus
ed this disaster, stretching out, as I observed be
fore, to the southward, which throwing off the
current more southerly, had occasioned another
eddy to the north. But having a fair brisk gale,
I stretched across this eddy, and in an hour came
within a mile of the shore, where I soon landed to
my unspeakable comfort; and after an humble
prostration, thanking God for my deliverance,
with a resolution to lay all thoughts of escaping
aside, I brought ray boat safe to a little cove, and
laid me down to take a welcome repose. When
i awoke, 1 was considering how I might get my
boat home; and coasting along the shore I came
to it good bay, which ran up to a rivulet or brook,-
where, finding a harbour, I stowed her as safe as
if she had been in a dry dock, made on purpose
for her.
I now perceived myself not far from the place,
were before I had travelled on foot: so taking
nothing with me, except my gun and umbrella, I
began my journey, and in the evening came to
my bower, where I again laid me down to rest.
I had not slept long before I awakened in great
surprise, by a strange voice that called me seve-
ral times, "Robin, Robin; Robinson Crusoe;
poor Robin! Where are you, Robinson Crusoe?
Where are you 1 Where have you been?"
So fast was I asleep, that at first I did not
awake thoroughly; but half asleep, and half
awake, I thought I dreamed that some body spoke
tb me. But as the voice repeated, " Robinson
Crusoe," several times, being terribly frightened,
I started up in the utmost confusion; and, no
sooner were my eyes fully open, but I beheld my
pretty poll sitting on the top of the hedge, and
soon knew that it was he that called me; for
just in such bewailing language, I used to talk
and teach him; which he so exactly learned, that
he would sit upon my finger, and lay his bill close
to my face, and cry, " poor Robinson Crusoe,
where are you? where Have you been? how
came you here?" and such like prattle I had con-
stantly taught him. But even though I knew it
to be the parrot, it was a great time before I could
adjust myself: being amazed how the creature
got thither, and that he should fix about that
place, and no where else. But now, being as-
sured it could be no other than my honest" Poll,"
my Wonder ceased, and reaching out my hand,
and calling " Poll," the creature came to me fa-
miliarly, and perched upon my thumb, as he was
wont, constantly prating to me with "poor Ro-
binson Crusoe, and how did I come here, and
where had I been V as if the bird was overjoy-
ed to see me, and so I took him home along with
me. I was now pretty well cured of rambling
to sea; yet I could wish my boat, which had
cost me so much trouble and pains, on this side
the island once more, but this, indeed was im-
practicable. I therefore began to lead a very
retired life, living nearly a twelvemonth in a very
contented manner, wanting for nothing but con-
versation. As to mechanic labours, which my
necessities obliged me to, I fancied I could, upon
occasion, make a tolerable carpenter, were the
poor tools I had to work withal, but good. Be-
sides, as I improved in my earthenware, I con-
trived to make them with a wheel, which I found
much easier and better, making my work
shapely, which before was rude and ugly. But,
I think I never was so much elevated with my
own performance or project as when able to
make a tobacco-pipe, which, though it proved an
awkward clumsy thing, yet it was very sound,
and carried the smoke perfectly well, to my great
satisfaction.
I also improved my wicker ware, made me
abundance of necessary baskets, which, though
not very handsomo, were very handy and conve*
niimt to fetch things home in, as also for holding
my stores, barley, rice, and other provisions.
My powder beginning to fail, made me exar.
mine after what manner I should kill the goats or
birds, to live on, after it was all gone. Upon
which I contrived many ways to ensnare the
goats, and see if I could catch them alive, parti-
cularly a she-goat with young.
At last I had my desire; for, making pit-falls
and traps, baited with barley and rice, I found,
one morning, in one of them, an old he goat, and
in the other, three kids, one male, and two fe-.
males.
So boisterous was the old one,, that I could
not bring him away. But I .orgot the old pro-
verb, " That hunger will tame a lion:" for, had I
kept him three or four days without provisions,
and then given bim some water with a, little corn*
he would have been as tame as a young kid.
The other creatures I bound with strings toge-:
ther; but I had great difficulty, before I could
bring them to my habitation. It was some time
before they would feed; but, throwing them
sweet corn, it so much tempted them, that they
began to be tamer. From hence I concluded,
that if I designed to furnish myself with goat's
flesh, when my ammunition was spent, the tame-:
ly breeding them up, like a flock of sheep about
my settlement, was the only method I could tajte,
I concluded also that I must separate the wild
from the tame, or else they would always runwil4
as they grew up; and the best way for this, was
to have some enclosed piece of ground, well
fenced, cither with a hedge or pale, to keep them
7*
so effectually, that those within might not break
out, nor those without break in. Such an under-
taking was very great for one pair of hands; but
as there was an absolute necessity for doing it,
my first care was to find a cpnvenient piece of
ground, where there was likely to be herbage for
them to eat, water to drink, and cover to keep
them from the sun.
Here again, I gave another instance of my ig-
norance and inexperience, pitching upon a piece
of meadow land so large, that had I enclosed it,
the hedge or pale must have been at least two
miles about. This thought came into my head,
after I had carried it on, I believe, about fifty
yards: I therefore altered my scheme, and re-
solved to enclose a piece of ground about 150
yards in length, and 100 in breadth, large enough
for as many as would maintain me, till such tjme
as my flock increased, and then I could add more
ground. I now vigorously prosecuted my work,
and it took me about three months in hedging
the first piece; in which time I tethered the three
kids in the best part of it; feeding them as near
me as possible, to make them familiar: and, in-
deed, I very often would carry some ears of bar-
ley, or a handfull of rice, and feed them out of
my hand ; by which they grew so tame, that when
my enclosure was finished, and I had let them
loose, they would run after me for a handful of
corn. This indeed answered my end: and in a
year and a half's time, I had a flock of about
twelve goats, kids and all; and in two years af-
ter, they amounted to for.ty^three, besides what f
jhad taken and killed for my sustenance.
After which, I enclosed five several pieces of
ground to feed them in, with pens to drive them
into, that I might take them as I had occasion.
In this project I likewise found additional
blessings; for I not only had plenty of goat's
flesh, but milk too, which in the beginning, I did
not so much as think of. And, indeed, though I
had never milked a cow, much less a goat, or
seen butter or cheese made, yet, after some
essays and miscarriages, I made me both, and
never afterward wanted.
How mercifully can the Almighty comfort his
creatures, even in the midst of their greatest
calamities 1 How can he sweeten the bitterest
evils, and give us reason to magnify him in
dungeons and prisons; what a bounteous table
was here spread in the wilderness for me, where
I expected nothing at first, but to perish for
hunger.
Certainly any one would have smiled to see
me at dinner. There sat my royal majesty, an
absolute prince and ruler of my kingdom, at-
tended by my dutiful subjects, whom if I pleased,
1 could either hang, draw, quarter, give them
liberty, or take it away. When I dined, I seemed
a king, eating alone, none daring to presume to
do so till I had done. Poll as if he had been
my principal court favourite, was the only person
permitted to talk with me. My old but faithful
dog, now grown exceedingly crazy, continually
sat on my right hand; while my two cats sat on
each side of the table, expecting a bit from my hand,
as a principal mark of my royal favour. These
were no;t the cats I had brought frorn tlje ship j
they had been dead long before, and intered near
my habitation by mine own hand. But a couple
of their young I had made tame; the rest ran
wild into the woods, and in time grew so impu-
dent, as to return and plunder me of my stores,
till such time as I shot a great many, and the
rest left me without troubling me any more. In
this plentiful manner did I live, wanting for no-
thing but conversation. One thing indeed con-
cerned me, the want of my boat; I knew not
which way to get her round the island. One
time I resolved tp go along the shore by land to
her; but had any one at home met such a figure,
it would either have affrighted him, or made him
burst into laughter; nay, I could not but smile
myself at my habit, which I think in this place
will be very proper to describe.
The cap I wore upon my head, was great,
high, and shapeless, made of a goat's skin, with a
flap or pent-house hanging down behind, not
only to keep the sun from me, but to shoot the rain
off from running into my neck, nothing being
more pernicious than the rain falling upon the
flesh in these climates. I had a short jacket of
goat's skin, whose hair hung down such a length
on each side, that it reached down to the calves
of my legs. As for shoes and stockings, I had
none, but made a resemblance of something,
I know not what to call them; they were made
like buskins, and laced on the sides like spatter-
dashes, barbarously shaped, like the rest of my
habit. I had a broad belt of goat's skin dried,
girt round me with a couple of thongs, instead of
buckles; on each of which, to supply the defici-
ency of sword and dagger, hung my hatchet and
saw. I had another belt, not so broad, yet fast*
ened in the same manner, which hung over my
shoulder, and at the end of it, under my left arm,
hung two pouches, made of goat's skin, to hold
my powder and shot. My basket I carried on my
back, and my gun on my shoulder; and over my
head a great clumsy ugly goat's skin umbrella,
which however, next to my gun, was the most
necessary thing about me. As for my face, the
colour was not so swarthy as the Mulattoes, or
as might have been expected from one who took
so little care of it, in a climate within nine or ten
degrees of the line. At one time, my beard
grew so long that it hung down above a quarter
of a yard; but as I had both razors and scissors
in store, I cut it all of, and suffered none to grow
except a large pair of Mahometan whiskers, the
like of which I had seen worn by some Turks at
Salee, not long enough indeed to hang a hat upon,
but of such a monstrous size, as would have
amazed any in England to have seen.
But all this was of no consequence here, there
being none to observe my behaviour or habit.
And so, without fear and without control, I pro-
ceeded on my journey, the prosecution of which
took me up five or six days. I travelled along
the sea shore, directly to the place where I first
brought my boat to an anchor, to get upon the
rocks; but now having no boat to take care of,
I went over land, a nearer way to the same height
that I was before upon; wnen looking forward
to the point of the rock, which lay out, and which
I was forced to double with my boat, I was
amazed to see the sea so smooth and quiet, there
being no rippling motion, nor current, any more
than in other places. And now I was convinced
that by observing the ebb and flow of the tide, I
might easily bring my boat round the island
again. But when I began to think of putting it
m practice, the remembrance of the late danger
strbck me with such horror that I took another
resolution, though more laborious; and this was
to make a second canoe* and so have one for one
side of the island, and one for the other.
I had now two plantations in the island; the
first my little fortification, fort, or castle with
many large and spacious improvements, for by
this time I had enlarged the cave behind me with
several little caves, one within an dtheri to hold
my baskets, corn, arid straw. The piles with
which I made my wall were grown so lofty and
great, as obscured my habitation^ And near this
commodious and pleasant settlement, lay my well
cultivated and improved corn fields, which kindly
yielded me their fruit in their proper season. My
second plantation was that near my country seat
or little bower, where my grapes flourished, and
where, having planted my stakes, I made enclo-
sures for my goats, so strongly fortified by labour
and time, that it was much stronger than a wall,
and, consequently, impossible for them to break
through. As for my bower itself, I kept it con-
stantly in repair, and cut the trees in such a man-
ner, as made them grow wild, and form a most
delightful shade* In the centre of this, stood my
tent, thus erected. I had driven four piles in the
ground, spreading over it a piece of the ship's
» --• "v
sail, beneath which, I made me a sort of couch
with the skins of the creatures I had slain, and
other things; and having laid thereon one of the
sailor's blankets, which I had saved from the
wreck of the ship, and covering myself with a
great watch-coat, I took up this place for my
country retreat.
Very frequently, from this settlement did I use
to visit my boat, and keep her in very good order.
And sometimes would I venture in her a cast of
two from shore, but no farther. But now I en*
treat your attention, whilst I proceed to inform
you of a new,' but most surprising scene of life
iwhich here befel me.
You may easily suppose, that, after having
been here so long, nothing could be more amaz-
ing than to see a human creature. One day it
happened, that going to my boat, I saw the print
*(£ a man's naked foot on the shore, very evident
'p'n the sand, as the toes, heels, and every part of
ft. Had I seen a monster of the most frightful
shape, I could not have been more confounded.
My willing ears gave the strictest attention. I
cast my eyes around, but could satisfy neither
the one nor the other, I proceeded alternately to
-every part of the shore, but with equal effect;
neither could I see any other mark though the
sand about it was as susceptible to take impres-
sion as that which was so plainly stamped. Thus
struck with confusion and horror, I returned to
my habitation, frightened at eveiry bush and tree»
taking every thing for men; and possessed with
the wildest idea! That night my eyes never
«losed. T formed nothing but the most dismal
imaginations. In a word, all my religious hopes
vanished, as though I thought God would hot
now protect me by his power, who had wonder-
fully preserved me so long.
What various chains of events are therein tho
life of man! HoW changeable are our affec-
tions, according to different circumstances! We
love to-day, what we hate to-ni'ovrow; We shun
one hour, what we seek the next. This was evi-
dent in me in the most conspicuous rtwnner; for
I, who had so much before lamented my condi-
tion, in being banished from all hurhan kind, was
now ready to expire, when I considered that a
man had set his foot on this desolate island.
But when I considered my station of life, de-
c-reed by the infinitely wise and good providence
of God, that I ought not to dispute my Creator's
sovereignty, who had-an undoubted right to go-
vern and dispose of his creitures as he thmkr
convenient; and that his justice and mercy could
either punish or deliver me, I *.iv, when I consid-
ered all this; I comfortably fviod it my duly to.
bust sincerely in him, pray ai "(vntly to him. ana
humbly resign myself to his divp\i will.
One morning, lying on my t,e.», these words
of the sacred writings came into ,oy wild, " Call
upon me in the day of trouble, nr»i 1 will deliver
thee, and thou shalt glorify me." Uoon this
sentence, rising more cheerfully from my bed, I
offered up my prayers in the most devout man-
ner; and when I had done, taking up my Bible
to read, these words appeared first in my sight,
"Wait on the Lord, and be of good cheer, and
he shall strengthen thy heart: Wait, I say, on
the Lord." Such divine comfort did this give
me, as to remove all cause of sadness upon that
occasion.
Thus, after a world of apprehensions and fears
for three days and nights, I at last ventured out
of my castle, and milked my goats, one of which
was almost spoiled for want of it. I next (though
in great fear,) visited my bower, and milked my
flocks there also; when growing bolder, I went
down to the shore again, and measuring the
print of the foot to mine, to see perhaps whether
I myself had not occasioned that mark, t found
it much superior in largeness: and so returned
home, absolutely convinced, that either some
men had been ashore, or that the island must be
inhabited; and therefore that I might be sur-
prised before I was aware.
I now began to think of providing for my secu-
rity, and resolved in my mind many different
schemes for that purpose. I first proposed to
cut down my enclosures, and turn niy tame cattle
wild into the woods, that the enemy might not
find them, and frequent the island in hopes of
killing the same. Secondly, I was for digging
up my corn-fields for the very same reason.
And, lastly, I concluded to demolish my bower,
lest, seeing a place of human contrivance, they
might come farther, and find out and attack me
in my castle.
Sleep was an litter stranger to my eyes that
bight; yet nature, spent and tired, submitted to
a silent repose the next morning, and then joining
reason with fear, I considered, that this delight-
ful and pleasant island might not be so entirely
8
Forsaken as I might think; but that the inhabi-
tants from the other shore might sail, either with
design or from necessity, by cross winds; and,
tf the latter circumstance, I had reason to believe
they would depart the first opportunity. How-
ever, my fear made me think of a place of re»
treat upon an attack. I now repented that I had
made my door to come out beyond my fortifica-
tion; to remedy which, I resolved to make me a
second one: I fell to work, therefore, and drove
betwixt that double row of trees, which I planted
above twelve years before, several strong piles,
-thickening it with pieces of timber and old cables,
and strenthening the foot of it with earth which I
dug out of my cave; I also made me seven holes,
Wherein I planted my muskets like cannon, fitting
-them into frames resembling carriages. This
being finished with indefatigable industry, for a
Seat way every where, I planted sticks of osiers
;e a wood, about twenty thousand of them,
•leaving a large space between them and my wall,
that I might have room to see an enemy, and that
they might not be sheltered among the young
trees, if they offered to approach the outer wall.
And indeed, scarce two years had passed over
my head, when there appeared a lovely shady
grove, and in six it became a thick wood perfect-
ly impassible. For my safety I left no avenue to
go in or out; instead of which, I set two ladders,
-one to a part of the rock which was low, and then
broke in, leaving room to place another ladder
npon that; so that when I took those down, it
was impossible for any man to descend Without
fcurting himself; and h* they had, they WooW still
be at the outside of my outer wall. But while I
took all the3e measures of human prudence for
my own preservation; I was not altogether un-
mindful of other affairs. To preserve my stock
bf tame goats, that the enemy should not take all
at once, I looked out for the most retired part of
the island, which was the place where I had lost
myself before mentioned, and there finding a
clear piece of land, containing three acres, sur-
rounded with thick woods, I wrought so hard,
that in less than a month's time, I fenced it so
well round; that my flocks were very well secur-
ed in it, and I put thei -sin two he goats, and ten
she ones.
AH this labour was occasioned purely by fear-
ful apprehensions, on account of seeing the print
of a man's foot. And not contented yet with
what I had done, I searched for another place
towards the west part of the island, where I might
also retain another flock. Then wandering on
this errand more to the west of the island than
ever I had yet done, and casting my eyes towards
the sea, methought I perceived a boat at a great
distance; but could not possibly tell what it was
for want of my spy-glass. I considered then, it
was no strange thing to see the print of a man's
foot; and concluding them cannibals, blessed
God for being cast on the other side of the is-
land, where none of the savages, as I thought
ev( r came. But when I came down the hill to
the shore-, which was the south-west point of the
island, I was soon confirmed in my opinion; nor
can any one describe my horror and amazement,
when I saw the ground spread with sculls, hands,
feet, and bones of human bodies; and particu*
larly, I perceived a space like a circle, in the
midst of which had been a fire, about which I
conjectured those wretches sat, and unnaturally
sacrificed and devoured their fellow creatures.
The horror and loathsomeness of this dreadful
spectacle, both confounded my senses, and made
jne discharge from my stomach in an excessive
manner. I then returned towards my habitation;
and in my way thither shedding floods of tears,
and falling down on my bended knees, gave God
tnanks for making my nature contrary to those
wretches, and delivering me so long out of their
hands.
Though reason and my long residence here
had assured me, that the savages never came up
to the thick woody part of the country, and that I
had no reason to be apprehensive of a discovery,
yet such an abhorrence did I still retain, that for
two years after, I confined myself only to my three
plantations ; I mean my castle, country seat, and
enclosure in the woods, though in process of time
my dreadful apprehensions began to wear away.
Thus my circumstances for some time remain-
ed very calm and undisturbed; though indeed,
the terror which the savages had put me in, spoil-
ed some inventions for my own conveniences.
One of my projects was to brew me some beer:
a very whimsical one indeed, when it is consid-
ered, that I had neither casks sufficient, nor
could I make any to preserve it in; neither had
t hops to make it keep, yeast to make it work,
nor a copper or kettle to make it boil. Perhaps,
indeed, after some years, I might bring this to
)ui' i i i'' i
bear, as I had done other things. But now my
inventions were placed another way; and day
and night I could think of nothing but how I
might destroy some of these cannibals, when
proceeding to their bloody entertainments; and
so saving a victim from being sacrificed, that ha
might afterwards become my servant. Many
were my contrivances for this purpose, and many
more objections occurred, after I had hatched
them. I once contrived to dig a hole under the.
place where they made their fire, and put therein,
five or six pounds of gunpowder, which wquld
consequently blow up all those that were near it;
but then I was loth to spend so much upon themv
lest it should not do that certain execution I deT
sired, and only affright and not Hill them. Hav-
ing laid this design aside, I again proposed to,
myself to lie privately in ambush in some conve-
nient place, with my three guns double loaded,
and let fly at them in the midst of their dreadful
ceremony; and having killed two or three of-
them at every shot, fall upon the rest suddenly
with my three pistols, and let not one mother's
son escape. This imagination pleased my fancy
so much that I used to dream of it in the night
time. To put my design in execution I was not
long seeking for a place convenient for my pur-
pose, where unseen I might behold every action
of the savages. Here I placed my two mus-
kets, each of which was loaded with a brace of
slugs, and four or five smaller bullets about the
size of pistol bullets; the fowling piece was
charged with nearly a handful of the largest swan
shot, and in every pistol about four bullets. An4
8*
thus all things being prepared, no sooner did the
welcome light spread over the element, but I
would issue forth from my castle, and from a lofty
hill, three miles distant, try if I could see any
invaders approach unlawfully to my kingdom,
But having waited in vain two or three months,
it grew very tiresome to me.
I new argued with myself, it was better for me
never to attack, but to remain undiscovered as
long as I possibly could; that an opposite con-
duct would certainly prove destructive; for as it
was scarcely to be supposed I could kill them all,
I might be either overpowered by the remainder,
or that some escaping might bring thousands to
my certain destruction. And, indeed, religion
took their part so much as to convince me how
contrary it was to my duty, to be guilty of shed-
ding human blood, innocent blood, innocent as
to me in particular, whatever they are to one ano-
ther; that I had nothing to do with it, but leave
it to the God of all power and dominion, as I said
before, to do therein what seemed convenient ta
his heavenly wisdom. And, therefore, on my
knees I thanked the Almighty for delivering me
from bloody guiltiness, and begged his protec-r
tion that I might never fall into their hands.
Thus giving over an attempt which I had rashly
begun, I never ascended the hill on that occasion
afterward; I only removed my boat, which lay
on the other side of the island, and every thing
that belonged to her, towards the east, into a lit-
tle cove, that there might not be the least shadow
of any boat near, or habitation upon the island.
My castle then became tny c.ell, keeping always
retired in it, except when I went out to milk my
she-goats, or my little flock in the wood, which
was quite out of danger: for sure I was, that
these savages never came here with cxpectatiori
to nnd any thing, and consequently never wander-
ed from the coast; however, as they might have
several times been on shore, as well before as after
my dreadful apprehensionsj looked back with hor-
ror to think in what state I might have been, had
I suddenly met them, slenderly armed, with one
gun only loaded'with small shot; and h»w great
would have been my amazement, if, instead of
seeing the print of one man's foot, I had per-
ceived fifteen or twenty savages, who, having
once set Jheir eyes upon me, by the swiftness of
their feet, would have left' me no possibility of
escaping? These thoughts would sink my very
soul, so that I would fall into a deep melancholy,
till such time as the consideration of my gratitude
to the divine Being moved it from my heart. I
then fell into a contemplation of the secret
springs of Providence; and how wonderfully we
are delivered, when insensible of it; and when
in uncertain mazes or labyrinths of doubt or he-
sitation, what secret hint directs us, in the right
way when we intended to go out of it; nay per-
haps contrary to our business, sense, or inclina-
tion.
Anxieties of mind, and the care of my preser-
vation, put a period to all future inventions and
contrivances, either for accommodation, or con-
venience, I now cared not to drive a nail, chop a
stick, fire a gun, or make a fire, lest either the
noise should be heard, or the smoke discover
me. And on this account I used to burn my
earthen ware privately in a cave, which I found
in the wood, and which I made convenieut for
that purpose; the principal cause that brought
me here was to make charcoal, so that I might
bake and dress my bread and meat without any
danger.
At that time a curious accident happened to
me, which I shall now relate.
While I was cutting down some wood for
making my charcoal, I perceived a cavity behind
a very thick branch of underwood. Curious to
look into it, I attained its mouth, and perceived
it sufficient for me to stand upright in.
But when I had entered, having crept upon my
hands and feet through this strait, I found the roof
higher up, I think about twenty feet. But surely
never mortal saw such a glorious sight before!
the roof and walls of this cave reflected a hun-
dred thousand lights to me from my two candles,
as though they were indented with shining gold,
precious stones, or sparkling diamonds. And
indeed it was the most delightful cavity or grotto
of its kind that could be desired, though entirely
dark. The floor was dry and level, and had a
kind of gravel upon it; no nauseous venemous
creatures to be seen here, neither any damp or
wet about it. I could find no fault but in the
entrance, and I began to think, that even this
might be very necessary for my defence, and
therefore resolved to make it my principal maga-
zine. I brought hither two fowling pieces and
three muskets, leaving only five pieces at my
castle, planted in the nature of cannon. In a
barrel of gunpowder, which I took out of the sea,
I brought away about sixty pounds of good pow-
der, which was not damaged; and this, with a
great quantity of lead for bullets, I removed from
my castle to this retreat, now fortified both by
art and nature.
I fancied myself now like one of the giants
of old, who were said to live in caves and holes
among the rocks, inaccessible to any but them-
selves, or, at least, most dangerous to attempt.
And now I defied both the cunning and strength
of the savages, either to find me out or to hurt
me.
I think I was now in the twenty-third year of
my reign, and my thoughts much easier than
formerly, having contrived several pretty amuse-
ments, and diversions to pass away the time in
a pleasant manner. By this time my pretty Poll
had learned to speak English, and pronounce his
words very articulately and plain; so that for
many hours we used to chat together after a very
familiar manner, and he lived no less than twenty-
six years. My dog which was nineteen years
old, sixteen of which he lived with me, died some
time ago, of mere old age. As for my cats,
they multiplied so fast, that I was forced to kill
or drive them into the woods, except two or three
which became my particular favourites. Be-
sides these, I continually kept two or three house-
hold kids about me, which I taught to feed out of
my hand, and two more parrots which could talk
indifferently, and call Robinson Crusoe, but not
so excellently as the first, by my not taking so
much pains with them. I had also several sea
94 LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF .. ,.

fowls which I had wounded and cut their wings;
and growing tame they used to breed among the
low trees about my castle walls, all of which made
my abode very agreeable.
, But what unforeseen events suddenly destroy
the enjoyments of this uncertain state of life,
when we least expect them! It was now the
month of December, ajid the particular time in
my harvest, which required my attendance in the
fields; when going out pretty early in the mor-
ning, before it was day-light, there appeared to
me from the sea-shore, a flaming light, about two
miles from me at the east end of the island,
where I had observed, some savages had been,
before, not on the oth;er side, but to my great
affliction it was on my side of the island.
Struck with a terrible surprise, and my usual
apprehensions, that the savages would perceive
my improvements, I returned directly to my
castle, pulled the ladder after me, making all
things look as wild and natural as I possibly
could. In the next place, I put myself in a pos-
ture of defence, loaded my muskets and pistols,
and committing myself to God's protection, I
resolved to defend myself till my last breath.
Two hours after, impatient for intelligence, I set
my ladder up to the.side of the hill, where there
was a flat place, and then pulling the ladder after
me, ascending to the top, where laying myself
on my belly, with my perspective glass I per-
ceived no less than nine naked savages, sitting
round a small fire, eating as I supposed, human
jjlesh, with their two canoes hauled on shore,
waiting for the flood to carry them off again.
ROBINSON CftlTtOf. 96
The consternation I was in at this sight, espe-
cially seeing them near me, was very great; but
when I perceived their coming must be always
with the current of the ebb, I became more easy
in my thoughts, being fully convinced, that I
might go abroad with security all the time of
flood, if they were not before landed. And, in-
deed, this proved just as I imagined; for no
sooner did they all take boat and paddle away,
but the tide made north-west. When I saw them
gone, I took two guns upon my shoulders, and
placing a couple of pistols in my belt, with my
great sword hanging by my side, I went to the
hill, where at first I made a discovery of these
cannibals, and then saw there had been three ca-
noes more of the savages on shore at that place,
which with the rest, were making over to the
main land.
But nothing could be more horrid to me, when
going to the place of sacrifice, the blood, the
bones, and other mangled parts of human bodies
appeared in my sight; and so fired was I with
indignation, that I was fully resolved to be re-
venged on the first that came there, though I lost
my life in the execution. It then appeared to
me, that the visits which they make to this island
are not very frequent, it being fifteen months
before they came again: but still I was very
uneasy, by reason of the dismal apprehensions
of their surprising me unawares; nor dared I
offer to fire a gun on that side of the island where
they used to appear, le?t, taking the alarm, they
might return with many hundred canoes, and then
God only knows in what manner I should'
made my end. Thus was I a year or more
before I saw any of these devouring cannibals
again.
But to wave this, the following accident, which
demands attention, for a while, eluded the force
jpf my thoughts in revengmg myself on those
heathens. .
t On the 16th of May (according to my wooden
.calendar,) the wind blew exceedingly hard, ac-
companied with abundance., of thunder and light-
ning all day, and succeeded by a very stormy
night. The seeming anger, of the heavens made
me have recourse to my Bible. Whilst I; was
.seriously pondering . upon it, I was suddenly
alarmed with the noise of a gun, which I con-
jectured was fired upon the ocean. Such an un-
usual surprise made me .start up in a minute;
when, with my ladder, ascending the mountain
as before, that very moment a flash of fire pre-
saged the report of another gun, whichl presently
heard, and found it„was from the part of the sea
where the current drove me away, I could not
but then think, that this must be a ship in distress,
and that these were the melancholy signals for a
speedy deliverance. i Great, indeed, was my sor
row upon this occasion; but my labours to assist
them must have proved altogether vain and fruit-
less. However, I brought together all the dry
wood that was at hand, and making a pretty large
,pile, set it on nre on tho hill. I was certain they
.plainly perceived it, by their firing another gun
kas soon as it began to blaze, and after that seve-
ral more from the same quarter. All night long
I kept up my fire; and when the air cleared u'ji,
(*' '>
1 perceived something a great way at sea, directly
east, but could not distinguish what it was, even
with my glass, the weather being so very foggy
out at sea. However, keeping my eyes directly
fixed upon it, and perceiving it did not stir, I
presently concluded it must be a ship at anchor,
and so very hasty was I to be satisfied, that,
taking my gun, I went to the south-west part of
the island, to the same rocks where I had been
formerly driven away by the current; in which
time, the weather being perfectly cleared up, to
my great sorrow, I perceived the wreck of a ship
cast away upon those hidden rocks I had found
when, I was out with my boat; and which, by
making a kind of an eddy, were the occasion of
my preservation.;
When I considered seriously every thing con-
cerning this wreck, and could perceive no room
to suppose any of them saved, I cannot explain,
by any possible force of words, what longings
my so'il felt on this occasion, often breaking out
m this manner. Oh! that there had been but
two or three, nay, even one person saved, that
we might have lived together, conversed with,
and comforted one another! and so much were
my desires moved, that when I repeated these
words, "oh! that there had been but one !" my
hands would so clench together, and my fingers
press the palms of my hands so close, that, had
any soft thing been between, they would have
crushed it, while my teeth would strike together,
and set against each other so strong, that it re-
quired some tine for me to part them.
Till the last year of my being on this islanfi,
9
I never knew whether or not any had been saved
out of this ship. I had the affliction, some time
after, to see the corpse of a drowned boy come
on shore, at the end of the island which was next
the shipwreck; there was nothing on him but a
seaman's waistcoat, a pair of open-kneed linen
drawers, and a blue linen shirt, but no particular
mark to guess what nation he was of. In his
pocket were two pieces of eight, and a tobacco
pipe, the last of which I preferred much more
than I did the first. And now the calmness ot
the sea tempted me to venture out in my boat to
this wreck, not only to get something necessary
out of the ship, but perhaps, some living creature
might be on board, whose life I might preserve.
This had such an influence upon my mind, that
immediately I went home, and prepared every
thing necessary for the voyage, carrying on board
my boat, provisions of all sorts, with a good
quantity of rum, fresh water, and a compass:
so putting off, I paddled the canoe along the
shore, till I came to the north-east part of the
island, from whence I was to launch into the
ocean; but here the current ran so violently, and
appeared so terrible, that my heart began to fail
me; foreseeing, that if I was driven into any of
these currents, I might be carried not only out
of the reach or sight of the island, but even
inevitably lost in the boiling surges of the ocean.
So oppressed was I at these troubles, that I
gave over my enterprize, sailing to a little creek
on the shore, where, stepping out, I sat me down
on a rising hill, very pensive and thoughtful.
I then perceived iiat fee tide was turned, and
(he flood come on, which made it impracticable
for me to go out for so many hours.
That night, I reposed myself in my canoe,'
covered with my watch-coat instead of a blan-
ket, the heavens being my tester. I set out with
the first of the tide full north, till I felt the bene-
fit of the current, which carried me at a great
rate eastward, yet not with such impetuosity as
before, as to take from me all government of my
canoe: so that in two hours I came up to the
wreck, which appeared to me a most melancholy
sight. It seemed to be a Spanish vessel by its
building, stuck fast between two rocks; her stern
and quarters beaten to pieces by the sea; her
main-mast and foremast were brought oft' by the
board; that is, broken short off". As I ap-
proached nearer, I perceived a dog on board,
who, seeing me coming, yelped and cried: and
no sooner did I call him, but the poor creature
jumped into the seal out of which I took him up
almost famished with hunger and thirst: so that
when I gave him a cake of bread, no ravenous
wolf could devour it more greedily; and he
drank to that degree of fresh water, that he would
have burst himself had I suffered him.
The first sight I .met with in the ship, were
two men drowned in the cock-rooiri, or forecastle,
enclosed in one another's arms: hence I very
probably supposed, that when the vessel struck
m the storm, so high and incessantly did the
waters break in and over her, that the men not
being able to bear itj were strangled by the con-
stant rushing of the waves. There were sevep
ml casks of liquor', whether wine or brandy 1
could not be positive, which lay in the lower hold,
as were plainly perceptible by the ebbing out of
the water, yet were too large for me to pretend
to meddle with: likewise I perceived several
chests, whic\ I supposed belonged to the seamen,
two of whic'l I got into my boat, without ex-
amining what Vas in them. What became of
the sailors I c\ Hid not certainly tell; and all her
riches signified lothing at that time to any body.
Searching farmer, I found a cask, containing
about twenty gallons full of liquor, which with
some labour I got into my boat; in the cabin
were several muskets, which I let remain there;
but took away with me a great powder horn, with
about four pounds of powder in it. I took also
a fire-shovel and tongs, with two brass kettles, a
copper pot to make chocolate, and a grid-iron;
all which were extremely necessary to me,
especially the fire-shovel and tongs. And so
with this cargo, accompanied by my dog, I came
away, the tide serving for that purpose: and the
same evening, about an hour within night, I at-
tained the island, after the greatest toil and fa-
tigue imaginable.
That night I reposed my weary limbs in the
boat, resolving the next morning to harbour what
I had gotten, in my new found under ground grot-
to; and not carry my cargo home to my ancient
castle. Having refreshed myself, and got all
my efFects on shore, I next proceeded to examine
the particulars; and so tapping the cask, I foun/
the liquor to be a kind of rum, but not like wha.
we had at the Brazils, nor indeed near so good.
At the opening of the chest, several things ap-
peared very useful to me; for instance, I found
in one, a very fine case of bottles, containing the
finest and best sort of cordial waters; each
bottle held about three pints, curiously tipt with
silver. I found also two pots full of the choicest
sweetmeats, and two more which the water had
utterly spoiled. There were likewise several
good shirts, exceedingly welcome to me, and
about one dozen and a half of white linen hand-
kerchiefs, and coloured neckcloths, the former of
which were absolutely necessary for wiping my
face in a hot day; and in the till, I found three
bags of money, in one of which, decently wrapt
up in a piece of paper, were six doubloons of
gold, and some small bars and wedges of the
same metal, which I believe might weigh near a
pound. In the other chest, I only found some
cloths of very little, value, and about two pounds
of fine glazed powder, in three flasks, kept as I
believe, for charging their fowling pieces on any
occasion, so that, on the whole I made very little
of this voyage. The money was indeed as
mere dirt to me, useless and unprofitable, all,
which I would have freely parted with, for two
or three pair of English shoes and stockings,
things that for many years I had not worn except,
those which I had lately taken off" the feet of the
unfortunate men I found drowned in the wreck,
yet not so good as English shoes either for ease
or service. I found no gold in the second chest;
so concluded that what I took from the first be-
longed to an officer, the latter appearing to have
a much inferior person for its owner. However,
as despicable as the money seemed, I likewise
9*
Jugged it to my cave, laving it up securely, as I
did the rest of my cargo, and intending to seek
out, and return it to the family of the unfortunate
owner, if ever I should return to Europe; and
after I had done all this, I returned back to my boat
rowing or paddling her along till I came to my
old harbour, where I carefully laid her up, and
so made the best of my way to my castle.
When I arrived there, every thing seemed safe
and quiet; so that now, my only business was to
repose myself after my wonted manner, and take
care of my domestic affairs. But though I
might have lived very easy, as wanting for no-
thing absolutely needful; yet still I was more
vigilant than usual, upon account of the savages,
never going much abroad; or if I did, it was td
the east part of the island, where I was well as-
sured that the savages never came, and where I
might not be troubled to carry such a heavy load
of weapons for my defence, as I was obliged to
do if I went the other way.
Two years did I live in this anxious condition,
in all which time, contrary to my former re-
solutions, my head was fijled with nothing but
projects and designs how I might esape from this
-island; and so much were my wanderingthoughts
tent upon a rambling disposition, that had I had
the same boat that I went from Salee in, I should
have ventured once more to the uncertainty of
.the raging ocean.
Having retired to my castle, after my late
voyage to the ship, my frigate laid up and secured,
as usual, and my condition the same as before',
except being richer, though I had as little o<£
casion for riches as the Indians of Peru had for
gold, before the cruel Spaniards came among
them; one night in March, being the rainy season,
in the four and twentieth year of my solitude, 1 lay
down to sleep, very well in health, without dis-
temper, pain, or uncommon uneasiness either of
body or mind; yet notwithstanding, I could not
compose myself to sleep ali the night long. All
this tedious while, it is impossible to express what
innumerable thoughts came into my head. I
traced quite over, the whole history of my life in
miniature, from my utmost remembrance of
things till I came to this island; and then pro-
ceeded to examine every action and passage thai
had occurred since I had taken possession of
my kingdom. In my reflections upon the latter,
I was comparing the happy posture of my affairs
in the beginning of my reign, to this life of
anxiety, fear, and concern, since I had discovered
the print of a foot in the sand; that while I con-
tinued without apprehension, I was incapable of
feeling the dread and .terror I now suffered.
Mow thankful rather ought I to have been for the
knowledge of my danger, since the greatest hap-
piness a man can be possessed of is to have
sufficient time to provide against it? How stu-
pendous is the goodness of Providence, whicl
sets such narrow bounds to the sight and know
ledge of human nature, that while men walk in
the midst of 90 many dangers, they are kept
serene and calm, by having ,the events of things
hid from their eyes, and knowing nothing of
those many dangers that surround them, till per
haps they are dissipated and vanished away.
104 LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF
About a year and half after, one morning
early, I was very much surprised by seeing no
less than five canoes all on shore together, on
my side of the island, and the savages that be-
longed to them all landed, and out of my sight.
Upon which, much dispirited and perplexed, I
lay still in my castle; which, however, I put ii.
a proper posture for an attack; and having for-
merly provided all that was necessary, was soon
ready to enter upon an engagement, should they
attempt it. Having waited for some time, my
impatient temper would let me bear it no longer;
I set my guns at the foot of my ladder, and, as
usual, ascended up to the top of the hill at two
stages, standing, however, in such a manner, that
my head did not appear above the hill, so that
they could not easily perceive me: and here, by
the assistance of my perspective glass, I ob-
served no less than thirty in number around a
fire, feasting upon what meat they had dressed:
how they cooked it, or what it was, I could not
then perfectly tell; but they were all dancing
and capering about the flames, using many fright-
ful and barbarous gestures.
But while, with a curious eye, I was behold-
ing these wretches, my spirits sunk within me,
when I perceived fhem drag two miserable crea-
tures from the boats, to act afresh the dreadful
tragedy, as I supposed they had done before.
It was not long before one of them fell upon the
ground, knocked down as I suppose, with a club
or wooden sword, for that was their manner;
while two or three others went immediately to
work, cutting him open for their cookery, and
then fell to devour him as they had done the for-
mer: while the last unhappy captive was left by
himself, till such time as they were ready for him.
The poor creature looked round him with a sor-
rowful eye, trembling at the thoughts of death;
yet seeing himself a little at liberty, nature, that
very moment, as it were, inspired him with hopes
of life: he started away from them, and ran, with
incredible swiftness, along the sands, directly to
that part of the coast where my ancient and ve-
nerable castle stood.
You may well imagine I was dreadfully af-
frighted upon this occasion, when as I thought,
they pursued him in a whole body, all running to-
wards my palace. And now, indeed, I expected
that he would certainly fly to my grove for pro-
tection. However, my spirits beginning to re-
cover, I still kept upon my guard; and I now
plainly perceived, there were but three men out
of the number that pursued him. I was infinitely
pleased at the swiftness with which the poor
creature ran fiom his pursuers, gaining so much
ground upon them, that I plainly perceived, could
he thus hoid it out for half an hour, there was
not the least doubt but he would save his life from
the power of his enemies.
Between them and my castle, there was a
creek, the very same which I sailed into with all
my effects from the wreck of the ship, on the steep
banks of which, I very much feared the poor
victim would be taken, if he could not swim for
his escape: but soon was I out of pain for him,
when I perceived he made nothing of it, though
at full tide, but with an intrepid courage, spurn, d
—— »
on by the sense of danger, he plunged into the
flood, swimming over in about thirty strokes,
and then landing, ran with the same incredible
strength and swiftness as before. When the
three pursuers came to the creek, two of them,
who I perceived could not swim, happily for
themselves," returned to their company, while the
other, with an equal courage but much less swift-
ness attained the other side, as though he was
resolved never to give over the pursuit. And
now or never, I thought, was the time for me to
procure me a servant, companion, or assistant,
and that I was decreed by Providence to be the
instrument to save this poor creature's life. I
immediately descended my two ladders with the
greatest expedition; I took up my two guns,
which,! said before, were at the bottom of them;
a.nd getting up again with the same haste to-
wards ,the hill, I made nearer the sea. In a
word, taking a short cut down the hill, I inter-
posed between the pursuer and pursued, hal-
looing aloud to the latter, who venturing to look
back, was no doubt, as much terrified at me as
at the enemy from whom he fled. I beckoned
to him, with my hand, to return back, and, in the
mean time, advanced towards the pursuer. I
was very unwilling to fire lest the rest should hear,
though, at that distance, I questioned whether they
could or no; and being out of sight of the smoke,
they could not easily have known what to make of
it. The savage stopped as if he had been amazed;
wl)sn, advacing towards him, I cpuld perceive,
tjira take his bow from his back, and. after fixing
in a> row to it, preparing to shoot at me, and, with-
out dispute, he might have lodged it in my breast;
but in this absolutely necessary case of self-
preservation, I immediately fired, and shot him
dead, just as his hand was going to draw the fatal
string. All this while, the savage, who had fled
before, stood still, and had the satisfaction to see
his enemy killed, as he thought, who designed to
take away his life; so affrighted was he with the
fire and noise of my piece, that he stood as it
were like Lot's wife, fixed and immoveable with-
out either sense or motion. This obliged me to
halloo to him again, making the plainest signs I
could to him to draw nearer. I perceived he
understood these tokens, by his approaching to
me a little way when as if afraid I should kill
him too, he stopped again. Several times did he
advance, and as often stop in this mannei, till,
coming more to my view, I perceived him trem-
bling, as if he was to undergo the same fate.
Upon which I looked upon him with a smiling
countenance, and' still beckoning to him; at
length he came close to me, and kneeled down,
kissed the ground, laid his head upon it, and
taking me by the foot, set it upon his head;
which, as I understood afterwards, was a token of
swearing to be my slave for ever. I took him
up, and making much of him, encouraged him in
the best manner I could. The greatest asto-
nishment that my new servant conceived, was
at the manner of killing the savage at such a
distance, without a bow and arrow; and such
was his longing desire to know it, that he first
pointed to the dead carcase, and then made signs
to me to grant him leave to go to it Upon
which I bid him go, and, as well as I could,
made him sensible I granted his request. But
when he came there how wonderfully was he
struck with amazement! First, he turned it oh
one side, then on another, wondering he could
perceive no quantity of blood, he bleeding in-
wardly: and after sufficiently admiring the
wound the bullet had made in the breast, he took
up his bow and arrows, and came back again;
upon which, I turned to go away, making signs
to him to follow, lest the rest missing their com-
panion, might r'3e in pursuit of him, and this 1
Found he :mdirstood very well, by making me to
understand that his design was to bury it, that it
might not be seen; and which by signs again 1
made him sensible I very much approved of.
Immediately he fell to work, and never was grave-
digger more dexterous in the world than he was;
for in an ins'ant, as I might say, he scraped a
large hole in the sands with his hands, sufficient
to bury it in; there he dragged it, and, without
any ceremony, covered it over. I then called
him away, and instead of carrying him directly to
my castle at first, I conveyed him to my cave
on the farther part of the island.
Weary and faint, hungry and thirs'Vl undoubt-
edly must this poor creature be, supported chiefly
by the vivacity of spirit, and uncommon trans-
ports of joy that his deliverance occasioned.
Here I gave him bread and a bunch of raisins to
oat, and water to drink, on which he fed very
cheerfully, to his exceeding refreshment. I theh
made him a convenient bed, with a parcel of rice
straw, and a blanket upon it, (a bed which I used
J
myself sometimes,) and then pointing to it, made
signs for him to lie down to sleep, upon which
the poor creature went to take a welcome re-
pose.
Indeed he was a very comely, handsome,
young fellow, extremely well made, with straight
long limbs, not too large, but tall and well shaped,
artd, as near as I could reckon, about twenty-six
years of age. His countenance had nothing in
it fierce or surly, but rather a sort of majesty
in his face; and especially when he smiled, he
had all the sweetness of a European. His hair
was not ciirled like wool, as many of the blacks
are, but long and black, with the most beautiful,
yet careless tresses spreading over his shoulders.
He had a very high and large forehead, with a
great vivacity and sparkling sharpness in his
eyes. His skin was not so tawny as that of the
Americans; but rather of a light dun olive
colour, that had something agreeable in it, though
not very easy to give a description of. His face
was round and plump, with a small nose, very
different from the flatness of the negroes, a pretty
small mouth, thin lips, fine teeth, very well set,
and white as the driven snow. In a word, such
handsome features, and exact symmetry in every
part, made me consider, that I had saved the life
of an Indian prince, no less graceful and accom-
plished than the great Oroonoke, whose memo-
rable behaviour and unhappy contingencies of
life, have charmed the world, both to admiration
of his person, and compassion for his sufferings.
He had not, I think; slept above an hour, when
he awaked again, and while I was milking my
10
goats hard by, out he runs from the cave towards
me in my enclosure, and laying himself down on
the ground in the lowest prostration, made all the
antic gestures imaginable, to express his thank-
fulness to me for being his deliverer. He laid
down his head again upon the ground, close to
my foot, and set my other foot upon his head, as
he had done before, making all the signs of sub-
jection, servitude, and submission imaginable, to
let me understand he would serve me as long as
his life endured. As I understood him in many
things, I made him sensible I was very well
pleased with him; and, in a little time, I began
to speak to him, and teach him how to talk to me
again.
In the first place, I made him understand his
name was to be Friday, because it was upon that
day I saved his life; I then taught him to say
Master, which I made him sensible was to be my
name; I likewise taught him to say yes and no,
and to know what they meant. I gave him some
milk in an earthen pot, making him view me
while I drank it before him, and soaked my bread
in it; I gave him a cake of bread, and caused
him to soak it likewise, to which he readily con-
sented, making signs of the greatest satisfaction
imaginable.
All that night did I keep him there; but no
sooner did the morning light appear, than 1 order-
ed him to arise and come along with me, with cer-
tain tokens that I would give him some clothes
like mine, at which he seemed very glad, being
stark naked, without the least covering whatever.
As we passed by the place where the man had
been interred, my man pointed directly to his
grave, showing me the marks that he had made
to find it again, giving me to understand, by
signs, that we should dig him up and devour him.
At this I appeared extremely displeased, express-
ed my utmost abhorrence, as if I would vomit at
the apprehensions of it, beckoning with my hand
to come away, which he did with the greatest
reverence and submission. After this, I con-
ducted him to the top of the hill, to view if the
rest of the savages were yet remaining there;
but when I looked through my perspective glass,
I could see no appearance of them, nor of their
canoes; so that it was very evident they never
minded their deceased companion whom we had
slain; which if they had, they would surely have
searched for or left one boat behind for him to
follow, after he returned from his pursuit.
Curiosity, and a desire of satisfaction, anima-
ting me with courage, to see this scene of barba-
rity, I took my man Friday with me to the place
of their bloody entertainment. But when I came
there, I was struck with the utmost horror at so
dreadful a spectacle, whilst Friday was no way
concerned about it, being no doubt in his turn,
one of these devourers. Here lay several human
bones, there several pieces of mangled flesh,
half eaten, mangled and scorched, whilst streams
of blood ran promiscuously as water from a
fountain. As I was musing on this dreadful
sight, Friday took all the pains he could by par-
ticular signs, to make me understand that they
had brought over four prisQners to feast upont
three of whom they had eaten up, and that he
was the fourth, pointing to himself: that there
having been a bloody battle between them and
his great king, in the just defence of whom he
was taken prisoner, with many others; all of
these were carried off to different places to be
devoured by their conquerors; and that it was
his fortune to be brought hither by these wretches
for the very same purpose.
After I was made sensible of these things, I
caused Friday to gather those "horrid remains,
and lay them together upon a heap, which I
ordered to be set on fire, and burnt them to
fishes; my man, however, still retained the na-
ture of a cannibal, having a hankering stomach
after some of the flesh: but such an extreme
.abhorrence did I express at the least appearance
.of it, that he durst not but conceal it; for I made
him very sensible, that if he attempted any such
thing, I would certainly shoot him.
This being done, I carried my man with me to
my castle, and gave him a pair of linen drawers,
which I had taken out of the poor gunner's chest
before mentioned; and which, with a little altera-
tion, fitted him very well: in the next place, I
made him a jerkin of goat skin, such as my skill
was able to manage, and indeed I thought myself
then a tolerably good tailor. I gave him also a
cap, which I made of a hare's skin, very conve-
nient and fashionable. Thus being clothed to-
lerably well, my man was no less proud of his
habit than I was at seeing him in it. Indeed he
went very awkwardly at first, but by use, at length
he took to them very well.
My next concern was, where I should lodge
- '* —
him; and that I might do well by him, and yet
be perfectly easy myself, I erected a tent for
him in the vacant place between my two fortifi-
cations, in the inside of the last, and the outside
of the first; and as there was an entrance or
door into my cave, I made a formal framed door-
case, and a door to open on the inside; J barred
it up jn the night-time, taking in my ladders Joo,
so that, was my man to prove treacherpus, there
could be no way to come at me in the inside of
my innermost wall, without making so much
noise in getting over, that it must needs wakei)
me; for my first wall had now a complete roof
over it of long poles, spreading oyer my tent,
and leaning up to the side of the mountain, which
was again laid across with smaller sticks instead
of laths, and thatched over to a great thickness
with the rice straw, which was as strong as reeds;
and at the hole of the place, left on purpose to
go in or out by the ladder, I had placed a kind of
a trap-door, which, if i). had beep attempted on
the outside, would nof have opened at ajl, but
have fallen down, and made a great noise; and
as to my weapons, every night I took fhem all to
my bed-side.
But there was no opcasipn for this precaution;
for surely never Master had a more sincere,
faithful and loving servant than Friday proved to
me. Without passion, sullenness, or design,
perfectly obliging afld engaging, his affections
were as much tied to me as those of a child to
bis parents; and I might venture to say, he
would have sacrificed his life for the saving of
mine, upon any occasion whatsoever, and, in-
10*
deed, the many testimonies he gave me of this,
sufficiently convinced me that I had no occasion
to use all these precautions.
I had not been above two or three days returned
to my castle, but my chief design was, how I
should bring Friday off from his horrid way of
feeding; and, to take from him that inhuman
relish he by habit had been accustomed to, 1
thought it my duty to let him taste other flesh,
which might the rather tempt him to the same
abhorrence I so often expressed against their
accursed way of living. Upon which, one morn-
ing, I took him out with me, with an intention to
kill a kid out of the flock, and bring it home,
and dress it. As I was going, I perceived a she
goat lying down in the shade, and two young kids
sitting by her. Immediately I catched hold of my
man Friday, and bidding him stand still, and not
stir, I presented my piece, and shot one of tht kids.
My poor servant, who had at a distance perceived
me kill his adversary, and yet did not know by
what means, or how it was done, stood trembling
and surprised, and looked so amazed, that I
thought he would have sunk into the earth. He
did net see the kid I aimed at, or behold I had
Mtled it, but ripped up his waistcoat to see if he
"vas not wounded, thinking my resolution was to
WW him; for coming to me, he fell on his knees
earnestly pronouncing many things which 1 did
not understand the meaning of; which at length
i perceived was, that I would not take awuy his
life. Indeed, so much compassion had I for this
sreature, that it was with difficulty I refiained
from t«,,.T3. \5ut, however, as another sort of
countenance was necessary, and to convince him
that I would do him no harm, I took him, smiling,
by the hand, then laughed at him, and pointing to
the kid which I had slain, made signs to him to
fetch it, which accordingly he did. No less cu-
rious was he in viewing how the creature was
killed, than he was before in beholding the In-
dian; which, while he was admiring, I charged
my gun again, and presently perceived a great
fowl like a hawk, perching upon a tree within
shot; and, therefore, to let Friday understand
what I was going to do, I called him to me again,
pointing at the fowl, which I found to be a parrot.
I made him understand that I would shoot and
kill that bird; accordingly I fired, and bade him
look, when immediately he saw the parrot fall
down. Again he stood like one amazed, not-
withstanding all I had said to him: and the more
confounded he was, because he did not perceive
me put any thing in my gun. As for it in par-
ticular, he would not so much as touch it for
several days after; but would come and com-
municate his thoughts to it, and talk to it, as if
the senseless piece had understood and answered
him; all this I could perceive him to do, when
he thought my back was turned, the chief intent
of which was, to desire it not to kill him, as I
afterward came to understand.
I never strove to prevent his admiration, nor
hinder him from these comical gestures he used
on such occasions; but when hi* astonishment
was a little over, I made tokens to him to run
and fetch the parrot that I had shot; which ac-
cordingly ho did, staying somo time longer than
Usual, by reason that the bird not being quite
dead, had fluttered some way farther from the
place where she fell. In the mean time, as he
was looking for her, I took the advantage of
charging my gun again, that so I might be ready
for any other mark that offered; but nothing
more occurred at the time. So I brought home
the kid, and the same evening too'*!; oft" the skin,
and divided the carcase as weil as'1 could. Part
of the flesh I stewed and boiled in a po't I had for
this purpose. And then, spreading my table, I
sat down, giving my man some of it to cat, who
was wonderfully pleased, and seemed to like it
x ery well: but what was the most surprising to
him was to see me eat salt with t: upon which
he made me understand, that the salt was very
bad for me; when putting a little into his mouth,
he seemed to nauseate it in such a manner, as to
spit and sputter at it, and then washed his mouth
with fresh water: but to show him how contrary
iii? opinion was to mine, I put some meat into
\ny mouth without salt, and feigned to spit and
sputter as much for want of it, as he had done
at it; yet all this proved of no signification to
Friday, and it was a long while before he could
endure ariy salt in his meat or bfc-th, and even
then but a small quantity.
Thus, having fed him sufficiently with bbill;8
meat and broth at that time, the next day I wiiS
Resolved to feast him with a roasted piecfe of tHfe
kid. And having no spit to fasten it, nor jack to
turn it, I made use of that common artifice which
many of the people of England have, that is, to
Ktet two poles iij ou each side of the fire, and one
across on the top, hanging the meat thereon with
a string, and so turning it round continually, till
it was sufficiently roasted. This practice caused
great admiration in my man Friday, being quite
another way than that to which the savages were
accustomed. But when he came to taste the
sweetness and tenderness of the flesh, he ex-
pressed his entire satisfaction above a thousand
different ways. As I could not but understand
his meaning, you may be sure I was as wonder-
fully pleased, especially when he made it also
very plain to me, that he would never, while he
lived, eat man's flesh more.
It was now high time I should set my new ser-
vant to work; so next day, I put him to beat out
some corn, and sift it in the same manner as I
had done before. And really the fellow was very
quick and handy in the execution of any thing I
ordered him to go about. I made him understand
that it was to make bread for us to eat, and after-
wards let him see me bake it. In short, he did
every thing as I ordered him in a little time as
well as I could perform it myself.
But now, considering that I had two mouths
to feed instead of one, it was necessary that I
should provide more ground for my harvest, and
plant a larger quantity of corn than I commonly
used to do; upon which, I marked out a larger
piece of land, fencing it in the same manner as
I had done before; in the execution of which, I
must give Friday this good word, mat no man
could work more hardy, or with better will than
fee did; and when I made him sensible that it
wan for bread to serve him as well as me, he then
rery passionately made me understand; that he'
thought I had much more labour on his account
than I had for myself; and that no pains or dili-
gence should be wanting in him", if I would but
direct him in those works, wherein he might pro-
ceed.
I must certainly own, that this was the most
pleasant year I ever had in the island; for after
some time, Friday began to talk pretty well, and
understood the names of those thmgs which I
was wont to call for, and the places where I usfed
to send him. Sd that my long silent tongue,
which had been so many years unused, except
when praying to God; or conversing with my poll,
now began to be occupied in teaching, and talk-
ing to my man Friday; for indeed I had such a
singular satisfaction in the fellow himself, so
innocent did his simple and Unfeigned honesty
appear more and more every day; that I really
began entirely to love him; and, for his part, I
believe there was no love lost, and that his nature
had been more charmed by my exceeding kind-
ness, and his affection more placed upon me', that
upon any other object whatsoever among his owii
countrymen.
I once had a great desire to try if he had any
hankering inclination to his own country again:
and by this tinle. having taught him English so
well, that he could .give me tolerable answers to
any question which I demanded, I asked him
whether that nation to which he belonged evei
'conquered inbattle? This question madeFriday
smile, and to which he answered, "Yes, yes, we
%lways fight the better;" as much to say, they
**^*^Mlpc^gB - - - 'fc-t-tirt:1 --'-- --:------- ". :-^'--_" . ---- ,-
always got the better in fight. You say, saia I,
that you always fight the better; why then, Fri-
day, how came you to be taken prisoner \
Friday. But for ail that, my nation beat much.
Master. How, say you, beat! if your nation
beat then, how came you to be taken 1
Friday. The more many mans than my na-
tion, in the place where me was, they take one-,
two, three and me; my nation much overheat
them in the yonder place where me no was, there
my nation mans beat one, two, three great thou-
sands'.
Master. Then why did not your men recover
yog from the hands of your enemies I
Friday. They run one, two, or three, and
me; tney make all go into the canoe; my nation
have no canoe that time.
Matter. 'Tis very well, Friday; but what
does your nation do with the prisoners they take;
Do they carry them away and eat them as they
have done 1
Friday- Yes, yes, my nation eat mans too,
eat up all.
Master* To what place do they carry them
to be devoured?
Friday. Go to other nations where they think.
Master. Do they bring them hither?
^Friday. Yes, come over hither, come over
other place.
Master. And have you been with them here,
Friday?
Friday. Yes, me been here, (pointing to the
north-west of the island, being the side where
they used to land.
Thus having gotten what account I could from
my man, I plainly understood-, that he had been
as bad as any of the rest of the cannibals, having
been formerly among the savages who used to
come on shore on the farthest part of the island,
upon the same bloody occasions as he was
brought hither for: and some time after, I carried
him to that place where he pointed; and no
sooner did he come there, but he presently knew
the ground, signifying to me that he was once
there when they ate up twenty men, two women
and a young child; but as he could not explain
the number in English, he did it by so man)
stones in a row, making a sign to me to count
them.
My next question was, how far it was from the
island to the shore, and whether canoes were not
often lost in the ocean? to which he answered,
there was no danger; that no canoes were evei
lost; but that after a little way out to the sea,
there was a strong current, and a wind always
one way, in the afternoon. This I thought at
first to be no more than the sets of tide, of going
out or coming in; but I afterwards understood
it was occasioned by the great draught and reflux,
of the mighty river Oroonoko, in the mouth or
gulph of which, I imagined my kingdom lay;
and that the land which I perceived to the west,
and north-west must be the great island Trinidad,
on the north of the river.
Well, you may be sure, this knowledge, which
the imperfect information of my man had led me
to, was very comfortable to me, and made me so
curious as to ask him, how I might depart from

this island, and get amongst those white men?
He told me, "Yes, yes, I might go in two canoes."
In two canoes, thought I, what does my man
mean. And, indeed it was. a Jong time before I
understood his meaning, which was, that it must
be a large boat, as big as two canoes, able to
bear with the waves, and not so liable to be over-
whelmed as one must be.
I believe there is no state of life but what may
be happy, if people would but endeavour for their
part to make it so. He is not the happiest man
that has the most riches, but he that is content
with what he hath. Before I had my servant, 1
thought myself miserable till I had him; and
now that I had enjoyed the happy benefits of him,
I still complained, and begged a deliverance from"
a place of retirement, ease and plenty, where
Providence had sufficiently blessed me. . In a
word, from this time, I entertained some hopes,
that one time or other, I might find an opportunity
to make my escape from this island, and that this
poor savage might be a jn;reat furtherance thereto:
I now began to instruct my servant, in the
saving knowledge of the true Deity, in which
the directions of God's holy Spirit assisted inc.
Friday, said I, you must know, that before this
world was made, there was an Almighty Being
existing, by whose power all things were made,
and whose majesty shall have no end. To be
glorified and adored by beings of a heavenly
nature, he created angels and archangels, that
is, glorified spirits resembling himself to en-
compass his throne, eternally singing forth his
11
praise, in the most heavenly sounds and divine
harmony.
I found it easy enough to imprint the right
notions in his mind of God: for nature assisted
me in all my arguments, to show him plainly the
necessity of a great and overruling, governing
power, of a secret directing providence, and of
the equity and reasonableness of paying adora-
tion to our Creator.
I then entered into a long discourse with him,
upon the subject of the world's redemption by
the Saviour of it, and the doctrine of repentance
preached from heaven, together with an holy faith
in our blessed Redeemer Jesus Christ.
By the constant application 1 made of the
Scriptures, as I read them to my man Friday, I
earnestly endeavoured to make him understand
every part of them as much, as lay in my power.
He also, on the other hand, by his very serious
questions and enquiries, made me a much better
proficient' in Scripture knowledge, than I should
have been by my own private reading and study.
You may well suppose, that, by the frequent
discourse we had together, my man and I be-
came most intimately acquainted, and that there
was very little that I could say, but what Friday
understood; and indeed, he spoke very fluently,
though it was but broken English. I now took
a particular pleasure in relating all my adventures,
especially those that occurred since my being
cast on this island. I made him understand that
wonderful mystery, as he conceived, of gunpowder
fclJ mllet, and taught him how to shoot. I also
presented to him a knife, which pleased him ex-
ceedingly, making him a belt, with a frog hang-
ing thereto, like those in which we wear hangers
in England; and instead of a hanger to put in
the frog, I gave him a hatchet, which was not
only as good, but even a better weapon upon many
occasions. In a word my man thus accoutred,
looked upon himself as great as Don Quixote,
when that celebrated champion went to combat
the windmill.
I next gave him a very particular description
of my misfortune in being shipwrecked; show-
ing him, as near as I could the place where the
ship lay, which had been gone long before; but
I brought him to the ruins of my boat, which, be-
fore, my whole strength could not move, but now
was almost rotten and fallen to pieces. I ob-
served my man Friday to view this boat with an
uncommon curiosity; which when he had done,
he stood pondering a great while, and said no-
thing,. At last, said I, Friday, what makes you
ponder so much "i He replied, "0 master, me
see like boat come to place at my nation."
It was some time, indeed, before I understood
what my man meant; but examining strictly into
it, I plainly found, that such another boat, re-
sembling mine, had come upon the country where
he dwelt: that is to say, by his farther explana-
tion, that the boat was driven there through stress
of weather.
Indeed Friday answered my demands very
well, making every thing plain to my understand-
ing; but beyond measure was I satisfied when he
toW mc with great warmth and ardour, "0 mas-
ter, we save white mans from drown;" upon
which I immediately asked him, if there were
any white mans, as he called them, in the boat;
"Yes, ves," said he, "the boat full, very full of
white mans." How many, Friday, said I. Here-
upon he numbered his fingers, and counted seven-
teen. And when I asked him what became of
them all, and whether they lived or not? he re-
plied, "Yes, master, they all live, they be live
among my nation." This information put fresh
thoughts into my head, that these must be the
very men who before I concluded had been
swallowed up in the ocean, after they had left
their ship that had struck upon the rocks of my
kingdom, and after escaping the fury of the deep,
landed upon the wild shore, and committed them-
selves to the fury of the devouring Indians.
The manner of their cruelties to one another,
which consequently, as I thought, must be acted
with greater barbarity to strangers, created in me
a great anxiety, and made me still more curious
to ask Friday concerning them. He told me, hje
was suro they still lived there, having resided
among them above four years, and that the sav-
ages gave them victuals to live upon. But pray,
Friday, said I, whence proceeded all this good
nature and generosity? How came it to pass that
they did not kill and eat them, to please their
devouring appetites; and occasion so splendid
an entertainment among them ?" No, no,"
said Friday, "they not kill 'em, they make bro-
ther with 'em;" by which I understood there was
a truce between them. And then I had a more
favourable ooinion of the Indians, upon Fri8ay>s
uttering the words: "My nation t'other natiqn
no eat man's but when mans make war fight:"
as though he had said, that neither those of his
kingdom, nor any other nations that he knew of,
ever ate their fellow-creatures, but such as their
law of arms allowed to be devoured: that is,
those miserable captives, whose misfortune it
should be to be made prisoners of war.
Some considerable time after, upon a very plea-
sant (Jay, in most serene weather, my man and I
stood upon the top of a hill, on the island, whence
I had once before beheld the continent of Ame-
rica. I could not tell immediately what was the
matter: for suddenly Friday, fell a jumping and
dancing as if he had been mad; and upon my
demanding the reason of his behaviour, " 0 joy,"
said he, "0 glad! there see my country, there
my nation, there white mans gether." And in-
deed such a rapturous sense of pleasure, ap-
peared in his countenance, that his eyes had an
uncommon sparkling and brightness, and such a
strange eagerness, as if he had a longing desire to
be in his own country again. This made me not
so well satisfied with my man Friday as before;
for by this appearance, I made no dispute, but
that if he could get back thither again, he would
not paly be unmindful of what religion I had
taught him, but likewise of the great obligation
he owed me for his wonderful deliverance; nay,
that he would not only inform his countrymen of
me, but accompany hundreds of them to my
kingdom, and make me a miserable sacrifice, like
those unhappy wretches taken in battle.
, indeed I was very much to blame to have
11*
these cruel, and unjust suspicions, and must freely
own I wronged the poor creature very much,
who was of a quite contrary temper. And had
he had that discerning acuteness which many
Europeans have, he would certainly have per-
ceived my coldness and indifference, and also
have been very much concerned upon that ac-
count.'
As we were walking up the same hill another
day, when the weather was so hazy at sea, that I
could not perceive the continent, Friday, said I,
don't you wish yourself to be in your own country
your own nation, among your old friends and ac-
quaintances? "Yes," said he, " me much 0 glad
to be at ray own nation." And what would you
do there, Friday? Would you turn wild again, eat
man's flesh, and be a savage as you were for-
merly 1 "No, no," (answered he, full of con-
cern, and shaking his head,) "Friday now tell
them to live good, tell them pray God, tell them
to eat corn, bread, cattle, flesh, milk, no eat man
again." But surely, replied I, if you should
offer to do all this, they will kill you; and to
manifest their contempt of such instruction, eat
you up when they have done. He then put on a
grave, yet innocent and smooth countenance,
saying, "No, they no kill me, they willing love
learn:" that is, that they would be very willing
to learn: adding withal, "that they had learned
very much of the bearded mans that came in the
boat." Will you, said I, go back again, Friday?
He smiled at that, and told me, that he could not
swim so far. But said I, I will make a canoe
for you: "Ye» master," oaid he, "me go if you
go, tne no go if you stay." I go, Friday! why
would you have them eat me up, and devour your
kind master 1 "No, no," said he, "me make
them no eat master, and me make them much
love you;" that is, he would tell them how I had
slain his enemies, and thereby saved his life, for
which reason he would make them love me: and
then he related to me, as well as he was able,
how exceeding kind those of his nation were to
the white, or bearded men, as he called them,
who in their great calamity, Were driven into their
country.
It was from" this time, indeed, I had strong in*
clinations to venture over* and use my utmost
efforts, if possible, to join with these white beard-
ed men, who undoubtedly were Spaniards or
Portuguese; for, thought I, it must be certainly
a better and safer way, to escape when there is a
good company, than for me alone, from an island
forty miles off the shore, and without any assist-
ance. Some days after, Friday and I being at
work, as usual* at the same time diverting our-
selves with various discourses, I told him I had a
boat which I would bestow upon him, whenever
he pleased to return to his own nation: and to
convince him of the truth of what I said, I took
him with me to the other side of the island, where
my "frigate lay, and then taking it from under
water, (for I always kept it sunk for fear of a
discovery,) we both went into it to see how it
would manage such an expedition.
And really never could any be more dexterous
in rowing than my faithful servant, making the
boat go as fast again as I could. Well, now,
Friday, said I, shall we now go to your much
desired nation? But, instead of meeting with
that cheerfulness I expected, he looked very dull
and melancholy at my saying so; which indeed
at first surprised me, till he made me sensible,
that his concern was about the boat's being too
small to go so far a voyage. Upon which, I let
him understand I had a much bigger; and ac-
cordingly, the next day went to the place, where
the first boat lay, which I had made, when all the
strength I had, or art I could use) failed me in
my attempt to get it into the water: but now it
having lain in the sun two and twenty years, and
ho care being taken of it all that while, it be-
came in a manner rotten. My man told me,
that such a boat would do very well for the
purpose, sufficient to carry "enough vittle, dring,
bread," for that was his manner of talking. In
short, my mind being strongly fixed, upon my
design of going over with him to the continent,
1 very plainly told him, that we would both go
and make a boat full as big, and more propor-
tionable than that, wherein he might safely re-
turn to his own nation.
Go your way, since you desire it, and leave
me alone by myself, as I was before I saved
vc-ar life.
Never was any creature more thunderstruck
than Friday was at these words, "Go me away,
leave master away," said he, after a long silence,
*• No, no, Friday die, Friday live not master
gone;" as though he had said, I neither can nor
will live, if my master sends me from him.
Friday felt towards me the greatest gratitude,
and the most sincere love; he found me not only
his deliverer, but his preserver and comforter;
not a severe and cruel tyrant, but a kind, loving,
and affable friend. He wanted for no manner of
sustenance; and when he was ill, or out of order,
I was his physician) not only for his body, but
his soul; and therefore no wonder was it, that
such an innocent creature, long since divested of
his former natural cruelty^ should have an un-
common concern at so cruel a separation from
me, which pierced him to the very soul, and
made him desire even to die, rather than live
without me.
After I had told Friday, in a very careless
manner, that he should be at his liberty as soon
as the boat was made, the language of his eyes
expressed all imaginable confusion; when, inv
mediately running to one of his hatchets, which
he used to wear as a defensive weapon, he gives
it into my hand, with a heart so full, that he could
scarcely speak. Friday, said I, what is it you
mean 1 What must I do with this?" Only kill
Friday," said he, "Friday care not live long."
But what must I kill you for? replied I again.
"Ah, dear master, what made you Friday save
from eat a me up, so keep long Friday, make Fri-
day love God, and now Friday send away, never
see Friday more." Arid while he spoke thus, the
tears ran down his cheeks in such a plentiful
manner, that I had much ado to refrain from
weeping also when I beheld the poor creature's
affection: so that I was forced to comfort him in
the best manner I could, which I did, by telling
130 LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF
him, if he was content to abide with me, I should
bo over willing to keep him.
After Friday's grief was somewhat abated,
more fully to convince me of his affection, he
said, " 0 master, me not care to be in my nation,
leave you here, me desire nation learn good,
that's all:" meaning, that his desire was for the
conversion of that barbarous people: and that
he wished me to go with him. And indeed, I
began to desire to go also, from my late discourse
with Friday, about these seventeen white beard-
ed men, that had been driven upon the barbarian
coast; whom I designed to join, as the only
means to further our escape. To which intent,
my man and I went to search for a proper tree to
fell, whereof we might make a perigua or canoe,
to undertake the voyage; and, indeed, we were
not long in finding one fit for our purpose, there
being enough of wood in the island to have built
a fleet of lurge vessels, but the thing we prin-
cipally wanted, was, to get one so near the water,
that we might launch it after it was finished, and
not commit so horrid a mistake as I had done
once before.
Well, after a great search for what was best
and most convenient, Friday, at last, whose judg-
ment in such affairs was much superior to mine,
pitches upon a kind of wood the most fitting for
it. But though my man exceeded me in the
knowledge of the most proper tree, yet I showed
him a much better and cleaner way to make a
'canoe than ever he knew before; for he wus for
burning the hollow or cavity of the tree, m order
to make this boat; but I then told hitn how we
might do with tools, teaching him at the same
time how to use them, which indeed he did very
dexterously; so that in a month's time we finish-
ed i% making it very handsome, by cutting the
outside in the true shape of a boat. After this,
it took us a full fortnight before we could get her
into the water, which we did, as it were, inch by
inch, upon great rollers: but when she was in,
she would have carried twenty men, with ail the
ease imaginable.
As I was very well pleased, you may be
sure, at the launching of this man of war of mine,
I was no less amazed to behold with what dex-
terity my man could manage her, turn her, and
paddle her along. Well, Friday, said I, what
:do you think of it now 1 Do you think this will
carry us over?" Yes, master," said he, "we
venture over well, though great blow wind." But
my design was yet farther, which he was insen-
sible of; and that to make a mast and a sail,
and provide her with an anchor and cable. As
to a mast that was no difficult thing at all to pro-
cure: so fixing upon a straight young cedar tree,
which I found near the place* (great plenty of it
abounding in the island,) and setting Friday to
cut it down, I gave him particular directions how
to shape and order it; but as to the sail, that, I
managed myself. I very well knew I had some
old ones, or pieces of sails enough, which had
lain six and twenty years by me; but not being
'careful to preserve them, as thinking I should
have no occasion to use them any more, when I
came to look over them, I found them almost all
rotten, except two; and with these I went to
work, and after a great deal of pains and awk-
ward tedious stitching for want of needles, at
length I finished a three-cornered ugly thing like
that we call in England, a shoulder of mutton
sail, to go with a boom at the bottom, and a small
sprit at the top, like those which our long-boats
use, and which I very well knew how to manage,
especially since it was like that which I had in
my patron's fishing-boat, when with my boy
Xury, I made my escape from the barbarian
shore.
It was nearly two months, I think, before I
completed this work, that is, the rigging, and
fitting up my mast and sails; and indeed they
were nicely done, having made a small stay, and
a sail, or foresail to it, to assist, if we should
turn to the windward; and, which was still more,
I fixed a rudder to the stern of her, to steer with;
and though I was but a very indifferent ship-wright,
"yet, as I was sensible of the great usefulness
and absolute necessity of a thing like this, I ap-
plied myself to it with such a constant applica-
tion, that at last I accomplished my design; but
what with the many dull contrivances I had
-about it, and the failure of many things, it cost
tne as much pains in ordering as in making the
boat. Besides, when all this was done, I had
my man to teach what belonged to its navigation;
for though he very well understood how to pad-
dle a canoe alone, he was an utter stranger to a
sail and a rudder, arid was amazed when he saw
me work the boat to and again in the sea, by
them, and how the sail jibbed and filled this way
or that way, as the course we sailed changed.
After some time, and a little use, I made all these
things very familiar to him, so that he becdme an
expert sailor, except in relation to the compass,
and that I could make him understand but little
of. But as it happened, there was seldom oc-
casion for it, there being but little cloudy weather,
and scarcely any fog in those parts; the stars
were always visible in the night, and the shore
by day, except in the rainy season, which con-
fined every one to his habitation. Thus entered
into the seven and twentieth year of my reign
or captivity, which you please, (the last three of
which, blessed with the company of my man
Friday, ought not to be reckoned,) I kept the
anniversary of my landing here with the same
thankfulness to God for his tender mercies, as I
did before; and certainly as I had great cause
for thankful acknowledgment for my deliverance
at first, I had much greater now for such singular
and additional testimonies of the care of Provi-
dence over me, in all my distresses of both body
and mind, and the great hopes I had of being
effectually and speedily delivered; for I had a
strong impression upon my mind, that I should
not be another year in this island. But, how-
ever, I still continued on with my husbandry,
digging, planting, and fencing as usual: gather-
ing and curing my grapes, and doing all other
things that were necessary.
And now the rainy season beginning to come
on, obliged me to keep the longer within doors;
but before this, I brought my new vessel into the
creek, where I had landed my rafts, from the
12
ship; so we waited for the months of November
and DccemDer, in which I designed to venture
over the ocean.
No sooner did the seasonable weather begin
to draw near, but so much was I elevated with
this new designed adventure, that I daily pre-
pared for the voyage. The first thing that 1
thought on was, to lay by a certain quantity of
provisions, as a sufficient store for such an expe-
dition, intending in a week or a fortnight's time
to open the dock, and launch out the boat for that
purpose. But one morning, as I was very busy
upon something necessary for this occasion, I
called Friday to me, and bid him to go to the
sea-shore, and see if he could find a turtle or
tortoise, a thing which we commonly had once a
week, as much upon account of the eggs, as for
the sake of the flesh. He had not been long
gone, but he came running back, as though he
was pursued for life, and as it were flew over my
outer wall, or fence, like one that felt not the
ground, or steps he set his feet on: before i had
time to enquire the reason of his precipitation,
he cries out, " 0 dear master, 0 sorrow! sorrow!
Bad! O bad!" Why, what's the matter, Fri-
day? said I. "0 yonder, yonder," said he
"there be one, two, three canoes! two, three."
Surely (thought I,) there must be six, by my
man's way of reckoning; but on a stricter en
quiry, I found there were but three. Well, Friday,
said I, don't be terrified. I warrant you we will
defend ourselves against them But though I
comforted him in the best manner I could, the
poor creature trembled so, that I scarcely knew
what to do with him: "0, master," said he,
41 they come look Friday, cut pieces Friday, cut
a me up."
Why, Friday, said I, they will eat me up as
well as you, and my danger is as great as your's.
But since it is so, we must resolve to fight for
our lives. What say you 1 Can you fight Fri-
day 1 "Yes," said he very faintly, "me shoot,
me kill what I can, but there come great many
number." That's no matter, said I again, our
guns will terrify those that we do not kill; I am
very willing to stand by you to the last drop of
my blood.
Now, tell me, if you will do the like by me,
and obey my orders in whatsoever I command I
Friday then answered, "0 master, me lose life,
for you, me die when you bid die." Thus con-
cluding all questions' concerning his fidelity, I
ordered him to take the two fowling pieces, which,
we always carried, and load them with large
swan-shot, as big as small pistol bullets; then I
took four muskets and loaded them with two
slugs, and five small bullets each; charging my
two pistols each with a brace, I hung my great
sword, as customary, naked to my side, and
gave Friday his hatchet, as a most excellent
weapon for defence.
Thus prepared, I took my perspective glass,
and went up to the side of the hill, to see what I
could discover; and I perceived very soon, by
my glass, that there were one and twenty savages,
three prisoners, and three canoes, and their chief
concern seemed to be the triumphant banquet
upon three poor human bodies, a thing which by
this time I had observed was very common with
them. UpoD which I called to Friday; and
showing him a great tree, that was just at the
corner of the wood, near which they were, I
ordered him to repair thither, and bring me word,
if he could plainly perceive their actions; accord-
ingly he did as J .commanded him, and came back
with this melancholy story, that they were all
about their $re, eating the flesh of one of their
prisoners; and that another lay bound upon the
sand, a little distance from them, whom they
designed for their next sacrifice; and this he
told me, was not one of their nation, but one of
those very bearded men, who was driven by a
storm into their country, and whom he had so
often spoken to me about. You may be sure,
that, upon hearing this, my souj was ready to
sink within me; when ascending up into a tree,
I saw plainly, by my glass, a white man, who lay
upon the beach of the sea, with his hands tied
with flags or things resembling rushes, being
covered with clothes, and seerning to be an Euro*
pean. From the tree where I took this pnospect,
I perceived another tree, and a thicket beyond it,
about fifty yards nearer to them that where I was,
which by taking a small circle round, I might
come at undiscovered, and then I should be with-
in half a shot of these devourers. I therefore
got behind some bushes, which held all the way
till I came to the other tree; and then I ascended
to a little rising ground, not above eighteen yards
distance, and there I had a .full view of these
creatures, and could perceive all their actions.
Such a sight did then appear, as obliged me
not to lose a moment's time. No less than
nineteen of these dreadful wretches sat upon the
ground, close huddle/1 together, expressing all
the delight imaginable at so barbarous an enter-
tainment; and they had just sent the other two
.to murder this poor unhappy Christian, and bring
him limb by limb to their tire; for they were then
just going to untie the bands from his feet.
Hereupon, immediately turning to my man,
Now, Friday, said I, mind what I say, fail in
nothing, but do exactly as you see me do. All
which he promising to perform, I set down one
of my muskets, and the fowling-piece upon the
ground, and Friday did the same by his; and
with the other musket I took my aim at ihe sav-
ages, bidding him to do the like; are you ready,
said I; "Y.es, muster," said he, why then fire at
them said I; and at that very moment I gave
fire likewise.
I only killed one and wounded two: but my
man Friday, taking his aim much better than I,
killed two, and wounded three. You may be
sure they were in a dreadful consternation, at
such an unexpected disaster; and those who had
yet escaped our penetrating shot, immediately
jumped upon their feet, but were in such a con-
fusion, that they knew not which way to nui'-or
look; not knowing from whence their destruction
came. We threw down oar pieces, and took up
others, giving a second dreadful volley; but as
they were only loaded with swan-shot or small
pistol bullets, we perceived only two of them
fall, though many were wounded who ran yelling
"and screaminT about like mad creatures. Now,
12*
Friday, said I lay, down your piece, and take up
the musket, and follow me. He did so with
great courage, when showing ourselves to the
savages, we gave a great shout, and made direct-
ly to the poor victim, who would have been sa-
crificed, had not our first fire obliged the butch-
ers, with three others, to jump into a canoe.
By my order, Friday fired at them, at which shot
I thought he had killed them all, by reason of
their falling to the bottom of the boat; however
he killed two, and mort#lly wounded a third. In
the. mean time I cut the flags that tied the hands
and feet of the poor creature, and lifting him up,
asked him in the Portuguese tongue, What he
was? he answered me in Latin, "Christianus:"
but so very weak and faint, that he could scarcely
stand or speak. And I next asked him, what
countryman he was? He said "Espaniola," and
then uttered all the thankfulness imaginable for
his deliverance. Signior, (said I with as much
Spanish as I was master of,) let us talk afterwards
hut fight now; here, take this sword and pistol,
and do what you can. And indeed he did so with
such courage and intrepidity, that he cut two of
them to pieces in an instant. I ordered Friday
to run for the guns we had left at the tree, which
he brought to me with great swiftness, and then I
gave hire my musket, while I loaded the rest.
But now there happened a fierce encounter be-
tween the Spaniard and one of the savages, who
made at him with one of their wooden swords;
and though the former was as brave as could be
expected, having twice wounded his enemy in
the he* 1; yet beinj weak and faint, the Indian
-«^ - r
had thrown him upon the ground, and was
wresting my sword out of his hand, which the
Spaniard very wisely quitting, drew out his pistol,
and shot him through the body before 1 could
come near him, though I was running to his
assistance. As to Friday, he pursued the flying
wretches with his hatchet, dispatching three, but
the rest were too nimble for him. The Spaniard
taking one of the fowling pieces, wounded two,
who running into the wood, Friday pursued and
killed; but the other,notwithstanding his wounds,
plunged himself into the sea, and .-warn to those
who were left in the canoe, which with one
wounded, were all that escaped out of one and
twenty.
The savages in the canoe worked very hard
to get out of our reach, and Friday was as eager
in pursuing them: and, indeed, I was no less
anxious about their escape, lest after the news
had been carried to their people, they should
return in multitudes, and destroy us. So being
resolved to pursue them, I jumped into one of
their canoes, and bid Friday follow me; but no
sooner was I in, than, to my surprise, I found
another poor creature, bound hand and foot for
the slaughter, just as the Spaniard had been,
with very little life in him. Immediately I un-
bound him, and would have helped him up; but
he could neither stand nor speak but groaned so
piteously, as thinking he was unbound in order
to be slain. Hereupon I bid Friday speak to
him, and tell him of his deliverance; when pull-
ing out my bottle, I made the poor wretch drink
a littl«, which, with tha joyful n»ws h» had rs~
ceived, so revived his heart; that he sat up in .the
boat. As soon as Friday began to hear hirh
speak, and look more fully in his face, it wolilfl
have moved any one to tears to perceive his
uncommon transports of joy; for he kissed;
embraced him, hugged him, cried, laughed, hal-
looed, jumped about, danced, sung, (hen cried
again, wrung his hands, beat his face and head,
then sung and jumped about again, like a dis-
tracted creature: so that it was a great while
befoic 1 could make him speak to me, or tell me
what was the matter with him; but when he
came to the liberty of his speech, at last he told
me it was his father.
Here, indeed, I was infinitely moved to see
that dutiful and tender affection this poor savage
had to his aged parent. He would sit down by
him in the boat; open his breast, and hold his
father's head close to his bosomi half nh hottr
together, to cherish him: then he took.his arms
and ankles, which were stiff and numbed, with
binding, mid chafed and rubbed them with his
hands; by which means, perceiving what the
case was, I gave him some rum, which proved of
s;rent benefit to him.
While we were busy in this action, the snyawes
<)ad gotten almost out of sight; and happy h
was we did not pursue them: for there arose
from the north-west, such a violent storm, which
continued all night long, that I could not suppose
otherwise but that they were all drowned. After
this, I called Friday to me, and asked him, if he
had given his father any bread J He shook bis
bead, und said, "• iSone, not one bit, nie eat a
koBiRson entries. 141
up all;" so I gave him a cake of bread out of a
little pouch I carried for this end. I likewise
gave him two or three bunches of raisins for his
father.
Away he then runs out of the boat as if ho
was bewitched, with such an extraordinary swift-
ness, that he was out of sight as it were in an
instant; but, at his return, I perceived him slack-
en his pace, because he had something in his
hand. And this 1 found to be, as he approached
nearer, an earthen jug with some water for his
father, with two more cakes of bread, which ho
delivered into my hands. Being very thirsty
myself, I drank some of the water, of which
when his father hud drank sufficiently, it more
revived his spirits than all the rum I had given
him.
I then called Friday to me, and ordered him
'o carry one of the cakes, and some water to the
Spaniard, who was reposing himself upon a
green place under the shade of a tree, but so
weak, that though he exerted himself, he could
not stand upon his feet. Upon which, I ordered
Friday to rub and bathe his ankles with rum, as
ne did his father's. But every minute he was
employed in this, he would cast his eyes towards
the boat, where he left his father sitting; who
suddenly disappearing, he flew like lightning to
him. and finding he only laid himself down to
ease his limbs, he returned back to me presently,
and then I spoke to the Spaniard to let Friday
help him, and lead him to the boat in order to be
conveyed to my dwelling, where I would take
care «f him. Upon which, Fir'ay towk hia

upon his back, and so carried him to the canoe,
setting him close by his father; and presently
stepping out again, launched the boat off, and
paddled it along the shore faster than I could
.walk, though the wind blew very hard too; and
having brought them safe to the creek, away he
runs to fetch the other canoe, which he brought
to the creek almost as soon as I got to it by land;
then wafting me over, he took our new guests
out of the boat; but so weak were they, that I
was forced to make a kind of a hand-barrow;
and when I came to my castle; not being willing
to make an entrance into my wall, we made t'nem
a handsome tent, covered with old sails, and
boughs of trees', making two gdod beds of rice
straw, with blankets to lie upon arid cover tiiem.
Thus, like an absolute king, over subjects who
owed their lives to me, I thought myself very
considerable.
To get provisions for my poo* .'cak suLjects,
I ordered Friday to kill me a yearling goat;
which when he had done, I cut off the hinder
quarters, and chopping it irito small pieces', boiled
and stewed it, putting barley and rice into the
broth. This I carried into their tent, set a table',
dined with them, and encouraged them. Friday
.was my interpreter to his father, and indeed to
,the Spaniard too, who spoke the language of
the savages pretty well. After dinner,I ordeied
Friday to fetch home all our arms from the field
of battle, and the next day to bury the dead
bodies, which he did accordingly. And now I
made Friday enquire of his father, whether he
thought those savu.Tes bud escaped the late storm
V
«BC n - I,' —=-—:
in their canoe, and if so, whether they would not
return with a force too great for us to resist?
He answered, that he thought it impossible they
could outlive the storm: or if they were driven
southwardly, they would come to a laud where
they would as certainly be devoured, as if thev
were drowned in the sea. And suppose they had
attained their own country, the strangeness of
their fatal and bloody attack would make.them
tell then; people that the rest of them were killed
by thunder and lightning, not hj the hand of
hian, but by two heavenly spirits (meaning Fri-
day and me,) who were sent from above to destroy
them'. And this, he said, he knew, I e'cause he
heard them say the same to one another. And
ihd'eed he was in the right on't; fori have heard
lince, that these four men gave out, that whoever
ent to that enchantea .,iund, would be destroyed
. "ire from the gods.
So canoes appearing some time after, as I
vuected, my apprehensions ceased; instead of
/liich my lorimer thoughts of a voyage took
place, especially when Friday's lather assured
me I should have good usage in his nation. As
to the Spaniard', he told me that sixteen more-of
his countrymen^ and Portuguese, who had been
shipwrecked, made their escape, thither; 'hat
though they were in Union with the savages, yet
they were very miserable for want of provisions
and other necessaries. When I asked him about
the particulars of his voyage, he answered, that
their ship was bound from Rio de la Plata to the
Havana ;. that \yhen the ship was lost only five
men perished in 'he ocean; the rest having saved
themselves in the boat, were now landed on the
main continent. And what do they intend to do
there t said I. He replied, they had concertea
measures to escape by building a vessel, but
that they had neither tools nor provisions) so
that all their designs came to nothing. Sup-
posing (said I,) I should make a proposal, and
invite them here, would they not carry me priso-
ner to New Spain? He answered no; for he
knew them to be such honest men, as would
scorn to act with such inhuman baseness to
their deliverer: than if I pleased, he and the old
savage would go over to them, talk with them
about it, and bring me an answer: that they
should all swear fidelity to me as their leader,
upon the holy sacrament; and, for his part, he
would not only do the same, but stand by me to
the last drop of his blood, should there be oc-
casion.
These solemn assurances made me resolve to
grant them relief, and to send these two over
for that purpose; but when every thing was ready,
the Spaniard raised an objection, which carried
a great deal of weight in it: "You know, Sir,
said he, that having been some time with you, I
cannot but be sensible that your stock of rice
and corn may be sufficient, perhaps, for us at
present, but not for them, should they come over
presently, much less to victual a vessel for an
intended voyage. And therefore, my advice is,
to wait another harvest, and in the mean time,
cultivate and improve some more land, whereby
we may have plenty of provisions, in order t*
"execute our design."
This advice of the Spaniard I approved ex-
tremely; and so satisfied was I of his fidelity,
tlvt I esteemed him ever after. And thus we
all four went to work upon some more land, and
against seed-time, we had gotten so much cured
and trimmed up, as was sufficient to sow 22
bushels of barley on, and 16 jars of rice, which
was in short all the seed we had to spare. As
we were four in number; and by this time all in
good health, we feared not an hundred of Indians,
should they venture to attack us; and while the
com was \growing, I pitched upon some trees,
fit to build us a large vessel, in case the Span-
iards canle over; which being marked, I ordered
Friday and his father to cut them down, appoint-
ing the Spaniard, who was now my privy coun-
sellor, to oversee and direct the work. 1 like-
wise increased my flocks of goats, by shooting
the wild dams, and bringing home their kids to
my enclosure; nor did I neglect the grape
season, but cured them as usual, though I had
such a quantity now, as would have filled 80
barrels with raisins.
And thus all of us being employed, they in
working, and I in providing for them, till harvest
came, God Almighty bjessed the increase of it
so much, that from twenty-two bushels of barley,
we threshed out two hundred and twenty, and the
like quantity of rice, sufficient to victual a ship
fit to carry me and all the Spaniards to any part
of America.
Thus the prinsipnl objection being answered,
by a sufficient stoclt of provisions, I sent my
two amLassadors over to the main land, with a
13
,11 , - i i 1
regal authority to administer the oaths of allegi-
ance and fidelity, and have an instrument signed
under their hands, though I never asked whether
they had pen, ink, or paper; when giving each
of them a musket with eight charges of powder
and ball, and provisions enough for eight days,
they sailed away with a fair gale, on a day when
the moon was at full.
Scarcely a fortnight had passed over my head;
but impatient for their return, I laid me down to
sleep one morning, when a strange accident
happened, which was ushered in by my man's
coming running to me, and calling aloud, " Mas-
ter, master, they are come, they are come."
Upon which, not dreaming of any danger, out I
jumped from my bed, put on my clothes, and
hurried through my little grove; when looking
towards the sea, 1 perceived a boat, about a league
and a half distant, standing in for the shore, with
a fair wind. I beheld they did not come from
the side where the landHay on, but from the south-
most end of the island. So these being none ol
the people we wanted, I ordered Friday to lie still,
till such time as I came down from the mountain,
which, with my ladder, I now ascended, in ordVr
ti discover more fully what they were; and now.
with the help of my perspective glass, I plainly
perceived an English ship, which I concluded it
to be, by the fashion of its long boat; and which
filled me with such uncommon transports of joy,
that I cannot tell how to describe; and yet some
secret doubts hung ab<3ut me, proceeding from I
know not what cause, as though I had reason to
ba on my guiyd.
Not long it was, before I perceived the boat to
approach the shore, as though they looked for
a place where they might conveniently land;
and at last they ran their Coat on the shore upon
the beach, about half a mile distance; which
proved so much the happier for me", since, had
they come into the creek, they had landed, just at
my door, and might not only have forced me out
of my castle, but plundered me of all I had in
the world. Now I was fully convinced they
were all Englishmen, three of whom were un-
armed and bound; when immediately, the first
four or five leaped on shore, and took those three
out of the boat as prisoners, one of whom I could
perceive used the most passionate gestures of
«8itreaty, affliction and despair, while the others
in a less degree showed abundance of concern.
Not knowing the meaning of this, I beckoned
to Friday, who was below, to ascend the moun-
tain, and likewise view this sight. "0 master,"
said he to me, "you see English mans eat priso
ners as well as savage mans." And do you
think they will eat them, Friday? said I. "Yes,"
said Friday, "they eat a all up." No, no, said I,
Friday, I am much more concerned lest they
murder them; but ns for eating them up, that I
am sure they will never do.
And now I not only lamented my misfortune
in not having the Spaniard and Savage with me,
but also that I could not come within shot of them
unperceived, (they having no fire-arms among
them,) and save these three men, whom I thought
they were going to kill with their swords. But
- -—' 'mT*r
some comfort it was to me, that I perceived they
were set at liberty to go .where they pleased, the
rascally seamen scattering about as though they
had a mind to see the place; and so long did they
negligently ramble, that the tide had ebb^ed so low,
as to leave the boat aground. Nor were the two
men that were in her more circumspect: for
having drunk a little too much liquor, they fell
fast asleep; but one of them waking before the
other, and perceiving the boat too fast aground
for his strength to move it, he hallooed out to the
rest, who made all possible expedition to come
to him; but as Providence ordered it, all their
force was ineffectual to launch her, when I could
hear them speak to one another. "Why let her
alone, Jack, can't ye, she'll float next tide;" by
which words I was fully convinced they were
my own countrymen. I this while lay very quiet,
as being fully sensible it could be no less than
ten hours before the boat would be afloat, and
then it would be so dark, that they could not
easi'yperceive me, by which means I should be
at more liberty to hear their talk, and observe alj
their motions; not but .that I prepared for my
defence: yet as I had another sort of enemy to
combat with, I acted with more caution. I took
two fusees on my shoulder, and gave Friday
three muskets; besides my formidable goat-skin,
and monstrous cap, made me look as fierce and
terrible as Hercules of old, especially wfoen two
pistols were stuck in my belt, and my naked
sword was hanging by my side.
The three poor distressed creatures, $00 anx-
ious to get any repose, were, however, seated
under the shade of a great tree, about a quarter
of a mile from ine.
Upon which, without any more ado, I ap-
proached towards them, with my man following
behind me, and, before I was perceived, I called
aloud to them in Spanish, what are y$ gentle-
men?
At these words they started up in great con-
fusion, when they beheld the strange figure I
made; they returned no answer but seemed as
if they would fly from me: Gentlemen, (said I
in English,) don't be afraid, perhaps you have a
friend nearer than you expect. "He must be
from heaven," said one of them, gravely pulling
off his hat, "for we are past all help in this
world." All help is from heaven, said 1, but
Sir as I have perceived every action between you
and these brutes since your landing, only inform
me how to assist you, and I will do it to the
utmost of my power.
Am I talking with God or man? said he, in
melting tears. Are you of human kind, or an
angel'! "Sir," said I, "my poor habit will tell you
1 am a man, and an Englishman, willing to assist
you, having but this servant only, here are arms
and ammunition; tell freely your condition, can
we save you'!" The story, said he, is too long to
relate, since our butchers are so near: but, Sir,
I was master of that ship, my men have mutined,
and it is as a favour they have put my mate, this
passenger, and me, on shore without murdering
us, though wo expect nothing but perishing her-j.
44 Are your enemies gone V said I. No, replied
13*
he (pointing to a thicket,) there they lie, while
my heart tre'hibles, lest, having seen and heard
us, they should murder us all. "Have they fire-
arms?" said I. They have hut two pieces, said
be, one of which is left in the boat. He also
told me, there were two enormous villains
amongst them, that were the authors of this
mutiny, who if they were killed or seized, the
rest might be induced to return to their obedience.
When he had given me all the satisfaction I
could desire, I gave him and his two companions
each of them a gun, with powder and ball suflir
cient, and firing myself, killed one of the Cap-
tain's enemies, and wounded the other who
eagerly called for assistance; but the Captain
(who had reserved his piece,) coming up to him,
"Sirrah," said he, "tis too late to call for assist
ance, you should rather cry to God to pardon
your villainy:" and so knocked him down with
the stock of his gun: three others were also
slightly wounded, who, at my appoach, cried out
for mercy. This the Captain granted,
condition that they would swear to be. true him
in recovering the ship, which they solemnly did:
however, I obliged the Captain to keep then}
bound. After which I sent Friday and the Cap-
tain's mate to secure the boat, and bring away the
oars and sail; when the men, seeing their late
distressed Captain, now their conqueror, sub-
mitted to be bound also. And then it was, that
having more liberty, I related the adventures ol
my whole life, which he heard with a serious at-
tention. After this, I carried him and his two
companions mto my little fortified castle, show-
i
ed them all my conveniences, and, when this was
over, we began to consider about regaining the
ship: he said that there were twenty-six hands
on board, who knowing their lives were forfeited
by the law, for conspiracy and mutiny, were so
very hardened, that it would be dangerous for
our small company to attack them. This was a
reasonable inference, indeed; but something we
must resolve on, and immediately put in execu-
tion: we therefore heaved the boat upon the
beach so high that she could not shoot off at high
water mark, and broke a hole in her not easy to be
stopped; so that all the signals they gave for the
boat to come on board were in vain. This oblig-
ed them to send another boat ashore, with ten
men armed, whose faces the Captain plainly des-
cried, the boatswain being the chief officer; but
he said there were three honest lads among them,
who were forced into the conspiracy. Here-
upon, I gave him fresh courage, (for I had perceiv-
ed he was in concern,) in the mean while securing
our prisoners, except two, whom we took to our
assistance, we thought ourselves able enough to
endure a battle. When the sailors landed, and
beheld their boat in that condition, they not only
hallooed, but fired, for their companions to hear,
yet they received no answer. This struck them
with horror and amazement, thinking their com-
panions were murdered, they made as if they
would return to the ship. I could perceive the
Captain's countenance change at this, till, of a
sudden, three men were ordered to look after the
boat, while the other seven leapt on shore, in
order to search for their companions; and, in-
deed, they came to the brow of the hill, near my
ancient castle, from whence they could see to a
great distance in the woods, and there shouting
and hallooing till tired and weary, they at length
sealed themselves under a spreadmg tree. My
opinion was, that nolhing could be done till night,
when I might use some artifice to get them all
/ut of the boat; but of a sudden they started up,
and made towards the sea-side; hereupon I or-
dered Friday and the Captain's mate to go over
fhe creek, and halloo as loud as they could, nnd
to decoying them into the woods, come round to
•ne again. And this, indeed, had good effect;
for they followed the noise, till coming westward
to the creek, they called for their boat to carry
thetn over, and taking one of the men out of her,
left two to look after her, having fastened her to
the stump of a little tree on the shore. Hereupon
immediately the Captain and our party passing
the creek, out of their sight, we surprised them
both, by the Captain's knocking down one and
ordering the other to surrender upon pain of
death, and who being the honestest of them all,
sincerely joined with us. By this time it was
pretty late; when the rest returning to their boat,
which they found aground in the creek, the tide
out, and the men gone, they ran about wringing
their hands, crying it was an enchanted island,
and that they should be all murdered by spirits or
devils. My men would willingly have fallen
upon them, but I would not agree to hazard any
of our party. But to be more certain, Fridny
and the Captain crawled upon their hands nnd
feet, as near as possible; and when the boatswain
approached in sight, so eager was the Captain,
that he fired, and killed him on the spot: Friday
wounded the next man, and a third ran away.
Hereupon I advanced with my whole army; and
it being dark, I ordered the man we had surprised
in the boat, to call them by their names, and to
parley with them. Accordingly he called out
aloud, "Tom Smith, Tom Smith!" He an-
swered, "Who's that;" "Robinson!" answer-
ed the other, " For God's sake, Tom, surrender
immediately, or you're all dead men." "Who
must we surrender to?" says Smith. "To our
Captain and a large force here, who have taken
me prisoner, wounded Will Fyre, and killed the
boatswain." "Shall we have quarter then?"
said he. Hereupon the Captain calls out, "Yoi:
Smith, you know my voice, surrender imme-
diately, and you shall have your lives granted
except Will Atkins." Hereupon Atkins cries
out, "What have I done, Captain, more than
the rest, who have been as bad as me;" but that
was a lie, for he was the person that laid hold of
him, and bound him. However, he was ordered
to submit to the governor's mercy, for such was
I called. And so laying down their arms, we
bound them all, and seized on their boat.
After this, the Captain expostulated with them,
telling them that the governor was an Englishman,
who might execute them there; but he thought
they would be sent to England. Her on they
implored the Captain to intercede f< lives,
and begged they might not be sent t ngland.
This answered our project for seizing the ship,
for, after sending them, fast bound, to the cave.
I sent the Captain to treat with them in the
governor's name, offering them pardon if they
would assist in recovering the ship. Upon
which, t.iey all promised to stand by him till the
last drop of their blood; and whoever acted
treacherously should be hanged in chains upon
the beach. They were all released on these
assurances: and then the Captain repaired to the
other boat, making hU passenger Captain of her,
and gave him four men well armed; while, him-
self, his mate, and five more, went in the other
boat. By midnight they came within call of the
ship, when the Captain ordered Robinson to hail
her, and tell them that with great difficulty they
had found the men at last. But while they were
discoursing, the Captain, his mate, and the rest
entered, and knocked down the second mate,
and carpenter, secured those that were upon the
deck, by putting them under hatches, while the
other boat's crew entered and secured the fore-
castle; they then broke into the round-house,
where the mate, after some resistance, shot the
pirate Captain through the head, upon which all
the rest yielded themselves prisoners. And thus
the ship being recovered, the joyful signal was
fired, which I heard with the greatest joy imagin-
able: nor was it long before he brought the ship
to an anchor at the creek's mouth, w here coming
to me urm'vares, "There," says he, :' my dear-
est friend and deliverer, there is your ship, and
we are your servants:" a comfort so unspeak-
able, as made me swoon in his arms, while, with
^gratitude to heaven, we were tenderly embracing
each other.
Nothing now remained, but to consult what
we should do with the prisoners, whom he
thought it was not safe to lake on hoard. Here-
upon, concerting with the Captain, I dressed
myself in one of his suits, and sending for them',
told them, that as I was going to leave the island
with all my people, if they would tarry there,
their lives should be spared; if not, they should
be hanged at the first port they came to. They
agreed to slay. Hereupon I told them my wtiole
story, charging them to be kind to the Spaniards
that were expected, gave them all my arms, and
informing them of every thing necessary for their
subsistence, I, and my man Friday, went on
board. But the next morning two of the men
came swimming to the ship's side, desiring the
Captain to take them on board, though he hanged
them afterwards, complaining mightily how barba-
rously the others used them. Upon which I
prevailed with the Captain to take them in; and
having received some punishment, they proved
more honest for the future. And so I bid fare-
Well to this island, carrying along with me my
money, my parrot, unbrella, and goat-skin cap;
setting sail December 12', 1687, after twenty-
eight years, two months, and nineteen days resi-
dence, and landing in England, June 11, 1688',
after five and thirty years absence from my own
country, which rendered me altogether a stranger
there.

I.
I am monarch of all I survey,
My right there is none to dispute;
From the centre all round to the sea,
I am lord of the fowl and the brute.
Oh, Solitude! where are the ch'irms
Tint ssi^es have seen i;i thy face?
Better dwell in the midst of a'arm.",
Than reign i:i this ho.rible p'acc.
II.
I am out of humanity's reach,
I must finish my journey alone,
Never heai the sweet music of speech;
I start at the sound of my own.
14
The beasts, that roam over the plain*
My form with indifference jee;
They are so unacquainted with man,
Their tameness is shocking to me.
III.
Society, friendship, and love,
Divinely bestow'd upon man,
Oh, had I the wings of a dove,
How soon would I taste you agam!
My sorrows I then might assuage
In the ways of religion and truth,
Might learn from the wisdom of age,
And be cheer'd by the sallies of youth
IV.
Religion! what treasure untold
Resides in that heavenly world!
More precious than silver and gold,
Or all that this earth can afford.
But the toll of the summoning bell
These vallies and rocks never heard,
Ne'er sijrh'd1 at the sound of a knell.
Or smil'd when a Sabbath appearM.
V.
To winds, that have made me your sporL
Convey to this desolate shore
Some cordial endearing report
Of a land I shall visit no more.
My friends, do they now and then send
A wish or a thought after me 1
O tell me I yet have a friend,
Though a friend I am never to see.
VI.
How fleet is a glance of the mind!
Oompar'd with the speed of its flight
Tne tempest itself lags behind,
And the swift wing'd arrow of light.
When I think of my own native land,
In a moment I seem to be there;
But, alas! recollection at band
Soon hurrys me back to despair.
VII.
But the sea-fowl is gone to her nest.
The beast is laid down in his lair,
Ev'n here is a season of rest,
And I to my cabin repair.
There's mercy in every place:
And mercy, encouraging thought!
uives even affliction a grace,
And reconciles man to his lot.
