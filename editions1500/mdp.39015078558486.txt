ROKINSON CRUSOE was the son of
a respectable merchant in Hull. The
V kindness of his parents had made his life very happy.
His heart was not a bad one; but his love of idleness
and his thoughtlessness gave his good parents a great deal
of anxiety. Instead of working and learning his lessons,
in order to become a clever man when he grew up, his
chief pleasure was to idle about the quays. Whenever
he did take a book in his hand, his thoughts were
always wandering away to the forest of masts in
the harbour. His one idea was to go to sea and
to make long journeys into distant countries;
chiefly because he hoped, by this means, to evade
the necessity for working and doing his duty. He
begged of his father to let him go to sea. But that
worthy man, who well knew the true reason of his
son's desire to travel, insisted ^Jthat he should
first learn some occupation f:' thoroughly,
and, when he had done that,

his father would not stand in the way of his desires;
but that, unless he chose to work, he would in
vain seek to be happy in this world. His father told
him: - - "If, however, you do, ungratefully, quit your
parents, contrary to their expressed wish, you will cause them to
die of grief. We have already lost two sons and you are the last
child left to us. It is your duty to be a comfort and a support to
us in our old age. You know that I am no longer strong and
hearty. Of one thing you may be quite certain — no one who
despises God's commandments can
prosper in this world."
Whenever he had been thus talked
to, RoKtNSON would mend his ways for
a short time; but his thoughtlessness
very soon caused him to forget the
remonstrances and advice of his father, as
well as the tears of his mother. Foreign
countries seemed, to his mind, to be the
more delightful, in proportion as his work
at home became distasteful to him. As
ill-luck would have it, one day, when he
was lounging round the docks as usual, he
met a schoolfellow who was about to start on
a voyage to London in a ship belonging to
l>


his
father,
and who
urged him to
come with them. "If
the life there does not
please you, you can
but return to Hull!"
said his schoolfellow.
This great temptation
ROISINSC IN could not
withstand. Therefore,
without for a moment con-
sidering the anxiety he would
cause his parents thereby, he
accepted the offer, and, without
sending word to say where
he was, or what had be-
come of him, he quitted
home. When, far out at
sea. he saw the church-
spires of his native town
disappearing in the mists of the evening,
he did feel some remorse; but it was then
too late: and with this reflection he tried to
satisfy his conscience.
Storm and Shipwreck.
Everything went well on the voyage,
until the sixth day, when they had come
within sight of Yarmouth; but here they
were obliged to remain and to cast anchor,
in consequence of headwinds. On the eighth
day a very violent storm came on, and they
had to take in all the sails.
The wind roared and whistled. The
captain ordered the best bower anchor
to be let go. ROBINSON became more
and more frightened, and, to add to all
his miseries, he felt dreadfully sea-sick.
He clambered up, out of the forcastle, on
to deck, where a fearful sight met his eyes.
The waves were running mountains high and
broke from time to time over the ship, bury-
ing her in an avalanche of water. The
sailors, who went past him, had despair
written on their faces, and they pushed the
idler roughly out of their way. His knees
tottered. His whole body trembled with
mortal terror, whilst qualms of conscience
tortured him; now, for the first time, he
began to call to mind the warnings of his
father and the sorrow' and anxiety he had
caused his mother. He bitterly and in truth
repented the step he had taken. He saw
that he was being punished for his wicked-
ness.
The fury of the storm increased as the
day went on. Towards evening, it was found
necessary to lower the topmasts. A dis-
masted bark drifted past them at a short
distance. Close to the coast, he saw a ship
founder, and, in the most abject terror, he
vowed that, if God would only save him
this once, he would return to his parents.
When midnight approached, a leak was dis-
covered in the bottom of the ship. The
water already stood four feet deep in the
hold. Everybody was ordered to help
in working the pumps. The boatswain shook
ROBINSON roughly, in order to awaken
him out of the kind of stupor into which
he had fallen. There was no help for it;
he had to take his turn at the pumps with
the rest. But^ notwithstanding all the exer-
tions that were made, the water kept on rising
in the ship's hold and she began visibly to
sink. No other vessel that
could give them any help
was in sight. Signal guns
were fired every minute.
A boat was lowered; but it
was immediately swamped.
Even the oldest and most
weatherbeaten sailors fell on
their knees and prayed God
to help them; but no prayer
came from ROBINSON'S lips.
He felt that he was me-
rely suffering God's just
punishment for his sins.
Overcome with despair, he
fainted away, and all was a
blank.
Saved.
Suddenly ROBINSON felt
himself seized in a powerful
grasp and dragged by main
force into a boat. Some
brave men who belonged
to a ship, which he had
been unable to see, but who 1 -
were not too far away to
hear the minute guns, had risked their lives to save
those who were in danger. They had long fought in
vain against the wind and the waves; but at last the
storm stilled a little. They were able to get near the
sinking ship and they succeeded in laying hold of
a rope that was thrown out to them. They were only
just in time. The kindhearted boatswain had the thought-
fulness to pick up ROBINSON as he lay senseless on the
deck and to lower him into the boat. The whole crew
were taken off in the same way and thus saved. The
sailors now pushed off quickly from the fated vessel,
which only remained a few minutes longer above the
water. ROBINSON raised a cry of horror as he saw
her sink. Fortunately, the sailors were able to force the
boat through the foaming breakers on to the beach,
where the whole of the party landed safely. Full of
joy and gratitude, the shipwrecked men thanked their
preservers. Some humane merchants, in Yarmouth,
took care of the sufferers, providing them with food
and clothing and furnishing them with money to enable
them to continue their journey.
ROBINSON had here an opportunity of returning
to his parents, who would have received him with
joy and affection. The captain of the ship, now, for
the first time, learnt that he had quitted home without
the knowledge of his parents and spoke to him very
seriously on the subject; but the sailors, who, after
they had been on shore a little while, forgot all about
the danger they had escaped from, made fun of
the milksop, whose courage had been so shortlived;
and their jeers caused ROHINSON to forget all his good
resolutions. He accompanied his friend to London.
v \m\.\

The Voyage to the Gold-
Coast.
ROBINSON now wandered about London,
where the busy life intoxicated his senses!
His sole thought was how to become rich
without being obliged to work as a sailor.
In the meantime, his small stock of
money was very soon spent in amusements
of different kinds- with his ship companions
and he began to feel the pangs of hunger.
All at once, he remembered that a rich
relative of his mother lived in LONDON.
He told the kind hearted merchant the
whole of his story, without however men-
tioning the disgraceful way in which he
had run away from home. This excellent
man, who was under obligations to ROBIN-
SON's father for some kindness the latter
had shewn him, believed ROBINSON'S story,
and lent him twenty pounds.
A fortunate chance just at this time
caused ROBINSON to make the acquaintance
of a ship-captain, who had lately returned
from Guinea, where he had done a good
stroke of business and who was on the point
of making a second voyage thither. He
offered to take ROBINSON with him on his
next voyage, advising him to lay out. in the
meantime, the greater part of his ready
money in the purchase of glass beads, toys,
knives and axes; in order that when they
arrived, he might be in a position to barter
them with the natives on the coast for
gold dust and ivory. One fine evening in
autumn, the good ship HOPE put to sea,
with the truant on board.
Attacked by Pirates.
The wind being favourable, they soon
reached the Canary islands; when, one
morning, the whole crew were called on
deck. The captain had for a long time been
watching a large, pirate-looking vessel,
which was coming, under a crowd of canvas,
in the direction of the HOPE.
The chase continued for nearly eight
hours. However the pirate kept creeping
closer and closer, until, at three o'clock in the


s

now obliged to perform the most menial services without com-
plaining. He planned many modes of escape; but none of them
proved feasible. He lived in the hope that the pirate captain
might perhaps take him to sea with him, and that then, a
Christian ship might defeat them, and thus he might regain
his liberty. But his master never took him when he went
on one of his piratical excursions.
As ROBINSON shewed himself to be a great adept in
the art of fishing, the overseer MULEY often took him with
him. One day his master proposed to go fishing with a
few friends. ROBINSON was to get every thing ready,
to put plenty to eat and drink on board the ship's long
boat, as well as some fowling-pieces and gunpowder.
The party were going out to shoot sea-fowl, and ROBINSON,
together with MULEY and a boy named XURY. were to
accompany them. When however all was ready for a
start, the friends sent word to say that they could not
go out shooting, but that they would come over and
spend the evening with the pirate. He therefore bade the
overseer take ROBINSON and XURY and go out in the
boat to catch a good dish of fish for supper.
ROBINSON'S Escape.
Scarcely had ROBINSON heard the orders that were
given, before a plan occurred to him by which he might
regain his freedom. He secreted a few tools and some
more food in the boat and started in good spirits with
MULEY and XURY. The provisions for the shooting party
had also, fortunately, been left in the boat. When they got
outside the harbour, they set to work and cast out the nets,
but did not catch anything. ROBINSON, who was looked
upon as the best fisherman, advised that they should go further
out to sea and handed over the rudder to XURY. "Now
or never," he said to himself when he saw that they were about
and thehpjjooping down, as
though m>werepicking up
something, he suddenly
seized the overseer
with all his might,
round the waist
and threw him
overboard. XURY
sprang to his feet
in a fright. But
MULEY, whom
ROBINSON knew
to be
a mile and a half from land.
a good
came to the s'ur-
face again and
swam with loud
cries after the boat.
ROBINSON however
at once seized one ot
the loaded guns and
pointing it atMuLtiv called

He stole quietly behind MULEY
out in a stern voice: "If you
come near the boat I will
shoot you through the head,
for I am resolved to have
my liberty; but if you
swim to land — the
sea is quite calm —
you have nothing to
fear from me." At
first he turned the
boat's head as if
he were making for
the shores of Spain;
as soon, however, as
MULEY was no longer
visible, ROBINSON turn-
ed the boat's head
round in a southerly
direction, keeping along
the coast of Africa. With
favourable winds they conti-
nued in this way for five days,
to launch their last boat.
They struggled with the
energy of despair against
the raging waters that
threatened to engulph the
boat and drove it towards
the beach; whilst they saw
the remains of their late
ship become a prey to
the waves. Suddenly how-
ever a huge breaker came
rushing along. A heart-
rending shriek was heard,
and, in an instant, the boat
was upset, whilst the men
it had contained were bat-
tling with the seething,
raging waters. ROBINSON
also went down with the
rest, but he quickly suc-
ceeded in getting up to
the surface again, where he
took a deep breath. In the /
next instant, he was caught M
by the following wave and //
^t^^/


dragged down below the water. Still
he had seen the shore and his lungs
were full of air, so he put forth all the
strength he had left, in a vigorous endeavour
to reach the beach. At last he felt a severe
blow on his chest. He had been thrown upon
the surface of a large, flat rock and would have
been lost if he had not recovered his senses
before the following wave came up to him.
He was just able, by crawling forward
on his hands and knees, clinging all the
time to every unevenness in the stone,
to reach a place of safety. But then
he sank back in a fainting fit which
lasted for some hours. At last con-
sciousness returned. He felt a wonderful
sense of happiness steal over him. He
knew that he was saved. But where was he?
The boat and the ship had both disappeared.
He alone was left. He tottered towards the top of
the cliffs, where, overcome with a sense of deep gratitude
for his escape and of joy at the scene around him, he fell
upon his knees and, with tears in his eyes, thanked the
Almighty for his deliverance from so terrible a death.
All at once it occurred to him that, at any moment, wild
beasts or savages might come out of the forest and attack
him. His first thought was to fly. But where should he
run to? He looked round to see what he should do. Night
would soon come on. He fancied he heard the roaring of
some wild beast in the distance. His hair stood on end with
fright. He possessed no weapon with which to
defend himself. He had saved nothing but the
clothes he had on. Every sound terrified him.
In this wretched state he passed the rest of the
day, and when night came on he climbed up
into a high tree with wide-spreading branches,
and thickly covered with leaves, where he sought,
amidst the foliage, to find a safe resting-place
for the night.
When ROBINSON awoke the next morning,
his eyes rested upon the beautiful scene which
lay spread out in all its glory before him; but
hunger and thirst made the first claims upon him,
and he felt pain and stiffness in all his limbs. He
came down from the tree. No living thing appear-
ed to be about, except a few parrots which flew
screaming away. He was surrounded by an im-
penetrable thicket of bushes. Rare flowers hung


*v<«

down from the trees over his head; but he
I i fl**^if could neither find any fruit, nor a spring of
** I ^»J water to quench his thirst. Suddenly he stop-
ped as if turned to stone. Only a few paces
distant from him, he saw, coiled round a tree-
stem, a huge snake. In mortal terror he fled
from the spot. All his limbs trembled. The
dread of wild animals was now constantly before
his mind. He climbed one of the tallest trees to
look round. He found that he was on a middling-
sized island; but he could not see any houses,
nor any traces of smoke. A feeling of complete
solitude came over him. The sun now began
to be very powerful, so he took the wide leaves
from "off a banana-tree and made himself a hat
out of them; and on the next day he constructed
an umbrella out of the same material, in order
that he might have some protection from the

intense heat of the mid-day sun. But above
all things it was necessary for him to
procure food and clothing. At last he
came across a cocoa-nut palm, the water
contained in the fruit of which served
both to still his hunger and to quench
his thirst.
His dread of exposure to the inclemen-
cy of the weather during the coming winter
season, increased daily. However, he dis-
covered a cave, which he thoroughly cleared
out; and although this cost him a great deal
of labour, it afforded him a place to live in.
It was quite time that he did so, for one
night he was awakened from his sleep by
a dreadful storm of thunder and lightning
that was raging over the island. He was
almost stunned by one clap louder than the
rest, and he found that the lightning had
struck a clump of trees, — fortunately stand-
ing separate from the mass of the forest,—
and had set a dry stem on fire. In a
very short time all the trees composing
the group were in flames. Tongues of fire
shot forth in the darkness. Burning branches
came tumbling to the ground, and the wind
carried a shower of sparks out seaward.
This spectacle was very grand, but it gave
RONINSON an idea of how different a storm
on his island was to those he had been
accustomed to at home. On one occasion,
when he was out hunting, he heard a sound
that was very familiar to him. It was the
bleating of goats, of which animals a large
herd soon ran past the place where he
was hidden. Their bleating was a delicious
sound to his ears, as it led him to hope
that he might find some human beings on
the island. Filled with a longing for the
society of mankind, he wandered for days
about the island; but could not find any
traces of men. One day exhausted by his
exertions, he threw himself down upon the
ground. But now again his ears were greeted
with the familiar sound of the whimpering of
a goat, which seemed to him like a voice
from his own home. He forced his way
through the bushes and there he found an
old she-goat that had broken its leg by a fall
and was trying to descend the cliff. Having
only three legs she could not run very fast,
and ROBINSON easily overtook her. which
delighted him greatly. He carried her on
his back to where his cave was Here he
set the poor beast's leg and having tied it
up with a piece of linen torn off his shirt.
he prepared a soft bed of dry grass for the
patient to lie upon. The goat soon learned

to understand that he did not mean to do
her any harm, and became quite tame.
During one of his excursions, he had
come upon a very large herd of goats, and,
by following the prints of their footsteps,
he arrived at last at a spot where a pool
of salt water had been dried up by the sun,
and he became by this means possessed of a
supply of a condiment which he had so
long been obliged to do without in his food.
ROBINSON determined to invent a
means of catching some of the goats alive.
For this purpose he made a lasso, with
some long pieces of bass which he took
from one of the trees on the island, and,
taking up his post on the road which the
goats travelled to go to the salt-lick, he
succeeded in catching a full grown she-goat
.
A young kid remained by her side, whilst
the rest of the herd fled in all directions.
ROBINSON put the mother on his shoulders,
and carried her to his cave, whilst the kid
followed him like a dog. On his way he
was overtaken by a heavy storm. The rain
poured down in torrents, so that he was com-
pletely wet through before he reached home
with his captives. He attempted to dry
his clothes, as best he could, at his fire; but
it was not much use, as he had no dry ones
to put on.
ROBINSON'S Illness.
During the night he awoke, feeling very
feverish, and when morning came, it was
with the greatest difficulty he was able to
make his way to the spring. By mid-day
he was much worse, and, the water being
all finished, he was tormented by a dread-
ful thirst. But now he was no longer capable
of leaving his bed. The fever increased from
hour to hour. His head seemed as if it
must split, so terribly did it ache. He tossed
about restlessly on his bed and dug his
hands into the sandy walls of his cave. The
goats came now and then to gaze at him,
as though they felt sorry for him, although
their bleating often disturbed him sadly;
still he could no longer even rise from
the place where he lay to go to them. He
might otherwise have quenched his thirst
from the distended udder of the mother
foat. A painful dread of thus dying of
unger and thirst tormented him day and
night. He remembered how tenderly his
mother used to nurse him when he was ill.
How she would watch for days at his bedside,
and how those dear parents, whom he had
quitted with such ingratitude, rejoiced at his
recovery. In the ravings of delirium, he
seemed to see the figure of his father, bent
down with sorrow, and the face of his mother,
pale with anxiety. In his helpless solitude
he stretched forth his arms to them; but
they appeared to turn away from him. The
fever became worse and worse, his breath
came in gasps, and his lips burnt like live
coals. In his terror, he tried to pray; but
the words seemed to die away upon his
lips. He felt that he was a miserable sinner,
and could not pluck up courage to call upon
God to help him. A frenzied despair took
possession of him. He looked upon him-
self as deserted by God and man; and al-
though he knew that his punishment was
a just one. it was not the less terrible. What
troubled him most was that no one
would weep for his loss; no one
would miss him. His eyes
overflowed with tears, and
his heart was filled with
real penitence. Invol-
untarily, his hands
folded themselves,
and he prayed God
that his sins might
be forgiven him.
After this he fell
into a refreshing
sleep, and. when
he awoke, found
that the fever
had left him.
Recovery.
His recovery
proceeded very slow-
ly; still, in a few days
he was so far conva-
lescent, that, with the aid
of a stick, he managed to go
down and look after the welfare of his
goats, and to attend to their wants. How
delicious it was to take a deep draught
of the fresh, warm milk, which his goats
supplied in such abundance. He was soon
strong enough to take down some food
and water for his live stock, who had been
suffering great privations during his illness.
The feeling of gratitude, which he felt at his
recovery from illness, enabled him now. to
submit, even to his solitary condition, with-
out repining. He had become a totally
altered being. He had learnt to cast all his
care upon God. who had saved him from
such great dangers. He rapidly regained
his strength, and was soon able to resume
his ordinary occupations. He determined

to make a thick hedge round his dwelling,
and for this purpose he made use of the
prickly cactus, which he planted all round
the entrance to his cave.
Eruption of the Volcano.
A few days after he had finished plant-
ing this hedge, he was awakened by a
violent trembling of the earth, which continu-
ed throughout the whole day, and increased
in force. He became terribly alarmed, being
afraid lest he should be buried alive in his
cave, by the falling masses of earth. At mid-
day he observed that a mountain,
at no great distance, began to
give forth dense masses of
smoke and by the even-
ing the volcano burst
forth with terrific vio-
lence. A huge col-
umn of smoke shot
up into the air;
thick showers of
sparks and ashes
fell upon the is-
land; stones and
large masses of
rock were hurl-
ed from the cra-
ter to consider-
able distances.
The heavens be-
came darkened,
and a fierce storm
raged round the
summit of the vol-
cano. High, rocky
cliffs came tumbling
down with a loud crash.
The violence of the storm kept
on increasing, and the sea raged in all
its fury. ROBINSON fled into the interior
of the country, although he did not
know where to go for safety, as the
whole island seemed to tremble under his
feet with the violent shocks of the earth-
quake. Thus he hurried on, over hill and
dale. At last, thoroughly worn out by terror
and exertion, he fell to the ground. He
must have lain thus an entire day. When
he again recovered consciousness, the earth-
quake and the eruption of the volcano were
at an end. He made his way back to his
cave, and found, to his delight, that it had
not suffered, though all around were to be
seen traces of the terrible storm that had
been raging.
ROBINSON'S Household Occupations.
ROBINSON'S entire attention was now directed towards pro-
viding a sufficient stock of wood to last him, as fuel, through-
out the whole of the rainy season, which he now knew to be
approaching. The diy branches of the trees, which he found
strewed about, served his purpose admirably, and, with the aid of
A rough sledge, which he managed to construct by tying together
some of the larger limbs of trees, he conveyed great quantities
of these branches to a projecting ledge of rock, beneath which
he piled them up. His chief care now was to construct a proper
fireplace, so that his fuel might be used with as little waste as
possible.
He had discovered a bed of clay under the sand, not far
from the cave, and, with the aid of his wooden spade, he cut
out a number of pieces in the shape of bricks, which he first
dried in the sun and then burnt in his fire. With another kind
of earth, which he used as mortar, and these bricks, he built
for himself a regular fireplace in the fore part of his cave. fur-
nishing it also with a chimney. How happy he was when he
was able to eat a piece of kid, which he had killed, and roasted
at this convenient fireplace, leaving the rest of the meat hang-
ing up in the chimney to smoke, so that it might not go bad.
As the heat of the sun kept on increasing, and all the foliage
became parched up, he felt convinced that the rainy season could
not be far off. He must therefore now take energetic measures
for increasing his store of dried meat and fruits, as well as for
collecting a sufficient supply of food for his live stock. But the
first thing he did was to make a kind of hammock, so as to
avoid sleeping on the bare ground any longer.


After a great deal of trouble, he succeeded in weaving,
with thin twigs off the trees, some badly shaped baskets, which
were, however, very useful for collecting heads of
maize, the fruit of the banana, and roots of the sweet
potato. To his great joy, one evening he found
on the beach some very large turtle, which he was
able to catch and whose flesh tasted very good.
Besides which, their meat was not only excellent
eating when fresh, but kept very well when smoked.
Their huge shells also were of great service to
him for letting the goat's milk stand in. In ad-
dition to this, he was fortunate enough to catch
several young kids, which he added to his herd;
whilst his small stock of furniture, combined with
his cheery fireplace, made his dwelling look to a
certain extent comfortable. Soon after this, the
rainy season set in, and prevented him from leav-
ing his cave for weeks. This leisure he turned
to account by improving his household arrange-
ments in various ways. He made himself a better
umbrella, which he covered with the skins of
goats; so that it not only protected him from
the sun, but also from the rain. He was
now in a position to undertake longer ex-
cursions, without any fear of the conse-
quences of being caught in a shower. For
the steady downpour of rain had already
kept him a prisoner in his cave for a whole
month. At last, however, the rains ceased,
and the sun shone forth again in all his
wonted splendour.
ROBINSON'S Church.
After a short time, new life sprang up
all over the island, from the lately parched
soil. The trees put on a fresh mantle of
spring green and the valleys brought forth
a variegated carpet of flowers. The creepers
hung in graceful festoons from tree to tree,
and the joyous song of the birds resounded
through the forest. The sun poured its
life-giving rays from the deep blue firma-
ment, and the sea reflected, in its depths,
the colour of the sky. Both earth and
heaven seemed to have just come forth
from the Creator's hand. Even ROBINSON'^
downcast heart was awakened to a new life,
and was filled with gratitude towards a merci-
ful Providence that had thus gloriously renewed
all things. He could not but feel that he was
not forsaken; that he had indeed been granted
a new lease of life. He felt that God was near
him, both in the howling of the wind and in
the roaring of the waves.
One lovely summer's evening, he was rest-
ing on a hill near the sea-shore, watching
the sun go down with a splendour he had
never before witnessed. Mov-
ed by the grandeur of the
scene and the solemn
silence which reigned
around him, R.OHIN-
SON fell on his knees
and clasped his
hands in heartfelt
prayer. His soul
was moved to its
depths by a sense
of thankfulness, and
his eyes ran over
with tears. He made
a vow that, come
what might - - whe-
ther he ever saw the ••
countenance of a human
being again, or not — he
would always resign himself
patiently to the will of God.
The thought that he might pos-
sibly regain the favour of the Al-
mighty, which he had so justly forfeited,
comforted his mind.
Every Sunday morning he would come
to church to this hill, and it seemed to him
as though he could, on this spot, hold
converse more freely with his Maker, and
was more absolutely in His presence. The
second summer passed away in this manner.
Further Improvements in his
Household.
ROBINSON'S clothes were now almost
torn to pieces and only hung together in
tatters. It was therefore time that he should
contrive some means of making himself
new garments. With the aid of his now
nearly worn-out knife he cut out some goat
skins, so as to make the parts of a coat, and
sewed them together with thread that he
had manufactured from the bass of a tree.
His flock of goats had been increased
by many a fortunate capture. But the
things he wanted most were some vessels
that would hold water, either for drinking
or cooking purposes. He formed several
pots of various sizes, out of the clay he
had found, and by degrees he learnt to
make them of the proper shape. Then he
dried them in the sun and, after they were
dry, he burnt them in his fire. Still, the
greater part of them cracked, and those
that did not crack were not fit to hold any
liquid. At last it occurred to him that salt

is used to give a water-
proof glaze to pottery; and
after a few trials, he actu-
ally succeeded in mak-
ing some pots that
would hold water. It
was quite a luxury,
when he again tast-
ed boiled meat.
Christmas.
In the meantime
his almanack, which
he kept with great
care by means of not-
ches in a long stick,
told him that Christmas
was now at hand; and
the thought of this recalled
vividly to his mind his Eng-
lish home and his dear parents.
The island looked most lovely in its
garb of delicate spring green. Yet how gladly
would he have exchanged all this for the deep
snow and severe cold of a northern winter, if
only he could thereby have purchased the
right to revisit his beloved home. Still, he
was determined that he would mark the day
somehow. He went out into the forest, where
he cut down a small tree. This he decorated
with candles made from the wax of wild bees
and some tree pith which served for the
wicks. He tried as much as possible to get
all his household work done beforehand,
and when Christmas-eve came, he lighted
up his tree, which in its turn brilliantly illu-
minated, for the first time, the gloomy cave
in which he had taken up his abode. When
he looked upon these shining tapers, a flood
of recollections of his beloved home and
of his youthful days overcame him and his
pent-up feelings found vent in loud sobs. He
went out into the open air. Here he seemed
to be in the midst of one vast Christmas-
tree, the lights of which shone all round
him. His spirit went forth to the Creator
of heaven and earth. He knelt down, under
that starlit sky, in fervent prayer, and a
heavenly peace seemed to steal into his
heart.
Domestic Cares.
To his great joy, the goat he had last
caught presenter! him with a couple of
little kids, which afforded him great amuse-
ment in watching their droll gambols. He
also managed to increase his flock by many
fortunate captures, in cleverly arranged pit-
falls. He was soon obliged to enclose a
large piece of ground for his goats, and
before the rainy season came on again he
made them a shed in which they might
take shelter from the wet. This was the
first year in which he planted
anything for his own use, and
at the end of two months,
he had a splendid crop
of maize to reward his
pains. His household
was now in pretty
good order. He
had provided an
ample store of

firewood. He had plenty of provisions laid
up, for himself and his goats. Hence he found
leisure to reflect upon his position. He was
again rilled with a longing for the companion-
ship of some human being. He would sit
for days doing nothing, and gaze out to sea
in search of a ship; but this year also passed
away without any vessel coming in
sight. This made him very low-
spirited; and at last, a feeling of
wild despair came over him.
He forgot his vows, and
murmured against his
Heavenly Father for
having forsaken him,
and having condem-
ned him to live for
ever on this deso-
late island. All his
thoughts ran upon
the one idea of leav-
ing the island. He
determined to build
himself a boat, and.
with the aid of fire,
and of an axe he had
made for himself out of
a sharp stone, he managed
to hollow out a tree stem,
which had fallen close to the
water's edge. Nevertheless, he was
obliged to acknowledge that a sail was ab-
solutely necessary to enable him to undertake
a voyage; and as he had no hope of getting
saw but too plainly that his plans were useless.
ROBINSON'S Voyage.
At last, however, he determined upon
making a voyage of discovery
round the island. He gave his
goats an ample supply of
food and water. He
put provisions
and water


for himself into the boat, and as he had
a favourable wind, he shoved off from
land. The boat was, however, caught in
a current running out from the island; and,
notwithstanding the almost superhuman
efforts made by ROBINSON, he could not
force the boat against the stream. He was
now being rapidly carried out to sea. The
trees on the island became more and more
indistinct, and, at last, the hills themselves
disappeared in the blue haze. A mortal
terror seized him. He could not tell how
he should be saved from dying of starvation
upon the open sea. A light wind now got
up against the current, and the boat began
to rock and roll terribly. ROBINSON really
did despair of saving his life. Longingly
he stretched forth his arms towards the is-
land, where he had at any rate enjoyed
safety, liberty and the necessaries of life.
Oh! if he could only get back there once
more! He would submit to his fate with
resignation and thankfulness; even though
he should be destined to remain in this
solitude for the rest of his days. Yes; but
now it was too late! Perhaps within an-
other hours time he would become the
prey of the waves. Fear paralyzed his
limbs and parched his throat. The force
of the wind increased. He bitterly re-
gretted his want of gratitude to God, Who
had so often mercifully protected him, and
vowed that he would never murmur against
His will, if he might only be permitted
once more to tread on dry land. By this
time night had closed in. All at once he
thought he could recognise a group of
trees upon the island! — Yes, it was indeed
so. the wind had altered the course of the
current, and he had been brought back to
the island without knowing it. In a very
short time he could recognise the trees

distinctly. They wore those under which
he had made his church. He now took
up the oars with renewed vigour, and put
forth all his strength to reach the land.
His exertions were crowned with success.
He was rapidly approaching the shore. But
it was necessary now to be careful lest the
boat should run upon one of the numerous
reefs which here projected into the sea.
He laboured thus for hours and his strength
was frequently well nigh spent. But the
sight of the shore so close to him. always
revived his flagging powers. At last, he
succeeded in guiding his boat into a gentle
current which brought him to land. With
a cry of joy he jumped out upon the
beach. He now felt the firm earth under
his feet again. He thought himself in
Paradise. Tears of gratitude flowed from
his eyes. He knelt down upon the sea-shore
and returned thanks to God for having once
more saved his life. He remained thus for
about an hour, on the beach,
until he regained his
strength. — Sud-
denly however
he started to
his feet. He
heard his
name
being called. "ROBINSON! where have you
been to?" All his limbs trembled. His
eyes almost started from his head, in the
endeavour to see, through the darkness,
who it was calling him. There, close by
his side, sat a parrot which he had caught
and tamed some time before, and it was he
that had called out his master's name. A
smile of pleasure passed over RoKlNSON's
face as he recognised his feathered friend,
whom he had taught to ask this question.
It seemed as though the very island was
glad of his return. He rose from the
ground and called to the bird, which at
once flew to him and settled on his hand,
where it had been accustomed to perch.
Here again it put the question: "ROBINSON!
where have you been to V" He now fastened
the boat to the shore and hastened through
the valleys to his cave. While he was still at
a distance, the goats set up a joyous bleat-
ing, as though they recognised his footsteps,
and when he entered the
enclosure they flock-
ed around him.
It seemed as
though he
had been
absent for
weeks.


Yet the fire, ff which he had so carefully
banked up with ashes before his depar-
ture, was still alight upon the hearth. His
cave seemed the most comfortable dwelling-
place he had ever been in, and he could not
imagine how it was possible for him to have
been discontented.
A Mysterious Discovery.
Another year had passed away. ROBIN-
SON'S peace of mind, however, had not been
disturbed again. His longing desire for the
companionship of some human being had
given place to a placid contentment, a
peaceful resignation to God's will. Fear and
anxiety had no longer the mastery over him.
A mysterious discovery, however, was
now destined to overthrow, in one moment,
this disposition which had been acquired
at the cost of so much
time and experience. -,>
One day, when
he had made
a longer excursion than usual, he came to a
part of the island he had never before visited.
Whilst walking quietly along the sand, on
the sea-shore, he stopped suddenly as if
thunderstruck. His lance fell from his hand.
He gazed fixedly upon a mark in the
sand — it was the imprint of a human
foot! —• there could be no mistake about
it. He gradually came to his senses. He
did not fly from the spot. He knelt down
to examine the footstep, which pointed
in the direction of the sea. Trembling,
he looked all round him. For this mark
shewed that he was not the only inhabitant
of the island. The naked foot which had
made this print, must have belonged to a
savage. Therefore, savages either lived upon
the island, or else they had come over from
the mainland and had landed here! But
if they were savages, they might also be
cannibals! Perhaps they
were, even now, hidden

in the woods and might spring forth at
any moment. He clutched his weapons,
while a nameless terror overpowered him.
The least sound startled him. He looked
about vacantly. When he had again reached
the high ground, he dashed full speed to-
wards his cave and when he
arrived behind the thick
hedge, he ventured for
the first time to
draw his breath
freely. But
the savages
would
be sure
to disco-
ver his
hiding
place! .4
Whither
should
he flee
so as
to hide
from
them?
Should he
destroy
his dwell-
ing?
Destroy
every
trace of
the la-
bour of
years, and
flee with
his goats
into the fo-
rest? For
some time he
did not dare to
come out of his cave. Fear
had so completely gained the
mastery over his mind that he could not
collect his thoughts sufficiently to devise
any coherent scheme. He could no longer
sleep at night. In every sound he fancied
he heard men's voices. His late dependence
on God was again overthrown. He never
considered that the Almighty, Who had al-
ready saved him so often from danger, could
also protect him on this occasion, if it were
His good pleasure to do so. In the grey
twilight of the morning he would frequently
go up to the highest point of the island,
whence almost the whole country could be
overlooked; but, even from that observatory,

he could see neither the wreck of a ship,
nor any signs of smoke. As weeks went
by in this manner, and no further traces
of human beings were visible, he regained,
to a certain extent, his composure of mind.
He became more and more assured that
the footprint had been made, not
by any hidden inhabitant of
the island, but by some
savage who had come
over with a party
from the main land,
and had perhaps
been driven here
by stress of wea-
ther, but had
certainly gone
away long
ago. True.
the savages
might come
back again
at any mo-
ment, and
what
should he
do then?
The most
necessary
thing to
be done
was to for-
tify his cave
better than
at present.
He construct-
ed a second
wall or hedge
round it. by con-
necting by means
of stakes and wattles
the trees which he had
planted round it. The interior
wall he made stronger, and raised
it higher with earth and stones. Moreover
he planted a large number of trees in a
half circle round his cave at a little
distance from the second hedge, and be-
tween these trees he planted some very
fast-growing bushes; so that within a
year's time, his dwelling place was sur-
rounded by a perfectly impenetrable thicket,
behind which probably no one would think
of looking for a human dwelling.
Whilst engaged in these daily tasks,
another year passed by — the eighth since
he had been cast ashore. His dread of the
savages gradually wore off; so that he again

undertook cautious excursions into the in-
terior of the island.
A Terrible Surprise.
One day, when thus wandering about the
island, ROBINSON arrived at the spot where
he had first seen the imprint of a human
foot, and here he mounted one of the lower
hills near the sea shore. Suddenly he
fancied — and his heart stopped beating
at the idea — that he could see, far away
upon the waves, a boat bobbing up and
down. Whilst he was still considering what
he should do;—doubtful whether he could
trust his eyes; or whether it was really a
boat, full of savages, that he had seen ; — he
observed a thin column of smoke, curling
up into the air from the beach. His first
idea was to fly from the spot; but as he
noticed that a number of birds were as-
sembled on the open sea-shore, he thought
he might take it for granted that no human
beings were there. He therefore crept
down to the place and stopped suddenly,
as if petrified with horror at the sight
which met his eyes. The beach was
strewed with human skulls and other
bones; in the midst of which the traces of
a still unextinguished fire were visible.
Shuddering with disgust, ROBINSON stood
rooted to the place, gazing at the relics ot
a feast which had evidently been held, not
long before, by those inhuman savages upon
this spot. Thoroughly horrified and sick-
ened, he fled to his dwelling. The boat
which he had seen had evidently brought
those cruel wretches to the island. On his
way home, he found, in several places,
distinct traces of human beings.
The memory of that shocking scene
haunted him day and night for a long time.
The details were always present to his mind
in all their hideousness; whilst his rage
and fury at these fiends in human shape
were so great that he took the desperate
resolve — if ever they should visit the island
again — to attack them whilst they were
engaged in their detestable meal and to save,
if possible, from their clutches some of the
unfortunate beings whom they had destined
for sacrifice. He hoped that his mere

^> .7 2X^*3&

appearance would suffice to terrify the savages. He made a number
of sharp arrows and practised himself daily in throwing sharp edged
stones. But for months he watched the sea in vain from his hill
top. He did not again see anything of a suspicious character, and
by degrees, a more peaceful frame of mind, and a pious resignation
to God's will, took possession of him.
The Crystal Grotto.
One day, as ROBINSON was in the forest collecting dry wood to
burn it into charcoal, he discovered, in a thick bush that ran along
the face of the cliff, an opening in the rock which appeared to
become broader as it deepened. He crept on his hands and knees
into the hole. At last he found there was room enough, in the
cavern for him to stand upright and he felt his way further onwards
by means of his hands against the face of the rock. But he sud-
denly started back in terror: for. out of the darkness, he saw two
large eyes like coals of fire glaring at him and he heard a noise
as of some one groaning in pain. Hark! were not those really the
words of some human being in agony! Terrified beyond measure.
ROBINSON got out of the cavern as quickly as possible; but
when he again emerged into the daylight, he plucked up
courage and was ashamed of his own cowardice. At any rate,
he would ascertain for certain whether these sounds were
uttered by a human being. He quickly provided himself
with a torch and, thus armed, proceeded to examine
the opening. Yes! there was the sound again! there
must be some sick person, dying in there! RoBIN-
SON's hair stood on end. and a cold perspiration burst
forth upon his forehead. He plucked up all his
courage, and, commending himself to the providential
care of God, he went forward. There — there it
lay! and as he looked more closely he made out,
by the flickering light of his torch, an enormous,
hideous, old he-goat, which seemed at the point
of death, and. as is sometimes the case with wild
animals, had retired to this cavern to end its
days. The poor brute could not rise upon its
feet; therefore ROBINSON allowed it to lie where
it was and went forward through a narrow
passage into the recesses of the cavern. All at
once he found himself in a hollow space some
twenty feet square, the walls and ceiling of
which glistened and shone like gold and
precious stones, reflecting the light of his
torch in the most fantastic manner. He
had discovered a crystal grotto! The floor
was dry and almost level. He had sud-
denly come upon that which he had so
long looked for — a place of refuge in
time of need. In this retreat, the savages
would not be able to find him, even
though they searched the whole island.
Next day he brought his stores and

weapons here. In the mean
time, the old goat had died
and RoniNSON dragged his
carcase, with much diffi-
culty, out of the cavern,
burying him in front of the
opening in the face of the
cliff.
A New Event.
For a whole month, in-
cessant storms of thunder
and lightning broke over the
island. One night, during
which the incessant roaring
of the waves gave RoiilN-
SON but little chance of
sleep, he started up in his
hammock with a cry of sur-
prise! He fancied he had
heard the sound of a can-
non firing. Yes! there it ..-•
was again! Kvidently a
signal of distress from some
vessel. RoiiiNS< >N sprang to
his feet. The night was pitch
dark. He clambered, however,
somehow, up to his hill-top, and
reached it just in time to see
another flash, out at sea, which
was followed by the third report.
Kvidently some ship was in the
greatest danger.
Towards morning the vio-
lence of the storm abated a little
and the sky gradually cleared. On
looking out seaward, ROBINSON
fancied he could discern a black
spot among the rocks. As the
day wore on, and the sky be-
came clearer, he was able to make
out distinctly that a large ship lay
stranded among the rocks, and the
waves were breaking clean over
her. What could he do to assist
the unfortunate mariners? He re-
solved to get his boat afloat and —
no matter what exertion it might
cost him — to put off to the
wreck. After getting his boat
afloat, he went up to the top of
the hill, once more, in order to
ascertain the exact direction in
which the wreck lay; when, shock-
ing to relate, the ship was no longer
visible. It had broken up! Not a
single living soul seemed to have
been saved from the wreck!
Exhausted with his exertions,
he went sadly home; still, as soon
as he had taken some necessary
refreshment, he went forth deter-
mined to make a further search.
Just as he stepped out of the
palm wood, on to the sea-shore,
he saw a magnificent dog. It
stood perfectly still and seemed
to gaze at him earnestly. ROHIN-
SON tried in vain to coax the
animal to come to him. He ran
whining away, looking back, as
if he wished ROBINSON to fol-
low him. This the latter did and,
at last, the dog stopped close
to the dead body of a cabin-
boy that lay on the beach.
All RoBFNSON's exertions
to restore life to the body

were in vain! The boy shewed no signs of returning
animation - - ROBINSON had indeed found a human
being; but he was dead! He dug a grave in the
sand, and the dog stretched himself out upon the
spot where his master lay buried, which he could
not be induced to quit. Next day, however, he greedily
ate some bread, that RoBlNSON offered him, and, after
several days watching, he was at last induced to follow his
new master home. RoBlNSON called his new friend TURK,
and found in him not only a companion and friend, but
also a faithful protector of his property.
The Landing of the Savages.
About a year may thus have passed away, when, one
morning in autumn, as ROBINSON climbed the hill just above
his dwelling, he was terrified to see the reflection of a fire that
had been made on the beach, on the east side of the island,
not a mile away from his dwelling. He was even able to
hear the shouts and yells of savages. His limbs were para-
lysed with fear. It was with some difficulty he saved him-
self from falling off his ladder. The sight that met his eyes
almost took away his senses. Some twelve Indians were
collected round a fire that they had prepared for cooking
their revolting meal. The tide had gone out. and three
canoes were lying high and dry on the beach. It was
evident that more savages had landed than were now
visible round the fire. Probably the others were roam-
ing about the island. They might therefore, at any
moment, discover his fortress. In feverish haste he
returned to his home, and taking his weapons in his
hand, determined to defend himself to the utmost
against these inhuman monsters. But listen as he
might, not a sound was to be heard. He waited
thus for hours, in mortal terror the whole time; but
in vain. During this period of keen anxiety he raised
his thoughts to the Most High, Who had so often
before saved him in such wonderful ways. His ex-
citement cooled down to a certain extent. Still
at any cost he must put an end to this terrible
^ uncertainty. Again he mounted the hill, and.
laying himself flat upon the ground,


crept a short distance forward. From this
point of observation, he was able to overlook
the place where he had seen the savages. They
were fourteen in number. They had just risen
from their meal and were dancing, with the
most wonderful springs and yells, around the fire,
which was on the point of going out. He could
follow every movement with the naked eye. The flood
tide was now coming in. The cannibals, jumping up,
hastened to their boats; and, rowing quickly round the
point of the island, soon reached the open sea, where
they were gradually lost to sight. ROBINSON now ven-
tured to raise himself from the ground; but his peace
of mind was gone. He was convinced that the savages
would come back again; that his freedom —
nay, more, his life — was in the greatest
danger. For weeks he did not venture to go
beyond the enclosure surrounding his for-
tress. His solitude seemed now doubly pain-
ful to him. His longing desire for the com-
panionship of some human being had never
been so intense as it grew to be during the
year immediately following this event. — The
autumn had come round again. One morn-
ing as ROBINSON went out, armed as usual,
to look from the top of his hill round the
island, he observed — and his heart seemed
to cease beating at the sight — on the
small tongue of land, just beyond the
wood on the beach, where the fittle creek
ran in, three canoes belonging to the sav-
ages. He quickly clambered up to the top
of the hill, and, looking to-
wards the beach, he
espied about twen-
ty savages sitting
round a fire.
Others had just
brought two
captives from
the canoes
and were en-
gaged in loos-
ening their
bonds. The sa-
vages fell upon
the first of these
victims and kill-
ed him with their
clubs. Whilst they
were thus engaged^
with the one, Roiim-
soN saw the second pri-

soner suddenly get free from his keepers, and
run with incredible swiftness towards his hid-
den dwelling. The savages set up a wild yell
of rage, and three of them, armed with bows
and arrows, started after the fugitive. ROIJIN-
SON at once saw the dangerous aspect
which affairs had assumed for him. Now
the creek alone separated them from him.
The poor fugitive leaped without hesitation
into the water and swam across the short
distance with great speed. Two of his
pursuers also sprang in after him; whilst
the third stopped, and returned to his com-
rades by the fire. The fugitive had by
this time reached the other side of the
creek, and fled towards the wood, but his
pursuers also came up out of the water,
and hastened after him. The stronger of
the two pursuers grad-
ually gained ground.
ROBINSON made
up his mind that
he would save
this wretched
being from
his enemies,
cost what it
might. The
fugitive now
approached
his hiding-
place. ROBIN-
SON stept for-
ward with his
weapons, from
amongst the trees.
Terrified by this
sudden and wonderful
apparition, the savage
stopped as if rooted to the ground, trembling in
every limb. ROBINSON no longer thought of him-
self, he sprang upon the first pursuer, and laid him
low with a single blow of his club; whilst the man
whom he had saved fell upon his knees before
him, and, raising his hands in a supplicatory
attitude, seemed to beg that his life might be
spared. The second pursuer now emerged from
the thicket. When he saw the strange being, in a
suit of goat-skins, and his comrade lying dead on
the ground, he was full of amazement He quickly
adjusted an arrow to his bow, but, too late! — a well-
aimed shot from ROBINSON'S bow at this moment
put an end to his life. The savage who had been
saved still remained on his knees, although ROBIN-
SON tried by encouraging signs to reassure him,
and to invite him to come nearer. He seemed
to expect nothing less than death, and did not
dare to stand up. ROBINSON, observing this,
broke off a green twig from one of the trees, and


«li
held it out towards the poor
wretch, who, seeing this symbol of peace,
appeared to gain courage. He approach-
ed, cautiously and slowly, falling from
'time to time on his knees, and kiss-
ing the ground.
, ROBINSON advanced towards him,
with the most friendly gestures, in
order to raise him from the ground.
But the poor savage threw himself
upon his face, and placed the right
foot of his deliverer upon his neck,
in token of submission. ROBINSON
raised him up, and held out his hand.
In the meantime, the savage who
had been felled with the club had
raised himself up into a sitting posture,
and gave a fearful yell. The fugitive,
on hearing this sound, sprang to his
feet trembling with fear. RoBlNSON
was about to shoot the savage with
his bow; but the one whom he had
saved gave him to understand that,
if he would trust him with a club,
he would dispatch the enemy. His
request was granted, and, with a
shout of revenge, the savage fell
upon his foe, and killed him with
a single blow.
ROBINSON lost no time in flying
to his grotto, his new friend follow-
ing in his steps. Once there he felt
more safe, for he was sure that the
savages would never discover it The
night passed away in quiet At dawn,
ROBINSON left the cave, and made his
way to the top of the cliff to see
what had become of the savages. —
He was delighted to find that the
canoes were gone and no trace of
/ X.

their owners was to be seen. - - The savages had
evidently left the island.
ROBINSON'S Young Guest.
When ROBINSON came to the grotto, where
he had left his friend asleep, the savage guest
came out to meet him, and again placed the
foot of his preserver on his neck. ROBINSON
raised him up, and contemplated with secret satis-
faction the well-knit and powerful figure of the man
whom he had saved. He called him FRIDAY, as that
was the day on which he had come to him. Tying
an apron of goats-skin round his waist, he took FRIDAY
with him to the spot where the savages had lighted
their fire. With strongly marked gestures, to show
how revolting and disgusting the sight was to him, he
commanded FRIDAY to collect and bury the remains of the
bloody feast, which were strewed all around; after which he took
him to his fortress. FRIDAY could hardly believe his senses
when he entered the hidden dwelling, and was shewn the
various articles; such as he had never seen before. At
first. ROBINSON considered it advisable to make his guest
sleep in the outer ring of his fortifications, and to
barricade himself in his cave with all his wea-
pons; as he did not think it prudent
to place himself quite at the mercy
of a savage. But very soon all dis-
trust vanished, and he became
convinced of the faithfulness and
loyalty of his swarthy com-
) panion.
FRIDAY followed his
master about as a son
does his father. ROBIN-
SON soon observed,
in the young savage,
not only a childlike
docility, but also
\ many other good
qualities; in ad-
dition to which
his adroitness
rendered him of
great use in carry-
ing on the house-
hold duties.
ROBINSON next
made clothes for his
companion out of goat
skins. It was very
amusing to watch
how this child of
the woods behaved
himself whilst put-
ting on these, to him,
foreign and most un-
comfortable articles.
\
.

Still his self-esteem was much flattered
at being allowed to wear the same gar-
ments as his master. At first it is true that
he was very awkward in them, and
seemed to be deprived of all freedom
of movement, but he soon got accustomed
to the unusual restraint. — He learnt with
surprising rapidity to understand what his
master said, and to repeat after him a number
of the words ordinarily used in conversation.
ROBINSON soon became very proud of his
pupil, who proved to be most handy at all
kinds of work, and tried to anticipate every
wish of his master. FRIDAY, too, was very
happy at his own rapid progress, and it was
with proud delight that he brought home to
his master any animal that he had killed.
If ROBINSON did by any chance praise his
skill, FRIDAY would dance for joy, and a smile
of pleasure would light up his whole face,
whilst his teeth gleamed between his red lips
like a row of pearls.
The society of this wild son of nature
procured for ROBINSON many a pleasant hour,
and he thankfully acknowledged how merciful
God, in His Providence, had been in send-
ing him such a companion. It was a great
pleasure to ROBINSON to teach the young
stranger a few words of his own language,
and to watch his surprise and amazement
at the furniture and weapons which he saw.
Above all, however, the fireplace, the table,
and the chair surprised FRIDAY most. One
day, when for the first time he saw the
violent bubbling and hissing of a pot of
boiling water, in which ROBINSON had placed
a piece of meat to cook, he was greatly
alarmed at this, to him, unusual sound, and
his master had much difficulty in preventing
him from trying to kill with his club the
animal which, as he thought, had come to
life in the pot. Nevertheless, when the meat
was boiled, FRIDAY soon learnt to partake
of it with great relish; although it was
some time before ROBINSON could persuade
him to make use of a spoon while eating.
But what delighted FRIDAY most, was,
when he could astonish his master by his
dexterity in swimming and climbing, or sur-
prise him by the extraordinary acuteness of
his senses of seeing, hearing, or smelling.
ROBINSON had also an opportunity of learn-

, -. tf,\\\ Vx
^ t\iV\V
ing many things from his companion, who proved to be a great adept
in capturing wild animals. He was never tired of watching FRIDAY'S
dexterity in shooting fish in the water with a bow and arrows, or
the rapidity with which he would collect a large dish of cray-fish.
ROBINSON as Schoolmaster.
There being now two mouths to feed, the field labour was
necessarily doubled; still it was only half as troublesome to
RoBlNSON, since he had a companion to work with him, and
to whom he could impart his thoughts, which he had for so
many years been obliged to keep to himself. He very soon
found that his assistant could appreciate and enter into most of
his ideas. ROBLNSON was very fond of telling his young-friend
stories of his former life; matters concerning his Knglish home,
the large towns, the domestic arrangements and habits of his
countrymen; whilst he would watch the perplexed amazement
of his listener, and whet his desire- for further knowledge.
FRIDAY soon learnt enough of his master's language
to be able to answer questions respecting his former
savage life and that of the rest of his tribe. On such
occasions ROBINSON also learnt many details con-
cerning the superstitious faiths of the savages, their
gods and their ideas of a future life. ROBINSON deter-
mined if possible to save his young friend from such
erroneous beliefs. When they sat together of an
evening, resting from their daily toil, on the hill
which ROBLNSON had used as his church, and the
latter talked of the works and nature of the
One Eternal God. he would often himself be
inspired with holy zeal. FRIDAY'S ears would
devour with avidity the words as they fell from
his master's lips, when he told him of the good-
ness and greatness of God, Who is everywhere
around us, Who created the world by His Al-
mighty power. Who orders and preserves all
things, Whose love and grace had been
manifested to himself in so many ways;
and when ROBINSON'S eyes glistened with
holy awe and inspiration. FRIDAY would
be moved to fall at his feet and em-
brace his knees. The savage was never
tired of hearing of the loving
,'\) , Father. Who was so much
better and greater than his own
cruel deities. And ROBINSON
himself felt that he became a
better and purer man after hav-
ing, on such occasions, endea-
voured to instil into the human
soul entrusted to his care, ideas
concerning all that is holy
and good.


The Wreck and its Treasures.
The rainy season, which had in the meantime set
in, was now nearly at an end, and ROBINSON, who was
always considering how he could render his fortification
more and more secure, determined to build a wall inside
the hedge he had planted. FRIDAY'S part of the busi-
ness was to bring stones to the spot — a proceeding which
was rendered all the easier by means of a kind of
sledge which ROBINSON had made, from fallen boughs
of trees, whilst the dog was pressed into the service
and made to help in drawing.
One very fine day, when they were both standing
upon a hill, on the south side of the island, the air being
remarkably clear, FRIDAY all at once began to jump about
and to dance, calling out all the time: — "There is my
country! There is my people!" ROBINSON gazed steadily
in the direction pointed out, and fancied that he too
could make out a very faint land line marked upon the
horizon. He turned to his companion: — "Should you
like to return to your country, FRIDAY?" "Will you come
with FRIDAY?" was the reply. "Oh, they would eat me
if I came there!'' said ROBINSON; but FRIDAY quickly
answered: — "Oh no! there are white men, like you,
there, already!'7
ROBINSON hardly trusted his ears; still FRIDAY
repeated what he had said, and, by dint of further
questioning, his master ascertained that there already
were, living amongst FRIDAY'S countrymen, seventeen
white men — shipwrecked mariners, who had been well
received by the natives and had been permitted to
share their hard lot.
This was indeed an important discovery! ROBINSON
at once resolved to build a boat which should be less
rickety than his little canoe, and capable of carrying
them both over to the distant land, in order to join
these white men. He did not doubt but that his own
inventive mind, if combined with the aid of their strong
arms, would render it possible for them to devise some
means by which they might all return to Europe.
ROBINSON and his man at once set about building
a new boat, at which task hope more than doubled
their power of work. By the end of three months,
they were in a position to make a first trial
voyage. ROBINSON taught FRIDAY how to ma-
nage the boat, and how to steer. They had
even fixed the time at which they would start
on their trip, when an extraordinary chain
of events caused them to change their plan.
One evening, a storm of unusual violence
broke over the island. Next morning, the
weather having become fine, and it being,
according to their calendar, a Sunday,
ROBINSON and his man went together to
the top of the hill which they called
their church. Arrived there, they both
uttered a cry of surprise; for there, at
the south end of the island and still
beaten by the roaring waves, lay the
wreck of a large ship.

ROBINSON became as pale as a sheet. '"Here,"
he said, "is a ship that might have saved me; but
it must needs get wrecked!" Followed by the faith-
ful FRIDAY, he strode off, as if in a dream, towards
the sea-shore, where he walked along the sand in a
southern direction, in the hope of finding some
shipwrecked person who had been saved. But he
did not meet with a soul.
ROBINSON, however, could not curb his impa-
tience to see what there was on board the vessel;
he therefore sprang
into the sea, as he was,
and swam to the wreck,
followed by FRIDAY;
a rope, which was
hanging down from
the deck, enabling
them to clamber on
board. Without taking
much notice of FRI-
DAY'S astonishment at
"the big house", as he
called the ship, Ro-
BINSON at once pro-
ceeded to examine the
hold, as far as the
water would allow
him to go. No
human being
was any-
where
visible; but there were
large stores of provisions
arms, gunpowder, imple-
ments and tools of vari-
ous kinds. What a pre-
cious find! With what de-
light did ROBINSON gaze
at these implements and
weapons. Why should he
hesitate to appropriate
any or all of these things;
as they must otherwise,
in the course of a few
days, become the prey of
the waves, when the ship broke up? They both swam
back to the shore and brought their boat round as quickly
as possible to the spot, loading her with such things as
seemed most valuable to them. When they had deposited
the first boatload on the shore, it occurred to ROBINSON
that a shower of rain might come and spoil a quantity of
the things; he therefore took the precaution of erecting
a kind of tent on the beach with the various pieces of
sailcloth that he had brought away with him. Whilst they
were thus engaged, night came on; but before entering
their fortress ROBINSON loaded a fowling piece, and fired

at one of the seagulls which were flying round
their, heads. The aim was good, and the seagull
fell; but so did FRIDAY also, from sheer terror. He lay
on the ground, trembling in every limb and ROBINSON
had much difficulty in persuading him to lay hold of
the weapon "in which thunder and lightning lived."
In the course of a few days ROBINSON managed
to bring off a great number of useful things, many
of which he had long pined for, from the wreck, be-
fore it went to pieces. By dint of hard work, he and
FRIDAY managed to stow them away safely in the grotto.
A Sanguinary Conflict.
ROBINSON was soon destined to find out the value
of the firearms. One morning, FRIDAY came in from the
beach, whither he had gone to fetch a turtle, with all the
signs of great alarm depicted on his countenance. Three
canoes full of savages were approaching the island!
ROBINSON quickly armed himself and his companion —
who had by this time learned to handle a gun with
great dexterity — with three guns and a brace of
pistols each, together with the necessary ammunition;
and then, they both mounted the cliff to make their
observations. With the aid of the telescope, ROBINSON
was able to see that there were twenty-one savages, and
that they had with them three prisoners, one of
whom was a white man! The canoes were appro-
aching the shore at a spot where the
bushes grew close down to the water's
edge, and ROBINSON, with FRIDAY, made
all haste through the forest to get down
to this place. They found that the sa-
vages had already landed. Nineteen of
them were seated round a fire. One of
their prisoners they had by this time
killed and two of their number were
now dragging the white man from the
canoes. ROBINSON advanced very cau-
tiously towards them, and, when he
was near enough, gave FRIDAY the
word to "fire." When the smoke
cleared away, it was seen that two
of the savages had fallen, whilst the
rest jumped to their feet with evident
signs of terror. Two more shots, and
again two savages fell. The rest, who
were unhurt, rushed about wildly,
like mad creatures, shouting and yell-
ing. Three more were killed from the
ambush, before ROBINSON thought it
safe to sally forth, and shew himself.
FRIDAY and his master, shouting
at the top of their voices, now rushed
out from their hiding place into the
midst of the savages, who fled in
all directions, endeavouring to
regain their canoes. ROBINSON

9~g
OyOo*

took out his knife, quickly cut
through the withies with which
the white man was bound,
and thrust a sabre and
pistol into his hands. By
this time some of the sa-
vages had recovered
their presence of
mind, and, headed
by a giant wielding
a huge club, made
an attack upon Ro-
BINSON'S party. RO-
BINSON and FRIDAY
again fired, and each
killed his man; but
the huge savage still
came on, making for
the white man whom
they had released. He
being weak and stiff, from
the manner in which his limbs
had been tied, strove in vain to
ward off, with his sword, the attacks of this
monster. The savage closed with his oppo-
nent and the white man would have been


lost, had he not made use of his
pistol. With the report, the giant
fell to the ground, and the other
could now assist RoiUNSON
with his sword.
The conflict was soon
over. Those of the savages
who succeeded in reach-
ing the canoes pushed
off from the shore in
two of them; whilst
ROBINSON, with FRI-
DAY, jumped into the
third in order to pur-
sue the flying foe.
When, however, they
got into the boat, they
were surprised to find
in it a helpless prisoner —
an old Indian almost dead
with fright and tied in such
a cruel manner, that he really
had very little life left in him. Ro-
BlNSON at once cut his bonds and at this
moment FRIDAY — whose attention had till
now been fixed upon the fugitives — threw
himself at the feet of the
old man, kissed him, em-
braced him, hugged him,
cried, laughed, nolloaed,
jumped about, danced,
sang; then cried again,
wrung his hands, beat his
breast and head, and then
sang and jumped about
again like a madman. Fi-
nally he clasped ROBIN-
SON'S knees, and when he
had come to himself a little,
shrieked, rather than said,
"This my father, Sir!"
ROUINSON was not a
little surprised and delight-
ed to hear this. He helped
in rubbing and chafing the

old man's limbs, which were stiff and numb
from the manner in which they had been tied,
and gave him a little rum to drink, to enable
him to bear being lifted on shore. There
ROBINSON also gave some refreshment to the
white man, who turned out to be a Spaniard,
and one of the shipwrecked men whom
ROBINSON and FRIDAY had for months been
making preparations to go in search of. As
the rescued men were incapable, owing to
the extent to which their limbs were swollen,
of walking the distance to the cave, a kind
of litter was constructed, on which ROBINSON
and FRIDAY carried them; and very soon after
their arrival, they were fast asleep.
Next morning, the Spaniard related to
ROBINSON all that had happened to him and
his companions, from the day on which they
lost their ship, until the present time; after
he had heard all, ROBINSON decided that
the Spaniard, with FRIDAY'S father, should
take the boat, and «•.*•i^- g0 to
bring theEuropeans over to this fruitful island.
As soon as they had started, ROBINSON
reflected that it would be necessary to make
provision for the large number of men who
would soon be living on the island. He
therefore set about sowing a larger crop
than any he had sown hitherto. — The things
he had saved from the wreck were very
useful to him in this. He managed to put
together a very serviceable plough, to which
he yoked a team of four goats.
The Mutineers.
Early one morning, about a week after
the boat had gone away. ROBINSON was ly-
ing asleep in his hammock, when he was wa-
kened by the joyful voice of FRIDAY exclaim-
ing "Sir! they have come! they have come!"
ROBINSON hurried up to the top of the cliff.


whither FRIDAY had preceded him, and there
he certainly could see a boat approaching
the island; but in a direction from which it
was hardly possible that the Spaniards should
come. And, moreover, as he made a sweep
round the horizon with his telescope, he
saw, far out at sea, a ship lying off the island,
in a south-easterly direction.
His first feeling of joyful hope that
at last an opportunity offered of leaving the
island, lasted but for a short time; as he
could see that there were eleven men in
the boat, of whom three were bound hand
and foot, and were lying side by side under
the thwarts. This strange circumstance
warned him to be cautious. Therefore he
armed both himself and FRIDAY, .and as.
judging from the direction in which it was
being steered towards the shore, the boat
would land just at the spot where the
wood came close down to the water's edge,
where the conflict with the savages had
lately taken place, they both of them made
their way down there. From this place
of ambush, they were able to see that
the three men who were bound were sitting
silent and dejected under a tree; whilst some
of the others, who were evidently English
sailors, appeared to be sleeping by the boat.
As there was no one else to be seen, ROBIN-
SON rightly supposed that the rest of the
party had gone to explore the interior of
the island. He therefore gave FRIDAY a sign,
and both of them crept down to the pri-
soners, who looked greatly alarmed when
they saw two strange figures, armed to the
teeth, come out of the bushes towards
them. ROBINSON, however, made signs that
they should remain perfectly still, and en-
quired who they were? The men answered
that they were the captain, mate, and a pas-
senger belonging to the ship lying in the
offing. That the crew had mutinied, taking
possession of the vessel, and had at first
intended to kill their officers, but had changed
their minds, and had brought them to this
island for the purpose of leaving them there
in case it should prove uninhabited. Robin-
son at once promised to do all he could
to deliver them, if in return they would
undertake to carry him and his companions
back to Europe.
Naturally this proposal was joyfully
accepted; ROBINSON released the three men

from the cords with which they were bound and gave
each of them a gun with some ammunition. "Fortu-
nately, the villains have only brought two guns with
them," exlaimed the captain with glee; "and they
cannot escape us, as the tide has gone out, leaving
their boat high and dry upon the sand." All at once
voices were heard approaching. ROBINSON and his
party fired, directly the new comers emerged from
the wood, killing two out of three; whilst the third
fell wounded. The watchers in the boat, as they had no
arms, gave but little trouble and were soon secured.
"We have been in luck," said the captain. "The
first and the last men who fell were the worst cha-
racters of the lot. The rest may be pardoned if they
will submit."
The prisoners were now bound hand and foot;
whilst the same course was pursued towards the
others, who came out of the wood later on, and were
taken captive before they had any clear idea of what
had occurred. Two of the prisoners who were de-
clared by the captain to be the least guilty were now
released from their bonds, and were furnished with
the guns that had been found in the boat. FRIDAY was
sent up to the cave to fetch some provisions; whilst
the rest of the party were employed in dragging the
dead bodies into the wood. When these preparations
had all been made, all hands ate and drank, waiting
for the next move on the part of those on board the
ship. Towards evening, several guns were heard from
the ship and then another boat was seen to shove off
from her side. There were ten men in her; and when
the captain could make them out clearly with the
glass, he turned to ROBINSON and told him that
two of them were too dangerous to be spared.
These were, TOM FRY and WILL ATKINS, the
boatswain's mate.
When the boat touched the shore, her crew
jumped out, and ran to and fro upon the beach,
shouting and holloaing for their missing comrades.
When they found the boat lying deserted they could
not make it out. However, as they got no answer to
their shouts, they went towards the wood, firing
their pistols as signals. Suddenly a couple of
shots were heard, and two of the mutineers
fell to the ground, killed by the bullets of the
captain and the mate. "Stand! and throw down
your arms, or you are all dead men!" cried
ROBINSON. The sudden fate which had be-
fallen two of their comrades intimidated the
others, who, in their terror, sought in vain
to make out where their opponents were
hidden. After a little hesitation, they saw
there was nothing for it but to obey; and.
one by one, they commenced to throw
away their swords and their pistols on
the sand. ROBINSON now gave a sign,
and his small party — seven men
against eight — came out of their hid-
ing place in the thicket. "Remain at

the present!" called ROBINSON back into the
wood, as though giving a parting word of
command to a body of men concealed there;
and this manoeuvre produced the desired
effect, for not one of the new comers attempt-
ed to make the slightest resistance to being
bound.
The Capture of the Ship.
The prisoners were now taken for the
night to the fortress, whilst those who could
least be trusted, were confined in the crystal
grotto. After holding a consultation with
the captain. ROBINSON offered most of the I
prisoners a free pardon, provided that they j
would place themselves under the orders
of the captain, and assist in recapturing the
ship. They gave the most profuse assur-
ances of their fidelity, whilst two hostages
were selected, who were to remain with
ROBINSON, and should answer with their
lives for the good behaviour of the rest.
The captain then waited until the next
evening when, taking with him twelve men,
of whom he put six in each boat, he
started for the ship. It was a ticklish mo-
ment when the watch on deck hailed
them and they had to reply; still they ma-
naged to disarm the suspicions of those
on deck. The captain and the mate soon
reached the deck, and a couple of powerful
strokes from their cutlasses silenced the
watch. In the meanwhile, the crew of
the other boat had come alongside, and,
climbing on board, went forward to the
cook's galley, where they made prisoners of
the three men whom they found there. The
noise caused by all this awoke the rest of
the mutineers. A few heads appeared at
the forescuttle, but they were as quickly with-
drawn, and all resistance in the body of the
ship ceased. The rest of the crew, after a
faint-hearted struggle, soon threw down their
arms and yielded; and the firing of seven
guns, which was the signal agreed upon,
gave ROBINSON notice of the success of the
expedition, as also that the captain was again
master of his vessel.
Next morning, the meeting between
Robinson and the captain was most joy-
ous, and thankfully did the latter embrace
his deliverer. There lay the noble vessel,
and gladly would ROBINSON have at once
gone on board and set sail for Europe,
but the mutely appealing looks of Friday
reminded him that he must still wait
awhile. The time which elapsed before the
return of the Spaniards was spent in ex-
plaining to his guests how ROBINSON had
managed to procure the means of living
on the island, since he had been cast away,
at which narration all were much entertained
and surprised. But a sad shock was in
store for poor FRIDAY. When the Spaniards
did at last return, he sought in vain amidst
their number for his father! The old man

had died on the return voyage to the is-
land! There was now therefore nothing to
keep FRIDAY from following ROBINSON to the
furthest ends of the earth. It was not with-
out a feeling of regret that ROBINSON tore
himself away from the spot where he had
spent eight and twenty years, two months,
and nineteen days of his life; where he
had passed eighteen years in solitude and
labour, and where he had learnt to become a
useful member of society. Seven of the Spa-
niards, who were, at their own request, left
upon the island to retain possession of it for
ROBINSON, stood upon the beach waving a
farewell greeting to the fast receding ship,
on whose deck stood the "Lord of the Isle,"
with his dog by his side and his parrot on
his shoulder; whilst from time to time he
brushed away a tear, which would spring
unbidden to his eyes.
At Home again.
The voyage to Europe was a prosperous
and rapid one. First they came to the
Spanish coast, where they parted
from their ten Spanish
guests and then it
was not long be-
fore the white
cliffs of old
England
came in
sight.
When
ROBINSON w
first came'
home, he
was as
perfect a
stranger
as if he
had never
been in
Hull be-
fore.
However,
he at last
came
across a
cousin,
who
rememb-
ered
something
about him, and who
gave him an account of what had taken
place in the family since he had been away.

His mother was dead; but his father was
still alive. The cousin accompanied him and
FRIDAY, who, like his master, was now
dressed in European clothes, to the house
where ROBINSON'S father lived. "Here is
a gentleman who wishes to speak to you,
uncle!" were the words in which he address-
ed a greyhaired, helpless old man, who
was sitting in an armchair by the fireside.
All at once, the supposed stranger fell at
the feet of the old man. and, grasping his
knees, cried in a voice broken with sobs: —
"I am ROBINSON! your long lost son, Father!
but I am now quite a different being! Will
you not forgive me?" "Gracious God!" ex-
claimed the old man. "Bless you my son;
and thanks be to Thee, Heavenly Father,
that Thou hast allowed me to see this
day! Now I can die in peace!"
Great were the rejoicings in Hull when
it was known that ROBINSON had safely
returned; for the family were very much
respected in the town. The neighbours
flocked in to see the long lost son, and he
had to tell the tale of his adventures
over and over again.
ROBINSON and FRIDAY lived
to a good old age;
many a time was
ROBINSON called
upon to tell
the tale
of his
life on
the is-
land to
hundreds
of eager
little
listeners,
whom
he never
failed to
warn
against
the evils
of idle-
ness and
thought-
lessness,
so that
they
mightbe
spared
passing
through the rough
school of adversity in which he had been
obliged to serve so severe an apprenticeship.

{obinson leaves
lome.
ROKINSON CRUSOE was the son of
a respectable merchant in Hull. The
V kindness of his parents had made his life very happy.
His heart was not a bad one; but his love of idleness
and his thoughtlessness gave his good parents a great deal
of anxiety. Instead of working and learning his lessons,
in order to become a clever man when he grew up, his
chief pleasure was to idle about the quays. Whenever
he did take a book in his hand, his thoughts were
always wandering away to the forest of masts in
the harbour. His one idea was to go to sea and
to make long journeys into distant countries;
chiefly because he hoped, by this means, to evade
the necessity for working and doing his duty. He
begged of his father to let him go to sea. But that
worthy man, who well knew the true reason of his
son's desire to travel, insisted ^Jthat he should
first learn some occupation f:' thoroughly,
and, when he had done that,
n
D
\
\

\
his father would not stand in the way of his desires;
but that, unless he chose to work, he would in
vain seek to be happy in this world. His father told
him: - - "If, however, you do, ungratefully, quit your
parents, contrary to their expressed wish, you will cause them to
die of grief. We have already lost two sons and you are the last
child left to us. It is your duty to be a comfort and a support to
us in our old age. You know that I am no longer strong and
hearty. Of one thing you may be quite certain — no one who
despises God's commandments can
prosper in this world."
Whenever he had been thus talked
to, RoKtNSON would mend his ways for
a short time; but his thoughtlessness
very soon caused him to forget the
remonstrances and advice of his father, as
well as the tears of his mother. Foreign
countries seemed, to his mind, to be the
more delightful, in proportion as his work
at home became distasteful to him. As
ill-luck would have it, one day, when he
was lounging round the docks as usual, he
met a schoolfellow who was about to start on
a voyage to London in a ship belonging to
l>


his
father,
and who
urged him to
come with them. "If
the life there does not
please you, you can
but return to Hull!"
said his schoolfellow.
This great temptation
ROISINSC IN could not
withstand. Therefore,
without for a moment con-
sidering the anxiety he would
cause his parents thereby, he
accepted the offer, and, without
sending word to say where
he was, or what had be-
come of him, he quitted
home. When, far out at
sea. he saw the church-
spires of his native town
disappearing in the mists of the evening,
he did feel some remorse; but it was then
too late: and with this reflection he tried to
satisfy his conscience.
Storm and Shipwreck.
Everything went well on the voyage,
until the sixth day, when they had come
within sight of Yarmouth; but here they
were obliged to remain and to cast anchor,
in consequence of headwinds. On the eighth
day a very violent storm came on, and they
had to take in all the sails.
The wind roared and whistled. The
captain ordered the best bower anchor
to be let go. ROBINSON became more
and more frightened, and, to add to all
his miseries, he felt dreadfully sea-sick.
He clambered up, out of the forcastle, on
to deck, where a fearful sight met his eyes.
The waves were running mountains high and
broke from time to time over the ship, bury-
ing her in an avalanche of water. The
sailors, who went past him, had despair
written on their faces, and they pushed the
idler roughly out of their way. His knees
tottered. His whole body trembled with
mortal terror, whilst qualms of conscience
tortured him; now, for the first time, he
began to call to mind the warnings of his
father and the sorrow' and anxiety he had
caused his mother. He bitterly and in truth
repented the step he had taken. He saw
that he was being punished for his wicked-
ness.
The fury of the storm increased as the
day went on. Towards evening, it was found
necessary to lower the topmasts. A dis-
masted bark drifted past them at a short
distance. Close to the coast, he saw a ship
founder, and, in the most abject terror, he
vowed that, if God would only save him
this once, he would return to his parents.
When midnight approached, a leak was dis-
covered in the bottom of the ship. The
water already stood four feet deep in the
hold. Everybody was ordered to help
in working the pumps. The boatswain shook
ROBINSON roughly, in order to awaken
him out of the kind of stupor into which
he had fallen. There was no help for it;
he had to take his turn at the pumps with
the rest. But^ notwithstanding all the exer-
tions that were made, the water kept on rising
in the ship's hold and she began visibly to
could give them any help
was in sight. Signal guns
were fired every minute.
A boat was lowered; but it
was immediately swamped.
Even the oldest and most
weatherbeaten sailors fell on
their knees and prayed God
to help them; but no prayer
came from ROBINSON'S lips.
He felt that he was me-
rely suffering God's just
punishment for his sins.
Overcome with despair, he
fainted away, and all was a
blank.
Saved.
Suddenly ROBINSON felt
himself seized in a powerful
grasp and dragged by main
force into a boat. Some
brave men who belonged
to a ship, which he had
been unable to see, but who 1 -
were not too far away to
hear the minute guns, had risked their lives to save
those who were in danger. They had long fought in
vain against the wind and the waves; but at last the
storm stilled a little. They were able to get near the
sinking ship and they succeeded in laying hold of
a rope that was thrown out to them. They were only
just in time. The kindhearted boatswain had the thought-
fulness to pick up ROBINSON as he lay senseless on the
deck and to lower him into the boat. The whole crew
were taken off in the same way and thus saved. The
sailors now pushed off quickly from the fated vessel,
which only remained a few minutes longer above the
water. ROBINSON raised a cry of horror as he saw
her sink. Fortunately, the sailors were able to force the
boat through the foaming breakers on to the beach,
where the whole of the party landed safely. Full of
joy and gratitude, the shipwrecked men thanked their
preservers. Some humane merchants, in Yarmouth,
took care of the sufferers, providing them with food
and clothing and furnishing them with money to enable
them to continue their journey.
ROBINSON had here an opportunity of returning
to his parents, who would have received him with
joy and affection. The captain of the ship, now, for
the first time, learnt that he had quitted home without
the knowledge of his parents and spoke to him very
seriously on the subject; but the sailors, who, after
they had been on shore a little while, forgot all about
the danger they had escaped from, made fun of
the milksop, whose courage had been so shortlived;
and their jeers caused ROHINSON to forget all his good
resolutions. He accompanied his friend to London.
v \m\.\

Coast.
ROBINSON now wandered about London,
where the busy life intoxicated his senses!
His sole thought was how to become rich
without being obliged to work as a sailor.
In the meantime, his small stock of
money was very soon spent in amusements
of different kinds- with his ship companions
and he began to feel the pangs of hunger.
All at once, he remembered that a rich
relative of his mother lived in LONDON.
He told the kind hearted merchant the
whole of his story, without however men-
tioning the disgraceful way in which he
had run away from home. This excellent
man, who was under obligations to ROBIN-
SON's father for some kindness the latter
had shewn him, believed ROBINSON'S story,
and lent him twenty pounds.
A fortunate chance just at this time
caused ROBINSON to make the acquaintance
of a ship-captain, who had lately returned
from Guinea, where he had done a good
stroke of business and who was on the point
of making a second voyage thither. He
offered to take ROBINSON with him on his
next voyage, advising him to lay out. in the
meantime, the greater part of his ready
money in the purchase of glass beads, toys,
knives and axes; in order that when they
arrived, he might be in a position to barter
them with the natives on the coast for
gold dust and ivory. One fine evening in
autumn, the good ship HOPE put to sea,
with the truant on board.
Attacked by Pirates.
The wind being favourable, they soon
reached the Canary islands; when, one
morning, the whole crew were called on
deck. The captain had for a long time been
watching a large, pirate-looking vessel,
which was coming, under a crowd of canvas,
in the direction of the HOPE.
The chase continued for nearly eight
hours. However the pirate kept creeping
closer and closer, until, at three o'clock in the

s

now obliged to perform the most menial services without com-
plaining. He planned many modes of escape; but none of them
proved feasible. He lived in the hope that the pirate captain
might perhaps take him to sea with him, and that then, a
Christian ship might defeat them, and thus he might regain
his liberty. But his master never took him when he went
on one of his piratical excursions.
As ROBINSON shewed himself to be a great adept in
the art of fishing, the overseer MULEY often took him with
him. One day his master proposed to go fishing with a
few friends. ROBINSON was to get every thing ready,
to put plenty to eat and drink on board the ship's long
boat, as well as some fowling-pieces and gunpowder.
The party were going out to shoot sea-fowl, and ROBINSON,
together with MULEY and a boy named XURY. were to
accompany them. When however all was ready for a
start, the friends sent word to say that they could not
go out shooting, but that they would come over and
spend the evening with the pirate. He therefore bade the
overseer take ROBINSON and XURY and go out in the
boat to catch a good dish of fish for supper.
ROBINSON'S Escape.
Scarcely had ROBINSON heard the orders that were
given, before a plan occurred to him by which he might
regain his freedom. He secreted a few tools and some
more food in the boat and started in good spirits with
MULEY and XURY. The provisions for the shooting party
had also, fortunately, been left in the boat. When they got
outside the harbour, they set to work and cast out the nets,
but did not catch anything. ROBINSON, who was looked
upon as the best fisherman, advised that they should go further
out to sea and handed over the rudder to XURY. "Now
or never," he said to himself when he saw that they were about
and thehpjjooping down, as
though m>werepicking up
something, he suddenly
seized the overseer
with all his might,
round the waist
and threw him
overboard. XURY
sprang to his feet
in a fright. But
MULEY, whom
ROBINSON knew
to be
a mile and a half from land.
a good
came to the s'ur-
face again and
swam with loud
cries after the boat.
ROBINSON however
at once seized one ot
the loaded guns and
pointing it atMuLtiv called

He stole quietly behind MULEY
out in a stern voice: "If you
come near the boat I will
shoot you through the head,
for I am resolved to have
my liberty; but if you
swim to land — the
sea is quite calm —
you have nothing to
fear from me." At
first he turned the
boat's head as if
he were making for
the shores of Spain;
as soon, however, as
MULEY was no longer
visible, ROBINSON turn-
ed the boat's head
round in a southerly
direction, keeping along
the coast of Africa. With
favourable winds they conti-
nued in this way for five days,
They struggled with the
energy of despair against
the raging waters that
threatened to engulph the
boat and drove it towards
the beach; whilst they saw
the remains of their late
ship become a prey to
the waves. Suddenly how-
ever a huge breaker came
rushing along. A heart-
rending shriek was heard,
and, in an instant, the boat
was upset, whilst the men
it had contained were bat-
tling with the seething,
raging waters. ROBINSON
also went down with the
rest, but he quickly suc-
ceeded in getting up to
the surface again, where he
took a deep breath. In the /
next instant, he was caught M
by the following wave and //
^t^^/


dragged down below the water. Still
he had seen the shore and his lungs
were full of air, so he put forth all the
strength he had left, in a vigorous endeavour
to reach the beach. At last he felt a severe
blow on his chest. He had been thrown upon
the surface of a large, flat rock and would have
been lost if he had not recovered his senses
before the following wave came up to him.
He was just able, by crawling forward
on his hands and knees, clinging all the
time to every unevenness in the stone,
to reach a place of safety. But then
he sank back in a fainting fit which
lasted for some hours. At last con-
sciousness returned. He felt a wonderful
sense of happiness steal over him. He
knew that he was saved. But where was he?
The boat and the ship had both disappeared.
He alone was left. He tottered towards the top of
the cliffs, where, overcome with a sense of deep gratitude
for his escape and of joy at the scene around him, he fell
upon his knees and, with tears in his eyes, thanked the
Almighty for his deliverance from so terrible a death.
All at once it occurred to him that, at any moment, wild
beasts or savages might come out of the forest and attack
him. His first thought was to fly. But where should he
run to? He looked round to see what he should do. Night
would soon come on. He fancied he heard the roaring of
some wild beast in the distance. His hair stood on end with
defend himself. He had saved nothing but the
clothes he had on. Every sound terrified him.
In this wretched state he passed the rest of the
day, and when night came on he climbed up
into a high tree with wide-spreading branches,
and thickly covered with leaves, where he sought,
amidst the foliage, to find a safe resting-place
for the night.
When ROBINSON awoke the next morning,
his eyes rested upon the beautiful scene which
lay spread out in all its glory before him; but
hunger and thirst made the first claims upon him,
and he felt pain and stiffness in all his limbs. He
came down from the tree. No living thing appear-
ed to be about, except a few parrots which flew
screaming away. He was surrounded by an im-
penetrable thicket of bushes. Rare flowers hung

down from the trees over his head; but he
I i fl**^if could neither find any fruit, nor a spring of
** I ^»J water to quench his thirst. Suddenly he stop-
ped as if turned to stone. Only a few paces
distant from him, he saw, coiled round a tree-
stem, a huge snake. In mortal terror he fled
from the spot. All his limbs trembled. The
dread of wild animals was now constantly before
his mind. He climbed one of the tallest trees to
look round. He found that he was on a middling-
sized island; but he could not see any houses,
nor any traces of smoke. A feeling of complete
solitude came over him. The sun now began
to be very powerful, so he took the wide leaves
from "off a banana-tree and made himself a hat
out of them; and on the next day he constructed
an umbrella out of the same material, in order
that he might have some protection from the
intense heat of the mid-day sun. But above
all things it was necessary for him to
procure food and clothing. At last he
came across a cocoa-nut palm, the water
contained in the fruit of which served
both to still his hunger and to quench
his thirst.
His dread of exposure to the inclemen-
cy of the weather during the coming winter
season, increased daily. However, he dis-
covered a cave, which he thoroughly cleared
out; and although this cost him a great deal
of labour, it afforded him a place to live in.
It was quite time that he did so, for one
night he was awakened from his sleep by
a dreadful storm of thunder and lightning
that was raging over the island. He was
almost stunned by one clap louder than the
rest, and he found that the lightning had
struck a clump of trees, — fortunately stand-
ing separate from the mass of the forest,—
and had set a dry stem on fire. In a
very short time all the trees composing
the group were in flames. Tongues of fire
shot forth in the darkness. Burning branches
came tumbling to the ground, and the wind
carried a shower of sparks out seaward.
This spectacle was very grand, but it gave
RONINSON an idea of how different a storm
on his island was to those he had been
accustomed to at home. On one occasion,
when he was out hunting, he heard a sound
that was very familiar to him. It was the
bleating of goats, of which animals a large
herd soon ran past the place where he
was hidden. Their bleating was a delicious
sound to his ears, as it led him to hope
that he might find some human beings on
the island. Filled with a longing for the
society of mankind, he wandered for days
about the island; but could not find any
traces of men. One day exhausted by his
exertions, he threw himself down upon the
ground. But now again his ears were greeted
with the familiar sound of the whimpering of
a goat, which seemed to him like a voice
from his own home. He forced his way
through the bushes and there he found an
old she-goat that had broken its leg by a fall
and was trying to descend the cliff. Having
only three legs she could not run very fast,
and ROBINSON easily overtook her. which
delighted him greatly. He carried her on
his back to where his cave was Here he
set the poor beast's leg and having tied it
up with a piece of linen torn off his shirt.
he prepared a soft bed of dry grass for the
patient to lie upon. The goat soon learned
to understand that he did not mean to do
her any harm, and became quite tame.
During one of his excursions, he had
come upon a very large herd of goats, and,
by following the prints of their footsteps,
he arrived at last at a spot where a pool
of salt water had been dried up by the sun,
and he became by this means possessed of a
supply of a condiment which he had so
long been obliged to do without in his food.
ROBINSON determined to invent a
means of catching some of the goats alive.
For this purpose he made a lasso, with
some long pieces of bass which he took
from one of the trees on the island, and,
taking up his post on the road which the
goats travelled to go to the salt-lick, he
succeeded in catching a full grown she-goat
.
A young kid remained by her side, whilst
the rest of the herd fled in all directions.
ROBINSON put the mother on his shoulders,
and carried her to his cave, whilst the kid
followed him like a dog. On his way he
was overtaken by a heavy storm. The rain
poured down in torrents, so that he was com-
pletely wet through before he reached home
with his captives. He attempted to dry
his clothes, as best he could, at his fire; but
it was not much use, as he had no dry ones
to put on.
ROBINSON'S Illness.
During the night he awoke, feeling very
feverish, and when morning came, it was
with the greatest difficulty he was able to
make his way to the spring. By mid-day
he was much worse, and, the water being
all finished, he was tormented by a dread-
ful thirst. But now he was no longer capable
of leaving his bed. The fever increased from
hour to hour. His head seemed as if it
must split, so terribly did it ache. He tossed
about restlessly on his bed and dug his
hands into the sandy walls of his cave. The
goats came now and then to gaze at him,
as though they felt sorry for him, although
their bleating often disturbed him sadly;
still he could no longer even rise from
the place where he lay to go to them. He
might otherwise have quenched his thirst
from the distended udder of the mother
foat. A painful dread of thus dying of
unger and thirst tormented him day and
night. He remembered how tenderly his
mother used to nurse him when he was ill.
How she would watch for days at his bedside,
and how those dear parents, whom he had
quitted with such ingratitude, rejoiced at his
recovery. In the ravings of delirium, he
seemed to see the figure of his father, bent
pale with anxiety. In his helpless solitude
he stretched forth his arms to them; but
they appeared to turn away from him. The
fever became worse and worse, his breath
came in gasps, and his lips burnt like live
coals. In his terror, he tried to pray; but
the words seemed to die away upon his
lips. He felt that he was a miserable sinner,
and could not pluck up courage to call upon
God to help him. A frenzied despair took
possession of him. He looked upon him-
self as deserted by God and man; and al-
though he knew that his punishment was
a just one. it was not the less terrible. What
troubled him most was that no one
would weep for his loss; no one
would miss him. His eyes
overflowed with tears, and
his heart was filled with
real penitence. Invol-
untarily, his hands
folded themselves,
and he prayed God
that his sins might
be forgiven him.
After this he fell
into a refreshing
sleep, and. when
he awoke, found
that the fever
had left him.
Recovery.
His recovery
proceeded very slow-
ly; still, in a few days
he was so far conva-
lescent, that, with the aid
of a stick, he managed to go
down and look after the welfare of his
goats, and to attend to their wants. How
delicious it was to take a deep draught
of the fresh, warm milk, which his goats
supplied in such abundance. He was soon
strong enough to take down some food
and water for his live stock, who had been
suffering great privations during his illness.
The feeling of gratitude, which he felt at his
recovery from illness, enabled him now. to
submit, even to his solitary condition, with-
out repining. He had become a totally
altered being. He had learnt to cast all his
care upon God. who had saved him from
such great dangers. He rapidly regained
his strength, and was soon able to resume
his ordinary occupations. He determined

to make a thick hedge round his dwelling,
and for this purpose he made use of the
prickly cactus, which he planted all round
the entrance to his cave.
Eruption of the Volcano.
A few days after he had finished plant-
ing this hedge, he was awakened by a
violent trembling of the earth, which continu-
ed throughout the whole day, and increased
in force. He became terribly alarmed, being
afraid lest he should be buried alive in his
cave, by the falling masses of earth. At mid-
day he observed that a mountain,
at no great distance, began to
give forth dense masses of
smoke and by the even-
ing the volcano burst
forth with terrific vio-
lence. A huge col-
umn of smoke shot
up into the air;
thick showers of
sparks and ashes
fell upon the is-
land; stones and
large masses of
rock were hurl-
ed from the cra-
ter to consider-
able distances.
The heavens be-
came darkened,
and a fierce storm
raged round the
summit of the vol-
cano. High, rocky
cliffs came tumbling
down with a loud crash.
The violence of the storm kept
on increasing, and the sea raged in all
its fury. ROBINSON fled into the interior
of the country, although he did not
know where to go for safety, as the
whole island seemed to tremble under his
feet with the violent shocks of the earth-
quake. Thus he hurried on, over hill and
dale. At last, thoroughly worn out by terror
and exertion, he fell to the ground. He
must have lain thus an entire day. When
he again recovered consciousness, the earth-
quake and the eruption of the volcano were
at an end. He made his way back to his
cave, and found, to his delight, that it had
not suffered, though all around were to be
seen traces of the terrible storm that had
been raging.
ROBINSON'S entire attention was now directed towards pro-
viding a sufficient stock of wood to last him, as fuel, through-
out the whole of the rainy season, which he now knew to be
approaching. The diy branches of the trees, which he found
strewed about, served his purpose admirably, and, with the aid of
A rough sledge, which he managed to construct by tying together
some of the larger limbs of trees, he conveyed great quantities
of these branches to a projecting ledge of rock, beneath which
he piled them up. His chief care now was to construct a proper
fireplace, so that his fuel might be used with as little waste as
possible.
He had discovered a bed of clay under the sand, not far
from the cave, and, with the aid of his wooden spade, he cut
out a number of pieces in the shape of bricks, which he first
dried in the sun and then burnt in his fire. With another kind
of earth, which he used as mortar, and these bricks, he built
for himself a regular fireplace in the fore part of his cave. fur-
nishing it also with a chimney. How happy he was when he
was able to eat a piece of kid, which he had killed, and roasted
at this convenient fireplace, leaving the rest of the meat hang-
ing up in the chimney to smoke, so that it might not go bad.
As the heat of the sun kept on increasing, and all the foliage
became parched up, he felt convinced that the rainy season could
not be far off. He must therefore now take energetic measures
for increasing his store of dried meat and fruits, as well as for
collecting a sufficient supply of food for his live stock. But the
first thing he did was to make a kind of hammock, so as to
avoid sleeping on the bare ground any longer.

After a great deal of trouble, he succeeded in weaving,
with thin twigs off the trees, some badly shaped baskets, which
were, however, very useful for collecting heads of
maize, the fruit of the banana, and roots of the sweet
potato. To his great joy, one evening he found
on the beach some very large turtle, which he was
able to catch and whose flesh tasted very good.
Besides which, their meat was not only excellent
eating when fresh, but kept very well when smoked.
Their huge shells also were of great service to
him for letting the goat's milk stand in. In ad-
dition to this, he was fortunate enough to catch
several young kids, which he added to his herd;
whilst his small stock of furniture, combined with
his cheery fireplace, made his dwelling look to a
certain extent comfortable. Soon after this, the
rainy season set in, and prevented him from leav-
ing his cave for weeks. This leisure he turned
to account by improving his household arrange-
ments in various ways. He made himself a better
umbrella, which he covered with the skins of
goats; so that it not only protected him from
the sun, but also from the rain. He was
now in a position to undertake longer ex-
cursions, without any fear of the conse-
quences of being caught in a shower. For
the steady downpour of rain had already
kept him a prisoner in his cave for a whole
month. At last, however, the rains ceased,
and the sun shone forth again in all his
wonted splendour.
ROBINSON'S Church.
After a short time, new life sprang up
all over the island, from the lately parched
soil. The trees put on a fresh mantle of
spring green and the valleys brought forth
a variegated carpet of flowers. The creepers
hung in graceful festoons from tree to tree,
and the joyous song of the birds resounded
through the forest. The sun poured its
life-giving rays from the deep blue firma-
ment, and the sea reflected, in its depths,
the colour of the sky. Both earth and
heaven seemed to have just come forth
from the Creator's hand. Even ROBINSON'^
downcast heart was awakened to a new life,
and was filled with gratitude towards a merci-
ful Providence that had thus gloriously renewed
all things. He could not but feel that he was
not forsaken; that he had indeed been granted
a new lease of life. He felt that God was near
him, both in the howling of the wind and in
the roaring of the waves.
One lovely summer's evening, he was rest-
ing on a hill near the sea-shore, watching
the sun go down with a splendour he had
ed by the grandeur of the
scene and the solemn
silence which reigned
around him, R.OHIN-
SON fell on his knees
and clasped his
hands in heartfelt
prayer. His soul
was moved to its
depths by a sense
of thankfulness, and
his eyes ran over
with tears. He made
a vow that, come
what might - - whe-
ther he ever saw the ••
countenance of a human
being again, or not — he
would always resign himself
patiently to the will of God.
The thought that he might pos-
sibly regain the favour of the Al-
mighty, which he had so justly forfeited,
comforted his mind.
Every Sunday morning he would come
to church to this hill, and it seemed to him
as though he could, on this spot, hold
converse more freely with his Maker, and
was more absolutely in His presence. The
second summer passed away in this manner.
Further Improvements in his
Household.
ROBINSON'S clothes were now almost
torn to pieces and only hung together in
tatters. It was therefore time that he should
contrive some means of making himself
new garments. With the aid of his now
nearly worn-out knife he cut out some goat
skins, so as to make the parts of a coat, and
sewed them together with thread that he
had manufactured from the bass of a tree.
His flock of goats had been increased
by many a fortunate capture. But the
things he wanted most were some vessels
that would hold water, either for drinking
or cooking purposes. He formed several
pots of various sizes, out of the clay he
had found, and by degrees he learnt to
make them of the proper shape. Then he
dried them in the sun and, after they were
dry, he burnt them in his fire. Still, the
greater part of them cracked, and those
that did not crack were not fit to hold any
liquid. At last it occurred to him that salt

is used to give a water-
proof glaze to pottery; and
after a few trials, he actu-
ally succeeded in mak-
ing some pots that
would hold water. It
was quite a luxury,
when he again tast-
ed boiled meat.
Christmas.
In the meantime
his almanack, which
he kept with great
care by means of not-
ches in a long stick,
told him that Christmas
was now at hand; and
the thought of this recalled
vividly to his mind his Eng-
lish home and his dear parents.
The island looked most lovely in its
garb of delicate spring green. Yet how gladly
would he have exchanged all this for the deep
snow and severe cold of a northern winter, if
only he could thereby have purchased the
right to revisit his beloved home. Still, he
was determined that he would mark the day
somehow. He went out into the forest, where
he cut down a small tree. This he decorated
with candles made from the wax of wild bees
and some tree pith which served for the
wicks. He tried as much as possible to get
all his household work done beforehand,
and when Christmas-eve came, he lighted
up his tree, which in its turn brilliantly illu-
minated, for the first time, the gloomy cave
in which he had taken up his abode. When
he looked upon these shining tapers, a flood
of recollections of his beloved home and
of his youthful days overcame him and his
pent-up feelings found vent in loud sobs. He
went out into the open air. Here he seemed
to be in the midst of one vast Christmas-
tree, the lights of which shone all round
him. His spirit went forth to the Creator
of heaven and earth. He knelt down, under
that starlit sky, in fervent prayer, and a
heavenly peace seemed to steal into his
heart.
Domestic Cares.
To his great joy, the goat he had last
caught presenter! him with a couple of
little kids, which afforded him great amuse-
ment in watching their droll gambols. He
fortunate captures, in cleverly arranged pit-
falls. He was soon obliged to enclose a
large piece of ground for his goats, and
before the rainy season came on again he
made them a shed in which they might
take shelter from the wet. This was the
first year in which he planted
anything for his own use, and
at the end of two months,
he had a splendid crop
of maize to reward his
pains. His household
was now in pretty
good order. He
had provided an
ample store of

firewood. He had plenty of provisions laid
up, for himself and his goats. Hence he found
leisure to reflect upon his position. He was
again rilled with a longing for the companion-
ship of some human being. He would sit
for days doing nothing, and gaze out to sea
in search of a ship; but this year also passed
away without any vessel coming in
sight. This made him very low-
spirited; and at last, a feeling of
wild despair came over him.
He forgot his vows, and
murmured against his
Heavenly Father for
having forsaken him,
and having condem-
ned him to live for
ever on this deso-
late island. All his
thoughts ran upon
the one idea of leav-
ing the island. He
determined to build
himself a boat, and.
with the aid of fire,
and of an axe he had
made for himself out of
a sharp stone, he managed
to hollow out a tree stem,
which had fallen close to the
water's edge. Nevertheless, he was
obliged to acknowledge that a sail was ab-
solutely necessary to enable him to undertake
a voyage; and as he had no hope of getting
saw but too plainly that his plans were useless.
ROBINSON'S Voyage.
At last, however, he determined upon
making a voyage of discovery
round the island. He gave his
goats an ample supply of
food and water. He
put provisions
and water

for himself into the boat, and as he had
a favourable wind, he shoved off from
land. The boat was, however, caught in
a current running out from the island; and,
notwithstanding the almost superhuman
efforts made by ROBINSON, he could not
force the boat against the stream. He was
now being rapidly carried out to sea. The
trees on the island became more and more
indistinct, and, at last, the hills themselves
disappeared in the blue haze. A mortal
terror seized him. He could not tell how
he should be saved from dying of starvation
upon the open sea. A light wind now got
up against the current, and the boat began
to rock and roll terribly. ROBINSON really
did despair of saving his life. Longingly
he stretched forth his arms towards the is-
land, where he had at any rate enjoyed
safety, liberty and the necessaries of life.
Oh! if he could only get back there once
more! He would submit to his fate with
resignation and thankfulness; even though
he should be destined to remain in this
solitude for the rest of his days. Yes; but
now it was too late! Perhaps within an-
other hours time he would become the
prey of the waves. Fear paralyzed his
limbs and parched his throat. The force
of the wind increased. He bitterly re-
gretted his want of gratitude to God, Who
had so often mercifully protected him, and
vowed that he would never murmur against
His will, if he might only be permitted
once more to tread on dry land. By this
time night had closed in. All at once he
thought he could recognise a group of
trees upon the island! — Yes, it was indeed
so. the wind had altered the course of the
current, and he had been brought back to
the island without knowing it. In a very
short time he could recognise the trees
distinctly. They wore those under which
he had made his church. He now took
up the oars with renewed vigour, and put
forth all his strength to reach the land.
His exertions were crowned with success.
He was rapidly approaching the shore. But
it was necessary now to be careful lest the
boat should run upon one of the numerous
reefs which here projected into the sea.
He laboured thus for hours and his strength
was frequently well nigh spent. But the
sight of the shore so close to him. always
revived his flagging powers. At last, he
succeeded in guiding his boat into a gentle
current which brought him to land. With
a cry of joy he jumped out upon the
beach. He now felt the firm earth under
his feet again. He thought himself in
Paradise. Tears of gratitude flowed from
his eyes. He knelt down upon the sea-shore
and returned thanks to God for having once
more saved his life. He remained thus for
about an hour, on the beach,
until he regained his
strength. — Sud-
denly however
he started to
his feet. He
heard his
name
being called. "ROBINSON! where have you
been to?" All his limbs trembled. His
eyes almost started from his head, in the
endeavour to see, through the darkness,
who it was calling him. There, close by
his side, sat a parrot which he had caught
and tamed some time before, and it was he
that had called out his master's name. A
smile of pleasure passed over RoKlNSON's
face as he recognised his feathered friend,
whom he had taught to ask this question.
It seemed as though the very island was
glad of his return. He rose from the
ground and called to the bird, which at
once flew to him and settled on his hand,
where it had been accustomed to perch.
Here again it put the question: "ROBINSON!
where have you been to V" He now fastened
the boat to the shore and hastened through
the valleys to his cave. While he was still at
a distance, the goats set up a joyous bleat-
ing, as though they recognised his footsteps,
and when he entered the
enclosure they flock-
ed around him.
It seemed as
though he
had been
absent for
weeks.

Yet the fire, ff which he had so carefully
banked up with ashes before his depar-
ture, was still alight upon the hearth. His
cave seemed the most comfortable dwelling-
place he had ever been in, and he could not
imagine how it was possible for him to have
been discontented.
A Mysterious Discovery.
Another year had passed away. ROBIN-
SON'S peace of mind, however, had not been
disturbed again. His longing desire for the
companionship of some human being had
given place to a placid contentment, a
peaceful resignation to God's will. Fear and
anxiety had no longer the mastery over him.
A mysterious discovery, however, was
now destined to overthrow, in one moment,
this disposition which had been acquired
at the cost of so much
time and experience. -,>
One day, when
he had made
a longer excursion than usual, he came to a
part of the island he had never before visited.
Whilst walking quietly along the sand, on
the sea-shore, he stopped suddenly as if
thunderstruck. His lance fell from his hand.
He gazed fixedly upon a mark in the
sand — it was the imprint of a human
foot! —• there could be no mistake about
it. He gradually came to his senses. He
did not fly from the spot. He knelt down
to examine the footstep, which pointed
in the direction of the sea. Trembling,
he looked all round him. For this mark
shewed that he was not the only inhabitant
of the island. The naked foot which had
made this print, must have belonged to a
savage. Therefore, savages either lived upon
the island, or else they had come over from
the mainland and had landed here! But
if they were savages, they might also be
cannibals! Perhaps they
were, even now, hidden

any moment. He clutched his weapons,
while a nameless terror overpowered him.
The least sound startled him. He looked
about vacantly. When he had again reached
the high ground, he dashed full speed to-
wards his cave and when he
arrived behind the thick
hedge, he ventured for
the first time to
draw his breath
freely. But
the savages
would
be sure
to disco-
ver his
hiding
place! .4
Whither
should
he flee
so as
to hide
from
them?
Should he
destroy
his dwell-
ing?
Destroy
every
trace of
the la-
bour of
years, and
flee with
his goats
into the fo-
rest? For
some time he
did not dare to
come out of his cave. Fear
had so completely gained the
mastery over his mind that he could not
collect his thoughts sufficiently to devise
any coherent scheme. He could no longer
sleep at night. In every sound he fancied
he heard men's voices. His late dependence
on God was again overthrown. He never
considered that the Almighty, Who had al-
ready saved him so often from danger, could
also protect him on this occasion, if it were
His good pleasure to do so. In the grey
twilight of the morning he would frequently
go up to the highest point of the island,
whence almost the whole country could be
overlooked; but, even from that observatory,

he could see neither the wreck of a ship,
nor any signs of smoke. As weeks went
by in this manner, and no further traces
of human beings were visible, he regained,
to a certain extent, his composure of mind.
He became more and more assured that
the footprint had been made, not
by any hidden inhabitant of
the island, but by some
savage who had come
over with a party
from the main land,
and had perhaps
been driven here
by stress of wea-
ther, but had
certainly gone
away long
ago. True.
the savages
might come
back again
at any mo-
ment, and
what
should he
do then?
The most
necessary
thing to
be done
was to for-
tify his cave
better than
at present.
He construct-
ed a second
wall or hedge
round it. by con-
necting by means
of stakes and wattles
the trees which he had
planted round it. The interior
wall he made stronger, and raised
it higher with earth and stones. Moreover
he planted a large number of trees in a
half circle round his cave at a little
distance from the second hedge, and be-
tween these trees he planted some very
fast-growing bushes; so that within a
year's time, his dwelling place was sur-
rounded by a perfectly impenetrable thicket,
behind which probably no one would think
of looking for a human dwelling.
Whilst engaged in these daily tasks,
another year passed by — the eighth since
he had been cast ashore. His dread of the
savages gradually wore off; so that he again
undertook cautious excursions into the in-
terior of the island.
A Terrible Surprise.
One day, when thus wandering about the
island, ROBINSON arrived at the spot where
he had first seen the imprint of a human
foot, and here he mounted one of the lower
hills near the sea shore. Suddenly he
fancied — and his heart stopped beating
at the idea — that he could see, far away
upon the waves, a boat bobbing up and
down. Whilst he was still considering what
he should do;—doubtful whether he could
trust his eyes; or whether it was really a
boat, full of savages, that he had seen ; — he
observed a thin column of smoke, curling
up into the air from the beach. His first
idea was to fly from the spot; but as he
noticed that a number of birds were as-
sembled on the open sea-shore, he thought
he might take it for granted that no human
beings were there. He therefore crept
down to the place and stopped suddenly,
as if petrified with horror at the sight
which met his eyes. The beach was
strewed with human skulls and other
bones; in the midst of which the traces of
a still unextinguished fire were visible.
Shuddering with disgust, ROBINSON stood
rooted to the place, gazing at the relics ot
a feast which had evidently been held, not
long before, by those inhuman savages upon
this spot. Thoroughly horrified and sick-
ened, he fled to his dwelling. The boat
which he had seen had evidently brought
those cruel wretches to the island. On his
way home, he found, in several places,
distinct traces of human beings.
The memory of that shocking scene
haunted him day and night for a long time.
The details were always present to his mind
in all their hideousness; whilst his rage
and fury at these fiends in human shape
were so great that he took the desperate
resolve — if ever they should visit the island
again — to attack them whilst they were
engaged in their detestable meal and to save,
if possible, from their clutches some of the
unfortunate beings whom they had destined
for sacrifice. He hoped that his mere
^> .7 2X^*3&

appearance would suffice to terrify the savages. He made a number
of sharp arrows and practised himself daily in throwing sharp edged
stones. But for months he watched the sea in vain from his hill
top. He did not again see anything of a suspicious character, and
by degrees, a more peaceful frame of mind, and a pious resignation
to God's will, took possession of him.
The Crystal Grotto.
One day, as ROBINSON was in the forest collecting dry wood to
burn it into charcoal, he discovered, in a thick bush that ran along
the face of the cliff, an opening in the rock which appeared to
become broader as it deepened. He crept on his hands and knees
into the hole. At last he found there was room enough, in the
cavern for him to stand upright and he felt his way further onwards
by means of his hands against the face of the rock. But he sud-
denly started back in terror: for. out of the darkness, he saw two
large eyes like coals of fire glaring at him and he heard a noise
as of some one groaning in pain. Hark! were not those really the
words of some human being in agony! Terrified beyond measure.
ROBINSON got out of the cavern as quickly as possible; but
when he again emerged into the daylight, he plucked up
courage and was ashamed of his own cowardice. At any rate,
he would ascertain for certain whether these sounds were
uttered by a human being. He quickly provided himself
with a torch and, thus armed, proceeded to examine
the opening. Yes! there was the sound again! there
must be some sick person, dying in there! RoBIN-
SON's hair stood on end. and a cold perspiration burst
forth upon his forehead. He plucked up all his
courage, and, commending himself to the providential
care of God, he went forward. There — there it
lay! and as he looked more closely he made out,
by the flickering light of his torch, an enormous,
hideous, old he-goat, which seemed at the point
of death, and. as is sometimes the case with wild
animals, had retired to this cavern to end its
days. The poor brute could not rise upon its
feet; therefore ROBINSON allowed it to lie where
it was and went forward through a narrow
passage into the recesses of the cavern. All at
once he found himself in a hollow space some
twenty feet square, the walls and ceiling of
which glistened and shone like gold and
precious stones, reflecting the light of his
torch in the most fantastic manner. He
had discovered a crystal grotto! The floor
was dry and almost level. He had sud-
denly come upon that which he had so
long looked for — a place of refuge in
time of need. In this retreat, the savages
would not be able to find him, even
though they searched the whole island.
Next day he brought his stores and
weapons here. In the mean
time, the old goat had died
and RoniNSON dragged his
carcase, with much diffi-
culty, out of the cavern,
burying him in front of the
opening in the face of the
cliff.
A New Event.
For a whole month, in-
cessant storms of thunder
and lightning broke over the
island. One night, during
which the incessant roaring
of the waves gave RoiilN-
SON but little chance of
sleep, he started up in his
hammock with a cry of sur-
prise! He fancied he had
heard the sound of a can-
non firing. Yes! there it ..-•
was again! Kvidently a
signal of distress from some
vessel. RoiiiNS< >N sprang to
his feet. The night was pitch
dark. He clambered, however,
somehow, up to his hill-top, and
reached it just in time to see
another flash, out at sea, which
was followed by the third report.
Kvidently some ship was in the
greatest danger.
Towards morning the vio-
lence of the storm abated a little
and the sky gradually cleared. On
looking out seaward, ROBINSON
fancied he could discern a black
spot among the rocks. As the
day wore on, and the sky be-
came clearer, he was able to make
out distinctly that a large ship lay
stranded among the rocks, and the
waves were breaking clean over
her. What could he do to assist
the unfortunate mariners? He re-
solved to get his boat afloat and —
no matter what exertion it might
cost him — to put off to the
wreck. After getting his boat
afloat, he went up to the top of
the hill, once more, in order to
ascertain the exact direction in
which the wreck lay; when, shock-
ing to relate, the ship was no longer
visible. It had broken up! Not a
single living soul seemed to have
been saved from the wreck!
Exhausted with his exertions,
he went sadly home; still, as soon
as he had taken some necessary
refreshment, he went forth deter-
mined to make a further search.
Just as he stepped out of the
palm wood, on to the sea-shore,
he saw a magnificent dog. It
stood perfectly still and seemed
to gaze at him earnestly. ROHIN-
SON tried in vain to coax the
animal to come to him. He ran
whining away, looking back, as
if he wished ROBINSON to fol-
low him. This the latter did and,
at last, the dog stopped close
to the dead body of a cabin-
boy that lay on the beach.
All RoBFNSON's exertions
to restore life to the body
were in vain! The boy shewed no signs of returning
animation - - ROBINSON had indeed found a human
being; but he was dead! He dug a grave in the
sand, and the dog stretched himself out upon the
spot where his master lay buried, which he could
not be induced to quit. Next day, however, he greedily
ate some bread, that RoBlNSON offered him, and, after
several days watching, he was at last induced to follow his
new master home. RoBlNSON called his new friend TURK,
and found in him not only a companion and friend, but
also a faithful protector of his property.
The Landing of the Savages.
About a year may thus have passed away, when, one
morning in autumn, as ROBINSON climbed the hill just above
his dwelling, he was terrified to see the reflection of a fire that
had been made on the beach, on the east side of the island,
not a mile away from his dwelling. He was even able to
hear the shouts and yells of savages. His limbs were para-
lysed with fear. It was with some difficulty he saved him-
self from falling off his ladder. The sight that met his eyes
almost took away his senses. Some twelve Indians were
collected round a fire that they had prepared for cooking
their revolting meal. The tide had gone out. and three
canoes were lying high and dry on the beach. It was
evident that more savages had landed than were now
visible round the fire. Probably the others were roam-
ing about the island. They might therefore, at any
moment, discover his fortress. In feverish haste he
returned to his home, and taking his weapons in his
hand, determined to defend himself to the utmost
against these inhuman monsters. But listen as he
might, not a sound was to be heard. He waited
thus for hours, in mortal terror the whole time; but
in vain. During this period of keen anxiety he raised
his thoughts to the Most High, Who had so often
before saved him in such wonderful ways. His ex-
citement cooled down to a certain extent. Still
at any cost he must put an end to this terrible
^ uncertainty. Again he mounted the hill, and.
laying himself flat upon the ground,

crept a short distance forward. From this
point of observation, he was able to overlook
the place where he had seen the savages. They
were fourteen in number. They had just risen
from their meal and were dancing, with the
most wonderful springs and yells, around the fire,
which was on the point of going out. He could
follow every movement with the naked eye. The flood
tide was now coming in. The cannibals, jumping up,
hastened to their boats; and, rowing quickly round the
point of the island, soon reached the open sea, where
they were gradually lost to sight. ROBINSON now ven-
tured to raise himself from the ground; but his peace
of mind was gone. He was convinced that the savages
would come back again; that his freedom —
nay, more, his life — was in the greatest
danger. For weeks he did not venture to go
beyond the enclosure surrounding his for-
tress. His solitude seemed now doubly pain-
ful to him. His longing desire for the com-
panionship of some human being had never
been so intense as it grew to be during the
year immediately following this event. — The
autumn had come round again. One morn-
ing as ROBINSON went out, armed as usual,
to look from the top of his hill round the
island, he observed — and his heart seemed
to cease beating at the sight — on the
small tongue of land, just beyond the
wood on the beach, where the fittle creek
ran in, three canoes belonging to the sav-
ages. He quickly clambered up to the top
of the hill, and, looking to-
wards the beach, he
espied about twen-
ty savages sitting
round a fire.
Others had just
brought two
captives from
the canoes
and were en-
gaged in loos-
ening their
bonds. The sa-
vages fell upon
the first of these
victims and kill-
ed him with their
clubs. Whilst they
were thus engaged^
with the one, Roiim-
soN saw the second pri-

soner suddenly get free from his keepers, and
run with incredible swiftness towards his hid-
den dwelling. The savages set up a wild yell
of rage, and three of them, armed with bows
and arrows, started after the fugitive. ROIJIN-
SON at once saw the dangerous aspect
which affairs had assumed for him. Now
the creek alone separated them from him.
The poor fugitive leaped without hesitation
into the water and swam across the short
distance with great speed. Two of his
pursuers also sprang in after him; whilst
the third stopped, and returned to his com-
rades by the fire. The fugitive had by
this time reached the other side of the
creek, and fled towards the wood, but his
pursuers also came up out of the water,
and hastened after him. The stronger of
the two pursuers grad-
ually gained ground.
ROBINSON made
up his mind that
he would save
this wretched
being from
his enemies,
cost what it
might. The
fugitive now
approached
his hiding-
place. ROBIN-
SON stept for-
ward with his
weapons, from
amongst the trees.
Terrified by this
sudden and wonderful
apparition, the savage
every limb. ROBINSON no longer thought of him-
self, he sprang upon the first pursuer, and laid him
low with a single blow of his club; whilst the man
whom he had saved fell upon his knees before
him, and, raising his hands in a supplicatory
attitude, seemed to beg that his life might be
spared. The second pursuer now emerged from
the thicket. When he saw the strange being, in a
suit of goat-skins, and his comrade lying dead on
the ground, he was full of amazement He quickly
adjusted an arrow to his bow, but, too late! — a well-
aimed shot from ROBINSON'S bow at this moment
put an end to his life. The savage who had been
saved still remained on his knees, although ROBIN-
SON tried by encouraging signs to reassure him,
and to invite him to come nearer. He seemed
to expect nothing less than death, and did not
dare to stand up. ROBINSON, observing this,
broke off a green twig from one of the trees, and


«li
held it out towards the poor
wretch, who, seeing this symbol of peace,
appeared to gain courage. He approach-
ed, cautiously and slowly, falling from
'time to time on his knees, and kiss-
ing the ground.
, ROBINSON advanced towards him,
with the most friendly gestures, in
order to raise him from the ground.
But the poor savage threw himself
upon his face, and placed the right
foot of his deliverer upon his neck,
in token of submission. ROBINSON
raised him up, and held out his hand.
In the meantime, the savage who
had been felled with the club had
raised himself up into a sitting posture,
and gave a fearful yell. The fugitive,
on hearing this sound, sprang to his
feet trembling with fear. RoBlNSON
was about to shoot the savage with
his bow; but the one whom he had
saved gave him to understand that,
if he would trust him with a club,
he would dispatch the enemy. His
request was granted, and, with a
shout of revenge, the savage fell
upon his foe, and killed him with
a single blow.
ROBINSON lost no time in flying
to his grotto, his new friend follow-
ing in his steps. Once there he felt
more safe, for he was sure that the
savages would never discover it The
night passed away in quiet At dawn,
ROBINSON left the cave, and made his
way to the top of the cliff to see
what had become of the savages. —
He was delighted to find that the
canoes were gone and no trace of

their owners was to be seen. - - The savages had
evidently left the island.
ROBINSON'S Young Guest.
When ROBINSON came to the grotto, where
he had left his friend asleep, the savage guest
came out to meet him, and again placed the
foot of his preserver on his neck. ROBINSON
raised him up, and contemplated with secret satis-
faction the well-knit and powerful figure of the man
whom he had saved. He called him FRIDAY, as that
was the day on which he had come to him. Tying
an apron of goats-skin round his waist, he took FRIDAY
with him to the spot where the savages had lighted
their fire. With strongly marked gestures, to show
how revolting and disgusting the sight was to him, he
commanded FRIDAY to collect and bury the remains of the
bloody feast, which were strewed all around; after which he took
him to his fortress. FRIDAY could hardly believe his senses
when he entered the hidden dwelling, and was shewn the
various articles; such as he had never seen before. At
first. ROBINSON considered it advisable to make his guest
sleep in the outer ring of his fortifications, and to
barricade himself in his cave with all his wea-
pons; as he did not think it prudent
to place himself quite at the mercy
of a savage. But very soon all dis-
trust vanished, and he became
convinced of the faithfulness and
loyalty of his swarthy com-
) panion.
FRIDAY followed his
master about as a son
does his father. ROBIN-
SON soon observed,
in the young savage,
not only a childlike
docility, but also
\ many other good
qualities; in ad-
dition to which
his adroitness
rendered him of
great use in carry-
ing on the house-
hold duties.
ROBINSON next
made clothes for his
companion out of goat
skins. It was very
amusing to watch
how this child of
the woods behaved
himself whilst put-
ting on these, to him,
foreign and most un-
comfortable articles.
\
Still his self-esteem was much flattered
at being allowed to wear the same gar-
ments as his master. At first it is true that
he was very awkward in them, and
seemed to be deprived of all freedom
of movement, but he soon got accustomed
to the unusual restraint. — He learnt with
surprising rapidity to understand what his
master said, and to repeat after him a number
of the words ordinarily used in conversation.
ROBINSON soon became very proud of his
pupil, who proved to be most handy at all
kinds of work, and tried to anticipate every
wish of his master. FRIDAY, too, was very
happy at his own rapid progress, and it was
with proud delight that he brought home to
his master any animal that he had killed.
If ROBINSON did by any chance praise his
skill, FRIDAY would dance for joy, and a smile
of pleasure would light up his whole face,
whilst his teeth gleamed between his red lips
like a row of pearls.
The society of this wild son of nature
procured for ROBINSON many a pleasant hour,
and he thankfully acknowledged how merciful
God, in His Providence, had been in send-
ing him such a companion. It was a great
pleasure to ROBINSON to teach the young
stranger a few words of his own language,
and to watch his surprise and amazement
at the furniture and weapons which he saw.
Above all, however, the fireplace, the table,
and the chair surprised FRIDAY most. One
day, when for the first time he saw the
violent bubbling and hissing of a pot of
boiling water, in which ROBINSON had placed
a piece of meat to cook, he was greatly
alarmed at this, to him, unusual sound, and
his master had much difficulty in preventing
him from trying to kill with his club the
animal which, as he thought, had come to
life in the pot. Nevertheless, when the meat
was boiled, FRIDAY soon learnt to partake
of it with great relish; although it was
some time before ROBINSON could persuade
him to make use of a spoon while eating.
But what delighted FRIDAY most, was,
when he could astonish his master by his
dexterity in swimming and climbing, or sur-
prise him by the extraordinary acuteness of
his senses of seeing, hearing, or smelling.
ROBINSON had also an opportunity of learn-
, -. tf,\\\ Vx
^ t\iV\V
ing many things from his companion, who proved to be a great adept
in capturing wild animals. He was never tired of watching FRIDAY'S
dexterity in shooting fish in the water with a bow and arrows, or
the rapidity with which he would collect a large dish of cray-fish.
ROBINSON as Schoolmaster.
There being now two mouths to feed, the field labour was
necessarily doubled; still it was only half as troublesome to
RoBlNSON, since he had a companion to work with him, and
to whom he could impart his thoughts, which he had for so
many years been obliged to keep to himself. He very soon
found that his assistant could appreciate and enter into most of
his ideas. ROBLNSON was very fond of telling his young-friend
stories of his former life; matters concerning his Knglish home,
the large towns, the domestic arrangements and habits of his
countrymen; whilst he would watch the perplexed amazement
of his listener, and whet his desire- for further knowledge.
FRIDAY soon learnt enough of his master's language
to be able to answer questions respecting his former
savage life and that of the rest of his tribe. On such
occasions ROBINSON also learnt many details con-
cerning the superstitious faiths of the savages, their
gods and their ideas of a future life. ROBINSON deter-
mined if possible to save his young friend from such
erroneous beliefs. When they sat together of an
evening, resting from their daily toil, on the hill
which ROBLNSON had used as his church, and the
latter talked of the works and nature of the
One Eternal God. he would often himself be
inspired with holy zeal. FRIDAY'S ears would
devour with avidity the words as they fell from
his master's lips, when he told him of the good-
ness and greatness of God, Who is everywhere
around us, Who created the world by His Al-
mighty power. Who orders and preserves all
things, Whose love and grace had been
manifested to himself in so many ways;
and when ROBINSON'S eyes glistened with
holy awe and inspiration. FRIDAY would
be moved to fall at his feet and em-
brace his knees. The savage was never
tired of hearing of the loving
,'\) , Father. Who was so much
better and greater than his own
cruel deities. And ROBINSON
himself felt that he became a
better and purer man after hav-
ing, on such occasions, endea-
voured to instil into the human
soul entrusted to his care, ideas
concerning all that is holy
and good.

The Wreck and its Treasures.
The rainy season, which had in the meantime set
in, was now nearly at an end, and ROBINSON, who was
always considering how he could render his fortification
more and more secure, determined to build a wall inside
the hedge he had planted. FRIDAY'S part of the busi-
ness was to bring stones to the spot — a proceeding which
was rendered all the easier by means of a kind of
sledge which ROBINSON had made, from fallen boughs
of trees, whilst the dog was pressed into the service
and made to help in drawing.
One very fine day, when they were both standing
upon a hill, on the south side of the island, the air being
remarkably clear, FRIDAY all at once began to jump about
and to dance, calling out all the time: — "There is my
country! There is my people!" ROBINSON gazed steadily
in the direction pointed out, and fancied that he too
could make out a very faint land line marked upon the
horizon. He turned to his companion: — "Should you
like to return to your country, FRIDAY?" "Will you come
with FRIDAY?" was the reply. "Oh, they would eat me
if I came there!'' said ROBINSON; but FRIDAY quickly
answered: — "Oh no! there are white men, like you,
there, already!'7
ROBINSON hardly trusted his ears; still FRIDAY
repeated what he had said, and, by dint of further
questioning, his master ascertained that there already
were, living amongst FRIDAY'S countrymen, seventeen
white men — shipwrecked mariners, who had been well
received by the natives and had been permitted to
share their hard lot.
This was indeed an important discovery! ROBINSON
at once resolved to build a boat which should be less
rickety than his little canoe, and capable of carrying
them both over to the distant land, in order to join
these white men. He did not doubt but that his own
inventive mind, if combined with the aid of their strong
arms, would render it possible for them to devise some
means by which they might all return to Europe.
ROBINSON and his man at once set about building
a new boat, at which task hope more than doubled
their power of work. By the end of three months,
they were in a position to make a first trial
voyage. ROBINSON taught FRIDAY how to ma-
nage the boat, and how to steer. They had
even fixed the time at which they would start
on their trip, when an extraordinary chain
of events caused them to change their plan.
One evening, a storm of unusual violence
broke over the island. Next morning, the
weather having become fine, and it being,
according to their calendar, a Sunday,
ROBINSON and his man went together to
the top of the hill which they called
their church. Arrived there, they both
uttered a cry of surprise; for there, at
the south end of the island and still
beaten by the roaring waves, lay the
wreck of a large ship.
ROBINSON became as pale as a sheet. '"Here,"
he said, "is a ship that might have saved me; but
it must needs get wrecked!" Followed by the faith-
ful FRIDAY, he strode off, as if in a dream, towards
the sea-shore, where he walked along the sand in a
southern direction, in the hope of finding some
shipwrecked person who had been saved. But he
did not meet with a soul.
ROBINSON, however, could not curb his impa-
tience to see what there was on board the vessel;
he therefore sprang
into the sea, as he was,
and swam to the wreck,
followed by FRIDAY;
a rope, which was
hanging down from
the deck, enabling
them to clamber on
board. Without taking
much notice of FRI-
DAY'S astonishment at
"the big house", as he
called the ship, Ro-
BINSON at once pro-
ceeded to examine the
hold, as far as the
water would allow
him to go. No
human being
was any-
where
visible; but there were
large stores of provisions
arms, gunpowder, imple-
ments and tools of vari-
ous kinds. What a pre-
cious find! With what de-
light did ROBINSON gaze
at these implements and
weapons. Why should he
hesitate to appropriate
any or all of these things;
as they must otherwise,
in the course of a few
days, become the prey of
the waves, when the ship broke up? They both swam
back to the shore and brought their boat round as quickly
as possible to the spot, loading her with such things as
seemed most valuable to them. When they had deposited
the first boatload on the shore, it occurred to ROBINSON
that a shower of rain might come and spoil a quantity of
the things; he therefore took the precaution of erecting
a kind of tent on the beach with the various pieces of
sailcloth that he had brought away with him. Whilst they
were thus engaged, night came on; but before entering
their fortress ROBINSON loaded a fowling piece, and fired

their, heads. The aim was good, and the seagull
fell; but so did FRIDAY also, from sheer terror. He lay
on the ground, trembling in every limb and ROBINSON
had much difficulty in persuading him to lay hold of
the weapon "in which thunder and lightning lived."
In the course of a few days ROBINSON managed
to bring off a great number of useful things, many
of which he had long pined for, from the wreck, be-
fore it went to pieces. By dint of hard work, he and
FRIDAY managed to stow them away safely in the grotto.
A Sanguinary Conflict.
ROBINSON was soon destined to find out the value
of the firearms. One morning, FRIDAY came in from the
beach, whither he had gone to fetch a turtle, with all the
signs of great alarm depicted on his countenance. Three
canoes full of savages were approaching the island!
ROBINSON quickly armed himself and his companion —
who had by this time learned to handle a gun with
great dexterity — with three guns and a brace of
pistols each, together with the necessary ammunition;
and then, they both mounted the cliff to make their
observations. With the aid of the telescope, ROBINSON
was able to see that there were twenty-one savages, and
that they had with them three prisoners, one of
whom was a white man! The canoes were appro-
aching the shore at a spot where the
bushes grew close down to the water's
edge, and ROBINSON, with FRIDAY, made
all haste through the forest to get down
to this place. They found that the sa-
vages had already landed. Nineteen of
them were seated round a fire. One of
their prisoners they had by this time
killed and two of their number were
now dragging the white man from the
canoes. ROBINSON advanced very cau-
tiously towards them, and, when he
was near enough, gave FRIDAY the
word to "fire." When the smoke
cleared away, it was seen that two
of the savages had fallen, whilst the
rest jumped to their feet with evident
signs of terror. Two more shots, and
again two savages fell. The rest, who
were unhurt, rushed about wildly,
like mad creatures, shouting and yell-
ing. Three more were killed from the
ambush, before ROBINSON thought it
safe to sally forth, and shew himself.
FRIDAY and his master, shouting
at the top of their voices, now rushed
out from their hiding place into the
midst of the savages, who fled in
all directions, endeavouring to
regain their canoes. ROBINSON

took out his knife, quickly cut
through the withies with which
the white man was bound,
and thrust a sabre and
pistol into his hands. By
this time some of the sa-
vages had recovered
their presence of
mind, and, headed
by a giant wielding
a huge club, made
an attack upon Ro-
BINSON'S party. RO-
BINSON and FRIDAY
again fired, and each
killed his man; but
the huge savage still
came on, making for
the white man whom
they had released. He
being weak and stiff, from
the manner in which his limbs
had been tied, strove in vain to
ward off, with his sword, the attacks of this
monster. The savage closed with his oppo-
nent and the white man would have been


lost, had he not made use of his
pistol. With the report, the giant
fell to the ground, and the other
could now assist RoiUNSON
with his sword.
The conflict was soon
over. Those of the savages
who succeeded in reach-
ing the canoes pushed
off from the shore in
two of them; whilst
ROBINSON, with FRI-
DAY, jumped into the
third in order to pur-
sue the flying foe.
When, however, they
got into the boat, they
were surprised to find
in it a helpless prisoner —
an old Indian almost dead
with fright and tied in such
a cruel manner, that he really
had very little life left in him. Ro-
BlNSON at once cut his bonds and at this
moment FRIDAY — whose attention had till
now been fixed upon the fugitives — threw
himself at the feet of the
old man, kissed him, em-
braced him, hugged him,
cried, laughed, nolloaed,
jumped about, danced,
sang; then cried again,
wrung his hands, beat his
breast and head, and then
sang and jumped about
again like a madman. Fi-
nally he clasped ROBIN-
SON'S knees, and when he
had come to himself a little,
shrieked, rather than said,
"This my father, Sir!"
ROUINSON was not a
little surprised and delight-
ed to hear this. He helped
in rubbing and chafing the
old man's limbs, which were stiff and numb
from the manner in which they had been tied,
and gave him a little rum to drink, to enable
him to bear being lifted on shore. There
ROBINSON also gave some refreshment to the
white man, who turned out to be a Spaniard,
and one of the shipwrecked men whom
ROBINSON and FRIDAY had for months been
making preparations to go in search of. As
the rescued men were incapable, owing to
the extent to which their limbs were swollen,
of walking the distance to the cave, a kind
of litter was constructed, on which ROBINSON
and FRIDAY carried them; and very soon after
their arrival, they were fast asleep.
Next morning, the Spaniard related to
ROBINSON all that had happened to him and
his companions, from the day on which they
lost their ship, until the present time; after
he had heard all, ROBINSON decided that
the Spaniard, with FRIDAY'S father, should
take the boat, and «•.*•i^- g0 to
bring theEuropeans over to this fruitful island.
As soon as they had started, ROBINSON
reflected that it would be necessary to make
provision for the large number of men who
would soon be living on the island. He
therefore set about sowing a larger crop
than any he had sown hitherto. — The things
he had saved from the wreck were very
useful to him in this. He managed to put
together a very serviceable plough, to which
he yoked a team of four goats.
The Mutineers.
Early one morning, about a week after
the boat had gone away. ROBINSON was ly-
ing asleep in his hammock, when he was wa-
kened by the joyful voice of FRIDAY exclaim-
ing "Sir! they have come! they have come!"
ROBINSON hurried up to the top of the cliff.

whither FRIDAY had preceded him, and there
he certainly could see a boat approaching
the island; but in a direction from which it
was hardly possible that the Spaniards should
come. And, moreover, as he made a sweep
round the horizon with his telescope, he
saw, far out at sea, a ship lying off the island,
in a south-easterly direction.
His first feeling of joyful hope that
at last an opportunity offered of leaving the
island, lasted but for a short time; as he
could see that there were eleven men in
the boat, of whom three were bound hand
and foot, and were lying side by side under
the thwarts. This strange circumstance
warned him to be cautious. Therefore he
armed both himself and FRIDAY, .and as.
judging from the direction in which it was
being steered towards the shore, the boat
would land just at the spot where the
wood came close down to the water's edge,
where the conflict with the savages had
lately taken place, they both of them made
their way down there. From this place
of ambush, they were able to see that
the three men who were bound were sitting
silent and dejected under a tree; whilst some
of the others, who were evidently English
sailors, appeared to be sleeping by the boat.
As there was no one else to be seen, ROBIN-
SON rightly supposed that the rest of the
party had gone to explore the interior of
the island. He therefore gave FRIDAY a sign,
and both of them crept down to the pri-
soners, who looked greatly alarmed when
they saw two strange figures, armed to the
teeth, come out of the bushes towards
them. ROBINSON, however, made signs that
they should remain perfectly still, and en-
quired who they were? The men answered
that they were the captain, mate, and a pas-
senger belonging to the ship lying in the
offing. That the crew had mutinied, taking
possession of the vessel, and had at first
intended to kill their officers, but had changed
their minds, and had brought them to this
island for the purpose of leaving them there
in case it should prove uninhabited. Robin-
son at once promised to do all he could
to deliver them, if in return they would
undertake to carry him and his companions
back to Europe.
Naturally this proposal was joyfully
accepted; ROBINSON released the three men
from the cords with which they were bound and gave
each of them a gun with some ammunition. "Fortu-
nately, the villains have only brought two guns with
them," exlaimed the captain with glee; "and they
cannot escape us, as the tide has gone out, leaving
their boat high and dry upon the sand." All at once
voices were heard approaching. ROBINSON and his
party fired, directly the new comers emerged from
the wood, killing two out of three; whilst the third
fell wounded. The watchers in the boat, as they had no
arms, gave but little trouble and were soon secured.
"We have been in luck," said the captain. "The
first and the last men who fell were the worst cha-
racters of the lot. The rest may be pardoned if they
will submit."
The prisoners were now bound hand and foot;
whilst the same course was pursued towards the
others, who came out of the wood later on, and were
taken captive before they had any clear idea of what
had occurred. Two of the prisoners who were de-
clared by the captain to be the least guilty were now
released from their bonds, and were furnished with
the guns that had been found in the boat. FRIDAY was
sent up to the cave to fetch some provisions; whilst
the rest of the party were employed in dragging the
dead bodies into the wood. When these preparations
had all been made, all hands ate and drank, waiting
for the next move on the part of those on board the
ship. Towards evening, several guns were heard from
the ship and then another boat was seen to shove off
from her side. There were ten men in her; and when
the captain could make them out clearly with the
glass, he turned to ROBINSON and told him that
two of them were too dangerous to be spared.
These were, TOM FRY and WILL ATKINS, the
boatswain's mate.
When the boat touched the shore, her crew
jumped out, and ran to and fro upon the beach,
shouting and holloaing for their missing comrades.
When they found the boat lying deserted they could
not make it out. However, as they got no answer to
their shouts, they went towards the wood, firing
their pistols as signals. Suddenly a couple of
shots were heard, and two of the mutineers
fell to the ground, killed by the bullets of the
captain and the mate. "Stand! and throw down
your arms, or you are all dead men!" cried
ROBINSON. The sudden fate which had be-
fallen two of their comrades intimidated the
others, who, in their terror, sought in vain
to make out where their opponents were
hidden. After a little hesitation, they saw
there was nothing for it but to obey; and.
one by one, they commenced to throw
away their swords and their pistols on
the sand. ROBINSON now gave a sign,
and his small party — seven men
against eight — came out of their hid-
ing place in the thicket. "Remain at
the present!" called ROBINSON back into the
wood, as though giving a parting word of
command to a body of men concealed there;
and this manoeuvre produced the desired
effect, for not one of the new comers attempt-
ed to make the slightest resistance to being
bound.
The Capture of the Ship.
The prisoners were now taken for the
night to the fortress, whilst those who could
least be trusted, were confined in the crystal
grotto. After holding a consultation with
the captain. ROBINSON offered most of the I
prisoners a free pardon, provided that they j
would place themselves under the orders
of the captain, and assist in recapturing the
ship. They gave the most profuse assur-
ances of their fidelity, whilst two hostages
were selected, who were to remain with
ROBINSON, and should answer with their
lives for the good behaviour of the rest.
The captain then waited until the next
evening when, taking with him twelve men,
of whom he put six in each boat, he
started for the ship. It was a ticklish mo-
ment when the watch on deck hailed
them and they had to reply; still they ma-
naged to disarm the suspicions of those
on deck. The captain and the mate soon
reached the deck, and a couple of powerful
strokes from their cutlasses silenced the
watch. In the meanwhile, the crew of
the other boat had come alongside, and,
climbing on board, went forward to the
cook's galley, where they made prisoners of
the three men whom they found there. The
noise caused by all this awoke the rest of
the mutineers. A few heads appeared at
the forescuttle, but they were as quickly with-
drawn, and all resistance in the body of the
ship ceased. The rest of the crew, after a
faint-hearted struggle, soon threw down their
arms and yielded; and the firing of seven
guns, which was the signal agreed upon,
gave ROBINSON notice of the success of the
expedition, as also that the captain was again
master of his vessel.
Next morning, the meeting between
Robinson and the captain was most joy-
ous, and thankfully did the latter embrace
his deliverer. There lay the noble vessel,
and gladly would ROBINSON have at once
gone on board and set sail for Europe,
but the mutely appealing looks of Friday
reminded him that he must still wait
awhile. The time which elapsed before the
return of the Spaniards was spent in ex-
plaining to his guests how ROBINSON had
managed to procure the means of living
on the island, since he had been cast away,
at which narration all were much entertained
and surprised. But a sad shock was in
store for poor FRIDAY. When the Spaniards
did at last return, he sought in vain amidst
their number for his father! The old man

land! There was now therefore nothing to
keep FRIDAY from following ROBINSON to the
furthest ends of the earth. It was not with-
out a feeling of regret that ROBINSON tore
himself away from the spot where he had
spent eight and twenty years, two months,
and nineteen days of his life; where he
had passed eighteen years in solitude and
labour, and where he had learnt to become a
useful member of society. Seven of the Spa-
niards, who were, at their own request, left
upon the island to retain possession of it for
ROBINSON, stood upon the beach waving a
farewell greeting to the fast receding ship,
on whose deck stood the "Lord of the Isle,"
with his dog by his side and his parrot on
his shoulder; whilst from time to time he
brushed away a tear, which would spring
unbidden to his eyes.
At Home again.
The voyage to Europe was a prosperous
and rapid one. First they came to the
Spanish coast, where they parted
from their ten Spanish
guests and then it
was not long be-
fore the white
cliffs of old
England
came in
sight.
When
ROBINSON w
first came'
home, he
was as
perfect a
stranger
as if he
had never
been in
Hull be-
fore.
However,
he at last
came
across a
cousin,
who
rememb-
ered
something
about him, and who
gave him an account of what had taken
place in the family since he had been away.

His mother was dead; but his father was
still alive. The cousin accompanied him and
FRIDAY, who, like his master, was now
dressed in European clothes, to the house
where ROBINSON'S father lived. "Here is
a gentleman who wishes to speak to you,
uncle!" were the words in which he address-
ed a greyhaired, helpless old man, who
was sitting in an armchair by the fireside.
All at once, the supposed stranger fell at
the feet of the old man. and, grasping his
knees, cried in a voice broken with sobs: —
"I am ROBINSON! your long lost son, Father!
but I am now quite a different being! Will
you not forgive me?" "Gracious God!" ex-
claimed the old man. "Bless you my son;
and thanks be to Thee, Heavenly Father,
that Thou hast allowed me to see this
day! Now I can die in peace!"
Great were the rejoicings in Hull when
it was known that ROBINSON had safely
returned; for the family were very much
respected in the town. The neighbours
flocked in to see the long lost son, and he
had to tell the tale of his adventures
over and over again.
ROBINSON and FRIDAY lived
to a good old age;
many a time was
ROBINSON called
upon to tell
the tale
of his
life on
the is-
land to
hundreds
of eager
little
listeners,
whom
he never
failed to
warn
against
the evils
of idle-
ness and
thought-
lessness,
so that
they
mightbe
spared
passing
through the rough
school of adversity in which he had been
obliged to serve so severe an apprenticeship.
