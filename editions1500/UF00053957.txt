339, WILLIAM ADAMS, '
THE PIONEER ENGLISHMAN IN JAPAN.

N the 'year of our Lord 1598, the Dutch East India Company
sent out a fleet of five Hollanders " to traffic in the Indies."
Great rumours were spread throughout Europe of the riches
obtained by the Spanish and Portuguese in these far-distant
parts of the world. Defying the bulls and interdicts of the"
Pope, and the threatenings of the nations protected by him, the
Dutch, like the English, were resolved to seek their share
in the good things made known by the navigators and dis-
coverers of those times. So this Dutch fleet was equipped
and sent forth, sailing from the Texel on the 24th of June, under
the command of Master Jacque Mahay, as admiral, in the
good ship Erasmus.

The chief pilot of the fleet was an Englishman, William
Adams, born in " Gillingham, two miles from Rochester, and
one mile from Chatham, where the Queen's ships do lie." This
"Kentish Iman " was a true and loyal subject of Queen
_ Elizabeth, but he was ready, like many Englishmen of that
time, to serve wherever he had good opportunity, provided
it was not among the Spaniards and other enemies of free and
Protestant England. He gives account of himself and of his
voyages in letters to his wife, which were fortunately pre-
served, and published by Purchas, the Collector of so many
curious and valuable records of old travel and adventure.

Of his previous life, this is what Will Adams tells 2--" I was
from the age of twelve brought up in Limehouse, near London,
being 'prentice twelve years to one master, Nicholas Diggins,

and have served in the place of master and pilot in- Her
' I2 . Wz'zzzm Adams, the

Majesty's ships, and about eleven or twelve years served
the Worshipful Company.of Barbary Merchants, until the
Indian traffic from Holland began, in which Indian trafiic I
was desirous to make a little experience of the small knowledge
which God hath given me." He was thus a well-trained
and experienced mariner,' this pilot of the Dutch expedition
under Admiral Jacque Mahay. -

The fleet sailed on the 24th of June, as we are told; but
as there is some confusion about exact dates in old style and
new style reckoning, let it be about the middle of the year
I 598 Voyages m those days were seldom swift, and provisions
not of the most wholesome kind, so we are not surprised to '
learn that sickneSs broke out--scurvy, most likely--and they
, were glad to touch on the coast of Guinea for rest and refresh-
ment. Before they sailed again, the Admiral and many of his
men died. It was not till April of next year, 1599, that
they reached the Straits of Magellan, having decided to reach
the Indies by way of the South Seas. In so long a voyage the
ships could not expect to keep in company, and Moka, on
the coast of Chili, was appointed as the place of rendezvous.
The Erasmus arrived here 1n due course, but after waiting till
the month of November for her consorts, only one turned
up, the pilot of which was a friend and countryman of
Will Adams, "one Timothy Shotten, who had been with
Master Cavendish in his voyage round the world."

'Two of the ships were never heard of, and are supposed
to have foundered at sea. A third fell into the hands of
Spaniards, or pirates, for they Were much the same in
those days.

On the American coast the two remaining ships had hard.
times of it from the same enemies The captain of the
Erasmus, when on shore to purchase supplies for the half-
starving crew, was attacked and slain, with several of his men,
among whom, says Adams, was " my poor brother Thomas,
and they left scarce so many .men whole as could weigh
our anchor." The sister ship fared no better. The captainPioneer .Englzls/zman in japan. 3

and twenty-seven men were killed in another afi'air on that
coast. .

The brave and resolute survivors in the two ships chose
new captains, and then " held a council as to what they should
do to make their voyage most profitable. At last it was-
resolved to go for Japan,- for by the report of Derrick Ger- '
ritson, who had been there with the Portugals, woollen cloth
was in great estimation in that island; and we gathered,
by reason that the Malaccas and the most part of the East
Indies were hot countries, woollen cloths would not be
much accepted. Therefore it was We all agreed to go to Japan."

A very wise and shrewd resolution, arrived at unanimously.

' There were no 'f cotton goods" in those days to export from
our factories; the woollen manufacture and good broadcloth .
formed the staple of English trade in the rough old times
when the Lord Chancellor literally sat upon a woolsackl
Adams had made woollen stuff the substance of his share
of the cargo, and probably had advised others to do the same.

On the 29th of November, 1599, the two ships, piloted
by William Adams and Timothy Shotten, started on the long
voyage across unknown waters. They bore up. bravely
before the south-east trade-wind, but so little did they know
about winds and weather in these parts of the ocean, that'
this curious entry appears in the narrative, "The wind con-

tinued good for divers months "I
But after they got beyond the reach of the trade-winds,

and after various perils and adventures in strange island
channels, sailing northward from the equator, they gradually
came to regions of stormy winds and angry seas. On the
24th of February the Erasmus parts finally from her'con-
sort, and Timothy Shotten is heard of no more. He is
supposed to have gone down at sea--a less horrible fate
than that of eight of his fellow- seamen, who had been killed and
eaten by the natives of some cannibal island of the South Sea.

The Erasmus still held on towards Japan, and on the
24th of March Adams records: "We saw an island called .4 WWW Adams, t/ze

Una Colonna, at which time many of our men were sick
and divers dead. Great was the misery we were in, having no
more than nine or ten men able to go .or creep upon their knees;
our captain and all the rest looking every hour to die. But on
the 11th of April, 1600, we saw the high land of Japan
near unto Bungo, at which time there were no more than five
men of us able to go.~' The 12th of April we came hard to
Bungo, where many country barques came aboard us, the
people whereof we willingly let come, having no force to resist
them ; and at this place we came to an anchor."

It was a sorry plight for them to be in on their first arrival
at the long-sought land of hope and promise--Cipango, or
Zipangu of old Marco Polo, the Venetian traveller, 'who
had three hundred years. before brought to Europe tales about
its fabulous wealth and high civilization. These rumours had
spread through Europe, and had kept alive the desire for
better knowledge of the mysterious island. Since the first
voyage of Columbus, thereaching of Cathay and Cipango,
and all the rich regions of the Indies, had become a passion
with voyagers and explorers, and merchant men were keenly
watching the results of their enterprizes and explorations.

These Dutchmen were not, however, the first to see the
golden islands, as they soon found to their cost. There were
enemies in the country more to be dreaded than even the
perils of the sea and the dangers of sickness, from which
William Adams and his few and weakened comrades had
'been delivered.

" After we had been there " (in Bungo), wrote the English
pilot, "from five to six days, a Portugal Jesuit, with other
Portugals" (so they always then called the Portuguese), "and
some Japanese, that were Christians, came from a place called
Nagasaki, which was ill for us, the Portugals being our mortal
enemies; who reported that we were pirates, and were not in
the way of merchandizing." .

The Tycoon, or executive Emperor of Japan, was at that
time at Osaka, and when the arrival of the ship at Bungo was
reported to him, the Crew thereof being not Pdrtuguese nor'
Spanish, he ordered that the' pilot and one of the seamen

should be brought before him, the captain being too ill- to

move. The Jesuit and-the Portugals had no doubt given a

very dreadful account of these strangers, as being' not only

pirates, worthy of instant death, which was the penalty of that

crime, but doubly deserving crucifixion, as being heretics, and

foes of the true faith (of the Portugals). _

It was a serious crisis, and Will Adams probably had small
prospect of safety When he said good-bye to his sick captain
and shipmates; nevertheless, adds he, " I commended myself
into His hands that had preserved me from 'so many perils on
the sea." .

Brought before the Tycoon, and questioned through an
interpreter, " I showed him," says Adams, " the name of our
Country, and that our land had long sought out the way by
sea to the East Indies." Having explained that this was for
purposes of commerce, the Tycoon asked whether our country '
had wars '1' "I answered him,' yea,' with the Portuguese and
Spaniards, being at peace with all other nations." ' '

Now the Tycoon, who had not long since succeeded to the
dignity,hadnoloveforPortugueseorSpaniards. Hispredecessor,
Taiko-sama, had actually commenced a stern persecution-of the,
Jesuit missionaries, as suspected of political intrigues as well
as disturbers of the people, and several priests had been put to
death in the year before he died. The Jesuits hoped that the
new Tycoon would be less hostile, and, in fact, at the commence-
ment of his rule there seemed to be full tolerationu The
missionaries made good use of their time. It is estimated that
their export of silver alone at this epoch was about two millions
of taels every year, besides gold and other "valuables. At
least, this is'asserted by Kaempfer, the early historian of Japan,
who represents these Romish emissaries as kee'n traders under
the guise of devout missionaries. Making due allowance for
Kaempfer being a Dutchman, there' 15 no doubt that the Spanish

V and Portuguese Jesuits' 1n those times knew how to make the6 . 'I/Vz'llz'am Adams, t/ze

best of both worlds, and the warrant of the Tycoon for the
death of the three priests, still extant among the Imperial
records, says that they were condemned to death for ".having
come from the Philippines to Japan under the pretended title
of ambassadors, and for having persisted in my land, and
preached the Christian religion against my decree."

All this was well known to the Tycoon, before whom
William Adams now stood. He no doubt heard .without _
displeasure that the new-comers were no friends of the Portu-
gals or Spaniards, and were of a different religion from that
3 which had proved troublesome to the empire. He gave orders
that the two men should be kept in prison, and a little later he '
ordered that the ship be brought up to Osaka. For thirty-
nine days Adams and his shipmate remained in custody, full
. of anxiety about the fate of themselves and their friends. The
Jesuits used every means to influence the Tycoon, and when
the Erasmus at length arrived they redoubled their cruel
efi'orts, again affirming that these strangers were pirates and
robbers, as well as foes to their people, and saying that "if
justice was executed upon us it would terrify the rest of our
nation from coming there any more." " To this intent," says
_Adams, " they daily sued to His Majesty to cut 115' off."

Perhaps their zeal overshot its mark; at all events, the
h'eathen ruler proved more humane than the so-called Chris-
tian missionaries, for " the Emperor answered them, _that
because their two countries were at war, it was no reason why,
to please Portugals, he should slay Dutch and Englishmen l'"
'With keen satire the political appeal was thus disposed of,
and though the Emperor made no reference to the religious
difierences, the charitable state of mind in the Jesuits can be
easily guessed; while honest Bill Adams piously expresses
his thankful feeling in the words, " Praised be God for ever and
ever!" ,- .. , '

When the ship arrived, the pilot and the seamen were
received by their comrades with wonder and " much shedding
of tears," for they had been told that Adams and his companion
had long since been put to death. They were all treated with
kindness and hospitality, and they soon recovered health and
spirits; but they and their good ship were never again to '
return to Europe. The Erasmus was ordered to the city of
Yeddo, the capital of the empire, and William Adams, whose
bearing and character seem to have favourably impressed the
Tycoon, was retained in the Imperial service. What became
of the rest-of the crew is not'stated, but they probably served
as seamen, or were otherwise employed in the land of their
enforced residence. 'We know that they were ordered to be
granted daily rations of rice, and tWelve kobangs_ of gold a _
year, as an Imperial allowance. The captain, we also know,
received permission to go as far as the Straits of Malacca in a
native vessel, and he was killed in an action with the Portu
guese, having joined the Dutch fleet there during the .fight.
None. of the other seamen were allowed to leave Japan.
Possibly the hint of the Jesuits had been taken, although not
in their fatal intent, that the sending away of these men might
bring others of their nation 1 '

Several years passed, Adams growing in favour and influence
at the Court of Yeddo, acquiring, no doubt, much knowledge .of
the people, and.their ways and language, but. never losing '
remembrance of his country and home in old England.

His time was turned- to good account for his new masters.
He had some skill in ship-building, and having built a -vessel
of 80 tons the Tycoon was greatly pleased. He afterwards
built a larger vessel of 120 tons, and made a cruise as
far as Miako Bay in her with a Japanese crew. But he
astonished the natives by more than skill in manual 'craft.
"Being in such grace and favour," he says, " by reason I
taught him (the Emperor) some points of geometry and the
mathematics, with other things, that what I said could not be
contradicted. At the which, my former enemies, the Jesuits
and Portugals, did greatly wonder, and entreated me to be-
friend them to the Emperor in their business; and so by my
means both Spaniards and Portugals have received friendship. s mum Adams, tlze

from the Emperor, I recompensing their evil unto me with
' good." '

What were the " other things" besides f' the mathematics'
which he showed to the Emperor we are left to conjecture,
but the narrative carries a very useful lesson to the young as
to the importance of a knowledge of practical, geometry in all
its branches, as well as skill in the use-of various tools and

instruments, and as much acquaintance as can be gained with
arts and sciences, as well as with mere grammar and literature,
whether in living or dead languages. How few of the boys
educated in our public schools could have risen to the position
and obtained the honour of Will Adams, the apprentice lad of
Limehouse l . With fair natural ability, he had always a thirst
for knowledge, and desire to add to his " experience" in what-
.ever circumstances he found himself.

The year I609 brought two events which caused a mighty
commotion in Japan, and in which Adams took no unimportant
part. A Spanish galleon, the San Francisco, returning from
Manilla to Acapulco in Mexico, and having on board the
Governor of the Philippines, was wrecked' on the coast of
Japan. Of the crew, one hundred and sixty souls perished.
The remainder, including the Governor, were very kindly
treated. The larger vessel, of 120 tons, built by Adams, was
placed at their disposal by the Emperor, and fitted out with
every means for proceeding on their voyage, which they did
in the same year, returning. it appears, to Manilla. How
the very name of " Spanish galleon," and such places as Manilla
and the Philippines, and Acapulco in Mexico, conjure up
visions of dollars and gold-pieces, and the rich freights of the
Argosies of those days! No wonder that pirates abounded,
and that in time of war the privateers scoured all the seas of
the world in quest of prizes !

This was what brought two Dutch privateers to the seas of

. Japan, in the same year that the Spanish galleon was wrecked
.there. The Dutchmen came to look after a Portuguese ship
which ran yearly from Macao to the land of the Tycoon.

3
They missed their prize, but they found themselves very
well treated; and professing willingness to engage in lawful
and peaceable'trade, the port of Firando was ceded to them '
for this purpose,' through the good offices and intercession
of William Adams. They returned to Europe to make
arrangements for the opening of regular trade, and Adams
took advantage of the opportunity for sending letters home.
These are the letters which have found an abiding and
interesting place of record in the pages of Purchas.

' The Dutch East India Company must have watched

anxiously and waited wearily for the ships sent out by them

so long ago as I598, and must have wondered why. no tidings

ever came of them. Adams, and the other survivors of the

crew of the Erasmus, must also have often wondered what .
people at home were saying of them, whether they were still
anxiously looked for, or given up as hopelessly lost. There
was at least a hope of opening communication with the lands
and people to which their thoughts and affections so often
had been travelling. The disappointment at not being allowed
to depart with the Dutch ships must have been great, but if
these got to Holland in safety there was hope of his being
heard of by his family and friends, and of receiving tidings
through those who would come to Japan. Meanwhile he is
in good quarters so far as outward affairs go. Through the
kindness and generosity of the Emperor he has a living "like
unto a lordship in England, with eighty or ninety husbandmen,
who are as my servants and slaves,"--living the life, in fact, of
a country squire or nobleman. He has a high opinion of the
people and nation where his lot is now cast. " The people are
good of nature, courteous above measure, and valiant 1n war.'

And as to the govarnment, "I think no land better governed
in the world by civil policy' 50 he urges his countrymen to
come to trade, and have dealings with such a people, ending
that letter with a touching utterance of patient submission and
pious prayer about what was still nearest to his heart, the
thought of his dear wife and children. "Patiently," he writes,
"' I>>_wait the good will and pleasure of God Almighty, desiring
all those to whom this letter may come, to use means to
acquaint my good friends-with it, and so my wife and children
may hear of me ; by which means there may be' hope that I
may see them before my death--which the Lord grant to His
glory and my great comfort. Amen." '
This was written and sent in 1611. How the next year
passed with him we do not hear, but in 1613 the startling
news came to Yeddo that an English ship had arrived, and-
was at anchor in the port of Firando. The Governor of that
place sent. for Adams, in the meantimetreating the newly-
arrived Englishmen with marked attention. Adams found the
ship to be the Clove of London, belonging to the East India
Company, and commanded by Captain John Saris, who was
furnished with a letter from King James 1., and suitable presents
for the Emperor, whose friendship and good ofl'ices he was
charged to seek, in_ order' to arrange a treaty of commerce.
-The good ship Clove had left the Thames so far back as April
18th, 1.61 I, and had spent more than two years in the voyage,
trading at' various ports, 'as' the custom then was, and not
' reaching Firando till the 11th of June, 1613. Captain Saris
little knew how efficient and influential a fellow-countryman
he was to find in Japan. After consultation, and despatch of
various messages, it was arranged that the captain and ten of
his Englishmen shOuld attend the Emperor at Yeddo, to which
place they set out early in August, bearing the royal letter and
the-presents. The interview and audience came ofi' splendidly.
The Tycoon was delighted with the frank and dignified bearing
of Captain Saris, and with the advice of Adams a. treaty was
concluded between the Emperor of Japan and the King of
Great Britain, by which the most important privileges were
granted--far beyond what had ever before been conceded to a
foreign power, and, in fact, beyond what are now possessed. .
The tone of the whole treaty may be gathered from the first
article, which was as follows z--i' We give free license to the
' subjects of the King of 'Great Britain--viz., Sir Thomas Smith,
Governor, and the Company of the East India Merchants and
adventurers, for ever safely to come into any of our ports of
our Empire of Japan, with their ships and merchandize, with-
out any hindrance to them or their goods ; and to abide, buy,
sell, and barter, according to their own manner with all
nations ;. to tarry here as long as they think good, and to
depart at their pleasure." ~ Other articles of the treaty gave
freedom from customs, tolls, and duties ; liberty of transit by
sea or land'; right to build and to possess property; orders for
instant payment for all goods delivered; dispensing with
permits and passports,-and a variety of other rights and privi-
leges, the extent and liberality of which the more surprise us,
from knowing the subsequent history of Japanese relations
with foreign nations. But the Tycoon of that period, Tyeyas,
was an enlightened and liberal ruler, and he had for his chief
adviser in the matter William Adams. Captain Saris took his
departure, highly" gratified by his receptionr'and bearing a
letter from the Tycoon to King James, 'ofl'ering a hearty
welcome to his subjects, complimenting the English people
for their Worthiness and their skill in navigation, and promis-
ing that "in their honourable enterprise of discoveries and
merchandizing, they shall find the said Tycoon further them
according to thei: desires."

The chief station or headquarters of the English trade was
to be at the port of Firando, where the Dutch also had their
factory. William Adams seems to have'entered the employ-
ment of the East India Company, and to have resided at
Firando as interpreter in the English factory, which was
under .the charge of a Mr. Richard Cookes, .as consul and
manager. He probably remained there till his death, which
is supposed to have been in or about the year I619. He had
long resigned himself to perpetual exile, and we have no doubt
that the consolation of true piety, which marked his whole
character, sustained and cheered him. His name will always
be remembered with respect and honour. .

It does not belong to this article to. follow further the course, .I 2 William A dams.

of events in Japan. After the death of Adams, and after
' Sustaining loss 'in their Japanese trade, the East India Com-
pany retired from the'station, and the factory at Firando
was voluntarily abandoned. It was given up just in time.
Not long after a new policy succeeded in the Government
of Japan. The persecution of the Christians, of which they
had had before some experience, broke out with great fierce-
ness. The intrigues and misconduct of the Romish priests
and missionaries no doubt provoked the attack, and caused
an illiberal and intolerant treatment of all foreigners. The
Portuguese and Spaniards were forcibly expelled, and the
Dutch were permitted to remain only under the .most
humiliating conditions, their traders being confined to the
island of Deshima, near Nagasaki. They were not allowed
to set foot on any other part of thersoil.of the Empire, and
when carrying a tribute to the Emperor, they were conveyed
in closed carriages, without being permitted to hold com-
munication with the people. "Not a Christian shall remain
in Japan," had been the declaration of an Imperial edict,
and the Dutchmen imprisoned at Decima hardly owned them-
selves as Christians. The Japanese had borne long enough
the interference of 'meddlesome foreigners, and in 1637 an
Imperial interdict was published, of which one clause thus.
runs :--" No Japanese ship or boat whatever, nor any natives
of Japan, shall presume to go out of the country; and who-. *
soever acts contrary to this shall be put to death, and
the ship and goods shall be forfeited; and all Japanese
who return from abroad shall be put to death."

Thus commenced the policy of exclusion and seclusion
which marks the history of Japan for the next two centuries.
In 1673 the English made an attempt to reoccupy their
former factory; but there was no William Adams now at
Court. to be their advocate with the Emperor. The Dutchmen
at Decima did not choose to remember that they owed their
introduction 'to Japan to the English pilot,' and' they had
the craft to inform therGovernment'that the English King, _-1m mun murumm. m- mmm. ox mmmu. jnl'AS. (fax: .2,A Strange Election and a Stranger Auction. I 3 I

Charles 11., was married to the daughter of the King of
Portugal. The old religious animosity was thus awakened, '
and the Japanese authorities courteously, but firmly, refused
permission for the English to trade. The Dutch retained a
monopoly of commerce, such as it was, at Deshima, until
intercourse with the outer world was again opened. by the '
United States of America, little more than thirty years ago. .
The events that have since occurred are recorded in many.
well-known books, among which we may name Mr. Mossman's

A STRANGE ELECTION AND A STRANGER AUCTION.

N May 1862, William Talcott, an employe in the Pony'
Express Company, went to look for his ponies in the
nearest range of mountains, which was the Toyabe range,
in Nevada, United States. He took with him an Apache
Indian boy, who had been purchased not long before in
Arizona for a jack--knife and a pair of blankets. .When in
search for the ponies they struck a seam o'f greenish quartz, .
~which Talcott thought something like what he had seen in
a rich mining region. They carried bits of the rock to the
house of a Mr. O'Neill, and there they were seen by Mr.
Vanderbosch, an intelligent Dutchman, who immediately pro-
nounced a favourable opinion as to the "indications of silver"
contained in them. The traces of silver were slight, but- there
were metals usually found in connection with silver, especially
antimony and galcna, or lead ore. Specimens were sent to
Virginia city, to be tested by assay, with such results as to
attract immediate attention.I4 A Strange Election and '

Among those who heard of the discovery was one David
Buel, an enterprising miner and frontier's--man, who had spent
much of his time among the Indians of California. He started,
along with two friends, for the Reese River, as a small stream
in the locality had been called by a miner of the name of
Reese. This party of three prospected at several localities,
especially near a spot where the city of Austin was soon
to rise. Talcott's friends were also busily prospecting, and '
had made a settlement, which they called Pony Lodge, in
remembrance of the incident of Talcott and the Indian boy
seeking the strayed ponies. ' '

It is curious that the celebrated western explorer 'and path-
finder, Colonel Fremont, had passed near these places, but his
route lay a little further'to the south, and so he missed being
the discoverer of the new silver mines in'that part of Nevada.

Vanderbosch, Buel, O'Neill, Veatch, and many other miners
were now hard at work " prospecting " and " locating" in
various localities, and some of the claims turned Out to be rich
in silver ore. But we are not concerned with mining
operations in this narrative. We pass over the time that
intervened between the first discoveries, and the foundation

of Austin, as the chief place in the district.

Now it is a_ peculiarity of the American people that they
carry with them into every new territory their municipal
and political institutions. A " city ".of only a few houses,
and inhabitants consisting only of rough miners, must have
a Mayor and Common Council, with meetings, and election
eXcitements. No American can live without making speeches,
or hearing them, without holding office, or voting somebody
else into office. Austin was not exempt from this notable
feature of American life. _ '

The city charter was passed with due solemnity in April
1864. Public rejoicings followed, as a matter of course.
There was great excitement at that period touching the politi-
cal issues of the day. At Austin, Republicans and Democrats _
were pretty equally divided, the latter being known chiefly bya Stranger Auction. I 5

the name of Copperheads. The election of Mayor would test
the numerical strength of the two hostile parties. Every man
felt that not only local, but national interests, were concerned
in the result

There were two candidates, pretty fairly matched, for the
contest. On the Democratic side was David Buel, already
mentioned,--" Uncle Davy," as his fellow-citizens familiarly
called him,---a man of imposing presence, six feet four in height,
and large in proportion, and with a frank, off--hand manner
that endeared him to his fellow-miners. Mr. J. Ross-Browne,
an American traveller, who knew Buel well,_says that he was '
acting as "Government Indian Agent on the Klamath Reser-
vation" when he first met with him. "' I found him a remarkable
man in more respects than one. He was a man of grand
presence, of indomitable spirit, of superior intelligence, and
of great energy of character. He was an honest Indian agent,
the rarest work of God that I know of." A more popular
candidate could not have been chosen for his side. It was
expected that his personal claims would have carried a large
.portion of the Republican votes, and doubtless would have
done so at any other time. But party feeling then ran high,

and the Copperheads were regarded as little more than traitors
to the National and Union cause.

The other candidate was Charles Holbrook, a young man of
good character and great business capacity. He had recently
' erected a handsome store, built of cut granite, and was one of.
the' chief merchants of the rising town. His integrity was
undoubted, his professions great, and his political faith Ultra-
Union. 50 his chances were not to be despised in an election
which seemed likely to turn on public, more than personal,
qualifications. Each side was confident of success. '

As usual on such occasions, betting was largely made on the
result. One of these bets was of a somewhat eccentric
kind. Dr. Herrick made an agreement with Mr. R. C. Gridley
to_ ,the following effect--It Buel wins,' Herrick is to carry a-
sack of flour from Clifton to Upper Austin, the distance being
about a mile and a half, and uphill all the way. If Holbrook is
elected, Gridley is to carry a sack of flour from Upper Austin
to Clifton, having the advantage of the down-hill grade.

The battle was exciting, and was zealously and honourably
fought out on 'both sides. The betting did no harm, but
rather helped to keep' the people in good humour, especially
when not for money, but for such a. wager as thev'carrying

of the sack.of flour 1

Holbrook, the Republican candidate, was elected by a clear
majority. The sentiment of the people was sound, when it came
to the great question of maintaining the Union at all hazards.

Gridley, true to his engagement, was on hand at the
appointed time and place,'with his sack of flour. The whole
population turned out to witness the novel performance.
Laughter and good humour prevailed on all sides. Winners
and losers fraternized, and enjoyed the fun with equal gusto,
A grand procession was formed, headed by an energetic band
of music. The newly-elected officials, including His Honour
the Mayor, mounted on horseback, followed the musicians.
Next to them walked the hero of the scene, the redoubt-
able Gridley, with the sack of flour on his back. On each side
marched a standard-bearer, carrying high the flag of the Union.
Never 'was seen such a lively crowd in Austin. "Go it,
Gridley ; " " Stick to it, Gridley ;" "'Never say die, Gridley ;-"
were the encouraging words which greeted him as he plodded
on under his load.

On arriving at. Clifton, it was suggested by some enter-
prising genius, whose speculative spirit kept pace- with his
patriotism, that 'the sack of flour should be sold for the benefit
of the Sanitary Commission. This was a charitable-work
of which the good offices were devoted to the sick and wounded .
'of both sides, in the war and after. The proposition met with
unbounded applause. An empty barrel was quickly found,
and an auctioneer mounted on its end. The bidding 'was
lively, but only in small amounts, so that no large number
of dollars was offered for the flour. The auctioneer said
that the reserve price had not been reached, and announced
that another auction should be held at Austin. ~The sack
of flour was taken up again, Gridley insisting on being the
voluntary porter. The procession was re-formed, and marched
off this time to the tune of " Dixie."

The most uncompromising Copperhead was now won over,
and all united in common sympathy for the suffering soldiers,
and in real regret for the strife in their common country.
It was a clever stroke of policy for the Republicans.

The procession halted in front of the store owned by His
Honour the Mayor. By this time the crowd was enormous, and
the enthusiasm great. The miners from outlying claims had
gathered to the town, the business men had come from their
stores, women and children from their cottages and cabins.

The sack of flour was once more put up at auctiOn, with
a general hurrah. This time the bidders were in earnest.
They bid up twenties, and fifties, and even hundreds. some
bidding against themselves in their eagerness! Republicans '
and Democrats vied in the contest. The best feeling pre-
vailed, and three thousand dollars was the result.

The purchaser, amidst vociferous applause, donated his
purchase back to the Sanitary Fund. A third auction was
held on the following day. The result on this occasion was
nearly tWo thousand dollars.

The excitement fanned the patriotic fire in the breast of
Gridley. He resolved to make an institution of the sack of
flour at auction. He would immortalise it ; he would gather a
munificent sum as a donation for the sick soldiers, gathering
also a reputation for himself.

So Gridley set out on a tour with his sack of flour. It was
sold at Virginia City for eight thousand dollars, at Sacra--
mento for ten thousand dollars, and at San Francisco for about
fifteen thousand dollars. "I was witness," says Mr. Ross-
Browne, in one of his books of travel, "to the procession
in San Francisco. It was the notable event of the times.
Never did Montgomery Street present a more imposing appear-

ance. The beauty. and fashionvof the city were there, and. so
' was Gridley, decked out in glorious array, the' observed of all
observers. Thus did he draw the superfluous cash from the
pockets of the generous public, and thus did he good service
to the cause of humanity and freedom. All honour to Gridley l "

The grand finale was a gift of one hundred thousand dollars
to the Sanitary Commission I It was a noble speculation, the
humble origin of which we have narrated, as connected with
the Mayor's election at the little Nevada town of Austin.

On the strength of his fame, Gridley became interested,
along with other experienced financiers, in the establishment
of a bank in Austin, sufficient capital'being raised in New
York to commence it, under the name of the "First National

- Bank 01 Nevada."

 

CALlFORNlA'S FIRST START.

HE rapid increase of ' population and wealth in that
part of Western America known as " The Great
Pacific Slope "_ is one of the most notable events in the
history of the world. At the time when Queen Victoria
began her reign, the land of California was to Englishmen,
and even to the people of the United States, a term
incognila. In fact, before the Mexican war, when General
Jackson commanded the American army of invasion, these
regions had attracted little notice. They were far too
remote to tempt the most adventurous emigrants, and
seemed divided from the rest of the continent by unpassable
mountains and impossible distance. Here and there, in
the southern part of the region, a few Mexican squatters
had ranchos of unbounded extent, with cattle that were
killed only for their 'hides. Over the whole region wild
tribes of Indians roamed, numbering _at that time perhaps
hundreds of thousands. Gradually adventurous . hunters _Cafiform'a't Fm} Start. - .- 19

trappers, and traders came to the country;- but forty years
ago, in 1844, the whole white and half-breed population of Cali-
fornia did not exceed seven or eight thousand, with about
an equal number of domesticated Indians. 'The whole vast
territory was little better than a wilderness.

In 1845 the American Congress declared Texas to be
annexed to the Republic, as Mexico owed a debt 'of some
million of dollars, a debt which could neither be paid nor
repudiated. The war which followed led to' further annexa--
tion, and" the American flag was planted .in California.
Under the. protection of that flag, and in the confidenCe
which it gave, people from the States, and emigrants of
other nationalities, began to appear, streams of emigration

waggons slowly travelling over the pathless prairies and
across the rugged mountains, toward the lands of the. west.

In two or three years the population had doubled. Among
the earlier emigrants was one Captain Sutter, who had' a
large farm on the Sacramento River, where he had planted
. himself, building a fort, which he called New Helvetia.

An event was soon to occur, apparently, purely accidental,
but which now, on looking back upon it, will be recognized
as the providential means used by the Ruler of the world
for great and beneficial purposes. It had the efi'ect of
changing the whole face of the country, of attracting the
attention and stirring. the feelings of men, not only in
America, but in distant lands, and of drawing multitudes to
people a region hitherto almost uninhabited, and providing
homes, amidst riches and plenty, for-vast numbers of the
human race. In the course of a few years this event pro~
duced results which a century might not. have effected in
the ordinary march of civilization and rate of progress.

In the, winter of 1847-8 this Captain Sutter was build-
ing a saw-mill on the south. branch of the Sacramento
River. Mr. James 'Marshall, the contractor to erect the
mill, one day Alet water into the tail-race, in order to deepen
the channel. With the water was borne some sand and
mud, which was'de'posited. On looking down, Marshall saw
little bright grains among the sand. Picking some of it up,
examining it, and noticing its weight, he was certain that
he had particles of gold in his hand. Eager with excite-
ment; he ran to tell Sutte'r what he had found. The
captain, on hearing his words, and observing his excited
manner, thought at first he had gone mad, and kept an eye
on his loaded rifle. Marshall soon satisfied .him that he
was all right, and gave him the gold to examine for him-
self. -Both were now alike excited, and they hastened to
the' place, vowing to each other the utmost secrecy. But
they did not know. that they had been observed. A Mor-.
mon soldier, who happened to be within sight, was attracted .
by their movements, and closely watched them. from a
concealed spot. He was one of a band who had been
in the Mexican war, and with his companions was on his
way back to the States. The soldiers soon ascertained for
themselves what was the cause of excitement in Sutter
and Marshall. The secret was out, and rumour began its
usual course, with more than'usual speed and enlargement.
The news spread far and wide that gold was to be had
for the picking up in the sands of the "Rio de los Ameri-
canos," as that branch of the Sacramento was called in the
country. Birds of prey do not more rapidly and mysteriously

see or scent from afar the place of feeding than men
become aware of the existence of gold.

Before many days had passed, many hundreds of people
could be seen from Sutte1's savv- -mill, and swarms more
day by day arriving in the neighbourhood, armed with spades,
shovels, knives, sticks, and wooden b'owls, all searching in
the stream and the soil for the hidden treasure. As the
news spread, the rush increased--Spaniards, Mexicans,
Americans. -Then the tidings reached remote places; towns
were deserted, ships left crewless. An American clergy-
man--Dr. Todd, of Pittsfield--who visited California some
years after, and heard on the spot the legends of those days,
thus describes the events. --" Oregon on the north,
the Sandwich Islands on the West, Peru and Chili
on the south, poured in their eager diggers. Then China
felt the thrill, and her people flocked over; Australia sent
her convicts and rascals ,' and adventurers from all parts of
the earth, having nothing to lose, flew to California. The
Mexican war had just been closed, and thousands of young
men from the soldiery went to the land of gold. The
Eastern States caught. the fever, and emigrant waggons
uncountable hastened over the deserts, leaving the bones of
men and of animals to bleach along their path.

" On--on, to the land of gold ! ~Ho,' for California! Ships
went tossing round Cape Horn full of young men. England,
Germany, France, Italy, sent multitudes. At once the east
(of the United States) was aroused, and sent'fifty thousand
men a year for five successive years, and invested ninety-
two millions of dollars before any return was made. In a
time incredibly short there was at least a quarter of a
million of the wildest, bravest, most daring, and most.
intelligent young men digging for gold. There was no
female society, there were no homes to soften or restrain,
no laws, no police, and no magistrates. From the lakes
of the north to the' Gulf of Mexico, from the lumber- mills
of Maine to the settler on the Indian territories, the whole
land was moved. "

This is no exaggerated statement of the excitement
caused by the reported gold discoveries. We well remem-
be'r the influence of the news even in London Numbers
of -young men left their situations, and shop-keepers
gave up trade, in the hope of getting rich in a more rapid and
certain way. It was no uncommon sight to see shutters
closed, and a notice posted or chalked up, "Gone to the
diggings,'o or " Off to California " l

Nothing was thought of by these adventurers beyond the
hope of getting gold for the searching. Whether the search
would be SUCCessful, or whether the game would pay, was
seldom considered. It was a far-off land, where there were
neither houses nor shops, clothing nor food. Fabulous sums
are reported to have been paid for the most trifling articles. _
As a rare luxury, a so--called " saloon," composed of tar-
paulin, could now and then hang out the sign "Potatoes
this day," and crowds flocked to the costly entertainment.
Apples are known to have sold for- five dollars apiece in
gold! " Easy come, easy go," it was with such expenditure l

Worse than costly living, was the fearful gambling among
the diggers. Fortunes made in a day were lost in' a night
in these infamous gambling dens.

Now and then rumours came of new places where gold
had been found. Once, for instance, it was reported that a
rich field Was in Oregon, in- 'the black sand near the sea-
shore. In two days eight vessels from San Francisco were
advertised. to sail for the Gold Bluffs. The excitement
died at once when thousands had been disappointed.

Long afterwards there were still fresh reports and
repeated failures. Who does not remember the Fraser
River excitement? It was a thousand miles away, up in
_ British Columbia. Hundreds started off at once, in the
I next month 'nine thousand five hundred went, and in -three

months from the first notice nearly twenty .thousand had

gone from California 1 '

This article is not intended to be historical nor statisti-
cal, so we say nothing here about the amount of gold that
has been obtained Since the first year of its being dis--
covered, nor of the growth of California in population or in_
resources. Neither are we going to moralize about the lust
of gold, nor the habits and character of the digger. Let it
sufiice to say that here, as in Australia, and in all countries
and periods of the world, the miner's and digger's career
is, on the whole, not to be admired or'envied. A few find

.wealth, but the fate of the vast majority is poverty and
disease, disappointment and disaster. The object in recalling
this strange time of excitement is not to deal with per~
sonal conditions, but to refer to the providential circum-
stances by which a new region of the world was occupied,
and 'a mighty increase made. in the population and wealth
and influence of the great American Republic. That Republic
now bears dominion from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean,
and by the peopling of the Pacific Slope has added a vast
territory, available for supporting millions of civilized and
Christian men, For with all the faults and vices that pre-
vail among men of every race and Clinic, it is pleasant to
think that the influence of the United States is, on the
whole, conducive to the peace and prosperity, the civilization
and progress of the human race.

One curious and remarkable incident we must mention
before closing" this article. At first the digging or gathering
of gold and of silver, which was discovered in the Nevada -
ranges not many years after, was at best a rude and mechani-
cal work. For continuing the mining with success and profit,
Art had to be used, both in providing machinery and by
introducing chemical processes. -In the latter case the use of
an enormous quantity of mercury or quicksilver is required.
It will add to our admiration of the providential arrange-
ment to which we have referred when it is stated'that the
discovery of vast stores of quicksilver was also the result
of what we call a lucky accident. 'Not long before the gold
discovery, a Mexican officer met a tribe of Indians with their
faces resplendent with vermilion colour. He knew that this
paint comes from Cinnabar, an ore of quicksilver. By a
bribe, he induced the Indians to show him the place where '
they got the ore. What followed, and how from the ore
the mercury is obtained, and how the rich mines have been
utilised, need not here be described; but we cannot avoid
remarking how seasonable this discovery also was, and
how it worked along with the gold discovery in securing
_ the settlement of the great State of California
AT THE COURT OF THE GREAT MOGUL.

N the year A.D. 1600, the first charter was granted to'
I the East India Company by Queen Elizabeth. The
trade of England with India continuing to increase, King
James the First. resolved to send an ambassador, or special
envoy, to the Emperor of Hindustan, commonly called the
' Great Mogul. The object of the embassy was to obtain a
treaty of peace and amity between .the King of Great
Britain and his Indian Majesty; to secure for English sub-
jects freedom of trade in all ports of India; and in various
ways to advance the commercial interests of England, by
' such protection and privileges as could be granted by the
mighty Ruler of the East. _

The Mogul of this period was Jehan Guire, the tenth in
descent from Timour-Leng (the lame prince), better known
as Tamerlane, the renowned conqueror. Timour married
the only daughter of those nations or tribes of Great Tartary
called Moguls. Hence the- name borne by the conquerors
and rulers of Hindustan, or Indostan, the country of the
Hindus, or Indians. By successive conquests these rulers
now bore sway over all the regions from China to the
Caspian, and from the mountains to the sea. Candahar,
Cashmere, Cabul, the Punjab, Agra, Delhi, Gwalior, Gujerat,
Bengal, these are but a few of the principalities and powers
mentioned as being under the dominion of Shah Selim
Jehan Guire, the Great Mogul, at the beginning of the
seventeenth century. The rulers in different regions were
not all of the Mogul race; some were Persians, Arabs, or
Turks, while other territories were left under their native
Indian rajahs or kings, who were tributaries of the Moham-
medan Suzerain, the Great Mogul.

'Sir Thomas Roe was the ambassador sent by James'A't tfie Court of '15:; Great Mogul. ' 25

the' F i'rst, having with him many curious and valuable articles
from the western world as presents, and accompanied by a_
small retinue, including a, chaplain and an artist. Sir Thomas
kept a minute journal of his travels, and of his residence at
the court of the Mogul, portions of which are published in
various old collections of travels, both in English and foreign
languages. The journal extends over three years--1614, 1615,
1616. Even at this distance of time, and under the strangely-
altered conditions of English intercourse with India, there are
many things recorded by Sir Thomas Roe full of interest.

' On March 6th, 1614, the Lizard light was lost sight of,
and the course begun for the Cape of Good Hope. On the
26th the African coast was descried; Cape Bodajor east
by south on the 27th ; April 14th the Line was crossed ; May
2nd the tropic of Capricorn; and on June zrst they arrived
at the Cape. Saldanha Bay and Penguin Island were the
only places at which anchor was cast. At Saldanlia
the natives are described as " the most barbarous people in
the world," "eating carrion," " having no clothes but skins
wrapped upon their shoulders," and "their houses.but a
mat, rounded at the top like an oven, which they turn as
the wind changes, having no door to keep it out." There
are, at the same time, " cows in abundance, antelopes, baboons,
pheasants, wild geese, ducks, and many other sorts." On the
Isle of Penguin "is a sort of fowl of that name, that goes
upright, his wings without feathers, hanging down like sleeves
faced with white. They do not fly, but only walk in parcels,
keeping regularly their own quarters. 'They are a sort
of .mixture of beast, bird, and fish, but most'bird!" The
Table Mountain is described as "11,853 feet-high." " The
bay is full of whales and seals."

They did not stop at the Cape, and on July 8th sighted
Madagascar, and anchored on the 22nd at Molalid, one of
the Comorese Islands. Of the Arab people inhabiting these
islands, with their government, customs, products, and their
trade with the Mozambique mainland, details are given. On
August the 2nd they weighed and stood for Socotora ; recross-
ing the equinoctial line northward on the 10th; making
Cape Guardafui, at the entrance to the Red Sea, on the
18th, and coming to anchor in Delicia Bay, Socotora, on 'the
24th August. Socotora, or Socotra, is the Dioscuria of the
ancients, well known in their commerce and havigation. The
people then, as.now, being Mohammedans,'were ruled by
an, Arab Sultan, son of a great sheikh in Arabia Felix. The
king received the English embassy with much courtesy,
coming to the shore on horseback with about three hundred
men, armed some with muskets, some with bows, and all
with good swords." "He'had a very good turban, but was
barefooted." " He was so absolute that no man could sell
anything but himself, his people sittingabout him very
' respectfully." Mr. Boughton, one of the embassy, went to
see the king's house at the chief town--Tamara. He found
it." such as would serve an ordinary gentleman in England.
The lower rooms served for warehouses and wardrobe,
some changes of robes hanging about the walls, and with them
about twenty-five books of their law, religion, history, and
saints' lives. No man was permitted to go upstairs to see
his wives, which were three, nor the other women;
but the ordinary sort might be seen in the town, with their
ears full of silver rings." - For dinner Mr. Boughton had fowl
with rice, and for drink water and " cahu, black liquor, drank
as hot as could be endured "--;no doubt cafe noir, or coffee, with
which evidently Sir Thomas Roe was not acquainted. A
priest was at service in the mosque, which they visited.
(Some remains were seen. of crosses and images, showing
that Christians formerly had been in the. island. Some of .
the older inhabitants of the island were seen--a poor,
unclothed, savage people. Aloes and certain gums seemed
the'chief trade products of the island;

They weighed anchor on August 3fst, and steered their
course for Surat, where-they landed on the 26th of September.
Surat, near the mouth of the river Taptee, which flows'
into the Gulf of Cambay, was in old times the chief port on
the western side_ of. India, being then, as Bombay now is

the first place reached by all voyagers by the 'Red Sea
route. It is still the favourite port for the embarcation oi
Mohammedan pilgrims to Mecca. On the arrival of the

English ambassador, he was received by the principal
officers of the town in an open tent. Much discussion, took
place as to the payment of duties, and searching the persons'
of the servants of the ambassador; but at last all'were .per-
mitted to proceed to a house provided for them, where they
remained till the 30th of October, "suffering much," says

Sir Thomas Roe, " from the Governor, who by force searched

many chests, and took out what he thought fit." What caused

so long a tarrying as five weeks is not explained, but possibly
the Governor had despatched swift messengers to announce
the arrival of. the unusual and important strangers on the coast.

They left Surat " on the 30th aforesaid," and travelled very
leisurely northward towards Ajmere, or Adsmere as Sir'
Thomas calls it," where the Court -of the Mogul then was.

It was not till near the middle of the seventeenth century,
~ under Shah Jehan, son of Jehan Guire, that new Delhi rose
' near the ruins of the ancient Delhi, and attained to the
magnificence it reached in and after the reign of Shah Jehan,
of his son Aurungzebe, and of later Moguls.

Of the journey to Ajmere we must give very brief notice, as.
our space will be better occupied with particulars about the
Mogul and his court. On the third day after leaving Surat
they entered the kingdom of " Pardassha, a pagan lord of - '
the hills, subject to nobody,"----for there were some of the
ancient people, as everywhere in mountain countries; who-.
long retain freedom and independence. Six days from Surat,
at Nundcrbar, they tasted bread for the first time-on the
journey, as " the Banians who inhabit the country make no
bread, but only- cakes. The country is plentiful, especi-
' ally of cattle, the banians killing none' or selling any to
be killed. One day I met ten thousand bullocks loaded
with corn, in one drove, and most days after lesser
parcels." At one place, having pitched the tents outside a
town or village, "the king's officers attended me all night
with thirty horse and twenty shot (armed men), for fear of
the robbers on the mountains, because I refused to remove
into the town." The towns were mostly collections of mud-
built huts, with stone buildings occasionally, when there
were persons of importance or wealth. On the fourteenth
day they reached " Brampore," " which I'guess to 'be 223
miles from Surat." At Batharpore, a village two miles
short of - Brampore, there was a prince, or rajah, to whose
presence he was conducted. " The officer told me as I
approached I must touch' the ground with my head bare,
'which I refused, and went on_ to a place right under him,
railed in, 'With an ascent of three steps, where I made him
reverence, and he bOWed his body; so I went within, where
were all the great men of the town, with their hands before
them like slaves. The place was covered overhead with a
rich canopy, and under foot all with carpets. It was like a
great stage, and the prince sat at the upper end of it. Having -
no place assigned, I stood right before him, he refusing to
admit me to come up the steps, or to allow me a chair.
Having received my presents, he offered to go into another
room, where I should be allowed to sit; but, by the way
he made himself drunk out of a case of bottles I gave him,
and so'the visit ended " .

In some parts of the journey, ruins of great extent and
- apparent magnificence were seen, "fair tOWers, many pillars,
and innumerable houses, but not one inhabitant." This was
in the country of Rama, "a prince newly subdued by the
Mogul, or rather brought to own subjection." This was in the
time of Echar Shah, father of Jehan Guire. Rama was said to
be lineally descended from Porus, the Indian king, overcome
by Alexander the Great The rest of the Journey was in a north-
westerly direction " to compass the hills," but after that due
north again, the whole distance to Ajmer being estimated at.
about 41.8 English miles. Ten months had passed since the
Embassy left England, and at last they had come near the
presence of the Great Mogul. We now use the words of Sir
Thomas Roe,

January the Ioth, I went to court at four'in the afternoon to
the Durbar, where the Mogul daily sits to entertain strangers,
receive petitions and presents, give out orders, and to see and
be seen. And here it will be proper to give some account of
his court. None but eunuchs come within that king's private
lodgings, and his women, who guard him with warlike
weapons. These punish one another for any ofi'ence com-
mitted. The Mogul every morning shows himself to the
common people at a window that looks into.the plain before
his gate. At noon he. is there again to see elephants and
wild beasts fight, the men of rank. being under him within
a rail; Hence he retires to sleep. Aftennoon he comes to
the Durbar aforementioned. After supper at eight of the
clock he comes down to the Guzalcan, a fair court, in the
midst whereof is a throne of free stone, on which he sits, or
sometimes below in a chair, where none are admitted but of
the first quality, and few of them without leave. Here he
discourses of indifferent things very afiably. No business of
state is done anywhere but at one of these two last places,
where it is publicly canvassed, and so registered; which
register might be seen for two shillings, and the common
people know as much as the council; so that every day the
king's resolutions are the public news, and exposed to the
'censure of every scoundrel. This method is never altered
unless sickness or drink obstruct it ; and this must be known, '
for if he be unseen one day without a reason assigned, the
people would mutiny; and for two days no excuse will serve,
but the doors must be opened, and some admitted to see him
to satisfy others. On Tuesday he sits in judgment at the
Jarruco, and hears the meanest person's complaints, examines
both parties, and'often sees-execution done by his elephants. '

Before my audience, I had obtained leave to use the customs
of my country. At the Durbar Iwas conducted right before
him; entering the- outward rail, two noble slaves ' met to
conduct me nearer. At the first rail 1 made a low reverence,
at the next another, and when under the king 2; third. The
place is a great court, to which all sorts of people-resort. The
king sits in a little gallery overhead ; ambassadors, great
men, and strangers of quality within the inmost rail under
him, raised from the ground, covered with canopies of velvet
and silk, and good carpets under foot. The next degree, like
our gentry, are within the first rail, the cor'nmonalty without in
a lower court, yet so that all may see the king. In fine, it is
rising by degrees like a theatre. His reception was very
favourable, but needs not particularizing.

The next day being the 12th.of March, I went to visit the
king, and delivered him a present, where I saw abundance of
wealth, but being of all sorts put together without order, it did
not look so regular. .The same day the son of Rama, thenew
tributary before mentioned, did his homage, touching the
ground three times with his head. The thirteenth at nightI
had audience at the Guzalcan, and pressed to have the peace
and commerce with England settled after a solemn manner, I
and all the articles settled, which the Mogul ordered should be
done. The fifteenth Iwent again in the evening to the Norose,
and according to the Mogul's order chose my place of standing,
which was on the right hand of him on the rising of the throne,
the Prince and~'young Rama standing on the other side; so'I
had a full view of what was to be seen--presents, elephants,
horses, and women. The twenty-third the Mogul condemned
one of his own nation upon suspicion of felony; but being one
of the handsomest men in India, and the evidence not 'very
clear against him, he would not sufl'er him to be executed, but
sent him to me in irons for a slave to dispose of at my will.
This is looked-upon as a great favour, for which I returned
thanks: adding, that in England we had no slaves, nor thought
it lawful to make the image of God'equal to a beast, but that I
would use him as a servant, and if he behaved himself well,
give him his liberty.' This the Mogul was well pleased with.
The twenty-sixth I went to the Guzalcan, and delivered the
articles I had drawn up, which were referred to Asaph Chan,
who a while after sent to me to remove from the standingI
had taken before the king, because. I stood alone, and that was
not the custom. Irefused at first, but he insisting I should
rank myself among the nobility, I removed to the other side,
to the place where only the Prince and young Rama were;
which more disgusted Asaph Chan, who persuaded the Prince
to complain of me, Which he did; but the Mogul having. heard
their complaint, and my answer, that I removed by Asaph
Chan's order, aHSWered, I had done well, and they Were in the
wrong to offer to displace me in,his sight. So I kept my
place in quiet. I
The substance of the articles delivered to the Great Mogul
was : I. That there be perpetual peace and amity between the
King of Great Britain and His Indian Majesty. 2. That the
subjects of England have free trade in all ports of India. 3.
That the governors of all ports publish this agreement three
times upon the arrival of any English ships. 4. That the
,merchants and their servants shall not be searched, or ill used.
5. That no presents sent to the Mogul shall be opened. 6.
That the English goods shall not be stopped above twenty-four
hours at the custom-house, only to. be there sealed and sent to
the merchant's house, there to be opened and rated within six
_ days after. -7. That no governor shall take any goods by
force, but upon payment at the owner's price ; nor any taken
upon pretence of the king's service. 8. That the merchants
shall not be hindered selling their goods to whom they please,
or sending them to other factories, and this without paying
any other duty than what is paid at the port. 9. That what-
soever goods-the English buy in any part of the Mogul's '
dominions, they may send down to the ports without paying
any duty more than shall be agreed on at the port at shipping
them, and this without any hindrance or molestation. 10.
That no goods brought to any port shall be again opened, the
English showing a certificate of their numbers,'qualities, and
conditions, from the governor or officers of the place where
they Were bought. II. That no confiscation shall be made of
the goods or money of any English dying. 12. That no
custom he demanded for provisions during the stay of English
ships at any port. 13. That the merchants' servants, whether
English of Indians, shall not be punished or beaten for doing
their duty. I4. That the Mogul will punish any governor or
officer for breach of any of these articles. I 5 That the,
English ships shall suffer all others to pass and repass freely
to the Mogul's ports, except their enemies; and that the
English ashore shall behave themselves ciVilly as merchants.

16'. That they shall yearly furnish the Mogul with all rarities
from Europe, and all other such things as he shall desire at
reasonable prices. I7. The English to pay the duty of
3% per cent. for goods reasonably -rated, and 2 per
cent. for pieces of eight, and no other duty elsewhere. 18-
That the English shall be ready to assist the Mogul against all
his enemies.- Lastly, That the Portuguese may come into this

-. peacewithin six months; or if they refuse, the English to be

at liberty to exercise all hostilities against them. These were
the articles presented, but they were delayed and opposed, and
what was the conclusion we shall see hereafter.

The 3Ist of March the Mogul dined at Asaph Chan's house,
all the way from the palace to it, which was an English mile,
being laid under foot with silks and velvets sewed together,
but rolled up as the King passed. They reported the feast
and present cost six leclgs (lacs) of rupees, which is PS60,000
sterling."'

From this time Sir Thomas Roe continues his journal as
before; but there being'nothing in it remarkable for many
days, all the business being soliciting for money due to mer-
chants, and such other affairs, in which there is nothing worth

"' Thevenot says a lac is 100,000 rupees, and arupee worth a crown
French and five sols, after which rate the six lacs must have been in those
days at least PS150_ooo sterling. The rupee is now less than 2.1-.
observing, that part is thought fit to be wholly left out
here, as it was also done by Purchas in his account of this
embassy.

The month of July passed most away in soliciting the prince
to sign and seal the articles Ihad presented to the king, of
which an abstract was given before. On the I 3th at night I
went to the Durbar to visit the king, who sent Asaph Chan to
tell me he was informed I had an excellent painter at my
house, which I told him was only a young man that drew upon
paper, and that very indifferently; 'however, I promised to
bring him to His Majesty, who at this time used so many
expressions of kindness to me that all men were amazed at it,
and proffered me anything I would ask for in his kingdom. I
Went from him to Asaph Chan's house, where I continued till
the king came out again, when I was conduCted back to him,
carrying with me Mr. Hughes, the supposed painter, with whom
the king had some discourse. After this I presented the king
with a curious picture I had of a friend of mine, which pleased
him highly, and he showed it to all the company. The king's
chief painter being sent for, pretended he could make as good ;
which I denying, a wager of a horse was laid about it between
me and Asaph Chan, in the Mogul's presence and to_please
him; but Asaph Chan afterwards fell off. This done, the
_Mogul fell to drinking of Alicant wine I had presented him,
giving tastes of it to several about him, and then sent for a full
bottle, and drinking a cup, sent it to me, saying, it began to.
sour so fast it would be spoiled before he could drink it, and
I had none. This done, he turned to sleep ; the candles were
popped out, and I groped my way out in the dark.

Nothing remarkable happened till August the 6th: Iwas
sent for to the Durbar, where I had much talk with the king,
who asked me many questions to satisfy his curiosity, and bid
me come to the Guzalcan at night, and I should see my picture
so exactly copied, that Ishould not know the one from the

other. I came at night, and he showed me six pictures, five of
them painted by his own painter, all pasted upon a board, and
3
so like, that by candle-light I could scarce know one from

another. Neither did I at first sight know my own, at which

the Mogul was much pleased ; but looking closer upon them I

_ showed it, and the difference between it andthe others. The
' Mogul was overjoyed, and I surprised at their art, not thinking
they could have performed so well ; and the king, after many
civilit'ies, promised me his own picture.

The I7th I'went to Visit the king, who as soon. as I came in,
called to his women, and reached out his own picture set in,
gold, hanging at a gold wire chain, with one pendant of foul
pearl, which he delivered to Asaph Chan, warning him not to
demand any reverence of me, but what I was willing to make ;
it being the custom, whensoever he bestows anything, for the
receiver to kneel down, and put his head to the ground, which
has been required of the ambassadors of Persia. Asaph Chan
came to me, and 'I offered to take it in my hand ; but he made
signs to take off my hat, and then he put it about my neck,
leading me right before the king. I understood not his mean-
ing, but feared he would require the custom of the country
mentioned above, which they call Size-Da, and was resolved
rather to return my present than submit to it.. He made signs
to me to. give the king thanks, which I did after my own
manner ,- whereupon some officers called to me to make the
Size-Da, but the king in the Persian tongue said, No, no. So
I returned to my place; but that you may judge of the king's
liberality, this gift was not worth in all PS30; yet was it'five

. times as good as any he gives in that sort, and looked upon as
aspecial favour. For all the great men that wear the king's
image, which none may do but those to whom it is given,'
receive only a medal of gold, as big as a Sixpence, with a little
chain of four inches to, fasten it on their heads, and this at
their own chargeq-some set it with stones, or adorn it with
.pendants of pearls. _

The 2nd of September was the king's birthday, and
kept with great solemnity. On this day the king is weighed
against some jewels, gold, silver, stufl's of gold, silver, and silk,
butter, rice, fruit, and' many other things, of every sort a- little,
which is all given to the Bramas or Bramans. The king com-
manded Asaph Chan to send for me to this solemn'ity, who
appointed me to come to the place where the king sits at '
Durbar, and I should be sent for in ; but the messenger mis-
taking, I went not till Durbar time, and so missed the sight ;
but being there before the king came out, as soon as he spied
me, he sent to know the reason why I came not in, since he
had ordered it. I answered according to the mistake, yet he
was very angry, and chid Asaph Chan publicly. He Was so I
rich in jeWels, that I own in my life I never saw such inestim--
able wealth together. The time was spent in bringing his
greatest elephants before him; some of which being lord
elephants, had their chains, bells, and furniture of gold and
silver, with many gilt banners and flags carried about them,
and eight or ten elephants waiting on each of them, clothed in
gold, silk, and silver. In this manner about tWelve companies
passed by most richly adorned, the first having all the plates
on his head and breast set with rubies and emeralds, being a
beast of wonderful bulk and beauty. They all bowed down
before the king, making their reverence very handsomely;
' this was the finest show of beasts I ever saw. The keepers of
every chief elephant gave a present. Than having made me
some favourable compliments, he rose up and' went in. At
night, about ten of the clock, he sent for me" I was then abed.
The message was, that he heard I had a picture whichI had
not showed him, desiring me to come to him and bring it;
and if I would not give it him, he'would order copies of it to
be taken for his women, Igot up, and carried it with me.
When Icame in, I found him sitting cross-legged on a-little
throne, all covered with diamonds, pearls, and rubies. Before
him a table of gold, and on it about fifty pieces of gold plate,
all set with jewels, some very great and extremely rich, some
of them of less value, but all of 'them almost covered with
small stones. His nobility about. him in their best equipage,
whom he commanded to drink merrily, several sorts of wine
standing by in great flagons. When I drew near, he asked
for the picture. I showed. him two ; he seemed astonished at
one of them, and asked whose it was. I told him a friend of
mine that 'was dead. He asked if I would give it him. I
answered I valued it above all things, but if His Majesty would
pardon me, and accept of the other, which was an excellent
piece, I would willingly bestow it on His Majesty. He thanked
me, and said he desired none but that picture, and if I would
give it him, he should prize'it above the richest jewel in his
house. I replied, I was not so fond of anything, but I would
part with it to please His Majesty, with other expressions
of respect. He bowed to me, and said it was enough, I had
given it him ; that he owned he had never' seen so much art,
so much beauty, and conjured me to tell him truly, whether
ever such a woman lived. I assured him there'did, but she
was now dead. He said hershould show it his women, and
take five copies, and if I knew my own I should have it again.
Other compliments passed, but he would restore it, his painters
being excellent at copying in 'water-colours. The other
picture being in oil, he did not like. Then he sent me word it
was his birthday, and all men made merry, and asked
whether I would drink with them. IanSWered, I would do
whatsoever _His Majesty commanded, and wished him many
' happy days, and that the ceremony might be renewed a hun-
dred years. He asked me whether I would drink wine of the
grape, or made, whether strong or small. I replied, what he
commanded, but hoped it would not be too much, nor too
strong.- Then he called for a gold' cup full of mixed wine, half
of the grape and half artificial, and drank; calising it to be
filled again, and then sent it by one of the nobles to me with
this message, that Ishould drink it of? twice, thrice, four or
five times for his sake, and accept of the cup and appurtenances
as a present. I drank a little, but it was stronger than any I
ever tasted; insomuch that it made me sneeze,.which made
, him laugh; and he called for raisins, almonds, and sliced
lemons, which were brought me on a gold plate, bidding me
'eat and drink what I would, and no more. I made reverence
for my present after my own manner, though Asaph Chan
would have had me kneel, and knock my head against the
ground; but His Majesty accepted of what I did. The cup
was of gold, set all about with small rubies and Turkey stones,
the cover with large rubies, emeralds, and Turkey stones in
curious works, and a dish suitable to set the cup on. 'The
value I know not, because the stones are many of them small,
and the greater, which are many, not all clean ; but they are in
number about two thousand, and the gold about twenty ounces.

Thus he made merry, and sent word he esteemed me more
' than ever he had done, and asked whether I was merry at
eating the wild boar sent me a few days before,.how I dressed
it, what I drank, assuring me I should want for nothing in his
country : the effects of all which his public favours I presently
found in the behaviour of all his nobility. Then he threw
about to those that stood below two chargers of new rupees,
and among us two charges of hollow almonds of gold and
silver mixed ; but I would not scramble, as his great men did,
for I saw his son take up none. Then he gave sashes of gold
and girdles to all the musicians and waiters, and to many
others. So drinking, and commanding others to do the same,
His Majesty and all his lords became the finest men I ever saw,
of a thousand several humours. But. his son, Asaph Chan,
two old men, the late King of Candahar, and myself forebore. -
When he could hold up his head no longer, he laid down to
sleep, and we all- departed.

Seven months were now spent in soliciting the signing and
sealing of the articles of peace' and commerce set down above,
and nothing obtained but promises from week to week, and
from day to day; and therefore on the 3rd September, the
English fleet being hourly expected at Surat, I went to the
prince, and delivered him a memorial containing the articles I
desired him to give an order to be observed for the unloading
of the ships: The articles were,

First, That the presents coming for the king and prince
should not be opened at the port, but sent up to court sealed I
by the custom-house ofl'icers. ' .

Secdndly, That curiosities sent for other presents, and for
the merchants to sell, should also be sent up to court sealed,
for the prince to take the first choice.

Thirdly, That the gross merchandize be landed, reasonably
rated for the custom, and not detained in the custom-house;
but that the merchants paying the custom have full liberty to
sell or dispose of it; and that the ships be supplied with pro-
visions without paying custom. ~

On the 4th, Asaph Chan sent me back my first articles, after
so long attendance and so many false promises, some of them
altered, others struck out, and an answer, that there was no
articling at all, but it was enough to have an order from the
prince, who was Lord of Surat, to trade there: but for Bengala
or Syndu, it should never be granted. Notwithstanding all
this vexation, I durst not change my method of proceeding, .or
wholly quit the prince and Asaph Chan : thereforeI drew up
other articles, leaving out what was displeasing in the former,
.and desiring Asaph Chan to put them in form, and procure
the seal, or else to give me leave to apply myself to the king,
to receive his denial, and depart the country. The substance
of the new articles was as follows. That all the subjects of
the Mogul should receive the English in friendly manner; to

'suffer them to land their goods peaceably; to furnish them
with provisions for their money, without paying any customs -
for them ; to have liberty, after paying custom for their goods,
to sell them to any person, and none to oblige them to sell any

. under rate; to have liberty to pass with such goods to any.
parts, without anything being exacted further of them more
than at the port; to have the presents for the Mogul and prince
sealed without opening, and sent to the ambassador; to have
the goods of any that die secured from confiscation, and
delivered to the other English factors; and in short, that no
injury in any sort be offered to any of them. '

The 8th of this month, Asaph Chan sent me word in plain
terms he would procure nothing for me sealed; but] might '
be satisfied with an order signed by the prince : which made
me resolve to apply myself directly to the prince, and apply
no more to Asaph Chan. Accordingly I was with the prince
the 10th, and the 11th he sent me an order, but so altered
from what I had given in, thatI sent it back. But at night I
received a new order from the secretary, containing all my
articles; though some words were somewhat ambiguous,
which the secretary interpreted favourably, and at my request,
writ to the Governor of Surat, explaining them to him as he
had done to me. He gave me many assurances of the prince's
favour ; and being a man not subject to bribery, I gave the more
credit to him. So I accepted of the order, which, when trans-
lated, Ifound very effectual. The 16th I visited the prince,
resolving to seem wholly to depend on him, till Ihad heard
what entertainment our ships met with. I found' him sad for
fear of Prince Pervis coming to court,vbe being but eight cosses
from .it ,' but the power of Normahal, the favourite queen,
diverted it, and he was ordered away directly to Bengala.
The Mogul was retired, but whither no man could certainly
tell. '

Several days passed in soliciting the king and great ones,
and paying court to them, without. anything remarkable; 'till
on the 9th of October I received letters from Surat with an
account that four English ships were arrived there.

The ships brought much merchandise, but difficulties were .
made in disposing of them, for want of the treaty having been
- formally signed and sealed. It was evident that Asaph Chan
and the other courtiers hindered the Mogul from carrying out
his original purpose of settling matters favourably. In fact,
Sir Thomas Roe had to 'leave, after long delay, without accom=
plishing what the embassy had been sent to do. But this is
not the main object of our narrative, which is chiefly to report
some of the strange records given of the proceedings at the
court of the Mogul. In the following year the ambassador
was more fortunate in witnessing the ceremonies at the cele-
bration of the royal-birthday, especially the public weighing,
which is thus described :--

The Ist of September being the king's birthday, with the
solemnity of weighing him, I was conducted into a fine garden,
where besides others there was a great square pond with trees
set about it, and in the midst of it a pavilion or tent, under
which were the scales the king was to be weighed in. The
scales were of beaten gold, set with small stones, rubies, and
turquoises; they hung by chains of gold, and for more surety
there were. silk ropes. The beams were covered with plates
of gold. The great lords of the nation sat about the throne on
rich carpets,_expecting the king's coming out. At length he
appeared'covered with diamonds, rubies, and pearls. He had
several strings of them about his neck, arms, wrists, and turban,
and two or three rings on every finger. His sword, buckler,

' and throne were also covered with precious stones. Among-
the rest I saw rubies as big as walnuts, and pearls of a prodi-
gious magnitude. He got into one of the scales, sitting on his
legs like a tailor. Into the other scales to weigh against him,
were put several parcels, which they changed six times. The
country people told me they were full of silver, and that the
king that day weighed 9,000 rupees. Then they put into the
same scale gold and precious stones; but being packed up I
saw them not. After that he was weighed against cloth of
gold, silks, calicoes, spices, and all other sorts of precious
commodities, if we may believe the natives, for all those things
were packed up. Lastly, he was weighed against honey,
butter, and corn ,' and I was informed all that was to be
distributed among the Banians ; but I think that distribution
was not made, and all those things were carefully carried back.
They told me all the money was kept for the poor, the king
using to cause some to be brought at night, and to distribute

-that money among them very charitably. Whilst the king
was in one of the scales, he looked upon me and smiled, but
said never a word, perhaps because he did not see my inter- '
preter, who could not 'get in with me. After. being weighed,
he ascended the throne. Before him there were basins full of
almonds, nuts, and all sorts of fruit artificially made in silver.
He threw about a great part of them, the greatest noblemen '
about him scrambled for them. I thought it not decent to do
so ; and the king observing it, took up one of those basins
which was almost full, and poured it out into my cloak. His
- courtiers had the impudence to thrust in their hands so greedily, .
that had I not prevented them, they had not left me one.
Before I came in, they had told me those fruits were of massive
gold ; but I found by experience they were only silver, and so
light, that a'thousand of them do not weigh the value of PS20.
Isaved the value of ten or twelve crowns, and those would
have filled a large dish. I keep them to show the 'vanity of
,those people. I do not believe the king that day threw away
much above the value of PS100. After this solemnity, the king
spent all the night a-drinking with his nobles : I was invited,
but desired to be excused, because there was no avoiding drink-
ing, and their liquors are so hot they will burn a man's inside.

The Journal kept by Sir Thomas Roe ends rather abruptly,
the concluding portion having been lost. The last entry is as
follows :-- h

" January the 30th the Dutch came to court with a present
of several rarities brought out of China. They were not per-
mitted to come near the third ascent. The prince asked me
who they were. I told him they were Dutch, and lived at
Surat. He asked whether they were our friends. I answered,
'they were a nation that depended on the King of England, and
were not well received in all parts ; that I knew not what
brought them thither. Since they are your friends, said he,
call them. I was forced to send for them to deliver their
presents. They were placed near our merchants, without
holding any discourse with them."

Sir Thomas Roe seems soon after this to have left the court
of the Mogul, not without sending reports to the East India Com-
pany. The first letter, dated at Adsmere or Ajmere, January
25th, 16I5, was as follows :--
" At my first audience, the Mogul prevented me in speech,
bidding me welcome as to the brbther of the king my master;
and after many compliments I delivered His Majesty's letter,
with a copy of it in Persian; then I- showed my commission,
and delivered your presents, that is, the coach, the virginals,
the knives, a scarf embroidered, and a rich sword of my oWn.
He sitting in his state could not well see the coach, but sent
many to view it, and caused the musician to play on the virgi-
nals, 'which gave him content. At night, having stayed the
coachman and musician, he came down into a court, got into
the coach, and into every corner of it, causing it to be drawn
about. Then he sent to me, though it was ten'o'clock at night,
for a servant to put on his scarf and sword after the English
fashion, which he was so proud of, that he walked up arid
down, drawing and flourishing it, and has never since been
without it. 'But after the English were come away, he
asked the Jesuit whether the King of England were a great
king, that sent presents of so small value,~ and that he looked
for some jewels; yet rarities please as well ,' and. if you were
yearly furnished from Frankfort, where there are .all sorts of
knacks and new devices, a hundred pounds would go further
than five hundred laid out in England, and be more acceptable ,
here. This country is spoiled by the many presents that have-
been given, and it will be chargeable to follow the example.
There is nothing more welcome here, nor did I eVer see men
so fond of drink, as' the king and prince are of red wine,
whereof the governor of Surat sent up some bottles, and the
king has ever since solicited for more: I think four or five
casks of that wine will be more welcome than the richest jewel
in Cheapside ; large pictures on cloth, the frames in pieces,
but they must be good, and for variety some story with many
faces. For the queen, fine needle--work toys, bone laces, cut-
work, and some handsome wrought waistcoats, sweet-bags,
and cabinets will befmost convenient. Iwould wish you to
'spare sending scarlet, it' is dear to you, and no better
esteemed here than stammel. I must add, that 'any fair
China bedsteads, or cabinets, or trunks of Japan, are here
rich presents. ' V

This place is either made, or of itself unfit for an ambassador ;
for though they understand the character, yet they have much
ado to understand the privileges due to it, and the rather
because they have been too humbly sought to before." .

The latest letter to the Company ends in similar strains of
disappointment.

"I will settle your trade here secure with the king, and
reduce it to order, if I may be heard; when I have so done, I
must plead against myself, that an ambassador lives not in fit
honour here. I could sooner die than be subject to the slavery
the Persian is content with. A meaner agent would, among-
these proud Moors, better effect your business. My quality
often for ceremonies, either begets 'you enemies, or suffers
unworthily. The king.has often demanded an ambassador
from Spain, but could never obtain one, for two reasons; first,
because they would not give presents unworthy their king's
greatness; next, they knew his reception should not.answer
his quality. I have moderated according to my discretion, but
with a swoln heart. Half my charge shall corrupt all this
court to be your slaves.

The best way to do your business in this court is to find
some Mogul that you may entertain for a thousand rupees a
year, as your solicitor at court. He must be authorised by the
king, and then he will serve you better than ten ambassadors.
Under him you must allow five hundred rupees for another at
your port to follow the governor, and customers, and to adver-
tise his chief at court. These two will effect all, for your
other smaller residencies are not subject to much inconveni
ency." .

Such is the account of the. first intercourse of the English
with the Great Mogul. The son of Jehan Guire moved his
court to Delhi, where a new and magnificent capital was built
_ near the site of the more ancient city.44

THE GREAT MOSQUE OF DELHI, AND THE TAJ lVlE-HAL'
AT AGRA. '

HIE-first European whose visit to new Delhi is recorded
was a Frenchman, M. Bernier, who was there in the
time of Aurungzebe, grandson of Jehan Guire. The history
of his voyage to the East Indies is full of curious matter, and
his account of the new capital, and also of the city of Agra,
has much interest, as being the earliest description of places
so familiar in subsequent annals of India. We quote on this
ground the Frenchman's description of the two celebrated
buildings so often described by later travellers--the great
Mosque of Delhi, and the Taj Mehal at Agra--the latter being
the tomb of Shah Jehan's favourite wife Normahal. .
Thegreat Mosque is seen afar ofi' in the midst of the town, I
standing upon a 'rock, flatted to build upon, and to make round
about a large place for four long and fair streets to end upon,
v and answering to the four sides of the Mosque-viz" one to the
. principal gate, or frontispiece, another' behind that, and the
two others to the two gates that are in the middle of the two
remaining sides. To come to the gates, there are twenty-five
or thirty steps of fair and large stones going round about,
except the back part, which is covered with other great quarry-
stones to cover the unevenness of the cut rock. I he three
entries are stately, there is nothing but marble, and their large
gates are covered with copper-plates exceedingly well. wrought,
Above the principal gate, which is much statelier than the two
others, there are many small turrets of white marble as well
. without as within; 'that in -the middle ismuch bigger and
higher than the two others. All the rest of the 'Mosque, I
~mean from these three domes unto the great gate, is without
covering, because of the heat of the country; and the whole
pavement is of large squares of marble. I grant willingly,
that this structure is not according to the rules and- orders ofTke Great Mosgue of Del/22'. - 45-

architecture, which we esteem is indispensably to be followed ;
yet I observe nothing in it that offends the eye;-but rather
find all to be well contrived, and'well proportioned : and I do
even believe, that if in Paris we had a church of this way of
architecture, it would not be disliked, if there were nothing else
in it but that it is of an extraordinary and surprising aspect,
and because that, excepting the three great domes and all the
turrets, which are of white marble, it appears all red, as if all
were nothing else but great tables of red marble, though it be
nothing else but a stone very easy to cut, and which even
flaketh off in time.

This Mosque it is to which the king repaireth every Friday
(which is the Sunday of the Mahometans) to pay his devotion.
Before he goes out of the fortress, the streets he is to pass are
constantly watered because of the heat and dust. Two or
three hundred musqueteers are to stand and make. a lane about
the gate of the fortress, and, as many more on the sides of a
. great street that ends at the Mosque. Their musquets are
small, but well wrought, and they have a kind of scarlet-case '
with a little streamer upon' them. Besides there must be five
or six' cavaliers well mounted ready at the gate, and ride at a
good distance before the king, for fear 'of raising dust; and
their office is to kecp' off the people. Things being thus pre-- .
pared, the king is scen to come out of the fortress seated upon
an elephant richly harnessed, under a canopy with pillars
painted and gilded; or else on a throne shining of gold and
azure, upon two beams, covered with scarlet or purfled gold,
carried by eight chosen and well accoutred men. The king
is followed by a body of Omrahs, some of which are on horse-
back, some in a palekey. Among , these Omrahs there are
many Mansebdars, and mace-bearers, such as I have before
spoken of. ' And though this be not that splendid and magnifi-
cent procession, or rather masquerade of the Grand Seignor
(I have no properer name for it), nor the warlike order of our
kings, it being altogether of another fashion, yet for'all that
there is something great and royal in it.46 ' .T/ze Taj Me/zal at Agra.

So much for the Mosque of Delhi ; now for the Taj Mehal.

You may represent to yourself, that at the going out of the
city of Agra eastward, you enter into a long and broad paved
street, which riseth gently, and hath on one side a high and
long wall, making. the side of a square garden that is much

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

THE TA] MEHAL AT AGRAL

bigger than our Place Royal, and on the other side a row of
>>new houses arched, such as those of the principal streets of
Delhi above spoken of. Having gone the length of half the
wall, you shall find on the right hand of the side of the houses '
a great gate well made, by which one enters into a caravan-
serah, and over against it, on the wall's side, a stately gate of
a great square pavilion, by which you enter into the garden
between two conservatories built up with free-stone. This
pavilion is lbnger than it is large, built of a stone-like red
marble, but not so hard. The frontispiece seems to me
' very magnificent, after their way, and as high as that of St.
Louis in the street of .St. Anthony. It is true you do" not there
see columns, architraves, and- cornishes, cut out after the propor-
tion of those five orders of architecture so religiously observed
in our palace: it is a different and particular kind of structure,
but such an one as wants no agreeableness even in the unusual-
ness of its contrivance, and which, in my opinion, would very
well deserve a place in our books of architecture. It is almost
nothing but arches upon arches, and galleries over galleries,
disposed and ordered a hundred different ways; and yet all
appears stately, well enough contrived and managed. There
is nothing that offends the eye; on the contrary, all is pleasing,
and a man cannot be weary in beholding it. The last time I
saw it, I was there with one of our French merchants, who
also could not behold it enough. I durst n'ot tell him my
thoughts of it, apprehending it might have spoiled my gust,
and framed it according to that of Indostan. But he being
lately come from France, Iwas very glad to hear him say,
" He had never seen anything so august and bold in Europe."-
After you are somewhat entered into the pavilion to pass
into the garden, you find yourself under a high vault made
like a cap, which hath galleries round about and below, on.
.the right and left side, two divans' or causeys, made up of
earth of eight or ten foot high. Opposite to the gate there is a
great arch quite open, by which youenter into an alley, which
.cuts almost the whole gardeninto two equal parts. .This alley
is by way of terrass so large, as that six coaches can pass on it
abreast, paved with great squares of hard stone, raised some
eight feet above the garden-plots, and divided in the middle by
a channel walled up with free-stone, having jets of water at
certain distances. After you have gone twenty-five or thirty
' paces upon this alley, turning your-eye to behold the entry,
you see the other face of the pavilion, which, though it be not
comparable to that which looks to the street, yet wants not its
stateliness, .being high and of a structure approaching the other.
And on both sides of the pavilion, along the wall of the garden,
you see a long and profound gallery by way 'of terms, supported
by many low columns near one another. And in this gallery
it is, that during the season of the rains, the poor are permitted
to enter, who come there thrice a week, receiving alms from a
foundation _made there by Shah-Jehan for ever.

Advancing further in this alley, you discover at a distance
before you a great dome, where is the sepulchre, and below on
the right and left hand you see 'divers alleys of a garden set
with- trees, and several parterres covered with flowers. At
the end of this alley, besides'the dome before you, you discover
on the right and left two great pavilions, built of the same I
stone, and consequently, 'looking all red as the first. These
are great and spacious square edifices, made by way of terrass
opening 'by three arches, and having at the bottom the wall of
the garden, so that you march under them as if they were high
and large galleries.

I shall not stay to describe unto you the ornaments within
these pavilions, because in respect to their walls, ground-plot,
and pavement, they are not so much unlike the dome, which I
am going to delineate to you, after I shall have observed, that
between the end'of the alley (which We have spoken of) and
the dome, there is a pretty large space'of a floor, which I call
a water-parterre, because that the diversely cut and figured
stones you march upon, are there instead of the box-wood of
our parterres. And it is from the_midst of this parterre, that
you may conveniently see a part of this edifice, where the
sepulchre is, which remains now to be considered.

It is a great and vast dome of white marble, which is near
the height of that of our Val de Grace in Paris, surrounded
with many turrets of the same matter, with stairs in them.
Four great arches support the whole fabric, three of which are
visible, the fourth is closed in by the wall of a hall, accom-The Taj Mafia! at Agra. 49'

panied with a gallery, where certain Mullahs (entertained for
that end) do continually read the Alcoran, with a profound
respect to the honour of Taje-Mehalle. . The mould of the
arches is enriched with- tables of white marble, wherein are
seen 'engraven large Arabian characters of black marble,
which is very agreeable to behold. The interior or concave
part'of this dome, and the whole wall from top to bottom is
covered with white marble ; and there is no place which is not
wrought with art, and hath not its peculiar beauty. You see
store of agat, and such sort of stones as are employed to enrich
the chapel of the great duke of Florence; much jasper, and
many other kinds of rare and precious stones, set a hundred
several ways, mixed and enchased in the marble that covers
the body of the wall. The squares of white and black marble,
that make the floor, are likewise set out with all imaginable
beauty and stateliness.

Under this dome is a little chamber inclosing the sepulchre,
which I have not seen within, it not being opened but once a
year, and that with great ceremony, not suffering any Christian
to enter, for fear (as they say) of profaning the sanctity of the
place : but really by what I could learn, because it hath
nothing rich or magnificent in it. '

There remains nothing else, than to take notice of an alley
in the fashion of a terrass (we follow the old spelling), twenty
or twenty-five paces large, and as many or more high, which is
betwixt the dom'e and the extremity of the garden, whence you
. see below you, at the foot of it, the river Jumna running along
a great campaign of gardens, a part of the town of Agra, the
fortress, and all those fair houses of the Omrahs that are built
along the water. There remains no'more,I say, than to cause
you to observe this terrass, which taketh up almost the whole
length of one side of the garden, and then to desire you to
judge, whetherl had reason to say, that the Mausoleum, or.
tomb of Taje-Mehalle, is -something worthy to be admired.
For my part I do not yet well know whether I am not some-
what infected still with Indianism ; but I must needs say, that

I believe it ought to be reckoned amongst the wonders of the
world, rather than those unshapen masses of the Egyptian
pyramids, which I was weary to see after I had seen them
twice, and in which I find nothing Without, but pieces of great

within nothing but very little art and invention.

 

THE LAST OF THE GREAT MOGULS. '

. AVING given an account of the first contact of the
English with the mighty ruler known as the Great
Mogul, it will be interesting as a contrast to mention the
fate of the last of the Moguls, who died a prisoner and an
exile in British Burmah in 1863. -
But it may be useful first to devote a brief paragraph
to the story of the dynasty of the Mogul' Emperors of Delhi.
Baber, the founder of the dynasty, was descended from
both Ghengiz Khan and Tamerlane, the mighty conquerors
and terrible scourges of earlier times. The conquest of .
Delhi by Tamerlane was in the year 1398. ' During five
days' he gave up the city to massacre, and every male above
fifteen years of age was slaughtered by his savage troops. It
was after this the city became a heap of ruins, till a, new
Delhi was built by the descendants of Baber, as we have
already stated. In the time of Baber' and of his son
Humdyun (1526--1556) the Mogulidynasty was nOt'firmly
established, the Afghan power having for a time successfully
contested the sovereignty. But the third of the Mogul rulers,
Akbar, subdued' every opponent, and became the ruler not
only of almost all Hindostan, but also of Cashmere and
Kandahar. Akbar's reign (1556--1605) nearly coincided
with that of our Queen Elizabeth. He was succeeded by
his son Jehan Guire, to. whose court Sir Thomas Roe cameTux YALACH AT um".
as Ambassador from James I. The next ruler was Shah
Jehan, third son of Akbar. He was the builder of New
Delhi. To him succeeded his brother Aurungzebe, under whom
the Mogul Empire seemed to increase in glory, but really
passed its zenith. ' Jehan-Guire, Shah Jehan, and Aurung-
zebe were, all threeof them, monsters of vice and cruelty,
and the dynasty became contemptible as well as infamous,
though still possessing mighty power. By frequent conflicts
with Hindu princes, to whom Akbar had wisely left some
form of independence, and still. more by attempting to reduce
the Mohammedan kingdoms of the Deccan, the rulers of Delhi
began 'to lose their supremacy. Shah Alum, the successor
of Aurungzebe, had to make concession to the Mahrattas,
who now first appeared as a formidable power in India. Their.
power grew till they became the real rulers of Delhi. From 1718
to 1803 this influence remained, the history of India mean-
while being enlivened by the invasion of Nadir Shah in I748,
and the irruption of an Afghan force under Ahmed Shah,
better known as Durani, who in 1757', in the battle of Paniput,
for a time checked the Mahratta power

The wars and revolutions of these generations reduced India
to a sad state of anarchy, and its conquest by some loreign
power seemed the only safety for the oppressed and im-
poverished people. The story of the gradual rise and pro-
gress of English rule under Clive, Warren Hastings, and
Wellesley, we cannot recount here, 'butpnly tell that in 1803
Lord Lake. took Delhi, and rescued Shah Alum II., the
fourteenth Mogul Emperor, from the Mahrattas, whose pOWCr for
further mischief was broken by the decisive battle of Assaye,
one of Wellington's early victories. _From this time the
Great Mogul at Delhi became a vassal or tributary of the
English, receiving a pension of PS I 50,000 yearly, the Emperor
still retaining a nominal sovereignty, under which there
was an attempt to restore the native rule, in the person of
Mohammed Shah, the seventeenth and last'in the imperial
dynasty founded by Baber. The overthrow of this attempt was
"the turning- point of the terrible crisis in English history known
as the Indian Mutiny. -

The capture of Delhi broke the neck of the rebellion, and
from that moment the restoration of British rule was
assured .

The gist of the story of the mutiny can be told in a few
sentences, although volumes would not exhaust all the nar-
rative of that epoch of danger and disaster, of heroism
and triumph After the great Sikh war ended, the Sepoy
army, which had for generations been led from victory to _

' victory, with extra batta and unlimited loot, in the peaceful.
years which followed led a comparatively idle life; They
were pampered and spoiled, and discipline was sadly relaxed. _
Becoming insolent and high-minded, they became the ready
thols of designing men. 'Some' of the native princes were
alarmed by the annexations in Lord Dalhousie's time.
Mohammedan ambition helped to fan the smouldering dis-
content. Under these circumstances the regulation was
issued, in 1856, that all Bengal Sepoys were to he enlisted
for general service. In 1857 the new Enfield rifles were
introduced into the Indian army, and immediately the re--
port was spread that the cartridges were greased with the

. {at of pigs. and of cows, that Mohammedans and Hindus might
alike be defiled. This was the spark that set the inflam-
mable materials ablaze. The horrors of the massacres
and other events that followed need not be recalled.
Most of the mutinous regiments made for Delhi, and there
proclaimed a native empire. When an English army, rein-
forced by the troops raised by John Lawrence in the Punjab,
commenced the siege of Delhi, there was not a man in

I India who did not say, " It must be taken in amonth, or our
empire is gone." It was not taken for several months, for
the place was full of troops, and the military stores were un:
bounded. With true British endurance the siege was kept
11p, and with true British valour the storming of the strong-

' hold was at length efl'ected. The rebels might have resisted
long, but they soon' took to flight. The victors were too
few and were too exhausted at once to- pursue the fugitives,
but some were slain or captured, and among the prisoners
was the aged king. His life was spared because the officer _to
whom he surrendered had pledged his word to that efi'ect.
Some of his sons, greater miscreants, if possible, than the ,
father, met with swift and merited doom. The old man
and two young princes were taken as prisoners to Rangoon,
after a trial in which the guilt of the king as the instigator
of many atrocities was clearly proved.

The capture of Delhi, and the pursuit and dispersion of
.the rebel forces there, did not prevent the subsequent ca_m-
paigns in Oude and Rohilcund, but even the recovery of
Lucknow was a less important event than that of the ancient
city of the Great Mogul.

We areindebted to the Leisure Hour for the only notice
that we have seen of the ex-king in his last days. In that
magazine, in the number for July 1862, appeared a photo--
graph of the king and two of his sons, and of the prison
at Rangoon where they were confined, sent by'the officer
whose duty it was to inspect the prisoners. In his com-
munication he says: " These prisoners are no other than
' the last of the Great Moguls' and his family. They reside.
in the small house adjoining the main guard, as shown in
the drawing. It is surrounded by a paling about fifteen
feet high. In the court-yard were Several attendants, and
upon going up the ladder and entering one of the small
rooms into which the house is divided, I saw the ex-king
sitting down on a bed, robed in true Oriental undress, smoking
a bubble-bubble. He looked vacantly at me, said nothing,
but put out his hands and bent his head slightly to,one
side, and assumed an aspect as if to express, 'See here
the pitiable condition I am come tol' He looked very old,
and as if he was fast sinking. His two sons, Gewun Buksh
and Shah Abbas, were in the verandah. I send a photo-

THE STORY OF CLEOPATRA'S NEEDLE.

MONG the remarkable objects to be seen in London few
have more romantic interest than the Egyptian obelisk.
on the Thames embankment, popularly known as Cleopatra's
Needle. It is wonderful for its size, being by far the largest
quarried stone in England; and it is more wonderful for~its
character and history, having been prepared by workmen two
centuries before the Israelites were delivered by Moses from
their bondage in Egypt. It was set up before the great temple
of the sun, at Heliopolis, by Thothmes III." The hiero-
glyphics, or, sacred inscriptions in the columns on its four
sides, were 'carved by order of that monarch, and the columns
of hier0glyphics on the sides of the central record were added
'by order of Rameses_II., the Pharaoh of "the oppression,"
so that on this obelisk on the Thames embankment may be
read records carved by the two mightiest of the kings of
ancient Egypt.

Before describing the historical record, it is worth saying a
few words about the obelisk, viewed .merely as . a gigantic
' . monument, and as a specimen of architecture and of masonry.
First, in regard to its size, It is sixty-eight feet five-and-
a-half inches long, and from the base--which-measures about
eight feet--it tapers upwards to the width of five feet, when it
ends in a pointed pyramid seven feet in height. This is the usual
form of an obelisk, the tapering .point being sometimes called
a pyramidion, or pyramid--like structure, the sides of which are
generally inclined at an angle of sixty degrees. The top was
originally covered with gold, as is mentioned in the inscription!
The substance 'of this obelisk is that form of granite known
as Syenite, being taken from the quarries of Syene in Upper
Egypt. Taking the density of Syenite, and the size of the
tapering monument, the estimate of the whole mass is about
one hundred and eighty-six tons. This is about ten times the
weight of the largest block of stone at Stonehenge, which was
the heaviest monolith, or single piece of wrought stone, in
England before the arrival of this Egyptian monument.

In the great Pyramids may be seen some enormous masses,
but the largest do not approach the size and weight of this
obelisk. There are also huge blocks of masonry in the ruined
walls of the Temple at Jerusalem, but these, also, are com-
paratively small and light. One has been measured twenty-
six feet long, six feet high, and seven feet wide, a block of
solid limestone, estimated to weigh about ninety tons. This
is still less than half the weight of Cleopatra's Needle.

Although larger by far than any other stone in England, this
obelisk is surpassed in size and weight by many stones in the
country from which it came: The column of red granite,
known as Pompey's Pillar, is in length about one hundred
feet, and its girth round the base twenty-eight feet, the weight
of the monolithic shaft being estimated at about three hundred
tons. Ev'en more gigantic than Pompey's Pillar is a block of '
carved granite found on the plain of Memphis, which, next to
Thebes, was the most important city in Upper Egypt in
ancient times. This block is a gigantic statue, lying face
downwards, and partly covered with sand and rubbish. The
head is about ten feet long, and the body in proportion, all

.carved from one mass of granite, the total weight of which is
estimated at about four hundred tons.

There is yet one more monument which was more colossal
than this prostrate statue, but it is not now of its full weight
or dimensions. The great obelisk in the Piazza of St. John
Lateran, at Rome, was originally one hundred and ten feet
long, and therefore the longest monolith ever known to have
been quarried. It was also the heaviest, weighing, as it does,
about four hundred and fifty tons, or more than twice the
Weight of the London obelisk

By what mechanical contrivances these gigantic blocks were
. quarried, ' and with what tools the hard syenite was worked,
we do not very clearly know. Enough has been discovered,
however, to get a general idea of the modes of procedure. In
the quarries at Syene may yet be seen an unfinished obelisk,
still connected with the parent rock, with traces of the work-
' men's tools so plainly seen on the surface, that one might
suppose the men to have been hastily called away, and that
they intended soon to return to their work. This unfinished
obelisk shows the mode in which the huge monoliths were
separated from the native rock. In a sharply cut groove,
marking the boundary of the stone, are holes, evidently de-
signed for wooden wedges After these had been firmly
driven into the holes, the groove was filled with water. The

wedges, gradually absorbing the water, swelled, and cracked
the granite from end to end.

The block once detached from the rock, was pushed for-
wards on rollers made of the stems of 'palm trees, from the
quarries to the edge of the Nile, where it was surrounded by
a large timber raft. It lay by the river side till the next
rising of the waters, when the raft floated with its precious
burden, and was conveyed down the stream to the city where
it was to appear as a monument. Here it was again pushed .
upon rollers, up an inclined plane, to the front of the temple
or other site. The pedestal had previously been placed, and
a firm causeway of sand, covered with plan-ks, formed an
incline up which the mass was rolled. By levers, and ropes,
made from the palm--fibre, the obelisk was hoisted into an
upright position. This is as much as is known about the
architectural and mechanical arrangements connected with the
ancient Egyptian monuments. In one ba5urelief at El-Bershel
is a representation of the transit of a monument, a colossal
figure upon a sledge, with'four rows of men dragging it by
ropes, urged by the whips of task-masters. .

The Syenite granite being extremely hard, is capable of
taking a high polish. The carvings are always in hollow relief,
as- the inscriptions, if projected in high relief, would have been
more liable to be chipped off. They are always arranged
with great taste in vertical columns, and they were carved I.
after the obelisk was placed in its permanent posiition. The
tools for this work must have been admirable, and we know i
that, from earliest times,- there has been great skill in the
manufacture and the tempering of metals.

Thothmes III. erected four great obelisks at Heliopolis, and
probably others in different parts of Egypt. Of the two pair
known as Pharaoh's Needles and Cleopatra's Needles, the
former were removed from Heliopolis to Alexandria by Con-
stantine the Great. Thence one was taken to Constantinople,
where it now stands at the Almeidan. Being only fifty feet
high, it is thought that the lower part was broken, and that
the part remaining is only the upper half of the original
obelisk. The other was taken to Rome, and is that which
stands in front of the Church of St. John Lateran.

The well-known obelisk in the Place de la Concorde, at
Paris, is one of two which Rameses II. erected befdre the
Temple of Luxor. It is seventy-six feet high, or seven-and-a-
half feet higher than the obelisk in London.

That which stands in front of St. Peter's at Rome, in the
.great Piazza, was erected by Me'nephtah, the son and successor
'of Rameses II. It is about ninety feet high, and in size is
reckoned the third obelisk in the world. The second in size
is still standing at Karnak, about one hundred feet high, a
companion obelisk having. fallen to the ground. The largest
of all, as already stated, is that of the St. John Lateran, at
Rome. '

It would take a long time to tell how the various obelisks
now in Europe'and in'other lands (for the Turks and 'the
Americans also have these monuments) came into the hands
of their present possessors. The story of Cleopatra's Needle,
so far as ownership is concerned, may be briefly told. After
the defeat of the French in Egypt, first by Nelson, who destroyed
their fleet in Aboukir Bay, and then by Sir Ralph Abercrombie
and his troops, it occurred to many of the officers, naval and
military, that this column might be taken to England, and set
up as a trophy of their Egyptian victories. After considerable .
expenditure, both of labour and money, the idea was abandoned,
the commanders not heartily taking to the scheme. They
contented themselves with getting part of the pedestal disin-
terred and erected, with a space chiselled out of the surface,
into Which a brass plate was inserted, on which was engraved
a short account of the British triumphs. - .

When George IV. came to the throne, Mehemet Ali, then
ruler of Egypt, formerly, made a gift of the obelisk to the king, .
as his ally and friend. King George had more unromantic
sentiments, and more congenial ways of spending money.. The
offer was renewed to King William IV., with the handsome
addition of offering to ship the monument free of charge. The
compliment was declined with thanks. In 1840 the govern-
ment announced its desire to bring the gift of Mehemet Ali to
England, but the opponents of the Ministry of the day urged
" that the obelisk was too much defaced to be worth removal,"
and the proposal was not carried out. In I851 the question
was again broached in the House, and the appearance of the
obelisk would have been a memorable incident in the Great
Exhibition in Hyde Park, but the estimated outlay of PS7,000
was deemed too ,large'an outlay of public money. In I853-
the Crystal Palace Company expressed their readiness to be at
the expense of bringing the obelisk to be an ornament of their
Egyptian Court, but the design fell through, on the ground of
its being against precedent to allow what was national property
to be used for the benefit of a private company. This seemed
rather a dog--in-the-manger policy, but we suppose it is neces-
sary that the custodians of public property must avoid making
bad precedents. In 1867 the new Khe'dive sold the ground
on which the obelisk lay to a Greek merchant, who insisted on
its removal from his property. The Khedive appealed to the
English authorities to take possession of it, otherwise. the title
to the monument must lapse. The appeal had no effect, and
it was evident that if the monument ever came to England it
would not be at the cost of the Government or the nation. If
no private munificence-interposed, the obelisk would be broken
up for building material, as the owner of the ground now
threatened. ,

Meanwhile, there was one public-spirited Englishman, an
old soldier who admired Abercromby and his army of Egypt,-
and who never had forgotten the original purpose of the
removal. General Alexander had often pleaded with the
Government, and the learned societies, and with the public
through the press, and now he went to.Egypt to visit the spot.
He found the prostrate obelisk almost buried in the sand, but
through the assistance of Mr. Wyman Dixon, C.E., he had it
uncovered and examined.

On returning to England, General Alexander stated the
case to his friend, Professor, now Sir Erasmus Wilson, the
eminent surgeon. The question of transport was discussed by
them, along with Mr. John Dixon, CE. The result was that
Professor Wilson signed a bond to pay PS 10,000 to Mr. Dixon
on- the obelisk being erected in-London. The Board of Works
offered the site on the Thames Embankment, and Mr. Dixon
set about his part of the contract.

Early in July 1877 he arrived at Alexandria, and on
examination found the monument in better condition than had
been usually stated in the discussions on its removal. - He
adopted the plan of encasing the obelisk in an iron water-tight
cylinder about 100 feet long, which, with its precious burden,
was set afloat by digging to it a short canal. The Olga steam-
tug was engaged for towing the cylinder, and the voyage from
the harbour of Alexandria was begun. For twenty days the ,
passage was propitious, but a storm arose in the Bay of Biscay,
and as the cylinder threatened to sink, and to involve the- Olga
in the catastrophe, there was nothing for it but to sever the
connection. The captain returned to England under the
impression that the cylinder with its heavy freight had gone to
the bottom, and great was the vexation and disappointment.
It turned out, however, that the cylinder had floated safely, and
after drifting on the surface for about sixty hours was sighted
by the steamer, and towed to Vigo on the Spanish coast. After
a.few weeks' delay, and glad payment of salvage, the obelisk
arrived in the Thames, to be set up in its present position.
Many will remember the excitement of those few days, and
the whole nation rejoiced in the successful termination of an
affair in which few had previously shown any interest.

The hieroglyphic inscriptions on the obelisk we consider 0!
less importance than might have been anticipated,--always
excepting the one fact which they reveal as to Thothmes III.
being the builder. His cartouche, with the name, occurs four
times, once on each side, at. the top of the central column of
hieoglyphics. We know that this Thothmes reigned more than
3,000 years. ago. He and his armies overrap Palestine two
centuries before Moses was born. His wasa long reign, about
fifty-four years, and he was the greatest perhaps of all Egyp-
tian kings, although Sesostn's, or Rameses II. has even more
fame as a foreign conqueror. Possibly Jacob and Joseph,
certainly Moses and Aaron, and the Greek philosophers, Pytha-
goras and Plato, and the ancient travellers and historians, have
gazed on this very monument. But the inscriptions them-
selves do not greatly increase our feeling of reverence or admi-
ration. Thothmes boasts of his ancestry, as being the son of
Horus, and the descendant of the Sun.~ The obelisk is dedi-
cated_to the rising sun. There were difierent divine names
for the sun at rising, at midday, and at going down. ' The in-
scription bears many pictures of objects, the symbolic meanings
of which are known to students of hieroglyphics, chiefly
representing attributes or abstract ideas,--such as the arm for
power, the beetle for life, the lion's head for victory, and so
on. The literal translation of the inscription on one of the' "A Persian Grand V z'zz'er. 6I'

sides is as follows :----" Horus, powerful Bull, beloved of Ra (the
Sun), King of Upper and Lower Egypt. His father set up for
him a great name, with increase of royalty, in the precincts of
Heliopolis, giving him the,throne of Seb (Saturn of the Latins),
the dignity of Kheper (the sacred beetle, emblem of majesty),
son of the Sun, Thothmes, the 'Holy, the Just, beloved of the
benner (sacred bird), of An (or On) ever-living."

Since the obelisk came to London the wonderful ,discovery
has been made of the actual bodies of Thothmes III., of
Rameses IL, and other mighty monarchs of Old Egypt, ina
rocky sepulchre at Deiv-el-Bahari. The royal 'mummies are
now ranged in order at the Boolak Museum, near Cairo.

 

A PERSIAN GRAND VIZIER.

N Oriental histories, ancient and modern, the career of the
great minister of state known as the Grand Vizier is
seldom without strange romance. The story of Mirza Tekee,
Persian Plenipotentiary at the Conference of Erzeroum, is an
example of the wonderful vicissitudes seen in the life of these
high dignitaries. The purpose of this conference was to
'arrange the disputed boundaries between the Turkish and
Persian dominions. The survey of the countries, and the
proceedings of the conference lasted for some years, but we
are not here concerned with the geographical and political
matters under discussion. The Grand Vizier of Persia, Mirza
Tekee, was one of the ablest and most interesting of the per-
sonages who assembled at Erzeroum, and an account of his
early career and of his tragic end has been given by the Hon.
Robert Curzon, in his book of travels in Armenia.
Mr. Curzon, then the private secretary to Sir Stratford

' The detailed account of the inscriptions, with much valuable matter.
will be found in a little book published by the Religious Tract Society,
" Cleopatra's Needle," with exposition of the hieroglyphics and illustrations,
by the Rev. James King, M.A.
Canning, afterward Lord Stratford de Redcliffe, was appointed
joint Commissioner for England, along with Colonel Williams,
the distinguished hero of Kars, during the Russian war. There
were also Russian and Turkish Commissioners. Their joint
labours settled the frontier and arranged affairs, but the settle-

_ ment was of short duration, and the regions have since been
exposed to various troubles and wars. However, our present
subject is Mr. Curzon's account of his Persian colleague, the
Persian Grand Vizier.

Mirza. Tekee was the son of the cook of Bahmas Meerza,
brother of Mohammed Shah, and governor of the province of
Tabriz. ' The cook's little boy was brought up with the
children ofhis master and educated with them. Being a
clever boy, as soon as he was old enough he was put into the
office of accounts, under the commander--in-chief, the famous
Emir Nizam, who was employed in organizing and drilling the
Persian army in the European style.

Tekee became Vizier ul Nizam, or the governor's adjutant-
general as we would say, and having the confidence of the old
Emir, he did as he pleased, and amassed great wealth. It
was partly because of his being rich that the Shah of Persia
chose him to be his representative at the Erzeroum congress,
for he had no intention of paying him any salary, but sent
him with flattering speeches and promises, none of which he
intended to fulfil. The cunning old prime minister at Teheran,
Hadji Meerza Agassi, who was sedulously employed in feather-
ing his own nest, was jealous of Mirza Tekee, and very glad
to get him safe out of the way.

The Turks and Persians, as everybody knows, hate each
' other religiously, which seems always the worst sort oi hatred.
The Soonis and the Shiahs, the two great divisions of the
Mohammedan world and creed, are, as it were, the Papists
and Protestants of that religion. . If these two countries,
Turkey and Persia, are at peace for a time, the smouldering
flame is sure to break out again at the first convenient
opportunity, and it will do so till the end of time. I
The Turks, who disliked Mirza Tekee with more than
common aversion, from his dignified bearing and stately
manners, gave out various accusations against him and against
members of his household. A fanatical mob of many thousand
indignant Soonis surrounded all that quarter of the town of
Erzeroum where Tekee, the illustrious Shiah, then was, at-'
tacked the Plenipotentiary's house, and kept it in a state of
siege for some hours; Volleys'of rifle-shots were fired at the
windows, while from within Mirza Tekee only permitted his
servants to fire blank cartridges. Izmet Pacha, .the Governor
of Erzeroum, a drunken old Turk, sat on horseback as well as
he could, but would not interfere in the disturbance, though
he had all his troops, amounting to several thousands, under
arms. For his misconduct on this occasion he was turned
out of his governorship. Colonel Williams, at great personal
hazard, did all he could to quell the tumult and to protect
Tekee. The Turks swo're they must have blood, and. de-
manded that one of the Persians, at least, must _be delivered
up 'to them as a victim, upon which they promised to with
draw Colonel Williams could be no party to such a compro-
mise, but the servants of Tekee laid hold of a poor man in the
house and thrust him out to the mob. It was .a man who had
called that morning to say he was going to Tabriz, and would
be happy to take charge of any message or letter. The
servants knew nothing of him, and they saved their own lives
by the sacrifice of this poor-fellow, who was killed by the mob.
Another Persian, a merchant, was killed the same day in
' another part of the town, where he had no knowledge of the
disturbance at Teke'e's house. The mob continued to assault
the place, and breaking down the doors effected an entrance, '
pillaging and destroying all that they could get hold of. Mirza
Tekee was saved only by barricading himself in a room at the
back 'of the house, where he and his servants defended them-
selves for many hours, till the mob dispersed with their booty.
The Sultan afterwards sent Mirza PS8000 in repayment of
the loss sustained by this outrage.
When the treaty was signed between Turkey and Persia
'Mirza Tekee returned to Tabriz. On the death of the Emir
Nizam he succeeded to the office of commander-in-chief. .

During the last illness of Mohammed $hah, his brother,
Bahman Meerza, had been intriguing in hopes of succeeding to
the throne. But his intrigues being discovered and baffled,
he escaped to Tiflis, under Russian rule, where he knew he
would be welcomed. It is the policy of Russia, in the East, to
receive and pension rival claimants and rebels, in expectation
of their being possibly turned to useful account in the future.

Mirza Tekee now found his occasion. He marched to
Teheran at the head of his army, and seated the young Prince
Noor Eddin, upon the throne. Noor Eddin was grateful; he
gave to Tekee his sister in marriage. 'He also got possession
of the vast territorial estate of Hadji Meerza Agassi, the prime
minister of. Mohammed Shah. The Hadji had been Moham-
med's tutor, and rose to be one of the most famous of the
Viziers of that monarch, whose chief amusement, in his latter
years, was to shoot sparrows with a pistol ! When the Hadji
became rich his master squeezed him, as our Henry VIII. did
Cardinal Wolsey, but as he still retained a considerable
treasure in' gold, silver, and jewels, he thought it prudent to
retire to Kerbela, where he died in the odour of sanctity in
\851. Thus the way was clear for Tekee to be Grand Vizier. .
I He was now seated on the pinnacle of prosperity. The
extent of the possessions which the Shah handed over to him
from the plunder of his predecessor, the Hadji, was so great
as to be almost incredible, and was such as would have
yielded the revenue to a king.

Mirza Tekee had, nevertheless, or rather the more on
' account of his prosperity, enemies at court. His chief enemy
was the Shah's mother, a lady who in Turkey and Persia, and
in other Oriental lands, usually enjoys an extraordinary degree
of power, wealth, and dignity. If she likes to do good she
can do much good, if she likes to do evil she can do much
evil, whether to the state or to individuals.

3}
Between those who were partizans and the friends of
Bahman Meerza, the late Shah's brother, and those who hated
the strong government of Mirza Tekee,'a powerful party of
malcontents was growing, who got hold of the weak mind of
the young Noor Eddin. Although he owed everything to the
Vizier at his coming to the throne, he now allowed him to be
destroyed by his enemies. Permission was given to him to
go to Koom, where he had an estate. This was the form in
which his banishment from court was anhounced. .'

So secretly had the conspiracy worked that Tekee's sus-

picions do not seem to have been aroused. His young wife
followed him, with all her train, looking forward to the
pleasure of living with her husband for a while in the quiet
retirement of a beautiful place in the country. But when she
arrived within sight of the town of Koom, a messenger came-
out to meet her; and the news that he brought was that Mirza
T ekee had been killed by the order of her brother, the Shah.
The assassins sent for this cruel deed found the minister in
his bath on their arrival, and there they opened his veins and
held him till he bled to death. No charge was made against
him, and no crime ever proved. It was an instance of foul
murder by the Shah, who thus destroyed one of his ablest and
most honest subjects, at the instigation of some of the most
infamous and worst. ,
' This tragic event happened in 185x, about the time when
. the representatives of all nations were assembled in London,
at the opening of the Great Exhibition, the festival of the world's
peace and industry. In our happy land we know little of what
is passing in the dark places of the earth, which are full of the
habitations of cruelty. Such was the career and such the fate
of a Grand Vizier. V.66

CAPTAIN. WILLIAM PEEL'S RIDE THROUGH NUBIA.

ET the reader join me in paying a tribute of respect to the
memory of the sailor son of the great statesman--Sir
Robert Peel~--William Peel, as noblc an Englishman as ever
served in the British navy, whose career of honour and useful-
ness was too early closed. There are many who still remember
the sad sorrow when the news came that the commander of
the naval brigade in the time of the Indian Mutiny had fallen
a victim to small-pox. Of his gallant services at that crisis,
as well as in the Crimean war and on other occasions, this'is
not the place to give a record. Suffice it to say that in his
profession he always well sustained the reputation of the name
that he bore, and of the illustrious house to which he
belonged" . . '

It is not so generally known that he published a book
descriptive ofa journey made by him in one of the intervals of
public service, " A Ride through the Nubian Desert." It was
as long ago as 1851 that he went there, but recent events in
that region of the world give a fresh interest to the record of
that journey. He'saw and described many of the places of
which the names are now more familiar to us, and some of the
matters referred. to have an enduring importance.

The character of the man, and the. Spirit in which he went
forth on this journey, appear in his opening chapter. Speaking
of his companions in the .voyage to Egypt he says, " Some
have gone to India, some to Afghanistan, others to China and
to Borneo,--all to uphold the character of England, to admini-
ster justice, to extend commerce, or to defend and expand our
empire. I embarked with the object of travelling in the
ISoudan, hoping, by the blessing of the Almighty, to help to
break the fetters of the negro, to release him from the selfish
Mussulman, from the sordid European; to tell him there is a
God that made us all, a Christ that came down and died forRide t/zroug/z Nubia. - 1 67

all." And again, on the last parting at Cairo, he says, " They
left ine at Cairo, thinking I was bound for pleasure, all except
one, to whose kind and honoured friendshipI had confided my
views. I watched them all depart; to me it was another trial.
I felt tired of Egypt, and turned with horror from the natives,
for whom I had no sympathy} in despair from the rapid
flowing Nile, whose current must be stemmed for many hun-
dred miles. I was in most wretched health, and the question
rose why I should go. Europe seemed so inviting, her civili--
'zation so intelligent, her Christianity so genial. But four days
sufficed to restore my health, and in the quiet rides to Shoubra, .
unsurpassed by those of any city, along the banks of the
mysterious Nile, all my high hopes returned."

He had sailed from England for Alexandria on the 20th
August, 1850, in the good steamer Pollinger; and after stop--
ping six hours at Gibraltar and forty at Malta, reached the
Egpytian port on the 4th September. That day they all
. embarked in the canal boat on the Mahmondieh canal, and
towed to Afteh on the Nile. There they changed to a steamer,
and arrived at Cairo the following evening. Such was the
mode of transit at that time.

Cairo having been explored, and a Firman and Couwass or
Commissionaire being procured, with the help of Mr. Murray,
. the Consul-General, he sailed, at sunset. of September the nth,
from Boolak, the port of Cairo, in a dahabieh, or Nile boat,
for Korosko. He had previously had an interview with the
Viceroy, Abbas Pacha, a true friend of England and the English,
to whom he was-already personally known, and who showed
much interest in his projected journey.

In eleven days from Cairo they arrived at. Assouan, the
ancient Syene, the frontier post between Egypt and Nubia,
where the river commences its unbroken flow through the
valley of the Nile. While viewing with admiration the natural
and historical scenes, the sympathy of our traveller is- called
forth by the condition of the labouring people. I" The villages
of the fellahs are a collection of huts made of unburnt bricks' p8 Capmz'n William Peel's

or 'date leaves stuccoed with mud,'about eight' feet high, pul-
verised by the sun, a heap of dirt and 'dust standing on the
accumulated rubbish of centuries. A grove of date trees
surrounds them, which readily marks their site, and their-
appearance at a distance is often improved by a number of
pigeon houses built like turrets. And this is .the abode ofa
human being, the fellah of Egypt, who goes' to his work day
after day, from early dawn till dark, working naked ih~the sun,
often without even a covering to his head or loins, standing'all
day in the water, raising it by a bucket, digging a trench with
his hands, or cutting the mud with his feet ,- and his labour is
not for himself, but for a grinding master. ' With all this he
preserves the beauty of the human form, his countenance is
serene, and he answers the passing traveller with a pious and I
graceful Salutation. To say that he is happy because he knows
no better, is it not making his. condition worse ? The Women
are frightfully ugly, and their dress most diSmal--a large sheet
or wrapper of dull blue drawn over the head and body, and
held across the face.- See them squatting on the banks when
they go to fill their water-jars, uttering a mourning cry, they
look like evil spirits waiting to be carried across the- river of
death." -

Such are the poor fellaheen of Egypt, but such is the lot of
poverty and labour all the world over, only here there is little
to raise the spirit above its depressing surroundings. Happily
there are efforts now being made to improve their condition,
and Christian missions are bringing to many of these sons and
daughters of toil new comforts and hopes, which the religion
of the false prophet failed to efl'ect for them.

But we inust pass on 'to Nubia or the Soudan. Captain
Peel's' only companion was Churi, a Maronite of the Lebanon,
from whom he (had taken lessons in Arabic and 'Italian in
London, and. whom he persuaded to accompany him on 'his

_ journey. Churi had been at an early age sent from his own
country to be educated at the college of the Propaganda at -
Rome ; a good linguist, and a man of probity and intelligence.Ride. through Nuez'a. 69

With him Captain Peel travelled, not in Egypt only, but in the
Sinaitic Desert and in the Holy Land, and his companionship
is spoken of with commendation and gratitude. -

Koroslm was reached on September 27th, at noon of the
sixteenth day after leaving Cairo, and on' the following day the
journey through the desert began, in the direction of Berber.
The party. consisted of the Captain and Churi, the couwass,
and an Egyptian cook, an Arab guide, and four Arab attendants
or camel drivers. There were thirteen dromedaries to carry
the travellers, with their baggage and water.

It was a weary, dreary journey through this parched and
barren wilderness. Here are some of the entries in the
Journal :--" We marched in silence, our camels advancing in
line abreast over the broad pavement of closely-packed sand.
There was not a blade of grass, not even a withered straw, the
remnant of some partial winter vegetation, and the heat was
intense, a hot south wind blowing from the rocks with the
breath of a furnace, and the sand glaring with light. We '
halted at seven o'clock that night, but only to feed the camels;
there was no time to make a fire, we, therefore, drank water
and ate onions for our dinner. The march was then resumed.
I never was more fatigued ; my tongue was parched, and the
throat painfully swollen from the hOt- wind. We came to a
halt at twenty minutes past one o'clock, when I stretched my
poor body on the sand to sleep, and my mind wandered by the
side of rippling streams in the earthly paradise of England. At
5.15 a.m., having drunk only water for our breakfast, we were
again on the march, and went on till 8.20 under the sickening
heat of a morning sun without food. Our halting place was
on the side of a hill, under a deep ledge, which afforded
shade till noon. The Arabs told us we were to sleep, and
showed us the. example, but the mind was too active, and I
felt the necessity of supporting the body with food.

" I eagerly asked what we had brought, and then first learned .
that we had come to cross this desert without a stick of fire-
wood, with no meat, no eggs, no vegetables, fm: even the70 Captam Wzl/zam Peel's

onions were gone! I turned with the fiercencss of an African
tornado. What was the use of a couwass? What was the use
of a cook? What was the use even of my faithful Churi?
The cook and the couwass retired, but-Churi's tcmper is im-
perturbable, and he loves me too well to care for my hasty
words. - He said he had tried his best; he said he thoughtI
knew there were none of these things. The fierce passion
soon fell at his soft answer, and I asked kindly to know what
there really was besides our tea and coffee. There was only
a bag of rice and some stale bread, which We had bought at
Time, and had baked in the sun. We then made a fire with
camels' dung, and boiled the coffee and rice. This was our
only food in crossing the desert, and it came twice a day; it
was boiled rice and coffee in the morning, boiled tea and rice
in the evening. Churi's diet was still more simple, for he
confined himself almost entirely to soaked bread and water.
The thermometer here at noon, under .the shade of the
deep rock, and held apart from the side, was 108deg of
Fahrenheit." '

So they went on day by day, and at sunset on the Ist
October arrived at the wells of Mourad, three reservoirs of
brackish water in the middle of this desert. These wells are
in a 'little amphitheatre, formed by the high surrounding hills.
Some trees grew in the water-courses formed in the rainy
season from these heights. Next day the journey was resumed
across plains of sand, interrupted occasionally by rocky ridges,
arriving at length at Aboo Hamed, on the edge of the desert,
but on the banks of the Nile.

The river at Aboo Hamed is of great breadth, and in the
centre is a chain of islands highly cultivated. There are'no
boats, and the people swim across the stream on inflated skins,
gathering their clothes in a high turban round the head; or
they form rafts of grass and the green straw of the doora,
which they bring for the fodder of the camels, and on them
they place their other produce.

A short distance below the Nile. turns sharp to the west-Rza'e t/zfougk N ueza. 71

ward, running over beds of rock, causing rapids which prevent
navigation. It is to avoid this great detour that this line of
communication lies straight through the Nubian desert.

F rom' Aboo Hamed to Berber the course runs in a straight
line, at times close to the river; and when there is a bend,
the path stretches across some high plain, but all sense of
weariness is removed by the sight of the delicious Nile, which
runs through the midst, tracing a line of the deepest green.
The islands, as well as the lands on either bank, are richly
cultivated and highly productive, at least after reaching
Kenaniet, where the camels had green food for the first time
since leaving Korosko. '

- Above Kenaniet the country is no longer threatened by the
. sands of the desert, and the inundation fertilizing a wide 'plain.
It is like a second Egypt.

Berber, or Barbar, was' reached on October 11th, after
travelling with the same long journeys, but not at the same
rapid pace as through the desert. This is the capital and also
the limit of Nubia. The people are still called Barbaras,
whence, probably, the Greek word " barbarians." All above is
the country of the Soudan. The native name of Berber is
also El Moukharef. The governor of Berber at that time was
an Albanian, who received the travellers hospitably. The
Arabs were dismissed, and as they had served willingly and
faithfully, a good backshish was added, that they might have
an entertainment before the return journey. Enough was
given to buy a sheep and other materials for a feast. The day
wore on, and the poor'camel drivers continued near the tent.
"'We asked them if they had roasted the sheep. They ex-
pressed astonishment, and said there was nothing for them to
eat. The guide was sent for, and though clearly convicted
before them all 'of having kept the money, it was impossible to
raise a blush on his hardened face. He seemed only surprised
at our taking up his roguery so warmly! The piastres were
then given to the others, amidst great elamour and abuse of
the guide; but five minutes after, knowing each would have
done the same, they and the conductor were in perfect
harmony;" i . '

On the 12th October, with a favourable northern wind, they
set sail in a boat for Khartoum, passing Shendy'on the
morning of the 16th, and reaching Khartoum soon after sun-
rise on the 23rd October, exactly six weeks after leaving
Cairo. Their home wasmade at the Roman Catholic Mission,
the vicar--general, the chief of which, was absent, but two
brethren of the mission showed every hospitality and attention.
The reception was also cordial on the part of Latif Pacha,
governor-general of the upper provinces, of which this is the
capital. " Khartoum, on the conquest of the country, only a
few years back, did not even exist. It is now a very rising
city, with an excellent bazaar, several gardens and date-tree
plantations, and a large fleet of dahabichs. From its position,
it would soon, under good government, become a place of
first-rate importance." This was said in 1851, and Captain
Peel adds, " I am one of those who believe that an English
government and a handful of Englishmen could make Egypt
and the Nile the means of civilizing Africa and conferring
blessings on the world. Under English rule cities would rise

_up at Assouam and at Khartoum, whose influence would be
felt over the whole interior. I know, alasl the spirit of the
age is against such thoughts; and there are even men who
would wish'to abandon our empire; but I speak the voice of
thousands of Englishmen who, like myself, have served their
country abroad, and who do not love her least, who will never
consent to relinquish an empire that has been won by the
sword, and who think the best way to preserve it is by
judicious extension." ' ' .

Latif Pacha tried hard to dissuade the travellers from pro'
ceeding beyond Berber, saying much about the perils and risk"
of the journey to Labeyed or Obeid, the capital of Kordofan.
But when he found them resolved to go there, he gave every
advice and assistance. The Cairo couwass being invalided,
the governor sent his own couwass, and gave a letter to Abd-Rz'a'e wrong/1' Nubia. 73

el-Kader, the ruler of the province of Kordofan. The, Sheik
' Ali Abd El Wacked, head. of Ababdeh Arabs, the most power-
ful of the tribes in all Egypt, had the courtesy to come to' see
them set out on their journey, and gave letters to some 01 his
people in the country. - I g
In ten days they arrived at Obeid, meeting on the way
. several gangs of slaves on their route to Khartoum. The
Arab escort .was well armed, every one in the country carrying
spears, and some having also firearms.

A house was given to the travellers, near that of the
governor, and here they remained some days. They then '
announced their wish to go on to Darfoor, but the governor
objected to this, without having obtained the leave of the
Sultan. But he gave way, after some dissuasion, and agreed
that they should proceed to the frontier, and there wait the
permission of the ruler of Darfoor. But a severe attack of
fever and ague put an end to this plan. Captain Peel and
Churi were both prostrated, and it was not till the end of
November that they were able to move out of the house.

The reports in his journal about Obeid are chiefly valuable
as showing the extent of the slave trade. The only other
trade of importance is "in gum-arabic, which is collected at
certain seasons. of the year. But at all times slaves are bought
and sold. Here is one extract from the captain's note-book:
" Monday morning, November Ioth, 1851. Scene opposite my
windows, which look into Government court-yard. Five male
slaves just arrived, their necks in a wooden triangle at the
end of a long heavy pole, which was attached to a camel during
the march; also one female slave bound by-the feet. I
believe the number of slaves brought every year to Khartoum
and Obeid, and thence sent to Egypt, is very great. Some
are also sent from Darfoor to Siout. These slaves Were
caught by the Arabs in some mountains to the southward.
In the afternoon they Were stripped, examined, made to walk
--in fact, critically examined like beasts--in the government
court-yard. And how did they behave? Like beasts? I-74 Captain Peel's Ride t/zmug/z Nubia.

watched them closely, unseen, and cannot conceive how men
could have behaved with such propriety, or shown more'
touching dignity. There was no fear, nor was there any
momentary pride to show muscular strength; they held
themselves mechanically, letting others bind their limbs, and
marched no further than the very line. When inspection was
finished, they wrapped their scant clothing with decency
round their waists, and took no notice of the flowing robes
or gorgeous turbans of their masters. As men, physically,
_ they were their superiors, in heart and feeling it is mockery to
make comparison, in courage unquestionably not inferior; but
they have no self-reliance or moral strength, and in the onward
march of the world, from the position of their country and its
climate, have been left behind."

V Kordofan was a rich and populous negro land when con-
quered by the Egyptians, now sixty years ago. The excesses
of the troops, and the exactions of the rulers have ruined it.
The people have been-regarded both by Egyptians and by
Arab traders as only fair game for being hunted and kidnapped
for slavery. The government retained its power at that period
only by terror. ' The sale of firearms or of gunpowder was
forbidden, and the people were kept down by the Egyptian
garrison. 50 things remained till near our own time. On
the return journey Captain Peel found that "all the boats of
Khartoum had gone on the annual slave-hunting expedition up
the White Nile l "

.We'con'clu'de with quoting Captain Peel's general estimate
of the Arab tribes in Africa. " All that I have seen," he says,
" of the Arabs has made me form a very bad opinion of them.

tially avaricious. Hospitality is their redeeming feature; it is

remotest regions of Africa without fear, and without any
money, whilst their pagan countrymen are being hunted and
sold into slavery around them. I-Iadji, or pilgrim, is a title
that gives them sure protection.'

The road these people take 15 to Suakim, a port on the Red
Sea, about ten days' journey from the Nile, where they embark
and go almost direct across to Mecca. It is a stream of human
beings constantly flowing and continually increasing, for while
the Mohammedan religion seems fading in the East, it is mak-
ing astonishing progress through the negro nations. We little
know with what fiery zeal the missionaries of this religion are
propagating their faith; already it extends in an unbroken
line from the Red Sea to the Atlantic ,- and wherever it comes,
it falls as a blight upon the country, turning the warm heart
of the negro into selfishness and suspicion, and forming the
most dangerous barrier to the enterprise of the traveller. In
returning, between Khartoum and Berber, Captain Peel saw,
in a hollow where some water still remained from the rains,
above two thousand camels, all_together, organized into tr0ups,
and attended only by a few Arabs. Other scenes and incidents '
were met with, but we have quoted enough to interest the

reader in this ride through the Nubian desert and journey to
the Soudan.

 

SARAWAK AND THE SOUDAN.~

THE STORY OF RAJAH BROOKE.

HE position of Egypt and of the Soudan may be very
difierent when this book is read from what it was

when written. But, apart from passing events, there is a
permanent interest, of no common kind, in the following letter
written by Rajah Brooke in reference to the work of General
Gordon in the Soudan. It gives an authentic summary of the
great work done in Borneo by the uncle of the writer, the
first Rajah Brooke. It shows what can be done by a wise and76 Sarawak ana' t/zq Soudan. .

' brave Englishman in foreign lands, even when alone and un-
supported by the power and resources of his own country.
We may criticize details in the lives of such men, but must
admire the result of their enterprise and spirit in bringing
civilization to regions long given over to barbarism.

In 1838, when my uncle, Sir James Brooke, first anchored
his yacht of? the coast of Borneo, he found a condition of
things existing on the coast not unlike that which has neces-
sitated the abandonment of the Soudan. The country was
under the government of the Sultan of Brunei, a potentate
whose authority over Sarawak was characterized by the same
abuses which have driven the Soudanese to revolt. His
government was a system of Bashi--Bazoukery plus slave-
raiding, with this difference, that in Sarawak, unlike the
Soudan, the slave-raids Were undertaken by the orders and
under the direction of the Sultans or Rajahs of Brunei. Their
agents scoured the country in all directions, kidnapping
children, and young girls to supply their harems. The tribes,
provoked at last beyond endurance, rose in revolt, and at the
time when my uncle arrived at Sarawak the insurgents Were
confronting the forces of the Sultan very much as those of the
Mahdi are now confronting the troops of the Khedive. Sir
James Brooke interposed between the combatants. He won'
the confidence of the leaders of the revolt, and undertook to
act as mediator between them and their Sovereign. The
Sultan of Brunei conceived a great liking for my uncle, and
without much difficulty it was arranged that the Sultan should
abandon his claims over the revolted region. Sarawak became
independent, the Bashi-Bazoukery from Brunei ceased to
trouble the tribes, and the homes of the villagers were no
longer laid desolate in .order to supply victims for the'Sultan's
pleasure. The bag-and-baggage policy was unsparingly applied,
and Sarawak, stripped of all the agents of the executive
authority of the Sultan of Brunei, was left as independent as
the Soudan will be when General Gordon has completed the
amputation of " the dog's tail."I Sarawak and (he So'zm'cm. 77

But, instead of leaving Sarawak in a state of native anarchy,
that province was saved for civilization by the transfer of all
the prerogatives of the Brunei Sultans to my uncle. A free
'grant of sixty miles of coast-line was madeto Sir James Brooke
to govern as seemed to him good. The task of establishing a
civilized government in that wild and' savage region was no
child's play. It was in miniature identical with that which
would lie before General Gordon if, after the completion of the
evacuation, he were established, as has been suggested, as
Lord Protector of Khartoum and the Valley of the Niles. To
begin with, he was face to face with a population long cruelly
oppressed and but yesterday emancipated. He was an
Englishman and a Christian in the midst of a mixed popula-
tion of Moslems and heathens. The Malays on the coast
correspond to the Arabs of the Soudan, while the Dyaks
inland resemble the negro population. These Dyaks should
properly be divided into two classes--the peaceful and the
savage; the latter, best known as the head-hunting Dyaks,
carried 'on a species of warfare, which may be'described as
the Bornean counterpart of the razzias of the slave-hunters
against whom Gordon waged unsparing war. Of the slave-
trade in the African sense there was little in Sarawak, but the
Dyaks of the hills, in their hunts for heads, contrived to inflict
as much misery upon their neighbours as even Zebehr has
. brought about in the heart of Africa. _ It is very extraordinary
I what a passion the Dyaks had for heads. When remonstrated
with, they replied that it was the custom of their ancestors,
which it was their duty to hand down unimpaired to posterity.
It was really .the women who were at the bottom of it ; no
~ Dyak woman would ever marry a man who could not display
as a trophy at least one human head. As long as the taking
of human life was an indispensable condition preliminary to
marriage, head-hunting prevailed, and all attempts to suppress
it by killing the men were utterly unavailing ; it was only when
you carried the war into the homes of the women, and burnt
their finery andall their household goods, that head-hunting went" '
out of fashion. Few Englishmen have any idea of the extent
to which this head-hunting was carried on. Immense flotillas
of head-hunters' canoes would sally forth from the rivers and
cruise along the coast, proceeding sometimes as far as 400
. miles from home. On such an expedition, sometimes 7,000
men would be engaged; each canoe carried about sixty
warriors. They landed wherever they saw a village on the
coast, slew man, woman, and child, and carried off their heads
in triumph. It is difficult to exaggerate the misery produced
over vast regions by these head-hunting expeditions, but they
were an established custom' in the country, they had existed
from time immemorial. Sir J. Brooke, however, worked
patiently on, and he had a marvellous faculty of winning the
confidence of the natives. His material resources were very
limited ; aid from Government, except an occasional man-of-
war on the coast, he had none. He had his yacht and a
private fortune, which, when all was realized, did not amount
to more than PS30,000; yet from that small beginning he
succeeded in building up a kingdom considerably larger than
Scotland. in which at this moment the authority of the law is
as supreme as in Hyde Park.

The way in which this work was accomplished was very
simple. Sir J. Brooke had little difliculty in securing the
support and devotion of. the Malays on the coast, who were.
suf'ficiently enlightened to see the benefit of a settled govern-
ment, and to welcome the rule of a just and upright Governor,
foreigner though he was. F rom this nucleus he worked along
the coast, and gradually drew inland. The Dyak tribes who
were weak, and were constantly plundered by the head-
hunters of the interior, naturally rallied round the new Rajah,
and assisted him in attacking their enemies. This was very
V simple, but very practical. The Rajah's secret was the protec-'
tion of the oppressed, and the conversion of the victims of the
, head-hunters into instruments for the suppression of head-
hunting. By small degrees, pressing forward step. by step, the
domain of order and peace was pushed inland until over the
whole of the free-grant territory head-hunting was extinct.
The work was not done with rosewater, but by dint of sheer
hard fighting ; but the whole of the blood shed in suppressing '
the custom was nothing compared with the carnage of a single '
head-hunting expedition. Operations against head-hunters are
comparatively rare now. It is more than two years now since
I had to lead an expedition against some young fellows who,
more for sport than anything else, had revived the_custom of
their ancestors, and had to be burned out in consequence. I
.know few more striking scenes in the world than the departure
of an expedition against the head-hunters. The advance is
made in the first instance by water, for the rivers are the only
highways of Sarawak. A summons is sent round to the tribes
who are exempted from taxation on condition of, rendering
military service. They assemble .in thousands, each man
bringing his own provisions of rice and salt, sufficient for three
weeks' campaign; they bring their own 'arms and their own
canoes. At the appointed time the whole force, varying,
according to circumstances, from 6,000 to 15,000 men, embark
on board some 300 to 500 canoes. The signal for starting is,
generally given by the firing of a gun ; in a moment the whole
flotilla is in motion ; every paddle strikes the water when the
flash is seen, and a great wave stirred by the thousand paddles
lashes the shore. as the expedition departs on its errand of
vengeance. The cost of such an expedition is next to nil; the
men render their services without pay, and they find their 6wn
rations. The Dyaks supply the rank and file of fighting men
under their own chiefs; the Malays supply the central or body-
guard. The great advantage which we pessess is the control
of the rivers, which afford us access to all parts of the country.

From these We operate as a base.

If any one who saw Sir J. Brooke drop anchor forty--six
years ago of? the coast of Sarawak had been told that in the
year I884 the representative of that Englishman would be
reigning with undisputed authority over the whole of the
Principality of Sarawak, maintaining peace and enforcing thev

80 Sarawak and Me Soua'an.

law, levying taxation, equipping forces, and exercising all the
functions of sovereignty, he would have naturally regarded
the prophecy as ridiculously absurd; but what would have
been his amazement if he had been informed that not only
would all those things .be accomplished, but that the foreign
'Government established with the unassisted'resources of that
solitary Englishman would have suppressed the most cherished
institutions of the natives, converted the head-hunting Dyaks,
for the most part, into pcaceable citizens, suppressed piracy,
established schools, and created acommercialvalueatPS1,ooo,ooo
annually, and is about to completely eradicate slaveiy. Such,
hOWever, is a simple statement of an accomplished fact.

This, I am told, is absolutely unique ; Sarawak stands alone,
but I do not see why, with the experience of Sarawak before
us, we should despair of accomplishing similar results in the
Soudan._ General Gordon, or whatever other Englishman
might be appointed ruler of Khartoum,---though it may be
difficult to find another so suitable as Gordon,--would have
advantages far greater than those which sufficed for the found-
ing of the Principality of Sarawak. He would occupy a
commanding position at the junction of the two Niles, from
which with the steamers already in his possession he could
dominate the country on both banks of both streams for a
thousand miles. He would have in the storehouses and
arsenals of the late Government a vast stock of necessary
material for arming and equipping such native forces as might
be necessary to assert his authority and to suppress slave-raids.
He would have no English troops, and he would- be much
better without them ; he must rely upon native strength ; he
might, of course; have a few friends as a personal staff, but
his administrators, like his soldiers, would be drawn from the
Soudan. ' (The staff in Sarawak consists of about thirty
Europeans.)

_ I do not think there would be any insuperable difficulty in
dealing with the'slave-raids on the same principle that we
have dealt with the head-hunters. Of course, if you clear out
not only the Egyptian soldiers and Bashi-Bazouks, but also the
English officer who superintends the evacuation, you hand the
Soudan over to the unchecked domination of the slave-traders
and slave-hunters ; in short, you do in the Soudan what -
would' have been done in Sarawak if when the authority of
the Sultan'of Brunei was withdrawn no other authority had
been set up in its place. In Sarawak that would have meant
handing over the whole territory to the atrocity of the head-
hunters. Are you prepared to sanction as great an infamy in
the Soudan ? It is even worse in the Soudan, for there you
have had a semi-civilized Government, and you have a great .
waterway open to the commerce of the world, which will then
be used almost exclusively for the slave trade. Sultan will
fight against sultan, tribe will prey upon tribe, the whole of
the Nile valley will be one scene of bloodshed and desolation.
Surely, if this can be avoided it ought not to be allowed to
take place. Why not let General Gordon stay in Khartoum,
with instructions to do what he can with such resources as he
finds to his hand ? England would have no responsibility for
him any more than she has for me; the trade of the Nile is
rich enough, surely, to pay the moderate expenses Vof the
simple but efficient Government which is all that is required.
There is no need to aim at a great scheme at first. Khartoum,
and as much of the Soudan as can be' covered by the range of a.
field-piece on the deck of a steamer, would form the nucleus of
a kingdom which might grow hereafter untilit included almost
all the provinces of the now abandoned empire. That, how-
ever, is for the future: the question of the hour is whether
Khartoum and the Nile are to be handed over to the slave
trade or saved for' civilization. The experience of Sarawak
seems to me to justify a hope that the latter alternative may
yet 'be found practicable.*

THE VOYAGE OF THE "FOX,"
AND DISCOVERY OF THE FATE OF SIR JOHN FRANKLIN.

HE search for Sir John Franklin and his lost men and
ships occupies a large space in the history of modern
Arctic exploration. It was in 1845 that .Her Majesty's ships,
Erebus and Terror, under captains Sir John Franklin and
Crozier, were sent to endeavour to find a way from the North
Polar Sea, through Behring's Straits, into the Pacific Ocean.
This was the famous " North-West Passage," which had been
the dream of the-early Elizabethan age, and in search of which
in recent times many gallant seamen had volunteered to sail.
John and James Ross, Parry, Richardson, and many others
went forth, from 1818'to 1840, and laboured and suffered
much, in unavailing efforts to carry out to completion this
' desire of their countrymen, and of men of science all over the
world. _ ' '

European geographers knew that Behring's Straits were
navigable; that the Mackenzie River discharged itself into a
salt-water sea ; and that Baffin's Bay separated Greenland from

.the North American Continent. The object was to connect
these three knownpoints, and to discover an open way round
North America to the Indies.

When the expedition set forth, in 1845, there was a very
sanguine though unfounded confidence in an easy success. So
much had been discovered in previous voyages; the ships
were so well equipped and well manned, that no one seems to
have expressed any doubt that the Admiralty order was quite.
sufficient to insure its achievement. Previous difficulties,
hardships, and failures were ignored ; no cautions were given
as to establishing depots as they advanced, in case of retreat -
being necessary, or to afford information to those who might
have to seek them; no overland expeditions were organized-
to co-operate from the North American mainland; and no
means of rescue provided; in case the ships were lost, and inT/ze Voyage of Me "Fox." 83 '

case the crews had to retire upon the Hudson's Bay territories.
They sailed amidst boundless enthusiasm, and everyone
expected to hear of them again from a very different region of
the world.

When the winter of 1847 closed, and no tidings of Franklin
~ and his comrades had ever come, people began to feel uneasy.

Two winters had already passed, and the ships were only
provisioned up to the spring of 1848. Then the search for
Franklin was commenced. No better proof exists of the
_ vigour and perseverance with which it was prosecuted, year
after year, for eleven long years, from 1848 to 1859, than the
comparison of Arctic charts and maps at the beginning and
close of _ the period. More was done in the way of geographical
discovery in those regions in these few years than in two
centuries previously. Every channel and inlet seemed to be
penetrated; every island and shore searched, in that vast
Arctic archipelago, before their energies were turned in the
right direction. The ships were used chiefly as affording the
basis of operations, the officers and men passing the most of
their time in expeditions on foot over the frozen lands, in
seeking first to save the lives of the one hunded and forty
missing comrades,.and, when this seemed hopeless, to solve
the mystery of their fate. America joined with England in
the noble efl'orts. No less than forty thousand miles, it is
estimated, were journeyed over by upwards of one hundred
sledging expeditions, often at terrible risks and always with
extreme hardships. _

The history of these various exploring voyages and expedi-
tions will ever hold a high place in the annals of the British
navy. The records of hair-breadth escapes from wreck and
famine,- of firm, manly reliance in God and their own energy ;
of proofs of a courage which no danger could daunt, and an
endurance which no suffering could subdue, thrill the lands-
man as he reads them, and must ever stimulate futuregenera~
tions of seamen to emulate such deeds of " high empriie." If
any proofs are wanted that the seamen of our time have in no
way fallen off in the enterprise, hardihood, and courage of
their forefathers, they will be found in the narratives of modern
Arctic exploration, and especially in the expeditions in search
of Sir John Franklin. I

But while the interest of these narratives will always remain,
it must be confessed that there is, also, in some degree, a
sameness in their perusal. The battling with waves and ice-
bergs; the long, dreary Arctic winters; the details of geo-
graphical discovery in regions so inhospitable and 'unfruitful,
all this would. pall on the taste'were it not the hope ever
springing up of a successful issue to the search for the lost
explorers. The later volumes of this library of Arctic travel
leave a painful'and wearisome impression on the mind, and
people 'began to feel, as it were, a relief, when a narrative was
advertised with the title of "The Last of the Arctic Voyagers,"
almost wishing it to be the last as well as the latest _of these
fruitless expeditions. The Admiralty and the Government of
the day recognized the state of public opinion, and refused to
sanction further search at the nation's approval and cost.

Then came the voyage of the good ship Fox. At the darkest
hour of public despair as to the search the'light of a new hope
arose. The devoted wife of Franklin was'not discouraged by
the adverse decision of the naval authorities. She, with the
aid of a few sympathizing friends, resolved to have another
expedition, and in Captain, now Sir Leopold, M'Clintock, she
found a leader worthy of the adventure. To this voyage we
owe the discovery of the only authentic document which
rewards the long search for the lost expedition. Other tidings
' have since been gleaned, and other relics recovered, but the
romance of the successful search belongs to the " Narrative
of the discovery of the fate of Sir John Franklin and his
companions," as told by M'Clintock. Here is the substance

, of the story. .
It was in the summer of 1857 that the little steam yacht

Fax, screw fitted, and only of 177 tons burden, set out on her
perilous mission. She left Aberdeen on the Ist of July, and
by the 8th of August, under sail and steam, she was striving
to find a way through the great belt of broken ice which
streams down from Baffin's Bay into the Atlantic Ocean.
Satisfied, after a close examination of many miles of its margin,
that no passage across the Bay towards Lancaster Sound
could be forced, the Fox's prow was turned northward, and an
attempt made to go round Melville Bay. But before the
" middle ice " could be rounded, the short summer had passed,
and wintry weather set in. On the 7th of September, after
gallant efforts to cut, bore, or warp through the pack, the Fox
was frozen in, and there was no alternative but to drift with
the ice where it listed. She remained thus enchained with
frozen fetters till April 17th, 1858, never moving from her
involuntary moorings. In these eight dreary months she
drifted helplessly far south of the Arctic Circle, which she had
so gaily entered. During the 242 days she had been impacted
in the ice, she had travelled no less than 1,385 miles, the
longest drift on record.

We can imagine the wild grandeur of this scene of solitude,
when the little ship, a mere speck on the vast frozen sea, was
thus drifting helplessly southward. There were only twenty-
five souls on board, all told, twenty-two of the crew, with the
captain, and Lieutenant Hobson second in command, and
Captain Allen Young, an experienced Arctic navigator, sailing

. master. We can enter into the feelings of the gallant captain,
as he writes in his Journal-- _
. " Everything around us is painfully still, excepting when an
occasional .iceberg spilts off from the parent glacier; then we
hear a rumbling crash like distant thunder, and the wave
occasioned by the launch reaches us in six or seven minutes,
and makes the ship roll lazily for a similar period. I cannot
imagine' that within the whole compass of nature's varied
aspects there is presented to the human eye a scene so well
adapted for promoting deep and serious reflection, for lifting
. the thoughts f1om trivial things of eve13 -day life to others of
the highest' import. '
The glacier serves to remind one at onc'e of time and of
eternity--of time, since we see portions of it break off to drift
and' melt away; and of eternity, since its downward march is
so extremely slow, and its augmentations behind so regular,
that no change in its appearance is perceptible from age to age.
If even the untaught savages of luxuriant tropical regions
regard the earth merely as a temporary abode, surely all who
gaze upon this ice-overwhelmed region, this wide eXpanse of
' terrestrial wreck,' must be similarly assured that here ' we
have no abiding place.' "

It needs, indeed, a noble enthusiasm, a steadiness of purpose,
to carry men bravely through such scenes, the awfulness of
which was enhanced by darkness, monotony, and the constant
dangers of a winter's drift in that polar pack. All their visions
of success in 1857 were gone--all hope of returning home
in 1858, with the important news which their eager hopes
assured them they should obtain, deferred until 1859. Yet
M'Clintock neither' bewails his misfortune nor doubts his
ultimate success--all his fears, when he expresses any, are for
" poor Lady Franklin; how disappointed she will be!" At
last, after long months of imprisonment, the day of release
came for the little Fox, but was aday indeed of frightful danger.
On Saturday, the 24th of April, Captain M Clintock writes: --

" It is now ten o'clock 1n the evening , the long ocean swell
already lifts its crest five feet above the hollow of the sea,
causing its thick covering of icy fragments to dash against each.
other and against us with unpleasant violence. It is, however,
very beautiful to look upon the dear old familiar ocean swell l
It has long been a stranger to us, and is welcome in our
solitude. If the Fox was as solid as her neighbours,I am
quite sure she would enter into this ice-tournament with all
their apparent ,heartiness, instead of audibly making known
her sufferings to us. Every considerable surface of ice has
been broken into many smaller ones. With feelings of exul-
tationI watched the process from aloft. A flee-piece near us,
of one hundred yards in diameter, was speedily cracked so as to
resemble a sort of labyrinth, or, still more, a field-spider's web.
In the course of half an hour the family resemblance was totally
lost ; they. had so battered each other, and struggled out of their
original regularity. The rolling sea can no longer be checked.
" The pack has taken upon itself the functions of an ocean,' as
Dr. Kane graphically expresses it."

By midnight the Fox was striving for sweet life through this
rolling sea of ice. Sunday, the 25th of April, came in; the
swell was ten feet high, the shocks from the ice so severe that
the crew could hardly keep their feet on deck, and the vessel
had to be steered very nicely so as to keep her_sharp stem
towards the charging 'masses. Still, aided by the screw and
steam, the stout yacht fought her way outwards to the open'
sea ; an iceberg was passed, it was nearly seventy feet high, and
" crashing through the pack," while from the small water space
left in its wake the seas were throwing spray quite over its
summit--a pretty good proof of the fearful commotion through
which the Fox was seeking a way. The swell still increased,
and rolled along more swiftly--an ugly sea, thickly strewn
with heavy ice.

At sea! writes Captain M'Clintock on the next day, " It has
pleased God to accord to us a deliverance in which His merci-
ful protection contrasts, how strongly! with our own utter
helplessness." It appeared as if the mercies vouchsafed during
the long, long winter and mysterious ice-drift " had been con-
centrated and repeated in a single act ; and, after yesterday's
experience," he adds, " I can understand how men's hair has
turned grey in a few hours." The Fox, however, passes out
of the ice in Davis's Strait only to refit in Greenland, and '
again enter it a month afterwards. Mcn so stanch deserved to
succeed. The middle-ice was cleared ; the Esquimaux stories
from Pond's Bay about white men and ships disposed of by
personal examination; Lancaster Sound reached ,' Beechey
Island, the great Arctic store depot, visited; and on August
16th they sailed up Barrow's Strait. That night the Fox " was
battling against a strong wind with sea," and so unusually clear
of ice was this channel that on the 17th the gallant captain
writes :-- '

" I7th.--.Last night battling against wind and sea, in rain
and fog. To-day much loose ice is seen southward of Griffith's
Island. The weather improved this afternoon, and we shot -
gallantly past Limestone Island, and are now steering down
Peel Strait, all of us in a wild state of excitement--a mingling
of anxious hopes and fears ! _ .

I8th.--For twenty-five miles last evening we ran unobstruct-
edly down Peel Strait, but then came in sight of unbroken ice,
extending across it from shore to shore ! It was much decayed,
and of one year's growth only; yet as the strait continues to
contract for sixty miles further, and it appeared to me to afl'ord
so little hope of becoming navigable in the short remainder. of
the season, I immedialegy turned about for Bella! S/rm't, as afford-
ing a better prospect - of a passage into the western sea
discovered by Sir James Ross from Four River Point in 1849.
Our disappointment at the interruption of our progress was
as sudden as it was severe. We did not linger in hope of a
change, but steered out again into the broad waters of Barrow's
Strait."

This rapidity of decision, when combined with correct judg-
ment and great nerve, is the most essential qualification in the
Arctic navigator,>> who has no time to cast about, lest the right
moment slip away. Success rewarded the captain's attempt to
reach Bellot Strait, and with but little hindrance he had within
seventy hours repassed Barrow's Strait, visited Leopold harbour,
secured the depet established there by Ross in 1848, and
sailed down Regent's Inlet into" the entrance of the remarkable
strait which cleaves North Somerset and Boothia. Here, A
happily for the Fox and her gallant company, as we believe,
they found the sea to the westward of Boothia still choked
with ice, and Captain M'Clintock was obliged to be satisfied
with wintering in the very excellent position which had been

- vouchsafed to him, for while his retreat to Baffin's Bay
was open annually in his rear,'the coasts of King William's
Land were only 150 miles distant from Bellot Strait'in his '
front.

The winter of 1858-59 was an unusually severe one in 72
deg. north, and its severity was augmented by the position of
their winter quarters. The lofty granitic cliffs of Bellot Strait;
with the hills, 1,500 feet high, of Murchison Promontory, on
the one side, and those of North Somerset on the other, formed
a funnel through which the storm and the snow-drift seemed
to be' ever revelling in wildest mood, while the deep waters of
the strait rolled ever to and fro with fierce rapidity, chasing
and grinding the heavy ice borne into it from that hopeless
western se'a. " Even when we have a calm night," says
M'Clintock, " we can hear the crushing sounds of the drift ice
in Bellot Strait, and it emits dark chilling clouds of hateful,
pestilent, abominable mist."

The sun of 1859 had hardly thrown his light over North
Somerset when we find- Captain M'Clintock and his comrade,
Allen Young, braving a temperature of 48 deg. minus of F ah-
renheit, or 80 deg. below the freezing point of water, in sledg-
ing parties to the westward and southward. The' great object
of Captain MfClintock's visit to. these frozen wilds seemed at
once to be within his grasp, for from Esquimaux he recovered
many relics of the Franklin Expedition, all of which they
assured him came from a party of " starving white men " who
had reached an island in the mouth of the great river'(Montreal
Island), after their ship had been crushed by the ice in the sea
to the west of King William's Land. This one ship, for_ they
knew not of a second, must have been either the Erebz'ts or
Terror, and their intelligence confirmed Captain M'Clintock in
directing his principal division of sledges to the search of King
William's Land, while the uncertainty as to the fate of the
second vessel compelled him to detach his able comrade,
' Young, to Search the shores of Prince of Wales Land, in case
she might have been there wrecked or beset.

Early in April every man, dog, and-sledge that 'could possi:
bly be spared from the Fox started upon their final and momen-
tous duty. Allen Y'oung faithfully accomplished all the work
assigned him in spite of many difficulties and much sufi'ering.
He found no trace of Franklin's Expedition, but he discovered
380 miles of coast-line, established the insularity of Prince of
wales Land, and connected Sir James Ross's furthest in 1848
with the shores of Bellot Strait.

On the other hand, Captain M'Clintock, Lieutenant I'Iobson,
' and Carl Petersen explored the entire coast of King William's
Land, as well as the west coast of Boothia and the estuary-of
the Great Fish River, and, above all, they discovered at Point
Victory a document--the only document as yet found--in
which the death of Franklin and the achievements and loss of ,
his expedition are at last revealed to us. From that record,
the relics found, the information nowbrought home, as well as
Esquimaux reports, which Carl Petersen's cross-examinations
rectify to a very considerable extent, we are able to put to-
gether' the following facts, and they briefly account for the
Erebus and Terror up to the period of their abandonment by
the crews, and of the subsequent fate of those gallant men.
The tale is briefly as follows :--

The Erebus 'and Terror, under Franklin and Crozier, in the
same year (1845) that they left England, proceeded up Barrow's
Straits; entering Wellington Channel (of which'we then only
knew the southern headlands), they sailed up that remarkable
~ straight to the 77th degree of north latitude, some miles fur-
ther than was attained" by Her Majesty's ships Assistance and
Pioneer, under Captains Belcher and Osborn, in 185 2. From
the northern outlet of Wellington Channel Franklin was
obliged to retrace his steps southward, and this, in all pro-
bability, owing to his finding the path to the westward
hopelessly blocked with ice. He discovered, however, a new
channel between Bathurst and Cornwallis Island, and must

have re-entered Barrow's Straits very near the point at which
'the expedition of 1850, under Captains Austin and' Ommanney,
wintered--enamely, Griffith's Island.

Having accomplished this almost unparalleled extent of

s
Arctic navigation in the open season of _I845, Franklin pro-
ceeded to Beechey Island, and there, as we have long known,
passed his first winter, with the loss' of only three men out of
the entire complement of 129 souls in the expedition. In that
explorationof 1845 Franklin discovered fully 500 miles of new
coast-line, and explored two channels, of a combined length of
2 50 miles; subsequently, searching parties have gone over
and rediscovered nearly every inch of this ground, and it is
strange, that, throughout its whole extent, the Franklin Expe-
dition should have erected no cairn, placed no record; and,
still more so, that they should have again sailed from Beechey.
Island for a second effort in accomplishment of their task--the
discovery of the North-West Passage--without placing in some
of the many cairns erected around their winter quarters a
statement of their past success and of their future intentions.
We can accountforsuch a fatal omission but in one .way,
that they were so confident of reaching Behring's Straits or the
American continent that it.was never deemed possible others
would follow on their footsteps to aid or assist them, and that,
if the anxiety of the leader led him even to contemplate the
possibility of failure in carrying his followers to the Pacific,
he supposed, when his expedition had outstayed its time from
England, that the same steps for his relief Would be repeated
as had been carried out when John Ross was missing in the
Victory--that parties would be merely sent overland down the
Great Fish and other rivers to rescue him. .
At any rate, in 1846, without placing any record at Becchey
Island, the Franklin Expedition sailed to reach the American
continent, at or near the Great Fish River, whence to Behring's
Straits the ground had been already explored. The concurrent
testimony of all the Arctic navigators who have subsequently
visited the seas round Cape Walker and Prince of Wales Land,
go to maintain that it was down between that land and North
Somerset that Franklin found his way to the south. Great
success again attended this second cruise of the intrepid navi-
gator, and it was not until he had accomplished 250 miles
down a new strait, which now bears the name of Franklin,
that his expedition was overtaken by winter and beset in the
ice. They were only twelve miles from and in sight of Cape '
Felix, a headland of what was then supposed to be a promon-
tory of the continent of America, and known as King William's
Land. The second winter, that of 1846-47, was passed in this
tantalizing position; but considering how'large had been their
success in each of the previous summers that they had passed
in the Arctic zone there was everything to cheer the ofi'icers
and men and assure them of perfect success in 1847, the more
so that Cape Herschel, the point at which the connection of the'
Pacific and Atlantic oceans would be established, was barely
ninesz miles distant. '
We are, therefore, not astonished to find the officer in charge
of a sledge party which left the Erebus in May 1847, describ-
ing their condition 1n the expedition to be " All well, Sir John
Franklin 1n command. " The trail' of the sledge party, as shown
by certain cairns, indicated that it went to the south-west, very
probably to connect the coast-line with Cape Herschel, and to
cheer up the ship's companies with the glorious intclligence
that they had really discovered the long-sought passage. So
far all was indeed well, but the summer of 1847 must have
been one of those " close seasons," of which our Arctic sailors
have had such trying experience. The ships appear to have
drifted a very short distance to the south- West, and to have .
been constantly beset. Sickness seems to have broken out,
Sir John Franklin died as early as the 12th of June, and We
_ are appall'ed to find, when the spring of 1848 dawns upon the
expedition, that, since leaving Beechey Island, no less than -
twenty-'one souls had perished, nine of whom were officers. '
We need not say that scurvy and starvation must have been
rife during that winter of 1847- 48, for we find in Captain
' M'Clintock's narrative ample testimony to show that even in
his small crew, in spite of a far more nutritious and liberal
dietary than ever Franklin's crews could have had, scurvy'
was making steady and fatal inroads during even a secondT/Le Voyage oft/1e "F0563, 93

winter in the ice. This fearful loss of life, and the fact that
the expedition was only provisioned to the spring of 1848,
obliged Captains Crozier and Fitzjames to direct a retreat and
abandonment of the ships, and as they had no choice, they led
one hundred and five poor starving sailors and officers away
from the Erebus and T error on the 22nd of April, and did not
reach the land, though only fifteen miles distant, until April
2 5th--a.sad proof of how weak or encumbered with sick they
must have been.

On that 25th of April they write that they start on the
morrow, the 26th, for the Fish River! The next time they
were seen or heard of alive was by some Esquimaux, who
were sealing on King William's Land; the "starving white
men" were then only about forty in number, all, withgexception
'of a chief, "a tall, stout man," were dragging at a sledge;
they were hungry and thin ; they purchased seal's flesh ; they
fell down and died as they marched along! What became of
this forlorn hope of forty individuals we will presently relate,
but how they had suffered up to the point at -which these
Esquimaux met them, the wreck-strewn beaches of King
William's Land but too sadly tell. An abandoned boat, with
two_ skeletons in it, only half-way from the Erebns and Terror
to Cape Hersehel, indicated some attempt to return towards
the ships, or such weakness that they could no longer drag
what was so essential to them in the ascent of such a stream
_as the Great Fish River. Another skeleton was discovered
some miles beyond Cape Herschel], and' Heaven only knows
whether the bleaching bones of the unaccounted for sixty
individuals lie under the snows of King William's Land, or in
the depths of its ice-encumbered sea. Clothing, sledge gear,
and personal equipment of all descriptions were found on that
west coast of King William's Land by Captain M'Clintock and
Lieutenant Hobson, but no provisions ;, this fact alone only too
painfully brings home to us the melancholy end of the un-
fortunate crews of the Erebus and Terror. I

Of the " forlorn'hope " seen in the spring by the Esquimaux
we have a clue in the visit. of Mr. Anderson to Montreal
Island, at the mouth of the Great Fish River in 185 5, and the
traces he found all went to corroborate the report gleaned
from the natives, by Dr. Rae, in I854--that in the summer of
the same year, and subsequent to the period that the natives
had seen them alive, the corpses of thirty white men, and
some graves containing others, were discovered in one spot,
near the great river, and five more dead bodies on an adjacent
island. Some of these dead white men were in aftent ; others
under a boat turned over for shelter, and the ofiicer was again
recognized by his having a telescope and double-barrell'ed gun
near him. Nothing can be more circumstantial than this
evidence, and it all goes to prove that, although some portion
of the starving crews reached the continent of America, at the 1
entrance of the Great Fish River, that they there perished
of starvation, and on Captain M'Clintock's visit to.'Montreal
Island, every vestige or relic of them had been swept away by
the natives, although in 1855- traces of Europeans having been

there were pretty numerous.
Apart from an official record contained 1n a cylinder, and

already damaged by iron rust, not a single journal, log, or
' manuscript was discovered calculated to give any additional
information as to the proceedings of the lost expedition. In-
deed, it was not until the retreating party reached King
William's Land that the idea seems to have struck the officers
commanding, that any record of their past acts or future in-
. tentions ought to be left in cache ; and, instead of a carefully
prepared document being brought from the ships and left at
Cape Victory, they merely opened the usual official notice,
which Commander Gore had. placed there in 1847, and in the
bitter temperature of an Arctic April day, Captains Crozier
and Fitzjames added a few brief, though graphic, sentences, in
which all we shall probably ever know of that sad tale is
revealed to us. I
Yet we will not blame them ; suffering, disease, and starva-
tion_had doubtless caused all their thoughts and feelings to be
concentrated in the one great idea of saving their lives in that

forthcoming summer. It was far more than they could all

hope to do, and the strong would assuredly have preferred to

drag a sick shipmate rather than a load of logs or journals;

nay, more, had they even carried such dead weight to the

shore, would they not, we ask, have placed them under the

cairn at Cape Victory, around which, we are told, there was

a pile of abandoned clothing and equipment, indicative of
'weakness, and a desire to lighten themselves of every en-

cumbrance? That a few prayer-books and religious works,

capable of being carried in the pocket, were discovered in the -
abandoned boat, is true ,' but that only shows how utter must

have been the exhaustion of our starving sailors, when they

parted with the last solace of men, who knew their days were

numbered. .

All goes to prove that in the ships .was left all further
'record of the voyage of the Erebus and Tenor. One vessel
indubitably sank when the ice broke up; the other was
evidently carried round Capes Crozier, or Herschel], into the
haunts of the Esquimaux, .and one party of these savages
distinctly pointed out that she had been lying upon that coast
within a somewhat recent date. In 1859 this wreck had like-
wise disappeared, for every part of the coast was narrowly
examined for her ; the ice had either swept her ofl~ the beach,
and she had then probably sunk in deep water, or the natives
had applied fire to detach the wood and metal, in which she
was a mine of wealth to them.

Such is the tale of Captain M'Clintock, and grateful ought
every one to be that at last such conclusive intelligence was
gained of an expedition, the search for which has called forth
so much zeal and self-sacrifice. The official acknowledgment
from the Admiralty, of the services of Lady Franklin's expe-
' dition, very justly says that Captain M'Clintock has rendered
important service " in bringing home the only authentic intelli-
gence of the death of Sir john Franklin, and of the fate of the
crews of the Erebus and Terror," and his Sovereign gracefully96 Perils in #222 Ice.

evinced her high appreciation of the gallant officer's services
by an Order in Council granting him sea-time for every day
he commanded the Fax yacht, as if his pendant had been
flying on board one of Her Majesty's ships l--a handsome
compliment, right worthily bestowed. The return voyage of
the Fox to England was a prosperous one, and the little craft
was sold to be used as an Arctic sealing vessel.

The writer of the notice in the T z'mes of Captain M'Clintock's
book, himself evidently well acquainted with Arctic affairs,
and to whom we are indebted for valuable information, states
that neither the captain, nor Allen Young, the sailing master,
would accept any recompense for their services from private
hands, and that of the PSI0,000 which the expedition cost,
about PS7,000 came from Lady Franklin's own purse. The
gold medal of the Royal Geographical Society was presented
to her as an honourable recognition of her husband's services
in discovering the North-West Passage, and the monuments
in Westminster Abbey and Waterloo Place recall the memory
of Franklin, Crozier, Fitzjames, and their gallant comrades,
who fell in the execution of a duty which had been assigned
to them by their countrymen. The services of M'Clintock,
with the good ship Fox, will always hold an honourable place
in the records of Arctic voyages and travels.

PERILS IN THE ICE.

N the year 1770 the Society of the Moravian Brethren first
I established mission stations on the coast of Labrador.
Every year since that date a ship has been sent from the
Thames, sometimes for the conveyance of passengers, but
always for carrying the store's necessary for the life and com-
fort of the dwellers in those remote settlements. The records
of these. voyages are preserved in the Periodical Accounts
published by the Society. Many remarkable events appear in"mun". or 'nm cool) sun 'mumoxri [Mgr 97.Peril: in t/ze Ice. 97

these recordS, the ships having been often exposed to great
perils, and having met with memorable adventures, in times
both of war and peace. Through the protection of Divine
Providence, in all the years that have passed, the voyage has
been made in safety, although the ships have encountered the
dangers common to those seas and coasts. One of the most
perilous voyages was that of the year 1817, in the Jemima, the
predecessor of successive ships which, under the name of the
Harmony, have continued the voyages from 1818 to the present
time.

The Jemzma reached Stromness from London on the 14th of
'June, and thence had a favourable voyage across the Atlantic.
Up to the end of June all went well, but a few days later the
record, as given by Brother Kmoch, a veteran missionary who
was on board, bears a more stirring character :--

Between the 4th and 5th ofJuly we heard and saw many ice-
birds, This bird is about the size of a Starling, black, with
white and yellow spots, and is met with about 200 English
miles from the Labrador coast. _When the sailors hear it,
they know that they are not far from the ice. It flies about
a ship chiefly in the night, and is known by its singular voice,
which resembles'a loud laugh. L

7th.--The morning was cold and rainy. In all directions
drift-ice was to be seen. In the afternoon it cleared up a
little, and we entered an opening in the ice, looking like a bay.
The continual rustling and roaring of the ice reminded us of
the noise made by the carriages in the streets of London, when
one is standing in the golden gallery of St. Paul's Cathedral.
The mountains and large flakes of ice take all manner of
singular forms, some resembling castles, others churches, wag-
gons, and even creatures of various descriptions. As we or
they changed positions, the same objects acquired a quite
different appearance; and what had before appeared like a
church, looked like a huge floating monster. Sitting on deck,
and contemplating these wonderful works of God, I almost

lost myself in endeavouring to solve the question,---" for what
7
purpose these exhibitions are made, when so few can behold
them, as they so soon vanish, by returning to their former
fluid and undefined state?" But surely everything is done
with design, though short-sighted man cannot comprehend it.
Having in vain exerted ourselves to penetrate through the ice,
we returned at night into the open sea.

14th.---Land was discovered ahead. It was the coast of
Labrador, sixty or eighty miles south of Hopedale. We were
close to the ice, and, as. a small opening presented itself, the
captain ventured to push in, hoping, if he could penetrate, to
find open water between the ice and the coast. For some
time we got nearer to the land, but were obliged at night to
fasten the ship with two grapnels to a large field. This was
elevated between five and six feet above the water's edge, and .
between fifty and sixty feet in thickness below it. It might
be three hundred feet in diameter, flat at the top, and smooth
as a meadow covered with snow. The wind has but little
power over such huge masses, and they move very slowly
with the current. There are small streams and pools of fresh
water found in all those large pieces. Our situation now
defended us against the smaller flakes, which rushed by and
were turned off by the large field without reaching the ship.
We Were all pleased with our place of refuge, and lay here
three whole days, with the brightest weather, and as safe as in
the most commodious haven ; but I cannot say that I felt easy,
though I hid my anxiety from the party. I feared that a gale
of wind might overtake us in this situation, and carry fields
larger than that in which we lay, when the most dreadful
consequences might ensue ; and the sequel proved that I was
not much mistaken. -

On the 17th the wind came 'round from the south, and we
conceived fresh hopes of the way being'rendered open for us.

I8th.--The weather was clear, and the wind in our favour;
we therefore took up our grapnel, got clear of our floating
haven, and again endeavoured to penetrate through some small
openings. Both we and the ship's company were peculiarly
impressed with gratitude for the protection and rest we had
enjoyed, and the warmth of a summer's sun felt very
comfortable among these masses of ice. The clearness of
the atmosphere to-day caused them to-appear singularly
picturesque. It seemed as if we were surrounded by im--
mense white walls and towers. In the afternoon we had
penetrated to the open water, between the ice and the land,
but we durst not venture nearer, as the sea is here full of
sunken rocks, and the captain knew of no harbour on this
part of the coast. Having found another large piece of ice
convenient for the purpose, we fastened the ship to it. In the
evening a thick fog overspread us from the north-east, and we
were again quite surrounded by ice, which, however, was
soon after dispersed by a strong north-west wind.

In the night, between the 19th and 20th, we were driven
back by a strong current to nearly the same situation we had
left on the 17th, only somewhat nearer the coast. On the
20th, the morning was fine, and we vainly endeavoured to get
clear, but towards evening the sky lowered, and it grew very
dark. The air felt so oppressive that we all went to bed, and
every one of us was troubled with uneasy dreams. At
midnight We heard a great noise on deck. We hastened
thither to know the cause, and found the ship driving fast
towards a huge ice-mountain, on which we expected every
moment to suffer shipwreck. The sailors exerted themselves
to the utmost, but it was by God's merciful providence alone
that we were saved. The night was exceedingly cold, with
rain, and the poor people suffered much. We were now
driven to and fro at the mercy of the ice, till one in the
morning, when we succeeded in fastening the ship again to a
large field. But all this was only the prelude to greater
terrors. Deliverance from danger is so gratifying that it
raises one's spirits above the common level. We made a
hearty breakfast, and retired again into our cabins. At one
o'clock the cook, in his usual boisterous way, aroused us by
announcing dinner, and putting a large piece of pork and a
huge pudding upon the table, of which we partook with a good
appetite, but in silence, every one seemingly buried in thought,
or onlyvhalf-awake. Shortly after, the wind changed to north-
east and north, increasing gradually, till it turned into a furious
storm. Top-masts were lowered, and everything done to ease
the ship. We now saw an immense ice-mountain at a distance,
towards which we were driving, without the power of turning
aside. Between six and seven we were again roused by a
great outcry on deck. We ran up, and saw our ship, with the
field to which we were fast, with great swiftness approaching
towards the mountain; nor did there appear the smallest hope
of escaping being crushed to atoms between it and the field.
However, by veering out as much cable as we could, the ship
got to such a distance that the mountain passed through
between us and the field. We all cried fervently to the Lord
for speedy help in this most perilous situation, for if we had
but touched the mountain, we must have been instantly-
destroyed. One of our cables was broken, and we lost a
grapnel; the ship also sustained some damage. 'But we were
now left to the mercy of the storm and current, both of which
were violent; and exposed likewise to thick masses of ice,
which floated all around us.

The following night was stormy and dreadfully dark, the
heavens covered with the blackest clOuds driven by a furious
wind, the roaring and the howling of the ice as it moved
along, the fields shoving and dashing against each other, were
truly terrible. A fender was made of a large beam, suspended
by ropes to the ship's sides, to secure her in some measure
from the ice, but the ropes were soon cut by its sharp edges,
and we lost the fender. Repeated attempts were now made
to make the ship again fast to some large field; and the
second mate, a clever young man, full of spirit and willing-
ness, swung mmself several times of? upon such fields as
approached us, endeavouring to fix a grapnel to them, but in
vain, and we even lost another grapnel, .on this occasion.
The storm indeed dispersed the ice, and made openings in
several places; but our situation was thereby rendered only
still more alarming, for when the ship got into open water,
her motion became more rapid by the power of the wind,
and consequently the blows she received from the ice more
violent. Whenever, therefore, we perceived a field of ice
through the gloom, towards which we were hurried, nothing
appeared more probable than that the violence of the shock
would determine our fate, and be attended with immediate
destruction to the vessel. Such shocks were repeated every
five or ten minutes, and sometimes oftener, and the longer she
remained exposed to the wind, the more violently she ran
against the sharp edges and spits of the ice, not having any
power to avoid them. After every stroke we tried the pumps,
to find whether we had sprung a leak; but the Lord kept
His hand over us, and preserved us in a manner almost
miraculous. In this awful situation, we offered up fervent
prayers to Him, who alone is able to save, and besought Him
that, if it were His Divine will that we should end our lives
among the ice, He would, for the sake of His precious merits,
soon take us home to Himsclfl-nor let us die a miserable
death from cold and hunger, floating about in this boisterous
ocean.

It is impossible to describe all the horrors of this eventful
night, in which we expected every approaching ice-field to be
fraught with death. We were full ten hours in this dreadful
situation, till about six in the morning, when we were driven
into open water, not far from the coast. We could hardly
believe that we had got clear of the ice; all seemed as a'
dream. We now ventured to carry some sail, with a view to
bear up against the wind. The ship had become leaky, and
we were obliged to keep the pump a-going, with only about
ten minutes' rest at a time. Both the sailors and we were
thereby so much exhausted that, whenever any one-sat down,
he immediately fell asleep.

During the afternoon the wind abated, and towards evening
it fell calm. A thick mist ensued, which, however, soon
dispersed, when we found ourselves near a high rock, towards
which the current was fast carrying us. We were now in
danger of suffering shipwreck among the rocks, but, by God's
mercy, the good management of our captain succeeded in
. steering clear of them ; and after sunset the heavens were free
from clouds. A magnificent northern light illumined the
horizon, and, as we were again among floating pieces of ice,
its brightness enabled us to avoid them. I retired to rest,
but, after midnight, was roused by the cracking noise made
by the ice against the sides of the vessel. In an instant I was
on deck, and found that we were forcing our way through
a quantity of floating ice, out of which we soon got again into
open water. The wind also turned in our favour, and carried
us swiftly forward towards the Hopedale shore. Every one
on board was again in full expectation of soon reaching
the end of our voyage, and ready to forget all former troubles.
But, alas l arriving at the same spot from which we had been
driven yesterday, we found our way anew blocked up with a
vast quantity of ice. The wind also drove us irresistibly
towards it. We were now in a great dilemma. If we went
between the islands, where the sea is full of sunken rocks,
we were in danger of striking upon one of them, and being
instantly lost; again, if we ventured into the ice, it was
doubtful whether the ship would bear many more such shocks
as she had received. At length the former measure was
determined on, as, in case of any mishap, there might be some
pcssibility of escaping to shore.

After encountering a succession of further perils and dis-
appointments for three additional weeks, the lemz'ma was
brought safely into Hopedale harbour on the 9th of August. _

To the foregoing narrative the following remarks are
appended by the editor of the "Periodical Accounts " :--" The
captain and mate report that, though for these three years
past they have met with an unusual quantity of ice on the
coast of Labrador, yet, in no year since the beginning of
the Mission, has it appeared so dreadfully on the increase.A Parliamentary Deeate in T a/zz'tz'. 103

The colour likewise of this year's ice was different from that
usually seen, and the size of the ice-mountains and thickness
of the fields immense, with sand-stones embedded in them.
As a great part of the coast of Greenland, which for centuries
has been choked up with ice, apparently immovable, has, by
some revolution, been cleared, this may perhaps account for
the great quantity alluded to."

 

A PARLIAMENTARY DEBATE lN TAHITI.

FTER the people of Tahiti and the other Windward
A Islands of the South Sea had received the religious
teaching of the Christian missionaries, they sought instruction
as to the principles and practice of civil government. The
chiefs declared their readiness to give up their personal and
despotic rule, and to adopt a suitable constitution and just
laws. There was much consultation and deliberation, and at
length, at the request of the chiefs, the. missionaries prepared
a draft of a constitution and of a code of laws, to be submitted
for the approval of the chiefs. The advice given was to
summon a conference of the chiefs and leading men, and
to discuss the proposals offered for their consideration.

Accordingly, an assembly was convened, consisting of the
adult male members of the royal family of Tahiti, the same
of the principal chiefs, these being hereditary legislators; to
whom Were added, as representatives of the people, two
members from each Mataaina or district, appointed by the
people themselves. The place of meeting was at Papaoa,
as being convenient of access for the members from other
islands, as well as those in Tahiti. Mr. Nott, the senior
missionary, was requested to act as president or speaker.
The other missionaries were present, but took no part in the
proceedings, and there were also present Mr. Tyerman and
Mr. Bennett, a deputation from the London Missionary
Society, then on._a tour round the world, for the purpose
of visiting the various stations of that Society. Except the
president, all the members were natives, and it was the first
native parliament of the Windward Islands, held for the
purpose of legislation and government. In old times no
council had met except for unholy or warlike conference.

The draft of the code had been previously prepared by Mr.
Nott, at the request of the chiefs and people, the general
principles and specific enactments having been frequently and
fully canvassed in several conferences, and recognized by all
present as the basis of the literal form in which the same
should be embodied and promulgated. This code, thus
adopted, consisted of about forty articles, which appeared to
comprehend all the necessary provisions for maintaining social
order, promoting public welfare, and securing the rights and
privileges of all ranks among the community, with regard to
life, liberty, and property. For instance, in regard to theft,
upon conviction there was to be reparation fourfold, and for
repetition of the offence, hard labour, to the extent of five
years as the maximum punishment. For drunkenness, the
first ofl'ence was dealt with by public admonition, and hard
labour aftey subsequent convictions. The enactments against
tattooing and other former customs were repealed, leaving
persons to act as they pleased in matters not injuring their
neighbours.

For executing the laws many magistrates or judges were
appointed, there being two, at least, for each district, besides
seven supreme judges for Tahiti, and two for Eimeo. Juries
were to consist of six persons, peers of the accused. Many
of the articles were agreed to after considerable discussion,
the most protracted of the debates being that on the question
of capital punishment for murder. The question lay between
punishment by death or perpetual banishment to some
uninhabited island, the latter alternative being adopted
unanimously. It is this debate that we are going to report,
as showing the intelligence and earnestness, the good sense
and good feeling, displayed forty years ago by these untutored
natives of the South Sea Islands.

Before giving the summary of the debate, as recorded by
Messrs. Tyerman and Bennett, who were'present during the
two days over which it extended, let us recall a somewhat
analogous state of affairs which might have been witnessed in
a European assembly, equally without previous experience in
parliamentary procedure.

In the course of the great continental war of the early part
of this century, Sicily fell into the hands of the English, and
-without any previous political education or preparation for
liberty was placed under a constitution modelled after that
of Great Britain. " No words," says a traveller, " can describe
the scenes which daily occurred upon the introduction of the
representative system into Sicily. The House of Parliament,
neither moderated by discretion nor conducted with dignity,
bore the resemblance of a receptacle for lunatics, instead of a
council for legislators, and the disgraceful scenes so often seen
at the hustings in England were here transferred to the floor
of the Senate. The president's voice was unheeded and
unheard; the whole House at times rose; partisans of
different antagonists mingled in the fray, when the ground
was literally covered with combatants, kicking, biting, and
scratching. Such a state of things could not last; indeed,
this constitutional synod was dissolved the very first year of
its creation, and martial law established."

Similar scenes would probably be witnessed in an Irish
parliament, under Home Rule! What caused the congress in
Tahiti to present so totally different an aspect, and display so
different a spirit? It was because many of the chiefs and
people were truly Christian men, whose character was
ennobled, and whose conduct was regulated by the truths
and the spirit of the Gospel. In the whole proceedings of
that assembly there was a propriety and earnestness that
might put to shame even our own parliament in some of its
debates.
On the question being proposed, whether exile for life to a
desolate island should be the penalty on conviction for murder,
Hitoti, the principal chief of Pape, stood up, and, bowing to
the president and the assembly, said : "No doubt this is a good
law; but a thought has been growing in my heart for several
days,vand when you have heard my little speech you will
understand what it is. The laws of England, from which
country we have received so much good of every kind, must
they not be good? And do not the laws of England punish
murderers by death? Now, my thought is that as England
does so it would be well for us to do so. That is my thought."

Perfect silence followed this short but earnestly spoken
address. And it may be observed here that, throughout the
whole eight days' meetings of this assembly, in no instance
were two speakers on their legs at once ; there was not an
angry word uttered by one against another, nor did any
assume the possession of more wisdom or authority, than the
rest. In fact, none controverted the opinion of a previous
speaker, or even commented on it, without some respectful
commendation of what seemed praiseworthy in it, while, for
reasons which he modestly but manfully assigned, he deemed
another sentiment better.

After looking round to see whether anybody were already
up before him, Utami, the principal chief of Buanaauia, rose
and thus addressed the president: "The chief of Pape has
said well that we have received a great many good things from
the kind Christian people of England. Indeed, what have we
not received from Beretane ? Did they not send us the true
gospel ?--But does not Hitoti's speech go too far? If we take
the laws of England for our guide, then must we not punish
with death those who break into a house ?--those who write a
wrong name ?--those who steal a sheep ? And will any man
in Tahiti say that death should grow for these ?--No, no ; this
goes too far; so I think we should stop. The law, as it is
written, I think is good ,- perhaps I am wrong ; but that is my
thought."
After a moment or two of stillness,- Upuparu, a noble,
intelligent, and stately chief, stood forth. It was a pleasure to
look upon his animated countenance and frank demeanour,
without the smallest afiectation either of superiority or con-
descension. He paid several graceful compliments to the
former speakers, while, according to his thought, in some
.things each was right, and each was wrong. "My brother,
Hitoti,- who proposed that we should punish murder with
death because England does so, was wrong, as has been shown
by Utami. For they are not the laws of England which are to
guide us, though they are good ;--the Bible is our perfect
guide. Now, Mitti T rutu (the Missionary Crook) was preach-
ing to us on (naming the day) from the Scripture, 'He that
sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed '; and
he told us that this was the reason of the law of England. My
thought, therefore, is not with Utami, but with Hitoti (though
not because the law of England, but because the Bible, orders
it), that we ought to punish with death every one found "guilty
of murder."

There was a lively exchange of looks all through the assem-
bly, as if each had been deeply struck with the sentiments of
the speaker, especially when he placed the ground of the
punishment of death, not upon English precedent, but Scrip-
ture authority. Another chief followed, and " rising, seemed
a pillar of state," one whose aspect, and presence, and costume
of dress (richly native) made the spectators forget even him
who had just sat down. His name was Tati; and on him all
eyes were immediately and intensely fixed, while, with not less
simplicity and deference to others than those who had preceded
him, he spoke thus : " Perhaps some of you may be surprised
that I, who am the first chief here, and next to the royal
family, should have held my peace so long. I wished to hear
what my brethren would say, that I might gather what thoughts
had grown in their breasts on this great question. I am glad
that I waited, because some thoughts are now growing in my
own breast which I did not bring with me. The chiefs, who
have spoken before me, have spoken Well. But is not the
speech of Upuparu like that of his brother Hitoti--in this way ?
If we cannot follow the laws of England in all things, as
Hitoti's thoughts would perhaps lead us, because they go too
far,--must we not stop short of Upuparu, because his thought
goes too far likewise? The Bible, he says, is our perfect
guide. It is. But what does that Scripture mean, 'He that
sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed'?
Does not this go so far that We cannot follow it to the end, any
more than we can follow the laws of England all the way ?
I am Tati ; Iam a judge; a man is convicted before me; he
has shed blood; I order him to be put to death; [shed his
blood; then who shall shed mine? Here, because I cannot
go so far, I must stop. This cannot be the meaning of those
words. But, perhaps, since many of the laws of the Old
Testament were thrown down by the Lord Jesus Christ, and
only some kept standing upright,--perhaps, I say, this is one
of those which were thrown down. However, as I am igno-
rant, someone else will show me that, in the New Testament,
our Saviour, or His apostles, have said the same thing concern-
ing him that sheddeth man's blood as is said in the Old Testa-
ment. Show me this in the New Testament, and then it must
be our guide."

Much cordial approbation was evident at the conclusion of
Tati's speech, and its evangelical appeal seemed to remove
some difficulty and doubt respecting the true Scriptural autho-
rity applicable to the case.

Next rose Pati, a chief and a judge of Eimeo, formerlya
high priest of Oro, and the first who, at the hazard of his life,
had abjured idolatry. " My breast," he exclaimed, " is full of
thought and surprise and delight. When I look round at this
fare bare ra (house of prayer) in which we are assembled, and
consider who we are that take sweet counsel together here, it
is to me all mea hum e (a thing of amazement), and mea faa
oaoa te mm (a thing that makes glad my heart). Tati has
settled the question ; for is it not the gospel that is our guide ?
and who can find directions for putting to death ? I know
many passages which forbid, but I know not one which com-
mands, to kill. But then another thought is growing in my
breast, and, if you will hearken to my little speech, you shall
know what it is. Laws to punish those that commit crime are
good for us. But tell me, why do Christians punish ? Is it
because we are angry, and have pleasure in causing pain ? Is
it because we love revenge, as we did when we were heathens?
None of these: Christians do not love revenge; Christians
must not be angry ; they cannot have pleasure in causing pain.
Christians do not, therefore, punish for these. Is it not that,
by the suffering which is inflicted, we may prevent the criminal
from repeating his crime, and frighten others from doing as he
has done to deserve the like ? Well then, does not everybody
know that it would be a greater punishment to be banished
for ever from Tahiti, to a desolate island, than just, in a
moment, to be put to death 2' And could the banished man
commit murder again there 1' And would not others be more
frightened by such a sentence than by one to take away his
life? So my thought is that Tati is right, and the law had
best remain as it has been written."

One of the taata n'z', or little men, a commoner, or represen-
tative of a district, now presented himself, and was listened to
with as much attention as had been given to the lordly per-
sonages who preceded him. He said : " As no one else stands
up, I will make my little speech, because several thoughts
have been growing in my breast, and Iwish you to hear them.
Perhaps everything good and necessary has been said already
by the chiefs; yet, as we are not met to adopt this law or that
law because one great man or another recommends it, but as
we, the taata riz' just the same as the chiefs, are to throw all
our thoughts together, that out of the whole heap the meeting
may make those to stand upright which are best, whencesoever
they come--this is my thought. All that Tati said was good ;
but he did not mention that one reason for punishing (as a
Missionary told us when he was reading the law to us in pri-IIO Origin of Me Gz'psz'es.

vate) is to make the offender good again if possible. Now, if
we kill a murderer, how,can we make him better ? But if he
be sent to a desolate island, where he is all solitary, and com-_
pelled to think for himself, it may please God to make the bad
things in his heart to die, and good things to grow there. But,
if we kill him, where will his soul go ?"

Others spoke to the same purport, and, in the result, it was
unanimously 'determined that banishment, not death, should be
inflicted on murderers. It followed, of courSe, that the extreme
exercise of magisterial power, to take away life, was excluded
from every other case.

ORIGIN OF THE GIPSIES.

WITH SPECIAL ACCOUNT OF A SCOTTISH COLONY OF THEM.

T the beginning of the reign of Queen Victoria it was
estimated that the gipsies in Great Britain numbered
about 18,000. In all Europe, it is supposed there were not
fewer than 700,000 at that period. There were few or none
then in the New World, but they have since found their way
to the United States of America. Everywhere they have
always retained peculiar and well-marked characteristics,
easily recognized, and distinguishing them from the people
of the countries where they wander and reside.

Where did these people come from? Many opinions have
been held, and many theories propounded, and not a few
books written, in reply to this question. After all that has
been said on the subject, those who maintain their Indian
origin have much the strongest proofs on their side. There are
no authentic records or historical documents to appeal to, but
taking the evidence arising out of the appearance of the
people, their habits and customs, their superstitions, and,
above all, their language, there is little doubt of their having
originally emigrated from the far East. 'Orzgz'n qf Me szsz'es. III

The notion that they are descendants of Israel is wholly
untenable. There are only a few words in their language
resembling Hebrew, and they have not a ceremony peculiar to
the Hebrew race in every land. They have also few words
resembling "Coptic," and in Egypt they are deemed as
strangers to the present time, although their name seems to
indicate a connection with that country. Everywhere, in
Europe, Asia, or Africa, they use a language peculiar to
themselves ; more or less modified by that of the people among
whom they dwell. In fact, they remain, as they always have
been, a distinct race in this western world.

Although history does not reveal their origin, it states very
clearly when they first made their appearance in Europe.
About 1410 they were first seen in southern and central
Germany; in 1418 they were found in Switzerland; in Italy
they are mentioned in 1422; and in France in 1427. In the
reign of Henry VIII., from Statutes passed against them, they
must have been for some time in England, although the time
of their coming is unrecorded. It is remarkable that in the
earliest notices of them, when they were in Europe, they are
spoken of as black, especially the women, and they evidently
were of darker hue then than now, an additional evidence of
their Indian origin, before their complexion was affected by
the climate and life of the countries to which they had migrated.

All these facts point to the conclusion, which has been' a
current belief for many generations, that these people were
Asiatic Indians, driven from Hindostan in consequence of the
terrible persecution of Timur Beg, or Tamerlane, the Tartar
invader, who, in I408 and 1409, ravaged the Indian peninsula,
and put to the sword hundreds of thousands of the inhabitants.
It is rational to suppose that numbers of those who escaped
from these hordes of ruthless invaders should seek to save
their lives by flying from their native land, to become wander-
ing strangers in other countries. The Brahmins and other
higher castes would sooner die than go into exile, and many of
the Indian chiefs and people were able to make terms with
their Mohammedan conquerors. But the outcast Sudres were
a poor and degraded people, looked on as the basest of the
human race; and with ferocious troops seeking their destruc--
tion, they had every motive to leave, and none to stay in
Hindostan. They fled to save their own lives and the lives of
those dear to 'them.

By what track the ancestors of the gipsies found their way
to Europe we cannot determine. But it may be presumed
that they passed over the southern Persian deserts, and along
the Persian Gulf to the mouth of the Euphrates, thence to

, Bussorah, and into Arabia, and thence into Egypt. Their
appearance in Europe corresponds with the time at which the
invasion of Timur Beg would have driven them from India.

It is needless to adduce the many proofs which philology and
ethnology has accumulated in proof of the Indian origin and
associations of the race. Long lists of words have been pub-
lished, showing the identity and resemblance of gipsy words
with those of Hindostanee. Writers in different countries of
Europe have done this, and it is remarkable how many' of the
words are the same, notwithstanding the diversity of the tongue
of the countries where the comparison has been made. Two
or three incidental notices will be more to the point than
elaborate lists of words.

Bishop Heber, in his Journal, says : "On the other side of
the river " (in north-west India) " was a large encampment of
wretched tents of mats, with a number of little hackeries,
panniers, ponies, goats, etc., so like gipsies that on asking what
they were, I was not surprised to hear Abdallah say they were
gipsies ; that they were numerous in the north-west provinces,
living exactly like the gipsies in England ,- that he had seen the
same people both in Persia and Russia; and that in Persia
they spoke Hindostanee the same as here." Abdallah said
that by desire of Sir Gore Ouseley he had talked with some 'of
them when he was in Persia, and found they could understand

and answer him.
In a letter to Sir loseph' Banks, President of the Royal
Society, read to the Society of Antiquaries in London, in 1785,
Mr. Marsden speaks with certainty of " the identity of the
Gipsy or Cingari or Hindostanee language," adding " that
through the mountains of Nubia and on the plains of Roumania
these tribes have conversed for centuries in a dialect similar
to that spoken'to this day by the gipsies in England."

Lord Teignmouth once said to a young gipsy woman in Hindo-
stanee, " Tue burra tetschur," "Thou art agreat thief." She
immediately replied, " No,'I am not a thief; I live by fortune-
telling." An Indian missionary was in the house of the Rev.
James Crabb, of Southampton, when a gipsy woman was
present. After talking with her he expressed his conviction
that her people must once have knoWn well the Hindostanee
tongue.

These are sufficient instances to show the truth of the alleged
origin of the language. To argue that they are not of Indian
origin because they do not speak Hindostanee with correctness,
would be as absurd as to deny that they are natives of England
because they speak very incorrect English.

I have mentioned the name of Mr. Crabb, of Southampton,
long well known as "The Gipsies' Friend," because he was
the first who made systematic efforts to civilize and improve
them, and whose labours induced many benevolent persons to
take interest in their social and religious welfare. Much in
this way has been done since, and is still being done, notably
by Mr. George Smith, of Coalville, and others who have written
.on the condition of the gipsies, and laboured on their behalf.
But the services of Mr. Crabb, the pioneer in this good work,
deserve lasting remembrance. Froma little book published
by him in 1832, entitled " The Gipsies' Advocate," we extract
a chapter containing letters from a correspondent, a clergyman
in Scotland, giving an account'of a tribe then located in a
parish of that country. The letters are as follows :--

Kirk Yetholm, a small village in the county of Roxburgh-
shire, upon the borders of the two kingdoms of England and
Scotland, has been long known, and somewhat celebrated, as

8I 14 lee Gz'psz'es of Kirk Yetholm.

the favourite residence or head-quarters of the largest colony
in Scotland of that singular and interesting race of people the
gipsies, whose' origin is involved in so much obscurity and
doubt. It is not, perhaps, correct to say that the "muggers"
or " tinkers " of Kirk Yetholm are the pure, unmingled gipsy
race, whose forefathers, upwards of four centuries ago,
emigrated to Europe from the East. As in England, 50 also
in Scotland, from their intermixture with the natives of the
country, and with other wanderers like themselves, they are
now less distinguishable as a_ peculiar race. Still, however,
their language, their erratic and pilfering propensities, and, in
general, their dark or dusky complexion, black piercing eyes,
and Hindoo features, sufficiently betray the original of this
despised and long-neglected race. At what period they first.
settled in Kirk Yetholm I have not been able to ascertain.
The family of Fa, or Fall (a name renowned in gipsy story),
seems to have been the first, which probably was about the
beginning of the last century. Whether or not they have any
intercourse with the gipsies in other parts of the country I am
unable to say; I have at least no evidence that they have.
That they have a peculiar language is a subject on which I
have no doubt; though they themselves deny the fact, and
seem astonished at the question. Ido not mean to say that
it is a regularly formed and complete language, but they are
able to converse in words unknown to others.

I find that the slang or language used by the Kirk Yetholm
gipsies is very much the same with the language spoken by
the English and Turkish gipsies, a fact which identifies the
colony residing in Kirk Yetholm with the same people in other
parts of the world. The number of gipsies in the parish of
Yetholm is about one hundred. It would appear, however, that
the gipsy population of this place is fluctuating In 1798,
from the statistical report of the minister of the parish at that
period, there were only fifty-nine. In 1818, there were one
hundred and nine. In 1831, upwards of one hundred; and, in
a few years more, this number may be considerably diminishedT/ze szsz'es of Kirk Y et/zolm. I I 5

or increased. Their occupations are various. Two of the
families are "homers" or"'spoonmakers," who manufacture
horn into spoons; one a travelling tinker; another a travelling
cooper; the rest are " muggers," or " potters," as they prefer
being called, who carry earthenware about the country for sale.
Some of them also make baskets or besoms for sale. The
spoons fabricated by the homers are very generally used
by the poor, and farmers purchase a considerable number of
them before autumn for the use of the reapers. With the
exception of the individuals of this profession, whose occupa-
tion is better attended to at home, all the others are absent
from home, with their families, from eight to nine months in
the year.

It is needless, I suppose, to describe a gipsy tent, which is
the same in England as in Scotland. They usually prefer for
pitching their tents the least frequented parts of the country,
and where they may have some convenient shelter. It is the
business of the women to carry about and to dispose of the
articles which they have for sale. The men, in the meantime,
remain with their horses and carts, or occupy themselves in
fishing or, poaching, in both of which they show much
dexterity. Occasionally two or more families travel together.
They seldom remain longer than a few days in one place, and
Ibelieve they very rarely or never travel on the Sabbath.
They leave their head-quarters very early in spring, probably
the beginning of March, and return usually after the winter
has fairly commenced, about the end of November. _They
seem to enjoy the best of health ; and the older women of the
tribe are supposed to possess much skill in the management
of wounds and diseases. The only species of country work
in which they engage with others is that of reaping, and for
this purpose many of them return about the beginning of
autumn, to hire themselves to those farmers who will engage
them. At home they usually conduct themselves in a quiet
and peaceable manner, and their quarrels are chiefly among
themselves. These are very violent whilst they last, and the
occasion or ground of quarrel is seldom known but to them-
,selves. On these occasions especially they are addicted to
profane and dreadful imprecations. Their character for truth
and honesty does not stand high. But they have enemies
enough to proclaim their faults, and these faults, it must be
confessed, are neither few nor small.

The greater number of writers, in Scotland at least, when
speaking of or alluding to this unfortunate race, seem scarcely
able to discover expressions sufficiently strong to manifest
their abhorrence of them. This is in some respects unjust. It is
granted that they are idle, disorderly, vicious, and unrestrained ;
without almost any knowledge of religion. But it might also
be recollected that this will always be the character, more or
less, of those who live as they do--a very wandering life ; and
it becomes, therefore, the duty of society to inquire what they
can do to reclaim them from their erratic mode of life--the
grand source of almost all their vicious habits.

The gipsies are not destitute of good qualities. They have
a species of honour, so that if trusted, they will not deceive or
betray you. They are grateful for any attention that is shown
them ; so that I believe there are' few instances of those who
have treated them with kindness receiving any injury at their
hands. Many pleasing instances could be mentioned, and
several instances have come under my own observation, of
their grateful sense of favours conferred, and at any length of
time will remember an act of kindness shown to themselves or
relations. They are very sensible of the dislike which is
generally entertained against them, and would frequently
conceal the fact that they belong to a separate race: whereas,
formerly, it would appear they were rather proud of being
regarded as a peculiar tribe, and this feeling is not altogether
extinct among them.

Ido not think that the gipsies of Kirk Yetholm are. much
addicted to drunkenness. There are particular seasons and
occasions indeed when they drink to excess, and at such times
may be guilty of dreadful extravagances ; but I am not awareT/ze '62)):sz of Kirk Yet/tom 117

that there is one habitual drunkard here. A deep and dark
spirit of revenge seems to be the worst trait in their characters ;
and at their merry-makings or carousals, which are now, how--
ever, of rare occurrence, when their blood is heated with
whiskey, this revengeful spirit is most apt to exhibit itself.
Most or all of the gipsy parents have been married, I believe ;
the greater number, however, in an irregular manner. The
majority of the children have been baptised. They almost
invariably intermarry in their own tribes, and are generally
dissatisfied when this is not the case. The interior of their
houses is usually dirty, and the furniture of a very mean
description ; there are, however, some very pleasing exceptions
to this observation. You rarely find them, except when very
poor, destitute of a blazing fire, which they seem to regard,
and with reason, too, as one of the greatest comforts of life.
Most of the tribe can read ; many, however, very indifferently ;
but all of them seem very sensible of the benefits of education.
The parents generally express themselves as extremely desirous
that their children should be instructed, and they speak of
education as the only legacy which a poor man has to leave his
children. .

In Scotland, it will be remembered, that a person who
cannot read, and even write also, is rarely to be met with.
Still, however, there are many of the gipsy children not sent
regularly to school, even during those few months they remain
at home; and those of them that attend, during many months
are travelling in the country, and are extremely apt to forget
all they have been taught, and in the following winter must
probably commence the same course of instruction anew.
Generally they are remarked as clever children ; and consider-
ing the many disadvantages under which they receive instruc-
tion, the progress they make is surprising. The parents are in
general very much attached to their children. This, indeed, is
one of those features of their character which distinguish their
tribe wherever it is found. Nevertheless, so anxious are they
that their children should be instructed, that they have again
and again expressed their utmost willingness to'part with them
for this purpose, and to leave them at home during the summer
months, that they might attend school, but lament their
inability to maintain them. Most of the children have attended
the Sabbath school during their continuance at home. Latterly -
a considerable number have attended church, most of them
only occasionally; some of them, however, with exemplary
regularity. The ideas entertained generally on religious
subjects are extremely limited and erroneous. Indeed, how
can they be expected to be otherwise than deplorably ignorant
of religion, when it is considered that their education is so very
defective, and that during eight or nine months out of the
twelve they are houseless wanderers, with none to care for
them, and none to instruct them ? If we discover so much
ignorance amongst our own residents, and our own church--
going population, there is no wonder the gipsy is totally
ignorant, as in many instances he is, of the very first principles
of Christianity. Still they seem to profess a general respect
for religion. I am not aware that they entertain on this
subject any sentiments peculiar to themselves. Like all
persons whose knowledge of every substance is extremely
contracted, and who entertain a confused belief of the truth
of religion, without knowing what it really is, they are very
superstitious. Nor am I sure that their superstition differs
much from that of the ignorant in general. They believe
in apparitions and witchcraft, and in the existence of invisible
beings, capable of doing them an injury. They have also a
belief in omens. They hold it to be very ominous of evil,
before commencing _a journey, to meet with certain animals
early in the morning, or with persons possessing certain
features or deformities, and on such occasions they will unload
their carts or asses, and wait a more auspicious season for
their journey. They all profess to belong to the established
church. of Scotland. Most of them have Bibles or New Testa-
ments, or at least the tattered remains of some portions of
the Scriptures in their possession. It will be understood, of
course, that in these remarks Ispeak generally. As a proof
that they are not universally destitute even of ponderous folio
Bibles, I may mention rather an interesting fact, which occurred
during the late vacancy of the parish of Yetholm, or that
interval of time which elapsed between the death of the pre~
ceding clergyman of the parish and the appointment of his
successor. The deceased minister's family had left the parish,
and carried with them the usual pulpit Bible. It happened
that on the Sabbath following the removal of the Bible, a young
clergyman from a distance, an entire stranger in the parish,.was
appointed to officiate : it appears also that the absence of the
Bible was not discovered by the elders or church officers until
the moment almost when it was necessary that the minister
should be in the pulpit; upon this, as there was no time to
send to any distance, the elders immediately proceeded to the
' nearest cottages, to inquire if a Bible of something like orthodox
dimensions could be procured. One cottage after another was
entered, without being able to furnish what was wanted. The
next was the cottage of a gipsy. Probably they lingered before
the door, doubtful whether to enter or not. They did enter,
however, and thence returned with a folio Bible of the largest
dimensions, and with copious notes.

One circumstance in the character of the gipsies I think
ought not to be omitted. [allude to their manners. While
these in most instances are rude and uncultivated, displaying
only a bold and fearless independence, there are individuals
among them who, judging from their manners alone, might
have been bred at court. This is scarcely too exaggerated a
description. In addressing their superiors, no matter how
elevated in rank, they display the utmost self-possession, and
most perfect propriety of behaviour. They express them-
selves tolerably well, and without hesitation or awkwardness.

Perhaps there is among them too much display, but their
movements are natural and even graceful. Like a late departed
monarch, his present gipsy majesty is the most polished of all
subjects. The whole of this (royal) family indeed, male and
female, are rather remarkable for this freedom and polish of
manner. His Majesty, moreover, who is now an old man,
without any family, and who never removes from home, is
also a regular hearer at church. .

Kirk Yetholm, therefore, has some pretensions to the name,
which it has sometimes received, of the metropolis of the gipsy
kingdom in Scotland. 'It is alluded to as their favourite
residence in the following lines by Leyden :--

" On Yeta's banks the vagrant gipsies place

' Their turf-built cots, a sunburnt swarthy race ;
Through Nubian realms their tawny line they bring,
And their brown chieftain vaunts the name of king.
With loitering steps {rem town to town they pass,
Their lazy dames rocked on the panniered ass.
From pilfered roost or nauseous Carrion fed,
By hedge-rows green they strew the leafy bed.
While scarce the cloak of tawdy red conceals
Their fine-turned limbs which every breeze reveals.
Their bright black eyes through silken lashes shine,
Around their neck their raven tresses twine.
But chilling (lamps and dews of night impair
Its soft sleek gloss and tan the bosom bare.
Adroit the lines of palmistry to-trace,
Or read the damsel's wishes in her face.
Her hoarded silver store they charm away,
A pleasing debt for promised wealth to pay."

The practice alluded to in these lines is, Ibelieve, almost
totally laid aside. Kirk Yetholm I may mention is a small
'village, containing about four hundred inhabitants, and situated
a short mile from the boundary which separates the two
kingdoms of England and Scotland. The boundary here is
either a trifling stream, or more generally a mere imaginary
line.

"A river here, there an ideal line,
By fancy drawn divides the sister kingdoms ;
On each side dwells a people similar,
As twins are to each other, valiant both,
Both for their valour famous through the world."
There is another and larger village in the parish, called
Town Yetholm, perhaps one of the most beautifully-situated .
villages in Scotland. It is distant from the other less than
half a mile. They are placed on opposite sides of a valley,
through which flows a wild romantic stream, called the
"Bowmont Water." The parish lies at the foot of the
Cheviot range of mountains, is small though populous, at a con-
siderable distance from any town, peacefully secluded, and
embosomed amid pastoral hills, which are smooth and green
to the summit. The secluded situation of the parish, and the
immediate vicinity of Kirk Yetholm, more especially to Eng-
land on one side, and to the wild and pathless range of the
Cheviot on the other, may perhaps be given as reasons why
the gipsies originally chose this as their favourite haunt. If at
any time pursued by the hand of justice, it was easy, the work
of only a few minutes, to cross from the one kingdom to the
other; or if the magistrates on both sides of the border were
on the alert, the nimble-footed gipsies were soon safe from
their pursuit among the wild valleys of the neighbouring
mountains. It is very generally said that the gipsies of late
years, probably since the end of the last century, have lost
character very much. I will not inquire at present what truth
there may be in this, but if it be the case, several reasons may
be assigned for it. Many lawless and desperate characters,
not belonging to the tribe, have from time to time connected
themselves with it, andinitiated them into practices formerly
unknown among them. Their greater poverty also of late
years may be another cause of their increased immorality, and
the severe and unfceling treatment of them by society may be
regarded as a third cause of their more depraved and lawless
condition of late years. I

The gipsies are at present known as a wild and semi-
barbarous race, "whose hand is against every man's, and
every man's hand against them," who are feared and dreaded
by others, as setting all law, character, religion, and morality
at defiance, and unfortunately there is but too much truth in122 T/ze szsz'es of [(2104: Yet/PS01m.

the description. The original and fruitful source of all the
vicious habits. and unfortunate peculiarities of this tribe has
already been stated to be their loose, irregular, and wandering
mode of life, and the natural consequences of this mode of life
have been aggravated, it would appear of late years, by the
causes above mentioned.

There is nothing obviously in the native character, blood, or
constitution of the gipsy, to render him more desperate and
vicious than others. They are neither better nor worse, I
conceive, than other members of society would, be were they
placed in similar circumstances. Their wandering, for instance,
exposes them to many peculiar temptations, idleness and
rapine lead them frequently into scenes of mischief and
wickedness, and necessarily leave them ignorant, uneducated,
and uncivilized. Withdraw them, therefore, from this mode
of life, and at as early an age as possible, before they have
acquired the bad habits of the tribe, and you save them from
innumerable evils, and probably render them valuable members
of society ; and several cases fortunately can be referred to of
gipsies, who, owing to some peculiar circumstances, have been
separated from their tribe, acquiring domestic habits, residing
contentedly at home, and in no way to be distinguished from
the rest of the community: and an equal or greater number
of cases might be adduced of individuals in no way connected
with the tribe, and who in early life had been trained to
domestic habits, associating themselves with it, and acquiring
all their disorderly and vicious habits. Let society, therefore,
do their duty to these houseless wanderers, regard them not as
an outcast and infamous race, but stretching forth to them the
hand of reconciliation, say by their altered conduct, let us be
~ friends and brothers, and as the poor, and ignorant, and
immoral, let a civilized, a religious, and a benevolent society
grant to them the privileges of education, and the means of
improvement. Until this be done, they must naturally expect
to have their properties injured, and perhaps even their own
persons insecure. And they have a fine class of subjects toGarz'ea/a'z'. t/ze [la/22m Patriot and Hero. 123

Work upon ; a people who will be grateful for any attention
that is shown them, and the more so as they have been little
accustomed to kindness; and a people whose capabilities of
improvement are very great.

It is obvious that the rest of the community would be no
small gainers by a change which is here contemplated. They
would render their own homes, their persons and property,
more secure, while they would discharge a long-neglected
duty to a most interesting and unfortunate portion of their
brethren. It cannot and ought not to be said, that such an
attempt will be unsuccessful until it has been fairly tried and
failed. But by the blessing of God it will succeed. Let
Christians, uniting together, implore the divine blessing of God
on their undertaking, go forward in their great Redeemer's
name, and let them manifest how highlytheyvalue the privileges
they enjoy, by their earnest and persevering efforts to bring
these almost heathen wanderers in a British land, to share
the comforts of social life, and the inestimable blessings of
the gospel of the Son of God.

' Amidst all that has been done and said concerning the

gipsies in more recent years, these old records, preserved by
good Mr. Crabb, of Southampton, will be read with interest,
.and studied with advantage.

 

GARIBALDI, THE ITALIAN PATRIOT AND HERO.

HE name and deeds of Garibaldi will always have a
romantic interest. Few men ever had a life of more
perpetual peril and adventure, by sea and land. In his early
years it was the mere natural love of excitement that moved
him, but from the time that he was acquainted with public
events, he became, above all, a true patriot and a lover of
freedom. Born in the days of the first Emperor Napoleon, he
lived to see the fall of Napoleon III. The Italy of his child-124 Garz'ealdz', t/ze Italian Patriot mm Hero.

.hood, divided and oppressed by tyrants, domestic and foreign,
he lived to see united and free. He was one of the chief actors
in the second great revolutionary epoch of modern Europe.
Of the new kingdom of Italy he was truly one of the founders,
for without the enthusiasm which he inspired, the plans and
counsels of statesmen would have had little influence. He
was the popular idol and hero in the heroic age of young
Italy. Had he died, as Cavour died, when his main work
was accomplished, it might have been better for his future
fame. Noble in nature, generous in feeling, prompt in action,
he was also easily impressionable, and liable to be misled by
evil advisers. But the mistakes of his closing years will be
readily forgiven and forgotten in the record of the grand
events of. his earlier life, a few incidents of which I will
narrate.

Guiseppe, or Joseph Garibaldi, was born at Nice in July
1807. His father was a seaman, as his father before him had
been. Joseph took to the sea as to his native element, being

. always about the shore and the ships, and becoming a power-
ful and skilful swimmer, an. accomplishment which enabled
him to save life on various occasions. The little book-learning
that he obtained was through the influence of a worthy priest,
his mother's brother. The only subjects for which he showed
taste or aptitude were languages and mathematics, the know- '
ledge of the latter serving him in good turn when once, like
Louis Philippe and other notable men in exile and poverty, .
he had to earn his living by teaching.

Of his mother, Rosa Ragiundo, he always spoke with tender
and grateful remembrance. To her inspiration he said that he
owed his patriotic feelings. She was a devout woman also,
after her creed, and he records that "in his greatest dangers
by land or sea, his imagination conjured up the picture of a
pious woman prostrated at the feet of the Most High, inter-
ceding for her beloved son." '

When still a boy, he made several trips in his father's trading
vessel, a brig, to Rome, Odessa, and Constantinople. Hisr..\x..-u,.,.\ Mm w: .\1 1mm. u..." w
taste for naval pursuits being fixed, he entered the Sardinian
navy, and remained several years in the service. He rose to
be lieutenant, and might have become a naval captain in
command of a ship quietly cruising about in the Mediterranean.
But a more stirring career was destined for him. At Marseilles
he met with one whose name is also imperishably associated
with the story of new Italy, Joseph Mazzini. By his influence
the course of his life was changed. Mazzini was by nature
a dreamer and a schemer, and by conviction and circumstance
he became the arch-conspirator for the liberation of his country
from foreign sway. He easily gained the young and generous
Garibaldi to be a Sharer of his enthusiasm and an instrument of
his plots. At first- Mazzini planned a descent on the Italian
coast by sea, but the discovery of the scheme led to his ex-
pulsion from Marseilles. A raid upon the Savoy frontier was
then planned from Geneva, but this also proved a futile scheme,
Garibaldi ascribing the failure to treachery on the part of the
Polish General, Romorino. We next hear of him on board
the Royal frigate, Ewydz'ce, off Genoa, in hope of seizing the
vessel by raising mutiny among the crew. At this moment,
having heard of a plot to storm the barracks of the Carbineers,
he went on shore to join in the attack, but the attempt mis-
carrying, he found himself irreparably compromised. Not
daring to go back to his ship, he fled to Nice, and thence across
the frontier, taking refuge as an exile at Marseilles. At this
great seaport it was easy for him to obtain employment. He
went one voyage to the Black Sea, another to Tunis, where he
even entered the service of the Bey, but soon tiring of this, he
sailed in the Nageur, a vessel of Nantes, for Rio Janeiro. This
was in 1836, when only in his twentieth year.

South America was a region well suited for the restless and
adventurous spirit of the young exile now landed on its shores. _
The Wars of Independence were over, and the conflicts
between the parent states of Europe and their colonies ended,
but had been succeeded by fiercer fights and more lasting
enmities than those which had marked the struggles for free-
dom. Garibaldi was soon drawn into the strife. He took
service with the Republic of Rio Grande do Sul, a vast territory
belonging to Brazil, but then in rebellion against that empire.
Probably it Was the mere name of Republic that attracted him
to take the side of rebellion, for he could know nothing of the
rights of the contest. We suppose this from the fact of -his
giving the name of "Mazzini" to a small privateering boat,
with a crew of twelve men, of which he took the command.
By aid of this he soon took possession of a larger and better
armed vessel, his first prize seized from the enemy.

In the months which followed, he had a succession of hair-
brained adventures and hair-breadth escapes, sometimes
victorious against incredible odds, winning battles, storming
fortresses, and keeping the Brazilian government in perpetual
panic by his raids both on sea and land.

It was at this period that he first formed a band of irregulars,
drawn to him and kept to his standard by personal admiration
and attachment. Most of these were countrymen of his own,
Italian exiles or emigrants. There was little of military
discipline or stern rule, but the courage and endurance, the
clemency and disinterestedness of the chief inspired all the
band with sympathetic fidelity and daring. This was the
origin of Garibaldi's Italian legion, which reappeared with
fresh life at various periods of his career.

The Imperial resources of Brazil at length proved too
powerful for the struggle to be successfully maintained. On '
one occasion, being severely wounded, Garibaldi fell into the
hands of a Spaniard, who treated him with brutal cruelty, and
he escaped death only by the intervention of the Governor of
the district.

At a later time his little flotilla of armed boats was overtaken
by a hurricane, and he landed on the coast of Santa Caterina,
wrecked and forlorn, having seen the bravest and best of his
men shot down or drowned, and the means of further
resistance no more to be found.

It was at a season of depression and disaster, when his
fortune seemed at the lowest ebb, that he fell in with his
Anita, who became his devoted wife, and his faithful companion ,
amidst all the troubles and vicissitudes of his career, till parted
by her death in the sadly tragic manner to be presently described
This was not the first kind womanly heart that had pitied and
comforted the young Italian. He tells with gratitude how,
when thrown into a dungeon by the cruel Spaniard, when
wounded and a prisoner, his life was saved and his sorrows
soothed by the gentle ministrations of a good angel of charity,
by name Madame Alleman. Now, in Anita he had such a
helper and comforter always at his side, a woman as brave
and enduring as she was gentle and tender. After the birth
of her firstborn, Menotti Garibaldi, in September 1840, she
went through all the perils and hardships of the closing scenes
of that war, with the infant and his father. The sight of her
sufferings, and the hopelessness of altering the fortune of an
ill-conducted contest, led him to take leave of his Republican
friends of Rio Grande, and he went, for a short interval in his
adventurous career, to live at Montevideo. Here he gained a
living for himself and loved ones by teaching mathematics,
and by the business.of a general broker--employment little
to his taste.

At this time war broke out between the Republic of Uruguay
and Buenos Ayres. As he had received'the hospitable pro-
tection of the former State, he felt in honour bound to adopt her
cause when appealed to. His reputation for skill and daring
being well known, he was offered the command of the fleet
of the young Republic, an absurdly imposing offer, for they
had only a few small fishing boats on the river Parana.
Garibaldi made the best of the circumstances; if he had not a
fleet he would find one. Setting out in the night, with
muffled oars, he entered a creek where an armed sloop of the
enemy was at anchor. He boarded and captured her, with
the whole crew, without any loss, as they were surprised by
the sudden attack. A second vessel fell into his hands after a
sharp engagement. He was then urged by persons high in
power in the Montevidean government to make an expedition
against the still strong fleet of Buenos Ayres, in the Parana
river. The afi'air seemed so desperate, that it has been not
without reason asserted that the object of the planners was to
get rid of Garibaldi by exposing him to certain danger, they
being jealous of his rising. fame and influence. He made the
best of his desperate position, and escaped from this conflict,
not only with his life, but also "with honour, the only
thing that was not lost." There being no longer hope 0!
success by sea, Garibaldi organized another Italian legion,
numbering three or four hundred men. This band performed
deeds of wonderful daring, and rose to such distinction that, as
a mark of honour, they were allowed precedence over all the
other troops of the Republic.

At the close of its exploits grants of land were made to the
survivors, but they refused them, at least Garibaldi in their
name refused, saying that " the triumph of the Republican
cause was the sole stimulus of their exertions." This reply
shows the disinterested spirit of the man, but we think the
men of the legion deserved all the reward that they could get
for their heroic bravery and willing endurance in long and
diflicult contests. Their hundreds had almost always to
contend with as many thousands, as was literally the case in
more than one battle where the opposing forces Were under
General Rosas.

On one occasion Rosas advanced near Montevideo, having
three thousand troops. Garibaldi had three hundred, about
two hundred having been despatched by him to the neighbour-
hood of Montevideo, for the protection of his wife, whose
safety was threatened by this invasion. The fight was
maintained long against fearful odds. The legion succeeded
in piercing the centre of Rosas' force, and dividing them into
two. Anita at this moment coming up with the two hundred
men, attracted by the firing, fell suddenly on the left division

. of the army of Rosas, who little knew the small number of the
. assailants, and fled in confusion. Next day Garibaldi attacked
the right suddenly at Las--Tres-Croces (The Three Crosses), and
drove them back. The camp at Bayada was carried the same
night by a sudden assault, and Garibaldi returned next day
with his beloved wife to Montevideo.

Her heroism on this occasion endeared her more than ever
to her husband, to whom she was soon again to present a son.
The child was born slightly lame, in consequence of the terrible
fatigues and exertions of those days and nights.

It was, doubtless, the remembrance of that time of anxiety
in his young married life that added intensity to the grief
and implacable indignation against the Austrians, who in after
years brought premature death to his Anita, when in a similar
condition.

All through her life she shared the perils and adventures of
her noble husband. At times, when left alone, she displayed
the same undaunted spirit. More than under the excitement
of the journeys or the battlefield, this cool courage was re-
markable when she remained in charge of the farmhouse near
Montevideo. The worst danger she then incurred was not
from the enemy's attacks, but from the invasion of an armed
band of mutineers, whose pay from the Republic was in
arrears, and who, on finding Garibaldi absent, threatened
to kill the wife and her children. By her coolness and
tact she turned them from their rage, and sent them away
full of admiration for her, and of hope that their grievances
would be redressed.

On one occasion both husband and wife had a narrow
escape. Rosas was eager to obtain possession of a foe so
troublesome, and hearing that Garibaldi wasthen at his home,
he made a sudden inroad into Uruguay, in hope of surprising
him. On reaching the house unobserved, the cry arose, " He
is taken." ." Not yet," he replied, as he ran out and threw
himself into a skiff at the bottom of his garden, whence he
hurriedly pushed off into the stream. His pursuers got a boat
as quickly as possible, but he had a good start, and, eluding
their chase, he shortly afterwards arrived at Montevideo,

9
where his wife and children had fortunately preceded him a
few days before.

The story of the conflicts of these South American wars
would be a narrative of_'romantic interest, so far as personal
adventures are concerned, but the wars themselves are not
worthy of detailed record. As Milton said of our own conflicts in
the days of the Saxon Heptarchy, they have no.more interest
for living men now than ." the struggles. of kites and crows"!
The rude guerilla warfare of Garibaldi's early life in the
western world has importance now chiefly because he'there
was trained for the exploits on the larger and loftier field of
European conflict. In his own native land he was soon to
display. the same dauntless courage, the same fertility of
.resourcc, and the same magnetic influence on the minds
of others which had made him the hero of Montevideo.

Two other incidents only we mention,'as showing his
cleverness and his audacity in irregular war. He was equally
ready in resource by sea as by land, and it was there that some
of his most adventurous deeds were witnessed. . On one
occasion, at night, he had the ingenuity to make two of the
enemy's vessels assail each other, to their irreparable injury.
Steering his light vessel boldly down between them, he sud-
denly, by means of a pair of long sweeps, arrested and backed
his course, after delivering a broadside at each, leaving them
in the surprise and darkness of the night furiously firing at
each other, till the stratagem was understood.

His last encounter at sea was one of the most daring and
decisive. With two small vessels he encountered three of
superior force, which Rosas sent 'to attack when the others -
were in port. Garibaldi, beating to quarters, ordered his '
crews to reserve their' fire till within musket shot. A well-
directed broadside at so short a range had deadly effect, and
staggered the assailants. Another broadside was then coolly
ordered 'by Garibaldi to be aimed at the rigging, and masts
and'sails came down by the board. In the confusion he then

grappled with the enemy's ships, and boarded them, he
leading the onset, cutlass in hand. In less than twenty
minutes he drew the three ships into port. .

One of them afterwards escaped, but was recovered by a
singular stroke of audacity. He followed her in a swift fishing
boat to reconnoitre her, and see if she was much damaged
during the fight, as he thought she had been. They pursued
him when far from land, and his boat grounded when re-
turning to shore. He managed to escape by swimming to land,
dragging the boat. It was night by this time, and he ordered
hismen to take the boat for a considerable distance along the
coast, whence he again pushed off and gained the sea-board of
the enemy. The crew of the ship were asleep, and utterly
unprepared for the new assault, when Garibaldi and his men
quickly cleared the deck with their cutlasses. Most of the
crew were below, and surrendered. At daylight Garibaldi
returned with the vessel into harbour, mooring it alongside of
its companions already captured. Such was a specimen of
the mingled stratagem and audacity of the man. . He was now
to appear on a field worthier of his name.

News came from Europe which thrilled the hearts of
Italian patriots, whether emigrants or exiles, in the New
World. Changes had ftaken place which altered the whole
condition and prospects of their native land. There was a.
new Pope, Pius IX., who at first professed himself to be
patriotic and liberal. In France a Republic had been pro-
claimed, after the flight of the Orleans king, Louis Philippe.
There was a wave of revolution rolling over the whole of the
continent, and constitutions, or promises of them, were being
wrested from the reluctant despots of old dynasties. " After
me the deluge," Metternich used to say, but it had come in his
time. Austria was convulsed with insurrectionary move-
ments. With its enormous army and impregnable fortresses,
it could still keep firm hold of its Italian provinces, but these
could no longer remain tamely submissive. When Naples
was preparing to resist the brutal tyranny of its Bourbon king,
and Sicily had risen in open and successful revolt, northern
Italy was ripe for insurrection against the Austrian yoke. The
Milanese drove the garrison under Marshal Radetzky from
their city, after five days' continuous fighting, and throughout
all Lombardy the people were preparing to strike for freedom
and independence. A party of Austrian cavalry and Hun-
garian artillery, on their way from Pavia to-Milan, with six
pieces of cannon, were attacked by the populace at Binasco:
The Austrians fled, but the Hungarians cried " Vive l'Italia,"
and joined the insurgents.

It was time for the King of Sardinia to declare himself.
Charles Albert must either' lead the movement, or himself be
removed by the national leaders. He proclaimed war against
Austria, and then Venice and all the territories so long held in
bondage by the House of Hapsburg were united in a common
cause, and, so far as Austria was concerned, the independence
of Italy was no longer a dream of patriots and poets.

Such was the state of affairs while Garibaldi was yet in
far-ofl' Uruguay. The struggle for independence had begun,
but Italy had yet to see years of conflict, and to pass through
many trials and disappointments before the final triumph.

All these movements were becoming known to the Italian
exiles throughout the world. Garibaldi had early heard
rumours of the Pope's liberal professions, and as far back as
October J7th, 1847, he wrote a letter from Montevideo to
the Nuncio Bedini, ofl'ering to his Holiness his services, with
his comrades of the Italian legion of South America, in case of
war with Austria being resolved upon. The letter was referred
to the Pontifical Government at Rome. But Garibaldi, after
waiting in vain for a reply from Nuncio or Pope, could no
longer brook suspense or delay. With immense difficulty he
gathered suflicient means to enable him to sail for Europe,
along with his brave friend Anzani, having with them eighty-
five' men and two cannon, leaving the remainder of his legion'
to follow how and when it could.

He reached Nice in July 1848, and hastening to Genoa and
Milan, learned the 'true position of affairs. His ofl'er of services
to Charles Albert was received coldly, owing to his supposed
sympathies with the irreconcilable republicanism of Mazzini.
The truth was, that after being defeated at Mortara and Cus-
tozza, Charles Albert had lost all hope of successful insurrection,
and had accepted an armistice, which saved Piedmont from
invasion.

There was still a provisional government at Milan, to which
Garibaldi transferred his offer of service, and placed himself
at the disposal of Mazzini.

A proclamation was issued, declaring the king a traitor to
the cause of Italian independence, and announcing that "the
royal war was at an end, and that of the people was now to
begin." This Mazzinian proclamation was little better than
idle bravado. With small and dispirited bands of guerilla
troops success was hopeless. After maintaining for some
time a gallant but unavailing struggle in the mountains,
Garibaldi crossed the frontier into Switzerland, where already
many of his men had found refuge. _

A new turn of events called him back to Italy. Pius the
Ninth had begun to throw off his cloak of pretended
liberalism, and his popularity had departed. Pressed hard by
his disafiectcd subjects, who assassinated his minister, Rossi,
as the supposed cause of his withholding constitutional rights,
and being himself threatened in his palace at the Quirinal, the
Pope fled to Gaeta. A Roman Republic was proclaimed, with
a Triumvirate at its head, Mazzini being the leading spirit.
A brief gleam of glory rests on this episode of Roman history.
The people used their triumph with the utmost moderation,
and there was every prospect of peaceful and orderly rule.
But a cloud rose in an- unexpected quarter of the political
horizon, and the sky of hopeful promise was speedily overcast.

The French Government, although itself Republican, main-
tained towards the sister Republic of Rome an ambiguous
policy. Even Cavaignac had been induced to send succour
to the Pope, and when Louis Napoleon succeeded to the
Presidency he declared his hostility in the strongest manner,
. in the hope, probably, of gaining the support of the clerical
party in France to his own selfish interests. It was a cruel
and disgraceful business, French troops sent to join with
the mercenaries of the King of Naples to suppress the Roman
Republic and restore the Papal tyranny.

Now was the time for Garibaldi to reappear on the
scene. His- exploits at this crisis were full of daring, but
could ayail only to delay the catastrophe. He drove back
the French from Porta Pancrazio, in the last days of April
1849. The Neapolitan army was routed in the campaign
of Velletri, with a rapidity which astonished and amused
all Europe. But this was like the farce preceding the
tragic drama that was to be witnessed at Rome. The French
army had been reinforced, and appeared before the eternal
city with power and determination to take possession at
all hazard and loss. The General, Oudinot, was instructed
to proclaim that he came as the friend, not the foe, of the
Roman people, and that his only object was to save the
city from anarchy.

The Triumvirs hesitated until the French shells fell round
. St. Peter's, and even lodged in the library of the Vatican.
Mazzini, with his love of learning and taste for art, fearing
probably the reproach of allowing the treasures of the city
to be destroyed, felt inclined to come to terms. But Garibaldi
was determined to resist to the last, and the people were
with him. The details of the gallant defence throughout a
three months' siege, with occasional sorties, when heavy
losses were inflicted on the besiegers, -it is needless now
to relate. On the I 3th of July, 1849, the French entered the
city as conquerors, having first threatened to lay St. Peter's
and all the historic monuments of the place in ruins. " Let
them perish," said Garibaldi, " rather than independence and
freedom be lost." But Mazzini consented to sign terms of
capitulation. While the French troops .were entering the
-city in one direction, with triumphant martial music, Gari-
baldi, with his band of devoted volunteers, sorrowfully marched
out at the other side, towards Terracina. A French officer,

with a strong body of troops, presented himself before the
I Constituent Assembly, then presided over' by the Prince
of Canino, a Buonaparte, and summoning them to disperse,
the Republic was at an end.

General Oudinot, on receiving the keys of Rome, sent
one of his officers to lay them at the feet of the Holy Father,
and at the same time sent a division of his troops in pursuit
of Garibaldi. These were kept at bay for some time, and
defeated at Turin, Orvieto, and other places; but the heroic
chief, with his diminished band, had to cross the Apennines,
retiring before overwhelming odds. New foes here awaited
him. The Austrians were in large force ready for his de-
struction. He sought a brief respite in the small republic
of San Marino, but no respect was paid to the rights of
this puny state by his relentless pursuers. He reached the
shore, in hope of finding some way of reaching Venice,
which still was resisting the Austrian siege, but some
Austrian 'ships in the offing hindered the attempt. By his
request, those of his followers who still adhered to his for-
tunes, however desperate, dispersed for their own safety.
Some of .his nearest friends, including Ugo Bassi and Ciceru-
acchi, falling into the hands of the Austrians, were shot by
them, without any form of trial, not even a military court
martial, an act of wicked and wanton barbarism.

It was at this time that Garibaldi lost the loving and
faithful partner of his life. While making her way along
the banks of a small stream near Chioggio, in the territory
of Ravenna, she was seized with the pangs of labour.
Mother and child perished in that lone place, unaided in
that sad hour; and after hastily interring them, the husband
again set out,. an utterly grief-stricken man.

Meeting here and there with a few friends, they had to
assume disguises and adopt many stratagems to elude their
bloodthirsty pursuers. For some weeks he wandered among
the forests and ravines of the Apennines, sleeping by day
and moving by night. At last, wearied and worn out, having
crossed from the Adriatic to the Mediterranean, he was
found, with a single attendant, by some carbineers of the
Sardinian army. They took him to Nice, when the people,
on hearing who was the prisoner, received him with accla-
mation. He was permitted to see his children, two sons
and a daughter, and a few of his friends. The rumour of
his being in the city disturbed the authorities, who became
quickly anxious to get rid of him. 'They sent him to Genoa,
where La Marmora was in command. The veteran general
treated the fugitive with honourable respect, and letters,
which were long afterwards published in the Italian journals,
prove that already between these two brave men there had
sprung up the warmest mutual esteem and sympathy. La
Marmora supplied him with ample means for his going to
Tunis,' where he was willing to take refuge, obtaining also
a pension for him from the Turin Government, who were
no doubt glad thus to rid themselves of a troublesome guest.

There was no more at the time for Garibaldi to do in
the cause of Italian independence. Charles Albert had resigned
' in favour of his son, Victor Emanuel, who had the will,
but not yet the power, to gain his country's freedom. The dis-
astrous defeat at Novara closed the prospect for that period.
Venice had capitulated after heroic resistance, and the whole
' of northern Italy was again under the hated power of the
Austrians. .

In a letter to a friend, on the eve of his departure for
Tunis, Garibaldi wrote: "I sail to morrow on board the
T npolz', for Tunis. I have seen what you and your generous
colleagues have done for me. I charge you to express my
gratitude to them. -I have no reason to complain of any
one. I believe we live in times in which resignation is
necessary, for we are in times of bitterness. Remember
me to all the brave defenders of the Italian cause."

Tunis afforded him no lasting resting--place. The relent--
less hostility of those who feared him followed him there.
He-was too near the theatre of his past efforts, and his

name might keep alive the desire for insurreCtion. He must

leave the shores of the Mediterranean, and become an exile

again across the Atlantic. He went this time to the United

States, where he expected among Republicans to find hospi-
_ tality and sympathy.

It would be painful to give details of the life of the hero of
Italian independence, when a refugee in the United States.
Few took any notice of the illustrious exile. For some time
he gained his living as a chandler o; candle-maker on Staten
Island, near New York. When his place of residence became
known, vile agents, at the instigation of despotic governments,
followed him with insults, hoping probably to incite him to
violence. He had to move about armed to protect his life.
One of his persecutors is said to have been a lawyer, whom
the chances of political life afterwards lifted to notoriety at
Washington, and who was even sent as ambassador to a
European court. Garibaldi felt the annoyance so much as to
leave his retreat, at the sacrifice of his little property, and he
returned to his former haunts in South America. Finding
no suitable employment there, he became sailor again, and
once actually carried coals from Newcastle to Genoa. By
intercession of friends he was allowed to remain on this side
of the Atlantic, and went to Caprera, a small island near the
Sardinian coast, when he settled down as a farmer, in a home
where many English .visitors saw him in his later peaceful
years. There was yet, however, to be a stormy interval of
war, and work in fields more in'accordance with his impetuous
spirit and his early fame. ' -

On the Ist of January, 1859, at the usual reception of the
ambassadors in the Tuilleries by Louis Napoleon, all Europe
was thrown into excitement and alarm. It was the custom of
this Imperial personage to utter words on this annual ceremony,
not impromptu, but deeply planned by his advisers. It is as-
serted by those best qualified to judge that these utterances were
for the most part made with financial rather than political pur-
pose; at all events, it came to pass that -the funds on every Stock
Exchange in Europe rose or fell according to the report, flashed
by the electric wires, of what Louis Napoleon said on New
Year's day at the Tuilleries.

On this occasion there was more perceived than words to
make money on the Stock Exchange. "I regret," he said to
the Austrian ambassador, "that my relations with your
government are not so amicable as I could have wished." The
phrase, hOWever ambiguous, convinced the diplomatists that
war was intended. Vague declarations in the official Mom'teur
kept the event in doubt, but preparations for war were going
on quietly and unceasingly. Sardinia was arming as well
> as France, and the Austrian government knew what this meant.
The Sardinians were informed that continued preparation
would be regarded as a menace,.and; in fact, a declaration of
war. The 'English foreign minister, Lord Malmesbury, induced
the Austrian emperor to restrain hostilities for a week, and in
the interval the French troops were already crossing the Alps,
or steaming for Genoa. ,

.A revolption in Tuscany preceded more important events.
A popular demonstration in Florence, designed apparently to
three the Grand Duke Leopold to declare himself openly on
the side of Italy, led to the retirement of that prince to .Elba.
Victor Emanuel, of Piedmont, was then,declared Dictator, and
the army unfurled the Italian tricolour flag. Parma, Modena,
and other principalities followed the example of Tuscany, and
the Austrian rulers had to retire from all places not under the
guns of the great fortresses of the army of occupation.

Louis Napoleon, who had issued a rhetorical proclamation
before quitting Paris, addressed another 'on his arrival at
' Genoa to the army of Italy. ' It thus began : " Soldiers, 1 come

to-place myself at your head to conduct you to the combat. _ We

are about to second the struggles of a people now vindicating
its independence, and to rescue it from foreign oppression.

This is a sacred cause, which has the sympathies of the
_ civilized world. I need not stimulate your ardour. Every
step will remind you of a victory." In the Via Sacra of ancient
Rome inscriptions were chiselled in marble reminding the
people of their exalted deeds. It is the same to-day. In
passing Mondovi, Marengo, Lodi, Castiglione, Arcole, and
Rivoli, you will, in the midst of these glorious recollections,
be marching in anothing Via Sacra. The proclamation thus
concluded: "The new army of Italy will be worthy of her
elder sister 1" ' "

The interference of Lord Malmesbury, perhaps well meant,
but certainly mischievous, prevented Austria from meeting the
French before they arrived on Italian soil. They had thus time to
take up good positions on the plains of Piedmont, instead of
being assailed amidst the passes of the Alps. It is not our
purpose to give any narrative of the FranCO-Austrian war, nor
of those campaigns of which the battles of Magenta and of
Solferi'no formed the crowning events. The Austrian armies
were overmatched by the French troops headed by their most
experienced generals, and with the whole population of
northern Italy in insurrection. '

After Solferino, when there was enormous slaughter on
both sides, the abrupt termination of hostilities caused surprise
everywhere. When victories such as were jubilantly cele-
brated in Paris had been gained, it seemed strange that the
conqueror should not follow up his advantages. But Louis
Napdleon had gained all that he wanted. He had brought new
glory to the French army, and had himself appeared as a
successful general. He had posed as a friend of Italian liberty
and independence, and had riSked enough to justify his claim
for the Italian maritime provinces to be annexed to France as
the price of his assistance I '

In addressing their own serfs and senates the French and
Austrian Emperors represented the cessation of- hostilities to
have been the result of foreign intervention. But there was
no truth in this statement. The real fact is, that the French
ruler had gained all that he went to war for, and he might
have broken his power in the attempt to attack the yet un-
threatened Quadrilateral and other Austrian strongholds. Let
us believe, in accordance with his early associations, that he was
sincere in his wish to aid the Italians to throw ofi' the Austrian
yoke. But his conduct in regard to Rome and other Italian
difficulties proved how, in the main, his objects were personal
and selfish. At all events, this was the view taken by General
Garibaldi, who had .thrown himself heart and soul into the
conflict, and who now saw with .regret the war concluded,
without results to justify so much bloodshed, or worthy of so
great efforts. But we must briefly refer to the part taken by
him in the war of Sardinian independence.

As soon as there seemed prospect of hostilities, Garibaldi
had made offer of his services to the Sardinian government.
General de la Marmora, as head of the army, declined to
receive him, not so much on his own motion as- on account of
foreseeing difficulties in regard to the regular troops. Victor
Emanuel and his minister Cavour promptly met the difficulty
by giving Garibaldi independent command, uncontrolled
by official rules or routine. Hence he took no part in
the campaigns already described, but took his own line in
attacking and harassing the Austrians. He had no sooner
raised his standard than all the enthusiastic. Italian patriots
flocked to join him, reinforced by volunteers from Switzerland
and other countries. Acting at first with Cialdini, the only
Sardinian general whom he had fraternal sympathy with, he-
assailed the Austrians at Vercelli, and this was the earliest
success of the war, " rather to the chagrin," we are told, " of
the French protectors of the Italian cause." Other. combats
followed, and the Austrian generalissimo, Gyulai, 'dispatched
Urban, one of his fiercest fighting generals, to encounter
Garibaldi, who now established himself at Como. Louis
Napoleon announced that he was going to send General Niel to
co-operate with the irregular leader, but it was a false report,
and no support was given by the French to Garibaldi's move-
ments. At Como and at Bergamo the Austrians were repulsed,'
and Garibaldi led his volunteers, now called the Chasseurs 0"
the Alps, in triumph to Brescia. Here he issued a proclama-- '
tion, signed by him, " General Garibaldi, Commissioner of his
Sardinian Majesty." The Austrian General, Urban, an old
leader in the Hungarian war, proved a formidable foe, with
troops well equipped and armed, and outnumbering the Italian
free corps. Many of Garibaldi's men were killed or disabled

' in the conflicts at this time. It would be tedious to give details
of the war, but one incident in an early encounter is worthy of
being recorded. Garibaldi heard that Urban had shot one of his
men who had been taken prisoner. Hearing of this atrocity,
he ordered two of his Austrian prisoners of war to be shot,
and then he called one of the oldest of the prisoners before
him, and said, "I set you at liberty. Go to General Urban,
and tell him that since he has caused one of my soldiers to be
shot, I have shot two of his; and let him be assured that if I
learn that a single prisoner is executed again, I swear to shoot
every one who may fall into my hands, be he Marshal or
Emperor of Austria." He was determined that his men,
although irregular troops, should be treated as soldiers and as
prisoners of war. And the Austrian General respected his
determination.

With his Chasseurs of the Alps, Garibaldi did more to
molest the Austrians than any general in the allied ranks, and
although the French Emperor in his proclamations ignored
him, his merits and services were honourably recognized by
the sovereign whom he served, and his movements reported
in the Pz'edmontese Gazette. Foreign journals everywhere
rang with his exploits, which were finished only when peace
was declared.

Of the events of the latter years of the life of Garibaldi, for

' reasons referred to at the beginning of this article, we do not
here speak' in detail. _ He lived to see the dream of his'
youthful enthusiasm more than realized, and Italy united, as
well as independent and free, from the Alps to the Calabrian
Gulf. When the' French Were compelled, by troubles of
their own, to withdraw the army of occupation, so long
shamelessly retained at Rome, Victor Emanuel entered the
capital as'King of Italy. The head of the ancient House of
Savoy then ruled as a constitutional monarch over the whole ,
peninsula. Garibaldi was a member of the Italian Parliament,
but he never was an intelligent or hearty supporter of the
new order of affairs. His sympathies were too much with his
early Mazzinian and Republican friends, not understanding
how, as in England, aconstitutional monarchy is the safest
and best of all republics. He never rightly appreciated the
wisdom and prudence of Count Cavour and the other true
statesmen-who placed the fortunes of his country on a- sure
foundation. Possibly in some points the more impetuous and
single-minded impulses of the heroic patriot might have saved
Italy from some of its subsequent troubles. He would have
driven the Pope away from Rome, and not have left him in
the Vatican as the disturber of peace and the intriguer against
the country's truest welfare. But into these political and
religious questions we do not now enter. We leave Garibaldi,
as we love to think of him in his peaceful retreat in the Island
of Caprera, after having nobly helped to obtain for Italy its
freedom and independence. His appearances in the Roman
chamber were not always conducive to a higher estimate of his
prudence or judgment, although he was always the honest,
upright," generous patriot. It was in this aspect, as well as in
admiration of his personal heroism, that his visit to England
was marked by an outburst of popular enthusiasm such as has .
rarely been witnessed. Kings and emperors might have
envied such a triumph. And in spite of weaknesses and faults
of character, no man in modern times is remembered with
' more honour and respect that the Italian hero and patriot

UNBEATEN TRACKS INJAPAN.

F old Will Adams, whose adventures in Japan were
recorded in the first pages of this book, or if Kaempfer,
the early Dutch historian, or any of the Tycoons or Mikados
of other days could behold their land now, they would indeed
be struck with amazement. Foreigners are no longer excluded,
.but are everywhere seen, and the natives, from the Emperor
to the humblest official, affect European or American manners,
education, and even dress. On the waters are iron-clad war
ships and bustling steamboats; on the land are railroads and
telegraphs; while schools, colleges, newspapers, and all the
appliances of modern civilization are rapidly transforming the
nation. The Christian religion is not only tolerated, but has
many true and zealous followers and teachers. The learning
and science of the west are diligently cultivated, and young
Japan has even the tendency to imitate the new-fangled
notions of our time, and, like our OWn agnostics, look' up to
some of the lesser lights of modern research as greater men
than Bacon or Newton. The change and the growth in mental
culture may have been too rapid, but things will right them-
selves in the long run, and the Japanese will learn what is
solid and sound, as well as what is showy and superficial in
literature and in philosophy.

It is not pleasant to see ancient national customs and
manners disappear, except those that are inherently evil and
hurtful. Throughout the islands, and among the masses of
the populations the old ways and usages and costumes will
long remain, but many changes for the better have already
been introduced from. the foreigners. It is good, for instance,
that the Daimios or feudal chiefs, with their bands of armed
retainers, no longer oppress the peaceable people, but that
all subjects of the Emperor are under new laws, administered
by responsible magistrates. It is good to see policemen, and
postman, and other otfieials of social order in the great towns.I44 . Uneeateh Tracks in japan.

Not much change can be expected in the personal and
domestic life of the people, and Japan will continue to present
features of strange novelty to travellers from Europe. The-
physical aspect of the country cannot be changed any more
than that of the natives with their almond-shaped eyes and
olive-coloured complexions. It will be long also before rail-
ways and coaches displace the ordinary vehicles and modes of
travel. ,

The kuruma, a light species of "Bath chair," is still the
common carriage in streets and on highways, while boats
pulled by men harnessed for swimming may still be seen on
the lakes and bays. The grandeur and the beauty of the
scenery all travellers speak of, and some have said that it
was worth going to Japan, if only to see their celebrated
mountain, Fuji-Yama, a mountain more picturesque and more
gigantic than the peak of Teneriffe. Here is the testimony of
one of the most enterprising of travellers, Mrs. Bishop, better
known as Isabella Bird, author of the charming and instructive

book, " Unbeaten Tracks in Japan." (J. Murray).

"It would be treachery to many delicious memories were I
to omit. to say that Fuji, either as a cone of dazzling snow,
or rosy in the autumn sunrise, or as a'lofty spiritual preSence
far off in a veil of mist, or purple against the sunset gold, is-
one of' the great sights of Tokiyo.* Even of Shiba, that
dream of beauty, among whose groves the city hum is unheard,
one might weary, but of Fuji never, and as time goes on, he
becomes an infatuating personality, which raises one above

_the monotonous clatter and the sordid din of mere material
progress. One vision of Fuji I shall never forget. After
spending an afternoon alone among the crowds which throng
the great temple of Kwannon at Asakusa, as I turned a corner
at dusk to go down a hill, my kumma-runner looked round
and said, "Fuji l" and I saw a glory such as I had not seen
before in Japan. The heavens behind and overhead were
dark and covered with clouds, but in front there was a clear

' T6kiy6 is the modern capital, in which the ancient Yedo is merged.
sky of pure, pale green, into which the huge cone of Fuji rose
as a mass of ruddy purple, sublime, colossal, while above the
green, which was streaked with some lines of pure vermilion,
the clouds were a sea of rippling rose-colour, and in the dark-
ness below, at the foot of a solemn, tree-covered embankment,
lay the castle moat, a river of molten gold, giving light in the
gloom. ' Actual darkness came on, and still Fuji rose in purple
into the fading sky, lingering in his glory, and never, while
the earth and heavens last, will just the same sight be seen
again."

Here is part of the account of a journey in the great plain
of Yedo, made in a kuruma, or "one-man gig." There were

.two other .eurumas, one for Ito, the' guide and interpreter; the

other for the baggage. The agreement was to go to Nikko,
ninety miles, in three days, without change of runners, for
elevenshillings each.

"Blithely, at a merry trot, the bumma--runners hurried us
away from the kindly group in the chation porch, across
the inner moat and along the inner drive of the castle, past
gateways and retaining walls of Cyclopean masonry, across
the second moat, along miles of streets of sheds and shops,
all grey, thronged with foot-passengers and bummas, with
packhorses loaded two or three feet above their backs, the
arches of their saddles red and gilded lacquer, their frontlets
of red leather, their " shoes " straw sandals, their heads tied
tightly to the saddle-girth on either side, great white cloths
figured with mythical beasts in blue hanging down loosely
under their bodies; with coolies dragging heavy loads to
the guttural cry of Hail huz'dal with children whose heads
were shaved in hideous patterns; and now and then, as if to
point a moral lesson in the midst of the whirling diorama,'a
funeral passed through the throng, with a priest in rich robes,
mumbling prayers, a covered barrel containing the corpse, and
a train of mourners in blue dresses with white wings. Then
we came to the fringe of Yedo, where the'houses cease to be
continuous, but all that day there was little interval between

' IO
them. All had open fronts, so that the occupations of the
inmates, the " domestic life," in fact, were perfectly visible.
Many of these houses were roadside chayds, or tea--houses,
and nearly all sold sweetmeats, dried fish, pickles, mot/1i, or
uncooked cakes of rich dough, dried persimmons,- rain hats,
or straw shoes for man or beast. The road, though wide
enough for two carriages (of which we saw none), was not
good, and the ditches on both sides were frequently neither
clean nor sweet. Must I write it? The houses were mean,
poor, shabby, often very squalid, the smells were bad, and the
people looked ugly, shabby, and poor, though all were working
at something or other." _ '

The country is a dead level, and mainly an artificial mud
flat or swamp, in whose fertile ooze various aquatic birds
were wading, and in which hundreds of men and women
were wading too, above their knees in slush; for this plain
of Yedo _is mainly a great rice-field, and this is the busy
season of rice-planting; for here, in the sense in which we
understand it, they do not " cast their bread upon the waters."
There are eight or nine leading varieties of rice grown in
Japan, all of which, except an upland species, require mud,
water, and much puddling and nasty work. Rice is the
staple food and the wealth of Japan. Its revenues were esti-
mated in rice. Rice is grown almost wherever irrigation is
possible. .

The rice fields are usually very small and of all_ shapes.
A quarter of an acre is a good sized-field. The rice crop
planted in June is not reaped till November, but in the
meantime it needs to be "puddled" three times,--i.e., for all
the people to turn into the slush, and grub out all the
weeds and tangled aquatic plants, which weave themselves
from tuft to tuft, and puddle up the mud afresh round the
roots. It grows in water till it is ripe, whenthe fields are
dried ofl'._ An acre of the best land produces annually aboflt
fifty-four bushels of rice, and of the worst about thirty.

Onthe plain of Yedo, besides the nearly continuous villages
along the causewayed road, there are islands, as they may be
called, of villages surrounded by trees, and hundreds of plea-
sant oases on which wheat ready for the sickle, onions, millet,
beans, and peas, were flourishing. There were lotus ponds
too in which the glorious lily, Nelumbo nuczfera, is being
grown for the sacrilegious purpose of being eaten! Its splendid
classical leaves are already a foot above the water. A species
of Sagillafz'a is also grown in water for food, but both it and
the 'lotus are luxuries. There are neither hedges nor fences
anywhere, but the peasant proprietors are well acquainted
with their boundaries, and no land-gluttons have arisen yet-
to -add "field to field." Except that in some cases horses
and oxen are used for ploughing the rice-fields, the whole
cultivation is by hand, and not a weed is to be seen. Rows
of the Paulownia Impefialzis, grown for the sake of the lightness
of its wood, which is used for making clogs, do not improve
the somewhat monotonous landscape.

After running cheerily for several miles, my men bowled
me into a tea-house, where they ate and smoked while I sat
in the garden, which consisted of baked mud, smooth stepping
stones, a little pond with some gold fish, a deformed pine, and
a stone lantern. Observe that foreigners are wrong in calling
the Japanese houses of entertainment indiscriminately "tea-
houses." A tea-house or chaya is a house at which you can
obtain tea and other refreshments, rooms to eat them in, and
attendance. That which, to some extent, answers to an hotel is
a yadoya, which provides sleeping accommodation and food as
required. The licenses are different. Tea-houses are of all
grades, from three-storied erections, gay with flags and lan-
terns, in the great cities and at places of popular resort, down
to the roadside tea-house, with three or four lounges of dark-
coloured wood under its eaves, usually occupied by naked
coolies in all attitudes of easiness and repose. The floor is
raised about eighteen inches above the ground, and in these
tea-houses is frequently a matted platform with. a recess called
the doma, literally " earth-space," in the middle, round which
runs a ledge of polished wood called the itama, or "board
space," on which travellers sit while they bathe their soiled
feet with the water which is immediately brought to them ;.
for neither with soiled feet nor in foreign shoes must one
advance one step on the matted floor.. On one side of the
dam is the kitchen with its one or two charcoal fires, where
the coolies lounge on the mats and take their food and smoke,
and on the other the family pursue their avocations. In almost
the smallest tea-house there are one or two rooms at the back,
but all- the life and interest are in the open front. In the small
tea-houses there is only an from, a square hole in the floor,
full of sand or white ash, on which the live charcoal for cooking
purposes is placed, and small racks for food and eating uten-
sils,- but in the large ones there is a row of charcoal stoves,
and the walls are garnished up to the roof with shelves, and the
lacquer tables and lacquer and china ware used by the guests.
The large tea-houses contain the possibilities for a number
of rooms which can be extemporised at once by sliding' paper
panels, called fusuma, along-grooves in the floor and in the
ceiling or cross-beams.

When_ we stopped at waysidettea-houses the runners bathed
their feet, rinsed their mouths, and ate rice, pickles, salt fish,
and " broth of abominable things," after which they smoked
their tiny pipes, which give them three whifi's for each filling.
As soon as Igot out at any tea-house, one smiling girl brought
me the tababo-bon, a square wood or lacquer tray, with a china
or bamboo charcoal-holder and ash-pot upon it, and another
presented me with a zen, a small lacquer table about six inches
high, with a tiny teapot with a hollow handle at right angles
with the spout, holding about an English tea-cupful, and two
cups without handles or saucers, with a capacity of from ten
to twenty thimblefuls each. The hot water is merely allowed
to rest a minute on the tea-leaves, and the infusion is a clear
straiN-coloured liquid with a delicious aroma and flavour,
grateful and refreshing at all times. If Japanese tea " stands,"
it acquires a coarse bitterness and an unwholesome astringency.
Milk and sugar are not used. A clean-looking wooden or lac-
quer pail with a lid is kept in all tea-houses, and though hot
rice, except to order, is only ready three times daily, the pail
always contains cold rice, and the coolies heat it by pouring
hot tea over it. As you eat, a tea-house girl, with this pail
beside her, squats on the floor in front of you, and fills your
rice bowl till you say, " Hold, enough!" On this road it. is
expected that you leave three or four sen on the tea-tray for a
rest of an hour or two and tea.

All day we travelled through rice swamps, along a much-
frequented road, as far as Kasukabe, a good-sized but miserable-
looking town, with its main street like one of the poorest
streets in Tokiyo, and halted for the night at a large yadoya,
with downstairs and upstairs rooms, crowds of travellers, and
many evil smells. On entering, the house-master or landlord,
the leis/u", folded his hands and prostrated himself, touching
the floor with his forehead three times. It is a large, rambling
old house, and fully thirty servants were bustling about in the
daidoboro, or great open kitchen. I took a room upstairs [i.e.,
up a steep step-ladder of dark, polished wood], with a balcony
under the deep eaves. The front of the house upstairs was
one long room with only sides and a front, but it was im-
mediately divided into four by drawing sliding screens or
panels, covered with opaque wall papers, into their proper
grooves. A back was also improvised, but this was formed
of frames with panes of translucent paper, like our tissue
paper, with sundry holes and rents. This being 'done, I
found myself the possessor of a room about sixteen feet square,
without hook, shelf, rail, or anything on which to put any-
thing-l--nothing, in short, but a matted floor.

My bed is merely a piece of canvas nailed to two wooden
bars. When I lay down the canvas burst away from the
lower row of nails with a series of cracks, and sank gradually
till I found myself lying on a sharp-edged pole which connects
the two pair of trestles, and the helpless victim of" fleas and
mosquitoes. I lay for three hours, not daring'to stir lestI
should bring the canvas altogether down, becoming more and
'more nervous every moment, and- then Ito the guide and '
interpreter called outside the slid/i, "It would be best, Miss
_ Bird, that'I should see you." What horror can this be? I
thought, and was not reassured when he added, "Here's a
messenger from the Legation, and two policemen want to
speak to you." On arriving I had done the correct thing in
- giving the house-master my passport, which, according to law,
he had copied into his book, and had sent a duplicate copy to
the police--station, and this intrusion near midnight was as
unaccountable as it was unwarrantable. Nevertheless the
appearance of the two mannikins in European uniforms, with
the familiar batons and bull's eye lanterns, and with manners
which were respectful without being deferential, gave me '
immediate relief. I should have welcomed twenty of their
species, for their presence assured me of the fact that I am
known and registered, and that a Government which, for
special reasons, is anxious to impress foreigners with its power
and omniscience, is responsible for my safety.
V Miss Bird travelled over many remote parts of the empire,
especially in the northern island, where the aboriginal race of
Ainos still form the chief portion of the population. She de-
. scribes in glowing terms the scenery of these regions, as in the
following letter written from Volcano Bay, Yezo, in September :
" It was a heavenly morning. The deep blue sky was
perfectly unclouded, a blue sea with diamond flash and a
'many-twinkling smile' rippled gently on the golden sands
_ of the lovely little bay, and opposite, .forty miles away, the
pink summit of the volcano of Komono-taki, forming the
south-western point of Volcano Bay, rose into a softening veil
of tender blue haze. There was a balmy breeziness in the
air, and tawny tints upon the hill, patches of gold in the woods,
and a scarlet spray here and there heralded the glories of the
, advancing autumn. As the day began, so it closed. I should
like to have detained each hour as it passed. It was thorough
enjoyment I visited a good many of the Mororan Ainos, saw
their well-grown bear in its cage, and tearing myself away
with difficulty at noon, crossed a steep hill and a wood of
scrub oak, and then followed a trail which runs on the amber
sands close to the sea, crosses several small streams, and
passes the lovely Aino village of Maripu, the ocean always on
the left and wooded ranges on the right, and in front an ap-
parent bar to farther progress in the volcano of Usu-taki, an
imposing mountain, rising abruptly to a height of nearly 3,000
feet, I should think.

" In Yezo, as on the main island, one can learn very little
about any prospective route. Usually when one makes an
inquiry, a Japanese puts on a stupid look, giggles, tucks his
thumbs into his girdle, hitches up his garments, and either
professes perfect ignorance, or gives one some vague second-
hand information, though it is quite possible that he may
have been over every foot of the ground himself more than
once. Whether suspicion of your motives in asking, or a
fear of compromising himself by answering, is at the bottom
of this, I don't know, but it is most exasperating to a
traveller. In Hakodate I failed to see Captain Blakiston,
who has walked round the whole Yezo sea-board, and all I
was able to learn regarding this route was that the coast was
thinly peopled by Ainos, that there were Government horses
which could be got, and that one could sleep .where one got
them; that rice and salt fish were the only food; that there
were many 'bad rivers,' and that the road went over 'bad
mountains'; that the only people who went that way were
Government officials twice a year, that one could not get on
more than four miles a day, that the roads over the passes
were 'all big stones,' etc., etc. So this Usu--taki took me
altogether by surprise, and for a time confounded all my
carefully-constructed notions of locality. I had been told that
the one volcano in the bay was Komono-taki, near Mori, and
this I believed to be eighty miles off, and there, confronting
me, within a distance of two miles, was this grand, splintered,
vermilion-crested thing, with a far nobler aspect than that of-
'the' volcano, with a curtain range in front, deeply scored,
and slashed with ravines and abysses whose purple gloom was
unlighted even by the noonday sun. One of the peaks was
emitting black smoke from a deep crater, another, steam and
white smoke from various rents and fissures in its side,
vermilion peaks, smoke, and steam, all rising into a sky of
brillant blue, and the atmosphere was so clear that I saw
everything that was going on there quite distinctly, especially
when I attained an altitude exceeding that of the curtain range.
It was not for two days that I got a correct idea of its geo-
graphical situation, butI was not long in finding out that it
was not Komono-takil There is much volcanic activity about
it. Isaw a glare from it last night thirty miles away. The
Ainos said that' it was ' a god,' but did not know its name,
nor did the Japanese who were living under its shadow. At
some distance from it in the interior rises a great dome-like
mountain, Shiribetsan, and the whole view is grand.

" After passing through miles of scrub and sand we came quite
suddenly upon the agricultural settlement of Mombets, where
the Government has placed a colony of 600 Japanese, and the
verses apply, 'The valleys are so thick with corn that they laugh
and sing--the wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad
for them, and the desert shall rejoice and blossom as the rose.'
For two miles, careful manuring and assiduous hand labour
have turned a sandy waste into a garden, a sea of crops
without aweed, hundreds of acres of maize, wheat, millet,
beans, tobacco, hemp, egg plants, peaches, apricots, pumpkins,
and all the good things of Northern Japan; beautiful and
luxuriant, with a good bridle road, fenced from the crops by a
closely-cropped willow hedge, and numbers of small, neat
Japanese houses, with gardens bright with portulacas, red
balsams, and small yellow Chrysanthemums, all glowing in
the sunshine, a perfect oasis, showing the resources which
Yezo possesses for the sustenance of the large population.

"I have. not seen above three or four Japanese together since
I left Hakodate, and I was much impressed with their ugliness,
the lack of force in their faces, and the feeble physique of both
men and women, as compared with that of the aberigines.
The Yezo Japanese don't look altogether like the Japanese of
the main. island. They are as the colonists of Canada or
Australia as compared with the small farmers of England,
rougher, freer, more careless in their dress and deportment,
and they are certainly afiected, as people always are, by the
cheapness and abundance of horses, which they ride cross--
legged, in imitation of the Ainos. Till I reached Mombets,
all the Japanese I have seen have led a life of irregular and
precarious industry, very different from that of the peasant
proprietors of the main island ,- and in the dull time they loaf
and hang about 'grog shops ' not a little, and are by no means
improved by the habit of lording it over an inferior race.

"A little beyond Mombets flows the river Osharu, one of the
largest of 'the Yezo streams. It was much swollen by the
previous day's rain; and as the ferry--boat was carried away,
we had to swim it, and the swim seemed very long. Of
course, we and the baggage got very wet. The coolness with
which the Aino guide took to the water without giving us any
notice that its broad, eddying flood was a swim, and nota
ford, was very amusing.

" From the top of a steepish ascent beyond the Osharugawa,
there is a View into what looks like a- very lovely lake, with
wooded promontories, and little bays, and rocky capes in
miniature, and little heights, on which Aino houses, with
tawny roofs, are clustered; and then the track dips suddenly,
and deposits one, not by a lake at all, but on Usu Bay, an
inlet of the Pacific, much broken up into coves, and with a
very narrow entrance, only obvious from a few points. Just
as the track touches the bay, there is a road-post, with a
prayer-wheel in it, and by the shore an upright stone of very
large size, inscribed with Sanskrit characters, near to a stone
staircase and a gateway in a massive stone- faced embankment,
which looked much out of keeping with the general wildness
0f the place. On a rocky promontory in a wooded cove, there

.
is'a large, rambling house, greatly out of ' repair, inhabited by
a Japanese man and his son, who are placed there to look
after Government interests, exiles among 500 Ainos. From
among the number of rat- haunted, rambling rooms which had
once been handsome, I chose one opening on a yard or garden
with some distorted yews in it, but found that the great gate-
way and the amada had no bolts, and that anything might- be
appropriated by any one with dishonest intentions; but the
house-master and his son, who have lived for ten years among
the Ainos, and speak their language, say that nothing is ever
taken, and that the Ainos are thoroughly honest and harmless.
Without this assurancel should have been distrustful of the
number of wide--mouthed youths who hung about, in the
lis'tlessness and vacuity of savagery, if not of the bearded men
who sat or stood about the gateway with children in their
arms.

"The next morning was as beautiful as the previous evening,
rose and gold instead of gold and pink Before the sun was
well up I visited a number of the Aino lodges, saw the bear,
and the chief, who, like all the rest, is a monogamist, and,
after breakfast, at my request, some of the old men came to
give me such information as they had. These venerable elders
sat cross-legged in the verandah, the house-master's son, who
kindly acted as interpreter, squatting, Japanese fashion, at the
side, and about thirty Ainos, mostly women, with infants,
sitting behind. I spent about two hours in going over the
same ground as at Biratori, and also went over the words,
and got some more, including some synonyms The click of
the ts before the ch at the beginning of a word is strongly
marked among these Ainos. Some of their customs differ
slightly from those of their brethren of the interior, specially
as to the period of seclusion after a death, the non-allowance
of polygamy to the chief, and the manner of killing the bear
at the annual festival. Their ideas of metempsychosis are
more definite, but this, Ithink, is to be accounted for by the
influence and proximity of Buddhism. They spoke of theFrem/z Accounts of English Naval V idories. 1 5 5

bear as their chief god, and next the sun and fire. They said
that they no longer worship the wolf, and that though
they called the volcano and many other things bamoi, or god,
they do not worship them. [ascertained beyond doubt that
worship with them means simply making libations of sake,
and 'drinking to the god,' and that it is unaccompanied by
petitions, or any vocal or mental act.

"These Ainos are as dark as the people of southern Spain,
and very hairy. Their expression is earnest and pathetic, and
when they smiled, as they did when I could not pronounce
their words, their faces had a touching sweetness which was
quite beautiful, and European, not Asiatic. Their own im-
pression is that they are now increasing in numbers after
diminishing for many years. I left Usu sleeping in the loveli-
neSs of an autumn noon with great regret. No place that I
have seen has fascinated me so much.

FRENCH ACCOUNTS OF ENGLISH NAVAL VICTORIES.

ABOUKIR AND TRAFALGAR.

HE records of our great naval victories are familiar in all

books of history in the hands of English readers. But

there is a curious interest in seeing how the same events are

described by the losers as well as the gainers of great battles.

We select two of the greatest English victories in modern times,

the battles of Aboukir or the Nile, and of Trafalgar, as viewed
through French spectacles.

The account of the battle of Aboukir. we take from the work
of M. Denon, chief of the Savans who accompanied the French
army to Egypt in 1798, and remained throughout the campaigns .
of General Bonaparte in that country. The dedication of the
work is in the following terms: " To Bonaparte. To combineI 56 _ Franc/L Amounts of

thelustre of your Name with the splendour of the Monuments,
of Egypt is to associate the glorious annals of our own time
with the history of the heroic age, and to reanimate the dust
of Sesostris and Menes, like you Conquerors, like you Bene-
faetors. Europe, by learning thatI accompanied you in one
of your most memorable expeditions, will receive 'my work
with eager interest. I have neglected nothing to render it
worthy- of the 'Hero to whom it is inscribed, by VIVANT
DENON."_ '

THE BATTLE or ABouxIR.

. On the morning of the Ist of August we were masters of
Egypt, Corfu, and Malta ; and the security of these possessions,
annexed to France, seemed in great measure to depend on the
thirteen ships of the line that we had with us. The powerful
English fleets which were cruising in the Mediterranean could
not be supplied with stores and provisions twithout much
difficulty and enormous expense.

Bonaparte, who was sensible of all the advantages of such a
position, was' desirous to secure such advantages by bringing
our fleet into the harbour of Alexandria, and offered two
thousand sequins to any one who should accomplish this.
It is said that several of the captains of merchantmen had
sounded, and had found a passage for the fleet into the
old harbour. The evil genius of _France, however, counselled
and persuaded the admiral to moor his ships in the Bay of
Aboukir, and thus to change in one day the result of a long
train of successes. ,

In the course of the afternoon chance led us to Abu-Mandur,
a. convent at the end of a pleasant walk from Rosetta along the
river side. When we had reached the tower which commands
the monastery, we deScried a fleet of twenty sail. [There
. were really only fifteen, including a small brig] To come-
up, to range themselves in a line, and to attack, were the
operations of a few minutes. The first shot was fired at fiveEng/i512 Naval Vz'cton'es. '157

o'clock, and shortly after our view of the movements of the
two fleets was intercepted by the smoke.

When night came on we could distinguish somewhat better,
without, however, being able to give an account of what
passed. The danger towhich we were exposed, of falling into the
hands of the smallest troop, of Bedouins which might come that
way, did not withdraw our attention from anevent by which
we were so strongly interested. Rolls of fire incessantly
bursting from the mouths of the' cannon evinced clearly that
the combat was dreadful, and supported with an equal obstinacy
on both sides.

On our return to Rosetta we climbed on the roofs of thehouses,
where, at ten o'clock, we perceived a strong light, which
indicated a fire. A few minutes after we heard a terrific
explosion, followed by a profound silence. As we had seen a
firing kept up, from the left to the right, on the object in
flames, we drew a conclusion that it was one of the enemy's
ships, which had been set fire to by our people, and we imputed
the silence to the retreat of the English, who, as our ships were
moored, were exclusively in possession of the range of the
bay, and who, consequently, could persevere in Or discontinue
the combat at pleasure.

At 11 RM. a slow fire was kept up, and at midnight the
action again became general. It continued till two in the
morning. At daybreak I was at the advanced posts, and ten
minutes after the fleets were once more engaged. At nine
o'clock another ship blew up. At ten, four ships, the only
ones which were not disabled, and which I could distinguish
to be French; crowded their sails and Quitted the scene of
the battle, in the possession of which they appeared to be,
as they were neither attacked nor followed. Such was the
phantom produced by the enthusiasm of hope.

Itook my station again at the tower of Abu-Mandur, whence
I counted twenty-five vessels, half of which were shattered '
wrecks, and the others incapable of manoeuvring to afford
them assistance. For three days we remained in this state ofI 58 Frank/z A "aunt: of"

cruel uncertainty. We cherished illusion, and spurned at all
evidence, until at length, the passage across the bar being cut
off, and the communication with Alexandria intercepted, we
found that our situation was altered, and that, separated from
the mother country, we were become the inhabitants of a
distant colony, where we should be obliged to depend on our
own resources for subsistence until the peace.

. We learned, in short, that the English fleet had surrounded
our line, which was not moored sufficiently near to the island
to be protected by the batteries; and that the enemy, formed
in a double line, had attacked our ships one after the other,
and had by this manoeuvre, which prevented them from acting
in concert, rendered the one half a witness to the destruction of
the other half.

We learned that it was the Orient which blew up at ten
o'clock at night, and the Hercule the following morning ,' and
that the captains of the ships of the line, the Guillaume Tell and
Genereux, and of the frigatesLa Diane andLa Justice, perceiving
that the rest of the fleet had fallen into the enemy's hands, had
taken advantage of a moment of lassitude and inaction on the
part of the English to efl'ect their escape" We learned, lastly,
that the Ist of August had broken the unity of our forces, and
that the destruction of our fleet, by which the lustre of
our glory was tarnished, had restored to the enemy the
empire of the Mediterannean; an empire which had been
wrested from them by the matchless exploits of our armies,__
and which could. only have been secured to us by the
existence of our ships of war. I

Such is M. Denon's account of the Battle of Aboukir. We
now give a French narrative of the Battle of Trafalgar. '

A book published many years ago, "The Memoirs of a
French Serjeant," gives the history and achievements of
Robert Guillemard,--a sailor on board the French fleet at
the battle of Trafalgar, and supposed to be the. person who
shot Lord Nelson. His claim to be the author of that
memorable deed, seems to be confirmed by the promotionEnglish Naval Victories. ' I59

and the honours to 'which he was raised in his country."\
He went to the Russian campaign with Napoleon in 1812,
and in that expedition, so disastrous to the French, he was
taken prisoner, and sent to Siberia, where he remained till
the peace of 1814 restored him to liberty, and his native
France. We quote the account of the battle of Trafalgar,
out of a great variety of adventures detailed in the Serjeant's
book.

BATTLE OF TRAFALGAR.

. I was beginning to get tired of being at Cadiz, as were my
companions, and nothing indicated that _a change would soon
occur. It was said that we were to Sail for the Channel,
to protect the landing of the troops in England, which every--
body talked of at the time; but an English squadron, known
to be commanded by Nelson, blockaded Cadiz, and prevented
us leaving the bay ; and there was a report that Vice-Admiral
Villeneuve had received express orders to come to action.
On the 20th October, however, there was a vague rumour
in circulation that we were to leave our position next day
and attack the English. The frequent'signals made by the
Bucentaure (the admiral's ship), the meeting of all the
captains of the fleet on board it, and the manceuvres and
preparations of the different vessels, indicated that these
reports were not without foundation. In fact, on the net
of October, at ten in the morning, the combined fleet' left
Cadiz to offer battle to the English. It consisted of thirty
vessels, of which ten Spanish ships occupied the left flank.
Six frigates, French and Spanish, formed the wings of this
splendid fleet, and had orders to assist the ,vessels that re-
quired it during the action. Our line occupied more than
a league in extent, and towards twelve o'clock had come up

' In an account, however, of this battle, published in the Gibraltar
C/mmicle of November 9th, 1805, it is stated that the Frenchman who gave
the fatal wound to Nelson was shot by Mr. Pollard, midshipman of
the Victory, and was seen to fall out of the mizen-top. He may have
been only wounded, and recovered to receive his pension.
within cannon-shot of the English squadron, which was nearly
of equal strength. The two fleets manoeuvred for more than
an hour, for the purpose of choosing their positions and
terminating the preparations for a battle that was henceforth
inevitable. The Redoubtable was in the centre, and a little
in front of the French line, which by the admiral's last orders
had been formed in a semicircle. Immediately in front of
him was an English three--decker, carrying a vice-admiral's
flag, and consequently commanded by Nelson. This vessel
occupied in the English fleet the same position which the
Redoqbtable did in ours. All at once it made signals, which
were instantly answered, and advanced with full sail upon
us, whilst the other vessels followed its example. The in-
tention of its commander was evidently to cut our line by
attacking the Redoubtable, which presented its flank, and
discharged its first broadside. This was the signal for action.
The English vessel returned the fire; ' and at the same
moment, there began along. the whole of the two lines a
.fire of , artillery, which. was not to cease, except by the
_ extermination of one of the two squadrons. Already cries
of suffering and death were heard on' the decks of the Re-
doublable. By the first discharge, one officer, and more than
thirty sailors and soldiers, were killed or wounded. This
was the first time I had been in action; and an emotion
I had never felt till now made my heart beat violently. 'Fear
might form an ingredient in the feeling, but it was mingled
with other sentiments which I could not account for. Iwas
grieved that I was kept in a post where I had nothing else
to do but to fire my gun upon the enemy's deck. I should
have desired 'a more active duty, to be allowed to go over
the ship, and to work one of the cannon.

My desires were soon~gratified. All our top-men had been
killed, when two sailors and four soldiers (of whom I was
one) were ordered to occupy their post in the tops. While
we were going aloft, the balls and grape-shot showered around
us, struck the masts and yards, knocked large splinters from
them, and cut the rigging in pieces. One of. my companions
wasiwounded beside me, and fell from a height of thirty feet
upon the deck, where he broke his 'neck. When I reached
the top, my first movement was to take a view of the prospect
presented by the hostile fleets. For more than a league ex-
tended a thick cloud of smoke, above which were discernible
a forest of masts and rigging, and the flags, the pendants, and
the fire of the three nations. Thousands of flashes more or less,
near continually penetrated this cloud, and a rolling noise
pretty similar to the sound of continued thunder, but much
stronger, arose from its bosom. _ The sea was calm, the wind
light, and not very favourable for the execution of manoeuvres.
When the English top-men, who were only a few yards
distant from us, saw us appear, they directed a sharp fire
upon us, which we returned. A soldier of my company
and a sailor were killed quite close to me; two others .who
were wounded, were able to go belOW' by the shrouds. Our
opponents were, it seems, still worse handled than we, for I
' soon saw the English tops deserted, and none sent to supply
the place of those who must have been killed or wounded by
our balls. Ithen looked to the English vessel and our own
The smoke enveloped them, was dissipated for a moment, and
returned thicker at each broadside. The two decks were
covered with dead bodies, which they had not time to throw
overboard. I perceived Captain Lucas motionless at his post,
and several wounded officers still giving orders. ,

On the poop'of the English vessel was an officer covered
with orders, and with only one arm. .From what I had
heard of Nelson, I had no doubt that it was he. He was
surroundedby several officers, to -whom he seemed to 'be
giving orders. At the moment I first perceived him, several
ofi his sailors were wounded beside him, by the fire of the
Redoublable. As I had received no orders to go down, and
saw myself forgotten in the tops, I'thought it my duty to fire
on the poop of the English vessel, which I saw quite exposed
and close to me I could even have taken aim at the men-
' ' II
I saw, but I fired at hazard among the groups I saw of sailors
and officers. All at once I saw great confusion on board the
Victory; the men crowded round the officer whom I had taken
for Nelson. He had just fallen, and was takcn bclow covered
with a cloak. The agitation shown at this moment left me no
doubt that I had judged rightly, and that it really was the
English admiral. . .

An instant afterwards the Vx'clmy ceased from firing; the
deck was abandoned by all those who occupied it; and I
presumed that the consternation produced by the admiral's
fall was the cause of this sudden change. I hurried below
to inform the captain of'what I had seen of the enemy's
situation. He believed me the more readily, as the slackening
of the fire indicated that an event of the highest importance
occupied the attention of the English ship's crew, and pre-
vented them from continuing the action. He gave immediate
orders for boarding,'and everything was prepared for it in
a moment. It is even said that young Fontaine, a midshipman
belonging to the Redoubtablc, passed by the ports into the
lower deck of the English vessel, found it abandoned, and
returned to 'notify that the ship had surrendered. As Fon-
taine was killed a few moments afterwards, these particulars
were obtained from a sailor, who said he had witnessed the
transaction. However, as a part of our crew, commanded
'by two officers, were ready to spring upon the enemy's deck,
the fire recommenced with a fury it never had had from the
beginning of the action. Meanwhile, an English eighty-gun-
ship placed herself alongside of the Redoubtable to put it
between two fires; and a French ship of the same force placed
itself abreast of the Victory to put it in the same situation.
There was then seen a sight hitherto unexampled in naval
. warfare, and not since repeated--four vessels, all in the same
direction, touching each other, dashing one against another,
interniingling their yards, and fighting with a fury which no
language can adequately express. The rigging was abandoned,
and every sailor and soldier put to the guns. The officers them-Eng/2's}; Nam) Victories. 163 '

selves had nothing to provide for, nothing to order, in this
horrible conflict, and came likewise to the guns. Amidst nearly
four hundred pieces of large cannon all firing at one time in
a confined space--amidst the noise of the balls, which made
furious breaches in the sides of the RedoubtabIe--amongst the
splinters which flew in every direction With the. speed of
' projectiles, and the dashing of the vessels, which were driven
by the waves against each other, not a soul thought of any-
.thing but destroying the enemy, and the cries of the wounded
and the dying were no longer heard. The men fell,la.nd if -
they were any impediment to the action of the gun they had
just been working, one of their companions pushed them aside
with his foot to the middle of the deck, and without uttering a
word, placed himself with concentrated fury at the same post,
where he soon experienced a similar fate. g

In less than half an hour our vessel, without having hauled
down her colours, had, in fact, surrendered. Her fire had
gradually slackened, and then ceased altogether. The muti-
lated bodies of our companions encumbered the two decks,
which were covered with shot, broken dannon, matches still '
smoking, and shattered timbers. One of our thirty-six
pounders had burst towards the close of the- contest. The
thirteen men placed at it had been killed by the splinters,
and were heaped 'together .round its broken carriage. The
ladders that led between the different decks were shattered
and destroyed; the mizen-mast and main-mast had fallen,
and encumbered the deck with blocks and pieces of rigging.
0f the boats placed forward, or hung on the sides of our vessel,
there remained nothing but some shattered planks. Not more
than one hundred and fifty men survived out of a crew of about
eight hundred, and almost all these were more or less severely
wounded. Captain Lucas was one of the number. It Was
five .o'clock when the action ceased. I went over the ship,
where everything presented a prospect of desolation. Calm

despair was painted on the countenances of those who had
escaped from this terrible scene.
In the evening, English long-boats came to take away the
-remainder of our. crew, to be divided among the vessels of
'the fleet; and I was taken on board the Victory. There I-
leamed the death of Nelson; he had been wounded on the
right shoulder by a ball, which penetrated obliquely, and
broke the spine of theback. When taken to the cock--pit,
he ordered his surgeon, Mr. Betty, to inform him of his situa-
tion without concealment or ceremony. He learned, without
the least emotion or regret, that he had only an hour to live,
called for his captain (Captain Hardy), and after inquiring about
the situation of the two fleets, expressly forbid him to let
the English fleet know of his death, and directed the vessels
to be brought to anchor as soon as the action was over, on.
the very spot where it was fought. Captain Hardy promised
to obey his orders implicitly, but he did not like to assume -
the responsibility. He made 'signals that the admiral was
dead, when Lord Collingwood took the command, and did '
not judge proper to come to anchor, which, perhaps, might
' have been dangerous on account of the gale that came on
that night. The death of Nelson was regarded by the English
as a public calamity, the bitterness of which could not be
allayed by the victory they had obtained. The sailors
deplored him as a father; the officers as a commander, whose
talents had caused the glory and prosperity of their country,
and whose place would not for a long period be filled by
an admiral of equal merit. He whose loss is regretted by
an entire nation, he whose death is deplored by old sailors,
,usually little susceptible of sentiments of attachment, should
necessarily inspire some interest, even in an enemy; hence
as a man,I could not help sharing in some degree the affliction
that prevailed on board the Victory; while, as a Frenchman,
I had reason to rejoice at an event that had delivered my
country from one of her most dangerous enemies. At any
rate, from the moment in which he received his wound, and
the position of the wound itself, I could not doubt for a
moment that I was the author; andI have ever since beenEnglish New! V monks, ' I6 5

fully convinced of it. But though' the shot that had brought
down this admiral had rendered a service to my country,
I was far from considering it as an action of which I had a
right to boast. Besides, in the general confusion, every one
could claim the honour; I might not be believed; so that '
I was afraid of furnishing m'y companions with a subject of

ridicule, and did not think proper to mention it to them,

nor to the French officer-s I saw on board the Victory. It was

in this manner, that more than once in the course of my life,

carelessness and false shame have deprived me of advantages

I might have justly claimed" A very strong gale arose in

the evening, and blew through the night with extreme violence,

and soon scattered the wrecks of our vessels which covered

the sea. '

We did not learn the particulars of the action till next
day. Five French vessels 'were unable to come into action; '
the greater part of the Spanish ships would not fight; and
the rest of the fleet sustained with the most distinguished
courage the attacks of an enemy now become superior in
number, for the whole of the English fleet were engaged.
The Spanish three-decker, the Sanlt'ssima Trz'nidada, com-
manded by Admiral Gravina, was sunk after an obstinate
1 resistance against three English veSsels ; the admiral was taken
up wounded, and died some time afterwards at Cadiz. When
he saw all the masts of the T rim'dada shot away, he exclaimed,
--" I_ was lately in a ship, I am now ina fortress, and shall not
abandon it till it sinks under me." This he did. The Atgle,
a French 74, fought also against three English ships, lost
almost all its crew, was taken, and was stranded during the
night upon the Spanish coast, where both French and English
were drowned together. The Indomptable foundered at sea,
with fifteen hundred wounded men on board, not one of
whom was saved. The'Intrepz'de, commanded by the brave
lnfernet, was also sunk, after a terrible resistance to several
vessels who came up successively to cannonade it. Infernet
was picked up, along with one of his sons, and was taken166 Brena/L Accounts qf Eng/2's}; Naval V z'ctorz'es.

on board an English vessel, where he astonished the officers
by his language, equally remarkable for its freedom, bluntness,
spirit, and originality. The Achille, in which was a detachment
of the 67th regiment, was set on fire during the action. The
English who were fighting it cleared off; and of eight hundred
men, who' formed the crew, not more than twenty found an
opportunity of escaping. When all hopes of stoppingthe
progress of the flames were gone, and death seemed inevitable,
to avoid waiting for it, several officers blew out their brains;
others threw themselves into the flames that were consum--
ing the forepart of the ship, several sailors went to the
storeroom, gorged themselves with brandy, and by the most
complete drunkenness endeavoured to throw a veil over the
disaster that was about to terminate their existence. Towards
six o'clock in the evening the fire'reached the gunroom, the
.vessel blew up, and everything disappeared. Upon any other
occasion, the unfortunate crew could easily have been saved;
but without troubling themselves about their fate, the two
fleets in their vicinity thought of nothing but their mutual
destruction. I need not enumerate all the vessels that perished.
It .is sufficient to state, that the combined fleet was totally
annihilated, and that it fought with such obstinacy that of
all those that were engaged in action, the English could only
save, I believe, one single vessel : the rest all perished at sea,
on the coast, or by fire.

The day after the action, they brought on board- the Victory
Vice-Admiral Villeneuve, who had displayed so much intrepi-
dity, talent, and patriotism. The English received him with
the marks of respect due to bravery and merit in misfortune.
He was wounded in the right hand, and seemed quite terror-
struck at his defeat, and careless of the respectful attentiOns
that were shown him. The same day, he caused an inquiry
to be made if there were any non-commissioned officers among
the French prisoners on board ; not one was found. He then
asked for a military man of any rank, who could write easily'
what he should dictate; I offered myself. After a shortT/ze Battle of flu Nile, 167

examination, he told me that I should act as his secretary
till further orders, and ordered me to come daily to the
chamber that had been allotted to him.

Let us now see English accounts of these tWo naval victories.

 

 

THE BATTLE OF THE. NILE.

HE enemy's fleet was first discovered by the Zealous,
Captain Hood, who immediately communicated, by signal, _
the number of ships, sixteen, lying at anchor in the line of battle,
in a bay upon the larboard bow, which we afterwards found to
be Aboukir Bay. The Admiral hauled his wind that instant,
a movement which was immediately observed and followed by
the whole s'quadron, and at the same time he recalled the
Alexdnder and Swiftsure. The wind was at this time N.N.W.,
and blew what seamen call a topgallant breeze. It was
necessary to take in the royals when we hauled upon a wind.

The admiral made the signal to' prepare for battle, and
showed that it was his intention to attack the enemy's van and
centre as they lay at anchor, according to the plan before
developed. His idea in this disposition of his force, Was, first,
to secure the victory, and then to make the most of it, as cir-
cumstances might permit. A bower cable of each ship was'
immediately got out abaft, and bent forward. We continued
carrying sail, and standing in for the'enemy's fleet in a close
line of battle. As none of the officers were acquainted with
Aboukir Bay, each ship kept sounding as she stood in.

The enemy appeared to be moored in a strong compact line
of battle, close in with the shore, their line describing an obtuse
angle in its form, flanked by numerous gun--boats, four frigates,
and a battery of guns and mortars on an'island in the .van.
This situation of the enemy seemed to secure to them the
most decided advantages, as they had nothing to attend to but

. their artillery, in their superior skill in the use of which the
. French so much.pride themselves, and to which indeed their168 Tee Battle hf z/ze Nile.

splendid series- of land victories was in general chiefly to be
imputed.

The position of the enemy presented the most formidable
obstacles: but the admiral viewed these with the eye of a
seaman determined on attack, and it instantly struck his eager
and penetrating mind, that where there was room for an
enemy's ship to swing, there was room for one of ours to
anchor.- No farther signal was necessary than thosewhich had
been made; The admiral's desxgns were as fully known to
his whole squadron, as was his determination to conquer, or
perish 1n the attempt.

The Golz'ath'and Zealous had the honour to lead inside, and
to receive the first shot from the van ships of the enemy, as
well as from the batteries and gun-boats with which their van
was strengthened. These two ships, with the Orion, Audacious,
and Theseus, took their stations inside the enemy's line, and
were immediately in close action. The Vanguard anchored
the first on the outer side of the enemy, and was opposed
within half pistol shot to Le Spartz'ate, the third in the enemy's
line. In standing in, our leading ships were unavoidably obliged
to receive into their hows, the whole fire of the broadsides of
the French line, until they could take their respective stations;
and it is but justice to observe, that the enemy received us
with great firmness and deliberation, no colours having been
hoisted on either side, nor a gun fired, till our van ships were
within half gun shot. .

At this time the necessary number of our men were em-
ployed aloft in furling sails, and on deck, in hauling the
braces, etc., preparatory to our casting anchor. As soon as
this took place, a most animated fire was opened from the
Vanguard, which ship covered 'the approach of those in the
rear, that were following in a close line. The -M'notaur,
Defence, Bellerophon, Majestic, Swiftsure, and Alexander,
came up in succession, and passing within hail of the Vanguard,
took their respective stations by the stern, by which means
the British line became inverted from van to rear.
Captain Thompson, of the Leander, of 50 guns, with a
degree of judgment highly honourable to. his professional
character, advanced towards the enemy's line on the outside,
and most judiciously dropped his anchor athwart hawse of
Le Franklin, raking her with great success ; the shot from the
Leander's broadside, which passed that ship, all striking the
L'Orienl, the flag-ship of the French commander-in-chief.

The action commenccd at sunset, which was at 31 minutes
past 6 P.M., with an ardour'and vigour which it is impossible
to describe.

At about seven o'clock total darkness had come on ; but the
whole hemisphere was, at intervals, illuminated by the fire of
the hostile fleets. Our ships, when darkness came on, had
all hoisted their distinguishing lights, by a signal from the
admiral. .

The van ship of the enemy, Le Guerrier, was dismasted in
less than twelve'minutes ; and in ten minutes after, the second
ship, Le Conqueranl, and the third, Le Sparliate, very nearly
at the same moment, were also dismasted. L'Aquilon and
Le Souverain Peuple, the fourth and fifth ships of the enemy's
line, were taken possession of by the British at half-past eight
in the evening. ~

Captain Berry, at that hour, sent Lieutenant Galway of the
Vanguard, with a party of marines, to take possession of
Le Spartiale, and that officer returned by the boat the French
captain's sword, which Captain Berry immediately delivered
to the admiral, who was then below, in consequence of a
severe wound he had received in the hcad during the heat of
the attack.

At this time it appeared that victory had already' declared '
itself in our favour;_for although L'Orient, L'Heureux, and
T onnant were not taken possession of, they Were considered
as completely in our power, which pleasing intelligence Captain
Berry had likewise the satisfaction of communicating in person
to the admiral.

A few minutes after nine a fire was observed to haveI70 - T he Ball/e of Me Nile.

broken out in the cabin of L'On'ent; to that point Captain
Hallowell ordered as many guns as could be spared from
firing on the Franklin to be directed, and-that Captain Allen
of the marines should throw in the whole fire of his musketry
on'the enemy's quarter, while the Alexander on the other side
Was keeping up an incessant shower of shot on the same
point. The conflagration now began to rage with dreadful
fury; still the French admiral sustained the honour of his' flag
with heroic firmness; but at length a period was put to his
exertions by a cannon ball, which cht him asunder. -He had
before received three desperate wounds, one on his head, and
two on his body, but could not be prevailed upon to quit his
station on the arm-chest. His captain, Casa Bianca, fell by
his side. Several of the officers and men seeing the impracti-
cability of extinguishing the fire, which had now extended itself
along the upper decks, and was flaming up the masts, jumped
overboard; some supporting themselves on spars and pieces
of wreck, others swimming with all their might to escape the
dreadful catastrophe. Shot flying in all directions dashed
many of them to pieces; others were picked up by the boats
of the fleet, or dragged into the lower part of the nearest
ships. The British sailors stretched forth their hands to save
an'enemy, though the battle at that moment raged with un-
controlled fury. The Swz'flsure, anchoring within half pistol
.shot of the larboard bow of the L'Orz'enl, saved the lives of the
commissary, first-lieutenant, and ten men, drawn out of the
water through the lower-deck ports during the hottest part of
the action. The situation of the Alexander and Swzflsure now .
became perilous in the extreme. The expected explosion of
such a ship as L'Orz'ent was to be "dreaded as involving all
around in certain destruction. Captain Hallowell, however,
determined 'not to' move from his devoted station, though
repeatedly urged to do so. He perceived the advantage he
possessed in being to windward of the burning ship. Captain .
Ball was not so fortunate: tw'ice he had the mortification to
perceive that the fire of the enemy had communicated to the
Alexander. He was, therefore, under the necessity of changing
his berth, and moving to a greater distance.

The admiral was informed, by Captain Berry, of the situa-
tion of the enemy. Forgetting his own sufferings, he hastened
. on deck; the first consideration that struck his feeling mind,
was, concern for the danger of such a number of lives. To save
as many of them as possible, he ordered Captain Berry to make
every exertion in his power. The only boat that could swim
Was despatched from the Vanguard; the other ships immedi-
ately fOIIOWed the example, and above seventy drowning
wretches were preserved by those lately employed in their
destruction.

The van of the English fleet, having for the present finished
their part m the glorious contest, now enjoyed a sublime view
of the two lines illumined by the fire of the ill-fated foe ; the
colours of the contending vessels being plainly distinguished.
The moon, which had by this time risen, opposing her cold
light to the warm glow of the fire beneath, added to the
grandeur and solemnity of the picture. The flames had ndw
madesuch progress that an explosion was instantly expected,
yet the enemy on the lower deck, either insensible to the
danger that threatened them, or impelled by the last paroxysms
of despair and vengeance, continued to fire.

At thirty--seven minutes past nine the fatal explosion
happened. The first communicated to the magazine, and
L'Orz'ent blew up' with a crashing sound that deafened all
around her. The tremendous motion, felt to the'very bottom
of each ship, was like that of an earthquake.. An awful pause
and deathlike silence of about three minutes ensued before the
fragments driven to a vast height into the air could descend ;
and then the greatest apprehension Was formed, from the
volumes of burning matter which threatened to fall on the
decks and rigging of the surrounding ships. Fortunately,
however, no great damage occurred. A port fire fell-into the
main-royal of the Alexander, and she was once more in danger
of sharing the fate of the enemy; but by the exertions
of Captain Ball, the flames were soon extinguished.' Two
large pieces of the wreck likewise dropped into the main and
foretops of the Swiftsure, from which the men had fortunately '
withdrawn.

An awful silence now reigned, of several minutes, as if the
contending squadrons, struck with horror at the dreadful
event, which in an instant had hurried so many brave men
into eternity, had forgotten their hostile rage, in pity for the
sufi'erers. But short was the pause of death ; vengeance soon
roused the drooping spirits of the enemy. The Fran/elm,
which now bore the French commander's flag, opened her fire
with redoubled fury on the Defence and Swiftsure, and made

' the signal for renewed hostilities. The Swzflsure, being dis-
engaged from her late formidable adversary, had leisure to
direct her whole fire into the quarter of the foe who had thus
presumed to break the solemn silence ; and in a very short
time, by the well~directed and steady fire of these two ships,
and the Leander on her bows, the Fran/21in was compelled to
call for quarter, and struck to a superior force.

The Alexander, the Majestic, and occasionally the Swtflsure
were now the only British ships engaged ; but the commander
of the latter, finding thatvhe could not direct his guns clear

' of the Alexander, which had dropped between him and the
Tonnant, and fearful lest he should fire into a friend, desisted,

although he was severely annoyed by the shot of the Tonnant,
which was falling thick about him. Most 'of the English ships
were so cut up in their masts and rigging, that they were
unable to set any sail, or to move from their stations. The
firing ceased entirely about three in the morning of the 2nd
of August; but at four, just as the day began to dawn, the

Alexander and Majestic recommenced the action with the

T onnant, Guillaume Tell, Genereux, ande'moIeon. Heureux and

Mereure had fallen out of .the line, and anchored a considerable

distance to leeward. . _
Captain Miller, perceiving the unequal contest, bore down
to assist his friends, and began a furious cannonade on the
enemy. The Theseus had as yet fortunately received. but
little damage in her masts'and rigging, and that little had been
repaired by the active exertions of her commander, as soon as
the first part of the action in the van had terminated in favour
of the British arms. L'Arlemise frigate, stationed on the left
of the centre of the French line, fired a broadside at the
Theseus, and then struck her colours. Captain Miller dis-
patched an officer to'take possession of her, but when the
boat had arrived within a short distance, she burst into a
flame, and blew up. This unofi'icer-like and treacherous
conduct reflects disgrace on the name of Estandlet, Who
commanded her. After having surrendered his ship by striking
her ensign and pendant, conscious that he was then secure
from immediate danger, he set fire to her, and most of his
crew escaped to the shore.

At six o'clock, the Leander having as yet received but little
damage, was ordered by signal from the admiral to assist the
ships engaged,' which was accordingly obeyed. At this time
the action between the three British ships, Alexander, Majestic,
and Theseus, and the Guillaume Tell, Genereux, Tonnanl, and
T z'moleon, had become very distant, as the latter continued
imperceptibly to drop to leeward, and the Theseus was obliged
to veer on two cables to keep within reach of them. '

At 8 A.M. the Goliath bore down and anchored near _thc
Theseus, the French ships having brought to again. The fire
of the British was now chiefly turned against the Heureux and
Mercure, which were soon obliged to surrender. The T I'moleon
was ashore, and the T onnanl was rendered a complete wreck.
Under these circumstances Rear--Admiral Villeneuve, in the
Guillaume Tell, of 80 guns, perceiving that few, if any, of
our ships were in condition to make sail, resolved to lose no
time in escaping from the inevitable fate that would otherwise
have awaited him. About 7 o'clock he cut his cable and got
under weigh, and his example was followed by the Genereux,
with two frigates, La lustiee and La Ditme. '

' Perceiving their intention, the British admiral, by signal,
ordered the Zealous to intercept them. Unfortunately none
of the windward ships were in a condition to second his
attempt to stop the fugitives. Captain Hood did all that could
be done : as they passed byvhim, he received and returned the -
fire'of each in succession. The damage he sustained prevented
him from tacking, and the admiral, with his usual judgment,
gave the signal of recall. .

The whole day of the and was employed by the British
admiral, his officers and men, in securing the ships that had
struck, and repairing the damages their own had sustained.
Though this was fully sufficient to occupy their attention, yet
the mind of the victorious commander was too deeply impressed
with'the most pious gratitude to the Supreme Being, for the
success which had crowned his endeavours in the cause of his
country, to delay returning his public ackhowledgments for
the Divine favour. On the morning of the 2nd he therefore
issued the following memorandum to the different captains of
his squadron : V

Vanguard, of the Mouth of the Nile,
and day ofAugust, 1798.
Almighty God having blessed His Majesty's arms with
victory, the admiral intends returning public thanksgiving for
the same at two o'clock this day, and he recommends every
ship doing the same as soon as convenient.
To the respective captams of the squadron.

Accordingly, at two o'clock public service was performed on
the quarter deck of the Vanguard, by the Rev. Mr. Comyn,
the other ships following the example of the admiral, though
perhaps not all at the same time. The solemn act of gratitude
to Heaven seemed to make a deep impression on many of the

I prisoners, and some of them even remark'ed, " that it was no
wonder the English officers could maintain such discipline and
order, when it was possible to impress the minds of their menThe Battle of Trafalgar. I 7 5

with such sentiments, after a victory so great, and at a moment
of such seeming confusion." l

The same day the following memorandum, expressive of
the admiral's sentiments of the noble exertions of the different
ofl'icers and men of his squadron, was sent round to all the
ships :

Vanguard, of the Mouth of the Mle,
2nd day of August, 1798.
The admiral most heartily congratulates the captains, ofl'icers,
- seamen, and marines of the squadron he has the honour to
command, on the event of the late action; and he desires they
will accept his most sincere and cordial thanks for their very
gallant behaviour in this glorious battle. It must strike
forcibly every British seaman, how superior their conduct is,
- when in discipline and good order, to the riotous_behaviodr of
lawless Frenchmen. ,

The squadron may be assured the admiral will not fail with
his dispatches to represent their truly meritorious conduct in
the strongest terms to the commander-in-chief.

To the captains of the ships of the squadron.

The Arabs and Mamelukes, who had lined the shoresof the
bay, beheld with transport that victory had declared itself in
favour of the English. Their exultation'was almost equal to '
that of the conquerors, and for the three following nights the
whole coast was illumined in celebration of the victory.

THE BATTLE OF TRAFALGAR.

N the 19th of October, 1805, the combined fleets, French

and Spanish, put to sea, and on the zrst Lord Nelson
intercepted them ofi' Cape Trafalgar, and sixty miles eastward of
Cadiz. When his lordship found that by his manoeuvres he
had placed the enemy in such a situation that they could not
avoid an engagement, he displayed the utmost animation, and
his usual confidence of victory. "Now," said he, to Captain
Hardy and the other officers, "they cannot escape us ; I think
we shall at least make sure of twenty of them. I shall pro-

bably lose a leg, but that will be purchasing a victory cheaply."
' The following is transcribed from Lord Nelson's private

memorandum of that day,'for which we are indebted to Mr.
Harrison's " Life of Nelson": " We were between Trafalgar and
Cape Spartel. _ The frigates made the signal, nine sail outside
the harbour. Igave the frigates instructions for their guidance,
and placed Defence, Colossus, and Mars between me and the
frigates. At noon, fresh gales and heavy rain--Cadiz north-
east, nine leagues. In the afternoon Captain Blackwood
telegraphed that the enemy seemed determined to go to the

' westward--and that. they shall not do, if in.the power of
Nelson and Bronte to prevent them! At. five, telegraphed
Captain Blackwood that Irelied on his keeping sight of the
enemy. At five o'clock, Naz'ad made the signal for thirty-one
sail of the enemy north-north-east. _ The frigates and look-out
ships kept sight of the enemy most admirably all night; and
told me, by signals, which tack they were upon. At eight we
wore, and stood for the south-west ; and at 4 A.M. wore, and
stood to the north-east. .

"Monday, October zrst, 1805. At daylight, saw the
enemy's combined fleet, from east to east-south-east. Bore
away; made signal for order of sailing, and toprepare for
battle; the enemy with their heads to the southward. At
seven, the enemy wearing in suceession." And then follows
his lordship's appeal to heaven for success, which were
probably the last words written by this great and brave com-
mander :--

" May the great God, whom I worship, grant to my country,
and for the benefit of Europe in general, a great and glorious
victory! and may no misconduct in any one tarnish it: and
may humanity after victory be the predominant feature in the
British fleet! For myself, individually, I commend my life to
Him who made inc,- and may His blessing light upon my
endeavours for serving my country faithfully! To Him I
resign myself, and the just cause which is entrusted to me to
defend. "Amen! Amen! Amen !"

About twelve at noon the action began, and the last signal
before it commenced was'a private one by telegraph--a signal
too emphatic ever to be forgotten--" ENGLAND EXPECTS
EVERY MAN TO DO HIS DUTY."

While the Victory was going into action, his lordship. walked
the deck very quickly,_and exclaimed, " This is the happiest
day of my life--and it is a'happy day, too, for Burnham
Thorpe (the place of his nativity), for it is the day of their
fair." He then went over the different decks, saw and con-
versed with the seamen,' encouraged them with his usual
affability, and was much pleased at the manner in which they
had barricadoed the hawser-holcs of the ship. All was perfect
death-like silence, till just before the action began. Three
cheers were given his lordship as he ascended the quarter-deck
ladder. He had been particular in recommending cool, steady
firing, in preference to a hurrying fire without aim or precision,
and the event justified his lordship's advice, as the masts of his
opponents came tumbling down on their decks, and over their
sides, within half an hour after the battle began to rage in its
full fury. '

The conduct of their leader was fully adequate to rouse the
British officers to deeds of hardy enterprise. It was his intention
to have begun the action by passing ahead of the Bucenlaure, the
flagship of Admiral Villeneuve, that the Violofy might be ahead
of that ship, and astern of the Santz'ssz'ma' Trinz'dada; but the
Buceniam'e shooting ahead, his lordship was obliged to go
under her stern, raked her, and lufl'ed up on her starboard
side. The Bucenlaure fired broadsides at the Vz'ctozy, before
his lordship ordered the ports to be opened, when the whole
broadside, which was double-shotted, was fired into her, and the
discharge made such a tremendous crash that the Bucentaur '
was seen to heel. The number of her men killed proved to be .

12
three hundred and sixty-five; wounded, two hundred and
nineteen. The flag of the Bucentaure was then struck, as she
was dismasted and quite unmanageable.

' Lord Nelson now shot ahead to the Spanish admiral's ship'
the Santzissz'ma T rz'm'dada. He had already gained the highest
honour in grappling with this ship during the action off Cape
St. Vincent, in 1797. She was the largest ship in the world,
carried 136 guns, and had four decks. The hero ordered the
Victory alongside his old acquaintance as he called her, and
to be lashed to his tremendous opponent. The conflict was
horrible; the enemy were engaged at the muzzle of their
guns. A dreadful carnage was made in the Spanish ships,
which were full' of men. The Santz'ssbna T rim'dada had on
board sixteen hundred, including a corps of troops, among
whom were some sharp-shooters.

The royal marines on the poop of the Victory, as well as the
officers, seamen, and marines on the.quart'er--deck, soon felt I
the effects of the system of sharp-shooting. The men began
to drop fast; and, as Captain Adair, of the marines, wishing
to counteract the destructive fire, went up the shrouds with a
paity, he fell quite dead on the poop, perforated with near
twenty balls from those marksmen. The action then became
very hot, and Lord Nelson was advised not to appear so
conspicuously, in full uniform, to the mark of the topmen of
the enemy. His answer was, "No, whatever may be the
consequences, the insignia of the honours I now wear I gained
by the exertions of British seamen under my command in
various parts of the world, and in the hour of dangerI am
proud to show them and the enemies of old England thatI
will never part with them; if it please God I am to fall, I will .
expire with these trophies entwined round my heart."

Amidst the conflict of ' cannon, fired muzzle to muzzle,
showers of bullets were directed on the quarter-deck, where
the gallant hero stood, fearlessly giving his orders, and cheer-
fully abiding every peril. His heart was animated, and his
' spirits gay. The stump of his right arm, which he always
facetiously denominated his fin, moved the shoulder of his
sleeve up and down with the utmost rapidity, as was customary
when he felt greatly pleased. Captain- Hardy observing from
the manner in which the sharp-shooters fired that it was their
object to single out the officers, repeatedly requested Lord
Nelson to change his coat, or to put on a great coat over it.
The undaunted admiral answered he had not time. Top soon.
were Captain Hardy's apprehensions verified. A shot from the
main-top of the enemy carried away part of the epaulette, and
penetrating through the star, entered his left breast, and took
a direction through the vital parts. He fell on the deck.
Captain Hardy ran to him, and said, " I hope it is not mortal,
my lord." He replied, "They have caught me at last." He
was then taken below by Mr. Bourke, the purser of the Victory,
who carried him in his arms, and laid him on a bed. His
lordship said, "Bourke, my back is broke."- The surgeon
(Mr. Beatty) soon came and examined the wound. He said, '
" Doctor, you can be of no use to me ; go and assist those to
whom you can be of service, as I have but a few moments
. to live." He repeatedly asked for Captain Hardy, of whom
his lordship. inquired "how they went on ? " Captain Hardy
replied that ten ships had struck; and his lordship said, " I
hope none of ours have struck ;" to which Captain Hardy
replied " There is no fear of that.' ,. He then returned to the
deck. After the Victory had ceased firing, Captain Hardy
again went to his lordship, who took him by the hand, and
said, "I am now happy." Captain Hardy now told him the
number of the enemy that had struck, and his lordship said,
" Hardy, bring the fleet to an anchor," and that was the last
order his lordship gave. Captain Hardy again returned to the
deck; his lordship previously said, "I shall be dead before
you return, take my body home." A short time after he said
to Mr. Bourke (and these were his last words), "I have done
my duty--I praise God for it!" and in a few moments he
expired without a groan.
It was known on board the Trinidada that the British
admiral had been wounded, and the moment he fell there was
a general shout on board the Spanish ship. Short, however,
was the exultation of her crew, who were soon obliged to
strike to the irresistible prowess of the British tars. After _
this conquest, the Victmy subdued a third ship, which closed

her part in the engagement. _
The following particulars of Nelson's last moments are

related by Mr. Beatty, the surgeon, and Mr. Bourke, the .

purser: --
About the middle of the action with the combined fleets, on

the zrst of October, Lord Nelson Was upon the quarter>>deck,
where he had resolved to take his station during the Whole
of the battle. A few minutes before he was wounded, Mr.
Bourke was near him ; he looked steadfastly at him, and said,
" Bourke, I expect every man to_ be upon his station. " Mr.
Bourke took the hint, and went to his proper situation in the
cockpit. '

At this time his lordship's secretary, Mr. Scott, who was
.not, as has been repreSented, either receiving directions from
him, or standing by him, but was communicating some orders
to an officer at a distant part of the quarter-deck, was cut
almost in two by a cannon' shot. He expired on the instant,
and was thrown overboard.

Lord Nelson observed the act of throwing his secretary
overboard, and said, as if doubtful, to a midshipman who was
near him, "Was that Scott?" The midshipman replied he I
believed it was. He exclaimed, " Poor fellow!"

He was now walking the quarter- -deck, and about three
yards from the stem, the space he generally walked before he
turned back. His lordship was in the act of turning on the
quarter-deck, with his face towards the enemy, when he was
mortally wounded 1n the left breast by a musket ball, supposed
to have been fired from the mizen- top of the Redoublable, I
French ship of the line, which the If'z'clory had attacked early

in the battle. - '
l-Ie instantly fell. He was not, as has been related, picked
up by Captain Hardy. In the hurry of the battle, which was
then raging in its greatest violence, even the fall of their
beloved commander did not interrupt the' business of the
quarter-deck. The sailors, however, who were near his lord-
ship, raised him in their arms, and carried him'to the cockpit.
He was immediately laid upon a bed, and the following is the
substance of the conversation which really took place in the
cockpit, betvireen his lordship, Captain Hardy, Mr. Bourke,
and Mr. Beatty.

Upon seeing him brought down, Mr. Bourke imme-
diately ran to him. "I fear," he said, " your lordship is
wounded." "Mortally, mortally." "I hope not, my dear
lord; let Mr. Beatty examine your wounds." " It is oi
no use," exclaimed the dying Nelson; "he had better
attend to others." .

When Bourke returned into the cockpit with Captain Hardy,
Lord Nelson told the latter to come near him. " Kiss me,
Hardy," he exclaimed. Captain Hardy kissed his cheek.
"I hope your lordship," he said, "will live to enjoy your
triumph." "Never, Hardy,"'he exclaimed; "I am dying!
I am a dead man all over, Beatty will tell you 50.
Bring the fleet to anchor; you have all done your duty.
God bless you." Captain Hardy now said, " I suppose
Collingwood, my dear lord, is to command the fleet?"
"Never," exclaimed he--" whilst I live." Meaning, doubtless,
that so long as his gallant spirit survived, he would never_
desert his duty.

What passed after this was merely casual; his lordship's
last words were to Mr. Beatty, whilst he was expiring in his
arms, "I could have wished to have lived to enjoy this, but
God's will be done." " My lord," exclaimed Hardy, " you die
in the midst of triumph." " Do I, Hardy? " he smiled faintly.
"God be praisedl" These were his last words before he
expired.

The day after the victory, Admiral Collingwood issued the
following general order: --
Euyalus, October 22nd, 18o5'

The evetho-be--lamented death of Lord Viscount Nelson,
Duke of Bronte, the cpmmander-in-chief, who fell in the action
on the zrst, in the arms of victory, covered with glory, whose
memory will ever be dear to the British navy and the British
nation, whose zeal for the honour of his king and for the
interests of his country will be ever held up as ,a shining
example for a British seaman, leaves to me a duty to return
my thanks to the Right Honourable Rear-admiral, the captains,
officers, seamen, and detachments of royal marines, serving on
board His Majesty's squadron now under my command, for
their conduct on that day: but where can I find language to
express my sentiments of the valour and skill which were
displayed by the officers, the seamen, and marines, in the
battle with the enemy, where every individual appeared a '
hero, on whom the glory of his country depended ;~ the attack
was irresistible, and the issue of it adds to the page of our
naval annals a brilliant instance of what Britons can do, when
the king and country need their service.

To the Right Honourable Rear-admiral the Earl ofNorthesk,
to the captains, officers, and seamen, and to the officers, non-
commissioned officers, and privates of the royal marines, I beg
to give my sincere and hearty thanks, for their highly meri-
torious conduct, both in the action, and-- in their zeal and activity
in bringing the captured ships out from their perilous situation
in which they were, after their surrender, among the shoals of
Trafalgar, in boisterous weather.

And I desire that the respective captains will be pleased to
communicate to the officers, seamen, and royal marines, this
public testimony of my high approbation of their conduct, and
my thanks for it.

fleet with success, in giving them a complete victory over their
enemies, on the arst of this month; and that all praise and
thanksgiving may be offered up to the throne of grace for the
great benefits to our country and to mankind :

I have thought proper that a day should be appointed of
general humiliation before God, and thanksgiving for this His
merciful goodness, imploring forgiveness of sins, a continuation
of His divine mercy, and His constant aid to us, in the defence
of our country's liberties and laws, without which the utmost
efforts of man are nought, and I direct, therefore, that a day be

When the news of the victory arrived in England, addresses
to the throne poured in from every part of the country. The
city of London as usual took the lead, and the Court and Common
Council waited on His Majesty at St. James's, with an address
of congratulation.

To this address His Majesty George III. was pleased to
return this most gracious answer :--

" I receive with peculiar satisfaction the congratulations of
my loyal city of London on the late glorious and decisive
victory, obtained, under the blessing of God, by my fleet
commanded by the late Lord Viscount Nelson, over the'
combined force of France and Spain. The skill and intrepidity
of my officers and seamen were never more conspicuous than
on this important occasion. The loss of the distinguished
commander under whom this great victory has been achieved,
I most sincerely and deeply lament; his transcendent and
heroic services will, I am persuaded, exist for ever in the
recollection of my people, and whilst they tend to stimulate184 ' Lutfler before the Emperor.

of the grandest scenes in the history of the world. Apart

from the religious aspect of the 'event, as bearing on the cause

of the Reformation, there never was a more noble instance of

personal courage and heroism, and nothing could have sustained

the humble solitary monk in such a contest, save his living
faith in Divine power and help.

It was with great reluctance, and after many efforts at '
obtaining internal reform, that Luther at last resolved to break

'into the Roman Catholic Church. When cited to Rome, in
1519, he still professed readiness to submit himself: "I am
willing to be silent," he said, "if they will not attempt to silence
the gospel." When the scandalous sale of pardons by Tetzel,
the papal envoy, roused his indignation, and he published his
theses against indulgences, the Pope replied by sending a bull
of excommunication.

It was orb December Ioth, I 520, that he burned publicly the
Pope's decretal against him, the students and the people of
Wittenberg witnessing the scene, amidst great excitement.
This was at length an open rupture with Rome, and a deed
of defiance from which there could be no retreat.

. In less than a fortnight after the burning of the papal bull,
Luther heard Of a citation to appear before the new Emperor,
_ Charles V. It was as yet doubtful what part the German.
nation, represented by its chief and princes, would take in a
conflict-with'Rome. The Emperor paid great deference to the
Elector, Frederic the Wise, and it was by his advice that he
refused to_ obey blindly the papal commands, but decided first _
to examine into the matters at issue. Hence the citation ofLuteer before z'lze Emperor. I8 5 -

the German monk to appear before the'Diet summoned to
assemble at Worms. The citation was put into his hands on
March 26th by the Imperial Herald, Caspar Sturm, who
appeared at Wittenberg-to escort him, bearing a safe-conduct.
In the beginning of April they set out, and arrived on the 16th,
a journey which can now be made by rail in a few hours.

Some of the crowd who accompanied him in the outset of his
journey, said, " There are many cardinals and prelates at
Worms 1 You will be burnt alive, and your body be reduced
to ashes, as they did with John Huss." "Though they should
kindle a fire," he replied, "whose flames'should'reach from
Worms to Wittenberg and rise up to heaven, I would go
through it in the name of the Lord, and stand before them."

One day, when he had entered into an inn, and the crowd was
as usual pressing to see him, an officer made his way through,
and thus addressed hirn, "Are you the man who has taken in
hand to reform the papacy? How can you expect to succeed ?"
" Yes," said Luther, " I am the man. I place my dependence
upon the Almighty God, whose word and commandment arc
- before me." The officer, deeply affected, gazed on him with
a look of kindly sympathy, and said, " Dear friend, there is
much in what you say. I am a servant of the Emperor
Charles, but your Master is greater than mine. He will help"
and protect you."

At Naumberg Luther met a priest, said to have been
J. Langor, a man of stem zeal, who kept hung up in his studya
portrait of Jerome Savonarola, of F errara, who perished in the
flames at Florence in the year 1498, by order of Pope
Alexander VL, a martyr for liberty and morals rather than an .
enlightened confessor of the Gospel. Taking down the portrait,
the priest held it forth in silence as he approached Luther, who ,
saw the import of his solemn and silent action. But his
intrepid spirit was unmoved. "It is Satan," he remarked,
" who seeks 'by these terrors to hinder the confession of the
truth in the assembly of the princes, for he foresees the effect
it will have on his kingdom." " Stand fast in the truth thou
hast professed " replied the austere but honest and friendly
priest, " and thy God will never forsake thee."

From Frankfort he .wrote to Spalatin, "I am arrived here,
although Satan has sought to stop me _on my way by sickness.
From Eisenach to this place Ihave been sufl'ering, and I am
at this moment in worse condition than ever. I find that
Charles has issued an edict to terrify me ; but Christ lives, and
we shall enter Worms in' spite of all the councils of hell, and
all the powers of the air. Therefore engage a lodging for me."

Spalatin. soon became alarmed; and when Luther was
approaching the city he sent a message by a servant, who

.said, " Abstain from entering Worms." This was at Oppen-
heim, a few miles from the city, now the last station on the
railway between Mayence and Worms. Luther, stillundaunted,
turned his eyes on Spalatin's messenger, and answered, "Go,

. tell Your'master that though there should be as many devils at
Worms as there are tiles on its roofs, I would enter it."

Not long before his death, Luther was reminded of this,
when he said, " I feared nothing. God can give this boldness
to man. I know not whether now I should have so much
liberty and joy."

When Luther was in theihall, about to be ushered into the
presence of the assembly, a veteran knight, George Freunds-
borg, commander of the guard, touched>> him on the shoulder,
and said kindly, "My poor monk, my poor monk, thou hast a

' march and a struggle to go through, such as neither I nor many
other captains have seen the like of in our worst campaigns,
But if thy cause be just, and thou art sure of it, go forward,
in God's name, and fear nothing! He will not forsake thee l "
A noble tribute from a brave soldier to the courage of the
soul!

After Luther made his first appearance before the Diet, and
had delivered the addresses prepared by him in defence of
himself against the charges made, he was required to retire.
He went to his inn, a few- of his friends accompanying him, and
a great crowd filling the streets, and struggling to catch a sightLumer (Se/"ore Me Emperor. 187

of the man about whom so much stir was beingmade. 'He
sought the quiet of his chamber, and there he wrote a letter to
the Councillor Caspianus in these words, "I am writing to you
from the very midst of a tempest" (alluding probably to the
noise outside the inn, and the excitement in the town). " An
hour ago I appeared before the Emperor and his brother. I
avowed myself the author of my books, andI have promised
to give my answer to-morrow as to recantation. By the help
of Jesus Christ, Iwill not retract a single letter of my writings."
He had already in prayer sought and found the strength which
made him'firm as a rock.

Luther mentions in his letter that he had appeared before
' the Emperor and his brother, the Archduke Ferdinand. But
in truth there had seldom if ever been seen so great and august
an assembly. The six Electors of the Empire, whose de-
scendants almost all became kings; eighty dukes, rulers of
large territories ,- thirty archbishops and other Romish prelates ;
many princes, barons, counts, and knights of good estate ;_
seven ambassadors, including those of France and England ;
the Pope's nuncios ; in all above zoo notables; such was the
imposing Court before which " the solitary monk" appeared.

On the morrow, when ushered into the presence of the
Emperor and the assembly, when the question was put to him,
" Will you, or will you not, recant ?" Luther answered
unhesitatingly, " Since your Most Serene Majesty and your
High Mightinesses require of me a simple, clear, and direct
answer, Iwill give one, and it is this: Icannot submit my
faith either to the Pope or to the Councils, because it is clear
as noonday that they have often fallen into error, and even
into glaring inconsistency with themselves. If, then, I am not
convinced by proof from Holy Scripture, or by cogent reasons,
if I am not satisfied by the very texts I have cited, and if my
judgment is not in this way brought into subjection _to God's
Word, I neither can nor will retract anything, for it cannot be
rightfor a Christian to speak against his conscience."

Then turning a look on that asseinbly before whom he stood,
and which held in its hand life or death, he said, "th1: I
STAND. I CANNOT no OTHERWISE, Gon HELP MEl AMEN."

The assembly for a time was motionless with astonishment.
Luther's friendswere proud of their champion, yet felt painful
anxiety as to the result. Several of the princes present could
scarcely conceal their admiration. The Emperor, who had the
day before listened to Luther with marked attention and
interest, on recovering from the first impression made by this
declaration of firmness, exclaimed, "The monk speaks with an
intrepid heart and unshaken courage."

"If you do not retract,' resumed the Chancellor, the as-
sembly being recalled to attention, " the Emperor and the
States of the Empire will proceed to consider how to deal with -
an'obstinate heretic." At these words Luther's friends trembled,
but the monk repeated, "May God be my helper, for I can
retract nothing 1" Luther was conducted out of the hall during
the deliberation, and on being again called in, the Chancellor
then addressed him : " Martin, you have not spoken with that
humility which befits your condition. The distinction which
you have drawn as to your works was needless, for if you
retracted such as contained errors the Emperor would not allow
the rest to be burnt. It .is absurd to require to be refuted by
Scripture, when you are reviving heresies condemned by the
General Council of Constance. The Emperor, therefore, com-
mands you to saylsimply 'Yes' or No,' whether you mean to
affirm what you have advanced, or whether you retract any
part thereof " .

"I have no other answer to give than that which I have
already given," said Luther, quietly but firmly.

The Elector Frederic' had expected that possibly Luther's
courage would have failed him in the Emperor's presence;
however, he was the more deeply affected by the Reformer's
firmness. He felt proud of having taken such a' than under his
protection. He said afterwards to Spalatinf" Oh 2 how Luther

spoke before the Emperor and all the States of the Empire-
' all I feared was that he might go too far." ~juggernaut in I 806. 189

Well may it be said that this was the grandest scene in the
history of the Reformation, one of the grandest scenes in all
history.

JUGGERNAUT IN 1806.

UCH has been written about the Hindoo idolJuggernaut,

not only in missionary records, but also in books of

travel and history. The horrible scenes formerly witnessed
during the festivals have been checked by the interference
' of the British Government, and especially the sacrifice of
human life is prevented by the authority of the law, and the

regulations of the police. Before long it is to be hoped that

Christian influence and educational enlightenment will put an

' end to what still prevails of heathen idolatry and superstition.
The following account of the festival, during the times when

priestcraft and fanaticism were as yet unchecked, is from the

journal of an eye-witness, Dr. Claudius Buchanan, an enterprising
traveller, and a man distinguished for his learning and piety.

The idol called Juggernaut, says Dr. Buchanan, has been
considered as the Moloch of the East, and he' lsjustly so named,'
for the sacrifices offered up to him by devotees are not less
criminal, perhaps not less numerous, than those recorded of
the Moloch of Canaan.

Two other idols accompany Juggernaut--namely, Bolovam
and Shubudra, his brother and sister; for there are three
deities worshipped here. They receive equal adoration, and
sit on thrones of nearly equal height. The temple' 15 a stupen-
dous fabric, truly commensurate with the extensive sway of the
"horrid king."

' On the 18th June, 1806, I witnessed a scene which I_ shall '
never forget. It was the great day of the Feast, and at twelve
o'clock the Moloch of Hindostan was brought out of his temple,"
amid the acclamations of hundreds of thousands of his wor-190 _ juggernaut 212 i806. I

shippers. When the idol was placed upon his throne, a shout
was raised by the multitude, such as I had never heard
'before. It continued equable for a few minutes, then gradually
died away. '

After a short interval of silence, a murmur was heard in the
distance. All eyes were turned to the place, and beheld a
grove advancing. A body of men, having green branches or
palms in their hands, approached with great celerity. The
people opened a way for them, and when they had come up to
the throne, they fell down before him that sat thereon, and
worshipped. And the multitude again sent forth a voice
" like the sound of a great thunder." But the voices I now
heard were not those of melody or of joyful acclamation.
Their number indeed brought to my mind the countless
multitude of the Revelation, but their voices gave no tuneful
hosanna or hallelujah--it was rather a yell of approbation.'

The throne of the idol was placed on a stupendous car, about.
sixty feet in height, resting on wheels, which indented the
ground deeply as they turned slowly under the ponderous
machine. Attached to it were six cables, by which the people
drew it along. Upon the tower were the priests and satellites
of the idol, surrounding his throne.' The idol is a block of _
wood, having a frightful visage, painted black, with a distended
mouth of bloody colour; his arms are of gold, and he is
dressed in gorgeous apparel. The other two idols are of a
white and yellow colour. Five elephants preceded the three
towers, bearing lofty flags, dressed in crimson caparisons, and
having bells hanging thereto, which sounded musically as they
moved. _

I went on in the procession, close by the tower of Moloch,
which, as it was drawn with difficulty, grated on its wheels
harshly. After the tower had proceeded some way, a pilgrim
announced that he was ready to offer himself a sacrifice to the
idol; He laid himself down in the road before the tower, as it
'was moving along, lying on his face, with his arms stretched '
forward. The multitude passed round him, leaving the space
clear, and he was crushed to death by the wheels of the'car.
A shout of joy was raised to the god, and' the people threw
cowries, or small money, on the body of the victim, in appro-
bation of the deed. He was left to view a considerable time,
and was then carried by the hurries to the Golgotha. A woman
next devoted herself to the idol. She laid herself down in the
road obliquely, so that the wheels did not kill her instan-
taneously,-as is generally the case, but she died in a few hours.
Next morning, as I passed the place where she had been taken,
nothing of her remained but the bones.

And this, thought I, is the religion of the Brahmins of
Hindostan, and their worship in its highest degree] What,
then, shall we think of their private manners and moral
principles? For it is equally true of India as of Europe, if
you would know the state of the people look at the state of
the temple.

The idolatrous processions continue some days longer, but
my spirits, adds Dr. Buchanan in his-journal, are so exhausted
by the constant view of these enormities, that I mean to hasten
away from Juggernaut sooner than I at first intended.

As to the number of worshippers assembled here at this.
time no accurate calculation can be made. The natives
themselves, when speaking of the number at particular
festivals, usually say that a lac (100,000) of people would not
be missed. I asked a Brahmin how many he supposed were
present at the most numerous festival he- had ever witnessed.
"How can I tell," said he; " how many grains are there in a

handful of sand '1'"
LIFE--BOAT SERVICES.

VERY year, all round the coasts of the British Islands
there are deeds of daring and'of endurance done by
the men of the Life-Boat Service, worthy of record among the
noblest histories of heroism. It is but rarely that there are
eyes to bear public witness, or pens to chronicle these heroic
deeds. A bare report of the {act of a boat going out, and of so
many men saved from a watery grave, is all that is usually
heard of. Now and then some shipwreck of unwanted magni-
tude, or rescue services of special gallantry, attract attention,
and medals and honours from the Royal National Life-Boat
Institution reward the crew. But there is no need of such
inducements to prompt to efforts for saving life. The sense of
duty and the feeling of benevolence suffice to bring volunteers
for the service. At the same time, it makes a great difference,
to a poor sailor or boatman, when he knows that those dependent
on him will not be forgotten if he risks his life. It is to be
desired, therefore, that ample funds be at the disposal of the
managers of the Institution we have named, and 'of other
societies for kindred objects, not merely to support the service
in efficiency, but to help the widows and orphans of those that'
perish in the good cause.
0f the importance of the Life-Boat work some idea may be
formed by the statement that in one single year 1,200. lives
were saved through its means; since the beginning of the
Institution about 35,000 have been saved. The expenditure

_ every year is now not far from PS40,000, figures which show
the magnitude to which the Work has attained. The number ,

of boats is now about 280. It is pleasant to record that
amongst the latest additions tolthis great fleet of mercy are two
boatspsubscribed for by readers of the Boys' Own Paper. One
of these boats, almost immediately after it was placed on its
station, at Poole, in Dorsetshire, had the good fortune to rescue
the crew of a foreign ship. The subscriptions for these twoLife--Boat Services. 3 193

boats was mostly in small sums, collected by boys themselves
in every part of the kingdom, giving good hope and happy
augury that the work will be maintained and extended in
future years.

Kindred in purpose and spirit, is the work of the Rocket
and Mortar Apparatus, under the direction of the Board of
Trade, and the management of the Coast-Guard. To the
exertions of Captain Manby the nation is mainly indebted for
the establishment and thorough organization of this important
service. There are many parts of the coast where, from the
rocky nature of the shore, the deep water running up to steep
cliffs, the absence of asuflicient population from which to draw
a crew, and other reasons, life-boats would be either useless,
or could not be maintained in a state of efl'iciency. On such
coasts the rocket apparatus is the ship-wrecked Sailor's only
hope. Many thousands of lives have been saved. In one year
there were above 500 men thus rescued. Information about
these and other services for the benefit of sailors will be found
in Dr. Macaulay's book of "Sea Pictures " (Religious Tract
Society). Of the Life-Boat Service a full account is given in
" The History of the Life-Boat and its Work," by the late,

_ Mr. R. Lewis, Secretary of the Institution; and also in the
periodical the Life-Boat loumal. From that Journal we extract
a remarkable narrative, not because of special gallantry in the
men, nor unusual peril in the service, but because we happen
to have a more clear and detailed account of the wreck and
the rescue, than in most other recent cases. But in turning
over the pages of the Lifl-Boat Journal we meet with many
brave and noble deeds, a's worthy of public recognition as

. those of any of the gallant men who have gained the Victoria
Cross. The Albert medal is occasionally given for such

services.
Before quoting, however, the account of the " Wreck of the

Indian Chief," let us, very briefly, refer to two or three other
recent cases, which show the variety and extent of work, and
the readiness of resource, and the hard labour, sometimes

I3194 sze-Boat Services,

necessary before the oars can be put into the water, or the
. sail hoisted.

The first case is on an Irish station, the boatmen of the
Sister Island not being deficient in the qualities most required
in the service.

I. At Ballywalter, County Down--A messenger having
brought information at 1.30 P.M. on the 6th February, 1883,
that a vessel was ashore on the north end of the Long Rock, the
crew of the Admiral Henry Meynell Life-boat at once assembled,
and crowds of the villagers dragged the boat by road to the
scene of the wreck, much difficulty being experienced in
getting her to the shore, on account of there being two ditches
on the way. The boat was at last launched, but notwith-
standing the noble exertions of her crew to battle with the
fierce gale blowing from the E.S.E., she was driven ashore
with great violence, three of her oars being broken. Owing
to the strength of the gale'and the violence of the surf great
difficulty was experienced in saving the boat. After renewed
exertions, however,'she was again launched at 3 A.M., and
succeeded in rescuing the crew of the vessel, consisting of six
men, who had been all night in the rigging. The vessel 'was
the brig Euphemia Fullerton, of Londonderry, bound to that'
port from Maryport with a cargo of coal. She became a total
wreck. '

11. At Holy Island, Northumberland.--We are glad to meet
with the honoured name of Grace Darling, more than one boat
being called after her on the coast where she gained her renown. '
The ketch Mary T weedie, of Berwick, was seen running before
the wind, under bare poles, at 3 P.M., on the 6th March, 1883,
during a fearful; gale of wind from N. to NE. and a very heavy
sea, the whole bar and the sea as far as the eye could reach
being one mass of broken water. The No. I Life-boat, Grace
Darling, was launched, and was more than three hours in
reaching the vessel. The crew pulled bravely until almost
exhausted ; but every time they seemed to be near enough to
throw a line on board, a huge wave Washed them about a
hundred yards astern. This was repeated ten or twelve times
before the life-boat men were able to get a rope fast to the
vessel, after which they took two men into the boat, by means
of the life-buoy, in a very exhausted and numbed condition.
One of the crew had received a blow on the head from a falling
spar, and had died soon afterwards.
in. The next rescue is on the coast of North Wales. On the
morning of the 30th March, 1883, it was reported that abarque
was ashore on Cymeran Beach, with all hands in the fore
rigging, the vessel having sunk, and her mainmast having
been carried away during a heavy S.S.W. gale. The Rhosnei-
gir Life--boat went to her assistance, but being disabled by the
breaking of several rowing crutches, was compelled to return to
the shore, 'one of the boat's crew being also washed overboard
by a heavy sea, and rescued with some difficulty. The Holy-
head Life-boat was then launched, and at about 11 o'clock was
taken in tow by the 5.5. George Eliot to the N.W. of the South
Stack. Here the life-boat was cast off, and proceeded under
canvas until about 12. 30, when she fell in with the steam-tug
Challenger, by which she was towed in the direction of the
stranded vessel. Owing, however, to the heavy sea, the tug
could not go within a mile of the wreck, and the life-boat,
. being obliged to continue her course under oars, made three
fruitless attempts to reach the vessel, owing to the broken
water and the heavy surf. As the wind was rising, and there
was no place to breach the boat, it was obliged to return to
Holyhead. Other unsuccessful attempts-to reach the vessel
were subsequently made by the Rhosneigir Life-boat, but they
failed, and endeavours to rescue the shipwrecked men by
means of the rocket apparatus also proved unavailing. As
the Rhosneigir men were reported to be exhausted by their
exertions, it was suggested that the Holyhead crew should
proceed to Rhosneigir and try to get to the vessel in that
life-boat. An application was accordingly made to the rail-
way authorities for aspecial engine, which was at once granted,
and the Holyhead crew were thus conveyed to the spot nearest
to the wreck. It was now quite dark, and the men had
scarcely any knowledge of the position of hidden rocks on that
coast, but they nevertheless gallantly took the boat out,
succeeded in reaching the wrecked vessel, and in rescuing the
twenty men who were on board.

The Silver Medal of the Institution was presented to
Mr. T. Roberts, coxswain of the Holyhead Life-boat, and the
thanks cf the Institution, inscribed on 'vellum, with an extra
pecuniary reward to each of his crew, in consideration of their
heroic exertions. _

IV. At Seaton Carew, County Durham. ----On the 11th March,
1883, at about 8.30 P.M., , during a violent gale from the N. E.,
accompanied by thick snow-showers-and a very heavy sea,
.signals of distress were exhibited from the Long Scar Rocks
of? this place. The Seaton Carew Life-boat was at once
launched, and proceeded in the direction indicated, but no trace
of any wreck could be found. Henry Hood, the coxswain oi
the Life-boat, and one of the crew named John Franklin, then
determined 'to land on the reef and make a thorough search for
it, as it was impossible to take the Life-boat among the rocks
in the darkness. With much difi'iculty and danger, the sea
breaking heavily over them, and the coxswain on one occasion
being washed 03 the rocks, they at last discovered the wreck,
and being afterwards joined by another of the life-boat men,
Matthew Franklin, they, after many ineffectual attempts,
succeeded in throwing the heaving line over the stern. ' Just
as this was accomplished, Hood heard a voice, and seeing some
dark object in the surf, he rushed into the sea, and, with the
aid of his companions, rescued a man, who proved to be the
mate of the vessel, in a most exhausted condition. They then
hailed the wreck, and the remaining four men, by means of
the communicating line, were got on to the rocks. The .
rescuers and the rescued now made for the life--boat; after a
perilous journey across the rocks, which were being swept by
the sea, they at last reached it, and pulled for the shore, which
was made in safety about half an hour after midnight. The
wrecked vessel was the schooner Aflas, of Drammen, bound
thence to Sunderland. She broke up very soon after the crew
had been resoued. '

Her Majesty the Queen subsequently conferred the decora-
tion of the Albert Medal of the Second Class on Henry Hood,
_ in recognition of his most gallant conduct on this occasion, and

the Institution also awarded its Silver Medal to him, and to
the two Franklins. '

v. We give one other case, which shows the labour often
necessary in reaching the scene of action. On Sunday, the
2 5th November, 1883, 'intelligence was received that a large
foreign barque 'was riding at her anchors off Beachy Head
Lighthouse, in a very dangerous position, with a signal of
distress flying. With as little delay as possible, the crew of
the H/z'lliam and Mary Life-boat were mustered, and the boat, '
mounted on its transporting carriage, started for Birling Gap,
drawn by seven horses. The route taken was through Meads,
where three additional horses were procured, and with this
extra power, she speedily mounted the hill, and crossed the
downs to Birling Gap, a distance altOgether of five miles.
There the boat was obliged to be taken off her carriage, as the
Gap had to be widened to admit even of the passage of the
boat, and the incline was very sharp. The lower part of the
Gap had been washed away by the sea, but this difficulty was
overcome by using some long pieces of timber which were
. fortunately on the spot; Under the superintendence of the

coxswain, the boat was by great exertions got safely down to
the beach, and was launched at 1.15. 'The wind was blewing
a gale from the S.S.W., and a tremendous sea was rolling in.
At about 2 o'clock, after a very hard struggle against the head
sea, the midship oars being double-banked, the vessel was
reached; she was then opposite the Gap, about a mile from
shore, labouring heavily in the seas with two anchors down,
sails torn, and spars carried away. A storm of rain then came
on, and the vessel and life-boat were hidden from the view
of the spectators who lined the elifis. After a period of198 Wreck of the " Indian C/zzef"

suspense, the life-boat was seen making for the shore, and .in
gallant style she took the beach almost close to the spot from
whence she had started, and landed the rescued crew of eleven
men. The life-boat had anchored as close as possible to the
vessel, and the crew were then hauled into her. The poor
fellows, who were in avery exhausted state, one of them
having sustained a fracture of the ribs, were taken to the
Coastguard Station, where they received every attention from
the Chief Officer and the Coastguardmen. The life-boat was
got up the Gap with considerable difficulty, and arrived back
at her station about 7.30. The distressed vessel was the
barque New Brunswick, of Brevig, 480 tons, bound from'Quebec
to West Hartlepool with a cargo'of timber.

WRECK or me "lNDXAN CHIEF," AND GALLANT RESCUE-SERVICES
or THE RAMSGATE LIFE-BOAT, THE " BRADFORD." '

In the Life-Boat journal for February 1881, we find a full
report of the wreck of the Indian Chief, and of the rescue of the
survivors of the crew by the Ramsgate Life-boat, the Bradford.
This report seems to have been chiefly gathered from the mate
of the wrecked ship, and from the coxswain of the Life-boat, by
the correspondent of the Daily Telegraph, who visited the place

_soon after the events narrated. It is not the first time that the
gallant services of the Ramsgate boatmen have been con-
spicuous. Their station is one of the most important on all
our coasts, and the wreck-chart shows how often help is
needed in that region of the northern seas. . In a letter from
Mr. Braine, the harbour-master, special testimony is borne to
their services on the present occasion. He says :--

" Of all the meritorious services performed by the Ramsgate
tug and life-boat, I consider this one of the best. The
decision the coxswain and crew arrived- at to remain till -day-'
light, which was in eifect to continue for fourteen hours cruising
about with the sea continually breaking over them in a heavy
gale and tremendous sea, proves, Iconsider, their gallantry and
determination to do their duty.nxlu.' ... 1:". "nuns mm. as>> <<mm, 0>> 1n: "awn. mm". Um ..,s.Wreck oft/2a "1mm C/zz'qf" _ :99

" The coxswain and crew of the life-boat speak in the highest
terms of her good qualities ; they state that _when sailing across
the 'Long Sand,' after leaving the wreck, the .seas were
tremendous, and the boat behaved most admirably. Some of
the shipwrecked crew have since stated that they were fearful,
on seeing the frightful-looking seas they were passing through,
that they were in more danger in the life-boat than when
lashed to the mast of their sunken ship, as they thought it
impossible for any boat to live through such a sea."

It was during the night of the 5th January, 1881, that the tid-
ings reached Ramsgate that a large ship had gone ashore on the
Long Sand; From Aldborough, in Sufi'olk, from Clacton and
from Harwich in Essex, where signals or messages had also
reached, the life--boats put ofi' to the scene of danger, but none
of these succeeded in reaching the wreck. - Happily the
Bradford boat, of Ramsgate, persevered amidst difficulties, hard-
ships, and dangers, rarely surpassed in the service, and had
the reward of saving eleven of the crew, who were nearly
perishing, after exposure for nearly thirty hours, in bitterly
cold weather. The following is the account given by Mr. W.
Meldrum Lloyd, the second oflicer of the ship. The captain
andsixteen of the crew perished that night.

THE MATE'S ACCOUNT.

Our ship was the Indian Chief, of 1,238 tons register; our
skipper's name was Fraser, and we were bound, with a
general cargo, to Yokohama, in Japan. There were twenty-
4 nine souls on board, counting the North-country pilot. We
were four days out from Middlesborough, but it had been thick

. weather ever since the afternoon of the Sunday on which We
sailed. All had gone well with us, hOWever, so far, and
on Wednesday morning, at half-past two, we made the Knock
Light. The water is here just a netwark of shoals; for to the
southward lies the Knock, and close over against it stretches
the Long Sand, and beyond, down to the westward, is the Sunk
Sand. -.- 200 Wrece of Me 1mm Citz'ef"

Shortly after the Knock Light had hove in sight, the wind
shifted to the eastward and brought a squall of rain. We
were under'all plain sail at the .time,'with the exception of
the royals, which were furled, and the mainsail that hung in
the buntlines. The Long Sand was to leeward, and finding
that we were drifting that way the order was given to put the
ship about. It was very dark, the wind breezing up sharper
and sharper, and cold as death: The helm was put down, but
the main braces fouled, and before they could be cleared the
vessel had missed stays and was in irons. We then went to
work to wear the ship, but there was much confusion, the
vessel heeling over, and all of us knew' that the Sands
were close aboard. The ship paid off, but at 'a critical
moment, the spanker-boom sheet fouled the wheel; still, we
_ managed to get the vessel round, but scarcely were the braces

belayed and the 'ship on the starboard tack, when she struck
the ground broadside on. She was a soft-wood built ship, and

she trembled, as though she would go to pieces at once like a
pack of cards. - Sheets and halliards were let go, but no man
durst venture aloft. Every moment threatened to bring the
spars crushing about us, and the thundering and beating of the
canvas made the masts buckle and jump like fishing~rods.

- We then kindled a great flare and sent up rockets, and our
signalswere answered by the Sunk Lightshipand the Knock. We
could see one another's faces in the light of the big blaze, and

y sung out cheerily to keep our hearts up; and, indeed, although
we all knew that our ship was hard and fast and likely to leave
her bones on that sand, we none of us reckoned upon dying.
The sky had cleared, the easterly wind made the stars sharp
'and' bright, and it was comforting to watch the lightships' _
rockets rushing up and bursting into smoke and sparks over
our heads, for they made us see that our position was known,
and they were as good as an assurance that help would come
along soon, and that we need not lose heart. But all this
'while the wind was gradually sweeping up into a gale--and
oh, the bitter cold of that wind I
It seemed as long as a month before the morning broke, and
just before the grey grew broad in the sky, one'of the- men
yelled out something, and then came sprawling and splashing
slit to tell us that he had caught sight of the sail of a life-boat
dodging among the heavy seas. It was not a life-boat, but a
fishing-smack, which after vain efforts to come' near us, probably
took the news to Harwich. She was a: good distance away,
and she stood on and off, on and of, never coming closer, and
evidently shirking the huge seas which were now boiling
around us. At last she hauled her sheet aft, put her helm
over, and went away. One of our crew groaned, but no other
man uttered a sound, and we returned to the shelter of the
deckhouses.

Though the gale was not at its height when the sun rose, it
was not far 'from it. We plucked up spirits again when the
sun shot' out of the raging sea, but as we lay broadside on to
the waves, the sheets of flying water soon made the sloping
"decks a dangerous place for a man to stand on, and the crew
and officers kept the shelter of the deck-cabins, though the
captain and his brother and I were constantly going out to see.
if any help was coming. But now the flood was making, and
'this was a fresh and fearful danger, as we all knew, for at
sunrise the water had been too low to knock the ship out of
her sandy bed, but as the tide rose it lifted the vessel, bumping
and straining her frightfully. The pilot advised the skipper to
let go the starboard anchor, hoping that the set of the tide
would slue the ship's stern round, and make her lie head on.
to the seas ; so the anchor was dropped, but it did not alter the
position of the ship.

To know what the cracking and straining of that vessel was
like, as bit by bit she slowly went to pieces; you must have
been aboard of her. When she broke her back a sort of panic
seized many of us, and the captain roared out to the men to
get the boats over, and see if any use could be made of them.
Three boats were launched, but the second boat, with two
hands in her, went adrift, and was instantly engulphcd, and
the poor fellows in her vanished just as you might blow out' a
light. The other boats filled as soon as they touchedthe water.
There was no help for us in that way, and again we withdrew
to the cabins. A little before five o'clock in the 'afternoon a
huge sea swept over the vessel, clearing the decks fore and
aft, and leaving little but the uprights of the deck-houses
standing. It was a dreadful sea, but we knew worse was
behind it, and that we must climb the rigging if we wanted to
prolong our lives. The hold was already full of water, and .
portions of the deck had been blown out, so that everywhere
great yawning gulfs met the eye, with the black water washing
almost flush. Some of the men made for the fore-rigging, but
the captain shouted to all hands to take to the mizenmast, as .
that one, in his opinion, was the securest. A number of the '
men who were scrambling forward returned on hearing the
captain sing out, but the rest held on and gained the foretop.
Seventeen of us got over the mizentop, and with our knives
fell to hacking away at such running gear as we could come at
to serve as lashings. None of us touched the mainmast, for
we all knew, now the ship had broken her back, that that spar
was doomed, and the reason why the captain had called to the-
men to come aft was because he was afraid that>> when the
mainmast went it would drag the foremast, that rocked in its
step with every move, with it.

I was next the captain in the mizentop, and near him was
his brother, a stout-built, handsome young fellow, twenty-two
years old, as fine a specimen of the English sailor as ever I
was shipmate with. He was calling about him cheerfully,
bidding us not to be down-hearted, and telling us-to look sharply
around for the life-boats. He helped several of. the benumbcd
men to lash themselves, saying encouraging things to them as
'he made them fast. As the sun sank the wind grew more
freezing, and I saw the strength of some of the men leaving
them fast. The captain shook hands with me, and, on the
chance of my being saved, gave me some messages to take
home. He likewise handed me his watch and chain, and I putWreck of Me 'lna'zazz Chief." 203

them in my pocket. The canvas streamed in ribbons from the
yards, and the noise was like a continuous roll of thunder
overhead. It was dreadful to look down and watch the decks
ripping up, and notice how every sea that rolled over the
wreck left less of her than it found.

The moon went quickly away--it was a young moon with
little power--but the white water and the starlight kept the V
night from being black, and the frame of the vessel stood out
like a sketch done in ink every time the dark seas ran clear of
her and left her visible upon the foam. .There' was no talking,
no calling to one another; the men hung in the topmast rigging
like corpses, and I noticed the second mate to windward of his
brother in the top, sheltering him, as best he could, poor
fellow, with his body from the wind that went through our
skins like shOWers of arrows. On a sudden I took it into my
head to fancy that the mizenmast wasn't so secure as the
foremast. It came into my mind like a fright, and I called to
the captain that I meant to make for the foretop. ' Idon't
know whether he heard me or whether he made any answer.
Maybe it was asort of craze of mine for the moment, but I was
wild with eagerness to leave that mast as soon as ever I began
to fear for it. I cast my lashings adrift and gave a look at the
deck, and saw that I must not go that way if I did not want to'
be drowned. So, I climbed into the crosstrees, and swung
myself on to the stay, so reaching the maintop, and then 1
scrambled on to the maintopmast crosstrees, and went hand Over
hand down the topmast stay into the foretop. Had I reflected
before I left the mizentop, I should not have believed that I
had the' strength to work my way for'rards like that; my
hands felt as if they were skinned and my finger-joints
appeared to have no use in them. There were nine or ten
men in the foretop, all lashed and huddled together. The
mast rocked sharply, and the throbbing of it to the blowing of
the great tatters of canvas was a horrible sensation.

From time to time they sent up rockets from the Sunk
lightship--once every hour, I think--but we had long 'smce
ceased to notice those signals. There .was not a man but '
thought his time was come, and, though death seemed terrible
when I looked ,downupon the boiling waters below, yet the
anguish of the cold almost killed the craving for life. It was
now about'three o'clock on Thursday morning; the air was
'full of the strange, dim light of the foam and the stars, and I
could very plainly see the black swarm of men in the top and
rigging of the mizenmast. I was looking that way, when a
great sea fell upon the hull of the ship with a fearful crash; a
moment after, the- mainmast went. It fell quickly, and, as it
fell, it bore down the mizenmast. There was a horrible noise
of splintering wood and some piercing cries, and then another
great sea swept over the after--deck, and we who were in the
foretop looked and saw the stumps of the two masts sticking
up from the bottom of the hold, the mizenmast slanting over
the bulwarks into the water, and the men lashed to it drowning.
There never was a more shocking sight, and 'the wonder is
that some of us who saw it did not go raving mad. The
foremast still stood, complete to the royal mast and all the
yards across, but every instant I expected to find myself
hurling through the air. By this time the ship was completely
gutted, the upper partof her a mere frame of ribs, and the gale
still blew furiously, indeed, I gave up hope when the mizen-
mast fell, and I saw my shipmates drowning on it.

It Was half an hour after this that a man, who was jammed
close against me, pointed out into the darkness and cried in a
wild hoarse voice, " Isn't that a steamer's light '2'" Ilooked,
but what with grief and suffering and cold, I was .nearly
blinded and could see nothing. But presently another man
called out that he could see a light, and this was echoed by yet -
another; so I told them to keep their eyes upon it and watch
if it moved. They said by-and- -by that it was stationary , and '
though we could not guess that it meant anything good for 4
us, yet this light heaving in sight and our talking of it gave
' us some comfort. When the dawn broke we saw the smoke
of a steamer, and agreed it was her light we had seen ; but I.
made nothing of that smoke, and was looking heart-brokenly
'at the mizenmast and the cluster of drowned men washing
about it, when a loud cry made me turn my head, and then I -
saw a life-boat under a reefed foresail heading direct for us.
It was a sight, sir, to make one crazy with joy, and it put the
strength of ten men into every one of us. A mah named
Gillmore stood up and waved a long strip of canvas. ButI
believe they had seen there were living men aboard us before
that signal was made. i

The boat had to cross the broken water to fetch us, and in
my agony of mind I cried out, " She'll never face it! She'll
leave us when she sees that water i " forthe sea was frightful all
to windward of the Sand and over it, a tremendous play of
broken waters, raging one with another, and making thelwhole
surface resemble a boiling cauldron. Yet they never swerved
a hair's breadth. Oh, sir, she was a noble boat! We could
see her crew--twelve of them--sitting on the thwarts, all
looking our way, motidnless as carved figures, and there was
not a stir among 'them as, in an instant, the boat leapt from
the crest of a towering sea right "into the monstrous broken
tumble. The peril' of these men, who were risking their lives
'for ours, made us forget our own situation. Over and over
again the boat was buried, but as regularly- did she ,emerge', I
with her crew fixedly looking our way, and their oilskins and
the light-coloured side of the boat sparkling in the sunshine,
while the coxswain, leaning forward from the helm, watched
our ship with a face of iron. By this time we knew that this
boat was here to save us, and that she would save us, and,
with wildly beating hearts, we unlashed ourselves, and dropped
over the top into the rigging. We were all sailors, you see,
and knew what the life-boat men wanted, and what was to
be done. Swift as thought we had bent a number of ropes'
ends together, and securing a piece of wood to this line, threw
it overboard, and let it drift to the boat. It was seized, a
hawser made fast, and we dragged the great rope on board. .
By means .of this hawser the life-boat men hauled their craft
under our quarter, clear of the raflle. But there was no such
rush made for her as might be thought. No! I owe it to my
shipmates to say this. Two of them shinned out upon the
mizenmast to the body of the second mate, that was lashed
eight or nine feet away over the side, and got, him into the
boat before they entered it themselves. I heard the coxswain
of the boat--Charles Fish by name, the fittest man in the
world for that berth and this work--cry out, " Take that poor
fellow in there!" and _he pointed to the body of the captain,
who was lashed in the top with his arms over the mast, and
his head erect and his eyes wide open. But one of our crew
called out, " He's been dead four hours, sir," and then the rest
of us scrambled into the boat, looking away from the dreadful
group of drowned men that lay in a cluster round the prostrate
mast. The second mate was still alive, but a maniac; it
was heartbreaking to hear his broken, feeble cries for
his brother, but he lay quiet after a bit, and died in half
an hour, though we chafed his feet and poured rum into
his mouth, and did what men in our miserable plight could
for a fellow-sufferer. Nor were we out of danger yet, for
the broken water was enough to turn a man's hair grey to
look at. - It was a fearful sea for us men to find ourselves in
the midst of, after having looked at it from a great height, and
Ifelt at the beginning almost as though I should have been
safer on the wreck than in that boat. Never could I have
believed that so small a vessel could meet such a sea and live.
Yet she rose like a duck to the great roaring waves which
fOIIOWed her, draining every drop of water from her bottom
as she was hove up, and falling with terrible suddenness into
a hollow, only to bound like a living thing-to the summit of
the next gigantic crest.

When I looked at the life-boat's crew and thought of .our
situation a short while since, and our safety now, and how to
rescue us these great-hearted men had imperilled their own
lives, I was unmanned ; I could not thank them, I could not
trust myself to speak. They told us they had left RamsgateWm/e of the "1mm Clzi'ef." 207

harbour early on the preceding afternoon, and had fetched the
Knock at dusk, and not seeing our wreck had lain to in that
- raging sea, suffering almost as severely as ourselves, all through
the piercing tempestuous night. What do you think of such
a service, sir ? How can such devoted heroism be written of,
so that every man who can read shall know how great and
beautiful it is? Our own sufferings came to us as a part of
our calling as seamen. But theirs was bravely courted and
endured for the sake of their fellow-creatures. Believe me,
sir, it was a splendid piece of service; nothing grander in its
way was ever done before, even by Englishmen. I am a plain
seaman, and can say no more about it all than this. But
when I think of what must have come to us eleven men before
another hour had passed, if the lifeboat crew had not run
down to us, I feel like a little child, sir, and -my heart grows
too full for my eyes.

The facts of the foregoing statement 'were no doubt given in
detail by the mate, but the narrative owes muth of its graphic
power to the newspaper writer, from whose report of the work
done by the life-boat we add some extracts : _

Two days had elapsed (continues the writer in the Daily

' Telegraph) since the rescue of the survivors of the crew of the
Indian Chief; and I was gazing with much interest at the
victorious life-boat as she lay motionless upon the water of
the harbour. It was a very calm day, the sea stretching from
the pier-sides as smooth as a piece of green silk, and growing
vague in the wintry haze of the horizon, while the white clifi's
were brilliant with the silver sunshine. It filled the mind
with strange and moving thoughts to look at that sleeping
life-boat, with her image as sharp as a coloured photograph
shining in the clear water under her, and then reflect upon the
furious conflict she had been concerned in only two nights
before, the freight of half-drowned men that had loaded her,
the dead body on her thwart, the bitter cold of the howling
gale, the deadly peril that had attended every heave of the208 sza of the "1mm C'fiz'ef".

huge black seas. Within a few hundred yards of her lay the
tug, the sturdy steamer that had towed her to the Long Sand,
that had held her astern all night, and brought her back safe
on the following afternoon. The tug had suffered much from
the frightful tossing she had received, and her injuries had not
yet been dealt with; she had lost her sponsons, her starboard
side-house was gone, the port side of her bridge had been
started, and the iron railing warped, h'er decks still seemed
dank from the remorseless washing, her funnel was browned
with rust, andthe tough craft looked a hundred years old.
Remembering what these vessels had gone through,-how they
had but two days since topped a long series of merciful and
dangerous errands by as brilliant an act of heroism'- and
humanity as any on record, it was difficult to behold them
without a quickened pulse. I recalled the coming ashore of
their crews, the life-boatmen with their great cork jackets around '
them, the steamer's men in streaming oilskins, the faces of
many of them livid with the cold, their eyes dim with the
bitter vigil they had kept, and the furious blowing of the spray ;
and I remembered the bright smile that here and there lighted
up the weary faces,,as first one and then another caught sight
of a wife or a sister in the crowd waiting to greet and accom-
pany the brave hearts to the warmth of their humble homes.
I felt that while these crews' sufferings and the courage and
resolution they had shown remained unwritten, only half of a
very stirring 'and manful story had, been recorded. The
narrative by the coxswain of the life-boat,'Charles Fish, is
given with great detail in the same number of the Life-Boat
~ lournal, but we have space only for the concluding para-
graphs.

We,lay to all night, .despite the bitter cold and fierte seas,
that we might be at hand when the dawn would show where
she was. The morning had only just broke, and the light was
grey and dim, and down in the west it still seemed to be
night; the air was full of spray, and scarcely were we a-top
of a sea than we were rushing like an arrow into the hollow
again, when young Tom Cooper bawled out, " There she is l " '
pointing with his hand. The moment he sung out and pointed,

all hands cried out, "There she isl " But what was it, sir?
Only a mast about three miles off--just one single mast sticking
up out of the white water. Yet that was the ship we had been

Waiting all night to see. There she was, and my heart thumped

in my ears the moment my eye fell on that mast. " Up fore-

sail," I shouted, and two minutes after we had sighted that
mast we were dead before the wind, our storm foresail taut
as a drum-skin, our boat's stem heading full for the broken
seas and the lonely stranded vessel in the midst of them. It
was well that there was something in front of us to keep our
eyes that way, and that none of us thought of looking astern, or

the sight of the high and frightful seas which raged after us

might have unnerved the stoutest hearts. Some of them

came with such force that they leapt right over the boat, and .
the air was dark with water flying a dozen yards high over us
in broad solid sheets, which fell with a roar. But we_took no
notice of these seas even when we were in the thick of the
broken waters, and all the. hands holding on to the thwarts for
dear. life. Every thought was upon the mast that was growing
bigger and clearer, and sometimes when a sea hove us high we
could just see the hull, with the water as white as milk'flying
over it. The mast was what they called " bright," that is
scraped and varnished, and we knew that if there was anything
living aboard that doomed ship we should find it on that mast;

and we strained our eyes with all our might, but could see
nothing that looked like a man.

But on a sudden I caught sight of a length of canvas stream-
ing out of the top, and all of us seeing it we raised a shout, and
a few minutes after we saw the men. They were all dressed in
yellow oilskins, and the mast being of that colour was the reason
why we did not see them sooner. They looked a whole mob of
people, and one of us roared out, " All hands are there, men 1"
and I answered, " Aye, the whole ship's company, and we'll
have them all i" for though, as we afterwards knew, there were

14
only eleven of them, yet, as I have said, they looked a great
number huddled together in that top, and I made sure the whole
ship's company were there. By this time we were pretty close
to the ship, and a fearful wreck she looked, with her mainmast
and mizenmast gone, and her bulwarks washed away, and
great lumps of timber and planking ripping out of her and going
overboard with every pour of the seas. We let go our anchor
fifteen fathoms to windward of her, and as we did so we saw
the poor fellows unlashing themselves and dropping one by one
over the top into the lee rigging. As we veered out cable and
drove down under her stern, I shouted to the men on the wreck
to bend a piece of wood on to a line and throw it overboard for
us to lay hold of. They did this, but they had to get aft first,
and I feared for the poor half-perished creatures again and
again _as I saw them scrambling along the lee rail, stopping and
holding on as the mountainous seas swept over the hull, and
then creeping a bit further aft in the pause. There was a
horrible muddle of spars and torn canvas and rigging under
her lee, but we could not guess what a fearful sight was there
until our hawser having been made fast to the wreck, we had
hauled the life-boat close under her quarter. There looked to be
a whole score of dead bodies knocking about among the spars.
It stunned me for a moment, for I had thought all hands were
in the foretop, and never dreamt of so many lives having been
lost. Seventeen were drowned, and there they were, most of
them, and the body of the captain lashed to the head of the
mizenmast, so as to look as if he were leaning over it, his head
stiff upright and his eyes watching us, and the stir of the seas
made him appear to be struggliiig to get to us. I thought he
was alive, and cried to the men to hand him in, but someone
said he was killed when the mizenmast fell, and had been dead
four or five hours.

Well, sir, the rest of this lamentable story has been told by
the mate of the vessel, and I don't know that I could add any-
thing to it. We saved the eleven men, and I have since heard
that all of them are doing well. If I may speak, as coxswainTke 'Y'aI/ezhg Wood C/zzjfi. 211

this rescue, them in the tug as well as the crew of the boat. did
what might be expected of English sailors--for such they are,
whether you call some of them boatmen or not; and I know in .
my heart, and say it without fear, that from the hour of leaving
Ramsgate Harbour to the moment when we sighted the wreck's
mast, there was only one thought in all of us, and that was that .

THE TALKING WOOD CHIP.

AN INCIDENT OF EARLY MISSIONARY DAYS IN RAROTONGA. .

MONG the islands of the Pacific Ocean there is no one
which has been more wonderfully transformed, by the
influence of Christian missions, than Rarotonga, in the Hervey
Island group. This group was formerly called Cook's Islands,
having been first brought to notice by the great navigator, who
arrived at the adjoining island of Mangaia in .March 1777.
.Rarotonga was not known till long afterwards, and the first
missionary who planted the gospel there was John Williams,
"the martyr of Erromango."

We have heard much of these Hervey Islands in recent
times from the letters and books of the Rev. W. Wyatt Gill,
one of the most accomplished as well as devoted of the many

' noble missionaries who have spent their 1ives~in spreading
'peace and true happiness in these distant isles of the sea.
In the Hervey group, pagan idolatry, with all its horrible
crimes and cruelties, has long ceased to exist. The savage is
now completely civilized. The bulk of the population read the
word of God intelligently in their own tongue. A large
- number are members of churches, the young are taught in
schools, and the natives help, by their industry and trade, to212 The Tax/mg Wooar C/iz'p.

send the gospel to islands less favoured. Such is the result of
the good work of which the Rev. John Williams was the pioneer.
From the "Narrative of a Missionary Enterprise in the South
Sea Islands," the book in which Williams first 'published a
record of his work in connection with the London Missionary
Society, we give a description of some of his early experiences
in Rarotonga. After a period of absence, native teachers
having been left in charge of the converts, he returned to visit
the station. _
We found, he says, the teachers and people just about to aban-
don the old settlement, a new one having been formed on the
eastern side of the island. As the Thursday after our arrival
was the day appointed for the removal, we determined not to
interfere with this or any other arrangement, until, by a more
accurate acquaintancewith the affairs of the station, we should
be enabled to take the arrangement of the Mission into our
own hands. On Wednesday afternoon we attended service,
when one of the teachers addressed the assembly; after which,
the multitude gave us a welcome by a hearty shake of the
hand. As there were' between two and three thousand of
them, and they considering that the sincerity of their affection

:was to be expressed by the severity of the squeeze, and the-

violence of the shake, we were not sorry when the ceremony
.was over, for our arms ached severely for hours after. _ Early
the following morning, with nearly the whole of the inhabitants
of the island, We proceeded to the new station, to which we
found but little difficulty in getting our things'conveyed, as
every person was desirous of carrying some part of our
property. One took the tea-kettle, another the frying-pan;
some obtained a box, others a bedpost ; even the chief himself
felt honoured in rendering assistance, and during the journey
he ceased not to manifest his admiration of the devices printed
upon the articles of earthenware with which he Was entrusted,
and to exhibit them to the crowd that surrounded him.

A heavy fall of rain had rendered the ordinary road unfit
for travelling, or otherwise the walk would have been delight-T be. Talkmg Wood C/zz'p. 2 I 3

ful ; but as the kind people conveyed goods, wives and children,
upon their Herculean shoulders, all delighted with their
occupation, the journey was by no' means-unpleasant. ,
On our arrival, we found that the teachers had very
comfortable houses, one of which they most cheerfully gave
up to us. A day or two afterwards, they requested us to take
our seat outside the door; and on doing so, we observed a
large concourse of people coming towards us, bearing heavy
'burdens. They walked in procession, and dropped at our
feet fourteen immense idols, the smallest of which was' about
'five yards in length. Each of these was composed of .a Piece
of aito, or iron wood, about four inches in diameter, carved
with rude imitations of the human head at one end, and with
an obscene figure at the other, wrapped round with native
cloth, until it became two or three yards in circumference.
Near the wood were red feathers, and a string of small pieces
of polished pearl shells, which were said to be the manava, or
soul of the god. Some of these idols were torn to pieces before
our eyes; others were reserved to decorate the rafters of the
chapel we proposed to erect ; and one was kept to be sent to
England, which is now in the Missionary Museum. It is not,
however, so respectable in appearance as when in its own
country ; for the Custom House officers in London,'fearing'lest I
the god should be made a vehicle for defrauding the revenue,
very unceremoniously took it to pieces; and not being so well
skilled in making gods as in protecting the revenue, they have
not made it so handsome-as when it was an object of veneration
to the deluded Rarotongans. An idol was placed upon the fore
part of every fishing canoe ; and when the natives were going
on a fishing excursion, prior to setting off, they invariably
presented offerings to the god, and invoked him to grant
them success. Surely professing Christians may learn a lesson
from this practice. Here we see pagans of the lowest order
imploring the blessing of their gods upon their ordinary occupa-

On the following Sabbath, a congregation of about four thou~2I4 'T/ze Talezng Wood C/zzp.

sand assembled; but as the house was a temporary building, and
would not accommodate half the people, they took their seats
outside. This induced us to determine to erect immediately a
place of worship. With this view the chiefs and people were
convened, and arrangements made for commencing the
building; and so great was the diligence with which the people
laboured, that although ill supplied with tools, the house was
thoroughly completed in two months. It was onehundred
and fifty feet in length, and sixty wide; well plastered, and
fitted up throughout with seats. It had six large folding-doors.
The front windows were made in imitation of sashes, whilst
those in the back resembled Venetian blinds. It was a large,
respectable, and substantial building ; and the whole was
completed without a single nail, or any iron-work whatever.
It will accommodate nearly three thousand persons.

In the erection of this chapel, a circumstance occurred
which will give a striking idea of the feelings of an untaught
people, when observing for the first time the effects of Written
communications. AsI had come to the work one morning
without my square, I took up a chip, and with a piece of
charcoal -wrote upon it a request that Mrs. Williams would send
me that article. I called a chief who was superintending his
portion of the work, and said to him, " Friend, take this; go
to our house, and give it to Mrs. Williams." He was a singular-
looking man, remarkably quick in his movements, and had
been a great warrior: but, in one of the numerous battles he
had fought, had lost an eye, and giving me an inexpressiblc
look with the other, he said, "Take that 1 she will call me a
fool and scold me, if I carry a chip to her." " No," I replied,
'" she will not, take it, and go'immediately ; I am in haste."
Perceiving me to be in earnest, he took it, and asked, "What
must I say ? " I replied, "You have nothing to say, the chip
will say allI wish." With a look of astonishment and con-
tempt, he held up the piece of 'wood, and said, " How can
this speak? Has this a mouth ?" I desired him to take it
immediately, and not spend so much time in talking about it.Easter/Le, the Negro Slave. 215

On arriving at the house, he gave the~chip to Mrs. Williams,
who read it, threw it down, and went to the tool-chest;
whither the chief, resolving to see the result of this mysterious
proceeding, followed her closely. On receiving the square
from her, he said, " Stay, daughter, how do you know that
this'is what Mr. Williams wants ?" " Why," she replied, " did
you not bring me a chip just now ?" " Yes," said the astonished
warrior, " but Idid not hear it say anything." "If you did
not,l did," was the reply, "for it made known to me what
he wanted, and all. you have to do is to return with it as
quickly as possible." With this the chief leaped out of the
house ; and catching up the mysterious piece of wood, he ran
through the settlement with the chip in one hand and the
square in the other, holding them up as high as his arms would '
reach, and shouting as he went, "See the wisdom of these
English people; they can make chips talk! They can make
chips talkl" On giving me the square, he wished to know
how it was possible thus to converse with persons at a dis-
tance. I gave him all the explanation in my power; but
it was a circumstance involved in so much mystery, that he
actually tied a string to the chip, hung it round his neck, and .
wore it for some time. During several following days, we fre-
quently saw him surrounded by a crowd, who were listening
with intense interest while he narrated the wonders which this
chip had performed.

EUSTACHE, THE NEGRO SL'AVE.

USTACHE was born in the year 1778, on the estate of

M. Belin de Villeneuve, a planter in the northern dis-

trict of the island of St. Domingo, now known as the Republic
of Hayti. During his childhood he seemed indifferent to the
society of the young negroes, and eagerly sought that of the
whites. This did not proceed from any servility of disposition,
~ but evidently from the desire to avail himself of the advantage
to be gained from intercourse with those above him in intelli-
gence. His shrewdness and integrity induced his master to
place him in the service of the overseers employed in. the
sugar-house, where he conducted himself in so unexceptionable
a manner, that never was it found necessary to inflict even the
slightest punishment on him ; and while he gained the regards
of his master by his good behaviour, he also contrived to
acquire daily that influence which is the result of superior
intelligence over the negroes of his own, as well as the
adjoining, plantations.

During the time M. Belin was travelling in Europe,'symptoms
of revolution began to be exhibited in St. Domingo. Eustache
was at this time about nineteen years old, and then did he
commence that course of noble disinterestedness which became
a habit with him through' life. Even at this early period of his
life, the negroes who had revolted possessed such unbounded
confidence in him, as to reveal to him their projects, and admit
him into all their councils. He madeapoint of turning to good
account the information he thus received, and by his address
on one occasion, saved the' lives of four hundred whites from
being massacred by his infuriated countrymen. . 4

About this time of tumult, M. Belin returned to St. Domingo.
His faithful negro received him with joy, and advised him to
take up his abode for safety near>> the sugar-work, where he
had taken the precaution of providing provisions, at his own
cost, with the knowledge of those blacks in whom he could

. repose confidence. Thus through the fidelity of Eustache, his
master enjoyed a security and comfort unknown to the other
proprietors in those troubled times.

At length a favourable occasion seemed to offer of obtaining
deliverance from these dangers. An American vessel touched
at the neighbouring coast, and after a consultation with his
master,' Eustache lost no time in agreeing with the captain to
receive M. Belin on board during night. Another preliminary
' required to be settled : none of his master's property could atEustac/ze, Me Negro Shoe. _ . 217

the 'moment be converted into money, and he could not leave
home a beggar. Here the ingenuity of his faithful slave sup-
plied a remedy for the evil: he collected the negroes of the
estate, and appealed in the most feeling manner to their
humanity; he succeeded beyond expectation, and, out of five
hundred who were present, three hundred and sixty-five agreed
to contribute a supply 01 white suga1: so that in a short time
M. Belin was owner of a good cargo While tears of gratitude
flowed down the master's cheek, and he in vain tried to express
his gratitude, his faithful friend declared that the only return
he asked was permission to accompany him, and to share, if he
could not alleviate, the sorrows that might await him.

The plan seemed to prosper; but, alas! they had scarcely-
been two days on board, when their vessel was seized by
English privateers. How shall we describe the anguish of
Eustache,--his master a prisoner, and deprived of all the re-
sources it had cost him so much trouble to collect! But his
motto seemed to be," Never Despair." Difficulty seemed but to
call forth his energies the more. Happily for him, he was a pro-
ficient in cookery, and it occurred to him, that he might turn
this to account in gaining the good graces of the captains of the
vessels. He succeeded beyond his expectation. Every day-he
produced some new dish, which seemed more relished than the
last; and by-and-by he became such afavourite that they were
almost disposed to prolong their voyage, so much did they enjoy
feasting on the good things provided by the skilful Eustache.

They went on thus for some time, when an opportunity
occurred too favourable not to be embraced for effecting their
escape.- It was agreed betwixt the American captain and
Eustache, that an attempt should be made to regain their liberty
by seizing 'the privateering ships, which were not strongly
manned. Accordingly, one afternoon when they had feasted
and drank in abundance, and were probably drinking Eustache's'
health, with three times three, the signal for a general move-
ment on the part-of the American seamen was made. The
brave Eustache was foremost in the fray; he attacked them218 , , Eusttzc/ze, t/ze Negro Slaw.

sword in hand. The captain also distinguished himself by his
valour. Little resistance was made; and in a short time the
English sailors were overpowered and made prisoners. The
captain resumed the command of his own vessel, proceeded to
Baltimore, his original place of destination, carrying along with
him the ships which they had so gallantly captured.

Here M. Belin and his deliverer found many of the wretched
inhabitants of St. Domingo, who had formerly been in opulent.
circumstances, reduced to the utmost necessity. The wit-
nessing such scenes by the benevolent slave, took away from
the pleasure he would otherwise have enjoyed in the improved
situation of his master. The sugar had been sold to advantage,
and the proceeds were a little fortune to them. Eustache
engaged in a little commercial undertaking for the benefit of
the necessitons friends of his master; and never did a day pass
over his head in which the_little produceof his labours did not
help to relieve the sorrows of the poor and destitute.

The state of St. Domingo seemed to become more tranquil.
and the fugitives ventured home. Scarcely, however, had they
arrived, when a new insurrection arose, and a massacre of five
hundred whites took place at one time. M. Belin was of the
number of those who barely escaped with their lives; he was
-' separated from his friend, and owed his safety to the protection
of a Spanish captain, who happened to recognise him. Eustache
anxiously sought his master, but without success; he continued
<<to hope that Providence would some time throw them together;
and in the meantime, in order to secure his trunks and a
valuable chest of silver plate, he gave them into the custody of
the wife of Jean Francois, a negro who stood high in the esteem
of- his companion. After placing the goods in safety, he went
to the scene of carnage, and made a search for his beloved
master's body, trembling lest he should discover him among the
slain. He soon after learned at the Spanish 'fort, that M. Belin
had been seen embarking in a sloop for the Mole of St. Nicholas,
then occupied by the English. He determined immediately to
rejoin him ; but made the disagreeable discovery that the lady
to whom M. Belin's effects had been consigned was rather in-
disposed to part with them. Here a new exercise of ingenuity
was requisite: he engaged himself as a sick nurse during an
illness she had, waited on her for some time with the utmost
assiduity, and one night, when she was sound asleep, assisted
by some friendly negroes, he succeeded in carrying ofi' what
now constituted all his master's worldly wealth.

The arrival of Eustache at the Mole was celebrated like a fete.
M. Belin had spread the report ofihis heroic devotedness; and
such was the public estimation in .which he was held, that he
was borne into the town as the hero of a triumphal procession,
in honour of his noble and disinterested conduct.

M. Belin soon after went to Port-au-Prince, where he was
appointed president of the privy council. Here Eustache,
restored to domestic life, engaged himself in_ providing a
mansion suited to his master's new dignity ; and little was that
master aware that the luxuries and comforts he enjoyed in such
profusion were the fruits of Eustache's daily labour. His free-
dom was at this time bestowed on him ; but in this case freedom
and slavery were but names; he remained the same faithful
servant as ever.

Some time after, M. Belin was afflicted with sleeplessness
and weakness of the eyes; and he one day incidentally ex-
pressed 2 regret that Eustache had not been taught to read in
his youth, as it would have been an agreeable way of beguiling

,the time to have him to read aloud occasionally. Without
saying a word to his master, he immediately went and hired
an instructor; and, to prevent his lessons interfering with his
other duties, he fixed four in the morning as his hour for study.
Three months after, he approached his master with a news-
paper in his hand, and, to his surprise and delight, began to
read with the utmost fluency. What a remarkable instance of
willingness and perseverance, and at the same time, of that
delicate attention to the wishes of another, which one would
think the refinement of woman alone could have suggested]

By a change in the government of St. Domingo, M. Belin had22o . Eustac/ze, 21;; .Negro Slave.

his property once more restored to him. The arrival of General
Leclerc, however, again excited the indignation of the blacks,
and a scene of tumult ensued, when Eustache once more saved
the life of his master. He had by this time become blind
and 'very feeble, and the care of his faithful domestic could not
ward off the stroke of the last enemy. He expired in the arms
of one who had shown to him more than a father or a brother's'
love.

That M. Belin was not unmindful of his fidelity and regard;
he proved, by leaving his property, in money as well as move-
ables, to his most faithful friend. .

Though deeply afflicted, the benevolent mind of Eustache
did not allow him to sink into that state of inactivity which

i pay? in short, was there any exercise of liberality requisite;
only let it be made known to Eustache, and his heart and his
purse were opened, with a readiness that showed how much
more blessed he thought it was to give than to receive. He at
length so impoverished himself, that he found it necessary to
engage himself in the service of General Rochambeau, whom he
accompanied to England, and afterwards to France. We need
not be apprehensive of lessening the admiration of our readers,
by following out the history of Eustache to the day of his death.
. From this period not a day passed unmarked by some act of
humanity. - It was justly remarked by a friend, that to him
the'exercise of benevolence was as natural as it 'was to others
to inhale the air they breathed. One instance, among many,
we quote.

He learned that a young female who had recently come.
from the country, had been deprived of her husband by death,
and left totally unprovided for with four helpless children.
He immediately went in search of her, clothed and fed herThe Mona/on Prize of Virtue. 221

children, placed the oldest in a respectable apprenticeship at
' his own expense,--not forgetting to provide for him the tools
necessary for practising his trade. Some time after, he had
the reward of seeing that child grow up an active tradesman,
and in the way of providing for the remainder of the family.
On another occasion, being aware that an old friend of his
master's had fallen into sickness and poverty, and that his
master was unable to give the assistance his inclination would
have suggested, he secretly devoted for a twelvemonth all the
money he gained to the relief of this object of his solicitude.
He delicately let it be understood that the charity bestowed
was from his master; and it was not till the poor man came
to express his gratitude to his benefactor that the disclosure
Was made, that that benefactor was no other than Eustache.

Eustachc died I 5th March, 1835, at the age of sixty-two.
Had he lived in a country where virtue is as highly esteemed
as genius or valour, a monument would have honoured his name.

In I832 the French Academy had bestowed on him the
first " Montyon Prize " for virtuous conduct. Never was that
honourable distinction more worthily bestowed, although
many a noble and generous life has been made known by this
award, of which our next article gives some account.

THE MONTYON PRIZE 0F YlRTUE.

HERE is published every year by the French Academy,

that select and illustrious body to which the greatest

men in science and literature aspire to belong, a programme-
of prizes, of which they are the trustees and awarders. Some
of these prizes are for discoveries in science, or improvements
in arts and manufactures; others for distinguished works in
history or poetry, and various results of intellectual power and
genius. But there are also some prizes for the, encouragement
of .moral- excellence, and among these the best known is that
called the Montyon Prize, given either in one award, or divided
among several recipients, for virtuous conduct. There are
some other prizes of a similar kind, but this is so conspicuous
above all, that it is always spoken of as the Prix de Verm.
What was its origin ? and what are the deeds thus crowned

with reward and honour ?
Before the great Revolution, there lived in Paris a lawyer,

named M. Montyon, about whom little is known except that he
was wealthy and beneficent. Much was heard in those days
about " the rights of man "; this good citizen often told his
friends that they ought to hearlmore about the duties of man.
One of the first of these duties was to help the helpless, to
relieve the destitute, to encourage charity, and good deeds.
He thought that one way of promoting this true fraternity
would be to award public prizes for acts of virtue and kindness,
wherever they were found. Some remarkable cases were
made known, but before long the storms of the revolutionary
epoch broke out, followed by the military despotism of Napoleon,
and the peaceful proposal of M. Montyon was neglected and
forgotten.

After the fall of Napoleon, and the restoration of peace to
France, M. Montyon, who had emigrated and lived in exile,
returned to France.- He resumed his work as a solicitor, and
- anonymously --so retiring and modest was he in his beneficence
--he sent money to revive and enlarge the fund for the Prix de .
Vefiu,'which he had founded thirty years before. It does not
appear that the donor was publicly known, but after his death,
in 1820, he bequeathed four sums of ten thousand francs each,
for these four good objects; a prize for the book adjudged by
the Academy to be most beneficial to morals; a prize for the
greatest improvement in the healing art, medical or surgical;
a prize for the discovery of lessening the danger or unhealthi-
ness of any art or trade; and lastly, a prize for the most virtuous
- action; and this is the world-famed Prize of Virtue. '

' Ihave before. me the official rules and conditions for this

prize, and they show clearly the sorts of action to be recognized.
and also the conscientious care in carrying out the worthy
founder's good object. I ought to have said that before his
death we find him bearing the title of Baron de Montyon, so
that some one capable of judging, had discovered and honoured
his character and merit. Well, the rules require that an account,
in full detail, must be sent, signed by the Prefet, or Maire, or
other responsible public functionary, and attested by neighbours
and others in good position to witness the deeds reported to
the Academy. These reports may come from any part of the
French dominion ; and one useful regulation is that the life of
the candidate must have been known for at least two years
previously. This excludes any award for sudden or single
acts of courage, for which other rewards are always ready. to
be given, and shows that the Montyon award is intended rather
for the encouragement of " patient continuance in well-doing,"
a much higher and more difficult virtue than adaring act which
may be the result only of momentary impulse. The word
" candidate " was used, but the cases areInot competitive ; in
most of them the recipients are utterly unconscious of their
deeds being observed, and are often greatly surprised when
they hear of the awards.

On the- day of the prize or prizes being given, the receiver
appears either in person, or by proxy, and one of the members
of the Academy delivers a discourse on virtue in general, and
on the particular good deed or good conduct now to be specially
recognised. All this seems to us rather "French " in idea and
in style, and most of the English folk who might be worthy of
such distinction would prefer letting their virtue " blush unseen,"
and not be blazoned by an eloquent Academician. However, it
is " the way" in France, and the published reports or e'Ioges
of the Montyon orators form a most interesting and instructive
record of noble and generous deeds, of which we have told
one in the story of the Haytian negro Eustache; of a few others

we give merely a brief mention.
Some of the instances have very little romance in them, so

far as narrative goes, yet imply long and unwearying service
made light by love. Such are histories of children toiling to
support aged or disabled parents ; nurses devoting themselves
to the unpaid tending of the sick and suffering ; a daughter
who accompanied her mother to prison, and was allowed to
remain with her; a young labourer who gave the earnings of
years, to purchase the release of a conscript, the sorrow 'of
whose mother he could not bear to witness ; a young lady who
refused a splendid offer of marriage, because she preferred
being wedded to the poor among whom she toiled; a young
graduate who surrendered his prospects, and went to a
provincial town to take employment .as a porter, in order to
secure support for his parents suddenly reduced to poverty;
and many such instances of humble devotion and self-denial.

" Unromantic," we said, but sometimes a gleam of romance
meets us, as when we read of Alexandre Martin, the servant
of the Marquis-d'Aubespine, the descendant and representative
of the- great statesman, the Duc de Sully. After some genera- '
tions.the name of Sully became extinct in the male line, but
a daughter of the family had carried the property and the
ancestral domains to the house of Aubespine. At the time of
the Revolution; the then marquis had to sell the castle of
Villebon, and all,- that remained of the property of the great
Sully. Out of the price he could only save enough to purchase
for himself a life annuity of six thousand francs, another of two
thousand four hundred francs for his son, and another of four
hundred' francs, for his faithful attendant, Martin, who had
served him for thirty-five years. Soon after, the old Marquis
died, and being indebt, the creditors, we do not know how,
but unjustly 'as it seems to us, seized the annuity not only
_ of the old man, but of his son and of Alexandre Martin. No
redress could be obtained, and Martin went back to his native
village, Champond-en-Gatinais, and worked as a carpenter,
having learned the trade at the expense of the Marquis, before
_ becoming his servant.

One day, in June 1830, his old master's son, the Count '
d'Aubespine, came to Martin's cottage, with his three children
He'told him that they had been left motherless; that he had
lost all hisproperty, and was leaving France for a time ;. and
that he knew no one whom he could entrust with the care of
his children, except Martin. Nothing was said about paying
their expenses, and probably Martin guessed at once that the
Count had no means of paying: Yet he hesitated" not a
moment, and gladly undertook the charge, for 'the sake of his
old 'master, although he had three children of his own to
provide for. .

Martin's eldest daughter was able to ,earn a trifling sum,
when not required for looking after the younger children, and
his wife also gained a little by going out to work. His own
earnings averaged only about thirty sous a day, and the whole
household had to live on-less than sixty sous a day. Never-
theless the Count's children were well cared for, and were
treated with the utmost respect and consideration. They were
.served as if they were well-paying lodgers, the family living in
the most frugal way, that the guests might feel no Want. They
ate brown bread that the little Aubespines might always have
white, and old clothes had to be worn threadbare that they
might be well clad. Something was even paid to the'village
cure'for their education. The father never sent any money,
nor indeed was he ever heard of, till news came of ' his death,
six years after. The tidings became known in the neigh-
bourhood, and inquiries began to be made about the guests in
the carpenter's home. Some ladies at Chartres then offered to
take charge of the two girls, and Martin's wife, with much
regret, allowed them to go, well pleased that they would now
be brought up as ladies, as the descendants of Sully ought to
be. The third child, a son, was sent to a charitable foundation
endowed by his great ancestor, and then, as Miss Yonge says,
who tells the story in her book of "Golden Deeds " (Macmillan), .
" thus, the only portion of the wealth of Sully that ever reached
his own descendants, was that which had been laid up in the
true treasure house of Charity."

After a time, the rumour of what had been done reached

15Paris, and came to the ears of the King, Louis Philippe, by
whom a presentation was given for young Aubespine to the
College of Henri IV., for completing his education. What
his subsequent career was I do not know, but what concerns
us' now is that he was present, along with his generous bene-
factor, Alexandre Martin, at the annual meeting of the French
Academy in I838, when the Montyon prizes were awarded.
The customary discourse was delivered by M. Salvandi, part
of which deserves to be recorded: "Martin, your task is
accomplished, you have deserved well of your country and of
all good men. You have shown our age, what is too seldom
seen, an example of gratitude, fidelity, honour. The Academy.
awards to your virtue the prize of 3,000 francs. And you, _
Louis d'Aubespine, as you are present at this solemn
ceremony, may it makea deep and lasting impression on
your young heart. You are entering life, as persons are
sometimes forced to appear at maturer age, with all eyes
upon you. Learn that the first of earthly blessings is to be
honoured by one's country, and pray to God, who has watched
over your infancy, to enable you to use that blessing that
depends on'our own efforts, and that no event can rob us of.
One day you will be told that illustrious blood flow's in your
veins, but never forget that you must trace your line as far
back as to the great Sully, before you can find a name
worthy to stand beside that of Alexandre Martin. Grow up
then to show yourself worthy of the memory of your ancestor,
the devotion of your benefactor, and the patronage of the king."
Many similar cases of gratitude, fidelity, and exertion, on the
'part of servants and dependents, appear in the records of the
Montyon awards. There is one in which a woman-servant
named Rose Pasquer,' at Nantes, entirely supported her master
and mistress, who were reduced to penury by the loss of their
West Indian estates. She had been eighty years in the service .
of the same family, and she was herself In her hundredth year
when she received a prize, in I856. Another woman, Madeleine
Blanchet, had saved her mistress at 'the hazard of her own life
during a time of revolutionary riot, and rescued some of the

property from the plunderers. This was at Buzancais, in the

Department Indre-et-Loire. When order was restored, and

the rioters were'tried for'their atrocities, Madeleine was'called

as a witness. She told what she had seen, but said nothing

as to the part she had taken. The judge said that witnesses

had described her as covering her mistress with her own body, .
and being heard- to declare that they should kill her before

they injured her mistress. Was this true ? " Yes, sir," she

replied, and without appearing as if she had done any-

thing out of the way. 'fIf," said the President of the Court,

after hearing all the evidence, "if there had been only twenty

men in Buzancais with the heart of that woman, none of the

disasters we deplore would have taken place." She received; _
a gold medal, and an extra reward of 5,000 francs for her

courage and devotion.

Another poor woman, the wife of Jacqnemin, a water-carrier
in Paris, who, had to support three children, one of them
dumb and infirm, interested herself in seeking relief for a poor
woman, reduced from better circumstances. In seeking help
for her, the curate of the parish learned the poverty of this
petitioner on behalf of others. He gave her ten francs, mean- .
' ing it for herself, but with tears of gratitude she said, " Oh, how
happy this will make Madam Petrel!" The worthy curate
was the more interested-by this incident, so expressive of
charitable feeling. He inquired, and learned all the details of
the poor water-carrier's self-denial and labour. He got friends
to provide for the poor widow Pctrel, and made known the
circumstances of the Jacqnemins, and the mother received a
Montyon award.

The cases last mentioned are those of women, and it is per-
haps only what we might expect, that the majority of those
' rewarded should be of the gentler sex. In thirty-five years
the proportion of those receiving prizes, including lesser awards,-
~ was 565 women to 211 men. As one of the orators'said in
announcing this fact, " Such is the wk of the sexes respectively;228 Remarkable. Escape from

we make.the laws, they form the manners and character;
Continnez d faz're Ies Iois, Messz'eurs, laissez lesfemmes faire [es
mwurs. " Although the examples cited have been chiefly those
of the virtuous poor, the priies are not restricted to humble
life, nor to any class of the community. Some men of good
social position have been as proud to receive the honour, as
the poorest recipients have been grateful for the money. The
prize has. been also awarded to persons of all creeds and
callings--to Roman Catholic sisters of mercy, for instance, and
to the venerated Jean Bost, the founder and patient admini-
strator of the Asylums of La Force, which are still superintended
by members of his family.

Amidst all the future political or social changes of France,
long may the French Academy continue its honourable and
useful services, among which few have greater interest for us
than the administration of the Montyon Prizes.

 

REMARKABLE ESCAPE FROM'THE MASSACRE AT
CAWNPORE.

N a previous page (see p. 52) will be found a brief
account of the origin of the Indian Mutiny. One of
the most fearful episodes of that revolt of the Sepoy Army was
the massacre of the English garrison and residents at Cawn-
pore. The details of that scene of carnage are given in the
histories of the time, and can be read only with pain and
horror. The following narrative of a wonderful escape is
from the pen of Lieutenant Thompson, one of the very few
survivors of that tragic event:

. We had plenty of warning, he says, of what was to happen
at our station, by the example that was set to our troops by ,
those that were stationed at Meerut and Delhi. At Cawnpol'e

- we had the and Light Cavalry, the Ist Regiment N.I., the 53rd.t/ze Massacre at Cawnpore. 229

Regiment N.I., and the 56th N.I. The European part of the '
garrison consisted of the invalid depOt of H.M.'s 32nd Regi-
ment, in all about 80 men, about 50 men of the Queen's 84th, I 5
men of the Ist Fusiliers, and a company of European Artillery,
59 men; total, 204 fighting men. There were also a great
many private individuals, such as civil engineers, tradesmen,
writers in offices, etc. ; in all, together with the soldiers, about
300 men. The ladies, women, and children, I am afraid to
mention--certainly not less than 450.

It must have been about the 15th of May that rumours first
began to spread that the 2nd Cavalry were ripe for mutiny,
but this their officers declared was absurd, and if any one
hinted at the idea oi: their mutinying they were quite offended.
Things went on in this state until the 20th, when a fire broke
out in the rst lines; then.the guns belonging to the_artillery
were sent down to the barracks occupied-by the sick of the
32nd Foot, which was the site fized upon for our position.
There we were to make our stand if attacked by the rebels.
A worse position could not have been chosen, as on the north-
west side of the building there were several houses which quite
commanded the wretched trenches Which were thrown up
around the barracks. You can imagine the consistency of the
earthwork when I tell you it was hardly bullet-proof.' In the
next place, one of the barracks was thatched; but of course
the rebels would not set fire to it! The magazine, alas! was
hardly given a thought to , everybody said there was nothing
in it So the magazine was left alone.

To make matters worse, the Nana Sahib about this time
came into Cawnpore, and offered our collector his assistance in
protecting the treasury, in case the troops should risre.' His
offer was accepted ,- so he sent 400 infantry; zoo cavalry, and
two small guns into Cawnpore for the treasury guard. Fancy
married men, when these preparations for defence were being
made, not sending their wives away to Calcutta out of danger !
Many and many a time did I beg of the ladies I knew at all '
intimately to go away ,- but no, they said, "Why should we '
go ? The General keeps his family here, surely there can be
no danger for us I " Poor creatures, how little did they know '
what was in store for them! Provisions were laid in for a
month, 1n case the place should be invested. Still no one
thought of sending their families away. ' '

Things went on in this unsettled way until the night of the
5th, or rather the morning of the 6th of June, when the cavalry
Went off towards the treasury, followed by the Ist NJ. The
53rd and 56th both remained under arms until daylight,-
when they were dismissed and sent to their lines. It was
supposed that these regiments were staunch; but about nine
o'clock the 56th ran away} taking their colours with them, and
they were immediately followed by our regiment. All made
for the treasury, where .they plundered nine lacs of rupees.
The Nana's forces, which had come to protect us, of course
never drew a sWord in our favour. The regulartroops, after
getting all the money they could, were setting off for Delhi,
and had actually gone some distance on the road, when
they were sent for by the Nana, and told they had much
better come back and murder the Feringhees, which could be
very easily accomplished, as the magazine was well furnished
with guns of all calibre, and ammunition enough to last for
a twelvemonth. You see he knew better what was in our
magazine than we did. '

When the troops consented to return, the Nana sent a letter
to the General to say he intended to attack his position the
next morning (the 7th of June), and, true to his word, he
commenced the attack by opening a 9-pounder gun on us.
This was the beginning of a cannonade which lasted for
twenty-two days, the equal to which I suppose is hardly
known in history ; for we had pounding into us-fourteen guns
---viz., three 24-pounders, two 18-pounders, two 6-pounders,
and seven 9-pounders. These, together with some 3,000
infantry, kept up an incessant fire all day, and at night they
had three mortars playing on us, which very effectually kept
. us from getting rest. '
How thankful I was when once their firing commenced that
Ihad no relations in the entrenchmentsl Then it was that
one heard husbands and fathers cursing their stupidity for not
sending away their families ; but of what avail was their only .
now having their eyes opened to their folly ? It was too late.
Wives saw their husbands' bodies mutilated in the most
awful manner with round shot, and husbands saw their wives
suffering the most excruciating agonies from wounds which
they Were unable to heal. Then there was theflscreaming of
children after their dead parents. P001 little things, how
it unnerved one to see them! but at last one got accustomed
to the horrible scenes which were going on around, till at last
they hardly made any impression.

One scene I can never forget. A poor woman of the name

'of White was walking along the trenches with her husband,
and nursing her children (twins) in her arms ; some fiend
fired at them, killed the man, and broke both the poor
woman's arms. The children fell to the ground, one of them
wounded. Then followed a scene which can only 'be imagined.
Fancy the poor woman throwing herself down beside her
children and not being able to assist them on account of the
wounds she had received! Another woman, who was in a
wretched state, bordering on starvation, was seen to go out of
the protection of the trenches with a'child in each hand, and
stand where the fire was heaviest, hoping that some bullet
might relieve her and her little ones from the troubles they
were enduring. But she was brought back, poor thing, to die
a more tedious death than she had intended for herself. Here
you saw poor Mrs. W. hit by a ball in the face, passing through
the palate of the mouth ; and by her side you saw her daughter
who, although she was badly wounded in her shoulder, was
doing all she could to alleviate the sufferings of her unfortunate
mother. Poor creatures, they both died from their wounds l
Then. you saw an unfortunate native servant, who had
remained faithful to her mistress, and was nursing her infant
under the protection - of the walls of the barrack, as she
imagined {but all of a sudden you saw her knocked over, and
the child hurled out of her arms, and on examination you
found both her legs cut clean ofi" by _a round shot, but the child
was picked up uninjured. Many other such horrid scenes could
I describe, but, judging from my own feelings on the Subject,
I know that I shall only be stirring up in the minds of those
who may see this letter a feeling for revenge which can never .
be properly accomplished on the right objects of justice.

On the evening of the 9th of June the thatched barrack which .
I mentioned above was set-fire to' by the rebels. No arrange-
ments had been made in anticipation of such an occurrence, so
those'who were able to get into the trenches were saved from
the flames, but many a poor wounded man, who was unable to '
move, was burnt alive. All the medicine 'chests and surgical
instruments were destroyed, so that all who were wounded or
fell sick after this date were unable to be attended to.

During the time that the barrack was burning, we all
expected the rebels to come down upon us, and if they had
. had the courage of anything in them except that of an Asiatic,
they would certainly have made an attempt. But the wretches
had not the heart to come nearer than 2'00 yards from the
trenches. After this the cannonading continued, I must say,
without intermission, until the 23rd of June (anniversary of
the Battle of Plassey), committing frightful havoc amongst our
little but heroic garrison, but still they were willing to hold
out till the last, as they. were told by General Wheeier that
relief must come.

On the 2 3rd of June the rebels showed in great force around
us, and made attempts on every quarter to get into our
entrenchments. But all their endeavours were useless," as
when the main body charged, a few were knocked over, and
this intimidated the rest, and back they went with greater
speed than they advanced. The rebel Chieftain, finding he
could not dislodge'us by fair' means, thought it wiser to adopt
another plan, as I suppose he had heard some news of a force
leaving Allahabad for. our relief. Any way, he Sent a woman, .
whom he had taken a prisoner, over to ,us with a letter to this

effect 2-- .

' "To THE SOLDIERS AND SUBJECTS OF HER MOST GRACIOUS MAJESTY.
QUEEN VICTORIA. .

"All men who have in no way been connected with the Act of Lord

Dalhousie, and are willing to lay down their arms, shall have permission
and protection to proceed to Allahabad."

This artfully-worded letter,.I am sorry to say, had its desired
effect, and a brave officer, Captain Moore, who had always .
had the management and carrying out of any little enterprise
which was set on foot,'such as the spiking of the enemy's
guns, or charging the rascals when they congregated in the
building near us--this man, who seemed to be the very life of
our garrison, was immediately. for making a treaty with the
enemy. We all expected he would be the last to give in.
He did not know with whom he wished to treat. Poor fellow,
he had a wife in the trenches, and this must have biassed him
in a great measure. He saw that in making a treaty there
was some chance of escape for the women and children, but
unless relief came for us he knew we' must give in at last, as
provisions were running short, and then I suppose he thought
something more awful would happen. Poor M. had not been
long in the .country, or he would never have attempted to treat

I with a native of India, especially a Mahratta. I

General Wheeler, although not wishing to treat with the
Nana, told Captain M. that he might do .what he thought
proper. Accordingly, a treaty was signed that very evening,
26th of June, 1857. The following were the conditions of the
treaty :--" That the garrison should give up their guns,
ammunition, and treasure; should be allowed to carry their
maskets and sixty rounds of cartridges with them; that the
Nana should provide carriages for the sick, wounded, women,
and' children, to the. river's bank, where boats should be in
readiness to convey all to Allahabad." This seemed to promise
a speedy release from our troubles ; but many anone seemed
to doubt the fulfilment of the same. A committee was Sent
down to the boats to see all was in preparation for our
departure the following morning, and nothing was found
wanting. .The morning broke and found everyone getting
ready for our departure. The carriages came down at sunrise
for our wounded, etc., etc.; and, after making over all our
military stores, as agreed upon, we marched off for the boats.
We 'reached them in safety, and everybody who left the
trenches on the memorable morning of the 27th of June, 1857,
got on board safely. But immediately we began to shove off-
from the shore, at a given signal from the rebels, all our
boatmen deserted us, having fire in the thatches of the boats ;
theconsequence was, they were all in a blaze very quickly.
The guns opened on us from the Cawnpore side of the river,
with a {rightfully heavv fire of musketry.

1 must now come to the egotistical part of my narrative,
as it is impossible for me to describe what became of the rest
of our unfortunate garrison except those with whom I came
in personal contact. When the boat Ifirst took shelter in was
fired, I jumped out with the rest into the water, and tried
to drag her off the sand--bank, but to no purpose; so I
deserted her, and made across the river to the Oude side,
where I saw two of our; boats. It was an awful swim that!
Grape-shot and bullets came whizzing along the water after
.my more unfortunate companions, several of whom I saw
perish close beside me; but still I persevered in my object
to gain the boats, which at last I succeeded in doing. It was
a hard struggle,I can assure you, as I was rather heavily
clothed, for so long a swim. How I thanked God for
having learned to swim! I had on 'a regimental pair of
cloth trousers and a flannel shirt, so you can imagine the
Weight of them when they got thoroughly saturated. When I
. arrived at the boat I was so much exhausted that I was obliged
' regularly to be pulled on board. '

' The two boats managed to keep together for about a mile
down the'river,' when a round shot went through the rearmost'
one, and rendered it useless, so we took all her passengers on
board our boat. [There were now in this boat more than
fifty persons, including women and children; there were a

' large number of officers] With this boat-load we managed
to get ahead five or six miles down the river; but as the
rebels continued to follow us on the Oude side, with two guns
and, about 2,000 infantry and cavalry, who kept' up an
incessant fire, you may suppose our numbers were -
considerably thinned. The first 'day we lost Captain Moore,
Captain Ashe, Lieutenant-Colonel Wiggins, Lieutenants .
Burney, Glanville, Satchwell, and Bassilico; wounded, Major
Vibart, Captain A. Turner, Lieutenants Fagan, Mainwaring,
Master Henderson, and myself. I received a severe wound
on the head with a bullet. Iwas hit in two other places,
merely contusions,'but still unpleasant.

We remained where the boat grounded until nightfall,
when we managed to get once more afloat, and, will you
believe it, the rascals followed us down the river with
torches and lighted arrows in their hands, doing all they could
to fire our boat, so we were obliged to throw overboard the
thatched-covering we had' to protect us from the sun and rain.
We sailed on after this for some hours in peace; but when
we arrived at Nuzzufl'ghur, some distance down the Ganges,
_we again got aground, and again fell in with the enemy, who
brought a. gun to bear upon us, with which, through God's
mercy,.they were unable to do us any harm. .

Our numbers were. again thinned by the musketry. As the
enemy came by mistake nearer to us than they intended, we
beat them off with severe loss on their side, and they returned
to Cawnpore to tell the Nana that they could do 'nothing with
us; so the fiend sent two fresh companies of sepoys after us.
During- the time we were aground at Nuzzuffghur we lost
Captain Whiting, Lieutenant Harrison, and several privates
killed. Captain A. Turner again wounded, Captain Seppings
and his poor wife, and Lieutenants Daniel and Quin wounded.

A tremendous storm coming on now freed us from this awful
position, and we floated down the river till dawn, when we

v
again stuck at a' place called Soorajpore, and daylight revealed
our position. We were immediately attacked by the sepoys
belonging to a hostile zemindar; so I was sent on shore with _
Delafosse, a sergeant named O'Grady, 84th Foot, and eleven .
men, to beat 01? the rebels, whilst the rest of the survivors
endeavoured to get off the boat. On our part we succeeded
4 only too well; we drove off the scoundrels until they sur-
rounded us on all sides, so we were obliged to try a retreat,
which we partially effected--that is to say, we took shelter in
a temple'on the riVer bank, having only lost_one of our

number, the poor sergeant, who was hit in the eye bya bullet.
I attempted to parley with the rascals, but was answared by
a-shower of bullets. The rebels tried all in their power
to'get us out of the temple ; they brought a small gun to bear

..upon it, they tried to undermine the foundations, but all in
.vain. We still remained in possession, and still continued
to knock them over, until at last they hit upon the idea of
burning us out. After heaping the brushwood before the
door (we could not help their doing this, as the temple was
round, and had only one entrance), it was lighted, and we
waited to see the result, and by God's blessing, the wind was
blowing from such a quarter that .it did us no harm--not a
particle of smoke came inside. Again they piled the brush-
wood, and this time they threw powder into the fire, and the

smoke came in in volumes; and, almost suffocated, we resolved,
when the fire consumed itself, to make one rush for the river.
We waited our time, and, with a regular British cheer,
out we went. Our enemies, although their numbers must
have been forty to one against us, ran in all directions. Six
of our poor fellows, who could not swim, charged home into
the crowd, and met the death they sought. The remaining
seven of us- got into the river ,"two more Were shot before
they .could make many strokes from the bank ; but Delafosse,
myself, privates Murphy, Sullivan, and Ryan, 'swam some
distance down the Ganges, followed all the time by the muti-
neers. who'continued firing at us, when Ryan (I suppose from
exhaustion), made for the' shore, and was killed. by three
rufl'ians who previously had offered to'protect Delafosse and .
Murphy, if they would give themselves up. But when their
offers were rejected, they made a rush at. their intended
victims, but were baulked of their prey by the fugitives
diving. Murphy received a severe rap: on his head from one
of their clubs. After this we swam on for some distance
undisturbed; so we thought, the coast being clear, 'we would
take a rest.

Ihad hardly got into my depth, where I was sitting up to
my neck in water, when looking behind me, I saw three men,
armed, running along the shore, evidently making for us. I
gave the alarm, and we were all ofi' into the stream in'a
minute. When these natives came abreast of us they addressed
me in a very respectful manner, and begged I would entrust
myself to their charge, as they meant me no harm. Their
Rajah, they said, was friendly to our Government, and if we
would avail ourselves of his protection, he would send us
safely to Allahabad. From the moment they addressed
me I felt there was no treachery, so I went on shore, and
was kindly received. The others at first hesitated, but at last
yielded to my persuasion. These three men (sepoys in the
service of the Rajah) took us to their village, and g'ave'us a
capital meal of dhal and chupatties, which we devoured most
eagerly, not having tasted food since we left Cawnpore. I
cannot understand how our strength was kept up after so long
a fast. We swam six miles down the river, which is a great
feat to accomplish at any time, but after a three days' fast it
really must sound very like an impossibility. Nevertheless,
it is true. Our party remained a month with the old Rajah,
and we were treated dizring our stay with all the kindness a '
native could showf r V

The Nana sent down for us twice (according to the records
found at Cawnpore), but the Rajah refused to give us up, and '
immediately sent us across the river to a friendly zemindar, '
. who supplied us with carriage for our 'trip to Allahabad, and238- Tke Siege qf [Mum/em ey Titus.

an escort of a few men. We had, however, only to travel a '
few miles with this retinue, as we met a detachment of ours
on its road to Cawnpore, so we determined'to retrace our
steps, and I joined General Havelock's force.

 

THE SlEGE 0F JERUSALEM BY TITUS;

THE destruction of the city and temple of jerusalem by
the Romans, while one of the most memorable events '
in the history of the world, has also a special interest as a
fulfilment of sacred prophecy. The'woes predicted against
the doomed city and its inhabitants were terribly carried into
execution, and one of the Jewish nation has been the instru-
ment used to tell the tragic tale. Josephus, in his books of
the wars of ' the-Jews, gives a detailed narrative of the siege
and capture of the city by the Roman General, Titus, in whose
camp and near whose presence he was during all the events
which he describes._ From his pages has been compiled"
the following narrative. While we know that the " accursed
nation "- brought upon itself 'the terrible judgment of that
time, we cannot refrain from a feeling of admiration at the
courageous and determined resistance offered to the con
quering Romans, and at the last efforts of Jewish patriotism.
When Titus had collected and arranged his forces, he pro-
ceeded to within three miles and three-quarters of the city,
where he encamped at a place called the Valley of Thorns.
Having selected six hundred choice horsemen he proceeded to
survey the city, with the hope that the Jews would surrender;

"' " The Judgment of Jerusalem," by the Rev. D. Patton, of New York,
published by the Religious Tract Society, contains a complete view of
the events predicted' in Scripture, and fulfilled in'history in these times.
Many other books. contain accounts of the siege, but all of them founded on
he history of Josephus.T/ze Szege of jemselem by Titus. 239 "

for he had heard that the citizens were desirous of peace, being
sorely oppressed with the robbers. So long as he rode along
the straight road, which led to the wall of the city, nobody
appeared out of the gates; but when he Went out of that road,
and declined towards the tower of Psephinus, and led the band
of horsemen obliquely, an immense number of the Jews leaped
oilt suddenly through the gate, and intercepted his horse,
and cut him and a few others ofi' from the main body of his
horsemen. By surprising personal courage he cut his way
through the masses; and though several of his men were
killed, and many darts thrown at him, still, shielded by the
providence of God, he escaped unhurt, notwithstanding he had
on neither his headpiece nor his breastplate. _

Titus now divided his army into three portions. He':
stationed two legions ,in a fortified camp at the north, at 'a
place called Seopus, less than a mile from the city. The
fifth legion was stationed half a mile from them. The tenth
legion he stationed on the Mount of Olives,--on the east side,
about three-quarters of a mile from the city.

Seeing these determined preparations, the factions within
the city were now compelled to cease their strifes, and unite

for the common defence. ,They immediately put on their_ .

armour, and ran out upon the tenth legion, who were fortifying
their camp, and fell upon them with eagerness. The Romans,
having laid aside their arms in order. to perform their work,
were taken at disadvantage and in difi'erent parties, and were
consequently: thrown into great confusion. The success of this
onset drew larger numbers from the city, who so pressed upon
the tenth legion that they Were driven back.

' Titus now ordered that the space between Scopus and the wall
of the city should be levelled. In four days they finished the
work, cutting down the hedges and the trees, filling up the hollow
places, and demolishing the rocky precipices, thus making a
level place suitable for an encampment. Titus with the
strongest - part of his army encamped over against the

* wall on the north and western quarter, near the tower of'246 The Szege.'C/7fjemsalem 6y Titus.

Psephinus. Another portion fortified itself near the tower of

Hippicus; whilst the tenth legion still continued on the Mount
of Olives.

I Titus, in company with a few chosen men, made another
survey of the walls, to fix upon' the points of attack. In the
valleys the walls were inaccessible for the engines. The first,
or old wall round Zion, appeared too strong to be shaken.
The place he finally fixed upon was where there was a gap, the
first fortification being lower than the second, and not joined
to it, the builders neglecting to build the wall strong where the
new city was not much inhabited.

Before making the attack he determined again to propose
terms of peace. In company with Josephus and Nicanor, he
approached near the .wall. Instead of listening to proposals,
they hurled darts at the messengers, and severely wounded

'Nicahdr in his left shoulder. .This so incensed Titus, that he
gave orders to set fire to the suburbs, also to bring forward
timber to raise the banks or platforms, and to set the engines
against the wall. This they did with great despatch, but not
without serious annoyance from the Jews, who made frequent
sallies both by night and by day, and did much injury to the
Romans. The banks, however, were 'prepared, and the
engines, seventy-five feet high, placed thereon, and brought to
the wall. For awhile they plied their battering-rams without
any serious hindrance from the Jews. Suddenly the Jews
sallied forth, through an obscure gate at the tower of Hippicus,

-for the purpose of burning the engines and destroying the
banks ; and, with the courage of desperation, they 'went up to .

. the very fortifications of the Romans. The conflict was fearful,

--the Romans were driven back, and fire was applied to the

engines and the banks. But as fresh legions, led on by Titus

' in person, came up, the Jewswere forced to retreat within

their walls. .On the fifteenth day the Romans, by the inces-

sant application of their battering- -rams, succeeded in making

a breach in the wall of the city at Bezetha. The troops

immediately mounted this breach, and poured into the
narrow and crowded streets. They' were attacked from the
roofs and side alleys with such fury, that with considerable
loss they were compelled to retreat without the wall. It was
some days before Titus could regain what he had thus lost,.
and again enter the streets of Bezetha. When he did return,
the Jews fled from the outer wall, and entrenched themselves
within the second one, which enclosed Acra. There being no
armed force to resist, the gates were thrown open, when the army
entered and demolished the wall and a large portion 'of the city.

Titus, having now removed his camp 'within the city,
immediately commenced his attacks upon the second wall
around Acra. The Jews divided themselves into several
bodies, and in the most courageous manner defended this wall.
John and his troops occupied the tower of Antonia and the
northern cloisters of the temple. Simon, to whom was
committed the defence of the wall, placed himself near the
tower of Hippicus. The Jews made many violent sallies from
the walls, and with the most determined boldness attacked
the Romans. " Nor did either side grow weary," says Josephus,
" but all day long there were attacks and fightings on the wall,
and perpetual sallies from the gates. And the night had
much ado to part them, when they began to fight in the
morning. The night was passed without sleep on both sides,
and was more uneasy than the day'to them. The, one was
afraid lest the wall should be taken, and the other lest the
Jews should make sallies upon their camps. Both sides lay'
in their armour, and were ready at the first appearance of
light to go to the battle "

This continued for several days. Twice the Romans were
driven back after effecting an entrance, and the breaches in.
the wall were repaired. But at length the Jews were
compelled to take refuge in the temple and in Zion, or the
upper city. Thus Titus regained possession of this second
wall, which he immediately and entirely destroyed. He put
garriso'ns in the towers on the south part of the city, and then
devised his plan for the assault on the third wall.

16
Having gained the control of Acra, or the lower city, he
decided not to proceed immediately, but to relax the siege a
little, to allow the citizens time for consideration, supposing
that his successes and demonstrations of power would decide
them to surrender. To impress their minds the more deeply,
he had his whole army drawn up in battle array in the face 0f
the enemy, and for four days publicly distributed subsistence
money among them. The historian adds, "The whole old
wall and the north side of the temple was full of spectators;
nor was there any part of the city which was not.covered
over with their multitudes, nay, a very great consternation
seized upon the hardest of the Jews themselves, when they
'saw all the army in the same place, together with the fineness
of their arms, and the good order of their men. And I cannot
but think that the seditious would have changed their minds
at that sight, unless the crimes they had committed against the
people had been so horrid that they despaired of forgiveness
from the Romans; but as they believed death with torments '
must be their punishment if they did not go on in the defence
of the city, they thought it much better to die in the war."

This interval lasted four days. " But on the fifth, when no
signs of peace came from the Jews, Titus divided his legions,
and began to raise banks both at the tower of Antonia and at
John's monument. His design was to take Zion, or the upper
city, at that monument, and the temple at the tower of
Antonia ; for if the temple were not taken it would be
dangerous to keep the city itself. ' So, at. each of these parts,
he'raised his banks, each legion raising one." The conflict at
these two points was exceedingly sanguinary, and for a time
proved too much for. the Romans. The determination of Titus '
to conquer became more settled and firm. Before proceeding-'
tolmore extreme measures, he~sent Josephus again to exhort
the people to surrender. . The Jews only ridiculed his exhorta-
.tion, and by throwing stones and darts defied the utmost
. power of the Romans. Josephus was struck on the head With
a missile, and carried to the camp insensible. At this time
many of the people endeavoured to escape from the city, but
they were either killed by the seditious, or destroyed by the
Roman soldiers for the sake of the gold which they were
said .to have swallowed. _

In order to bring the battering-rams and other engines to
bear upon the walls, it became necessary, by means of timber
and other materials, to erect new mounds. For the-wall on the
brow of Zion was on a precipice thirty feet high, whilst a deep
trench defended the tower of Antonia. For seventeen days
they were employed in raising these banks. There Were now
four great mounds. One at the tower of Antonia, raised by
the fifth legion. Another, cast up by the twelfth legion, at
the distance of about thirty feet from the first. The third,-
erected by the tenth legion, was'on the north quarter of the
old wall. The fourth, built by the fifteenth legion, was about
thirty .feet from the third. On all these banks immensely
powerful battering-rams were placed.

John, who had possession of Antonia, carefully watched the
operations of Titus, and was busy in excavating from within
the wall at Antonia, so as to undermine and destroy' the
foundations upon which the engines of the Romans rested.
Having Supported the excavated ground, under_the engines,
with beams laid across, he brought in the most combustible
materials, which he set on fire. So that while the Romans
were working the engines, the materials beneath were burning,
until the beams were burnt through, when the engines
suddenly fell into the mine, and with many men were '
destroyed. This happened just as the Romans were in hopes
of forcing the wall, and it very much cooled their ardour.

- Two days after this, Simon made an attempt to destroy
the other banks-on the north side of Zion, for the Romans had

begun to make the wall shake. They ran out suddenly, with
I lighted torches, and violently rushing through those who were
working the engines, set these machines on fire. Although
assaulted on every side with darts and swords, yet did they
not give way, but caught hold of the machines. When the ~
Romans saw the flames, multitudes hurried from the camp to
save their engines. Then the Jews fought with those who'
endeavoured to quench the fires. When the Romans en-
deavoured to pull the battering--rams out of the fire, the-Jews
caught hold of them through the flames, grappling them fast, -
although the iron upon them became red hot. The flames
extended also to the banks. Many more rushed out from the
city, and the Jews becoming still more bold drove back the
Romans, pursuing them to the very fortifications of their
camp, and there fought most desperately. This assault was
concluded by'Titus, with a body of troops, attacking the Jews
in the rear. They immediately wheeled about, and attacked
the new enemy. After a fierce conflict, the Jews were driven
into the city, but the Romans lost their banksand battering-rams.
The Romans spent twenty-one days in reconstructing new
mounds, when they again brought forward their engines.
Those in the city felt that unless they could succeed in burning
these also, it would be impossible longer to resist. The
Romans felt that if these were destroyed it would be exceed-
ingly difficult to construct others, as materials had become very
scarce, owing to the fact that the trees about the city had already
been cut down within a- circuit of more than twelve miles.
The attack on Antonia was renewed, and the conflict
continued with the utmost desperation on both sides. The
engines were worked with wonderful power. The resistance
and strategies of the Jews were perplexing and distressing to
the army of Titus. The wall by night was so shaken by the
battering-rams, in the place where John had undermined .it
for the purpose of burning the banks, as already'stated, that it
gave way and fell suddenly. This encouraged the Romans.
But the Jews felt confident, as the tower of 'Antonia s'till stood.
'The Romans pressed on through this breach ,' but they found
another wall within, which John had built up to protect the
spot weakened by his own excavations. This, however, was
more easily thrown .down than the other. Titus encouraged
his soldiers to advance, and take the tower'of Antonia, saying,T/ze Szega querusalem by T z'tus. 245

" If we go up to this tower of Antonia, we gain the city." The
attack was renewed on the third day, and continued. for
fourteen days, when it was carried by the following bold
stratagem. Twelve of the" Roman guards upon the banks -
called to them the standard-bearer of the fifth legion and two

others of a troop of horsemen and one trumpeter. These

went, without noise, about the ninth hour of the night (z'.e.,

- about three o'clock in the morning), through the ruins to the

tower of Antonia; and when they had killed the first guards

of the place, as they were asleep, they got possession of the

wall, and ordered the trumpeter to sound his trumpet. Upon

this the rest of the Jewish guards fled, before anybody could

seehow many had entered, for they imagined that the number

of the enemy must be great. Titus, hearing the signal

trumpet, crowded forward his men, and entered through the

breach. John and Simon rallied their forces, and attacked the

Romans with the most determined courage and zeal; " for

they esteemed themselves entirely ruined if once the Romans -
got into the temple, as did the Romans look upon the same

thing as the beginning of their entire conquest. A terrible

battle was fought at the very entrance of the temple, and

great slaughter was made on both sides. The contending

forces had alternate success and defeat At_ length the Jews'

violent zeal was too much' for the Romans' skill, and the

battle already inclined entirely that way; for'the fight had

lasted from the ninth hour of the night (12a, 3 a.m.), till the

seventh hour of the day (z'.e., I p.m.) ; ten full hours.

Here occurred one of the most extraordinarydisplays'ofvalour
of the whole siege.' "For there was one Julian, a centurion,
famed for his skill in arms, bodily strength, and courage of
soul, seeing the Romans giving ground and in a sad condition,
leaped out, and of himself alone put the Jews to flight, when
they were already conquerors, and made them retire as far as
the corner of the inner court of the temple. From him the
multitude fled away in crowds, supposing that neither his
strength nor his violent attacks were, those of a mere man.
. He rushed through the midst of them, killing those whom he
caught. As he ran he slipped upon the bloody pavementvof
the court, and fell upon his back. Immediately the Jews
surrounded him, striking at him with their spears and swords.
For a considerable time he defended himself with his shield, '
but being overpowered by the multitude, he cut his own throat
and died. " The Jews caught up his dead body, bore it with
them as a trophy, put the Romans to flight, driving them from '
the temple area, and shut them up in the tower of Antonia,
which they had gained by stratagem, and at a vast expense of
time, and labour, and life.

Titus now gave orders to his soldiers to 'make a breach in
the foundations of Antonia, except such portions as were
needed for the garrison, and to make a ready passage for his
army to come up. While these orders Were being executed,
he made one more effort to save the city and temple, sending
Josephus as before. Josephus, speaking in the Hebrew
language, urged upon the people a variety of considerations
why they should, 'without any further shedding of blood,
submit, and throw themselves upon the clemency of Titus.
His manner was very earnest and sorrowful, speaking with
groans and sobs which interrupted his words. This moved
the people; but John cast reproaches and imprecations upon
Josephus, and defied the power of the Romans, because this

was God's city, and He would take care of it.

' Having failed to make any arrangement with the Jews,
Titus prepared his forces for an attack upon_the temple. As
. he could not bring all his army into action, the place being
so narrow, he chose thirty soldiers of the most valiant out of
every hundred, and committing one thousand to each tribune,
he ordered them to attack the guards of the temple about the
ninth hour of .the night (i. e. ., 3 a. 111..) They did not find the
guards asleep, as they hoped, but were compelled to fight with
them hand to hand, as with shoutings and great violence they
rushed upon them. .Those in the temple ran to the help of the
guards. By reason of the darkness there was great confusion,T/ze Siege- (y'jemsalemuy .Tz'Zus. ' 247 '

and many of the Jews were slain by mistake by their own
friends. The fight continued from 3 a.m. until r 1.a.m. in the
same place where it began, for neither party could say that
they had made the other retire, so neither could claim the
victory.

For the next seven days the Roman army was employed in
throwing down some of the walls of Antonia, that a ready and
a broad way might be made to the temple, that thus a much
larger force might be brought into action. When this was
accomplished, then the legions came near the first court, or court
of the Gentiles. Seeing the enemy advancing to the holy
house itselfl'in their desperation they set fire to the north-
west cloister, which was joined to the tower of Antonia,
and thus broke ofi' thirty .feet of that Cloister, and thereby
made a beginning in burning the sanctuary. Two days after
this, on the twenty-fourth of Panemus, the Romans set fire to
the Cloister that joined to the other, when the fire went
twenty--two- and a half feet farther. Nor was the work of
destruction in this quarter ended until the tower of Antonia
was parted from the temple, even though it was in the power
of the Jews to have stopped the fire. '

When two of the legions had completed their banks, Titus
gave orders that the battering-rams should be brought and set
over against the western edifice of the inner temple ; for before
these were brought, the most powerful of all the other engines
had battered the wall for six days together without ceasing, with-
out making any impression upon it; the largeness of the stones.
and strong masonry of the walls was superior to the power of
the engines. Others undermined the foundation of thenorthern
gate, and after a world of pains removed the outermost stones;
yet was the gate upheld by the inner stones, and stood still
unhurt. The soldiers now brought their ladders to the walls
to scale the place; but the Jews fell upon them, threw them
back headlong, and got possession of the engines and destroyed
them. '

Titus the next day ordered the soldiers to quench the fire,
whilst he called a council of his generals to decide what should
be done with the holy house. Some were for demolishing it ;
others would preserve it if the Jews would surrender,.if not
then to burn it. But Titus said " that he was not, in any.
case,'for burning down so .vast a work as that was,--it would
be an ornament to the Roman empire; and that it should be
spared, even though the Jews should fight from it." But the
historian adds, "God had for certain long ago doomed it to
the fire,-and now that fatal day had come."

The consultation having ended, " Titus retired into the tower
of Antonia, resolved to storm the temple the next day early in
the morning." The more efiectually to succeed, he determined
to bring his whole army and encamp round about the holy'
house. When Titus thus retired, the seditious for a little
while lay still ;' then suddenly they attacked _the Romans who
were quenching the fire, which had reached and was burning
the inner court of the temple. But the Jews " were put to
flight, and the 'Romans proceeded as far as the holy house
itself; at which time one of the soldiers, without staying for'
any orders, and without'any concern or dread upon him at so
great an undertaking, and being hurried on by a certain divine
fury, snatched somewhat out of the materials that were on
fire, and being lifted up by another soldier, he threw a burning
brand through a window into the rooms that were round about
the holy house on the north side of it." .

It will be remembered that the interior of the temple '
was richly furnished with .the choicest woods, that the floors
were of cedar, covered with fir; consequently the flames
spread with great rapidity. " As the flames went upward, the
Jews made a great clamour, . . . and ran together to prevent
it ; and now they spared not their lives any longer, nor
suffered anything to restrain their force, since the holy house
was perishing." A messenger ran to the tent of Titus, who was
resting himself after the last battle, and told him, " 'whereupon '
he rose up in great haste, and as he was ran to the holy house
- in order to have a stop, put to the fire. After him folloWed allT 1w Siege caf./emsalom by 722245. N 249

his commanders and several legions. Then, both by calling
with a loud voice 'to the soldiers, who were fighting, and by
giving a signal to them with his right hand, he ordered. them
to quench the fire. But they did not hear what he said, having '
their ears dinned by the greater noise another way; nor did

they attend to the signal he made with his hand. But as

for the legions that came running thither, neither any per-

_ suasions nor any threatenings could restrain their violence;

but each one's own passion was his commander at this time ;

and as they were crowding into the temple, many of them

were trampled to death, whilst a great number fell among the

ruins of the Cloisters, which were still hot and 'smoking, and

were destroyed: and. those who came near the holy house

made as if they did not hear Titus' orders, but encouraged

those who Were before them to set it on fire."

As Titus was unable to restrain the mad fury of the soldiers,
and as the fire spread yet more and more, he went, with his
commanders, into the Holy of Holies, and saw what was in it-- '
viz., the golden censer, the ark of the covenant overlaid round
about with gold, and the tables of the covenant, and over it
the cherubim of glory shadowing the mercy-seat. The sight
he found to be far superior to what he had previously heard.
" As the flames had not yet reached to its- inward parts, but
were consuming the rooms about the holy house, supposing
that the house itself might yet be saved, he_came up in haste,
and endeavoured to persuade the soldiers to quench the fire.
He ordered the refractory to be beaten and restrained; yet
were their passions too fierce for their regard for Titus. or '
their dread for those who forbade them.' The hope of plunder
induced many to go on, as having this opinion that all the
places within were full of money, and as seeing that all round
about it was made of gold." One of those who went into the
place prevented Titus, when he ran out so hastily to restrain
the soldiers, and soon the flames burst out from within the
holy house itself, consuming the remains of the cloisters and
the gates, also the treasury chamber, in which there was an
immense quantity of money, garments, and precious goods.
Thustotal and thorough was the destruction by fire.

How signal the overruling providence of God ! How marked
- the destruction! It was accomplished notwithstanding the
strong desires of the Jews and their enemies to preserve it.
The Jews themselves, and Titus through his soldiers, were the
instruments employed for carrying out all that the prophets
had written, and all that Jesus Christ had spoken concerning
the overthrow and utter ruin of the city and the temple.

The new city Bezetha, the lower city Acra, and the temple
on Moriah being in utter ruin, the only remaining portion of
Jerusalem was Mount Zion, the upper city, or the city of
David. This was connected with the temple by a bridge
already described, which spanned the Tyropceon valley.
Before proceeding against 'Zion, Titus made one more attempt
to end the war by inducing the Jews to surrender. Standing
upon the bridge be, through an interpreter, addressed the
people, who .were under the command of Simon and John.

The only reply was to require that they, with their wives
and'children, might go through the wall he had made about
them into the desert, and leave the city to him. Titus Was
indignant that those whom he had conquered should make
their own terms as if they were the conquerors. He told
them " that they should no more come out to him as deserters,
~nor hope for any furthersecurity; for that he would hence-
forth spare nobody, but fight them with his whole army ; and
that they must save themselves as well as they could, for that
he would from henceforth treat them according to the laws of
wan". ' - _ ,

Now when Titus perceived that Zion, or the upper city, was
so steep that it could not be taken without raising banks
against it, he distributed the work among his army. The .
carriage of the materials was difficult, since all the trees within
a distance of twelve miles had been cut. down to make the
former banks. The' banks of the four legions, however, were
raised on the west side of the city, over against the royalThe Stage qf [emu/emu}! Tz'z'us. 2-51A

palace. The banks erected by the other troops were at the
. Xystus, an immense open place on the extreme east, sur-
rounded by a covered colonnade,- where the people often
assembled, and from whence they reached the'bn'dge. Whilst
these preparations were advancing, the commanders of
the Idumeans, whom the people had formerly received into
the city to defend 'them against the seditious, surrendered
themselves. They were received as prisoners by Titus, and
were sold into slavery by his soldiers.

In eighteen days the banks were finished, and the battering-
rams brought against the wall. Despairing of saving the city,
many of the Jews fled from the wall, and took refuge in the
citadel ; whilst others went down into the subterranean vaults.
Still a great many defended themselves 'against those who
brought the engines. The numbers of the Romans prevailed.
As soon as a part of the wall was battered down; and certain
of the towers yielded, a great terror fell upon the Jews; and
before the Romans got over the breach they had made, they
betook themselves to flight.

Thus becoming master of the wall, Titus placed his ensigns
' upon the towers, and made joyful acclamation for the victory
they had gained, as having found the end of the war much
lighter than its beginning. For when they had possession
the last wall without any bloodshed, they could hardly believe
what they found to be true. Seeing nobody to oppose them,
they stood in doubt as to what it meant. But when they
went in numbers into the lanes of the city, with their swords
drawn, they slew those whom they overtook without mercy,
and set fire to the houses whither the Jews were fled, and
burnt every soul in them. And when they entered the houses
to plunder them, they found in them entire families of dead
men, and the upper rooms full of corpses of those who died
by famine. .

" When Titus saw the solid altitude and the largeness of the
several stones, and the exactness of their joints, as also how
great was their breadth, and how extensive their length, he
said, {We have certainly had God for our assistant in this
war, and it was no other than God who ejected the Jews out
of these fortifications, for what. could the hands of man, or any
machines, do to'wards overthrowing these towers?" He
gave orders that they should now demolish the entire city,
leaving the towers of Phasaelis, Hippicus, and Mariamne, and
so much of the wall as enclosed the city on the west side.
This wall was spared to afford an encampment for those who
were to remain in garrison, and the towers to demonstrate to
posterity what kind of a city it was, and how Well fortified,
which the Roman valour had subdued. All the rest of the
wall was. so thoroughly laid even with the ground that there
' was left nothing to make those 'who came thither believe it
had ever been inhabited. " This," adds the'historian, "was
the end to which Jerusalem came,--a city of great magnificence
and of mighty fame among all mankind. .

, To commemorate this victory of Titus, the Roman senate,
after his death, erected a magnificent tr'iumphal arch, which to
' this day stands on the highest point of the Via Sacra, not far'.
from the Colosseum. The two carved tablets are the best
known of all Roman remains. One represents Titus on a
triumphal car; the other the Jewish captives; the golden table,
the seven-branched golden candlestick, silver trumpets, and
. other spoils from the'temple. Whilst the Colosseum, the
Forum, and the palaces of the Caesars are in ruins, this arch
stands as a monumental record of the destruction of Jerusalem
by the Romans. '
HE time is not very remote when the traffic in human
beings for slavery was openly defended in the British
Parliament. A great advance in the annals of humanity was
made, when the slave trade, through the exertions of Clarkson,
Wilberforce, and other Christian men, was denounced, and
slave traders ordered to be treated as pirates and robbers
of the worst class. Although this resolution was assented
to by other civilized nations, it is England which has mainly
laboured, at much expenditure of life and treasure, to _put
down the nefarious traffic. We would not now refer to the
crimes and cruelties of former days, were it not that voices
are again being heard, not exactly defending the slave trade,
but objecting to the employment of British ships and men
in this humane service. There is danger, in fact, of the
national conscience being deadened, and the national efforts
relaxed in this matter. If our cruisers were withdrawn, -_
there is every likelihood of the trade being revived, for there
are still countries where slavery flourishes. Many travellers
in Africa have described the fearful scenes connected with
what Dr. Livingstone called "this plague spot of the world."
Even worse than the fatal journeys of the slave gangs towards
the coast are "the horrors of the middle passage." To show
what these were, and may still be, we give part of the narra-
tive of the capture of a Spanish slaver by a British ship, the '
Nari/x Slar. The capture was witnessed by Dr. Walsh, a'
physician on board returning to England from Brazil. '

The Spanish ship had taken on board 562 slaves, and had
been out seventeen days, during. which she had thrown over-
board fifty-five dead bodies. On being sighted she made all sail,
but the British ship gained on her, and after a chase 'of thirty
hours, got within gun-shot and made her heave to.

The slaves were all enclosed under grated hatchwaysf
between decks. The space was so low, that they sat between,2 54 Capture of a Spams/z SlaveS/zz'p.

each other's legs, and stowed so close together, that there was
no possibility of their lying down, or at all changing their
position, by night or day. As they belonged to, and were
shipped on account of, different individuals, they were all
branded like sheep, with the owners' marks of different forms.
These were impressed under their breasts, or on their arms,
and, as the mate informed me, with perfect indifference,
" burnt with the red-- hot 1ron.'

As soon as the poor creatures saw us looking down at them,
their dark and melancholy visages brightened up. They
perceived something of sympathy and kindness in our looks,
which they had not been accustomed to, and feeling instinct-
ively that we were friends, they immediately began to shout '
and clap their hands.

Some, however, hung down their heads in apparently
hopeless dejection; some were greatly emaciated, and some,
particularly children, seeme'd dying. But the circumstance
which struck us most forcibly was, how it was possible for
such a number bf human beings to exist, packed up and
wedged together as tight as they could cram, in low cells, three
feet high, the greater part of which, except those immediately
under the grated hatchways, were shut out from light and air,
and this, when the thermometer, exposed to the open sky,
was standing in the shade at 89deg. The space between decks
was divided into two compartments, 3 feet 3 inches high, the
size of one was 16 feet by 18, and of the other 40 by 21 , into
the first were crammed the women and girls, into the second
the men and boys ; 226 fellow-creatures were thus thrust into
one space 288 feet square, and 336 into another space 800'
feet square. We also found manacles and fetters of different

kinds; but it appears that they had all been taken off before
we boarded.' The heat of these horrid places was so great,

and the odour so offensive, that it was quite impossible to enter
them, even had there been room. They were measured as
above when the slaves had left them, the officers insisting that
the poor suffering creatures should be 'brought on deck to getCapture of a 57mm}; Slave 5/12}. 255

air and water. It was then that the extent of their sufi'erings
was exposed in a fearful manner. They all rushed like maniacs
to the water. No entreaties, or threats, or blows could restrain
them; they shrieked and struggled, and fought with one
another, for a drop of this precious liquid, as if they grew rabid
at the sight of it. There is nothing which slaves, in' the mid-
passage, suffer from so much as want of water. It is sometimes
usual to take out casks filled with sea-water as ballast; and when
the slaves are received on board, to start the casks, and re-
fill them with fresh. On one occasion, a ship from Bahia
neglected to change the contents of the casks, and, on the
mid-passage, found, to their horror, that they were filled with
nothing but salt-water. All the slaves on board perished.

I was informed by my friends, who had passed so long a
time on the coast of Africa, and visited many ships, that this
was one of the best they had seen. The height sometimes
' between decks was onlyeighteen inches; so that the unfortunate

beings could not turn round, or even on their sides, the
elevation being less than the breadth of their shoulders; 'and
here they are usually chained to the decks by the neck and-
. legs. , In such a place the sense of misery and suffocation is so
great, that the negroes, like the English in the Black Hole at
Calcutta, are driven to frenzy. They had, on one occasion,
taken a slave vessel in the river Bonny, the slaves were
stowed in the narrow space between decks, and chained
together. They heard a horrid din and tumult among them, and
could not imagine from what cause it proceeded. They opened
the hatches, and turned them up on deck. They were
manacled together in twos and threes. Their horror
may be well conceived, when they found a number of
them in different stages of suffocation; many of them were
foaming at the mouth, and in the last agonies,--many were
dead. A living man was sometimes dragged .up, and his
_ companion was a dead body ;' sometimes, of the three attached
- to thetsame chain, one was 'dying and another dead. The
tumult they, had heard was the frenzy of these suffocating2 56' Saved from a Flodtzhg Sepulc/zre.

wretches in the last state of fury and desperation, struggling

to extricate themselves. When they were all dragged up,_
.nineteen were irrevocably dead. Many destroyed one anbther

in the hopes of getting room to breathe; men strangled those

next them, and women drove nails into each other's brains.

Many unfortunate creatures, on other occasions, took the first _
opportunity of leaping overboard, and getting rid, in this way,

of an intolerable life. Sometimes a mortal malady had struck

' them from which they never could recover. They used to

lie down in the water' of the lee-scuppers, and notwithstanding

every care, pined away to skin and bone, wast-ed with fever

and dysentery; and when at length they were consigned to

the deep, they were mere skeletons.

It is an honour to England to lead the way in putting down
the slave trade, and instead of withdrawing our cruisers,
these ought to be the swiftest and strongest steamers that
can beobtained. All success to them in their service i And
still better, may the noble efforts of men like Livingstone
and Gordon, and other Christian Englishmen in Africa, avail
to put an end to this inhuman traffic! '

 

SAVED FROM A FLOATING SEPULCHRE.

N the month of April 1884, one of the great transatlantic
steamers, the Slate of Florida, was lost through collision
with a barque. Both vessels soon sank, and only afew of those
on board either Ship were saved. One of the survivors had
a wonderful escape. Most of the boats foundered. 5 A passing
. ship next day picked up several sailors, clinging to the keel of
a capsized boat, in a state of extreme exhaustion. Singular'
to say, one man was underneath-the capsized boat throughout
the night, having managed to secure himself above the bars.
His comrades heard him beneath them, but could do nothing
to relieve him. In the morning, when they were picked up,
the bottom of the boat had to be broken through to get him
out. He had_ swooned or become unconscious, probably from -
the exhausted air, which yet buoyed up the boat. With great
difficulty he recovered.

The adventure was so remarkable that it recalled a still
more strange escape, not from a' capsized boat, but from' a
capsized- ship. The men were inside the hull when the ship
turned over, and had no chance of escape'by boats or by
swimming. Most of the crew perished, but some escaped in
the remarkable way which we are about to narrate, from the-
account given in the T x'mes, to which is appended the certified
report of Lloyd's agent, who took down the statements and
depositions ofwthe survivors. The escape took .place many
years ago, but is curious'enough to be worth telling anew.

The brig Nm'na, of Dunkirk, sailed thence on Saturday,
October -3lst, 1840, under the command of Captain Pierre
Everard, with a cargo of oil and canvas for Marseilles. Her
burthen was about 114 tons, and her crew consisted of seven
persons, including the captain and his nephew, fourteen years
old. '

At three in the afternoon of Monday, November 16th, they
were forced to heave to in -a gale of wind, about ten or-twelve
leagues south-west of the Scilly Islands. At seven the same
evening, still laying to under close-reefed maintopsail and
balanced reefed mainsail, a heavy sea struck'the vessel, and
she suddenly capsized, turning completely bottom up.

The only man on deck at the time was named Boumelard,
who was instantly engulfed in the ocean. In the forecastle
were three seamen, named Vincent, Vantaure, and Jean Marie. -
- The two former, by seizing hold of the Windlass bits, succeeded
in getting up close to the keelson, and so kept their heads
above water. Poor Jean Marie was not so fortunate. He
must have been in some measure entangled, as after con-
vulsively grasping the heel of Vantaure for a few seconds, he
let go his hold and was drowned. His body was never seen

17
afterwards. The other two, 'finding' that the shock of the
upset had started the bulkhead between'the. forecastle and the
hold, and that the cargo itself had fallen down on the deck,
contrived to draw themselves on their faces close alongside the
keelson (it could not be called on their hands and knees for
want of he1ght towards the stern of the ship, from whence they
thought they heard some voices.
At the time of the accident the captain, the mate, Jean Gallo,
and the boy Nicolas were in the cabin. The captain caught
the boy 1n his arms, under the full impression that their last
moment had arrived. The mate succeeded' in wrenching open
the trap-hatch in the cabin deck, and in clearing out some
casks, which were jammed in the Iazaretto (a sort of small
triangular space between cabin floor and keelson where stores
are generally stowed away). Having effected this he scrambled
up into the vacant space arid took the boy from the hands of
the captain, whom he then assisted to follow them. In about
an hour they were joined by Vincent and Vantaure from the
forecastle. . , .
They were then five individuals closely cooped together.
' As they sat they were obliged to bend their bodies from want
of height above them, while the water reached as high as
> their waists, from which irksome position one at a time
obtained some relief by stretching at full length on the barrels
in the hold, squeezing himself up close to the keelson. They
were able to distinguish between day and night by the light
striking from above into the sea, and being reflected up through

the cabin skylight and then into the Iazaretto through the
tophatch in the cabin floor.

The day and night of Tuesday the 17th, and the day of
Wednesday the 18th, passed without food, without relief, and
almost without hope; but still each encouraged the others
when no one could really entertain' hope for himself. They
endeavoured to assuage the pangs of hunger by chewing the
bark stripped ofi' from the hoops of the casks. Want of fresh
air threatening them with death by suffocation, the mate
worked almost incessantly for 'two days.and one night in . '
endeavouring with his knife to cut a hole through the hull.
Happily the knife broke before he had succeeded in accom-
plishing his object, the result of which must have proved fatal,
as the confined air alone preserved the vessel in a sufficiently
buoyant state. _ '

In the dead of the night of Wednesday, the 18th, the vessel
suddenly struck heavily. On the third blow the stern dropped
so much that all hands Were obliged to make the best of their
way, one by one, further forward towards the bows, . in
attempting which poor Vincent was caught by the water and
drowned, falling down through the cabin floor and skylight.

After the lapse of an hour or two, finding the water to ebb,
Gallo got. down into the cabin, and while seeking for the
hatchet which was usually kept there was forced to rush again
into'the lazaretto to avoid being drowned by the sea, which
rose on him with fearful rapidity. .Another hour or two of
long sufiering succeeded, when they were rejoiced to see by
the dawning of the day of Thursday, the 19th, that the vessel .
was fast on rocks, one of which projected up through the sky-
light. The captain then went down into the cabin and found
that the quarter of the ship was stoved, and'looking through
the opening he called out to his companions,' "Grace a Dieu,
mes enfans, nous sommes 'sauves ; je vois un homme a terre."
Immediately after this the man approached and put in his
hand, which the captain seized, almost as much to the terror
of the poor. man as to the intense delight of 'the captain.
Several people of the neighbourhood were soon assembled,.the
side of the ship was cut open, and the four poor ifellows
were liberated from a floating sepulchre, after an entombment
of three days and three nights in the mighty deep.' The spot
where the vessel struck is called Porthelick; in the island of
St. Mary's, Scilly. She must have been driven on the rocks
soon after midnight, at about the period of high water, and
was discovered lying dry at about 'seven o'clock on Thursday
morning by a man accidentally passing along the cliffs. 'In.
another half hour the'returning tide would have sealed their
fate. The body of Vincent was thrown on the rocks at a short
distance from the wreck, and was interred in the burial ground of
St. Mary's with the usual rites of the Established Church.

Not the least remarkable part of the narrative is that in the
afternoon of Wednesday, the 18th, the wreck, floating bottom
upwards, was fallen in with at about a league and a-half
distant from the island by two pilot boats, which took her in
tow for about an hour, but, their tow ropes breaking and night
approaching, with a heavy sea running and every appearance
of bad weather, they abandoned her, not having the least
suspicion that there were human beings alive, in the hold of
the vessel, which was floating with little more' than her keel
'above water, while had the vessel not been so taken in tow
the set of the current would have drifted her clear of. the
island into the vast Atlantic. The hull was, of course, a
complete wreck, and soon went to pieces, and only a small
portion of the cargowas saved.

The survivors experienced at the hands of the inhabitants
the utmost kindness and hospitality, which they acknowledged
with gratitude. Then follows the certificate of Lloyd's agent:

" I, the undersigned, Richard Pearce, French Consular Agent ,
and Agent to Lloyd's at Penzance, having personally taken
the depositions of the survivors, and having also conversed
with several of the inhabitants of the island (among others
Augustus Smith, Esq.), some of whom actually assisted at the
towing of the Nen'na, while others assisted at the liberation on
the 19th, hereby certify the accuracy of the foregoing state-

. ment.

THE ORIGINAL ROBINSON CRUSOE.

T is usually stated, and commonly believed, that the world-
renowned romance of Robinson Crusoe, by Defoe, was
suggested by the story of the sojourn of a Scottish sailor,
Alexander Selkirk, on the island of Juan Fernandez. In the
book " All True " will be found the authentic narrative of
Selkirk's adventures, as reported by Captain Woodes Rogers,
of the Dulze frigate, who found him on the island, and received
the relation from his own lips. Selkirk had been master of
the Cinque Ports, commanded by Captain Stradling, a ship
that came to Juan Fernandez with Captain Dampier in 1703.
On the recommendation of Dampier, Selkirk was made second
mate of the Duke, an honourable, recompense for his cruel
abandonment on the island by his former chief, Captain
Stradling. This ship was one of two privateers fitted out by
Bristol merchants, the Duke commanded by Captain Woodes
Rogers, and the Duchess by a Captain Cook. The celebrated
navigator, Captain Dampier, accompanied this expedition
merely as pilot, although during the voyage, which was one
round the world, the skill and experience'of the veteran sea-
man often proved of vast use to the younger and inferior
captains. Thus at Guayaquil, where plunder was secured _
to the value of PS21,000, with 27,000 dollars as ransom of the
town from bombardment, Dampier was in command of the
artillery; He was mainly conducive to the capture of a rich
Manilla ship off Cape Lucas, and other rich prizes; and after
many adventures piloted the privateers safely up the Thames
to Gravesend, in October 1711, laden with booty in money
and merchandize valued at PS150,000. It was some years
before this prize money was divided, and it is not certain
whether Dampier lived .to get his share of the awards.
It is to the discredit of Captain Woodes Rogers that in the
narrative of his voyage.he seldom names Captain Dampier,
and attributes to him little of the success of the expedition.262 T/ze Original Roez'mon Crusoe.

In all matters of difficulty or doubt, however, we know that
Dampier's advice was sought and followed, as might well be
the case when the old pilot had forty years' experience of
peril and adventure. It seems hard that at the end of his
long life he was obliged to' take service as pilot, when he
had formerly so many opportunities of enriching himself. But
his ambition was more for seeing the world, and describing
its wonders, than for personal gain. Humboldt, the illustrious
man of science, and Malte Brun, the distinguished geographer,
both speak with the utmost respect of Dampier, and say that
none of 'the old navigators have left records so valuable and
.trustworthy as are found in his books of travel.

I have now before me an old copy of one of his books, the
title-page of which is worth transcribing, as from it some
idea may be formed of the nature and extent of Dampier's
researches. It is as follows: "A'an VOYAGE ROUND THE
WORLD, describing particularly the Isthmus. of America, ,
several coasts and islands in the West Indies, the Isles of Cape
Verd, the passage by Terra del F uego, the South'Sea coasts of

A brief notice of this book, which contains the narrative 0f_

will presently give, but at present confine attention to the
account of a solitary man left on the island of Juan F gmandez,
where he remained above three years. .He was left there in
1681, and released in 1684, several. years before Alexander

for Dampier was in the ship which left him in 1681, and
which found him in 1684; and Dampier, during a later
voyage, commanded one of the two 'ships, the other of which
was 'commanded by Captain Stradling, the tyrannical chief,
who left Selkirk on the island in 1704. Dampier was pilot of

the Duke privateer, Captain Woodes Rogers, which took ofl'
Selkirk, after his solitary exile of four years and four months,
in 1709. He knew everything about Selkirk's case, but in his
earlier voyage he describes a previous abandonment of a
solitary man, and his stay for three years on the same island.
Here is the narrative as given in his book.

The nineteenth day (March 1683), when we looked out in
the morning, we 'saw a ship to the southward of us, coming
with all the sail she could make after us. We lay muzzled,
to let her come up with us, for we supposed her to be a
Spanish ship, come from Baldivia, bound to Lima, we being
now to the northward of Baldivia, and this being the time
of the year when ships that trade thence to Baldivia return
home. They had the same opinion of us, and therefore"
made sure to take us, but coming nearer we both found our
mistakes. This proved to'. be one Captain Eaton, in a ship
sent purposely from London for the South Seas. We hailed
each other, and the Captain came on board, and told us of his
actions on the coast of Brazil and in the River Plate. He
met Captain Swan (one that came from England to trade here)
at the east entrance into the Straits of Magellan, and they
accompanied each other through the straits, and Were separated,
after they were through, by the storm before mentioned. Both
we and Captain Eaton being bound for John Fernando's Isle,
we kept company, and we spared him bread and beef, and
he spared us water, which he took in as he passed through
'the straits. '

March 22nd, I684, we came in sight of the island, and the
next day got in and anchored in a bay at the south end of the
island, in tWenty-five fathom water, not two cables'lengths
from the shore. We presently got out our canoe, and
went ashore to see for a Moskito Indian, whom we left here
when we were chased hence by three Spanish ships in the

.year 1681, a little before we went to Arica, Captain Watlin

being then our commander, after Captain Sharp was turned,
out. - .

This Indian lived here alone above three years, and although
he was several times sought after by the Spaniards, who knew
he was left on the island, yet they could never find him. He
was in the woods, hunting for goats, when Captain Watlin
drew off his men, and the ship was under sail before he came
back to shore. He had with him his gun and a knife, with a
small horn .of powder and a few shot, which being spent, he
contrived a way, by notching his knife, to saw the barrel of
his gun into. small pieces, wherewith he made harpoons, lances,
.hooks, and a long knife, heating the pieces first in the fire,
which he struckwith his gunflint and a piece of the barrel of
his'gun which he hardened, having learnt to -do that among
the English. The hot pieces of iron he would hammer out
and bend as he pleased with stones, and saw them with his
jagged knife, or grind them to an edge by long labour, and
harden them to a good temper, as there was occasion.

All this may seem strange to those that are not acquainted
with the sagacity of the Indians; but it is no more than these
Moskito men are accustomed to in their own country, where
they make their own fishing and striking instruments, without
either forge or anvil, though they spend a great deal of time
about them. Other wild Indians, who have not the use of iron,
which the Moskito men have from the English, make hatchets
of a very hard stone, with which they will cut down trees (the
cotton tree, especially, which is a soft, tender wood), to build
their houses or make canoas; and though in working their
canoas hollow, they cannot dig them so neat and thin, yet they

'will make them fit for their service. This, their'digging 01'
hatchet work, they help out by fire, whether for the felling of
the trees or for the making the inside their canoas hollow.

' These contrivances are used particularly by the savage Indians
of Blewfields River, described in a former chapter, whose canoas
and stone-hatchets I have seen. These stone-hatchets are about
ten inches long, four broad, and three inches thick in the middle.
They are ground away flat and .sharp at both ends; right in
the midst and clear round it they make a notch, so wide and
deep thatla man might place his finger along it, and, taking a
stick or withe about four foot long, they bind it round the
hatchet-head, in that notch, and so, twisting it hard, use it as
a handle or helve, the head being held by it very fast. Nor
are other wild Indians less ingenious. Those of Patagonia,
particularly, head their arrows with flint cut or ground, which
.I have seen and admired.

But to return to our Moskito man on the isle of John F er-
nando. With such instruments as he made in that manner,
he got such provision as the island afforded, either goats or
fish. He told us that at first he was forced to eat seal, which
is very ordinary meat, before he had made hooks ; but after-
wards he never killed any seals but to make lines, cutting
their skins into thongs. He had a little house or hut, half a
mile from the sea, which was lined with goat's skin ;' his
couch or barbecu of sticks lying, along about two foot distant
from the ground, was spread with the same, and was all his
~ bedding. He had no clothes left, having worn out those he
brought from Watlin's ship, but only a skin about his waist. He
saw our ship the day before we came to an anchor, and did
believe we were English, and therefore killed three goats in
the morning, before we came to an anchor, and dressed them
with cabbage, to treat us when we came ashore. He came
then to the seaside to congratulate our safe arrival; and when
We landed, a Mosquito Indian, named Robin, first leapt ashore,
and, running to his brother Moskito man, threw himself flat
on his.face at his feet, who, helping him up and embracing
him, fell flat with his face on the ground at Robin's feet, and
was by him taken up also. We stood with pleasure to behold
the surprise and tenderness and solemnity of this interview,
which was exceedingly affectionate on both sides; and when
their ceremonies of civility were over, we, also, that stood
gazing at them, drew near, each of us embracing him We had
found here, who was overjoyed to see so many of his old
friends come hither, as he thought, purposely to fetchhim.
He was named Will, as the other was Robin. These were names
given them by,the English, for they have no names among
themselves, and they take it as a great favour to be named by
any of us, and will complain for want of it if we do not
appoint them some name when they are with us, saying of
themselves they are poor men, and have no name.

. This island is in latitude 34deg 15", and about 120 leagues
from the main. It is about twelve leagues round, full of high
hills and small, pleasant valleys, which, if manured, would
probably produce anything proper for the climate. The sides
of the mountains are part savanahs, part woodland. Savan'ahs
are clear pieces of land without woods, not because more
barren than the woodland, for they are frequently spots of as
good land' as any, and' often are intermixed with woodland.
In the Bay of Campeachy are very large savanahs, which I
have seen full of cattle; but about the River Plate are the
largest that ever I heard of--So, 60, or 100 miles in length;
and Jamaica, Cuba, and Hispaniola have many savanahs inter-
mixed with woods. Places cleared of wood by art and labour
do not go by this name, but those only which are found so in
'the uninhabited parts of America, such as this isle of John
- F ernando, or which were originally clear in other parts.

The grass in these savanahs at John Fernando is not a
long, flaggy grass, such as is usually in the savanahs in the
West Indies, but a sort of kindly grass, both thick and
flourishing the biggest part of the year. The woods afford
divers sorts of trees, some large and good timber for building,
but none fit for masts. The cabbage trees of this i51e are but '
small and low, yet afford a good head, and the cabbage very
sweet. ' '

The savanahs are stocked with goats in great herds,'but
those that live'on the east end of the island are not so fat as
' those on the west end, for though there is .much more grass
and plenty of water in every valley, nevertheless they thrive
not so well here as on the West end, where there is less food,
and yet there are found greater flocks, and those, too, fatter
and sweeter. '

That west end of the island is all high champain ground,
without any valley, and but one place to land ; there is neither '
wood nor any fresh water, and the grass short and dry.

Goats were first put on the island by John Fernando, who -
first discovered it in his voyage from Lima to Baldivia (and
discovered also another island about the same bigness, twenty
leagues to the Westward of this). From those goats these
were propagated, .and the island hath taken its name from this
its first discoverer, who, when he returned to Lima, desired a
patent for it, designing to settle here; and it was in his second
voyage hither that he set-ashore three or four goats, which
have since, by their increase, so well stocked the whole island.
But he could never get a patent for it, therefore it lies still
destitute of inhabitants, though doubtless capable of maintain-l
ing four or five hundred families by what may be produced OE
the land only. I speak much within compass, for the savanahs
would at present feed one thousand head of cattle, besides
goats; and the land, being cultivated, would properly bear
corn or wheat, and good peas, yams, or potatoes, for the land
in their valleys and sides of the mountains is of a good, black,
fruitful mould. The sea about it is likewise very productive
of its inhabitants. Seals swarm as thick about this island as
if they had no other place in the world to live in, for there is
not a bay nor rock that one can get ashore on but is full of
them. Sea lions are here in great companies, and fish, par-
ticularly snappers and rock-fish, are so plentiful, that two
men, in an hour's time, will take, with hook and line, as many
as will serve one hundred men.

<<I it an a- at:

There are only two bays in the whole island where ships

them is a rivolet of good fresh water. Either of these bays
may be fortified with little charge, to that degree, that fifty
men in each may be able to keep off one thousand; and there
is no coming into these bays from the west end, but with great
difficulty, over the mountains, where, if three men are placed,
they may keep down as many as come against them on any
side. This was partly experienced by five Englishmen that
Captain Davis left here, who defended themselves against a
great body of Spaniards who landed in the bays, and Came
here to destroy them; and though the second time' one of
their consorts deserted and fled to the Spaniardsdeg,'yet the
other four kept their ground, and were afterward .taken in
from hence by Captain Strong, of London.

We remained at John Fernando sixteen days. Our sick
men Were ashore all the time, and one of Captain Eaton's
doctors (for he had four in his ship) tending and feeding them
with goat and several herbs, whereof here is plenty growing
in the brooks, and their diseases were chiefly scorbutic.

 

CAPTAIN DAMPIER AND THE BUCCANEERS.

HE name of Captain Dampier has been associated in

thistory with the buccaneers of America. ln'point of
fact he spent a part of his life among them, and the ships
which are called privateers in his books were pirates to all
intents and purposes. In the time of the great war with
Spain, it was common to send out ships as privateers, autho-
rized to attack the enemies of England wherein they could
be met with, and to pay their own expenses by the plunder
they could take. After peace was restored, this irregular war
in foreign parts and at sea was continued, especially by English
and French freebooters, the former being known by the name
of buccaneers, and the latter as filibustiers. Buccaneer is said
to be derived from the word ." boucan," which was the name
given by the Carib Indians to the dry beef prepared for food ;
and the huts where the meat was smoked also had the same .
appellation. The various names of privateers, pirates, free-
booters, filibustiers, sea-rovers, and others, were all merged .
'gradually in that of buccaneers. They were a people'consist-
ing of adventurers of various nations, many of them criminals
and outlaws, leagued together sometimes for common plunder
or common defence, but often separated into rival bands of
robbers. '

One of the current maxims with all buccaneers was, "No
peace beyond the Line." The settlements on the American
coasts and islands were all originally Spanish; and against
these colonial stations the buccaneers waged unceasing war.
There was not the same disgrace attached to the cause or to
the name of buccaneers, that their cruelty and crimes after-
wards fastened upon them. Hence, there appeared among
them at first some men, like Dampier, who deemed the service
only a continuance of the privateering expeditions of the
heroes of the war-time, such as Drake, Raleigh, and Cavendish.
Indeed, some of the most noted buccaneers had sailed in early
life with these gallant commanders. But a more desperate
and ferocious set of leaders soon came to the front, such as
'the Frenchmen Lolonnois and Montbar, the Dutchman Mans-
velt, and the Englishman, or rather Welshman, Morgan.

This Morgan became the most powerful and celebrated of
all the buccaneer leaders; At first he served under Mansvelt,
on whose death he assumed command of a barque, which had
already carried terror and devastation to many a Spanish
settlement. By degrees his power grew, his successes attract-
ing numbers of desperate villains, and he had at one time a
fleet of fifteen armed ships, and above two thousand men under
his command. Some of his enterprises, such as the capture
of Porto Bella and of Panama, were deeds of great daring,
and brdught immense wealth as well as much renown to the.
captors. _ But the leader was a cruel, sordid, brutal man--a
disgrace not only to the English name but to human nature:
His -crue1ties often shocked even his lawless followers, as he
maintained his authority by fear alone. The atrocities com-
mitted after the storming of Panama are' too terrible to be
described, and the record of them destroys every-'vestige of
the romance that had gathered round some of the earlier
exploits of the buccaneers. Sometimes, in our own day, tales
appear about them, but they can be read with pleasure only
by those who take delight in the lowest kinds of Police News
or other criminal literature. Morgan acquired so much money
that he was able to procure from the venal and profligate
King Charles II. the deputy-governorship of Jamaica, and the
_-title of knighthood, so that he figures in the history of those
times as Sir Henry Morgan, Knight. He was afterwards
lemoved from his office, and being .sent home a prisoner, we
believe that he died in obscurity, during the reign of James II.
It does not appear that Dampier.ever was with Morgan, but
the "privateers" named in his books were most of them
buccaneers. Some of the ships in which he sailed were
merchantmen, but no mercantile venture in those times on
those seas was without expectation of readier and richer prizes
than could be got by trading. Captain Eaton, Captain Davis,
and notably Captain 'Swan were famous buccaneers in their
day, and with all of them Dampier sailed. He did his part in
the fighting, and more than his part in the navigation, but he
showed no keenness about the booty. His chief motives were
love of adventure and desire for knowledge, and fortunately
he always kept a journal, in which he carefully entered his
notes and observations. Of some of the countries visited
during his long wanderings there are not to this day more
valuable descriptions and more exact information. His
association with the buccaneers left his name for a time under
a cloud, but justice has since been done to his memory. -He
was a humane and temperate, as well as a brave and intelli-
gent man. He detested the cruelty and loathed the vices of
his associates although he, strangely enough, makes no attempt
either to justify or to excuse his own presence among them.
In his old age he seems to have had remorseful feelings as to
his earlier career, but at the time he had no compunction as
to privateering. The fact of his remaining poor to the last
proves that he had no base motive in belonging to such
banditti, and his published works attest his zealous and
laudable desire for obtaining and imparting knowledge.

His chief work, the "' New Voyage Round the World," is
dedicated to the Hon. Charles Montague, then President of the
Royal Society, and in the dedication, while deprecating criticism
of a book written by one of no profession of learning he says,
" Yet dare I avow, according to my narrow sphere and poor
abilities, a hearty zeal for the promoting of useful knowledge,
and of anything that may never so remotely tend to my
country's advantage."

In the Introduction, he tells, in the most artless and straight-
forward way, how he got among the buccaneers. He tells
how he sailed, in 1679, in the Loyal Merchant bound for
Jamaica, as a passenger, " intending to go thence to the
Bay of Campeachy, in the Gulf of Mexico, to cut log-wood ;
where in a former voyage I had spent three years in that
employ." Some English goods brought from home, he sold at
Port Royal, and stocked himself with such commodities as he
knew he could dispose of among the Campeachy log-wood
cutters. But a friend at Port Royal, Mr. Hobby, persuaded
him to go a short trading voyage to the country of the Moskito
Indians. He assented, because he wanted money'to complete
the purchase of a small estate in Dorsetshire, near his native
-county of Somerset. _

" Soon after our setting out we 'came to an anchor again in
Negril Bay at the west end of Jamaica; but finding there
Captain Sawkins, Sharp, and other privateers, Mr. Hobby's
men all left him to go with them, upon an expedition they had
contrived, leaving not one with him beside myself; and being

' thus left alone, after three or four days' stay with Mr. Hobby,
I was the more easily persuaded to go with them too."
Captain Sawkins _was at first the leader, but on his being
slain in an attack on Puebla Nova, the majority wished to
make Captain Sharp the commander. A minority disapproved
of this, including Dampier, who then started with a band of
about fifty men, in a launch or long-boat, and two canoes, or
canoas, as he always calls them. There were forty-four
whites, a Spanish Indian, two Moskito Indians, expert in spear-
ing fish, turtles, and manatees, or sea-cows; also five negro
slaves. After a journey across the Isthmus of Panama,' on the
North Sea Dampier found quite a fleet of privateers, eight
vessels, four English, one Dutch, and three French.

We are not able to give details of the various expeditions
and adventures of the years from 1681 to I685,_but one extract
in the journal of the latter year contains some interesting
personal references, and will serve also as a good specimen of
the style of the narrative. It is a description of New Panama,
and an incident that occurred there.

Oid' Panama was formerly a famous place, but it was taken
by Sir Henry Morgan about the year'1673, and at that time
great part of it was burned to ashes, and it was never re-
edified since.

New Panama is a very fair city, standing close by the sea,
' about four miles from the ruins of the old town. It gives
name to a large bay, which is famous for a great many navi-
gable rivers, some whereof are very rich in gold. It is also
very pleasantly sprinkled with islands, that are not only pro-
fitable to their owners, but very delightful to the passengers
and seamen that sail by them. New Panama is encompassed
on the back side with a pleasant country, which is full of
small hills and valleys, beautified with many groves and spots
of trees, that appear in the savannahs like so many little
islands. This city is encompassed with a high stone wall.
The houses are said to be of brick. Their roofs appear
higher than the top of the city wall. It. is beautified with a
great many fair churches and religious houses, besides the
president's-house and other eminent buildings, which alto-
gether make one of the finest objects that I did ever see,
in America especially. There are a great many guns on
her .walls, most of which look toward the land. They had
none at all against the sea when I first entered those seas
with Captain Sawkins, Captain Coxon, Captain Sharp, and
others, for till then they did not fear any enemy by sea, but '
since then they have planted guns clear round. This is a
flourishing city by reason it is a thoroughfare for all imported
or exported goods and treasure, to and from all parts of Peru
and Chili, whereof their storehouses are never empty. The
road, also, is seldom or never without ships. Besides, once in
three years, when the Spanish Armada comes to Portobel

then the Plate Fleet, also, from Lima, comes hither With the
king's treasure, and abundance of merchant ships full of goods
and plate. At that time the city is full of, merchants and
gentlemen, the seamen are busy in landing the treasure and
.goods, and the carriers ~or caravan masters employed in carry-
ing it overland on mules, in vast droves every day, to
Portobel, and bringing back European goods from thence.
Though the city be then so full, yet, during this heat of
business, there is no hiring of an ordinary slave under a piece
of eight a day. Houses, also chambers, beds, and victuals are
then extraordinary dear.

Now I' am on this subject, I think it will not be amiss to
give the reader an account of the progress of the Armada from
Old Spain, which comes thus every three years into the Indies.
Its first arrival is at Cartagena, from whence, as I have been
told, an express is immediately sent overland to Lima, through
the southern continent, and another by sea to Portobel, with
two packets of letters, one for the Viceroy of Lima, the other
for the Viceroy of . Mexico. I knew not which, way that of
Mexico goes after its arrival at Portobel, whether by land or
sea, but I believe by sea to La Vera Cruz. That for Lima is
sent by land to Panama, and from thence by sea to Lima.

Upon mention of these packets I shall digress yet a little
further, and acquaint my reader, that before my first going.
over into the South Seas with Captain Sharp, and, indeed,

18
before any privateers, at least, since -Drake and Oxenham,
had gone that way which We afterwards went, except La
Sound, a French captain, who, by Captain Wright's instruc-
tions, had ventured as far as Cheapo town with a body of
men,' but was driven back again. I being then on board
Captain Coxon's ship along with three or four more pri-
vateers, about four leagues to the east of Portobel, we took
the packets bound thither from Cartagena. We opened a
great quantity of the merchants' letters, and found the con-
tents of many of them to be very surprising, the merchants of
several parts of Old Spain thereby informing their correspond-
ents of Panama and elsewhere of a certain prophecy that
went about Spain that year, the tenor of which was, That
there would be 'English privateers that year in the West
Indies who would make such great discoveries as to open
a door into the South Seas, which they supposed was fastest
shut, and the letters were accordingly full of cautions to their
friends to be very watchful and careful of their coasts.

This door they spake of we all concluded must, be the
passage overland through the country of the Indians of
Darien, who were, a little before this, become our friends,
and had lately-fallen out with the Spaniards, breaking off the.
intercourse which for some time they had with them; and
upon calling also to mind the frequent invitations we had from
those Indians a little before this time, to pass through their
country, and fall upon the Spaniards in the South Seas, we
from henceforward began to entertain such thoughts in earnest,
and soon came to a resolution to make those attempts which
we afterwards did, with Captains Sharp, Coxon, etc. So that
the taking these letters gave the first life to those bold under-
takings; and we took the advantage of the fears the Spaniards
were in from that prophecy, or probable conjecture, or whatever
Were, for we sealed up most of the letters again, and sent
them ashore to Portobel. '

The occasion of this our late friendship with those Indians
was thus. About fifteen years before this time, Captain
Wright being cruising near that coast, and going in among the
Samballoes Isles to strike fish and turtle, took there a young
Indian lad as he was paddling about in a canoa. He brought
him aboard his ship, and gave him the name of John Gret,
clothing him, and intending to breed him among the English.
'But his Moskito strikers, taking a'fancy to the boy, begged
him of Captain Wright, and took him with them at their
return into their own country, where they taught him their
art, and he married a wife among-'them, and learnt their lan--'
guage, as he had done some broken English while he was
with Captain Wright, which he improved among the Moskitoes,
who, corresponding so much with us, do all of them smatter -
English after a sort, but his own language he had almost
forgot. Thus he lived among them for many years, till about
six or eight months before our taking these letters, Captain
Wright being again among the Samballoes, took thence another
Indian boy about ten or tWelve years old, the son of a man of
some account among'those Indians ;. and wanting a striker, he
went away to the Moskito's country, where he~took in John
Gret, Who was now very expert at it._ John Gret was much
pleased to see a lad there of his own country, and it came into.
his mind to persuade Captain Wright upon this occasion to
endeavour a friendship with those Indians, a thing our pri-
vateers had long cov'eted, but never durst attempt, having
such dreadful apprehensions of their numbers and fierceness ;
but John Gret offered the captain that he would go ashore
and negotiate the matter, who accordingly sent him in his -
canoa till he.was near the shore, which of a sudden was
covered with Indians, standing ready with their bows and
arrows. John Gret, who had only a cloth_about his middle,_
as .the fashibn of the Indians is, leaped then out of the
.boat, and swam, theboat retiring a little way back; and,
the Indians ashore seeing him in that habit, and hearing him
call to them in their own tongue, which he had recovered by
conversing with the boy lately taken, sufl'ered him quietly to
land, and gathered all about to hear how it was'with him.
He told them particularly that he was one of their country-
men, and how he had been taken many years ago by the
English, who had used him very kindly,- that they Were
mistaken in being so mu_ch afraid of that nation, who were
not enemies to them, but to the Spaniards. To confirm this,
he told them how well the English treated another young lad
of theirs they had lately taken, such an one's son, for this he
had learnt of the youth, and his father-was one of the com-
pany that was got together on the shore. He persuaded them,
therefore, to make a league with these friendly people, by
whose help they might be able to quell 'the Spaniards,
assuring, also, the father of the boy, that if he would but
go with him to the ship, which they saw at anchor at an
island there,--it was Golden Island, the eastermost of the
Samballoes, a place where there is good striking for turtle,--
he should have his son restored to him, and they might all
Y expect a very kind reception. Upon these assurances, twenty
or thirty of them went. off presently, in two or three canoas
laden with plantains, bananoes, fowls, etc., and Captain
Wright, having treated them on board, went ashore with
them, and was entertained by them, and presents were made
on each side. Captain Wright gave the boy to his father in a
very handsome English dress, which he had caused to be made
purposely for him ; and an agreement was immediately struck
up between the English and these Indians, who invited th
English through their country into the South Seas. '
Pursuant to this agreement, the English, when they came
upon any such design, or for traffic with them, were to give a
certain signal which they pitched. upon, whereby they might
be known. But it happened that'Mr. La Sound, the French _
captain, spoken of a little before, being then one of Captain
Wright's men, learnt this signal, and staying ashore at Petit
- Guavres, upon Captain Wright's going thither soon after, who
had his commission from thence, he gave the other French
there suchpan account of the agreement before mentioned, and
the easiness of entering the South Seas thereupon, that he got
at the head of about one hundred and twenty of them, who
made that unsuccessful attempt upon Cheapo, as I said,
making use of the signal they had learnt for passing the'
Indians' country, who at that time could not distinguish so
well between the several nations of the Europeans as they
can since.

From such small beginnings arose those great stirs that
have been since made all over the South Seas--viz., from the
letters we took, and from the friendship contracted with these
Indians by means of John Gret. Yet this friendship had like
to- have been stifled in its infancy, for within a few months
after, an English trading sloop came on this coast from
Jamaica, and John Gret, who by this time had advanced
himself to be a grandee among these Indians, together with ,
five or six more of that quality, went off to the sloop in their
long gowns, as the custom is for such to wear among them.
Being received aboard, they expected to find everything
friendly, and John Gret talked to them in English; but
these Englishmen, having no knowledge at all 'of what had
happened, endeavoured to make them slaves, as is commonly
done; for, upo'n carrying them to Jamaica, they could have
sold them for PS10 or ,5 12 apiece. But John Gret and the
rest perceiving this, leaped all overboard, and were by the
others killed, every one of them, in the water. The Indians
on shore never came to the knowledge of it; if they had, it
would have endangered our correspondence. Several times
after, upon our conversing with them, they inquired of us
what was become of their countrymen; but we told them we
knew not, as, indeed, it was a great while after that we heard
this story; so they concluded the Spaniards had met with
them, and killed or taken them.

But to return to the account of the progress of the Armada,
'which we left at Cartagena. After an appointed stay there of
about sixty days, as I take it, it goes thence to Portobel, where
it lies thirty days, and no longer. Therefore the Viceroy of'
Lima; on notice of the Armada's arrival at Cartagena, imme-
diately sends away the king's treasure to Panama, where it is
landed, and lies ready to be sent to Portobel upon the first
news of the Armada's arrival there. This is the reason,
partly, of their sending expresses so early to Lima, that upon
the Armada's first coming to Portobel, the treasure and goods
may lie ready at Panama to be sent away upon the mules;
V and it requires some time for the Lima fleet to unlade, because
the ships ride not at Panama, but at Perica, which are three
small islands two leagues from thence. The king's treasure
is said to amount commonly to about 24,000 of pieces of
eight, besides abundance of merchants' money. All this
treasure is carried on mules, and there are large stables at
both places to lodge them. Sometimes the merchants, to steal
the custom, pack up money among goods, and send it to Venta
I de Cruz'es, on the river Chagre, from thence down the river,
and afterwards by sea'to Portobel, in which passage I have
known a whole fleet of periagos and canoas taken.

The merchants who are not ready to sail the thirtieth _day
after the Armada's arrival, are in danger to be left behind,
for the ships all Weigh the thirtieth day precisely, and go to .
the harbour's mouth; yet sometimes, on great importunity,

' the admiral may stay a week longer, for it is impossible that
all the merchants should get ready, for want of men. When
the Armada'departs from Portobel, it returns again to Cartagena,
by which time all the king's revenue which comes out of the
country is got ready there. Here, also, meets them again a
great ship, called'the Paltache, one of the Spanish galeons,

' which, before their first arrival at Cartagena,'goes from the

rest of the Armada on purpose to gather the tribute of the
coast, touching at the Margaritas and other places in her way
thence to Cartagena, as Punta de-Guaira, Maracaybo, Rio de

' - la Hacha, and Sancta Martha, and at all these places takes in

treasure for the king. After the set stay at Cartagena, the
Armada goes away to the Havana, in the isle of Cuba, to meet -
there the flota, which is a small number of Ships that go to
La Vera Cruz, and there takes in the effects of the city and
country of Mexico, and what is brought thither in the ship
which comes thither every year from the Philippine Islands;
and, having joined the rest at the Havana, the whole Armada
sets sail for Spain, through the Gulf of Florida. The ships in
the South Seas lie a great deal longer at Panama before they
return to Lima. The merchants and gentlemen which come
from Lima stay as little time as they can at Portobel, which
is at the best but a sickly place, and at this time is very full
of men from all parts. But Panama, as it is not overcharged
with men so unreasonably as the other, though very full, so it
enjoys a good air, lying open to the sea wind, which riseth
commonly about ten ,or eleven o'clock in the morning, and
continues till eight or nine o'clock at night; then the land
wind comes, and continues to blow till eight or nine o'clock
in the morning.

There are no woods nor marshes near Panama, but a brave,
dry, champain land, not subject to fogs nor mists. The wet
season begins in the latter end of May, and continues till
November. At that time the sea breezes are at S.S.W., and
,the land winds at N. At the dry season the winds are most
betivixt the E.N.E. and the N., yet off in the bay they are
commonly at 5., but not always. The rains are not so ex-
cessive about Panama itself as on either side of the bay,
yet in the months of June, July, and August, they are
severe enough. Gentlemen that come from Peru to Pa-
nama, especially, in these months, cut their hair close, to
preserve them from fevers, for the place is sickly to them,
because they come out of a country which never hath any
rains or fogs, but enjoys a constant>> serenity; but I am apt
to believe this city is healthy enough to any other people.
Thus much for Panama.

On reading this account of the Armada, and of the galleons,
with the rich treasure for the king of Spain, we can hardly
wonder at the keen efi'orts of the buccaneef's to seize their
share of the booty. The adventures of Dampier in the years
he stayed with them, and afterwards 'in the islands of the28o Armz'm'us Vameery's-Tmae/s m 'Asza.

Eastern seas, are full of varied interest; and we do not
know any book of old travel so well worthy of being re-
printed than Captain William Dampier's "New Voyage
Round the World."

ARMINIUS VAMBE'RY'S TRAVELS IN ASIA.

RMINIUS VAMBERY, Professor of Languages in the

._ University of Buda-Pesth, is famous. as a learned
scholar, and is even better known as an adventurous traveller.
There are few who have not heard of his going, in the disguise
of a Mohammedan Dervish, to visit the Khanates of Khiva
and Bokhara, at a time when no European could venture to
. show himself in those barbarous regions, except at the risk of
almost certain death. Bokhara had specially been aplace sadly
notorious from the death of Stodart and Conolly, of the Indian
Service, and from the detention of Dr. Wolfl', who bravely
volunteered to go to inquire if other Europeans were in danger
from the cruel Ameer. Wolfi" was -with difficulty ransomed,
after undergoing long and severe imprisonment. It was at
this very time that Vambery ventured to visit Bokhara. In
his book of "Travels in Central Asia," published after his return,
he writes, "I shuddered when I passed the dungeons of the
Ameer, where, perhaps, many who preceded me had been
murdered, and where, even at that moment, three wretched

* To the last of Dampier's voyages, that in which he went as pilot to
Captain Woodes Rogers, in 1708, we have already alluded. It will
interest our readers to know that in the London Gazelle of 18th April, 1703,
it is stated that " Captain Dampier, presented by His Royal Highness the
'Lord High Admiral, had the honour of kissing Her Majesty's (Queen
Anne's) hand before departing on-a voyage to the West Indies." It was
not a successful voyage. One object was to attack the famous Manilla
galleon, which was done, but the Spaniards beat 03' and nearly captured
Dampier's ship, the SI. Geolge.Armmz'us' V ambery's Travels m A 5221. 281 "

Europeans were languishing so far from their country and
every possible succour."

By his successful disguise Vambery escaped detection, and
his account of his travels, both in his book and at the meetings
of the British Association and other Societies, when in
England, attracted much attention and curiosity as to these
, regions, and as to the personal history of the traveller Who
described them.

In the twenty years that have since passed great changes
have taken place. The khanates of Khiva and Bokhara are
now subject to Russia, and though Vambery fosters the British
dread of Russian advance in Asia, the truth is that the more
rapid the progress of Russia, and the more complete its
conquests, the better it is for Asiatic civilization. In these
khanates order is now maintained, justice is secured, and
slavery abolished. The trade of the. Russians with Central
Asia had long been greater than with all other foreign countries
together. There was, therefore, good reason for their military
interference in regions where peaceful commerce needed pro-
tection. Asia is wide enough both for English'and Russian
rule, and alarm for our Indian Empire must not hinder our
rejoicing in Russian influence in more barbarous regions. If
our rule in India is such as to benefit the people of India, it
is sure, in the Providence of God, to be continued. Russian
influence can only extend there if we are found unfaithful to
our trust We say this because Vambery has helped to keep
alive the panic about Russian advances.

But we avoid political questions, and confine ourselves to
personal matters. Professor Vambery has lately written a
volume of autobiography, a narrative of his life and adventures
(T. Fisher Unwin, London) from his earliest recollections to
his last visit to England. There are things in this work not
in his earlier book of travels, and being confined to personal
narrative, the reader's liveliest interest is sustained throughout.

Beginning with the days of his childhood, he enumerates
the many difficulties which he had to overcome, and shows282 Armz'm'us Val-1721557913 Travels in A524.

how invincible his zeal must have been in the pursuit of
v knowledge, when he allowed neither poverty nor physical
infirmity to interfere with his studies, which from an early
period were directed to the attainment of great linguistic
capacity. "No one," said the reviewer of the work in the
Spectator," can read the details of Professor Vambery's life
without a feeling of mingled sympathy and admiration at the
suffering and hardship which he underwent and triumphed
over. Yet even in the worst days of his adversity he was
always able, not merely to bear up under deprivation, but to
look at the bright side of things,----two invaluable qualities for
getting through the battle of life under any circumstances,
but particularly useful to one whose struggle for existence was
long destined to be extremely arduous."

But although Vambery had to support himself from his
childhood--he began work at the age of twelve--and although
his resolve to be a savant tied him in his movements, first to
the Gymnasium at St. George, and then to the 'University at
Pressburg, he managed to see something of the-outside world,
and to enjoy his holidays as well as those who were more
fortunately situated. He passed his vacation in rambling
through the Austrian dominions, and he has no false shame in
confessing that he carried on his rambles through the charit--
able assistance and hospitality of those he came across. We
.may add, that in those days there was nothing unusual in
this, and the closing of the classes at the different Universities
always witnessed a great exodus of students, or Wander--
burschen, as they Were called, over all parts of Germany.
These pedestrian trips had a greater significance in the case

_ of Vambery, for to him they seem to have served as an
apprenticeship for his famous journey in Central Asia, in the
guise of a dervish.

While he was thus indulging that spirit of liberty which
chafed at the restraints of life in a town, Vambery was
sedulously employed in acquiring that intimate acquaintance
with foreign languages which has made him one of the most
remarkable'linguists of -our time At an early stage of his
studies his attention had been attracted to the East. The
Hungarians treasure the memory of their Oriental origin, and
a long political connection had created something more than a
bond of sympathy between them and the Turks. That feeling
_was revived and strengthened at the time of the Hungarian
insurrection, by the protection. afiorded by the Sultan to those
of the Magyar leaders who were so fortunate as to escape the
pursuit of the Russians and Austrians. It was only natural,
therefore, that Vambery should as a young man have felt
attracted towards the East, and should see in Constantinople
the gate through which he might hope to gain access to those
hidden treasures which he believed the literature and countries
of Asia would be found to contain. His study at the Press-'
burg University being' completed, he went to Constantinople.
When he arrived there his small sum of money was exhausted,
and only the hospitality of a Hungarian refugee, whom he
met by chance ,provided him with a lodging He then gained
his livelihood as tutor in a Turkish family, and by bringing
out a very useful German-Turkish dictionary first attracted
the attention of the learned in his own country. But what
-was more important towards the realisation of the plan of
Asiatic travel, which every day assumed more tangible form
in his mind, he acquired during his long residence in the
Turkish capital an' intimate acquaintance with the language,
religion, and social habits of the most orthodox or fanatical
Mahomedans. g
"I -had found," he writes, " 1n the course of my linguistic
researches in the study of Eastern Turkish a field which had
been at that time barely cultivated, and devoted to it my full
attention. Besides the manuscripts Igot hold of in the various
libraries, which were of great assistance to me in my studies,
I frequented the Tekkes (cloisters) inhabited by the Bokharists,
and provided myself, moreover, with a' view to attaining to a
thorough understanding of these works, with a teacher who
was a native of Central Asia. Mollah Khalmurad, as my284 Armt'nz'us Vambery: T rave]: in Asia.

teacher was called, acquainted me with the customs and modes .
of thought of Central Asia. I used to hang passionately
on his lips when he was relating stories about Bokhara and
Samarcand, and told of the Oxus and Jaxartes, for he had
travelled a great deal in his own country. He had already
made two pilgrimages to the Holy Cities of Arabia, and
possessed to a high degree the cunning and clear-sightedness
peculiar to every Asiatic, but particularly to the much--travelled
Asiatic."

Vambery had thus qualified himself in every way for his
meditated journey, and he tells his readers that he had learnt
" to know the whims and foibles of mankind, and had found
that man in the rude Asiatic garb was nearly the same as man
in the civilised European dress."

Not the least interesting portion of his book is the descrip-
tion of his journey through Armenia, from the port of Tre-
bizonde tothe Persian frontier, and he gives an account of

'the state of that part of the Turkish dominions in the years
that followed the close of the Crimean War. Here Vambery .
travelled as an effendi, or Turkish official; and while the
disturbed condition of the roads showed that there was no
' security for peaceful traders or ordinary travellers, the respect
exhibited towards him personally proved that the Kurd and
other marauders had then no wish to come into open collision
' with the Sultan's Government.

Arrived at Teheran, Vambery assumed the character of a
dervish. He had' to resort to much fresh finesse in order to
obtain the realisation of his main object, which was to attach
himself to some caravan proceeding into the khanates of
Central Asia. Success attended his efi'orts, and in the early
months of 1863 he left Teheran with a caravan of dervishes--
or, more correctly, of hadji pilgrims--who came for the most
part from Khokand or Kashgar. It may be doubted whether
he would have met with such complete success, but for the
co-operation of the Sultan's Minister at Teheran, who privately
informed the hadjis that Reshid Effendi, the name which
Vambery had assumed, was "the Sultan's- civil officer," and
consequently a person to be taken care of. Then follows the
deScription of his travels through the frontier provinces of
Persia to the Turcoman desert, given with an obvious regard
to effect, but still all the same very picturesquely. What
could be more graphic than the following account. of the
caravan leaving Teheran ?-- '

"The caravan 'numbered twenty-three, besides myself.
Those of my friends who could afford to hire a mule or ass
to take them to the Persian border were ready, booted and'
spurred ; the former, with pilgrims' staffs in their hands, were
' waiting, too, for the signal of departure. I observed with
astonishment that the shabby garments worn by the party in
town had been exchanged for other and far more ragged ones
hanging down in a thousand tatters, and fastened ' by means
of a rope across the back; and learned to my great surprise
that the miserable dress worn by them in town was their
best holiday attire, which was now laid aside in order to save
it. But yesterday I fancied myself a beggar in my new
costume, to-day I looked fit to be a purple-clad king amidst
my companions. Hadji Bilal at last raised his hands for a
blessing on our journey, and we had not fairly seized our
beards and said our customary Amens, when those of our
party who were to walk on foot made a rush towards the
gates, in order to get ahead of us who were seated on mules
or asses." ' .

At Khiva he was received in personal audience by the
Khan, on whom he made so favourable an impression, that he
received the useful present of a donkey, to carry him on his
further wanderings. He arrived at Bokhara during the
Ameer's absence, but he was received by Mozafl'ur Eddin a '
few weeks later at Samarcand. His impression of the former
city is expressed as follows :---" Although the squalid and
rickety buildings,-and the streets covered with sand one foot
thick did not tend to place 'noble Bokhara' in the most
favourable 'or imposing light, yet upon entering the bazaar,
and beholding the thronging multitude animating it, I could
not refrain from being intensely interested at the novel sight.
The beauty and wealth of the bazaar were not the things that
surprised me so much as the immense and multifarious variety
in races, dress, and manners which struck the eye everywhere.
. . . I was followed by a crowd of curious people, whose
embraces and handshaking became very annoying to me..
' Judging by my gigantic turban and the large Koran suspended
from my neck, they evidently took me to be some great Sheikh."
The account of the interview with the dreaded Ameer (or
'Emir, as Vambery spells it) we must give in his own words :---'
"As we were entering the interior of the city, we Were
startled to find ourselves stopped by a Mehrem, who gave us
to understand that his Badevlet (majesty)-wished to see me
alone, without my companions. My. friends Were this time
of my opinion, that this message boded ill to me. But what
was to be done but to follow the Mehrem to the palace ? After
being made to wait for about an hour I was conducted into a
room where I found the Emir reclining on a mattress of red
cloth, amidst books and papers lying about. I recited a short
Sura, accompanying it with the usual prayer for the welfare
of the governing prince,'and after saying amen, to which the
Emir responded, I sat down in close vicinity to him, without
having first received his invitation to do so. The Emir- was
struck by my bold behaviour, which was in fact in perfect
keeping 'with the character of a dervish. He fixed his eyes
severely on mine as if wishing to embarrass me, and said :--
'Hadji! I hear thou hast come from Roum to visit the
graves of Baha-ed-din and the other holy men of Turkestan ? '
' Yes, takhsir (sir) ! and besides, to be edified by thy blessed
beauty.'
'Strange; and hast thou no other object in coming here i
from such'distant lands? '
'-No, takhsirl _It has ever been the warmest wish of my
heart to visit noble Bokhara and enchanting Samarkand, upon
, whose sacred ground, as is justly observed by Sheikh Djelal,
men should walk with their heads rather than' their feet.
Besides, this is my only vocation, and I having been roaming '
now through the world for many a day as a diz'hanghesle' (a
wanderer through the world).

' How is this, a djihangheste with thy lame foot? This is
very strangeindeed.'

'Let me be thy victim, takhsirl' (This phrase answers
- our 'I beg your pardon, sir.') ' Thy glorious ancestor Timur
(Tamerlane)--may he rest in peace--was afflicted in the same
way, and yet he became a dl'ihanghir' (a conqueror of the
world).

Having bantered me in this preliminary conversation, the
Emir inquired what sort of impression Bokhara and Samar--
kand had made upon me. My answers, which I took occasion
to interlard with copious citations of Persian poetry, seemed
to make a favourable impression upon the Emir, who was a
mollah himself, and spoke Arabic pretty well; but I was not
altogether sure yet of my success with him. After the
audience had lasted for a quarter of an hour he summoned a
servant, and telling him something in a cautious undertone he
bade me follow the servant.

I quickly rose from my sitting posture and followed
as I had been bid. The servant led me through a number of.
yards and halls, whilst my mind was at the time cruelly
agitated by fears and misgivings as to my fate; my perplexed
imagination conjuring up pictures of horror, and seeing myself
already travelling on the road to the rack and that dreadful
death which was ever present to my mind. My guide showed
me, after a good deal of wandering about, into a dark room,
conveying to me by a sign that I should expect him here. I
stood still, in what state of mind any one can guess. I counted
the moments with feverish excitement--when the door opened
again. A few seconds yet of suspense and the servant
approached at last, and by the light of the opening door I saw
him holding in his hand, instead of the frightful instruments
of the executioner, a parcel carefully folded up. In it I found
a highly ornamental suit of clothing, and an amount of money
, destined for my onward journey, sent to me as a present by
the Emir. '

,As soon as I obtained possession of the parcel I hastened
away to my companions, wild with joy at my escape. They
were quite as glad of 'my success as I myself had been. I
subsequently learned that someone had sent the Emir an
equivocating report about me, in consequence of which I was
received with difiidence at first by the Emir, but succeeded in'
dissipating his mistrust, thanks to the glibness of my tongue.

None of the decayed cities of Asia made the same im-
pression on Professor Vambery as Samarcand, which " does in
truth excel all the other cities of Central Asia in its ancient
monuments, as well as in the splendour of its mosques, its
grand tombs, and new structures."

Professor Vambery returned to Europe through southern
Afghanistan and Herat. At Herat, Yakoob Khan, who after-
wards became Well known in Afghan history, penetrated his
disguise for a moment, but, was thrown off the scent by the
dervish's readiness in quoting a passage from the Koran.
With the exception of this incident, the false dervish succeeded
in deceiving all his companions and those with whom he came
into contact as to his personality. VNeither khan nor hadji
suspected him of being a European. Suspicion would have
led to discovery, and discovery would probably mean certain
death. He returned, however, at length in safety to tell
Europeans of the strange things he had seen in the lands of
Central Asia;
THE FATE OF A GERMAN WATCHMAKER IN BOKHARA

HEN Vambery was in the city of Bokhara, an incident

occurred which strikingly illustrates the perils to.

which all foreigners Were exposed in those times. It is not

found in his recently published volume, but when in England,

shortly after returning from the East, he. published the
narrative in the Leisure Hour, for August 1865.

When near Bokhara I broke the glass of my compass,-
which was in the shape of a watch, and had often done me
essential service on my journey. I call it a compass for
my European readers, but, in the eyes of my mendicant
fellow-travellers, I carried, as a dervish, a kiblenumah, that
is, such an instrument as every devout Mussulman is guided
by when travelling, as it indicates the direction in which lie
the holy cities of Mecca and Medina, towards which he must
kneel to perform his appointed devotions. When we arrived
at a station or halting-place, either by night or day, the
honour of pointing out the holy sites by the kiblenumah was
always accorded to me; but I had so often to consult this
instrument, as well on the road as at the stations, to ascertain
the right direction, that it behoved me to guard it as the apple
of my eye. ' ' ' '

Watches are scarce in Bokhara, and it is hardly possible
to find a watchmaker; so I bcgan to fear I- might have great
difficulty in procuring a new glass for my compass. For
long I inquired everywhere, till at last some one informed me
that, in a certain caravanserai, there was a clever mechanic;
but, as such artists were scarce, and his skill was highly
prized, it would not be possible for me, a mendicant, to have
my work done by him. "If I cannot give much in money,"
thought I to myself, " I will give an abundance of blessings ;"
and soon I was on my way to find the workshop of the Tartar
mechanic. I wandered'long hither and thither ere I found

I9290 Tile Fate of a Germain Watckmaeer.

' the caravanserai. A long dark passage led .to his room.
When I opened the door, I was amazed to find myself in a
neat apartment, with whitened walls and windows of oiled
paper. Such traces of European habits in the midst of the .
chief- town of Tartary astonished me, and I was still further '
puzzled at perceiving a table and chair, and, seated on the
latter, a man in a European dressing- gown and a comfortable
cap, who was busy at work, with his back towards me. "Es
selam aleikuml" (Peace be to thee I), said I in a loud voice;
and I sat down in the greatest bewilderment as to who the '
mysterious artist could be. After I had uttered the 'accus-
.tomed prayer of a dervish, he turned round, and his Tartar
countenance was so marked that I could not be deceived on'
that point; but my curiosity remained as to his dress and
furniture, when the Tartar interrupted his work with the
following conversation :--

"Do I understand by your speech that you are' from Con-
stantinople? What business has brought you here? There
are clever watchmakers in your country. You would have
made me happier if you could have brought me springs and
wheels, which get broken here."

' "Ah," said I, "that is too diflicult for such a long journey.
But tell me, how have you learned this art, if you have never
been in Constantinople ? " -

"I never was out of Bokhara. I learned this handiwork
from a European feringhee (infidel) who dwelt here for three
years in the time of the Emir Nasrullah. He was a diligent
and excellent workman, and not a bad infidel, whom the pious
Emir ordered to be put to death because he tried to return
to his native country, though many times forbidden to do so.
You' know that in Bokhara spies in various disguises are
always sent out to watch the feringhees in Bokhara, and,
when they return with the needful intelligence, they are taken."

. In spite of my. eager desire to hear more, I durst not inquire
how he was apprehended. I did, however, make an allusion
'to it, and the Tartar ,then informed me that his master often"'so "mama mu x nus 1m: um>> |.\' .m- HAKD was I LOOXYC'J 10 \u: my. LL)LIIL!ION."'
did not leave his room for days, and that he read much in a
book which_the Emir took away' after his death.

"Just where you are sitting," continued the watchmaker,
'he used to sleep; and when he awoke in the morning, he '
knelt down before what is written over your head, and
performed his devotions." .

The words "what is written over your head" filled. me
at once with the greatest agitation and most painful impatience.
For me, as a holy Dervish, to show curiosity might have been
dangerous. I recovered myself as well as I could. Without
leaving my place or speaking further, I handed him my com- '
pass to repair, and asked him to give me a looking- -glass, that
Imight see what caused the painful burning 1n my eye. No
sooner had I taken the ominous glass in my hand than I,
t1emb1ing, looked 1n it to see the reflection of the writing over
my head. After some research, I did indeed find a line, in
small German running-hand, and read the words, "In the
name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. Amen." I felt
stunned and trembled. The glass was still in my hand, and,
in spite of all my efforts, I could not conceal the pallor of my
countenance. Within me was a terrible struggle between
dread-and curiosity, these few words moved me so strongly.
Fortunately I was able to control myself, and to quiet my
emotion. I continued the conversation. I could not, however,
find out much about the poor mechanic, more than that he
came hither from Cabul and was killed; that he was a
German; and that by his skill he had- earned about two
thousand tengi, on account of which the greedy tyrant had
ordered'him to be put to death. I perceived from the words
of this man how much he was devoted to his master. To me,
who, sitting opposite to him, appeared as a holy man, he was
afraid to show his love to the infidel; yet it was evident,
not only in his words, but in his care of the furniture and
dress, which he had acquired by purchase. Nothing was
moved, nothing changed; and, strangest of all, the" writing '
was not obliterated. Perhaps, 'if I had dared to investigate292 Tim Gal/amt Defence

more narrowly, I might have discovered his name. But
how was that possible for me in my character as dervish,
and in Bokhara ? '

For long, long in my distant journeyings, there floated
before my eyes the unfortunate destiny and the handwriting
of the devout mechanic. When I recalled him to mind, I
seemed to see him as he knelt at his devotions, and in the
midst of barbaric fanaticism, calling in his mother-tongue
on that Spirit who is present to all. How ardent must have
been his supplications when carried from this spot to the
place of execution ! A year afterwards, as I returned th'rough
Persia on my way to Europe, I heard in Tabriz, from a
German residing there, that the fate of the unhappy watch-
maker was not unknown to him, for he had been told of
it by some Hadjis from Bokhara. The Italian who met
Dr. Wolfi' in Bokhara had been present at the execution ; and
a similar fate would probably await any European whose
skill might enable him to enrich himself. there.

 

THE GALLANT DEFENCE 0F RORKE'S DRIFT.

HERE have been some terrible disasters amidst the

glorious successes which have. usually brightened the
annals of the British army. In recent times no disaster more
unexpected and more overwhelming has been recorded, than
' the almost total destruction of the 24th regiment at Isandhlana,
in Zululand. _ The circumstances may be briefly recalled to
mind. The Kaflirs of Zululand, under their king, Cetewayo,
were threatening to overrun the territory of Natal, where the
white population forms but a small number compared with
the natives. It was resolved to carry war into the Zulu
territory, as the best way of protecting our own colony. Lord
Chelmsford commanded-the British force, with native allies,of Roree's Drift. 293

employed for this purpose. Entering the Zulu territory, a
halt was made at Isandhlana, or Isandula, for the name is
variously written. Lord Chelmsford went forward toward the
hilly region to reconnoitre, leaving Lieutenant-Colonel Pulleine,
with the first battalion of the 24th regiment, under strict
orders to defend the camp. Colonel Durnford, in cbmmand of
the post at Rorke's Drift, was ordered to join Colonel Pulleine,
and he arrived with a large number of mounted natives,
bringing up the number in camp to about fifteen hundred,
more than half of them British troops.

The Zulu forces, who had probably enticed Lord Chelmsford
to a distance by retiring as he advanced, now began to concen-
trate towards the camp at Isandhlana. They numbered over
twenty thousand fighting men. They formed an immensely
extended semicircle, or line with horns, closing in gradually
as they advanced. Durnford, unaware of the force of the
Zulus, went out to meet them, instead of strengthening the
camp, which could have been made into a fortress by parking
or laagering the waggons, and other defensive arrangements.
Durnford was driven back, and the whole mass of the enemy
closed in upon the, camp before preparations to receive them
could be made. It was a short and fearful struggle. While
ammunition held out the enemy was kept at bay, and many
Zulus fell, but before long it was a rout and massacre. A few
mounted men managed to reach the river some miles off, but
nearly fifteen hundred English and native troops Were slaugh-'
tered in the camp or during the flight.

Lord Chelmsford was not a dozen miles off, and heard firing,
but had no conception of danger till a solitary horseman,
Commandant 'Lonsdale, came up with the startling announce~
ment that the camp was in the possession of the enemy. He
knew no details, but having been at some distance from the
camp, in the forenoon of the 22nd January, 1879, the day of
the disaster, he was surprised to see Zulus dressed in English
uniforms, with English weapons as well as their own blood-
stained assegais. He could see also the dead lying in heaps
Not losing his presence of mind, he instantly rode off in
the direction where Lord Chelmsford had gone, escaping the
shOWer "of bullets sent after him when first observed. His
warning came just in time, for thecommander-in-chief was
leisurely and unsuspectingly returning towards the camp, having
of course failed to find the enemy among the hills. Advancing
now with great caution, and resting on the march for some
hours of the night, the light of the next morning revealed all
the hOrrors of the scene. The victorious Zulus happily did
not attack them, and Lord Chelmsford pushed on past the
camp, and crossed the river to Rorke's Drift. Here he heard
of events equally strange to him, but which stood out in
glorious contrast to the gloomy scenes of Isandhlana.

On the Same day, the 22nd January, an attack was made
by a vast multitude of Zulus, many of them with their hands
and weapons red with blood from the slaughtered troops at
the camp, on the small outpost at Rorke's Drift. Here were
two small houses, or huts, with enclosures, used as a commis--
sariat depet, and sheltering a few invalids. The post was in
charge of Lieutenant Chard, of the Royal Engineers, with a
detachment of soldiers, and the keepers of the stores, the whole
under his command numbering one hundred and thirty-nine,
all told. No danger was thought of, and no rumour of the
disaster that had occurred had reached them till the afternoon
of that terrible day. Lieutenant Chard was watching at the
." ponts " on the river, where a few men were on guard, when
two of the fugitives from the camp shouted frantically across.
They were at once ferried over, and in hasty broken words
told the startling story of that day's tragic work, and that the
whole Zulu force would be soon upon them. Hurrying to the
post, Lieutenant Chard found that Lieutenant Bromhead, of
the company of the 24th left in charge, had already learned the
news from an officer of the Native contingent, who had escaped
by swimming the river. Bromhead had at once begun to
loophole the houses, and to erect barricades with mealie bags.
All set to work in right earnest. A rude'entrenchmen-t of
piled biscuit-boxes, and every sort of material within reach,
was arranged for defence. Orders were given clearly to eVery
man as to the particular post he was to occupy, and in little
'more than an hour all were ready for the fast approaching
'storm. The invalid soldiers were in one of the huts, the
entrances to which were barricaded as strongly as'possible,
with a guard for their defence.

They had not long to wait in suspense. The Zulus were
soon descried, hurrying in swarms towards the post, three
thousand of them at the lowest estimate. Rushing forward,
they were met by a cool and steadily-aimed volley, which
checked their advance. Some sought the cover of the 'bushes
and rocks near, and others swept round to the rear.. Whenever
an assault in mass was renewed, it wasmet with the same
steady fire as at the first rush. The savages seemed furious
at being checked, after their recent triumph over a large British
force, and attacked again and again with fearless fury. -At
times the brave defenders were driven back from their rough
outwork, and the Zulus succeeded in setting fire to the house
where the invalids were, some of whom perished before they
could be moved. The conflict was maintained all through the
evening and during the night, and not till'four o'clock next
morning did the desperate assaults cease. At this time the
assailants retired, but with the intention of renewing the '
'attack, reinforced by newly-arriving hosts of Zulus. There
was no rest, however, for the holders of the fort, who set to '
work to strengthen their position for resisting fresh attacks.
The bodies of the slain were used, with'the mealie bags, and -
whatever could be found, to form the redoubt, and give shelter
for a second line of fire round the post. '

It was while thus engaged that Lord Chelmsford arrived on
the scene, with his force- that had not been engaged, and
cheered them by a few words of congratulation and praise, for
their " noble efforts and gallant defence." In a general order,
issued a few days after, he said z." The odds against them were
nearly thirty to one; but taking advantage of the material
which lay to hand, and hastily constructing with it such cover
as was' possible, this heroic little garrison was enabled to '
resist, during the space of twelve hours, the determined attacks
made upon them, and further inflicted heavy loss upon the
enemy, the killed alone being more than three times their own
number." '

The _Zulus, perceiving the accession of strength by Lord
Chelrnsford's arrival, made no further attack, and retired baflled
and enraged. The glorious success at Rorke's Drift, when
heard of in England, was hailed as the bright episode of a dark
and disastrous campaign. Its record places in all the sadder
contrast the calamity at Isandhlana, the result of incompetence
and misunderstanding painful to remember.

It only remains to present the official report of Lieutenant
Chard, the model of what such a report should be, in its
modest statement of his own service, and generous recognition
of that of his comrades, and affording a graphic sketch of an
event-which will ever be memorable in the annals of British
heroism.

Rorke's Drift, January 2 5th, I879.

Ihave to report that on the 22nd inst. Iwas left in com-
mand at Rorke's Drift, by Major Spalding, who went to
Helpmakar in order to hurry forward a company of the
24th Regiment. I was specially ordered to protect the ponts.
At 3.15 P.M. that day I was watching at the ponts, when two
men came towards us from Zululand at a gallop. They shouted
out, and were taken across the river; and I was then informed
by one of them--Lieutenant Adendorff, of Commandant
Lonsdale's regiment, who afterwards remained to assist in the
defence--of the disaster befallen at the Isandula camp, and
that the Zulus were advancing on Rorke's Drift. The other,
1 carbineer, rode on to take the news forward to' Helpmakar.

Almost immediately afterwards I received a message from
Lieutenant _Bromhead, Commander of the company of the
24th Regiment at the post, asking me to come up at once.GALLANT DEFENCE or quKR's mum. THE MORNING AFTER TIIE comme'r. [fagr 296.
I gave instructions to strike tents, and to put all stores into the
waggons, while I instantly made my way to the commissariat
store, and there found a note that had been received from the
Third Column (Lord Chelmsford's), stating that the enemy
was advancing in force against our; post, which we were to
strengthen and hold at all costs. Lieutenant Bromhead was
already most actively engaged loopholing and barricading the
store building and hospital, and also in connecting the defences
of the two buildings by walls, constructed with mealie bags
and waggons. I held a hurried consultation with him and
Mr. Dalton of the commissariat, who was activelysuperintend-
ing the work of defence, and whom I cannot sufficiently thank
for his 'most valuable services--and I entirely approved all his
arrangements. Ithen went round our position, down to the
ponts, and brought up along with their guard (onesergeant and
six men) the gear, waggons, etc. I desire to mentionlfor approval,
the offer of these pont guards, Daniels and Sergeant Milne, who,
with their comrades, volunteered to moor the ponts out in the
middle of the stream, and then to defend them from the decks,
with a few men to assist.

We arrived back at our post at 3. 30 P. M., and shortly after
an officer, with some of Durnford's Horse, came in, and asked
orders from me. I requested him to send a detachment to
observe the drifts and ponts, and to throw out vedettes in the
direction of the enemy, in order to check their advance as
much as possible, his men falling back upon the posts when
forced to retire, and thereafter to assist in the defence. 1 next -
requested Lieutenant Bromhead to station his men, and, having
seen every man knew his post, the rest of the work went
quickly on. '

At 4.20 P.M. the sound of firing was heard behind the hill to
the south. The oflicer of Durnford's Horse returned, reporting

that the enemy was now close upon us. His men, he told me, -' I

would not obey orders, but were going off towards Helpmakar,
and I myself saw them in retreat, apparently about one hundred,
going in that direction. About the same time Captain Stephen-293 7 - T/ze Gallant [Mange

son's detachment of the Natal Native contingent left us-----as
did that officer himself.
I Isaw that our line of defence was too extended for the
small number of men now left, and at once commenced an
innerentrenchment of biscuit-boxes, out of which we had soon
. completed a wall two boxes high, when about 4.50 RM. four
or five hundred of the enemy came suddenly in sight round the
hill to the south. They. advanced at a run. towards our south
wall, but were met by a well-sustained fire; yet, notwith-
standing heavy loss, they continued to advance till within fifty
yards of the wall, when their leading men encountered such
a hot fire from our front, with a cross fire from the store, that
they were checked. Taking advantage, however, of the cover
afforded by the cook-house and the ovens, they kept up thence
heavy musketry volleys ; the greater number, however, with-
out stopping at all, moved on towards the left, round our
hospital, and there made a rush upon the north-west wall and
our breastwork of mealie bags. After a short but desperate
struggle these assailants were driven back, with heavy loss,
into the bush round our works.

The main body of the enemy close behind had meantime
lined the ledge of rocks, and filled some caves overlooking us,
at a distance of one hundred yards to south, from whence they

'kept up a constant fire. Another body, advancing somewhat
more to the left than those who first attacked us, occupied a
garden in the hollow of the road, and also the bush beyond it,
in great force, taking special advantage of the bush, which we
had not had time to cut down. The enemy was thus able to
advance close to our works, and in this part soon held one
whole side of the wall, while we, on the other, kept back a
series of desperate assaults which were made on a line extend-
ing from' the hospital all along the wall as far as the bush. But '
each attack was mostsplendidly met and repulsed by our men
with 'the bayonet, Corporal Scheiss, of the Natal Native
contingent, greatly distinguishing himself by conspicuous
gallantry. The fire from the rock behind our post, though
badly directed, took us completely in reverse, and was so heavy
that we sufl'ered very severely, and at 6 P.M. were finally
forced to retire behind the entrenchment of biscuit-boxes.

All this time the enemy had been attemping to force the .
hospital, and shortly afterwards did~ set fire to the roof. The
garrison of the hospital defended the place, room by room, our
men bringing out all the sick who could be moved before they"
retired. Privates Williams, Hook, R. Jones, and W. Jones, of
the 24th Regiment, were the last four men to leave, holding
the doorway against the Zultis with bayonets, their ammuni-
tion being quite expended. From the want of interior
accommodation, and the smoke of the burning house, 'it was
found impossible to carry off all the sick, and, with most
heartfelt sorrow and regret, we could not save a few poor
fellows from a terrible fate. Seeing the hospital burning, and
desperate attempts being made by the enemy to fire the roof
of our store, we now converted two mealie-bag heaps into a
sort of redoubt, 'which gave a second line of fire all along,
Assistant-Commissary Dunn working hard at this, though
much exposed, thus rendering most valuable assistance. ..

Darkness then came on. We were completely surrounded,
and after several furious attacks had been gallantry repulsed,
We were eventually forced to retire to the middle and then to
the inner wall of our kraal, on the east of the position we at
first had. We were sustaining throughout all this a desultory
fire, and several assaults were attempted, but always repulsed
with vigour, the attacks continuing till after midnight, our men
firing with the greatest coolness, not wasting a single shot.
The light afforded by the burning hospital proved a great
advantage. At 4 A.M., on the 23rd of January, firing ceased;
and at daybreak the enemy were passing out of sight over the
hill to the south-west. We then patrolled the ground, collect-
ing arms from the dead bodies of the Zulus, and we
strengthened the position as much as possible. We were still.

to the south-west. I now sent a friendly ,Kafiir, who had
come in shortly before, with a note to the officer commanding
at Helpmakar asking help. About 8 A.M., however, the British
Third Column appeared, and at sight of this the enemy, who
had been gradually advancing towards us, commenced falling
back, as our troops approached. '

Iconsider the enemy which attacked us to have numbered
about three thousand ; we killed about three hundred and fifty.
Of the steadiness and gallant behaviour of my whole garrison
I cannot speak too highly. I wish especially to bring to your
notice the conduct of Lieutenant Bromhead, and the splendid
behaviour of his Company B. 2, 24th Regiment; of Surgeon
Reynolds, in respect of his constant attention to our wounded,

Officer Dalton, to whose energy much of our defence was due,

fight; Assistant-Commissary Dunn, and others.

HEROES OF THE VICTORIA CROSSr

FTER the close of the Crimean war, during which the
nation was aglow with patriotic feeling, and when the

heroic deeds and noble endurance of our soldiers and sailors
.excited general admiration and sympathy, it was determined
to provide a special decoration as a reward of personal valour.
Before that time the custom had been'to give medals to all
who were engaged in any campaign or conflict. There was no
discrimination in such awards, and the ordinary service medals
might be worn by those who had slight claim to the honour.
.But a decoration for conspicuous acts of individual valour'or
devotion was an object of higher ambition, .and the Crimean
campaign seemed a fit time to institute such an order of
merit.

Accordingly, by Royal Warrant, on the 19th January, I856,
the Victoria Cross was instituted. It was not deemed advis-
able to make the action of the Warrant retrospective, and
therefore the Crimean heroes were the first to-receive the
much-coveted decoration. .

Many will long remember the scene in June 1857 when, '
amidst immense enthusiasm, the Queen fastened with her own
hands the plain gun-metal Maltese cross, with the simple
legend " FOR VALOUR," _on the breasts of-about sixty'men, of all
ranks in both services. Forty-seven were awarded to the
army, twelve to the navy, and two to the marines, on that
occasion. There are now many hundreds of gallant men who
wear the cross, and who are entitled to put the honoured title of
V.C. after their names. Every one of these hundreds of names
has attached to it a story of stirring interest, and many volumes
of the most thrilling adventure could be filled with the records
of the deeds that have been thus commemorated. Several
books of the sort there are, and they are not only full of
interest, but are of practical use in rousing the young military
and naval readers of them to emulate the deeds there described.
We cannot here give many details, but select only a few cases, as
examples of the' kind of services which the Victoria Cross seeks
to reward and. to encourage.

Let four instancessuffice from the Crimean War, for valour,
during which, altogether from first to last, about one hundred
and fifty crosses were distributed. Two of them are given
from the records of the army, and two from those of the navy.

During the terrible .Battle of Inkerman, the result of which
depended more upon individual deeds of valour than upon
skilful generalship, the Russians at one critical period had
gained possession of what was known as the Sandbag Battery,
and were pouring from it a deadly fire. Lieutenant--Colonel Sir
Charles Russell, of the Grenadier Guards, offered to dislodge
them if any of his men would follow him. A sergeant and a
number of privates instantly sprang forward. It was a daring
venture, against terrific odds. Several of those who made the
rush at the battery were shot down, but Sir Charles Russell
held his ground, in the midst . of a confused me'lee. In a
letter to his mother after the battle the gallant colonel thus
described the critical moment :- "There were repeated cries of
' charge,' and some man near me said, ' If any officer' will lead
us we will charge.' As I was the only one just there, I could
not refuse such an appeal, so I jumped into the embrasure, and
waving my revolver said, ' Come on, my lads ; who will follow
me ? I then rushed- on." In the desperate struggle that
ensued some of the bravest men fell, and the leader was in
utmost peril. A private of the Grenadiers, named Palmer,
kept close to him, and was one of a small band who saved the
colours of the battalion from falling into the hands 'of the
. enemy, who were still in overwhelming force. The Russians
soon gave way before the desperate valour of their assailants,
and the battery was held by the victorious guards. To Sir
Charles Russell, and to Palmer, who was promoted next

morning to be corporal, the Victoria Cross was presented by
Her Majesty.

Now for the two examples of valour in the Royal Navy.
We have already referred to the gallant services of Captain
William Peel during the Crimean war (ante, p. 66), in the
story of "A Ride through the Nubian Desert." Captain Peel
was in command of H. M.S. Diamond, and a naval brigade
.from that ship formed a battery before Sebastopol, which was
named the Diamond Battery. One day some fresh ammunition ,
was brought up from the rear. The enemy Were firing briskly,-
and as the horses Were terrified and would not move, it
was necessary for some of the men to go into the open, unload
the powder-cases from the waggons, and carry them into the
battery. While thus engaged a shell came right into their
midst. " The fuse is burning!" someone cried out, as he
foresaw the awful explosion that seemed imminent. captain
Peel. saw the shell with the fuse alight, and without a moment's
hesitation leaped over- the powder-cases, and lifting the shell
threw it over the parapet. It had hardly left his hands when
it burst, but now at too great a distance to explode the powder. '
By this cool heroism, at such terrible risk, a disaster was
prevented, and the deed gained for him the Victoria Cross.

A young boatswain's mate of H.M.S. Rodney was also serving
with the naval brigade on shore. Several times he distin-
guished himself by daring deeds. It'was desirable to plant a
flag-staff on a mound behind which a troublesome Russian
battery was working. When he gained the height he became
a conspicuous mark for the Russian riflemen, but he was cool
enough to take observation of the exact position of the Russian
guns, and then kneeling down he scraped with his hands a
.hole for the signal-staff; propping it with stones and earth,
after satisfying himself that. he was in the line between
the brigade guns and the Russian battery which had to be
silenced, but of which the exact position could not be seen.
For this cool and brave act he received the Victoria Cross;
and he obtained also, for other services, French, Sardinian, and
Turkish medals. .

- Within a year and a half of the institution of the order " for
valour," the Indian Mutiny broke out, and a new field was
opened for daring and heroic deeds. -.The first exploit honoured
by the gift of the Victoria Cross was characteristic of the

gallantry and self-devotion which appeared throughout the
whole of that fearful time. After the outbreak of the mutiny

at Meerut, the native troops made for Delhi. There Were,
.unfortunately,---or rather, let us say by strange mismanagement '
----no European regiments in the city of the old Moguls, although
it was the most important magazine of military stores in
northern India, and the presence of the king was sure to
attract the mutinous troops from all directions. On the morning
of the 12th May, 1857, Lieutenant Willoughby of the Bengal
Artillery, the officer in charge, with two other lieutenants, and
the keepers of the military stores, nine in all, were at their
usual duties, utterly unaware of what was going on in the city,
which was separated from the magazine by the river Jumna.
An English resident hastened to inform them that the native
regiments were in revolt, and that a strong force was already
Crossing the bridge to seize the magazine. The natives in the-
'place could not be depended on, and what could nine English-
men do against the hosts advancing upon them? ,They
determined to defend the post as best they could till succour
arrived from Meerut, not knowing of the events that had
happened there. If they could~ not keep the enemy at bay,
they resolved to blow up the magazine, being ready to
sacrifice their own lives rather than allow the rebels to get

possession of the arms and ammunition which they were
' coming to seize. Guns were posted within the gates, loaded
with'double charges of grape, to receive the enemy, and in
case of the entrance being forced, a train was laid from the
magazine, to be lighted as soon as.further defence seemed
hopeless. - I

At this time a summons to surrender came from the king,
and a message that the gates were to be opened, and the stores
delivered up. The summons was treated with indignant
contempt. A threat was made that the place would be carried
by'escalade, and soon the scaling-ladders appeared, and the
rebels were swarming over the walls. The native artificers
and other attendants had already thrown off their disguise,
and fraternized with the rebels. The guns were fired re--
peatedly, but it was impossible to bring fresh ammunition,
and they'were- exposed to heavy volleys of musketry from
the walls. Seeing that resistance was hopeless, the signal
was given and the train was fired. Not one of the brave
nine expected to escape with life, but Willoughby and three
others, though terribly stunned and bruised, managed to
make good their retreat from the ruins, where hundreds of"Lumxu z'r or Inn CANIHHRK ulna. [nap 305.
the mutineers perished. 'Willoughby got into the open country,
but was murdered by a band of armed villagers in attempting
to reach Meerut; Forest, Rayner, and Buckley survived to
receive promotion, and to wear the Victoria Cross, the first
who got it in the Indian Mutiny. The result of the explosion
was not so important in its material consequences, for there
were still large amounts of military stores undamaged, but the
moral effect of the heroic design was immense. _

"From one end of India to another," says Kaye, in his
" History of the Sepoy War," " it filled men with enthusiastic
admiration; and when news reached England that a young
artillery officer named Willoughby had blown up the Delhi
magazine, there was a burst of applause that came from the
deep heart of the nation. It was the first of many-intrepid
acts which have made us proud of our countrymen in India,
but its brilliancy has never been eclipsed. Sad to think that I
Willoughby did not live to wear the Victoria Cross!"

During the siege of Delhi there were several memorable
incidents which gained the merited reward of valour, and
none more conspicuously than when Major Tombs, every
inch a hero, rushed to the rescue of a younger friend, Lieu-
tenant Hills, of the Horse Artillery,'equally brave, but who
was in peril, disarmed and helpless amidst murderous foes,
after maintaining an unequal struggle with several assailants.
Tombs and Hills both received the Victoria Cross.

At the critical moment of the storming of Delhi, a small
band of gallant men undertook the perilous duty of blowing
in the Cashmere gate, led by Lieutenants Home and Salkeld,
of the Bengal Engineers, in broad daylight. Under a fierce
fire from the walls, they advanced to the gate, planted and
fired the powder bags, and opened a way for the attacking
column, waiting the result with breathless anxiety. Most
of the exploding party Were killed, but of the survivors, the
two Lieutenants, Sergeant Smith of the same corps, and
Bugler Hawthorn of the 52nd Regiment, 'received the Victoria
Cross, the honour of which Home and Salkeld lived onlya

2deg
short time to enjoy. But the fame of their exploit remained to
rouse others to heroic efforts, 1n other posts of danger during
the rebellion.

Nor was it only by soldiers that the Victoria Cross was
gained during the Sepoy rebellion. Not'a few civilians received
it for heroic deeds; and several medical officers, though
reckoned as "non-combatants," were as brave in action as
they were devoted to their professional .duties. Some of
the most distinguished deeds were done by civilians. Mr.
Ross Lewis Mangles, assistant magistrate at Patna, and Mr.
,Fraser McDonell, magistrate of Chuprah, may be named as
examples, and it has been remarked, that "the gallant deed
of Mangles solved thequestion as to whether civilians could
share with their military brethren the honour of the Victoria
Cross." The occasion was this. Three Sepoy regiments had
mutinied at Dinapoor, and 'after the usual scenes of violence,
they hastened towards Arrah, a distance of about twenty-four
_miles, expecting to surprise the Europeans there. There
Were only fifteen of them, with a few native Christians, and
fifty Sikhs at the station. Mr. Herwald Wake, the magistrate,
assisted by Mr. Vicars Bc"le, an engineer of the railway,
had just time to make a roughly-fortified post of a two-storied
house, about fifty feet square. Here for a Week the little
garrison kept at bay some thousands of infuriated rebels,
who swarmed around them, thirsty for blood and for plunder.
A relieving force was sent by the civil magistrate of Patna,
within whose district Arrah lay; There were nearly five
hundred in all, including seventy Sikhs. Two ' civilians,
.. Mangles and McDonell, volunteered to accompany the force.

It was a disastrous expedition. Arriving near Arrah in the
night, suddenly a terrible fire was opened upon them from an
.ambuscade in a dense grove of mangoes. The assailants could
not be seen, and the fire could be met only by random
shots, by which friends were as likely to be hit as foes.
'Captain Dunbar, of the roth Foot, the leader of the force,
was killed by the first volley and during the hours of darkness
the men were continually being shot down. When daylight
broke, it was apparent to the survivors that their only chance
of escape was to return to the river, which they had crossed
in their evening advance; The Sepoys crowded after them,
shooting many down as they retreated. Happily the boats
were in .the place where they had been left, but it was With
the utmost difficulty they could get away from the crowd
of fierce pursuers. Less than two hundred of the whole
reached the shore, and of these only about fifty were un-
wounded. Some gallant deeds were witnessed during the '
hasty retreat. Lieutenant Ingleby, who led the retiring force,
kept the men in heart by his cool and resolute bearing, and
was the last ,to leave the shore. A bullet struck him just
as he was stepping into a boat, and his body fell into the
stream. Ensign Erskine, of the 10th Foot, had been struck
down a little before, and was at the mercy of . the rebels, when
Private Dempsey rushed back to his aid, and. bore him in
his'arms towards the river--an act of devotion for'which,
with subsequent services during the mutiny, he received the'
Victoria Cross. One of these services was carrying through
a burning village, with marksmen aiming at him, a bag of
powder with which to mine a passage in rear of the enemy's
position, a feat of extraordinary risk, which- none but a brave
and resolute man would attempt. '

Butto return to the retreat from Arrah. Mangles, although
suffering from a severe musket ball wound in the head,
several times stopped to staunch the'blood and dress. the
wounds of fallen comrades, and when a private, of the 37th
Regiment was struck down at his side, a large heavy man,\
Mangles, ithough feeble' from fasting and from'his wound,
lifted the wounded soldier, and carried him on his back'for
'six miles, over rough and swampy ground, with the Sepoys
close behind, nor left him till he deposited his self--assumed
' burden in safety in one of the boats. ~
McDonell's deed of daring was scarcely less conspicuous.
' After performing many feats of valour .during the retreat, he,
regardless of his own safety, rendered every'assistance to the
helpless and wounded, and not till he saw them all off the
bank did -he leap into the last boat, and push out into the
'stream. The- rebels had taken away the oars, and had lashed '
the rudder, and the thirty-five soldiers on the boat were drifting
to the bank, from which a smart fire was kept up. MeDonell
saw the danger, and from the bow of the boat called out to
cut the rope which lashed the rudder. Not being understood
"or obeyed, McDonell saw that not a moment was to be lost,
and he did not repeat the order. The river boats have a
covered roof, upon which he climbed, exposed to a shower
of bullets, more than one of which pierced his hat and clothes,
but he got to the rope, and cutting it, seized the tiller, and
steered the boat into the stream, thus saving the lives-of all
on board. So he shared with Mangles the honour of a civilian
bearing the badge of valour and merit. '

In Kaye's "History of the Sepoy Revolt," and in other works
relating to that time, we cannot read many pages without
' meeting with some deeds of heroic enterprise or of noble
endurance.* " I may be wrong," says Kaye," but I think this
heroism of Patience is grander far than the active gallantry
displayed in a perilous charge. It is far easier to rush at
an enemy in the fine enthusiasm of battle, than to stand stead-
fast on a given spot, for an ungiven period, waiting for the
order or the opportunity to move, whilst swept by the fire of
a hidden enemy. It is waiting that tries the man ; and. never .
were men more tried, or more patient under trial, than the
troopers of Hope Grant's brigade." This refers to_a critical
season at the siege of Delhi, when for two hours the cavalry
. brigade stood firm, exposed to' terrible fire, waiting the order
to advance. The 9th Lancers mainly thus were exposed, but

* There is a good selection of instances of courage during the Indian
Mutiny in a work compiled by Edwin Hodder, entitled " Heroes of Britain,
in Peace and War " (published by Cassell & Co.), a book which ought to be

in every school library, being full of records not only of warlike daring, but
of devotion to duty in civil life. '
with them 'were Tombs of the artillery, Probyn of the Punjab
Horse, and other heroic men, who knew'how to wait as well
as how to fight.

In the early spring of the same year that the Indian Mutiny
broke out, there was a short but sharp war with Persia. Sir
James Outram was in command, " the Bayard. of the Indian
army," whose name afterwards shone brigher than ever as
one of 'the conquerors of Lucknow, along with Havelock and
Clyde. The small British force in Persia was on one. occasion
confronted by an army of double their numbers. The enemy's
artillery was soon silenced, and their cavalry routed, but a
strong battalion of infantry formed square, and seemed resolved '
to meet the charge of the British cavalry. The battle might
have been prolonged, and many of our men sacrificed, if this
square remained firm. Their fire was very galling and de--
structive, and the square seemed impregnable. The cavalryl
charge, led by Captain 'Forbes and other brave oflicers, was
steadily awaited by the Persian infantry With bayonets fixed.
Lieutenant Moore, mounted on a splendid charger, in advance
-of all the others, rode right up to the square, and setting spurs ,
to his horse made him leap upon the bayonets. The poor
animal fell dead, and his rider must have shared the same
fate, but the confusion caused by the desperate leap left a gap
into which other men of the charging squadron rushed. The
square once broke, disorder began to appear, and there was a
confused mele'e. Lieutenant Malcolmson saw his friend Moore
on the ground, alive but with his s'word broken, and in deadly
peril. Cutting his way to the place he told Moore to grasp his
stirrup, and'wheeling round brought his friend safely out of the
surging crowd. By the good fortune which often faVours the .

brave, neither Moore nor his rescuer Malcolmson received the. '

slightest wound, and both received the Victoria Cross for their
gallantry on this occasion, and lived to distinguish them-
selves during the Sepoy rebellion.

We might quote many other examples of heroic conduct in
the wars in China, in Abyssinia, in New Zealand, in Afghanistan,310 Kavanagk's daring journey.

and in South. Africa, for England has almost always had some

- conflict "on . hand, even throughout what is commonly- called
" the peaceful reign of Queen Victoria." But enough has
been said to give an idea of thekind .of deeds rewarded by the '
Victoria Cross, and to incite some of our readers to refer to the
bool-cs in which the noble actions, inspired by duty, and by
patriotism, are recorded.

'KAVANAGH'S DARING JOURNEY.

N the history of the Indian Mutiny. one of the most memor-
able events was the relief of Lucknow by Sir Colin
Campbell, afterwards Lord Clyde. Next to Delhi, the city of
Lucknow was the place on the possession of which the result
of the war mainly turned. A large proportion of the Sepoy
troops belonged to this part of India, and Oude was the very
centre of the rebellion. Immense efforts were used to over-
whelm the little band of Englishmen, who against fearful odds
defended the Residency, which the brave and good Henry
Lawrence held till his death.'

.Then came the famous march of Havelock, from Allahabad
to Cawnpore, to reinforce the now few and feeble, but
dauntless defenders. The brave Outram joined the advancing
force, and when they had fought their way through the
besieging hosts, though entitled to command as the senior -
.officer, with the chivalry characteristic of him, became a
volunteer, merely in order that Havelock might have the
honour of leading the entry- of the troops.

But the relieving force soon found itself closely besieged,
and 1n need of help, although " Havelock's march " was one of
the most brilliant exploits in the annals of the British army
The city was b-eleaguered by countless foes, with every
appliance for carrying on the siege. Sorties were uselessKamhag/z's dan'ng' journey. 31 I

against the numbers by whom the place was surrounded. It
came at last to be a matter of days how long the noble little
garrison could-hold Out, for provisions and ammunition were
quickly running short.

At last the rumour reached them that Colin Campbell was
on the march to their relief. It was then that the famous
incident occurred of the poor Scotchwoman who cheered the
fainting soldiers by declaring that she heard the notes of the
bagpipes. True, the " Campbells were coming," but they were
yet too far away to make this possible, and we must take it_as-an
instance-of " second hearing," like the " second sight." of which

, we read in Highland legends. But Sir Colin Campbell was
pushing forward with all possible haste, and at last a native
spy came into Lucknow, with tidings that the-Commander-in-_
chief was at Alumbagh, with five or six thousand men.

Mr. Kavanagh, an Irishman, of " the uncovenanted service,"
was among those shut up in the Residency, with his wife and

, family, throughout the siege. He was in infirm health at the
time, yet he took a gallant part in the defence, and was con-
spicuous for his deeds of daring, especially in the operations
when the approaches of the Sepoy sappers and miners had to be
resisted. He was thus engaged when he heard of the arrival of
a spy, whose name was Kunoujee Lal, and who'was going
back toAlumbagh thesame night with despatches from Sirjames
Outram to Sir Colin Campbell. Believing that his local
knowledge would be of service in guiding the relieving force
into the city, he instantly resolved to volunteer to accompany '
Kunoujee Lal to Alumbagh. He first Went to find the man,
and told him he wished to go with him in disguise. Kunoujee
Lal objected, describing the dangers of the attempt, and saying
that the chances of detection in passing through the enemy's
lines -would be doubled if two went together. Finding
Kavanagh resolved to go, he proposed that they should leave

~ the city by different roads, and meet at some distance outsideJ

Kavanagh objected to this, and left him to make preparation -

for the perilous enterprise. The result of the journey, and the
story of the daring adventure, we give in Kavanagh's own
words. ' _

"I had some days previously witnessed the preparation of
plans which were being made, bydirection of Sir James Outram,
to assist the Commander-in-chief in his march into Lucknow,
and it then occurred to me that someone with the requisite
lo'cal knowledge'ought to attempt to reach His Excellency's
camp beyond or at Alumbagh. The news of Sir Colin Camp-
bell's advance revived the idea, and I made up my mind to go
myself. I mentioned it to Colonel R. Napier, chief of Sir
James Outram's staff. He was surprised at the offer; and
seemed to regard the enterprise as fraught with too much danger
to be assented to, but he did me the favour of communicating
the offer to Sir James Outram, because he considered, he said,
that my zeal ought to be brought to his notice. Sir James did
not encourage me to undertake the journey, declaring that he
thought it so dangerous that he would not himself have asked
any ofi'icer to attempt it. I, however, spoke so confidently of
success, and treated the danger so lightly, that he at last
yielded, and did me the honour of adding that if I succeeded
in reaching the Commander-in--chief, my knowledge would be
a great help to him. _

"I secretly arranged for a disguise, so that my departure
might not be known to my wife, as she was not well enough to
bear the prospect of an eternal separation. When I left home
about seven in the evening she thOught I was going on duty
for the night in the mines, for I was working there as an
assistant field-engineer, by order of Sir James Outram.

By half-past seven o'clock my disguise was completed, and
when I entered the room of Colonel Napier no one in it recognized
me. I was dressed as a Budmash, or irregular soldier of the
city, with sword and shield, native-made shoes, tight trousers, a
yellow silk koortah over a tight-fitting white muslin shirt, a
yellow sheet thrown round my shoulders, a cream-coloured
turban, and a white waist-band or kummerbund. My face and
neck and hands were coloured with lamp-black, the cork used
being dipped in oil, to cause the colour to adhere a little. I
could get nothing better. I had little confidence in the disguise
of_ my features, and Itrusted more to the darkness of the night,
but Sir James Outram and his staff seemed satisfied ; and after
being provided with a small double-barreled pistol, and a
- pair of broad pyjamahs over the tight drawers, I proceeded with
Kunoujee Lal to the right bank of the river Goomtee. Here
we undressed and quietly forded the river, which was only
four feet and.a half deep, and a hundred yards wide at this
point. My courage failed me when in the stream, and if my
guide had been within reach, Ishould perhaps have abandoned
the enterprise. But he had waded quickly, and was near the
opposite bank, where he went crouching up a ditch for three
hundred yards to a grove of low trees on the edge of a pond,
, where we stopped to dress. ' While here a man came down to
' the pond to wash, and went again without observing us.

" My confidence now returned to me, and with my tulwar
resting on my shoulders, we advanced into the huts in front,
when I accosted a matchlock man, who answered my remark
that the night was cold, 'It is very cold, in fact, it is a cold
night.' I passed him, adding that it would get colder by-and-
by. After going six or seven hundred yards farther we
reached the iron bridge over the Goomtee, where we were
stopped, and called over by a native officer, who was seated
in an upper-storeyed house, and seemed to be in command of a
cavalry picket, whose horses were near the place saddled. My
guide advanced to the light, andI stayed a little back in the
shade. After being told that we had come from .Mundeon
(our'old cantonment, then in possession of the enemy), and .,
that we were going into the city to our homes, he let us proceed.
We continued on along the left bank of the river to the stone
bridge, which is about eight or nine hundred yards from the
iron bridge, passing unnoticed through a number of Sepoys '
and matchlock men, some of whom were escorting persons of
rank in palanquins preceded by torches.

"Recrossing the Goomtee by the stone bridge, we went by314 .. Kawnag/z's dan'ng [ow/nay.

the sentry unobserved, who was closely questioning a dirtily'
dressed native, and into the Chouk, _or principal street of
Lucknow, which was not illuminated as much as it used to
be previous to the siege, nor was it so crowded. I jostled
against several armed men in the street without being spoken
to, and only met one guard of seven Sepoys talking to' some
women. When issuing from the city into the country we
were challenged by a Chowkedar, or Watchman, who, without
stopping us, merely asked us who we were. , The part of
the city traversed that night seemed to have been deserted by
at least a third of its inhabitants.

"I was in good spirits when we reached the green fields,

into which I had not been for five months. After going s'ome
mileS'we found We 'were out of the way, in the Dilkooshal
Park, which Was occupied by the enemy. My guide excused
himself by saying he had missed the way_in his anxiety to
take me from the enemy's pickets."
. [By help of one or two native cultivators watching their
crops the right direction was regained, and early in the
morning they approached Alumbagh, and an advanced picket
of Sepoys 'actually pointed out the road, Mr. Kavanagh going
forward to ask them, " asI thought it safer," he says, "to go
up to the picket than to try to pass them unobserved."] '

"Kunoujee Lal now begged that I would not press him
to take me into Alumbagh, as he did not know the way in,
and the enemy were strongly posted around the place. I was
tired and in pain from the shoes, and would have preferred
going in, but as the guide feared attempting it, I bade him
_ go on to the camp of the Commander-in-chief, which he said
was near Bunne, a village eighteen miles from Lucknow, upon
the Cawnpore road. The moon had risen by tliis time,
and we could see well ahead. By three o'clock We arrived
at a grove of mango trees situated on a plain, in which a man
was singing at the top of his voice. I thought he was a
villager, but he got alarmed on seeing us approach, and as-
tonished us, too, by calling out a guard of twenty-five Sepoys,
all of who'm asked questions. Kunoujee Lal here lost heart
for the first time, and threw away the letter entrusted to him
-by Sir. Colin Campbell. I kept mine safe in my turban.
We satisfied the guard that we were poor men travelling to
Umroola, a village two miles this side of the chief's camp, f
to inform a friend of the death of his brother by a shot from
the British entrenchment at Lucknow, and they told us the '
road. They appeared to be greatly relieved 0117 discovering
that it was not their dreaded foes that had disturbed them.
We went in the direction indicated by them, and after walking
'for half an hour, we got into a jheel or swamp, such as are
numerous and large in Oude. We had to wade through it for
two hours'up to our waists in water, and through weeds; but
before we found out we were in a jh_eel we had gone too far
to recede. I was nearly exhaust2d on getting out of the
water, having made great exertions to force a way through
the weeds, and to prevent the colour being washed off my
'face ; it was almost gone from my hands.

"I now rested fifteen minutes, despite the remonstrances
of the guide, and went forward; passing between two pickets
of the enemy, who had no sentries thrown out._ It was near
'4 A.M. when I stopped at the corner of a tope, or grove of'
trees, to sleep, for an hour, which Kunoujee Lal entreatedl
would not do; but I thought he overrated the danger, and
lying down, I told him to see if there was any one in the tape,
who could tell us where we were. He had not gone far
when I heard the English challenge, 'Who comes there?'
with a native accent. We had 'reached a British cavalry
outpost. My eyes filled with tears,-and l hastened to shake
the Sikh officer in charge of the picket heartily by the hand.
The old soldier was as pleased as myself when he heard
from whence I had come, and he was good enough to send
two of his men to conduct me to the camp of the advanced
guard. An officer of HM. 9th Lancers, who was visiting
the picket, met me on the way, and took me into his tent,
Where I got dry stockings and trousers, and, which I much
needed, a glass of brandy--a liquor I had' not tasted for '
nearly two months. .

"I thanked God for having safely brought me through this
dangerous enterprise, and I thanked Kunoujee Lal for the
courage and intelligence with which he had conducted himself
through this trying night. When we were questioned he
let me speak as little as possible. He always had a ready
ansWer; and I feel that I am indebted to him, in a great
measure, more than to myself, for my escapes It will giVe
me great satisfaction to hear that he was suitably rewarded."

Such is the substance of Mr. Kavanagh's narrative. It is
not necessary to say more than that the tidings of his arrival
soon spread through the camp ;- that Sir Colin Campbell's
rugged countenance beamed with genial sympathy as he
heard the recital of the night's adventures; that Kavanagh's
guidance was of great service in the advance towards Lucknow,
on nearing which he pressed forward to be the first to tell -
' Sir James Outram of the success of the march.

His old comrades received him with enthusiasm, and while
the echoes of the cheering still remained, he had the joy of
conducting Outram and Havelock into the presence of the
Commander-in-chiei} who had retained him near his person
throughout the advance. In the despatch to the Government
of India Sir Colin Campbell recorded in generous terms his
obligation to Mr. Kavanagh, and marked his own sense of
the enterprise by calling it "one of the most daring feats
ever attempted." The Victoria Cross, a handsome present,
and an important post, the Assistant-Commissionership of
Oude, rewarded the gallant Irishman's Services, of which.
this perilous night journey was the crowning act,
THE LASTOF THE MAMELUKES.

VERY one who has read anything about the history of
Egypt in modern times knows of the terrible massacre
of the Mamelukes by order of Mohammed or Mehemet'Ali.
'In his plans for becoming sole, despot and ruler, and sub-
sequently making himself independent of the Sultan, the
Pasha of Egypt, or Khedive as one would now call him, found
the Mamelukes standing in his way, just as Louis XIV. found
the French nobles troublesome, before he was able to become
absolute ruler, and to say " L'etat c'est Moi." '

The Mamelukes, a soldier claSS of independent chiefs, had
long ruled in Egypt, although the country had been nominally
governed by a Pasha appointed by the Sultan at Constanti~
nople. When Napoleon invaded Egypt he found the power.
of these Mamelukes paramount, and the native population
oppressed by them. He was, therefore, hailed as a deliverer.
But on the departure of the French. army of occupation, the'
Mamelukes regained their power, and 'retained it till the
pashalic of Mehemet Ali, who determined to humble _and
subdue them. After much conflict he resolved to complete
_ their overthrow by a cunningly--devised act of treachery.
Many of 'the chiefs were residing in Cairo, having been
pardoned, and appearing to be on good terms with the Pasha.

It is doubtful whether they were caballing and plotting
against Mehemet Ali, as he afterwards asserted, or whether
he only said so in order to justify his atrocious treachery,
as Louis Napoleon did in his coup d'etatr At all events, he
resolved to strike a decisive blow, and to- get rid of the
possibility of danger from these dreaded conspirators.

He consulted with the Albanian chief, Hassan Pasha, the
most confidential of all- his advisers, -nor is it known that
any other person was privy to the plot. Dissembling all
suspicion on his part, and shunning everything that might
excite it in them, he invited the most influential of all the318 - T/ze Ldst'of t/ze Mameluees.

Mamelukes, looked up to as their chief, to an audience, and,
appearing to take him into his closest confidence, consulted
him as to a holy war which he thought of proclaiming, for
the advancement of the Mohammedan faith. '

Saim Bey had always been thought a man of great shrewd-
ness and penetration, but he was fairly over-reached by
Mehemet Ali and Hassan Pasha. Flattered by the' confidence
reposed in him, he acceded to the proposal, and named all
those whom he thought most likely to be useful in the under-
taking. Mehemet Ali thus obtained the names of the leaders
of the Mamelukes, but he said he' would leave the' arrange-
ments entirely to the Bey, and concluded the interview by
inviting him to come on the following Friday to consult
further on the matter, bringing with him the whole of his
friends and adherents.

When Saim Bey retired from the audience he went to

those of the Mamelukes who were most in his confidence.
One of them, more cautions and discerning than the others,
warned the Bey of the whole scheme as savouring of treachery.
But Saim replied, "So much the worse for the Pasha if it
be so; and if there be danger, we shall not want power or
courage to meet it." The result was that the whole of the
chief men of the Mamelukes 'agreed to accompany Saim Bey
to the appointed meeting, at the palace, in the citadel of
' Cairo, mounted and armed. '
. What occurred on that terrible .day we now narrate in
the words of one of the Pasha's soldiers, who witnessed the
. whole scene, and who long afterwards published an account
'of his adventurous life. His. name was Giovanni Finati, an
Italian by birth, as many of the Franks in Egypt are to this day,
and a soldier of fortune. After leaving the Pasha's service he
became a guide to European travellers in Egypt, Arabia, and
. Syria. In this capacity he accompanied Mr. W. J. Bankes, ME,
in an Eastern tour, and Mr. Bankes thought so highly of him
that he, translated from Italian into English the book .we
have referred to, and from which we obtain what follows.T/ze Last qf tlze Mame/24km. 319

" The Mamelukes coming to the citadel," says Signor Finati,
" the Pasha was not idle in coricerting his measures for receiving
them. Before dawn, upon the Friday named, the drums were
beating throughout the city to call the troops together as for
some great parade; few,,if any of us, had received any intima-
tion of this beforehand, so that all hurried from their quarters
to know-what it meant, and were marched off to the citadel
as they arrived, and stationed there. No specific instructions

' were given, but each man was strictly charged, after his arms
had been examined, on no account to quit the post assigned
him, and to wait there for further orders. .

" The hour of audience was at hand, and a procession of about
five hundred Mameluke officers, of higher or lower degrees,
presented themselves at the gate of the citadel, and went in;
they made rather a splendid show, and were led by three of
their generals, among whom Saim Bey was conspicuous.
When entered, they proceeded directly onwards to the palace,
which occupies the highest ground ; and as soon as their
arrival there was announced to Meheinet Ali and Hassan
Pasha, who were sitting in conference together within, an imr
mediate order was given for the introduction of the three chiefs,
who were received with great afi'ability, both Pashas entering
into a good deal of conversation with them, and many compli-
ments and civilities passed. Altera time, according to Eastern
custom, coffee was brought, and last of all pipes; but at the
moment when these were presented, as if from etiquette, or to
leave his guests more at their .ease, Mehemet Ali rose and
withdrew, and sending privately for the captain of his guard,
gave orders that the gates of the citadel should be closed ;
adding, that as soon as Saim ~Bey and his two associates should
'come out for the purpose of mounting, they should be fired
upon till they dropped, and that at the same signal the troops,
posted through the'fortress, should take aim at eVery Mameluke
within their reach ; while a corresponding order was sent down
at the same time to those in the town, and to such even as
were encamped without, round the foot of the fortress, to
pursue the work of extermination on all stragglers that they
should find, so that not one of the proscribed body might
escape.

" Saim Bey, and his two brothers in command, finding that
the Pacha did not return to them, and being informed by the
attendants that he was gone into his harem (an answer that
precluded all further inquiry), judged it to be time to take
their departure. But no sooner did they make their appear-
ance without, and were mounting their horses, than they were
suddenly fired upon from every quarter, and all became at
-once a scene of confusion, and dismay, and horror, similar
volleys being directed at all the rest who were collected round
and preparing to return with them, so that the victims dropped
by hundreds. Saim himself had time to gain his saddle, and
even to penetrate to one of the gates 'of the citadel; but all to
no purpose, for he found it closed like the rest; and fell there
pierced with innumerable bullets.

"Another chief, Amim Bey, who was the brother to Elfi,
urged 'the noble animal which he rode to an act of greater
desperation, for he spurred him till he made him clamber up
the rampart, and preferring rather to be dashed to pieces than
to be slaughtered in cold blood, drove him to leap down the
precipice, a height that has been estimated at from thirty to
forty feet, or even more; yet fortune so favoured him, that,
though the horse was killed in the fall, the rider escaped.
An Albanian camp was below, and an officer's tent very near
the spot on which he alighted; instead of shunning it, he
went in, and throwing himself on the rites of hospitality,
implored that no advantage might be taken of him ; which was
not only granted, but the ofl'icer ofi'ered him protection, even
at his own peril, and kept him concealed so long as the popular
fury and the excesses of the soldiery continued.

"'Of the rest of that devoted number, thus shut up and '
surrounded, not one went out alive; and even of those who
had quietly remained in the town, but very few found means
to elude the active and greedy search. that was made after
> them, a high price being'set upon every Mameluke's head that
should be brought. All Cairo was filled with wailing and
lamentations ; and, in truth, the confusion and horrors of that
day are indescribable, for not the Mamelukes alone,'but others
also, in many instances, wholly unconnected with them, either
from mistake, or from malice, or for plunder, were indis-
criminately seized on, and put to death; so that great as the
number was that perished of that ill-fated body, yet it did not

comprehend the total of the victims. For myself, I have

reason to be thankful that though I was one of the soldiers
stationed in the citadel that morning, I shed none of the blood
of those unhappy men, having had the good fortune to be
posted at an avenue where none of them attempted to pass,
or come near me, so that my pistols and musket were never
fired."

The strange fact of the leap and escape of Amim Bey, and
of his asylum in the officer's tent, reached at last the Pasha's
ears, who sent instantly to demand him; and when the

longer to shelter or screen the fugitive, he gave him a horse,
and recommended "him to fly with all speed into Asia, where

was made, and the incident is mentioned in all guidebooks
and histories. But many have wondered, as we have done,
what became of the solitary survivor of the massacre, and
whether he or hishorse escaped from the scene of slaughter.

MAN OVERBOARD l

T is impossible to describe the intense excitement and
anxious interest on board a vessel when passengers and
crew are disturbed in their usual course by the startling cry,
"Man overboard l " The life-buoy is at once thrown over, and
the boat is lowered; while those who cannot take part in the
rescue, look eagerly over the ship's side, to catch, if possible, a
glimpse of the unfortunate, and to direct the course of those
who have gone forth upon the waters towards the place where
he rises to the surface after his first fearful plunge into the deep.
Sometimes a gallant comrade, or still more gallant and
generous ofiicer, does not wait for the boat, but risks his own
life in the attempt to .save a fellow-creature. Poor Captain
Webb, who lost his life in so tragic a way at Niagara, was first
3brought to public notice by thus leaping into the stormy
Atlantic--at night, too--'in order to rescue a man overboard!
- The records of voyages, and those of the Humane Society and
other-institutions for honouring such noble deeds, contain a
bright list of names, in every rank and of every age, from
admiral to cabin- boy, who have ventured life in this gallant
way.

Often the effort is successful and the boat returns, amidst

'hearty and thankful cheers, with both the rescuer and the
rescued. But, alas! often also'the attempt has been in vain,
and no help has reached the castaway.

A painfully interesting case of this kind has gained undying
remembrance from having suggested to Cowper his last and
one of his most touching poems, The Castaway. The in-
cident is narrated in " Anson's Voyage round the World," one
of their best seamen being washed overboard on a stormy night,
when they were unable to render any assistance. Many a poor
sailor has thus been lost, perishing where no attempt at rescue
could be made. Sometimes the cause of failure to rescue has
beenspecial, as in the following incident, which was related byMan Overeoara' ! i 3 2 3

captain of much experience, who had himself several times
saved men from drowning.

"I never lost a man in this way but once," he said, and a
dark shadow came over his brow as he recalled the scene. ' " The
sea was perfectly calm; it was daylight, and everything favour-
able, but the man never rose to the surface. The men in the
boat were quite at a loss ; in vain they watched and rowed
about the place where he had sunk ; he was never seen again.
' On returning to the ship, after the long and vain search, an
old sailor who was intimate with the lost man said, ' I know
how it was, sir; it was his belt of gold 1' The man, it seems,
was coming home from California with his earnings of many
years, and had, as he thought, secured them safely by turning
them into that which caused his death--a belt of sovereigns
worn round his body. Thus weighted, he sank as lead in the
mighty _waters. The sad incident is' told in the first volume of
the Boys' Own Paper, and the remarks made about it are _so
sensible and thoughtful that we quote them here.

"This man was doing no wrong in taking good care of his .
treasure, although he might have chosen better ways of doing so.
He may have been taking it home to make provision for his old
days, or for those near and dear to him. But when [heard the
sad incident I could not help seeing in it a lesson of life, for young
and old, and for people on land as well as those on sea. The
life of the soul may be endangered by some worldly treasure as
fatal as that sailor's belt of gold. There may be something
round the heart which keeps from Christ and His salvation.
too, may be 'a castaway,' and be lost as that sailor was--

" ' But I, beneath a rougher sea,
Am whelmed in deeper gulis than he.

I fancy it must have been good Mr." Kingston, the friend and
favourite author of boys, who wrote this in the Boys' Owh'
Paper, when I read the closing sentence " Aye, as you value
your souls' safety, boys, sufl'er not the things of this world to
cling too closely round your hearts, and overweight you so as to
drag you down to destruction."

'1)324 Man Overboard .'

Anotherfamous naval writer, Captain Basil Hall, inhis " Frag-
ments of Voyages and Travels," a book full of interesting read-
ing, has something to say on the subject of " Man overboar ."

There are few accidents, he says, more frequent at seathan
that of a man falling overboard ; and yet, strange to say, when-
ever it happens, it takes every one as completely by surpriSe
as if such a thing had never occurred before. What is still
more unaccountable, and, I'must say, altogether inexcusable,
is the fact of such an incident invariably exciting a certain -
degree of confusion, even in well-regulated ships. ,

I remember once, when cruising ofi Terceira in the Endymion,
that a man fell overboard and was drowned. After the usual
confusion, and long search in vain, the boats were hoisted up,
and the hands called to make sail. Iwas officer of the fore-'
castle, and on looking about to see if all the men were at their
stations, missed one of the foretop-men. Just at that moment
I observed someone curled up, and apparently hiding himself
under the bow of the barge, between the boat and the booms.
" Hilloa l" I said, " who are you ? What are you doing here,
you skulker? Why are you not at your station?" " I am
not skulking, sir," said the poor fellow, the furrows in whose
bronzed and weather-beaten cheek were running down with
tears. The man we had just lost had been his messmate and
friend, he told me, for ten years. I begged his pardon, in full
sincerity, for having used such harsh words to him at such a
moment, and bid him go below to his berth fOr the rest of the
day. " Never mind, sir, never mind," said the kind-hearted
seaman, " it can't be helped. You meant no harm, sir. I am
as well on deck as belOw. Bill's gone, sir, but I must do my
duty." So saying, he drew the sleeve of this jacket twice or
thrice across his eyes, and mustering his grief within his
breast, walked to his station, as if nothing had happened.

In the same ship, and nearly about the same time, the people
were bathing alongside in a calm at sea. It is customary on
such occasions to spread a studding-sail on the water, by means
of lines from the fore and main yard arms, for the use of those
who either cannot swim, or who are not expert in this art, so
very important to all seafaring people. Half-a--dozen of the
ship's boys, youngsters sent on board by that admirable and
most patriotic of naval institutions, the Marine Society, were
floundering about in the sail, and sometimes even venturing
beyond the leech rope. One of the_ least of these urchins, but
not the least courageous of their number, when taunted by his_
more skilful companions with being afraid, struck out boldly
beyond the prescribed bounds. He had not gone much further
than his own length, however, along the surface of the fathom-
less sea, when his heart failed him, poor little manl and along
with his confidence away also went his power of keeping his
head above water. 80 down he sank rapidly, to the speech-
less horror of the other boys, who, of course, could lend the
drowning child no help.

The captain of the forecastle, a tall, fine-looking, hard-a
weather fellow, was standing on the shank of the sheet anchor
with his arms across, and his well-varnished canvas hat drawn
so much over his eyes that it was difficult to tell whether he
was awake, or merely dozing in the sun, as he leaned his back
against the fore-topmast back-stay. The seaman, however, had
been attentively watching the young party all the time, and
rather fearing that mischief might ensue from their rashness,
he had grunted out a warning to them from time to time, to
which they paid no sort of attention. At last he desisted,
saying they might drown themselves if they had a mind, for
never a bit would he help them ; but _no sooner did the sinking
'figure of the adventurous little boy catch his eye, than, diver-
fashion, he joined the palms of his hands over his head,
inverted his position in one instant, and urging himself into
swifter motion by a smart push with his feet against the
anchor, shot head foremost into the water. The poor lad sank
so rapidly that he was at least a couple of fathoms under the
surface before he was arrested by the grip of the sailor, who
soon rose again, bearing the bewildered boy in. his hand, and,
calling to the other youngsters to take better care of their326 ' ' Mam Overeoam' ./

companion, chucked him into the belly of the sail 1n the midst

of the party. The fore-sheet was hanging in the calm, nearly
into the water, and by it the dripping seaman scrambled up
again to his old berth on the anchor, shook himself like a great

Newfoundland dog, and then, jumping on the deck, proceeded

~ across the forecastle to shift himself. At the top of the ladder
he was stopped by the marine officer, who had witnessed the
whole transaction, as he sat across the gangway hammocks,
watching the swimmers, and trying to get his own consent to
undergo the labour of undressing and dressing. Said _the
soldier to the sailor, "That was very well done of you, my
man, and right well deserves a glass of grog. Say so to the
gun-room steward as you pass, and tell him it is my orders to
fill you out a stiff nof--wester." The soldier's offer. was kindly
meant, but rather clumsily timed, at least so thought Jack, for
though he inclined his head in acknowledgment of the attention,
and instinctively touched his hat, when spoken to by an officer,
he made no reply, till out of the marine's hearing, when he
laughed, or- rather ,chuckled out to the people near him,
"Does the good gentleman suppose I'll take a glass of grog
for saving a boy's li-fe ? "

I could give a pretty long list of cases which I have myself
seen, or have heard others relate, where men have been
drowned while their shipmates were thus struggling on board
who should be first to save them, and instead of aiding so
laudable .a cause, were actually impeding one another by their
hurry-skurry and general ignorance of what really ought to 'be
done. I remember, for example, hearing of. a line-of--battle
ship, in the'Baltic, from which two men fell one evening, when
the ship's company were at quarters. The weather was fine,

' the water smooth, and the ship going about seven knots. The-
two lads in . question, who were furling the fore-royal I

" at. the time, lost their hold, and were jerked far in the sea.

-At least a dozen men, leaving their guns, leaped over-
board from different parts of the ship, some dressed aS'

they were, and others stripped. Of course the ship was in
a wretched state of discipline where such frantic proceedings
could take place. The confusion soon became worse con-
founded; but the ship was hove aback, and several boats
lowered down. Had it not been smooth water, daylight, and
fine weather, many of these absurd volunteers musthhave
perished. I call them absurd, because there is no sense in
'merely incurring a great hazard, without some useful purpose'
to guide the exercise of courage. Now these intrepid fellows
merely knew that a man had fallen overboard, and that was
all; so away they leaped out of the ports and .over the
hammock-nettings, without knowing whereabouts the object
_of theirquixotic heroism might be. The boats were obliged
to pick up the first that presented themselves, for they were
all in a drowning condition; but the two unhappy lads who had
been flung from aloft, being furthest ofi', went to the bottom
before their turn came. Whereas, had their undisciplined
shipmates not officiously and most improperly gone into the
water, the boats would have been at liberty to row towards
the men who had fallen accidentally, both of whom, in that
case, might to all appearance have been saved. ,

I remember a bitter kind of story which was current in the
navy when I first entered it. In those days, naval punishments
were not only more severe than they now are, but they were
inflicted with less solemnity than is at present deemed essential
to their salutary effect. In a frigate, commanded by a well-

_ known Tartar, as the martinets of the service are generally .
denominated, one of the crew, I forget from _what cause, took
it in his head to jump overboard for the purpose of drowning
himself. When he began to sink, he discovered that a salt-
water death was not quite so agreeable as he had reckoned
upon; so he sung out lustily for a rope. The ship being
brought to the wind, the man was picked up with some
difficulty. The matter was investigated instantly; and as
soon as it appeared that he had gone overboard intentionally,
the hands were turned up, the gangway rigged, and the offender
seized up. " Now," said the captain, " I shall punish you under
the sixteenth article of war, which is as follows :--' Every
, person in or belonging to the fleet, who shall desert, shall
suffer death, or such other punishment as the circumstances of
the case shall deserve.' " And then, addressing the boatswain,
he said, " You will punish this man for desertion, or, which is
exactly the same thing, for going out of the ship without leave." '
" Now, sir," resumed the captain to the trembling culprit, "if
' you have any longer a desire to go overboard, you have only
to ask the first lieutenant's leave. He has my instructions to
grant you permission; while I shall take very good care that
you are_ not again picked up." . .

I was lately told of some incidents which occurred in a
'frigate of Cape Horn, in a gale of wind, under close-reefed
main-topsail and storm-staysails. ' ~At half-past twelve at noon,
when the people were at dinner, a young lad was washed out
of the lee fore-channels. The life-buoy was immediately let
go, and the main-topsail laid to the mast. Before the jolly-
boat could be lowered down, a man jumped overboard, as he
said, "promiscuously," for he never saw the boy at all, nor
, was ever .within half a cable's length of the spot where he was
floundering about. Although the youth could not swim, he
contrived to keep his head above water till the boat reached
' him, just as he was beginning to sink. The man who had
jumped into the sea was right glad to give up his "promiscuous"
search, and to make for the life-buoy, upon which he perched
himself, and stood shivering for half an hour, like a shag on
the Mewstone, till the boat came to his relief. I

At four o'clock of the same day, a man fell from the rigging ;
the usual alarm and rush took place, the lee-quarter boat was
so crowded, that one of the topping-lifts gave way, the davit
broke, and the cutter, now suspended by one tackle, soon
knocked herself to pieces against the ship's side. Of course, the
people in her were jerked out very quickly, so that, instead of
there being only one man in the water, there were nearly a
dozen swimming about. More care was taken in hoisting out
another boat, and, strange to say, all the people were picked up,Early Exflorzhg Exfedz'tz'ons in Australia. 329

except the original unfortunateman, who, but for the accident,
which might and ought to have been prevented, would in
all probability have been saved. Neither he nor the life-
buoy, however, could be discovered before the night closed;
and it is most distressing to think, that, perhaps, he may
have succeeded in reaching this support only to perish-
before the long winter night of those dreary regions could. .

EARLY EXPLORING EXPEDITIONS IN AUSTRALIA.

H0 first discovered Australia ? By the "discovery " of

a country is meant its being made known to .the

civilized world. The ancestors of the native inhabitants were
of course the first to find the great island or continent of
Australia. Sometimes the natives of countries are called
Aborigines, as if they grew up there, or developed themselves
from some inferior animals. But no one believes this except

'advocates of the theory of evolution. The Aborigines of

Australia migrated thither from other lands or islands, and it
is much more probable that they degenerated, as they removed
further from the-ancient centres of population, than that they
were improved by the change. De-civilization is more the
natural process than civilization, as we get to the remotest
regions of the earth. The'Australian natives, when first seen

by Europeans, were found to be very low in the scale of

humanity.

The question, then, is by what European eyes was the
country first seen? It has usually been said that the Dutch
have the honour of the discovery, their commercial enterprise
having brought them much into "the regions nearest to the _-
Australasian waters, and they claim the discovery as having
been made by one of their exploring ships in 1605. That very
year a Spanish fleet, under De Quiros, sailed from Callao, andI 330 ' " Early Exploring Exfedz'tzbns

discovered some of the island groups of the Pacific. One of
'Quiros' ships, commanded by Torres, having been separated
_ from the others in a storm, passed through the channel
between New Guinea and Australia, since known as Torres'
Straits. He descried land on the south, which must have been

part of the mainland, probably Cape York, its most northerly
point. This was, however, after the date given. .for the Dutch

discovery; Within the last few years a manuscript has been
found in the Royal Library of Belg1um, containing the personal
narrative of the discovery of Australia by Manuel Godinho,
a Portuguese navigator, who touched on' the coast in .1601.
There is no reason to doubt the authenticity of this record,
so that the Portuguese may claim priority at least 111' sighting
the great island of the south.

Several navigators, chiefly Dutch, were in these seas in
subsequent years of the first half of the seventeenth century, but
,it was Tasman, who, in 1642, surpassed all his countrymen
in successful exploration. It was he who discovered New
Zealand, large tracts of the Australian coast, and what is now
known_as Tasmania, but formerly Van' Diemen's Land, so
named by'Tasman in honour of Anthony Van Diemen, then,
Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies, for the hand of
whose daughter the adventurous explorer was a suitor.
Tasman thought that this was part of the mainland, and so it
was believed to be down to the year 1798, when Bass proved
it to :be an island, by passing in an open boat through the
strait which now bears his name. On the whole, the _Dutch
- had most to do with the earliest discovery of the great south
land, and evidence of this appears in the names of places
. given by them, while the whole vast island was, till recent
times, known to geographers as New Holland.

As no settlement was made nor colony founded by any Of
these early explorers, their discoveries are now matters merely
- of historical 1nterest. They attracted little attention in Europe,
and, in fact, had almost passed into oblivion (although ,
visited occasionally, as by Captain Dampier), till the time of'in A mtralz'a. ' 331

the celebrated first voyage of Captain Cook. The chief
object of his expedition to the southern hemisphere was not
geographical exploration but astronomical observation. He
was sent to observe the transit of Venus from a' station on the .
opposite side of the globe. This was successfully accomplished .
at Otahcite, or Tahiti, June 3rd, 1769. After examining the
adjacent group, to which he gave the name of the Society
Islands, in honour of the Royal Society at whose recommenda-
tion the expedition was sent,' Cook proceeded south-westward
with a general design of exploration in the Pacific Ocean.
He reached.New Zealand on the opposite coast to that visited
by Tasman, and circumnavigating, he ascertained the division
into two main islands, separated by the channel since known as

' Cook's Straits. He then sailed for Australia, or New Holland,
exploring its east coast for more than 2,000 miles, and gave
the names since so familiar,---New South Wales, Botany Bay,
and Port Jackson, the magnificent bay or harbour on which
now stands the eastern 'colonial capital, Sydney. After a
nearly three years' voyage he anchored in the Downs

' June 12th, .1771, having sailed from England July 3rd, 1768.
The subsequent voyages of Cook had no special bearing on
Australian discovery.

The first use made by England of the discoveries by Cook
was the establishment of a convict settlement at Botany Bay,
near Port Jackson, in 1788. It was not till long afterwardsthat
Australia was thought of in connection with colonization or
emigration. Very little additional knowledge of the coast-lin'e
was obtained for fifty years after Cook's first voyage; in fact,
not till the surveying voyages of Captain King, from 1818 to
1822. The interior of the country was then, and long after,
wholly a term z'ncognila. Previously to the establishment of
the convict settlement of Botany Bay, it is probable that no
European had ever gone inland out of sight of the coast. The I
first to see the interior were escaped convicts, who long gave

' trouble to the free emigrants on their beginning to be attracted
to the settlement. _ These gradually advanced northward and
southward along the coast, and searching for suitable locations
penetrated to the base of the Blue Mountain ridge. This
lofty and rugged chain long formed the boundary of the
colony. Many efforts were made to pass this natural barrier,
' but without success, till .the year 1813, the twenty-sixth year
of the settlement, when a terrible season of drought-burnt up
the lands from the sea to the hills, and the cattle perished in
large numbers from want of pasturage. Three agriculturists--
Bloxland, Lanson, and Wentworth were their names--resolved
to join in an effort tolpenetrate the highlands, and see if there
were not open land beyond, to the westward, for their flocks
and herds. By observing and following the course of the
rivers and' streams, they succeeded in gaining a watershed, or
main mountain-ridge, and after a difficult route of above fifty
miles, they reached the lofty and rugged brow of a precipice '
from which they looked down on a vast expanse of open grassy
land spread before them, like the pampas or prairies of the
New World. A road was soon aftercommenced, by convict
labour, to these pastoral downs, in the midst of which, about
one hundred and twenty miles from Sydney, the town of
Bathurst Was founded. The road to Bathurst, crossing the
mountains by what is now called the Victoria Pass, was
opened throughout in 1832. A railway now runs from it
to Sydney. The town is -on the banks of the river, named
after Governor Macquarie. The sources' of the Lachlan
river were about the same time discovered, more to the
sciuth.
The first extensive journey into the interior was made in
1817, by Mr. Oxley, the Surveyor-General of the colony.
The primary object-was to trace the course of the Lachlan.
It was ascertained that the Lachlan and also the Macquarie
entered a flat, level country, sometimes parched with drought,
and at other seasons forming swamps or lagoons, to which
no limits were apparent. Not till several years later was
the Murrumbidgee river discovered, with the rich tracts 0f
'and watered by it, and in .1824 the larger river, the Murray, Iin Australia. I , 333

into which the waters of the Murrumbidgee flow. The
colonial government did not seem anxious to prosecute further
explanation, the reports of Mr. Oxley as to the Macquarie
river being discouraging, but two independent colonists, Messrs.
Hume and Howell, undertook a journey to the south-West,
expecting to reach the coast near Bass' Strait, where they
arrived, at Port Philip, having crossed a fine pastoral district
lying to the west of the Warragong Mountains, of which
nothing was previously known, and they discovered the>>
country through which flow the Hume, Ovens, and Goulburn
rivers. Returning by a more westerly route, they found
other rich tracts of land, and their reports were so favourable
that many settlers Went to that region, and this was the first step
towards the foundation of what is now the colony of Victoria.

The Colonial Government in 1827 sent an expedition, under
Mr. Allan Cunningham, to explore the country west of what
. is called the Dividing Range. For four hundred miles the
land was mostly dry and sterile, but he then came upon the
Darling Downs, and crossed the streams forming the head-
waters of the river Darling. In subsequent journeys he con-
nected his first route with Moreton Bay, passing by a gap
in the range which divides the coast-flowing waters from those
flowing inland. In his last expedition he ascended the
Brisbane river. ' .

The next distinguished explorer was Captain Charles Sturt,
whose narrative of "Two Expeditions into the Interior of
Southern Australia, in 1828--31," although published above
fifty years ago, in 1833, is still read with interest. He was
accompanied in his first expedition by Mr. Hume. Captain
Sturt found the Macquarie was connected in wet seasons,
through marshes, with the Darling, but that year the whole
region was a parched waste. The idea prevailing that these
streams, as well as the Lachlan and Murrumbidgee, emptied
themselves into some vast inland lake or sea, Captain Sturt's'
second journey was made to ascertain the truth of this
hypothesis. He started from Sydney in December 1829 to
explore the Murrumbidgee, and traced it to its connection
with the large rive'r named by him, the Murray. After nine
days' voyage down this river, the explorers came to the con-
fluence of another large river, which Sturt rightly conjectured '
to be the Darling. Having pursued the course of the Murray
for 500 to 600 miles from the union of the Lachlan and
Murrumbidgee, the boats entered an extensive lake, called
by him Lake Alexandrina, from the southern shore of which
he gazed upon the ocean, which was found afterwards, at
Encounter Bay, to be easily reached by a navigable channel.
This expedition caused the exploration of the country between
the Murray and the Gulf of St. Vincent, and so led to the
formation, a few years later, of the colony of South Australia.
The following years, 1832--36, witnessed most successful
expeditions conducted by Major, afterwards Sir Thomas,
Mitchell, who, among other discoveries, opened up the mag-
nificent sylvan and picturesque region, named by him Australia
Felix, destined before many years to be the busy scene of
Other settlements than those of pastoral quiet and happiness,
being " the gold region " of Victoria. A few graziers from
Van Diemen's Land and farmers from New South Wales
knew the pastoral fertility of the district, but kept their know-
ledge secret, in order to monopolize the fine sheep-walks, but
Sir Thomas Mitchell at once gave the public the benefit of
what he had seen. He was the first European who ever
stood on the summit of the famed Mount Alexander (called
Mount Bung in his map), and having ridden up he admired
the view, little dreaming of the-mineral wealth that lay con-
cealed in the neighbouring creeks and gullies. .

~ We must pass with simple mention the expeditions of
Lieutenants Grey and Lushington, the first to penetrate into
the; interior on the north-west side of the continent. They
started from Hanover _Bay February 1st, 1838, and discovered
the Glenelg River, which they followed upwards for about
seventy miles from the coast, but were compelled to return by
scarcity of provisions, and by the hostility of the natives.
Having lost their boats, they had a most perilous journey,
along an inhospitable shore, to the Swan River. In following
years Mr. Eyre made several journeys from South Australia.
In his last expedition he set out-in February 184:, with the
purpose of reaching the settled portion of Western Australia.
' This he accomplished, keeping near the sea-board all the way,
and arriving at King George's Sound on July 7th; The distance
was above one thousand miles, the latter half of the journey
being made with only one native lad, and amidst most distress-
ing privations. On one occasion they were seven days without a
drop of water. The country was found to be generally with-
out any timber; the higher ground clothed with scrub, while
.scarcely a stream or river-course occurred for six hundred
miles. '
Whilst Mr.'Eyre was exploring the western part of the
continent, which was found inhospitable, and unsuited for
colonization, Count Strzelecki, a native of Polish Prussia, in
the course of a scientific voyage round the world, came to
Sydney. He was asked by the Governor of New South Wales,
Sir George Gipps, to undertake a survey of that portion of
the colony between 30deg and 39deg south latitude, .and stretching
150 miles inland from the coast. In 1840 the Count discovered,
in the extreme south-east, a fine and well-watered region, which
he named Gipps' Land, hitherto cut off from the rest of the
continent by' the Australian Alps. But he had already made
a more startling discovery, which was kept a secret, and of
which we must give a separate notice--the gold fields of
Australia. ' '
Confining our view meanwhile to the progress of geo-
graphical exploration, the next important movement was the
attempt to cross the continent from sea to sea. Of the earliest
.expeditions for this great design we hasten to give a brief
account, and can here therefore only mention the names of
Austin, the brothers Augustus and Frank Gregory, Kennedy,
Warburton, and other explorers who, after Sturt and Mitchell,
added to our knowledge of various parts of the vast continent,3 36 Early Exploreng Exfea'ztz'om in A ustmk'a.

Some of the regions traversed by them were not favourable
for colonization, but others have been since occupied by an

industrious and rapidly increasing population. _
We conclude this article by referring to the various

divisions, political as well as geographical, of the great
continent, and the dates at which they became separate
Colonies. The first settlement, as we have seen, dates from
1788, and this was the beginning of the colony of New South
Wales. Victoria was separated from New South Wales in
1850, and Queensland in 1859, to form separate Colonies;
Western Australia was taken possessien of in 1829. South
Australia, at first a settlement of a private company, became
'a Crown colony in 1836; and to it was added, in 1863, the
northern territory, or Alexandra Land, stretching from latitude
26deg south to the north coast, and between longitudes 129deg
and 138deg. The population of this territory is as yet small, but
its area is above 523,500 square miles. The densest population
in proportion to the area is in Victoria, which has only 88,451
square miles. Colonial statistics rapidly change, and it may
be interesting to compare with more recent returns the
population in 1874. New South Wales, 584,278; Victoria,
807,756 ; South Australia, 205,082 (of which only 200 were in
the northern territory); Queensland, 160,000; Western Aus-
tralia, 26,209.' The Aborigines were then reckoned at about
50,000. In 1836 Victoria had only 244 persons; in 1851 the '
population had risen to 77,000; but in consequence of the
discovery of the gold fields it increased to 32 5,000 ; and in a '
few years had far outstripped the parent colony. It is owing
to the gold fields that the rapid increase of population is due, '
but the solid prosperity of the colonies will henceforth mainly
depend on their ordinary commercial and agricultural in-
dustries. The sudden leap into notoriety caused by the. gold
discovery, and the consequent rush of emigrants, will always
mark an epoch in Australian history, and deserve separate
notice, in these pages.
ACROSS AUSTRALIA FROM SEA T0 SEA.

N 1844 the first attempt was made to solve the geographical
mystery of the great term z'ncogm'ta of central Australia.
Captain Sturt, already so distinguished in adventurous explo-
ration, undertook, under Government auspices, to lead. an
expedition from Adelaide to the Gulf of Carpentaria on the
north. Following upwards the course of the Murray and the
Darling, he thence struck across in a north-west direction
through a country hitherto unexplored. It was a dismal
journey, mostly through barren desert, and during six months,
from November 19th, 1844, to July 2nd, 1845, not a drop of
rain fell. The nights were cold even when the days were
fearfully hot. No living creatures were Seen throughout long
tracts of stony wilderness, and even vegetation ceased. Having
advanced to within two degrees of the Tropic of Capricorn, and
no rain having fallen from July 17th to September 9th,
with another summer setting in, it was thought prudent to
retreat, and he reached Adelaide January 19th, 1846. He had
been out eighteen months, and only accomplished half the
distance. The expedition was so far useful as revealing
the true nature of large areas of the interior.

While this expedition was in progress Dr. Leichardt, a
German naturalist, undertook a_ journey from Moreton Bay,
on the east coast, to Port Essington on the north. The journey
occupied fifteen months, and resulted in the. discovery of
numerous districts, fertile and well watered, large tracts of
which have since been occupied as sheep runs. The distance
in direct line was 1,800 miles, but above 3,000 miles were
traversed before his return in November 1845.

Anxious to make further exploration of the interior Leichardt
set out in 1848 on a second expedition, from which, alas! he
never returned. Two years passed without any tidings of him.
When the third year was drawing to a close much anxiety
was felt, and in after years expeditions went in search. In3'38 Across Australm from Sea to Sea.

1852 a report was current among the natives, seven hundred
miles in the interior, that he and his party had perished.
Thirty years passed without further tidings, and then some
relics and the explorer's journal were recovered _by a settler
from the natives. The interest taken in the lost explorer was
as great in the colony as that felt in Europe on the discovery
of the Franklin relics .We do not say more now, for the
time must be near when some colonial pen will write a full
history of Australian exploration, a book which will contain
many a story of thrilling interest, and many a record of
patient endurance and heroic enterprise.

In 1858 Mr. Macdouall Stuart commenced those expeditions
which have made his name famous 1n the annals of Australian
exploration. Three journeys were made into the interiorbefore
1860, each of them with valuable results in opening up new
districts. In March of that year he started on a fourth journey,
with the purpose of crossing to the northern shore, but the
determined hostility of the natives compelled him to turn back
when within 220 miles of the western extremity of the Gulf
of Carpentaria. He found wide desert belts, but also at
intervals rich and well-watered tracts. In 1861 he set out once
more, and taking the old track he reached the furthest camping
place of 'his previous journey, and finally reached the north

coast at Van Diemen's Gulf, where he hoisted the British flag,
' nine months after leaving Adelaide. . To find a way through
the dense scrub .was the chief difficulty in the last part of the
journey, but the route once being marked out was never again
lost, and before ten years a line of telegraph from north to
south acroSs the continent brought Sydney and Melbourne
into speaking distance with the mother country.

Macdouall Stuart got all praise for his successful enterprise,
but historical justice must be done to other explorers who
were actually before him. in crossing from sea to sea. July 2 5th,
1862, was the day of Stuart's arrival on the northern shore,
but more than ayear before, on the 11th February, 1861, the
passage had been achieved by Messrs. Burke and Wills. TheyE.

DEPARTURE 0|" THE EXI'BDITION FROM MBLHOURN
perished on their return journeyto Melbourne, and so the
fact of their having' crossed from sea to sea was unknown
when Stuart claimed the honour of the first passage. Of
this expedition, with its tragic ending, let us give a' brief
account. ' . .

It was a great gala day in Melbourne, when, on the 20th of
August, 1860, an expedition, numbering fifteen persons, with
horses, camels, and an immense supply of stores, including
provisions for twelve months, left the Royal Park, amidst the
cheers and good wishes of the assembled population. The
funds for the enterprise had been contributed by.subscription,
and the whole community became interested in the project,
Which was to cross the continent to the Gulf of Carpentaria.
The command of the expedition was entrusted to Robert
O'Hara Burke, who had formerly been in the Mounted Con-
stabularyin Ireland, and Acting lnspectorofPolice in Melbourne
He was a man much respected and trusted in the colony. The
second in command was William John Wills, a medical man
by education, recently arrived as an emigrant, and now
appointed as surveyor and naturalist to the expedition.
Dr. Ludwick Becker, geologist, nine white men, and three
coloured men, one of them an Indian Sepoy, in charge of the
camels, formed the expedition. Cooper's Creek was selected
as the base of operations, where a large depot of provisions was
to be formed, as the explorers might have to fall back upon it,
if necessary. An advance party of eight pushed on from the
Darling to Cooper's Creek to establish the depbt, and here
all met, and remained from the nth of November to the
16th of December, making excursions from this centre,
and preparing for the perilous and unknown regions to the
north.

Burke knew by this time which men seemed best to accom-
pany himself and Wills on the journey, and he selected Gray
and King, leaving Brahe in charge of the depot, with strict
orders to remain there, and not quit the place, unless from
absolute necessity. Three men were thus left along with
Brahe. The others had been sent back, as not necessary for
carrying out the expedition.

Burke, with his party, then started, directing his course along
the moth degree east longitude. He had with him six camels,
a horse, and provisions for twelve weeks. He expressed his
belief that in less than that time he would be back, though
Brahe said he hardly expected so speedy a return.

The journey was less difficult than they anticipated. They
divided each day into three short stages, and occasionally
travelled by night to get more rapidly over'desert tracts.
They always carried water, that they might be free to halt at
any suitable camping ground, although no streams or springs
were near. Thus they advanced, steering"'by compass and
observation," till they came to a river, which Wills pronounced '
to be the Albert River, but which others have since thought
to be the Flinders River, and others some stream on the
other side of the Albert, more to the westward. The date is

somewhat doubtful, but it was between the 11th and 14th
of February, 1861.

They did not think it necessary to go on to the shore of
the Gulf, for they were satisfied that the river on whose banks
they were was a tidal river, and the water was decidedly salt. '
They advanced eighteen miles beyond the spot where they
came to this conclusion, but a fear had already possessed them

of the provisions failing, and they felt satisfied with what had
been done.

About the middle of February the return journey was com-
'menced. A record of their visit was left at the side of the
river, and whatever baggage could be spared, including some
~books, which had been taken to lighten the monotony of the
way. Two- thirds of the provisions having been consumed,
it was necessary to be upon short rations, eked out with an
occasional hawk or crow that came within gunshot. Rains-
had made the ground in some places heavy, and the camels,
enfeebled by over-fatigue and under-feeding, could scarcely
struggle on. Four out of the six soon succumbed, and their
flesh gave' them a 'few not very wholesome meals. Gray

' was the first of the four whose strength was exhausted, and he

died on the '8th of April. They had scarcely strength to dig

agrave-deep enough to cover him, and a sense of lassitudc

and utter helplessness would have made them lie down also

to die, were it not that the hope of reaching the depot at

Cooper's Creek sustained their feeble and staggering steps.
Another of the camels and the horse " Billy " soon after died

of starvation. The bodies were cut, and' some of the flesh

"jerked," but the dried strips had not a trace of fat, and were ,
mere fibre. . _

At length, on Sunday, April zrst, they reached Cooper's
Creek. The place was silent and deserted. Without uttering
a word, they looked round, and when the terrible truth of
their being abandoned broke upon them, Burke 'flung himself
on the- ground, completely overwhelmed with surprise and
vexation, while Wills seemed utterly paralysed and bewildered.
50 King reported, who alone survived to tell the tale of that .
terrible scene.

In a few moments all three recovered their self-command
sufficiently to examine the place and ascertain the state of
matters. On a tree near the spot where they had parted from
Brahe they descried the words cut, "DIG, zrst April." The
feelings of the men on reading this date can be imagined
The depet was deserted upon the very day of their arriving
-t'herel Yet this allowed a gleam of hope amidst their dis-
appointment, and prevented it turning into despair. It might
be possible, after a little rest, to overtake the retiring party,

. who had left so recently. Yet they had hardly strength to
dig the ground .under the marked tree. Here they found
some flour, oatmeal, dry meat, and sugar. These famished
men were thankful for this, but as King said afterwards in
his affecting narrative, " they thought they might have left

more, as they had nine months' provisions for themselves,

without stinting." On further search they found in the
cache the following letter :--
. "Dnro'r, Coornn's CREEK, April 2m.

'-' The Depot party of the'V. E. E. (Victoria Exploring
Expedition) leaves this camp to-day to return to the Darling,_
I intend to go S.E from camp to get into our old track near
Bulloo. Two of my companions and myself are quite well;
the third, Paton, has been unable to walk for the last eighteen
days, as his leg has been severely hurt when thrown by one
of the horses. No one has been up here from the Darling.
We have six camels and tWelve horses in good working

condition.
- " WILLIAM BRAKE."

This letter was enough to drive them to despair. How
could half-dying men overtake those who' were " quite well,"
and "with camels and horses in good working condition " ?

Nevertheless they took courage, and resolved to endeavour
to brace themselves for a last struggle for dear life. They
resolved to rest for a few days, for they were too weak to
proceed at once, and while thus waiting they anxiously dis-- -
cussed the future. Wills thought they should proceed by the

_old track homewards, but Burke, being satisfied that the pro-
visions could possibly not hold out, resolved to make for
Mount Hopeless, from which to the nearest settlements of the
Adelaide territory it would be a shorter journey.

It was a fatal determination, and' a second blunder was
made in leaving no manifest sign at Cooper's Creek of their'
having been there. An urgent letter, indeed, was deposited
.in the cache, but no mark such as Brahe had made on the tree.
It seems that this man, possibly from some feeling of conscious
guilt in leaving contrary to orders, had gone or sent back to '
the Creek, and seeing nothing, concluded that no one had been

- there, and hastily resumed his journey.

. Abandoning everythingbut what could be carried for sup-
porting life, Burke and his companions turned their steps

' towards Mount Hopeless. They found the water-courses dry,
and knew that to persevere in this direction would imply '
certain and speedy death. They returned with difiiculty a
distance of about forty miles, to a creek where there was
plenty of water, but by this time their provisions Were almost V
exhausted. Wills made his way to Cooper's Creek, and
deposited another note in the cache, telling " where they were
' waiting." Some natives found them at' this creek, and showed
much sympathy. They lived chiefly on nardoo, a plant from
the seeds of which they prepared a sort of meal, but this diet
was insufficient to keep up, far less to restore, their strength-
Wills kept his journal day by day, and there were found in it,
on its recovery, such entries as these: " All very weak, in
spite of having had fish-from the natives." This was written
on June 7th, and on the 15th he writes: " King out for nardoo,
Mr. Burke and I pounding and cleaning it; he finds himself
very'weak, and I am not a bit stronger."

The natives had by'this time left them, and the three
travellers were left to their own resources. The last strip of
dried camel had been consumed, and nothing remained but
the nardoo, of which Wills says: "It appears to be wholly
indigestible, and cannot possibly be sufliciently nutritious to
sustain life by itself." In a later entry he says : " Unless relief
comes I cannot possibly last more than a fortnight " On the
27th June he wrote a touching letter of farewell to his father
evidently intended to be a comfort to him after his death:
"which he felt Was imminent, for it ends with the words, "I
think to live about four Or five days; my spirits are excellent."
He had told of the successful journey, and the causes of its
calamitous ending, and said: " Our position, although more
provoking, is probably not near so disagreeable as that of poor
Harry and his companions"--alluding to his cousin who
perished with Sir John Franklin.'

As they felt that some effort must be made, Burke and
King went out in hope of meeting with some of the natives,
leaving nardoo, water, and firewood within reach of'Wills,
who was too weak to stand. They made their way to
Cooper's Creek, and there Burke lay down to die. King
stayed a few hours beside his dead chief, and then set out to
return to Wills. He found only his dead body. He must
have died soon after 'they left him. Burying the body in the
sand, the lonely man set out in quest of natives, for he saw
that they had been at the place. He soon found some who
told him by signs the " white fellow " was dead, putting their
fingers in the ground and covering them with sand, pointing
at the same time to the Creek. King made them understand
that Burke also was dead, and the poor natives were moved to'
compassion at his loneliness and misery. They took him to
their camp, gave him plenty to eat, and treated .him with the
. utmost tenderness. He stayed with them for about a month,
and - recovered a little of his strength. They managed to
_convey a wish to visit 'the place where Burke had died, and on
King conducting them there, they broke into loud wailing and
lamentation, and after sitting round in a group looking at the
dead chief for a time, they covered his resting place with a
pall of green bushes which they gathered. These are the
people whom the more savage early colonists, after provoking
their hostility by outrages, shot down and killed by poison, as
being lower than brutes, and incapable of human feeling! A,
happier tone of public opinion now prevails 1n the centres of
colonial life, and Christian influence has been brought to bear
on the few survivors, but there 15 still cause for watchfulness,
in remote places, as to the treatment of the natives, whose
lands more powerful strangers have taken possession of.
While these tragical events were occurring, great anxiety_
was felt in Melbourne as to the fate of an expedition which
had started with so much promise. A relief expedition was
at length formed, and Mr. A. W. Howitt, a son of William and
Mary_ Howitt, volunteered to be the leader. The rescuing party
reached Cooper's Creek on the 15th of September, and 1n the
neighbourhood they met with King, still dependent on the
natives, who had continued to treat him kindly, but he was in
a state of extreme weakness and despondency. The natives
hailed with delight the advent of the new-comers, evidentlyme Dzscovery of Gold in Australia. 345

because they thought that their arrival would rouse their poor
guest from his gloomy lethargy. Mr. Hewitt stayed in the
neighbourhood to gather all the relics of the ill-fated expedition,
including the journal kept by Mr. Wills almost to the last
hour of his life. The remains of the brave explorers were
buried with honour, and a record cut on trees beside the
graves, over which had been read the grand story of death
and resurrection used in the Christian burial service. Mr.

Howitt distributed useful presents among the kindly natives,

which were received by them with demonstrations of gratitude

and Joy. On the return to Melbourne, King was received with
' great honour, and rewarded for his adventurous services.
Brahe made the best excuses he could for leaving Cooper's
Creek, and his part in the affair was, happily for .him, forgotten
in the pride felt at the noble way in which -the explorers
had done their duty. A monument in Melbourne attests the-
admiration of their fellow-colonists, and their names will ever-
live in the annals of heroic adventure.

THE DISCOVERY OF. GOLD IN AUSTRALIA.

N our account of early exploring expeditions in Australia,

it has been mentioned that Count Strzelecki was engaged

in. a scientific survey of New South Wales, commencing in the
year I839. In his survey of the hill region in the east of the
colony he was struck with the resemblance of the rocks to
those in Russia, which were rich in mineral wealth. On
' making further investigation he discovered that extensive
gold-fields existed in the region. He communicated the
information to Governor Gipps, who implored him not to
divulge the secret, dreading the effect upon the population,
which was just settling down to successful industry as
colonists. The Count kept his promise to the Governor, and
his whole conduct in Australia was generous and self-denying,
' being a man of philanthropy as well as thoroughly versed in
science. He laboured for nearly five years, entirely at his.
own cost, in exploring the'region of which he had undertaken
the survey. '

How the discovery was so long delayed, after settlers began
to spread through the country, seems now strange; but so it
was, that not till May 22nd, 1851, was the first public and
official notification made. This was contained in a dispatch
from Governor Fitery to Earl Grey, then minister for the
Colonies. In this dispatch the existence of a gold-field is
announced, to the westward of the town of Bathurst; at the
same time the Governor adds his doubts as to the truth of the
report, ".being informed that the gold sent toASydney for-
inspection'seenied to be Californian gold." At the same time
.he thought the report to be of sufficient importanceto require
an efficient police to patrol the Bathurst road.

A 'c'ommunication from Mr. Stutchbury, the geological
surveyor, very soon undeceived and enlightened His
Excellency. Three days before the date of the dispatch to
Earl Grey, the sur'veyorhad written from Summerhill -Creek
a note, announcing that gold was being found in considerable
quantity, with no better instrument than a tin dish; that it
was found not only in the creek, but far above its flood-line;

. and that at least four hundred persons were at work in the
locality. The camp of the gold-finders had been named Ophir,
and- the first public record of the name was in the postscript
of Mr. Stutchbury's letter--"Excuse this being written in pencil,
as there is no ink in this city of Ophir."

It was not by Count Strzelecki alone. that the presence of
gold had been affirmed. Sir Roderick Murchison, probably
from hearing the Count's report, and himself knowing the
geology of the Ural Mountains, had come to the conclusion
that the whole Dividing Range was auriferous, and suggested to
the colonial minister the adoption of measures to attract gold- -
seekers. Sir Roderick did not take into consideration'the
effects of the announcement, which were dreaded by Governor
Gipps and Strzelecki.' The immediate effects had much
admixture of evil, for individuals at least, but the general
result to the prosperity and progress of the Australian continent
can never be estimated.

Besides this testimony from England, the Rev. Mr: Clarke,
a local geologist, had expressed his conviction that gold existed
and would be found among the Blue Mountains.

On the 3rd of April, 1851, Mr. Hargreaves, a settler who had . '

gone to California and seen the gold-fields there, was struck
with the resemblance of that country in general aspect, or
physical geography, for he does not seem to have been
a geologist. He returned to Australia with the firm belief
that he would find gold, and_ he found it.' .He wrote to-the
Government ofiering to reveal the locality for the sum ofPSsool
This ofi'er, made on April 3rd, 1851, was refused. On the
30th April he addressed another letter to the Colonial
Secretary, naming the locality, and leaving the reward for the
information to the liberal consideration of the Government.
Whether any other reward was given we do not know, but
Mr: Hargreaves, as' well as Mr. Clarke and Mr. Stutchbury,
received official and well-paid appointments at the gold-fields
of Bathurst. g .

Stranger still it seems that the discovery was so long delayed
when the following facts are considered. A shepherd had
long been in the habit of bringing lumps of gold to' Sydney, at
occasional intervals, and .disposing of them in the town, but
always refusing to tell where he got them.

In 1849, an engineer employed in some iron-works, in the
'V .neighbourhood of Berrima, produced to the 'Colonial.Secretary
a lump of gold embedded in quartz, and asked a large sum for
naming the locality, but it was refused, and Smith kept his
secret, with what result to himself 15 not known to us.

How the rumour first got wings and spread it is not easy
now to tell; but very soon after Mr. Hargreaves had set to
work the whole colony began to be in excitement. Communica'
tion was slow and difiicult in those times, and it is a fact that
onhthe very day when the Governor sent off his incredulous
report to England, there were already above a thousand people
at Summerhill Creek, busily at work on an area of not more
than a mile in extent, and finding gold in considerable ,
.quantities. More than a Week before, a man had brought to
Bathurst a lump of gold weighing thirteen ounces valued at ,1; 30,
and the whole population capable of moving rushed to the gold-
field. When the authentic news came to Sydney there was the
same excitement there, and tradesmen and labourers of every
class and sailors from the ships were soon on the road to the
.Bathurst Hills.

Three , months after the dispatch of Governor Gipps,
Lieutenant-Governor La Trobe wrote from Melbourne to ' Earl
Greythat large deposits of gold had been found in Victoria.
A proclamation having been issued, announcing arrangements

.for granting licenses similar to'what had been found necessary
to be granted in New South Wales, the population poured forth
from the city to the gold-fields, especially to Ballarat, the most
productive of 'the various localities where it had been dis-
covered. Previous to this discovery the labourers of Melbourne
had been migrating in crowds to the Bathurst diggings. This
was soon checked, and not only so, but the tide turned, and
the Port Phillip emigrants, found their way back again, and
with them a large portion of the population of New South
Wales, allured by the superior richness of the Victoria gold-
fields, and the ease with which they are reached, from their
vicinity to the city. In a short time not fewer than 20,000
people had arrived at the Victoria mines from the neighbouring
colonies. The disorganization of society was threatened," and
ruin impended upon all the industrial pursuits of ' the colony.

. But_ things righted themselves gradually. It is not the
purpose here to narrate the history of the times subsequent
to the. first discovery of gold, but having in previous pages

.described the first discovery of gold in California (ante,

page 18), it seemed fitting to narrate the parallel event in
our own Australian colonies.
HOW CHRISTIANITY WAS INTRODUCED INTO MANGAIA. _-

N the morning of March 29th, I777,_ the natives of
Mangaia were startled by the apparition of a " mighty ~
canoe, without paddles or outrigger," but rapidly approaching
the southern coast as if possessed of life. 'By the time it
reached the lee 'of the island, numbers of armed men had made
their way to the outer edge of the reef, and gazed at this
seeming monster of the deep with admiration and terror. The
famous warrior Potai remarked, "This is unquestionably a
visitor from the spirit-world." Another chief oracularly
declared that "it was the great (god) Motoro himself"

After some natural hesitation, Mourua and his friend Makatu,
both worshippers of Motoro, launched a canoe and approached
the huge visitor that had successfully " pierced the solid blue
vault." The' gift of a string of large blue beads (afterwards
' shown about as veritable chips off the azure arch), and a few
nails (subsequently converted into brad--awls), rewarded their
daring. The boat of the Resolution rowed along the reef in.
the vain hope of finding a landing-place. Mourua without
hesitation jumped into the boat, and receiving from 'Captain
Cook a large knife, stuck it in his right 'ear,--the pocket of
those days. He was thus sketched by an artist connected
with the expedition. '

Numbers of natives now took courage, swam off to the boat,
and received gifts from the great navigator. To Kirikovi, the
then temporal lord of Mangaia, was presented an iron axe, the
first ever seen on the island. A general scrimmage now took
place; but Captain Cook, with great forbearance, after per--
mitting these unceremonious fellows to possess themselves of
all he could spare, returned to the Resolution, accompanied
only by Mourua, who deemed himself wonderfully brave in
venturing on board. This he would not have done but for the
assurances of Mai (the " Omai" of the Voyages) that he would
be perfectly safe. Much to his satisfaction, Mourua was'350 " How .Cfimn'z'am'ty was

' eventually brought back to the reef in the ship's boat. He
swam "ashore, and related to his admiring countrymen the
wonders he had seen,- whilst 'Cook sailed on to Atiu, which
lies about one hundred miles north of Mangaia. An important
step had thus been taken, in civilisation: they had become
acquainted with the existence of a race different from all that
they had hitherto seen or heard of, wiser, stronger, and more
benevolent than themselves. '

At the beginning of the present century, an English whaling
ship, name unknown, touched at Mangaia. Emboldened by
the profitable intercourse of their fathers with Captain Cook,
several canoes at once pushed off to the ship. A brisk traffic
was for some time carried on; but no native was allowed to
board the ship. A chief named Koroa had just concluded a
splendid bargain in exchanging a>> fine octopiis for a knife and
'a tenpenny nail, when a wild fellow called Tairoa paddled up "
in his canoe, and, watching his opportunity, mortally speared
a white man who was holding on to the ship's iron braces,
and amusing himself with the scene._ Highly satisfied with
his valour, Tairoa paddled back to what he considered a safe
distance, and watched the confusion on board the vessel. A
long bamboo (as it appeared to the natives) was pointed at the
aggressor, who did not dream 'of danger. An unaccountable
light and noise issued from this hitherto unknown weapon, and
Tairoa fell lifeless at the bottom of his canoe.

All now was consternation amongst the natives. N'gaunui
proposed to Koroa to rescue 7 the body of the slain ;- but
Koroa wisely refused to .interfere,_ and cursed Tairoa for

'having spoiled the traffic. Ngaunui persisted in attempting
to get the corpse, when a 'few swan shot in his shoulders
induced him to retire with all convenient speed. A boat was .
now lowered, the crew of which took possession of Tairoa's
lifeless body and his canoe. All being drawn upon deck, the
captain made haste to leave this inhospitable island.

About 1814, when Makitaka was lord of Mangaia, and a
terrible famine prevailed over the island, another Whalerintroduced into Mazzgaz'a. 3 5'1'

arrived--the third vessel they had seen. The weather was -
remarkably fine. The captain, wishing to see something of
the island, landed with a companion. The names of the two
white men who first landedon Mangaia are unknown. They
crossed the reef, and walked in quiet over part of the ground
now occupied by the mission premises. .Very unwisely one
of them displayed a fine pearl oyster shell. A rush was
madevby the natives to get possession of this wonderful
treasure. The fortunate thief was himself chased into the'
interior by scores of envious countrymen. With this magni-
ficent ornament dangling from his neck, he would be sure to
carry the palm at the festive dances. The white men, alarmed
for their own safety, fired repeatedly, though without effect,
upon the retreating natives; Recollecting. the fate of Tairoa,
the natives disappeared in the thick bush then growing to the
water's edge, whilst their white visitors hastily'took their
V departure.

The next vessel that touched at the island was a schooner,
having on board the lamented missionary Williams. This was
in 1823. Papehia, Tana, and Haavi, with the wives of the
two latter, were landed as the first evangelists of Mangaia.
But the very rough treatment they at once experienced induced
the five to swim back through the surf to the ship's.boat.
Their escape in safety was owing to Mr. Williams ordering a
charge of powder to be fired from the ship to frighten the
heathen, who were plainly intent on killing the men and
taking posseSSion of the women. All their property was
stolen. . .

In 1852 good'old Haavi revisited Mangaia; and, in an
address delivered to a most crowded congregation, he touch-
ingly contrasted the savageness and wretchedness of 182 3 with
the pleasant and Christian aspect of the villagers before him.
Many were afi'ected to tears by his remarks, for 'not a few of
their number had taken part in the attack upon these humble

servants of God.
Mr. Williams left behind him a valuable souvenir in the
.shape of a couple of pigs. The boar was named Tauiti (Little
Pet),- 'the sow Makave (Rz'nglet). They were gravely con-
ducted to the marae, or temple of the war-god, .as foreign
divinities. They were wrapped in sacred white cloth, and the
best of food set before them day by day. But the speech of '
these divinities was a great mystery. From their grunting
about the marae the Mangaians derive the proverb, "Ua aue
nga atua,"--" the gods are crying." Eventually the filthy
habits of these foreign animals made the heathen suspect that
they were no'gods after all. The finest of the first litter was
solemnly offered to .Rongo in lieu of a human victim. They
greatlyImultipli'ed. In 1852 a grand feast was held, when
upwards of a thousand hogs were killed and eaten.

After the departure of the teachers, their little property and
books were used as ornaments'for the night dances. Nobody
suspected that the printed characters had a signification, the
islanders regarding them as ingenious cloth--patterns. But
soon after dysentery -- hitherto unknown -- decimated the
population. The heathen very naturally referred this scourge

-to the anger of the visitors' God on account of the ill-usage
His followers had experienced at their hands. A vow was
registered that, should He ever deign. to send messengers again
to their shores, they should be duly protected from insult and
injury. The leaves of books, which had been worked up into
head-dresses, and strips of calico, once the garments of the'
teachers and their wives, were carefully collected, and thrown
down the deep chasms where they were accustomed to bury
their dead, hoping that the scourge would disappear with
these things.

On June 15th, 1824, their sincerity was put to the test.
Two members of the church of Tahaa--Davida and Tiere--
were landed on Mangaia by Messrs. Tyerman and Bennet
on their voyage to Sydney. With the Tahitian New Testament
wrapped up in their shirts, and secured to the top of their
heads, these intrepid men leaped into the surf, and swam
ashore in the presence of many hundreds of heathen. AS
Davida's feet touched the reef a long spear was thrust at him
by a warrior, who cxultingly shouted, "Thou shalt never
catch sharks," meaning that the new God should never win
victories on Mangaia. Providentially, the future king of the
island--then a young man--was standing close behind the
intending murderer, and at the very moment the lunge was
being made arrested the weapon.

These humble evangelists landed on the reef, and were at
once lilerally taken by the hand by Numangatini, the king,
and conducted to his own seaside mama, dedicated to Rongo, _
so as to invest their persons with a sacred character. The
crowd dared not follow. After a brief rest the king led them
to the interior, where his ordinary residence was. All this
had been pre-arranged betWeen the king and principal chiefs,
as the schooner had been recognised on the previous evening
as " God's ship." The carryir g out of their wishes was en-
trusted to the king and his warlike friend Maungaati, who
showed the strangers great kindness.

A feast was prepared for the teachers. The crowd was
surprised that the strangers should close their eyes and pray
before eating. On this well-remembered occasion the follow-
ing colloquy occurred between the heathenand their new_
teachers:

"What are you doing ? "--"Thanking God for His gifts."

" Where does your God live ?"--" In heaven." '

" What is His name '1' "--" Jehovah."

" Does your God eat food '1'."----" God is a Spirit. He is not
like us; He lives for ever. It was He that made the earth,
the sky, the sea, and all things. He made us."

A reed house was now built for the use of the teachers,
and a rude hut for worship and daily teaching. The site was
' the enclosure where human sacrifices were first exposed.

Very diligently did Davida and Tiere labour to instruct the
younger men in the mysteries of book-learning, and all who
would attend, in the first principles of Christianity. Nor Were
their efi'orts vain, for numbers came from all parts of the

33
island to hear the wonderful words that fell from the lips of '
these devoted evangelists.

At length Davida found himself strong enough to form a
Christian village near the sea, where a good site could easily
be obtained for the erection of a larger church and school-house.
This had been originally suggested by the Rev. J. Williams.
The new village was called " God's town." At that period its
rocky shore was covered with large ironwood' and other trees.
It was the custom of the early coverts, like Nathanael of old, to
retire at midday to the seclusion of these trees to pray,--'each
having his own particular tree.

Now, for the first time, husband and wife ate together at
- meals, and parents tasted food with their firstborn. The
'oppressive restriction thus broken through had prevailed

throughout the South Sea Islands, although no better reason
could be assigned for it than that "such was the will of the
gods." '

In September 182 5, Mr. Bourne, the pastor of Davida and
Tiere, visited Mangaia, and was much pleased with the striking
change so speedily brought about by the blessing of God.

Not long-afterwards--in 1826--Tiere passed away to his
rest and reward, so that Davida was left to labour alone for
some years. Tiere was a man of amiable disposition and
winning manners.

Opposite to the marae of Motoro and the altar for human
sacrifice was the idol-house, known as "The-prop-of-the-
kingdom" (Te kaz'ara). Inside,were the principal gods of
Mangaia, which, with the exception of Rongo, all consisted
of rude representations Of_ the human form carved in iron-
wood.

The entire family of gods was fed before the sun had
actually sunk beneath the horizon, as that was the signal
for them to go on' their travels all over the island. At break
of day they were said to rush back with a great noise "like
wind in a cocoa-nut grove," ashamed of daylight! Occasionally
the idols were sunned to prevent their fine wrappings from
getting mouldy. New white cloth was put on them from time
to time. .

Some time after the introduction of Christianity it happened
that one of the regal family was taken dangerously ill. Whilst
the heart was softened by affliction, the parent was struck
with the glaring absurdity of professed adherents to Christianity
keeping up this idol-shrine with its daily oven-of food. What
should be done with the idols ? It was decided by the king,
Pirama Simeona, and the other leading men of the' day, to
surrender these dangerous things to Davida. To the horror of
the heathen, but to the great joy of the Christian party, the
whole thirteen were carried in triumphal procession to the
house of Davida by the sea. The wrappings were thrown
away, and for the first time since they were carved by Rori
they were exposed to the vulgar gaze. Soon after Messrs.
Williams and Platt paid an opportune visit to the island; and '
they proceeded to Raiatea laden with these idols, which were
eventually deposited in the museum of the London Missionary
Society.

The day the idols were removed, the house in which they
had been kept was set on fire; the maraes all over the ' island
were desecrated, the little houses in which the deity' was -
supposed to be invisibly present were burnt; the great stone
idol of ango at the seaside, where human sacrifices were
offered, was smashed to atoms, and (what is much to be
regretted) the magnificent native mahogany (tamanu) trees
were set on fire, on account of their supposed connection with
idolatry. Cocoa-nuts were planted on the crest of the marble
of Motoro in commemoration of this happy event. In their
wild excitement the war-dance was actually performed, as if
they had gained an important victory!

The constellation of the Pleiades held an important place
in the heathen mythology. Its appearance on the horizon at
sunset, about the middle of December, determined the com-
mencement of the new year. When at sunset the constellation
was invisible, the second half of the year was supposed to haVe
commenced. The reappearance of the Pleiades on the horizon
at sunset was in many of the islands a season of extravagant
rejoicing, and was welcomed with frantic dances and discordant
shell- music.

In- July 1845, arrived their first resident missionary, the
Rev. G. Gill, who remained at this station until his removal
to Rarotonga in April 1857. His labours were incessant,
and were owned by the Great Master to the ingathering of
many to the fold, and in the general enlightenment of the
islanders in spiritual truth. A stone church and a substantial
school-house, erected in each of the three villages, testify to
his energy. A mission--house of a superior character was
. built by him 'at the principal village. of Oneroa. Although
many years have elapsed since his removal, he still lives in
the lovingremembrance of the people.

On his arrival it was difficult to travel from one village to
another; before he left an excellent road had been made
round the island. Several oppressive laws were cancelled by
the king and chiefs at his suggestion.

On the 15th of July, 1851, the writer left England in the
missionary bark John Williams, but did not land at Mangaia
until March ISt, 1852. Not long afterwards the character of
the people was put to a severe test by the wreck of two
vessels within a few months of each other. Most of the
property was saved for the captains. Upon the whole there
was every reason to be much pleased with the way the people
behaved.

'Of the men who welcomed the first white missionary in
1845, and myself in 1852, few survive; they were men who
knew by bitter experience the cruel bondage of heathenis'm,
and who lovingly embraced Christianity. We thank God that
these worthies died as they had lived 1n the faith of the Gospel.

Our converts do not seem to be troubled with the doubts
and fears which afiect the highly-cultured European. May

not this be owing to the childlike nature of their faith ,----just
taking God at His word ?_ ' '36,.- fl'.

Amongst the excellent men whose death-beds it has been
my privilege to visitI would refer to Rakoia, chief of Tamarua,
who died in September I865, nearly eighty years of age. He
was emphatically a good man, ready for every good word and
work. He was never absent from his place in the adult Bible-
class or in church, except when ill. During the last two years of
his life he became childish ; yet I could nearly always fix his
attention for a few minutes by referring to the interests of his
soul. The last words I heard from his lips a few days before
his death were, "I am dying; but I am in God's hands.
Jesus alone is the Way, the Truth, and the Life I "

Three months afterwards Tamatangi, chief of Ivirua, died
of inflammation of the lungs. I had ridden over twice to .
administer medicine and .to converse with him. On the first
Sabbath of December 1865, Ispent the entire day at Ivirua.
After the morning service I went to see him, and at once
perceived that the last hour was near, although he~was in
full possession of his mental faculties. 'Tamatangi might be
seventy years old, and was reclining on a mat supported by a
near relative. Like Jacob, he died in the midst of his people;
for perhaps one hundred natives were in the chamber of
death. His mind was fixed upon Jesus.' Twice we offered
prayer on behalf of the dying man; and twice we sung (first
'a version of " When I can read my title clear," and then a
version of "Rock of ages, cleft for me "). I held his hand,
uttering such words of comfort as I could think of. He
looked around upon his wife and relatives, and then fixed his
dying gaze on me. His last words were an exhortation to his
clan to cleave to the Word of God. He then said " Farewell,"
and expired. I

Mauapa died in the same year. He was the oldest man on
the island, and had been a valuable deacon for many years
In visiting this worthy old Christian, I have often come away
refreshed in spirit, beholding what Christianity can do for
one who grew up to mature age in heathen darkness. His
mind was clear to the last. He passed away without a cloud.
In October 1866, Paunui, who had been my leading deacon
at Oneroa for many years, was called away. His removal
was rather sudden. Although by no means faultless--indeed,
being possessed of great energy and decision of character, he
often occasioned me great anxiety--his death was a brilliant
sunset. One Sabbath. morning early he sent for me. I was
grieved to find him suffering greatly. Gasping for breath, he
said, "My teacher, Iam going. Do not detain me by your
kind prayers and wishes. Let me go. I want to be with
Jesus. There We will meet again." To me it seemed in-
credible that such a robust, noble frame should be so near
dissolution. I spoke of his possible recovery, and the medi-
cines Ihad in my pocket. He again said, "I know I am
dying. I wish to go' and be with Jesus. Medicines will not'
- avail. Detain me not." I inquired the ground of his hope.
He said that he was trusting in Jesus only. He then com-
mended me and the native pastors to the special care of a
chief (his relative) who was by his side. ' This he did partly
from- kind personal interest and friendship, and partly as
devolving a sacred trust derived from his cousin Parima,
the first chief who embraced the Gospel, and who thereby
was universally considered to be the special protector and
helper of the "servants of God." Other chiefs who visited
him successively received the same charge, proving- how
sacredly he regarded the trust committed to him by those who
nearly fifty years ago embraced the Christian faith.

I bless God for the many dying testimonies I have met with
among these poor natives to the pOWer of the Gospel to take
away the sting of death, and to impart in its place a bright
hope of a blissful immortality. It should be remembered
that these men were all warriors in'heathenism, ahd had
freely shed blood without compunction in those' days of dark-
ness. They grew up" in the practice of a debasing superstition,

and yet cordially embraced the teachings and moral require-
ments of the Gospel.

For the last seven years the contributions from Mangaia t0
the general funds of the London Missionary Society, after
defraying all local expenses, have exceeded PS 200, and during
the same period, .Rarotonga has contributed a much larger
sum.

The first complete version of the Bible in the dialect of the
Hervey Group was brought. by the john Williams in 1852. In

'two years every one of the five thousand copies was disposed
of. In 185 5 a new edition of an equal number was called for,
and a third editon (of five thousand), with marginal references,
is in general circulation.

A recent critic, referring to the South Sea Missions, speaks
of '_' the smallness of the results obtained from the enormous
expenditure upon Mission-work." Now what are the facts of
the case ? Sixty-five years ago the whole of the Pacific was
heathen. Now upwards of three hundred islands are Christian-
ised. When missions were commenced in the Pacific,.
commerce did not exist; The commerce of the Pacific is now
estimated at PS3,000,000. So surely does civilization follow
in the wake of Christianity. Idolatry, in the greater portion
of the Pacific, is a thing of the past. Education is advancing;
500,000 natives are under instruction; 60,000 are, we hope,
" disciples indeed." \Vherever a Christian community is
ministered to by a native pastor, he is sustained, not by
contributions drawn from Europe or America, but by the free-
will offerings of his own'people. All this'has, under God,
been done by various Protestant Missionary Societies at little
more than the total cost of the Alexandra Palace,--less than
a million sterling l I

I Seven complete translations of the Scriptures have been
made by missionaries into dialects hitherto unwritten.
Thirteen others are proceeding at the present moment. That
the message of love should thus be conveyed in twenty
barbarous dialects 15 itself a wonderful feat, whether regarded
from a literary or a religious point of view.

amongst those who within his own memory were heathen,
but nearer home, where Christianity has been professed for
' nearly eighteen centuries. None are so conscious of the
manifold defects of their converts as the missionaries them-
selves ; but they believe that they are equal to the church at
Corinth (who were honoured by an epistle from an inspired
apostle), and certainly far superior to those hordes who in the
Middle Ages cast aside their idols, and became the founders of

our modern Europe.'*

 

TWO ATTEMPTS T0 ASCEND-CHIMBORA'ZO.

' EW of the works of nature," says Mr. Prescott, in his

"History of the Conquest of Peru," " produce impres-
sions of higher sublimity than the aspect of this coast, as it
is gradually unfolded to the eye of the mariner sailing on the
distant waters of the Pacific, where mountain is seen to rise
_ above mountain, and Chimborazo, with its glorious canopy of
snow, glistening far above the clouds, crowns the whole as
with a celestial diadem."

Until comparatively recent times, the Andes were generally
supposed to include the highest mountains of the world, and
Chimborazo was regarded as the highest of the Andes. It is
now known that- there are peaks in the Andes loftier than
Chimborazo, and that there are mountains in the Himalayas
higher than any in the Andes. The present century was,
however, well advanced before these facts were discovered,
and at the time that the celebrated Alexander von Humboldt
was travelling in South America it was universally believed
that Chimborazo was the highest mountain in the world.
There is no doubt that it was this which principally
stimulated the traveller to try to reach the summit, and he
was profoundly vexed that he did not succeed.

* From "Life in the 'Southem Isles," by the Rev. W. Wyatt Gill, B.A.
' (Religious Tract Society.) -
Humboldt had been travelling three years in South America
at the time that he made his attempt to ascend Chimborazo.
He left Quito for the expedition on the 9th of june, 1802, and
on June 23rd he reached the mountain. He says, that upon
arriving at the elevation of 15,600 feet the way became
narrower and steeper. " The natives, with one exception,
refused to accompany us farther, and were deaf to entreaties
and threatenings, maintaining that they sufiered more than
we did' from the rarity of the air. We were let]: alone-- I

. Bonpland, the botanist, Carlos Montufar, a younger son of the
. Marquis de Sclvalegre, a half-cast Indian from the neighbour-
ing village of San Juan, and myself.

"By dint of great exertion and considerable patience, we
reached a greater height than we had dared to hope for, seeing
we had been almost constantly enveloped in mist. in many
places the ridge was extremely narrow. To our left was
a precipice covered with snow, the surface of which shone
like glass from the effects of frost. This thin sheet of ice was
at an inclination of about thirty degrees. On the right was
a fearful abyss, from 800 to 1,000 feet deep, from the sides of
which projected huge masses of naked rock. We leant over
rather more to this side than the other, for it seemed less to
be dreaded than the precipice on our left, where the smooth
sides afforded no opportunity of checking a fall by catching
hold of projecting pieces of rock, and where the thin crust of
'ice furnished no security against being buried in the loose
snow beneath.

" The rock became more friable, and the ascent increasingly
difficult and dangerous. At certain places, where it was very
steep, we were obliged to use both hands and feet, and the
edges of the rock were so sharp that we were painfully cut,
especially on our hands. In addition to this, I had for some
weeks been suffering from a wound in my foot. The loose
position of the stones upon the narrow ridge necessitated
extreme caution, since many masses that appeared to be
firmly attached proved to be only embedded in sand. '
"We advanced all the more slowly, as every place that
seemed insecure had first to be tested. Fortunately, the attempt
to reach the summit of Chimborazo had been reserved for our
last enterprise among the mountains of South America, so
that We had gained some experience, and knew how far we
could rely on our own powers. It is a peculiar characteristic
of all excursions on the Andes that beyond the line of
perpetual snow Europeans are aIWays left without guides
just at the point where, from their complete ignorance of the
locality, help is most needed. In everything Europeans are
left to take the lead.

"We could- no longer see the summit, even by glimpses,
' and were therefore doubly anxious to ascertain how much of
the ascent had still to be accomplished. We opened the
tube-barometer at a spot where the ridge was wide enough to
allow two persons to stand side by side in safety. We were
only at an elevation of 17,300 feet, and therefore scarcely
200 feet higher than we had attained three months previously
upon Antisana.

"After an hour's cautious climbing, the ridge of rock
became less steep, but the mist unfortunately remained as
thick as ever. 'One after another we all began to feel
indisposed, and experienced a feeling of nausea, accompanied
by giddiness, which was far more distressing than the
difficulty of breathing. Blood exuded from the lips and
gums, and the eyes became 'bloodshot. There was nothing
particularly alarming to us in these symptoms, with which we>>
had grown familiar by experience.

"The stratum of mist which had hidden every distant
object from our view began, nothwithstanding the perfect
calm, suddenly to dissipate. We recognised once more the
dome-shaped summit of Chimborazo, now in closeproximity. -
It was a grand and solemn spectacle, and the hope of attaining
the object of all our efforts animated us with renewed strength.
The ridge of rock, only here and there co'vered With a thin
~ sprinkling of snow. 'became somewhat wider; and we were
hurrying forward with assured footsteps, when our further
progress was suddenly stopped by a ravine, some four
hundred feet deep and sixtyfeet wide, which presented an
insurmountable barrier to our undertaking. We could see .
clearly that the ridge on which we stood continued in the same
direction on the' other side of the ravine, but I was
doubtful whether, after all, it really led to the summit. There
was no means of getting round the cleft. On 'Antisana, after
a night of severe frost, Bonpland had been able to travel a
considerable distance upon the frozen surface of snow, but
here the softness of the snowy mass prohibited such an .
. attempt, and the nature of the declivity rendered it equally
impossible to scale the sides. I

" It was now one o'clock in the day. We fixed up the
barometer with great care, and found We had now reached
an elevation of 19,286 English feet. ' .

"We remained but a short time in this dreary waste, for.
we were soon again enveloped in mist, which hung about
us motionless. we saw nothing more of the summit of
Chimbprazo, nor of the neighbouring. Snow Mountains. We
were isolated as in a balloon; a few rock lichens were to be
observed above the line of perpetual snow, at a height of
16,920 feet; the last green moss we noticed was growing about
2,600 feet lower. ' A butterfly was captured by M. Bonpland
at a height of I 5,000 feet, and a fly was observed 1,600 feet
higher; both had been carried up into the higher regions of
the atmosphere by the currents of air originating in the warmer
plains beneath. We did not, however, see any condors,
which are so numerous upon Antisana and Pichincha,' where,
in those vast solitudes, from being unaccustomed to the sight
of man, they are wholly devoid of fear.
' " As the weather became increasingly threatening, we
.hurried down along' the ridge of rock, and, from the insecurity
of our footing, found that greater caution even was necessary
than during the ascent. .

" When we were at a height of about 17,400 feet, we ,
encountered a violent hailstorm, which gave place to snow
twenty minutes before passing the limit of perpetual snow,
and the flakes were so'thick that the ridge was soon covered
several inches deep. The danger would indeed have been
great had the snow overtaken us at a height of 18,000 feet. At
a few minutes past two we reached the spot where we had
' left the mules." -

Humboldt was evidently very proud of this expedition,
although he completely failed to reach the summit; and to the
end of his long life he was never tiredof mentioning and of
drawing attention to it] Only a few years before his death,
after he had travelled in many countries and seen many other
mountains, he remarked to Bayard Taylor, " I still think that
Chimborazo is the grandest mountain in the world."

In 1831 an attempt to ascend Chimborazo was made by
M. Boussingault, the French Academician, who had been
residing many years in South America. He was accompanied
by an American, Colonel Hall, and says, in his published
account, that, viewed from Riobamba (that is, from the east),
the mountain exhibits two slopes of very different inclinations.
"The one facing the Arenal, the sandy plain on the south
of the mountain, is very abrupt, and there are to be seen,
coming out from under the ice, numerous masses of the rock
calledtrachyte. The other, descending towards the-- place
called Chillapullu, not far from the village of Mocha, is, on
the contrary, little inclined, but of a considerable extent.

"After having well examined the environs of the mountain,
it was by this slope that we resolved to attack it, and, on the

14th of December, 1831, we went to lodge at the farm of
Chimborazo, where we found dry straw to lie on, and some
.sheepskins to keep us from the cold. The farm stands on an
elevation of 12,350 feet, so the nights are cool there, and, as' '
-a resting-- place, it is not agreeable, because wood is scarce.
"On the 15th, at seven in the morning, We put ourselves
en route, under the guidance of an Indian from the farm. We
followed, in ascending, a rivulet enclosed betWeen two walls
of trachyte, whose waters descend from the glacier; but very
soon we quitted this fissure, in order to direct our steps
towards Mocha, going along the base of Chimborazo. We'
rose very gradually, and our mules walked with trouble and
difliculty through the de'bris of rock which has accumulated at
the foot of the mountain. The slope then became very rapid,
the ground was unstable, and. the mules stopped almost at
every step to make a long pause ; they no longer obeyed the
spur. The breathing of the animals was hurried and panting.
We were then precisely at the height of Mont Blanc, for the
barometer indicated an elevation of 15,626 feet above the level
of the sea.

" After we had covered our faces with masks of light gauze,
in order to preserve ourselves from snbw blindness, we began
to ascend a ridge which abutted on a very elevated point of
the glacier. It was midday. We went up slowly, and, as we
got farther and farther on to the snow, the difficulty of
breathing in walking became more and more felt, but we .
easily regained our strength by stopping at every eight or ten
steps, without, however, always sitting down. As we went
on we felt extreme fatigue from the want of consistency in the
snowy soil, which continually gave way under our feet, and
in which we sank sometimes up to the waist. In spite of all
our efforts we were soon convinced of the impossibility of
advancing ; in fact, a little farther on the loose snow was more
than four feet deep. We went to rest on a block of trachyte,
which resembled an island in the midst of a sea of snow. The
height noted down was 16,6;3'feet, so that, after much fatigue,
we had only reached. 997 feet higher than the place whence
we set out.

"At six o'clock we were back at the farm. The weather
had been splendid, and Chimborazo had never appeared to us
so magnificent, but, after our fruitless journey, we could not
help looking at it with a feeling of spite. We were determined
to attempt the ascent by the abrupt side--that is to say,- by
the slope, which looks towards the Arenal. We knew that it
was on this side that Humboldt had ascended this mountain,
for they had pointed out to us at Riobamba the plaCe which.
he had reached, but it was impossible for us to obtain exact
information as to the route which he had followed to get'there,
for the Indians who had accompanied that intrepid traveller
were no longer living.

"At seven o'clock the next day we took the road towards
the Arenal. The sky was remarkably clear. On the east'We
perceived the. famous volcano of Sangay, in the province of
Macas, which, nearly a century before, La Condamine had
seen in a state of permanent eruption. In proportion as we
advanced '_the land rose sensibly. In general the trachytic
plateau, which supports the isolated peaks with which the
Andes are, as it were, bristling, rises gradually to the base of
these same peaks. The numerous and deep crevasses which
furrow the plateau seem all to start from a common centre;
they become narrower as they get away from this centre.
We could only compare them to the lines on the surface of
a cracked glass. ' '

"We were at a height of 16,071 feet when we took to
journeying on foot. The ground had become altogether
' impracticable for the mules, and, besides, those animals,
whose instinct is extraordinary, tried to make us understand
the great fatigue which they felt ; their ears, usually so straight
and attentive, were quite drooping, and, during the frequent
halts which they made. for breath, they never ceased looking
towards the plain. Few riders have probably taken their
steeds to such a height, and to travel on the back of mules,
over a moving soil beyond the limits of the snow, requires
perhaps several years' experience in riding in the Andes.

"After having examined the locality in which we were, we
saw that, in order to gain a ridge which ascended towards the
summits of Chimborazo, we must first climb an excessively
steep ascent just in front of us. It was formed in great part
of blocks of rock of all sizes, disposed in slopes. Here and
there these fragments of trachyte were covered by sheets of
ice more or less extensive, and in. several points you could
clearly see that the debris of ropk lay over hardened snow.
They proceeded consequently from the recent falls which had
taken place in the upper part of the mountain. These falls
are frequent, and in the midst of the glaciers of the Cordilleras
what one has most to fear are the avalanches, in which there
are really more stones than snow. ,

"At eleven o'clock we finished crossing a very extended
sheet of ice, on which we had been obliged to cut notches in
order to make sure of our steps. This passage was not
without'danger, for a slide might have cost us our lives. We
entered, then, afresh on the debn's of trachyte, which was
firm earth to us, and from that time we were able to ascend '
more rapidly. We marched along in a file, I.first, then
Colonel Hall, and my negro last. He followed my steps
exactly,' 1n order not to endangerdhe safety of the instruments
which were entrusted to him. We kept an absolute silence
during our march, experience having taught me that nothing
exhausts so much as a sustained conversation at this height ,'
and during our halts, if we exchanged a few words it was in
a low voice.

" We had now reached the ridge at which we were'aiming.
It was not what we had thought it from a distance, for, in fact,
there was a little snow on it, and its sides were so steep that
they were very difficult to climb. We were obliged to make
almost'unheard-of efforts, and such gymnastics are painful in
these aerial regions. At last we arrived at the foot of
a perpendicular wall of trachyte, which was many hundred
feet in height. There was a feeling of discouragement when
the barometer told us that we were only at a height of 18 ,460
feet. This was little for us, for it was not even the height
to which we had attained on Cotopaxi. Besides, Humboldt
had ascended higher on Chimborazo, and we wished at
least to attain the point at which that learned traveller had
stopped."

Boussingault arrived at this point at a quarter to one, and
then became enveloped in cloud for a time. When this
disappeared they found a precipice on their right hand, but
,succeeded in forcing a passage on the left of their "per-
pendicular wall of trachyte." They then found soft and loose
snow- lying over ice, and nearly came to grief through
M. Boussingault slipping. " We were all in imminent danger.
This incident made us hesitate, but, taking new courage, we
resolved to go on," and by half-past one they got again to
their desired ridge. There they were convinced that " it was
impossible -to do more," for they were "now at the foot of
a prism of trachyte, of which the upper part, covered with
a cupola of snow, forms the summit of Chimborazo."

" The ridge at which we had arrived was only some feet in
width. On all sides we were environed with precipices, and
surrounded by the strangest sights. The deep colour of the
rock contrasted in the most striking manner with the dazzling
whiteness of the snow. Long stalagmites .of ice appeared
suspended over our heads, so that one might have thought
that a magnificent cascade had frozen there. The weather
was beautiful, some light clouds only being visible on the
west; the air was quite. calm, so that the view was very
extensive. The situation was new, and we felt a lively
satisfaction in it. We were at a height of 19,513 feet, which
is, I believe, the greatest height to -which men have ever
climbed. . '

5' After some moments' repose we found ourselves recovered
from our fatigues, and neither of us experienced those
uncomfortable sensations which most persons who have
ascended high mountains have done. _ Three-quarters of an
hour' after our arrival my pulse, and also Colonel Hall's, beat~
106 in a minute; we were thirsty, and evidently under
a slightly feverish influence, but it was not a painful state.
All sounds seemed to me, however, 'thinned in a remarkable
manner, and the voices of my companions were so much ~-
changed, that under any other circumstances it would have
been impossible to recognise them. The slight noise whichT wire to Me top qf Clzz'meomzo. 369

the blows of my hammer on the rock made also surprised us
very much."

Towards 3 an. the weather began to change, and when
they had descended about a thousand feet they got into cloud
and a hailstorm. Night surprised them before they got ofi'
the mountain, and it was 8 EM. when they arrived at the
farm. No more attempts upon Chimborazo were made by
Boussingault or his friend, who separated from each other
shortly afterwards.

Besides these attempts to ascend Chimborazo, others have
been made by Professor Wagner, Garcia Moreno, the late
President of Ecuador, Dr. Stubel, and M. Remy, but never
with success, till Mr. Edward Whymper, of Alpine celebrity,
" came, saw, and conquered," as our next article narrates.

TWICEITOI THE TOP OF CHIMBORAZO.

HE name of Edward Whymper is widely known as a
daring climber and adventurous explorer. As a moun-
taineer he has few rivals, and his book of Alpine travel con-
tains many feats as wonderful as the first ascent of the
Matterhorn. It was natural that so successful and ambitious
a climber should long to attack the lofty peaks of the Andes,
and the more so because of the recorded failures of other
explorers. Towards the 'close of 1879 he accordingly sailed
on this adventurous expedition.

It must not be supposed that for successful mountaineering
the main requisites are strength of muscle, firmness of nerve,
and other animal properties in which man is excelled by the
sheep or the chamois. These material qualities are necessary,
to some extent, but there are higher mental endowments
needed for achieving results worthy of record. Before start-
ing, there ought always to be much study and planning; and
careful preparation is as essential as readiness of resource

24
when the time of action comes. The qualities that go to make
a first-rate mountain traveller are as remarkable and as rare
as those of a general in arranging for a difficult campaign.

Mr. Whymper's experience in Switzerland, Greenland, and
othersnowy regions stood him in good stead ; and he took
with him to the New World a tried and trusty companion, well
known to readers of the "Ascent to the Matterhorn," Jean
Antoine Carrel, with his cousin Louis Carrel, also a skilful and
practised cragsman. .

The party sailed from Southampton on the 3rd of November,
in the West India mail steamer, the Dim. While the ship
was at Kingston, Jamaica, the travellers stretched their legs
by going up five thousand feet. to Newcastle, and from their
highest point saw both the northern and southern sides of the
island. After crossing the isthmus to Panama little time was
lost, for on December 15th the party was' mounting from the
low-lying land on the Pacific side of the State of Ecuador. By
this time the expedition comprised Mr. Perring, an interpreter,
and a train of mules with attendants. A few days of continuous
ascent brought them to the ridge 'of the outer range of the
Andes, which was crossed at a height of about ten thousand '
feet, and on December 18th they arrived at the village of -
Guaranda, which Mr. Whymper resolved to make his head--
quarters, hiring a house there, and beginning his observations
and plans for the ascent of Chimborazo. A prospecting
journey, with the Carrels, to the highest level of the Arena],
or' sandy plain, at the base of the mountain, confirmed his
opinion as to this being the best side for attempting the ascent.
The Carrels were sent on a second prospecting journey, to
select a suitable station for the first camping, which they
did, at a height of about 16,000 feet. All was ready on
the 23rd, but as the I'nuleteers would not be, away from
Gu'aranda on Christmas Day, the departure was delayed till
the 26th. On that day the journey commenced, the party -
consisting of Mr. Whymper, the two Carrels, Mn. Perring, two
Indians as porters, three arrieros or muleteers, with fourteen
mules. The camping-ground was reached at 5. 30 P.M., a little
below the summit of the Arena]. " It was a superb night,
with a brilliant moon," says Mr. Whymper," " and the great
cliffs of Chimborazo, with their snowy dome, 7,000 feet above
us, were indescribably grand." ,

Some. days' delay took place, partly from the exhaustion and
illness of severallof the party, the desertion of the Indian
porters, and the tidings brought up of the house at Guaranda
being broken into by robbers. While, Mr. Perring went down
with a 'letter to the authorities, asking for a guard to the
baggage, Mr. Whymper and the Carrels prepared a second
camping station, at a height of 16,600 feet above the sea, and
a third at 17,400 feet. These preparations having been made,
the mules and arrieros were sent back, and, on the arrival of
Mr. Perring with three Indians, to replace those who had
deserted, the whole of the necessaries for the final ascent
were got up to the third camp by the 2nd of January, 1880.
The result we give in Mr. Whymper's own words.

" Being now well established, and. provided with sufficient
food and firing at our high station, I considered that we might
prudently attempt to make for the summit, and on the 3rd of
January, 1880, we started, at 5.35 A.M. At that time it was
calm, and we mounted for a thousand feet without any great
' difficulty, excepting such as arose from shortness of breath.
Our course led up the ridge on which our two camps were
placed. On one side of us, and deep down below, there was a
large glacier, and on the other very extensive snow-fields.

"Soon after 7 A.M. wind began to spring up, and at 7.30
it blew so hard as to render farther progress highly dangerous.
At this time we had mounted little more than a thousand feet
above our third camp, and as it was certain that we could not

" In a. communication to the editor of the Leisure Hour, in which maga-
zine an account of the expedition was given in the number for January,
1881 In Mr. Whymper's great work on the Andes, published by John
Murray, all the d-etails of the expedition will be found, with magnificent
illustrations.
reach the summit on that day, we came down again, holding
ourselves, however, in readiness to start again on the following
morning. _

"On January 4th I started at 5.40 .A.M., with'the two
Carrels, leaving Perring in charge of the camp. It was a very
fine and nearly cloudless morning. We followed the track of
the previous day, and benefited by the steps which had then
been cut' in the snow. At first the line of ascent was on the
so'uthern'side of the mountain, but after the height of 18,500
feet had been attained, we commenced to bear round to the
West, and mounted spirally, arriving on the plateau on the
summit from a northerly direction.

The ascent was mainly over snow, and entirely so after
19, 500 feet had been passed. Up to nearly 20,000 feet it was
. in good condition, and as we sank in but slightly, we pro-
gressed at a reasonable rate until II A.M. _We had met with
no great difficulties, and up to that time <<had experienced fine
weather, with a good deal of sunshine.

" We were now 20,000 feet high, and the summit seemed
within our grasp. We could see the great plateau which
is at the top of the mountain, and the two fine snowy domes,
one on its northern and the other on its southern side. But,
alas! the sky became clouded all over, the wind rose, and
we entered upon a large tract of exceedingly soft snow,
which could not be traversed in the ordinary way, and it
was found necessary to flog every yard of it down, and then
to crawl over it on all fours. The ascent of the last thousand
feet occupied more than five hours, and it was 5 P.M. before
we reached the summit of the higher of the two domes of
Chimborazo.

" 0n the immediate summit the snow was not so extremely
soft ; it was possible to stand up upon it. The wind, however,
was furious, and the temperature fell to 21deg Fahr. We re-
mained only long enough to read the barometers, and left at
5.20 P.M. ; by great exertion succeeded in crossing the most _
difficult rocks which had to~ be passed over just as the last
gleam of daylight disappeared; but we were then benighted,
and occupied more than two hours descending the last thou-
sand feet, arriving at the camp about 9 am."

Thus was achieved the first recorded ascent of Chimborazo.
Mr. 'Whymper had been compelled to leave the summit before
taking all the observations which he had intended, and he
desired, therefore, to make a second ascent before quitting the
. mountain. One of the Carrels was so disabled by frbst-bitten
feet that the purpose had to be postponed for some months,
'while medical help was necessary. Mr. Whymper returned
' at the beginning of July, many important journeys-having
been made in the interval, including the ascent of Cotopaxi,
the great volcano of the Andes. On the 3rd'of July, after
encamping at a height of about 16,000 feet, the summit was
again reached, and more than an hour was passed on the top.
Two natives, on this occasion, accompanied him, and as there
was very general incredulity in Ecuador as to the possibility
of ascending the mountain, one of these natives, Javier Cam-
pana, of Quito, made a solemn declaration before H. B. M.
Consul at Guayaquil, as to .the highest summit of the moun-
tain being reached by himself, along with Mr. Whymper, the
two Carrels, and David Beltram, of Machachi. This signed
and attested document contains a detailed narrative of the-
incidents of the ascent : " As we approached the very highest
point, we saw that there was something strange upon it, and
when we got up we found the pole of the flag which Mr.
Whymper had put up on January 4th, 1880. - It stood above the
snow, but very iittle of the flag remained, as it had been torn
to pieces by the wind. I took a small piece of the flag to show
to my friends below, and was filled with joy at being the first
Ecuadorian to reach the summit of the great Chimborazo."

The reader of this account of the ascents of Chimborazo .
will look with kecner interest for the work in 'which Mr.
Whymper gives the personal narrative of his adventures
among the Andes.
THE WIDOW AND HER MONEY-BAGS.

A PERSONAL RECOLLEcriON BY THE LATE LORD LAWRENCE."I

T was my practice in, India, where every one who wishes
I to preserve "health either walks or rides early in the
morning, instead' of taking a mere constitutional (as it is
called), to endeavour to join that object with business, or, at
any rate, with amusement. There was always some end in
view--a .village to visit, a new road to be made, or an'old one
to be repaired, or the spot where a crime had been committed
to be examined. If I was in tents, making my annual visits
in the interior of the district, which seldom occupied less than
five months of the year, there Was plenty to engage the atten-
tion. I seldom failed to visit every village within a circle of
seven or eight miles before the camp moved on another march.
Their locality, the nature of their soil, their means of irrigation,
--a point of much importance'in the East,--the general appear-
ance of _the inhabitants, and the character they bore among
their neighbours, were all points on which I was much
interested; for all such information was of infinite value in
the performance of my daily duties.

I had in truth so much to occupy me, or, what is pretty
much the same thing, made so much occupation 'for myself,
that, though often the sole European in the district, and
literally withbut any one with whom I could exchange a
word in my native tongue, I do not think that I ever felt
listless for a day. I sometimes rode alone, but more frequently
with a single horseman, who either carried my rifle or boar
spear. Thus, if anything in the way of game turned up, I did

not lose a chance; and if a messenger was required; or any-
thing was to be done, an active fellow was always ready.
More than once I have in this way brought home a buck; and
many is the 'good run I have had with wolf, hyena, and wild
boar. It would have no doubt. enhanced the pleasure to have'
had a friend with whom to contest the spear, and to talk over
the turns and chances of the field when ended. Still, when I
look back on those days, it is surprising how much I enjoyed
them in my comparative solitude.

In these journeys my follower was instructed to ride at a
respectful distance, so that I might freely converse with any
one I might pick up by the way. One'or more of the head-
men, or some of the proprietors of the village I was visiting,
usually mounted his mare, and rode with me to the next
village; -thus acting as a guide, and at the same time beguiling
the tedium of the way, often with useful information, at any
rate, with amusing gossip.

I had one morning mounted my horse for such an expedition, '
but had not proceeded far .when I met the kotwal, or chief '
police-officer, of the neighbouring town, bustling along in quite
unwonted haste. On seeing me, after making the usual' salu-
tations, he reported that a burglary had occurred in the town
during the previousnight, and that he was anxious that I
should visit the spot myself, as neither he nor any of the
police could make anything of the case.

I at once assented, and as we rode along, I ascertained that
the party robbed was a poor widow, who, with her niece, lived
in a large and substantial, but rather dilapidated, house in the
neighbouring town. The robbery, it seemed, had created
much sensation, from the circumstance that the widow asserted
that she had lost a large sum of money, whereas she had
hitherto been deemed miserably poor. . "Some of the neigh-
bours," remarked the policeman, " deny that she has been
robbed at all, and indeed to me it appears suspicious; I
suspect there is some fareb (deceit) in the matter. Where
could such a helpless creature get so much money? It was -376 The Widow and fier Money--Bags.

but the other day that she was exempted from her quota of

the watch-tax, as mooflis (a beggar), and now she asserts that

she has lost one thousand and fifty rupees." "Well, well,"

said I, "that will do; we will hear what she has to say for

herself. Don't you pretend to make out that she was not

'_ robbed. I suppose there are marks about the house of a

forcible entry ?" "Oh yes," he replied, "I don't deny there

is a hole in the-wall by which the door has been opened.

There were two marks of footsteps about the interior of the

courtyard, but the ground was so hard we could make nothing

of it. I have, however, sent for the khojia (tracker), and if'
anything is to be disdovered, I am sure he is the man to -
' do it." .

By this time we had arrived at the house, where we found
some policemen, some of the neighbours, and the widow.
The khojia, or personage celebrated far and near for his
powers of recognising and tracing the marks of biped and
quadruped, had already examined the premises. He informed
me that the footsteps were difficult to trace, from the hardness
of the soil, as well as from the passing and repassing of the
people; but that he'had satisfied himself that there had been ~
two thieves, that the two had entered the house, but that only
one appeared to have left it, and that he had followed those
traces, through various turnings and windings, till they finally
stopped at the house of a man who was said to be the nephew
of the widow herself. He then showed me the different markS,
from the interior of the widow's house up to the very threshold
of that of the nephew. There were certainly some traces, but
so very indistinct to my eye that I could form no opinion.
The tracker, however, seemed perfectly convinced. "One
foot," he observed, "is small and delicate, which goes to the
nephew's house ,- the other, a large, broad foot, I cannot trace
beyond the courtyard." The nephew was summoned, his foot
was compared with the print, the khojia insisted that it exactly

corresponded, and it certainly answered to the description he
had previously given.Tee T/Vz'dow and. fier flimsy-Bags.~ 377

We then entered the house, and carefully examined the
premises. The thieves, it seemed, had picked a small hole
. in the side of the wall, so as to admit a man' 5 hand, and had
thus opened the outer door. It was clear that the. theft was
perpetrated by someone who was well acquainted with the
premises, for the money had been concealed in three earthen
pots, buried in the ground floor within a small recess. The
ground had been dug up in the exact spot where the pots lay,
and it must have been the work of onlya few minutes, for
they were close to the surface. It seemed that there was
some suspicion of the nephew in the mind of both the old
woman and her neighbours, for he was a man of reckless and
dissolute habits. " But, wido'w," I said, "did he know of your
treasures? Did he know of the place where you concealed
them? " " No," she replied to my query, "I can't say he did.
I never let him come into the house for many years, though
he has sometimes come as near as the door, and asked me to
make friends ,- but I was afraid of him, and never let him pass
my threshold." "Well," I remarked, "it seems a bad busi-
ness. That you have been robbed is evident, but there seems
no clue as to who did it ; and as to your loss, you must have
told a lie, for I hear it was only a few months ago that, under
the plea of destitution, you were exempted from the watch- _
tax." " My lord," replied the widow, "it is very true thatI
pleaded poverty, and poor enough I am ; nevertheless, I have
been robbed of a thousand and fifty rupees. You may believe
me or not, as you please; my history is this. Some forty
years ago, or more, my husband was a merchant, well-to-do
in this town ; but after a time his affairs fell into disorder, and
when he died his creditors seized everything but this house in
payment for his debts. When dying, he told me that certain
moneys had long been due to him in the holy city of Muttra.-
Accordingly I went there, and collected something more than
two thousand rupees, with which I returned here, and I have
lived ever since on this sum." " What!" I interrupted, "have
you lived on this money for forty years, and yet have a thou-
' sand and fifty rupees, nearly half, left? " "Yes," said she, " I
opened my treasure once a month, and took out two rupees,
which lasted me and my niece for the month." "Why," I ,
remarked, "at this rate you had enough for the next forty'
years; why could you not pay the tax ?--how much was it ?"
" Two pyce a. month," she replied, " and all widows are
exempt." "Yes," remarked a bystander, "if they are poor;
but you are as rich as Lakhsmi" (the Hindu goddess of for-
tune). "I believe that Kali has sent this misfortune on you
for your lying. Do you recollect when you were assessed at
one anna, how you wept and tore your hair, and said you
were starving ? You are a sad liar by your own account, and
are well served. I hope if you ever recover your money, the-
Sahib will make 'you pay it up with arrears." " Oh," said the
widow, clasping her hands, "restore, me my money", and I
will pay for the rest of my life." '

As I suspected, from the different circumstances which had
transpired, that the nephew was in some way connected with
the robbery, I directed his house to be searched, but nothing
which could in any way implicate him was found. Despairing,
then, of discovering the criminal, I mounted my .horse, and
after telling the police to be on the look-out, I set off towards
my tents". I had ridden some little way, conning the matter
over in my mind, when it struck me how very singular it was
that the khojia should persist in it that only one of the thieves
had left the house. As the walls were very high,' and as there
was but the one door to the courtyard, it seemed as if the thief
must still be inside. -" Pooh, pooh l " I cried, "the thing is out
of the question ; did we not search the house ? And, after all, '
what could a thief be doing there ? The khojia is trying to
mystify me." However, I was not satisfied. After riding a'
little farther, I turned round and galloped back. I said to .
the police, who had not left yet, "We must have another
sear ," and upon this my myrmidons spread themselves over
the premises. While they were searching, I began to pace
.up and down, with some little impatience, I confess, as the77w Wzdow and lzea' Money-Bags. 379

thought struck me of the bootless errand on which I had
returned.

Suddenly I heard a policeman exclaim, "I have not seen
him, but I have seen his eye," and as he spoke he pointed to
one side of the courtyard near where he stood. On examining
the spot, we discovered what appeared to be a small air-hole
to some'vaults, and from this the man persisted he had seen
an eye glisten. Turning to the widow, I demanded what
places there were underground, when she explained that there
were subterraneous vaults, which had never been .opened since
her husband's death, and which she had not thought of men-
tioning when we first searched the house. "A second case of
Guy Fawkes," thought I. "Show me the entrance. Idare-
say someone is down there; though why any one should be
such a fool as to hide there passes my understanding." The
old dame accordingly showed me a small door in a retired part V
of the courtyard, which had hitherto escaped observation. By
it we descended to some very extensive vaults, and after some
search, dragged out a man. He had not the money about his
person, but, after some little hesitation, showed us where it
was concealed, at the foot of one of the pillars. He confessed
that he belonged to a village in the vicinity, that the nephew
had induced him to join in robbing the old lady, whose trea-
sures he had for a long time suspected. It seemed that the
thief had slept part of the night in the nephew's house, and'
that they had been prevented from efl'ecting the robbery till
late in the night, from the presence of the people who were
about, and consequently the morning had broken before they
had time to divide the booty, or dispose of it in any safe place.
In the hurry and confusion it had seemed best that he should . '
hide in the vaults, where it was supposed that none would
think of looking ; for the nephew was afraid to conceal him in
his own house, or to allow him to pass out of the town with
such a large sum in silver, lest, being recognised by some of
the guards at the postern as a stranger, he should be stopped
and searched. When the nephew was confronted with his
accomplice, his efl'rontery forsook-p him, and he confessed that
he had seen the old woman smoothing the earth in the recess .
one day as he stood at the threshold; and from this circum-
stance, coupled withher always being in that part of the
house, he had suspected that she. had property concealed.

When the coin was produced, 'the woman recognised her
money-bags; and on opening and countingthe money, 'We
found the exact sum she had stated--namely, one thousand
and fifty rupees, or about one hundred and five pounds in
English money; so that this poor creature had lived on about
four shillings a month, and even supported part of that time
a littleniece! While the money was being counted, and her
receipt written out, I said, "You had much better give this
money to a banker, who will allow you seven or eight per
cent. for. it, and in whose hands it will be perfectly safe;
otherwise, now that folks know you are so rich, being a lonely,
helpless old woman, you will certainly have your throat cut."
"No, no," Cried the old harridan, as she grasped her bags in
an agony lest I should take them from her; " no, no! I will
bury it where no one will ever know." I accordingly allowed
her to go 013' with her treasures ; and out she trotted, bending
under the weight of her money-bags.

Imay have failed in giving an interest to this story, but it
certainly made a considerable impression on my mind at the
time. The avarice and parsimony of the old woman, who, '
bending under the Weight of old age, and possessedof wealth
which she could never hope to enjoy, yet grudged the payment
of two pyce a month to defend her from spoliation, if not from
being murdered; the villainy of the nephew, with his utter
- want of common sense and prudence in concealing his accom-
plice in the very premises they had just robbed; the acute-
ness and discernment of the tracker, in so ably,I may say,
M deciphering- the history of the transaction from the very faint
footmarks, altogether formed a picture which it was not un-
interesting to contemplate. Of the subsequent fate of the
widow I do not recollect anything, as I shortly afterwardsCommodore Byron z'n Patagonia. ' 381

left that part of the country; but if' she escaped being robbed,
she concealed her treasures in some out-of-the-way place,
which, when she dies, her heirs will fail to discover. In this
way, no doubt, large sums are annually lost, for although
property is remarkably safe in this country, and a very large
rate of interest always to be got, the people are very much
addicted to concealing coin and jewels, probably from habits
they acquired in former times, when seldom a year passed
that a village or even town was not laid under contribution,

or stormed and plundered by the Mahratta and Piudari
hordes.

 

COMMODORE BYRON IN PATAGONIA.

. NTIL comparatively recent times very little was known

about Patagonia, the southern region of the American
continent. Commodore Byron, in the narrative of his voyage
round the world, visited the coast in 1764, and for fifty years
afterwards his report was always given as the most authentic '
account of the country and its people. Now that we know a
great deal more about these regions, it is interesting to read
this early record of Byron's visit.

When Commodore Byron had landed his men on the coast,
he drew them up on the beach, with the officers at their, head,
giving orders that none should leave their station. " I then,"
says he, " went forward alone towards the Indians, but per-
ceiving that they retired as I advanced, I made signs that one
of them should come near. . The chief approached me ; he was of
a gigantic stature, and seemed to realize the tales of monsters
in human shape; he had the skin of' some Wild beast thrown
over his shoulders, and was painted so as to make'the most '
hideous appearance I ever beheld ; round one eye was a large
circle of white, which was surrounded by a circle of- black, and
the rest of his face was streaked with paint of" diiferent colours.
I did not measure him, but if I may judge of his height by the
proportion of his stature to my own, it COUId not be much less
than seven feet. When this frightful colossus came up, We
muttered somewhat to each other as a salutation'. I then
walked with him to his companions, among whom there were
many women. Few of the men were lessin stature than the chief.
I heard their voices at a distance; and when I came near, I
perceived a good number of old men who were chanting some
unintelligible words in the most doleful cadence I ever heard,
with an air of serious solemnity, which inclined me to think
that it was a religious ceremony. They were all painted and
clothed nearly in the same manner ; the circles round the two
eyes were in no instance of one colour, but they were not
' universally black and white, some being red and white, and
some red and black. Their teeth were as white as ivory, re-
markably even, and well set ; but, except the skins which they
wore with the hair inwards, most of them were naked, a few
only having upon their legs a kind of boot,'with a short, pointed
stick fastened to each heel, which served as a spur.

"Having looked upon these enormous goblins (some of
whom were six feet six inches high, though the greater part of
them were from five feet ten to six feet in stature) with no
small surprise, I took out a quantity of white and yellow beads,
which I "distributed among them, and which they received with
very strong expressions of pleasure : I then took out a whole
piece of green ribbon, and giving the end of it into the hands
of one of them, I made the person who sat next take hold of

, it, and so on as far as it would reach ; they all sat quietly, and
appeared to be more pleased with it than with the beads.
While the ribbon was thus extended, I took out a pair of
scissors and cut it between two of the Indians that held it,
so that I left about a yard' 1n the possession of every one, which
I afterwards tied about their heads, where they sufl'ered it to
remain without so much as touehing it while I was with them.
Their peaceable and orderly behaviour on this occasion cer-

tainly did them honour, especially as my presents could not
extend to the whole company.
" These people were not wholly strangers to European com-
modities; for upon closer attention,l perceived among them
one woman who had bracelets of brass or very pale gold upon
her arms, and some beads of blue glass strung upon two queues'
of hair, which, being parted at top, hung over each shoulder
before her. One of the men showed me the bowl of a tobacco
pipe, which was made of red earth, but I soon found that they
had no tobacco among them, and this person made me under-
stand that he wanted some; upon which I beckoned to my
people, who remained upon the beach, drawn up as I had left
them, and three or four ran forward, imagining that I wanted
them. The Indians no sooner saw them advance, than they
all rose with a great clamour, and were leaving the place, as '
I supposed, to get arms, which were probably left at a little
distance. I desired only one of my people to come and bring
with him all the tobacco he could collect from the rest. As
soon as the Indians saw this, they recovered from their-sur-
prise, and every one returned to his station, except a very old
man, who came up to me and sung a long song; but before it
was finished, Mr. Cumming brought the tobacco, and I could
not but smile at the astonishment which I saw he expressed
in his countenance, upon perceiving himself, though six feet
two inches high, become at once a pigmy among giants; for
these people may indeed be more properly called giants than
tall men. Of the few among us who are full six feet high,
scarcely any are broad and muscular in proportion to their
stature, but look rather like men of common bulk, run up
accidentally to an unusual height; and a man who should
measure only six feet two inches, and equally eitceed a stout
well-set man of the common stature in breadth and muscle,
would strike us rather as a being of gigantic race, than as an
individual accidentally anomalous; our sensations, therefore,
upon seeing five hundred people, the shortest of whom were
at least four inches taller, and bulky in proportion, may be
easily imagined '

" During our pantomimical conference, an old man' often laid
his head down upon the stones, and shutting his eyes for about
half a minute, first pointed to his mouth, and then to the hills,
meaning, as I imagined, that if I would stay with them till the
morning, they Would furnish me with provisions ; but this
offer I was obliged to decline. I observed. that they had with
them a great number of dogs, with. which} suppose they run
down the animals that serve them for food. Their horses
were not large, but nimble, and well broken. The bridle was
a leathern thong, with a small piece of wood that served for a
bit, and the saddles resemble the pads that are in'use among
the country people in England. The women rode astride, and
,both men and women without stirrups ; yet they galloped fear-
lessly over the spit upon which we landed, the stones of which
were large, loose, and slippery.

" Every one of them had a missile weapon of a singular
kind tucked into the girdle. It consisted of two round stones,
covered with leather, each Weighing about a pound, which _
were fastened to the two ends of a string about eight feet long.
This is used as a sling, one stone being kept in the hand, and

. the other whirled round the head till it is supposed to have
acquired sufficient force, and then discharged at the object.
They are so expert in the management of this double-headed
shot, that they will hit a mark not bigger than a shilling with
both the stones, at the distance of fifteen yards ; it is not their
custom', however, to strike either the guanico (an animal that
resembles the deer), or the ostrich, with them in the chase, but
they discharge them so that the cord comes against the legs .of
the ostrich, or two of the legs of the guanico, is twisted tround

. them by the force and swing of the balls, so that the animal,
being unable to run, becomes an easy prey to the hunter."

Such is Commodore Byron's account. His statement as to
the size of the Patagonians has been confirmed by subsequent
voyagers, at least in regard to some of the tribes. Lieutenant
Musters, who travelled through the country in 1869, describes
the Patagonian hunters as being "tall and of fine proportions."
It has usually been stated that the people of Tierra del Fuego,
the island to the south of Patagonia, were of' very diminutive
size (as some of them may be); but a French traveller,
M. Pertuiset, who travelled there in 1873, describes the
Indians of the interior as being " well grown and of as good
proportions as the'Patagonians," and, like them, living by fishing '
and hunting. The eastern slopes of the' mountains in_the north-

' west of Patagonia are occupied by a race less nomadic than the
Patagonians proper, possessing cattle and sheep, and cultivat-
ing the soil. They much resemble the,Araucanians, on the
corresponding opposite slope in southern Chili, a fine race,
descended apparently from ancient Indian tribes drivensouth
by the Spanish and Portuguese invaders. The area of Pata-
gonia,'including Tierra del Fuego and the islands, is almost
as large as that of- France and Spain together, but is sparsely
inhabited; The climate is, in most parts, inhospitable, with,
long, severe winters, and even in summer often cold, and
stormy. . ' . '

The Argentine Republic and Chili both claim possession of
parts of Patagonia ; and under the protection of these States
settlements have been recently formed at, various stations
near the coast--one of them a Welsh colony at the mouth of
the river Chupat. The Chilians have a penal settlement,
and a coaling station for ocean steamers near the Strait of -
Magellan, a seam of coal being worked in the neighbourhood
. by the Chilian Government. .

The condition of the Patagonian people has long excited
the _charitable attention of Christian people, and the' South
American Missionary Society--an offshoot of the .Church
Missionary Society--has stations in these regions. As long ago .
as 1830 Captain Fitzroy, a benevolent man- as well aS'distin-
guished explorer, brought some of the natives to England that
they might be instructed at his own expense. He thought well -
of the capabilities of the race. The first formal attempt to
establish a mission, under the superintendence of Captain

- Allan Gardiner, came to a sad conclusion, but. the death of
these early martyrs was not in vain, and in the reports of the

' THE TRAVELS 0F MARCO POLO.

F all travellers, ancient or modern, who have left written
records of their adventures, no name is surrounded
with more mysterious and romantic interest than that of Marco
Polo, of Venice. Some of the remote regions of Asia which
he describes, as he saw them six hundred years ago, have only
been very recently revisited by European explorers, who all
bear-testimony to the accurate observation and strict veracity
of the old Venetian traveller. For instance, he tells how he
came to a district in Central Asia " said' to be the highest in
the world,'a plain between lofty him, through which flows a
great river, issuing from a large lake; and_ this plain is the
best pasturage in the world, for a lean animal becomes fat in
ten days." Here he says " the fire does not burn so clear, nor.
with the same colour, as in other- places, nor does it cook
victuals so well "--facts which indicate the lofty elevation of
this tableland. The plain is the tableland of Pamir; the
river is the Oxus ; the lake the Sir-i-kol in which the river
has its source; and the hills are the beginning of the principal
' mountain-chains of Asia. No European in after ages knew
the place, til] at length it was reached, in February 1838,
by Lieutenant Wood of the Indian navy. After surmounting
immense difficulties, and escaping many dangers, Lieutenant
Wood stood on the tableland of Pamir, and saw the source of
the Oxus, and thus confirms the story of Marco Polo: "This '
tableland of Pamir is. about 15,000 feet high, little lower' than
- the summit of Mont Blanc.. The natives call it Bam-i-alum'ah,
or the Roof of the World; and it would. appear' to be the
highest tableland in Asia, and probably in any part of ourT/ze Travels of Marco Polo. 387

globe. Before us lay stretched a noble sheet of water, from
whose western end issued the infant river of the Oxus.
According to the Kirghis, the grass is so rich that a sorry horse
is brought into good condition' in less than twenty days. "

Here 1s a singular confirmation of Marco Polo's narrative,.
and many other of his remarkable statements have in like
manner been verified by modern travellers. His book has
recently been re-edited by Colonel Yule of the Royal Engineers,
the man of all others best qualified for such an undertaking,
and his two volumes, with their minute andlearned commen-
taries, form a mine of curious and valuable information on
Asiatic geography and history. Some of the old traveller's
reports still contain mysterious statements, but this is Colonel
Yule's judgment of the'whole narrative: " With all the in-
trinsic interest of Marco Polo's book, it may be doubted ifit
would have continued to exercise such fascination on many
minds, through successive generations, were it not for the
difficult questions which it suggests. . .It is a great book of
puizles, whilst our confidence in the man's veracity is such
that we feel certain every puzzle has a solution."

In earlier years of the thirteenth century several travellers
had penetrated to various parts of the interior of Asia, and
had brought back reports of what they SIW. One of them,
Carpini, an Italian, crossed the desert east of the Caspian on
his way to the ruler of the Mongols, and tells how he every-
where on these sandy Steppes saw heaps of bones and skulls,
marking the track of the terrible conqueror Genghis Khan.
A few years later, William de Rubruquis, a Fleming, sent by
Louis IX. of France, as envoy to the Mongol Emperor, travelled
from Constantinople to the Crimea, thence reaching the Don,
the Volga, and the Ural, returning by Astrakhan and the
Caucasus, after an absence of two years and three months.
These expeditions served to increase the curiosity in all
European lands about the East, whilst the fear entertained as
to-the movements of these restless conquerors in Central Asia
induced the Governments to'seek every information and to
send ambassadors to court the friendship of the Mongol
Potentate. It was with this purpose that Marco Polo set out
from Venice, in the year 1271, to make his way to the Court.
of Kublai Khan, the greatest of the successors of Genghis Khan.
Kublai Khan had at this time completed the conquest of the
northern part of China, having overthrown the reigning
dynasty, and established himself .at Pekin, as the capital of
his mighty empire.

It would take too long to tell 110w the young Venetian, at
first accompanying his father and uncle, but left at last to his .
own resources, after many wanderings and perils, was re-
ceived with favour at the Court of Pekin. The Emperor took.
him under his protection, made him an officer of the Imperial
household, employed him in various confidential affairs, and
appointed him governor of one of the provinces. Marco had
long adopted the dress and customs of the country, and had
taken such advantage of his opportunities that he was well
versed in the history and politics as well as the language of the
Chinese and-of their Mongol conquerors.

After many years the desire to return to his native land
grew too strong to be resisted, and as he could "not obtain per-
mission from the Emperor he quitted China by stealth, and
sailing from a port in the province of Fokien reached southern
India. At Sumatra and other islands in the Indian Archipelago
he was long'detained, but at last he made his 'way through
Persia and by the Persian' Gulf to Tre'bizond and Constanti-
nople, arriving at Venice in 1295, after an absence of about
twenty-four years. In all the places through which he passed, or
where he resided, he made careful observations, and he included
in his notes all the trustworthy information that he could gather
from others as Well as what he himself witnessed. What he tells
about China was for a long time the only source of our know?
ledge of the internal afl'airs of that empire, and his account of
the city of Pekin, written more than 'six hundred years ago,
contains much that will be recognised as applicable to our own
time, when Europeans first obtained access to the long'sec'uded
capital. One of the chaptersof his book, relating to Pekin,
will give a good idea of the style of Marco Polo.

rm: City or CAMBALUC (PEKIN).

You must know that the city of Cambaluc hath such
a multitude of houses, and such a vast population inside the
walls and outside, that it seems quite past all possibility. '
There is a suburb outside each of the gates, which are twelve
in number, and these suburbs are so great that they contain
more people than the city itself (for the suburb of one' gate
spreads in width till it meets the suburb of the next, whilst
they extend in length some three or four miles). In those '
suburbs lodge the foreign merchants and travellers, of whom,
there are always great numbers, who have come to bring
presents to the Emperor, or to sell articles at court, or
because the city affords so good a mart to attract traders.
There are in each of the suburbs, to a distance of a mile from
the city, numerous fine hostelries, for the lodgment of
merchants from different parts of the world, and a special
hostelry is assigned to each description of people, as if we
should say there is' one for the Lombards, another for the
Germans, and a third for the Frenchmen. And thus there
are as many good houses outside of the city as inside, without
counting those that belong to the great lords and barons,
which are very numerous.

You must know that it is forbidden to bury any dead body
inside the city. If the body be that of an idolater it is carried
out beyond the city and suburbs to a remote place assigned
for the purpose, to be burnt. And if it be of one belonging to
a religion the custom of which is to bury, such as the Christian,
the Saracen, or what not, it is also carried out beyond the
suburbs to a distant place assigned for the purpose. And thus
the city is preserved in a better and more healthy state.
Guards patrol the city every night in parties of thirty or
forty; looking out for any persons who may be abroad
at unseasonable hours---x'.e., after the great bell hath stricken' 390 ' 17w T raw]: of Marco Polo.

thrice. If they find any such person he is immediately taken
to prison, and examined next morning by the proper officers.
If these find him guilty of any misdemeanour they order him
a proportionate heating with the stick. Under this punish-
mentpeople sometimes die; but they adopt it in order to.
eschew bloodshed, for their Bacisis say that it is an evil'thing
to shed man's blood.' To this city also are brought articles of
greater (co'st and rarity, and'in greater abundance, of all kinds,
. than to any other city in the world. For. people of every
description, and from every region, bring things (including all
the costly wares of .India, as well as the fine and precious
goods of Carthag itself with its provinces), some for the
sovereign, some for the court, some for the city, which- is so
great, some for the crowds of barons and knights, some for the
great hosts of the Emperor, which are quartered round about,
and thus between court'and city the quantity brought in is
endless.'

"As a sample, I tell you, no day 1n the year passes that
there do not enter the city one thousand cartloads of silk
alone, from which are-made quantities of cloth of silk and
gold, and of other goods. And this is not to be wondered at ;
.~or in all the countriesrround about there is no flax, so that
everything has to be made of silk. It is true, indeed, that
in some parts of the country there is, cotton and hemp, but
not sufficient for their wants. This, hOWever, is not of much
consequenCe, because silk is so abundant and cheap, and is
a more valuable substance than either flax or cotton. Round
abbut this great city of Cambaluc there are some two hundred
other cities at various distances, from which traders come to
sell their goods' and buy others for their lords, and all find

means to make their sales and purchases, so that the traflic oi
the city is passing great."391 _

HOW BLAKE MADE VAN TROMP TAKE THE BROOM FROM
HIS TOP-MAST.

IN the middle of the sixteenth.century the Dutch Were the
acknowledged "masters of the sea." The States of H01-
land, having carried on a successful trade at home and abroad,
even in the remotest East, had reached a height of naval power,
and of wealth, which caused them to treat all other nations with
the insolence of superiority. The navy of Spain, once supreme,
had been declining ever since the defeat of " the Invincible
Armada." The English followed up" that victory by'carrying
war into the Spanish dominions in America, under such sea-
kings as Cavendish and Drake. But all this naval greatness
had departed during the inactive reign of James 1., and the
civil commotions.during the time of Charles I. and the Long

. Parliament. The .Dutch saw their opportunity, and aimed at.

the empire of the'sea. 'When war between the two Common-
wealths of England and Holland broke outin 1652, the English
were unprepared, while the Dutch had a splendid fleet, with
commanders the most renowned, whose names are still famous
in history--De Witt, De Ruyter, and Van Tromp,

Having long been making preparations the'y equipped a
powerful fleet, without any apparent need of it for purposes of.
defence. The English were naturally suspicious of their aims,
and resolved to fit out a fleet for the security of their merChant-
men and for the protection of their coasts. Robert Blake, who
had already distinguished himself by his naval services'against
the Portuguese and the French, was appointed admiral of the
fleet. '

The Portuguese war arose in this wise. Prince Rupert had
taken refuge in the Tagus, having gone there after escaping from

. Kinsale Harbour where Blake was watching for him. Blake

demanded leave from thePortuguese Government to attack
Prince Rupert's fleet, as belonging to the foes of the English
Commonwealth. On being refused permissionhe fell upon aI. .- 392:. How Blake made Van T romp

Portuguese fleet then returning from Brazil, burning three of
their ships and capturing seventeen. . The King of Portugal
ordered Prince Rupert to attack Blake and recover the
Brazilian ships. The Prince declined the honour, and quitted
the Tagus, where he could no longer be protected,'while Blake
was taking home his Portuguese prizes. - '

The French war in 1650-51 arose out of the raids of
privateers on English merchant ships. Blake was then _in the
Mediterranean, where he had blockaded Prince Rupert in the
port of Malaga, and attacking him there had destroyed three of
his ships, and forced him to. quit the sea, and take refuge at
the SpaniSh Court. A French war-ship heaving in sight soon
after, Blake ordered the captain to come on board,.meaning to
a'sk'why privateering was carried on against merchant ships
of a friendly nation. The captain was asked to deliver up his .
sword, in. token of surrender of his ship. 'He gallantly refused,
although in Blake's power ; and Blake said " he was at liberty
to go back to his ship and defend it as long as he could."
After a fight of two or three hours the Frenchman struck, and

. surrendered his sword.

These seem rather high-handed proceedings, but the Dutch
war, which soon followed, was a war of duty and of self-
defence. On'the 18th of May, 1652, Van Tromp appeared in
the" Downs with a fleet of forty-five men-of--war; Blake had
only twenty. 'On the approach of the Dutch admiral three .
shots were fired as a signal, to intimate that a foreign fleet
ought in courtesy to Iowa his flag in entering the seas of
another nation. Van Tromp answered with a broadside.
Blake, perceiving that this point of honour and international
usage was disregarded, anxious also to prevent an open'
rupture and a general action, advanced alone with his flag-
ship, in order to treat with the Dutch commander. The
Dutch, disregarding the customs of war, closed upon him, and
fired on him with their whole fleet. It was some time before
the English ships could come to his assistance, and although
receiving a vast number of shots little damage was done,take t/zq Broom from Izz's Top-mast; 393

while two of the Dutch ships were destroyed. Only fifteen
men were'killed in the admiral's ship, for which Blake
acknowledged the special preservation of God, and ascribed his
success to the justice of the cause, the attack being both
unprovoked and treacherous.

For some months the war continued with varying success,
the Dutch having the superior armaments; but their losses
being so great, De Ruyter and De Witt were superseded, and
Van Tromp was entrusted with the sole command. .Blake
had to weaken his fleet by sending detachments to protect
the coasts and the shipping, and he had less than forty sail in
the Downs ill-manned and ill-supplied, for the Parliament had '
begun to be jealous of allowing undue powerrto officers either
on land or sea. Van Tromp, desiring to distinguish his
resumption of command by a decisive victory, steered for the
Downs with eighty ships of war and ten fire-ships. More
than half of Blake's ships had had to lie idle, without engaging,
for want of seamen. To have retired before so overwhelming
a force would have been no dishonour, but Blake had too
much personal valour, and too sensitive a jealousy for his
country's honour, to do so without a fight. Every one of the
twenty-two ships he took into action was assailed by two or
three of the enemy, and he lost two men-of-war and four
frigates, but not without a gallant resistance, for of the
Dutchmen one was blown up and two or three disabled, when
Blake Withdrew his fleet into the 'Thames. It was then
that Van Tromp raised the broom on his top-mast in his
triumphant passage through the English Channel. But his
triumph was short.

On the 18th of February, 1652- 3, Blake led eighty ships
against a nearly equal force of the enemy. For three days
and nights the battle continued, and at last the Dutch had to
retire into their ports, or behind the shoals, which they were
able to do from the less draught of their vessels, while the
English ships could not follow. In one of the actions above
a hundred men were killed on board Blake's ship, the
Triumph, and as many in the Fairfax, under Captain Lawson,
and the admiral himself was wounded, but no ship was
taken. The Dutch lost several .ships in the three days' fight;
their own writers confessing to eight men-of-war and twenty
_merchant ships, probably an, insufficient estimate, for the
news of the defeat caused such popular discontent, _that.the
people compelled the 'States General to ask for peace, which
was not, however, yet to be obtained. '
In April of the same year, 1653, the form of government in
England was changed, and Cromwell became Lord Protector .
of the Commonwealth. Blake, and his naval comrades, like
Hale and Milton, and the greatest and best men of the nation,
declared that they were ready to stand to their duties to the
country, notwithstanding change in the adm'iniStration. "It is
not the business 'of a Seaman," said Blake, " to mind state
afi'airs, but to hinder foreigners from fooling us I"
On the 30th of April, Blake, with Monk and Dean, sailed with
a large fleet, and soondrovo all Dutchmen in the Channel into
the Texel. They then set out in quest of Van Tramp, who was
in the north seas, protecting the fishing vessels. Van Tromp
steered towards the Sound, and so eluded his pursuers.
Several engagements took place during the early summer,
'notably one on the 4th of June, during which Van Tromp
boarded the ship of Admiral Penn, but was beaten off, and his
ewn vessel -,boarded when he was. relieved by the advance of
De. Ruyter and De. Witt, whoseservices were again in requisi-
tion. After this battle the Dutch were clamorous for peace,
and the States had to 'obey their wish. The admirals were
summoned to give their opinion. Van Tromp said that
"without great'reinforcements of large men- of- -war he could
serve them no more , " and De Witt exclaimed," Why should
I be silent before my lords of the states? The. English are
our masters, and by consequence masters of the sea." '
In November 1654 Cromwell sent Blake with a powerful
fleet to the Mediterranean. While there the English admiral
was pmtector of the sea, his superiority being recognized by the
haughty Spaniards and the lawless Algerians, as it already was
by the surly 'Dutch. At Tunis many English captives were
said to be in slavery; Blake demanded their surrender. The
Governor drew up his ships under the guns of the forts, Castle
Goletta and Porto Ferino, " on which," he said, " you may do
your worst." 'For ships to engage at cloSe quarters fortresses
on land, was a thing unheard of .heretofore in naval warfare,
but Blake went at them. In less than three hours every gun
in the castle was silenced, and while he kept pegging away
' at the fortifications, nine well-manned and well-armed boats
were sent inside, and every piratical ship was sunk or fired,
with a total loss of only twenty-five of Blake's men killed, and
forty-eight wounded. ,The admiral then went to Tripoli and
other nests of pirates on the 'African coast, collecting a tribute
from the rulers, and threatening vengeance if the capture of
Christians for slavery were continued. Nor was it renewed
till Cromwell and Blake had gone to their- rest, and under the
inglorious reigns of Charles II. and James II. thevsun of
England's greatness was darkened. In those reigns all was
lost, even English honour. The nation was subservient to the
_Crown, and the Crown to France; and again the Dutch flag .
was seen in the Thames unchallenged and unresistedl It
was time for the national awakening, which ended in the -
Revolution of 1688, and the accession of William III.

The respect with which Blake caused the name of England
to be treated is .seen in a story which Bishop'Burnet re-
cords. When he lay at Malaga, some of the sailors on shore
meeting a procession of the host refused to kneel as it passed,
as all around did. The priest in charge incited the people
to attack them. On returning to the ship, and telling of
this ill-treatment, Blake 'sent to the Viceroy or Governor
of Malaga, demanding that the priest should be sent aboard
his ship. The Governor replied that "he had no authority .
over persons ecclesiastical." Blake sent to say that "he did
not inquire into the Governor's authority, but if the priest
were not sent within three hours he would bombard the town."
The priest was sent, and pleaded the provocation given by
the sailors. To which the admiral replied, that if complaint
had been made to him, the sailors would have been punished
severely, for he would not let his men afl'ront the religion
of any place, especially of a friendly power; but he was
angry that the Spaniards assumed that power, and " he would
have all the world know that an Englishman was only to
be punished by an Englishman." So, having used the priest
civilly, he sent him back, being satisfied that he was in his
power. '

When the news of this came home, the conduct of Blake
pleased Cromwell greatly, and he read the letter in Council
with much satisfaction, saying, " he hoped to make the name
of an Englishman as great as even- that of a Roman had been."

In 1656 war with Spain was declared, and both on the
coasts of the old kingdom, and in their dominions in the New
World the ships of Blake had a series of glorious successes.
The destruction of the Spanish fleet at Santa Cruz, a fleet
of great power, under the guns of strong fortresses, was
an achievement never surpassed in the annals of the English
- navy. .The least of the Spanish ships was larger than the
greatest of Blake's, yet he shattered the forts, and destroyed
the fleet. " The whole action," says the historian Clarendon,
." was so incredible, that all men who knew the place, won.
dered that any sober man, with whatever courage endowed,
would ever have undertaken it." The Admiral cruised for
some months longer, and intercepted many of the rich Spanish '

trading ships, but broken by the fatigue of the last three years.
he resolved to return home, and died before he came to land.

His body was embalmed, and having lain' in state at Green-
wich, was laid with all honour in Westminster Abbey. .The
nation mourned his loss, and not a man who ever had served
under him but lamented his loss as that of a father.

The opinion of Lord Clarendon as to his courage has been
quoted, and we give that of another Royalist to "his lofty
. character and spotless integrity." So Dr. Johnson speaks oiDavid Douglas, Me Botanical Collector.- 397

him, in telling of his noble deeds, and says :--" Nor is it
without regret that I am obliged to relate the treatment his
body met with a year after the Restoration, when it was
taken up,' by express command, and buried in a pit in
St. Margaret's 'churchyard. Had he been guilty of the
mu'rder of Charles 1., to insult his body had been a mean
revenge; but as he was innocent, it was inhumanity and
ingratitude, But that regard which was denied his body,
has been paid to his better remains, his name and memory."

DAVID DOUGLAS, THE BOTANICAL COLLECTOR.

'ANY of the stately trees and lovely flowers now familiar
to us were unknown to our forefathers, and have
been introduced from foreign lands to English parks and'
gardens. A few of them have been sent or brought home by
residents in distant regions, or by those who have gone there
in the course of ordinary voyages and travels, but the larger
part have been obtained by regular collectors sent out for the
purpose, either by public bodies or by private persons of
wealth. There are always numbers of botanical collectors
thus wandering in various parts of the world, some of them in
the common course of trade, at the cost of nurserymen and
florists, who find it pays them well to employ such travellers.
One of the earliest and most successful of these botanical
travellers was a Scotchman, David Douglas, whose name is
attached to the magnificent pine tree, the Abies Dauglasii, the
seeds, of which he first brought to this country from British
Columbia. A brief account of his adventurous life, too soon
cut short by a tragical death, will be read with interest.
He began his career by being apprenticed to the head

* The same indignity was put on the remains of Cromwell and other
men who had made England great. Thus was illustrated the Eastern
apologue about the monkeys pulling the dead lion's beard !
gardener at Scone Palace-where he worked, from the age of

twelve, for seven years. When nineteen he obtained a situation

- at Culross, in the garden of Sir Robert PreSton. At this place
were many exotic plants, which greatly ekcited his curiosity,
and at the mansion there was a good library, including books .
on botany, which he was permitted to use, so that the tWo
years he was at Culross were very-- pleasantly and profitably
spent. He then obtained employment in the Botanic Garden
at Glasgow, under the superintendence of Sir William Jackson
Hooker, the father of Sir Joseph Hooker of Kew Gardens.
Dr. Hooker took much notice of the young and enthusiastic
gardener, and allowed him to attend the lectures on botany,
which were given to the medical students of Glasgow Univer-
sity. . He also took him as his companion in excursions during
the summer months in the Scottish Highlands and islands. He
thus was prepared for his life-work under the most favourable
auspices. ' '

In . 1824 the Hudson's Bay Company resolved to send a
botanical collector to the vaSt regions of British Columbia, then
under their authority. Dr. Hooker being asked to recommend
a suitable person, David Douglas at once received the appoint-
ment. In those times the .only way to reach the Western
regions of North America was by a long sea voyage, in a sail-
ing ship, round Cape Horn. The voyage lasted about nine
months, for the ship did not anchor in Columbia River till
April 8th, 1825. ' '

_ Of the incidents of the voyage a record was kept by Douglas

' in his Journal. There was much to interest him, and nothing
pleased him more than a visit to Juan Fernandez, on which '
island, strangely enough, another Robinson Crusoe was found.
On the second day after their arrival, while Douglas and some
companions were exploring, an uncouth-looking skin-covered.
man startled them by springing from among the bushes. His
name was William Clark, and he had come from London five
years before. He seemed contented to stay there, and satisfied-
with .the occasional, intercourse with his fellow-men when a
ship.touched at the island. As he did not discover himself on
the first day, it is likely that he reconnoitred the strangers
before making his appearance, so as to judge whether their
company would be agreeable or safe. He had a few books,
among which were " Robinson Crusoe " and "Cowper's Poems."
From the latter he had committed to memory the piece upon
Alexander Selkirk. Douglas says in his _Joumal: "No pen-
can correctly describe the charming and rural appearance of
this island." He took away specimens of the native plants,
and in return sowed various seeds of fruits and vegetables,
which have enriched the island since his visit.

Arrived at Columbia Douglas soon found his way to Fort
Vancouver, where the chief factor, a fellow countryman, Dr.
M'Lauchlan, gave him a warm welcome. He lost no time in
commencing his explorations from this place as his head-
quarters. His labour was at times interrupted by the rainy
weather, but he made such large collections of seeds and
plants that his deer~skin tent was too straitened to hold his
treasures, and a larger hut of dried oak bark had to be built
for their reception and preservation. When the ship was
ready to return, at the end of four months, he was able to
despatch a large collection of specimens. His hut he expected
would be useful for winter shelter, but as long as he was' able
to move about he preferred rougher quarters. At the begin--
ning of his first autumn he wrote: "I have been in a house only
three nights since my arrival in North- Western America, and
these were my first after my debarkation."

On his journeys he used to wander about, with his gun
across his shoulder, and his vasculum, or botanical box,
strapped on his back, attended only by his faithful Scotch
terrier, rough and shaggy as his master. The Indians all
knew him, mostly taking him for a " big medicine." The
forest was his home. The fur traders' well-appointed stations
never tempted him" to stay long. _ He preferred to sleep
under one of his own pine-trees. The trappers called him

the "Grass Man."
He sacrificed everything for the sake of his plants. On
one occasion we find him wearing a damp shirt, in order
to keep the dry one to wrap around his specimens. On
another, when he crossed the Columbia river, he congratulates
himSelf that, while he had lost all his provisions, he had saved
his plants. Having formed the resolution to cross the
continent from the Pacific to the Atlantic, a journey of more
than three thousand miles, he describes his outfit: " My store
of clothes is very low, nearly reduced to what I have on
my back--one pair of shoes, no stockings, two shirts, two
handkerchiefs,1 my blanket, and cloak. Thus I adapt my
costume to that of the country, as I could not carry more
without reducing myself to an inadequate supply of paper,
and such articles as I required for my business."

As an instance of his self-denial and perseverance, We may
recount what he did and endured 'in the discovery of the
Pinus Lambertiana,- which is now scarcely less famous than
the pine-tree called by his name. Having secured one of its
remarkably large cones from the Indians, he resolved to visit
the place in the following spring. After many difficulties he
reached the grove, and saw the precious cones hanging like
sugar-loaves from the pendulous branches. He secured three
of these with almost fatal result. He could neither climb the
tree nor hew it down ; he therefore attempted to shoot down
the cones. The Indians, hearing the report of his gun,
speedily surrounded him in warlike array, with their bows,
arrows, bone-tipped spears, and knives. He had invaded their
sacred grove; he had dared to fire upon their sacred trees.
He managed to allay their wrath, and betook himself to the -
depths of the forest. In returning he encountered greater
dangers. He lost his way; he again was opposed by hostile
Indians; he was exposed to a pitiless storm. Twelve days
he spent in extreme misery and danger, during which his .
horse perished, before he came out on the Columbia and was
taken care of by his friends.

Shortly after this he made a journey into California, and
whilst there exploring its rich herbage and wonderful arborage,
had the good fortune to fall in with a kindred spirit, _Dr.
Coulter, who had been collecting in Mexico, and with great
joy writes to Dr. Hooker, "As a salmon-fisher he is superior-
to Walter Campbell of Islay--the Izaak Walton of Scotland--
besides being a beautiful shot with a rifle, nearly as successful
as myself I And I do assure you from my heart it' is
a terrible pleasure tome thus to meet a really good man,
and one with whom I can talk of plan-ts."

He manifested the greatest prudence in dealing with the
Indians, many of whom had never seen the face of a white
man before. When one was boasting of his superiority to
the King George men, Douglas quietly lifted his gun and
brought down a bird which was flying overhead. They never
shoot anything on the wing. This manifestation of his power
caused them to lay their hands upon their mouths in token ol
fear. "My fame was hereupon sounded through the country.
Ever since, I have found it to be of the utmost importance to
bring down a bird flying when I go near any of their lodges,
taking care to make it appear as a little matter, not done to be
observed." On another occasion, having finished a piece of
salmon in the presence of a large number of Indians of whom
he was not sure, he brought from his pocket some effervescing
powder which he carried as medicine, put it into some water,
stirred' it with his finger, and drank it before them. This had
immense effect. A man. that could swallow. boiling water was
not to be interfered with, especially one who could boil it with
his fingerl Sometimes he struck terror into their hearts by.
lighting his pipe with a lens, and greatly impressed them by
putting on his blue spectacles. A friendly chief having done
him a service, the " Grass Man " bored a hole through his only
shilling, and suspended it by a brass wire to the septum of his
nose, which was pierced according to the custom of his tribe. '
Another chief was rewarded for similar service by being
shaved after the fashion of white men. In sailing up one of
the rivers he was accompanied by Madsue, or "Thunder,"

' 26
who was long famous in the region around the Columbia.
Thunder would not taste'liquor, but he made up for it in
smoking. In self-defence Douglas smoked also. In this,
however, he astonished his companion by putting out the
smoke'from his mouth, which these Indians did not do.
" Oh i " cried Thunder, " why do you. throw away the smoke ?
See, I take it in my belly." -

Having. made journeys 'with many perils through Oregon,

Washington Territory, and California, he started to go farther
north through. British Columbia and Russian America. In
crossing the" Fraser river, up near Quesnelle, his canoe was
dashed to pieces against -the rocks, all his provisions and
specimens lost, himself cast into the waters, and thrown
benumbed and'bleeding upon the shore. This was a great
'disaster. It not only discouraged him from proceeding on
that journey, but made him eager to return home; More than
four hundred specimens, the result of laborious toil, were
there destroyed in a few minutes. His misfortune was felt
all the more from the fact that the ten years' toil and exposure
had already told severely upon his frame. He could not shoot
well, as his eyesight had begun to fail. He became lonely,
_desolate, despondent, and acknowledges that but for the
companionship of his Bible, which he carried with him and
perused in all his wanderings, and the sympathy and support
of the Faithful Redeemer in whom he believed, he must have
perished 1n utter hopelessness. '

He therefore made preparations for his return to Britain,
'and left the Columbia river in October 1833. The ship
touched at the Sandwich Islands, and had to wait there for
cargo. He therefore set out to explore the country--especially
the volcanic region. On the 7th January, 1834, he started
to visit the volcano Mauna Kea. Returning from the sum-.
mit of the mountain, hungry, thirsty, blistered, and jaded, .
he Wrote: " Gratified though one may be at witnessing the
wonderful works of God in such a place, it is with thankful-
ness that we approach a climate more congenial to our natures,
and welcome the habitations of our fellow-men, where we
are refreshed with the scent of vegetation and soothed by
the melody of birds. "

In the last of his letters to Professor Hooker he said. " May

God grant me a safe return to England. I cannot but indulge
the pleasing hope of being soon able in person to thank you
for the signal kindness you have ever done me." But in this
he was disappointed. He had resolved to visit Mauna Kea
once more. At six o'clock in the morning of the 12th July he
called at the house of Edward Gurney, an Englishman who
had a house in the region of the mountain, He stated that
his servant had failed on the way, and requested him to show
' him the best path. After breakfasting together Gurney
accompanied him for about a .mile, pointed'out the different
paths, and specially warned him of the pit-traps, of which
there were many, for the catching of Wild cattle. He had riot
gone more than two miles when he came to one, of these, into
which a bullock had fallen. He looked into it, passed by,
and went' up the hill. There, some idea induced him to
turn. Laying down his bundle, beside which _his faithful
terrier remained, he proceeded to. examine the pit more
minutely.

While doing this he missed his footstcp and fell down into'
the pit beside the enraged bullock. Two natives who were,
passing were attracted by his cries, and saw Douglas under
the feet of the animal. They ran as quickly as they could for
Gurney, who shot the bullock, but found that Douglas was
already dead. After removing the mangled body, Gurney
took charge of the dog, and the bundle, and the other things
which he had' in his pockets, which were duly forwarded.
Thus ended the life of Douglas when thirty-five years of age.
Exactly ten years after his first embarkation for America his
body was brought down to Oahu for burial. His death was .
all the more unfortunate as he had not completed. his account
of his explorations in the north-west. He had lost fou1

, hundred of his last collected specimens in attempting to cross
'the Fraser river. His subsequent sickness and despondency
'had prevented him describing them.

Notwithstanding these misfortunes and his death ere he had
reached middle life, Douglas had done noble work, and attained
a character that will ever rank high among those who have
advanced the interests of humanity. On the reverse side of
his monument, "erected by the lovers of botany' in Europe "
to his memory in Scone churchyard, there is given a list " of
a few of the numerous trees, shrubs, and ornamental plants
introduced by Douglas." Among these We recognise many of
the annuals 'now common in our gardens, and of the trees and
shrubs that are favourites in our grounds. Thus are his name
and memory perpetuated not only by his monumental stone,
but by the widely-distributed Douglas pine and other trees in
many lands. Their waving branches, moved by the winds,
will sound forth the melancholy requiem of him who loved so
well the old forests.

His early friend and patron Dr. Hooker published his
journal, or as much of it as reached home, and long years
after, a Scotch clergyman, Mr. Somerville, gathered many
traditions from those who knew him in British Columbia.

From these sources we have obtained most of the facts of
the foregoing narrative.

how graphically and instructively he can tell the story of .his travels. And many
of them are acquainted with this very book, and have assigned it a place amongst
their favourites; but this edition is illustrated by nine engravings that add much
to its interest, and has also a new introduction, making interesting reference to
incidents that have occurred since the ' First Impressions' were originally published, '
and also to the first impressions of other visitors to America. The immense mass of
information supplied by these records makes them very valuable, and it is worked into

them much of the useful and interesting information which an. intelligent traveller not
only picks up, but takes special pains to furnish himself with. The volume is a series
of photographs of America as it was in 1870, and is full, therefore, of practical interest."

"The narrative is very interesting. "--Qutm.
" This is a picturesque story of a time which now seems curiously remote."---Daily

" The_story is written in the first person, and the mingled ease and simplicity of the
style make it very pleasant reading. It may-be regarded as a description of the life of
the North American Indians, regarded from their own point of View. There is much
strange, exciting incident and adventure and many interesring matters of American
history are embodied."--~S'c/mnl Board Chronicle. ' '

. "Dr. Macaulay has revived with excellent efl'ect a true story of Indian life. The

story has a thoroughly genuine look. But though the savage pictured here is scarcely

of human nature in him."--Pall Mafl Gaunt.

" Dr. Macaulay has given us in this volume an account of life among the Indians in
the form of a personal narrative. The incidents are drawn from the statements of one
who, some years ago, was taken prisoner and kept amongst the Indians when young,
and who, growing up amongst them, acquired the knowledge of thetr ways which he
afterwards made public. The story is told in a'spirited fashton, and forms extremel
