LIFE AND ADVENTURES 



OF 



EOBINSON CEUSOE. 



I was born in the year 1632, in the city of York, of a good 
family, though not of that country, my father being a foreigner 
of Bremen, who settled first at Hull : he got a good estate 
by merchandise, and leaving off his trade, lived afterwards at 
York ; from whence he had married my mother, whose re- 
lations were named Eobinson, a very good family in that 
country, and from whom I was called Eobinson Kreutznaer ; 
but, by the usual corruption of words in England, we are 
now called — nay, we call ourselves, and write our name — 
Crusoe ; and so my companions always called me. 

I had two elder brothers, one of whom was lieutenant- 
colonel to an English regiment of foot in Flanders, formerly 
commanded by the famous Colonel Lockhart, and was killed 
at the battle near Dunkirk against the Spaniards. What be- 
came of my second brother I never knew, any more than my 
father or mother did know what was become of me. 

Being the third son of the family, and not bred to any 
trade, my head began to be filled very early with rambling 
thoughts ; my father, who was very ancient, had given me a 
competent share of learning, as far as house education and a 
country free-school generally go, and designed me for the 
(aw ; but I would be satisfied with nothing but going to sea ; 
and my inclination to this led me so strongly against the will, 
nay, the commands of my father, and against all the entreaties 
and persuasions of my mother and other friends, that there 
seemed to be something fatal in that propensity of nature, 
tending directly to the life of misery which was to befall me. 

My father, a wise and grave man, gave me serious and ex- 



10 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

cellent counsel against what he foresaw was my design. He 
called me one morning into his chamber, where he was con- 
fined by the gout, and expostulated ve.'y warmly with me 
upon this subject : he asked me what reasons, more than a 
mere wandering inclination, I had for leaving my father's 
house and my native country, where I might be well intro- 
duced, and had a prospect of raising my fortune by appli- 
cation and industry, with a life of ease and pleasure. He 
told me it was men of desperate fortunes on one hand, or of 
aspiring, superior fortunes on the other, who went abroad 
upon adventures, to rise by enterprise, and make themselves 
famous in undertakings of a nature out of the common road ; 
that these things were all either too far above me, or too far 
below me ; that mine was the middle state, or what might be 
called the upper station of low life, which he had found, by 
long experience, was the best state in the world, and the 
most suited to human happiness ; that the middle station of 
life was calculated for all kind of virtues and all kind of en- 
joyments ; that peace and plenty were the handmaids of a 
middle fortune; that temperance, moderation, quietness, health, 
society, all agreeable diversions, and all desirable pleasures, 
were the blessings attending the middle station of life ; that 
this way men went silently and smoothly through the world, 
and comfortably out of it, not embarrassed with the labours 
of the hands or of the head, not sold to a life of slavery for 
daily bread, or harassed with perplexed circumstances, which 
rob the soul of peace, and the body of rest. 

After this, he pressed me earnestly, and in the most affec- 
tionate manner, not to play the young man, nor to precipitate 
myself into miseries which nature, and the station of life I 
was born in, seemed to have provided against ; that as he 
would do very kind things for me if I would stay and settle 
at home as he directed, so he would not have so much hand 
in my misfortunes, as to give me any encouragement to go 
away : and to close all, he told me I had an elder brother for 
an example, to whom he had used the same earnest persuasions 
to keep him from going into the Low Country wars, but could 
not prevail, his young desires prompting him to run into the 
army, where he was killed ; and though he said he would not 
cease to pray for me, yet he would venture to say to me, that 
if I did take this foolish step, God would not bless me, and I 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 1] 

should have leisure hereafter to reflect upon having neglected 
his counsel, when there might be none to assist in my re- 
covery. 

I observed in this last part of his discourse, which was 
truly prophetic, though I suppose my father did not know it 
to be so himself, the tears run down his face very plentifully, 
especially when he spoke of my brother who was killed ; and 
that when he spoke of my having leisure to repent, and none 
to assist me, he was so moved that he broke off the discourse, 
and told me his heart was so full he could say no more to me. 

I was sincerely affected with this discourse, as indeed who 
could be otherwise ? and I resolved not to think of going 
abroad any more, but to settle at home according to my 
father's desire. But, alas! a few days wore it all off; and, 
in short, to prevent any of my father's further importunities, 
in a few weeks after, I resolved to run quite away from him. 
However, I did not act quite so hastily as the first heat of my 
resolution prompted, but I took my mother, at a time when I 
thought her a little pleasanter than ordinary, and told her 
that my thoughts were so entirely bent upon seeing the 
world, that I should never settle to anything with resolution 
enough to go through with it, and my father had better give 
me his consent than force me to go without it ; that I was 
now eighteen years old, which was too late to go apprentice 
to a trade, or clerk to an attorney ; that I was sure, if I did, 
I should never serve out my time, but I should certainly run 
away from my master before my time was out, and go to sea ; 
and if she would speak to my father to let me go one voyage 
abroad, if I came home again, and did not like it, I would go 
no more ; and I would promise, by a double diligence, to re- 
cover the time that I had lost. 

This put my mother into a great passion ; she told me she 
knew it would be to no purpose to speak to my father upon 
any such subject ; and that, if I would ruin myself, there was 
no help for me ; but I might depend I should never have their 
consent to it ; and I should never have it to say that my 
mother was willing when my father was not. 

Though my mother refused to name it to my father, yet I 
heard afterwards that she reported all the discourse to him, 
and that my father, after showing a great concern at it, said 
to her, with a sigh, " That boy might be happy if he would 



12 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

stay at home ; but if he goes abroad, he will be the most 
miserable wretch that ever was born ; I can give no consent 
to it." 

It was not till almost a year after this that I broke loose, 
though, in the meantime, I continued obstinately deaf to all 
proposals of settling to business, and frequently expostulated 
with my father and mother about their being so positively de- 
termined against what they knew my inclinations prompted 
me to. But being one day at Hull, whither I went casually, 
and without any purpose of making an elopement at that 
time, and one of my companions going by sea to London in 
his father's ship, and prompting me to go with them, with the 
common allurement of a seafaring man, that it should cost me 
nothing for my passage, I consulted neither father nor mother 
any more, nor so much as sent them word of it ; but leaving 
them to hear of it as they might, without asking God's bless- 
ing or my father's, without any consideration of circumstances 
or consequences, and in an ill hour, God knows, on the 1st of 
September, 1651, I went on board a ship bound for London. 
The ship was no sooner got out of the Humber, than the wind 
began to blow and the sea to rise in a most frightful manner ; 
and, as I had never been at sea before, I was most inex- 
pressibly sick in body, and terrified in mind. I began now 
seriously to reflect upon what I had done, and how justly I 
was overtaken by the judgment of Heaven for my wicked 
leaving rr\y father's house, and abandoning my duty. 

All thi i while the storm increased, and the sea went very 
high, 1L0 igh nothing like what I have seen many times since; 
no, nor what I saw a few days after ; but it was enough to 
affect me then, who was but a young sailor, and had never 
known anything of the matter. I expected every wave would 
have swallowed us up, and that every time the ship fell down, 
as I thought it did, in the trough or hollow of the sea, we 
should never rise more : in this agony of mind, I made many 
vows and resolutions, that if it would please God to spare my 
life in this one voyage, if ever I got once my foot upon dry 
land again, I would go directly home to my father, and never 
set it into a ship again while I lived. 

These wise and sober thoughts continued all the while the 
storm lasted, and indeed some time after ; but the next day 
the wind was abated, and the sea calmer, and I began to be a 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 13 

little inured to it; however, I was very grave for all that day, 
being also a little sea-sick still ; but towards night the weather 
cleared up, the wind was quite over, and a charming fine 
evening followed ; the sun went down perfectly clear, and 
rose so the next morning ; and having little or no wind, and 
a smooth sea, the sun shining upon it, the sight was, as I 
thought, the most delightful that ever I saw. 

I had slept well in the night, and was now no more sea- 
sick, but very cheerful, looking with wonder upon the sea that 
was so rough and terrible the day before, and could be so 
calm and so pleasant in so little a time after. And now, lest 
my good resolutions should continue, my companion, who had 
enticed me away, comes to me : " Well, Bob," says he, clap- 
ping me upon the shoulder, " how do you do after it ? I 
warrant you were frighted, wer'n't you, last night, when it 
blew but a capful of wind ?" — " A capful, d'yc-u call it ?" 
said I ; " 'twas a terrible storm." — " A storm, you fool you," 
replies he ; " do you call that a storm ? Why, it was nothing 
at all ; give us but a good ship and sea-room, and we think 
nothing of such a squall of wind as that ; but you're but a 
fresh-water sailor, Bob. Come, let us make a bowl of punch, 
and we'll forget all that ; d'ye see what charming weather 'tis 
now 1" To make short this sad part of my story, we went 
the way of all sailors ; the punch was made, and I was made 
half-drunk with it ; and in that one night's wickedness I 
drowned all my repentance, all my reflections upon my past 
conduct, all my resolutions for the future. As the sea was 
returned to its smoothness of surface and settled calmness by 
the abatement of that storm, so the hurry of my thoughts 
being over, my fears and apprehensions of being swallowed 
up by the sea being forgotten, and the current of my former 
desires returned, I entirely forgot the vows and promises that 
I made in my distress ; and I had, in five or six days, got as 
complete a victory over my conscience as any young fellow 
that resolved not to be troubled with it could desire. But I 
was to have another trial for it still. 

The sixth day of our being at sea we came into Yarmouth 
Eoads ; the wind having been contrary, and the weather calm, 
we had made but little way since the storm. Here we were 
obliged to come to an anchor, and here we lay, the wind con- 
tinuing contrary, viz., at south-west, for seven or eight days, 



14 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

during which time a great many ships from Newcastle came 
into the same roads, as the common harbour where the ships 
might wait for a wind for the river. 

We had not, however, rid here so long, but we should have 
tided it up the river, but that the wind blew too fresh, and, 
after we had lain four or five days, blew very hard. How- 
ever, the roads being reckoned as good as a harbour, the 
anchorage good, and our ground-tackle very strong, our men 
were unconcerned, and not in the least apprehensive of danger, 
but spent the time in rest and mirth, after the manner of the 
sea ; but the eighth day, in the morning, the wind increased, 
and we had all hands at work to strike our top-masts, and 
make everything snug and close, that the ship might ride as 
easy as possible. By noon the sea went very high indeed, 
and our ship rid forecastle in, shipped several seas, and we 
thought once or twice our anchor had come home ; upon 
which our master ordered out the sheet-anchor, so that we 
rode with two anchors a-head, and the cables veered out to 
the better end. 

By this time it blew a terrible storm indeed ; and now I 
began to see terror and amazement in the faces even of the 
seamen themselves. The master, though vigilant in the busi- 
ness of preserving the ship, yet, as he went in and out of his 
cabin by me, I could hear him softly to himself say several 
times, " Lord, be merciful to us ! we shall be all lost ; we 
shall be all undone I" and the like. During these first hurries 
I was lying still in my cabin ; but when the master himself 
came by me, and said we should be all lost, I was dreadfully 
frighted. I got up out of my cabin and looked out ; but 
such a dismal sight I never saw : the sea ran mountains high, 
and broke upon us every three or four minutes ; when I could 
look about, I could see nothing but distress round us ; two 
ships that rid near us, we found, had cut their masts by the 
board, being deep laden ; and our men cried out, that a ship 
which rid about a mile a-head of us was foundered. Two 
more ships, being driven from their anchors, were run out of 
the road3 to sea, at all adventures, and that not with a mast 
standing. The light ships fared the best, as not so much 
labouring in the sea; but two or three of them drove, and 
came close by us, running away with only their spritsail out 
before the wind. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 15 

Towards evening the mate and boatswain begged the master 
of our ship to let them cut away the fore-mast, which he was 
very unwilling to do ; but the boatswain protesting to him, 
that if he did not, the ship would founder, he consented; and 
when they had cut away the fore-mast, the main-mast stood 
so loose, and shook the ship so much, they were obliged to 
cut that away also, and make a clear deck. 

Any one must judge what a condition I must be in at all 
this, who was but a young sailor, and who had been in such 
a fright before at but a little. But the worst was not come 
yet ; the storm continued with such fury, that the seamen 
themselves acknowledged they had never seen a worse. We 
had a good ship, but she was deep laden, and wallowed in 
the sea, so that the seamen every now and then cried out she 
would founder. It was my advantage in one respect that I 
did not know what they meant by founder, till I inquired. 
However, the storm was so violent, that I saw, what is not 
often seen, the master, the boatswain, and some others more 
sensible than the rest, at their prayers, and expecting every 
moment that the ship would go to the bottom. In the-middle 
of the night, and under all the rest of our distresses, one of 
the men that had been down to see, cried out we had sprung 
a leak ; another said, there was four feet water in the hold. 
Then all hands ^ere called to the pump. At that word, my 
heart, as I thought, died within me ; and I fell backwards 
upon the side of the bed where I sat, into the cabin. How- 
ever, the men roused me, and told me, that I, that was able 
to do nothing before, was as well able to pump as another ; 
at which I stirred up, and went to the pump, and worked 
very heartily. While this was doing, the master seeing some 
light colliers, who, not able to ride out the storm, were obliged 
to slip, and run away to the sea, and would come near us, 
ordered a gun to be fired as a signal of distress. I, who 
knew nothing what they meant, thought the ship had broken, 
or some dreadful thing happened. In a word, I was so surprised 
that I fell down in a swoon. As this was a time when every- 
body had his own life to think of, nobody minded me, or 
what was become of me ; but another man stepped up to the 
pump, and thrusting me aside with his foot, let me lie, thinking 
I had been dead ; and it was a great while before I came to 
myself. ' 



16 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 



We worked on ; but the water increasing in the hold, it 
was apparent that the ship would founder ; and though the 
storm began to abate a little, yet as it was not possible she 
could swim till we might run into any port, so the master 




continued firing guns for help ; and a light ship, who had rid 
it out just a-head of us, ventured a boat out to help us. It 
was with the utmost hazard the boat came near us, but it was 
impossible for us to get on board, or for the boat to lie near 
the ship's side, till at last the men rowing very heartily, and 



EOBINSOX CIIUSOE.

venturing their lives to save ours, our men cast them a rope 
over the stern with a buoy to it, and then veered it out a 
great length, which they, after much labour and hazard, took 
hold of, and wo hauled them close under our stern, and "-ot

all into their boat. It was to no purpose for them or us, after 
we were in the boat, to think of reaching to their own ship ; 
so all agreed to let her drive, and only to pull her in towards 
shore as much as we could ; and our master promised them 
that if the boat was staved upon shore, he would make it 



IS? nouiNsox citusoi:. 

good to their master : so partly rowing, and partly driving, 
our boat went away to the northward, sloping towards the 
shore almost as far a3 Winterton Ness. 

We were not much more than a quarter of an hour out of 
our ship till we saw her sink, and then I understood for the 
first time what was meant by a ship foundering in the sea. I 
must acknowledge I had hardly eyes to look up when the 
seamen told me she was sinking ; for from the moment that 
they rather put me into the boat, than that I might be said to 
go in, my heart was, as it were, dead within me, partly with 
fright, partly with horror of mind, and the thoughts of what 
was yet before me. 

While we were in this condition — the men yet labouring at 
the oar to bring the boat near the snore — we could see (when, 
our boat mounting the waves, we were able to see the shore) 
a great many people running along the strand to assist us 
when we should come near ; but tve made but slow way to- 
wards the shore ; nor were we able to reach the shore, till, 
being past the lighthouse at Winterton, the shore falls off to 
the westward towards Cromer, and so the land broke off a 
little the violence of the wind. Here we got in, and, though 
not without much difficulty, got all safe on shore, and walked 
afterwards on foot to Yarmouth, where, as «nfortunate men, 
we were used with great humanity, as well by the magistrates 
of the town, who assigned ns good quarters, as by particular 
merchants and "owners of ships, and bad money given us 
sufficient to carry us either to London or back to Hull, as we 
thought fit. 

^But my ill fate pushed me on now with an obstinacy that 
nothing could resist ; and though I had several times loud 
calls from my reason, and my more composed judgment, to 
go home, yet I had no power to do it. 

My comrade, who had helped to harden me before, and 
who was the master's son, was now less forward than I. The 
first time ho spoke to me after we were at Yarmouth, winch 
•was not till two or three days, for we were separated in the 
town to several quarters, his tone was altered ; and, looking 
very melancholy, and shaking his head, he asked me how I 
did ; and, telling' his father who I was, and how I had come 
this voyage only for a trial, in order to go farther al'ivr.-l ; 
his father turning to mo, with a very grave and concerned 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 19 

tone, " Young man," says lie, " you ought never to go to sea 
any more ; you ought to take this for a plain and visible 
token that you are not to be a seafaring man." "Why, sir," 
said I, "will you go to sea no more?" "That is another 
case," said he ; "it is my colling, and therefore my duty ; but 
as you made this voyage for a trial, you see what a taste 
Heaven has given you of what you are to expect if you 
persist. Perhaps this has all befallen us on your account, 
like Jonah in the ship of Tarshish. Pray," continues he, 
" what are you ; and on what account did you go -to sea ?" 
Upon that I told him some of my story; at the end of which 
he burst out into a strange kind of passion. " What had I 
done," says he, "that such an unhappy wretch should come 
into my ship ? I would not set my foot in the same ship with 
thee again for a thousand pounds." However, he afterwards 
talked very gravely to me, exhorting me to go back to my 
father, and not tempt Providence to my ruin ; telling me I 
might see a visible hand of Heaven against me. " And, 
young man," said he, " depend upon it, if you do not go 
back, wherever you go, you will meet with nothing but dis- 
asters and disappointments, till your father's words are ful- 
filled upon you." 

We parted soon after ; for I made him little answer, and I 
saw him no more ; which way he went 1 • knew not. As for 
me, having some money in my pocket, I travelled to London 
by land ; and there, as well as on the road, had many strug- 
gles with myself, what course of life I should take, and whether 
I should go home or go to sea. 

As to going home, shame opposed the best motions that 
offered to my thoughts ; and it immediately occurred to me 
how I should be laughed at among the neighbours, and should 
be ashamed to see, not my father and mother only, but even 
everybody else. 

In this state of life, I remained some time, uncertain what 
measures to take, and what course of life to lead. An irre- 
sistible reluctance continued to going home; and as I stayed 
awhile, the remembrance of the distress I had been in wore 
off; and as that abated, the little motion I had in my desires 
to return wore off with it, till at last I quite laid aside the 
thoughts of it, and looked out for a voyage. 

That evil influence which carried me first away from my 



20 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

father's house, whatever it was, presented the most unfor- 
tunate of all enterprises to my view ; and I went on board a 
vessel bound to the coast of Africa ; or, as our sailors vul- 
garly called it, a voyage to Guinea. 

It was my great misfortune that in all these adventures I 
did not ship myself as a sailor ; when, though I might indeed 
have worked a little harder than ordinary, yet at the same 
time I should have learnt the duty and office of a fore-mast 
man ; and in time might have qualified myself for a mate or 
lieutenant, if not for a master. But as it was always my fate 
to choose for the worse, so I did here ; for having money in 
my pocket, and good clothes upon my back, I would always 
go on board in the habit of a gentleman ; and so I neither 
had any business in the ship, nor learned to do any. 

It was my lot first of all to fall into pretty good company in 
London. I first got acquainted with the master of a ship who 
had been on the coast of Guinea: and who, having had very 
good success there, was resolved to go again : this captain 
taking a fancy to my conversation, which was not at all dis- 
agreeable at that time, hearing me say I had a mind to see 
the world, told me if I would go the voyage with him I should 
be at no expense ; I should be his messmate and his com- 
panion ; and if I could carry anything with me, I should 
have all the advantage of it that the trade would admit ; and 
perhaps I might meet with some encouragement. 

I embraced the offer ; and entering into a strict friendship 
with this captain, who was an honest, plain-dealing man, I 
went the voyage with him, and carried a small adventure 
with me, which, by the disinterested honesty of my friend 
the captain, I increased very considerably ; for I carried about 
£40 in such toys and trifles as the captain directed me to buy. 
This £40 I had mustered together by the assistance of some 
of my relations whom I corresponded with ; and who, I be- 
lieve, got my father, or at least my mother, to contribute so 
much as that to my first adventure. 

This was the only voyage which I may say was successful; 
for I brought home five pounds nine ounces of gold-dust for 
my adventure, which yielded me in London, at my return, 
almost £300, and this filled me with those aspiring thoughts 
which have since so completed my ruin. 

I was now set up for a Guinea trader ; and my friend, to 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 21 

my great misfortune, dying soon after his arrival, I resolved 
to go the same voyage again, and I embarked in the same 
vessel with one who was his mate in the former voyage, and 
had now got the command of the ship. This was the unhap- 
piest voyage that ever man made ; for though I did not carry 
quite £100 of my new-gained wealth, so that I had £200 left, 
which I had lodged with my friend's widow, who was very 
just to me, yet I fell into terrible misfortunes ; the first was 
this — our ship making her course towards the Canary Islands, 
or rather between those Islands and the African shore, was 
surprised in the grey of the morning by a Turkish rover of 
Sallee, who gave chase to us with all the sail she could make. 
We crowded also as much canvas as our yards would spread, 
or our masts carry to get clear ; but, finding the pirate gained 
upon us, and would certainly come up with us in a few hours, 
we prepared to fight ; our ship having twelve guns, and the 
rogue eighteen. About three in the afternoon he came up 
with us, and bringing to, by mistake, just athwart our quarter, 
instead of athwart our stern, as he intended, we brought eight 
of our guns to bear on that side, and poured in a broadside 
upon him, which made him sheer off' again, after returning 
our fire, and pouring in also his small shot from near two 
hundred men which he had on board. However, we had not 
a man touched, all our men keeping close. He prepared to 
attack us again, and we to defend ourselves ; but laying us 
on board the next time upon our other quarter, ho entered 
sixty men upon our decks, who immediately fell to cutting 
and hacking the sails and rigging. We plied them with small 
shot, half pikes, powder chests, and such like, and cleared our 
deck of them twice ; but our ship being disabled, and three 
of our men killed and eight wounded, we were obliged to 
yield, and were carried all prisoners into Sallee, a port be- 
longing to the Moors. ; 

The usage I had there was not so dreadful as at first I appre- 
hended ; I was kept by the captain of the rover as his proper 
prize, and made his slave, being young and nimble, and fit for 
his business. At this surprising change of my circumstances, 
from a merchant to a miserable slave, I was perfectly over- 
whelmed ; and now I looked back upon my father's prophetic 
discourse to me, that I should be miserable and have none to 
relieve me, which I thought was now so effectually brought to 



22 Ronixsox chusoe. 

pass, that I could not be worse; but, alas! this was but a 
taste of the misery I was to go through, as will appear in the 
sequel of this story. 

As my master had taken me home to his house, so I was in 
hopes that he would take me with him when he went to sea 
again, believing that it would some time or other be his fate 
to be taken by a Spanish or Portugal man-of-war ; and that 
then I should be set at liberty. But this hope of mine was 
soon taken away ; for when he went to sea, he left me on 
shore to look after his little garden, and do the common 
drudgery of slaves about his house ; and when he came home 
again from his cruise, he ordered me to lie in the cabin to 
look after the ship. 

Hero I meditated nothing but my escape, and what method 
I might take to effect it, but found no way that had the least 
probability in it ; so that for two years, though I often pleased 
myself with the imagination, yet I never had the least en- 
couraging prospect of putting it in practice. 

After about two years, an odd circumstance presented 
itself, which put the old thought of making some attempt for 
my liberty again in my head. My patron lying at home 
longer than usual without fitting out his ship, he used, con- 
stantly, once or twice a week, sometimes oftener, if the weather 
was fair, to take the ship's pinnace, and go out into the road 
a-fishing ; and, as he always took me and young Maresco with 
him to row tha boat, we made him very merry, and I proved 
very dexterous in catching fish ; insomuch that sometimes 
he would send me with a Moor, one of his kinsmen, and the 
youth — the Maresco, as they called him, to catch a dish of 
!;■.!) for him. 

It happened one time, that going a-fishing in a calm morn- 
ing, a fog rose so thick that, though we were not half a league 
from the shore, we lost sight of it ; and rowing we knew not 
whither or which way, we laboured all day, and all the next 
night, and when the morning came, we found we had pulled 
oft' to sea instead of pulling in for the shore ; and that we 
were at least two leagues from the shore. However, wo got 
well in again, though with a great deal of labour and some 
danger. 

But our patron, warned by this disaster, resolved to take 
more care of himself for the future; and having lying by him 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 23 

the long-boat of our English ship that he had taken, he re- 
solved he would not go a-fishing any more without a compass 
and some provision ; so he ordered the carpenter of his ship 
to build a little state-room, or cabin, in the middle of the 
long-boat, like that of a barge, with a place to stand behind 
it to steer, and haul home the main-sheet ; and room before 
for a hand or two to stand and work the sails. The cabin 
lay very snug and low, and had in it room for him to lie, with 
a slave or two, and a table to eat on, wich some small lockers 
to put in some bottles of liquor, and his bread, rice, and 
coffee. 

We went frequently out with this boat a-fishing, and as I 
was most dexterous to catch fish for him, he never went with- 
out me. It happened that he had appointed to go out in this 
boat with two or three Moors of some distinction in that 
place, and for whom he had provided extraordinai'ily. and had 
therefore sent on board the boat over-night a larger store of 
provisions than ordinary ; and had ordered me to get ready 
three fusees with powder and shot, which wore on board his 
ship, for that they designed some sport of fowling as well as 
fishing. 

I got all things ready as he had directed, and waited the 
next morning ; when by-and-by my patron came on board 
alone, and told me his guests had put off going, from some 
business that fell out, and ordered me, with the man and boy, 
as usual, to go out with the boat and catch them some fish, 
for that his friends were to sup at his house ; and commanded 
that as soon as I o;ot some fish I should brinsf it home to his 
house : all which I prepared to do. 

This moment, my former notions of deliverance darted into 
tnv thoughts, for now I found I was likely to have a little 
ship at my command : and my master being gone, I prepared 
to furnish myself, not for fishing business, but for a voyage; 
though I knew not, neither did I so much as consider, whuher 
T. should steer — anywhere to get out of that place was my 
desire. 

My first contrivance was to speak to this Moor, to get 
something f Jr our subsistence on board ; so he brought a 
large basket of rusk or biscuit, and three jars of fresh water, 
into the boat. I knew where my patron's case of bottles 
tsooi.1. and I conveyed them into the boat while the Moor 



24 



ROEINSON CRUSOE. 



was on shore, as if they had been there before for our master. 
I conveyed also a great lump of bees-wax into the boat, which 
weighed above half a hundredweight, with a parcel of twine 
or thread, a hatchet, a saw, and a hammer, all of which were 
of great use to us afterwards, especially the wax to make 
candles. Another trick I tried upon him, which he innocently 
came into also : his name was Ismael, which they call Muley, 
Or Moely; so I called to him: — "Moely," said I, "our 
patron's guns are on board the boat; can you notget a 
little powder and shot? It may be we may kill some 
alcamies (a fowl like our curlews) for ourselves, for I know he 
keeps the gunner's stores in the ship." Accordingly he brought 
a great leather pouch, which held a pound and a half of pow- 
der, and another with shot, that had five or six pounds, with 
some bullets, and put all into the boat. At the same time, I 
had found some powder of my master's in the great cabin, 
with which I filled one of the large bottles in the case ; and 
thus furnished with everything needful, we sailed out of the 
port to fish*. 

After we had fished some time and caught nothing, for 
when I had fish on my hook I would not pull them up, that 
he might not see them, I said to the Moor, "This will not 
do ; our master will not be thus served ; we must stand 
farther off." He, thinking no harm, agreed, and set the sails ; 
and, as I had the helm, I run the boat out near a league 
farther, and then brought her to ; when, giving the boy the 
helm, I stepped forward to where the Moor was, and making 
as if I stooped for something behind him, I took him by sur- 
prise with my arm under his waist, and tossed him clear over- 
board into the sea. He rose immediately, for he swam like a 
cork, and begging to be taken in, told me he would go all 
over the world with me. He swam so strong after the boat, 
that he would have reached mo very quickly, upon which I 
stepped into the cabin, and fetching one of the fowling-pieces, 
I presented it at him, and told him I had done him no hurt, 
and if he would be quiet I would do him none. " But," said 
I, " if you come near the boat, I'll shoot you through the 
head, for I am resolved to have my liberty ;" so he turned 
himself about, and swam for the shore, and I make no doubt 
but he reached it with ease, for he was an excellent swimmer. 

When he was gone, I turned to the boy, whom they called 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 



Xury, and said to him, " Xury, if you will be fuithful to me, 
I'll make you a great man ; but if you will not stroke your 
face to be true to me," that is, swear by Mahomet and his 
father's beard, " I must throw you into the sea too." The 




Pago 42. 

boy smiled in my face, and spoke so innocently, that I could 
not distrust him, and swore to be faithful to mo, and go all 
over the world with me. 

While the Moor was swimming, I stood out directly to sea 
with the boat, rather stretching to windward, that they might 



2C i;oi;iXaON cgusoe. 

think me gone towards the Straits' mouth (as indeed anyone 
that had been in their wits must have been supposed to. do) ; 
for who would have supposed we were sailed on to the south- 
ward, where whole nations of negroes were sure to surround 
us with their canoes, and destroy us ; where we could not go 
on shore but we should be devoured by savage beasts, or more 
merciless savages of human kind? 

But as soon as it grew dusk in the evening, I changed my 
course, and steered directly south and by east ; and having a 
fresh gale of wind, and a smooth sea, I made such sail that I 
believe by the next day at three o'clock in the afternoon, 
when I first made the laud, I could not be less than one hun- 
dred and fifty miles south of Sallee. 

The wind continued fair till I had sailed in that manner 
five days ; and then the wind shifting to the southward, I 
concluded also that if any of our vessels were in chase of me, 
they would now give over ; so I ventured to make to the 
coast, and came to an anchor in the mouth of a little river, I 
knew not what, or where ; I neither saw, or desired to see, 
any people ; the principal thing I wanted was fresh water. 
We came into this creek in the evening, resolving to swim on 
shore as soon as it was dark, and discover the country ; but 
as soon as it was quite dark, we heard such dreadful noises of 
the barking, roaring, and howling of wild creatures, of we 
knew not what kinds, that the poor boy was ready to die 
with fear, and begged of me not to go on shore till day. 
"'Well, Xury," said I, "then I won't ; but it may be we may see 
men by day who will be as bad to us as those lions." — " Then 
w r e give them the shoot gun," says Xury, laughing, " make 
them run wey." I was glad to see the boy so cheerful, and 
I gave him a dram to cheer him up ; and we dropped our 
little anchor, and lay still all night ; I say still, for we slept 
none ; for in two or three hours we saw vast great creatures, 
of many sorts, come down to the sea-shore and run into the 
w r ater, wallowing and washing for the pleasure of cooling 
themselves ; and they made such hideous howlings and yell- 
ings, that I never indeed heard the like. 

Xury was dreadfully frighted, and indeed so was I too ; but 
wo were both more frighted when we heard one of these 
mighty creatures come swimming towards our boat; we could 
not see him, but we might hear him by his blowing to be a 



EOBINSON CKUSOE. 2.1 

monstrous huge and furious beast. Xury said it was a lion, 
and cried to me to weigh anchor and row away : "~Ko," says 
I, " Xury ; we can slip our cable, with the buoy to it, and go 
off to sea ; they cannot follow us far." I had no sooner said 
so, but I perceived the creature within two oars' length ; how- 
ever, I immediately fired at him, upon which he turned about, 
and swam towards the shore again. 

But it is impossible to describe the horrid noises, and hide- 
ous cries and bowlings, that were raised upon the report of 
the gun. This convinced me that there was no going on 
shore for us in the night on that coast, and how to venture on 
shore in the day was another question too ; for to have fallen 
into the hands of any of the savages had been as bad as to 
have fallen into the hands of lions and tigers. 

Be that as it would, we were obliged to go on shore some- 
•where or other for water, for we had not a pint left in the 
boat. Xury said, if I would let him go on shore with one of 
the jars, he would find if there was any water, ami bring- 
some to me. I asked him why he would go ? The boy 
answered with so much affection as made me love him ever 
after. " If wild mans come, they eat me, you go wey." — • 
" Well, Xury," said I, " we will both go, and if the wild 
mans come, we will kill them, they shall eat neither of 
us." So we hauled the boat in near the shore, and waded 
on shore, carrying nothing but our arms, and two jars for 
water. 

I did not care to go out of sight of the boat, fearing the 
coming of canoes with savages down the river ; but the boy 
seeing a low place about a mile up the country, rambled to it, 
and by-and-by I saw him come running towards me. I 
thought he was pursued by some savage, or frighted with 
some wild beast, and I ran forwards to help him ; but when 
I came nearer to him, I saw something hanging over his 
shoulders, which was a creature that he had shot, like a hare ; 
it was very good meat ; but the great joy that poor Xury 
came with, was to tell me he had found good water, and seen 
no wild mans. 

But we found afterwards that we need not take such pains 
for water, for a little higher up the creek we found the water 
fie.:!) when the tide was out, so we filled our jars, and feasted 
on the hare we had killed, and prepared to go on our way, 



28 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

having seen no footsteps of any human creature in that part 
of the country. 

I had no instruments to take an observation to know what 
latitude we were in ; but my hope was, that if I stood along 
this coast till I came to that part where the English traded, I 
should find some of their vessels that would relieve and take 
us in. 

We made on to the southward continually for ten or twelve 
days, living very sparingly on our provisions, which began to 
abate very much, and going no oftener to the shore than we 
were obliged for fresh water. My design in this was, to make 
the Kiver Gambia or Senegal, that is to say, anywhere about 
the Cape de Verd, where I was in hopes to meet with some 
European ship. 

When I had pursued this resolution about ten days longer, 
I began to see that the land was inhabited ; and, in two or 
three places, as we sailed by, we saw people stand upon the 
shore to look at us ; we could also perceive they were quite 
black, and naked. I was once inclined to have gone on shore 
to them ; but Xury said to me, " No go, no go." However, 
I hauled in nearer the shore that I might talk to them, and I 
found they ran along the shore by me a good way : I observed 
they had no weapons in their hands, except one, who had a 
long slender stick, which Xury said was a lance, and that 
they could throw them a great way with good aim ; so I kept 
at a distance, but talked with them by signs as well as I 
could ; and particularly made signs for something to eat ; they 
beckoned to me to stop my boat, and they would fetch me 
some meat. Upon this, I lowered the top of my sail, and lay 
by, and two of them ran up into the country, and in less than 
half an hour came back, and brought with them two pieces of 
dry flesh and some corn. We were willing to accept it ; but 
how to come at it was our next dispute, for I would not ven- 
ture on shore to them, and they were as much afraid of us : 
but they took a safe way for us all, for they brought it to the 
shore and laid it down, and went and stood a great way off 
till we fetched it on board, and then came close to us again. 

We made signs of thanks to them, for we had nothing to 
make them amends; but an opportunity offered that very in- 
stant to oblige them wonderfully : for while we were lying 
by the shore, came two mighty creatures with great fury from 



KOEINSON CUTJSOE. 29 

the mountains towards the sea. The man that had the lance 
or dart did not fly from them, but the rest did ; however, as 
tlie two creatures ran directly into the water, they did not 
offer to fall upon any of the negroes, but plunged themselves 
into the sea, and swam about, as if they had come for their 
diversion : at last one of them began to come nearer our boat 
than at first I expected ; but I lay ready for him, for I had 
loaded my gun with all possible expedition, and bade Xury 
load both the others. As soon as he came fairly within my 
reach, I fired, and shot him directly in the head : he imme- 
diately made to the shore, but died just before he reached it. 

It is impossible to express the astonishment of these poor 
creatures at the noise and fire of my gun ; some of them 
were ready to die for fear, and fell down as dead with the 
very terror ; but when they saw the creature dead, and that 
I made signs to them to come to the shore, they took heart 
and came, and began to search for the creature. By the help 
of a rope, which I slung round him, and gave the negroes to 
haul, they dragged him on shore, and found that it was a 
most curious leopard, spotted, and fine to an admirable degree. 

The other creature, frighted with the noise of the gun, 
swam on shore, and ran up directly to the mountains whence 
they came. I found quickly the negroes wished to eat the 
flesh of this creature, so I was willing to have them take it as 
a favour from me. They offered me some of the flesh, which 
I declined, pointing out that I would give it them ; but made 
signs for the skin, which they gave me very freely, and 
brought me a great deal more of their provisions. I then 
made signs to them for some water, and held out one of my 
jars to them, turning it bottom upward, to show that it was 
empty, and that I wanted to have it filled. They called im- 
mediately to some of their friends, and there came two women, 
and brought a great vessel ; this they set down to me, as 
before, and I sent Xury on shore with my jars, and filled 
them all three. 

I was now furnished with roots, corn, and water; and 
leaving my friendly negroes, I made forward for about eleven 
days more, without offering to go near the shore. At length, 
doubling the point, I saw plainly land on the other side, to 
seaward : then I concluded that this w r as the Cape de Verd, 
and those the islands, called, from thence, Cape de Verd

Islamic. However, tl;ey were at a great distance, and I could 
not tell well what I had best to do ; for if I should be t.ktu 
with a fresh of wind, I might neither reach one or other. 

In this dilemma, as I was very pensive, I stepped into the 
cabin, and sat down, Xury having the helm ; when, on a 
sudden, the boy cried out, "Master, master, a ship with a 
sail !" and the foolish boy was frighted out of his wits, think- 
ing it must be some of his master's ships sent to pursue us, 
but I knew we were far enough out of their reach. Ijumped 
out of the cabin, and immediately saw that it was a Portu- 
guese ship. 

With all the sail I could make, I found I should not be able 
to come in their way, but that they would be gone by before 
I could make any signal to them ; but after I had crowded to 
the utmost, and began to despair, they, it seems, saw, by the 
help of their glasses, that it was some European boat ; so 
they shortened sail to let me come up. I was encouraged 
with this, and made them a signal of distress, and fired a gun, 
both which they saw. Upon these signals they very kindly 
brought to, and lay by for me • and in about three hours' 
time I came up with them. 

They asked me what I was, in Portuguese, and in Spanish, 
and in French, but I understood none of them ; but, at la*t, 
a Scots sailor, who was on board, called to me ; and I answered 
him, and told him I was an Englishman, that I had made my 
escape out of slavery from the Moors, at Sallee ; they then 
bade me come on board, and very kindly took me in, and all 
my goods. 

It was an inexpressible joy to me that I was thus delivered 
from such a miserable and almost hopeless condition ; and I 
immediately offered all I had to the captain of the ship, as a 
return for my deliverance ; but he generously told me he 
would take nothing from me, but that all I had should bo de- 
livered safe to me, when I came to the Brazils. " Xo, no," 
says he, " Seignor Inglese, I will carry you thither in charity, 
and those things will help to buy your subsistence there, and 
your passage home again." 

In this proposal he was just in the performance to a tittle ; 
for he ordered the seamen, that none should touch anything 
that I had : then he took everything into his own possesion, 
and -gave me back an exact inventory of them. 



HOEIXSOX CfiUSCE. CI 

My boat was a very good one ; and ho told mo he would 
buy it. I- told him, he had been \o generous to me that I 
could not offer to make any price of the boat, but left it 
entirely to him : upon which he told me he would live me a 
note of hand to pay me eighty pieces of eight for it. He 
offered me also sixty pieces of eight more for my boy Xury ; 
but I was very loath to sell the poor boy's liberty, who had 
assisted me so faithfully in procuring my own. However, 
when I let him know my reason, he owned it to be just, and 
offered that he would set him free in ten years, if he turned 
Christian : upon this, and Xury saying he was willing to go 
to him, I let the captain have him. 

We had a very good voyage to the Brazils, and I arrived in 
All Saints' Bay, in about twenty-two days after. And now 
I was once more delivered from the most miserable of all con- 
ditions of life; and what to do next with myself I was to 
consider. 

The generous treatment the captain gave me I can never 
enough remember : he would take nothing of mo for my 
passage, gave me twenty ducats for the leopard's skin, and 
forty for the lion's skin, and caused everything I had in the 
ship to be punctually delivered to me ; and what I was will- 
ing to sell he bought of me : in a word, I made about two 
hundred and twenty pieces of eight of all my cargo ; and 
with this stock I went on shore in the Brazils. 

I had not been long here before I was recommended to the 
house of a good honest man, who had a plantation and suga.'- 
bouse. I lived with him some time, and acquainted myself 
with the manner of planting and making of sugar; and seeing 
how well the planters lived, and how they got rich suddenly, 
I resolved, if I could get a licence to settle there, 1 would 
turn planter : resolving, in the meantime, to find out some 
way to got my money, which I had left in London, remitted 
to me. To this purpose, getting a letter of naturalization, 1 
purchased as much land as my money would reach, and formed- 
a plan for my plantation and settlement suitable to the stock 
which I proposed to myself to receive from England. 

I had a neighbour, a Portuguese, of Lisbon, but born of 
English parents, whose name was Wells, and in much such 
circumstances as I was. My stock was low, as well as his ; 
and v. - e rather planted for food than anything else, for about 



*j2 KOEINSON CRUSOE. 

two years. However, we began to increase, and our land 
began to come into order ; so that the third year we planted 
some tobacco, and made each of us a large piece of ground 
ready for planting canes in the year to come : but we both 
wanted help ; and now I found I had done wrong in parting 
with Xury. 

But I had no remedy but to go on : I had got into an em- 
ployment quite remote to my genius, and directly contrary to 
the life I delighted in, and for which I forsook my father's 
house, and broke through all his good advice. 

I had nobocby to converse with, but now and then this 
neighbour ; no work to be done, but by the labour of my 
hands ; and I used to say, I lived just like a man cast away 
upon some desolate island, that had nobody there but himself. 

I was, in some degree, settled in my measures for carrying 
on the plantation, before my kind friend the captain went 
back ; for the ship remained there nearly three months ; when, 
telling him what little stock I had left behind me in London, 
ho gave me this friendly and sincere advice : — " Seignor In- 
glese," says he (for so lie always called me), " if you Mill 
give me letters to the person who has your money in London, 
to send your effects to Lisbon, to such persons as I shall direct, 
and in such goods as are proper for this country, I will bring 
you the produce of them : but I would have you give orders 
but for one hundred pounds sterling, which, you say, is half 
your stock, and let the hazard be run for the first ; so that if 
it come safe, you may order the rest the same way ; and, if it 
miscarry, you may have the other half to have recourse to for 
your supply." 

This was so wholesome advice, and looked so friendly, that 
I could not but be convinced it was the best course I could 
take ; so I prepared letters to the gentlewoman with whom I 
had left my money, and a procuration to the Portuguese 
captain, as he desired. 

I wrote the English captain's widow a full account of all 
my adventures, and what condition I was now in, with all 
other necessary directions for my supply ; and when this 
honest captain came to Lisbon, he found means to send over, 
not the order only, but a full account of my story to a mer- 
chant at London, who represented it effectually to her : where- 
upon she not only delivered the money, but, out of her own

pocket, sent the Portugal captain a very handsome present 
ior his humanity and charity.

directly to him at Lisbon, and he brought them all safe to me 
to the Brazils : among which he had taken care to have all 
sorts of tools, iron work, and utensils, necessary for m*.- plan- 
tation, and which were of great use to me. 

When this cargo arrived, I thought my fortunes made, for 
I was surprised with the joy of it ; and my good steward, the 
captain, had laid out the five pounds, which my friend had 
sent him for a present for himself, to purchase and bring me 
over a servant, under bond for six years' service, and would 
not accept of any consideration, except a little tobacco, which 
I would have him accept, being of my own produce. 

Neither was this all ; for my goods being all English manu- 
facture, particularly valuable in the country, I found means to 
sell them to a very great advantage ; so that I had more than 
four times the value of my first cargo, and was now infinitely 
beyond my poor neighbour in the advancement of my plan- 
tation ; for the first thing I did I bought a negro slave, and 
a European servant also, besides that which the captain 
brought me from Lisbon. 

I went on the next year with great success in my planta- 
tion; I raised fifty great rolls of tobacco on my own ground, 
more than I had disposed of for necessaries among my neigh- 
bours , and these fifty rolls, being each of above a hundred 
weight, were well cured, and laid by against the return of the 
fleet from Lisbon; and now increasing in business and in 
wealth, my head began to be full of projects and undertakings 
beyond my reach. 

To come, then, by the just degrees, to the particulars oi 
this part of my story : — You may suppose that having now 
lived almost four years in the Brazils, and beginning to thrive 
and prosper very well upon my plantation, I had not only 
learned the language, but had contracted acquaintance and 
friendship among my fellow-planters, as well as among the 
merchants at St. Salvador, which was our port ; and that, in 
my discourses among them, I had frequently given them an 
account of my two voyages to the coast of Guinea ; the 
manner of trading with the negroes there, and how easy it 
was to purchase upon the coast for trifles — such as beads, 
toys, knives, scissors, hatchets, bits of glass, and the like — 
not only gold dust, Guinea grains, elephants' teeth, S:c, but 
negroes, for the service of the Brazils, in great numbers. 



EOBINSON CRUSOE. So 

They listened always very attentively to my discourses on 
these heads, but especially to that part which related to the 
buying negroes ; which was a trade, at that time, not only 
not far entered into, but, as far as it was, had been carried on 
by the permission of the Kings of Spain and Portugal, and 
engrossed in the public stock ; so that few negroes were 
bought, and those excessively dear. 

It happened, being in company with some merchants and 
planters of my acquaintance, and talking of those things very 
earnestly, three of them came to me the next morning, and 
told me they had been musing very much upon what I had 
discoursed with them of the last night, and they came to 
make a secret proposal to me ; and, after enjoining me secrecy, 
they told me that they had a mind to fit out a ship to Guinea; 
that they had all plantations as well as I, and were straitened 
for nothing so much as servants ; that as it was a trade that 
could not be carried on, because they could not publicly sell 
the negroes when they came home, so they desired to make 
but one voyage, to bring the negroes on shore privately, and 
divide them among their own plantations ; and, in a word, 
the question was, whether I would go their supercargo in the 
ship, to manage the trading part upon the coast of Guinea ; 
and they offered me that I should have my equal share of the 
negroes, without providing any part of the stock. 

This was a fair proposal, had it been made to any one that 
had not had a settlement and a plantation of his own to look 
after, which was in a fair way of coming to be very consider- 
able, and with a good stock upon it. But for me, that was 
thus entered and established, and had nothing to do but to 
go on as I had begun, for three or four years more, and to 
have sent for the other hundred pounds from England ; and 
who in that time could scarce have failed of being worth three 
or four thousand pounds sterling, and that increasing too — 
for me to think of such a voyage was the most preposterous 
thing that ever man in such circumstances could be guilty of. 

But I, that was born to be my own destroyer, could no 
more resist the offer than I could restrain my first rambling 
designs. In a word, I told them I would go with all my 
heart, if they would undertake to look after my plantation in 
my absence, and would dispose of it to such as I should direct, 
if I miscarried. This they all entered into covenants to do ; 



36 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

and I made a formal will, disposing of my plantation and 
effects, in case of my death, making the captain of the ship 
that had saved my life my heir, but obliging him to dispose 
of my effects ; one-half of the produce being to himself, and 
the other to be shipped in England. 

In short, I took all possible caution to preserve my effects, 
and to keep up my plantation : had I used half as much pru- 
dence to have looked into my own interest, I had certainly 
never gone away from so prosperous an undertaking, upon a 
voyage to sea, attended with all its common hazards, to say 
nothing of particular misfortunes to myself. 

But I was hurried on, and obeyed blindly the dictates of 
my fancy rather than my reason ; and accordingly, the ship 
being fitted out, the cargo furnished, and all things done, as 
by agreement, by my partners in the voyage, I went on board 
in an evil hour, the 1st of September, 1659, being the same 
day eight years that I went from my father and mother at 
Hull. 

Our ship was about one hundred and twenty tons burden, 
carried six guns and fourteen men, besides the master, his 
boy, and myself ; we had on board no large cargo of goods, 
except of such toys as were fit for our trade with the negroes, 
such as beads, bits of glass, shells, and other trifles, especially 
little looking-glasses, knives, scissors, hatchets, and the like. 

The same day I went on board we set sail, standing away 
to the northward upon our own coast, with a design to stretch 
over for the African coast. We had very good weather till 
we came to the height of Cape St. Augustino ; whence, keep- 
ing farther off at sea, we lost eight of land, and steered as if 
we were bound for the isle Fernando de Noronha. In this 
course we passed the line in about twelve days' time, when a 
violent tornado, or hurricane, took us quite out of our know- 
ledge. It blew in such a terrible manner, that for twelve 
days together we could do nothing but drive, and, scudding 
away before it, let it carry us whither ever fate and the fury 
of the winds directed. 

In this distress we had, besides the terror of the storm, one 
of our men die of the calenture, and one man and the boy 
washed overboard. About the twelfth day, the weather 
abating a little, the master made an observation as well as he 
could, and found that he was upon the coast of Guiana, and 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 37 

began to consult with me what course he should take, for the 
ship was leaky, and very much disabled, and he was going 
directly back to the coast of Brazil. 

I was positively against that ; and looking over the charts 
of the sea-coast of America with him, we concluded there 
was no inhabited country for us to have recourse to, till we 
came within the circle of the Carribbee Islands, and therefore 
resolved to stand away for Barbadoes ; which, by keeping off 
at sea, to avoid the in-draft of the bay or gulf of Mexico, we 
might easily perform, as we hoped, in about fifteen days' sail ; 
whereas we could not possibly make our voyage to the coast 
of Africa without some assistance both to our ship and to 
ourselves. 

With this design, we changed our course, in order to reach 
some of our English islands, where I hoped for relief; but 
our voyage was otherwise determined ; for a second storm 
came upon us, which carried us away with the same impetu- 
osity westward, and drove us so out of the way of all human 
commerce, that had all our lives been saved as to the sea, we 
were rather in danger of being devoured by savages, than 
ever returning to our own country. 

In this distress, the wind still blowing very hard, one of our 
men early in the morning cried out, " Land !" and we had no 
sooner run out of the cabin to look out, in hopes of seeing 
whereabouts in the world we were, than the ship struck upon 
a sand, and in a moment the sea broke over in such a manner 
that we expected we should all have perished ; and we were 
immediately driven into our close quarters, to shelter us from 
the very foam and spray of the sea. 

It is not easy for anyone who has not been in the like con- 
dition to describe or conceive the consternation of men in 
such circumstances. We knew not where we were, or upon 
what land we were driven ; and as the rage of the wind was 
still great, we could not hope to have the ship hold many 
minutes without breaking into pieces, unless the winds, by a 
kind of miracle, should turn immediately about. In a word, 
we sat looking upon one another, and expecting death every 
moment, every man preparing for another world ; for there 
was little or nothing more for us to do in this ; but, contrary 
to our expectation, the ship did not break yet, and the master 
said the wind began to abate. 



38 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

Nov/, though we thought that the wind did a little abate, 
yet the ship having thus struck upon the sand, and sticking 
too fast for us to expect her getting oft', we were in a dreadful 
condition indeed, and had nothing to do but to think of 
saving our lives as well as we could. We had a boat at our 
stern just before the storm, but she was first staved by dashing 
against the ship's rudder, and, in the next place, she broke 
away, and either sunk or was driven off to sea ; so there was 
no hope from her. We had another boat on board, but how 
to get her off into the sea was a doubtful thing ; however, there 
was no time to debate, for we fancied the ship would break 
in pieces every minute, and some told us she was actually 
broken already. 

In this distress, the mate of our vessel Laid hold of the 
boat, and with the help of the rest of the men, got her slung 
over the ship's side ; and getting all into her, let go, and com- 
mitted ourselves, being eleven in number, to God's mercy 
and the wild sea. 

And now our case was very dismal indeed ; for we all saw 
plainly, that the sea went so high, that the boat could not 
live, and that we should be inevitably drowned. As to 
making sail, we had none ; so we worked at the oar towards 
the land, though with heavy hearts, like men going to execu- 
tion ; for we all knew that when the boat came nearer the 
shore, she would be dashed in a thousand pieces by the breach 
of the sea. However, we committed our souls to God in the 
most earnest manner ; and the wind driving us towards the 
shore, we hastened our destruction with our own hands, pull- 
ing as well as we could towards land. 

After we had rowed or rather driven about a league and a 
half, as we reckoned it, a raging wave, mountain-like, came 
rolling astern of us with such fury, that it overset the boat at 
once ; and separating us, as well from the boat as from one 
another, gave us not time to say, <■' O God!" for we were all 
swallowed up in a moment. 

Nothing can describe the confusion of thought which I felt, 
when I sank into the water : for though I swam very well, 
yet I could not deliver myself from the waves so as to draw 
breath, till that wave having driven me, or rather carried me, 
a vast way on towards the shore, and having spent itself, 
went back, and left me upon the land almost dry, but half 



ROBIXSOX CRUSOE. 39 

dead with the water I took in. i had so much presence of 
mind, as well as breath left, that seeing myself nearer the 
main land than I expected, I got upon my feet, and endea- 
voured to make on towards the land as fast as I could, before 
another wave should return and take me up again : but I soon 
found it was impossible to avoid it; for I saw the sea come 
after me as high as a great hill, and as furious as an 
enemy, which I had no means or strength to contend with : 
my business was to hold my breath, and raise myself upon 
the water, if I could : and so, by swimming, to preserve my 
breathing and pilot myself towards the shore, if possible, my 
greatest concern now being, that the sea, as it would carry 
me a great way towards the shore when it came on, might not 
carry me back again with it when it gave back towards the sea. 

The wave that came upon me again, buried me at once 
twenty or thirty feet deep in its own body, and I could feel 
myself carried with a mighty force and swiftness towards the 
shore a very great way ; but I held my breath, and assisted 
myself to swim still forward with all my might. I was ready 
to burst with holding my breath, when, as I felt myself raising 
up, so, to my immediate relief, I found my head and hands 
shoot out above the surface of the water ; and though it was 
not two seconds of time that I could keep myself so, yet it 
relieved greatly, gave me breath and new courage. I was 
covered again with water a good while, but not so long but I 
held it out ; and finding the water had spent itself, and began 
to return, I struck forward against the return of the waves, 
and felt ground again with my feet. I stood still a few mo- 
ments, to recover breath, and till the waters went from me, 
and then took to my heels and ran, with what strength I had, 
farther towards the shore. But neither would this deliver 
me from the fury of the sea, which came pouring in after me 
again ; and twice more I was lifted up by the waves and car- 
ried forwards as before, the shore being very fiat. 

The last time of those two had well nigh been fatal to me ; 
for the sea having hurried me along, as before, landed me, or 
rather dashed me, against a piece of a rock, and that with 
such force, as left me senseless, and indeed helpless, as to my 
own deliverance ; for the blow taking my side and breast, 
beat the breath, as it were, quite out of my body ; and had it 
returned again immediatclv, I must have been strangled in 



40 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

the water : but I recovered a little before the return of the 
waves, and seeing I should be covered again with the water, 
I resolved to hold fast by a piece of the rock, and so to hold 
my breath, if possible, till the wave went back. Now, as the 
waves were not so high as at first, being nearer land, I held 
my hold till the wave abated, and then fetched another run, 
which brought me so near the shore, that the next wave, 
though it went over me, yet did not so swallow me up as 
to carry me away ; and the next run I took, I got to the 
main land ; where, to my great comfort, I clambered up the 
cliffs of the shore, and sat me down upon the grass, free from 
danger, and quite out of the reach of the water. 

I was now landed, and safe on shore, and began to look up 
and thank God that my life was saved, in a case wherein 
there was, some minutes before, scarce any room to hope. I 
believe it is impossible to express, to the life, what the ecstasies 
and transports of the soul are, when it is so saved, as I may 
say, out of the very grave. 

I walked about on the shore, lifting up my hands ; and my 
whole being, as I may say, wrapt up in a contemplation of 
my deliverance ; making a thousand gestures and motions, 
which I cannot describe ; reflecting upon all my comrades 
that were drowned, and that there should not be one soul 
saved but myself ; for, as for them, I never saw them after- 
wards, or any sign of them, except three of their hats, one 
cap, and two shoes that w r ere not fellows. 

I cast my eyes to the stranded vessel, when, the breach and 
froth of the sea being so big, I could hardly see it, it lay 
so far off ; and considered, Lord ! how was it possible I could 
get on shore ? 

After I had solaced my mind with the comfortable part of 
my condition, I began to look round me, to see what kind of 
place I was in, and what was next to be done : and I soon 
found my comforts abate, and that I had a dreadful de- 
liverance : for I was wet, had no clothes to shift me, nor any- 
thing either to eat or drink ; neither did I see any prospect 
before me, but that of perishing with hunger, or being de- 
voured by wild beasts : and that which was particularly 
afflicting to me was, that I had no weapon, either to hunt 
and kill any creature for my sustenance, or to defend myself 
against any other creature that might desire to kill me for 



EOB1NSON CRUSOE. 41 

theirs. In a word, I had nothing about mo but a knife, a 
tobacco-pipe, and a little tobacco in a box. This was all _ my 
provision ; and this threw me into terrible agonies of mind, 
that, for a while, I ran about like a madman. Night coming 




page 54. 



upon me, I began, with a heavy heart, to consider what would 
be my lot if there were any ravenous beasts in that couritry, 
as at night they always come abroad for their prey. 

All the remedy that offered to my thoughts, at that time, 
was to get up into a thick bushy tree, like a fir, but thorny, 



42 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

which grew near me, and where I resolved to sit all night, and 
consider the next day what death I should die, for as yet I 
saw no prospect of life. I walked about a furlong from the 
shore, to see if I could find any fresh water to drink, which I 
did to my great joy; and having drunk, and put a little to- 
bacco in my mouth to prevent hunger, I went to the tree, and 
getting up into it, endeavoured to place myself so as that, if 
I should sleep, I might not fall. And having cut a short 
stick, like a truncheon, for my defence, I took up my lodging ; 
and having been excessively fatigued, I fell fast asleep, and 
slept as comfortably as, I believe, few could have done in my 
condition, and found myself more refreshed with it than I 
think I ever was on such an occasion. 

When I waked it was broad day, the weather clear, and 
the storm abated, so that the sea did not rago and swell as 
before ; but that which surprised me most was, that the ship 
was lifted off in the night from the sand where she lay, by 
the swelling of the tide, and was driven up almost as far as 
the rock, where I had been so bruised by the wave dashing 
me against it. This being within about a mile from the shore 
where I was, and the ship seeming to stand upright still, I 
wished myself on board, that at least I might save some neces- 
sary things for my use. 

When I came down from the tree, I looked about me again, 
and the first thing I found was the boat, which lay, as the 
wind and sea had tossed her up, upon the land, about two 
miles on my right hand. I walked as far as I could upon the 
shore to have got to her ; but found a neck, or inlet, of water 
between me and the boat, which was about half a mile broad ; 
so I came back for the present, being more intent upon getting 
at the ship, where I hoped to find something for my present 
subsistence. 

A little after noon I found the sea very calm, and the tide 
ebbed so far out, that I could come within a quarter of a mile 
of the ship. And here I found a fresh renewing of my grief, 
for I saw that if we had kept on board, we had been all safe : 
that is to say, Ave had all got safe on shore, and I had not 
been so miserable as to be left entirely destitute of all comfort 
and company, as I now was. This forced tears to my eyes 
again; but I resolved, if possible, to get to the ship ; so I 
pulled off my clothes, and took the water. But when I came 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 43 

to the ship, ray difficulty was still greater to know how to get 
on board ; for, as she lay aground, and high out of the water, 
there was nothing within my reach to lay hold of. I swam 
round her twice, and the second time I spied a small piece of 
rope, which hung down by the fore-chains so low, that with 
great difficulty I got hold of it, and by the help of that rope 
I got up into the forecastle of the ship. Here I found that 
the ship was bulged, and had a great deal of water in her 
hold ; but that she lay so on the side of a bank of hard sand, 
that her stern lay lifted up upon the bank, and her head low, 
almost to the water. By this means all her quarter was free, 
and all that was in that part was dry. First, I found that all 
the ship's provisions were untouched by the water. I also 
found some rum in the great cabin, Now I wanted nothing 
but a boat, to furnish myself with many things which I fore- 
saw would be very necessary to me. 

Wo had several spare yards, and two or three large spars of 
wood, and a spare top-mast or two in the ship : I resolved to 
fall to work with these, and I flung as many of them overboard 
as I could manage for their weight, tying every one with a 
rope, that they might not drive away. When this was done, 
I went down the ship's side and pulling them to me, I tied 
four of them together at both ends, as well as I could, in the 
form of a raft, and laying two or three short pieces of plank 
upon them, cross-ways, I found I could walk upon it very well, 
but that it was not able to bear any great weight, the pieces 
being too light. So I went to work, and with the carpenter's 
saw I cut a spare top-mast into three lengths, and added them 
to my raft, with a great deal of labour and pains. But the 
hope of furnishing myself with necessaries, encouraged me to 
go beyond what I should have been able to have done upon 
another occasion. 

My raft was now strong enough to bear any reasonable weight. 
My next care was what to load it with, and how to preserve 
what I laid upon it from the surf of the sea : but I was not 
long considering this. I first laid all the plank or boards upon 
it that I could get, and having considered well what I most 
wanted, I got three of the seamen's chests, which I had broken 
open and emptied, and lowered them down upon my raft ; the 
first of these I filled with bread, rice, three Dutch cheeses, five 
pieces of dried goat's flesh, and a little European corn. As 



44 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

for liquors, I found several cases of bottles belonging to our 
skipper, in which were some cordial waters ; and, in all, about 
five or six gallons of rack. These I stowed by themselves, 
there being no need to put them into the chest, nor any room 
for them. It was after long searching that I found out the 
carpenter's chest, which was indeed a very useful prize to me, 
and much more valuable than a ship-lading of gold would have 
been at that time. I got it down to my raft, whole as it was, 
without losing time to look into it, for I knew in general 
what it contained. 

My next care was for some ammunition and arms. There 
were two very good fowling-pieces in the great cabin, and two 
pistols. These I secured first, with some powder-horns and a 
small bag of shot, and two old rusty swords. There were 
three barrels of powder in the ship, but I knew not where our 
gunner had stowed them ; but with much search I found two 
of them dry and good. Those two I got to my raft, with the 
arms. And now I thought myself pretty well freighted, and 
began to think how I should get to shore with them, having 
neither sail, oar, or rudder ; and the least cap-full of wind 
would have overset all my navigation. 

I had three encouragements : 1st, a smooth, calm sea ; 
2ndly, the tide rising and setting in to the shore ; 3rdly, what 
little wind there was blew me towards the land. And thus, 
having found two or three broken oars belonging to the boat, 
and besides the tools which were in the chest, two saws, an 
axe, and a hammer ; with this cargo I put to sea. For a mile, 
or thereabouts, my raft went very well, only that I found it 
drive a little distant from the place where I had landed before ; 
by which I perceived that there was some indraft of the water, 
and consequently, I hoped to find some creek or river there, 
■which I might make use of as a port to get to land with my cargo. 

As I imagined, so it was. There appeared before me a 
little opening of the land, and I found a strong current of the 
tide set into it ; so I guided my raft, as well as I could, to 
keep in the middle of the stream. 

But here I had like to have suffered a second shipwreck, 
which, if I had, I think, verily, would have broke my heart ; 
for, knowing nothing of the coast, my raft ran aground at one 
end of it upon a shoal, and not being aground at the other end, 
it wanted but a little that all my cargo had slipped off towards 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 45 

the end that was afloat, and so fallen into the water. I did 
my utmost, by setting my back against the chests, to keep 
them in their places, but could not thrust off the raft with all 
my strength ; neither durst I stir from the posture I was in : 
but holding up the chests with all my might, I stood in that 
manner near half an hour, in which time the rising of the water 
brought me a little more upon a level ; and, a little after, the 
water still rising, my raft floated again, and I thrust her off 
with the oar I had into the channel, and then driving up 
higher, I at length found myself in the mouth of a little river, 
with land on both sides, and a strong current running up. I 
looked on both sides for a proper place to get to shore, resolved 
to place myself as near the coast as I could. 

At length I spied a little cove on the right shore of the creek, 
to which, with great pain and difficulty, I guided my raft, and 
at last got so near, that reaching ground with my oar, I could 
thrust her directly in. But here I had like to have dipped all 
my cargo into the sea again ; for that shore lying pretty steep 
— there was no place to land, but where one end of my float, 
if it ran on shore, would lie so high, and the other sink lower, 
as before, that it would endanger my cargo again. All that I 
could do, was to wait till the tide was at the highest, keeping 
the raft with my oar like an anchor, to hold the side of it fast 
to the shore, near a flat piece of ground, which I expected 
the water would flow over ; and so it did. As soon as I found 
water enough, I thrust her on upon that flat piece of ground, 
and there moored her, by sticking my two broken oars into 
the ground, — one on one side, near one end, and one on the 
other side, near the other end ; and thus I lay till the water 
ebbed away, and left my raft and all my cargo safe on shore. 

My next work was to view the country, and seek a proper 
place for my habitation, and where to stow my goods, to secure 
them from whatever might happen. Where I was, I yet knew 
not : whether on the continent or an island ; whether inhabited 
or not inhabited ; whether in danger of wild beasts or not. 
There was a hill not above a mile from me, which rose up very 
steep and high, and which seemed to overtop some other hills, 
which lay as in a ridge from it, northward. I took out one 
of the fowling-pieces, and one of the pistols, and a horn of 
powder ; and thus armed, I travelled for discovery up to the 
top of that hill, where, after I had with great labour and 



46 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

difficulty got to the top, I saw my fato, to my great affliction, 
viz., that I was in an island environo 1 on every side by the 
sea : no land to be seen except some rocks, which lay a great 
way off, and two small islands, less than this, which lay about 
three leagues to the west. 

I found also that the island I was in was barren, and 
uninhabited. Yet I saw abundance of fowls, but knew not 
their kinds, neither, when I killed them, could I tell what was 
fit for food, and what not. At my coming back I shot at a 
great bird, which I saw sitting upon a tree, on the side of a 
wood. I believe it was the first gun that had been fired there 
since, the creation of the world. I had no sooner fired, than 
from all parts of the wood there arose an innumerable number 
of fowls, of many sorts, making a confused screaming and 
crying, every one according to his usual note, but not one of 
them of any kind that I knew. As for the creature I killed, 
I took it to be a kind of a hawk, its colour and beak resembling 
it, but it had no talons or claws more than common. Its flesh 
was carrion, and fit for nothing. 

Contented with this discovery, I came back to my raft, and 
fell to work to bring my cargo on shore, which took me up the 
rest of that day : what to do with myself at night I knew not, 
nor indeed where to rest, for I was afraid to lie down on the 
ground, not knowing but some wild beast might devour me. 

However, as well as I could, I barricaded myself round with 
the chests and boards that I had brought on shore, and made 
a kind of hut for that night's lodging. As for food, I yet saw 
not which way to supply myself, except that I had seen two 
or three creatures, like hares, run out of the wood where I shot 
the fowl. 

I now began to consider that I might yet get a great many 
things out of the ship, which would be useful to me, and 
particularly some of the rigging and sails, and such other things 
as might come to land ; and I resolved to make another voyage 
on board the vessel, if possible. And as I knew that the first 
storm that blew must necessarily break her all in pieces, I 
resolved to set all other things apart, till I had got everything 
out of the ship that I could get. 

I got on board the ship as before, and prepared a second 
raft ; and, having had experience of the first, I neither made 
this so unwieldy, nor loaded it so hard, I brought away several 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 47 

things very useful to me ; as, first, in the carpenter's stores, 
I found two or three bags full of nails and spikes, a great screw- 
jack, a dozen or two of hatchets, and, above all, that most 
useful thing called a grindstone. All these I secured, together 
with several things belonging to the gunner; particularly two 
or three iron crows, and two barrels of musket bullets, seven 
muskets, and another fowling-piece, with some small quantity 
of powder more ; a large bagful of small shot, and a great roll 
of sheet-lead ; but this last was so heavy I could not hoist it 
up to get it over the ship's side. 

Besides these things, I took all the men's clothes that I could 
find, and a spare fore-top sail, a hammock, and some bedding ; 
and with this I loaded my second raft, and brought them all 
safe on shore, to my very great comfort. 

I was under some apprehension during my absence from the 
land, that at least my provisions might be devoured on shore: 
but when I came back, I found no sign of any visitor; only 
there sat a creature like a wild cat, upon one of the chests, 
which, when I came towards it, ran away a little distance, and 
then stood still. She sat very composed and unconcerned, and 
looked full in my face, as if she had a mind to be acquainted 
with me. I presented my gun to her, but, as she did not 
nunderstad it, she was perfectly unconcerned at it, nor did she 
offer to stir away ; upon which I tossed her a bit of biscuit, 
though, by the way, I was not very free of it : however, I 
spared her a bit, and she ate it, and looked (as if pleased) for 
more ; but I thanked her, and could spare no more : so she 
marched off. 

Having got my second cargo on shore — though I was 
obliged to open the barrels of powder, and bring them by 
parcels, for they were too heavy, being large casks — I went 
to work to make me a little tent, with the sail, and some poles 
which I cut for that purpose : and into this tent I brought 
everything that I knew would spoil either with rain or sun ; 
and I piled all the empty chests and casks up in a circle round 
the tent, to fortify it from any sudden attempt, either from 
man or beast. 

When I had done this, I blocked up the door of the tent 
with some boards within, and an empty chest set up on end 
without ; and spreading one of the beds upon the ground, 
laying my two pistols just at my head, and my gun at length 



48 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

by me, I went to bed for the first time, and slept very quietly 
all night, for I was very weary and heavy. 

I had the bi^est magazine of all kinds now that ever was 
laid up, I believe, for one man ; for while the ship sat upright, 
I got everything out of her that I could : so every day, at 
low water, I went on board, and brought away something or 
other ; but particularly the third time I went, I brought away 
as much of the rigging as I could, as also all the small ropes 
and rope twine I could get, with a piece of spare canvas, 
which was to mend the sails upon occasion, and the barrel of 
wet gunpowder. 

But that which comforted me more still, was, last of all, 
after I had made five or six voyages, and thou^it I had no- 
thing more to expect from the ship that was worth my med- 
dling with, I found a great hogshead of bread, three large 
runlets of rum, or spirits, a box of sugar, and a barrel of fine 
flour. I soon emptied the hogshead of the bread, and wrapped 
it up, parcel by parcel, in pieces of the sails, which I cut out, 
and got all this safe on shore also. 

The next day I made another voyage, and now, having 
plundered the ship of what was portable and fit to hand out, 
I began with the cables, cutting the great cable into pieces, 
such as I could move, I got two cables and a hawser on shore, 
with all the iron-work I could get ; and having cut down the 
spritsail-yard, and the mizen-yard, and everything I could, to 
make a large raft, I loaded it with all these heavy goods, and 
came away ; but my good luck began now to leave me ; for 
this raft was so unwieldy, and so overladen, that after I was 
entered the little cove, where I had landed the rest of my 
goods, not being able to guide it so handily as I did the other, 
it overset, and threw me and all my cargo into the water ; my 
cargo was a great part of it lost, especially the iron, which I 
expected would have been of great use to me : however, when 
the tide was out, I got most of the pieces of cable ashore, and 
some of the iron, though with infinite labour. After this, I 
went every day on board, and brought away what I could get. 

I had been now thirteen days on shore, and had been eleven 
times on board the ship ; but preparing the twelfth time to go 
on board, I found the wind began to rise : however, at low 
water I went on board, and though I thought I had rum- 
maged the cabin so effectually that nothing more could be

found, yet I discovered a locker with drawers in it, in one of 
■which I found two or three razors, and one pair of large 
scissors, with some ten or a dozen of good knives and forks ; 
in another I found about thirty-six pounds value in money — 




some European coin, some Brazil, some pieces of eight, some 
gold, and some silver. 

I smiled to myself at the sight of this money : " O drug !" 

said I aloud, " what art thou good for ? Thou art not worth 

to me — no, not the taking off the ground : one of those 

knives is worth all this heap : I have no manner of use for

thee ; e'en remain where thou art, and go to the bottom, as a 
creature whoso life is not worth saving'." However, upon 
second thoughts, T took it away ; and wrapping all in a piece 
of canvas, I began to think of making another raft : but 
while I was preparing this, I found the sky overcast, and the 
•wind began to rise, and in a quarter of an hour it blew a 
fresh gaie from the shore. It presently occurred to me, that 
it wasin vain to pretend to make a raft with the wind off 
shore ; and that it was my business to be gone before the tide 
of flood began, otherwise I might not be able to reach the 
shore at all. Accordingly, I let myself down into the water, 
and swam across the channel which lay between the ship and 
the sands, and even that with difficulty enough, partly with 
the weight of the things I had about me, and partly from the 
roughness of the water. 

But I had got home to my little tent, where I lay, with all 
my wealth about me very secure. It blew very hard all that 
night, and in the morning, when I looked out, behold no more 
ship was to be seen ! 

My thoughts were now wholly employed about securing 
myself against either savages, if any should appear, or wild 
beasts, if any were in the island ; and I had many thoughts 
of the method how to do this, and what kind of dwelling to 
make — whether I should make me a cave in or a tent upon 
the earth ; and, in short, I resolved upon both ; the manner 
and description of which, it may not be improper to give an 
account of. 

I soon found the place I was in was not fit for my settle- 
ment, because it was upon a low, moorish ground, near the 
sea, and I believed it would not be wholesome, and more par- 
ticularly because there was no fresh water near it ; so I re- 
solved to find a more healthy and more convenient spot of 
ground. 

I consulted several things in my situation : ] st, health and 
fresh water ; 2ndly, shelter from the heat of the sun ; 3rdly, 
security from ravenous creatures, whether men or beasts ; 
4thly, a view to the sea, that if Grod sent any ship in sight, I 
might not lose any advantage for my deliverance. 

In search of a place proper for this, I found a little plain 
on the side of a rising hill, whose front towards this little 
plain was steep as a house-side, so that nothing could come 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 51 

down upon me from the top. On the side of the rock there 
was a hollow place, worn a little way in, like the entrance or 
door of a cave ; but there was not really any cave, or way 
into the rock, at all. 

On the flat of the green, just before this hollow place, 
I resolved to pitch my tent. This plain was not above a hun- 
dred yards broad, and about twice as long, and lay like a 
green before my door ; and, at the end of it, descended 
irregularly every way down into the low ground by the sea- 
side. It was on the>N.N.W side of the hill ; so that it was shel- 
tered from the heat every day, till it came to a W and by S. sun, 
or thereabouts, which, in those countries, is near the setting. 

Before I set up my tent, I drew a half-circle before the 
hollow place, which took in about ten yards in its semi-diameter, 
from the rock, and twenty yards in its diameter from its 
beginning and ending. 

In this half-circle I pitched two rows of strong stakes, 
driving them into the ground till they stood very firm like piles, 
the bia^est end beins out of the around above five feet and 
a half, and sharpened on the top. The two rows did not stand 
above six inches from one another. 

Then I took the pieces of cable which I had cut in the ship, 
and laid them in rows, one upon another, within the circle, 
between these two rows of stakes, up to the top, placing other 
stakes in the inside, leaning against thcin, about two feet and 
a half high, like a spur to a post ; and this fence was so strong, 
that neither man nor beast could get into it or over it. This 
cost me a great deal of time and labour, especially to cut the 
piles in the woods, bring them to the place, and drive them 
into the earth. 

The entrance into this place I made to be, 1 not by a door, but 
by a short ladder to go over the top ; which ladder, when I 
was in, I lifted over after me ; and so I was completely fenced 
in and fortified, as I thought, from all the world, and con- 
sequently slept secure in the night, which otherwise I could 
not have done ; though, as it appeared afterwards, there was 
no need of all this caution from the enemies that I apprehended 
danger from. 

Into this fence, or fortress, with infinite labour, I carried all 
my riches, all my provisions, ammunition, and stores, of which 
you have the account above ; and I made a large tent, which, 



OZ ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

to preserve me from the rains, that in one part of the year are 
very violent there, I made double, one smaller tent within,^ and 
one larger tent above it; and covered the uppermost with a 
large tarpaulin, which I had saved among the sails. 

And now I lay no more for a while in the bed which I had 
brought on shore, but in a hammock, which had belonged to 
the mate of the ship. 

Into this tent I brought all my provisions, and everything 
that would spoil by the wet ; and having thus enclosed all my 
goods, I made up the entrance, which till now I had left open, 
and so passed and repassed, as I said, by a short ladder. 

When I had done this, I began to work my way into the 
rock, and bringing all the earth and stones that I dug down 
out through my tent, I laid them up within my fence, in the 
nature of a terrace, so that it raised the ground within about a 
foot and a half ; and thus I made me a cave, just behind my 
tent, which served me like a cellar to my house. 

It cost me much labour and many days before all these 
things were brought to perfection ; and therefore I must go 
back to some other things which took up some of my thoughts. 
At the same time it happened, after I had laid my scheme for 
the setting up my tent, and making the cave, that a storm of 
rain falling from a thick, dark cloud, a sudden flash of lightning 
happened, and after that, a great clap of thunder, as is 
naturally the effect of it. I was not so much surprised with 
the lightning, as I was with a thought which darted into my 
mind as swift as the lightning itself : my powder ! My very 
heart sank within me when I thought that, at one blast, all my 
powder might be destroyed ; on which, not my defence only, 
but the providing me food, as I thought, entirely depended. 
I was nothing near so anxious about my own danger, though, 
had the powder took fire, I should never have known who had 
hurt me. 

Such impression did this make npon me, that after the storm 
was over, I laid aside all my works, my building and fortifying, 
and applied myself to make bags and boxes, to separate the 
powder, and to keep it a little and a little in a parcel, in hope 
that whatever might come, it might not all take fire at once ; 
and to keep it so apart, that it should not be possible to make 
one part fire another. I finished this work in about a fortnight; 
and I think my powder, which in all was about two hundred 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. Oo 

and forty pounds weight, was divided into not less than a 
hundred parcels. As to the barrel that had been wet, I did 
not apprehend any danger from that ; so I placed it in my new 
cave, which, in my fancy, I called my kitchen ; and the rest I 
hid up and down in holes among the rocks, so that no wet 
might come to it, marking very carefully where I laid it. 

In the interval of time while this was doing, I went out 
once at least every day with my gun, as well to divert myself, 
as to see if I could kill anything fit for food ; and as near as I 
could, to acquaint myself with what the island produced. 
The first time I went out, I presently discovered that there 
were goats in the island, which was a great satisfaction to me ; 
but then it was attended with this misfortune to me, viz., that 
they were so shy, so subtle, and so swift of foot, that it was 
the difficultest thing in the world to come at them ; but I was 
not discouraged at this, not doubting but I might now and 
then shoot one, as it soon happened ; for after I had found 
their haunts a little, I laid wait in this manner for them : I 
observed that if they saw me in the valleys, though they were 
upon the rocks, they would run away, as in a terrible fright ; 
but if they were feeding in the valleys, and I was upon the 
rocks, they took no notice of me ; from whence I concluded, 
that by the position of their optics, their sight was so directed 
downward, that they did not readily see objects that were 
above them ; so afterwards, I took this method — I always 
climbed the rocks first, to get above them, and then had fre- 
quently a fair mark. 

The first shot I made among these creatures, I killed a she- 
goat, which had a little kid by her, which she gave suck to, 
which grieved me heartily ; for, when the old one fell, the kid 
stood stock still by her, till I came and took her up ; and not 
only so, but when I carried the old one with me, upon my 
shoulders, the kid followed me quite to my enclosure ; upon 
which, I laid down the dam, and took the kid in my arms, and 
carried it over my pale, in hopes to have bred it up tame ; but 
it would not eat ; so I was forced to kill it, and ate it myself. 
These two supplied me with flesh a great while, for I ate 
sparingly, and saved my provisions, my bread especially, as 
much as possibly I could. 

Having now fixed my habitation, I found it absolutely 
necessary to provide a place to make a fire in, and fuel to 



54 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

burn ; and what I did for that, as also how I enlarged my cave, 
and what conveniences I made, I shall give a full account of 
in its place; but I must now give some little account of myself, 
and of my thoughts about living, which, it may well be supposed, 
were not a few. 

And now being about to enter into a melancholy relation of a 
scene of silent life, such, perhaps, as was never heard of in the 
world before, I shall take it from its beginning, and continue 
it in its order. It was, by my account, the 30th of September, 
when I first set foot upon this horrid island ; when the sun 
being to us in its autumnal equinox, was almost just over my 
head : for I reckoned myself by observation, to be in the 
latitude of nine degrees twenty-two minutes north of the line. 

After I had been there about ten or twelve days, it came 
into my thoughts that I should lose my reckoning of time for 
want of books, and pen and ink, and should even forget the 
Sabbath days; but to prevent this, I cut with my knife upon 
a large post, in capital letters; and making it into a great 
cross, I set up on the shore where I first landed, " I came 
on shore here on the 30th of September, 1659." 

Upon the sides of this square post I cut every day a notch 
with my knife, and every seventh notch was as long again as 
the rest, and every first day of the month as long again as that 
long one; and thus I kept my calendar, or weekly, monthly, 
and yearly reckoning of time. 

In the next place we are to observe that among the many 
things I brought out of the ship, I got several things of less 
value, but not at all less useful to me, which I omitted setting 
down before, as pens, ink, and paper; several parcels in the 
captain's, mate's, gunner's, and carpenter's keeping; three or 
four compasses, some mathematical instruments, dials, perspec- 
tives, charts, and books of navigation ; all which I huddled 
together, whether I might want them or no ; also I found three 
very good Bibles, which came to me in my cargo from England, 
and which I had packed up among my things ; some Portu- 
guese books also; and several other books, all which I care- 
fully secured. And I must not forgot, that we had in the ship 
a dog, and two cats, of whose eminent history I may have 
occasion to say something in its place ; for I carried both the 
cats with me; and as for the dog, he jumped out of the ship 



ROBIXSON CRUSOE. 55 

of himself, and swam on shore to me the day after I went on 
shore with my first cargo, and was a trusty servant to me 
many years ; I wanted nothing that he could fetch me, nor any 
company that he could make up to mc ; I only wanted to have 
him talk to me, but that would not do. My pens, ink, and 
paper I husbanded to the utmost ; and while my ink lasted, 
I kept things very exact, but after that was gone I could not. 
for I could not make ink by any means that I could devise. 

And this put me in mind that I wanted many things, not- 
withstanding all that I had amassed together ; and of these, 
ink was one ; as also a spade, pick-axe, and shovel, to dig or 
remove the earth ; needles, pins, and thread : as for linen, I 
soon learned to want that without much difficulty. 

This want of tools made every work I did go on heavily; 
and it was near a whole year before I had entirely finished my 
little pale, or surrounded my habitation. The piles or stakes, 
which were as heavy as I could well lift, were a long time in 
cutting and preparing in the woods, and more, by far, in bring- 
ing home ; so that I spent sometimes two clays in cutting and 
bringing home one of these posts, and a third day in driving- 
it into the ground ; for which purpose, I got a heavy piece of 
wood at first, but at last bethought myself of one of the iron 
crows ; which, however, though I found it, made driving those 
posts or piles very laborious and tedious work. But what need 
I have been concerned at the tediousness of anything I had to 
do, seeing I had time enough to do it in ? nor had I any other 
employment, if that had been over, at least that I could foresee, 
except the ranging the island to sock for food, which I did, 
more or less every day. 

I now began to consider seriously my condition, and the 
circumstances I was reduced to; and I drew up the state of 
my affairs in writing, not so much to leave them to any that 
should come after me, for I was likely to have but few heirs, 
as to deliver my thoughts from daily poring upon them, and 
afilic-ting my mind : and as my reason began now to master 
my despondency, I began to comfort myself as well as I could, 
and to set the good against the evil, that I might have some- 
thing to distinguish my case from worse; and I stated very 
impartially, like debtor and creditor, the comforts I enjoyed 
against the miseries I suffered, thus : — 



56 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 



Evil. 

I am cast upon a horrible, 
desolate island, void of all 
hope of recovery. 

I am singled out and sepa- 
rated, as it were, from all the 
world, to be miserable. 



I am divided from mankind 
— a solitaire ; one banished 
from human society. 

I have not clothes to cover 
me. 

I am without any defence, 
or means to resist any vio- 
lence of man or beast. 



I have no soul to speak to, 
or relieve me. 



Good. 

But I am alive, and not 
drowned, as all my ship's com- 
pany were. 

But I am singled out, too, 
from all the ship's crew, to be 
spared from death; and He 
that miraculously saved me 
from death, can deliver me 
from this condition. 

But I am not starved, and 
perishing on a barren place, 
affording no sustenance. 

But I am in a hot climate, 
where, if I had clothes, I could 
hardly wear them. 

But I am cast on an island 
where I see no wild beasts to 
hurt me, as I saw on the coast 
of Africa ; and what if I had 
been shipwrecked there ? 

But God wonderfully sent 
the ship in near enough to the 
shore, that I have got out as 
many necessary things as will 
either supply my wanrs or 
enable me to supply myself, 
even as long as I live. 

Upon the whole, here was an undoubted testimony, that 
there was scarce any condition in the world so miserable, but 
there was something negative or positive to be thankful for 
in it. 

Having now brought my mind a little to relish my condition, 
and given over looking out to sea, to see if I could spy a ship, 
— I began to apply myself to arrange my way of living, and to 
make things as easy to me as I could. 

I have already described my habitation, which was a tent 
under the side of a rock, surrounded with a strong pale of 
posts and cables ; but I might now rather call it a wall, for I 
raised a kind of Avail up against it of turfs, about two feet 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 57 

thick on the outside : and after some time (I think it was a 
year and a half) I raised rafters from it, leaning to the rock, 
and thatched or covered it with boughs of trees, and such 
things as I could get, to keep out the rain ; which I found at 
some times of the year very violent. 




V^a "-i. 



I have already observed how I brought all my goods into 
the cave which I had made behind me. But I must observe* 
too, that at first this was a confused heap of goods, which as 
they lay in no order, so they took up all my place ; I had no 
room to turn myself; so I set myself to enlarge my cave, and 



58 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

work farther into the earth ; and when I found I was pretty 
safe as to beasts of prey, I worked sideways, to the right hand 
into the rock ; and then turning to the right again, worked 
quite out and made me a door to come out on the side of my 
pale or fortification. 

This gave me not only egress and regress, as it was a back- 
way to my tent and to my storehouse, but gave me room to 
store my goods. 

And now I began to apply myself to make such necessary 
things as I found I most wanted, particularly a chair and a 
table ; for without those I was not able to enjoy the few 
comforts I had in the world ; I could not write, or eat, or do 
several things with so much pleasure, without a table : so I 
went to work. And here I must needs observe, that as reason 
is the substance and origin of the mathematics, so by stating 
and squaring everything by reason, and by making the most 
rational judgment of things, every man may be, in time, master 
of every mccnamc art. I had never handled a tool in my life ; 
and yet, in time, by labour, application, and contrivance, I 
found, at last, that I wanted nothing but I could have made 
it, especially if I had had tools. However I made abundance 
of things, even without tools ; and some with no more tools 
than an adze and a hatchet, which perhaps were never made 
that way before, and that with infinite labour. For example, 
if I wanted a board, I had no other way but to cut down a tree, 
set it on an edge before me, and hew it flat on either side 
with my axe, till I had brought it to be as thin as a plank, and 
then dub it smooth with my adze. It is true that by this 
method I could make but one board out of a whole tree ; but 
this I had no remedy for but patience, any more than I 
had for the prodigious deal of time and labour which it took 
me up to make a plank or board : but my time or labour was 
little worth, and so it was as well employed one way as 
another. 

However, I made me a table and a chair, in the first place; 
and this I did out of the short pieces of boards that I brought 
on my raft from the ship, lint when I had wrought out some 
boards as above, I made large shelves, of the breadth of a foot 
and a half, one over another all along one side of my cave, to 
lay all my tools, nails, and iron-work on ; and, to separate 
everything into their places, that I might come easily at them. 



ROBIXSON CRUSOE. 59 

. I knocked pieces into the wall of the rock to hang my guns 
and all things that would hang up : so that my cave looked 
like a general magazine of all necessary things ; and I had 
everything so ready at my hand, that it was a great pleasure 
to me to see all my goods in such order, and especially to find 
my stock of all necessaries so great. 

Having settled my household stuff and habitation, made me 
a table and a chair, and all as handsome about me as I could, 
I began to keep my journal ; of which I shall here give you 
the copy (though in it will be told all these particulars over 
again) as long as it lasted ; for having no more ink, I was 
forced to leave it off. 

THE JOURNAL. 

September 30, 1659. — I, poor, miserable Robinson Crusoe, 
being shipwrecked during a dreadful storm, in the offing, 
came on shore on this dismal, unfortunate island, which I 
called " The Island of Despair;" all the rest of the ship's 
company being drowned, and myself almost dead. 

All the rest of the day I spent in afflicting myself at the 
dismal circumstances I was brought to, viz., I had neither food, 
house, clothes, weapon, nor place to fly to : and, in despair of 
any relief, saw nothing but death before me : either that I 
should be devoured by wild beasts, murdered by savages, or 
starved to death for want of food. At the approach of night 
I slept in a tree for fear of wild creatures ; but slept soundly, 
though it rained all night. 

October 1. — In the morning I saw, to my great surprise, the 
ship had floated with the high tide, and was driven on shore 
again, much nearer the island ; which as it was some comfort, 
on one hand, for seeing her sit upright, and not broken to 
pieces, I hoped if the wind abated, I might get on board, and 
get some food and necessaries out of her for my relief; so, on 
the other hand, it renewed my grief at the loss of my comrades, 
who, I imagined, if we had all stayed on board, might have 
saved the ship, or, at least, that they would not have been all 
drowned, as they were; and that, had the men been saved, we 
might perhaps have built us a boat, out of the ruins of the 
ship, to have carried us to some other part of the world. I 
spent great part of this day in perplexing myself on these 
things ; but, at length, seeing the ship almost dry, I went upon 



60 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

the sand as near as I could, and then swam on board. This 
day also it continued raining, though with no wind at all. 

From the 1st of October to the 24th. — All these days en- 
tirely spent in several voyages to get all I could out of the 
ship, which I brought on shore, every tide of flood, upon rafts. 
Much rain also in the days, though with some intervals of fair 
weather; but it seems this was the rainy season. 

Oct. 20. — I overset my raft, and all the goods I had got 
upon it; but being in shoal water, and the things being 
chiefly heavy, I recovered many of them when the tide was 
out. 

Oct. 25. — It rained all night and all day, with some gusts 
of wind ; during which time the ship broke in pieces, the wind 
blowing a little harder than before, and was no more to be 
seen, except the wreck of her, and that only at low water. I 
spent this day in covering and securing the goods which I had 
saved, that the rain might not spoil them. 

Oct. 26. — I walked about the shore almost all day, to find 
out a place to fix my habitation, greatly concerned to secure 
myself from any attack in the night, either from wild beasts 
or men. Towards night, I fixed upon a proper place, under a 
rock, and marked out my encampment ; which I resolved to 
strengthen with a work, wall, or fortification, made of double 
piles, lined within with cables, and without with turf. 

From the 26th to the 30th, I worked very hard in carrying 
all my goods to my new habitation, though some part of the 
time it rained exceedingly hard. 

The 31st in the morning, I went out into the island with my 
gun, to see for some food, and discover the country ; when I 
killed a she-goat, and her kid followed me home, which I 
afterwards killed also because it would not feed. 

November 1. — I set up my tent under a rock, and lay there 
for the first night ; making it as large as I could, with stakes 
driven in to swing my hammock upon. 

Nov. 2. — I set up all my chests and boards, and the pieces 
of timber which made my rafts, and with them formed a fence 
round me, a little within the place I had marked out for my 
fortification. 

Nov. 3. — I went out with my gun, and killed two fowls like 
ducks, which were very good food. In the afternoon went to 
work to make me a table. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 61 

Nov. 4. — This morning I began to order my times of work, 
of going out with my gun, time of sleep, and time of diversion ; 
viz., every morning I walked out with my gun for two or three 
hours, if it did not rain ; then employed myself to work till 
about eleven o'clock ; then ate what I had to live on ; and 
from twelve till two I lay down to sleep, the weather being 
excessively hot ; and then, in the evening to work again. The 
working part of this day and of the next were wholly em- 
ployed in making my table, for I was yet but a very sorry 
workman, though time and necessity made me a complete 
natural mechanic soon after, as I believe they would do any 
one else. 

Nov. 5. — This day, went abroad with my gun and my dog, 
and killed a wild cat ; her skin pretty soft, but her flesh good 
for nothing ; every creature that I killed I took off the skins 
and preserved them. Coming back by the sea-shore, I saw 
many sorts of sea-fowls, which I did not understand ; but was 
surprised, and almost frightened, with two or three seals, which, 
while I was gazing at, not well knowing what they were, got 
into the sea, and escaped me for that time. 

Nov. 6. — After my morning walk, I went to work with my 
table again, and finished it, though not to my liking ; nor was 
it long before I learned to mend it. 

Nov. 7. — Now it began to be settled fair weather. The 
7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, and part of the 12th (for the 11th was 
Sunday), I took wholly up to make me a chair, and with 
much ado brought it to a tolerable shape, but never to 
please me ; and even in the making I pulled it in pieces 
several times. 

Note. — I soon neglected my keeping Sundays ; for, omit- 
ting my mark for them on my post, I forgot which was which. 

Nov. 13. — This day it rained, which refreshed me exceed- 
ingly, and cooled the earth ; but it was accompanied with 
terrible thunder and lightning, which frighted me dreadfully, 
for fear of my powder. As soon as it was over, I resolved 
to separate my stock of powder into as many little parcels as 
possible, that it might not be in danger. 

Nov. 14, 15, 16. — These three days I spent in making little 
square chests, or boxes, which might hold about a pound, or 
two pounds at most, of powder; and so, putting the powder 
in, I stowed it in places as secure and remote from one 



C2 ROBINSOX CRUSOE. 

another as possible. On one of these three clays, I killed a 
large bird that was good to eat, but I knew not what to 
call it. 

Nov. 17. — This day I began to dig behind my tent into the 
rock, to make room for my further convenience. 

Note. — Three things I wanted exceedingly for this work, 
viz., a pickaxe, a shovel, and a wheelbarrow, or basket ; so I 
desisted from my work, and began to consider how to supply 
that want, and make me some tools. As for the pickaxe, I 
made use of the iron crows, which were proper enough, 
though heavy ; but the next thing was a shovel or spade ; 
this was so absolutely necessary, that, indeed, I could do 
nothing effectually without it ; but what kind of one to make 
I knew not. 

Nov. 18. — The next day, in searching the woods, I found a 
tree of that wood, or like it, which, in the Brazils, they call 
the iron-tree, for its exceeding hardness ; of this, with great 
labour, and almost spoiling my axe, I cut a piece, and brought 
it home, too, with difficulty enough, for it was exceeding 
heavy. The excessive hardness of the wood, and my having 
no other way, made me a long while upon this machine, for I 
•worked it effectually, by little and little, into the form of a 
shovel or spade ; the handle exactly shaped like ours in 
England, only that the board part having no iron shod upon 
it at bottom, it would not last me so long ; however, it 
served well enough for the uses which I had occasion to put 
it to. 

I was still deficient, for I wanted a basket, or a wheel- 
barrow. A basket I could not make by any means, having 
no such things as twigs that would bend to make wicker-ware 
— at least, none yet found out ; and as to a wheelbarrow, I 
fancied I could make all but the wheel ; but that I had no 
notion of; neither did I know how to go about it ; besides, I 
had no possible way to make the iron gudgeons for the spindle 
or axis of the wheel to run in ; so I pave it over, and so, for 
carrying away the earth which I dug out of the cave, I made 
me a thing like a hod, which the labourers carry mortar in, 
when they serve the bricklayers. This was not so difficult to 
me as the making the shovel ; and yet this and the shovel, and 
the attempt which I made in vain to make a wheelbarrow, took 
me up no less than four days. 



ROBIXSON CRUSOE. 63 

Nov. 23. — My other work having now stood still, because 
of my making these tools, when they were finished I went on, 
and working every day, as my strength and time allowed, I 
spent eighteen days entirely in widening and deepening my 
cave, that it might hold my goods commodiously. 

Note. — During all this time, I worked to make this room, or 
cave, spacious enough to accommodate me as a warehouse, or 
magazine, a kitchen, a dining-room, and a cellar. As for my 
lodging, I kept to the tent ; except that sometimes, in the wet 
season of the year, it rained so hard, that I could not keep 
myself dry, which caused me afterwards to cover all my place 
within my pale with long poles, in the form of rafters, leaning 
against the rock, and load them with flags and large leaves of 
trees, like a thatch. 

December 10. — I began to think my cave or vault finished, 
when on a sudden (it seems I had made it too largo) a great 
quantity of earth fell down from the top and one side; so 
much that it frighted me, and not without reason, too ; for if 
I had been under it, I had never wanted a grave-digger. I 
had now a great deal of work to do over again, for I had the 
loose earth to carry out : and, which was of more importance, 
I had the ceiling to prop up, so that I might be sure no more 
would come down. 

Dec. 11. — This day I went to work with it accordingly, and 
got tw-o shores or posts pitched upright to the top, with two 
pieces of boards across over each post ; this I finished the next 
day ; and setting more posts up with boards, in about a week 
more I had the roof secured ; and the posts, standing in rows, 
served me for partitions to part off the house. 

Dec. 17. — From this day to the 20th I placed shelves, and 
knocked up nails on the posts, to hang everything up that 
could be hung up ; and now I began to be in some order within 
doors. 

Dec 20. — Now I carried everything into the cave, and 
began to furnish my house, and set up some pieces of boards 
like a dresser, to order my victuals upon , but boards began 
to be very scarce with me : also I made me another table. 

Dec. 24. — Much rain all night and all day : no stirring out. 

Dec. 2.1. — Bain all day. 

Dec. 20. — No rain, and the earth much cooler than before, 
and pleasanter. 



C4 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

Dec. 27. — Killed a young goat, and lamed another so that 
I caught it, and led it home in a string ; when I had it at 
home, I bound and splintered up its leg, which was broken. 

N.B.— I took such care of it that it lived, and the leg grew 
well and as strong as ever : but by nursing it so long it grew 
tame, and fed upon the little green at my door, and would not 
go away. This was the first time that I entertained a thought 
of breeding up some tame creatures, that I might have food 
when my powder and shot was all spent. 

x Dec. 28, 29, 30, 31 Great heats, and no breeze, so that 

there was no stirring abroad, except in the evening, for 
fc-/d ; this time I spent in putting all my things in order 
within doors. 

January 1. — Very hot still ; but I went abroad early and 
late with my gun, and lay still in the middle of the day. This 
evening, goin^ farther into the valleys which lay towards the 
centre of the island, I found there were plenty of goats, though 
exceedingly shy, and hard to come at ; however, I resolved to 
try if I could not bring my dog to hunt them down. 

Jan. 2. — Accordingly, the next day I went out with my 
dog, and set him upon the goats ; but I was mistaken, for they 
all faced about upon the dog, and he knew his danger too well, 
for he would not come near them. 

Jan. 3. — I began my fence, or wall; which, being still 
jealous of my being attacked by somebody, I resolved to make 
very thick and strong. 

N.B. — This wall being described before, I purposely omit 
what was said in the journal ; it is sufficient to observe that I 
was no less time than from the 3rd of January to the 14th of 
April working, finishing, and perfecting this wall, though it 
was no more than about twenty-four yards in length, being a 
half-circle, from one place in the rock to another place, about 
eight yards from it, the door of the cave being in the centre 
behind it. 

All this time I worked very hard, the rains hindering me 
many days, nay, sometimes weeks, together ; but I thought I 
should never be perfectly secure till this wall was finished ; and 
it is scarcely credible what inexpressible labour everything was 
done with, especially the bringing piles out of the woods, and 
driving them into the ground ; for I made them much bi^er 
than I needed to have done. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 



65 



"When this wall was finished, and the outside double-fenced, 
with a turf wall raised up close to it, I persuaded myself that 
if any people were to come on shore there they would not 
perceive anything like a habitation ; and it was very well I did 




PAGE 102 



so, as may be observed hereafter, upon a very remarkable occa- 
sion. 

Daring this time I made my rounds in the woods for game 
every day, when the rain permitted me, and made frequent 
discoveries in these walks of something or other to my advan- 
5 



66 EOBINSON CRUSOE. 

iagc; particularly I found a kind of wild pigeons, which 
build, not as wood-pigeons in a tree, but rather as house- 
pigeons, in the holes of the rocks ; and taking some young 
ones, I endeavoured to breed them up tame, and did so ; but 
when they grew older they flew away, which perhaps was at 
first for want of feeding them, for I had nothing to give them ; 
however, I frequently found their nests, and got their young 
ones, which were very good meat. And now, in the managing 
my household affairs, I found myself wanting in many things, 
which I thought at first it was impossible for me to make ; as, 
indeed, with some of them it was : for instance, I couM. never 
make a cask to be hooped. I had a small runlet or two, as I 
observed before, but I could never arrive at the capacity of 
making one by them, though I spent many weeks about it ; I 
could neither put in the heads, or join the staves so true to 
one another as to make them hold water ; so I gave that also 
over. In the next place, I was at a great loss for candles ; so 
that as soon as ever it was dark, which was generally by seven 
o'clock, I was obliged to go to bed. I remembered the lump of 
bees'-wax with which I made candles in my African adventure ; 
but I had non& of that now ; the only remedy I had was, that 
when I had killed a goat I saved the tallow, and with., a little 
dish made of clay, which I baked in the sun, to which.! added 
a wick of some oakum, I made me a lamp ; and this gave me 
light, though not a clear steady light like- a candle. In the 
middle of all my labours it happened that, rummaging my 
things, I found a little bag, which had been filled with corn 
for the feeding of poultry. The little remainder of corn that 
had been in the bag was all devoured with the rats, and I saw 
nothing in the bag but husks send dust ; and being willing to 
have the bag for some other use, I shook the husks of corn out 
of it on one side of my fortification, under the rock. 

It was a little before the great rains just now mentioned 
that I threw this stuff away, taking no notice, and not so much 
as remembering that I had thrown anything there, when about 
a month after, or thereabouts, I saw some few stalks of some- 
thing green shooting out of the ground, which I fancied might 
bo some plant I had not seen ; but I was surprised, and per- 
fectly astonished, when, after a little longer time, I saw about 
ten or twelve ears come out, which were perfect green barley, 
of the same kind as our English barley. 



ROBINSON CIIUSOS. 67 

It is impossible to express the astonishment and confusion 
of my thoughts on this occasion ; I had hitherto acted upon 
no religious foundation at all ; indeed, I had very few notions 
of religion in my head, nor had entertained any sense of any- 
thing that had befallen me, otherwise than as chance, oi', as 
we lightly say, what pleases God, without so much as inquiring 
into the end of Providence in these things, or His order in 
governing events for the world. But after I saw barley grow 
there, in a climate which I knew was not proper for corn, and 
especially that I knew not how it came there, it startled me 
strangely, and I began to suggest that God had miraculously 
caused His grain to grow without any help of seed sown, and 
that it was so directed purely for my sustenance on that wild, 
miserable place. 

This touched my heart a little, and brought tears out of my 
eyes, and I began to bless myself that such a prodigy of 
nature should happen upon my account ; and this was the 
more strange to me, because I saw near it still, all along by 
the side of the rock, some other straggling stalks, which proved 
to be stalks of rice, and which I knew, because I had seen it 
grow in Africa, when I was ashore there. 

I not only thought these the pure productions of Providence 
for my support, but not doubting that there was more in the 
place, I went all over that part of the island where I had been 
before, peering in every corner, and under every rock, to see 
for more of it, but I could not find any. At last it occurred 
to my thoughts, that I shook a bag of chickens' meat out in 
that place, and then the wonder began to cease ; and I must 
confess, my religious thankfulness to God's providence began 
to abate, too, upon the discovering that all this was nothing 
but what was common ; though I ought to have been as 
thankful for so strange and unforeseen a providence, as if it 
had been miraculous ; for it was really the work of Provi- 
dence to me, that should order or appoint that ten or twelve 
grains of corn should remain unspoiled, when the rats had 
destroyed all the rest, as if it had been dropped from heaven ; 
as also, that I should throw it out in that particular place, 
where, it being in the shade of a high rock, it sprang up im- 
mediately ; whereas, if I had thrown it anywhere else, at that 
time, it had been burnt up and destroyed. 

I carefully saved the ears of this corn, you may be sure, in 



C8 ROBINSON CUU.SOE. 

their season, which was about the end of June ; and, laying 
up every corn, I resolved to sow them all again, hoping, m 
time, to have some quantity, sufficient to supply me with, 
bread. But it was not till the fourth year that I could allow 
myself the least grain of this corn to eat, and even then but 
sparingly, as I shall say afterwards, in its order ; for I lost all 
that I sowed the first season, by not observing the proper 
time ; for I sowed it just before the dry season, so that it 
never came up at all, at least not as it would have done: of 
which in its place. 

Besides this barley, there were, as above, twenty or thirty 
stalks of rice, which I preserved with the same care and for 
the same use, to make me bread, or rather food ; for I found 
ways to cook it without baking, though I did that also after 
some time. 

But to return to my Journal : 

I worked excessively hard these three or four months, to get 
my wall done ; and the 14th of April, I closed it up, contriv- 
ing to go into it, not by a door, but over the wall, by a ladder, 
that there might be no sign on the outside of my habitation. 

April 16. — I finished the ladder ; so I went up the ladder 
to the top, and then pulled it up after me, and let it down in 
the inside : this was a complete inclosure to me ; for within I 
had room enough, and nothing could come at me from with- 
out, unless it could first mount my wall. 

The very next day after this wall was finished, I had almost 
had all my labour overthrown at once, and myself killed ; the 
case was thus : — As I was busy in the inside, behind my tent, 
just at the entrance into my cave, I was terribly frighted with 
a most dreadful surprising thing indeed : for, all on a sudden, 
I found the earth come crumbling down from the roof of my 
cave, and from the edge of the hill over my head, and two of 
the posts I had set up in the cave cracked in a frightful man- 
ner. I was heartily scared ; thinking that the top of my cave 
was fallen in, as some of it had done before : and for fear I 
should be buried in it, I ran forward to my ladder, and not 
thinking myself safe there neither, I got over my wall for fear 
of the pieces of the hill, which I expected might roll down 
upon me. I had no sooner stepped down upon the firm 
ground, than I plainly saw it was a terrible earthquake ; for 
the ground I stood on shook three times at about ei°bt 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 69 

Tninutes' distance, with three such shocks as would have over- 
turned the strongest building that could be supposed to have 
stood on the earth, and a great piece of the top of a rock, 
which stood about half a mile from me, next the sea, fell 
down, with such a terrible noise as I never heard in all my 
life. I perceived also the very sea was put into violent motion 
by it ; and I believe the shocks were stronger under the water 
than on the island. 

I was so much amazed with the thing itself, having never felt 
the like, nor discoursed with anyone that had, that I was like 
one dead or stupified; and the motion of the earth made my 
stomach sick, like one that was tossed at sea; but the noise of 
the falling of the rock awaked me, as it were, and rousing me 
from the stupified condition I was in, filled me with horror, 
and I thought of nothing then but the hill falling upon my 
tent and all my household goods, and burying all at once ; and 
this sunk my very soul within me a second time. 

After the third shock was over, and I felt no more for some 
time, I began to take courage; and yet I had not heart enough 
to go over my wall again, for fear of being buried alive, but sat 
still upon the ground greatly cast down and disconsolate, not 
knowing what to do. All this while, I had not the least 
serious religious thought, nothing but the common "Lord have 
mercy upon me!" and when it was over, that went away too. 

While I sat thus, I found the air overcast, and grow cloudy, , 
as if it would rain ; soon after that, the wind arose by little and '. 
little, so that in less than half an hour it blew a most dreadful > > 
hurricane: the sea was, all on a sudden, covered over with foamf 
and froth ; the shore was covered with the breach of the water ; 
the trees were torn up by the roots; and a terrible storm it 
was. This held about three hours, and then began to abate; 
and in two hours more it was quite calm, and began to rain 
very hard. All this while I sat upon the ground, very much 
terrified and dejected ; when on a sudden it came into my 
thoughts, that these winds and rain being the consequences of 
the earthquake, the earthquake itself was spent and over, 
and I might venture into my cave again. With this thought, 
my spirits began to revive ; and the rain also helping to per- 
suade me, I went in and sat down in my tent ; but the rain 
was so violent, that my tent was ready to bo beaten down with 
it ; and I was forced to go into my cave, though very much 



70 ROBINSOX CRUSOE. 

afraid and uneasy, for fear it should fall on my head. This 
violent rain forced me to a new work, viz., to cut a hole through 
my new fortification, like a sink, to let the water go out, which 
would else have flooded my cave. After I had been in my 
cave for some time, and found still no more shocks of the earth- 
quake follow, I began to be more composed. And now to 
support my spirits, which indeed wanted it very much, I went 
to my little store and took a small sup of rum ; which, however, 
I did then and always very sparingly, knowing I could have 
no more when that was gone. It continued raining all that 
night, and great part of the next day, so that I could not stir 
abroad; but my mind being more composed, I began to think 
of what I had best do : concluding, that if the island was sub- 
ject to these earthquakes, there would be no living for me in a 
cave, but I must consider of building a little hut in an open 
place, which I might surround with a wall, as I had done here, 
and so make myself secure from wild beasts or men ; for I 
concluded if I stayed where I was, I should certainly, one time 
or other, be buried alive. 

With these thoughts I resolved to remove my tent from the 
place where it now stood, which was just under the hanging 
precipice of the hill; and which if it should be shaken again, 
would certainly fall upon my tent : and I spent the two next 
days, being the 19th and 20th of April, in contriving where 
and how to remove my habitation. The fear of being swal- 
lowed up alive made me that I never slept in quiet ; and yet 
the apprehension of lying abroad without any fence was almost 
equal to it : but still, when I looked about, and saw how every- 
thing was put in order, how pleasantly concealed I was, and 
how safe from danger, it made me very loath to remove. In 
the meantime, it occurred to me that it would require a vast 
deal of time for me to do this, and that I must be contented to 
venture where I was, till I had formed a camp for myself, and 
had secured it so as to remove to it. So with this resolution 
I composed myself for a time ; and resolved that I would go 
to work with all speed to build me a wall with piles and cables, 
&c, in a circle, as before, and set my tent up in it, when it 
was finished ; but that I would venture to stay where I was till 
it was finished and fit to remove. This was the 21st. 

April 22. — The next morning I began to consider of means 



HOBINSON CRUSOE. 71 

to put this resolve into execution ; but I was at a great loss 
about my tools. I had three large axes, and abundance of 
hatchets, but with much chopping and cutting knotty hard 
wood, they were all full of notches, and dull, and though I had 
a grindstone, I could not turn it and grind my tools too. 
This cost me as much thought as a statesman would have be- 
stowed upon a grand point of politics, or a judge upon the life 
and death of a man. At length I contrived a wheel with a 
string to turn it with my foot, that I might have both my hands 
at liberty. 

April 28, 29. — These two whole days I took up in grinding 
my tools, my machine for turning my grindstone performing 
very well. 

April 30. — Having perceived my bread had been low a 
great while, now I took a survey of it, and reduced myself to 
one biscuit a day, which made my heart very heavy. 

May 1. — In the morning, looking towards the sea side, the 
tide being low, I saw something lie on the shore bigger than 
ordinary, and it looked like a cask ; when I came to it, I found 
a small barrel, and two or three pieces of the wreck of the ship, 
which were driven on shore by the late hurricane ; and looking 
towards the wreck itself, I thought it seemed to lie higher out 
of the water than it used to do. I examined the barrel which 
was driven on shore, and soon found it was a barrel of gun- 
powder, but it had taken water, and the powder was caked as 
hard as a stone ; however, I rolled it farther on shore for the 
present, and went on upon the sands , as near as I could to the 
wreck of the ship to look for more. 

When I came down to the ship, I found it strangely re- 
moved. The forecastle, which lay before buried in sand, was 
heaved up at least six feet, and the stern, which was broke in 
pieces and purtde from the rest by the force of the sea, soon 
after I had left rummaging her, was tossed, as it were, up, and 
cast on one side ; and the sand was thrown so high on that 
side next her stern, that whereas there was a great place of 
water before, so that I could not come within a quarter of a 
mile of the wreck without swimming, I could now walk quite 
up to her when the tide was out. I was surprised with this 
at first, but soon concluded it must be done by the earthquake; 
and as by this violence the ship was more broke open than 



72 KOBINSON CRUSOE. 

formerly, so many things came daily on shore, which the sea 
had loosened, and which the winds and water rolled by degrees 
to the land. 

This wholly diverted my thoughts from the design of re- 
moving my habitation, and I busied myself mightily, that day 
especially, in searching whether I could make any way into 
the ship; but I found nothing was to be expected of that kind, 
for all the inside of the ship was choked up with sand. How- 
ever, as I had learned not to despair of anything, I resolved to 
pull everything to pieces that I could of the ship, con- 
cluding that everything I could get from her would be of some 
use or other to me. 

May 3. — I began with my saw, and cut a piece of a beam 
through, which I thought held some of the upper part or 
quarter deck together, and when I had cut it through, I 
cleared away the sand as well as I could from the side which 
lay highest : but the tide coming in, I was obliged to give 
over for that time. 

May 4. — I went a fishing, but caught not one fish that I 
durst eat of, till I was weary of my sport; when, just going to 
leave off, I caught a young dolphin. I had made me a long 
line of some rope-yarn, but I had no hooks ; yet I frequently 
caught fish enough, as much as I cared to eat; all which I dried 
in the sun, and ate them dry. 

May 5. — Worked on the wreck; cut another beam asunder, 
and brought three great fir-planks off from the decks, which I 
tied together, and made to float on shore when the tide of flood 
came on. 

May 6. — Worked on the wreck ; got several iron bolts out 
of her, and other pieces of iron-work ; worked very hard and 
came home very much tired, and had thoughts of giving it over. 

May 7. — Went to the wreck again, not with an intent to 
work, but found the weight of the wreck had broke itself 
down, the beams being cut; that several pieces of the ship 
seemed to lie loose, and the inside of the hold lay so open that 
I could see into it, but it was almost full of water and sand. 

May 8. — Went to the wreck, and carried an iron crow to 
wrench up the deck, which lay now quite clear of the water 
or sand. I wrenched open two planks, and brought them on 
shore also with the tide. I left the iron crow in the wreck for 
next clay. 



EOBINSON CRUSOE. 



73 



May 9. — Went to the wreck, and with the crow made way 
into the body of the wreck, and felt several casks, and loosened 
them with the crow, but could not break them up. I felt also 



\ POT s^ 




l'AQE 1C7. 

a roll of English lead, and could stir it, but it was too heavy 
to remove. 

May 10 — 14. — Went every day to the wreck; and got a 
great many pieces of timber and boards or plank, and two 
or three hundredweight of iron. 

May 15. — I carried two hatchets, to try if I could not cut a 



<4 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

piece off the roll of lead, by placing the edge of one hatchet, 
and driving it with the other; but as it lay about a foot and 
a half in the water, I could not make any blow to drive the 
hatchet. 

May 16. — It had blown hard in the night, and the wreck 
appeared more broken by the force of the water; but I stayed 
so long in the woods, to get pigeons for food, that the tide 
prevented my going to the wreck that day. 

May 17. — I saw some pieces of the wreck blown on shore, 
at a great distance, near two miles off me, but resolved to see 
what they were, and found it was a piece of the lead, but too 
heavy for me to bring away. 

May 24. — Every clay, to this day, I worked on the wreck; 
and with hard labour I loosened some things so much with 
the crow, that the first blowing tide several casks floated out, 
and two of the seamen's chests ; but the wind blowing from 
the shore, nothing came to land ihat day but pieces of timber, 
and a hogshead, wtt&i Ibai same Brazil pork in it, but the salt 
water and the sandiraflspiHeflit. I continued this work every 
day to the 15th of J^me, except lire USsme necessary to get food, 
which I always agapainited, during ibis jp»rt of my employment, 
to be when the fflfenEEs up, thait I anight be ready when it 
ebbed out; and by iMs time I had got timber and plank, and 
iron-work, enough *to have built a good boat, if I had known 
how; and also I got at several times, and in severaljieces, near 
one hundred-wsigbt of the sheet-lead. 

June 16. — <Gramg down to the sea-side, I founfl a large 
tortoise, or tur#e. TMs was the first I had seen, winch, it 
seems, was ordymy misfortune, not any defect of the jalace, or 
scarcity; for had I Hnajpaaefl to be on the other side of the 
island, I might have had Sramdreds of them every day, as I 
found afterwards; but perhaps had paid dear enough for 
them. 

June 17. — I spent in cooking the turtle. I found in her 
three score eggs; and her flesh was to me, at that time, the 
most savoury and pleasant that ever I tasted in my life, having 
had no flesh, but of goats and fowls, since I landed in this 
horrid place. 

June 18. — Rained all day, and I stayed within. I thought, 
at this time, the rain felt cold, and I was something chilly ; 
which I knew was not usual in that latitude. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 75 

June 19. — Very ill and shivering, as if the weather had 
been cold. 

June 20. — No rest all night; violent pains in my head, and 
feverish. 

June 21. — Very ill ; frighted almost to death with the 
apprehension of my sad condition — to be sick, and no help; 
prayed to God, for the first time since the storm off Hull, but 
scarce knew what I said, or why; my thoughts being all 
confused. 

June 22. — A little better ; but under dreadful apprehensions 
of sickness. 

June 23. — Very bad again ; cold and shivering, and then a 
violent headache. 

June 24. — Much better. 

June 25. — An ague very violent: the fit held me seven 
hours : cold fit, and hot, with faint sweats after it. 

June 26. — Better ; and having no victuals to eat, took my 
gun, but found myself very weak : however, I killed a she-goat, 
and with much difficulty got it home, and broiled some of it, 
and ate. I would fain have stewed it, and made some broth, 
but had no pot. 

June 27. — The ague again so violent that I lay a-bed all 
day, and neither ate nor drank. I was ready to perish for 
thirst ; but so weak, I had not strength to stand up, or to get 
myself any water to drink. Prayed to God again, but was 
light-headed ; and when I was not, I was so ignorant that I 
knew not what to say ; only I lay and cried, " Lord, look upon 
me! Lord, pity me! Lord, have mercy upon me!" I suppose 
I did nothing else for two or three hours ; till the fit wearing 
off, I fell asleep, and did not wake till far in the night. When 
I awoke, I found myself much refreshed, but weak and exceed- 
ing thirsty ; however, as I had no water in my habitation, I 
was forced to lie till morning, and went to sleep again. In 
this second sleep, I had this terrible dream : I thought that I 
was sitting on the ground, on the outside of my wall, where I 
sat when the storm blew after the earthquake, and that I saw 
a man descend from a great black cloud, in a bright flame of 
fire, and light upon the ground : he was all over as bright as a 
flame, so that I could but just bear to look towards him: his 
countenance was most inexpressibly dreadful, impossible for 
words to describe ; when he stepped upon the ground with his 



76 K0B1NS0N CRUSOE. 

feet, I thought the earth trembled, just as it had done before 
in the earthquake, and all the air looked, to my apprehension, 
as if it had been filled with flashes of fire. He was no sooner 
landed upon the earth, but he moved forward towards me, with 
a long spear or weapon in his hand, to kill me ; and when he 
came to a rising ground at some distance, he spoke to me — 
or I heard a voice so terrible that it is impossible to express 
the terror of it. All that I can say I understood, was this : — 
" Seeing all these things have not brought thee to repentance, 
now thou shalt die;" at which words, I thought he lifted 
up the spear that was in his hand to kill me. 

No one that shall ever read this account will expect that I 
should be able to describe the horrors of my soul at this 
terrible vision. I mean, that even while it was a dream, I 
■even dreamed of those horrors. Nor is it any more possible 
to describe the impression that remained upon my mind when 
I awaked, and found it was but a dream. 

I had, alas ! no divine knowledge. What I had received 
by the good instruction of my father was then worn out by 
an uninterrupted series, for eight years, of seafaring wicked- 
ness, and a constant conversation with none but such as were, 
like myself, wicked and profane to the last degree. I do not 
remember that I had, in all that time, one thought that so 
much as tended either to looking upwards towards God, or 
inwards towards a reflection upon my own ways ; but a certain 
stupidity of soul, without desire of good, or conscience of evil, 
had entirely overwhelmed me ; and I was all that the most 
hardened, unthinking, wicked creature among our common 
sailors can be supposed to be : not having the least sense, 
either of the fear of God, in danger, or of thankfulness to 
God, in deliverance. 

It is true, when I got on shore first here, and found all my 
ship's crew drowned, and myself spared, I was surprised with 
a kind of ecstasy, and some transports of soul, which, had the 
grace of God assisted, might have come up to true thankful- 
ness ; but it ended where it began, in a mere common flight 
■of joy, without the least reflection upon the distinguished 
goodness of the hand which had preserved me, and had singled 
me out to be preserved when all the rest were destroyed. 
Even Avhen I was, afterwards, on duo consideration, made 
sensible of my condition, how I was cast on this dreadful

place, out of the reach of human kind, out of all hope of 
relief, or prospect of redemption, as scon as I saw but a pros- 
pect of living, and that I should not starve and perish for 
hunger, all the sense of my affliction wore off; and I began 
to be very easy, applied myself to the works proper for my 
preservation and supply, and was far enough from being 
afflicted at my condition, as a judgment from Heaven, or as 
the hand of God against me : these were thoughts which very 
seldom entered my head. 

But to return to my Journal : — 

June 28. — Having been somewhat refreshed with the sleep 
I had had, and the>fit being entirely off, I got up ; and though 
the fright and terror of my dream was very great, yet I con- 
sidered that the fit of the ague would return again the next 
day, and now was my time to get something to refresh and 
support myself when I should be ill ; and the first thing I did, 
I filled a large square case-bottle with water, and set it upon 
my table, in reach of my bed ; and to take off the chill or 
aguish disposition of the Avater, I put about a quarter of a. 
pint of rum into it, and mixed them together. Then I got 
me a piece of the goat's flesh, and broiled it on the coals, but 
could eat very little. I walked about, but was very weak,, 
and withal very sad and heavy-hearted under a sense of my 
miserable condition, dreading the return of my distemper the 
next day. At night, I made my supper of three of the turtle's 
eggs, which I roasted in the ashes, and ate in the shell, and 
this was the first bit of meat I had ever asked God's blessing: 
to, that I could remember, in my whole life. After I had 
eaten, I tried to walk, but found myself so weak, that I could 
hardly carry a gun, for I never went out without that, so I 
went but a little way, and sat down upon the ground, looking 
out upon the sea, which was just before me, and very calm 
and smooth. Some such thoughts as these occurred to me : 
God knows that I am here, and am in this dreadful condition ; 
and if nothing happens without His appointment, He has ap- 
pointed all this to befall me. Nothing occurred to my thought 
to contradict any of these conclusions, and therefore it rested 
upon me with the greater force, that it must needs be that 
God had appointed all this to befall me ; that I was brought 
into this miserable circumstance by His direction, He having 
the sole power, not of me only, but of everything that hap- 



78 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

pened in the world. Immediately it followed — Why has Grod 
done this to me ? What have I done to be thus used ? My 
conscience presently checked me in that inquiry, as if I had 
blasphemed, and methought it spoke to me like a voice, 
" Wretch ! dost thou ask what thou hast done ? Look back 
upon a dreadful misspent life, and ask thyself, what thou hast 
not done ? Ask, why is it that thou wert not long ago de- 
stroyed ? Why wert thou not drowned in Yarmouth Eoads ; 
killed in the fight when the ship was taken by the Sallee man- 
of-war ; devoured by the wild beasts on the coast of Africa ; 
or drowned here, when all the crew perished but thyself? 
Dost thou aslc, what have I done 2" I was struck dumb with 
these reflections, as one astonished, and had not a word to say 
— no, not to answer to myself, but rose up pensive and sad, 
walked back to my retreat, and went up over my wall, as if I 
had been going to bed ; but my thoughts were sadly dis- 
turbed, and I had no inclination to sleep : so I sat down in 
my chair, and lighted my lamp, for it began to be dark. Now, 
as the apprehension of the return of my distemper terrified 
me very much, it occurred to my thought, that the Brazilians 
take no physic but their tobacco for almost all distempers, and 
I had a piece of a roll of tobacco in one of the chests, which 
was quite cured, and some also that was green, and not quite 
cured. 

I went, directed by Heaven no doubt, for in this chest I 
found a cure both for soul and body. I opened the chest, and 
found what I looked for, the tobacco : and as the few books I 
had saved lay there too, I took out one of the Bibles which I 
mentioned before, and which to this time I had not found 
leisure, or inclination, to look into. What use to make of the 
tobacco I knew not, in my distemper, or whether it was good 
for it or no ; but I tried several experiments with it, as if I was 
resolved it should hit one way or other. I first took a piece 
of leaf, and chewed it in my mouth, which, indeed, at first, 
almost stupified my brain, the tobacco being green and strong, 
and that I had not been much used to. Then I took some 
and steeped it an hour or two in some rum, and resolved to 
take a dose of it when I L'y down ; and, lastly, I burnt some 
upon a pan of coals, and held my nose close over the smoke of 
it as long as I could bear it, as well for the heat, as almost for 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 79 

suffocation. In the interval of this operation, I took up the 
Bible and began to read, but my head was too much disturbed 
with the tobacco to bear reading, at least at that time: 
only, having opened the book casually, the first words that 
occurred to me were these, " Gall on me in the day of trouble, 
and I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me." These 
words were very apt to my case, and made some impression 
upon my thoughts at the time of reading them, though not so 
much as they did afterwards ; for, as for being delivered, the 
word had no sound, as I may say, to me ; the thing was so 
remote, so impossible in my apprehension of tilings, that I 
began to say as the children of Israel did when they were 
promised flesh to eat, " Can God spread a table in the wilder- 
ness 1" so I began to say, " Can God Himself deliver me from this 
place?" And as it was not for many years that any hopes ap- 
peared, this prevailed very often upon my thoughts; but however, 
the words made a great impression upon me, and I mused upon 
them very often. It grew now late, and the tobacco had dozed 
my head so much that I inclined to sleep ; so I left my lamp 
burning in the cave, lest I should want anything in the night, 
and went to bed. But before I lay down, I did what I never 
had done in all my life ; I kneeled down, and prayed to God, 
to fulfil the promise to me, that if I called upon Him in the 
day of trouble, He would deliver me. After my broken and 
imperfect prayer was over, I drank the rum in which I had 
steeped the tobacco; which was so strong and rank of the 
tobacco, that I could scarcely get it down ; immediately upon 
this I went to bed. I found presently it flew up into my head 
violently ; but I fell into a sound sleep, and wuked no more 
till, by the sun, it must necessarily be near three o'clock in 
the afternoon the next clay ; nay, to this hour I am partly of 
opinion, that I slept all the next day and night, and till almost 
three the day after : for otherwise, I know not how I should 
lose a day out of my reckoning in the days of the week, as it 
appeared some years after I had done ; for if I had lost it by 
crossing and recrossing the Line, I should have lost more than 
one day ; but certainly I lost a day in my account, and never 
knew which way. Be that, however, one way or the other, 
when I awaked I found myself exceedingly refreshed, and my 
spirits lively and cheerful ; when I got up, I was stronger than 



80 EOBINSON CRUSOE. 

I was the day before, and my stomach better, for I was hungry ; 
and, in short, I had no fit the next day, but continued much 
altered for the better. This was the 29th. 

The 30th was my well day, of course, and I went abroad 
with my gun, but did not care to travel too far. I killed a 
sea-fowl or two, something like a brand goose, and brought 
them home ; but was not very forward to eat them ; so I ate 
some more of the turtle's eggs, which were very good. This 
evening I renewed the medicine, which I had supposed did 
me good the day before, the tobacco steeped in rum ; only I 
did not take so much as before, nor did I chew any of the leaf, 
or hold my head over the smoke ; however, I was not so well 
the next day, which was the 1st of July, as I hoped I should 
have been ; for I had a little spice of the cold fit, but it was 
not much. 

July 2. — I renewed the medicine all the three ways ; and 
dosed myself with it as at first, and doubled the quantity 
which I drank. 

July 3. — I missed the fit for good and all, though I did 
not recover my full strength for some weeks after. While I 
was thus gathering strength, my thoughts ran exceedingly upon 
this scripture, "I will deliver thee;" and the impossibility of 
my deliverance lay much upon my mind, in bar of my ever 
expecting it; but as I was discouraging myself with such 
thoughts, it occurred to my mind that I pored so much upon 
my deliverance from the main affliction, that I disregarded the 
deliverance I had received ; and I was, as it were, made to ask 
myself such questions as these, viz : Have I not been delivered, 
and wonderfully too, from sickness? from the most distressed 
condition that could be, and that was so frightful to me ? and 
what notice had I taken of it ? Had I done my part ? God 
had delivered me, but I had not glorified Him ; that is to say, 
I had not owned and been thankful for that as a deliverance : 
and how could I expect greater deliverance ? This touched 
my heart very much ; and immediately I knelt down, and 
gave God thanks aloud for my recovery from my sickness. 

July 4. — In the morning, I took the Bible ; and beginning 
at the New Testament, I began seriously to read it, and 
imposed upon myself to read awhile every morning and every 
night ; not tying myself to the number of chapters, but as long 
a3 my -thoughts should engage me. It was not long after I set 



EOBINSON CEUSOE. 



81 



seriously to this work, till I found my heart more deeply and 
sincerely affected with the wickedness of my past life. The 




FAQE 120. 



impression of my dream revived ; and the words, " All these 
things have not brought thee to repentance," ran seriously in 
my thoughts. I was earnnsHv w.-<v;..~ ~* Q 0< X to give rue 



82 BOBINSON CRUSOE. 

repentance, when it happened providentially, the very day 
that, reading the Scripture, I came to these words, " He is 
exalted a Prince and a Saviour, to give repentance and to give 
remission." I threw down the book; and with my heart as 
well as my hands lifted up to heaven, in a kind of ecstasy of 
'joy, I cried out aloud, " Jesus, thou son of David ! Jesus, thou 
exalted Prince and Saviour! give me repentance !" This was 
the first time I could say, in the true sense of the words, that 
I prayed in all my life ; for now I prayed with a sense of my 
condition, and with a true scripture view of hope, founded on 
the encouragement of the word of God; and from this time, I 
may say, I began to have hope that God would hear me. 

Now I began to construe the words mentioned above, " Call 
on Me, and I will deliver thee," in a different slnsc from what 
I had ever done before ; for then I had no notion of anything 
being called deliverance, but my being delivered from the cap- 
tivity I was in : for though I was indeed at large in the place, 
yet the island was certainly a prison to me, and that in the 
worst sense in the world. But now I learned to take it in 
another sense : now I looked back upon my past life with such 
horror, and my sins appeared so dreadful, that my soul sought 
nothing of God but deliverance from the load of guilt that 
bore down all my comfort. As for my solitary life, it was 
nothing ; I did not so much as pray to be delivered from it, 
or think of it ; it was all of no consideration in comparison 
to this. And I add this part here, to hint to whoever shall 
read it, that whenever they come to a true sense of things, they 
will find deliverance from sin a, much greater blessing than 
deliverance from affliction. 

But, leaving this part, I return to my Journal : — 
From the 4th of July to the 14th, I was chiefly employed 
in walking about with my gun in my hand, a little and a little 
at a time, as a man that was gathering up his strength after a 
fit of sickness : for it is hardly to be imagined how low I was, 
and to what weakness I was reduced. The application which 
I made use of was perfectly new, and perhaps which had never 
cured an ague before ; neither can I recommend it to anyone 
to practise by this experiment : and though it did carry off 
the fit, yet it rather contributed to weakening me; for I had 
frequent convulsions in my nerves and limbs for some time ; I 
learned from it also this, in particular, that being abroad in the 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 83 

rainy season was the most pernicious thing to my health that 
could be, especially in those rains which came attended with 
storms and hurricanes of wind ; for as the rain which came 
the dry season was almost always accompanied with such storms, 
so I found that rain was much more dangerous than the fain 
which fell in September and October. 

I had now been in this unhappy island above ten mouths : 
all possibility of deliverance from this condition seemed t be 
entirely taken from me ; and I firmly believed that no hu lan 
shape had ever set foot upon that place. Having now secured 
my habitation, as I thought, fully to my mind, I had a gre t 
desire to make a more perfect discovery of the island, and to 
see what otheftproductions I might find, which I yet knew 
nothing of. 

It was on th-3 15th of July that I began to take a more 
particular survey of the island itself. I went up the creek 
first, where I brought my rafts on shore. I found, after I 
came about two miles up, that the tide did not flow any higher ; 
and that it was no more than a little brook of running water, 
very fresh and good ; but this being the dry season, there was 
hardly any water in some parts of it. On the banks of this 
brook, I found many pleasaut savannahs or meadows, plain, 
smooth, and covered with grass: and on the rising parts of 
them, next to the higher grounds, where the water, as might 
be supposed, never overflowed, I found a great deal of tobacco, 
green, and growing to a great and very strong stalk ; there 
were divers otli€r plants, which I had no notion of or under- 
standing about, that might perhaps, have virtues of their own, 
which I could not find out. I searched for the cassava root, 
which the Indians, in all that climate, make their bread of, but 
I could find none. I saw large plants of aloes, but did not 
understand them. I saw several sugar-canes, but wild, and 
for want of cultivation, imperfect. I contented myself with 
these discoveries for this time, and came back, musing with 
myself what course I might take to know the virtue and good- 
ness of any of the fruits or plants which I should discover ; 
but could bring it to no conclusion ; for, in short, I had made 
so little observation while I was in the Brazils, that I knew 
little of the plants in the field, that might serve me to any 
purpose now in my distress. 

The next day, the 16th, I went up the same way again ; and 



84: BOBINSON CHUSOE. 

after going something farther than I had gone the day before, 
I found the brook and savannahs cease, and the country- 
became more woody. In this part, I found different fruits, and 
particularly melons upon the ground, in great abundance, and 
grapes upon the trees ; the vines had spread over the trees,, 
and the clusters of grapes were just now in their prime, very 
ripe and rich. This was a surprising discovery, and I was 
exceeding glad of them ; but I was warned by my experience 
to eat sparingly of them, remembering that when I was ashore 
in Barbary, the eating of grapes killed several of our English- 
men, who were slaves there, by throwing them into fluxes and 
fevers. But I found an excellent use for these grapes ; and 
that was, to cure or dry them in the sun, andr*keep them as 
dried grapes or raisins are kept, which I thought would be 
"wholesome and agreeable to eat, when no grapes could be 
had. 

I spent all that evening there, and went not back to my 
habitation, which, by the way, was the first night, as I might 
say, I had lain from home. In the night, I took my fir^t con- 
trivance, and got up into a tree, where I slept well ; and the 
next morning, proceeded upon my discovery, travelling nearly 
four miles, as I might judge by the length of the valley, keep- 
ing still due north, with a ridge of hills on the south and north 
side of me. At the end of this march, I came to an opening, 
where the country seemed to descend to the west ; and a 
little spring of fresh water, which issued out of the side of the 
hill by me, ran the other way ; and the country appeared so 
fresh, so green, so flourishing, everything being in a constant 
verdure, that it looked like a planted garden. I descended a 
little on the side of that delicious vale, surveying it with a 
kind of secret pleasure, though mixed with my other afflicting 
thoughts, that this was all my own ; that I was king and lord 
of all this country indefeasibly, and had a right of possession; 
and, if I could convey it, I might have it in inheritance as com- 
pletely as any lord of a manor in England. I saw here 
abundance of cocoa trees, orange and lemon, and citron trees; 
but all wild, and very few bearing any fruit. However, the 
green limes that I gathered were not only pleasant to eat, 
but very wholesome; and I mixed their juice afterwards with 
"water, which made it very wholesome, and very cool and re- 
freshing. I found now I had business enough, to gather and 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 8i> 

carry home; and I resolved to lay up a store, as well of 
grapes as limes and lemons, to furnish myself for the wet season, 
which I knew was approaching. In order to do this, I 
gathered a great heap of grapes in one place, a lesser heap in 
another place, and a great parcel of limes and lemons in another 
place ; and taking a few of each with me, I travelled home- 
wards : and resolved to come again, and bring a bag or sack,, 
or what I could make, to carry the rest home. Accordingly, 
having spent three days in this journey, I came home (so I 
must now call my tent and my cave), but before I got thither 
the grapes were spoiled ; the richness of the fruit, and the 
weight of the juice, having broken them and bruised them, 
they were good for little or nothing : as to the limes, they 
were good, but I could bring but a few. 

The next day being the 19th, I went back, having made me 
two small bags to bring home my harvest ; but I was surprised, 
when coming to my heap of grapes, which were so rich and 
fine when I gathered them, I found them all spread about, trod 
to pieces, and dragged about, some here, some there, and 
abundance eaten and devoured. By this, I concluded there 
were some wild creatures thereabouts, which had done this ; 
but what they were, I knew not. However, as I found there 
was no laying them up on heaps, and no carrying them away 
in a sack, but that one way they would be destroyed, and the 
other way they would be crushed with their own weight, I took 
another course ; for I gathered a large quantity of the grapes, 
and hung them upon the out branches of the trees, that they 
might cure and dry in the sun ; and as for the limes and the 
lemons, I carried as many back as I could well stand under. 

When I came home from this journey, I contemplated with 
great pleasure the fruitfulness of that valley, and the pleasant- 
ness of the situation ; the security from storms on that side 
the water, and the wood : and concluded that I had pitched 
upon a place to fix my abode, which was by far the worst part 
of the country. Upon the whole, I began to consider of re- 
moving my habitation ; and looking out for a place equally 
safe as where now I was situate, if possible, in that pleasant, 
fruitful part of the island. 

This thought ran long in my head, and I was exceeding 
fond of it for some time, the pleasantness of the place tempting 
me ; but when I came to a nearer view of it, I considered that 



86 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

I was now by the sea side, where it was at least possible that 
something might happen to my advantage ; and, by the same 
ill fate that brouerht mo hither, might brino; some other un- 
happy wretches to the same place; and though it was scarce 
probable that any such thing should ever happen, yet to inclose 
myself among the hills and woods in the centre of the island, 
was to anticipate my bondage, and to render such an affair 
not only improbable, but impossible; and that therefore I 
ought not by any means to remove. However, I was so en- 
amoured of this place, that I spent much of my time there for 
the whole of the remaining part of the month of July, and 
though, upon second thoughts, I resolved not to remove, yet I 
built me a little kind of a bower, and surrounded it at a 
distance with a strong fence, being a double hedge, as high as 
I could reach, well staked, and filled between with brushwood ; 
and here I lay very secure, sometimes two or three nights 
together ; always going over it with a ladder ; so that I fancied 
now I had my country house and my sea-coast house ; and this 
work took me up to the beginning of August. 

I had but newly finished my fence, and began to enjoy my 
labour, when the rains came on, and made me stick close to my 
first habitation ; for though I had made me a tent like the 
other, with a piece of a sail, and spread it very well, yet I had 
not the shelter of a hill to keep me from storms, nor a cave 
behind me to retreat into when the rains were extraordinary. 

About the beginning of August, as I said, I had finished my 
bower and began to enjoy myself. The 3rd of August, I found 
the grapes I had hung up perfectly dried, and indeed were 
excellent good raisins ; so I began to take them down from the 
trees, and it was very happy that I did so, for the rains which 
followed would have spoiled them, and I had lost the best part 
of my winter food; for I had above two hundred large bunches 
of them. No sooner had I taken them all down, and carried 
most of them home to my cave, but it began to rain ; and 
from hence, which was the 14th of August, it rained, more or 
less, every day till the middle of October ; and sometimes so 
violently, that I could not stir out of my cave for several 
days. 

In this season, I was much surprised with the increase of 
my family : I had been concerned for the loss of one of my cats, 
•who ran away from me, or, as I thought, had been dead, and 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 87 

I heard no more tidings of her, till to my astonishment, she 
came home about the end of August, with three kittens. This 
was the more strange to me, because, though I had killed a 
■wild cat, as I called it, with my gun, yet I thought it was a 
quite different kind from our European cats ; but the young 
cats were the same kind of house-breed as the old one ; and 
both my cats being females, I thought it very strange. But 
from these three cats, I afterwards came to be so pestered with 
cats, that I was forced to kill them like vermin, or wild beasts, 
and to drive them from my house as much as possible. 

From the 14th of August to the 26th, incessant rain, so 
that I could not stir, and was now very careful not ro be much 
wet. In this confinement, I began to be straitened for food : 
but venturing out twice, I one day killed a goat ; and the last 
day, which was the 26th, found a very large tortoise, which 
was a treat to me, and my food was regulated thus : — I ate a 
bunch of raisins for my breakfast ; a piece of the goat's flesh, or 
of the turtle, for my dinner, broiled, for I had no vessel to boil 
or stew anything ; and two or three of the turtle's eggs for 
my supper. 

During this confinement in my cover by the rain, I worked 
daily two or three hours at enlarging my cave, and by degrees 
worked it on towards one side, till I came to the outside of 
the hill, and made a door or way out, which came beyond 
my fence or wall ; and so I came in and out this way. But I 
was not perfectly easy at lying so open ; for, as I had managed 
myself before, I was in a perfect enclosure ; whereas now, I 
thought I lay exposed, and open for anything to come in upon 
me; and yet I could not perceive that there was any living 
thing to fear, the biggest creature that I had yet seen upon the 
island being a goat. 

Sept. 30. — I was now come to the unhappy anniversary of 
my landing. I cast up the notches on my post, and found I 
had been on shore three hundred and sixty-five days. I kept 
this day as a solemn fast, even till the going down of the sun; 
I then ate a biscuit-cake and a bunch of grapes, and went to 
bed , finishing the day as I began it, with religious exercise. 
I had all this time observed uo Sabbath-day ; for as at first I 
had no sense of religion upon my mind, I had, after some time, 
omitted to distinguish the weeks, by making a longer notch 
than ordinary for the Sabbath-day, and so did not really know 



88 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

what any of the days were ; but now, having cast up the days 
as above, I found I had been there a year, so I divided it into 
weeks, and set apart every seventh day for a Sabbath ; though 
I found at the end of my account, I had lost a day or two in 
my reckoning. A little after this, my ink began to fail me, 
and so I contented myself to use it more sparingly, and to 
write down only the most remarkable events of my life, without 
continuing a daily memorandum of other things. 

The rainy season and the dry season now began to appear 
regular to me, and I learned to divide them so as to provide 
for them accordingly ; but I bought all my experience before 
I had it, and this I am going to relate was one of the most 
discouraging experiments that I made. 

I have mentioned that I had saved the few cars of barley 
and rice, which I had so surprisingly found spring up, as I 
thought of themselves, and I believe there were about thirty 
stalks of rice, and about twenty of barley ; and now I thought 
it a proper time to sow it, after the rains, the sun being in its 
southern position, going from me. Accordingly, I dug up a 
piece of ground as well as I could with my wooden spade, and 
dividing it into two parts, I sowed my grain ; but as I was 
sowing, it casually occurred to my thoughts that I would not 
sow it all at first, because I did not know when was the proper 
time for it, so I sowed about two-thirds of the seed, leaving 
about a handful of each. It was a great comfort to me after- 
wards that I did so, for not one grain of what I sowed this 
time came to anything ; for the dry months following, the earth 
having had no rain after the seed was sown, it had no moisture 
to assist its growth, and never came up at all till the wet season 
had come again, and then it grew as if it had been but newly 
sown. Finding my first seed did not grow, which I easily 
imagined was by the drought, I sought for a moister piece of 
ground to make another trial in, and I dug up a piece of 
ground near my new bower, and sowed the rest of my seed in 
February, a little before the vernal equinox ; and this having the 
rainy months of March and April to water it, sprung up very 
pleasantly, and yielded a very good crop; but having part of 
the seed left only, and not daring to sow all that I had, I had 
but a small quantity at last, my whole crop not amounting to 
half a peck of each kind. But by this experiment T was made 
master of my business, and knew exactly when the proper 



o 



EOBINSON CRUSOE. 



89 



season was to sow, and that I might expect two seed-times 
and two harvests every year. 

While this corn was growing, I made a little discovery, which 
was of use to me afterwards. As soon as the rains were over, 




r.iGii l-'-l. 



and the weather began to settle, which was about the month 
of November, I made a visit up the country to my bower, 
where, though I had not been some months, yet I found all 
things just as I left them. The circle or double hedge 
that I had made was not only firm and entire, but the stakes 
which I had cut out of some trees that grew thereabouts, were 



90 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

all shot out and grown with long branches, as much as a willow- 
tree usually shoots the first year after lopping its head. I 
was surprised, and yet very well pleased, to see the young 
trees grow ; and I pruned them, and led them up to grow as 
much alike as I could ; and it is scarce credible how beautiful 
a figure they grew into in three years ; so that though the 
edge made a circle of about twenty-five yards in diameter, yet 
the trees soon covered it, and it was a complete shade, sufficient 
to lodge under all the dry season. This made me resolve to 
cut some more stakes, and make me a hedge like this, in a 
semi-circle round the wall of my first dwelling, which I did ; 
and placing the trees or stakes in a double row, at about eight 
yards distance from my first fence, they grew presently, and 
were at first a fine cover to my habitation, and afterwards 
served for a defence also, as I shall observe in its order. 

I found now that the seasons of the year might generally 
be divided, not into summer and winter, as in Europe, but 
into the rainy seasons and the dry seasons, which were 
generally thus : — 

The half of February, the whole of March, and the 
half of April — rainy, the sun being then on or near the 
equinpx. 

The half of April, the whole of May, June, and July, and 
the half of August — dry, the sun being then to the north of 
the Line. 

The half of August, the whole of September, and the half 
of October — rainy, the sun being then come back. 

The half of October, the whole of November, December, and 
January, and the half of February — dry, the sun being then 
to the south of the Line. 

The rainy seasons sometimes held longer or shorter, as the 
winds happened to blow, but this was the general observation 
I made. After I had found, by experience, the ill conse- 
quences of being abroad in the rain, I took care to furnish 
myself with provisions beforehand, that I might not be obliged 
to go out, and I sat within doors as much as possible during 
the wet months. This time I found much employment, and 
very suitable also to the time, for I found great occasion for 
many things which I had no way to furnish myself with but 
by hard labour and constant application ; particularly I tried 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 91 

many ways to make myself a basket, but all the twigs I could 
get for the purpose proved so brittle that they would do 
nothing. It proved of excellent advantage to me now, that 
when I was a boy, I used to take great delight in standing at 
a basket-maker's, in the town where my father lived, to see 
them make their wicker-ware ; and being, as boys usually are, 
very officious to help, and a great observer of the manner in 
which they worked those things, and sometimes lending a hand, I 
had by these means full knowledge of the methods of it, and I 
wanted nothing but the materials, when it came into my mind 
that the twigs of that tree whence I cut my stakes that grew 
might possibly be as tough as the sallows, willows, and osiers 
in England, asd I resolved to try. Accordingly, the next day 
I went to my country-house, as I called it, and cutting some 
of the smaller twigs, I found them to my purpose as much as 
I could desire; whereupon I came the next time prepared 
with a hatchet to cut down a quantity, which I soon found, for 
there was great plenty of them. These I set up to dry within 
my circle or hedge, and when they were fit for use, I carried 
them to my cave ; and here, during the next season, I employed 
myself in making, as well as I could, a great many baskets, 
both to carry or to lay up anything, as I had occasion ; and 
though I did not finish them very handsomely, yet I made 
them sufficiently serviceable for my purpose ; and thus, after- 
wards, I took care never to be without them; and as my 
wicker-Avare decayed, I made more, especially strong deep 
baskets to place my corn in, instead of sacks, when I should 
come to have any quantity of it. 

Having mastered this difficulty, and employed a world of 
time about it, I bestirred myself to see, if possible, how to 
supply two wants. I had no vessel to hold anything that was 
liquid, except two runlets, which were almost full of rum, and 
some glass bottles — some of the common size, and others, which 
were case-bottles, square, for the holding of waters, spirits, 
&c. I had not so much as a pot to boil anything, except a 
great kettle, which I saved out of the ship, and which was too 
big to make broth, and stew a bit of meat by itself. The 
second thing I fain would have had was a tobacco-pipe, but it 
was impossible to make one; however, I found a contrivance 
for that, too, at last. I employed myself in planting my 



92 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

second rows of stakes or piles and in this wicker-working all 
the summer or dry season, when another business took me up 
more time than it could be imagined I could spare. 

I mentioned before that I had a great mind to see the whole 
island, and that I had travelled up the brook, and so on to 
where I built my bower, and where I had an opening quite to 
the sea, on the other side of the island. I now resolved to 
travel quite across to the sea-shore on that side ; so, taking 
my gun, a hatchet, and my dog, and a larger quantity of 
powder and shot than usual, with two biscuit-cakes and a great 
bunch of raisins in my pouch for my store, I began my journey. 
"When I had passed the vale where my bower stood, as above, 
I came within view of the sea to the west, and it being a very 
clear day, I fairly descried land, at a very great distance ; 
by my guess, it could not be less than fifteen or twenty 
leagues off. 

I could not tell what part of the world this might be, other- 
wise than that I knew it must be part of America, and, as I con- 
cluded, by all my observations, must be near the Spanish 
dominions. 

After some thought upon this affair, I considered that if 
this land was the Spanish coast, I should certainty, one time 
or other, see some vessel pass or repass one way or other ; but 
if not, then it was the savage coast between the Spanish 
country and Brazils, where are found the worst of savages. 

With these considerations, I walked very leisurely forward ; 
I found that side of the island where I now was much plea- 
santer than mine — the savannah fields sweet, adorned with 
flowers and grass, and full of very fine woods. I saw 
abundance of parrots, and fain I would have caught one, if 
possible, to have kept it to be tame, and taught it to speak 
to me. I did, after some painstaking, catch a young 
parrot, for I knocked it down with a stick, and having re- 
covered it, I brought it home ; but it was some years before I 
could make him speak ; however, at last, I taught him to call 
me by my name very familiarly. But the accident that followed, 
though it be a trifle, will be very diverting in its place. 

I was exceedingly diverted with this journey. I found in 
the low grounds hares (as I thought them to be) and foxes? 
but they differed greatly from all the other kinds I had met 
with, nor could I satisfy myself to eat them, though I killed 



ROBIXSON CUUSOE. OO 

several. But I had no need to be venturous, for I had no want 
of food, and of that which was very good, too, especially these 
three sorts, viz., goats, pigeons, and turtle, or tortoise, which, 
added to my grapes, Leadenhall-market could not have fur- 
nished a table better than I, in proportion to the company. 

I never travelled in this journey above two miles outright 
in a day, or thereabouts ; but I took so many turns to see 
what discoveries I could make, that I came weary enough to 
the place where I resolved to sit down all night ; and then I 
either reposed myself in a tree, or surrounded myself with a 
row of stakes set upright in the ground, from one tree 
to another, so as no wild creature could come at me without 
waking me. 

As soon as I came to the sea-shore, I was surprised to see 
that I had taken up my lot on the worst side of the island, 
for here, indeed, the shore was covered with innumerable turtles, 
whereas, on the other side I had found but three in a year and 
a half. Here was also an infinite number of fowls of many 
kinds, some I had seen, and some I had not seen before, and 
many of them very good meat, but such as I knew not the 
names of, except those called penguins. 

I could have shot as many as I pleased, but was very sparing 
of my powder and shot, and therefore had more mind to kill 
a she-goat, if I could, which I could better feed on ; and 
though there were many goats here, more than on my side the 
island, yet it was with much more difficulty that I could come 
near them, the country being flat and even, and they saw me 
much sooner than when I was on the hill. 

I confess this side of the country was much pleasanter than 
mine : but yet I had not the least inclination to remove, for as 
I was fixed in my habitation it became natural to me, and I 
seemed all the while I was here to be as it were upon a journey, 
and from home. However, I travelled along the shore of the 
sea towards the east, I suppose about twelve miles, and then 
setting up a great pole upon the shore for a mark, I concluded 
I would go home again, and that the next journey I took 
should be on the other side of the island east from my dwelling, 
and so round till I came to my post again. 

I took another way to come back than that I went, thinking 
I could easily keep all the island so much in my view, that I 
could not miss finding my dwelling by viewing the country; 



94: ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

but I found myself mistaken, for, being come about two or, 
three miles, I found myself descended into a very large valley, 
but so surrounded with hills, and those hills covered with wood 
that I could not see which was my way by any direction but 
that of the sun, nor even then, unless I knew very well the 
position of the sun at that time of the day. It happened, to 
my further misfortune, that the weather proved hazy for three 
or four days while I was in the valley, and not being able to 
see the sun, I wandered about very uncomfortably, and at last 
was obliged to find the sea-side, look for my post, and come 
back the same way I went; and then by easy journeys I turned 
homeward, the weather being exceeding hot, and my gun, 
ammunition, hatchet, and other things, very heavy. 

In this journey my dog surprised a young kid, and seized 
upon it, and I, running in to take hold of it, caught it, and 
saved it alive from the dog. I had a great mind to bring it 
home if I could, for I had often been musing whether it might 
not be possible to get a kid or two, and so raise a breed of tame 
goats, which might supply me when my powder and shot should 
be all spent. I made a collar for this little creature, and with 
a string, which. I made of some rope-yarn, which I always 
carried about with me, I led him along, though with some 
difficulty, till I came to my bower, and there I inclosed him 
and left him, for I was very impatient to be at home, whence 
I had been absent above a month. 

I cannot express what a satisfaction it was to me to come 
into my old hutch, and lie down in my hammock-bed. This 
little wandering journey, without settled place of abode, had 
been so unpleasant to me, that my own house, as I called it to 
myself, was a perfect settlement to me compared to that; and 
it rendered everything about me so comfortable, that I resolved 
I would never go a great way from it again, while it should be 
my lot to stay on the island. 

I reposed myself here a week, to rest and regale myself 
after my long journey ; during which, most of the time was 
taken up in the weighty affair of making a cage for my Poll, 
who began now to be a mere domestic, and to be well 
acquainted with me. Then I began to think of the poor kid 
which I had penned in within my little circle, and resolved to 
go and fetch it home, or give it some food; accordingly I went, 
and found it where I left it, almost starved for want of food. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 95 

I went and cut boughs of trees, and branches of suclf'shrubs 
as I could find, and threw it over, and having fed it, I tied it 
as I did before, to lead it away; but it was so tame with being 
hungry, that I had no need to have tied it, for it followed me 
like a dog; and as I continually fed it, the creature became so 
loving, so gentle, and so fond, that it became from that 
time one of my domestics also, and would never leave me 
afterwards. 

The rainy season of the autumnal equinox was now come, 
and I kept the 30th of September in the same solemn manner 
as before, being the anniversary of my landing on the island, 
having now been there two years, and no more prospect of 
being delivered than the first day I came there. 

It was now that I began sensibly to feel how much more 
happy this life I now led was, with all its miserable circum- 
stances, than the wicked, cursed, abominable life I led all the 
past part of my days ; and now I changed both my sorrows 
and my joys; my very desires altered, my affections changed 
their gusts, and my delights were perfectly new from what they 
were at my first coming, or, indeed, for the two years past. 

I began to exercise myself with new thoughts; I daily read 
the word of God, and applied all the comforts of it to my 
present state. One morning, being very sad, I opened the 
Bible upon these words, "I will never, never leave thee, nor 
forsake thee;" immediately it occurred that these words were 
to me ; why else should they be directed in such a manner, 
just at the moment when I was mourning over my condition, 
as one forsaken of God and man? "Well then," said I, "if 
God does not forsake me, of what ill consequence can it be, 
or what matters it, though the world should all forsake me, 
seeing on the other hand, if I had all the world, and should 
lose the favour and blessing of God, there would be no 
comparison in the loss." 

From this moment I began to conclude in my mind, that it 
was possible for me to be more happy in this forsaken, solitary 
condition, than it was probable I should ever have been in any 
other particular state in the world; and with this thought I 
was going to give thanks to God f iv bringing me to this place. 
I know not what it was, but something shocked my mind at 
that thought, and I durst not speak the words. " How canst 
thou become such a hypocrite," said I, even audibly, " to pre- 



9C ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

tend to be thankful for a condition, which, however thou 
mayest endeavour to be contented with, thou wouldst rather 
pray heartily to be delivered from ?" So I stopped there, but 
though I could not say I thanked God for being there, yet I 
sincerely gave thanks to God for opening my eyes, by what- 
ever afflicting providences, to see the former condition of my 
life, and to mourn for my wickedness, and repent. I never 
opened the Bible, or shut it, but my very soul within me 
blessed God for directing my friend in England, without any 
order of mine, to pack it up among my goods, and for assist- 
ing me afterwards to save it out of the wreck of the ship. 

In this disposition of mind, I began my third year ; and 
though I have not given the reader the trouble of so parti- 
cular an account of my works this year as the first; yet in 
general it may be observed, that I was very seldom idle, but 
having regularly divided my time according to the several 
daily employments that were before me, such as, first, my duty 
to God, and the reading the Scriptures, which I constantly set 
apart some time for, thrice every day; secondly, the going 
abroad with my gun for food, which generally took me up three 
hours in every morning, when it did not rain : thirdly, the 
ordering, cutting, preserving, and cooking, what I had killed 
or caught for my supply : these took up great part of the day; 
also, it is to be considered, that in the middle of the day, when 
the sun was in the zenith, the violence of the heat was too 
great to stir out ; so that about four hours in the evening was 
all the time I could be supposed to work in, with this 
exception, that sometimes I changed my hours of hunting and 
working, and went to work in the morning, and abroad with 
my gun in the afternoon. 

To this short time for labour, may be added the exceeding 
laboriousness of my work ; the many hours which for want of 
tools, want of help, and want of skill, everything I did took up 
out of my time : for example, I was full two and forty days in 
making a board for a long shelf, which I wanted in my cave ; 
whereas, two sawyers, with their tools and a saw-pit, would 
have cut six of them out of the same tree in half a day. 

My case was this : it was to be a large tree which was to be 
cut down, because my board was to be a broad one. This tree 
I was three days in cutting down, and two more cutting off 
the boughs, and reducing it to a log, or piece of timber. With 



ROKIXSON CRUSOE. 97 

inexpressible Lacking and hewing, I reduced both the sides of 
it into chip3 till it began to be light enough to move; then I 
turned it, and made one side of it smooth and flat as a board 
from end to end ; then turning that side downward, cut the 




other side, till I brought the plank to be about three inches 
thick, and smooth on both sides. Anyone may judge the 
labour in such a piece of work, but labour and patience carried 
me through that, and many other things, as will appear by 
what follows. 

1 was now, in the months of November and December, ex- 
7 



98 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

pccting my crop of barley and rice. The ground I had 
manured and dug up for them was not great ; for, as I observed 
my seed of each was not above the quantity of half a peck, but 
now my crop promised very well, when on a sudden I found I 
was in danger of losing it all again by enemies of several sorts, 
which it was scarcely possible to keep from it; as, first the 
goats, and wild creatures which I called hares, who, tasting 
the sweetness of the blade, lay in it night and day, as soon as 
it came up, and ate it so close, that it could get no time to 
shoot up into stalk. 

This I saw no remedy for, but by making an enclosure about 
it with a hedge ; which I did with a great deal of toil, and the 
more, because it required speed. However, as my arable land 
was but small, suited to my crop, I got it totally well fenced 
in about three weeks' time ; and shooting some of the creatures 
in the day-time, I set my dog to guard it in the night, tying 
him up to a stake at the gate, where he would stand and bark 
all night long; so in a little time, the enemies forsook the 
place, and the corn grew very strong and well, and began to 
ripen apace. 

But as the beasts ruined me before, while my corn was in 
the blade, so the birds were as likely to ruin me now, when it 
was in the car ; for going along by the place to see how it throve, 
I saw my little crop surrounded with fowls, of I know not how 
many sorts, who stood, as it were, watching till I should be 
gone. I immediately let fly among them, for I always had my 
gun with me. I had no sooner shot, but there rose up a little 
cloud of fowls, which I had not seen at all, from among the 
corn itself. 

This touched me sensibly, for I foresaw that in a few days 
they would devour all my hopes ; that I should be starved, and 
never be able to raise a crop at all, and what to do I could not 
tell; however, I resolved not to lose my corn, if possible, 
though I should watch it night and day. In the first place, I 
went among it, to see what damage was already done, and 
found they had spoiled a good deal of it ; but that as it was yet 
too green for them, the loss was not so great, but that the 
remainder was likely to bo a good crop, if it could be saved. 

I stayed by it to load my gun, and then coming away, I 
couhl easily see the thieves sitting upon all the trees about me, 



ROEIXSON CRUSOE. 99 

as if they only waited till I was gone away, and the event 
proved it to be so ; for as I walked off, as if I was gone, I was 
no sooner out of their sight, than they dropped clown one by 
one into the corn again. I was so provoked, that I could not 
have patience to stay till more came on, knowing that every 
grain that they ate now was, as it might be said, a peck-loaf 
to me in the consequence ; but coming up to the hedge I fired 
again, and killed three of them. This was what I wished for ; 
so I took them up, and served them as we serve notorious 
thieves in England — hanged them in chains, for a terror to 
others. It is impossible to imagine that this should have such 
an effect as it had, for the fowls would not only not come at 
the corn, but, inshort, theyforsook all that part of the island, and 
I could never see a bird near the place as long as my scare- 
crows hung there. This I was very glad of, and about the 
latter end of December, which was our second harvest of the 
year, I reaped my corn. 

I was sadly put to it for a scythe or sickle to cut it down, 
and all I could do was to make one, as well as I could, out of 
one of the broad-swords, or cutlasses, which I saved among 
the arms out of the ship. However, as my first crop was but 
small, I had no great difficulty to cut it down; in short, I 
reaped it my way, for I cut nothing off but the cars, and 
carried it away in a great basket which I had made, and so 
rubbed it out with my hands ; and at the end of my harvesting, 
I found that out of my half-peck of seed I had near two bushels 
of rice, and about two bushels and a half of barley ; that is to 
say, by my guess, for I had no measure at that time. 

However, this was a great encouragement to me, and I fore- 
saw that, in time, it would please God to supply me with bread: 
and yet, here I was perplexed again, for I neither knew how 
to grind or make meal of my corn, or, indeed, how to clean it 
and part it ; nor, if made into meal, how to make broad of it : 
and if how to make it, yet I knew not how to bake it ; I re- 
solved not to taste any of this crop, but to preserve it all for 
seed against the next season ; and, in the meantime, to employ 
all my study and hours of working to accomplish this great 
work of providing myself with corn and bread. 

It might be truly said, that now I worked for my bread. I 
believe few people have thought much upon the strange multi- 



100 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

iude of little tilings necessary in the providing, producing, 
curing, dressing, making, and finishing this one article of 
bread. 

I, that was reduced to a mere state of nature, found this to 
my daily discouragement, and was made more sensible of it 
every hour. 

First, I had no plough to turn up the earth ; no spade or 
shovel to dig it. Well, this I conquered by making me a 
wooden spade, as I observed before, but this did my work but 
in a wooden manner, and though it cost me a great many days 
to make it, yet for want of iron, it not only wore out soon, but 
made my work the harder, and made it be performed much 
worse. However, this I bore with, and was content to work 
it out with patience, and bear with the badness of the per- 
formance. When the corn was sown, I had no harrow, but 
was forced to go over it myself, and drag a great heavy bough 
of a tree over it, to scratch it, as it may be called, rather than 
rake or harrow it. When it was growing, and grown, I have 
observed already how many things I wanted to fence it, secure 
it, mow or reap it, cure and carry it home, thrash, part it from 
the chaff, and save it. Then I wanted a mill to grind it, sieves 
to dress it, yeast and salt to make it into bread, and an oven 
to bake it, but all these things I did without, as shall be ob- 
served ; and yet the corn was an inestimable comfort am 
advantage to me, too. All this made everything laborious an 
tedious to me, but that there was no help for; neither was my 
time so much loss to me, because, as I had divided it, a certain 
part of it was every day appointed to these works ; and as I had 
resolved to use none of the corn for bread till I had a greater 
quantity by me, I had the next six months to apply myself 
wholly, by labour and invention, to furnish myself with utensils 
proper for the performing all the operations necessary for 
making the corn, when I had it, fit for my use. 

But first I was to prepare more land, for I had now seed 
enough to sow above an acre of ground. Before I did this, I 
had a week's work at least to make mo a spade, which, when it 
was done, was but a sorry one indeed, and very heavy, and 
required double labour to work with it. However, I got 
through that, and sowed my seed in two large flat pieces of 
ground, as near my house as i could find them to my mind, 
and fenced them in with a good hedg 1 ', the stakes of which 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 10L 

were all cut of that wood which I had set before, and knew it 
would grow ; so that, in one year's time, I knew I should have 
a quick or living hedge, that would want but little repair. 
This work did not take mo up less than three months, because 
a great part of that time was the wet season, when I could not 
go abroad. Within doors I found employment in the following 
-occupations — always observing, that all the while I was at 
work, I diverted myself with talking to my parrot, and teaching 
liim to speak; and I quickly taught him to know his own name, 
and at last to speak it out pretty loud, Poll, which was the first 
word I ever heard spoken in the island by any mouth but my 
own. This, therefore, was not my work, but an assistance to 
my work, for now, as I said, I had a great employment upon, 
my hands, as follows: I had long studied to make, by some 
means or other, some earthen vessels, which, indeed, I wanted 
sorely, but knew not where to come at them. However, con- 
sidering the heat of the climate, I did not doubt but if I could 
find out any clay, I might make some pots that might, being 
dried in the sun, be hard enough and strong enough to bear 
handling, and to hold anything that was dry, and required to 
be kept so ; and as this was necessary in the preparing corn, 
meal, &c, which was the thing I was doing, I resolved to make 
some as large as I could, and fit only to stand like jars, to hold 
what should be put into them. 

It would make the reader pity me, or rather laugh at me, 
to tell how many awkward ways I took to raise this paste ; 
what odd, misshapen, ugly things I made; how many of them 
fell in, and how many fell out, the clay not being stiff enough 
to bear its own weight; how many cracked by the over-violent 
heat of the sun, being set out too hastily ; and how many fell 
in pieces with only removing, as well before as after they were 
dried ; and, in a word, how, after having laboured hard to find 
the clay — to dig it, to temper it, to bring ic home, and work 
it — 1 could not make above two large earthen ugly things (I 
cannot call them jars) in about two months' labour. 

However, as the sun baked these two very dry and hard, I 
lifted them very gently up, and set them down again in two 
great wicker baskets, which I had made on purpose for them, 
that they might not break ; and as between the pot and the 
basket there was a little room to spare, I stuffed it full of the 
rice and barley straw; and these two pots being to stand 



102 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

always dry, I thought would hold my dry corn, and perhaps* 
the meal, when the corn was bruised. 

Though I miscarried so much in my design for large pots, 
yet I made several smaller things with better success ; such as- 
little round pots, flat dishes, pitchers, and pipkins, and any 
things my hand turned to; and the heat of the sun baked 
them quite hard. 

But my end was to get an earthen pot to hold what was 
liquid, and bear the fire ; which none of these could do. It 
happened after some time, making a pretty large fire for cook- 
ing my meat, when I went to put it out after I had done with 
it, I found a broken piece of one of my earthenware vessels in 
the fire burnt as hard as a stone, and red as a tile. I was 
agreeably surprised to see it, and said to myself, that certainly 
they might be made to burn whole, if they would burn 
broken. 

This set me to study how to order my fire, so as to make it 
burn some pots. I had no notion of a kiln, such as the potters 
burn in, or of glazing them with lead, though I had some lead 
to do it with ; but I placed three large pipkins, and two or 
three pots, in a pile, one xipon another, and placed my firewood 
all round it with a great heap of embers under them. I plied 
the fire with fresh fuel round the outside, and upon the top, 
till I saw the pots in the inside red-hot quite through, and ob- 
served that they did not crack at all ; when I saw them clear 
red, I let them stand in that heat about five or six hours, till I 
found one of them, though it did not crack, did melt or run ; 
for the sand which was mixed with the clay melted by the 
violence of the heat, and would have run into glass if I had 
gone on ; so I slacked my fire gradually till the pots began 
to abate of the red colour, and watching them all night, 
that I might not let the fire abate too fast, in the morning I 
had three very good (I will not say handsome) pipkins, and 
two other earthen pots, as hard burnt as could be desired, 
and one of them perfectly glazed with the running of the 
sand. 

After this experiment, I need not say that I wanted no sort 
of earthenware for my use ; but as to the shapes of them, they 
were very indifferent, as anyone may suppose. 

No joy at a tiling of so mean a nature was over equal to 
mine, when I found I had made an earthen pot that would 



3 



ROBINSON CRLEOE. 103 

bear the fire ; and I had hardly patience to stay till they were 
cold, before I set one on the fire again, with some water in it, 
to boil me some meat, which it did admirably well ; and with 
a piece of a kid I made some very good broth, though I wanted 
oatmeal, and several other ingredients requisite to make it as 
good as I would have had it been. 

My next concern was to get me a stone mortar to stamp or 
beat some corn in ; for as to the mill, there was no thought of 
arriving at that perfection of art with one pair of hands. To 
supply this want, I was at a great loss ; for, of all the trades 
in the world, I was as perfectly unqualified for a stone-cutter, 
as for any whatever ; neither had I any tools to go about it 
with. I spent many a day to find out a great stone big 
enough to cut hollow, and make fit for a mortar, and could 
find none at all, except what was in the solid rock, and which 
I had no way to dig or cut out ; nor indeed were the rocks 
in the island of hardness sufficient, but were all of a sandy 
crumbling stone, which neither would bear the weight of a 
heavy pestle, nor would break the corn, without filling it with 
sand ; so, after a great deal of time lost in searching for a 
stone, I gave it over, and resolved to look out for a great 
block of hard wood, which I found indeed much easier ; and 
getting one as big as I had strength to stir, I rounded it, and 
formed it on the outside with my axe and hatchet, and then, 
with the help of fire, and infinite labour, made a hollow place 
in it, as the Indians in Brazil make their canoes. After this, 
I made a great heavy pestle, or beater, of the wood called the 
iron-wood ; and this I prepared and laid by against I had my 
next crop of corn, which I proposed to myself to grind, or 
rather pound, into meal, to make bread. 

My next difficulty was to make a sieve, to dress my meal, 
and to part it from the bran and the husk ; without which I 
did not see it possible I could have any bread. This was a 
most difficult thing, even to think on, for to be sure I had 
nothing like the necessary thing to make it; I mean fine thin 
canvas, or stuff, to scarce the meal through. And here I was 
at a full stop for many months ; nor did I really know what 
to do. Linen I had none left, but what was mere rags ; I had 
goats'-hair, but neither knew how to weave it or spin it ; and 
had I known how, here were no tools to work it with. All 
the remedy that I found for this was, that at last I did re- 



104 HOBINSON CRUSOE. 

member I had, among the seamen's clothes which were saved 
out of the ship, some neckcloths of calico or muslin ; and with 
some pieces of these I made three small sieves, proper enough 
for the work ; and thus I made shift for some years : how 
I did afterwards, I shall show in its place. 

The baking part was the next thing to be considered, and 
how I should make bread when I came to have corn ; for, 
first, I had no yeast; as to that part, there was no supplying 
the want, so I did not concern myself much about it. But 
for an oven, I was indeed in great pain. At length, I found 
out an experiment for that also, which was this : I made some 
earthen vessels very broad, but not deep, that is to say, about 
two feet diameter, and not above nine inches deep ; these I 
burned in the fire, as I had done the other, and laid them by ; 
and when I wanted to bake, I made a great fire upon my 
hearth, which I had paved with some square tiles, of my own 
baking and burning also. 

When the fire-wood was burned pretty much into embers, 
I drew them forward upon this hearth, so as to cover it all over, 
and there I let them lie till the hearth was very hot; then 
sweeping away all the embers, I set down loaves, and whelming 
down the earthen pot upon them, drew the embers all round 
the outside of the pot, to keep in and add to the heat; and 
thus, as well as in the best oven in the world, I baked my 
barley loaves, and became, in a little time, a good pastry-cook 
into the bargain ; for I made myself several cakes and puddings 
of the rice; but I made no pies, neither had I anything to put 
into them, except the flesh either of fowls or goats. 

All these things took me up most part of the third year of 
my abode here ; for. it is to be observed, that in the intervals 
of these things, I had my new harvest and husbandry to 
manage ; for I reaped my corn in its season, and carried it 
home as well as I could, and laid it up in the ear, in my large 
baskets, till I had time to rub it out, for I had no floor to 
thrash it on, or instrument to thrash it with. 

A.nd now, my stock of corn increasing, I wanted to build 
my barns bigger ; I wanted a place to lay it up in, for the in- 
crease of the corn now yielded me so much, that I had of the 
barley about twenty bushels, and of the rice as much, or more, 
insomuch that now I resolved to begin to u.->c it freely ; for 
my bread had been quite gone a great while ; also I resolved 



EOBINSON CRUSOE. 



105 



to see what quantity would be sufficient for me a whole year, 
and to sow but once a-ycar. 

Upon the whole, I found that the forty bushels of barley 
and rice were much more than I could consume in a year ; so 
I resolved to sow just the same quantity every year that I 




so'.vcJ the hut, in hopes that such a quantity would fully pro- 
viso me with bread, &c. 

All the while these things were doing, my thoughts ran 
many times upon the prospect of land which I had seen from 
'the other side of the island ; and I was not without secret 
wishes that I were on shore there, fancying I might find some 



106 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

way or otherto convey myself farther, and perhaps at last find 
some means of escape. 

Now I wished for my boy Xury, and the long-boat with the 
shoulder-of-mutton sail, with which I sailed above a thousand 
miles on the coast of Africa ; but this was in vain : then I 
thought I would go and look at our ship's boat, which was 
blown up upon the shore a great way, in the storm, when we 
were first cast away. She lay almost where she did at first ; 
and was turned, by the force of the waves and the winds, 
almost bottom upward, but no water about her. If I had had 
hands to have refitted her, and to have launched her into the 
water, the boat would have done well enough, and I might 
have gone back into the Brazils with her easily ; but I might 
have foreseen that I could no more turn her and set her up- 
right upon her bottom, than I could remove the island ; how- 
ever, I went to the woods, and cut levers and rollers, and 
brought them to the boat, resolving to try what I could do ; 
suggesting to myself, that if 1 could but turn her down, I 
might repair the damage she had received, and she would be 
a very good boat, and I might go to sea in her very easily. 

I spared no pains in tin's piece of fruitless toil, and spent 
three or four weeks about it ; at last, finding it impossible to 
heave it up with my little strength, I fell to digging away the 
sand, to undermine it, and so to make it fall down, setting 
pieces of wood to thrust and guide it right in the fall. 

But when I had done this, I was unable to stir it up again, 
or to get under it, much less to move it forward towards the 
water ; so I was forced to give it over. 

This at length put me upon thinking whether it was not 
possible to make myself a canoe, or periagua, such as the 
natives of those climates make, even without tools, of the trunk 
of a great tree. This I not only thought possible, but easy, 
and pleased myself extremely with the thoughts of making it, 
and with my having much more convenience for it than any 
of the negroes or Indians ; but not at all considering the par- 
ticular inconveniences which I lay under more than the Indians 
did, viz., want of hands to move it, when it was made, into 
the water ; for what was it to me, if when I had chosen a vast 
tree in the woods, and with much trouble cut it down, if I 
had been able with my tools to hew and dub the outside into 
the proper shape of a boat, and burn or cut out the inside to 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 107' 

make it hollow, so as to make a boat of it — if, after all this, I 
must leave it just where I found it, and not be able to launch 
it into the water ? 

I went to work upon this boat the most like a fool that ever 
man did, who had any of his senses awake. I pleased myself 
with the design, without determining whether I was ever able 
to undertake it ; not but that the difficulty of launching my 
boat came often into my head ; but I put a st. >p to my in- 
quiries into it, by this foolish answer : " Let me first make it ; 
I warrant I will find some way or other to get it along when 
it is done." 

I felled a cedar-tree, and I question much whether Solomon 
ever had such a one for the building of the Temple of Jeru- 
salem •, it was five feet ten inches diameter at the lower part 
next the stump, and four feet eleven inches diameter at the end 
of twenty-two feet. It was not without infinite labour that I 
felled this tree ; I was twenty days hacking and hewing at it 
at the bottom ; I was fourteen more getting the branches and 
limbs cut oft', which I hacked and hewed through with axe and 
hatchet, with inexpressible labour: after this, it cost me a 
month to shape it and dub it to a proportion, and to some- 
thing like the bottom of a boat, that it might swim upright as 
it ought to do. It cost me near three months more to clear 
the inside, and work it out so as to make an exact boat of it ; 
this I did, without fire, by mere mallet and chisel, and by the 
dint of hard labour, till I had brought it to be a very hand- 
some periagua, and big enough to have carried six and twenty 
men, and consequently big enough to have carried me and all 
my cargo. 

When I had gone through this work, I was extremely de- 
lighted with it. The boat was really much bigger than ever I 
saw a canoe or periagua, that was made of one tree, in my life. 
Many a weary stroke it had cost, you may be sure : and had 
I gotten it into the water I make no question but I should have 
begun the maddest voyage, and the most unlikely to be per- 
formed, that ever was undertaken. 

But all my devices to get it into the water failed me. It 
lay about one hundred yards from the water ; but the first in- 
convenience was, it was up hill towards the creek. To take 
away this discouragement, I resolved to dig into the surface 
of the earth, and so make a declivity : this I began : but when 



108 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

this was worked through, and this difficulty managed, it was 
still much the same, for I could no more stir the canoe than I 
could the other boat. Then I measured the distance of 
ground, and resolved to cut a dock or canal, to bring the water 
up to the canoe. Well, I began this work ; and when I began 
to calculate how deep it was to be dug, how broad, how the 
stuff was to be thrown out, I found that, by the number of 
hands I had, being none but my own, it must have been ten 
or twelve years before I could have gone through with it ; for 
the shore lay so high, that at the upper end it must have been 
at least twenty feet deep ; so, with great reluctancy, I gave 
this attempt over also. 

I had now been here so lono; that manv things which I 
brought on shore for my help were either quite gone, or very 
much wasted, and near spent. 

My ink had been gone some time, all but a very little, which 
I eked out with water, till it was so pale, it scarce left any ap- 
pearance of black upon the paper. As long as it lasted, I made 
use of it to minute down the days of the month on which any 
remarkable thing happened to me : and, first, by casting up 
times past, I remembered that there was a strange concurrence 
of days in the various providences which befell me, and which, 
if I had been superstitiously inclined to observe days as fatal 
or fortunate, I might have had reason to have looked upon with 
a great deal of curiosity. 

First, I had observed, that the same day that I broke away 
from my father and friends, and ran away to Hull, in order to 
go to sea, the same day afterwards I was taken by the Salleo 
man-of-war, and made a slave ; the same day of the year that 
I escaped out of the wreck of that ship in Yarmouth Eoads, 
that same day-year afterwards I made my escape from Sallee 
in a boat ; the same day of the year I was born on, viz., the 
30th of September, that same day I had my life so miraculously 
saved twenty-six years after, when I was cast on shore in this 
island ; so that my wicked life and my solitary life began both 
on a day. 

The next thing to my ink being wasted, was the biscuit 
which I brought out of the ship ; this I had husbanded to the 
last degree, allowing myself but one cake of bread a day for 
above a year; and yet I was quite without bread for near a 
year before I got any corn of my own. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 109 

My clothes, too, began to decay ; as to linen, I had had none 
a good while, except some chequered shirts which I found in 
the chests of the other seamen, and which I carefully preserved ; 
because many times I could bear no other clothes on but a 
shirt. 

Upon these views, I began to consider about putting the 
few rags I had into some order ; I had worn out all the waist- 
coats I had, and my business was now to try if I could not 
make jackets out of the great watch-coats which I had by me, 
and with such other materials as I had ; so I set to work, 
tailoring, or rather, indeed, botching, for I made most piteous 
work of it. However, I made shift to make two or three new 
waistcoats, which I hoped would serve me a great while ; as 
for breeches or drawers, I made but a very sorry shift indeed 
till afterwards. 

I have mentioned that I saved the skins of all the creatures 
that I killed, I mean four-footed ones, and I had them hung- 
up stretched out with sticks in the sun, by which means some 
of them were so dry and hard that they were fit for little, but 
others were very useful. The first thing I made of these was 
a great cap for my head, with the hair on the outside, to shoot 
off the rain ; and this I performed so well, that after, I made 
me a suit of clothes wholly of these skins. 

After this, I spent a great deal of time and pains to make 
an umbrella ; I was in great want of one ; I had seen them 
made in the Brazils, where they are very useful in the great 
heats there, and I felt the heats every jot as great here, and 
greater too, being nearer the equinox ; besides, as I was 
obliged to be much abroad, it was a most useful thing to me, 
as well for the rains as the heats. I took a world of pains with 
it, and was a great while before I could make anything likely 
to hold : nay, after I thought I had hit the way, I spoiled two 
or three before I made one to my mind : but at last I made 
one that answered indifferently well ; the main difficulty I 
found was to make it let down. I could make it spread, but 
if it did not let down too, and draw in, it was not portable for 
me any way but just over my head. However, at last, I made 
one to answer, and covered it with skins, the hair upwards, 
so that it cast oft* the rain like a pent-house, and kept off the 
sun so eilectually, that I could walk out in the hottest of tho 
weather with greater advantage than I could before in the 



110 ROBINSOX CRUSO". 

coolest, and when I had no need of it, could close it, and 
carry it under my arm. 

I cannot say, that after this, for five years, any extraordinary 
thing happened to me, but I lived on in the same course, in 
the same place as before ; the chief things I was employed in, 
besides my yearly labour of planting my barley and rice, and 
curing my raisins, of both which I always kept up just enough 
to have sufficient stock of one year's provision beforehand ; and 
my daily pursuit of going out with my gun, I had one labour, 
to make a canoe, which at last I finished : so that, by digging 
a canal to it of six feet wide and four feet deep, I brought it 
into the creek, almost half amile. As for the first, which was 
so vastly big, I was obligectvsto let it lie where h was, as a 
memorandum to teach me to be wiser the next time ; indeed, 
the next time, though I could not get a tree proper for it, and 
was in a place where I could not get the water to it at any less 
distance than near half a mile, yet, as I saw it was practicable 
at last, I never gave it over ; and though I was near two years 
about it, yet I never grudged my labour, in hopes of having a 
boat to go off to sea at last. 

However, though my little periagua was finished, yet the size 
of it was not at all answerable to the design which I had in 
view when I made the first ; of venturing over to the terra 
Jirma, where it was above forty miles broad ; accordingly the 
smallness of my boat assisted to put an end to that design, and 
now I thought no more of it. My next design was to make a 
cruise round the island ; for as I had been on the other side in 
one place, crossing over the land, so the discoveries I made in 
that little journey made mo very eager to see other parts of the 
coast ; and now I had a boat, I thought of nothing but sailing 
round the island. 

For this purpose, I fitted up a little mast in my boat, and 
made a sail too out of some of the pieces of the ship's sails 
which lay in store. Having fitted my mast and sail, and tried 
the boat, I found she would sail very well : then I made little 
lockers, at each end of my boat, to put provisions, necessaries, 
ammunition, &c\, into, to be kept dry, and a little, long, hollow 
place I cut in the inside of the boat, where I could lay my gun, 
making a flap to hang down over it, to keep it dry. 

I fixed my umbrella also in a step at the stern, to stand over 
my head, and keep the heat of the sun off me, like an awning; 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. Ill 

and thus I every now and then took a little voyage upon the 
sea : but never went far out, nor far from the little creek. At 
last, being eager to view the circumference of my little king- 
dom, I resolved upon my cruise ; and accordingly I victualled 
my ship for the voyage, putting in two dozen of loaves of 
barley bread, an earthen pot full of parched rice, a little bottle 
of rum, half a goat, and powder and shot for killing more, and 
two large watch coats I had saved out of the seamen's chests ; 
these I took, one to lie upon, and the other to cover me in 
the night. 

It was the 6th of November, in the sixth year of my reign, 
or captivity, which you please, that I set out on this voyage, 
and I found it much longer than I expected ; for though the 
island itself was not very large, yet when I came to the east 
side of it, I found a great ledge of rocks lie out about two 
leagues into the sea, and beyond that a shoal of sand, lying 
dry half a league more, so that I was obliged to go a great way 
out to sea to double the point. 

When first I discovered them, I was going to give over my 
enterprise, and come back again, not knowing how far it might 
oblige mo to go out to sea ; and, above all, doubting how I 
should get back again : so I came to an anchor ; for I had made 
a kind of an anchor, with a piece of a broken grappling which 
I got out of the ship. 

But the third day, in the morning, I ventured : but I am a 
warning to all rash and ignorant pilots ; for no sooner was I 
come to the point, when I was not even my boat's length from 
the shore, but I found myself in a great depth of water, and a 
current like the sluice of a mill: it carried my boat along with 
it with such violence that all I could do could not keep her so 
much as on the edge of it ; but I found it hurried me farther 
and farther out from the eddy, which was on my left hand. 
There was no wind stirring to help me, and all I could do with 
my paddles signified nothing ; and now I began to give myself 
over for lost ; for as the current was on both sides of the island, 
I knew in a few leagues' distance they must join again, and 
then I was irrecoverably gone ; so that I had no prospect before 
me but of perishing, not by the sea, for that was calm enough, 
but of starving from hunger. I had, indeed, found a tortoise 
on the shore, as big almost as I could lift, and had tossed it 
into the I]<>r;t ; and I had a great jar of fresh water; but what 



112 KOBIXSON CRUSOE. 

was all this to being driven into the vast ocean, where, to be 
sure, there was no shore, no main land or island, for a thousand 
leagues at least. 

And now I saw how easy it was for the providence of God 
to make even the most miserable condition of mankind worse. 
Now I looked back upon my desolate, solitary island, as the 
most pleasant place in the world, and all the happiness my 
heart could wish for was to be but there again. It is scarcely 
possible to imagine the consternation I was now in, being driven 
from my beloved island into the wide ocean, almost two leagues, 
and in the utmost despair of ever recovering it again. How- 
ever, I worked hard till my strength was almost exhausted, 
and kept my boat as much to the northward, that is towards 
the side of the current which the eddy lay on, as possibly I 
could ; when about noon, as the sun passed the meridian, I 
thought I felt a little breeze of wind in my face, springing up 
from S.S.E. This cheered my heart a little, and especially 
when, in about half an hour more, it blew a pretty gentle gale. 
By this time I had got at a frightful distance from the island, 
and had the least cloudy or hazy weather intervened, I had 
been undone another way, too ; for I had no compass on board, 
and should never have known how to have steered towards the 
island, if I had but once lost sight of it ; but the weather con- 
tinuing clear, I applied myself to get up my mast again, and 
spread my sail, standing away to the north as much as possible, 
to get out of the current. 

Just as I had set my mast and sail, and the boat began to 
stretch away, I saw by the clearness of the water some alter- 
ation of the current was near ; and presently I found to the 
cast, at about half a mile, a breach of the sea upon some rocks : 
these rocks caused the current to part again, and as the main 
stress of it ran away more southerly, leaving the rocks to the. 
north-cast, so the other returned by the repulse of the rocks,' 
and made a strong eddy, which ran back again to the north- 
west, with a very sharp stream. 

They who know what it is to have a reprieve brought to 
them upon the ladder, or to be rescued from thieves just going 
to murder them, or who have been in such extremities, may 
guess what my present surprise of jov was, and how gladly I 
put my boat into tlie stream of this eddy; and the wind also 
freshening, how gladly I spread my sail to it, running cheer- 



EOBINSON CKUSOE. 113 

fully before the wind, and with a strong tide or eddy under 
foot. 

This eddy carried me about, a league in my way back again, 
directly towards the island, but about two leagues more to the 




PACE 146. 



northward than the current winch carried me away at first; so 
that when I came near the island, I found mvsolf open to the 
northern shore of it, that is to say, the other end of the island, 
opposite to that which I went out from. 

When I had made something more than a league of way bv 
Mio help of this eddy, I found it was spent, and served me no

farther. However, being between two great currents in the 
wake of the island, I found the water at least still, and running 
no way ; and having still a breeze of wind fair for me, I kept 
on steering directly for the island, and in about an hour came 
within about a mile of the shore, where, it being smooth water, 
J soon got to land. 

When I was on shore, I fell on my knees, and gave God 
thanks for my deliverance, resolving to lay aside all thoughts 
of my deliverance by my boat; and refreshing myself with such 
things as I had, I brought my boat close to the shore, in a 
little cove that I had spied under some trees, and laid me down 
to sleep, being quite spent with the labour and fatigue of the 
voyage. 

I was now at a great loss which way to get home with my 
boat ; I had run so much hazard, and knew too much of the 
case, to think of attempting it by the way I went out ; so I 
resolved on the next morning to make my way westward along 
the shore, and to see if there was no creek where I might lay 
up my frigate in safety, so as to have her again, if I wanted her. 
In about three miles, I came to a very good inlet or bay, about 
a mile over, which narrowed till it came to a very little rivulet 
or brook, where I found a very convenient harbour for my 
boat, and where she lay as if she had been in a little dock 
made on purpose for her. Here I put in, and having stowed 
my boat very safe, I went on shore to look about me, and see 
where I was. 

I soon found I had but a little passed by the place where I 
had been before, when I travelled on foot to that shore ; so 
taking nothing out of my boat but my gun and umbrella, for 
it was exceedingly hot, I began my march. The way was 
comfortable enough after such a voyage as I had been upon, 
and I reached my old bower in the evening, where I found 
everything standing as I had left it. 

I got over the fence, and laid me down in the shade to rest 
my limbs, for I was very weary, and fell asleep ; but judge 
you, if you can, that read my story, what a surprise I must be 
in, when I was awaked out of my sleep by a voice, calling me 
by my name several times, "Hoi, in, Robin, Eobin Crusoe; 
poor Robin Crusoe! Where are you, Robin Crusoe? Where 
are you ? Where have you been ?' 1 was so dead asleep at first, 
being fatigued with rowing the first part of the dav, and with 



ROBINSON CEUSOE. 115 

walking the latter part, that I did not wake thoroughly; but 
dozing between sleeping and waking, thought I dreamed that 
somebody spoke to me ; but as the voice continued to repeat 
" Robin Crusoe, Eobin Crusoe," at last I began to wake more 
perfectly, and was at first dreadfully frightened, and started 
up in the utmost consternation ; but no sooner were my eye3 
open, but I saw my Poll sitting on the top of the hedge ; and 
immediately knew that it was he that spoke to me; for just 
in such bemoaning language I had used to talk to him, and 
teach him : and he had learned it so perfectly that he would 
sit upon my finger, and lay his bill close to my face, and cry, 
"Poor Robin Crusoe! Where are you? Where have you 
been? How came you here?" and such things as I had taught 
him. 

However, even though I knew it was the parrot, and that 
indeed it could be nobody else, it was a good while before I 
could compose myself. First, I was amazed how the creature 
got thither ; and then, how he should just keep about the 
place, and nowhere else ; but as I was well satisfied it could 
bo nobody but honest Poll, I got over it ; and holding out my 
hand, and calling him by his name, "Poll," the sociable crea- 
ture came to me, and sat upon my thumb, as he used to do, 
and continued talking to me, "Poor Robin Crusoe! and how 
did I come here ? and where had I been V just as if he had 
been overjoyed to see me again ; and so I carried him home 
along with me. 

I had now had enough of rambling to sea for some time, and 
had enough to do for many days, to sit still, and reflect upon 
the danger I had been in. I would have been very glad to 
have had my boat again on my side of the island ; butl knew 
not how it was practicable to get it about. I contented myself 
to be without any boat, though it had been the product of so 
many months' labour to make it, and of so many more to get it 
into the sea. 

In tins government of my temper, I remained near a year; 
and lived a vow sedate, retired life, as you may well suppose ; 
and my thoughts being very much composed as to my condition, 
and fully comforted in resigning myself to the dispositions of 
Providence, I thought I lived really very happily in ail tilings, 
except that of society. 

1 unproved myself in this time in all the mechanic exercises 



116 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

■which my necessities put mo upon applying myself to ; and I 
believe I should, upon occasion, have made a very good car- 
penter, especially considering how few tools I had. 

Besides this, I arrived at an unexpected perfection in my 
earthenware, and contrived well enough to make them with a 
wheel, which I found infinitely easier and better ; because I 
made things round and shaped, which before were filthy thing* 
indeed to look on. But I think I was never more vain of my 
own performance, or more joyful for anything I found out, than 
for my being able to made a tobacco-pipe ; and though it was 
a very ugly, clumsy thing when it was done, and only burned 
red, like other earthenware, yet as it was hard and firm, and 
would draw the smoke, I was exceedingly comforted with it, 
for I had been always used to smoke ; and there were pipes in 
the ship, but I forgot them at first, not thinking that there was 
tobacco in the island ; and afterwards, when I searched the- 
ship again, I could not come at any pipes. 

In my wiekerware, also, I improved much, and made abun- 
dance of necessary baskets, as well as my invention showed 
mie'; though not very handsome, yet they were such as were- 
Tory handy and convenient for laying things up in, er fetching 
things home. Also, large deep baskets were the receivers of 
my corn, which I always rubbed out as soon as it was dry, and 
cured, and kept it in great baskets. 

I began now to perceive that my powder abated considerably: 
this was a want which it was impossible for me to supplv, and 
I began seriously to consider what I must do when I should 
have no more powder ; that is to say, how I should kill any 
goats. I had, in the third year of my being here, kept a 
young kid, and bred her up tame, and I was in hopes of getting 
a he-goat: but I could not by any means bring it to pass, till 
my kid grew an old goat ; and as I could never find in my 
heart to kill her, she died at Lost of mere age. 

But being now in the eleventh year of my residence, and my 
ammunition growing low, I sot myself to studv some art to 
trap and snare the goats, to see whether I couhfnot catch some- 
of them alive ; and particularly, I wanted a she-goat great 
with young. For this purpose, I made snares to hamper them; 
but my tackle was not good, for I had no wire, and I always 
found them broken, and my bait devoured. At length, I re- 
solved to try a pitfall: s\> i dug several large pits in the earth, 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 117 

in plaees where I had observed the goats used to feed, and over 
those pits I placed hurdles, of my own making too, with a 
great weight upon them ; and several times I put ears of barley 
and dry rice, without setting the trap ; and I could easily per- 
ceive that the goats had gone in and eaten up the corn, for I 
could see the marks of their feet. At length, I set three traps 
in one night, and going the next morning, I found them all 
standing, and yet the bait eaten and gone: this was very dis- 
couraging. However, I altered my traps : and, not to trouble 
you with particulars, going one morning to see my traps, I 
found in one of them a large old he-goat ; and in one of the 
others, three kids, a male and two females. 

As to the old one, I knew not what to do with him ; ho was 
so fierce, I durst not go into the pit to him, to bring him 
away alive, which was what I wanted ° so I even let him out, 
and he ran away as if he had been frightened out of his wits. 
But I did not then know what I afterwards learned, that 
hunger will tame a lion. If I had let him stay there three or 
four clays without food, and then have carried him some water 
to drink, and then a little corn, he would have been as tame as 
one of the kids ; for they are mighty sagacious, tractable crea- 
tures, where they are well used. 

However, for the present I let him go, knowing no better at 
that time: then I went to the three kids, and, taking them one 
by one, I tied them with strings together, and with somo 
diinculty brought them all home. 

It was a good while before they would feed ; but throwing 
them some sweet corn, it tempted them, and they began to be 
tame. And now I found that if I expected to supply myself 
with goats' flesh, when I had no powder or shot left, breeding 
some up tame was my only way, when, perhaps, 1 might have 
them about my house like a flock of sheep. But, then, it 
occurred to me that I must keep the tamo from the wild, or 
else they would ahvays^un wild when they grew up; and the 
only way for this was to have somo enclosed piece of ground, 
-well fenced either with hedge or pale, to keep them in so effect- 
ually, that those within might not break out, or those without 
break in. 

This was a great undertaking for one pair of hands ; yet, as I 
saw there was an absolute necessity for doing it, my first work was 
to find out a proper piece of ground, where there was likely to 



118 eobisson ci;u.s.)i:. 

be herbage for them to eat, water for them to drink, and cover 
to keep them from the sun. 

Those who understand such enclosures will think I had very 
little contrivance, when I pitched upon a place very proper for 
all these, which had two or three little drills of fresh water in 
it, and at one end was very woody, — they will smile at my 
forecast, when I shall tell them I began by enclosing this piece 
of ground in such a manner, that my hedge or pale must have 
been at least two miles about. Nor was the madness of it so 
great as to the compass, for if it was ten miles about, I was like 
to have time enough to do it in ; but I did not consider that 
my goats would be as wild in so much compass as if they had 
had the whole island, and I should have so much room to chase 
them in that I should never catch them. 

My hedge was begun and carried on, I believe, about fifty 
yards when this thought occurred to me ; so I presently stopped 
short, and, for the beginning, I resolved to enclose a piece of 
about one hundred and fifty yards in length, and one hundred 
yards in breadth, which, as it would maintain as many as I 
should have in any reasonable time, so, as my stock increased, 
I could add more ground to my enclosure. 

This was acting with some prudence, and I went to work 
with courage. I was about three months hedging in the first 
piece; and, till I had done it, I tethered the three kids in the 
best part of it, and used them to feed as near me as possible, 
to make them familiar ; and very often I would go and carry 
them some ears of barley and corn, or a handful of rice, and 
feed them out of my hand ; so that, after my enclosure was 
finished, and I let them loose, they would follow me up and 
down, bleating after me for a handful of corn. 

This answered my end, and in about a year and a half I had 
a flock of about twelve goats, kids and all; and in two years 
more I had thrce-and-forty, besides several that I took and 
killed for my food. After that, I enaJpsed five -everal pieces 
of ground to feed them in, with little pens to drive them into, 
to take them as I wanted, and gates out of one piece of 
ground into another. 

But this was not all ; for now I not only had goats' flesh to 
feed on when I pleased, but milk too, a thin-- which, indeed, 
in the beginning, I did not so much as thin!; of. and which, 
when it came into my thoughts, was really an a.reeable sur- 



K03INS0N CKU30E. 119 

prise, for now I set up my dairy, and had sometimes a gallon 
or two of milk in a day. And as Nature, who gives supplies 
of food to every creature, dictates even naturally how to make 
use of it, so I, that had never milked a cow, much less a goat, 
or seen butter or cheese made only when I was a boy, after a 
great many essays and miscarriages, made both butter and 
cheese at last, also salt (though I found it partly made to my 
hand by the heat of the sun upon some of the rocks of the 
sea), and never wanted it afterwards. 

It would have made a stoic smile to have seen me and my 
little family sit down to dinner. There was my majesty, the 
prince and lord of the whole island ; I had the lives of all my 
subjects at my absolute command ; I could hang, draw, give 
liberty, and take it away, and no rebels among my subjects. 
Then, to see how like a king I dined, too, all alone, attended 
by my servants! Poll, as if he had been my favourite, was the 
only person permitted to talk to me. My dog, who was now 
grown very old and crazy, and had found no species to mul- 
tiply his kind upon, sat always at my right hand, and two cats, 
one on one side of the table, and one on the other, expecting 
now and then a bit from my hand, as a mark of my special 
favour. 

But these were not the two cats which I brought on shore 
at first, for they were both of them dead, and had been in- 
terred near my habitation by my own hand ; but one of them 
having multiplied by I know not what kind of creature, these 
were two which I had preserved tame. With this attendance 
and in this plentiful manner I lived ; neither could I be said to 
want anything but society. 

I was something impatient to have the use of my bo at, 
though very loath to run any more hazards ; and therefore 
sometimes I sat contriving ways to get her about the island, 
and at other times I sat myself down contented enough with- 
out her. But I had a strange uneasiness in my mind to go 
down to the point of the island, where, in my last ramble, I 
went up the hill to see how the shore lay ; this inclination in- 
creased upon me every day, and at length I resolved to travel 
thither by land, following the edge of the shore. I did so ; 
but had anyone in England met such a man as I was, it must 
either have fiightened him, or raised a great deal of laughter ; 
and as I frequently stood still to look at myself, I could not 



120 eocinson cnusoi:. 

but smile at the notion of my travelling through Yorkshin 
with such an equipage, and in such a dress. Be pleased t> 
take a sketch of my figure as follows : — 

I had, a high shapeless cap, made of a goat's skin, with a flaj: 
hanging down behind, as well to keep the sun from me as tc 
shoot the rain off from running into my neck, nothing being sc 
hui^ful in these climates as the rain upon the- flesh under the 
clothes. 

I had a short jacket of goat's skin, the skirts coming down 
to about the middle of the thighs, and a pair of open-kneed 
breeches of the same ; the breeches were made of the skin oi 
an old he-goat, whose hair hung down such a length on either 
side, that, like pantaloons, it reached to the middle of my| 
legs ; stockings and shoes I had none, but had made mo a pair 
of somethings, I scarce know what to call them, like buskins, 
to flap over my legs, and lace on either side like spatterdashes, 
but of a most barbarous shape, as indeed were all the rest of 
my clothes. 

I had on a broad belt of goat's skin dried, which I drew 
together with two thongs of the same instead of buckles, and 
in a kind of a frog on either side of this, instead of a sword 
and dagger, hung a little saw and a hatchet, one on one side, 
and one on the other. I had another belt not so broad, and 
fastened in the same manner, which hung over my shoulder, 
and at the end of it, under my left arm, hung two pouches, 
both made of goat's skin too, in one of which hung my powder, 
in the other my shot. At my back I carried my basket, and 
on my shoulder my gun, and over my head a great clumsy, 
ugly, goat's skin umbrella, but which, after all, was the most 
necessary thing I had about me next to my gun. As for my 
face, the colour of it was really not so mulatto-like as one might 
expect from a man not at all careful of it, and living within 
nine or ten degrees of the equinox. My beard I had once 
suffered to grow till it was about a quarter of a yard long ; 
but as I had both scissors and razors sufficient, I had cut it 
pretty short, except what grew on my upper lip, which I had 
trimmed into a large pair of Mahometan whiskers, such as I had 
seen worn by some Turks at Sallce, for the Moors did net 
wear such, though the Turks did ; of these moustachios, or 
whiskers, I will not say they were long enough to hang my 
hat upon them, but they were of a length and shape mon-

strous enough, and such as in England would have passed for 
frightful. 

But all this is by the bye ; for, as to my figure, I had so few 
to observe me, that it was of no manner of consequence, so I 




l'AQE 156. 



say no more of that. In this kind of dress I went my new 
journey, and was out five or six days. I travelled first along 
the sea-shore, directly to the place where I first brought my 
boat to an anchor to get upon the rocks ; and having no boat 
now to take care of, I went over the land a nearer way to the 
same height that I was upon before, when, looking forward to 



124 



KOBINSOlf CRUSOE. 



hensive of being hurried out of my knowledge again by the 
currents or winds, or any other accident. But now I come to 
a new scene of my life. 

It happened one day, about noon, going towards my boat, I 
was exceedingly surprised with the print of a man's naked foot 
on the shore, which was very plain to be seen on the sand. I 
stood like one thunderstruck, or as if I had seen an apparition. 
I listened, I looked round me, but I could hear nothing nor 
see anything ; I went up to a rising ground, to look farther; 
I went up the shore, and down the shore, but it was all one: 
I could see no other impression but that one. I went to it 
again to see if there were any more, and to observe if it might 
not be my fancy ; but there was no room for that, for there 
was exactly the print of a foot — toes, heel, and every part of 
a foot. How it came thither I knew not, nor could I in the 
least imagine ; but after innumerable fluttering thoughts, like 
a man perfectly confused and out of myself, I came to my for- 
tification, not feeling, as Ave say, the ground I went on, but 
terrified to the last degree, looking behind me at every two 
or three steps, mistaking every bush and tree, and fancying 
every stump at a distance to be a man. 

When I came to my castle (for so I think I called it ever 
after this), I fled into it like one pursued. 

I slept none that night ; the farther I was from the occasion 
of my fright, the greater my apprehensions were. Sometimes 
I fancied it must be the devil, and reason joined in with me in 
this supposition, for how should any other thing in human 
shape come into the place ? Where was the vessel that brought 
them ? What marks were there of any other footstep ? And 
how was it possible a man should come there ? I considered 
that the devil might have found out abundance of other ways 
to have terrified me than this of the single print of a foot ; that 
as I lived quite on the other side of the island, he would never 
have been so simple as to leave a mark in a place where it was 
ten thousand to one whether I should ever see it or not, and 
in the sand too, which the first surge of the sea, upon a high 
wind, would have defaced entirely. All this seemed incon- 
sistent with the thing itself, and with all the notions we usually 
entertain of the subtilty ot the devil. 

While these reflections were rolling in my mind, I was very 
thankful in my thoughts, that I was so happy as not to be 



KOEIXSOX CKUSOE. 125' 

thereabouts at that time, or that they did not see my boat, by 
which they would have concluded that some inhabitants had 
been in the place, and perhaps have searched farther for me. 
Then terrible thoughts racked my imagination about their 
having found out my boat, and that there were people herej 
and that, if so, I should certainly have them come again in 
greater numbers, and devour me ; that if it should happen that 
they should not find me, yet they would find my enclosure, 
destroy all my corn, and carry away all my flock of tame 
goats, and I should perish at last for mere want. 

Thus my fear banished all my religious hope, all that former 
confidence in God, which was founded upon such wonderful 
experience as I had had of His goodness ; as if He that had 
fed me by miracle hitherto could not preserve, by His power, 
the provision which He had made for me by His goodness. I 
reproached myself with my laziness, that would not sow any 
more corn one year than would just serve me till the next 
season, as if no accident could intervene to prevent my enjoy- 
ing the crop that was upon the ground ; and this I thought so- 
just a reproof, that I l-esolved for the future to have two or 
three years' corn beforehand ; so that, whatever might come, I 
might not perish for want of bread. 

One morning early, lying in my bed, and filled with thoughts, 
about my danger from the appearances of savages, I found it 
discomposed me very much ; upon which these words of the 
Scripture came into my thoughts " Call upon me in the day 
of trouble, and I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me." 
Upon this, rising cheerfully out of my bed, my heart was not 
only comforted, but I was guided and encouraged to pray 
earnestly to God for deliverance : when I had done praying, 
I took up my Bible, and opening it to read, the first words 
that presented to me were, " Wait on the Lord, and be of good 
cheer, and he shall strengthen thy heart ; wait, I say, on the 
Lord." It is impossible to express the comfort this gave me. 
In answer, I thankfully laid down the book, and was no more 
sad, at least on that occasion. 

In the middle of these cogitations, apprehensions, and re- 
flection?, it came into my thoughts one day, that all this might 
be a mere chimera of my own, and that this foot might be the 
print of my own foot, when I came on shore from my boat; 
this cheered me up a little, too, and I began to persuade my- 



126 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

Self it was all a delusion ; that it was nothing else but my own 
foot ; and why might I not come that way from the boat, as 
well as I was going that way to the boat ? Again I considered 
also, that I could by no means tell, for certain, where I had 
trod, and where I had not ; and that if, at last, this was only 
the print of my own foot, I had played the part of those fools 
who try to make stories of spectres and apparitions, and then 
are frightened at them more than anybody. 

Now I began to take courage, and to peep abroad again, for 
I had not stirred out of my castle for three days and nights, 
so that I began to starve for provisions ; for I had little or 
nothing within doors but some barley-cakes and water : then 
I knew that my goats wanted to be milked too, which usually 
was my evening diversion ; and the poor creatures were in great 
pain and inconvenience for want of it ; and, indeed, it almost 
spoiled some of them, and almost dried up their milk. En- 
couraging myself, therefore, with the belief that this Avas 
nothing but the print of one of my own feet, and that I might 
be truly said to start at my own shadow, I began to go abroad 
again, and went to my country-house to milk my flock : but 
to see with what fear I went forward, how often I looked 
behind me, how I was ready, every now and then, to lay down 
my basket and run for my life, it would have made anyone 
have thought I was haunted with an evil conscience, or that 
I had been lately most terribly frightened ; and so, indeed, I 
had. However, I went down thus two or three days, and 
having seen nothing, I began to be a little bolder, and to think 
there was really nothing in it but my own imagination ; but I 
could not persuade myself fully of this till I should go down 
to the shore again, and see this print of a foot, and measure it 
by my own, and see if there was any similitude or fitness, that 
I might be assured it was my own foot : but when I came to 
the place — first, it appeared evidently to me, that when I laid 
up my boat, I could not possibly be on shore anywhere there- 
abouts : secondly, when I came to measure the mark with my 
own foot, I found my foot not so large by a great deal. Both 
these things filled my head with new imaginations, and gave 
me the vapours again to the highest degree, so that I shook 
with cold like one in an ague ; and I went home again, filled 
with the belief that some man or men, had been on shore there; 
or, in short, that the island was inhabited, and I might be 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 12/ 

surprised before I was aware ; and what course to take for my 
security I knew not. 

The first thing I proposed to myself was, to throw down my 
enclosures, and turn all my tame cattle wild into the woods, 
lest the enemy should find thera, and then frequent the island 
in prospect of the same or the like booty : then the simple 
thing of digging up my two corn fields, lest they should find 
such a grain there, and still be prompted to frequent the island: 
then to demolish my bower and tent, that they might not see 
any vestiges of habitation, and be prompted to look farther, in 
order to find out the persons inhabiting. 

These were the subjects of the first night's cogitations after 
I was come home again, while the apprehensions which had so 
overrun my mind were fresh upon me, and my head was full 
of vapours. 

This confusion of my thoughts kept me awake all night ; but 
in the morning I fell asleep ; and having, by the amusement of 
my mind, been, as it were, tired, and my spirits exhausted, I 
slept very soundly, and waked much better composed than I 
had ever been before. And now T began to think sedately; 
and, upon debate with myself, I concluded that this island 
(which was so exceedingly pleasant, fruitful, and no farther 
from the main land than as I had seen) was not so entirely 
abandoned as I might imagine ; that although there were no 
stated inhabitants who lived on the spot, yet that there might 
sometimes come boats off from the shore, who, either with 
design, or perhaps never but when they were driven by cross 
winds, might come to this place ; that I had lived here fifteen 
years now, and had not met with the least shadow or figure of 
any people yet ; and that, if at any time they should be driven 
here, it was probable they went away again as soon as ever 
they could, seeing they had never thought fit to fix here upon any 
occasion ; that the most I could suggest any danger from was, 
from any casual accidental landing of straggling people from 
the main, who, as it was likely, if they were driven hither, were 
here against their wills, so they made no stay here, but went 
off again with all possible speed; seldom staying one night on 
shore, lest they should not have the help of the tides and day- 
light back again ; and that, therefore, I had nothing to do but 
to consider of some safe retreat, in case I should see any savages 
land upon the spot. 



128 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 



Now I began sorely to repent that I had dug my cave so 
large as to bring a door through again, which door, as I said, 
came out beyond where my fortification joined to the rock : 
upon maturely considering this, therefore, I resolved to draw 
me a second fortification, in the same manner of a semicircle, 
at a distance from my wall, just where I had planted a double 
row of trees about twelve years before, of which I made 
mention: these trees having been planted so thick before, they 
wanted but few pile3 to be driven between them, that they 
might be thicker and stronger, and my wall would be soon 
finished. So that I now had a double wall ; and my outer 
wall was thickened with pieces of timber, old cables, and every- 
thing I could think of, to make it strong ; having in it seven 
little holes, about as big as I might put my arm out at. In the 
inside of this, I thickened my wall to about ten feet thick, with 
continually bringing earth out of my cave, and laying it at the 
foot of the wall, and walking upon it; and through the seven 
holes I contrived to plant the muskets, of which I took notice 
that I had got seven on shore out of the ship ; these I planted 
like my cannon, and fitted them into frames, that held them like 
a carriage, so that I could fire all the seven guns in two minutes' 
time; this wall I was many a weary month in finishing, and 
yet never thought myself safe till it was done. 

When this was done, I stuck all the ground without my wall, 
for a great length every way, as full with stakes or sticks of the 
osier-like wood, which I found so apt to grow, as they could 
well stand ; insomuch, that I believe I might set in near twenty 
thonsand of them, leaving a pretty large space between them 
and my wall, that I might have room to see an enemy, and they 
might have no shelter from the young trees, if they attempted 
to approach my outer wall. 

Thus, in two years' time, I had a thick grove; and in five 
or six years' time I had a wood before my dwelling, growing 
so monstrously thick and strong that it was indeed perfectly 
impassable : and no men, of what kind soever, could ever 
imagine that there was anything beyond it, much less a habita- 
tion. As for the way which I proposed to myself to go in and 
out (for I left no avenue), it was by setting two ladders, one to 
apart of the rock which was low, and then broke in, and left 
room to place another ladder upon that; so when the two 
ladders were taken down, no man living could come down to 



ROBrXSON CRUSOE.

jae without doing himself mischief; and if they had come downs 
thoy were still on the outside of my outer wall. 

Thus I took all the measures human prudence could sugget, 
for ray own preservation ; and it will he seen, at length, that

they were not altogether without just reason ; though I foresaw 
nothing at that time more than my mere fear suggested to 
me. 

While this was doing, I was not altogether careless of my 
other affairs ; for I had a great concern upon me for my little 
herd of goats : they were not only a ready supply to me on

130 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

every occasion, and began to be sufficient for me, ■without the 
expense of powder and shot, but also without the fatigue of 
hunting after the -wild ones ; and I was loath to lose the ad- 
vantage of them, and to have them all to nurse up over again. 

For this purpose, after long consideration, I could think of 
but two ways to preserve them ; one was, to find another con- 
venient place to dig a cave under ground, and to drive them 
into it every night ; and the other was to inclose two or three 
little bits of land, remote from one another, and as much con- 
cealed as I could, where I might keep about half a dozen young 
goats in each place ; so that if any disaster happened to the 
flock in general, I might be able to raise them again with little 
trouble and time : and this, though it would require a good 
deal of time and labour, I thought was the most rational 
design. 

Accordingly, I spent some time to find out the most retired 
parts of the island ; and I pitched upon one, which was as 
j>rivate, indeed, as my heart could wish lor : it was a little damp 
piece of ground, in the middle of the hollow and thick woods, 
where I almost lost myself once before, endeavouring to come 
back that way from the eastern part of the island. Here I 
found a clear piece of land, near three acres, so surrounded 
with woods, that it was almost an inclosure by nature ; at least, 
it did not want near so much labour to make it so, as the other 
piece of ground I had worked so hard at. 

I immediately went to work with this piece of ground ; and, 
in less than a month's time, I had so fenced it round that my 
flock were well enough secured in it ; so, without any further 
delay, I removed ten young she-goats, and two he-goats, to 
this piece ; and, when they were there, I continued to perfect 
the fence, till I had made it as secure as the other ; which, 
however, I did at more leisure, and it took me up more time 
by a great deal. All this labour I was at the expense of, 
purely from my apprehensions on the account of the print of a 
man's foot ; for, as yet, I had never seen any human creature 
come near the island ; and I had now lived two years under 
this uneasiness, which, indeed, made my life much less comfortable 
than it was before, as may be well imagined by any who 
know what it is to live in the constant snare of the fear of. 
man. 



ROBINSON CRUGOE. 131 

After I had thus secured one part of my little living stocks 
I went about the -whole island, searching for another private 
place to make such another deposit ; when, wandering more 
to the v.-est point of the island than I had ever done yet, and 
looking out to sea, I thought I saw a boat upon the sea, at a 
great distance. I had found a perspective glass or two in one 
of the seamen's chests, which I saved out of our ship, but I had 
it not about me ; and this was so remote that I could not tell 
what to make of it, though I looked at it till my eyes were not 
able to hold to look any longer ; whether it was a boat or nor, 
I do not know, but as T descended from the hill I could see no 
more of it, so I gave it over ; only I resolved to go no more 
out without a perspective glass in my pocket. Yv hen I was 
come down the hill to the end of the island, where, indeed, I 
had never been before, I was presently convinced that the seeing 
the print of a man's foot was not such a strange tiling in the 
island as I imagined : but that it was a special providence 
that I was cast upon the side of the island where the savages 
never came, I should easily have known that nothing was more 
frequent than for the canoes from the main, when they hap- 
pened to be a little too far out at sea, to shoot over to that side 
of the island for harbour : likewise, as they often mot and 
fought in their canoes, the victors, having taken any prisoners, 
would bring them over to this shore, where, according to their 
dreadful customs, being all cannibals, they would kill and eat 
them. 

When I was come down the hill to the shore, I was perfectly 
confounded and amazed ; nor is it possible for me to express 
the horror of my mind, at seeing the shore spread with skulls, 
hands, feet, and other bones of human bodies ; and particu- 
larly, I observed a place where there had been a fire made, and 
a circle dug in the earth, like a cockpit, where I supposed the 
savage wretches had sat down to their inhuman feastings upon 
the bodies of their fellow-creatures. 

I was so astonished with the sight of these things, that I 
entertained no notions of any danger to myself from it for a 
long while ; all my apprehensions were buried in the thoughts 
of such a pitch of inhuman, hellish brutality, and the horror 
of the degeneracy of human nature, which, though I had heard 
of it often, yet I never had so near a view of before ; in 



loZ ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

short, I turned away my face from the horrid spectacle, and 
with all the speed" I could, walked on towards my own 
habitation. 

When I came a little out of that part of the island, I stood 
still awhile, as amazed, and then recovering myself, I looked 
up with the utmost affection of my soul, and, with a flood of 
tears in my eyes, gave God thanks, that had cast my first lot 
in a part of the world where I was distinguished from such 
dreadful creatures as these ; and that, though I had esteemed 
my present condition very miserable, had yet given me so many 
comforts in it that I had still more to give thanks for than to 
complain of. 

In this frame of thankfulness, I went home to my castle, and 
began to be much easier now, as to the safety of my circum- 
stances, than ever I was before : for I observed that these 
wretches never came to this island in search of what they could 
get ; perhaps not seeking, wanting, or expecting, anything 
here; and having often, no doubt, been up in the covered, 
■woody part of it, without finding anything to their purpose. 
I knew I had been here now almost eighteen years, and never 
saw the least footsteps of human creature there before ; and I 
might be eighteen years more as entirely concealed as I was 
now, if I did not discover myself to them, which I had no 
manner of occasion to do ; it being my only business to keep 
myself entirely concealed where I was, unless I found a better 
sort of creatures than cannibals to make myself known to. 
Yet I entertained such an abhorrence of the savage wretches 
that I have been speaking of, and of the wretched, inhuman 
custom of their devouring and eating one another up, that I 
continued pensive and sad, and kept close within my own circle, 
for almost two years after this. I did not so much as go to 
look after my boat all this time, but began rather to think of 
making another ; for I could not think of ever making 
any more attempts to bring the other boat round the island to 
me, lest I should meet with some of these creatures at sea. 

Time, however, and the satisfaction I had that I was in no 
danger of being discovered by these people, began to wear off 
my uneasiness about them ; and I began to live just in the same 
composed manner as before, only with this difference, that I 
used more caution, and kept my eyes more about me, lest I should 
happen to be seen by any of them ; and particularly, I was 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 133 

more cautious of firing my gun, lest any of them, being on the 
island, should happen to hear it. It was, therefore, a very good 
providence to me that I had furnished myself with a tame breed 
of goats, and that I had no need to hunt any more about the 
■woods, or shoot at them ; and if I did catch any of them after 
this, it was by snares and traps, as I had done before : so that 
for two years after this, I believe I never fired my gun once off, 
though I never went out without it ; and, what was more, as 
I had saved three pistols out of the ship, I always carried them 
out with me, or at least two of them, sticking them in my goat- 
skin belt. I also furbished up one of the great cutlasses that I 
had out of the ship, and made me a belt to hang it on also ; so 
that I was now a most formidable fellow to look at when I went 
abroad, if you add to the former description of myself, the par- 
ticular of two pistols, and a great broad-sword hanging at my 
side in a belt, but without a scabbard. 

As in my present condition there were not really many 
things which I wanted, so, indeed, I thought that the frights 
I had been in about these savage wretches, and the concern I 
had been in for my own preservation, had taken off the edge of 
my invention for my own conveniences ; and I had dropped a 
good design, which I had once bent my thoughts too much 
upon, and that was to try if I could not make some of my barley 
into malt, and then try to brew myself some beer. This was 
really a whimsical thought, and I reproved myself often for the 
simplicity of it: for I presently saw there would be the want 
of several things necessary to the making my beer, that it 
would be impossible for me to supply ; as, first, casks to pre- 
serve it in, which was a thing that, as I have observed already, 
I could never compass : no, though I spent not only many days, 
but weeks, nay months, in attempting it, but to no purpose. 
In the next place, I had no hops to make it keep, no yeast to 
make it work, no copper or kettle to make it boil ; and yet 
1 with all these things wanting, I verily believe, had not the 
frights and terrors I was in about the savages intervened, I had 
undertaken it, and perhaps brought it to pass, too ; for I seldom 
gave anything over without accomplishing it, when once I had 
it in my head to begin it. Eut my invention now ran quite 
another way ; for, night and day, 1 could think of nothing but 
how I might destroy some of these monsters in their cruel, 
bloody entertainment j and ? if possible, gave the victim they 



131 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

should bring hither to destroy. But what could one man do 
among them, when perhaps there might be twenty or thirty of 
them together, with their darts, or their bows and arrows, 
with which they could shoot as true to a mark as I could with 
my gun ? 

While my mind was thus filled with thoughts of revenge and 
a bloody putting twenty or thirty of them to the sword, as I 
may call it, the horror I had at the place, and at the signals of 
the barbarous wretches devouring one another, abetted my 
malice. Well, at length I found a place in the side of the hill, 
where I was satisfied I might securely wait till I saw any of 
their boats coming ; and might then, even before they would 
be ready to come on shore, convey myself unseen into some 
thickets of trees, in one of which there was a hollow large 
enough to conceal me entirely ; and there I might sit and ob- 
serve all their bloody doings, and take my full aim at their 
heads, when they were so close together as that it would be 
next to impossible that I should miss my shot, or that I could 
fail wounding three or four of them at the first shot. In this 
place then, I resolved to fulOl my design ; and accordingly, I 
prepared two muskets and my ordinary fowling-piece. The 
two muskets I loaded with a brace of slugs each, and four or 
five smaller bullets, about the size of pistol bullets ; and the 
fowling-piece I loaded with near a handful of swan-shot of the 
largest size; I also loaded my pistols with about four bullets 
each ; and, in this posture, well provided with ammunition for 
a second and third charge, I prepared myself for my expedition. 

After I had thus laid the scheme of my design, I made my tour 
every morning to the top of the hill, to see if I could observe 
any boats upon the sea, coming near the island, or standing 
over towards it ; but I began to tire of this hard duty, after I 
had for two or three months constantly kept my watch, but 
came always back without any discovery ; there having not, in 
all that time, been the least appearance, not only ©n or near 
the shore, but on the whole ocean, so far as my eye* or glass 
could reach every way. 

As long as I kept my daily tour to the hill to look out, so 
long also I kept up the vigour of my design, and my spirits 
seemed to be all the while in a suitable form for so outrageous 
an execution as the killing twenty or thirty naked savages, for 
au offence which I had not at all entered into any discussion 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 135 

of in my thoughts, any farther than my passions were at first 
fired by the horror I conceived at the unnatural customs of the 
people of that country. But now, when I began to bo weary 
of the fruitless excursion which I had made so long and so far 
every morning in vain, so my opinion of the action itself began 
to alter; and I began, with cooler and calmer thoughts, to 
consider what I was going to engage in ; what authority or 
call I had to pretend to be judge and executioner upon these 
men as criminals, whom Heaven had thought fit, for so many 
ages, to suffer to go on unpunished, and to be, as it were, the 
executioners of His judgments one upon another; how far these 
people were offenders against me, and what right I had to en- 
gage in the quarrel of that blood which they shed promiscuously 
upon one another. 

When I considered this a. little, it followed necessarily that 
I was certainly in the wrong ; that these people were not mur- 
derers in the sense that I had before condemned them in my 
thoughts, any more than those Christians were murderers who 
often put to death the prisoners taken in battle; or more fre- 
quently, upon many occasions, put whole troops of men to the 
sword, without giving quarter, though they threw down their 
arms and submitted. 

These considerations really put me to a pause, and to a kind 
of a full stop ; and I began, by little and little, to be off my 
design, and to conclude I had taken wrong measures in my 
resolution to attack the savages ; and that it was not my 
business to meddle with them, unless they first attacked me ; 
and this it was my business, if possible, to prevent : but that, if 
I were discovered and attacked by them, I knew my duty. 

In this disposition I continued for near a year after this; 
and so far was I from desiring an occasion for falling upon 
these wretches, that in all that time I never once went up the 
hill to see whether there were any of them in sight, or to know 
whether any of them had been on shore or not, that I might 
not be tempted to renew any of my contrivances against them, 
or be provoked by any advantage that might present itself, to 
fall upon them: only this I did; I went and removed my boat» 
which I had on the other side of the island, and carried it down 
to the east end of the whole island, where I ran it into a little 
cove, which I found under some high rocks, and where I knew, 
by reason of the currents, the savages durst not, at least would 



136 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

not, come with their boats on any account whatever. With 
my boat I carried away everything that I had left there be- 
longing to her, though not necessary for the bare going thither, 
viz., a mast and sail which I had made for her, and a thing like 
an anchor, but which indeed could not be called either anchor 
or grapnel; however, it was the best I could make of its kind; 
all these I removed, that there might not be the least shadow 
for discovery, or appearance of any boat, or of any human 
habitation upon the island. Besides this, I kept myself more 
retired than ever, and seldom went from my cell except upon 
my constant employment, to milk my she-goats, and manage 
my little flock in the wood, which, as it was quite on the other 
part of the island, was out of danger. 

I believe the reader of this will not think it strange, if I con- 
fess, that these anxieties, these constant dangers I lived in, 
and the concern that was now upon me, put an end to all in- 
vention, and to all the contrivances that I had laid for my 
future accommodations and conveniences. I had the care of 
my safety more now upon my hands than that of r.iy food. I 
cared not to drive a nail, or chop a stick of wood now, for fear 
the noise I might make should be heard : much less would I 
fire a gun for the same reason : and, above all, I was intoler- 
ably uneasy at making any fire, lest the smoke, which is visible 
at a great distance in the day, should betray me. For this 
reason, I removed that part of my business which required fire, 
such as burning of pots and pipes, &c, into my new apartment 
in the woods; where, after I had been some time, I found to 
my unspeakable consolation, a mere natural cave in the earth, 
which went in a vast way, and where, I dare say, no savage, 
had he been at the mouth of it, would be so hardy as to 
venture in. 

The mouth of this hollow was at the bottom of a great 
rock, where, by mere accident (I would say, if I did not see 
abundant reason to ascribe all such things now to Providence), 
I was cutting down some thick branches of trees to make 
charcoal ; and before I go on I must observe the reason of 
my making this charcoal, which was thus : I was afraid of 
making a smoke about my habitation, as I said before : and 
yet I could not live there without baking my bread, cooking 
my meat, &c, so I contrived to burn some wood here, as I 
had seen done in England, under turf, till it became chark or 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 



137 



dry coal : and then putting the fire out, I preserved the coal 
to carry home, and perform the other services for which fire 
was wanting, without danger of smoke. But this is by the 
bye. While I was cutting down some wood here, I perceived 







Page 160. 

that, behind a very thick branch of low brushwood or under- 
wood, there was a kind of hollow place : I was curious to look 
in it, and getting with difficulty into the mouth of it, I found 
it was sufficient for me to stand upright in it, and perhaps 
another with me ; but I must confess to you that I made more 
haste out than I did in, when, looking farther into the place, 



138 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

and which was perfectly dark, I saw two broad shining eyes 
of some creature, whether devil or man I knew not, which 
twinkled like two stars ; the dim light from the cave's mouth 
shining directly in, and making the reflection. However, 
after some pause, I recovered myself, and began to call myself 
a thousand fools, and to think that he that was afraid to see 
the devil, was not fit to live twenty years in an island all 
alone ; and that I might well think there was nothing in this 
cave that was more frightful than myself. Upon this, plucking 
up my courage, I took tip a firebrand, and in I rushed again, 
with the stick flaming in ray hand : I had not gone three steps 
in, before I was almost as much frightened as before ; for I 
heard a very loud sigh, like that of a man in some pain, and 
it was followed by a broken noise, as of words half expressed, 
and then a deep sigh again. I stepped back, and was indeed 
struck with such a surprise that it put me into a cold sweat, 
and if I had had a hat on my head, I will not answer for if 
that my hair might not have lifted it off. But still plucking 
up my spirits as well as I could, and encouraging myself a 
little with considering that the power and presence of God 
was everywhere, and was able to protect me, I stepped forward 
again, and by the light of the firebrand, holding it up a little 
over my head, I saw lying on the ground a monstrous, 
frightful, old he-goat, just making his will, as we say, and 
gasping for life, and dying, indeed, of mere old age. I stirred 
him a little to see if I eould get him out, and he essayed to 
get up, but was not able to raise himself ; and I thought with 
myself he might even lie there, — for if he had frightened me, 
so he would certainly fright any of the savages, if any one of 
them should be so hardy as to come in there while he had 
any life in him. 

I was now recovered from my surprise, and began to look 
round me, when I found the cave was but very small, — it 
might be about twelve feet over, but in no manner of shape, 
neither round nor square, no hands having ever been em- 
ployed in making it but those of mere Nature. I observed 
also that there was a place at the farther side of it that went 
in further, but was so low that it required me to creep upon 
my hands and knees to go into it, and whither it went I know 
not ; so, having no candle, I gave it over for that time, but 
resolved to come again the next day provided with candles 



EOBIXSOX CEUoOE. 139 

and a tinder-box, which I had made of the lock of one of the 
muskets, with some wildfire in the pan. 

Accordingly, the next day I came provided with six large 
candles of my own making (for I made very good candles now 
of goats' tallow, but was hard set for candle-wick, using 
sometimes rags or rope-yarn, and sometimes the dried rind of 
a weed like nettles) ; and going into this low place I was 
obliged to creep upon all-fours, almost ten yards, — which, by 
the way, I thought was a venture bold enough, considering 
that I knew not how far it might go, nor what was beyond it. 
When I had got through the strait, I found the roof rose 
higher up, I believe near twenty feet ; but never was such a 
glorious sight seen in the island, I dare say, as it was to look 
round the sides and roof of this vault or cave — the wall re- 
flected a hundred thousand lights to me from my two candles. 
What it was in the rock, — whether diamonds or any other 
precious stones, or gold, — which I rather supposed it to be,— 
I knew not. The place I was in was a most delightful cavity, 
or grotto, though perfectly dark ; the floor was dry and level, 
and had a sort of a small loose gravel upon it, so that there 
was no nauseous or venomous creature to be seen, neither 
was there any damp or wet on the sides or roof; the only 
difficulty in it was the entrance, — which, however, as it was 
a place of security, and such a retreat as I wanted, I thought 
was a convenience, — so that I was really rejoiced at the dis- 
covery, and resolved, without any delay, to bring some of 
those things which I was most anxious about to this place ; 
particularly, I resolved to bring hither my magazine of powder, 
and all my spare arms, viz., tw r o fowling-pieces — for I had 
three in all — and three muskets — for of them I had eight in 
all; so I kept in my castle only five, which stood ready 
mounted like pieces of cannon on my outmost fence, and were 
ready also to take out upon any expedition. Upon this 
occasion of removing my ammunition I happened to open the 
barrel of powder Avhich I took up out of the sea, and which 
had been wet, and I found that the water had penetrated 
about three or four inches into the powder on every side. 
which caking and growing hard, had preserved the inside 
like a kernel in the shell, so that I had near sixty pounds ot 
very good powder in the centre of the cask. This was a very 
agreeable discovery to mo at that time ; so I carried all awaj 



140 .ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

thither, never keeping above two or three pounds of powder 
with me in my castle, for fear of a surprise of any kind ; I 
also carried thither all the lead I had left for bullets. 

I fancied myself now like one of the ancient giants who 
were said to live in caves and holes in the rocks, where none 
could come at them ; for I persuaded myself, while I was 
here, that if five hundred savages were to hunt me, they 
could never find me out — or if they did, they would not 
venture to attack me here. The old goat whom I found 
expiring died in the mouth of the cave the next day after I 
made this discovery; and I found it much easier to dig a 
great hole there, and throw him in and cover him with earth, 
than to drag him out ; so I interred him there. 

I was now in the twenty-third year of my residence in this 
island, and was so naturalized to the place and the manner 
of living, that, could I but have enjoyed the certainty that 
no savages would come to the place to disturb me, I could 
have been content to have capitulated for spending the rest 
of my time there, even to the last moment, till I had laid me 
down and died, like the old goat in the cave. I had also 
arrived to some little diversions and amusement?, which 
made the time pass a great deal more pleasantly with me than 
it did before; — first, I had taught my Poll, as I named be- 
fore, to speak; and he did it so familiarly, and talked so 
articulately and plain, that it was very pleasant to me, for I 
believe no bird ever spoke plainer, — and he lived with me no 
less than six-and-twenty years; how long he might have 
lived afterwards I know not, though I know they have a 
notion in the Brazils that they live a hundred years. My dog 
was a pleasant and loving companion to me for no less than 
sixteen years of my time, and then died of mere old age. As 
for my cats, they multiplied to that degree, that I was obliged 
to shoot several of them at first, to keep them from devour- 
ing me and all I had; but, at length, when the two old ones 
I brought with me were gone, and after some time continually 
driving them from me, and letting them have no provision 
with me, they all ran wild into the woods, except two or 
three favourites, which I kept tame, and whose young, when 
they had any, I always drowned ; and these were part of my 
family. Besides these, I also kept two or three household 
kids about me, whom I taught to feed out of my hand ; and I 



KOBIXSOX CRUSOE. 141 

had two more parrots, which talked pretty well, and would 
all call <: Kobinson Crusoe," but none like my first; nor, in- 
deed, did I take the pains with any of them that I had done 
with him. I had also several tame sea-fowls, whose names I 
knew not, that I caught upon the shore, and cut their wings; 
and the little stakes which I had planted before my castle- 
wall being now grown up to a good thick grove, these fowls 
all lived among these low trees, and bred there, which was 
very agreeable to me, — so that I began to be very well con- 
tented with the life I led, if I could have been secured from 
the dread of the savages. But it was otherwise directed. 

It was now the month of December, in my twenty-third 
year ; and this being the southern solstice (for winter I can- 
not call it), was the particular time of my harvest, and 
required me to be pretty much abroad in the fields, when, 
going out early in the morning, even before it was thorough 
daylight, I was surprised with seeing a light of some fire 
upon the shore, at a distance from me of about two miles, 
towards that part of the island where I had observed some 
savages had been, as before, and not on the other, side; but, 
to my great affliction, it was on my side of the island. 

I was indeed terribly surprised at the sight, and stopped 
short within my grove, not daring to go out, lest I might be 
surprised; and yet I had no more peace within, from the 
apprehensions I had that if these savages, in rambling over 
the island, should find my corn standing or cut, or any of my 
works and improvements, they would immediately conclude 
that there were people in the place, and would then never 
rest till they had found me out. In this extremity I went 
back directly to my castle, pulled up the ladder after me, 
and made all things without look as wild and natural as I 
could. 

Then I prepared myself within, putting myself in a pos- 
ture of defence ; I loaded all my muskets, which Avere mounted 
upon my new fortification, and all my pistols, and resolved to 
defend myself to the last gasp, — not forgetting seriously to 
commend myself to the divine protection, and earnestly to 
pray to God to deliver me out of the hands of the barbarians. 
I continued in this posture about two hours, and began to be 
impatient for intelligence abroad, for I had no spies to send 
out. After sitting awhile longer, and musing what I should 



142 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

do in this case, I was not able to bear sitting in ignorance any 
longer; so setting up my ladder to the side of the hill, where 
there was a fiat place, and then pulling the ladder after me, I 
set it up again, and mounted the top of the hill, and pulling 
out my perspective-glass, which I had taken on purpose, I 
laid me down fiat on my belly on the ground, and began to 
look for the place. I presently found there were no less than 
nine naked savages, sitting round a small, fire they had made, 
not to warm them, for they had no need of that, the weather 
being extremely hot, but, as I supposed, to dress some of 
their barbarous diet of human flesh which they had brought 
with them. 

They had two canoes with them, which they had hauled up 
upon the shore ; and it was then ebb of tide, they seemed to 
me to wait for the return of the flood to go away again. It 
is not easy to imagine what confusion this sight put me into, 
especially seeing them come on my side of the island, and so 
near to me; but when I considered their coming must be 
always with the current of the ebb, I began afterwards to be 
more sedate in my mind, being satisfied that I might go 
abroad with safety all the time of the flood of tide, if they 
were not on shore before ; and having made this observation, 
I went abroad about my harvest work with the more com- 
posure. 

As I expected, so it proved ; for, as soon as the tide made 
to the westward, I saw them all take boat and row away. I 
should have observed, that for an hour or more before they 
went off they were dancing, and I could easily discern their 
postures and gestures by my glass. 

As soon as I saw them shipped and gone, I took two guns 
upon my shoulders, and two pistols in my girdle, and my 
great sword by my side without a scabbard, and with all the 
speed I was able to make went away to the hill where I had 
discovered the first appearance of all ; and as soon as I got 
thither, I perceived there had been three canoes more of the 
savages at that place ; and looking out farther, I saw they 
were all at sea together, making over for the main. This 
was a dreadful sight to me, especially as, going down to the 
shore, I could see the marks of horror which the dismal work 
they had been about had left behind it, I was so filled with 
indignation at the sight, that I now began to premeditate the 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 143 

destruction of the next that I saw there, let them be whom. 
or how many soever. It seemed evident to me that the visits 
which they made thus to this island were not very frequent, 
for it was above fifteen months before any more of them came 
on shore there again — that is to say, I neither saw them nor 
any footsteps or signals of them in all that time; yet all this 
while I lived uncomfortably, by reason of the constant; appre- 
hensions of their coming upon me by surprise. 

During all this time I was in the murdering humour, and 
spent most of my hours, which should have been better em- 
ployed, in contriving how to circumvent and fall upon them 
the very next time I should see them — especially if they 
should be divided, as they were the last time, into two parties ; 
nor did I consider at all that if I killed one party — suppose 
ten or a dozen — I was still the next day or week, or month, 
to kill another, and so another, even ad infinitum,, till I should 
be, at length, no less a murderer than they were in being 
man-eaters — and perhaps much more so. I spent my days 
now in great perplexity and anxiety of mind, expecting that 
I should one day or other fall into the hands ot these merci- 
less creatures ; and if I did at any time venture abroad, it 
was not without looking round me with the greatest care and 
caution imaginable. And now I found, to my great comfort, 
how happy it was that I had provided a tame flock or herd 
of goats ; for I durst not upon any account fire my gun, 
especially near that side of the island where they usually 
came, lest I should alarm the savages : and if they had fled 
from me now, I was sure to have them come again with 
perhaps two or three hundred canoes with them in a few days, 
and then I knew what to expect. However, I wore out a 
rear and three months more before I ever saw any more of 
the savages, and then I found them again, as I shall soon 
observe. It is true they might have been there once or 
twice ; but either they made no stay, or at least I did not 
see them ; but in the month of May, as near as I could cal- 
culate, and in my four-and-twentieth year, I had a very strange 
encounter with them ;_ of which in its place. 

It was in the middle of May, on the sixteenth day, I think, 
as well as my poor wooden calendar would reckon — for I 
marked all upon the post still — that it blew a very great 
storm of wind all day, with a great deal of lightning and 



144 



KOJ3INSON CRUSOE. 



thunder, and a very foul night it was after it. I knew not 
what was the particular occasion of it ; but as I was reading 
in the Bible, and taken up with very serious thoughts about 
my present condition, I was surprised with the noise of a gun, 
as I thought, fired at sea. This was, to be sure, a surprise 
quite of a different nature from any I had met with before ; 
for the notions this put into my thoughts were quite of another 
kind. I started up in the greatest haste imaginable ; and, in 
a trice, clapped my ladder to the middle place of the rock, 
and pulled it after me ; and mounting it the second time, got 
to the top of a hill the very moment that a flash of fire bid 
me listen for a second gun, which, accordingly, in about half- 
a-minute, I heard ; and by the sound, knew that it was from 
that part of the sea wheue I was driven down the current in 
my boat. 1 immediately considered that this must be some 
ship in distress, and that they had some comrade, or some 
other ship in company, and fired these for signals of distress, 
and to obtain help. I had the presence of mind, at that 
minute^ to think, that though I could not help them, it might 
be they might help me ; so I brought together all the dry 
wood I could get at hand, and, making a good pile, I set it 
on fire upon the hill. The wood was dry, and blazed freely; 
and, though the wind blew very hard, yet it burned fairly 
out, so that I was certain, if there was any such thing as a 
ship, they must needs see it, and no doubt they did ; for as 
soon as ever my fire blazed up, I heard another gun, and 
after that several others, all from the same quarter. I plied 
my fire all night long, till daybreak : and when it was broad 
day, and the air cleared up, I saw something at a great dis- 
tance at sea, full east of the island, whether a sail or a hull I 
could not distinguish — no, not with my glass ; the distance 
was so great, and the weather still something hazy also ; at 
least, it was so out at sea. 

I looked frequently at it all that day, and soon perceived 
that it did not move ; so I presently concluded that it was a 
ship at anchor; and being, eager, you may be sure, to be 
satisfied, I took my gun in my hand, and ran towards the 
south side of the island, to the rocks where I had formerly 
been carried away by the current ; and getting up there, the 
weather by this time being perfectly clear, I could plainly 
see, to my great sorrow, the wreck of a ship, cast away in the 



KOBINSON CRUSOE. 



145 



night upon those concealed rocks which I found when I was 
out in my boat. Had they seen the island, as I must neccs- 




TAOE If?, 



sarily suppose they did not, they must, as I thought, have 
endeavoured to have saved themselves on shore by the help 
of their boat ; but their firing off guns for help, especially 



146 



KU131JNSUN (JliUSUK. 



when they saw, as I imagined, my fire, filled me with many 
thoughts. First, I imagined that upon seeing my light, they 
might have put themselves into their boat, and endeavoured 
to make the shore ; but that the sea running very high, they 
might ha\;e been cast away. Other times, I imagined that 
they might have lost their boat before, as might be the case 
many ways ; particularly by the brealdng of the sea upon their 
ship, which many times obliged men to stave, or take in 
pieces, their boat, and sometimes to throw it overboard with 
their own hands. Other times, I imagined they had some 
other ship or ships in company, who, upon the signals of dis- 
tress they made, had taken them ixp, and carried them off. 
Other times, I fancied they were all gone off to sea in their 
boat, and being hurried away by the current that I had been 
formerly in, were carried out into the great ocean, where 
there was nothing but misery and perishing : and that, per- 
haps, they might by this time think of starving, and of being 
in a condition to eat one another. 

There are some secret moving springs in the affections, 
which, when they are set a-going by some object in view, or, 
though not in view, yet rendered present to the mind by the 
power of imagination, that motion carries out the soul, by its 
impetuosity, to such violent eager embracings of the object 
that the absence of it is insupportable. Such were these 
earnest wishings that but one man had been saved. I be- 
lieve I repeated the words, " O that it had been but one !" 
a thousand times; and my desires were so moved by it, that 
when I spoke the words my hands would clinch together, and 
my fingers would press the palms of my hands, so that if I 
had had any soft thing in my hand, I would have crushed it 
involuntarily ; and the teeth in my head would strike to- 
gether 3 and set against one another so strong, that for some 
time I could not part them again. But it was not to be ; 
either their fate or mine, or both, forbade it, for till the 
last year of my being on this island, I never knew whether 
any were saved out of that ship or no ; and had only the 
affliction, some days after, to see the corpse of a drowned boy 
come on shore at the end of the island which was next the 
shipwreck. He had no clothes on but a seaman's waistcoat, 
a pair of open-kneed linen drawers, and a blue linen shirt ; 
but nothing to direct me so much as to guess what nation he 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 147 

was of. He had nothing in his pockets but two pieces-of- 
eight and a tobacco-pipe — the last was to me of ten times 
more value than the first. 

It was now calm, and I had a great mind to venture out in 
my boat to this wreck, not doubting but I might find some- 
thing on board that might be useful to me. But that did 
not altogether press me so much, as the possibility that there 
might be yet some living creature on board, whose life I 
might not only save, but might, by saving that life, comfort 
my own to the last degree ; and this thought clung so to my 
heart that I could not be quiet night nor day, but I must 
venture out in my boat on board this wreck ; and committing 
the rest to God's providence, I thought the impression was so 
strong upon my mind that it could not be resisted, that it 
must come from some invisible direction, and that I should. 
be wanting to myself if I did not go. 

Under the power of this impression, I hastened back to 
my castle, prepared everything for my voyage, took a quantity 
of bread, a great pot of fresh water, a compass to steer by, 
a bottle of rum (for I had still a great deal of that left), and 
a basket of raisins; and thus, loading myself with everything 
necessary, I went down to my boat, got the water out of her, 
got her afloat, loaded all my cargo in her, and then went 
home again for more. My second cargo was a great bag of 
xice, the umbrella to set up over my head for a shade, another 
large pot of fresh water, and about two dozen of small loaves, 
or barley-cakes, more than before, with a bottle of goat's 
milk, and a cheese : all which, with great labour and sweat, 
I carried to my boat ; and praying to God to direct my 
voyage, I put out, and rowing' the canoe along the shore, 
came at last to the utmost point of the island on the north- 
east side, and hauled my boat into a little creek on the 
shore. 

^ I resolved, the next morning, to set out with the first of the 
tide; and, reposing myself for the night in my canoe, under 
the great watch-coat I mentioned, I launched out, and having 
a strong steerage with my paddle, I went, at a great rate, 
directly for the wreck, and in less than two hours I came up 
to it.^ It was a dismal sight to look at: the ship, which, by its 
building, was Spanish, stuck fast, jammed in between two 
rocks , all the stern and quarter of her v.'ere'beaten to pieces 



148 EOBINSON CRUSOE. 

by the sea ; and as her forecastle, which stuck in the rocks, 
had run on with great violence, her mainmast and foremast 
were broken short off; but her bowsprit was sound, and the 
head and bow appeared firm. When I came close to her, a 
dog appeared upon her, who seeing me coming, yelped and 
cried ; and, as soon as I called him, jumped into the sea to 
come to me : I took him into the boat, but found him almost 
dead with hunger and thirst. I gave him a cake of my bread, 
and he devoured it like a ravenous wolf that had been starving 
a fortnight in the snow : I then gave the poor creature spme 
fresh water, with which, if I would have let him, he would 
have burst himself. After this I went on board; but the first 
sight I met with was two men drowned in the cook-room, or 
forecastle of the ship, with their arms fast about one another. 
[ concluded, as is indeed probable, that when the ship struck, 
it being in a storm, the sea broke so high, and so continually 
Dver her, that the men were not able to bear it, and were 
strangled with the constant rushing in of the water, as much 
is if they had been under water. Besides the dog, there was 
nothing left in the ship that had life ; nor any goods, that I 
:ould see, but what were spoiled by the water. There were 
some casks of liquer, whether wine or brandy I knew not, 
which lay lower in the hold, and which, the water being ebbed 
3ut, I could see ; but they were too big to meddle with. I 
saw several chests, which I believe belonged to some of the 
seamen ; and I got two of them into the boat, without ex- 
imining what was in them. Had the stern of the ship been 
fixed, and the forepart broken off, I am persuaded I might 
have made a good voyage ; for, by what I found in these two- 
chests, I had reason to suppose the ship had a great deal of 
wealth on board ; and, if I may guess from the course she 
steered, she must have been bound from Buenos Ayres, or 
the Eio de la Plata, in the south part of America, beyond the 
Brazils to the Havannah, in the Gulf of Mexico, and so 
perhaps to Spain. She had, no doubt, a great treasure in 
her, but of no use, at that time, to anybody ; but what became 
of the crew I then knew not. 

I found, besides these chests, a little cask full of liquor, of 
ibout twenty gallons, which I got into my' boat with much 
difficulty. There were several muskets in the cabin, and a 
great powder-horn, with about four pounds of powder in it: 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 149 

as for the muskets, I had no occasion for them, so I left them, 
but took the powder-horn. I took a fire-shovel and tongs, 
which I wanted extremely ; as also two little brass kettles, a 
copper pot to make chocolate, and a gridiron ; and with this 
cargo, and the, dog, I came away, the tide beginning to make 
home again : and the same evening, about an hour within 
night, I reached the island again, weary and fatigued to the 
last degree. I reposed that night in the boat ; and in the 
morning I resolved to harbour what I had got in my new 
•cave, and not carry it home to my castle. After refreshing 
myself, I got all my cargo on shore, and began to examine 
the particulars. The cask of liquor I found to be a kind of 
rum, but not such as we had at the Brazils ; and, in a word, 
not at all good ; but when I came to open the chests, I found 
several things of great use to me : for example, I found in 
one a fine case of bottles, of an extraordinary kind, and filled 
with cordial waters, fine and very good; the bottles held 
about three pints each, and were tipped with silver. I found 
two pots of very good succades, or sweetmeats, so fastened 
also on the top that the salt water had not hurt them ; and 
two more ot the same, which the water had spoiled. I found 
some very good shirts, which were very welcome to me ; and 
•about a dozen and a half of white linen handkerchiefs, and 
•coloured neckcloths ; the former were also very welcome, 
being exceedingly refreshing to wipe my face in a hot day. 
Besides this, when I came to the till in the chest, I found 
there three great bags of pieces-of-eight, which held about 
eleven hundred pieces in all ; and in one of them, wrapped 
up in a paper, six doubloons of gold, and some small bars of 
gold ; I suppose they might all weigh near a pound. In the 
other chest were some clothes, but of little value; but, by 
the circumstances, it must have belonged to the gunner's 
mate; though there was no powder in it except two pounds 
of fine glazed powder, in three small flasks, kept, I suppose, 
for charging their fowling pieces on occasion. Upon the 
■whole, I got very little by this voyage that was of any use to 
me ; for, as to the money, I had no manner of occasion for it ; 
it was to me as the dirt under my feet, and I would have 
given it all for three or four pair of English shoes and 
stockings, which were things I greatly wanted, but had none 
on my feet for many years. I had, indeed, got two pair of 



150 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

shoes now, which I took off the feet of the two drowned men 
whom I saw in the wreck, and I found two pair more in one 
of the chests, which were very welcome to me ; but they were 
not like our English shoes, either for ease or service, being 
rather what we call pumps than shoes. I found in this 
seaman's chest about fifty pieces-of-eight, in rials, but no- 
gold : I suppose this belonged to a poorer man than the other r 
which seemed to belong to some officer. Well, however, I 
lugged this money home to my cave, and laid it up, as I had 
done that before which I had brought from our own ship ; 
but it was a great pity, as I said, that the other part of this 
ship had not come to my share ; for I am satisfied I might 
have loaded my canoe several times over with money ; and, 
thought I, if I ever escape to England, it might lie here safe 
enough till I come again and fetch it. 

Having now brought all my things on shore, and secured 
them, I went back to my boat, and rowed her along the shore 
to her old harbour, where I laid her up, and made the best 
of my way to my old habitation, where I found everything 
safe and quiet. I began now to repose myself, live after my 
old fashion, and take care of my family affairs ; and for a 
while I lived easy enough, only that I was more vigilant than 
I used to be, looked out often er, and did not go abroad so 
much ; and if, at any time, I did stir with any freedom, it was 
always to the east part of the island, where I was pretty well 
satisfied the savages never came, and where I could go without 
so many precautions, and such a load of arms and ammunition 
as I always carried with me if I went the other way. I lived 
in this condition near two years more ; but my unlucky head,. 
that was always to let me know it was born to make my body 
miserable, was all these two years filled with projects and 
designs, how, if it were possible, I might get away from this 
island ; for, sometimes I was for making another voyage to 
the wreck, though my reason told me that there was nothing 
left there worth the hazard of my voyage ; sometimes, for a 
ramble one way, sometimes another : and I believe verily, if 
I had had the boat that I went from Sallee in, I should have 
ventured to sea, bound anywhere, I knew not whither. 

1 am now supposed to be retired into my castle, after my 
late voyage to the wreck, my frigate laid up and secured 
under water, as usual, and my condition restored to what it, 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 151 

was before: I had more wealth, indeed, than what I had 
before, but was not at all the richer ; for I had no more use 
for it than the Indians of Peru had before the Spaniards 
came there. 

It was one of the nights in the rainy season in March, the 
four-and-twentieth year of my first setting foot in this island 
of solitude, I was lying in my hammock, awake, very well in 
health, had no pain, no distemper, no uneasiness of body, nor 
any uneasiness of mind more than ordinary, but could by no 
means close my eyes, that is, so as to sleep ; no, not a wink 
all night long, otherwise than as follows : — It is impossible to 
set down the innumerable crowd of thoughts that whirled 
through that great thoroughfare of the brain — the memory, 
in this night's time : I ran over the whole history of my life 
in miniature, or by abridgment, as I may call it, to my coming 
to this island, and also of that part of my life since I came to 
this island. In my reflections upon the state of my case 
since I came on shore on this island, I was comparing the 
happy posture of my affairs in the first years of my habita- 
tion here, with the life of anxiety, fear, and care, which I had 
lived in ever since I had seen the print of a foot in the sand; 
not that I did not believe the savages had frequented the 
island even all the while, and might have been several hun- 
dreds of them at times on shore there ; but I had never 
known it, and was incapable of any apprehensions about it ; 
my satisfaction was perfect, though my danger was the same, 
and I was as happy in not knowing my danger as if I had 
never really been exposed to it. 

I looked upon my present condition as the most miserable 
that could possibly be ; that I was not able to throw myself 
into anything but death, that could be called worse ; and if I 
reached the shore of the main, I might perhaps meet with 
relief, or I might coast along, as I did on the African shore, 
till I came to some inhabited country, and where I might find 
some relief; and, after all, perhaps I might fall in with some 
Christian ship that might take me in ; and if the worst came 
to the worst, I could but die, which would put an end to all 
these miseries at once. 

When this had agitated my thoughts for two hours or 
more, with such violence that it set my very blood into a fer- 
ment, and my pulse beat as if I had been in a fever, merely 



152 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

with the extraordinary fervour of my mind about it, nature, 
as if I had been fatigued and exhausted with the very 
thoughts of it, threw me into a sound sleep. One would 
have thought I should have dreamed of it, but I did not, nor 
of anything relating to it : but I dreamed that as I was going 
out in the morning as usual, from my castle, I saw upon the 
shore two canoes and eleven savages, coming to land, and that 
they brought with them another savage, whom they were 
going to kill, in order to eat him ; when, on a sudden, the 
savage that they were going to kill, jumped away, and ran 
for his life ; and I thought, in my sleep, that he came running 
into my little thick grove before my fortification, to hide 
himself; and that I, seeing him alone, and not perceiving 
that the others sought him that way, showed myself to him, 
and smiling upon him, encouraged him : that he kneeled 
down to me, seeming to pray me to assist him ; upon which 
I showed him my ladder, made him go up, and carried him 
into my cave, and he "became my servant : and that as soon 
as I had got this man, I said to myself, " Now I may certainly 
venture to the main land, for this fellow will serve me as a 
pilot, and will tell me what to do, and whither to go for pro- 
visions, and whither not to go for fear of being devoured ; 
what places to venture into, and what to shun." I waked 
with this thought ; and was under such inexpressible impres- 
sions of joy at the prospect of my escape in my dream, that 
the disappointments which I felt upon coming to myself, and 
finding that it was no more than a dream, were equally ex- 
travagant the other way, and threw me into a very great de- 
jection of spirits. 

Upon this, however, I made this conclusion — that my only 
way to go about to attempt an escape was, if possible, to get 
a savage into my possession ; and, if possible, it should be 
one of their prisoners, whom they had condemned to > be 
eaten, and should bring hither to kill. But these thoughts 
still were attended with this difficulty, that it was impossible 
to effect this without attacking a whole caravan of them, and 
killing them all; and this was not only a very desperate 
attempt, and might miscarry ; but, on the other hand, I had 
greatly scrupled the lawfulness of it to myself; and my heart 
trembled at the thoughts of shedding so much blood, though 
it was for my deliverance. The eager prevailing desire of 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 



153 



deliverance at length mastered all the rest ; and I resolved, 
if possible, to get one of these savages into my hands, cost 
what it would. My next thing was to contrive how to do it, 
and this indeed was very difficult to resolve on; but as I 




PAGC 183. 

could pitch upon no probable mean3 for it, so I resolved to 
put myself upon the watch, to see them when they came on 
shore, and leave the rest to the event ; taking such measures 
as the opportunity should present, let what would be. 

With these resolutions in my thoughts, I set myself upon 
the scout as often as possible, and indeed so often, that I was 



154 EOBINSON CRUSOE. 

heartily tired of it ; for it was above a year and a half that 
I waited ; and for great part of that time went out to the 
west end, and to the south-west corner of the island almost 
every day, to look for canoes, but none appeared. This was 
very discouraging, and began to trouble me much ; but the 
longer it seemed to be delayed, the more eager I was for it : 
in a word, I was not at first so careful to shun the sight of these 
savages, and avoid being seen by them, as I was now eager 
to be upon them. Besides, I fancied myself able to manage 
one, nay, two or three savages, if I had them, so as to make 
them entirely slaves to me, to do whatever I should direct 
them, and to prevent their being able at any time to do me 
any hurt. It was a great while that I pleased myself with 
this affair ; but nothing still presented itself; all my fancies 
and schemes came to nothing, for no savages came near me 
for a great while. 

About a year and a half after I entertained these notions, 
I was surprised one morning by seeing no less than five 
canoes all on shore together on my side the island, and the 
people who belonged to them all landed and out of my sight. 
The number of them broke all my measures ; for seeing so 
many, and knowing that they always came four or six, or 
sometimes more in a boat, I could not tell what to think of it, 
or how to take my measures, to attack twenty or thirty men 
single-handed ; so lay still in my castle, perplexed and dis- 
comforted. However, I put myself into the same position for 
an attack that I had formerly provided, and was just ready 
for action, if anything had presented. Having waited a good 
while, listening to hear if they made any noise, at length, 
being very impatient, I set my guns at the foot of my ladder, 
and clambered up to the top of the hill, by my two stages, 
as usual ; standing so, however, that my head did not appear 
above the hill, so that they could not perceive me by any 
means. Here I observed, by the help of my perspective 
glass, that they were no less than thirty in number ; that they 
had a fire kindled, and that they had meat dressed. How 
they had cooked it I knew not, or what it was ; but they were 
all dancing, in I know not how many barbarous gestures and 
figures, their own way, round the fire. 

While I was thus looking on them, I perceived, by my 
perspective, two miserable wretches dragged from the boats, 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 155- 

where, it seems, they were laid by, and were now brought 
out for the slaughter. I perceived one of them immediately 
fall ; being knocked down, I suppose, with a club or wooden 
sword, for that was their way ; and two or three others were 
at work immediately, cutting him open for their cookery,. 
while the other victim was left standing by himself, till they 
should be ready for him. In that very moment, this poor 
wretch, seeing himself a little at liberty, and unbound, Nature 
inspired him with hopes of life, and he started away from 
them, and ran with incredible swiftness along the sands, 
directly towards me ; I mean towards that part of the coast 
where my habitation was. I was dreadfully frightened, I 
must acknowledge, when I perceived him run my way ; and 
especially when, as I thought, I saw him pursued by the 
whole body ; and now I expected that part of my dream was 
coming to pass, and that he would certainly take shelter in 
my grove : but I could not depend, by any means, upon my 
dream, that the other savages would not pursue him thither, 
and find him there. However, I kept my station, and my 
spirits began to recover when I found that there was not 
above three men that followed him ; and still more was I 
encouraged, when I found that he outstripped them exceed- 
ingly in running, and gained ground on them ; so that, if he 
could but hold out for half an hour, I saw easily he would 
fairly get away from them all. 

There was between them and my castle, the creek, which 
I mentioned often in the first part of my story, where I landed 
my cargoes out of the ship ; and this I saw plainly he must 
necessarily swim over, or the poor wretch would be taken 
there ; but when the savage escaping came thither, he made 
nothing of it, though the tide was then up; but, plunging in, 
swam through in about thirty strokes, or thereabouts, landed, 
and ran with exceeding strength and swiftness. When the 
throe persons came to the creek, I found that two of them 
could swim, but the third could not, and that, standing on 
the other side, he looked at the others, but went no farther, 
and soon after went softly back again ; which, as it happened, 
was very well for him in the end. I observed that the two 
who swam were yet more than twice as long swimming over 
the creek as the fellow was that fled from them. It°came 
very warmly upon my thoughts, and indeed irresistibly, that 



156 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

now was the time to get me a servant, and perhaps a com- 
panion or assistant ; and that I was plainly called by Provi- 
dence to save this poor creature's life. I immediately ran 
down the ladders with all possible expedition, fetched my two 
guns, for they were both at the foot of the ladders, as I ob- 
served before, and getting up again with the same haste to 
the top of the hill, I crossed towards the sea ; and having a 
very short cut, and all down hill, placed myself in the way 
between the pursuers and the pursued, hallooing aloud to 
him that fled, who, looking back, was at first perhaps as much 
frightened at me as at them ; but I beckoned with my hand 
to him to come back ; and, in the meantime, I slowly ad- 
vanced towards the two that followed ; then rushing at once 
upon the foremost, I knocked him down with the stock of my 
piece. I was loath to fire, because I would not have the rest 
hear ; though, at that distance, it would not have been easily 
heard, and being out of sight of the smoke, too, they would 
not have known what to make of it. Having knocked this 
fellow down, the other who pursued him stopped, as if he 
had been frightened, and I advanced towards him : but as I 
came nearer, I perceived presently he had a bow and arrow, 
and was fitting it to shoot at me : so I was then obliged to 
shoot at him first, which I did, and killed him at the first 
shot. The poor savage who fled, but had stopped, though he 
saw both his enemies fallen and killed, as he thought, yet was 
so frightened with the fire and noise of my piece, that he 
rtood stock still, and neither came forward, nor went back- 
ward, though he seemed rather inclined still to fly than to 
come on. I hallooed again to him, and made signs to come 
forward, which he easily understood, and came a little way ; 
then stopped again, and then a little farther, and stopped 
again ; and I could then perceive that he stood trembling, as 
if he had been taken prisoner, and had just been to be killed, 
as his two enemies were. I beckoned to him again to come 
to me, and gave him all the signs of encouragement that I 
could think of; and he came nearer and nearer, kneeling 
down every ten or twelve steps, in token of acknowledgment 
for saving his life. I smiled at him, and looked pleasantly, 
and beckoned to him to come still nearer : at length, he came 
close to me; and then he kneeled down again, kissed the 
ground, and laid his head upon the ground, and, taking me 



EOBINSOX CRUSOE. 157 

by the foot, set my foot upon his head ; this, it seems, was in 
token of swearing to be my slave for ever. I took him up, 
and made much of him, and encouraged him all I could. But 
there was more work to do yet ; for I perceived the savage 
whom I had knocked down was not killed, but stunned with 
the blow, and began to come to himself : so I pointed to him, 
and showed him the savage, that he was not dead ; upon this 
he spoke some words to me, and though I could not under- 
stand them, yet I thought they were pleasant to hear ; for 
they were the first sound of a man's voice that I had heard, 
my own excepted, for above twenty-five years. But there 
was no time for such reflections now ; the savage who was 
knocked down recovered himself so far as to sit up upon the 
ground, and I perceived that my savage began to be afraid ; 
but when I saw that, I presented my other piece at the man, 
as if I would shoot him : upon this, my savage, for so I call 
him now, made a motion to me to lend him my sword, which 
hung naked in a belt by my side, which I did. He no sooner 
had it, but he runs to his enemy, and at one blow, cut oiF his 
head so cleverly, no executioner in Germany could have done 
it sooner or better; which I thought very strange for one 
who, I had reason to believe, never saw a sword in his life 
before, except their own wooden swords: however, it seems, 
as I learned afterwards, they make their wooden swords so 
sharp, so heavy, and the wood is so hard, that they will even 
cut off heads with them, ay, and arms, and that at one blow 
too. When he had done this, he comes laughing to me in 
sign of triumph, and brought me the sword again, and with 
abundance of gestures which I did not understand, laid it 
down, with the head of the savage that he had killed, just 
before me. But that which astonished him most, was to 
know how I killed the other Indian so far off; so pointing to 
him, he made signs to me to let him go to him ; and I bade 
him go, as well as I could. When he came to him, he stood 
like one amazed, looking at him, turning him first on one 
side, then on the other; looked at the wound the bullet had 
made, which it seems was just in his breast, where it had 
made a hole, and no great quantity of blood had followed ; 
but he had bled inwardly, for he was quite dead. He took 
up his bow and arrows, and came back ; so I turned to go 
away, and beckoned him to follow me, making signs to him 



158 EOBINSON CRUSOE. 

that more might come after them. Upon this, he made signs 
to me that he should bury them with sand, that they might 
not be seen by the rest, if they followed ; and so I made signs 
to him again to do so. He fell to work, and in an instant he 
had scraped a hole in the sand with his hands, big enough to 
bury the first in, and then dragged him into it, and covered 
him ; and did so by the other also ; I believe he had buried 
them both in a quarter of an hour. Then calling him away, 
J carried him, not to my castle, but quite away to my cave, 
on the farther part of the island : so I did not let my dream 
•come to pass in that part, that he came into my grove for 
shelter. Here I gave him bread and a bunch of raisins to 
eat, and a draught of water, which I found he was indeed in 
great distress for, from his running : and having refreshed 
him, I made signs for him to go and lie down to sleep, show- 
ing him a place where I had laid some rice-straw, and a 
blanket upon it, which I used to sleep upon myself sometimes ; 
so the poor creature lay down, and went to sleep. 

He was a comely, handsome fellow, perfectly well made, 
with straight strong limbs, not too large, tall and well shaped ; 
and, as I reckon, about twenty-six years of age. He had a 
very good countenance, not a fierce and surly aspect, but 
seemed to have something very manly in his face ; and yet 
he had all the sweetness and softness of a European in his 
countenance too, especially when he smiled. His hair was 
long and black, not curled like wool; his forehead very high 
and large ; and a great vivacity and sparkling sharpness in 
his eyes. The colour of his skin was not quite black, but 
very tawny : and yet not an ugly, yellow, nauseous tawny, as 
the Brazilians and Virginians, and other natives of America 
are, but of a bright kind of a dun olive-colour, that had in it 
something very agreeable, though not very easy to describe. 
His face was round and plump ; his nose small, not flat like 
the negroes ; a very good mouth, thin lips, and his fine teeth 
well set, and as white as ivory. 

After he had slumbered about half an hour, he awoke 
again, and came out of the cave to me ; for I had been milking 
my goats, which I had in the enclosure just by : when he 
<espied me, he came running to me, laying himself down agaia 
upon the ground, with all the possible signs of an humble, 
thankful disposition, making a great many antic gestures to 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 159 

show it. At last he lays his head flat upon the ground, close 
to my foot, and sets my other foot upon his head, as he had 
done before ; and after this, made all the signs to me of sub- 
jection, servitude, and submission, imaginable, to let me know 
how he would serve me so long as he lived. I understood 
him in many things, and let him know I was very well pleased 
with him. In a little time, I began to speak to him, and 
teach him to speak to me ; and, first, I let him know his name 
should be Friday, which was the day I saved his life : I 
called him so for the memory of the time. I likewise taught 
him to say Master ; and then let him know that was to be my 
name : I likewise taught him to say Yes or No, and to know 
the meaning of them. I gave him some milk in an earthen 
pot, and let him see me drink it before him, and sop my 
oread in it ; and gave him a cake of bread to do the like, 
which he quickly complied with, and made signs that it was 
very good for him. I kept there with him all night ; but, as 
soon as it was day, I beckoned to him to come with me, and 
let him know I would give him some clothes ; at which he 
seemed very glad, for he was stark naked. As we went by 
the place where he had buried the two men, he pointed 
exactly to the place, and showed me the marks that he had 
made to find them again, making signs to me that we should 
dig them up again and eat them. At this, I appeared very 
angry, expressed my abhorrence of it, made as if I would 
vomit at the thoughts of it, and beckoned with my hand to 
him to come away, which he did immediately, with great sub- 
mission. I then led him up to the top of the hill, to see if 
his enemies were gone ; and, pulling out my glass, I looked, 
and saw plainly the place where they had been, but no 
appearance of them or their canoes; so that it was plain 
they were gone, and had left their two comrades behind 
ihem, without any search after them. 

But I was not content with this discovery ; but having now 
more courage, and consequently more curiosity, I took my 
man Friday with me, giving him the sword in his hand, with 
the bow and arrows at his back, which I found he could use 
very dexterously, making him carry one gun for me, and I 
two for myself; and away we marched to the place where 
these creatures had been ; for I had a mind now to get some 
fuller intelligence of them. When I came to the place, my 



160 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

very blood ran chill in my veins, and my heart sunk within 
me, at the horror of the spectacle ; indeed, it was a dreadful 
sight, at least it was so to me, though Friday made nothing 
of it. The place was covered with human bones, the ground 
dyed with their blood, and great pieces of flesh left here and 
there, half-eaten, mangled, and scorched; and, in short, all 
the tokens of the triumphant feast they had been making 
there, after a victory over their enemies. I saw three skulls, 
five hands, and the bones of three or four legs and feet, and 
abundance of other parts of the bodies ; and Friday, by his 
signs, made me understand that they brought over four 
prisoners to feast upon ; that three of them were eaten up, 
and that he, pointing to himself, was the fourth ; that there 
had been a great battle between them and their next king, 
of whose subjects, it seems, he had been one, and that they 
had taken a great number of prisoners ; all of which were 
carried to several places, by those who had taken them in the 
fight, in order to feast xipon them, as was done here by these 
wretches upon those they brought hither. 

I caused Friday to gather all the skulls, bones, flesh, and 
whatever remained, and lay them together in a heap, and 
make a great fire upon it, and burn them all to ashes. I 
found Friday had still a hankering stomach after some of the 
flesh, and was still a cannibal in his nature ; but I showed so 
much abhorrence at the very thoughts of it, that he durst 
not discover it : for I had, by some means, let him know that 
I would kill him if he offered it. 

When he had done this, we came back to our castle ; and 
there I fell to work for my man Friday ; and first of all, I 
gave him a pair of linen drawers, which I had out of the 
poor gunner's chest I mentioned, which I found in the wreck, 
and which, with a little alteration, fitted him very well ; and 
then I made him a jerkin of goat's skin, as well as my skill 
would allow (for I was now grown a tolerably good tailor) ; 
and I gave him a cap which I made of hare's skin, very con- 
venient and fashionable enough : and thus he was clothed, 
for the present, tolerably well, and was mighty well pleased 
to see himself almost as well clothed as his master. It is 
true, he went awkwardly in these clothes at first : wearing 
the drawers was very awkward to lrim, and the sleeves of the 
waistcoat galled his shoulders and the in-ide of his arms; 



ROBINSON CBUSOE. 



161 



but a little easing them where he complained they hurt 
him, and using himself to them, he took to them at length 
very well. 

The next day, after I came home to my hutch with him, I 




began to consider where I should lodge him ; and, that I 
might do well for him and yet be perfectly easy myself, I 
made a little tent for him in the vacant place between my 
two fortifications, in the inside of the last, and in the outside 
of the first. As there was a door or entrance there into my 
cave, I made a formal framed door-case, and a door to it of 



1 1 



1G2 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

boards, and set it up in the passage, a little within the 
entrance ; and, causing the door to open in the inside, I 
barred it up in the. night, taking in my ladders too ; so that 
Friday could no way come at me in the inside of my inner- 
most wall, without making so much noise in getting over that 
it must needs awaken me ; for my first wall had now a com- 
plete roof over it of long poles, covering all my tent, and 
leaning up to the side of the hill, which was again laid across 
with smaller sticks, instead of laths, and then thatched over 
a great thickness with the rice-straw, which was strong, like 
reeds, and at the hole which was left to go in or out by the 
ladder, I had placed a kind of trap-door, which, if it had 
been attempted on the outside, would not have opened at all, 
but would have fallen down and made a great noise : as to 
weapons, I took them all into my side every night. But 
I Deeded none of all this precaution; for never man had a 
more faithful, loving, sincere servant than Friday was to me; 
without passions, sullenness, or designs, perfectly obliged and 
engaged ; his very affections were tied to me, like those of a 
child to a father; and I cUire say he would have sacrificed 
his life to save mine, upon any occasion whatsoever : the 
many testimonies he gave me of this, put it out of doubt, 
and soon convinced me that I needed to use no precautions 
for my safety on this account. 

I was greatly delighted with him, and made it my business 
to teach him everything that was proper to make him useful, 
handy, and helpful ; but especially to make him speak, and 
understand me when I spoke : and he was the aptest scholar 
that ever was ; and particularly was so merry, so constantly 
diligent, and so pleased when he could but understand me, or 
make me understand him, that it was very pleasant to me to 
talk to him. Now my life began to be so easy that I began 
to say to myself, that could I but have been safe from more 
savages, I cared not if I was never to remove from the place 
where I lived. 

After I had been two or three days returned to my castle, 
I thought that, in order to bring Friday off from his horrid 
way of feeding, and from the relish of a cannibal's stomach, 
I ought to let him taste other flesh ; so I took him out with 
me one morning to the woods. I went, indeed, intending to 
kill a kid out of my own flock, and bring it home and dress 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 163 

It ; but as I was going, I saw a she-goat lying down in the 
shade, and two young kids sitting by her. I catched hold of 
Friday — "Hold!" said I, "stand still;" and made signs to 
him not to stir : immediately, I presented my piece, shot, and 
killed one of the kids. The poor creature, who had, at a 
distance, indeed, seen me kill the savage, his enemy, but did 
not know, nor could imagine, how it was done, was sensibly 
surprised ; trembled, and shook, and looked so amazed that 
I thought he would have sunk down. He did not see the 
kid I shot at, or perceive I had killed it, but ripped up his 
waistcoat, to feel whether he was not wounded; and, as I 
found presently, thought I was resolved to kill him : for he 
came and kneeled down to me, and embracing my knees, 
said a great many things I did not understand ; but I could 
easily see the meaning was, to pray me not to kill him. 

I soon found a way to convince him that I would do him 
no harm ; and taking him up by the hand, laughed at him, 
and pointing to the kid which I had killed, beckoned to him 
to run and fetch it, which he did : and while he was wonder- 
ing, and looking to see how the creature was killed, I loaded 
my gun again. By-and-by, I saw a great fowl, like a hawk, 
sitting upon a tree within shot ; so, to let Friday understand 
a little what I would do, I called him to me again, pointed at 
the fowl, which was indeed a parrot., though I thought it had 
been a hawk ; I say, pointing to the parrot, and to my gun, 
and to the ground under the parrot, to let him see I would 
make it fall, I made him understand that I would shoot and 
kill that bird ; accordingly, I fired, and bade him look, and 
immediately he saw the parrot fall. He stood like one 
frightened again, notwithstanding all I had said to him ; and 
I found he was the more amazed, because he did not see me 
put anything into the gun, but thought that there must be 
some wonderful fund of death and destruction in that thing, 
able to kill man, beast, bird, or anything near or far off; and 
the astonishment this created in him was such as could not 
wear off for a long time ; and, I believe, if I would have let 
him, he would have worshipped me and my gun. As for the 
gun itself, he would not so much as touch it for several days 
after ; but he would speak to it and talk to it, as if it had 
answered him, when he was by himself; which, as I after- 
wards learned of him, was to desire it not to kill him. Well, 



164 ItOBINSON CKtJSOE. 

after his astonishment was a little over at this, I pointed to 
him to run and fetch the bird I had shot, which he did, but! 
stayed some time ; for the parrot, not being quite dead, had 
fluttered away a good distance from the place where she fell : 
however, he found her, took her up, and brought her to me ; 
and as I had perceived his ignorance about the gun before, I 
took this advantage to charge the gun again, and not to let 
him see me do it, that I might be ready for any other mark 
that might present ; but nothing more offered at that time : 
so I brought home the kid, and the same evening I took the- 
skin off, and cut it out as well as I could ; and having a pot 
fit for that purpose, I boiled or stewed some of the flesh, and 
made some very good broth. After I had begun to eat some, 
I gave some to my man, who seemed very glad of it, and 
liked it very well ; but that which was strangest to him was 
to see me eat salt with it. He made a sign to me that the 
salt was not good to eat ; and putting a little into his own 
moiith, he seemed to nauseate it, and would spit and sputter 
at it, washing his mouth with fresh water after it : on the 
other hand, I took some meat into my mouth without salt, 
and I pretended to spit and sputter for want of salt, as much 
as he had done at the salt ; but it would not do ; he would 
never care for salt with his meat or in his broth, at least not 
for a great while, and then but a very little. 

Having thus fed him with boiled meat and broth, I was 
resolved to feast him the next day by roasting a piece of the 
kid : this I did by hanging it before the fire on a string, as I 
had seen many people do in England, setting two poles up, 
one on each side of the fire, and one across on the top, and 
tying the string to the cross stick, letting the meat turn con- 
tinually. This Friday admired very much ; but when he 
came to taste the flesh, he took so many ways to tell me how 
well he liked it, that I could not but understand him : and at 
last he told me, as well as he could, he would never eat man's- 
flesh any more, which I was very glad to hear. 

The next day, I set him to work to beating some corn out, 
and sifting it in the manner I used to do, as I observed 
before ; and he soon understood how to do it as well as I, 
especially after he had seen what the meaning of it was, and 
that it was to make bread of; for after that, I let him see me' 
make my bread, and bake it too ; and in a little time, Friday 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 165 

■was able to do all the work for me as well as I could do it 
■myself. 

I began now to consider, that having two mouths to feed 
instead of one, I must provide more ground for my harvest, 
and plant a larger quantity of corn than I used to do ; so I 
marked out a larger piece of land, and began the fence in the 
same manner as before, in which Friday worked not only very 
•willingly and very hard, but did it very cheerfully : and I 
told him what it was for — that it was for corn to make more 
bread, because he was now with me, and that I might have 
enough for him and myself too. He appeared very sensible 
of that part, and let me know that he thought I had much 
more labour upon me on his account than I had for myself; 
and that he would work the harder for me, if I would tell him 
what to do. 

This was the pleasantest year of all the life I led in this 
place. Friday began to talk pretty Avell, and understand the 
names of almost everything I had occasion to call for, and of 
every place I had to send him to, and talked a great deal to 
me ; so that, in short, I began now to have some use for my 
tongue again, which, indeed, I had very little occasion for 
before. Besides the pleasure of talking to him, I had a sin- 
gular satisfaction in the fellow himself: his simple, unfeigned 
honesty appeared to me more and more every day, and I be- 
gan really to love the creature ; and on his side, I believe he 
loved me more than it was possible for him ever to love any- 
thing before. 

I had a mind once to try if he had any inclination for his 
own country again ; and having taught him English so well 
that he could answer me almost any question, I asked him 
whether the nation that he belonged to never conquered in 
battle ? At which he smiled, and said, " Yes, yes, we always 
fight the better ;" that is, he meant, always get the better in. 
fight ; and so we began the following discourse : — 

Master. — You always fight the better ; how come you t® 
be taken prisoner then, Friday ? 

Friday. — My nation beat much for all that. 

Master. — How beat ? If your nation beat them, how came 
you to be taken ? 

Friday. — They more many than my nation, in the place 



166 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

where me was ; tliey take one, two three, and me : my nation 
over-beat them in the yonder place, where me no was ; there 
my nation take one, two, great thousand. 

Master. — But why did not your side recover you from the 
hands of your enemies, then ? 

Friday. — They run, one, two, three, and me, and make go 
in the canoe ; my nation have no canoe that time. 

Master. — Well, Friday, and what does your nation do 
with the men they take ? Do they carry them away and eat 
them, as these did ? 

Friday. — Yes, my nation eat mans too : eat all up. 

Master. — Where do they carry them? 

Friday. — Go to other place, where they think. 

Master. — Do they come hither? 

Friday. — Yes, yes, they come hither ; come other else 
place. 

Master. — Have you been here with them ? 

Friday. — Yes, I have been here (points to the N.W- side 
of the island, which, it seems, was their side). 

By this, I understood that my man Friday had formerly 
been among the savages who used to come on shore on the 
farther part of the island, on the same man-eating occasions 
he was now brought for : and, some time after, when I took 
the courage to carry him to that side, being the same I 
formerly mentioned, he presently knew the place, and told 
me he was there once, when they eat up twenty men, two 
women, and one child : he could not tell twenty in English, 
but he numbered them, by laying so many stones in a row, 
and pointing to me to tell them over. 

I have told this passage, because it introduces what follows. 
After this discourse I had with him, I asked him how far it 
was from our island to the shore, and whether the canoes 
were not often lost. He told me there was no danger, no 
canoes ever lost ; but that after a little way out to sea, there 
was a current and wind, always one way in the morning, the 
other in the afternoon. This I understood to be no more 
than the sets of the tide, as going out or coming in; but I 
afterwards understood it was occasioned by the great draft 
and reflux of the mighty river Oroonoko, in the mouth or 
gulph of which river, as I found afterwards, our island lay ; 



KOBINSOK CRUSOE. 167 

and that this land which I perceived to the W and N.W. 
was the great island of Trinidad, on the north point of the 
mouth of the river. I asked Friday a thousand questions 
about the country, the inhabitants, the sea, the coast, and 
what nations were near : he told me all he knew, with the 
greatest openness imaginable. I asked him the names of the 
several nations of his sort of people, but could get no other 
name than Caribs: from whence I easily understood that 
these were the Caribbees, which our maps place on the part of 
America which reaches from the mouth of the river Oroonoko 
to Guiana, and onwards to St. Martha. He told me, that up 
a great way beyond the moon, that was, beyond the setting 
of the moon, which must be west from their country, there 
dwelt white-bearded men, like me, and pointed to my 
great whiskers ; and that they had killed much mans, that 
was his word: by all which I understood he meant the 
Spaniards, whose cruelties in America had been spread over 
the whole country, and were remembered by all the nations 
from father to son. 

I inquired if he coitld tell me how I might go from this 
island and get among those white men: he told me, "Yes, 
yes, you may go in two canoe." I could not understand 
what he meant, or make him describe to me what he meant 
by two canoe, till at last, with great difficulty, I found he 
meant it must be in a large boat, as big as two canoes. This 
part of Friday's discourse I began to relish very well ; and 
from this time I entertained some hopes that, one time or 
other, I might find an opportunity to make my escape from 
this place, and that this poor savage might be a means to 
help me. 

During the long time that Friday had now been with me, and 
that he began to speak to and understand me, I was wanting to 
lay a foundation of religious knowledge in his mind ; particu- 
larly I asked him one time, who made him. The poor creature 
did not understand me at all, but thought I had asked him 
who was his father : but I took it up by another handle, and 
asked him, who made the sea, the ground we walked on, and 
the hills and woods. He told me, " It was one Benamuckee, 
that lived beyond all;" he could describe nothing of this 
great person, but that he was very old, " much older," he 
said, " than the sea or the land, the moon or the stars." I 



1G8 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

asked him then, if this old person had made all things, why 
did not all things worship him ? He looked very grave, and, 
with a perfect look of innocence, said, " All things say to 
him." I asked him, if the people who die in his country 
went anywhere ? He said, " Yes, they all went up to Bena- 
muckee." Then I asked him whether those they eat up went 
thither too ? He said, " Yes." 

Frpm these things, I began to instruct him in the know- 
ledge of the true God : I told him that the great Maker of 
all things lived up there, pointing up towards heaven ; that 
He governed the world by the same power and providence 
by which He made it ; that He was omnipotent, and could do 
everything for us, give everything to us — take everything 
from us ; and thus, by degrees, I opened his eyes. 

I had, God knows, more sincerity than knowledge in all 
the methods I took for this poor creature's instruction, and 
must acknowledge, what I believe all that act upon the same 
principle will find, that in laying things open to him, I really 
informed and instructed myself in many things that either I 
did not knoAV, or had not fully considered before, but which 
occurred naturally to my mind upon searching into them, for 
the information of this poor savage ; and I had more affection 
in my inquiry after things upon this occasion than ever I felt 
before : so that, whether this poor wild wretch was the better 
for me or no, I had great reason to be thankful that ever he 
came to me ; my grief sat lighter upon me ; my habitation 
grew comfortable to me beyond measure : and when I reflected 
that in this solitary life which I had been confined to, I had 
not only been moved to look up to heaven myself, and to seek 
the hand that had brought me here, but was now to be made 
an instrument, under Providence, to save the life, and, for 
aught I knew, the soul of a poor savage. 

I continued in this thankful frame all the remainder of my 
time; and the conversation which employed the hours be- 
tween Friday and me was such as made the three years which 
we lived there together perfectly and completely happy. 

After Friday and I became more intimately acquainted, 
and that he could understand almost all I said to him, and 
speak pretty fluently, though in broken English, to me, I 
acquainted him with my own history, or at least so much of 
it as related to my coming to this place ; how I had lived 



ROBINSON CRUSOE.

there, and how long : I let him into the mystery, for such it 
■was to him, of gunpowder and bullet, and taught him how to 
shoot. I gave him a knife, which he was wonderfully de- 
lighted with ; and I made him a belt, with a frog hanging to 







TAGE 268. 



it ; and in the frog, instead of a hanger, I gave him a hatchet, 
which was not only as good a weapon in some cases, but much 
more useful upon other occasions. 

I described to him the country of Europe, particularly 
England, which I came from ; how we lived, how we wor- 
shipped God, how we behaved to one another, and how we 



170 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

traded in ships to all parts of the world. I gave him an 
account of the wreck which I had been on board of, and 
showed him, as near as I could, the place where she lay : but 
she was all beaten in pieces before, and gone. I showed him 
the ruins of our boat, which we lost when we escaped, and 
which I could not stir with my whole strength then; but was 
now fallen almost all to pieces. Upon seeing this boat, Friday 
stood musing a great while, and said nothing. I asked him 
what it was he studied upon. At last, says he, " Me see such 
boat like come to place at my nation." I did not understand 
him a good while ; but, at last, when I had examined further 
into it, I understood by him, that a boat, such as that had 
been, came on shore iipon the country where he lived. I 
presently imagined that some European ship must have been 
cast away upon their coast, and the boat might get loose and 
drive ashore ; but was so dull that I never once thought of 
men making their escape from, a wreck thither, much less 
whence they might come ; so I only inquired after a descrip- 
tion of the boat. 

Friday described the boat to me well enough ; but brought 
me better to understand him when he added with some 
warmth, " We save the white mans from drown." Then I 
presently asked if there were any white mans, as he called 
them, in the boat. "Yes," he said ; " the boat full of white 
mans." I asked him how many. He told upon his fingers 
seventeen. I asked him then what became of them ? He 
told me, "They live, they dwell at my nation." 

This put new thoughts into my head ; for I presently 
imagined that these might be the men belonging to the ship 
that was cast away in the sight of my island, and who, after 
the ship was struck on the rock, and they saw her inevitably 
lost, had saved themselves in their boat, and were landed 
upon that wild shore among the savages. Upon this I in- 
quired of him more critically what was become of them. He 
assured me they still lived there ; that they had been there 
about four years ; that the savages left them alone, and gave 
them victuals to live on. I asked him how it came to pass 
they did not kill them and eat them. He said, " No, they 
make brother with thein ;" that is, as I understood him, a 
truce ; and then he added, " They no eat mans but when 
make the war fight;" that is to say, they never eat any 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 171 

men but such as come to fight with them, and are taken in 
battle. 

It was after this some considerable time, that being upon 
the top of the hill, at the east side of the island, from whence, 
I had, in a clear day, discovered the continent of America, 
the weather being very serene, Friday looks very earnestly 
towards the main land, and, in a kind of surprise, falls a 
jumping and dancing, and calls out to me, for I was at some 
distance from him. I asked him what was the matter. " O 
joy!" says he; "Oglad! there see my country, there my 
nation !" I observed an extraordinary sense of pleasure 
appeared in his face, and his eyes sparkled, and his counte- 
nance discovered a strange eagerness, as if he had a mind to 
be in his own country again. This observation of mine put 
a great many thoughts into me, which made me, at first, not 
so easy about my new man Friday as I was before ; and I 
made no doubt but that, if Friday could get back to his own 
nation again, he would not only forget all his religion, but all 
his obligation to me, and would be forward enough to give 
his countrymen an account of me, and come back, perhaps, 
with a hundred or two of them, and make a feast upon me, 
at which he might be as merry as he used to be with those 
of his enemies, when they were taken in war. But I wronged 
the poor, honest creature very much, for which I was very 
sorry afterwards. However, as my jealousy increased, and. 
held me some weeks, I was a little more circumspect, and not 
so familiar and kind to him as before: in which I was cer- 
tainly in the wrong too ; the honest, grateful creature having 
no thought about it, but what consisted with the bes; prin- 
ciples, both as a religious Christian and as a grateful friend; 
as appeared afterwards to my full satisfaction. 

While my jealousy of him lasted, you may be sure I was 
every day pumping him, to see if he would discover any of 
the new thoughts which I suspected were in him ; but I found 
everything he said was so honest and so innocent, that I 
could find nothing to nourish my suspicion ; and, in spite of 
all my uneasiness, he made me at last entirely his own again; 
nor did he in the least perceive that I was uneasy, and there- 
fore I could not suspect him of deceit. 

One clay, walking up the same hill, but the weather being 
hazy at sea, so that we could not see the continent, I culled 



172 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

to him, and said, "Friday, do not you wish yourself in your 
own country, your own nation?" "Yes," he said, " I be 
much O glad to be at my own nation." " What would you 
do there ?" said I : " would you turn wild again, eat men's 
flesh, and be a savage, as you were before ?" He looked full 
of concern, and shaking his head, said, " No, no, Friday tell 
them to live good; tell them to pray God; tell them to eat 
•corn-bread, cattle-flesh, milk ; no eat man again." " Why, 
then," said I to him, "they will kill you." He looked grave 
at that, and then said, " No, no, they no kill me, they willing 
love learn." He meant by this, they would be willing to 
learn. He added, they learned much of the bearded mans 
that came in the boat. Then I asked him if he would go 
back to them. He smiled at that, and told me that he could 
not swim so far. I told him I would make a canoe for him. 
He told me he would go, if I would go with him. " I go !'' 
says I ; " why they will eat me if I come there." " No, no," 
says he, " me make they no eat you ; me make they much 
love you." Then he told me, as well as he could, how kind 
they were to seventeen white men, who came on shore there 
in distress. 

From this time, I confess, I had a mind to venture over, 
and see if I could possibly join with those bearded men, who, 
I made no doubt, were Spaniards and Portuguese ; not doubt- 
ing, but, if I could, we might find some method to escape 
from thence, being upon the continent, and a good company 
together, better than I could from an island forty miles off 
the shore, alone, and without help. So, after some days, I 
took Friday to work again, by way of discourse, and told him 
I would give him a boat to go back to his own nation; and, 
accordingly, I carried him to my frigate, which lay on the 
other side of the island, and having cleared it of water (for I 
always kept it sunk in water), I brought it out, showed it 
him, and we both went into it. I found he was a most dex- 
terous fellow at managing it, and would make it go almost 
as swift again as I could. So when he was in, I said to him, 
"Well, now, Friday, shall we go to your nation?" He looked 
very dull at my saying so ; which it seems was because he 
thought the boat too small to go so far. I then told him I 
had a bigger : so the next day I went to the place where the 
first boat lay which I had made, but which I could not get 



E0B1NS0X CRUSOE. 173 

into the water. He said that was big enough : but-then, as 
I had taken no care of it, and it had lain two or three and 
twenty years there, the sun had split and dried it, that it was 
rotten. Friday told me such a boat would do very well, and 
would carry "much enough vittle, drink, bread." 

Upon the whole, I was by this time so fixed upon my de- 
sign of going over with him to the continent, that I told him 
we would go and make one as big as that, and he should go 
home in it. He answered not one word, but looked very 
grave and sad. I asked him what was the matter with him. 
He asked me again, " Why you angry mad with Friday ? — 
what me done?" I asked him what he meant. I told him I 
was not angry with him at all. " No angry !" says he, re- 
peating the words several times, " why send Friday home 
away to my nation?" "Why," says I, "Friday, did not 
you say you wished you were there?" "Yes, yes," says- 
he, " wish we both there ; no wish Friday there, no master 
there." In a word, he would not think of going there with- 
out me. "I go there, Friday?" says I, "what shall I do 
there ?" He turned very quick upon me at this. " You do 
great deal much good," says he ; " you teach wild mans be- 
good, sober, tame mans ; you tell them know God, pray God, 
and live new life." "Alas, Friday !" says I, "thou knowest 
not what thou sayest ; I am but an ignorant man myself." — 
" Yes, yes," says he, " you teachee me good, you teachee 
them good." " No, no, Friday," says I, " you shall go with- 
out me ; leave me here to live by myself as I did before." 
He looked confused again at that word ; and running to one of 
the hatchets which he used to wear, he takes it up hastily, and 
gives it to me. " What must I do with this ?" says I to him. 
" You take kill Friday," says he. " What must I kill you 
for ?" said I again. He returns very quick — " What do you 
send Friday away for ? Take kill Friday, no send Friday 
away." This he spoke so earnestly that I saw tears stand in 
his eyes. In a word, I so plainly discovered the utmost 
affection in him to me, and a firm resolution in him, that I 
told him then, and often after, that I would never send him 
away from me, if he was willing to stay with me. 

Upon the whole, as I found by all his discourse a settled 
affection to me, and that nothing could part him from me, 
so I found all the foundation of his desire to go to his own. 



174 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

country was laid in his ardent affection to the people, and 
his hopes of my doing them good; a thing -which, as I had 
no notion of myself, so I had not the least thought or inten- 
tion, or desire of undertaking it. But still I found a strong 
inclination to attempting my escape, founded on the suppo- 
sition gathered from the discourse, that there were seventeen 
bearded men there ; and therefore, without any more delay, 
I went to work with Friday to find out a great tree proper to 
fell, and make a large periagua, or canoe, to undertake the 
"voyage. There were trees enough in the island to have 
built a little fleet of good large vessels ; but the main thing 
I looked at was, to get one so near the water that Ave might 
launch it when it was made, to avoid the mistake I committed 
at first. At last, Friday pitched upon a tree ; for I found that 
he knew much better than I what kind of food was fittest for 
it. Friday wished to burn the hollow or cavity of this tree 
out, to make it for a boat, but I showed him how to cut it 
with tools ; which, after I had showed how to use, he did 
very handily; and in about a month's hard labour, we 
finished it and made it very handsome ; especially, when, 
with our axes, which I showed him how to handle, we cut 
and hewed the outside into the true shape of a boat. After 
this, however, it cost us near a fortnight's time to get her 
along, as it were, inch by inch, upon great rollers into the 
water : but when she was in, she would have carried twenty 
men with great ease. 

When she was in the water, though she was so big, it 
amazed me to see with what dexterity, and how swift my 
man Friday could manage her, turn her, and paddle her 
along. So I asked him if he would, and if we might, venture 
over in her. "Yes," he said, "we venture over in her very 
well, it-hough great blow wind." However, I had a farther 
design that he knew nothing of, and that was to make a mast 
and a sail, and to fit her with an anchor and a cable. As to 
a mast, that was easy enough to get ; so I pitched upon a 
straight young cedar tree, which I found near the place, and 
which there were great plenty of in the island, and I set 
Friday to work to cut it down, and gave him directions how 
to shape and order it. But as to the sail, that was my parti- 
cular care. I knew I had pieces of old sails enough ; but as 
I had had them now six-and-twenty years by me, and had 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 175 

not been very careful to preserve them, not imagining that I 
should ever have this kind of use for them, I did not doubt 
but they were all rotten ; and, indeed, most of them were so. 
However, I found two pieces, which appeared pretty good, 
and with these I went to work ; and with a great deal of 
pains and awkward stitching, you may be sure, for want of 
needles, 'I at length made a three-cornered ugly thing, like 
what we call in England a shoulder of mutton sail, to go 
with a boom at bottom, and a little short sprit at the top, 
such as usually our ships' long-boats sail with, and such as I 
best knew how to manage, as it was such a one as I had to 
the boat in which I made my escape from Barbary. 

I was near two months performing this last work, viz., 
rigging and fitting my mast and sails ; for I finished them 
very complete, making a small stay, and a sail, or foresail to 
it, to assist if we should turn to windward ; and what was 
more than all, I fixed a rudder to the stern of her to steer 
with. 

After all this was done, I had my man Friday to teach as 
to what belonged to the navigation of my boat ; for, though 
he knew very well how to paddle a canoe, he knew nothing 
of what belonged to a sail and a rudder ; and was the most 
amazed when he saw me work the boat to and again in th e 
sea by the rudder, and how the sail gibbed, and filled this 
way or that way, as the course we sailed changed ; I say, 
■when he saw this, he stood like one astonished and amazed. 
However, with a little use, I made all these things familiar to 
him, and he became an expert sailor — except that of the com- 
pass, I could make him understand very little. On the other 
hand, as there was very little cloudy weather, and seldom or 
never any fogs in those parts, there was the less occasion for 
a compass, seeing the stars were always to be seen by night, 
and the shore by day, except in the rainy seasons, and then 
nobody cared to stir abroad either by land or sea. 

I was now entered on the seven-and-twentieth year of my 
captivity in this place ; though the last three years that I had 
this creature with me ought rather to be left out of the 
account, my habitation being quite of another kind than in 
all the rest of the time. I kept the anniversary of my landing 
here with the same thankfulness to God for his mercies as at 
first : and if I had such cause of acknowledgment at first, I 



17G ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

had much more so now, having such additional testimonies 
of the care of Providence over me, and the great hopes I had 
of being effectually and speedily delivered ; for I had an in- 
vincible impression upon my thoughts that my deliverance 
was at hand, and that I should not be another year in this 
place. I went on, however, with my husbandry ; digging, 
planting, and fencing, as usual. I gathered and cured my 
grapes, and did every necessary thing as before. 

The rainy season was, in the meantime, upon me, when I 
kept more within doors than at other times. We had stowed 
our new vessel as secure as we could, bringing her up into 
the creek, where I landed my rafts from the ship ; and hauling 
her up to the shore at high-water mark, I made my man 
Friday dig a little dock, just big enough to hold her, and just 
deep enough to give her water to float in ; and then, when 
the tide was out, we made a strong dam across the end of it, 
to keep the water out ; and so she lay dry as to the tide from 
the sea : and to keep the rain off, we laid a great many boughs 
of trees, so thick that she was as well thatched as a house ; 
and thus we waited for the months of November and Decem- 
ber, in which I designed to make my adventure. 

When the settled season began to come in, as the thought 
of my design returned with the fair weather, I was preparing 
daily for the voyage. And the first thing I did was to lay 
by a certain quantity of provisions, being the stores for our 
voyage ; and intended, in a week or a fortnight's time, to open 
the dock, and launch out our boat. I was busy one morning 
upon something of this kind, when I called to Friday, and 
bid him to go to the sea-shore, and see if he could find a turtle 
or tortoise, a thing which we generally got once a-week, for 
the sake of the eggs as well as the flesh. Friday had not 
been long gone when he came running back, and flew over 
my outer wall or fence, like one that felt not the ground, or 
the steps he set his feet on ; and before I had time to speak 
to him, he cries out to me, " O master ! O master ! O sorrow ! 
O bad ! " — " What's the matter, Friday ?" says I. " O yonder 
there," says he, "one, two, three canoes; one, two, three!" 
By this way of speaking I concluded there were six ; but on 
inquiry, I found there were but three. " Well, Friday," says 
I, " do not be frightened." So I heartened him up as well 
as I could. However, I saw the poor fellow was most terribly 



EOBINSON CRUSOE. 



177 



scared, for nothing ran in his head but that they were 
come to look for him, and -would cut him in pieces and eat 
him ; and the poor fellow trembled so that I scarcely knew 
what to do with him. I comforted him as well as I could, 




Page 23 

and told him I was in as much danger as he, and that they 
would eat me as well as him. " But," says I, " Friday, we 
must resolve to fight them. Can you fight, Friday?" "Me 
shoot," says he, " but there come many great number." " No 
matter for that," said I again ; " our guns will fright those 
that we do not kill." So I asked him whether, if I resolved 



178 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

to defend him, he would defend me, and stand by me, and 
do just as I bid him. He said, " Me die, when you bid die, 
master." So I went and fetched a good dram of rum and 
gave him ; for I had been so good a husband of my rum, that 
I had a great deal left. When he had drunk it, I made him 
take the two fowling-pieces, which we always carried, and 
loaded them with large swan-shot, as big as small pistol- 
bullets. Then I took four muskets, and loaded them with 
two slugs, and rive small bullets each ; and my two pistols I 
loaded with a brace of bullets each. I hung my great sword, 
as usual, naked by my side, and gave Friday his hatchet. 
When I had thus prepared myself, I took my perspective- 
glass, and went up to the side of the hill, to see what I could 
discover ; and I found quickly by my glass, that there were 
one-and-twenty savages, three prisoners, and three canoes ; 
and that their whole business seemed to be the triumphant 
banquet upon these three human bodies. I observed also, 
that they had landed, not where they had done when Friday 
made his escape, but nearer to my creek, where the shore 
was low, and where a thick wood came almost close down to 
the sea. This, with the abhorrence of the inhuman errand 
these wretches eame about, filled me with such indignation 
that I came down again to Friday, and told him I was re- 
solved to go down to them, and kill them all ; and asked him 
if he would stand by me. He had now got over his fright, 
and his spirits being a little raised with the dram I had given 
him, he was very cheerful, and told me, as before, he would 
die when I bid die. 

In this fit of fury I divided the arms which 1 had charged, 
as before, between us ; I gave Friday one pistol to stick in 
his girdle, and three guns upon his shoulder, and I took one 
pistol and the other three guns myself; and in this posture 
we marched out. I took a small bottle of rum in my pocket, 
and gave Friday a large bag with more powder and bullets; 
and as to orders, I charged him to keep close behind me, and 
not to stir, or shoot, or do anything till I bid him, and in the 
meantime not to speak a word. In this posture I fetched a 
compass to my right hand of near a mile, as well to get over 
the creek as to get into the wood, so that I could come within 
shot of them before I should be discovered, which I had irn 
by my glass it was ea*y to do. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 179' 

While I was making this march, my former thoughts re- 
turning, I began to abate my resolution: I do not mean that 
I entertained any fear of their number, for, as they were 
naked, unarmed wretches, it is certain I was superior to them 
— nay, though I had been alone. But it occurred to my 
thoughts, what occasion, much less what necessity, I was in 
to go and dip my hands in blood, to attack people who had 
neither done or intended me any wrong? who, as to me, 
were innocent, and whose barbarous customs were their own 
disaster, being in them a token, indeed, of God's having left 
them, with the other nations of that part of the world, to such 
stupidity, and to such inhuman courses, but did not call me 
to take upon me to be a judge of their actions, much less an 
executioner of His justice, — that whenever He thought fit He 
would take the cause into His own hands, and by national 
vengeance punish them as a people for national crimes, but 
that, in the meantime, it was none of my business, — that it 
was true Friday might justify it, because he was a declared 
enemy, and in a state of war with those very particular 
people, and it was lawful for him to attack them, — but I 
could not say the same with regard to myself. These things 
were so warmly pressed upon my thoughts all the way as I 
went, that I resolved I would only go and place myself near 
them that I might observe their barbarous feast, and that I 
would act then as God should direct ; but that unless some- 
thing offered that was more a call to me than yet I knew of, I 
would not meddle with them. 

With this resolution I entered the wood, and with all 
possible wariness, Friday following close at my heels. I 
marched till I came to the skirt of the wood on the side 
which was next to them, only that one corner of the wood 
lay between me and them. Here I called softly to Friday, 
and showing him a great tree which was just at the corner of 
the wood, I bade him go to the tree, and bring me word if he 
could see tliere plainly what they were doing. He did so, 
and came immediately back to me, and told me they might 
be plainly viewed there, — that they were all about their fire 
eating the flesh of one of their prisoners, and that another lay 
bound upon the sand a little from them, whom he said they 
would kill next, and this fired the very soul within me. He 
told me it was not one of their nation, but one of the bearded 



180 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

men he had told me of, that came to their country in the 
boat. I was filled with horror at the very naming of the 
white-bearded man ; and going to the. tree, I saw plainly by 
my glass a white man, who lay upon the beach of the sea with 
his hands and his feet tied, and that he was an European, and 
had clothes on. 

There was another tree, and a little thicket beyond it, 
about fifty yards nearer to them than the place where I was, 
which, by going a little way about, I saw I might come at 
undiscovered, and that then I should be within half a shot of 
them ; so I withheld my passion, though I was indeed enraged 
to the highest degree: and going back about twenty paces, I 
got behind some bushes, which held all the way till I came 
to the other tree, and then came to a little rising ground, 
which gave me a full view of them at the distance of about 
eighty yards. 

I had now not a moment to lose, for nineteen of the dread- 
ful wretches sat upon the ground, all close huddled together, 
and had just sent the other two to butcher the poor Christian, 
and bring him perhaps limb by limb to their fire, and they 
were stooping down to untie the bands at his feet. I turned 
to Friday : — " Now, Friday," said I, " do as I bid thee." 
Friday said he would. " Then, Friday," says I, " do exactly 
as you see me do ; fail in nothing." So I set down one of the 
muskets and the fowling-piece upon the ground, and Friday 
did the like by his, and with the other musket I took my aim 
at the savages, bidding him to do the like ; then asking him 
if he was ready, he said, " Yes." " Then fire at them," said I ; 
and at the same moment I fired also. 

Friday took his aim so much better than I, that on the 
side that he shot he killed two of them, and wounded three 
more ; and on my side I killed one, and wounded two. They 
were, you may be sure, in a dreadful consternation ; and all 
of them that were not hurt, jumped upon their feet, but did 
not immediately know which way to run, or which way to 
look, for they knew not from whence their destruction came. 
Friday kept his eyes close upon me, that, as I had bid him, 
he might observe what I did ; so, as soon as the first shot was 
made, I threw down the piece, and took up the fowling-piece, 
and Friday did the like ; he saw me cock and present ; he 
did the same again. "Ar« vou ready, Friday?" said I. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 181 

"Yes," says he. "Let fly, then," says I, "in the name of 
God !" and with that I fired again among the amazed wretches, 
and so did Friday ; and as our pieces were now loaded with 
what I call swan-shot, or small pistol-bullets, we found only 
two drop ; but so many were wounded, that they ran about 
yelling and screaming like mad creatures, all bloody, and 
most of them miserably wounded, whereof three more fell 
quickly after, though not quite dead. 

" Now, Friday," says I, laying down the discharged pieces, 
and taking up the musket which was yet loaded, " follow me," 
which he did with a great deal of courage ; upon which I 
rushed out of the wood and showed myself, and Friday close 
at my foot. As soon as I perceived they saw me, I shouted 
as loud as I could, and bade Friday do so too, and running 
as fast as possible towards the poor victim, who was lying 
upon the beach between the place where they sat and the sea. 
The two butchers, who were just going to work with him, had 
left at the surprise of our first fire, and fled in a terrible 
fright to the sea-side, and had jumped into a canoe, and three 
more of the rest made the same way. I turned to Friday, 
and bade him step forwards and fire at them ; he understood 
me immediately, and running about forty yards, to be nearer, 
he shot ; and I thought he had killed them all, for I saw them 
all fall of a heap into the boat, though I saw two of them up 
again quickly ; however, he killed two of thorn, and wounded 
the third so that he lay down in the bottom of the boat as if 
he had been dead. 

While my man Friday fired at them, I pulled out my knife 
and cut the flags that bound the poor victim ; and loosing his 
hands and feet, I lifted him up, and asked him in the Portu- 
guese tongue, what he was. He answered in Latin, Christi- 
anus ; but was so weak and faint that he could scarce stand 
or speak. I took my bottle out of my pocket, and gave it him, 
making signs that he should drink, which he did ; and I gave 
him a piece of bread, which he ate. Then I asKed him what 
countryman he was: and he said Espagniole; and being a 
little recovered, let me know, by all the signs he could possibly 
make, how much he was in my debt for his deliverance. 
" Seignior," said I, with as much Spanish as I could make up, 
" we will talk afterwards, but we must fight now : if you 
have any strength .left, take this pistol and sword, and lay 



182 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

about you." Ho took them very thankfully ; and no sooner 
had he the arras in his hands, but, as if they had put new- 
vigour into him, he flew upon his murderers like a fury, and 
had cut two of them in pieces in an instant; for the truth is, 
as the whole was a surprise to them, so the poor creatures 
were so much frightened with the noise of our pieces that 
they fell down for mere amazement and fear, and had no more 
power to attempt their own escape, than their flesh had to 
resist our shot: and that was the case of those five that 
.Friday shot at in the boat ; for as three of them fell with the 
hurt they received, so the other two fell with the fright. 

I kept my piece in my hand still without firing, being 
willing to keep my charge ready, because I had given tne 
Spaniard my pistol and sword: so I called to Friday, and 
bade him run up to the tree from whence we first fired, and 
fetch the arms which lay there that had been discharged, 
which he did with great swiftness: and then giving him my 
musket, I sat down myself to load all the rest again, and bade 
them come to me when they wanted. While I was loading 
these pieces, there happened a fierce engagement between the 
Spaniard and one of the savages, who made at him with one 
of their great wooden swords, the weapon that was to have 
killed him before, if I had not prevented it. The Spaniard, 
who was as bold and brave as could be imagined, though weak, 
had fought the Indian a good while, and had cut two great 
wounds on his head ; but the savage being a stout, lusty 
fellow, closing in with him, had thrown him down, being 
faint, and was wringing my sword out of his hand ; when the 
Spaniard, though undermost, wisely quitting the sword, drew 
the pistol from his girdle, shot the savage through the body, 
and killed him upon the spot, before I, who was running to 
help him, could come near. 

Friday, being now left to his liberty, pursued the flying 
wretches, with no weapon in his hand but his hatchet; and 
with that he despatched those three who, as I said before, 
were wounded at first, and fallen, and all the rest he could 
come up with : and the Spaniard coming to me for a gun) I 
gave him one of the fowling-pieces, with which he pursued 
two of the savsges, and wounded them both ; but, as he was 
not able to run, they both got from him into the wood, where 
Friday pursued them, and killed one of them, but the other 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 183 

was too nimble for him; and though he was -wounded, yet 
had plunged himself into the sea, and swam with all his might 
off to those two who were left in the canoe, which three in 
the canoe, with one wounded, that we knew not whether he 
died or no, were all that escaped our hands of one-and-twenty. 
The account of the whole is as follows : — three killed at our 
first shot from the tree ; two killed at the next shot ; two 
killed by Friday in the boat ; two killed by Friday, of those 
at first wounded ; one killed by Friday in the wood ; three 
killed by the Spaniard ; four killed, being found dropped here 
and there, of the wounds, or killed by Friday in his chase of 
them ; four escaped in the boat, whereof one wounded, if not 
dead — twenty-one in all. 

Those that were in the canoe worked hard to get out of 
gunshot, and though Friday made two or three shots at them, 
I did not find that he hit any of them. Friday would fain 
have had me take one of their canoes, and pursue them ; and, 
indeed, I was very anxious about their escape, lest carrying 
the news home to their people, they should come back perhaps 
with two or three hundred of the canoes and devour us by 
mere multitude ; so I consented to pursue them by sea, and 
running to one of their canoes, I jumped in, and bade Friday 
follow me : but when I was in the canoe, I was surprised to 
find another poor creature lie there, bound hand and foot, as 
the Spaniard was, for the slaughter, and almost dead with 
fear, not knowing what was the matter ; for he had not been 
able to looii up over the side of the boat, he was tied so hard 
neck and heels, and had been tied so long, that he had really 
but little life in him. 

I immediately cut the twisted flags or rushes, which they 
had bound him with, and would have helped him up ; but he 
could not stand or speak, but groaned most piteously, be- 
lieving, it seems, still, that he was only unbound in order to 
be killed. When Friday came to him I bade him speak to 
him, and tell him of his deliverance ; and pulling out my 
bottle, made him give the poor wretch a dram ; which, with 
the news of his being delivered, revived him, and he sat up in 
the bdat. But when Friday came to hear him speak, and look 
in his face, it would have moved any one to tears to have seen 
how Friday kissed him, embraced and hugged him, cried, 
laughed, hallooed, jumped about, danced, sung ; then cried 



184 EOBINSON CRUSOE. 

again, wrung his hands, beat his own face and head; and 
then sung and jumped about again, like a distracted creature. 
It was a good while before I could make him speak or tell me 
what was the matter ; but when he came a little to himself, 
he told me that it was his father. 

It is not easy for me to express how it moved me to see 
what ecstasy and filial affection had worked in this poor 
savage at the sight of his father, and of his being delivered 
from death; nor, indeed, can I describe half tne extrava- 
gances of his affection after this ; for he went into the boat, 
and out of the boat, a great many times : when he went in to 
him, he would sit down by him, open his breast, and hold his 
father's head close to his bosom for many minutes together, to 
nourish it; then he took his arms and ankles, which were 
numbed and stiff with the binding, and chafed and rubbed 
them with his hands ; and I, perceiving what the case was, 
gave him some rum out of my bottle to rub them with, which 
did them a great deal of good. 

This affair put an end to our pursuit of the canoe with the 
other savages, who were now almost out of sight ; and it was 
happy ;or us that we did not, for it blew so hard within two 
hours after, and before they could be got a quarter of their 
way, and continued blowing so hard all night, and that from 
the north-west, which was against them, that I could not sup- 
pose their boat could live, or that they ever reached their own 
coast. 

But to return to Friday ; he was so busy about his father, 
that I could not find in my heart to take him off for some 
time ; but after I thought he could leave him a little, I called 
him to me, and he came jumping and laughing, and pleased to 
the highest extreme ; then I asked him if he had given his 
father any bread. He shook his head, and said, "None: 
ugly dog eat all up self." I then gave him a cake of bread, out 
of a little pouch I carried on purpose ; I also gave him a dram 
for himself, but he would not taste it, but carried it to his 
father. I had in my pocket two or three bunches of raisins, 
so I gave him a hnndful of them for his father. He had no 
sooner given his father these raisins, but I saw him come out 
of the boat, and run away as if he had been bewitched, for 
he was the swiftest fellow on his feet that ever I saw : I say, 
he ran at such a rate that he was out of sight, as it were, in 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 



185 



an instant ; and though I called, and hallooed out too, after 
him, it was all one — away he went ; and in a quarter of an 
hour I saw him come back again, though not so fast as he 
went ; and, as he came nearer, I found his pace slacker, 




Page 238, 

because he had something in his hand. When he came up to 
me, I found he had been quite home for an earthen jug, to 
bring his father some fresh water, and that he had got two 
more loaves of bread : the bread he gave me, but the water 
he carried to his father ; however, as I was very thirsty too, 
I took a little of it. The water revived his father more than 



18G ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

ail the rum or spirits I had given him, for he was fainting with 
thirst. 

When his father had drunk, I called to him to know if there 
was any water left : he said " Yes ;" and I bride him give it 
to the poor Spaniard, who was in as much want of it as his 
father ; and I sent one of the cakes, that Friday brought, to 
the Spaniard too, who was indeed very weak, and was repos- 
ing himself upon a green place under the shade of a tree ; 
and whose limbs were also very stiff, and very much swelled 
with the rude bandage he had been tied with. When I saw 
that upon Friday's coining to him with the water, he sat up 
and drank, and took the bread and began to eat, I went to 
him and gave him a handful of raisins : he looked up in my 
face with all the tokens of gratitude and thankfulness that 
could appear in any countenance ; but was so weak, notwith- 
standing he had so exerted himself in the fight, that he could 
not stand up upon his feet ; he tried to do it two or three 
times, but was really not able, hi* ankles were so swelled and 
so painful to him ; so I bade him sit still, and caused Friday 
to rub his ankles, and bathe them with rum, as he had done 
his father's. 

I observed the poor affectionate creature, every two minutes, 
turn his head about, to see if his father, was in the same place 
and posture as he left him sitting ; and at last he found he 
was not to be seen; at which he started up, and, without 
speaking a word, flew with that swiftness to him, that one 
could scarce perceive his feet to touch the ground as he went: 
but when he came he only found he had laid himself down to 
ease his limbs, so Friday came back to me presently ; and 
then I spoke to the Spaniard to let Friday help him up, if he 
could, and lead him to the boat, and then he should carry 
him to our dwelling, where I would take care of him. But 
Friday, a lusty strong fellow, took the Spaniard upon his 
back, and carried him away to the boat, and set him down 
softly upon the side of the canoe, with his feet in the inside 
of it ; and then lifting him quite in, he set him close to his 
father ; and presently stepping out again, launched the boat 
off, and paddled it along the shore faster than I could walk: 
so he brought them both safe into our creek, and leaving 
them in the boat, ran away to fetch the other -canoe. As he 
passed me I spoke to him, and asked him whither he went. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 187 

He told me, " Go fetch more boat : " so away he went like the 
wind ; and he had the other canoe in the creek almost as soon 
as I got to it by land ; so ho wafted me over, and then went 
to help our new guests out of the boat, which he did ; but 
they were neither of them able to walk, so that poor Friday 
knew not what to do. 

To remedy this, I went to work in my thought, and calling 
to Friday to bid them sit down on the bank while he came to 
me, I soon made a kind of hand-barrow to lay them on, 
and Friday and I carried them both up together upon it 
between us. 

But when we got them to the outside of our wall, we were 
at a worse loss than before, for it was impossible to get them 
over, and I was resolved not to break it down, so I set to 
work again : and Friday and I, in about two hours' time, 
made a very handsome tent, covered with old sails, and above 
that with boughs of trees, being in the space without our 
outward fence, and between that and the grove of young wood 
which I had planted ; and here we made them two beds of 
such things as I had, viz., of good riee-straw, with blankets 
laid upon it, to lie on, and another to cover them, on each bed. 

My island was now peopled, and I thought myself very 
rich in subjects ; and it was a merry reflection, which I fre- 
quently made, how like a king I looked. 

As soon as I had secured my two weak, rescued prisoners, 
and given them shelter, and a place to rest them upon, I 
began to think of making some provision for them ; and the 
first thing I did, I ordered Friday to take a yearling goat, 
betwixt a kid and a goat, out of my particular flock, to be 
killed; whan I cut off the hinder-quarter, and chopping it 
into small pieces, I set Friday to work to boiling and stewing, 
and made them a very good dish, I assure you, of flesh and 
broth ; and as I cooked it without doors, so I carried it all 
into the new tent, and having set a table there for them, I sat 
down, and ate my own dinner also with them, and, as well as 
I could, cheered and encouraged them. 

After we had dined, I ordered Friday to take one of the 
canoes, and go and fetch our muskets and other fire-arms, 
which, for want of time, we had left upon the place of battle ; 
and, the next day, I ordered him to go and bury the dead 
bodies of the savages. I also ordered hiin to bury the horrid 



188 ROBINSON CRUSOE 

remains of their barbarous feast : all which he punctually per- 
formed, and effaced the very appearance of the savages being 
there ; so that when I went again, I could scarce know where 
it was, otherwise than by the corner of the wood pointing to 
the place. 

I then began to enter into a little conversation with my two 
new subjects : and, first, I set Friday to inquire of his father 
what he thought of the escape of the savages in that canoe, 
and whether we might expect a return of them, witli a power 
too great for us to resist. His first opinion was, that the 
savages in the boat never could live out the storm which 
blew that night they went off, but must, of necessity, bo 
drowned, or driven south to those other shores, where they 
were as sure to be devoured as they were to be drowned if 
they were to be cast away : but, as to what they would do, if 
they came safe on shore, he said he knew not ; but it was his 
opinion, that they were so dreadfully frightened with the 
manner of their being attacked, the noise, and the fire, that 
he believed they would tell the people they were all killed by 
thunder and lightning, not by the hand of man ; and that the 
two which appeared, viz., Friday and I, were two heavenly 
spirits, or furies, come down to destroy them, and not men 
with weapons. This, he said, he knew ; because he heard 
them all cry out so, in their language, one to another; for it 
was impossible for them to conceive that a man could dart 
fire, and speak thunder, and kill at a distance, without lifting 
up the hand, as was done now : and this old savage was in 
the right; for, as I understood since, by other hands, the 
savages never attempted to go over to the island afterwards, 
they were so terrified with the accounts given by those four 
men (for it seems they did escape the sea), that they believed 
whoever went to that enchanted island would be destroyed 
with fire from the gods. This, however, I knew not ; and, 
therefore, was under continual apprehensions for a good while, 
and kept always upon my guard, with all my army ; for, as 
there were now four of us, I would have ventured upon a 
hundred of them, fairly in the open field, at any time. 

In a little time, however, no more canoes appearing, the 
fear of their coming wore off; and I began to take my former 
thoughts of a voyage to the main into consideration ; being 
likewise assured, by Friday's father, that I might depend upon 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 189 

good usage from their nation, on his account, if I would go. 
But my thoughts were a little suspended when I had a serious 
discourse with the Spaniard, and when I understood that 
there were sixteen more of his countrymen and Portuguese, 
who having been cast away and made their escape to that 
side, lived there at peace, indeed, with the savages, but were 
very sore put to it for necessaries, and, indeed, for life. I 
asked him all the particulars of their voyage, and found they 
were a Spanish ship, bound from the Kio de la Plata to the 
Havanna, being directed to leave their loading there, which 
was chiefly hides and silver, and to bring back what European 
goods they could meet with there ; that they had five Portu- 
guese seamen on board, whom they took out of another 
wreck ; that five of their own men were drowned, when first 
the ship was lost, and that these escaped through infinite 
dangers and hazards, and arrived, almost starved, on the can- 
nibal coast, where they expected to have been devoured every 
moment. He told me they had some arms with them, but 
they were perfectly useless, for that they had neither powder 
nor ball, the washing of the sea having spoiled all their powder, 
but a little, which they used at their first landing, to provide 
themselves some food. 

I asked him what he thought would become of them there, 
and if they had formed any design of making their escape. 
He said they had many consultations about it ; but that having 
neither vessel, nor tools to build one, nor provisions of any 
kind, their councils always ended in tears and despair. I 
asked him how he thought they would receive a proposal from 
me, which might tend towards an escape ; and whether, if they 
were all here, it might not be done. I told him, with freedom, 
I feared mostly their treachery and ill usage of me, if I put 
my life in their hands ; for that gratitude was no inherent 
virtue in the nature of man, nor did men always square their 
dealings by the obligations they had received, so much as they 
did by the advantages they expected. 

He answered, with a great deal of candour and ingenuous- 
ness, that their condition was so miserable, and that they were 
so sensible of it, that he believed they would abhor the thought 
of using any man unkindly that should contribute to their 
deliverance ; and that, if I pleased, he would go to them, with 
the old man, and discourse with them about it, and return 



190 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 



again, and bring me their answer; that he would make con- 
ditions with them upon their solemn oath, that they should be 
absolutely under my direction, as their commander and cap- 
tain : and they should swear upon the holy sacraments and 
gospel to be true to me, and go to such Christian country as 
I should agree to, and no other; and to be directed wholly 
and absolutely by my orders, till they were landed safely in 
such country as I intended ; and that he would bring a con- 
tract from them, under their hands, for that purpose. Then 
he told me he would first swear to me himself, that he would 
never stir from me as long as he lived, till I gave him orders ; 
and that he would take my side to the last drop of his blood, 
if there should happen the least breach of faith among his 
countrymen. He told me they were all of them very civil, 
honest men, and they were under the greatest distress imagi- 
nable, having neither weapons or clothes, nor any food, but at 
the mercy and discretion of the savages ; out of all hopes of 
ever returning to their own country ; and that he was sure, 
if I would undertake their relief, they would live and die 
by me. 

Upon these assurances, I resolved to venture to relieve 
them, if possible, and to send the old savage and this Spaniard 
over to them to treat. But when we had got all things in 
readiness to go, the Spaniard himself started an objection, 
which had so much prudence in it on one hand, and so much 
sincerity on the other hand, that I could not but be very well 
satisfied in it ; and, by his advice, put off the deliverance of 
his comrades for at least half a year. The case vas thus : he 
had been with us now about a month, during which time I 
had let him see in what manner I had provided, with the 
assistance of Providence, for my support ; and he saw evi- 
dently what stock of corn and rice I had laid up: which, 
though it was more than sufficient for myself, yet it was not 
sufficient, without good husbandry, for my family, now it was 
increased to four ; but much less would it be sufficient if his 
countrymen, who were, as he said, sixteen, still alive, should 
come over ; and, least of all, would it be sufficient to victual 
our vessel, if we should build one, for a voyage to any of the 
Christian colonies of America ; so he told me he thought it 
would be more advisable to let him and the other two dig and 
cultivate some more land, as much as I could spare seed to 



EOEIXSON CRUSOE. 191 

sow, and that we should wait another harvest that we might 
have a supply of corn for his countrymen, when they should 
come ; for want might be a temptation to them to disagree, 
or not to think themselves delivered, otherwise than out of 
one difficulty into another. 

His caution was so seasonable, and his advice so good, that 
I could not but be very well pleased with his proposal, as u ell 
as I was satisfied with his fidelity; so we fell to digging, all 
four of us, as well as the wooden tools we were furnished with 
permitted; and, in about a month's time, by the end of 
which it was seed-time, we had got as much land cured and 
trimmed up, as we sowed two-and-twenty bushels of barley 
on, and sixteen jars of rice, which was all the seed wo had to 
spare : indeed, we left ourselves barely sufficient for our own 
food, for the six months that we had to expect our crop, 
reckoning from the time we set our seed aside for sowing; 
for it is not to be supposed it is six months in the ground in 
that country. 

Having now society enough, and our number being suffi- 
cient to put us out of fear of the savages, if they had come, 
unless their number had been very great, we went freely all 
over the island, whenever we found occasion; and as we had 
our escape or deliverance upon our thoughts, it was impossi- 
ble, at least for me, to have the means of it out of mine. For 
this purpose, I marked out several trees, which I thought fit 
for our work, and I set Friday and his father to cut them 
down; and then I caused the Spaniard, to whom I imparted 
my thoughts on that affair, to oversee and direct their work. 
I showed them with what indefatigable pains I ha'd hewed a 
large tree into single planks, and I caused them to do the 
like, till they had made about a dozen large planks of good 
oak, near two feet broad, thirty-five feet long, and from two 
inches to four inches thick : what prodigious labour it took 
up, anyone may imagine. 

At the same time, I contrived to increase my little flock of 
tame goats as much as I could ; and, for this purpose, I madf 
Friday and the Spaniard go out one day, and myself with 
Friday the next day (for we took our turns), and by this 
means we got about twenty young kids to breed up with th< 
rest; for whenever we shot the dam, we saved the kids, an' 
added them to our flock. But, above all, the season f< 



192 IIOBINSON CRUSOE. 

curing the grapes coming on, I caused such a prodigious 
quantity to be hung up in the sun, that I believe we could 
have filled sixty or eighty barrels ; and these, with our bread, 
formed a great part of our food. 

It was now harvest, and our crop in good order ; it was not 
the most plentiful increase I had seen in the island, but, how- 
ever, it was enough to answer our end ; for, from twenty-two 
bushels of barley, we brought in and threshed out above two 
hundred and twenty bushels ; and the like in proportion of 
the rice, which was store enough for our food to the next 
harvest, though all the sixteen Spaniards had been on shore 
with me ; or, if we had been ready for a voyage, it would 
very plentifully have victualled our ship to have carried us to 
any part of America. When we had thus housed and secured 
our magazine of corn, we fell to work to make more great 
baskets, in which we kept it; and the Spaniard was very 
handy and dexterous at this. 

And now, having a full supply of food for all the guests I 
expected, I gave the Spaniard leave to go over to the main, 
to see what he could do with those he had left behind him 
there. I gave him a strict charge not to bring any man with 
him who would not first swear, in the presence of himself and 
the old savage, that he would no way injure, fight with, or 
attack the person he should find in the island, who was so 
kind as to send for them in order to their deliverance ; but 
that they would stand by him and defend him against all such 
attempts, and wherever they went, would be entirely under 
and subjected to his command ; and that this should be put 
in writing, and signed in their hands. How they were to 
have done this when I knew they had neither pen or ink, was 
a question we never asked. Under these instructions the 
Spaniard and the old savage went away in one of the canoes 
which they might be said to come in, or rather were brought 
in, when they came as prisoners to be devoured by the 
savages. I gave each of them a musket, with a firelock on it, 
and about eight charges of powder and ball, charging them 
to be very good husbands of both, and not to use either of 
them but upon urgent occasions. 

This was a cheerful work, being the first measures used by 
me, in view of my deliverance, for now twenty-seven years 
and some days. I gave them provisions of bread, and of

dried grapes, sufficient for themselves for many days, and 
sufficient for all the Spaniards for about eight days' time ;

and wishing them a good voyage, I Saw them go, agreeing 
■with them "about a signal they should hang out at their re- 
turn, by which I should know them acrain vhen they came 



134 ItOBINSO.V CRUSOE 

back, at a distance, before thoy came on shore. They went 
away, with a fair gale, on the day that the moon was at full, 
by my account in the month of October. 

It was no less than eight days I had waited for them, when 
a strange and unforeseen accident intervened, of which the 
like has not, perhaps, been heard of in history. I was fast 
asleep in my hutch one morning, when my man Friday came 
running in to me, and called aloud, " Master, master, they 
are come, they are come !" I jumped up, and, regardless ot 
danger, I went out as soon as I could get my clothes on, 
through my little grove, which, by the way, was by this time 
grown to be a very thick wood ; I went •without my arms, 
which was not my custom to do : but I was surprised, when, 
turning my eyes to the jsea, I presently saw a boat at about a 
league and a half distance, standing in for the shore, with a 
shoulder-of-*snitt©n sail, and the wind blowing pretty fair. to 
bring them in: also I observed, presently, that they did not 
come from that fide which the shore lay on, but from the 
southernmost end of the island. Upon this I called Friday in, 
and bade him lie close, for these were not the people we 
looked for, and that we might not know yet whether they 
were friends or enemies. In the next plaee, I went in to 
fetch nvy perspective glass, to see what I could make of them; 
and, having taken the ladder out, I climbed to the top of the 
hill, as I used to do when I was apprehensive of anything - , 
and to take my view the plainer, without being discovered. I 
had scarce set my foot upon the hill, when my eye plainly 
discovered a ship lying at an anchor, at about two leagues and 
a half distance from me, S.S.E., but not abonea league and a 
half from the shore. By my observation, it appeared plainly 
to be an English ship, and the boat appeared to be an Eng- 
lish long-boat. 

I cannot express the confusion I was in, though the joy of 
seeing a »hip, .and one -that I had reason to believe was 
manned by my own countrymen, and consequently friends, 
was such as I canno£ describe ; but yet I ■ had some secret 
doubts hanging about me, bidding me keep upon my guard. 
In the first place, it occurred to me to consider what business 
an English ship could have in that part of the world, since it 
was not the way to or from any part of the world where the 
-English had any traffic ; and I knew there had been no storms 



kobixso:,' ciiusoe. 195 

to drive them in there, in distress ; and that if they were 
really English, it was most probable that they were here 
upon no good design ; and that I had better continue as I 
was, than fall into the hands of thieves and murderers. 

Had I not been made cautious, I had been undone inevi- 
tably, and in a far worse condition than before, as you will see 
presently. I had not kept myself long in this posture, till I 
saw the boat draw near the shore, as if they looked for a 
creek to thrust in at, for the convenience of landing ; however, 
as they did not come quite far enough they did not see the 
little inlet where I formerly landed my rafts, but run their 
boat on shore upon the beach, at about half a mile from me, 
■which was very happy for me ; for otherwise they would have 
landed just at my door, as I may say, and would soon have 
beaten me out of my castle, and perhaps have plundered me 
of all I had. When they were on shore, I was fully satisfied 
they were Englishmen, at least most of them ; one or two I 
thought were Dutch, but it did not prove so ; there were in 
all eleven men, whereof three of them I found were unarmed, 
and, as I thought, bound ; and when the first four or five of 
them jumped on shore, they took those throe out of the boat, 
as prisoners : one of the three I could perceive, using the 
most passionate gestures of entreaty, affliction, and despair, 
even to a kind of extravagance ; the other two, I could per- 
ceive, lifted up their hands sometimes, and appeared concerned, 
indeed, but not to such a degree as the first. I was perfectly 
confounded at the sight, and knew not what the meaning of 
it should be. Friday called out to me in English, as well as 
he could, " master ! you see English mans eat prisoner as 
well as savage mans." " Why, Friday," says I, " do you 
think they are going to eat them then ?" " Yes," says Friday, 
" they will eat them." " No, no," says I, " Friday ; I am 
afraid they will murder them, indeed ; but you may be sure 
they will not eat them." 

All this while I had no thought of what the matter really 
was, but stood trembling with the horror of the sight, ex- 
pecting every moment when the three prisoners should be 
killed ; nay, once I saw one of the villains lift up his arms 
■with a great cutlass, to strike one of the poor men ; and I 
expected to see him fall every moment; at which all the blood 
in my body seemed to run chill in my veins. I wished 



196 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

heartily now for the Spaniard, and the savage that was gone 
with him, or that I had any way to have come undiscovered 
within shot of them, that I might have secured the three men, 
for I saw they had among them no fire-arms ; but it fell out 
to my mind another way. After I had observed the out- 
rageous usage of the three men by the insolent seamen, the 
fellows ran scattering about the island, as if they wanted to 
see the country. I observed that the three other men had 
liberty to go also where they pleased ; but they sat down all 
three upon the ground, very pensive, and looked like men in 
despair. 

It was just at high water when these people came on shore , 
and while they rambled about to see what kind of a place 
"they were in, they had carelessly staid till the tide was spent, 
and the water was ebbed considerably away, leaving their 
boat aground. They had left two men in the boat, who, as I 
found afterwards, having drunk a little too much brandy, fell 
asleep ; however, one of them waking a little sooner than the 
other, and finding the boat too far aground for him to stir it, 
hallooed out for the rest, who were straggling about ; upon 
which they all soon came to the boat : but it was past all 
their strength to launch her, being very heavy, and the shore 
on that side being a soft oozy sand, almost like a quicksand. 
In this condition they gave it over, and away they strolled 
about the country again ; and I heard one of them say aloud 
to another, calling them off from the boat, " Why, let her 
alone, Jack, can't you ? she'll float next tide :" by which I 
was fully confirmed in the main inquiry of what countrymen 
they were. All this while I kept myself very close, not once 
daring to stir out of my castle, any farther than to my place 
of observation, near the top of the hill ; and very glad I was 
to think how well it was fortified. I knew it was no less than 
ten hours before the boat could float again, and by that time 
it would be dark, and I might be at more liberty to see their 
motions, and to hear their discourse, if they had any. In the 
meantime, I fitted myself up for a battle, as before, though 
with more caution, knowing I had to do with another kind of 
enemy than I had at first. I ordered Friday also, whom I 
had made an excellent marksman with his gun, to load himself 
with arms. I took myself two fowling-pieces, and I gave him 
three muskets. My figure, indeed, was very fierce ; I had my 



ROBINSON CUUSOE. 197 

formidable goat-skin coat on, with the great cap I have men- 
tioned, a naked sword by my side, two pistols in my belt, and 
a gun upon each shoulder. 

It was my design, as I said above, not to have made any 
attempt till it was dark ; but about two o'clock, being the 
heat of the day, I found that they were all gone straggling 
into the woods, and, as I thought, laid down to sleep. The 
three poor distressed men, too anxious for their condition to 
get any sleep, had, however, sat clown under the shelter of a 
great tree, at about a quarter of a mile from me, and, as I 
thought, out of sight of any of the rest. Upon this I resolved 
to discover myself to them, and learn something of their con- 
dition : immediately I marched, my man Friday at a good 
distance behind me, as formidable for his arms as I, but not 
making quite so staring a spectre-like figure as I did. I came 
as near them undiscovered as I could, and then, before any 
of them saw me, I called aloud to them in Spanish, " What 
are ye, gentlemen ? " They started up at the noise, but were 
ten times more confounded when they saw me, and the uncouth 
figure that I made. They made no answer at all, but I thought 
I perceived them just going to fly from me, when 1 spoke to 
them in English. " Gentlemen," said I, " do not be surprised 
at me ; perhaps you may have a friend near when you did 
not expect it." " He must be sent directly from Heaven 
then," said one of them very gravely to me, and pulling off 
his hat at the same time to me ; " for our condition is past the 
help of man." li All help is from Heaven, sir," said I : " but 
can you put a stranger in the way to help you? for you seem 
to be in some great distress. I saw you when you landed ; 
and when you seemed to make application to the brutes that 
came with vou, I saw one of them lift up his sword to kill 

you." 

The poor man, with tears running down his face, and 
trembling, looked like one astonished, returned, " Am I talking 
to God or man ? Is it a real man or an angel ? " " Be in no 
fear about that, sir," said I ; "if God had sent an angel to 
relieve you, he would have come better clothed, and armed 
after another manner than you see me. Pray lay aside your 
fears ; I am a man, an Englishman, and disposed to assist you. 
You see I have one servant only ; we have arms and ammuni- 
tion : tell us freely, can we serve you ? What is your case ? : ' 



198 



EOBINSON CRUSOE. 



" Our case, sir," said he, " is too long to tell you, while our 
murderers are so near us ; but, in short, sir, I was commander 
of that ship ; my men have mutinied against me ; they have 
been hardly prevailed on not to murder me, and, at last, have 
set me on shore in this desolate place, with these two men 
with me — one my mate, the other a passenger, where we ex- 
pected to perish, believing the place to be uninhabited, and 
know not yet what to think of it." " Where are these brutes, 
your enemies ? " said I ; "do you know where they are gone ? " 
"There they lie, sir," said he, pointing to a thicket of trees; 
"my heart trembles for fear they have seen us, and heard you 
speak ; if they have, they will certainly murder us all." 
" Have they any fire-arms ? " said I. He answered, " They 
had only two pieces, one of which they left in the boat." 
" Well, then," said I, " leave the rest to me. I see they are 
all asleep ; it is an easy thing to kill them all ; but shall we 
rather take them prisoners?" He told me there were two 
desperate villains among them that it was scarce safe to show 
any mercy to ; but if they were secured, he believed all the 
rest would return to their duty. I asked him which they 
were ? He told me he could not at that distance distinguish 
them, but he would obey my orders in anything I would 
direct. " Well," says I, " let us retreat out of their view or 
hearing, lest they awake, and we will resolve further." So 
they willingly went back with me, till the woods covered us 
from them. 

" Look you, sir," said I, " if I venture upon your deliver- 
ance, are you willing to make two conditions with me?" He 
anticipated my proposals by telling me that both he and the 
ship, if recovered, should be wholly directed and commanded 
by me in everything ; and if the ship was not recovered, he 
would live and die with me in what part of the world soever 
I would send him ; and the two other men said the same. 
"Well," says I, "my conditions are but two; first, — that 
while you stay in this island with me, you will not pretend to 
any authority here ; and if I put arms in your hands, you 
will, upon all occasions, give them up to me, and do no pre- 
judice to me or mine upon this island, and in the meantime 
b» governed by my orders ; secondly, — that if the ship is 
recovered, you will carry me and my man to England passage 
free," 



EOBINSOX CRUSOE. 199 

He gave me all the assurances that the invention or faith 
of man could devise that he would comply with these most 
reasonable demands, and besides would owe his life to me v 
and acknowledge it upon all occasions as long as he lived. 
" Well, then," said I, " here are three muskets for you, with 
powder and ball ; tell me next what you think is proper to be 
done." He showed all the testimonies of his gratitude that 
he was able, but offered to be wholly guided by me. I told 
him I thought it was hard venturing anything ; but the best 
method I could think of was to fire on them at once as they 
lay, and if any were not killed at the first volley, and offered to 
submit, we might save them, and so put it wholly upon God's 
providence to direct the shot. He said, very modestly, that 
he was loath to kill them, if he could help it ; but that those 
two were incorrigible villains, and had been the authors of all 
the mutiny in the ship, and if they escaped, we should be 
undone still, for they would go on board and bring the whole 
ship's company, and destroy us all. "Well, then," says I, 
<l necessity legitimates my advice, for it is the only way to 
save our lives." However, seeing him still cautious of shed- 
ding blood, I told him ihey should go themselves, and manage 
as they found convenient. 

In the middle of this discourse we heard some of them 
awake, and soon after we saw two of them on their feet. I 
asked him if either of them were the heads of tne mutiny ? 
He said, " No." " Well, then," said I, " you may let them 
escape ; and Providence seems to have awakened them on 
purpose to save themselves. Now," says I, " if the rest escape 
you, it is your fault." Animated with this, he took the 
musket I had given him in his hand, and a pistol in his belt, 
and his two comrades with him, with each a piece in his hand; 
the two men who were with him going first made some nois, 
at which one of the seamen, who was awake, turned about, 
and seeing them coming, cried out to the rest ; but it was too 
late then, for the moment lie cried out they fired — I mean the 
two men, the captain wisely reserving his own piece. They 
had so well aimed their shot at the men they knew, that one 
of them was killed on the spot, and the other very much 
w.Hiu<led ; but not being dead, he started up on his feet, and 
called eagerly for help to the other; but the captain, stepping 
to him, told him it was too late to cry for help, he should call 



200 KOBINSON CRUSOE. 

upon God to forgive his villany, and with that word knocked 
him down with the stock of his musket, so that he never spoke 
more: there were three more in the company, and one of 
them was slightly wounded. By this time I was come ; and 
when they saw their danger, and that it was in vain to resist, 
they begged for mercy. The captain told them he would spare 
their lives if they would give him an assurance of their abhor- 
rence of the treachery they had been guilty of, and would 
swear to be faithful to him in recovering the ship, and after- 
wards in carrying her back to Jamaica, whence they came. 
They gave him all the protestations of their sincerity that 
could be desired : and he was willing to believe them, and 
spare their Jives, which I was not against, only that I obliged 
him to keep them bound hand and foot while they were on 
the island. 

While this was doing, I sent Friday with the captain's mate 
to the boat with orders to secure her, and bring away the 
oars and sails, which they did ; and by-and-by three straggling 
men, that were (happily for them) parted from the rest, came 
back upon hearing the guns fired ; and seeing the captain, 
who was before their prisoner, now their conqueror, they 
submitted to be bound also ; and so our victory was complete. 

It now remained that the captain and I should inquire into 
one another's circumstances. I began first, and told him my 
■whole history, which he heard with an attention even to 
amazement, — and particularly at the wonderful manner of my 
being furnished with provisioiJf and ammunition ; and, indeed, 
as my story is a whole collection of wonders, it affected him 
deeply. But when he reflected from thence upon himself, 
and how I seemed to have been preserved there on purpose to 
save his life, the tears ran down his face, and he could not 
speak a word more. After this communication was at an end, 
I carried him and his two men into my apartment, leading 
them in just whore I came out, viz., at the top of the house, 
where I refreshed him with such provision as I had, and 
showed them all the contrivances I had made during my long, 
long inhabiting that place. 

All I showed them, all I said to them, was perfectly 
amazing ; but above all, the captain admired my fortification, 
and how perfectly I had concealed my retreat with a grove of 
trees, which, having been now planted near twenty years, and

board, who, having entered into a cursed conspiracy, by which 
they had all forfeited their lives to the law, would be hardened 
in it now by desperation, and would carry it on, knowing that 
if they were subdued they would be brought to the gallows as 
soon as they came to England, or to any of the English 
colonies, and that therefore there would be no attacking them 
with so small a number as we were. 

I mused for some time upon what he had said, and found 
it was a very rational conclusion, and that therefore something 
was to be resolved on speedily, as well to draw the men on 
board into some snare for their surprise, as to prevent their 
landing upon us, and destroying us. Upon this, it presently 
occurred to me that -in a little while the ship's crew, wonder- 
ing what was become of their comrades and of the boat, 
would certainly come on shore in their other boat to look for 
them, and that then perhaps they might come armed, and be 
too strong for us ; this he allowed to be rational. Upon this, 
I told him the first thing we had to do was to stave the boat, 
which lay upon the beach, so that they might not carry her 
off, and taking everything out of her,, leave her so far useless 
as not to be fit to swim ; accordingly, we went on board, took 
the arms which were left on board out of her, and whatever 
else we found there, — which was a bottle of brandy, and 
another of rum, a few biscuit-cakes, a horn of powder, and a 
great lump of sugar in a piece of canvas, all which was very 
welcome to me, especially the brandy and sugar, of which I 
had had none left for many years. 

When we had carried all these things on shore, we knocked 
a great hole in her bottom, that if they had come strong enough 
to master us, yet they could not carry off the boat. Indeed, 
it was not much in my thoughts that we could be able to 
recover the ship ; but my view was, that if they went away 
without the boat, I did not much question to make her again 
fit to carry us to the Leeward Islands, and call upon our 
friends the Spaniards in my way, for I had them still in my 
thoughts. 

While we were thus preparing our designs, and had first, 
by main strength, heaved the boat upon the beach, so high 
that the tide would not float her off at high water mark, and 
be31O.es, had broke a hole in her bottom too big to be quickly 
stopped, and were set down musing what we should do, we 



• EOBINSOX CRUSOE. 203 

heard the ship fire a gun, and make a waft with her ensign as 
a signal for the boat to come on board : but no boat stirred ; 
and they fired several times, making other signals for the 
boat. At last, when all their signals and firing proved fruit- 
less, and they found the boat did not stir, we saw them, by 
the help of my glasses, hoist another boat out, and row to- 
wards the shore; and we found, as they approached, that 
there were no less than ten men in her, and that they had 
fire-arms with them. 

As the ship lay almost two leagues from the shore, we had 
a full view of them as they came, and a plain sight even of 
their faces ; because the tide having set them a little to the 
east of the other boat, they rowed up under shore, to come to 
the same place where the other had landed, and where the 
boat lay ; the captain knew the persons and characters of all 
the men in the boat, of whom, he said, there were three very 
honest fellows, who, he was sure, were led into this conspi- 
racy by the rest, being overpowered and frightened ; but that 
as for the boatswain, who it seems was the chief officer among 
them, and all the rest, they were as outrageous as any of the 
ship's crew, and were no doubt made desperate in their now 
enterprise ; and terribly apprehensive he was that they would 
be too powerful for us. I smiled at him, and told him that 
men in our circumstances were past the operation of fear. I 
asked lrim what he thought of the circumstances of my life, 
and whether a deliverance were not worth venturing for ? 
" And where, sir," said I, " is your belief of my being pre- 
served here on purpose to save your life, which elevated you 
a little while ago ? For my part," said I, " there seems to be 
but one thing amiss in all the prospect of it." " What is 
that V says he. " Why," said I, " it is, that as you say there 
are three or four honest fellows among them, which should be 
spared, had they been all of the wicked part of the crew, I 
should have thought God's providence had singled them out 
to deliver them into your hands ; for depend upon it every 
man that comes ashore is our own, and shall die or live as 
they behave to us." As I spoke this with a raised voice and 
cheerful countenance, I found it greatly encouraged 'him ; so 
we set vigorously to our business. 

We had, upon the first appearance of the boats coming 
from the ship, considered of separating our prisoners ; and we 



204 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

had, indeed, secured them effectually. Two of them, of whom 
the captain was less assured, I sent with Friday, and one of 
the three delivered men, to my cave, where they were remote 
enough, and out of danger of being heard or discovered, or 
of finding their way out of the woods if they could have de- 
livered themselves : here they left them bound, but gave them 
provisions ; and promised them, if they continued there 
quietly, to give them their liberty in a day or two ; but that 
if they attempted their escape, they should be put to death 
"without mercy. They promised faithfully to bear their con- 
finement with patience, and were very thankful that they had 
such good usage as to have provisions and light left them ; 
for Friday gave them candles (such as we made ourselves) for 
their comfort; and they did not know but that he stood sen- 
tinel over them at the entrance. 

The other prisoners had better usage ; two of them were 
kept pinioned, because the captain was not able to trust them ; 
but the two other were taken into my service, upon the cap- 
tain's recommendation, and upon their solemnly engaging to 
live and die with us ; so with them and the three honest men 
we were seven men, well armed ; and I made no doubt we 
should be able to deal well enough with the ten that were 
coming, considering that the captain had said there were three 
or four honest men among them also. As soon as they got 
to the place where their other boat lay, they ran thejr boat 
into the beach and came all on shore, hauling the boat up 
after them, which I was glad to see, for I was afraid they 
would rather have left the boat at an anchor some distance from 
the shore, with some hands in her to guard her, and so we should 
not be able to seize the boat. Being on shore, the first thing 
they did, they ran all to their other boat ; and it was easy to 
see they were under a great surprise to find her stripped, as 
above, of all that was in her, and a great hole in her bottom. 
After they had mused awhile upon this, they set up two or 
three great shouts, hallooing with all their might, to try if 
they could make their companions hear ; but all was to no 
purpose : then they came all close in a ring, and fired a vol- 
ley of their small arms, which, indeed, we heard, and the 
echoes made the woods ring. They were so astonished at the 
surprise of this, that, as they told us afterwards, they resolved 
to go all on aboard again to their ship, and let them know 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 205 

that the men were all murdered, and the long-boat staved ; 
accordingly, they immediately launched their boat again, and 
got all of them on board. 

The captain was terribly amazed, and even confounded, at 
this, believing they would go on board the ship again, and set 
sail, giving their comrades over for lost, and so he should still 
lose the ship, which he was in hopes we should have re- 
covered ; but he was quickly as much frightened the other 
way. 

They had not been long put off with the boat, when we 
perceived them all coming on shore again : but with this new 
measure in their conduct, which it seems they consulted to- 
gether upon, viz., to leave three men in the boat, and the rest 
to go on shore, and go up into the country to look for their 
fellows. This was a great disappointment to us, for now we 
were at a loss what to do, as our seizing those seven men on 
shore would be no advantage to us if we let the boat escape ; 
because they would row away to the ship, and then the rest 
of them would be sure to weigh and set sail, and so our re- 
covering the ship would be lost. However, we had no remedy 
but to wait and see what the issue of things might present. 
The seven men came on shore, and the three who remained 
in the boat put her off to a good distance from the shore, and 
came to an anchor to wait for them ; so that it was impossible 
for us to come at them in the boat. Those that came on 
shore kept close together, marching towards the top of the 
little hill under which my habitation lay ; and we could see 
them plainly, though they could not perceive us. We should 
have been very glad if they would have come nearer to us, 
so that we might have fired at them, or that they would have 
gone farther off, that we might come abroad. But when they 
were come to the brow of the hill, where they could see a 
great way into the valleys and woods, they shouted and 
hallooed till they were weary ; and not caring, it seems, to 
venture far from the shore, nor far from one another, they sat 
down together under a tree to consider it. 

The captain made a very just proposal to me upon this con- 
sultation of theirs— viz., that perhaps they would all fire a 
volley again, to endeavour to make their fellows hear, and 
that we should all sally upon them just at the juncture when 
their pieces were all discharged, and they would certainly 



206 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

yield, and we should have them without bloodshed. I liked 
this proposal, provided it was done while we were near 
enough to come up to them before they could load their 
pieces again. But this event did not happen ; and we lay 
still a long time, very irresolute what course to take. At 
length, I told them there would be nothing done, in my 
opinion, till night ; and then • if they did not return to the 
boat, perhaps we might find a way to get between them and 
the shore, and so might use some stratagem with them in the 
boat to get them on shore. We waited a great while, though 
very impatient for their removing ; and were very uneasy 
when, after long consultation, we saw them all start up, and 
march down towards the sea ; it seems they had such dread- 
ful apprehensions of the danger of the place, that they re- 
solved to go on board again, give their companions over for 
lost, and so go on with their intended voyage with the ship. 

As soon as I perceived them go towards the shore, I thought 
of a stratagem to fetch them back again, and which answered 
my end to a tittle. I ordered Friday and the captain's mate 
to go over the little creek westward, towards the place where 
the savages came on shore when Friday was rescued, and so 
soon as they came to a little rising ground, at about half a 
mile distance, I bade them halloo out, as loud as they could, 
and wait till they found the seamen heard them ; that as soon 
as ever they heard the seamen answer them, they should re- 
turn it again ; and then, keeping out of sight, take a round, 
always answering when the others hallooed to draw them as 
far into the island, and among the woods as possible, and 
then wheel about again to me by such ways as I directed 
them. 

They were just going into the boat when Friday and the 
mate hallooed : and they presently heard them, and, answer- 
ing, ran along the shore westward, towards the voice they 
heard, when they were stopped by the creek, where, the 
water being up, they could not get over, and called for the 
boat to come up and set them over; as, indeed, I expeettvi. 
When they had set themselves over, I observed that the boar, 
being gone a good way into the creek, they took one of the throe 
men out of her to go along with. them, and left only two in 
the boat, having fastened her to the stump of a little tree on 
the shore. This was what I wished for: and immediately 



ROBINSON CRUSOE, 207 

leaving Friday and the captain's mate to their business, I 
took the rest with me, and crossing the creek out of their 
sight, we surprised the two men before they were aware ; one 
of them lying on the shore and the other being in the boat. 
The fellow on shore was between sleeping and waking, anil 
going to start up ; the captain, who was foremost, ran in upon 
him and knocked him down ; and then called out to him in 
the boat to yield, or he was a dead man. There needed very 
few arguments to persuade a single man to yield, when he 
saw five men upon him, and his comrade knocked down : be- 
sides, this wa3, it seems, one of the three men who were not 
so hearty in the mutiny as the rest of the crew ; and, there- 
fore, was easily persuaded not only to yield, but afterwards 
to join very sincerely with us. In the meantime, Friday and 
the captain's mate so well managed their business with the 
rest, that they drew them, by hallooing and answering, from 
one hill to another, and from one wood to another, till they 
not only heartily tired them, but left them where they were 
very sure they could not reach back to the boat before it was 
dark ; and, indeed, they were heartily tired themselves also, 
by the time they came back to us. 

We had nothing now to do but to watch for them in the 
dark, and to fall upon them, so as to make sure, work with 
them. It was several hours after Friday came back to me 
before they came back to their boat ; and we could hear the 
foremost of them, long before they came quite up, calling to 
those behind to come along; and could also hear them 
answer, and complain how lame and tired they were, and not 
able to come any faster : which was very welcome news to us. 
At length they came up to the boat : but it is impossible to 
express their confusion when they found the boat fast aground 
in the creek, the tide ebbed out, and their two men gone. 
We could hear them call to one another in a most lamentable 
manner, telling one another they were got into an enchanted 
island ; that either there were inhabitants in it, and they 
should all be murdered, or else there were devils and spirits 
in it, and they should all be carried away and devoured. 
They hallooed again, and called their two comrades by their 
names a great many times, but no answer. After some time, 
we could see them, by the little light there was, run about, 
wringing their hands like men in despair, and sometimes they 



208 ROBIXSOX CRUSOE. 

would go and sit down in the boat to rest themselves : then 
come ashore again, and walk about, and so the same thing 
over again. My men would fain have had me give them 
leave to fall upon them at once in the dark ; but I was willing 
to take them at some advantage, so as to spare them, and kill 
as few of them as I could ; and especially I was unwilling to 
hazard the killing any of our men, knowing the others were 
very well armed. I resolved to wait, to see if they did not 
separate ; and therefore, to make sure of them, I drew my 
ambuscade nearer, and ordered Friday and the captain to 
creep upon their hands and feet as close to the ground as they 
could, that they might not be discovered, and get as near 
them as they could possibly, before they offered to fire. 

They had not been long in that posture, when the boat- 
swain, who was the principal ringleader of the mutiny, and 
had now shown himself the most dejected and dispirited of all 
the rest, came walking towards them, with two more of the 
crew ; the captain was so eager at having this principal rogue 
so much in his power, that he could hardly have patience to 
let him come so near as to be sure of him, for they only heard 
his tongue before : but when they came nearer, the captain 
and Friday, starting up on their feet, let fly at them. The 
boatswain was killed upon the spot : the next man was shot 
in the body, and fell just by him, though he did not die till 
an hour or two after ; and the third ran for it. At the noise 
of the fire, I immediately advanced with my whole army, 
which was now eight men, viz., myself, generalissimo ; Friday, 
my lieutenant-general ; the captain and his two men, and the 
three prisoners of war whom we had trusted with arms. We 
came upon them, indeed, in the dark, so that they could not 
see our number ; and I made the man they had left in the 
boat, who was now one of us, to call them by name, to try if 
I could bring them to a parley, and so perhaps might reduce 
them to terms ; which fell out just as we desired : for indeed 
it was easy to think, as their condition then was, they would 
be very willing to capitulate. So he calls out as loud as he 
could to one of them, " Tom Smith ! Tom Smith !" Tom 
Smith answered immediately, "Is that Robinson?" for it 
seems he knew the voice. The other answered, " Ay, ay ; for 
God's sake, Tom Smith, throw down your arms and yield 
or you are all dead men this moment." " Who mu3t we 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 



20V 



yield to Where are they ?" says Smith again. "Here they 
are," says he ; " here's our captain and -fifty men with him, 
have been hunting you these two hours; the boatswain is 
killed, Will Fry is wounded, and I am a prisoner ; and if you 
do not yield, you are all lost." " Will they give us quarter 




then ?" says Tom Smith, " and we will yield." " I'll go and 
ask, if you promise to yield," said Rooinson : so lie asked the 
captain, and the captain himself then calls out, " You, Smith, 
you know my voice ; if you lay down your arms imme- 
diately, and submit, you shall have your lives, all but Will 
Atkins." 
14. 



210 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

Upon this, Will Atkins cried out, " For God's sake, captain, 
give me quarter ; what have I done ? They have all been as 
bad as I :" which, by the way, was not true ; for, it seems, 
this Will Atkins was the first man that laid hold of the captain, 
when they first mutinied, and used him barbarously, in tying 
his hands, and giving him injurious language. However, the 
captain told him he must lay down his arms at discretion, and 
trust to the governor's mercy : by which he meant me, for 
they all called me governor. In a word, they all laid down 
their arms, and begged their lives ; and I sent the man that 
had parleyed with them, and two more, who bound them all ; 
and then my great army of fifty men, which, with those three, 
were in all but eight, came up and seized upon them, and 
upon their boat ; only that I kept myself and one more out of 
sight for reasons, of state. 

Our next work was to repair the boat, and think of seizing 
the ship : and as for the captain, now he had leisure to parley 
with them, he expostulated with them upon the villany of 
their practices with him, and upon the further wickedness of 
their design, and how certainly it must bring them to misery 
and distress in the end, and perhaps to the gallows. They 
all appeared very penitent, and begged hard for their lives. 
As for that, he told them they were not his prisoners, but the 
commander's of the island ; that they thought they had set 
him on shore in a barren uninhabited island; but it had 
pleased God so to direct them, that it was inhabited, and that 
the governor was an Englishman ; that he might hang them 
all there, if he pleased ; but as he had given them all quarter, 
he supposed he would send them to England, to be dealt with 
there as justice required, except Atkins, whom he was com- 
manded by the governor to advise to prepare for death, for 
that he would be hanged in the morning. 

Though this was all a fiction of his own, yet it had its de- 
sired effect ; Atkins fell upon his knees, to beg the captain to 
intercede with the governor for his life; and all the rest 
begged of him, for God's sake, that they might not be sent to 
England. 

It now occurred to me, that the time of our deliverance was 
come, ^nd that it would be a most easy thing to bring these 
fellows in to be hearty in getting possession of the ship ; so I 
retired in the dark from them, that they might not see what 



ROEIJfSON CRUSOE. 21 1 

kind of a governor they had, and called the captain to me ; 
when I called, at a good distance, one of the men was ordered 
to speak again, and say to the captain, " Captain, the com- 
mander calls for you;" and presently the captain replied, 
" Tell his Excellency I am just coming." This more perfectly 
amazed them, and they all believed that the commander was 
just by, with his fifty men. Upon the captain coining to me, 
I told, him my project for seizing the ship, which he liked 
wonderfully well, and resolved to put it in execution the next 
morning. But, in order to execute it with more art, and to 
be secure of success, I told him we must divide the prisoners, 
and that he should go and take Atkins, and two more of the 
worst of them, and send them pinioned to the cave where the 
others lay. This was committed to Friday and the two men 
who came on shore with the captain. They conveyed them 
to the cave as to a prison : and it was, indeed, a dismal place, 
especially to men in their condition. The others I ordered 
to my bower ; and as it was fenced in, and they pinioned, the 
place was secure enough, considering they were upon their 
behaviour. 

To these in the morning I sent the captain, who was to 
enter into a parley with them — in a word, to try them, and 
tell me whether he thought they might be trusted or not to 
go on board and surprise the ship. He talked to them of the 
injury done him, of the condition they were brought to, and 
that though the governor had given them quarter for their 
lives as to the present action, yet that if they were sent to 
England, they would all be hanged in chains ; but that if they 
would join in so just an attempt as to recover the ship, he 
would have the governor's engagement for their pardon. 

Anyone may guess how readily such a proposal would be 
accepted by men in their condition : they fell down on their 
knees to the captain, and promised with the deepest impreca- 
tions, that they would be faithful to him to the last drop, and 
that they should owe their lives to him, and would go with 
him all over the world ; that they would own him as a father 
to them as long as they lived. " Well," says the captain, " I 
must go and tell the governor what you say, and see what I 
can do to bring him to consent to it." So he brought me an 
account of the temper he found them in, and that he verily 
believed they would be faithful tt~..^- ,. ;hat we might be 



212 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

very secure, I told liim he should go back again and choose 
out those five, and tell them, that they might see he did not 
want men, that he would take out those five to be his assist- 
ants, and that the governor would keep the other two, and 
the three that were sent prisoners to the castle (my cave), as 
hostages for the fidelity of those five ; and that if they proved 
unfaithful in the execution, the five hostages should be hanged 
in chains alive on the shore. This looked severe, and con- 
vinced them that the governor was in earnest : however, they 
had no way left them but to accept it ; and it was now the 
business of the prisoners, as much as of the captain, to per- 
suade the other five to do their duty. 

Our strength was now thus ordered for the expedition : 
first, the captain, his mate, and passenger : second, then the 
two prisoners of the first gang, to whom, having their cha- 
racter from the captain, I had given their liberty, and trusted 
them with arms : third, the other two that I had kept till now 
in my bower pinioned, but, on the captain's motion, had now 
released: fourth, these five released at last; so that they 
were twelve in all, besides five we kept prisoners in the cave 
for hostages. 

I asked the captain if he was willing to venture with these 
hands on board the ship ; but as for me and my man Friday, 
I did not think it was proper for us to stir, having seven men 
left behind ; and it was employment enough for us to keep 
them asunder, and supply them with victuals. As to the five 
in the cave, I resolved to keep them fast, but Friday went in 
twice a day to them, to supply them with necessaries ; and I 
made the other two carry provisions to a certain distance, 
where Friday was to take it. 

When I showed myself to the two hostages, it was with the 
captain, who told them I was the person the governor had 
ordered to look after them ; and that it was the governor's 
pleasure they should not stir anywhere but by my direction ; 
that if they did, they would be fetched into the castle, and be 
laid in irons : so that as we never suffered them to see me as 
governor, I now appeared as another person, and spoke of 
the governor, the garrison, the castle, and the like, upon all 
occasions. 

The captain now had no difficulty before him, but to furnish 
Ms two boats, stop the breach of one, and man them. lie 



KOBINSON CRUSOE. 213 

made his passenger captain of one, with four of the men ; and 
himself, his mate, and five more, went in the other ; and they 
contrived their business very well, for they came up to the 
ship about midnight. As soon as they came within call oi 
the ship, he made Robinson hail them, and tell them they 
had brought off the men and the boat, but that it was a long 
time before they had found them, and the like ; holding them 
in a chat till they came to the ship's side ; when the captain 
and the mate entering first, with their arms, immediately 
knocked down the second mate and carpenter with the butt- 
end of their muskets, being very faithfully seconded by their 
men ; they secured all the rest that were upon the main and 
quarter-decks, and began to fasten the hatches, to keep them 
down that were below ; when the other boat and their men, 
entering at the fore-chains, secured the forecastle of the ship, 
and the scuttle which went down into the cook-room, making 
three men they found there prisoners. When this was done, 
and all safe upon deck, the captain or-dered the mate, with 
three men, to break into the round-house, where the new 
rebel captain lay, who, having taken the alarm, had got up, 
and with two men and a boy had got fire-arms in their hands; 
and when the mate, with a crow, split open the door, the new 
captain and his men fired boldly among them, and wounded 
the mate with a musket-ball, which broke his arm, and 
wotmded two more of the men, but killed nobody. The mate 
calling for help, rushed, however, into the round-house, 
wounded as he was, and, Avith his pistol, shot the new captain 
through the head, the bullet entering at his mouth, and came 
out again behind one of his ears, so that he never spoke a 
word more : upon which the rest yielded, and the ship was 
taken effectually, without any more lives lost. 

As soon as the ship was thus secured, the captain ordered 
seven guns to be fired, which was the signal agreed upon 
with me to give me notice of his success, which, you may be 
sure, I was very glad to hear, having sat watching upon the 
shore for it till near two o'clock in the morning. Having 
thus heard the signal plainly, I laid me down ; and it havinr 
been a day of great fatigue to me, I slept very sound, 1i!l 1 
was surprised with the noise of a gun ; and presently starting 
up, I heard a man call me by the name of " Governor ! 
Governor !" and presently I knew the captain's voice ; when 



214 ItOBINSON C1LU50E. 

climbing up to the top of the hill, there he stood, and, point- 
ing to the ship, he embiaced me in his arms. " My dear 
friend and deliverer," says he, " there's your ship, for she is 
all yours, and so are we, and all that belong to her." I cast 
my eyes to the ship, and there she rode, -within little more 
than half a mile of the shore ; for they had weighed her 
anchor as soon as they were masters of her, and, the weather 
being fair, had brought her to an anchor just against the 
mouth of the little creek ; and, the tide being up, the captain 
had brought the pinnace in near the place where I at first 
landed my rafts, and so landed just at my door. I was at 
first ready to sink down with the surprise; for I saw my 
deliverance, indeed, visibly put into my hands, all things 
easy, and a large ship just ready to carry me away whither I 
pleased to go. At first, for some time, I was not able to 
answer him one word ; but as he had taken me in his arms, 
I held fast by him, or I should have fallen to the ground. 
He perceived the surprise, and immediately pulled a bottle 
out of his pocket, and gave me a dram of cordial, which he 
-had brought on purpose for me. After I had drank it, I sat 
down upon the ground ; and though it brought me to myself, 
yet it was a good while before I could speak a word to him. 
All this time the poor man was in as great an ecstasy as I, 
only not under any surprise as I was ; and he said a thousand 
kind, and tender things to me, to compose and bring me to 
myself: but such was the flood of joy in my breast, that it 
put all my spirits into confusion : at last it broke out into 
tears ; and, in a little while after, I recovered my speech. I 
then took my turn, and embraced him as my deliverer, and 
•we rejoiced together. I told him I looked upon him as a 
man sent from Heaven to deliver me, and that the whole 
transaction seemed to be a chain of wonders. 

When we had talked a while, the captain told me he had 
brought me some little refreshment, such as the ship afforded, 
and such as the wretches that had been so long his masters 
had not plundered him of. Upon this, he called aloud to the 
boat, and bade his men bring the things ashore that were for 
the governor ; and, indeed, it was a present as if I had been 
one that was not to be carried away with them, but as if I 
had been to dwell upon the island still. First, he had brought 
me a case of bottles full of excellent cordial waters, sis large 



ROBINSON CliUSOE. 215 

bottles of Madeira wine, two pounds of excellent good tobacco, 
twelve good pieces of the ship's beef, and six pieces of pork, 
with a bag of pease, and about a hundredweight of biscuit ; 
he also brought me a box of sugar, a box of flour, a bag full 
of lemons, and two bottles of lime-juice, and abundance of 
other things. But besides these, and what was a thousand 
times more useful to me, he brought me six new clean shirts, 
six very good neckcloths, two pair of gloves, one pair of shoes, 
a hat, and one pair of stockings, with a very good suit of 
clothes of his own : in a word, he clothed me from head to 
foot. It was a very kind and agreeable present, as anyone 
may imagine, to one in my circumstances ; but never was 
anything in the world of that kind so unpleasant, awkward, 
and uneasy as it was to me to wear such clothes at first. 

After these ceremonies were passed, nnd after all his good 
things were brought into my little apartment, we began to 
consult what was to be done with the prisoners we had. I 
told him that, if he desired it, I woidd undertake to bring 
the worst men he spoke of to make it their own request that 
he should leave them upon the island. " I should be very 
glad of that," says the captain, " with all my heart." So I 
caused Friday and the two hostages, for they were now dis- 
charged, to go to the cave, and bring up the five men, pinioned 
as they were, to the bower, and keep them there till I came. 
After some time, I came thither dressed in my new habit ; 
and now I was called governor again. Being all met, and the 
captain with me, I caused the men to be brought before me, 
and I told them I had got a full account of their villanous 
behaviour to the captain, but that Providence had ensnared 
them in their own ways, and that they had fallen into the pit 
which they had dug for others. I let them know that by my 
direction the ship had been seized; that she lay now in the 
road ; and they might see, by-and-by, that their new captain 
had received the reward of his villany, and that they would 
see him hanging at the yard-arm ; that,' as to them, I wanted 
to know what they had to say why I should not execute them 
as pirates, taken in the fact, as by my commission they could 
not doubt but I had authority so to do. 

One of them answered in the name of the rest, that they 
had nothing to say but this, that when they were taken, the 
captain promised them their lives, and they humbly implored 



216 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

my mercy. But I told them I knew not what mercy to show 
them ; for as for myself, I had resolved to qviit the island 
with all my men, and had taken passage with the captain to 
go for England ; and, as for the captain, he could not carry 
them to England, other than as prisoners, in irons, to be 
tried for mutiny, and running away with the ship ; the con- 
sequence of which, they must needs know, would be the 
gallows ; so that I could not tell what was best for them, 
unless they had a mind to take their fate in the island. If 
they desired that, as I had liberty to leave the island, I had 
some inebriation to give them their lives if they thought 
they could shift on shore. They seemed very thankful for 
it, and said they would much rather venture to stay there 
than be carried to England to be hanged. So I left it on that 
issue. 

However, the captain seemed to make some difficulty of it, 
as if he durst not leave them there. Upon this, I seemed a 
little angry with the captain, and told him that they were my 
prisoners, not his ; and. that seeing I had offered them so 
much favour, I would be as good as my word ; and that if he 
did not think fit to consent to it, I would set them at liberty 
as I found them ; and if he did not like it, he might take them 
again if he could catch them. Upon this, they appeared 
very thankful, and I accordingly set them at liberty, and 
bade them retire into the woods, to the place whence they 
came, and I would leave them some fire-arms, some ammu- 
nition, and some directions how they should live very well if 
they thought fit. Upon this I prepared to go on board the 
ship ; but told the captain I would stay that night to prepare 
my things, and desired him to go on board in the meantime, 
and keep all right in the ship, and send the boat on shore 
next day for me ; ordering him, at all events, to cause the 
new captain, who was killed, to be hanged at the yard-arm, 
that these men might see him. 

When the captain was gone, I sent for the men up to me 
to my apartment, and entered seriously into discourse with 
them on their circumstances. I told them I thought they 
had made a right choice ; that if the captain had carried them 
away, they would certainly be hanged. I showed them the 
new captain hanging at the yard-arm of the ship, and told 
them they had nothing less to expect. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 



217 



When they had all declared their -willingness to stay, I 
then told them I would let them into the story of my living 
there, and put them into the way of making it easy to them. 
Accordingly, I gave them the whole history of the place, 




and of my coming to it ; showed them my fortifications, the 
way I made my bread, planted my corn, cured my grapes ; 
and, in a word, all that was necessary to make them easy. I 
told them the story also of the seventeen Spaniards that were 
to be expected, for whom I left a letter, and made them pro- 
mise to treat them in common with themselves. 



218 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

I left them my fire-arms — viz., five muskets, three fowling- 
pieces, and three swords. I had above a barrel and a half 
of powder left. I gave them a description of the way I 
managed the goats, and directions to milk and fatten them, 
and to make both butter and cheese. In a word, I gave 
them every part of my own story ; and told them I should 
prevail with the captain to leave them two barrels of gun- 
powder more, and some garden seeds, which I told them I 
would have been very glad of. Also, I gave them the bag of 
pease which the captain had brought me to eat, and bade 
them be sure to sow and increase them. 

Having done all this, I left them the next day, and went 
on board the ship. We prepared immediately to sail, but 
did not weigh that night. The next morning early, two of 
the five men came swimming to the ship's side, and, making 
the most lamentable complaint of the other three, begged to 
be taken into the ship for God's sake, for they should be mur- 
dered, and begged the captain to take them on board, though 
he hanged them immediately. Upon this, the captain pre- 
tended to have no power without me ; but, after some diffi- 
culty, and after their solemn promises of amendment, they 
were taken on board, and were, some time after, soundly 
whipped and pickled ; after which they proved very honest 
and quiet fellows. 

Some time after this, the boat was ordered on shore, the 
tide being up, with the things promised to the men ; to which 
the captain, at my intercession, caused their chests and 
clothes to be added, which they took, and were very thank- 
ful for. I also encouraged them, by telling them, that if it 
lay in my power to send any vessel to take them in, I would 
not forget them. 

When I took leave of this island, I carried on board, for 
relics, the great goat-skin cap I had made, my umbrella, und 
one of my parrots ; also I forgot not to take the money I for- 
merly mentioned, as also the money I found in the wreck of 
the Spanish ship. And thus I left the island, the 19 th of 
December, as I found by the ship's account, in the year 1686, 
after I had been upon it eight-and-twenty years, two months, 
and nineteen days ; being delivered from this second captivity 
the same day of the month that I first made my escape ni the 
loDg-boat, from among the Moors of Sallee. ' In this vessel, 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 219 

after a long voyage, I arrived in England the 11th of June, 
in the year 1687, having been thirty- five years absent. 

When I came to England I was as perfect a stranger to all 
the -world as if I had never been known there. My bene- 
factor and faithful steward, whom I had left my money in 
trust with, was alive, but had had great misfortunes in the 
world ; was become a widow the second time, and very low 
in the world. I made her very easy as to what she owed me, 
assuring her I would give her no trouble ; but, on the con- 
trary, in gratitude for her former care and faithfulness to me, 
I relieved her as my little stock would afford; which at that 
time would, indeed, allow me to do but little : but I assured 
her I would never forget her former kindness to me ; nor did 
I forget her when I had sufficient, as shall be observed in its 
proper place. I went down afterwards into Yorkshire ; but 
my father was dead, and my mother and all the family ex- 
tinct, except that I found two sisters, and two of the children 
of one of my brothers ; and as I had been long ago given 
over for dead, there had been no provision made for me ; so 
that I found nothing to relieve or assist me ; and that the 
little money I had would not do much for me as to settling 
in the world. 

I met with one piece of gratitude, which I did not expect ; 
and this was, that the master of the ship, whom I had so 
happily delivered, and by the same means saved the ship and 
cargo, having given a very handsome account to the owners 
of the manner how I had saved the lives of the men and the 
ship, they invited me to meet them and some other merchants 
concerned, and all together made me a very handsome com- 
pliment upon the subject, and a present of almost £200 
sterling. 

But after making several reflections upon the circumstances 
of my life, and how little way this would go towards settling 
me in the world, I resolved to go to Lisbon, and see if I might 
not come at some information of the state of my plantation in. 
the Brazils, and of what was become of my partner, who, I 
had reason to suppose, had some years past given me over for 
dead. With this view, I took shipping for Lisbon, where I 
arrived in April following ; my man Friday accompanying 
me very honestly in all these ramblings, and proving a most 
faithful servant. When I came to Lisbon, I found out, by 



220 ROBIXSON CRUSOE. 

inquiry, and to my particular satisfaction, my old friend, the 
captain of the ship, who first took me up at sea off the shore 
of Africa. He was now grown old, and had left off going to 
sea, having put his son, who was far from a young man, into 
his ship, and who still used the Brazil trade. The old man 
did not know me; and indeed, I hardly knew him. But I 
soon brought him to my remembrance, and as soon brought 
myself to his remembrance, when I told him who I was. 

After some passionate expressions of the old acquaintance 
between us, I inquired, you may be sure, after my plantation 
and my partner. The old man told me he had not been in 
the Brazils for about nine years ; but that he could assure me, 
that when he came away my partner was living ; but the 
trustees, whom I had joined with him to take cognizance of 
my part, were both dead : that, however, he believed I would 
have a very good account of the improvement of the planta- 
tion ; for that, upon the general belief of my being cast away 
and drowned, my trustees had given in the account of the 
produce of my part of the plantation to the procurator-fiscal, 
who had appropriated it, in case I never came to claim it, 
one-third to the king, and two-thirds to the monastery of 
St. Augustine, to be expended for the benefit of the poor, 
and for the conversion of the Indians to the Catholic faith : 
but that, if I appeared, or any one for me, to claim the in- 
heritance, it would be restored ; only that the improvement, 
or annual production, being distributed to charitable uses, 
could not be restored : but he assured me that the steward 
of the king's revenue from lands, and the providore, or steward 
of the monastery, had taken great care all along that my 
partner gave every year a faithful account of the produce, of 
whieh they had duly received my moiety. I asked him if he 
knew to what height of improvement he had brought the 
plantation, and whether he thought it might be worth looking 
after ; or whether, on my going thither, I should meet with 
any obstruction to my possessing my just right in the moiety. 
He told me he could not tell exactly to what degree the 
plantation was improved ; but this he knew, that my partner 
was grown exceeding rich upon the enjoying his part of it ; 
and that, to the best of his remembrance, he had heard that 
the king's third of my part, which was, it seems, granted away 
to some other monastery or religious house, amounted to 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 221 

above two hundred moidores a year : that as to my being 
restored to a quiet possession of it, there was no question to 
be made of that, my partner being alive to witness my title, 
and my name being also enrolled in the register of the 
country; also he told me that the survivors of my two 
trustees were very fair, honest people, and very wealthy; 
and he believed I would not only have their assistance for 
putting me in possession, but would find a very considerable 
sum of money in their hands for my account, being the pro- 
duce of the farm while their fathers held the trust, and before 
it was given up, as above ; which, as he remembered, was for 
about twelve years. 

I showed myself a little concerned and uneasy at this 
account, and inquired of the old captain how it came to pass 
that the trustees should thus dispose of my effects, when he 
knew that I had made my will, and had made him, the 
Portuguese captain, my universal heir, &c. 

He told me that was true ; but that as there was no proof 
of my being dead, he could not act as executor, until some 
certain account should come of my death ; and, besides, he 
was not willing to intermeddle with a thing so remote : that 
it was true he had registered my will, and put in his claim; 
and could he have given any account of my being dead or 
alive, he would have acted by procuration, and taken posses- 
sion of the ingenio (so they call the sugar-house), and have 
given his son, who was now at the Brazils, orders to do it. 
" But," says the old man, " I have one piece of news to tell 
you, which perhaps may not be so acceptable to you as the 
rest ; and that is, believing you were lost, and all the world 
believing so also, your partner and trustees did offer to 
account with me, in your name, for the first six or eight 
years' profits, which I received. There being at that time 
great disbursements for increasing the works, building an 
ingenio. and buying slaves, it did not amount to near so much 
as afterwards it produced : however," says the old man, " I 
shall give you a true account of what I have received in all, 
and how I have disposed of it." 

After a few days' farther conference with this ancient friend, 
he brought me an account of the first six years' income of 
my plantation, signed by my partner and the merchant- 
trustees, being always delivered in goods ; and I found by 



222 E0BIX30X CRUSOE. 

this account, that every year the income considerably in- 
creased; hut the disbursements being large, the sum at first 
was small : however, the old man let me see that he was 
debtor to me four hundred and seventy moidores of gold, 
besides sixty chests of sugar, and fifteen double rolls of to- 
bacco, which were lost in his ship : he having been ship- 
wrecked coming home to Lisbon, about eleven years after my 
leaving the place. The good man then began to complain of 
his misfortunes, and how he had been obliged to make use of 
my money to recover his losses, and buy him a share in a new 
ship. "However, my old friend," says he, "you shall not 
want a supply in your necessity; and as soon as my son 
returns, you shall be fully satisfied." Upon this he pulls out 
an old pouch, and gives me one hundred and sixty Portugal 
moidores in gold ; and giving the writings of his title to the 
ship, which his son was gone to the Brazils in, of which he 
was quarter-part owner, and his son another, he puts them 
both into my hands for security of the rest. 

I was too much moved with the honesty and kindness of 
the poor man to be able to bear this ; and remembering what 
he had done for me, how he had taken me up at sea, and how 
generously he had used me on all occasions, and particularly 
how sincere a friend he was now to me, I could hardly refrain 
weeping at what he had said to me ; therefore I asked him if 
his circumstances admitted him to spare so much money at 
that time, and if it would not straiten him ? He told me he 
could not say but it might straiten him a little ; but, however, 
it was my money, and I might want it more than he. 

Everything the good man said was full of affection, and I 
could hardly refrain from tears while he spoke ; in short, I 
took one hundred of the moidores, and called for a pen and 
ink to give him a receipt for them ; then I returned him the 
rest, and told him if ever I had possession of the plantation 
I would return the other to him also (as, indeed, I afterwards 
did) ; and that as to the bill of sale of his part in his son's 
ship, I would not take it by any means ; but that if I wanted 
the money, I found he was honest enough to pay me ; and if 
I did not, but came to receive what he gave me reason to 
expect, I would never have a penny more from him. 

When this was passed, the old man asked me if he should 
put me into a method to make my claim to mv r>lant; tion. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 223 

I told him I thought to go over to it myself. He said I might 
do so if I pleased ; but that, if I did not, there were ways 
enough to secure my right, and immediately to appropriate 
the profits to my use ; and as there were ships in the river of 
Lisbon just ready to go away to Brazil, he made me enter my 
name in a public register, with his affidavit, affirming, upon 
oath, that I was alive, and that I was the same person who 
took up the land for the planting the said plantation at first. 
This being regularly attested by a notary, and a procuration 
affixed, he directed me to send it, with a letter of his writing, 
to a merchant of his acquaintance at the place ; and then 
proposed my staying with him till an account came of the 
return. 

Never was anything more honourable than the proceedings 
upon this procuration ; for in less than seven months I re- 
ceived a large packet from the survitors of my trustees, the 
merchants, for whose account I went to sea, in which were 
the following particular letters and papers enclosed. 

First, there was the account-current of the produce of my 
plantation, from the year when their fathers had balanced 
with my old Portugal captain, being for six years ; the 
balance appeared to be one thousand one hundred and 
seventy-four moidores in my favour. 

Secondly, there was the account of four years more, while 
they kept the effects in their hands, before the government 
claimed the administration, as being the effects of a person 
not to be found, which they called civil death ; and the 
balance of this, the value of the plantation increasing, 
amounted to about three thousand two hundred and forty 
moidores. 

Thirdly, there was the Prior of St. Augustine's account, 
who had received the profits for above fourteen years ; but 
not being to account for what was disposed of by the hospital, 
very honestly declared he had eight hundred and seventy- 
two moidores not distributed, which he acknowledged to my 
account : as to the king's part, that refunded nothing. 

There was a letter of my partner's, congratulating me very 
affectionately upon my being alive, giving me an account how 
the estate was improved, and what it produced a year; with 
the particulars of the number of acres that it contained, how 
planted, how many slaves there were upon it ; and making 



224 KOBINSON CRUSOE. 

two-and-twenty crosses for blessings, told me he had said so 
many Ave Marias to thank the Blessed Virgin that I was 
alive ; inviting me very passionately to come over and take 
possession of my own; and, in the meantime, to give him 
orders to whom he should deliver my effects, if I did not 
come myself; concluding with a hearty tender of his friend- 
ship, and that of his family ; and sent me, as a presi/nt, seven 
fine leopards' skins, which he had, it seems, received from 
Africa, by some other ship that he had sent thither, and 
which, it seems, had made a better voyage than I. He sent 
me also five chests of excellent sweetmeats, ana a hundred 
pieces of gold uncoined, not quite so large as moidores. By 
the same fleet, my two merchant-trustees shipped me one 
thousand two hundred chests of sugar, eight hundred rolls ot 
tobacco, and the rest of the whole account in gold. 

I might well say now, indeed, that the latter end of Job 
was better than the beginning. It is impossible to express 
the flutterings of my very heart when I found all my wealth 
about me ; for as the Brazil ships come all in fleets, the same 
ships which brought my letters brought my goods : and the 
effects were safe in the river before my letters came to my 
hand. 

I was now master, all on a sudden, of above five thousand 
pounds sterling in money, and had an estate, as I might well 
call it, in the Brazils, of above a thousand pounds a year, as 
sure as an estate in England : and, in a word, I was in a con- 
dition which I scarce knew how to understand, or how to 
compose myself for the enjoyment of it. The first thing I 
did was to recompense my origina benefactor, my good old 
captain, who had been first charitable to me in my distress, 
kind to me in ray beginning, and honest to me at the end. 
I showed him all that was sent to me ; I told him that, next 
to the providence of Heaven, which disposed all things, it was 
owing to him ; and that it now lay on me to reward him, 
which I would do a hundredfold : so I first returned to him 
the hundred moidores I had received of him ; then I sent for 
a notary, and caused him to draw up a general release from 
the four hundred and seventy moidores, which he had ac- 
knowledged he owed me, in the fullest and firmest manner 
possible. After which, I caused a procuration to be drawn, 
empowering him t-j be the receiver of the annual profits of 



EOBINSON CRUSOE. 



225 



my plantation; and appointing my partner to account with 
him, and make the returns, by the usual fleets, to him in my 
name ; and by a clause in the end, made a grant of one hun- 
dred moidores a year to him during his life, out of the effects, 




and fifty moidores a year to his son after him, for his life : 
and thus I requited my old man. 

I had now to consider which way to steer my course next, 
and what to do with the estate that Providence had thus put 
into my hands : and indeed, I had more care upon my head 
now than I had in ray. silent state of life in the island, whers 



226 ItOBINSON CKUSOE. 

I wanted nothing but what I had, and had nothing but what 
I wanted ; whereas I had now a great charge upon me, and 
my business was how to secure it. I had not a cave now to 
hide my money in, or a place where it might lie without lock 
or key, till it grew mouldy and tarnished before anybody 
would meddle with it ; on the contrary, I knew not where to 
put it, or whom to trust with it. My old patron, the captain, 
indeed, was honest, and that was the only refuge I had. In 
the next place, my interest in the Brazils seemed to summon 
me thither ; but now I could not tell how to think of going 
thither till I had settled my affairs, and left my effects in 
some safe hands behind me. At first I thought of my old 
friend the widow, Avho I knew was honest, and would be just 
to me ; but then she was in years, and but poor, and, for 
aught I knew, might be in debt ; so that, in a word, I had no 
way but to go back to England myself, and take my effects 
with me. 

It was some months, however, before I resolved upon this; 
and, therefore, as I had rewarded the old captain fully, and 
to his satisfaction, who had been my former benefactor, so I 
began to think of the poor widow, whose husband had been 
my first benefactor, and she, while it was in her power, my 
faithful steward and instructor. So, the first thing I did, I 
got a merchant in Lisbon to write to his correspondent in 
London, not only to pay a bill, but to go find her out, and carry 
her, in money, a hundred pounds from me, and to talk with 
her, and conribrt her in her poverty, by telling her she should, 
if I lived, have a farther supply : at the same time, I sent 
my two. sisters in the country a hundred pounds each, they 
being, though not in want, yet not in very good circumstances ; 
one hawing been married and left a widow ; and the other 
having a husband not so kind to her as he should be. But, 
among all my relations or acquaintances, I could not yet 
pitch upon one to whom I durst commit the gross of my 
stock, that I might go away to the Brazils, and leave things 
safe behind me ; and this greatly perplexed me. 

I had once a mind to have gone to the Brazils, and have 
settled myself there, for I was, as it were, naturalised to the 
place ; but I had some little scruple in my mind about reli- 
gion, . which insensibly drew me back. However, it was 
not religion that kept me from going there for the present; 



EOBIXSOX CRUSOE. 227 

but that really I did not know with whom to leave my effects 
behind me ; so I resolved at last to go to England, where, it 
I arrived, I concluded I should make some acquaintance, or 
find some relations, that would be faithful to me ; and, 
accordingly, I prepared to go to England with all my wealth. 

In order to prepare things for my going home, I first re- 
solved to give answers suitable to the just and faithful account 
of things I had from thence ; and, first, to the Prior of St. 
Augustine, I wrote a letter full of thanks for his just dealings, 
and the offer of the eight hundred and seventy-two moidores 
which were undisposed of, which. I desired might be given, 
five hundred to the monastery, and three hundred and 
seventy-two to the poor, as the prior should direct; desiring 
the good padre's prayers for me, and the like. I wrote next 
a letter of thanks to my two trustees, with all the acknow- 
ledgment that so much justice and honesty called for: as for 
sending them any present, they were far above having any 
occasion for it. Lastly, I wrote to my partner, acknowledg- 
ing his industry in improving the plantation, and his integrity 
in increasing the stock of the works ; giving him instructions 
for his future government of my part, according to the powers 
I had left with my old patron, to whom I desired him to send 
whatever became due to me, till he should hear from me 
more particularly ; assuring him that it was my intention not 
only to come to him, but to settle myself there for the re- 
mainder of my life. To this I added a very handsome pre- 
sent of some Italian silks for his wife and two daughters, for 
such the captain's son informed me he had ; with two pieces 
<>f fine English broad cloth, the best I could get in Lisbon, 
five pieces of black baize, and some Flanders lace of a good 
value. 

Having thus settled my affairs, sold my cargo, and 
turned all my effects into good bills of exchange, my next 
difficult}- was which way to go to England : I had been 
accustomed enough to the sea, and yet I had a strange 
aversion to go to England by sea at that time ; and though 
I could give no reason for it, yet the difficulty increased 
upon me so much, that though I had once shipped mv 
baggage in order to go, yet I altered my mind two or three 
times. 

It is true, I had been very unfortunate by sea, and this 



228 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

might be one of the reasons ; but let no man slight the 
strong impulses of his own thoughts in cases of such mo- 
ment : two of the ships which I had singled out to go in, 
having put my things on board one of them, and in the other 
to have agreed with the captain, miscarried, one was taken by 
the Algerines, and the other was cast away on the Start, near 
Torbay, and all the people drowned, except three ; so that 
in either of those vessels I had been made miserable. 

Having been thus harassed in my thoughts, my old pilot, 
to whom I communicated everything, pressed me earnestly 
not to go by sea, but either to go by land to the Groyne, and 
cross over the Bay of Biscay to Kochelle, from whence it 
was but an easy and safe journey by land to Paris, and so 
to Calais and Dover; or to go up to Madrid, and so all the 
■way by land through France. In a word, I was so prepos- 
sessed against my going by sea at all, except from Calais to 
Dover, that I resolved to travel all the way by land ; which, 
as I was not in haste, and did not value the charge, was by 
much the pleasanter way : and to make it more so, my old 
captain brought an English gentleman, the son of a mer- 
chant in Lisbon, who was willing to travel with me ; after 
which we picked up tw r o more English merchants also, and 
two young Portuguese gentlemen, the last going to Paris 
only ; so that, in all, there were six of us, and five servants ; 
and as for me, I got an English sailor to travel with me as 
a servant, besides my man Friday, who was too much a 
stranger to be capable of supplying the place of a servant on 
the road. 

In this manner I set out from Lisbon ; and our company 
being very well mounted and armed, we made a little troop, 
whereof they did me the honour to call me captain, as well 
because I was the oldest man, as because I had two ser- 
vants, and, indee.d, was the origin of the whole journey. 

As I have troubled you with none of my sea journals, so 
I shall trouble you now with none of my land journal ; but 
some adventures that happened to us in this tedious and 
difficult journey I must not omit. 

When we came to Madrid, we, being all of us strangers to 
Spain, were willing to stay some time to see the court of 
Spain, and what was worth observing; but, it being the 

latter part of the summer, we luistpnorl n-w-m. anc l se (; 0U (

from Madrid about the middle of October ; but when we 
came to the edge of Navarre, we were alarmed, at several 
towns on the way, with an account that so much snow was 
fallen on the French side of the mountains, that several 
travellers were obliged to come back to Pampeluna, after 
having attempted at an extreme hazard to pass on. 

When we came to Pampeluna itself, Ave found it so indeed ; 
and to me, that had always been used to a hot climate, and to 
countries where I could scarce bear any clothes on, the cold 
was insufferable : nor. indeed, was it more painful than sur- 
prising, to come but ten days before out of Old Castile, where 
the weather was not only warm, but very hot, and imme- 
diately to feel a wind from the Pyrenean mountains so very 
keen, so severely cold, as to be intolerable, and to en- 
danger benumbing and perishing of our fingers and toes. 

Poor Friday was really frightened when he saw the moun- 
tains all covered with snow, and felt cold weather, which 
he had never seen or felt before in his life. To mend the 
matter, when we came to Pampeluna, it continued snowing 
with so much violence and so long, that the people said winter 
was come before its time ; and the roads, which were difficult 
before, were now quite impassable ; for the snow lay in some 
places too thick for us to travel, and being not hard frozen, 
as is the case in the northern countries, there was no goino- 
without being in danger of being buried alive every step. 
We stayed no less than twenty days at Pampeluna ; when 
(seeing the winter coming on, and no likelihood of its being 
better, for it was the severest winter all over Europe that had 
been known in the memory of man), I proposed that we 
should go away to Fontarabia, and there take shipping for 
Bordeaux, which was a very little voyage. But, while I was 
considering this, there came in four French gentlemen, who, 
having been stopped on the French side of the passes, as we 
were on the Spanish, had found out a guide, who, traversing 
the country near the head of Languedoc, bad brought them 
over the mountains by such ways that they were not much 
incommoded with the snow ; for where they met with snow 
in any quantity, they said it was frozen hard enough to bear 
them and their horses. We sent for this guide, who told us 
he would undertake to carry us the same way, with no hazard 
from the snow, provided we w«rp o.rrved sufficiently to pro- 



230 ItOBINSON CKUSOE. 

tect ourselves from wild beasts : for, lie said, in these great 
snows, it was frequent for some wolves to show themselves at 
the foot of the mountains, being made ravenous for want of 
food, the ground being covered with snow. "We told him we 
were well enough prepared for such creatures as they were, if 
he would ensure us from a kind of two-legged wolves, which, 
we are told, we were in most danger from, especially on the 
French side of the mountains. He satisfied us that there 
was no danger of that kind in the way that we were to go ; 
so we readily agreed to follow him, as did also twelve other 
gentlemen, with their servants, some French, some Spanish, 
who, as I said, had attempted to go, and were obliged to come 
back again. 

Accordingly, we set out from Pampeluna with our guide, 
on the loth of November ; and I was surprised, when, in- 
stead of going forward, he came directly back with us on the 
same road that we came from Madrid, about twenty miles ; 
when, having passed two rivers, and come into the plain 
country, we found ourselves in a warm climate again, where 
the country was pleasant, and no snow to be seen ; but, on a 
sudden, turning to his left, he approached the mountains an- 
other way ; and though it is true the hills and precipices 
looked dreadful, yet he made so many tours, such meanders, 
and led us by such winding ways, that we insensibly passed 
the height of the mountains without being much encumbered 
with the snow ; and, all on a sudden, he showed us the 
pleasant and fruitful provinces of Languedoc and Gascony. 
all green and flourishing, though, indeed, at a great distance, 
and we had some rough way to pass still. 

We were a little uneasy, however, when we found it snowed 
one whole day and a night so fast that we could not travel ; 
but he bid us be easy ; we should soon be past it all ; we 
found, indeed, that we began to descend every day, and to 
come more north than before ; and so, depending upon our 
guide, we went on. 

It was about two hours before night, when, our guide being 
something before us, and not just in sight, out rushed three 
monstrous wolves, and after them a bear, from a hollow way 
adjoining to a thick wood : two of the wolves made at the 
guide, and, had he been far before us, he would have been 
devoured- haftvro wp r-nnld lia-c-o l-ielnorl liim • one f them 



KOmXSON CRUSOE. 231 

fastened upon his horse, and the other attacked the man with 
such violence, that he had not time or presence of mind 
enough to draw his pistol, but hallooed and cried out to us 
most lustily. My man Friday being next to me, I bade him 
ride up, and see what was the matter. As soon as Friday 
came in sight of the man, he hallooed out as loud as the 
oilier, '' master ! O master '." but, like a bold fellow, rode 
directly up to the poor man, and with his pistol shot the 
■Wolf that attacked him in the head. 

It was happy for the poor man that it was my man Friday ; 
for, having been used to such creatures in his country, he had 
no fear upon him, but went close up to him and shot him ; 
whereas any other of lis would have fired at a farther dis- 
tance, and have perhaps either missed the wolf, or endangered 
shooting the man. 

But it was enough to have terrified a bolder man than I ; 
and, indeed, it alarmed all our company, when, with the noise, 
of Friday's pistol, we heard on both sides the most dismal 
howling of wolves ; and the noise, redoubled by the echo of 
the mountains, appeared to us as if there had been a pro- 
digious number of them ; and perhaps there was not such a 
few as that we had no cause of apprehension : however, as 
Friday had killed this wolf* the other that had fastened upon 
the horse left him immediately, and fled, without doing him 
any damage, having happily fastened upon his head, where 
the bosses of the bridle had stuck in his teeth. But the man 
was most hurt : for the raging creature had bit him twice, 
once in the arm, and the other time a little above his knee ; 
and though he had made some defence, he was just tumbling 
down by the disorder of his horse, when Friday came up and 
shot the wolf. 

It is easy to suppose that at the noise of Friday's pistol we 
all mended our pace, and rode up as fast as the way, which 
was very difficult, would give us leave, to see what was the 
matter. As soon as we came clear of the trees, which 
blinded us before, we saw clearly what had been the case, and 
7 ;ow Friday had disengaged the poor guide, though we did 
not presently discern what kind of creature it was he had 
killed. 

But never was a fight managed so hardily, and in such - 
surprising manner, as that which follower! between Friday 



232 ROBIXSON CRUSOE. 

and the bear, which gave us all, though at first we were sur- 
prised and afraid for him, the greatest diversion imaginable. 
As the bear is a heavy, clumsy creature, and does not gallop 
as the wolf does, who is swift and light, so he has two par- 
ticular qualities, which generally are the ride of his actions : 
first, as to men, who are not his proper prey, if you do not 
meddle with him, he will not meddle with you ; but then you 
must take care to be very civil to him, and give him the road, 
for he is a very nice gentleman ; he will not go a step out of 
his way for a prince ; nay, if you are really afraid, your best 
way is to look another way and keep going on ; for some- 
times if you stop, and stand still, and look steadfastly at him, 
he takes it for an affront ; but if you throw or toss anything 
at him, and it hits him, though it were but a bit of stick as 
big as your finger, he thinks himself abused, and sets all 
other business aside to pursue his revenge, and will have 
satisfaction in point of honour ; — this is his first quality : the 
next is, if he be once affronted, he will never leave you, night 
or day, till he has his revenge, but follows at a good round 
rate until he overtakes you. 

My man Friday had delivered our guide, and when we 
came up to him, he was helping him off his horse, for the 
man was both hurt and frightened, when on a sudden we 
espied the bear come out of the wood, and a monstrous one 
it was, the biggest by far that I ever saw. We were all a 
little surprised when we saw him ; but when Friday saw him, 
it was easy to see joy and courage in the fellow's countenance : 
" 0, O, !" says Friday, three times, pointing to him : '' O 
master ! you give me te leave, me shakee te hand with him ; 
jne makee you good laugh." 

I was surprised to see the fellow so well pleased : ' : You 
fool," says I, " he will eat you up." " Eatee me up ! eatee 
me up !" says Friday, twice over again ; " me eatee him up ; 
me make you good laugh ; you all stay here, me show you 
good laugh." So down he sits, and gets off his boots in a 
moment and puts on a pair of pumps, gives my other ser- 
vant his horse, and with his gun away he flew, swift like the 
wind. 

The bear was walking softly on, and offered to meddle with 
nobody, till Friday coming pretty near, calls to him, as if the 
bear could understand him, " Hark ye, hark ye," says Friday,

were entered a vast forest, where tlio country was plain and

sear, came up with him quickly, and took up a great stone, 
ind threw it at him, and hit him just on the head, but did 
aim no more harm than if he had thrown it against a wall ; 
but it answered Friday's end, for the rogue was so void of 
tear that he did it purely to make the bear follow him, and 
show us some laugh, as he called it. As soon as the bear felt 
the blow, and saw him, he turns about, and comes after lnm, 
taking very long strides, and shuffling on at a strange rate, as 
would have put a horse to a middling gallop : away runs 
Friday, and takes his course as if he ran towards us for help ; 
so we all resolved to fire at once upon the bear, and deliver 
my man ; though I was angry at him heartily for bringing 
the bear back upon us, when he was going about his own 
business another way : and especially I was angry that he had 
turned the bear upon us, and then run away ; and I called out, 
;t You dog! is this your making us laugh? Come away, and take 
your horse, that we may shoot the creature." He heard me, 
md cried out, " No shoot, no shoot ; stand still, and you get 
much laugh :" and as the nimble creature ran two feet for the 
bear's one, he turned on a sudden on one side of us, and see- 
ing a great oak tree fit for his purpose, he beckoned us to 
follow ; and doubling his pace, he got nimbly up the tree, 
laying his gun down upon the ground, at about five or six 
yards from the bottom of the tree. The bear soon came to 
the tree, and we followed at a distance : the first thing he did, 
lie stopped at the gun, smelled at it, but let it he, and up he 
scrambles into the tree, climbing like a cat, though so monstrous 
heasry. I was amazed at the folly, as I thought it, of my man, 
and could not for my life see anything to laugh at yet, till 
seeing the bear get up the tree, we all rode near to him. 

When we came to the tree, there was Friday got out to the 
small end of a large branch, and the bea>r got about half Avay 
to him. As soon as the bear got out to that part where the 
limb of the tree was weaker, — " Ha !" says he to us, " now 
you see me teach ee the beai dance:" so he began jumping 
and shaking the bough, at which the bear began to totter, but 
stood still, and began to look behind him, to see how he 
should get back ; then, indeed, we did laugh heartily. But 
Friday had not done with him by a great deal: when seeing 
him stand still, he called out to him again, as if he had supposed 
the bear could speak English, " What, you come no farther? 



KOBIXSON CRUSOE. 235 

pray you come farther ;" so lie left jumping and shaking the 
tree; and the bear, just as if he understood what he said, 
did come a little farther ; then he began jumping again, and 
the bear stopped again. We thought now was a good time 
to knock him in the head, and called to Friday to stand still, 
and we would shoot the bear : but lie cried out earnestly, 
" pray, pray! no shoot, me shoot by and then:" he 
would have said by-and-by. However, to shorten the story, 
Friday danced so much, and the bear stood so ticklish, that 
we had lausrhins; cnousrh, but still could not imagine what the 
fellow would do : for the first we thought he depended upon 
shaking the bear off; and we found the bear was too cunning 
for that too ; for he would not go out far enough to be thrown 
down, but clung fast with his great broad claws and feet, so 
that we could not imagine what would be the end of it, and 
what the jest would be at last. But Friday put us out of 
doubt quickly : for seeing the bear cling fast to the bough, 
and that he would not be persuaded to come any farther, 
" Well, well," says Friday, " you no come farther, me go ; 
you no come to me, me come to you ;" and upon this he 
went to the smaller end of the bough, where it would bend 
with his weight, and gently let himself down by it, sliding 
down the bough till he came near enough to jump down on 
his feet, and away he ran to his gun and took it up. " Well, 1 ' 
said I to him, " Friday, what will you do now ? Why don't 
you shoot him ?" " No shoot," says Friday, " no yet ; me 
shoot now, me no kill ; me stay, give you one more laugh :" 
and, indeed, so he did ; for when his enemy saw he was gone, 
he came back from the bough where he stood, but did it very 
cautiously, looking behind him every step, and coming back- 
ward till he got into the body of the tree ; then, with the 
same hinder end foremost, he came down the tree, grasping 
it with his claws, and moving one foot at a time, very 
leisurely. At this juncture, and just before he could set his 
hind foot on the ground, Friday stepped up close to him, 
clapped the muzzle of his piece into his ear, and shot him 
dead. Then the rogue turned about to see if we did not 
laugh ; and when he saw we were pleased, by our looks, he 
began to laugh very loud. " So we kill bear in my country," 
Says Friday. " So you kill them ?" says I ; " why, you have 
no guns." " No," says he, " no gun, but shoot great much

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 



long arrow." This was a good diversion to us ; but wo were 
still in a wild place, and our guide very much hurt, and what 
to do we hardly knew; the howling of wolves ran much in 
my head ; and, indeed, except the noise I once heard on the 
shore of Africa, I never heard anything that filled me with 
so much horror. 

These things, and the approach of night, called us off, or 
else, as Friday would have had us, we should certainly have 
taken the skin of this monstrous creature off, which was 
worth saving; but we had near three leagues to go, and 
our guide hastened us ; so we left him, and went forward on 
our journey. 

The ground was still covered with snow, though not so 
deep and dangerous as on the mountains ; and the ravenous 
creatures, as we 'heard afterwards, were come down into the 
forest and plain country, pressed by hunger to seek for food, 
and had done a great deal of mischief in the villages, where 
they surprised the country people, killed a great many of their 
sheep and horses, and some people too. We had one dan- 
gerous place to pass, and our guide told us, if there were more 
wolves in the country we should find them there ; and this 
was a small plain surrounded with woods on every side, and a 
long narrow defile, or lane, which we were to pass to get 
through the wood, and then we should come to the village 
where we were to lodge. It was within half an hour of sun- 
set when we entered the wood, and a little after sunset when 
we came into the plain : we met with nothing in the first 
wood, except that in a little plain within the wood, which was 
not above two furlongs over, we saw five great wolves cross 
the road, full speed, one after another, as if they had been 
in chase of some prey, and had it in view ; they took no notice 
of us, and were gone out of sight in a few moments. Upon 
this, our guide, who by the way was but a faint-hearted 
fellow, bid us keep in a ready posture, for he believed there 
were more wolves a-coming. We kept our arms ready, and 
our eyes about us ; but we saw no more wolves till we came 
through that wood, which was near half a league, and entered 
the plain. As soon as we came into the plain, we had occa- 
sion enough to look about us : the first object we met with 
was a horse which the wolves had killed, and at least a dozen 
of them at work, we could not say eating him, but picking his 



ROBINSON CKUSOE. 237 

bones rather; for they had eaten up all the flesh before. We 
did not think fit to disturb them at their feast, neither did 
they take much notice of us. Friday would have let fly at 
them, but I would not suffer him by any means; for I found 
we were like to have more business upon our hands than we 
were aware of. We had not gone half over the plain, when 
we began to hear the wolves howl in the wood on our left in 
a frightful manner, and presently after we saw about a hundred 
coming on directly towards us, all in a body, and most of 
them in a line, as regularly as an army drawn up by expe- 
rienced officers. I scarce knew in what manner to receive 
them, but found to draw ourselves in a close line was the only 
way ; so we formed in a moment : but that we might not have 
too much interval, I ordered that only every other man should 
lire, and that the others, who had not fired, should stand 
ready to give them a second volley immediately, if they con- 
tinued to advance upon us ; and then that those who had fired 
at first, should not pretend to load their fusees again, but stand 
ready, every one with a pistol, for we were all armed with a 
fusee and a pair of pistols each man ; so we were, by this 
method, able to fire six volleys, half of us at a time : however, 
at present we had no necessity ; for, upon firing the first 
volley, the enemy made a full stop, being terrified as well with 
the noise as with the fire ; four of them being shot in the head, 
dropped: several others were wounded, and went bleeding 
off, as we could see by the snow. I found they stopped, but 
did not immediately retreat ; whereupon, remembering that I 
had been told that the fiercest creatures were terrified at the 
voice of a man, I caused all the company to halloo as loud as 
we could ; and I found the notion not altogether mistaken ; 
for upon our shout they began to retire and turn about. I 
then ordered a second volley to be fired in their rear, which 
put them to the gallop, and away they went to the woods. 
This gave us leisure to charge our pieces again ; and that we 
might lose no time, we kept going ; but Ave had but little 
more than loaded our fusees, and put ourselves in readiness, 
when we heard a terrible noise in the same wood on our left, 
only that it was farther onward, the same way we were to go. 
The night was coming on, and the light began to be dusky, 
which made it worse on our side ; but the noise increasing, we 
could easily perceive that it was the howling and yelling of those 



238 nouixsox cuusor.. 

hellish creatures ; and on a sudden we perceived two or three 
troops of wolves, one on our left, one behind us, and one in 
our front, so that we seemed to be surrounded with them : 
however, as they did not fall upon us, we kept our way 
forward, as fast as we could make our horses go, which was 
only a good hard trot. In this manner, we came in view of 
the entrance of a wood, through which we were to pass, at 
the farther side of the plain ; but we were greatly surprised. 
when coming nearer the lane or pass, we saw a confused number 
of wolves standing just at the entrance. On a sudden, at 
another opening of the wood, we heard the noise of a gun, 
and looking that way, out rushed a horse, with a saddle and 
a bridle on him, flying like the wind, and sixteen or seven- 
teen wolves after him full speed : the horse had the advan- 
tage of them ; but as we supposed that he could not hold it 
at that rate, we doubted not but they would get up with him 
at last : no question but they did. 

But here we had a most horrible sight ; for riding up to 
the entrance where the horse came out, we found the carcasses 
of another horse and of two men, devoured by the ravenous 
creatures ; and one of the men was no doubt the same whom 
we heard fire the gun, for there lay a gun just by him fired 
off; but as to the man, his head and the upper part of his 
body were eaten up. This filled us with horror, and we knew 
not what course to take ; but the creatures resolved us soon, 
for they gathered about us presently, in hopes of prey ; and i 
verily believe there were three hundred of them. It happened, 
very much to our advantage, that at the entrance into the 
wood, but a little way from it, there lay some large timber 
trees, which had been cut down the summer before, and I sup- 
pose lay there for carriage. I drew my little troop in among 
those trees, and placing ourselves in a line behind one long 
tree, I advised them all to alight, and keeping that tree before 
us for a breastwork, to stand in a triangle, or three fronts, in- 
closing our horses in the centre. Wc did so, and it was well 
we did ; for never was a more furious charge than the crea- 
tures made upon us in this place. They came on with a growl- 
ing kind of noise, and mounted the piece of timber, which, as 
I said, was our breastwork, as if they were only rushing upon 
their prey ; and this fury of theirs, it seems, was principally 
occasioned by their seeing our horses behind us I ordered our 



ROBIXSON CRUSOE. Zot? 

men to fire as before, every other man; and they took ther 
aim so sure that they killed several of the wolves at the first 
volley ; but there was a necessity to keep a continual firing-, for 
they came on like devils, those behind pushing on those before. 

When we had fired a second volley of our fusees, we thought 
they stopped a little, and I hoped they would have gone off, 
but it was but a moment, for others came forward again ; 
so we fired two volleys of our pistols ; and I believe in these 
four firings we had killed seventeen or eighteen of them, and 
lamed twice as many, yet they came on again. I was loath to- 
spend our shot too hastily ; so I called my servant, not my 
man Friday, for he was better employed, for, with the greatest 
dexterity imaginable, he had charged my fusee and his own 
while we were engaged, — but, as I said, I called my other man, 
and giving him a horn of powder, I bade him lay a train all 
along the piece of timber, and let it be a large train. He did 
so, and had but just time to get away, when the wolves came 
up to it, and some got upon it, when I, snapping an uncharged 
pistol close to the powder, set it on fire ; those that were upon 
the timber were scorched with it, and six or seven of them fell,, 
or rather jumped in among us with the force and fright of the 
fire: we despatched these in an instant, and the rest were so 
frightened with the light, which the night — for it was now 
very near dark — made more terrible, that they drew back t 
little ; upon which I ordered our last pistols to be fired off in 
one volley, and after that we gave a shout ; upon this the 
wolves turned tail, and we sallied immediately upon near 
twenty lame ones that we found struggling on the ground, and 
fell to cutting them with our swords, which answered our ex- 
pectation, for the crying and howling they made was better 
understood by their fellows ; so that thev all fled and left us. 

We had, first and last, killed about tnreo-score of them, and 
liad it been daylight we had killed many more. The field of 
battle being thus cleared, we came forward again, for we had 
still near a league to go. We heard the ravenous creatures 
howl and yell in the woods as we went several times, and some- 
times wo fancied we saw some of them ; but the snow dazzling- 
our eyes, we were not certain. In about an hour more wo 
came to the town where we were to lodge, which we found in. 
a terrible fright, and all in arms; for, it seems, the night before 
the wolves and some bears had broke into the village, and put 



■ft 



24.0 K01JINS0N CKUSOE. 

them in such terror, that they were obliged to keep guard night 
and day, but especially in the night, to preserve their cattle, 
and indeed their people. 

The next morning our guide was so ill, and his limbs swelled 
so much with the rankling of his two wounds, that he could go 
no farther; so we were obliged to take a new guide here, and 
go to Thoulouse, where we found a warm climate, a fruitful, 
pleasant country, and no snow, no wolves, nor anything like 
them ; but when we told our story at Thoulouse, they told us 
it was nothing but what was ordinary in the great forest at 
the foot of the mountains, especially when the snow lay on the 
ground ; but they inquired much what kind of a guide we had 
ot, who would venture to bring us that way in such a severe 
season, and told us it was surprising we were not all devoured. 
"When we told them how we placed ourselves and the horses 
In the middle, they blamed us exceedingly, and told us it was 
fifty to one but we had been all destroyed, for it was the sight 
of the horses which made the wolves so furious, seeing their 
prey, and that at other times they are really afraid of a gun ; 
but being excessively hungry, and raging on that account, the 
eagerness to come at the horses had made them senseless of 
danger, and that if we had not by the continued fire, and at 
last by the stratagem of the train of powder, mastered them, 
it had been great odds but that we had been torn to pieces; 
whereas, had we been content to have sat still on horseback, 
and fired as horsemen, they would not have taken the horses 
so much for their own, when men were on their backs, as 
otherwise; and, withal, they told us that at last, if we had 
stood all together, and left our horse?, they would have been 
so eager to have devoured them, that we might have come off 
safe, especially having our firearms in our hands, and being 
so many in number. For my part, I was never so sensible of 
danger in my life, for, seeing above three hundred devils 
come roaring and open-mouthed to devour us, and having 
nothing to shelter us or retreat to, I gave myself over for lost ; 
and, as it was, I believe I shall never care to cross those 
mountains again ; I think I would much rather go a thousand 
leagues by sea, though I was sure to meet with a storm once 
ii week. 

I have nothing uncommon to take notice of in my passage 
through Fiance — nothing but what other travellers have given 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 



241 



an account of with much more advantage than I can. I tra- 
velled from Thoulouse to Paris, and without any considerable 
stay came to Calais, and landed safe at Dover the 14th of 
January, after having a severe cold season to travel in. 




I was now come to the centre of my travels, and had in a 
little time all my new-discovered estate safe about me, the bills 
of exchange which I brought with me having been very cur- 
rently paid. 

My principal guide and privy-counsellor was mv good, 
16 



242 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

ancient widow, who, in gratitude for the money I had sent 
her, thought no pains too much nor care too great to employ 
for me ; and I trusted her so entirely with everything, that I 
was perfectly easy as to the security of my effects ; and, in- 
deed, I was very happy from the beginning, and now to the 
end, in the unspotted integrity of this good gentlewoman. 

And now, having resolved to dispose of my plantation in 
the Brazils, I wrote to my old friend at Lisbon, who having 
offered it to the two merchants^, the survivors of my trustees, 
who lived in the Brazils, they accepted the offer, and remitted 
thirty-three thousand pieces-of-eight to a correspondent of 
theirs at Lisbon to pay for it. 

In return, I signed the instrument, of sale in the form which 
they sent from Lisbon, tand sent it to -my old man, who sent 
me the bills of exchange for thirty-two thousand eight hun- 
dred pieces-of-eight for the estate, reserving the payment of 
one hundred moidores .a . year to him (the old man) during his 
life, and fifty msidores afterwards to Ms son for his life, whieh 
I had promised theavand which the plantation was to make 
good as a rent-charge. And thus I have given the first part 
of a life of fortune and adventure—*! life of Providence's 
chequer-work, and of a variety which the world will seldom 
be able to show the like of- — beginning foolishly, but closing 
muoh more happily than any part of it ever gave me leave so 
much as to hope for. 

Any one would think that in this state of complicated good 
fortune I was past running any more hazards, and so, indeed, 
I had been, if other circumstances had concurred ; but I was 
inured to a wandering life, had no family, nor many relations ; 
nor, however rich, had I contracted much acquaintance ; and 
though I had sold my estate in the Brazils, yet I could not 
keep that country out of my head, and had a great mind to be 
upon the wing again ; especially I could not resist the strong 
inclination I had to see my island, and to know if the poor 
Spaniards were in being there. My true friend, the widow, 
earnestly dissuaded me from it, and so far prevailed with me, 
that for almost seven years she prevented my running abroad, 
during which time I took my two nephews, the children of one 
of my brothers, into my care : the eldest having something of 
his own, I bred up as a gentleman, and gave him a setltenient 
of some addition to his estate after my decease. The other I 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 243 

placed with the captain of a ship ; and after five years, find- 
ing him a sensible, bold, enterprising young fellow, I put him 
into a good ship, and sent him to sea ; and this young fellow 
afterwards drew me in, as old as I was, to farther adventures 
myself. 

In the mean time I in part settled myself here ; for, first of 
■all, I married, and that not either to my disadvantage or dis- 
satisfaction, and had three children, two sons and one 
daughter ; but my wife dying, and my nephew coming home 
with good success from a voyage to Spain, my inclination to 
go abroad and his importunity prevailed, and engaged me to 
go in his ship as a private trader to the East Indies ; this was 
in the year 1694. 

In this voyage I visited my new colony in the island — saw 
my successors the Spaniards — had the whole story of their 
lives, and of the villains I left there — how at first they insulted 
the poor Spaniards — how they afterwards agreed, disagreed, 
united, separated, and how at last the Spaniards were obliged 
to use violence with them — how they were subjected to the 
Spaniards — how honestly the Spaniards used them ; a history, 
if it were entered into, as full of variety and wonderful acci- 
dents as my own part, particularly, also, as to their battles 
with the Caribbeans, who landed several times upon the 
island, and as to the improvement they made upon the island 
itself, and how five of them made an attempt upon the main- 
land, and brought away eleven men and five women prisoners, 
by which, at my coming, I found about twenty young children 
on the island. 

Here I stayed about twenty days — left them supplies of all 
necessary things, and particularly of arms, powder, shot, 
clothes, tools, and two workmen, which I brought from Eng- 
land with me, viz., a carpenter and a smith. 

Besides this, I shared the lands into parts with them, re- 
served to myself the property of the whole, but gave them 
such parts respectively as they agreed on ; and having settled 
all things with them, and engaged them not to leave the 
place, I left them there. 

From thence I touched at the Brazils, from whence I sent 
a bark, which I bought there, with more people to the island ; 
and in it, besides other supplies, I sent seven women, being 
such as I found proper for service, or for wives to such as 



244 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

would take thorn. As to the Englishmen, I promised them to 
send them some women from England, with a good cargo of 
necessaries, if they would apply themselves to planting, which 
I afterwards could not perform. The fellows proved very 
honest and diligent after they were mastered, and had their 
properties set apart for them. I sent them, also, from the 
Brazils five cows, three of them being big with calf, some 
sheep, and some hogs, which when I came again were con^ 
siderably increased. 

But all these things, with an account how three hundred 
Caribbees came and invaded them, and ruined their planta- 
tions, and how they fought with that whole number twice, and 
were at first defeated, and one of them killed ; but, at last, a 
storm destroying their enemies' canoes, they famished or 
destroyed almost all the rest, and renewed and recovered the 
possession of their plantation, and still lived upon the island. 

All these things, with some very surprising incidents in 
some new adventures of my own, for ten years more, I shall 
give a farther account of in the second part of ray history. 



PART II. 

That homely proverb, " That what is bred in the bone 
•will not go out of the flesh," was never more verified than in 
the story of my life. Any one would think that after thirty- 
five years' affliction, and a variety of unhappy circumstances, 
which few men, if any, ever went through before, and after 
near seven years of peace and enjoyment in the fulness of all 
things, grown old, and when, if ever, it might be allowed me 
to have had experience of every state of middle life, and to 
know which wa3 most adapted to make a man completely 
happy ; I say, after all this, any one would have thought that 
the native propensity to rambling, which I gave an account 
of in my first setting out in the world to have been so pre- 
dominant in my thoughts, should be worn out, the volatile 
part be fully evacuated, or at least condensed, and I might, 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 245 

at sixty-one years of age, have been a little inclined to stay 
at home, and have done venturing life and fortune any 
more. 

But when I came home, I was still as uneasy as I was 
before; I had no relish for the place, no employment in it, 
nothing to do but to saunter about like an idle person. This 
also was the thing which, of all circumstances of life, was the 
most my aversion, who had been all my days used to an 
active life. 

It was now the beginning of the year 1693, when my 
nephew, whom I had brought up to the sea, and had made 
commander of a ship, was come home from a short voyage to 
Bilboa, being the first he had made. He came to me, and 
told me that some merchants of his acquaintance had been 
proposing to him to go a voyage for them to the East Indies 
and to China, as private traders. "And noAV, uncle," says 
he, " if you will go to sea with me, I will engage to land you 
upon your old habitation in the island; for we are to touch 
at the Brazils." 

I was not long resolving ; for, indeed, the importunities of 
my nephew joined so effectually with my inclination, that 
nothing could oppose me : on the other hand, my wife being 
dead, nobody concerned themselves so much for me as to 
persuade me to one way or the other, except my ancient good, 
friend the widow, who earnestly struggled with me to consider 
my years, my easy circumstances, and the needless hazards of 
a long voyage, and, above all, my young children. But it 
was all to no purpose. I had an irresistible desire for the 
voyage ; and I told her I thought there was something so un- 
common in the impressions I had upon my mind, that it would 
be a kind of resisting Providence if I should attempt to stay 
at home: after which she ceased her expostulations, and 
joined with me, not only in making provision for my voyage, 
but also in settling my family affairs for my absence, and 
providing for the education of my children. 

In order to do this, I made my will, and settled the estate 
I had in such a manner for my children, and placed in such 
hands, that I was perfectly easy and satisfied they would have 
justice done them, whatever might befall me : and for their 
education, I left it wholly to the widow, with a sufficient 
maintenance to herself for her care — all which she richly 



246 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

deserved ; for no mother could have taken more care in their 
education, or understood it better : and as she lived till I 
came home, I also lived to thank her for it. 

My nephew was ready to sail about the beginning of 
January, 1694-5; and I, with my man Friday, went on 
board, in the Downs, the 8th ; having besides a framed sloop, 
which was shipped in pieces, a very considerable cargo of all 
kinds of necessary things for my colony ; which, if I did not 
find in good condition, I resolved to leave so. 

First, I carried with me some servants, whom I purposed 
to place there as inhabitants, or at least to set on work there, 
upon my account, while I stayed, and either to leave them 
there or carry them forward, as they should appear willing ;. 
particularly I carried two carpenters, a smith, and a very 
handy, ingenious fellow, who was a cooper by trade, and was- 
also a general mechanic ; for he was dexterous at making 
wheels, and hand-mills to grind corn, was a good turner and 
a good pot-maker ; he also made anything that was proper 
to make of earth or of wood ; in a word, we called him our 
Jack-of-all-trades. With these I carried a tailor, who had 
offered himself to go a passenger to the East Indies with my 
nephew, but afterwards consented to stay on our new plan- 
tation ; and who proved a most necessary, handy fellow, as- 
could be desired, in many other businesses besides that of his. 
trade ; for necessity arms us for all employments. 

My cargo, as near as I can recollect, consisted of a sufficient 
quantity of linen, and some English thin stuffs, for clothing 
the Spaniards that I expected to find there ; and enough as, 
by my calculation, might comfortably supply them for seven 
years. If I remember right, the materials I carried for 
clothing them amounted to above two hundred pounds ; and 
near a hundred pounds more in iron-work, nails, tools of every 
kind, staples, hooks, hinges, and every necessary thing I could 
think of. 

I carried also a hundred spare arms, muskets, and fasees ; 
besides some pistols, a considerable quantity of shot of all 
sizes, three or four tons of lead, and two pieces of brass 
cannon ; and, because I knew not what time and what extre- 
mities I was providing for, I carried a hundred barrels of 
powder, besides swords, cuthiss.s, and the iron part of some, 
pikes and halberts ; so that, in short, we had a large maga- 



ROBINSON CKUSOE. 247 

zine of all sorts of stores : and I made my nephew carry two 
small quarter-deck guns more than he wanted for his ship, to 
leave behind if there was occasion ; that when we came there, 
we might build a fort, and man it against all sorts of enemies : 
and, indeed, I at first thought there would be need enough 
for all, and much more, if we hoped to maintain our posses- 
sion of the island ; as shall be seen in the course of the 
story. 

We set out on the 5th of February from Ireland ; and, to 
shorten my story, I came to my old habitation, the island, on 
the 10th of April, 1695. 

As soon as I saw the place, I called for Friday, and asked 
him if he knew where he was ? He looked about a little, and 
presently clapping his hands, cried, " O yes, O there, yes, 
O there !" pointing to our old habitation, and fell dancing 
and capering like a mad fellow ; and I had much ado to 
keep him from jumping into the sea, to swim ashore to the 
place. 

" Well, Friday," says I, " do you think we shall find any- 
body here or no ? and do you think we shall see your father ?" 
The fellow stood mute as a stock a good while ; but when I 
named his father, the poor affectionate creature looked de- 
jected, and I could see the tears run down his face very 
plentifully. " What is the matter, Friday ?" says I : " are 
you troubled because you may see your father ?" " No, no," 
says he, shaking his head, " no see him more ; no, never 
more see him again." "Why so," said I, "Friday? how do 
you know that?" "O no, O no," says Friday; "he long 
ago die, long ago ; he much old man." " Well, well," says 
I, " Friday, you don't know : but shall we see any one else 
then ?" The fellow, it seems, had better eyes than I, and he 
points to the hill just above my old house ; and though we 
lay half a league off, he cries out, " We see, we see, yes, yes, 
we see much man there, and there, and there." I looked, 
but I saw nobody, no, not with a perspective-glass, which 
was, I suppose, because I could not hit the place ; for the 
fellow was right, as I found upon inquiry the next clay ; and 
there were five or six men all together, who stood to look at 
the ship, not knowing what to think of us. 

As soon as Friday told me he saw people, I caused the 
English ensign to be spread, and fired three guns, to give 



248 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

them notice we were friends ; and in about half a quarter of 
an hour after, we perceived a smoke arise from the side of 
the creek : so I immediately ordered the boat out, taking 
Friday with me ; and hanging out a white flag, I went directly 
on shore. We had about sixteen men well armed, if we had 
found any new guests there which we did not know of: but 
we had no need of weapons. 

As we went on shore upon the flood tide, near high water, 
we rowed directly into the creek ; and the first man I fixed 
my eye upon was the Spaniard whose life I had saved, and 
whojfia I knew by his face perfectly well. I ordered nobody 
to go on shore at first but myself; but there was no keeping 
Friday in the boat, for the affectionate creature had spied his 
father at a distance, a good way off the Spaniards, where, 
indeed, I saw nothing of him ; and if they had not let him go 
ashore, he would have jumped into the sea. He was no 
sooner on shore, but he flew away to his father, like an arrow 
out of a bow. It would have made any man shed tears, to 
have seen the first transports of this poor fellow's joy when 
he came to his father : how he embraced him, kissed him, 
stroked his face, took him up in his arms, set him down upon 
a tree, and lay down by him ; then stood and looked at him, 
as any one would look at a strange picture, for a quarter of 
an hour together ; then lay down on the ground, and stroked 
his legs, and kissed them, then got up again, and stared at 
him ; one would have thought the fellow bewitched. But it 
would have made a dog laugh the next day to see how bis 
passion ran out another way : in the morning, he walked 
along the shore, with his father, several hours, always leading 
him by the hand, as if he had been a lady ; and every now 
and then he would come to the boat to fetch something or 
other for him, either a lump of sugar, a dram, a biscuit, or 
something or other that was good. In the afternoon, his 
frolics ran another way ; for then he would set the old man 
down upon the ground and dance about him, and make a 
thousand antic postures and gestures ; and all the while he 
did this, he would be talking to him, and telling him one 
story or other of his travels, and of what had happened to 
him abroad, to divert hirn. 

It would be needless to take notice of all the ceremonies 
and civilities that the Spaniards received me with. The first

249 



Spaniard, whose life I had saved, came towards the boat, at- 
tended by one more, carrying a flag of truce also ; and he 
not only did not know me at first, but he had no thoughts, 
no notion of its being me that was come, till I spoke to him. 




" Seignior," said I, in Portuguese, " do you not know me?" 
At which he spoke not a word, but giving his musket to the 
man that was with him, threw his arms abroad, saying some- 
thing in Spanish that I did not perfectly hear, came forward 
and embraced me, telling me he was inexcusable not to know 
that face a^ain that he had once seen as if an angel from 



250 ROBINSON CEDSOE. 

Heaven, sent to save his life: he said abundance of very 
handsome things, and then beckoning to the person that 
attended him, bade him go and call out his comrades. He 
then asked me if I would walk to my old habitation, where 
he would give me possession of my own house again, and 
where I should see they had made but mean improvements : 
so I walked along with him ; but, alas ! I could no more find 
the place than if I had never been there; for they had 
planted so many trees, and placed them in such a position, so 
thick and close to one another, and in ten years' time they 
were grown so big, that in short, the place was inaccessible, 
except by such windings and blind ways as they themselves 
only, who made them, could find. 

I asked them what put them upon all these fortifications : 
he told me- 1 "would say there was need enough of it, when 
they had given me an account how they had passed their 
time since their arriving in the island^ especially after they 
had the misfortune to find that I was gone. He told me he 
could not but have some satisfaction in my good fortune, 
when he heard that I was gone in a good ship, and that he 
had oftentimes a strong- persuasion that one time or other he 
should see me again : but nothing that ever befell him in his 
life, he said, was so surprising and* affiicting to him at first, 
as the disappointment he was under when he came back to 
the island and found I was not there. 

As to the three barbarians (so he called them) that were 
left behind, and of whom, he said, he had a long story to tell 
me, the Spaniards all thought themselves much better among 
the savages, only that their number was so small : " and," 
says he, " had they been strong enough, we had been all 
long ago in purgatory." 

While I was thus saying this, the man came whom he had 
sent back, and with him eleven more. In the dress they 
were in, it was impossible to guess what nation they were of; 
but he made all clear, both to them and to me. First he 
turned to me, and pointing to them, said, " These, sir, are 
some of the gentlemen who owe their lives to you ;" and then 
turning to them, and pointing to me, he let them know who 
I was ; upon which they all came up, one by one, not as if 
they had been sailors, and ordinary fellows, and the like, but 
really as if they had been ambassadors or noblemen, and I a 



ROBINSON CKUSOE. 251 

monarch or great conqueror : their behaviour was, to the last 
pegree, obliging and courteous, and yet mixed with a manly, 
majestic gravity, which very well became them ; and in short, 
they had so much more manners than I, that I scarce knew 
how to receive their civilities, much less how to return them. 
in kind. 

The history of their coming to, and conduct in, the island, 
after my going away, is so very remarkable, and has so many 
incidents, which the former part of my relation will help tO' 
understand, and which will, in most of the particulars, refer 
to the account I have already given, that I cannot but commit 
them, with great delight, to the reading of those that come 
after me. 

I shall no longer trouble the story with a relation in the 
first person, which will put me to the expense of ten thousand 
" said I's," and " said he's," and " he told me's," and " I told 
him's," and the like ; but I shall collect the facts historically,. 
as near as I can gather them out of my memory, from what 
they related to me, and from what I met with in my con- 
versing with them, and with the place. 

In order to do this succinctly, and as intelligibly as I can, 
I must go back to the circumstances in which I left the- 
island, and in which the persons were of whom I am to speak. 
And first, it is necessary to repeat that I had sent away 
Friday's father and the Spaniard to fetch over the Spaniard's 
companions that he left behind him. 

And I desired the Spaniard would give me a particular 
account of his voyage back to his countrymen with the boat, 
when I sent him to fetch them over. He told me there was 
little variety in that part, for nothing remarkable happened 
to them on the way, having had very calm weather, and a 
smooth sea. As for his countrymen, it could not be doubted, 
he said, but that they were overjoyed to see him ; that when 
he told them the story of his deliverance, and in what manner 
he was furnished for carrying them away, it was like a dream 
to them, and their astonishment, he said, was somewhat like 
that of Joseph's brethren, when he told them who he was, 
and the story of his exaltation in Pharaoh's court; but when 
he showed them the arms, the powder, the ball, and pro- 
visions, that he brought them for their voyage, they were 
restored to themselves, took a just share of the joy of their 



252 IIOBINSON CRUSOE. 

deliverance, and immediately prepared to come away with him. 
Their first business was to get canoes : and in this they 
were obliged not to stick so much upon the honesty of it, but 
to trespass upon their friendly savages, and to borrow two 
large canoes, on pretence of going out a fishing, or for 
pleasure. In these they came away the next morning. It 
seems they wanted no time to get themselves ready ; for they 
had no baggage, neither clothes, provisions, nor anything in 
the world but what they had on them, and a few roots to eat, 
of which they used to make their bread. 

They were in all three weeks absent ; and in that time, 
unluckily for them, I had the occasion offered for my escape, 
as I mentioned in the other part, and to get off from the 
island, leaving three of the most impudent, hardened, un- 
governed, disagreeable villains behind me, that any man 
could desire to meet with ; to the poor Spaniards' great grief 
and disappointment, you may be sure. 

The only just things the rogues did was, that when the 
Spaniards came ashore, they gave my letter to them, and 
gave them provisions, and other relief, as I had ordered them 
to do ; also they gave them the long paper of directions which 
I had left with them, containing the particular methods which 
I took for managing every part of my life there ; nor did 
they refuse to accommodate the Spaniards with anything else, 
for they agreed very well for some time. They gave them 
an equal admission into the house, or cave, and they, began 
to live very sociably ; and the head Spaniard, who had seen 
pretty much of my methods, and Friday's father together, 
managed all their affairs ; but as for the Englishmen, they 
did nothing but ramble about the island, shoot parrots, and 
catch tortoises ; and when they came home at night, the 
Spaniards provided their suppers for them. 

The Spaniards would have been satisfied with this, had the 
others but let them alone ; which, however, thev could not 
find in their hearts to do long; but, like the dog in the 
manger, they would not eat themselves, neither would they 
let the others eat. The differences, nevertheless, were at first 
but trivial, and such as are not worth relating, but at last it 
broke out into open war : and it began with all the rudeness 
and insolence that can be imagined, — without reason or pro- 
vocation, contrary to nature, and, indeed, to common sense : 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 253 

and though, it is true, the first relation of it came from the 
Spaniards themselves, whom I may call the accusers, yet 
•when I came to examine the fellows, they could not deny a 
word of it. 

But before I come to the particulars of this part, I must 
supply a defect in my former relation : and this was, I forgot 
to set down, among the rest, that just as we were weighing 
the anchor to set sail, there happened a little quarrel on 
board of our ship, which I was once airaid would have turned 
to a second mutiny ; nor was it appeased till the captain, 
rousing up his courage, and taking us all to his assistance, 
parted them by forcoj and, making two of the most refrac- 
tory fellows prisoners, he laid them in irons : and as they had 
been active in the former disorders, and let fall some danger- 
ous words, the second time he threatened to carry them in 
irons to England, and have them hanged there for mutiny, 
and running away with the ship. This, it seems, though the 
captain did not intend to do it, frightened some other men in 
the ship ; and some of them had put it into the heads of the 
rest, that the captain only gave them good words for the 
present, tiil they should come to some English port, and that 
then they should be all put into gaol, and tried for their 
lives. The mate got intelligence of this, and acquainted us 
with it ; upon which it was desired that I, who still passed 
for a great man among them, should go down with the mate, 
and satisfy the men, and tell them that they might be assured, 
if they behaved well the rest of the voyage, all they had 
done for the time past should be pardoned. So I went, and 
after passing my honour's word to them, they appeared easy, 
and the more so when I caused the two men that were in 
irons to be released and forgiven. 

But this mutiny had brought us to an anchor for that 
night ; the wind also falling cairn next morning, we found 
that our two men, who had been laid in irons, had stolen 
each of them a musket, and some other weapons (what pow- 
der or shot they had we knew not), and had taken the 
ship's pinnace, which was not yet hauled up, and ran away 
with her to their companions in roguery on shore. As soon 
as we found this, I ordered the long-boat on shore with twelve 
men and the mate, and away they went to seek the rogues ; 
but they could neither find them or any of the rest, for they 



254 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

all fled into the woods when they saw the boat coming on 
shore. The mate was once resolved, in justice to their 
roguery, to have destroyed their plantations, burned all their 
household stuff and furniture, and left them to shift without 
it ; but having no orders, he let it all alone, left everything 
as he found it, and, bringing the pinnace away, came on 
board without them. These two men made their number 
five ; but the other three villains were so much more wicked 
than they, that after they had been two or three days toge- 
ther, they turned the two new comers out of doors to shift 
for themselves, and would have nothing to do with them ; 
nor could they, for a good while, be persuaded to give them 
any food : as for the Spaniards, they were not yet come. 

When the Spaniards came first on shore, the business be- 
gan to go forward : the Spaniards would have persuaded the 
thrse English brutes to have taken in their countrymen 
again, that they might be all one family ; but they would not 
hear of it : so the two poor fellows lived by themselves ; and 
finding nothing but industry and application would make 
them live comfortably, they pitched their tents on the north 
shore of the island, but a little more to the west, to be out 
of danger of the savages, who always landed on the east 
parts of the island. 

Here they built them two huts, one to lodge in, and the 
other to lay up their magazines and stores in; and the 
-Spaniards having given them some corn for seed, and some 
of the pease which I had left them, they dug, planted, and 
enclosed, after the pattern I had set for them all, and began 
to live pretty well. Their first crop of corn was on the 
ground ; and though it was but a little bit of land which 
they had dug up at first, having had but a little time, yet it 
was enough to relieve them, and find them with bread and 
other eatables ; and one of the fellows being the cook's mate 
of the ship, was very ready at making soup, puddings, and 
such other preparations as the rice, and the milk, and such 
little flesh as they got, furnished him to do. 

They were going on in this little thriving position when 
the three unnatural rogues — their own countrymen, too — in 
mere humour and to insult them, came and bullied them, and 
told them that the island was theirs : that the governor, 
meaning me, had given them the possession uf it, and nobody 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 255 

else had any right to it ; and that they should build no 
houses upon then- ground, unless they would pay rent for 
them. 

The two men, thinking they were jesting at first, asked 
them to come in and sit down, and see what fine houses they 
were that they had built, and to tell them what rent they 
demanded ; an'd one of them merrily said, if they were the 
ground-landlords, he hoped, if they built tenements upon 
their land, and made improvements, they would, according 
to the custom of landlords, grant a long lease : and desired 
they would get a scrivener to draw the writings. One of the 
three, cursing and raging, told them they should see they 
were not in jest ; and going to a little place at a distance, 
where the honest men had made a fire to dress their victuals, 
he takes a fire-brand, and claps it to the outside of their hut, 
and very fairly sets it on fire ; and it would have been all 
burned down in a few minutes, if one of the two had not run 
to the fellow, thrust him away, and trod the fire out with his 
feet, and that not without some difficulty too. 

The fellow was in such a rage at the honest man's thrust- 
ing him away, that he returned upon him, with a pole he had 
in his hand, and had not the man avoided the blow very 
nimbly, and run into the hut, he had ended his days at once. 
His comrade, seeing the danger they were both in, ran in 
after him, and immediately they came both out with their 
muskets, and the man that was first struck at with the pole, 
knocked the fellow down that began the quarrel, with the 
stock of his musket, and that before the other two could 
come to help him ; and then seeing the rest come at them, 
they stood together, and presenting the other ends of their 
pieces to them, bade them stand oft'. 

The others had fire-arms with them too ; but one of the 
two honest men, bolder than his comrade, and made despe- 
rate by his danger, told them, if they offered to move hand 
or foot, they were dead men, and boldly commanded them to 
lay down their arms. They did not, indeed, lay down their 
arms, but seeing him so resolute, it brought them to a par- 
ley, and they consented to take their wounded man with 
them and be gone : and, indeed, it seems the fellow was 
•wounded sufficiently with the blow. However, they were 
much in the wrong, since they had the advantage, that they 



256 KOCIXSON CRUSOE. 

did not disarm them effectually, as they might have done, 
and have gone immediately to the Spaniards, and given them 
an account how the rogues had treated them ; for the three 
villains studied nothing but revenge, and every day gave 
them some intimation that they did so. 

But not to crowd this part with an account of the lesser 
part of the rogueries, such as treading down their corn ; 
shooting three young kids and a she-goat, which the poor 
men had got to breed up tame for their store ; and plaguing 
them night and day in this manner ; it forced the two men 
to such a desperation, that they resolved to fight them all 
three, the first time they had a fair opportunity. In order 
to do this, they resolved to go to the castle, as they called it 
(that was my old dwelling), where the three rogues and the 
Spaniards all lived together at that time, intending to have a 
fair battle, and the Spaniards should stand by to see fair play: 
so they got up in the morning before day, and came to the 
place, and called the Englishmen by their names, telling 
a Spaniard, that answered, that they wanted to speak with 
them. 

It happened that the day before, two of the Spaniards, 
having been in the woods, had seen one of the two English- 
men, whom, for distinction, I called the honest men, and he 
had made a sad complaint to the Spaniards of the barbarous 
usage they had met with from their three countrymen, and 
how they had ruined their plantation, and destroyed their 
corn that they had laboured so hard to bring forward, and 
killed the milch-goat and their three kids, which was all they 
had provided for their sustenance ; and that if he and his 
friends, meaning the Spaniards, did not assist them again, 
they should be starved. When the Spaniards came home at 
night, and they were all at supper, one of them took the 
freedom to reprove the three Englishmen, though in very 
gentle and mannerly terms, and asked them how they could 
be so cruel, they being harmless, inoffensive fellows: that 
they were putting themselves in a way to subsist by their 
labour, and that it had cost them a great deal of pains to 
bring things to such perfection as they were then in. 

One of the Englishmen returned very briskly, " What had 
they to do there ? that they came on shore without leave ; 
and that they should not plant or build upon the island: it 



EOBINSON CRUSOE. 



257 

was none of their ground." "Why," says the Spaniard 
very calmly, " Seignior Inglese, they must not starve." The 
Englishman replied, like a rough-hewn tarpauling, "They 
might starve, they should n^t plant nor build in that place." 




"But what must they do, then, seignior?" said the Spaniard. 
Another of the brutes returned, " Do ? they should be ser- 
vants, and work for them." " But how can you expect that 
of them V" says the Spaniard: "they are not bought with 
your money: you have no right to make them servants." 
The Englishman answered, " The island was theirs ; the 
17 



258 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

governor had given it to them, and no man had anything to 
do there but themselves ;" and with that, swore by his Maker 
that they would go and burn all their new huts ; they should 
build none upon their land. " Why, seignior," says the 
Spaniard, " by the same rule, we must be your servants too." 
" Aye," says the bold dog, " and so you shall, too, before we 
have done with you ;" mixing two or three oaths in the 
proper intervals of his speech. The Spaniard only smiled at 
that, and made him no answer. However, this little dis- 
course had heated them ; and starting up, one says to the 
other (I think it was he they called Will Atkins), " Come, 
Jack, let's go, and have t'other brush with them ; we'll de- 
molish their castle, I'll warrant you; they shall plant no 
colony in our dominions.' 1 

Upon this, they went all trooping away, with every man a 
gun, a pistol, and a sword, and muttered some insolent things 
among themselves, of what they would do to the Spaniards 
too, when opportunity offered ; but the Spaniards, it seems, 
did not so perfectly understand them as to know all the par- 
ticulars, only that, in general, they threatened them hard for 
taking the two Englishmen's part. 

Whither they w r ent, or how they ibrafeowed their time that 
evening, the Spaniards said they did not know ; but it seems 
they wandered about fhe country, part of the night, and then 
lying down in the plaoe which I used to call my bower, they 
were weary, and overslept themselves. The case was this: 
they had resolved to stay till midnight, and so to take the 
two poor men when they were asleep, and, as they acknow- 
ledged afterwards, intended to set fire to their huts while 
they were in them, and either burn them there, or murder 
them as they came out. As malice seldom sleeps very 
sound, it was very strange they should not have been kept 
awake. 

However, as the two men had also a design upon them, as 
I have said, though a much fairer one thaD that of burning 
and murdering, it happened, and very luckily for them all, 
that they were up and gone abroad, before the bloody-minded 
rogues came to their huts. 

When they came there, and found the men gone, Atkins, 
who, it seems, was the forwarder man, called out to his 
comrade, " Ha, Jack, here's the nest, but the birds are flown." 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 259 

They mused awhile, to think what should be the occasion of 
their being gone abroad so soon, and suggested presently that 
the Spaniards had given them notice of it ; and with that 
they shook hands, and swore to one another that they would 
be revenged of the Spaniards. As soon as they had made 
this bloody bargain, they fell to work with the poor men's 
habitation ; they did not set fire, indeed, to anything, but 
they pulled down both their houses, and pulled them so limb 
from limb that they left not the least stick standing, or scarce 
any sign on the ground where they stood; they tore all their 
little collected household stuff in pieces, and threw everything 
about in such a manner, that the poor men afterwards found 
some of their things a mile off their habitation. When they 
had done this, they pulled up all the young trees which the 
poor men had planted ; pulled up an inclosure they had made 
to secure their cattle and their corn ; and sacked and plun- 
dered everything as completely as a horde of Tartars would 
have done. 

The two men were, at this juncture, gone to find them out, 
and had resolved to fight them wherever they had been, 
though they were but two to three ; so that, had they met, 
there certainly would have been bloodshed among them ; for 
they were all very stout, resolute fellows. 

But Providence took more care to keep them asunder than 
they themselves could do to meet ; for, as if they had dogged 
one another, when the three were gone thither, the two were 
here ; and afterwards, when the two went back to find them, 
the three were come to the old habitation again : we shall see 
their different conduct presently. When the three came back 
like furious creatures, flushed with the rage which the work 
they had been about had put them into, they came up to the 
Spaniards, and told them what they had done, by way of 
scoff and bravado ; and one of them stepping up to one of the 
Spaniards, as if they had been a eouple of boys at play, takes 
hold of his hat as it was upon his head, and giving it a twirl 
about, fleering in his face, says to him, " And you, Seignior 
Jack Spaniard, shall have the same sauce if you do not mend 
your manners." The Spaniard, who, though a quiet, civil 
man, was as brave a man as could be, and, withal, a strong, 
well-made man, looked at him for a good while, and then, 
having no weapon in his hand, stepped gravely up to him, 



2C0 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

and, with one blow of his fist, knocked him down, as an ox is 
felled with a pole-axe ; at which one of the rogues, as inso- 
lent as the first, fired his pistol at the Spaniard immediately : 
he missed his body, indeed, for the bullets went through his 
hair, but one of them touched the tip of his ear, and he bled 
pretty much. The blood made the Spaniard believe he was 
more hurt than he really was, and that put him into some 
heat, for before he acted all in a perfect calm ; but now re- 
solving to go through with his work, he stooped, and took 
the fellow's musket whom he had knocked down, and was 
just going to shoot the man who had fired at him, when the 
rest of the Spaniards, being in the cave, came out, and calling 
to him not to shoot, they stepped in, secured the other two, 
and took their arms from them. 

When they were thus disarmed, and found they had made 
all the Spaniards their enemies, as well as their own country- 
men, they began to cool, and, giving the Spaniards better 
words, would have had their arms again ; but the Spaniards, 
considering the feud that was between them and the other 
two Englishmen, and that it w r ould be the best method they 
could take to keep them from killing one another, told them 
they would do them no harm ; and if they would live peace- 
ably, they would be very willing to assist and associate with 
them as they did before ; but that they could not think of 
giving them their arms again, while they appeared so resolved 
to do mischief with them to their own countrymen, and had 
even threatened them all to make them their servants. 

The rogues were now no more capable to hear reason than 
to §ct with reason ; but being refused their arms, they went 
raving away, and raging like madmen, threatening what they 
would do, though they had no fire-arms. But the Spaniards, 
despising their threatening, told them they should take care 
how they offered any injury to their plantation or cattle, for 
if they did, they would shoot them as they would ravenous 
beasts, wherever they found them ; and if they fell into their 
hands alive, they should certainly be hanged. However, this 
was far from cooling them, but away they went, raging and 
swearing like furies of hell. As soon as they were gone, the 
two men came back, in passion and rage enough also, though 
of another kind ; for having been at their plantation, and 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 2G1 

finding it all demolished and destroyed, as above, it will 
easily be supposed they had provocation enough. They could 
scarce have room to tell their tale, the Spaniards were so 
eager to tell them theirs ; and it was strange enough to find 
that three men should thus bully nineteen, and receive no 
punishment at all. 

The Spaniards, indeed, despised them, and especially, 
having thus disarmed them, made light of their threaten- 
ings ; but the two Englishmen resolved to have their remedy 
against them, what pains soever it cost to find them out. 
But the Spaniards interposed here too, and told them, that 
as they had disarmed them, they could not consent that they 
(the two) should pursue them with fire-arms, and perhaps 
kill them. " But," said the grave Spaniard, who was their 
governor, " we will endeavour to make them do you justice, 
if you will leave it to us ; for there is no doubt but they will 
•come to us again, when their passion is over, being not able 
to subsist without our assistance: we promise you to make' 
no peace with them, without having a full satisfaction for 
you ; and, upon this condition, we hope you will promise to 
use no violence with them, other than in your own defence."' 
The two Englishmen yielded to this with great reluctance ; 
but the Spaniards protested that they did it only to keep them 
from bloodshed, and to make them all easy at last. 

In about five days' time, the three vagrants, tired with 
wandering, and almost starved with hunger, having chiefly 
lived on turtles' eggs all that while, came back to the grove ; 
and finding my Spaniard, who, as I have said, was the gover- 
nor, and two more with him, walking by the side of the 
creek, they came up in a very submissive, humble manner, 
and begged to be received again into the family. The 
Spaniards used them civilly, but told them they had acted 
so unnaturally to their countrymen, and so very grossly to 
them (the Spaniards), that they could not come to any con- 
clusion without consulting the two Englishmen and the rest; 
but, however, they would go to them and discourse about it, 
and they should know in half an hour. It may be guessed 
that they were very hard put to it ; for, it seems, as they 
were to wait this half-hour for an answer, they begged they 
would send them out some bread in the meantime, which 



262 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

they did ; sending, at the same time, a large piece of goat's 
flesh, and a boiled parrot, which they ate very heartily, for 
they were hungry enough. 

After half an hour's consultation, they were called in, and 
a long debate ensued ; their two countrymen charging them 
with the ruin of all their labour, and a design to murder 
them; all which they owned before, and therefore could not 
deny now. Upon the whole, the Spaniards acted the mode- 
rators between them ; and as they had obliged the two 
Englishmen not to hurt the three while they were naked and 
unarmed, so they now obliged the three to go and rebuild. 
their fellows' two huts, one to be of the same, and the other 
of larger, dimensions than they were before; to fence their 
ground again where they had pulled up their fences, plant 
trees in the room of those pulled up, dig up the land again, 
for planting corn, where they had spoiled it, and to restore 
everything to the same state as they found it, as near as they 
could. 

Well, they submitted to all this ; and as they had plenty 
of provisions given them all the while, they grew very orderly,, 
and the whole society began to live pleasantly and agreeably 
together again; only that these three fellows could never be 
persuaded to work for themselves, except now and then a, 
little, just as they pleased. However, the Spaniards told 
them plainly, that if they would but live sociably and friendly 
together, and study the good of the whole plantation, they 
would be content to work for them, and let them walk about 
and be as idle as they pleased : and thus, having lived pretty 
well together for a month or two, the Spaniards gave them 
arms again, and gave them liberty to go abroad with them 
as before. 

It was not above a week after they had these arms, and 
went abroad, before the ungrateful creatures began to be as 
insolent and troublesome as ever; but, however, an accident 
happened presently upon this, which endangered the safety 
of them ail, and they were obliged to lay by all private re- 
sentments, and look to the preservation of their lives. 

One night two of the Spaniards went out, to go up to 
the top of the hill, where I used to go; and were going 
round through the grove, unconcerned and unwary, when 
they were surprised with seeing a light of fire a as very 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 203 

little way off from them, and hearing the voices of men — not 
of one or two, but of a great number. 

We need not doubt but that they were surprised with this 
sight, ran back immediately and raised their fellows, giving 
them an account of the imminent danger they were all in ; 
but it was impossible to persuade them to stay close within 
where they were, but they must all run out to see how things 
stood. 

The Spaniards were in no small consternation at this sight ; 
and, as they found that the fellows ran straggling all over the 
shore, they made no doubt but, first or last, some of them 
would chop in upon their habitation, or upon some other 
place where they would see the token of inhabitants ; and 
they were in great perplexity also for fear of their flock of 
goats, which would have been little less than starving them, 
if they should have been destroyed ; so the first thing they 
resolved upon was to despatch three men away before it was 
light, to drive all the goats away to the great valley where 
the cave was, and, if need were, to drive them into the very 
cave itself. Could they have seen the savages altogether in 
one body, at a distance from their canoes, they resolved, if 
there had been a hundred of them, to have attacked them; 
but that could not be obtained ; for they were some of them 
two miles off from the other ; and, as it appeared afterwards, 
were of two different nations. 

After having mused a great while on the course they 
should take, they resolved, at last, while it was still dark, to 
send Friday's father out as a spy, to learn, if possible, some- 
thing concerning them, what they came for, what they in- 
tended to do, and the like. The old man readily undertook 
it ; and stripping himself quite naked, as most of the savages 
were, away he went. After he had been gone an hour or 
two, he brings word that he had been among them undis- 
covered, — that he found they were two parties, and of two 
several nations, who had war with one another, and had a 
great battle in their own country ; and that both sides having 
had several prisoners taken in the fight, they were, by mere 
chance, landed all on the same island, for the devouring their 
prisoners and making merry, but their coming so by chance 
to the same place had spoiled all their mirth, — that they 
were in a great rage at one another, and were so near, that 



2G4 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

he believed they would fight again as soon as daylight began 
to appear; but he did not perceive that they had any notion 
of anybody being on the island but themselves. He had 
hardly made an end of telling his story, when they could per- 
ceive, by the unusual noise they made, that the two little 
armies were engaged in a bloody fight. 

Friday's father used all the arguments he could to persuade 
our people to lie close, and not be seen ; he told them their 
safety consisted in it, and that they had nothing to do but 
lie still, and the savages would kill one another to their 
hands, and then the rest would go away ; and it was so to a 
tittle. But it was impossible to prevail, especially upon the 
Englishmen ; their curiosity was so importunate, that they 
must run out and see the battle ; however, they used some 
caution, too ; they did not go openly, just by their own 
dwelling, but went farther into the woods, and placed them- 
selves to advantage, where they might securely see them 
manage the fight, and, as they thought, not be seen by them; 
but it seems the savages did see them, as we shall find here- 
after 

The battle was very fierce ; and, if I might believe the 
Englishmen, one of them said he could perceive that some of 
them were men of great bravery, of invincible spirits, and of 
great policy in guiding the fight. The battle, they said, held 
two hours before they could guess which party would be 
beaten ; but then that party which was nearest our people's 
habitation began to appear weakest, and after some time more 
some of them began to fly ; and this put our men again into 
a great consternation, lest any one of those that fled shoidd 
run into the grove before their dwelling for shelter, and 
thereby involuntarily discover the place ; and that, by con- 
sequence, the pursuers would do the like in search of them. 
Upon this, they resolved that they would stand armed within 
the Avail, and whoever came into the grove, they resolved to 
sally out over the wall and kill them, so that, if possible, not 
one should return to give an account of it ; they ordered also 
that it should be done with their swords, or by knocking 
them down with the stocks of their muskets, out not by 
shooting them, for fear of raising an alarm by the noise. 

As they expected it fell out; three of the routed army fled 
for life, and crossing the creek, ran directly into the place, 



EOBINSON CRUSOE. 



265 



not. in the least knowing whither they went, but running 
as into a thick wood for shelter. The scout they kept to 
look abroad gave notice of this within, with this addition, to 

that the conquerors had 



our men's great satisfaction — viz., 




not pursued them, or seen which way they were gone; 
upon this, the Spaniard governor would not suffer them to 
kill the three fugitives, but sending three men out, ordered 
them to go round, come in behind them, and surprise and 
take them prisoners ; which was done. The residue of the 
oonquered people fled to their canoes, and got off to sea ; 



266 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

the victors retired, made no pursuit, or very little, but draw- 
ing themselves into a body together, gave two great screaming 
shouts, which they supposed was by way of triumph — and so 
the fight ended ; and the same day, about three o'clock in 
the afternoon, they also marched to their canoes. And thus 
the Spaniards had the island again free to themselves, their 
fright was over, and they saw no more savages for several 
years after. 

After they were all gone, the Spaniards came out of their 
den, and viewing the field of battle, they found about two- 
and-thirty men dead on the spot; some were killed with 
great long arrows, some of which, were found sticking iD their 
bodies; but most of them were killed with great wooden 
swords, sixteen or seventeeniof which they found in the field 
of battle, and as many bows,, wiliL a. great many arrows. 
These swords were stemge^. great unwieldy things, and they 
must be very strong men. that used thenr: most of those men 
that were'liilledi with them had! their brains knocked out, and 
several their arms and legs broken ; so.tiliafcit is evident they 
fight Avith inexpressible rage and; fury;. We found not one 
man- that was not stone dead,: — for eiliiar they stay by their 
enemy till they- have kiilfid hirm, or they carry all the wounded 
men that are not quite dead away with them. 

This deliverance tamed our Englishmen for a. great while; 
the sight had fillfed them with horror, and the consequences 
appeared terrible to the last degree, especially upon supposing 
that some time or other they should fall into the hands of 
those creatures, who would not only kill 1 them as enemies, 
but kill them for food, as we kill que cattle ; and they pro- 
fessed to me that the thoughts of being eaten up like beef or 
mutton, though it was supposed it was not to be till they were 
dead, had something in it so horrible that it nauseated their 
very stomachs, made them sick when they thought of it, and 
filled their minds with such unusual terror, that they were not 
themselves for some weeks after. This, as I said, tamed even 
the three English brutes I have been speaking of; and for a 
great while after they were tractable, and went about the 
common business of the whole society well enough. But 
some time after this they fell into such simple measures again,, 
as brought them into a great deal of trouble. 

They had taken three prisoners, as I observed ; and these 



KOBINSON CRUSOE. 267 

three being lusty, stout young fellows, they made them servants, 
and tanght them to work for them ; and as slaves they did 
well enough ; but they did not take their measures with them 
as I did by my man Friday — viz., to begin with them upon the- 
principle of having saved their lives, and then instruct them 
in the rational principles of life, much less of religion, — 
civilising and reducing them by kind usage and affectionate 
arguments ; but as they gave them their food every day, so 
they gave them their work too, and kept them fully employed 
in drudgery enough ; but they failed in this by it, that they 
never had them to assist them and fight for them as I had my 
man Friday, who was as true to me as the very flesh upon 
my bones. 

But to come to the family part. Being all now good 
friends, for common danger, as I said above, had effectually 
reconciled them, they began to consider their general cir- 
cumstances; and the first thing that came under conside- 
ration was whether, seeing the savages particularly haunted 
that side of the island, and that there were more remote and 
retired parts of it equally adapted to their way of living, and 
manifestly to their advantage, they should not rather move 
their habitation, and plant in some more proper place for 
their safety, and especially for the security of their cattle and 
corn. 

Upon this, after long debate, it was concluded that they 
would not remove their habitation ; because that, sometime 
or other, they thought they might hear from their governor 
again, meaning me ; and if I should send any one to seek 
them, I should be sure to direct them to that side, where, if 
they should find the place demolished, they would conclude 
the savages had killed us all, and we were gone, and so our 
supply would go too. But as to their corn and cattle, they 
agreed to remove them into the valley where my cave was, 
where the land was as proper for both, and where, indeed, 
there was land enough ; however, upon second thoughts,, they 
altered one part of their resolution too, and resolved only to 
remove part of their cattle thither, and plant part of their 
corn there; and so, if one part was destroyed, the other 
might be saved. And one part of prudence they used, which 
it was very well they did — that they never trusted those 
three savages which they had made prisoners with knowing 



2'GS KOBINSON CRUSOE. 

anything of the plantation they had made in that valley, or 
of any cattle they had there, much less of the cave there, 
which they kept, in case of necessity, as a safe retreat ; and 
thither they carried also the two barrels of powder which I 
had sent them at my coming away. But, however, they re- 
solved not to change their habitation ; yet they agreed, that 
as I had carefully covered it first with a wall or fortification, 
and then with a grove of trees, so seeing their safety con- 
sisted entirely in their being concealed, of which they were 
now fully convinced, they set to work to cover and conceal 
the place yet more effectually than before. For this purpose, 
as I planted trees, or rather thrust in stakes, which in time 
all grew up to be trees, for some good distance before the 
entrance into my apartments, they went on in the same 
manner, and filled up the rest of that whole space of ground 
from the trees I had set quite down to the side of the creek, 
where, as I said, I landed my floats, and even into the very 
ooze where the tide flowed, not so much as leaving any place 
to land, or any sign that there had been any landing there- 
abouts, — these stakes also being of a wood forward to grow, 
as I have noted formerly, they took care to have them gene- 
rally much larger and taller than those which I had planted ; 
and as they grew apace, so they planted them so very thick 
and close together, that when they had been three or four 
years grown, there was no piercing with the eye any con- 
siderable way into the plantation ; and as for that part which 
I had planted, the trees were grown as thick as a man's thigh, 
and among them they placed so many other short ones, and 
so thick, that, in a word, it stood like a palisado a quarter of 
a mile thick, and it was next to impossible to penetrate it, 
but with a little army to cut it all down, — for a little dog 
could hardly get between the trees, they stood so close. 

But this was not all ; for they did the same by all the 
ground to the right hand and to the left, and round even to 
the side of the hill, leaving no way, not so much as for them- 
selves, to come out but by the ladder placed up to the side 
of the hill, and then lifted up, and placed again from the first 
stage up to the top ; and when the ladder was taken down, 
nothing but what had wings or witchcraft to assist it could 
come at them. This was excellently well contrived ; nor was 
it less than what they afterwards found occasion for. 



KOBINSON CRUSOE. 269 

They lived two years after this in perfect retirement, and 
had no more visits from the savages. They had, indeed, an 
alarm given them one morning, which put them into a great 
consternation ; for, some of the Spaniards being out early one 
morning on the west side, or rather end, of the island (which 
was that end where I never went, for fear of being discovered), 
they were surprised with seeing above twenty canoes of 
Indians just coming on shore. They made the best of their 
way home in hurry enough ; and giving the alarm to their 
comrades, they kept close all that day and the next, going 
out only at night to make their observation ; but they had 
the good luck to be mistaken ; ibr wherever the savages went, 
they did not land that time on the island, but pursued some 
other design. 

And now they had another broil with the three Englishmen ; 
one of whom, a most turbulent fellow, being in a rage at one 
of the three slaves, whom I mentioned they had taken, because 
the fellow had not done something: right which he bid hiru 
do, and seemed a little untractable in his showing him, drew 
a hatchet out of a frog-belt, in which he wore it by his side, 
and fell upon the poor savage, not to correct him, but to kill 
him. One of the Spaniards, who was by, seeing him give the 
fellow a barbarous cut with the hatchet, which he aimed at his 
head, but struck into his shoulder, so that he thought he had 
cut the poor creature's arm off, ran to him, and entreating 
him not to murder the poor man, placed himself between 
him and the savage to prevent the mischief. The fellow, 
being enraged the more at this, struck at the Spaniard with 
his hatchet, and swore he would serve him as he intended to 
serve the savage ; which the Spaniard perceiving, avoided the 
blow, and, with a shovel which he had in his hand, knocked 
the brute down. Another of the Englishmen, running at the 
same time to help his comrade, knocked the Spaniard down ; 
and then two Spaniards more came in to help their man, and 
a third Englishman fell in upon them. They had none of 
them any lire-arms or any other weapons but hatchets and 
other tools, except this third Englishman ; he had one of my 
rusty cutlasses, with which he made at the two last Spaniards, 
and wounded them both. This fray set the whole family in 
an uproar, and more help coming in, they took the three 
Englishmen prisoners. The next question was, what should 



270 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

be done with them ? They had been so often mutinous, and 
were so very furious, so desperate, and so idle withal, they 
knew not what course to take with them, for they were mis- 
chievous to the highest degree, and cared not what hurt they 
did to any man ; so that, in short, it was not safe to live with 
them. 

The Spaniard who was governor told them, in so many 
■words, that if they had been of his own country, he would 
have hanged them ; for all laws and all governors were to 
preserve society, and those who were dangerous to the society 
ought to be expelled out of it ; but as they were Englishmen, 
and that it was to the generous kindness of an Englishman 
that they all owed their preservation and deliverance, he would 
use them with all possible lenity, and would leave them to 
the judgment of the other two Englishmen who were their 
countrymen: 

One of the two honest Englishmen stood up, and said they 
desired it might not be left to them. " For," says he, " I am 
sure we ought to sentence them to the gallows ;" and with 
that he gives an account how Will Atkins, one of the three, 
had proposed to have all the five Englishmen join together, 
and murder all the Spaniards when they were in their sleep. 

When the Spanish governor heard this, he calls to Will 
Atkins, "How, Seignior Atkins, would you murder us all? 
What have you to say to that ?" The hardened villain was 
so far from denying it, that he said it was true, and swore 
they would do it still before they had done with them. 
"Well, but Seignior Atkins," says the Spaniard, "what have 
we done to you that you will kill us ? And what would you 
get by killing us ? And what must we do to prevent your 
killing us ? Must we kill you, or you kill us ? Why will 
you put us to the necessity of this, Seignior Atkins ?" says 
the Spaniard very calmly, and smiling. Seignior Atkins was 
in such a rage at the Spaniard making a jest of it, that had 
he not been held by three men, and withal had no weapon 
near him, it was thought he would have attempted to have 
killed the Spaniard in the middle of all the company. This 
hair-brain carriage obliged them to consider seriously what 
was to be done ; the two Englishmen, and the Spaniard who 
saved the poor savage, were of the opinion that they should 
hang one of the three, for an example to the rest, and that 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 271 

particularly it should be he that had twice attempted to 
commit murder with his hatchet. But the governor Spaniard 
still said no ; it was an Englishman that had saved all their 
lives, and he would never consent to put an Englishman to 
death, though he had murdered half of them — nay, he said 
if he had been killed himself by an Englishman, and had 
time left to speak, it should be that they should pardon 
him. 

This was so positively insisted on by the governor Spaniard, 
that there was no gainsaying it ; and as merciful counsels are 
most apt to prevail, where they are so earnestly pressed, so 
they all came into it ; but then it was to be considered what 
should be done to keep them from doing the mischief they de- 
signed ; for all agreed that means were to be used for pre- 
serving the society from danger. After a long debate,' it was 
agreed, first, that they should be disarmed, and not permitted 
to have either gun, powder, shot, sword, or any weapon ; and 
should be turned out of the society, and left to live where 
they would, and how they would by themselves: but that 
none of the rest, either Spaniards or English, should converse 
with them, speak with them, or have anything to do with 
them : that they should be forbid to come within a certain 
distance of the place where the rest dwelt ; and if they offered 
to commit any disorder, so as to spoil, burn, kill, or destroy 
any of the corn, plantings, buildings, fences, or cattle, belong- 
ing to the society, they should die without mercy, and they 
would shoot them wherever they could find them. 

The governor, a man of great humanity, musing upon the 
sentence, considered a little upon it ; and turning to the two 
honest Englishmen, said, " Hold ; you must reflect that it will 
be long ere they can raise corn and cattle of their own, and 
they must not starve; we must therefore allow them pro- 
visions." So he caused to be added, that they should have a 
proportion of corn given them to last them eight months, and 
for seed to sow, by which time they might be supposed to 
raise some of their own ; that they should have six milch- 
goats, four he-goats, and six kids given them, as well for 
present subsistence as for a store ; and that they should have 
tools given them for their work in the fields, such as six 
hatchets, an adze, a saw, and the like ; but they should have 
none of these tools or provisions, unless they would swear 



272 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

solemnly that they would not hurt or injure any of the 
Spaniards with them, or of their fellow Englishmen. 

Thus they dismissed them the society, and turned them out 
to shift for themselves. They went away sullen and refractory, 
as neither content to go away nor to stay ; but, as there was 
no remedy, they went, pretending to go and choose a place 
where they would settle themselves ; and some provisions 
were given them, but no weapons. 

About four or five days after, they came again for some 
victuals, and gave the governor an account where they had 
pitched their tents, and marked themselves out a habitation 
and plantation ; and it was a very convenient place, indeed, 
on the remotest part of the island, N.E., much about the place 
where I providentially landed in my first voyage, when I was 
driven out to sea, the Lord knows whither, in my foolish 
attempt to sail round the island. 

Here they built themselves two handsome huts, and con- 
trived them in a manner like my first habitation, being close 
under the side of a hill, having some trees growing already on 
three sides of it, so that by planting others, it would be very 
easily covered from the sight, unless narrowly searched for. 
They desired some dried goat-skins, for beds and covering, 
which were given them ; and upon giving their words that 
they would not disturb the rest, or injure any of their planta- 
tions, they gave them hatchets, and what other tools they 
could spare ; some pease, barley, and rice, for sowing ; and 
anything they wanted, except arms and ammunition. 

They lived in this separate condition about six months, and 
had got in their first harvest, though the quantity was but 
small, the parcel of land they had planted being but little; 
for having all their plantation to form, they had a great deal 
of work upon their hands ; and when they came to make 
boards and pots, and such things, they were quite out of their 
element, and could make nothing of it : and when the rainy 
season came on, for want of a cave in the earth, they could 
not keep their grain dry, and it was in great danger of 
spoiling ; and this humbled them much : so they came and 
begged the Spaniards to help them, which they very readily 
did ; and in four days worked a great hole in the side of the 
hill for them, big enough to secure their corn and other things 
from the rain ; but it was a poor place, at best, compared 



ROBINSON CKUSOE. 



273 



to mine, and especially as mine was then, for the Spaniards 
had greatly enlarged it, and made several new apartments 
in it. 

About three quarters of a year after this separation, these 




rogues took a new frolic, which, together with the former 
villany they had committed, brought mischief enough upon 
them, and had very near been the ruin of the whole colony. 
The three new associates began, it seems, to be weary of the 
laborious life they led, and that without hope of bettering 
their circumstances ; and a whim took them that they would 
18 



274 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

make a voyage to the continent, from whence the savages 
came, and would try if they could seize upon some prisoners 
among the natives there, and bring them home, so as to make 
them do the laborious part of the work for them. 

The project was not so preposterous, if they had gone no 
farther. But they did nothing, and proposed nothing, but 
had either mischief in the design, or mischief in the event. 

The three fellows came down to the Spaniards one morn- 
ing, and in very humble terms desired to be admitted to 
speak with them. The Spaniards very readily heard what they 
had to say, which was this : — that they were tired of living 
in the manner they did : and that they were not handy 
enough to make the necessaries they wanted, and that having 
no help, they found they should be starved ; but if the 
Spaniards would give them leave to take one of the canoes 
which they came over in, and give them arms and ammuni- 
tion proportioned to their defence, they would go over to 
the main and seek their fortunes, and so deliver them from 
the trouble of supplying them with any other provisions. 

The Spaniards were glad enough to get rid of them, but 
very honestly represented to them the certain destruction 
they were running into ; told them they had suffered such 
hardships upon that very spot, they could, without any spirit 
of prophecy, tell them they would be starved or murdered ; 
and bade them consider of it. 

The men replied audaciously, they should be starved if they 
stayed here, for they could not and would not work, and they 
could but be starved abroad; and if they vrere murdered, there 
was an end of them ; they had no wives or children to cry 
after them ; and insisted importunately upon their demand ; 
declaring they would go, whether they gave them any arms 
or no. 

The Spaniards told them, with great kindness, that if 
they were resolved to go, they should not go like naked 
men, and be m no condition to defend themselves, and 
that though they could ill spare their fire-arms, having not 
enough for themselves, yet they would let them have two 
muskets, a pistol, and a cutlass, and each man a hatchet, 
which they thought was sufficient for them. They ac- 
cepted the offer : and having baked bread enoujrh to serve 
them a month, and given them as much goats'-flesh as they 
could er.t ::_ ::" '.'. :r: ' ' asket of dried

grapes, a pot of fresh -water, and a young kid alive, they 
boldly set out in the canoe for a voyage over the sea, where it 
was at least forty miles broad. 

The boat was a large one, and would very well have car- 
ried fifteen or twenty men, and therefore was rather too big 
for them to manage ; but as they had a fair breeze, and flood- 
tide with them, they did well enough. They had made a 
mast of a long pole, and a sail of four large goat-skins dried, 
which they had sewed or laced together ; and away they 
went merrily enough. The Spaniards called after them, 
" Bon voyago ;" and no man ever thought of seeing them any 
more. 

The Spaniards were often saying to one another, and to 
the two honest Englishmen who remained behind, how quietly 
and comfortably they lived, now these three turbulent fellows 
were gone. As for their coming again, that was the remotest 
thing from their thoughts that could be imagined ; when, be- 
hold, after two-and-twenty days' absence, one of the English- 
men, being abroad upon his planting work, sees three strange 
men coming towards him from a distance, with guns upon 
their shoulders. 

Away runs the Englishman, as if he was bewitched, comes 
frightened and amazed to the governor Spaniard, and tells 
him they were all undone, for there were strangers upon the 
island, but could not tell who they were. The Spaniard, 
pausing a while, says to him, " How do you mean, you cannot 
tell who ? They are the savages, to be sure." " No, no," 
says the Englishman ; " they are men in clothes, with arms." 
"Nay, then," says the Spaniard, "why are you so concerned? 
If they are not savages, they must be friends ; for there is no 
Christian nation upon earth but will do us good rather than 
harm." 

While they were debating thus, came the three English- 
men, and, standing without the wood, which was new planted, 
hallooed to them. They presently knew their voices, and so 
all the wonder ceased. But now the admiration was turned 
upon another question : — what could be the matter, and 
what made them come back a sain? 

It was not long before they brought the men in, and in- 
quiring where they had been, and what they had been doing, 
they gave them a full account of their voyage in a few words; 
— thpt tUo 1---1 «' • ' • ;;; v „, . ,_., some thing less; 



276 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

but finding the people alarmed at their coming, and preparing 
with bows and arrows to fight them, they durst not go on 
shore, but sailed on to the northward six or seven hours, til 
they came to a great opening, by which they perceived that 
the land they saw from our island was not the main, but an 
island ; upon entering that opening of the sea, they saw 
another island on the right hand, north, and several more 
west ; and being resolved to land somewhere, they put over 
to one of the islands which lay west, and went boldly on 
shore : that they found the people very courteous and friendly 
to them ; and that they gave several roots and some dried 
fish, and appeared very sociable ; and the women, as well as 
the men, were very forward to supply them with anything 
they could get for them to eat, and brought it to them a great 
way upon their heads. 

They continued here four days ; and inquired, as well as 
they could of them, by signs, what nations were this way, and 
that way ; and were told of several fierce and terrible people 
that lived almost every way, who, as they made known by 
signs to them, used to eat men ; but as for themselves, they 
said, they never ate men or women, except only such as they 
took in the wars ; and then, they owned, they made a great 
feast, and ate their prisoners. 

The Englishmen seemed mighty desirous of seeing some of 
their prisoners ; but the others mistaking them, thought they 
were desirous to have some of them to carry away for their 
own eating. So they beckoned to them, pointing to the 
setting of the sun, and then to the rising ; which was to 
signify that the next morning at sunrising they would bring 
some for them; and, accordingly, the next morning they 
brought down five women and eleven men, and gave them to 
the Englishmen, to carry with them on their voyage, just as 
we would bring so many cows and oxen down to a seaport 
town to victual a ship. 

As brutish and barbarous as these fellows were at home, 
their stomachs turned at this sight, and they did not know 
what to do. To refuse the prisoners would have been the 
highest affront to the savage gentry that could be offered 
them, and what to do with them they knew not. However, 
after some debate, they resolved to accept of them ; and, in 
return, they gave the .savages that brought them one of their 



EOKINSON CRUSOE. 277 

hatchets, an old key, a knife, and six or seven of their bullets ; 
which, though they did not understand their use, they seemed 
particularly pleased with ; and then tying the poor creatures' 
hands behind them, they dragged the prisoners into the boat 
for our men. 

In their voyage, they endeavoured to have some com- 
munication with their prisoners ; but it was impossible to 
make them understand anything. Nothing they could say 
to them, or give them, or do for them, but was looked upon 
as going to murder them. They first of all unbound them ; 
but the poor creatures screamed at that, especially the women, 
as if they had just felt the knife at their throats ; for they 
immediately concluded they were unbound on purpose to be 
killed. If they gave them anything to eat, it was the same 
thing ; they then concluded it was for fear they should sink 
in flesh, and so not be fat enough to kill. If they looked at 
one of them more particularly, the party presently concluded 
it was to see whether he or she was fattest, and fittest to kill 
first ; nay, after they had brought them quite over, and began 
to use them kindly, and treat them well, they expected every 
day to make a dinner or supper for their captors. 

When these three wanderers had given this unaccountable 
history of their voyage, the Spaniard asked them where their 
new family was ; and being told that they had brought them 
on shore, and put them into one of their huts, and were come 
up to beg some victuals for them, the whole colony resolved 
to go all down to the place and see them ; and did so, and 
Friday's father with them. 

When they came into the hut, there they sat, all bound ; 
for when they had brought them on shore, they bound their 
hands, that they might not take the boat and make their 
escape ; there, I say, they sat, all of them stark naked. First, 
there were three men, lusty, comely fellows, well shaped, 
straight and fair limbs, about thirty to thirty-five years of 
age ; and five women, whereof two might be from thirty to 
forty ; two more not above four or five-and-twenty ; and the 
fifth, a tall, comely maiden, about sixteen or seventeen. The 
women were well-favoured, agreeable persons, both in shape 
and features, only tawny ; and two of them, had they been 
perfect white, would have passed for very handsome women, 
even in London itself, having pleasant, agreeable countenances, 



278 ROBIXSOX cuusos. 

and of a very modest behaviour ; especially when they came 
afterwards to be dressed, though that dress was very in- 
different, it must be confessed. 

The governor, who found that the having women among 
them would presently be attended with some inconvenience, and 
might occasion some strife, and perhaps blood, asked the three 
men what they intended to do with these women, and how 
they intended to use them, whether as servants or as wives ? 
One of the Englishmen answered very boldly and readily, 
that they would use them as both ; to which the governor 
said, "I am not going to restrain you from it; you are your 
own masters as to that; but this I think is but just, for 
avoiding disorders and quarrels among you, and I desire it of 
you for that reason only, viz. : — That you will all engage, 
that if any of you take any of these women as a wife, that he 
shall take but one ; and that having taken one, none else 
shall touch her ; for though we cannot marry any one of you, 
yet it is but reasonable that, while you stay here, the woman 
any of you takes shall be maintained by the man that takes 
her, and should be his wife ; I mean," says he. '• while he 
continues here, and that none else shall have anything to do 
with her." All this appeared so just, that every one agreed 
to it without any difficulty. 

Then the Englishman asked the Spaniards if they designed 
to take any of them ? But every one of them answered 
" No :" some of them said they had wives in Spain, and the 
others did not like women that were not Christians ; to be 
short, the five Englishmen took them every one a wife, and so 
they set up a new form of living : for the Spaniards and Fri- 
day's father lived in my old habitation, which they had en- 
larged exceedingly within. The three servants which were 
taken in the last battle of the savages lived with them : and 
these carried on the main part of the colony, supplied the 
rest with food, and assisted them in anything as they could, 
or as they found necessity required. 

But the wonder of the story was, how five such refractory, 
ill-matched fellows should agree about these women, and that 
two of them should not choose the same woman, especially 
seeing two or three of them were, without comparison, more 
agreeable than the others : but they took a good way enough 
to prevent quarrelling among themselves ; for they set the 



KOBINSON CRUSOE. 279 

five women by themselves in one of their huts, and they went 
all into the other hut, and drew lots among them who should 
choose first. 

He that drew to choose first went away by himself to the 
hut where the poor naked creatures were, and fetched out 
her he chose : and it was worth observing, that he that chose 
first took her that was reckoned the homeliest and oldest of 
the five, which made mirth enough among the rest ; and even 
the Spaniards laughed at it : but the fellow considered better 
than any of them, that it was application and business they 
were to expec! assistance in, as much as in anything else : 
and she proved the best wife of all the parcel. 

When the poor women saw themselves set in a row thus, 
and fetched out one by one, the terrors of their condition re- 
turned upon them again, and they firmly believed they were 
now going to be devoured. Accordingly, when the English 
sailor came in and fetched out one of them, the rest set up a 
most lamentable cry, and hung about her, and took their 
have of her with such agonies and affection as would have 
grieved the hardest heart in the world ; nor was it possible 
for the Englishmen to satisfy them that they were not to be 
immediately murdered, till they fetched the old man, Friday's 
father, who immediately let them know that the five men, 
who were to fetch them out one by one, had chosen them for 
their wives. 

When they had done, and the fright the women were in 
was a little over, the men went to work, and the Spaniards 
came and helped them ; and in a few hours they had built 
them every one a new hut or tent for their lodging apart ; 
for those they had already were crowded with their tools, 
household stuff, and provisions. The three wicked ones had 
pitched farthest off, and the two honest ones nearer, but both 
on the north shore of the island, so that they continued 
separated as before : and thus my island was peopled in three 
places : and, as I might say, three towns were begun to be 
built. 

But I now come to a scene different from all that had hap- 
pened before, either to them or to me ; and the origin of the 
story was this : — Early one morning, there came on shore five 
or six canoes of Indians, and there is no room to doubt they 
came upon the old errand of feeding upon their slaves ; but 



280 EOBINSON CRUSOE. 

that part was now so familiar to the Spaniards, and to our 
men too, that they did not concern themselves about it, as I 
did : but having been made sensible, by their experience, 
that their only business was to lie concealed, and that if they 
were not seen by any of the savages, they would go off 
again quietly, when their business was done, having, as yet, 
not the least notion of there being any inhabitants in the 
island ; they had nothing to do but give notice to all the three 
plantations to keep within doors, and not show themselves, 
only placing a scout in a proper place, to gi,ve notice when 
the boats went to sea again. 

This was, without doubt, very right ; but a disaster spoiled 
all these measures, and made it known among the savages 
that there were inhabitants there ; which was, in the end, the 
desolation of almost the whole colony. After the canoes with 
the savages had gone off, the Spaniards peeped abroad again ; 
and some of them had the curiosity to go to the place where 
they had been, to see what they had been doing. Here, to 
their great surprise, they found three savages left behind, and 
lying fast asleep upon the ground. 

The Spaniards were greatly surprised at this sight, and 
perfectly at a loss what to do. The Spanish governor, as it 
happened, was with them, and his advice was asked, but he 
professed he knew not what to do. As for slaves, they had 
enough already ; and as to killing them, there were none ot 
them inclined to do that. After some consultation, they re- 
solved upon this ; that they would lie still a while longer, 
till, if possible, these three men might be gone. But then 
the governor Spaniard recollected that the three savages had 
no boat ; and if they were left to rove about the island, they 
would certainly discover that there were inhabitants in it ; 
and so they would be undone that way. Upon this, they 
ivvent back again, and there lay the fellows fast asleep still, 
.•and so they resolved to awaken them, and take them prisoners, 
.and they did so. The poor fellows were strangely frightened 
when they were seized upon and bound ; and afraid, like the 
women, that they should be murdered and eaten. 

It was very happy for them that they did not carry them 
home to their castle ; but they carried them first to the 
bower, and afterwards they carried them tu the habitation of 
the two Englishmen. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 



281 



Here they were set to work, though it was not much they 
had for them to do ; and whether it was by negligence in 
guarding them, or that they thought the fellows could not 
mend themselves, I know not, but one of them ran away 




and taking to the woods, they could never hear of him any 



more. 



They had good reason to believe he got home again soon 
after in some other canoes of savages who came on shore 
three or four weeks afterwards ; and who, carrying on their 



282 EOBINSON CEUSOE. 

revels as usual, went off in two days' time. This thought 
terrified them exceedingly : for they concluded, and that not 
without good cause indeed, that if this fellow got home safe 
among his comrades, he would certainly give them an account 
that there were people in the. island, and also how few and 
weak they were ; for this savage, as observed before, had 
never been told, and it was very happy he had not, how 
many there were, or where they lived ; nor had he ever seen 
or heard the fire of any of their guns, much less had they 
shown him any of their other retired places ; such as the 
cave in the valley, or the new retreat which the two English- 
men had made, and the like. 

About two months after this, six canoes of savages, with 
about ten men in a canoe, came rowing along the north side 
of the island, where they never used to come before, and 
landed, about an hour after sunrise, at a convenient place, 
about a mile from the habitation of the two Englishmen, 
where this escaped man had been kept. As the Spaniard 
governor said, had ithey been all (there, the damage would 
not have been so much, for not a man of them would have 
escaped : but the case differed now very much, for two men 
to fifty was too much odds. The two men had the happiness 
to discover them about a league off, so that it was above an 
hour before they landed ; and as they landed a mile from 
their brats, it was some time before they could come at them. 
Now, having great reason to believe they were betrayed, the 
first thing they did was to bind the two slaves which were 
left, and cause two of the three men whom they brought 
with the women to lead them, with their two wives, and 
whatever they could carry away with them, to their retired 
places in the woods, and there to bind the two fellows hand 
and foot till they heard farther. 

In the next place, seeing the savages were all come on 
shore, and that they had bent their course directly that way, 
they opened the fences where the milch-cows were kept, and 
drove them all out ; leaving their goats to straggle in the 
woods, whither they pleased, that the savages might think 
they were all bred wild ; but the rogue who came with them 
was too cunning for that, and he gave them an account of it 
all, for they went directly to the place. 

When the two poor frightened men had secured their 



o 



EOEIXSOX CKUSOE. 233 

wives and goods, they sent the other slave they had of the 
three who came with the women, away to the Spaniards with 
all speed, to give them the alarm, and desire speedy help, 
and, in the meantime, they took their arms, and what ammu- 
nition they had, and retreated towards the .place in the wood 
where their wives were sent ; keeping at a distance, yet so 
that they might see, if possible, which way the savages took. 

They had not gone far, but that from a rising ground they 
could see a little army of their enemies come on directly to 
their habitation, and, in a moment more, could see all their 
huts and household stuff flaming up together, to their great 
grief and mortification ; for they had a very great loss, to them 
irretrievable, at least for some time. They kept their station 
for a while, till they found the savages, like wild beasts, spread 
themselves all over the place, rummaging every way, and every 
place they could think of, in search of prey ; and in particular 
for the people, of whom, now, it plainly appeared they had 
intelligence. 

The two Englishmen seeing this, thinking themselves not 
secure where they stood, because it was likely somo of the wild 
people might come that way, and they might come too many 
together, thought it proper to make another retreat about half 
a mile farther ; believing, as it afterwards happened, that the 
farther they strolled, the fewer would be together. 

Their next halt was at the entrance into a very thick-grown 
part of the woods, and where an old trunk of a tree stood, 
which was hollow and vastly large ; and in this tree they both 
took their standing, resolving to see there what might offer. 
They had not stood there long before two of the savages ap- 
peared running directly that way, as if ■ they had already had 
notice where they stood, and were coming up to attack them ; 
and a little way farther they espied three more coming after 
them, and five more beyond them, all coming the same way : 
besides which, they saw seven or eight more at a distance, 
running another waj\ 

The poor men were now in great perplexity whether they 
should stand or fly ; but, after a very short debate with them- 
selves they considered, that if the savages ranged the country 
thus before help came, they might perhaps find out their retreat 
■in the woods, and then all would be lost ; so they resolved to 
stand them there ; and if they were too many to deal with, 



284 ROBINSOX CRUSOE. 

then they would get up to the top of the tree, whence they 
doubted not to defend themselves, fire excepted, as long as 
their ammunition lasted, though all the savages that were 
landed, which was near fifty, were to attack them. 

Having resolved upon this, they next considered whether 
they should fire at the first two, or wait for the three, and so 
take the middle party, by which the two and the five that fol- 
lowed would be separated ; at length they resolved to let the 
first two pass by, unless they should spy them in the tree, and 
come to attack them. The first two savages confirmed them 
also in this regulation, by turning a little from them towards 
another part of the wood : but the three, and the five after 
them, came forward directly to the tree, as if they had known 
the Englishmen were there. Seeing them come so straight 
towards them, they resolved to take them in a line as they 
came : and as they resolved to fire but one at a time, perhaps 
the first shot might hit them all three ; for which purpose 
the man who was to fire put three or four small bullets into 
his piece; and having a fair loop-hole, as it were, from a 
broken hole in the tree, he took a sure aim, without being seen, 
waiting till they were within about thirty yards of the tree, 
so that he could not miss. 

While they were thus waiting, and the savages came on, 
they plainly saw that one of the three was the runaway savage 
that had escaped from them; and they both knew him dis- 
tinctly, and resolved that, if possible, he should not escape, 
though they should both fire : so the other stood ready with 
his piece, that if he did not drop at the first shot, he should 
be sure to have a second. But the first was too good a marks- 
man to miss his aim ; for as the savages kept near one another, 
a little behind in a line, he fired, and hit two of them directly : 
the foremost was killed outright, being shot in the head ; the 
second, which was the runaway Indian, was shot through the 
body and fell, but was not quite dead ; and the third had a 
little scratch in the shoulder, perhaps by the same ball that 
went through the body of the second ; and being dreadfully 
frightened, though not so much hurt, sat down upon the 
ground, screaming and yelling in a hideous manner. 

The five that were behind, more frightened with the noise 
than sensible of the danger, stood still at first ; for the woods 
made a sound a thousand times binder than it lvallv was. 



ROBIXSON CRUSOE. 285 

However, all being silent again, and they not knowing what 
the matter was, came on unconcerned, till they came to the 
place where their companions lay in a condition miserable 
enough : and here the poor ignorant creatures, not sensible 
that they were within reach of the same mischief, stood all 
together over the wounded man, talking, and, as may be sup- 
posed, inquiring of him, how he came to be hurt : and who, 
it is very rational to believe, told them, that a flash of fire first, 
and immediately after that thunder from their gods, had killed 
those two and wounded him. 

Our two men, though, as they confessed to me, it grieved 
them to be obliged to kill so many poor creatures, who, at the 
same time, had no notion of their danger ; yet, having them 
all thus in their power, and the first having loaded his piece 
again, resolved to let fly both together among them ; and 
singling out, by agreement, which to aim at, they shot toge- 
ther, and killed, or very much wounded, four of them ; the 
fifth, frightened even to death, though not hurt, fell with the 
rest ; so that our men, seeing them all fall together, thought 
they had killed them all. 

The belief that the savages were all killed, made our two 
men come boldly out from the tree before they had charged 
their guns, which was a wrong step ; and they were under 
some surprise when they came to the place, and found no less 
than four of them alive, and of them two very little hurt, and 
one not at all : this obliged them to fall upon them with the 
stocks of their muskets ; and first they made sure of the 
runaway savage, that had been the cause of all the mischief, 
and of another that was hurt in the knee, and put them out of 
their pain : then the man that was not hurt at all, came and 
kneeled down to them, with his two hands held up, and made 
piteous moans to them, by gestures and signs, for his life, but 
could not say one word to them that they could understand. 
However, they made signs to him to sit down at the foot of a 
tree hard by ; and one of the Englishmen, with a piece of rope 
twined, which he had by great chance in his pocket, tied his 
two hands behind him, and there they left him; and with 
what speed they could, made after the other two, which were 
gone before, fearing they, or any more of them, should find the 
way to their covered place in the woods, where their wives, 
and the few goods they had left lay. They came once in 



28G ROBIKSON CRUSOE. 

sight of the two men, but it was at a great distance ; however, 
they had the satisfaction to see them cross over a valley 
towards the sea, quite the contrary way from that which led to 
their retreat, which they were afraid of; and being satisfied 
with that, they went back to the tree where they left their 
prisoner, who, as they supposed, was delivered by his com- 
rades, for he was gone, and the two pieces of rope-yarn, with 
which they had bound him, lay just at the foot of the tree. 

They were now in as great concern as before, not knowing 
what course to take, or how near the enemy might be, or in 
what number ; so they resolved to go away to the place where 
their wives were, to see if all was well there, and to make them 
easy, who were in fright enough to be sure ; for though the 
savages were their own countrymen, yet they were most ter- 
ribly afraid of them, and perhaps the more for the knowledge 
they had of them. 

When they came there, they found the savages had been 
in the wood, and very near that place, but had not found it ; 
for it was indeed inaccessible, from the trees standing so 
thick, unless the persons seeking it had been directed by 
those that knew it, which these did not ; they found, there- 
fore, everything was safe, only the women in a terrible fright. 
While they were here, they had the comfort to have seven of 
the Spaniards come to their assistance ; the other ten, with 
their servants, and old Friday (I mean Friday's father), were 
gone in a body to defend their bower, and the corn and 
cattle that was kept there, in case the savages should have 
roved over to that side of the country ; but they did not 
spread so far. With the seven Spaniards came one of the 
three savages ; and with them also came the savage whom the 
Englishman had left bound hand and foot at the tree ; for it 
seems they came that way, saw the slaughter of the seven 
men, and unbound the eighth, and brought him along with 
them : where, however, they were obliged to bind him again, 
as they had the two others who were left when the third ran 
away. 

The prisoners now began to be a burden to them ; and 
they were so afraid of their escaping, that thev were once 
resolving to kill them all, believing they were under an abso- 
lute necessity to do so for their own preservation. However, 
the Spaniard governor would not consent to it ; but ordered, 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 



237 



for the present, that they should be sent out of the way, to 
my old cave in the valley, and be kept there, with two 
Spaniards to guard them, and give them food for their sub- 
sistence, which was done ; and they were bound there hand 
and foot for that night. 

When the Spaniards came, the two Englishmen were so 
encouraged, that they could not satisfy themselves to stay any 
longer there ; but taking five of the Spaniards and them- 
selves, with four muskets and a pistol among them, and two 
stout quarter staves, away they went in quest of the savages. 
And first they came to the tree where the men lay that had 
been killed ; but it was easy to see that some more of the 
savages had been there, for they had attempted to carry their 
dead men away, and had dragged two of them a good way, 
but had given it over. Thence they advanced to the first 
rising ground, where they had stood and s seen their camp 
destroyed, and where they had the mortification still to see 
some of the smoke ; but neither could they here see any of 
the savages. They then resolved, though with all possible 
caution, to go forward towards their ruined plantation ; but 
a little before they came thither, coming in sight of the sea- 
shore, they saw plainly the savages all embarked again in 
their canoes, in order to be gone. They seemed sorry at 
first, that there was no way to come at them, to give them 
a parting blow ; but, upon the whole, they were very well 
satisfied to be rid of them. 

The poor Englishmen being now twice ruined, and all their 
improvements destroyed, the rest all agreed to come and help 
them to rebuild, and assist them with needful supplies. Their 
three country men, who were not yet noted for having the 
least inclination to do any good, yet as soon as they heard of 
it, came and offered their help and assistance, and did, very 
friendly, work for some days to restore their habitation, and 
make necessaries for them. And thus, in a little time, they 
were set upon their legs again. 

About two days after this, they had the farther satisfaction 
of seeing three of the savages' canoes come driving on shore, 
and, at some distance from them, two drowned men : by 
which they had reason to believe that they had met with a 
storm at sea, which had overset some of them ; for it had 
blown very hard the night after they went off. 



288 KODINSON CRUSOE. 

However, as some might miscarry, so, on the othei 
hand, enough of them escaped to inform the rest, as well ol 
what they had done as what had happened to them, and tc 
whet them on to another enterprise of the same nature. 

It was five 1 or six months after this before they heard anj 
more of the savages, in which time our men had hopes thej 
had either forgot their former bad luck, or given over hopes 
of better ; when, on a sudden, they were invaded with a most 
formidable fleet of no less than eight-and-twenty canoes, full 
of savages, armed with bows and arrows, great clubs, wooden 
swords, and such like engines of war ; and they brought such 
numbers with them, that, in short, it put all our people into 
the utmost consternation. 

As they came on shore in the evening, and at the eastern- 
most side of the island, our men had that night to consult 
and consider what to do ; and, in the first place, knowing 
that their being entirely concealed was their only safety 
before, and would be much more so now, while the number 
of their enemies would be so great, they therefore resolved, 
first of all, to take down the huts which were built for the 
two Englishmen, and drive away their goats to the old cave ; 
because they supposed the savages would go directly thither, 
as soon as it was day, to play the old game over again, though 
they did not now land within two leagues of it. In the next 
place, they drove away all the flocks of goats they had at the 
old bower, as I called it, which belonged to the Spaniards ; 
and, in short, left as little appearance of inhabitants anywhere 
as was possible : and the next morning early they posted 
themselves, with all their force, at the plantation of the two 
men, to wait for their coming. As they guessed, so it hap- 
pened. These new invaders, leaving their canoes at the east 
end of the island, came ranging along the shore, directly 
towards the place, to the number of two hundred and fifty, 
as near as our men could judge. Our army was but small, 
indeed ; but that which was worse, they had not arms for all 
their number neither. The whole account, it seems stood 
thus : first, as to men, seventeen Spaniards, five Englishmen, 
Friday's father, the three slaves taken with the women, who 
proved very faithful, and three other slaves, who lived with 
the Spaniards. To arm these, they had eleven muskets, 



ItOBINSON CRUSOE. 



289 



five pistols, eight fowling-pieces, two swords, and three old 
halberts. 

To their slaves they did not give either musket or fusee, 
but they had each a halbert, or a long staff, like a quarter- 




staff, with a great spike of iron fastened into each end of it, 
and by his side a hatchet : also every one of our men had a 
hatchet. Two of the women could not be prevailed upon 
but they would come into the fight, and they had bows and 
arrows, which the Spaniards had taken from the savages when 
19 



290 ROBINSON CKUSCE. 

the first action happened, which I have spoken of, where tl 
Indians fought with one another : and the women had hatche 
too. 

The Spaniard governor commanded the whole : and W:' 
Atkins, who, though a dreadful fellow for wickedness, was 
most daring fellow, commanded under him. The savagi 
came forward like lions ; and our men, which was the wor 
of their fate, had no advantage in their situation ; only thi 
Will Atkins, who now proved a most useful fellow, with si 
men, was planted just behind a small thicket of bushes, as a 
advanced guard, with orders to let the first of them pass b; 
and then fire into the middle of them, and, as soon as he ha 
fired, to make his retreat as nimbly as he could round a pa: 
of the wood, and so come in behind the Spaniards, whei 
they stood, having a thicket of trees before them. 

When the savages came on, they ran straggling about evei 
way in heaps, out of all manner of order, and Will Atkins It 
about fifty of them pass by him ; then seeing the rest con: 
in a very thick throng, he orders three of his men to fin 
having loaded their muskets with six or seven bullets a-piea 
about as big as large pistol bullets. How many they kille 
or wounded they knew not ; but the consternation and sui 
prise was inexpressible among the savages: they wei 
frightened to the last degree to hear such a dreadful noisi 
and see Aeir men killed, and others hurt, but see nobod 
that did4[; when, in the middle of their fright, Will Atkir 
and his other three let fly again among the thickest of them 
and in less than a minute the first three being loaded agaii 
gave them a third Volley. 

Had Will Atkins and hia men retired immediately, as soo 
as they had fired, as they were ordered to do, or had the res 
of the body been at hand, to have poured in their shot con 
tinually, the savages had been effectually routed; for th 
terror that was among them came principally from this, tha 
they were killed by the gods with thunder and lightning, an 
could see nobody that hurt them ; but Will Atkins., stayin 
to load again, discovered the cheat : some of the savages wh 
were at a distance spying them, came upon them behind 
and though Atkins and his men fired at them also, two o 
three times, and killed above twenty, retiring as fast as the 
could, yet they wounded Atkins himself, and killed one c 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 291 

his fellow Englishmen with their arrows, as they did after- 
wards one Spaniard, and one of the Indian slaves who came 
with the women. This slave was a most gallant fellow, and 
fought most desperately, killing five of them with his own 
hand, having no weapon but one of the armed staves and a 
hatchet. 

Our men being thus hard laid at, Atkins wounded, and two 
other men killed, retreated to a rising ground in the wood ; 
and the Spaniards, after firing three volleys upon them, re- 
treated also ; for their number was so great, and they were 
so desperate, that though above fifty of them were killed, and 
more than as many wounded, yet they came on in the teeth 
of our men, fearless of danger, and shot their arrows like a 
cloud ; and it was observed that their wounded men, who 
were not quite disabled, were made outrageous, and fought 
like madmen. 

When our men retreated, they left the Spaniard and the 
Englishman that were killed behind them ; and the savages, 
when they came up to them, killed them over again in a 
wretched manner, breaking their arms, legs, and heads, with 
their clubs and wooden swords, like true savages ; but finding 
our men were gone, they did not seem to pursue them, but 
drew themselves up in a ring, which is, it seems, their custom, 
and shouted twice, in token of their victory ; after which, 
they had the mortification to see several of their wounded 
men fall, dying with the mere loss of blood. 

The Spaniard governor having drawn his little body up 
together upon a rising ground, Atkins, though he was 
wounded, would have had them march and charge again all 
together at once ; but the Spaniard replied, " Seignior Atkins, 
you see how their wounded men fight; let them alone till 
morning ; all the wounded men will be stiff and sore with 
their wounds, and faint with the loss of blood ; and so we 
shall have the fewer to engage." This advice was good : but 
Will Atkins replied merrily, " That is true, Seignior, and so 
shall I too ; and that is the reason I would go on while I am 
warm." "Well, Seignior Atkins," says the Spaniard, "you 
have behaved gallantly, and done your part ; we will fight 
for you if you cannot come on ; but I think it best to stay 
till morning ;" so they waited. 

But as it was a clear moonlight night, and they found the 



292 „. 

savages in great disorder about their dead and wounded men, 
and a great noise and hurry among them where they lay, 
they afterwards resolved to fall upon them in the night; 
especially if they could come to give them but one volley 
before they were discovered, which they had a fair oppor- 
tunity to do : for one of the Englishmen in whose quarter it 
was where the fight began, led them round between the woods 
and the sea-side westward, and then turning short south, they 
came so near where the thickest of them lay, that, before 
they were seen or heard, eight of them fired in upon them, 
and did dreadful execution upon them ; in half a minute 
more, eight others fired after them, pouring in their small 
shot in such a quantity, that abundance were killed and 
wounded ; and all this while they were not able to see who 
hurt them, or which way to fly. 

The Spaniards charged again with the utmost expedition, 
and then divided themselves into three bodies, and resolved 
to fall in among them all together. They had in each body 
eight persons, that is to say, twenty-two men, and the two 
women, who, by the way, fought desperately. They divided 
the fire-arms equally in each party, as well as the halberts 
and staves. They would have had the women kept back, 
but they said they were resolved to die with their husbands. 
Having thus formed their little army, they marched out from 
among the trees, and came up to the teeth of the enemy, 
shouting and hallooing as loud as they could : the savages 
stood all together, but were in the utmost confusion, hearing 
the noise of our men shouting from three quarters together : 
they would have fought if they had seen us ; for as soon 
as we came near enough to be seen, some arrows were 
shot, and poor old Friday was wounded, though not dan- 
gerously ; but our men gave them no time, but, running up 
to them, fired among them three ways, and then fell in with 
the butt-ends of their muskets, their swords, armed staves, 
and hatchets, and laid about them so well, that, in a word, 
they set up a dismal screaming and howling, flying to save 
their lives which way soever they could. 

Our men were tired with the execution, and killed or 
mortally wounded in the two fights about one hutidred and 
eighty of them ; the rest, being frightened out of their wits, 
scoured through the woods and over the hills, with all the 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 293 

speed fear and nimble feet could help them to ; and as we 
did not trouble ourselves much to pursue them, they got all 
together to the sea-side where they landed, and where their 
canoes lay. But their disaster was not at an end yet ; for it 
blew a terrible storm of wind that evening from the sea, so 
that it was impossible for them to go off; nay, the storm 
continuing all night, when the tide came up, their canoes 
were most of them driven by the surge of the sea so high 
upon the shore that it required infinite toil to get them off; 
and some of them were even dashed to pieces against the 
beach, or against one another. 

Our men, though glad of their victory, yet got little rest 
that night ; but having refreshed themselves as well as they 
could, they resolved to march to that part of the island where 
the savages were fled, and see what posture they were in. 
This necessarily led them over the place where the fight had 
been, and where they found several of the poor creatures not 
quite dead, and yet past recovering life. 

At length, they came in view of the place where the more 
miserable remains of the savages' army lay, where there 
appeared about a hundred still : their posture was generally 
sitting upon the ground, with their knees up towards their 
mouth, and the head put between the two hands, leaning 
down upon the knees. 

When our men came within two musket-shots of them, the 
Spaniard governor ordered two muskets to be fired, without 
ball, to alarm them : this he did, that by their countenance he 
might know what to expect, whether they were still in heart 
to fight, or were so heartily beaten as to be dispirited and 
discouraged, and so he might manage accordingly. This 
stratagem took; for as soon as the savages heard the first 
gun, and saw the flash of the second, they started up upon 
their feet in the greatest consternation imaginable ; and as 
our men advanced swiftly towards them, they all ran scream- 
ing and yelling away, with a kind of howling noise, which 
our men did not understand, and had never heard before ; 
and thus they ran up the hills into the country. 

At first our men had much rather the weather had been 
calm, and they had all gone away to sea ; but they did not 
then consider that this might probably have been the occa- 
sion of their coming again in such multitudes as not to be 



294 



XIUBJUXSUIN (JKUSOJS. 



resisted, or, at least, to come so many and so often, as would 
quite desolate the island, and starve them. Will Atkins, 
therefore, who, notwithstanding his wound, kept always with 
them, proved the best counsellor in this case: his advice was, 
to take the advantage that offered, and step in between them 
and their boats, and so deprive them of the capacity of ever 
returning any more to plague the island. 

They consulted long about this ; and some were against it 
for fear of making the wretches fly to the woods and live 
there desperate, and so they should have them to hunt like 
wild beasts, be afraid to stir out about their business, and 
have their plantations continually rifled, all their tame goats 
destroyed, and, in short, be reduced to a life of continual 
distress. 

Will Atkins told them they had better have to do with a 
hundred men than with a hundred nations : that as they must 
destroy their boats, so they must destroy the men, or be all 
of them destroyed themselves. In a word, he showed them 
the necessity of it so plainly, that they all came into it ; so 
they went to work immediately with the boats, and getting 
some dry wood together from an old tree, they tried to set 
some of them on fire, but they were so wet that they would 
not burn ; however, the fire so burned the upper part, that 
it soon made them unfit for swimming in the sea as boats. 
When the Indians saw what they were about, some of them 
came running out of the woods, and coming as near as they 
could to our men, kneeled down and cried, " Oa, Oa, Wara- 
moka," and some other words of their language, which none 
of the others understood anything of; but as they made 
pitiful gestures and strange noises, it was easy to understand 
they begged to have their boats spared, and that they would 
be gone, and never come there again. But our men were 
now satisfied that they had no way to preserve themselves, 
or to save their colony, but effectually to prevent any of these 
people from ever going home again : depending upon this, 
that if even so much as one of them got back into their 
country to tell the story, the colony was undone ; so that, 
letting them know that they should not have any mercy, they 
fell to work with their canoes, and destroyed every one that 
the storm had not destroyed before ; at the sight of which 
the savages raised a hideous cry in the woods, which our 



KOBIXSON CKUSUJi. 



295 



people heard plain enough, after which they ran about the 
island like distracted men ; so that, in a word, our men did 
not really know, at first, what to do with them. Nor did 
the Spaniards, with all their prudence, consider that while 
they made those people thus desperate, they ought to have 
kept a good guard at the same time upon their plantations ; 
for though it is true they had driven away their cattle, and 
the Indians did not find out their main retreat, I mean my 
old castle at the hill, nor the cave in the valley, yet they 
found out my plantation at the bower, and pulled it all to 
pieces, and all the fences and planting about it; trod all the 
corn under foot, tore up the vines and grapes, being just then 
almost ripe, and did our men an inestimable damage, though 
to themselves not one farthing's worth of service. 

Though our men were able to fight them upon all occa- 
sions, yet they were in no condition to pursue them, or hunt 
them up and down : for as they were too nimble of foot for 
our men when they found them single, they durst not go 
abroad single, for fear of being surrounded with their num- 
bers. The best was, they had no weapons; for though 
they had bows, they had no arrows left, nor any materials 
to make any ; nor had they any edge-tool or weapon among 
them. 

It was some while before any of them could be taken ; but 
being weak and half-starved, one of them was at last sur- 
prised and made a prisoner. He was sullen at first, and 
would neither eat nor drink; but finding himself kindly 
used, and victuals given to him, and no violence offered him, 
he at last grew tractable and came to himself. They brought 
old Friday to him, who talked often with him, and told him 
how kind the others would be to them all ; that they would 
not only save their lives, but give them part of the island to 
live in, provided they would give satisfaction that they would 
keep in their own bounds, and not come beyond it to injure 
or prejudice others ; and that they should have corn given 
them to plant and make it grow for their bread, and some 
bread given them for their present subsistence : and old 
Friday bade the fellow go and talk with the rest of his 
countrymen, and see what they said to it ; assuring them 
that, if they did not agree immediately, they should be all 
destroyed. 



The poor wretches, thoroughly humbled, and reduced in 
number to about thirty-seven, closed with the proposal at 
the first offer, and begged to have some food given them ; 
upon which, twelve Spaniards and two Englishmen, well 
armed, with three Indian slaves and old Friday, marched to 
the place where they were. The three Indian slaves carried 
them a large quantity of bread, some rice boiled up to cakes 
and dried in the sun, and three live goats ; and they were 
ordered to go to the side of a hill, where they sat down, ate 
their provisions very thankfully, and were the most faithful 
fellows to their words that could be thought of; for, except 
when they came to beg victuals and directions, they never 
came out of their bounds ; and there they lived when I came 
to the island, and I went to see them. 

They had taught them both to plant corn, make bread, 
breed tame goats, and milk them : they wanted nothing but 
wives, and would soon have been a nation. They were con- 
fined to a neck of land, surrounded with high rocks behind 
them, and lying plain towards the sea before them, on the 
south-east corner of the island. They had land enough, and 
it was very good and fruitful ; about a mile and a half broad, 
and three or four miles in length. 

Our men taught them to make wooden spades, such as I 
made for myself, and gave among them twelve hatchets and 
three or four knives ; and there they lived, the most sub- 
jected, innocent creatures that ever were heard of. 

After this, the colony enjoyed a perfect tranquillity, with 
respect to the savages, till I came to revisit them, which was 
about two years after; not but that, now and then, some 
canoes of savages came on shore for their triumphal, un- 
natural feasts ; but as they were of several nations, and per- 
haps had never heard of those that came before, or the 
reason of it, they did not make any search or inquiry after 
their countrymen ; and if they had it would have been very 
hard to have found them out. 

Having thus given a view of the state of things as I found 
them, I must relate the heads of what I did for these people, 
and the condition in which I left them. 

We appointed a day to dine all together; and, indeed, we 
made a splendid feast. I caused the ship's cook and his 
mate to come on shore and dress our dinner, and the old 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 



297 



cook's mate we had on shore assisted. "We brought on shore 
six pieces of good beef, and four pieces of pork, out of the 




ship's provisions, with our punchbowl, and materials to fill 
it; _and, in particular, I gave them ten bottles of French 
claret, and ten bottles of English beer : things that neither 



298 



j.wjLjxi.io^/J.V VsAUQUEs* 



the Spaniards nor the English had tasted for many years, and 
which it may be supposed they were very glad of. The 
Spaniards added to our feast five whole kids, which the cooks 
roasted ; and three of them were sent, covered up close, on 
board the ship to the seamen, that they might feast on fresh 
meat from on shore, as we did with their salt meat from on 
board. 

After this feast, at which we were very innocently merry, 
I brought my cargo of goods ; wherein, that there might be 
no dispute about dividing, I showed them that there was a 
sufficiency for them all, desiring that they might all take an 
equal quantity of the goods that were for wearing — that is 
to say, equal when made up. As, first I distributed linen 
sufficient to make every one of them four shirts, and, at the 
Spaniard's request, afterwards made them up six : these were 
exceeding comfortable to them, having been what they had 
long since forgot the use of. I allotted the thin English stuffs, 
which I mentioned before, to make every one a light coat, 
like a frock, wkich I judged fittest for the heat of the season, 
cool and loose; and ordered that whenever they decayed, 
they should make more, as they thought fit ; the like for 
pumps, shoes, stockings, hats, etc. 

I cannot express what pleasure and satisfaction sat upon 
the countenances of all these poor men, when they saw the 
care I had taken of them, and how well I had furnished them. 
They told me I was a father to them ; and that having such 
a correspondent as I was in so remote a part of the world, it 
would make them forget that they were left in a desolate 
place ; and they all voluntarily engaged to me not to leave 
the place without my consent. 

Then I presented to them the people I had brought with 
me, particularly the tailor, the smith, and the two carpenters, 
all of them most necessary people ; but, above all, my general 
artificer, than whom they could not name anything that was 
more useful : and the tailor, to show his concern for them, 
went to work immediately, and, with my leave, made them 
every one a shirt, the first thing he did ; and, what was still 
more, he taught the women not only how to sew and stitch, 
and use the needle, but made them assist to make the shirts 
for their husbands, and for all the rest. 

As to the carpenters, I scarce need mention how lueiul 



KOBIXSON CRUSOE. 299 

they were ; for they took to pieces all my clumsy, unhandy 
things, and made clever, convenient tables, stools, bedsteads, 
cupboards, lockers, shelves, and everything they wanted of 
that kind. But to let them see how nature made artificers at 
first, I carried the carpenters to see Will Atkins' basket- 
house, as I called it ; and they both owned they never saw 
an instance of such natural ingenuity before, nor anything so 
regular and so handily built, at least of its kind ; and one of 
them, when he saw it, after musing a good while, turning 
about to me, " I am sure," says he, " that man has no need 
of us ; you need do nothing but give him tools." 

Then I brought them out all my store of tools, and gave 
every man a digging spade, a shovel, and a rake, for we had 
no harrows or plough ; and to every separate place a pickaxe, 
a crow, a broad axe, and a saw : always appointing, that as 
often as any were broken or worn out, they should be sup- 
plied, without grudging, out of the general stores that I left 
behind. Nails, staples, hinges, hammers, chisels, knives, 
scissors, and all sorts of iron-work, they bad without reserve, 
as they required ; for no man would take more than he 
wanted, and he must be a fool that would waste or spoil them 
on any account whatever ; and for the use of the smith, I left 
two tons of unwrought iron for a supply. 

My magazine of powder and arms which I brought them 
was such, even to profusion, that they could not but rejoice 
at them ; for now they could march as I used to do, with a 
musket upon each shoulder, if there was occasion ; and were 
able to fight a thousand savages, if they had but some little 
advantages of situation, which also they could not miss, if 
they had occasion. 

I carried on shore with me the young man whose mother 
was starved to death, and the maid also ; she was a sober, 
well educated, religious young woman, and behaved so in- 
offensively that every one gave her a good word ; she had, 
indeed, an unhappy life with us, there being no woman in 
the ship but herself, but she bore it with patience. After a 
while, seeing things so well ordered, and in so fine a way of 
thriving upon my island, and considering that they had 
neither business nor acquaintance in the East Indies, or 
reason for taking so long a voyage, both of them came to me, 
and desired I would give them leave to remain on the island, 



300

and be entered among my family, as they called it. I agreed 
to this readily ; and they had a little plot of ground allotted 
to them, where they had three tents or houses set up, sur- 
rounded with a basket-work, pallisadoed like Atkins's, ad- 
joining to his plantation. Their tents were contrived so that 
they had each of them a room apart to lodge in, and a middle 
tent like a great storehouse, to lay their goods in, and to eat 
and drink in. And now the other two Englishmen removed 
their habitation to the same place; and so the island was 
divided into three colonies, and no more, viz., the Spaniards, 
with old Friday 'ind the first servants, at my old habitation 
under the hill, which was, in a word, the capital city, and 
where they had so enlarged and extended their works, as well 
under as on the outside of the hill, that they lived, though 
perfectly concealed, yet full at large. Never was there such 
a little city in a wood, and so hid, in any part of the world ; 
for I verily believe that a thousand men might have ranged 
the island a month, and, if they had not known there was 
such a thing, and looked on purpose for it, they would not 
have found it ; for the trees stood so thick and so close, and 
grew so fast woven one into another, that nothing but cutting 
them down first could discover the place, except the only two 
narrow entrances where they went in and out could be found, 
which was not very easy ; one of them was close down at the 
water's edge, on the side of the creek, and it was afterwards 
above two hundred yards to the place : and the other was up 
a ladder at twice, as I have already described it ; and they 
had also a large wood, thickly planted, on the top of the hill, 
containing above an acre, which grew apace, and concealed 
the place from all discovery there, with only one narrow place 
between two trees, not easily to be discovered, to enter on 
that side. 

The only colony was that of Will Atkins, where there were 
four families of Englishmen, I mean those I had left there, 
with their wives and children : three savages that were slaves ; 
the widow and the children of the Englishman that was killed ; 
the young man and the maid ; and, by the way, we made a 
wife of her before we went away. There was also the two 
carpenters and the tailor, whom I brought with me for them ; 
also the smith, who was a very necessary man to them, espe- 
cially as a gunsmith, to take care of their arms ; and my other 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 301 

man, whom I called Jack-of-all-trades, who "was in himself as 
good almost as twenty men ; for he was not only a very in- 
genious fellow, but a very merry fellow ; and before I went 
away we married him to the honest maid that came with the 
youth in the ship I mentioned before. 

Having thus brought the affairs of the island to a narrow 
compass, I was preparing to go on board the ship, when the 
young man I had taken out of the famished ship's company 
came to me, and told me he understood I had a clergyman 
with me, and that I had caused the Englishmen to be married 
to the savages ; that he had a match, too, which he desired 
might be finished before I went, between two Christians, 
which he hoped would not be disagreeable to me. 

I knew this must be the young woman who was his mother's 
servant, for there was no other Christian woman on the island: 
so I began to persuade him not to do anything of that kind 
rashly, or because he found himself in this solitary circum- 
stance. I represented to him that he had some considerable 
substance in the world, and good friends, as I understood by 
himself, and the maid also : that the maid was not only poor, 
and a servant, but was unequal to him, she being six or 
seven and twenty years old ; and he not above seventeen or 
eighteen ; that he might very probably, with my assistance, 
make a remove from this wilderness, and come into his own 
country again ; and that then it would be a thousand to one 
but he would repent his choice, and the dislike of that cir- 
cumstance might be disadvantageous to both. I was going 
to say more, but he interrupted me, smiling, and told me, 
with a great deal of modesty, that I mistook in my guesses, — 
that he had nothing of that kind in his thoughts ; and he was 
very glad to hear that I had an intent of putting them in a 
way to see their own country again ; and nothing should have 
made him think of staying there, but that the voyage I was 
going was so exceeding long and hazardous, and would carry 
him quite out of the reach of all his friends ; that he had 
nothing to desire of me, but that I would settle him in some 
little property in the island whese he was, give him a servant 
or two, and some few necessaries, and he would live here like 
a planter, waiting the good time when, if ever I returned to 
England, I would redeem him ; and hoped I would not be 
unmindful of him when I came to England : that he would 



302 

give me some letters to his friends in London, to let them 
know how good I had been to him, and in what part of the 
world, and what circumstances I had left him in : and he 
promised me that whenever I redeemed him, the plantation, 
and all the improvements he had made upon it, let the value 
be what it would, should be wholly mine. 

His discourse was very prettily delivered, considering his 
youth, and was the more agreeable to me, because he told 
me positively the match was not for himself. I gave him all 
possible assurances that if I lived to come safe to England, I 
would deliver his letters, and do his business effectually ; and 
that he might depend I should never forget the circumstances 
I had left him in ; but still I was impatient to know who was 
the person to be married : upon which he told me it was my 
Jack-of-all-trades and his maid Susan. I was most agreeably 
surprised when he named the match ; for, indeed, I thought it 
very suitable. The character of that man I have given 
already ; and as for the maid, she was a very honest, modest, 
sober, and religious young woman ; had a very good share of 
sense, was agreeable enough in her person, spoke very hand- 
somely and to the purpose, always with decency and good 
manners, and was neither too backward to speak when requi- 
site, nor impertinently forward when it was not her business ; 
very handy and housewifely, and an excellent manager ; fit, 
indeed, to have been governess to the whole island ; and she 
knew very well how to behave in every respect. 

The match being proposed in this manner, we married them 
the same day ; and as I was father at the altar, and gave her 
away, so I gave her a portion ; for I appointed her and her 
husband a handsome large space of ground for their planta- 
tion ; and, indeed, this match, and the proposal the young 
gentleman made to give him a small property in the island, 
put me upon parcelling it out amongst them, that they might 
not quarrel afterwards about their situation. 

This sharing out the land to them I left to Will Atkins, 
who was now grown a sober, grave, managing fellow, per- 
fectly reformed, exceedingly pious and religious ; and, as far 
as I may be allowed to speak positively in such a case, I verily 
believe he was a true penitent. He divided things so justly, 
and so much to every one's satisfaction, that they only desired 
one general writing under my hand for the whole, which I 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 303 

caused to be drawn up, and signed and sealed, setting out the 
bounds and situation of every man's plantation, and testifying 
that I gave them thereby severally a right to the whole pos- 
session and inheritance of the respective plantations or farms, 
with their improvements, to them and their heirs, reserving all 
the rest of the island as my own property, and a certain rent 
for every particular plantation after eleven years, if I, or any 
one from me, or in my name, came to demand it, producing 
an attested copy of the same writing. 

As to the government and laws among them, I told them I 
was not capable of giving them better rules than they were 
able to give themselves ; only I made them promise me to live 
in love and good neighbourhood with one another ; and so I 
prepared to leave them. 

Having now done with the island, I left them all in good 
circumstances, and in a nourishing condition, and went on 
board my ship again on the 6th of May, having been about 
twenty-five clays among them. 

The next day, giving them a salute of five guns at parting, 
we set sail, and arrived at the bay of All Saints in the Brazils, 
in about twenty-two days, meeting nothing remarkable in our 
passage but this : that about three days after we had sailed, 
being becalmed, and the current setting strong to the E.N.E., 
into a bay or gulf on the land side, we were driven something 
out of our course, and once or twice our men cried out, 
"Land to the eastward !" but whether it was the continent or 
islands we could not tell by any means. But the third day, 
towards evening, the sea smooth, and the weather calm, we 
saw the sea covered, towards the land, with something very 
black ; not being able to discover what it was, till, after some 
time, our chief mate going up the main-shrouds a little waj r , 
and looking at them with a perspective, cried out it was an 
army. 1 could not imagine what he meant by an army, and 
thwarted him a little hastily. " Nay, sir," says he, " don't be 
angry, for 'tis an army, and a fleet too ; for I believe there 
are a thousand canoes, and you may see them paddle along, 
for they are coming towards us apace." 

I was a little surprised then, indeed, and so was my nephew, 
the captain ; for he had heard such terrible stories of them in 
the island, and having never been in those seas before, that 
he could not tell what to think of it, but said, two or three 



304 KOI5IN30N CRUSOE. 

times, we should all be devoured. I must confess, considering 
■we were becalmed, and the current set strong towards the 
shore, I liked it the worse; however, I bade them not be 
afraid, but bring the ship to an anchor as soon as we came so 
near as to know that we must engage them. 

The weather continued calm, and they came on apace to- 
wards us ; so I gave orders to come to an anchor, and furl all 
our sails ; as for the savages, I told them they had nothing to 
fear but fire, and therefore they should get their boats out, 
and fasten them, one close by the head, and the other by the 
stern, and man them both well, and wait the issue in that 
posture : this I did, that the men in the boats might be ready 
with sheets and buckets to put out any firo these savages 
might endeavour to fix to the outside of the ship. 

In this posture we lay by for them, and in a little while 
they came up with us ; but never was such a horrid sight 
seen by Christians : though my mate was much mistaken in 
his calculation of their number, yet when they came up we 
reckoned about a hundred and twenty-six ; some of them had 
sixteen or seventeen men in them, and some more, and the 
least six or seven. 

When they came nearer to us, they seemed to be struck 
with wonder and astonishment, as at a sight which doubtless 
they had never seen before ; nor could they at first, as we 
afterwards understood, know what to make of us ; they came 
boldly up, however, very near to us, and seemed to go about 
to row round us : but we called to our men in the boats not 
to let them come too near them. This very order brought us 
to an engagement with them, without our designing it ; for 
five or six of the large canoes came so near our long-boat, that 
our men beckoned with their hands to keep them back, which 
they understood very well, and went back ; but at their re- 
treat about fifty arrows came on board us from those boats,, 
and one of our men in the long-boat was very much wounded. 
However, I called to them not to fire by any means ; but we 
handed down some deal boards into the boat, and the car- 
penter presently set up a kind of fence, like waste boards, 
to cover them from the arrows of the savages, if they should 
shoot again. 

About half an hour afterwards they all came up in a body 
astern of us, and so near that we could easily discern what 



ROBINSON CtlUSOE. 305 

they were, though we could not tell their design ; and I found 
they were some of my old friends, the same sort of savages 
that I had been used to engage with ; and in a short time 
more they rowed a little farther out to sea, till they came 
directly broadside with, us, and then rowed down straight 
upon us, till they came so near that they could hear us speak : 
upon this I ordered all my men to keep close, lest they should 
shoot any more arrows, and made all our guns ready ; but 
being so near as to be within hearing, I made Friday go out 
upon the deck, and call aloud to them in his language, to 
know what they meant ; which accordingly he did. Whether 
they understood him I knew not: but as soon as he had 
called to them, six, who were in the foremost or nighest boat 
to us, turned their canoes from us, and stooping down, showed 
us their naked backs. Whether this was a defiance or chal- 
lenge we knew not, or whether it was done in mere contempt, 
or as a signal to the rest ; but immediately Friday cried out 
they were going to shoot, and, unhappily for him, poor fellow, 
they let fly about three hundred of their arrows, and, to my 
inexpressible grief, killed poor Friday, no other man being in 
their sight. The poor fellow was shot with no less than three 
arrows, and about three more fell very near him ; such unlucky 
marksmen they were ! 

I was so enraged at the loss of my old trusty servant and 
companion, that I immediately ordered five guns to be loaded 
with small shot, and four with great, and gave them such a 
broadside as they had never heard in their lives before. They 
were not above half a cable's length off when we fired ; and 
our gunners took their aim so well, that three or four of their 
canoes were overset, as we had reason to believe, by one shot 
only. 

The ill manners of turning up their bare backs to us gave 
us no great offence ; neither did I know for certain whether 
that which would pass for the greatest contempt among us 
might be understood so by them or not ; therefore, in return, 
I had only resolved to have fired four or five guns at them 
with powder only, which I knew would frighten them suffi- 
ciently : but when they shot at us directly with all the fury 
they were capable of, and especially as they had killed my 
poor Friday, whom I so entirely loved and valued, and who, 
indeed, so well deserved it, I thought myself not only justi- 
20 



306 



>VJV^^ VAVLJO^r.« 



fiable before God and man, but would have been very glad if 
I could have overset every canoe there, and drowned every 
one of them. 

I cannot tell how many we killed nor now many we wounded 
at this broadside, but sure such a fright and hurry never were 
seen anion cr such a multitude. There were thirteen or four- 

O 

teen of their canoes split and overset in all, and the men set 
a-swimming: the rest, frightened out of their wits, scoured 
away as fast as they could, taking but little care to save those 
whose boats were split or spoiled with our shot ; so I suppose 
that many of them were lost ; and our men took up one poor 
fellow swimming for his life, above an hour after they were 
gone. 

The small shot from our cannon must needs kill and wound 
a great many ; but, in short, we never knew how it went with 
them, for they fled so fast that, in three hours or thereabouts, 
we could not see above three or four straggling canoes, nor 
did we ever see the rest any more ; for a breeze of wind 
springing up the same evening, we weighed, and set sail for 
the Brazils. 

We went away with a fair wind for Brazil; and in about 
twelve days' time we made land, in the latitude of five degrees 
south of the line, being the north-easternmost land of all that 
part of America. We kept on S. by E., in sight of the shore 
four days, when we made Cape St. Augustine, and came to an 
anchor off the Bay of All Saints, the old place of my deliver- 
ance, whence came both my good and evil fate. 

Never came ship to this port that had less business than I 
had, and yet it was with great difficulty that we were admitted 
to hold the least correspondence on shore : not my partner 
himself, who was alive,, and made a great figure among them, 
not my two merchant-trustees, not the fame of my wonderful 
preservation in the island, could obtain me that favour ; but 
my partner, remembering that I had given five hundred 
moidores to the Prior of the Monastery of the Augustines, 
and two hundred and seventy-two to the poor, went to the 
monastery, and obliged the prior that then was to go to the 
governor, and get leave for me personally, with the captain 
and one more, besides eight seamen, to come on shore, and no 
more; and this upon condition that we should not offer to 
bad any goods out of the ship, or to carry any person away 



i.uiJiJsau.N uituau±..

Tliey were so strict with us as to landing 
any goods, that it was with extreme difficulty that I got on 
shore three bales, such as fine broadcloths, stuffs, and some 
linen, which I had brought as a present to my partner. 

He was a very generous, open-hearted man ; though, like 
me, he began with little at first ; and though he knew not 
that I had the least design of giving him anything, he sent 
me on board a present of fresh provisions, wine, and sweet- 
meats, worth above thirty moidores, including some tobacco, 
and three or four fine medals of gold : but I was even with 
him in my present, which, as I have said, consisted of fine 
broadcloth, English stuffe, lace, and fine Hollands ; also, I 
delivered him about the value of one hundred pounds sterling, 
in the same goods, for other uses ; and I obliged him to set 
up the sloop, which I had brought with me from England, for 
the use of my colony, in order to send the refreshments I 
intended to my plantation. 

Accordingly, he got hands, and finished the sloop in a very 
few days, for she was already framed ; and I gave the master 
of her such instructions that he could not mis3 the place ; nor 
did he, as I had an account from my partner afterwards. I 
got him soon loaded with the small cargo I sent them ; and 
one of our seamen, that had been on shore with me there, 
offered to go with the sloop and settle there, upon my letter 
to the governor Spaniard, to allot him a sufficient quantity of 
land for a plantation, and giving him some clothes and tools 
for his planting work, which he said he understood, having 
been an old planter at Maryland, and a buccaneer into the 
bargain. I encouraged the fellow by granting all he desired ; 
and, as an addition, I gave him the savage whom Ave had 
taken prisoner of war, to be his slave, and ordered the gover- 
nor Spaniard to give him his share of everything he wanted 
with the rest. 

"When we came to fit this man out, my old partner told me 
there was a certain very honest fellow, a Brazil planter of his 
acquaintance who had fallen into the displeasure of the Church. 
" I know not what the matter is with him," says he, "but, on 
my conscience, I think he is a heretic in his heart, and he has 
been obliged to conceal himself for fear of the Inquisition ;" 
that he would be very glad of such an opportunity to make 
his escape, with his wife and two daughters ; and if I would 



308 



vjiiu V\S*J» 



let them go to my island, and allot them a plantation, he 
would give them a small stock to begin with — for the officers 
of the Inquisition had seized all his effects and estate, and he 
had nothing left but a little household stuff, and two slaves ; 
"and," adds he, "though I hate his principles, yet I would 
not have him fall into their hands, for he will be assuredly 
burned alive if he does." 

I granted this presently, and joined my Englishman with 
them ; and we concealed the man, and his wife and "daughters, 
on board our ship, till the sloop put out to go to sea ; and 
then, having put all their goods on board some time before, we 
put them on board after she was out of the bay. 

Our seaman was mightily pleased with this new partner ; 
and their stocks, indeed, were much alike, rich in tools, in 
preparations, and a farm — but nothing to begin with, except 
as above: however, they carried over with them, what was 
worth all the rest, some materials for planting sugar-canes, 
with some plants of canes, which he understood very well. 

Among the rest of the supplies sent to my tenants in the 
island, I sent them by the sloop three milch cows and five 
calves, about twenty-two hogs among them, three sows big 
with pig, two mares, and a stone-horse. For my Spaniards, 
according to my promise, I engaged three Portugal women to 
go, and recommended it to them to marry them, and use them 
kindly. I could have procured more women, but I remem- 
bered that the poor prosecuted man had two daughters, and 
that therp were but five of the Spaniards that wanted — the 
rest had wives of their own, though in another country. 

All this cargo arrived safe, and, as you may easily suppose, 
was very welcome to my old inhabitants, who were now, with 
this addition, between sixty and seventy people, besides little 
children, of which there were a great many. I found letters 
at London from them all, by way of Lisbon, when I came 
back to England, of which I shall also take some notice imme- 
diately. 

I have now done with the island, and all manner of dis- 
course about it : and whoever reads the rest of my memo- 
randums would do well to turn his thoughts entirely from it. 
and expect to read of the follies of an old man, not warned 
by his own harms, much less by those of other men, to 
beware; not cooled by almost forty years' miseries and dis- 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 309. 

appointments — not satisfied with prosperity beyond expecta- 
tion — nor made cautious by afflictions and distress beyond 
imitation. 

I had no more business to go to the East Indies than a man 
at full liberty has to go to the turnkey at Newgate, and desire 
him to lock him up among the prisoners there, and starve him. 
Had I taken a small vessel from England, and gone directly 
to the island ; had I loaded her, as I did the other vessel, with 
all the necessaries for the plantation, and for my people ; 
taken a patent from the government here to have secured my 
property, in subjection only to that of England ; had I carried 
over cannon and ammunition, servants and people to plant, 
and taken possession of the place, fortified and strengthened 
it in the name of England, and increased it with people, as I 
might easily have done ; had I then settled myself there, and 
sent the ship back laden with good rice, as I might also have 
done in six months' time, and ordered my friends to have 
fitted her out again for our supply, — had I done this, and 
stayed there myself, I had at least acted like a man of common 
sense : but I was possessed of a wandering spirit, and scorned 
all advantages : I pleased myself with being the patron of the 
people I placed there, and doing for them in a kind of haughty, 
majestic way, like an old patriarchal monarch, providing for 
them as if I had been father of the whole family, as well as of 
the plantation : but I never so much as pretended to plant in 
the name of any government or nation, or to acknowledge any 
prince, or to call my people subjects to any one nation more 
than another : nay, I never so much as gave the place a name, 
but left it as I found it, belonging to nobody, and the people 
under no discipline or government but my own ; who, though 
T had influence over them as a father and benefactor, had no 
authority or power to act or command one way or other, 
farther than voluntary consent moved them to comply : yet 
even this, had I stayed there, would have done well enough ; 
but as I rambled from them, and came there no more, the last 
letters I had from any of them were by my partner's means, 
who afterwards sent another sloop to the place, and who sent 
me word, though I had not the letter till I got to London, 
several years after it was written, that they went on but 
poorly, were discontent with their long stay there : that "Will 
Atkins was dead, — that five of the Spaniards were come away, 



310 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

— and though they had not been much molested by the savages, 
yet they had had some skirmishes with them ; and that they 
begged of him to write to me to think of the promise I had 
made to fetch them away, that they might see their country 
again before they died. 

But I was gone a wild-goose chase, indeed ! and they that 
will have any more of me, must be content to follow me ir.to 
a new variety of follies, hardships, and wild adventures, 
wherein the justice of Providence may be duly observed ; and 
;we may see how easily Heaven can gorge us with our own 
jdesires, make the strongest of 'our wishes be our affliction, and 
punish us most severely with those very things which we think 
it would be our utmost happiness to be allowed in. Whether 
I had business or no business, away I went : it is no time now 
to enlarge upon the reason or absurdity of my own conduct, 
but to come to the history, — I was embarked for the voyage, 
end the voyage I went. 

Our ship was on a trading voyage, and had a supercargo 
on board, who has to direct all her motions after she arrived 
at the Cape, only being limited to a certain number of days 
for stay, by charter-party, at the several ports she was to 
go to. 

We stayed at the Cape no longer than was needful to take 
|in fresh water, but made the best of our way for the coast of 
Coromandel. We were, indeed, informed that a French man- 
;of-war, of fifty guns, and two large merchant ships, were gone 
for the Indies ; and as I knew we were at war with France, I 
had some apprehensions of them ; but they went their own 
way, and we heard no more of them. 

We touched first at the Island of Madagascar, where, though 
the people are fierce and treacherous, and very well armed 
with lances and bows, which they use with inconceivable 
dexterity, yet we fared very well with them a while ; they 
treated us very civilly ; and for some trifles which we gave 
them, such as knives, scissors, &c, they brought us eleven 
good fat bullocks, of a middling size, which we took in, partly 
for fresh provisions for our present spending, and the rest to 
salt for the ship's use. 

We were obliged to stay here some time after we had fur- 
nished ourselves with provisions ; and I, who was always too 
curious to look into every nook cf the world wherever I came, 



KOBINSOX CRUSOE. 



511 



went on shore as often as I could. It was on the east side of 
the island that we went on shore one evening : and the people, 
who, by the way, are very numerous, came thronging about 
us, and stood gazing at a distance : but as we had traded 
freely with them, and had been kindly used, we thought our- 
selves in no danger ; but when we saw the people, we cut 
three boughs out of a tree, and stuck them up at a distance 
from us ; which, it seems, is a mark in that country, not only 
of a truce and friendship, but when it is accepted, the other 
set side up three poles or boughs, which is a signal that they 
accept the truce too ; but then this tree is a known condition 
of the truce, that you are not to pass beyond their three poles 
towards them, nor they to come past your three poles, or 
boughs, towards you ; so that you are perfectly secure within 
the three poles, and all the space between your poles and 
theirs is allowed like a market for free converse, traffic, and 
commerce. When you go there, you must not carry your 
■weapons with you ; and if they come into that space, they 
stick up their javelins and lances all at the first poles, and 
come on unarmed ; but if any violence is offered them, and 
the truce thereby broken, away they run to the poles, and lay 
hold of their weapons, and the truce is at an end. 

It happened one evening, when we went on shore, that a 
greater number of their people came down than usual, but all 
very friendly and civil ; and they brought several kinds of 
provisions, for which we satisfied them with such toys as we 
had ; the women also brought us milk and roots, and several 
things very acceptable to us, and all was quiet ; and we made 
us a little tent or hut of some boughs or trees, and lay on 
shore all night. 

I know not what was the occasion, but I was not so well 
satisfied to lie on shore as the rest ; and the boat riding at an 
anchor at about a stone's cast from the land, with two men in 
her to take care of her, I made one of them come on shore ; 
and getting some boughs of trees to cover us also in the boat, 
I spread the sail on the bottom of the boat, and lay under the 
cover of the branches of the trees in the boat. 

About two o'clock in the morning, we heard one of our men 
make a terrible noise on the shore, calling out, for God's sake, 
to bring the boat in, and come and help them, for they were 
all like to be murdered ; at the same time, I heard the fire of 



» 



512 



-— -.^ovyr. ^ItLSOE. 



five muskets, which was the number of guns they had, and 
that three times over. All this while I knew not what was 
the matter, but rousing immediately from sleep with the noise, 
I eaused the boat to be thrust in, and resolved, with three 
fusees we had on boai'd, to land and assist our men. 

We got the boat soon to the shore, but our men were in 
too much haste : for being come to the shore, they plunged 
into the water, to get to the boat with all the expedition they 
could, being pursued by between three and four hundred men. 
Our men were but nine in all, and only five of them had 
fusees with them ; the rest had pistols and swords, indeed, but 
they were of small use to them. 

We took up seven of our men, and with difficulty enough 
too, three of them being wounded ; and that which was still 
worse was, that while we stood in the boat to take our men 
in, we were in as much danger as they were in on shore ; for 
they poured their arrows in upon us so thick that we were 
glad to barricade the side of the boat up with the benches, 
and two or three loose boards, which, to our great satisfaction, 
we had by mere accident in the boat. And yet, had it been 
daylight, they are, it seems, such exact marksmen, that if they 
could have seen but the least part of any of us, they would 
have been sure of us. We had, by the light of the moon, a 
little sight of them, as they stood pelting us from the shore 
with darts and arrows ; and having got ready our fire-arms, 
we gave them a volley, that we could hear, by the cries of 
some of them, had wounded several ; however, they stood 
thus in battle array on the shore till break of day, which we 
supposed was that they might see the better to take their aim 
at us. 

In this condition we lay, and could not tell how to weigh 
our anchor, or set up our sail, because Ave must needs stand 
up in the boat, and they were as sure to hit us as we were to 
hit a bird in a tree with small shot. We made signals of 
distress to the ship, and though she rode a league off, yet my 
nephew, the captain, hearing our firing, and by glasses per- 
ceiving the posture we lay in, and that we fired towards the 
shore, pretty well understood us : and weighing anchor with 
all speed, he stood as near the shore as he durst with the 
ship, and then sent another boat, with ten hands in her, to 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 



313 



assist us ; but we called to them not to come too near, telling 
them what condition we were in ; however, they stood in near 
to us and one of the men taking the end of a tow-line in his 
hand' and keeping one boat between him and the enemy, so 
that they could not perfectly see him, swam on board us, and 
made fast the line to the boat: upon which we slipped out a 
little cable, and leaving our anchor behind, they towed us out 
of reach of the arrows ; we all the while lying close behind 
the barricado we had made. 

As soon as we were got from between the ship and the 
shore, that we could lay her side to the shore, she ran along 
iust by them, and poured in a broadside among them, loaded 
with pieces of iron and lead, small bullets, and such stuff, 
besides the great shot, which made a terrible havoc among 
them. 

When we were got on board, and out of danger, we had 
time to examine into the occasion of this fray ; and, indeed, 
our supercargo, who had been often in those parts, put me 
upon it ; for he said he was sure the inhabitants would not 
have touched us after we had made a truce, if we had not done 
something to provoke them to it. At length, it came out 
that an old woman, who had come to sell us some milk, had 
brought it within our poles, and a young woman with her, 
who also brought some roots or herbs ; and while the old 
woman was selling us the milk, one of our men offered some 
rudeness to the wench that was with her, at which the old 
woman made a great noise : however, the seaman would not 
quit his prize, but carried her out of the old woman's sight 
among the trees, it being almost dark : the old woman went 
away without her, and as we may suppose, made an outcry 
among the people she came from ; who, upon notice, raised 
this great army upon us in three or four hours, and it was 
great odds but we had all been destroyed. 

One of our men was killed with a lance thrown at him just 
at the beginning of the attack, as he sallied out of the tent 
they had made ; the rest came off free, all but the fellow who 
was the occasion of all the mischief, who paid dear enough 
for his black mistress, for we could not hear what became of 
him for a great while. We lay upon the shore two days 
after, though the wind presented, and make signals for him,

and made our boat sail up shore and down shore several 
leagues, but in vain, so we were obliged to give him over ; 
and if he alone had suffered for it, the loss had been less. 

I 'could not satisfy myself, however, without venturing on 
shore once more, to try if I could learn anything of him or 
them : it was the third night after the action that I had a 
great mind to learn what mischief we had done, and how the 
game stood on the Indians' side. I was careful to do it in the 
dark, lest Ave should be attacked again ; but I ought, indeed, 
to have been sure that the men I went with had been under 
my command, before I engaged in a thing so hazardous and 
mischievous as I was brought into by it, without design. 

We took twenty as stout fellows with us as any in the ship, 
besides the supercargo and myself, and we landed two hours 
before midnight, at the fime place where the Indians stood 
drawn up in the evening before. I landed here, because my 
design, as I have said, was chiefly to see if they had quitted 
the field, and if they had left any marks behind them of the 
mischief we had done them : and I thought if we could sur- 
prise one or two of them, perhaps we might get our man 
again, by way of exchange. 

We landed without any noise, and divided our men into 
two bodies, whereof the boatswain commanded one, and I the 
other. We neither saw nor heard anybody stir when we 
landed ; and we marched up, one body at a distance from the 
other, to the place ; but at first could see nothing, it being 
very dark ; till by-and-by our boatswain, who led the first 
party, fell over a dead body. This made them halt a while, 
for knowing by the circumstances that they were at the place 
where the Indians had stood, they waited for my coming up 
there. We concluded to halt till the moon began to rise, 
which we knew would be in less than an hour, when we could 
easily discern the havoc we had made among them. We told 
thirty-two bodies upon the ground, whereof two were not 
quite dead ; some had an arm, and some a leg shot off, and 
one his head : those that were wounded, we supposed, they 
had carried away. 

When we had made, as I thought, a full discovery of all 
we could come to the knowledge of, I resolved on going on 
board ; but the boatswain and his party sent me word that 
they were resolved to make a visit to the Indian town, where 



-OSINSOX CRUSOE.

these dogs, as they called them, dwelt, and asked me to go 
along with them ; and if they could find them, as they still 
fancfed they should, they did not doubt of getting a good 
booty; and it might be they might find Tom Jeffry there : 
that was the man's name we had lost. 

I positively refused, and rose up in order to go to the boat. 
One or two of the men began to importune me to go ; and 
when I refused, began to grumble, and say they were not 
under my command, and they would go — in a word, they all 
left me but one, whom I persuaded to stay, and a boy left in 
the boat. So the supercargo and I, with the third man, went 
back to the boat, where we told them we would stay for 
them, and take care to take in as many of them as should be 
left ; for I told them it was a mad thing they were going 
about, and supposed most of them would have the fate of Tom 
Jeffry. 

They told me, like seamen, they would warrant it they 
would come again, and they would take care, &c. ; so away 
they went, and though the attempt was desperate, and such as 
none but madmen would have gone about, yet, to give them 
their due, they went about it as warily as boldly : they were 
gallantly armed, for they had every man a fusee or musket, a 
bayonet, and a pistol ; some of them had broad cutlasses, some 
of them had hangers, and the boatswain and two more had 
poleaxes : besides all which, they had among them thirteen 
hand grenades: bolder fellows, and better provided, never 
went about any wicked work in the world. 

When they went out, their chief design was plunder, and 
they were in mighty hopes of finding gold there ; but a cir- 
cumstance which none of them were aware of set them on fire 
with revenge, and made devils of them all. When they came 
to the few Indian houses which they thought had been the 
town, which was not above half a mile off, they were under a 
great disappointment, for there were not above twelve or 
thirteen houses ; and where the town was, or how big, they 
know not. They consulted, therefore, what to do, and were 
some time before they could resolve ; for if they fell upon 
these, they must cut all their throats, and it was ten to one 
but some of them might escape, it being in the night, though 
the moon was up ; and if one escaped, he would run and 
raise all the town, so they should have a whole army upon 



31G 



±vui>ii\S0N CRUSOE. 



them ; again, on the other hand, if they went away and left 
these untouched, for the people were all asleep, they could not 
tell which way to look for the town : however, the last was 
the best advice, so they resolved to leave them, and look for 
the town as well as they could. They went on for sometime, 
when three of them, who were a little before the rest, called 
aloud that they had found Tom Jeffry ; they all ran up to 
the place, where they found the poor fellow hanging up naked 
by one arm, and his throat cut. There was an Indian house 
just by the tree, where they found sixteen or seventeen of the 
principal Indians, who had been concerned in the fray with 
us before, and two or three of them wounded with our shot ; 
and our men found they were awake, and talking one to 
another in that house, but knew not their number. 

The sight of their poor mangled comrade so enraged them, 
that they swore to one another they would be revenged, and 
that not an Indian that came into their hands should have any 
quarter ; this barbarous resolution they carried into effect 
immediately, putting all the poor creatures to death that fell 
in their way, and setting fire to every hut in the village. Our 
men returned early the next morning without receiving any 
injury except that one had sprained his foot, and another had 
burned one of his hands. 

The next day we set sail for the Gulf of Persia, and thence 
to the coast of Coromandcl, only to touch at Surat ; but the 
chief of the supercargo's design lay at the Bay of Bengal. 

The first disaster that befell us was in the Gulf of Persia, 
where five of our men, venturing on shore on the Arabian side 
of the gulf, were surrounded and either killed or carried away 
into slavery; the rest of the boat's crew were not able to 
rescue them, and had but just time to get off their boat. 

We were at this time in the road at Bengal ; and being will- 
ing to see the place, I went on shore with the supercargo, in 
the ship's boat, to divert myself; and towards evening was 
preparing to go on board, when one of the men came to me, 
and told me he would not have me trouble myself to come 
down to the boat, for they had orders not to carry me on 
board any more. Anyone may guess what a surprise I was in 
at so insolent a message ; and I asked the man, who bade him 
deliver that message to me ? He told me the coxswain. I 
said no more to the fellow, but bade him let them know he 



EOBINSON CKUSOE. 317 

had delivered his message, and that I had given him no 

answer to it. 

I immediately went and found out the supercargo, and told 
him the story, adding, what I presently foresaw, that there 
would be a mutiny in the ship ; and entreated him to go im- 
mediately on board the ship in an Indian boat, and acquaint 
the captain of it. But I might have spared this intelligence, 
for before I had spoken to him on shore, the matter was 
effected on board. The boatswain, the gunner, the carpenter, 
and all the inferior officers, as soon as I was gone off in the 
boat, came up, and desired to speak with the captain ; and 
there the boatswain, making a long harangue, told the captain 
in a few words, that as I was now gone peaceably on shore, 
they were loth to use any violence with me, which, if I had 
not gone on shore, they would otherwise have done, to oblige 
me to have gone. They therefore thought fit to tell him, 
that as they shipped themselves to serve in the ship under his 
command, they would perform it well and faithfully ; but if 
I would not quit the ship, or the captain oblige me to quit it, 
they would all leave, and sail no farther with him ; and at 
that word all, he turned his face towards the mainmast, which 
was, it seems, the signal agreed on between them, at which, 
the seamen, being got together there, cried out, " One and 
all ! one and all!" 

My nephew, the captain, was a man of spirit, and of great 
presence of mind ; and though he was surprised at the thing, 
yet he told them calmly that he would consider of the matter ; 
but that he could do nothing in it till he had spoken to me. 
He used some arguments with them, to show the unreason- 
ableness and injustice of the thing; but it was all in vain; 
they swore, and shook hands round before his face, that they 
would all go on shore, unless he would engage not to suffer 
mo to come any more on board the ship. 

This was hard upon him, who knew his obligation to me, 
and did not know how I might take it ; so he began to talk 
smartly to them ; told them that I was a very considerable- 
owner of the ship, and that, in justice, he could not put me 
out of my own house ; that let them go into what ship they 
would, if ever they came to England again, it would cost 
them very dear ; that the ship was mine, and that he could 
not put me out of it ; and that he would rather lose the ship 



318 KOBINSON CRUSOE. 

and the voyage too, than disoblige me so much ; so thev 
might do as they pleased. However, he would go on shore 
and talk with me, and invited the boatswain to go with him, 
and perhaps they might accommodate the matter with me. 
But they all rejected the proposal, and said they would have 
nqtjigog to do with me any more ; and if I came on board, 
thdp^rould all go on shore. "Well," said the captain, "if 
you' atfe all of this mind, let me go on shore and talk with 
him." So away he came to me with this account, a little 
after the message had been brought to me from the coxswain. 

I was very glad to see my nephew, I must confess ; for I 
was not without apprehensions that they would confine him 
by violence, set sail, and run away with the ship ; and then 
I had been stripped naked in a remote country, having nothing 
to help myself. But they had not come to that length, it 
seems ; and when my nephew told me what they had said to 
him, and how they had sworn and shook hands that they 
would, one and all, leave the ship, if I was suffered to come on 
board, I told him he should not be concerned at it at all, for 
I would stay on shore. I only desired he would take care and 
send me all my necessary things on shore, and leave me a 
sufficient sum of money, and I would find my way to England 
as well as I could. 

This was a heavy piece of news to my nephew, but there 
was no way to help it ; so, in short, he went on board the 
ship again, and satisfied the men that his uncle had yielded 
to their importunity, and had sent for his goods from on board 
the ship ; so that the matter was over in a few hours, the men 
returned to their duty, and I began to consider what course 
I should steer. 

I was now alone in the most remote part of the world, as 
I think I may call it, for I was near three thousand leagues by 
sea farther off from England, than I was at my island ; only, 
it is true, I might travel here by land over the Great Mogul's 
country to Surat, might go from thence to Bassora by sea, up 
the Gulf of Persia, and take the way of the caravans, over the 
Desert of Arabia, to Aleppo and Scanderoon ; thence by sea 
again to Italy, and so overland into France ; and this put 
together, might at least be a full diameter of the globe or 
more. 

I had another way before me, which was to wait for some 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. Cl$ 

English ships, which were coming to Bengal from Achin, on 
the Island of Sumatra, and get passage on board them for 
England. But as I came hither without any concern with 
the East-India Company, so it would be difficult to go hence 
without their license, unless with great favour of the captains 
of the ships, or the company's factors ; and to both I was an 
titter stranger. 

Here I had the mortification to see the ship set sail with- 
out me ; however, my nephew left me two servants, or rather, 
one companion and one servant ; the first was clerk to the 
purser, whom he engaged to go with me, and the other was 
his own servant. I took also a good lodging in the house of 
an Englishwoman, where several merchants lodged. Here 
I was handsomely enough entertained ; and that I might not 
be said to run rashly upon anything, I stayed here above nine 
months, considering what course to take. I had some Eng- 
lish goods with me of value, and a considerable sum of money ; 
my nephew furnishing me with a thousand pieces-of-eight, 
and a letter of credit for more, if I had occasion, that I might 
not be straitened, whatever might happen. 

I quickly disposed of my goods to advantage ; and, as I 
originally intended, I bought here some very good diamonds, 
which, of all other things, were the most proper for me in my 
present circumstances, because I could always carry my whole 
estate about me. 

After a long stay here, and many proposals made for my 
return to England, the English merchant who lodged with me, 
and whom I had contracted an intimate acquaintance with, 
came to me one morning : " Countryman," says he, " I have a 
project to communicate to you, which, as it suits/ with my 
thoughts, may, for aught I know, suit with yours also, when 
you shall have thoroughly considered it. Here we are posted, 
you by accident, and I by choice, in a part of the world very 
remote from our own country ; but it is in a country where, 
by us, who understand trade and business, a great deal of 
money is to be got. If you will put one thousand pounds to 
my one thousand pounds, we will hire a ship, the first we can 
get to our minds ; you shall be captain, I'll be merchant, and 
we'll co a trading voyage to China ; for what should we stand 
still for?" 

I liked this proposal very well ; and the more s/< because it 



oZU ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

seemed to be expressed with so much good will, and in so 
friendly a manner. 

It was, however, some time before we could get a ship to 
our minds, and when we had got a vessel, it was not easy to 
get English sailors : that is to say, so many as were necessary 
to govern the voyage and manage the sailors which we should 
pick up there. After some time we got an English mate, a 
boatswain, and a gunner, a Dutch carpenter, and three fore- 
mast men. With these we found we could do well enough, 
having Indian seamen, such as they were, to make up. 

We made the voyage to Achin, in the island of Sumatra, 
and thence to Siam, where we exchanged some of our wares 
for opium and arrack ; we went up to Suskan, made a very 
good voyage, were eight months out, and returned to Bengal ; 
and I was very well satisfied with my adventure. 

I got so much money by my first adventure, and such an 
insight into the method of getting more, that had I been 
twenty years younger, I should have been tempted to have 
stayed here and sought no farther for making any fortune. 

My friend, who was always upon the search for business, 
proposed another voyage to me among the Spice Islands, and 
to bring home a loading of cloves from the Manillas, or there- 
abouts; places, indeed, where the Dutch trade, but islands 
belonging partly to the Spaniards ; though we went not so 
far, but to some other, where they have not the whole power, 
as they have at Batavia, Ceylon, etc. 

We were not long in preparing for this voyage ; the chief 
difficulty was in bringing me to come into it. However, at 
last, nothing else offering, and finding that really stirring 
about and trading, the profit being so great, had more plea- 
sure in it, and more satisfaction to my mind, than sitting still, 
which, to me especially, was the unhappiest part of my life, I 
resolved on this voyage too, which we made very successfully, 
touching at Borneo, and several islands, and came home in 
about five months. We sold our spice, which was chiefly 
cloves and nutmegs, to the Persian merchants, who carried 
them away to the gulf ; and making near five of one, we really 
got a great deal of money. 

But, to be short with my speculations, a little while after 
this there came in a Dutch ship from Batavia. She was a 
coaster, not a European trader, of about two hundred tons 



321 

burthen. The men, as they pretended, having been so sickly 
that the captain had not hands enough to go to sea with, he 
lay by at Bengal ; and having, it seems, got money enough, 
or being willing, for other reasons, to go for Europe, he gave 
public notice he would sell his ship. This came to my ears 
before my new partner heard of it, and I had a great mind to 
buy it ; so I went to him, and I told him of it. He con- 
sidered awhile, for he was no rash man ; but musing some 
time, he replied, "She is a little too big; but, however, we 
will have her." Accordingly, we bought the ship, and agree- 
ing with the master, we paid for her, and took possession. 
When we had done so, we resolved to engage the men, if we 
could, to join with those we had, for the pursuing our busi- 
ness ; but, on a sudden, they having received not their wages, 
but their share of the money, as we afterwards learned, not 
one of them was to be found. We inquired much about them, 
and at length were told that they were all gone together by land 
to Agra, the city of the great Mogul's residence, and thence to 
travel to Surat, and go by the sea to the Gulf of Persia. 

We picked up some Edglish sailors here after this, and some 
Dutch ; and now we resolved on a second voyage, for cloves, 
among the Philippine and Molucca Isles. 

In this voyage, being by contrary winds obliged to beat 
up and down a great while in the Straits of Malacca, and 
among the islands, we were no sooner get clear of those diffi- 
cult seas than we found our ship had sprung a leak, and we 
were not able, by all our industry, to find out where it was. 
This forced us to make some port, and my partner, who knew 
the country better than I did, directed the captain to put into 
the river of Cambodia. This river lies on the north side of 
the great bay or gulf which goes up to Siam. While we were 
here, and going often on shore for refreshment, there came to 
me one day an Englishman, a gunner's mate on board an 
English East India ship, which rode in the same river near the 
city of Cambodia. "Sir," says he, "you are a stranger to 
me, and I to you, but I have something to tell you that very 
nearly concerns you." 

I looked stedfastly at him a good while, and thought at 

first I had known him, but I did not. " If it very nearly 

concerns me," said I, " and not yourself, what moves you to 

tell it to me V "I am moved," savs he, "by the imminent 

21 



322 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

danger you are in, and, for aught I see, you have no know- 
ledge of it." He then went on to say, that we were supposed 
to be pirates; and that there were two large English and 
three Dutch ships lying up the river about live leagues, and 
that with the next tide they intended sending down all their 
large boats, and taking our vessel, and then hanging every 
one of us. 

On hearing this, we immediately ordered the anchor to be 
got up ; and though the tide was not quite down, yet a little 
land-breeze blowing, we stood out to sea. Before long, a 
seaman called out, that we were chased. " Chased !" says I ; 
" by what ?" " By five sloops, or boats," says the fellow, 
" full of men." " Very well," said I, " then it is apparent 
there is something in it." In the next place, I ordered all 
our men to be called up, and told them there was a design to 
seize the ship, and to take us for pirates, and asked them if 
they would stand by us, and by one another: the men 
answered cheerfully, one and all, that they would live and die 
with us. Then I asked the captain what way he thought best 
for us to manage a fight with them ; for resist them I was re- 
solved we would, and that to the last drop. He said readily, 
that the way was to keep them off with our great shot as long 
as we could, and then to fire at them with our small arms, to 
keep them from boarding us : but when neither of these would 
do any longer, we would retire to our close quarters ; perhaps 
they had not materials to break open our bulk-heads, or get 
in upon us. 

The gunner had, in the meantime, orders to bring two 
guns to bear fore and aft, out of the steerage, to clear the 
deck, and load them with musket-bullets and small pieces of 
old iron, and thus we made ready for fight ; but all this 
while we kept out to sea, with wind enough, and could see 
the boats at a distance, being five large long boats, following 
us with all the sail they could make. 

Two of these boats outsailed the rest, and endeavoured to 
come under our stern, so as to board us on our quarter ; 
upon which, seeing they were resolute for mischief, and de- 
pended upon the strength that followed them, I ordered to 
bring the ship to, so that they lay upon our broadside ; when 
immediately we fired five guns at them, one of which had 
been levelled so true as to carry away the stern of the 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 328 

hindermost boat, and bring them to the necessity of taking 
down their sail, and running all to the head of the boat, to 
keep her from sinking ; but the others came up one after the 
other, but we succeeded in beating them off and disabling 
them all, for that they had to lay by to refit ; we then 
crowded all the sail we could, and stood farther out to sea, 
and we found that they gave over their chase. 

Being thus delivered from this danger, my partner told me 
he would put me in on the coast of Cochin China, intending 
afterwards to go to Macao. We sailed for a little port called 
Quinchang, where the fathers of the mission usually landed 
from Macao, and where no European ships ever put in, but 
did not come to it for five days. When I set my foot on 
shore, I resolved never to set one foot on board that unhappy 
vessel more. When we came on shore, the old pilot got us a 
lodgiDg and a warehouse for our goods in that country. 

The fair, or mart, usually kept in this place, had been over 
some time: however, we found that there were three or four 
junks in the river, and two ships from Japan, with goods 
which they had bought in China, and were not gone away, 
having some Japanese merchants on shore. 

The first thing our old Portuguese pilot did for us was, to 
get us acquainted with three missionary Romish priests who 
were in the town. One of these was a Frenchman, whom 
they called Father Simon, who was courteous, easy in his 
manner, and very agreeable company ; the other two were 
more reserved. 

This French priest, Father Simon, was appointed to go up 
to Pekin, and waited only for another priest, who was ordered 
to come to him from Macao ; and we scarce ever met together 
but he was inviting me to go the journey with him ; and having, 
in course of time, disposed of our merchandise, and also the 
vessel to the Japanese merchant, I and my partner, with the 
old Portuguese pilot, set out with very good advantage, for 
we got leave to travel in the retinue of one of their mandarins. 

He was respected as a king, surrounded always with his 
gentlemen, and attended in all his appearances with such 
pomp, that I saw little of him but at a distance. But this I 
observed, that there was not a horse in his retinue but that 
our carriers' packhorses in England seemed to me to look 
much better; though it was hard to judge rightly, for they 



324 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

were so covered with equipage, mantles, trappings, &c, that 
we could scarce see anything but their feet and their heads 
as they went along. 

At length we arrived at Pekin. As for the Portuguese 
pilot, he being desirous to see the court, we bore his charges 
for his company, and to use him as an interpreter ; indeed, 
this old man was most useful to us everywhere, for we had 
not been above a week at Pekin, when he came and told us 
there was a great caravan of Muscovite and Polish merchants 
in the city, preparing to set out on their journey by land to 
Muscovy, within four or five weeks, and he was sure we 
would take the opportunity to go with them, and leave him 
behind, to go back alone. 

I confess I was greatly surprised with this good news. 
" How do you know this ?" said I : " are you sure it is true ?" 
" Yes," says he ; "I met this morning in the street an old 
acquaintance of mine, an Armenian, who is among them. 
He came last from Astracan, is now going with the caravan 
to Moscow, and so down the river Wolga to Astracan." 
" Well, Seignior," says I, " do not be uneasy about being left 
to go back alone; if this be a method for my return to 
England, it shall be your fault if you go back to Macao at 
all." We then went to consult what was to be done ; and 
we agreed that if our Portuguese pilot would go with us, we 
would bear his charges to Moscow, or to England, if he 
pleased ; nor, indeed, were we to be esteemed over-generous 
in that either, if we had not rewarded him farther, the service 
he had done us being really worth more than that ; for he 
had not only been a pilot to us at sea, but he had been like 
a broker for us on shore ; and his procuring for us the Japan 
merchant was some hundreds of pounds in our pockets. So 
we consulted together about it, and being willing to gratify 
him, which was but doing him justice, and very willing also 
to have him with us besides, for he was a most necessary man 
on all occasions, we agreed to give him a quantity of coined 
gold, which, as I compute it, came to about one hundred and 
seventy-five pounds sterling, between us, and to bear all his 
charges, both for himself and horse, except only a horse to 
carry his goods. Having settled this, we called him to let 
him know what we had resolved. I told him he had com- 
plained of our being willing to let him go back alone, and I 



.UUi>±liOUi\ ^-LXUOUH.. 



was now about to tell him we were resolved lie should not go 
back at all. That as we had resolved to go to Europe with 
the caravan, he also should go with us ; and that we called 
him to know his mind. He shook his head, and said it was a 
long journey, and that he had no pecune to carry him thither, 
or to subsist himself when he came there. We told him we 
believed it was so, and therefore we had resolved to do some- 
thing for him that should let him see how sensible we were 
of his services, and how agreeable he was to us ; and then I 
told him what we had resolved to give him here, which he 
might lay out as we would do our own : and that as for his 
charges, if he would go with us we would set him safe on 
shore either in Muscovy or England, which he would, at our 
own charge, except only the carriage of his goods. He re- 
ceived the proposal like a man transported, and told us he 
would go with us over the whole world ; and so we all 
prepared for our journey. 

It was the beginning of February, our style, when we set 
out from Pekin. The company was very great, and, as near 
as I can remember, made between three and four hundred 
horse, and upwards of one hundred and twenty men, very 
well armed, and provided for all events ; for as the eastern 
caravans are subject to be attacked by the Arabs, so are these 
by the Tartars ; but they are not altogether so dangerous as 
the Arabs, nor so barbarous when they prevail. 

The company consisted of people of several nations ; but 
there were above sixty of them merchants or inhabitants of 
Moscow, though some of them were Livonians ; and to our 
particular satisfaction, five were Scots, who appeared also to 
be men of great experience in business, and of very good 
substance. 

We travelled near a month still in the dominions of the 
Emperor of China, but lay for the most part in the villages, 
some of which were fortified, because of the incursions of the 
Tartars. 

We wanted above two days' journey of the city of Naum, 
when messengers were sent express to every part of the road 
to tell all travellers and caravans to halt till they had a guard 
sent for them ; for that an unusual body of Tartars, making 
ten thousand in all, had appeared in the way, about thirty 
miles beyond the city. 



326 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

This was very bad news; however, it was carefully done of 
the governor, and we were very glad to hear we should have 
a guard. Accordingly, two days after, we had two hundred 
soldiers sent us from a garrison of the Chinese, on our left, 
and three hundred more from the city of Naum, and with 
these we advanced boldly ; the three hundred soldiers from 
Naum marched in our front, the two hundred in our rear, and 
our men on each side of our camels, with our baggage, and 
the whole caravan in the centre ; in this order, and well pre- 
pared for battle, we thought ourselves a match for the whole 
ten thousand Mogul Tartars, if they had appeared ; but the 
next day, when they did appear, it was quite another thing. 

It was early in the morning, when, marching fro.m a well- 
situated little town, called Changu, we had a river to pass, 
which we were obliged to ferry ; and, had the Tartars had 
any intelligence, then had been the time to have attacked us, 
when the caravan being over, the rear guard was behind ; but 
they did not appear there. About three hours after, when 
we were entered upon a desert of about fifteen or sixteen 
miles over, behold, by a cloud of dust they raised, we saw an 
enemy was at hand : and they were at hand indeed, for they 
came on upon the spur. 

The Chinese, our guard in the front, who had talked so big 
the day before, began to stagger ; and the soldiers frequently 
looked behind them, which is a certain sign in a soldier that 
he is just ready to run away. My old pilot was of my mind; 
and being near me, called out, " Seignior Inglese," says he, 
" those fellows must be encouraged, or they will ruin us all ; 
for if the Tartars come on they will never stand it." " I am 
of your mind," said I; "but what must be done?" "Done!" 
says he, " let fifty of our men advance, and flank them on 
each wing, and encourage them ; and they will fight like 
brave fellows in brave company ; but without this, they will 
every man turn his back." Immediately, I rode up to our 
leader, and told him, who was exactly of our mind ; and ac- 
cordingly fifty of us marched to the right wing, and fifty 
to the left, and the rest made a line of rescue ; and so wo 
marched, leaving the last two hundred men to make a body 
by themselves, and to guard the camels ; only that, if need 
were, they should send a hundred men to assist the last 
fifty. 



327 

In a word, the Tartars came on, and an innumerable com- 
pany they were : how many we could not tell, but ten thou- 
sand, we thought, was the least ; a party of them came on first 
and viewed our posture, traversing the ground in the front of 
our line : and, as we found them within gunshot, our leader 
ordered the two wings to advance swiftly, and give them a 
salvo on each wing with their shot, which was done ; and they 
went off, I suppose, back, to give an account of the reception 
they were like to meet with ; and, indeed, that salute cloyed 
their stomachs, for they immediately halted, stood awhile to 
consider of it, and wheeling off to the left, they gave over 
their design, and said no more to us for that time. 

Two days after, we came to the city of Naum ; we thanked 
the governor for his care of us, and collected to the value of 
a hundred crowns, or thereabouts, which we gave to the sol- 
diers sent to guard us : and here we rested one day. 

After this, we passed several great rivers, and two dreadful 
deserts; one of which we were sixteen days passing over, 
and which, as I said, was to be called no man's land ; and, on 
the 13th of April, we came to the frontiers of the Muscovite 
dominions. I think the first town or fortress, whichever it 
may be called, that belonged to the Czar of Muscovy, was 
called Arguna, being on the west side of the river Arguna. 

Some leagues to the north of this river, there are several 
considerable rivers, whose streams run as due north as the 
Yamour runs east, and these are all found to join their waters 
with the great river Tartarus, named so from the northern- 
most nations of the Mogul Tartars ; who, as the Chinese say, 
were the first Tartars in the world ; and who, as our geo- 
graphers allege, are the Gog and Magog mentioned in sacred 
history. These rivers running all northward, as well as all 
the other rivers I am yet to speak of, make it evident that 
the northern ocean bounds the land also on that side ; so that 
it does not seem rational in the least to think that the land 
can extend itself to join with America on that side, or that 
there is not a communication between the northern and 
eastern ocean : but of this I shall say no more ; it was my 
observation at that time, and therefore I take notice of it in 
this place. 

We now advanced from the river Arguna by easy and 
moderate journeys, and were very visibly obliged to the care 



328 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

the Czar of Muscovy has taken to have cities and towns built 
in as many places as it is possible to place them, where his 
soldiers keep garrison, something like the stationary soldiers 
placed by the Romans in the remotest countries of their 
empire ; some of which I had read of were placed in Britain, 
for the security of commerce, and for the lodging travellers : 
and thus it was here ; for wherever we came, though at these 
towns and statons the garrisons and governors were Russians 
and professed Christians, yet the inhabitants were mere 
pagans. 

Our caravan rested three nights at the town called Nor- 
triousky, in order to provide some horses, several having been 
lamed and jaded with the badness of the way and long march 
over the last desert. 

From this city we had a frightful desert, which held us 
twenty-three days' march. "We furnished ourselves with 
some tents here, for the better accommodating ourselves in 
the night ; and the leader of the caravan procured sixteen 
carriages or waggons of the country, for carrying our water 
or provisions ; and these carriages were our defence, every 
night round our little camp : so that had the Tartars ap- 
peared, unless they had been very numerous indeed, they 
would not have been able to hurt us. 

We may well be supposed to have wanted rest again after 
this long journey ; for in this desert we neither saw house 
nor tree, and scarce a bush ; though we saw abundance of 
the sable hunters, who are all Tartars of the Mogul Tartary, 
of which this country is a part ; and they frequently attack 
small caravans, but we saw no numbers of them together. 

After we had passed this desert, we came into a country 
pretty well inhabited ; we found towns and castles, settled by 
the Czar of Muscovy, with garrisons of stationary soldiers, to 
protect the caravans, and defend the country against the 
Tartars, who would otherwise make it very dangerous tra- 
velling; and his czarish majesty has given such strict orders 
for the well guarding the caravans and merchants, that, if 
there are any Tartars heard of in the country, detachments 
of the garrison are always sent to see the travellers safe from 
station to station. And thus the governor of Adinskoy, whom 
I had an opportunity to make a visit to, by means of the 
Scots merchant, who was acquainted with him, offered us a 



ROBLN'aOl-J CBUoOE. 029 

guard of fifty men, if we thought there was any danger, to 
the next station. 

I thought long before this, that as we came nearer to 
Europe, we should find the country better inhabited, and the 
people more civilized : but I found myself mistaken in both ; 
for we had yet the nation of the Tongueses to pass through, 
where we saw the same tokens of paganism and barbarity. 

If the Tartars had their Cham Chi-Thaungu for a whole 
village or country, these had idols in every hut and every 
cave : besides, they worship the stars, the sun, the water, the 
snow, and, in a word, everything they do not understand, and 
they understand but very little ; so that every element, every 
uncommon thing, sets them sacrificing. I met with nothing 
peculiar myself in all this country, which I reckon was from 
the desert I spoke of last at least four hundred miles, half of 
it being another desert, which took us up twelve days' severe 
travelling, without house or tree ; and we were obliged again 
to carry our own provisions, as well water as bread. After 
we were out of this desert, and had travelled two days, we 
came to Janezay, a Muscovite city or station on the great 
river Janezay, which, they told us there, parted Europe from 
Asia. 

Here I observed ignorance and paganism still prevailed, 
except in the Muscovite garrisons ; all the country between 
the river Oby and the river Janezay is as entirely pagan, and 
the people as barbarous, as the remotest of the Tartars ; nay, 
as any nation, for aught I know, in Asia or America. 

From this river to the great river Oby, we crossed a wild 
uncultivated country, barren of people and good management, 
otherwise it is in itself a most pleasant, fruitful, and agreeable 
country. What inhabitants we found in it are all pagans, 
except such as are sent among them from Eussia : for this is 
the country — I mean on both sides the river Oby — whither 
the Muscovite criminals that are not put to death are banished, 
and from whence it is next to impossible they should ever 
get away. 

I have nothing material to say of my particular. affairs till 
I came to Tobolski, the capital city of Siberia, where I con- 
tinued some time on the following account. 

We had now been almost seven months on our journey, 
and winter began to come on apace ; whereupon my partner 



330 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

and I called a council about our particular affairs, in which 
we found it proper, as we were bound for England, and not 
for Moscow, to consider how to dispose of ourselves. They 
told us of sledges and reindeer to carry us over the snow in 
the winter time ; and, indeed, they have such things that it 
would be incredible to relate the particulars of, by which 
means the Russians travel more in winter than they can in 
summer, as in these sledges they are able to run night and 
day ; the snow, being frozen, is one universal covering to 
nature, by which the hills, vales, rivers, and lakes are all 
smooth and hard as a stone, and they run upon the surface, 
without any regard to what is underneath. 

But I had no occasion to urge a winter journey of this 
kind ; I was bound to England, not to Moscow, and my route 
lay two ways : either I must go on as the caravan went, till I 
came to Jaroslaw, and then go off west for Narva, and the 
Gulf of Finland, and so on to Dantzic, where I might possibly 
sell my China cargo to good advantage ; or I must leave the 
caravan at a little town on the Dwina, from whence I had 
but six days by water to Archangel, and from thence might 
be sure of shipping either to England, Holland, or Hamburgh. 

Now to go any of these journeys in the winter would have 
been preposterous ; for as to Dantzic, the Baltic would have 
been frozen tip, and I could not get passage ; and to go by 
iand in those countries was far less safe than among the 
Mogul Tartars ; likewise, to go to Archangel in October, all 
the ships would be gone from thence, and even the merchants 
who dwell there in summer retire south to Moscow in the 
winter, when the ships are gone ; so that I could have nothing 
but extremity of cold to encounter, with a scarcity of pro- 
visions, and must lie in an empty town all the winter ; so 
■that, upon the whole, I thought it much my better way to 
let the caravan go, and make provision to winter where I 
was, at Tobolski, in Siberia, in the latitude of about sixty 
degrees, where I was sure of three things to wear out a cold 
winter with, viz., plenty of provisions, such as the country 
afforded, a warm house, with fuel enough, and excellent 
company. 

I had been here eight months, and a dark, dreadful winter 
I thought it ; the cold so intense that I could not so much 
as look abroad without being wrapped in furs, and a mask of 



KUiilJNSUJN (JKUSUE.

fur before my face, or rather a hood, with only a hole for 
breath, and two for sight : the little daylight we had was, as 
we reckoned, for three months not above five hours a day, 
and six at most ; only that the snow lying on the ground 
continually, and the weather being clear, it was never quite 
dark. Our horses were kept, or rather starved, under grounds ; 
and as for our servants, whom we hired here to look after 
ourselves and horses, we had, every now and then, their 
fingers and toes to thaw and take care of, lest they should 
mortify and fall off. 

It was now March, the days grown considerably longer, 
and the weather at least tolerable ; so the other travellers 
began to prepare sledges to carry them over the snow, and 
to get things ready to be going; but my measures being 
fixed for Archangel, and not for Muscovy or the Baltic, I 
made no motion ; knowing very well that the ships from the 
south do not set out for that part of the world till May or 
June, and that if I was there by the beginning of August, it 
would be as soon as any ships would be ready to go away ; 
and therefore I made no haste to be gone, as others did : in 
a word, I saw all the travellers go away before me. It seems 
every year they go from thence to Muscovy for trade, to 
carry furs, and buy necessaries, which they bring back with 
them to furnish their shops : also others went on the same 
errand to Archangel ; but then they all being to come back 
again above eight hundred miles, went out before me. 

It was the beginning of June when I left this remote place ; 
a city, I believe, little heard of in the world ; and, indeed, 
it is so far out of the road of commerce, that I know not how 
it should be much talked of. We were now reduced to a 
very small caravan, having only thirty-two horses and camels. 
We had here the worst and the largest desert to pass 
over that we met with in our whole journey; I call it 
the worst, because the way was very deep in some places, 
and very uneven in others ; the best we had to say for it 
was, that we thought we had no troops of Tartars or robbers 
to fear, and that they never came on this side the river Oby, 
or at least very seldom ; but we found it otherwise. 

We had just entered Europe, having passed the River Kama, 
which in these parts is the boundary between Europe and 
Asia, and the first city on the European side was called Soloy 



332 ROBINSON CRUSOE, 

Kamskoi, which is as much as to say, the great city on the 
Eiver Kama ; and here we thought" to see some evident alte- 
ration in the people ; but we were mistaken ; for as we had 
a vast desert to pass, which is near seven hundred miles long 
in some places, but not above two hundred miles over where 
we passed it, so, till we came past that horrible place, we found 
very little difference between that country and the Mogul 
Tartary. The people are mostly pagans, and little better than 
the savages of America ; their houses and towns full of idols, 
and their way of living wholly barbarous, except in the cities, 
and the villages near them, where they are Christians of the 
Greek Church. 

A. few days more we came to Veuslima upon the Eiver 
Wirtzogda, and running into the Dwina. We were there, 
very happily, near the end of our travels by land, that river 
being navigable, in seven days' passage, to Archangel. From 
hence, we came to Lawrenskoy, the 3rd of July ; and pro- 
viding ourselves with two luggage boats, and a barge for our 
own convenience, we embarked the 7th, and arrived all safe 
at Archangel the 18th ; having been a year, five months, and 
three days on the journey, including our stay of eight months 
at Tobolski. We were obliged to stay at this place six weeks 
for the arrival of the ships, 'and must have tarried longer, had 
not a Hamburgher come in above a month sooner than any of 
the English ships. 

We then set sail from Archangel the 20th of August, the 
same year ; and, after no extraordinary bad voyage, arrived 
safe in the Elbe the 18th of September. 

To conclude, having stayed near four months in Hamburgh, 
I came thence by land to the Hague, where I embarked in the 
packet, and arrived in London the 10th of January, 1705, 
having been absent from England ten years and nine months. 
And here I resolved to prepare for a longer journey than all 
these, having lived a life of infinite variety seventy-two years, 
and learned sufficiently to know the value of retirement, and 
the blessings of ending my days in peace.
