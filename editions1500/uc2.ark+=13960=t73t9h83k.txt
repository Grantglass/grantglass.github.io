 THIS primary work is designed for small children, 
 and as an easy introduction to the " Progressive Intel- 
 lectual Arithmetic," for advanced classes. 
 
 Its object is to lead the young pupil, by brief and 
 simple processes, applied to practical examples of easy 
 gradation, to acquire habits of thought and of reasoning, 
 in their simplest forms, and to draw out and strengthen 
 the mind by a progressive and almost imperceptible gra- 
 dation of thought and expression. 
 
 The operations of Adding and Subtracting, of Multi- 
 plying and Dividing, are first shown by pictorial objects ; 
 portions of the elementary tables are introduced at the 
 commencement of each lesson, and applied to short ex- 
 amples concerning familiar objects ; promiscuous reviews 
 of the elementary tables, and the more simple and easy 
 Denominate tables have been introduced. Fractions 
 have been treated as far as was thought practicable 
 in a work of this kind. 
 
 It is confidently believed that the progressive and 
 systematic arrangement, the simplicity and adaptation 
 to the juvenile mind, the typography and general attrac- 
 tiveness of this little book, will insure for it abundant 
 success.

SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS. 
 
 1. A TEACHER should have a particular time allotted 
 to every exercise, and regular lessons should be assigned, 
 to be recited each day at a specified hour. 
 
 2. Sufficient time being given the pupils to learn 
 their lessons, they should not be allowed the use of the 
 book at the time of recitation. 
 
 3. The teacher should first ascertain that the table is 
 thoroughly learned by every pupil in the class. 
 
 4. Each question should be slowly and distinctly read, 
 and the pupils be called upon promiscuously ; the pupil 
 called upon should stand erect, repeat the question, and 
 then give the solution. This will require close attention. 
 
 5. A correct and uniform analysis of each question 
 should be required from every pupil. 
 
 6. The class should be encouraged to detect and cor- 
 rect errors in the statement and solution of questions, to 
 be signified by raising the hand. 
 
 7. The teacher can extend the questions in each les- 
 son at pleasure, either by repeating those given, or 
 making additional ones.

 REMARK. This lesson presents the printed and 
 written figures, and the Roman letters, by which num- 
 bers are commonly expressed. It should be carefully 
 studied by children, until they can read the figures with 
 facility when written on the black-board, or when they 
 meet with them in books.

 PROMISCUOUS EXAMPLES. 
 
 1. When flour is 7 dollars a barrel, how 
 many barrels can be bought for 63 dollars ] 
 
 ANALYSIS. Since 7 dollars will buy I barrel, 63 
 dollars will buy as many barrels as 7 dollars, the price 
 of 1 barrel, is contained times in 63 dollars, which are

 dollars a yard ? 
 
 ANALYSTS. As many tons of hay at 6 dollars a ton, 
 as 6 dollars, the price of a ton, is contained times in 
 8 times 3 dollars, or 24 dollars, the cost of the broad- 
 cloth, which are 4 times. TJterefore 4 tons of hay, at 
 6 dollars a ton, will pay for 8 yards of broadcloth, at 3 
 dollars a yard.

 will cost as mang cents as 7 is contained times in 28, 
 which is 4 times ; 3 oranges, which are 3 times 1 orange, 
 will cost 3 times 4 cents, or 12 cents. Therefore^ if 7 
 oranges cost 28 cents, 3 oranges will cost 12 cents.

 ANALYSIS. She kept as many pinks as the difference 
 between 15 pinks and the sum of 6 pinks and 4 pinks ; 
 6 and 4 are 10, and 10 from 15 leaves 5. Therefore, 
 if Isabel had 15 pinks, and gave away 10, she had 5 left. 
 
 2. Lucian, having 20 marbles, gave 9 to 
 Henry, and 6 to John ; how many had he 
 left!
