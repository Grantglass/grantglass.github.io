AUTHOR'S PREFACE 
 
 If ever the story of any private man's adventures in 
 the world were worth making public, and were accept- 
 able when published, the Editor of this account thinks 
 this will be so. 
 
 The wonders of this man's life exceed all that (he 
 thinks) is to be found extant; the life of o > man 
 being scarce capable of a greater variety. 
 
 The story is told with modesty, with seriousness, 
 and with a religious application of events to the uses 
 to which wise men always apply them, viz., to the in- 
 struction of others by this example, and to justify and 
 honour the wisdom of Providence in all the variety of 
 our circumstances, let them happen how they will. 
 
 The Editor believes the thing to be a just history of 
 fact i neither is there any appearance of fiction in it ; 
 and, however, thinks, because all such things are de- 
 spatched, that the improvement of it, as well to the 
 diversion as to the instruction of the reader, will be 
 the same. And as such, he thinks, without further 
 compliment to the world, he does them a great service 
 lin the publication.

 THE 
 
 LIFE AND ADVENTLTRES 
 
 OF 
 
 of 
 
 ROBINSON CRUSOE 
 
 I WAS born in the year 1632, in the city o' York 
 good family, though not of that country, my father 
 Semg a foreigner of Bremen, who setUed^firsTit Hull 
 He got a good estate by merchandise, and leaving off 
 i^ ^'^^'.J^''^ afterward at York, from whenci he 
 had married my mother, whose r lations were named 
 
 from whom I was caUed Robinson Kreutznaer ; but by 
 the usual corruption of words in England we are now 
 cdled, uay we call ourselves, and wrLontJ^me 
 Crusoe, and so my companions always called me. ' 
 
 I had two e' 'er brothers, one of which was Ha., 
 
 Fwlr^r' ? ^° ^"^''^^ regiment of ?oot7n 
 Flandew, formerly commanded by the famous Colonel 
 Lockhart and was killed at the battle n^r Dunk?rk 
 agamst the Spaniards; what became of my s^onl 
 
 motwi.°r' '^"r^'^^y "^ore than myTthr^d 
 mother did know what was become of me.

 2 ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 
 
 goes, and designed me for the law ; but I would be 
 satisfied with nothing but going to sea ; and my in- 
 clination to this led me so strongly against the will, 
 nay, the commands, of my father, and against all the 
 entreaties and persuasions of my mother and other 
 friends, that there seemed to be something fatal in that 
 propension of nature tending directly to the life of 
 misery which was to befall me. 
 
 My father, a wise and grave man, gave me serious 
 and excellent counsel against what he foresaw was my 
 design. He called me one morning into his chamber, 
 where he was a nfined by the gout, and expostulated 
 very warmly with me upon this subject. He asked me 
 what reasons more than a mere wandering inclination 
 I had for leaving mv father's house and my native 
 country, where I might be well introduced; and had a 
 prospect of raising my fortunes by application and in- 
 dustry, with a lire of ease and pleasure. He told me 
 it was for men of desperate fortunes on one hand, or 
 of aspiring, superior fortunes on the otber, who went 
 abroad upon adventures, to rise by enterprise, and make 
 themselves famous in undertakings of a nature out of 
 the common road ; that these things were all either too 
 far above me, or too far below me ; that mine was the 
 middle state, or what might be called the upper station 
 of low life, which he had found by long experience 
 was the best state in the world, the most suited to 
 human happiness, not exposed to the miseries and hard- 
 ships, the labour and sufferings, of the mechanic part of 
 mankind, and not embarrassed with the pride, luxury, 
 ambition, and envy of the upper part of mankind. He 
 told me I might judge of the happiness of this state 
 by this one thing, viz., that this was the state of life 
 which all other people envied ; that kings have fre- 
 quently lamented the miserable consequences of being 
 bom to great things, and wished they bad been placed 
 in the middle of the two extremes, between the mean 
 and the great ; that the wise man gave his t^timony 
 to this as the just standard of true felicity, when he 
 prayed to have neither poverty or riches. 
 
 
 He bid me observe it, and I should always find, 
 that the calamities of life were shared among the upper 
 and lower part of manlcind ; but that the middle station 
 had the fewest disasters, and was not exposed to so 
 many vicissitudes as the higher or lower part of man- 
 kind. Nay, they were not subjected to so many 
 distempers and uneasinesses either of body or mind 
 as those were who, by vicious living, luxury, and ex- 
 travagances on one hand, or by hard labour, want of 
 necessaries, and mean or insufficient diet on the other 
 hand, bring distempers upon themselves by the natural 
 consequences of their way of living ; that the middle 
 station of life was calculated for all kind of virtues and 
 all kind of enjoyments ; that peace and plenty were 
 the handmaids of a middle fortune ; that temperance, 
 moderation. Quietness, health, society, all agreeable 
 diversions, and all desirable pleasures, were the blessings 
 attending the middle station of life ; that this way men 
 went silently and smoothly through the world, and 
 comfortably out of it, not embarrassed with the labours 
 of the hands or of the head, not sold to the life of 
 slavery for daily bread, or harassed with perplexed 
 circumstances, which rob the soul of peace, and the 
 body of rest ; not enraged with the passion of envy, or 
 secret burning lust of ambition for great things ; but in 
 easy circumstances sliding gently through the world 
 and sensibly tasting the sweets of living, without the 
 bitter, feeling that they are happy, and learning by 
 every day's experience to know it more sensibly. 
 
 After this, he pressed me earnestly, and in the most 
 affectionate manner, not to play the young man, not to 
 precipitate myself into miseries which Nature and the 
 station of life I was bom in seemed to have provided 
 against ; that I was under no necessity of seeking my 
 bread ; that he would do well for me, and endeavour to 
 enter me fairly into the station of life which he had been 
 just recommending to me ; and that if I was not very 
 easy and happy in the world it must be my mere fete 
 or feult that must hinder it, and that he should have 
 nothmg to answer for, having thus discharged his duty 
 
 
 4 ADVENTURES OP ROBINSON CRUSOE 
 
 in warning me against measures which he knew would 
 be to mv hurt; in a word, that as he would do very kind 
 things for me if I would stay and settle at home as he 
 directed, so he would not have so much hand in my 
 misfortunes, as to give me any encouragement to go 
 away. And to close all, he told me 1 had my elder 
 brother for an example, to whom he had used the same 
 earnest persuasions to keep him from going into the Low 
 Country wars, but could not prevail, his young desires 
 prompting him to run into the army, where he was 
 killed ; and though he said he would not cease to pray 
 for me, yet he would venture to say to me, that if I 
 did take this foolish step, God would not bless me, and 
 I would have leisure hereafter to reflect upon having 
 neglected his counsel when there might be none to 
 assist in my recovery. 
 
 I observed in this last part of his discourse, which 
 was truly prophetic, though I suppose my &ther did 
 not know it to be so himseu— I say, I observed the tears 
 run down his face very plentifully, and especially when 
 he spoke of my brother who was killed ; and that when 
 he spoke of my having leisure to repent, and none to 
 assist me, he was so moved, that he oroke off the dis- 
 course, and told me, his heart was so full he could say 
 no more to me. 
 
 I was sincerely affected wHh this discourse, as indeed 
 who could be otherwise? and I resolved not to think 
 of going abroad any more, but to settle at home accord- 
 ing to my father's desire. But alas ! a few days wore 
 it all off ; and, in short, to prevent any of my father's 
 &rther importunities, in a few weeks after I resolved 
 to run quite away from him. However, I did not act so 
 hastily neither as my first heat of resolution prompted, 
 but I took my mother, at a time when I thought her 
 a little pleasanter than ordinary, and told her, that my 
 thoughts were so entirely bent upon seeing the world, 
 that I should never settle to anything with resolution 
 enough to go through with it, and my father had 
 better give me his consent than force me to go without 
 it ; that I was now eighteen years old, which was too 
 
 
 Ute to go apprentiM to a trade, or clerk to an attorney: 
 that I was sure if I did, 1 should never nerve out my 
 time, and I should certainly run away from my master 
 before my time was out, and go to .ea ; and if the 
 would apeak to my fiither to let me go but one voyaire 
 abroad, if I came home again and did not like it/I 
 would go no more, and I would promise by a double 
 d"'gence to recover that time I had lost 
 
 lliis put my mother into a great passion. She told 
 me, she knew it would be to no purpose to speak to my 
 fawher upon any such subject ; that he knew too well 
 what was my interest to rive his consent to anythimrto 
 much for my hurt, and that she wondered how I could 
 think of any such thing after such a discourse as I had 
 had with my fether, and such kind and tender expree- 
 sious as she knew my father had used to me ; and that, 
 m short, if I would ruin myself there was no help for 
 me ; but I might depend I should never have their 
 consent to it ; that for her part, she would not have so 
 much hand in my destruction, and I should never have 
 It to say, that my mother was willing when my father 
 was not ' 
 
 Though my mother refused to move it to my father, 
 yet, as I have heard afterwards, she reported all the 
 discourse to him, and that my father, after showing a 
 
 might be happy if he would stay at home, but if he goea 
 abroad he wiD be the miserablest wretch that was ever 
 bom : 1 can give no consent to it' 
 
 It was not tiU almost a year after this that I broke 
 loose, though in ^he meanUme I continued obstinately 
 deaf to all proposals of setUing to business, and fre- 
 quently expostulating with my father and mother about 
 their be.ig so positively determined against what they 
 A^^ZJ^Z 'f,<^^'°at'on8 prompted me to. But being one 
 day at Hull, where I went casually, and without any 
 Durposo of making an elopement that time ; but I say. 
 being there, and one of my companions being going Sy 
 Jf J? ^i^?u' ^ 1^ « ^t»»er'8 ship, and prompting mj 
 to go with them, with the common aUurement of sea. 
 
 
 fiiring men, rii., that it ihould cost me nothing fbr mj 
 passage, 1 consulted neither father or mother any more, 
 nor so much aa sent them word of it ; hut leaving them 
 to hear of it as they might, without aslcing God's 
 blessing, or my father s, without any consideration of 
 circumstances or conseauences, and in an ill hour, God 
 knows, on the first or September, 1651, 1 went on 
 board a ship bound for London. Never any young 
 adventurer's misfortunes, I believe, began sooner, or 
 continued longer than mine. The ship was no sooner 
 gotten out of the Humber, but the wind began to blow, 
 and the waves to rise in a most frightful manner ; and 
 as I had never been at sea before, I was most inex- 
 ^ ressiblv siclc in body, and terrified in my mind. I began 
 now seriously to reflect upon what I had done, and how 
 justly I was overtaken by the judgment of heaven for 
 my wicked leaving my father's house, and abandoning 
 my duty ; all the good counsel of mv parents, my 
 fether's tears and my mother's entreaties, came now 
 fresh into my mind, and my conscience, which was 
 not yet come to the pitch of hardness which it has 
 been since, reproached me with the contempt of advice, 
 and the breacn of my duty to God and my father. 
 
 All this while the storm increased, and the sea, 
 wh'ch I had never been upon before, went very high, 
 th ugh nothing like what I have seen many times 
 since ; no, nur like what I saw a few days after. But 
 it was enough to affect me then, who was but a young 
 sailor, and had never known anything of the matter. 
 I expected every wave would have swallowed us up, 
 and tliat every time the ship fell down, as I thought, 
 in the trough or hollow of the sea, we should never 
 rise more ; and in this agony of mind I made many vows 
 and resolutions, that if it would please God here to 
 spare my life this one voyage, if ever I got once my foot 
 upon dry laud again, I would go directly home to my 
 father, and never set it into a ship again while I lived ; 
 that 1 would take his advice, and never run myself into 
 such miseries as these any more. Now I saw plainly 
 the goodness of his observations about the middle 
 
 
 •tation of life, how «My, how comfortably he had lived 
 all his days, and nerer had been exposed to tempetti 
 at lea, or trouble* on shore; and I resolved that I 
 would, like a true repenting prodigal, go home to my 
 father. 
 
 These wise and sober thoughts continued all the 
 while the storm continued, and indeed some time 
 after ; but the next day the wind was abated and the 
 sea calmer, and I beg»n to be a little inured to it 
 However, I was very grave for all that day, being also 
 a little sea-sick still ; but towards night the weather 
 cleared up, the wind i»as quite over, and a charming 
 fine evening followed ; the sun went down perfectly 
 clear, and rose so the next morning ; and having little 
 or no wind, and a smooth sea, the sun shining upon it, 
 the sight was, as 1 thought, the most delightful that 
 ever 1 saw. 
 
 I bad slept well in the night, and was now no more 
 sea-sick but very cheerful, looking with wonder 'ipon 
 the sea that was so rough and terrible the day before, 
 and could be so calm and so pleasant in so little time 
 after. And now lert my good resolutions should con- 
 tinue, my companion, who had indeed enticed me 
 away, comes to me : * Well, Bob," says he, clcppin*^ 
 me on the shoulder, 'how do you do after it? 1 
 warrant you were flighted, wa'n't vou, last night, when 
 it blew but a capful of wind }^ 'A capftil, d'you 
 call it?' said I; ''twas a terrible storm.' 'A storm, 
 vou fool you,' replies he ; 'do you call that a 8toni.> 
 Why, it was nothing at all ; give us but a good ship 
 and sea-room, and we think nothing of such a squall 
 of wind as that ; but you're but a f. 3sh-water sailor. 
 Bob. Come, let us make a bowl of punch, and we'll 
 forget all tliat ; dye see what charming weather 'tis 
 now.''' To -nake short this sad part of my story, we 
 went the old way of all sailors ; the punch was made, 
 and 1 was made drunk with it, and in that one night's 
 wickedness 1 drowned all my repentance, all my re- 
 flections upon my past conduct, and all my resolutions 
 for my future. In a word, as the sea was returned to 
 
 
 i 
 
 
 its imoothness of surface and settled calmness by the 
 abatement of that storm, so the hurry of my thoughts 
 being over, my fears and apprehensions of being 
 swallowed up by the sea being forgotten, and the 
 current of my former desires returned, 1 entirely forgot 
 the vows and promises that I made in my distress. I 
 found indeed some intervals of reflection, and the 
 serious thoughts did, as it were, endeavour to return 
 again sometimes; but I shook them off, and roused 
 myself from them as it were from a distemper, and 
 applying myself to drink and company, soon mastered 
 the return of those fits, for so I called them, and 1 
 had in five or six days got as complete a victory over 
 conscience as any young fellow that resolved not to 
 be troubled with it could desire. But 1 was to have 
 another trial for it still ; and Providence, as in such 
 cases generally it does, resolved to leave me entirely 
 without excuse. For if I would not take this for a 
 deliverance, the next was to be such a one as the worst 
 and most hardened wretch a^ikong us would confess 
 both the danger and the mercy. 
 
 The sixth day of our being at sea we came into 
 Yarmouth roads ; the wind having been contrary and 
 the weather calm, we had made but little way since the 
 storm. Here we were obliged to come to an anchor, 
 and here we lay, the wind continuing contrary, viz., at 
 south-west, for seven or eight days, during which time 
 a great many ships from Newcastle came into the same 
 roads, as the common harbour where the ships might 
 wait for a wind for ihe river. 
 
 We had not, however, rid here so long, but should 
 have tidod it up the river, but that the wind blew too 
 fresh ; and after we had lain four or five days, blew 
 very hard. However, the roads being reckoned as 
 good as a harbour, the anchorage good, and our 
 ground-tackle very strong, our men were unconcerned, 
 and not in the least apprehensive of danger, but spent 
 the time in rest and mirth, after the manner of the sea; 
 but the eighth day in the morning the wind increased, 
 and we had all hands at work to strike our topmasts, 
 
 
 and make everything snuff and close, that the ship 
 might nde af easy as possible. By noon the sea went 
 very high indeed, and our ship rid forecastle in, shipued 
 several seas, and we thought once or twice our anchor 
 had come home ; upon which our master ordered out 
 the sheet-anchor, so that we rode with two anchors 
 ahead, and the cables veered out to the better end. 
 
 By this time it blew a terrible storm indeed, and 
 no^ I be^n to see terror and amazement in the faces 
 even of the seamen themselves. The master, though 
 vigilant to the business of preserving the ship, yet as he 
 went m and out of his caW by me, I could hear him 
 softly to hiniself say several times, ' Lord be merciful 
 r.l T, shaU be all lost, we shaU be all undone'; 
 and the like. During these first hurries I was stupid 
 lying still in my cabin, which was in the steerage, and 
 «innot describe my temper; I could Ul reassume the 
 first penitence, which I had so apparenUy trampled 
 upon, and hardened myself against; I thought the 
 bitterness of death had been past, and that thS would 
 be nothing too, like the first But when the master 
 himself came by me, as I said just now, and said we 
 should be aU lost, I was dreadfully frighted ; I irot 
 up out of my cabin, and looked out But such a 
 dismal sight I never saw; the sea went mountains hiffh 
 and broke upon us every three or four minutes ; when 
 I could look about, I could see nothing but distress 
 round us. Two ships that rid near us we found had 
 cut their masts by tlie board, being deep loaden ; and 
 our men cried out, that a ship which rid about a mile 
 ahead of us was foundered. Two more ship's being 
 driven from their anchors, were run out of the roads to 
 ^/r *" »*}re°t"'-es> and that with not a mast standing. 
 1 he light ships fared the best, as not so much labourintr 
 m the sea; but two or three of them drove, and came 
 
 fT^HVeT:S' '"'^ "^^ °^^ '""^'^ «p"*--i 
 
 Towards evening the mate and boatswain begged 
 the master of our ship to let them cut away thefore- 
 mast, which he was very unwiUing to. But the 
 
 
 boatswain protesting to him that if he did not the ship 
 would founder, he consented ; and when they had cut 
 away tibe foremast| the mainmast stood so loose, and 
 ahook the ship so much, they were obliged to cut her 
 away^ also, and make a clear aeck. 
 
 Any one may judge what a condition I must be in at 
 all this, who was but a young sailor, and who had been 
 in such a fright before at but a little. But if I can 
 express at this distance the thoughts I had about me 
 at that time, I was in tenfold more horror of mind 
 upon account of my former convictions, and the having 
 returned from them to the resolutions I had wickedly 
 taken at first, than I was at death itself; and these, 
 added to the terror of the ;;*orm, put me into such a 
 condition, that I can by no words describe it. But the 
 worst was not come yet ; the storm continued with such 
 fury, that the seamen themselves acknowledged they 
 baa never known a worse. We had a good ship, but 
 she was deep loaden, and wallowed in the sea, that the 
 seamen every now and then cried out she would founder. 
 It was my advantage in one respect, that I did not know 
 what they meant by founder till I inquired. However, 
 the storm was so violent, that I saw what is not often 
 seen, the master, the boatswain, and some others more 
 sensible than the rest, at their prayers, and expecting 
 every moment when the ship would go to the bottom. 
 In the middle of the night, and under all the rest of 
 our distresses, one of the men that had been down on 
 purpose to see cried out we had sprung a leak ; another 
 said there was four foot water in the hold. Then all 
 hands were called to the pump. At that very word my 
 heart, as I thought, died within me, and I fell backwards 
 upon the side of my bed where I sat, into the cabin. 
 However, the men roused me, and told me, that I, 
 that was able to do nothing before, was as well able to 
 pump as another ; at which I stirred up and went to 
 the pump and worked very heartily. While this was 
 doing, the master seeing some light colliers, who, not 
 able to ride out the storm, were obliged to slip and run 
 away to sea, and would come near us, ordered to fire a 
 
 
 gun as a signal of distress. I, who knew nothing what 
 that meant, was so surprised that I thought the ship 
 had broke, or some dreadful thing had happened. In 
 a word, I was so surprised that I fell down m a swoon. 
 As this was a time when everybody had his own life to 
 think of, nobody minded me, or what was become of 
 me; but another man stepped up to the pump, and 
 thrusting me aside with his foot, let me lie, thinking I 
 had been dead ; and it was a great while before I came 
 to myself. 
 
 We worked on, but the water increasing in the hold, 
 it was apparent that the ship would founder, and though 
 the storm began to abate a little, yet as it was not 
 possible sh could swim till we might run into a port, 
 80 the master continued firing guns for help ; and a 
 light ship, who had rid it out just ahead of us, ventured 
 a boat out to help us. It was with the utmost hazard 
 the boat came near us, but it was impossible for us to 
 get on board, or for the boat to lie near the ship's side, 
 till at last the men rowing very heartily, and venturing 
 their lives to save ours, our men cast them a rope over 
 the stem with a buoy to it, and then veered it out a 
 great length, which they after great labour and hazard 
 took hold of, and we hauled them close under our stern, 
 and got all into their boat. It was to no purpose for 
 them or us after we were in the boat to think of reach- 
 ing to their own ship, so all agreed to let her drive, and 
 only to pull her in towards shore as much as we could, 
 and our master promised them that if the boat was 
 staved upon shore he would make it good to their master ; 
 so partly rowing and partly driving, our boat went away 
 to the norward, sloping towards the shore almost as far 
 as Winterton Ness. 
 
 We were not much more than a quarter of an hour 
 out of our ship but we saw her sink, and then I under- 
 stood for the first time what was meant by a ship founder- 
 ing in the sea. I must acknowledge I had hardly eyes 
 to look up when the seamen told me she was sinking ; 
 for from that moment they rather put me into the boat 
 than that I might be said to go in ; my heart was as it 
 
 
 were dead with i n me, partly with fright, partly with horror 
 of mind and the thoughts of what was yet before me. 
 
 While we were in this condition, the men yet labour- 
 ing at the oar to bring the boat near the shore, we could 
 see, when, our boat mounting the waves, we were able 
 to see the shore, a great manv people running along the 
 shore to assist us when we should come near. But we 
 made but slow way towards the shore, nor were we 
 able tp reach the shore, till being past the lighthouse 
 at Winterton, the shore falls off to the westward towards 
 Cromer, and so the land broke off a little the violence 
 of the wind. Here we got in, and though not without 
 much difficulty got all safe on shore, and walked after- 
 wards on foot to Yarmouth, where, as unfortunate men, 
 we were used with great humanity as well by the 
 magistrates of the town, who assigned us good quarters, 
 as by particular merchants and owners of ships, and had 
 money given us sufficient to carry us either to London 
 or back to Hull, as we thought fit. 
 
 Had I now had the sense to have gone back to Hull, 
 and have gone home, I had been happy, and my father, 
 an emblem of our blessed Saviour s parable, had even 
 killed the fatted calf for me ; for hearing the ship I 
 went awav in was cast away in Yarmouth road, it was 
 a great while before he had any assurance that I was 
 not drowned. 
 
 But mv ill fate pushed me on now with an obstinacy 
 that nothing could resist; and though I had several 
 times loud calls from my reason and my more com- 
 posed judgment to go home, yet I had no power to do 
 It 1 know not what to call this, nor will I urge that 
 It is a secret overruling decree that hurries us on to be 
 the instruments of our own destruction, even though it 
 be before us, and that we rush upon it with our eyes 
 open. Certainly nothing but some such decreed un- 
 avoidable misery attending, and which it was impossible 
 for me to escape, could have pushed me forward against 
 the calm rea-souings and persuasions of my most retired 
 tiioughts, and against two such visible instructions as I 
 had met with in my first attempt

 than I. The first time he spoke to me after we were at 
 
 Yarmouth, which was not till two or three days, for 
 we were separated in the town to several quarters— 
 1 say, the first time he saw me, it appeared his tone 
 was altered, and looking very melancholy and shakinir 
 his head, asked me how I did, and telling his father 
 wfto 1 was, and how I had come this voyage only for 
 a trial in order to go farther abroad, his flther turning 
 to me with a very grave and concerned tone, * Youn? 
 man, says he, *you ought never to go to sea any 
 more, you ought to take this for a plain and visibfe 
 token, that you are not to be a seafaring man, ' * Why 
 sir, said I, 'will you go to sea no more?' 'That is 
 another case, said be; 'it is my calling, and there- 
 fore my duty ; but as you made this voyage for a trial 
 you see what a taste Heaven has given you of what 
 you are to expect if you persist; perhaps this is all 
 befallen us on your account, like Jonah in the ship of 
 Tarshish. Pray, continues he, 'what are you? and 
 on what account did you go to sea?' Upon that I 
 told him some of my story, at the end of which he 
 burst out with a strange kind of passion. ' What had 
 1 done, says he, 'that such an unhappy wretch should 
 come into my ship? J would not set my foot in the 
 sarr . ship with thee again for a thousand pounds.' 
 Ihis indeed was, as I said, an excursion of his spirits, 
 which were yet agitated by the sense of his loss, and 
 was farther than he could have authority to - How- 
 ever, he afterwards talked very gravely to n hortod 
 me to go back to my father, and not tempt  evidence 
 to my rum ; told me 1 might see a visible hand of 
 Heaven against me. ' And, young man,' said he. 
 depend upon it, if you do not go back, wherever you 
 go you will meet with nothing but disasters and dis- 
 appointments, till your father's words are fulfilled upon 
 
 We parted soon after ; for I made him little answer, 
 and 1 saw him no more ; which way he went, 1 know 
 
 
 not. As for me, having some money in my pocket, I 
 travelled to London by land ; and there, as well as on 
 the road, liad many struggles with myself what course 
 of life I should take, and whether I should go home, 
 or go to sea. 
 
 As to going home, shame opposed the be motions 
 that offered to my thoughts ; and it immediately 
 occurred to me how I should be laughed at among the 
 neighbours, and should be ashamed to sfe, not my 
 father and mother only, but even everybody else ; from 
 whence I have since often observed how incongruous 
 
 temper of mankind 
 reason which ought 
 
 18, 
 
 to 
 
 and irrational the common 
 
 especially of youth, to that 
 
 guide them in such cases, viz., that they are not 
 
 ashamed to sin, and yet are ashamed to repent; not 
 
 ashamed of the action for which they ought justly to 
 
 be esteemed fools, but are ashamed of the returning, 
 
 which only can make them be esteemed wise men. 
 
 In this state of life, however, I remained some time, 
 uncertain what measures tc take, and what course of 
 life to lead. An irresistible reluctance continued to 
 going home ; and as I stayed a while, the remem- 
 brance of the distress I had been in wore off ; and as 
 that abated, the little motion I had in my desires to a 
 return wore off with it, till at last I quite laid aside the 
 thoughts of it, and looked out for a voyage. 
 
 That evil influence which carried me first away from 
 Bfjy father's house, that hurried me into the wild and 
 indigested notion of raising mv fortune, and that im- 
 pressed those conceits so forcibly upon me as to make 
 me deaf to all good advice, and to the entreaties and 
 even command of my father — \ say, the same influence, 
 whatever it was, presented the most unfortunate of all 
 enterprises to my view ; and I went on board a vessel 
 bound to the coast of Africa, or, as our sailors vulgarly 
 call it, a voyage to Guinea. 
 
 it was my great misfortune that in all these adven- 
 tures I did not ship myself as a sailor, whereby, though 
 I might indeed have worked a little harder than ordinary, 
 yet at the same time I had learned the duty and office 
 
 
 of a foremast man, and in time might have qualified 
 myself for a mate or lieutenant, if not for a mast - 
 But as it was always my fate to choose for the wonS, 
 so 1 did here ; for having money in my pocket, and 
 good clothes upon my back, I would always go on 
 board in the habit of a gentleman ; and so I neither 
 had any business in the ship, or learned to do any. 
 
 It was my lot first of all to fiiU into pretty good 
 company in London, which does not always happen to 
 such loose and misguided young fellows as I then was • 
 the devil generally not omitting to lay some snare for 
 them very early ; but it was not so with me. I first fell 
 acquainted with the master of a ship who had been on 
 the coast of Guinea, and who, having had very good 
 success there, was resolved to go again ; and who, taking 
 a fiincy to my conversation, which was not at aU di^ 
 agreeable at that time, hearing me say I had a mind to 
 see the world, told me if I would go the voyage with 
 him I should be at no expense ; I should be his mess- 
 mate and his companion ; and if I could carry anything 
 with me, I should have all the advantage of it that the 
 trade would admit, and perhaps I might meet with some 
 encouragement. 
 
 I embraced the offer; and, entering into a strict 
 friendshiD with this captain, who was an honest and 
 plam-deahng man, I went the voyage with him, and 
 carried a small adventure with me, which, by the dis- 
 mterested honesty of my friend the captain, I increased 
 very considerably, for I carried about £40 in such 
 toys and trifles as the captain directed me to buy. This 
 £40 I had mustered together by the assistance of some 
 of my relations whom I corresponded with, and who, 
 1 believe, got my father, or at least my mother, to con- 
 tribute so much as that to my first adventure. 
 
 This was the only voyage which I may say was 
 successful in all my adventures, and which I owe to the 
 integritv and honesty of my friend the captain ; under 
 whom also I got a competent knowledge of the mathe- 
 matics and the rules of navigation, learned how to keep 
 an account of the ship's course, take an observation. 
 
 
 16 ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 
 
 and, in ghort, to underatand some things that were 
 needful to be understood by a sailor. For, as he took 
 delight to introduce me, I took delight to learn ; and, 
 in a word, this voyage made me both a sailor and a 
 merchant ; for I brought home five pounds nine ounces 
 of gold dust for my adventure, which yielded me in 
 London at my return almost £300, and this filled me 
 with those aspiring thoughts which have since so com- 
 pleted my ruin. 
 
 Yet even in this voyage I had my misfortunes too ; 
 particularly, that 1 was continually sick, being thrown 
 into a violent calenture by the excessive heat of the 
 climate ; our principal trading being upon the coast, 
 from the latitude oi 15 degrees north even to the line 
 itself. 
 
 1 was now set up for a Guinea trader ; and my friend, 
 to my great misfortune, dying soon after his arrival, I 
 resolved to go the same voyage again, and I embarked 
 in the same vessel with one who was his mate in the 
 former voyage, and had now got the command of the 
 ship. This was the unhappiest voyage Uiat ever man 
 made ; for though J did not carry quite £100 of my 
 new-gained wealth, so that I had £200 left, and which 
 I lodged with my friend's widow, who was very just 
 to me, yet 1 fell into terrible misfortunes in this voyage ; 
 and the first was this, viz., our ship making her course 
 towards the Canary Islands, or rather between those 
 islands and the African shore, was surprised in the grey 
 of the morning by a Turkish rover of Sallee, who gave 
 chase to us with all the sail she could make. We 
 crowded also as much canvas as our yards would spread, 
 or our masts carry, to have got clear ; but finding the 
 pirate gained upon us, and would certainly come up 
 with us in a few hours, we prepared to fight, our ship 
 having twelve guns, and the rogue eighteen. About 
 three in the afternoon he came up with us, and bring- 
 ing to, by mistake, just athwart our quarter, instead of 
 athwart our stern, as he intended, we brought eight of 
 our guns to bear on that side, and poured in a broad- 
 side upon him, which made him sheer off again, after 
 
 
 ADVENTURES OP ROBJNSON CRUSOE 17 
 
 returning our fire and pouring in also his wnall-shot 
 fipom near 200 men which he had on board. However 
 we had not a man touched, all our men keeping close' 
 He prepared to attack us again, and we to defend our- 
 selves ; but laying us on board the next time upon our 
 other quarter, he entered sixty men upon our decks, 
 who immediately fell to cutting and hacking the decks 
 and rigging. We plied them with small-shot, half- 
 pikes, powder-chests, and such like, and cleared our 
 deck of them twice. However, to cut short this 
 melancholy part of our story, our ship being disabled, 
 and three of our men kiUed and eight wounded, we 
 were obliged to yield, and were carried all prisoneiB 
 into Sallee, a port belonging to the Moors. 
 
 The usage 1 had there was not so dreadful as at first 
 1 apprehended, nor was I carried up the country to the 
 emperor s court, as the rest of our men were, hut was 
 kept by the captain of the rover as his proper prize, 
 and made his slave, being young and nimble, and fit for 
 his business. At this surprising cliange of my circum- 
 stances from a merchant to a miserable slave, I was 
 perfectly overwhelmed ; and now I looked back upon 
 mj father s prophetic discourse to me, that I shouldbe 
 miserable, and have none to relieve me, which I thouirht 
 was now so eflFectually brought to pass, that it could 
 not be worse ; that now the hand of Heaven had 
 overtaken me, and I was undone without redemption. 
 Hut alas! this was but a taste of the misery I was to 
 go through, as will appear in the sequel of this story. 
 
 As my new patron, or mister, had taken me home to 
 h^s house, so I was m hopes that he would take me 
 with him when he went to sea again, believing that it 
 would some time or other be his fate to be taken by 
 thn^AU ""l Portugal man-of-war ; and that then I 
 
 ^nnn ? f* '""^ ** ^^^^' ^"* ^^^^ ^^V^ of mine was 
 soon taken away ; for when he went to sea, he left me 
 on shore to look after his little garden, and do the 
 common drudgery of slaves about his \ouse ; and 
 when he came home again from his cruise, he ordered 
 me to he in the cabin to look after the ship.

 Here I mediteted nothing but my emsape, and what 
 method I might Uke to effect it, but found no way that 
 had the leart probability in it Nothing presented to 
 make the supposition of it rational ; for I had nobody 
 to communicate it to that would embark with me, no 
 fellow-slave, no Englishman, Irishman, or Scotsman 
 there but myself; so that for two years, though I 
 often pleased myself with the imagination, yet I never 
 had the least encouraging prospect of putting it in 
 
 pJraCXl CQ» 
 
 1 A?®' ?^"* *^° y®*" *° '^^ circumstance presented 
 itself, which put the old thought of makhig some 
 attempt for my liberty again in my head. My patron 
 lying at home longer than usual without fitting out his 
 ship, which, as I heard, was for want of money, he 
 used constantly, once or twice a week, sometimes 
 oftener, if the weather was fiiir, to take the ship's 
 pinnace, and go out into the road a-fishing ; and as he 
 always took me and a young Maresco with him to row 
 the boat, we made him very merry, and I proved very 
 dexterous in catehing fish ; insomuch, that sometimes 
 he would send me with a Moor, one of his kinsmen, 
 and the youth the Maresco, as they called him. to 
 catch a dish of fish for him. 
 
 It happened one time that, going a-fishing in a stark 
 calm morning, a fog rose so thick, that though we 
 were not half a league from the shore we lost sight of 
 It ; and rowinff we knew not whither or which way, 
 we laboured all day, and all the next night, and when 
 the morning came we found we had pulled off to sea 
 instead of pulling in for the shore ; and that we were 
 at least two leagues from the shore. However, we got 
 well m a^in, though with a great deal of labour, 
 and some danger, for the wind began to blow pretty 
 fresh m the morning ; but particularly we were all 
 very hungry. 
 
 But our patron, warned by this disaster, resolved to 
 take more care of himself for the future ; and haviDif 
 lying by him the long-boat of our English ship which 
 he had taken, he resolved he would not go a-fishing

 he ordered the carpenter of his ship, who also wa^ an

 and work the saUs. dhe sailed with what we call a 
 shoulder-of-mutton sail ; and the boom jibbed over the 
 top of the cabin, which lay very snug and low, and had 
 in It room for h m to lie, with a slave or two, and a 
 table to eat on, with some small lockers to put in some 
 bottles of such hquor as he thought fit to drink; 
 particularly h«« uread, rice, and coffee. 
 
 We went .equently out with this boat a-fishinff. 
 and as I was most dexte-ous to cateh fish for him. he 
 never went without me. It happened that he had 
 appointed to go out m this boat, either for pleasure or 
 for fish, with two or three Moors of some distinction in 
 that place, and for whom he had provided extra- 
 ordinarily ; and had therefore sent on board the boat 
 overnight a krger store of provisions than ordinary : 
 and had ordered me to get ready three fuzees with 
 oowder and shot, which were on board his ship, for 
 Shin ^^ designed some sport of fowling as weU as 
 
 I got all thinp ready as he had directed, and waited 
 the next morning with the boat, washed clean, her 
 ancient and pendants out, and everything to a^om- 
 modate his guests ; when by and by my ptFon came on 
 board alone, and told me his guests hadput off iroinff 
 upon some business that feU out, and ordered ml wUh 
 the man and boy, as usual, to go out with the boat and 
 catch them some fish, for that his friends were to sup 
 at his house ; and commanded that as soon as I had 
 got some hsh 1 should bring it home to his house ; all 
 which I prepared to do. 
 
 This moment my former notions of deliverance darted 
 mto my thoughts, for now I found I was like to have a 
 httle ship at iny command ; and my master being gone, 
 I prepared to furnish myself, not for a fishing business

 SO ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 
 
 but for a voyage ; though I knew iiot| neither did I bo 
 much as consider, whither I should steer; for anywhere, 
 to get out of that place, was my way. 
 
 My first contrivance wao to malce a pretence to speak 
 to this Moor, to get something for our subsistence on 
 board ; for I told him we must not presume to eat of 
 our patron's bread. He said that was true; so he 
 brought a large basket of rusk or biscuit of their kind, 
 and V. 'ars with fresh water, into the boat. 1 knew 
 where my patron's case of bottles stood, which it was 
 evident by the make were taken out of some English 
 
 Srize ; and I conveyed them into the boat while the 
 loor was on shore, as if they had been there before 
 for our master. I conveyed also a great lump of beeswax 
 into the boat, which weighed above half a hundred- 
 weight, with a parcel of twine or thread, a hatchet, a 
 saw, and a hammer, all which were great use to us after- 
 wards, especially the wax to make caudles. Another 
 trick I tried upon him, which he innocently came into 
 also. His name was Ismael, who they call Muly, or 
 Moely ; so I called to him, *Moely,' said I, 'our patron's 
 guns are on board the boat ; can you not get a little 
 powder and shot ? it may be we may kill some alcamies 
 (a fowl like our curlews) for ourselves, for i ki. r »t he 
 keeps the gunner's stores in the ship.' ' Yes,' says he, 
 * I'll bring some ' ; and accordingly he brought a great 
 leather pouch which held about a pound and a htilf of 
 powder, or rather more ; and another with shot, that 
 nad five or six pounds, with some bullets, and put all 
 into the boat. At the same time I had found some 
 powder of mv master's in the great cabin, with which I 
 filled one of the large bottles in the case, which was 
 almost empty, pouring what was in it into another ; 
 and thus fumisned with everything needful, we sailed 
 out of the port to fish. The castle, which is at the 
 entrance of the port, knew who we were, and took no 
 notice of us ; and we were not above a mile out of the 
 port before we hauled in our sail, and set us down to 
 fish. The wind blew from the N.N.E., which was 
 contrary to my desire ; for had it blown southerly I 
 
 
 had been aure to have made the coast of Spain, and at 
 least reached to the bay of Cadiz ; but juy reiiolutioni 
 were, blow which way it would, 1 would be gone from 
 the horrid place where I waa, and leave the re«t to 
 Fate. 
 
 After wu had fighed some time and catched nothing, 
 for when I had Ash on my hook I would not pull them 
 
 "?1^*M'® "*^*'* °°* '^ ^•"'^ ^ »»d to «« Moor, 
 ITiw will not do ; our master will not be thus served ; 
 we muRt stand farther off.' He, thiukinjf no harm 
 agreed, and being in the head of the boat k t the sails ; 
 and as I had the helm I run the boat out i i a league 
 farther, and then brought her to as if I *ould fish : 
 when giving the boy the helm, I stepped forward to 
 where the Moor was, and making as if I stooped for 
 something behind him, I took him by surprise with mv 
 arm under his twist, and tossed him clear overboard 
 into the sea. He rose immediately, for he swam like 
 a cork, and called to me, begged to be taken in, told 
 me he would go all the world over with me. He swam 
 so strong after the boat, that he would have reached 
 me very quickly, there being but little wind ; upon 
 which I stepped into the cabin, and fetching one of the 
 fowling-pieces, I presented it at him, acl told him 1 
 had done him no hurt, and if he would be quiet I 
 would do him none. ' But,' said I, * you swim well 
 enough to reach to the shore, and the sea is cairn ; 
 make the best of vour way to 8hor.\ and I will do you 
 no harm ; but if you come near the boat I'll shoot 
 you through the head, for I am resolved to have my 
 liberty. So he turned himself about, and swam for 
 the shore, and I make no doubt but he reached it with 
 ease, for he was an excellent swimmer. 
 
 I could have been content to have taken this Moo* 
 with me, and have drowned the boy, but there was no 
 venturing to trust him. When he was gone I turned 
 to the boy, whom they called Xury, and said to him, 
 Xury, if you will be faithful to me 1*11 make you a 
 great man ; but if you will not stroke your face to be 
 true to me,' that is, swear by Mahomet and his father's 
 
 
 beard, ' I must throw you into the sea too.' The boy 
 smiled in my face^ and spoke so innocently, that I 
 c >uld not mistrust him, and swore to be faithful to me, 
 and eo all over the world with me. 
 
 While I was in view of the Moor that was swimming, 
 I stood out directly to sea with the boat, rather 
 stretching to windward, that they might think me gone 
 towards the straits' mouth (as indeed any one that had 
 been in their wits must h: ve been supposed to do) ; for 
 who would have supposed we were sailed on to the south- 
 ward to the truly narbarian coast, where whole nations 
 of negroes were sure to surround us with their canoes, 
 and destroy us ; where we could ne'er once go on shore 
 but we should be devoured by savage beasts, or more 
 merciless savages of human kind ? 
 
 But as soon as it grew dusk in the evening, I changed 
 my course, and steered directly south and by east, 
 lending my course a little toward the east, that I might 
 Keep in with the shore ; and having a fair, fresh gale 
 of wind, and a smooth, quiet sea, I made such sail that 
 I believe by the next day at three o'clock in the 
 afleruoon, when I first made the land, I could not be 
 less than 150 miles south of Sallee ; quite beyond the 
 Emperor of Morocco's dominions, or indeed of any 
 other king thereabouts, for we saw no people. 
 
 Yet such was the fright I had taken at the Moors, 
 and the dreadful apprehensions I had of falling into 
 their hands, that I would not stop, or go on shore, or 
 come to an anchor, the wind continuing fair, till I had 
 sailed in that manner five days ; and then the wind 
 shifting to the southward, I concluded also that if any 
 of our vessels were in chase of me, they also would 
 now give over ; so I ventured to make to the coast, and 
 came to an anchor in the mouth of a little river, I knew 
 not what, or where ; neither what latitude, what country, 
 what nations, or what river. I neither saw, or desired to 
 see, any people ; the principal thing I wanted was fresh 
 water. We came into tnis creek in the evening, 
 resolving to swim on shore as soon as it was dark, and 
 discover the country ; but as soon as it was quite dark 
 
 
 ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 23 
 
 we heard such dreadful noises of the- barking, roaring, 
 and howling of wild creatures, of we knew not what 
 kinds, that the poor boy wap -e^fiv to die with fear, 
 and begged of me not to g )n siiore til^ day. ' Well) 
 Xury,' said I, *then I wo I't ; but it rr vy be we may 
 see men by day, who wiL b«« as bad to us as those 
 lions.' ' TTien we give thei/: *r» shoot '^un,' say« Xury 
 laughing; *make them run away.' Such English 
 Xury SDoke by conversing among us slaves. However, 
 I was glad to see the boy so cheerful, and 1 gave him a 
 dram (out of our patron s case of bottles) to cheer him 
 up. After all, Xury's advice was good, and I took it ; 
 we dropped our little anchor and lay still all night. I 
 say still, for we slept none ; for in two or three hours 
 we saw vast great creatures (we knew not what to call 
 them) of many sorts come down to the sea-shore and 
 run into the water, wallowing and washing themselves 
 for the pleasure of cooling themselves ; and they made 
 such hideous bowlings and yellings, that I never indeed 
 heard the like. 
 
 Xury was dreadfully frighted, and indeed so was I 
 too ; but we were both more frighted when we heard 
 one of these mighty creatures come swimming towards 
 our boat ; we could not see him, but we might hear 
 him by his blowing to be a monstrous huge and furious 
 beast Xury said it was a lion, and it might be so for 
 aught I know; but poor Xury cried to me to weigh 
 the anchor and row away. 'No,' says I, *Xury; 
 we can slip our cable with the buoy to it, and go off 
 to sea; they cannot follow us far.' I had no sooner 
 said so, but I perceived the creature (whatever it was) 
 within two oars length, which something surprised me ; 
 however, I immediately stepped to the cabin door, 
 and taking up my gun, fired at him, upon which he 
 immediately turned about and swam towards the shore 
 again. 
 
 But it is impossible to describe the horrible noises, 
 and hideous cries and bowlings, that were raised, as 
 well upon the edge of the shore as higher within the 
 country, upon the noise or report of the gun, a thing 
 
 
 I have some reaj^on to believe those creatures had 
 never heard before. This convinced me that there 
 was no goin^ on shore for us in the night upon that 
 coast ; and how to venture on shore in the day was 
 another question too ; for to have fallen into the 
 hands of any of the savages^ had been as bad as 
 to have fallen into the hands of lions and tigers ; 
 at least we were equally apprehensive of the danger 
 of it 
 
 Be that as it would^ we were obliged to go on shore 
 somewhere or other for water^ for we had not a pint 
 left in the boat ; when or where to get to it, was the 
 point Xury said if I would let him go on shore 
 with one of the jars, he would find if there was any 
 water and bring some to me. I asked him why he 
 would go.^ why I should not go and he stay in the 
 boat .'' The boy answered with so much affection, that 
 made me love him ever after. Says he, 'If wild 
 mans come, they eat me, you go way.' *Well, 
 Xury,' said I, * we will both go ; and if the wild mans 
 come, we will kill them, they shall eat neither of us.' 
 So I gave Xury a piece '^f rusk bread to eat, and a 
 dram out of our patron's case of bottles which I 
 mentioned before ; and we hauled in the boat as near 
 the shore as we thought was proper, and so waded on 
 shore, carrying nothing but our arms and two jars for 
 water. 
 
 I did not care to go out of sight of the boat, fearing 
 the coming of canoes with savages down the river ; but 
 the boy seeing a low place about a mile up the country, 
 rambled to it ; and by and by I saw him come running 
 towards me. 1 thought he was pursued by some savage,* 
 or frighted with some wild beast, and I ran forward 
 towards him to help him ; but when I came nearer to 
 him, I saw something hanging over his shoulders, which 
 was a creature that he had shot, like a hare, but different 
 in colour, and longer legs. However, we were very glad 
 of it, and it was very good meat ; but the great joy 
 that poor Xury came with was to tell me he had found 
 good water, and seen no wild mana 
 
.-; 
 
 ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 26 
 
 But we found afterwards that we need not take such 
 pains for water, for a little higher up the creek where 
 we were we found the water fresh when the tide was 
 out, which flowed but a little way up ; so we filled our 
 jars, and feasted on the hare we had killed, and prepared 
 to go on our way, having seen no footsteps of any 
 human creature in that part of the country. 
 
 As I had been one voyage to this coast before, I 
 knew very well that the islands of the Canaries, and the 
 Cape de Verde Islands also, lay not far oflF from the coast. 
 But as 1 had no instruments to take an observation 
 to know what latitude we were in, and did not exactly 
 know, or at least remember, what latitude they were in. 
 1 knew not where to look for them, or when to stand 
 off to sea towards them; otherwise I might now 
 easUy have found some of these islands. But my hope 
 was, that if I stood along this coast till I came to that 
 I»rt where the English traded, I should find some of 
 their vessels upon their usual design of trade, that would 
 relieve and take us in. 
 
 By the best of my calculation, that place where I 
 now was must be that country which, lying between 
 the Ji-mperor of More - dominions and the negroes 
 lies waste and uninha jxcept by wild beaste ; the 
 
 negroes having abando. ,. and gone farther south for 
 tear of the Moors, and the Moors not thinking it 
 worth inhabiting, by reason of its barrenness ; and 
 indeed both forsaking it because of the prodigious 
 numbers of tigers, lions, leopards, and other furious 
 creatures which harbour there ; so that the Moors use 
 It tor their hunting only, where they go like an army 
 two or three thousand men at a time ; and indeed for 
 near an hundred miles together upon this coast we saw 
 nothing but a waste uninhabited country by day, and 
 heard nothing but bowlings and roarings of wild beasts 
 by night. 
 
 p.^"*'?^?'' *^?£.® V° *^e daytime I thought I saw the 
 Pico of Teneriffe, being the high top of the Mountain 
 lenenffe m the Canaries, and had a great mind to 
 venture out, in hopes of reaching thither ; but having 
 
 
 tried twice, I was forced in again bv contrary winds, 
 the sea also going too high for my little vessel ; so I 
 resolved to pursue my first design, and keep sdong the 
 shore. 
 
 Several times I was obliged to land for fresh water 
 after we had left this place ; and once in particular, 
 being early in the morning, we came to an anchor under 
 a little point of land which was pretty high ; and the 
 tide beginning to flow, we lay still to go farther in. 
 Xury, whose eves were more about him than it seems 
 mine were, calls softly to me, and tells me that we had 
 best go farther off the shon^ * ' For,' says he, ' look, 
 yonder lies a dreadful monstei a the side of that hillock 
 fast asleep.' I looked wher»- '' pointed, and saw a 
 dreadful monster indeed, fori^ as a terrible great lion 
 that lay on the side of the shore, under the shade of a 
 piece of the hill that hung as it were a little over him. 
 *Xury,' says I, *you shall go on shore and kill him.' 
 Xury looked frighted, and said, ' Me kill ! he eat me at 
 one mouth ' ; one mouthful he meant. However, I said 
 no more to the boy, but bade him lie still, and I took 
 our biggest gun, which was almost musket-bore, and 
 loaded it with a good charge of powder, and with two 
 slugs, and laid it down ; then I loaded another gun 
 with two bullets ; and the third (for we had three pieces) 
 I loaded with five smaller bullets. I took the best aim 
 I could with the first piece to have shot him into the 
 head, but he lay so with his leg raised a little above his 
 nose, that the slugs hit his leg about the knee, and 
 broke the bone. He started up growling at first, but 
 finding his leg broke, fell down again, and then got up 
 upon three legs and gave the most hideous roar that 
 ever I heard. I was a little surprised that I had not 
 hit him on the head. However, I took up the second 
 piece immediately, and though he began to move off, 
 fired again, and shot him into the head, and had the 
 
 Eleasure to see him drop, and make but little noise, 
 ut lay struggling for life. Then Xury took heart, and 
 would have me let him go on shore. * Well, go,' 
 said I ; so the boy jumped into the water, and taking a 
 
 
 little gun in one hand, swam to gbore with the other 
 hand, and commg close tc the creature, put the muzzle 
 of the piece to his ear, and shot him into the head again, 
 which despatched him quite. -»~"» 
 
 This was game indeed to us, but this was no focA : 
 and I was very sorry to lose three charges of powder 
 and shot upon a creature that was good for netting to 
 us. However, Xury said he would have some of him : 
 so he comes on board, and asked me to give bun the 
 hatchet. 'For what Xury?' said I. *Me cut off 
 
 t" i'^A* u*i't ^®- ^o^ever. Xury could not cut o^/ 
 his head, but he cut off a foot, and brought it with him 
 and It was a monstrous great one * 
 
 1 bethought myself, however, that perhaps the skin of 
 him might one way or other be of some value to us; 
 and I resolved to take off his skin if I coulu. So

 inhabited ; and in two or three places, as we sailed by, 
 we saw people stand upon the shore to look at us ; we 
 could also perceive they were auite black, and stark 
 naked. I was once inclined to have gone on shore to 
 them ; but Xury was my better counsellor, and said to 
 me, *No go, no go.' However, I hauled in nearer the 
 shore that I might talk to them, and I found they ran 
 along the shore by me a good way. I observed they 
 had no weapons in their hands, except one, who had 
 a long slender stick, which Xury said was a lance, and 
 that they would throw them a great way with good 
 aim. So I kept at a distance, but talked with them by 
 signs as well as I could, and particularly made signs for 
 something to eat ; they beckoned to me to stop my 
 boat, and that they would fetch me some meat. Upon 
 this I lowered the top of my sail, and lay by, and two 
 of them ran up into the country, and in less than half 
 an hour came back, and brought with them two pieces 
 of dried flesh and some com, such as is the produce of 
 their country ; but we neither knew what the one or the 
 other was. However, we were willing to accept it, but 
 how to come at it was our next dispute, for I was not 
 for venturing on shore to them, and they were as much 
 afraid of us ; but they took a safe way for us all, for 
 they brought it to the shore and laid it down, and went 
 and stood a great way off till we fetched it on board, 
 and then came close to us again. 
 
 We made signs of thanks to them, for we had 
 nothing to make '-hem amends. But an opportunity 
 offered that very instant to oblige them wonderfully ; 
 for while we were lying by the shore came two 
 mighty creatures, one pursuing the other (as we took 
 it) with great fury from the mountains towards the 
 sea ; whether it was the male pursuing the female, 
 or whether they were in sport or in rage, we could 
 not *3ll, any more than we could tell whether it was 
 usual or strange, but I believe it was the latter ; 
 because, in the first place, those ravenous creatures 
 seldom appear but in the night; and in the second 
 place, we found the people terribly frighted, especially 
 
 
 S^H nTtT^V '^t™«° that had the lance or dart 
 did not fly from them, but the rest did; however, as 
 the two creatures ran direcUy into the water, they 
 did not seem to offer to fall upon any of the n^roe/ 
 but plunged themselves into t£e sea, and swamXu?!

 they had no ki yet, with a sharpened piece of wood, 
 they took off s skin as readily, ana much more 
 readily, than « . could have done with a knife. They 
 offered me some of the flesh, which I declined, making 
 as if I would give it them, but made signs for the 
 skin, which they gave me very freely, and brought 
 me a great deid more of their provision, which, though 
 I did not understand, yet I accepted. Then I made 
 signs to them for some water, and held out one of 
 my jars to them, turning it bottom upward, to show 
 tjiat it was empty, and that I wanted to have it filled. 
 Tliey called immediately to some of their friends, 
 and there came two women, and brought a great 
 vessel made of earth, and burnt, as I suppose, in the 
 sun ; tiiis they set down for me, as before, and I 
 sent Xury on shore with my jars, and filled them all 
 three. The women were as stark naked as the men. 
 
 I was now furnished with roots and com, such as 
 it was, and water ; and leaving my friendly negroes, 
 I made forward for about eleven days more, without 
 offering to go near the shore, till I saw the land run 
 out a great length into the sea, at about the distance 
 of four or five leagues before me ; and the sea being 
 very calm, I kept a large offing, to make this point. 
 At length, doubling the point, at about two leagues 
 from the land, I saw plainly land on the other side, 
 to seaward ; then I concluded, as it was most certain 
 indeed, that this was the Cape de Verde, and those 
 the islands, called from thence Cape de Verde Islands. 
 However, they were at a great distance, and I could 
 not well tell what I had best to do ; for if I should 
 be taken with a fresh of wind, I might neither reach 
 one or other. 
 
 In this dilemma, as I was very pensive, I stepped into 
 the cabin, and sat me down, Xury having the helm ; 
 when, on a sudden, the boy cried out, ' Master, master, 
 a ship with a sail ! ' and the foolish boy was frighted 
 out of his wits, thinking it must needs ue some of his 
 master's ships sent to pursue us, when I knew we were 
 gotten &r enough out of their reach. I jumped out oi

 to be saved myself; and it may, one time or other, be 
 my lot to be ti.ken up in th*? same condition. Besides, 
 says he, * when X carry you to the Brazils, so great a 
 way from your own country, if I should cake from you 
 what you have, you will be starved there, and then I 
 only take away that life I have given. No, no. Seignior 
 Inglese,' says he, ' Mr. Englishman, 1 will carry vou 
 thither in charity, and those things will help you to bupr 
 your subsistence there, and your passage home agaip. 
 
 As he was charitable in his proposal, so he was just 
 in the performance to a tittle ; for he ordered the sm- 
 men that none should offer to touch anything I had ; 
 then he took everything into his own possession, and 
 gave me back an exact inventory of them, that 1 might 
 have them, even so much as my three earthen jars. 
 
 As to my boat, it was a very good one, and that he 
 saw, and told me he would buy it of me for tiie ship s 
 use, and asked me what I would have for it ? I told 
 him he had . rn so generous to me in everything, that 
 1 cjuld not I riar to make any price of the boat, but 
 left it entirely to him; upon which he told me he 
 would give me a note of his hand to pay me eighty 
 pieces of eight for it at Brazil, and when it came there, 
 if any one offered to give more, he would make it up. 
 He offered me also sixty pieces of eight more for my 
 boy Xury, which I was loth to take ; not that I was 
 not willing to let the captain have him, but I was very 
 loth to sell the poor boy's liberty, who had assisted me 
 BO faithfully in procuring my own. However, when 1 
 let him know my reason, he owned it to be just, and 
 offered me this medium, that he would give the boy an 
 obligation to set him free in ten years if he turned 
 Christian. Upon this, and Xury saying he was wiUmg 
 to go to him, I let the captain have him. 
 
 We had a very good voyage to the Brazils, and 
 arrived in the Bay de Todos los Santos, or AU Saints 
 Bay, in about twenty-two days after. And now I was 
 once more delivered from the most miserable of all 
 conditions of life ; and what to do next with myself, 
 I was now to consider. 
 
 I « 
 
 
 The generous treatment the captain gave me, I can 
 never enough remember. He would Uke nothing ot 
 me for my passage, ?ave me twr ny ducats for U»o 
 leopard s skm, and lorty for the lion's skin, which i 
 hod in my boat, and caused everything I had in the 
 ship to be punctually delivered me; and what I was 
 willing to sell he bought, such as the case of botUes. 
 two of my guns, and a piece of the lump of beeswax- 
 about 220 pieces of eight of all my cargo, and with this 
 stock I went on shore in the Brazils. 
 
 I had not been long here, but being recommended 
 to the house of a good honest man like ^-'mself. who 
 had an trigeino as they call it, that is, a plantation and 
 a sugar-house, I lived with him some time, and ac 
 quainted myself by that means with the manner of 
 their planting and making of sugar; and seeing how 
 well the planters lived, and how they grew rich 
 suddenly, I resolved, if I could get licebce to settle 
 there, I would tun. planter among them, resolving in 
 the meantime to hnJ out some way to get my money 
 which I had left in London remitted to me. To this 
 purpose, getting a kind of a letter of naturalisation. I 
 purchased as much land that was uncured as my money 
 would reach, and formed a plan for my plantation and 
 settlement, and such a one as might be suitable to the 
 stock which I proposed to myself to receive from England 
 y^^.f'^^^^^oiiT, a Portuguese of Lisbon, but born 
 of hnghsh parents, whose name was Wells, and in 
 much such circumstances as I was. I caU him mv 
 ne^hbour, because his plantation lay next to mine 
 and we went on very sociably together. My stock wa^ 
 but low, as well as his ; and we rather planted for 
 food than anything else, for about two years. How-

 ready for planting canes in the year to come. But we 
 
 both wanted help ; and now I found, more than before, 
 
 I had done wrong in parting with my boy Xury. 
 
 
 f 
 
 t: 
 
 But alai ! for me to do wrong that never did right 
 wag no great wonder. I had no remedy but to go on. 
 1 waa gotten into an employment quite remote to my 
 genius, and directly contrary to the life I delighted in, 
 and for which I fonook my father'a house, and broke 
 through all his good advice ; nay, I was coming into 
 the very middle station, or upper degree of low life, 
 which my £ither advised me to oefore ; and which, if I 
 resolved to go on with, I might as well have stayed at 
 home, and never have fotigued myself in the world as 
 I had done. And I used often to say to myself, I could 
 have done this as well in England among my friends, 
 as have gone 6000 miles off to do it among strangers 
 and savages, in a wilderness, and at such a distance as 
 never to hear from any part of the world that had the 
 least knowledge of me. 
 
 In this manner I used to look upon my condition 
 with the utmost regret I had nooody to converse 
 with, but now and then this neighbour ; no work to be 
 done, but by the labour of my hands ; and I used to 
 say, I lived just like a man cast away upon some deso- 
 late island, that had nobody there but himself. But 
 how just has it been ! and how should all men reflect, 
 that when they compare their present conditions with 
 others that are worse. Heaven may oblige them to 
 make the exchange, and be convinced of their former 
 felicity by their experience ; — I say, how just has it 
 been, that the truly solitary life 1 reflected on in an 
 island of mere desolation should be my lot, who had so 
 often unjustly compared it with the life which I then 
 led, in which, had 1 continued, I had in all probability 
 beea exceeding prosperous and rich. 
 
 I was in some degree settled in my measures for 
 carrying on the plantation before my kind friend, the 
 captain of the ship that took me up at sea, went back ; 
 for the ship remained there in providing his loading, 
 and preparing for his voyage, near three months ; when, 
 telling him what little stock I had left behind me in 
 London, he gave me this friendly and sincere advice : 
 ' Seignior Inglese,' says he, for so he always called me. 
 
 
 ' if you will griye me letters, and a procuration here in 
 form to me, with orders to the person who has your 
 money in Loudon to send your effects to Usbon, to 
 such persons as I shall direct, and in such goods as are 
 PJ^P"" ^^j;^'" «?."°t'7» I '^U bring you the produce 
 of them, God willing, at my return. But since human 
 affairs are all subject to changes and disasters, I would 
 have you «ve orders but for one hundred pounds 
 sterling, which, you sav, is half your stock, and let the 
 hazard be run for the first ; so that if it come safe, you 
 may order the rest the same way ; and if it miscarry, 
 you may have the other half to have recourse to for 
 your supply.' 
 
 This was so wholesome advice, and looked so 
 friendly, that I could not but be convinced it was the 
 best course I could take ; so I accordingly prepared 
 letters to the gentlewoman with whom I had left my 
 M*he deS d" P'^"™*^°^ *** *^® Portuguese captain, 
 
 I wrote the English captain's widow a full account

 had met with the Portugal captain at sea, the humanity 
 of 18 behaviour, and in what condition 1 was now in 
 witn Bll other necessary directions for my supply! 
 Aad when this honest captain came to Lisbon, he found 
 means, by some of the English merchants there to 
 send over not the order only, but a fuU account of my 
 iff""^* to a merchant at London, who represented it 
 effectually to her ; whereupon, she not only delivered 
 the money, but out of her own pocket sent the Portugal

 36 ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 
 
 When this cargo arrived, I thought my fortune 
 made, for I was surprised with joy of it ; and my good 
 steward, the captain, had laid out the five pounds, 
 which my friend had sent him for a present for himself, 
 to purchase and bring me over a servant under bond 
 for six years' service, and would not accept of any con- 
 sideration, except a little tobacco, which 1 would have 
 him accept, being of my own produce. 
 
 Neither was this all ; but my goods being all English 
 manufactures, such as cloth, stuffs, baize, and things 
 particularly valuable and desirable in the country, I 
 found means to sell them to a very great advantage ; 
 so that 1 may say I had more than four times the value 
 of my first cargo, and was now infinitely beyond my 
 poor neighbour, I mean in the advancement of my 
 plantation ; for the first thing I did, I bought me a 
 negro slave, and an European servant al J ; I mean 
 another besides that which the captain brought me 
 from Lisbon. 
 
 But as abused prosperity is oftentimes made the very 
 means of our greatest adversity, so was it with me. I 
 went on the next year with great success in my plan- 
 tation. I raised fifty great rolls of tobacco on my own 
 ground, more than I had disposed of for necessaries 
 among my neighbours ; and these fifty rolls, being each 
 of above a hundredweight, were well cured, and laid by 
 against the return of the fleet from Lisbon. And now, 
 increasing in business and in wealth, my head began to 
 be full of projects and undertakings beyond my reach, 
 such as are, indeed, often the ruin of the best heads in 
 business. 
 
 Had I continued in the station I was now in, I had 
 room for all the happy things to have yet befallen me 
 for which my father so earnestly recommended a quiet, 
 retired life, and of which he had so sensibly described 
 the middle station of life to be full of. But other 
 things attended me, and I was still to be the wilful 
 agent of all mv own miseries; and particularly, to 
 increase my fault and double the reflections upon my- 
 self, which in my future sorrows I should have leisure 
 
 
 to make. All these miscarriajfes were procured bv mv 
 apparent obstinate adhering to my foolish incUnlZl 
 of wandering abroad, and pursuing that inclination in 
 contradiction to the clearl^st views of doin^ mv^lf

 38 ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 
 
 It happened, being in company with some merchant! 
 and planters of my acquaintance, and talking of those 
 things very earnestly, three of them came to me the 
 next morning, and told me they had been musing very 
 much upon what I had discoursed with them of, the 
 last night, and they came to make a secret proposal to 
 me. And after enjoining me secrecy, they told me 
 that they had a mind to fit out a ship to go to Guinea ; 
 that they had all plantations as well as I, and were 
 straitened for nothing so much as servants ; that as it 
 was a trade that could not be carried on because they 
 could not publicly sell the negroes when they came 
 home, so uiey desired to make but one voyage, to 
 bring the negroes on shore privately, and divide them 
 among their own plantations ; and, in a word, the 
 question was, whetner I would go their supercargo in 
 the ship, to manage the trading part upon the coast of 
 Guinea ; and they offered me that I snould have my 
 equal share of the negroes without providing any part 
 of the stock. 
 
 This was a fair proposal, it must be confessed, had 
 it been made to any one that had not had a settlement 
 and plantation of his own to look after, which was in a 
 fair way of coming to be very considerable, and with a 
 good stock upon it. But for me, that was thus entered 
 and established, and had nothing to do but go on as 
 I had begun, for three or four years more, and to have 
 sent for the other hundred pounds from England ; and 
 who, in that time, and with that little addition, could 
 scarce have failed of being worth three or four thousand 
 pounds sterling, and that increasing too — for me to 
 think of such a voyage, was the most preposterous thing 
 that ever man, in such circumstances, could be guilty of. 
 
 But I, that was born to be my own destroyer, could 
 no more resist the offer than I could restrain my first 
 rambling designs, when my Other's good counsel was 
 lost upon me. In a word, I told them I would go 
 with ail my heart, if they would undertake to look 
 after my plantation in my absence, and would dispose 
 of it to such as I should direct if I miscarried. This 
 
 
 they all engaged to do, and entered into writinirs or 
 covenants to do so ; and I made a formal will, dia- 
 
 Sosing of my plantation and effects, in case of mv 
 ^%* maW the captain of the ship that had saved 
 my life, as before, my universal heir, but obliirinir him 
 to dispose of my effects as I had directed i£ my 
 mU ; one-half of the produce being to himself, and the 
 other to be shipped to England. 
 
 in short, I took all possible caution to preserve my 
 effects, and keep up my plantation. Had I used haft 
 as much prudence to have looked into my own interest, 
 and have made a judgment of what I ought to have 
 done and not to have done, I had certainly never ffone 
 away from so prosperous an undertaking, leavinl aU 
 the probable views of a thriving circumstance, and 
 gone upon a voyage to sea, attended with jdl its 
 common hazards, to say nothing of the reasons I had 
 to expect particular misfortunes to myself 
 
 But I was hurried on, and obeyed blindly the dic- 
 tates ofmy fancy raider than my reason. And accord- 
 ingly, the ship being fitted out, and the cargo furnished, 
 and aU things done as by agreement by my partners i^ 
 ^e voyage, I went on board in an evil hourfthe [first] 
 of [September 1669], being the same day eight year 
 that 1 went from my father and mother at Hull, in 
 order to act the rebel to their authority, and the fool 
 to my own interest 
 
 Our ship was about 120 tons burthen, carried six 
 gruns and fourteen men, besides the master, his boy. 
 and myself. We had on board no large cargo of 
 goods, except of such toys as were fit for our trade with 
 the negroes-such as beads, bits of glass, shells, and 
 odd trifles, especiaUv little looking-glasses, knives, 
 scissors, hatchets, and the like. ' 
 
 The same day I went on board we set saU, standimr 
 away to the northward upon our own coast, with desS 
 to stretch over for the African coast, when they came 
 about 10 or 12 degrees of northern latitude, which, it 
 seems, was the manner of their course in those days. 
 We had very good weather, only excessive hot, aU the

 tray upou our own coast, till we came the height of 
 Cape St Augustino, from whence, keeping farther off 
 at sea, we lost sight of land, and steered as if we were 
 hound for the Isle Fernando de Noronha, holding our 
 course N. E. hy N. , and leaving those isles on the east. 
 In this course we passed the line in about twelve days' 
 time, and were, by our last observation, in 7 degrees 22 
 minutes northern latitude, when a violent tornado, or 
 hurricane, took us quite out of our knowledge. It began 
 from the south-east, came about to the north-west, and 
 then settled into the north-east, from whence it blew 
 in such a terrible manner, that for twelve days together 
 we could do nothing but drive, and, scudding away 
 before it, let it carry us wherever fate and the fury of 
 the winds directed ; and during these twelve days, I 
 need not say that I expected every day to be swallowed 
 up, nor, indeed, did any in the ship expect to save 
 taeir lives. 
 
 In this distress we had, besides the terror of the 
 storm, one of our men died of the calenture, and one 
 man and the boy washed overboard. About the twelfth 
 day, the weather abating a ^ittle, the master made an 
 observation as well as he could, and found that he was 
 in about 11 degrees north latitude, but that he was 22 
 degrees of longitude difference west from Cape St. 
 Augustino ; so that he found he was gotten upon the 
 coast of Guiana, or the north part of Brazil, beyond 
 the river Amazon, toward that of the river Orinoco, 
 commonly called the Great River, and began to consult 
 with me what course he should ike, for the ship was 
 leaky and very much disabled, and he was g^ing 
 directly back to the coast of Brazil. 
 
 I was positively against that ; and looking over the 
 charts of the sea-coast of America with him, we con- 
 cluded there was no inhabited country for us to have 
 recourse to till we came within the circle of the Car- 
 ribbee Islands, and therefore resolved to stand away for 
 Barbadoes, which by keeping off at sea, to avoid the 
 indraft of the Bay or Gulf of Mexico, we might easily 
 perform, as we hoped, in about fifteen days' sail; 
 
 
 whereaai^ could not possibly make our voyjure to the 
 coast of Africa without some assistance, both to our shin 
 and to ourselves. '^ 
 
 ^'S w^u®*^^.'^® changed our course, and steered 
 away N.W. by W. in order to reach some of our Emr- 
 lish islands, where I hoped for relief; but our vovwre 
 was otherwise determined ; for being in the latitude of 
 12 degrees 18 minutes, a second storm came upon ua. 
 which carried us away with the same impetuosit^ 
 westward, and drove us so out of the very way of all 
 human commerce, that had all our lives been saved, 
 as to the sea, we were rather in danger of beinff 
 devoured by savages than ever returning to our owS 
 country. 
 
 In this distress, the wind still blowing very hard, one 
 of our men early in the morning cried out, ' Land ' ' 
 and we had no sooner ran out of the cabin to look out, 
 in hopes of seeing whereabouts in the world we were, 
 but the ship struck upon a sand, and in a moment, her 
 motion being so stopped, the sea broke over her in such 
 a manner, that we expected we should all have perished 
 immediately; and we were immediately driven into 
 our close quarters, to shelter us from the very foam 
 and spray of the sea. ^ 
 
 It is not easy for any one, who has not been in the 
 like condition, to describe or conceive the consternation 
 of men in such cu-cumstences. We knew nothimr 
 
 Svo« ''\T*' *"" "I^? ^^""^ ^°^ it ^M we were 
 • Tfi whether an island or the main, whether 
 inhabited or not inhabited ; and as the n^e of the 
 wind was still great, though rather less thai at fim 
 we could not so much as hope to have the ship hold many 
 
 by a kind of miracle, should turn immediately about 
 In a word, we sat looking one upon another, and 
 SS/"^**' every moment, and Tvery man i^tiS^ 
 was little or nothing more for us to do in this. That

 not break yet, and that the master said the wind began 
 to abate. 
 
 Now, though we thought that the wind did a little 
 abate, yei the ship having thus struck upon the sand, 
 and sticking too fast for us to expect her getting off, 
 we were in a dreadful condition indeed, and had 
 nothing to do but to think of saving our lives as well 
 as we could. We had a boat at our stem just before 
 the storm, but she was first staved by dashing against 
 the ship's rudder, and in the next place, she broke 
 away, and either sunk, or was driven off to oea, so 
 there was no hope from her ; we had another boat on 
 board, but how to get her off into the sea was a doubt- 
 ful things However, there was no room to debate, for 
 we fancied the ship would break in pieces every 
 minute, and some told us she was actually broken 
 already. 
 
 In this distress, the mate of our vessel lays hold of 
 the boat, and with the help of the rest of the men they 
 got her slung over the ship's side ; and getting all into 
 her, let go, and committed ourselves, being eleven in 
 number, to God's mercy, and the wild sea ; for though 
 the storm was abated considerably, yet dhe sea went 
 dreadfiil high upon the shore, and might well be called 
 den wild zee, as the Dutoh call the sea in a storm. 
 
 And now our case was very dismal indeed, for we all 
 saw plainly that the sea went so high, that the boat 
 could not live, and that we shomd be inevitably 
 drowned. As to making sail, we had none ; nor, if 
 we had, could we have done anything with it ; so we 
 worked at the oar towards the limd, though with heavy 
 hearts, like men going to execution, for we all knew 
 that when Uie boat came nearer the shore, she would 
 be dashed in a thousand pieces by the breach of the 
 sea. However, we committed our souls to God in the 
 most earnest manner ; and the wind driving us towards 
 the shore, we hastened our destruction with our own 
 hands, pulling as well as we could towards land. 
 
 What the shore was, whether rock or sand, whether 
 steep or shoal, we knew not ; the only hope that could 
 
 
 rationaUjr give us the least shadow of expectation was. 
 If we m^ht happen into some bay or gulf, or the 
 mouth of some river, where by trnAt chance we miirht 
 have run our boat in, or got under the lee of the land, 
 and perhaps made smooth water. But there was 
 nothing of this appeared ; but as we made nearer and 
 nearer the shore, the laud looked more frightful than 
 
 Clio SGft* 
 
 After we had rowed, or rather driven, about a league 
 and a half, as we reckoned it, a raging wave, mountoin- 
 iike, came roUmg astern of us, and plainly bade us 
 expect the eoupdegrdce. In a word, it took us with 
 such a fury, that it overset the boat at once: and 
 separating us, as weU from the boat as from one another, 
 gave us not time hardly to «ay, ' O God ! ' for we were 
 all swallowed up m a moment. 
 
 Nothing can describe the confusion of thought which 
 I felt when I sunk into the water ; for though I swam 
 very well, yet I could not Ijliver myself from the 
 waves so as to draw breath, till that wave having 
 driven me, or rather carried me, a vast way on towards 
 the shore, and having spent itself, went back, and left 
 me upon the land almost dry, but half dead with the 
 water I took m. I had so much presence of mind, as 
 weU a^ breath left, that seeing myself nearer the main- 
 land than I expected, Igot upon my feet, and endeavoured 
 to make on towards the knd as fast as I could, before 
 another wave should return and take me up again 
 But I soon found it was impossible to avoid it : for I 
 saw the sea come after me as high as a great hiU, and 
 
 Sl^^flw ^ !° r^?"7' "^^'^ ^ ^»d °o means or 
 strength to contend with. My business was to hold 
 my breath, and raise myself upon the water, if I could • 
 and so, by swimming to preserve my breathing, and 
 pilot myself towards the shore, if possible ; my gSktest 
 concern now being, that the sea, L it would cfrry me 
 a great way towards the shore when it came on, might 
 
 towaSrtUea!"'' '^"^ "^^' '' ^^*" '' ^^ »-«^ 
 The wave that came upon me again, buried me at 
 
 
 once 20 or 30 feet deep in its own body, and I could 
 feel myself carried with a mighty force and swiftness 
 towards the shore a very great way ; but I held my 
 breath, and assisted myself to swim still forward with 
 all my might. I was ready to burst with holdLog my 
 breath, when, as I felt myself rising up, so, to my 
 immediate relief, I found my h«id and hands shoot out 
 above the surface of the water ; and though it was 
 not two seconds of time that I could keep myself so, 
 yet it relieved me greatly, gave me breath and new 
 courage. I was covrred again with water a good 
 while, but not so long but 1 held it out ; and finding 
 the water had spent itself, and began to return, I 
 struck forward against the return of the waves, and 
 felt ground again with my feet. I stood still a few 
 moments to recover breath, and till the water went 
 from me, and then took to my heels and ran with what 
 strength I had farther towards the shore. But neither 
 would this deliver me from the fury of the sea, which 
 came pouring in after me again, and twice more I was 
 lifted up by the waves and carried forwards as before, 
 the shore being very flat. 
 
 The last time of these two had well near ueen fatal 
 to me ; for the sea, having hurried me along as before, 
 landed me, or rather dashed me, against a piece of 
 a rock, and that with such force^ as it left me senseless, 
 and indeed helpless, as to my own deliverance ; for the 
 blow taking my side and breast, beat the breath as it 
 were quite out of my body ; and had it returned again 
 immediately, I must have been strangled in the water. 
 But I recovered a little before the return of the waves, 
 and seeing I should be covered again with the water, I 
 resolved to hold fast by a piece of the rock, and so to 
 hold my breath, if possible, till the wave went back. 
 Now as the waves were not so high as at first, being 
 near land, I held my hold till the wave abated, and 
 then fetched another run, which brought me so near 
 the shore, that the next wave, though it went over 
 me, yet did not so swallow me up as to carry me 
 away, and the next run I took I got to the mainland, 
 
 
 where, to my great comfort, I clambered ur the clifFi 
 of the shore, and sat me down upon the grass ft«e 
 from danger, and quite out of the reach of the water 
 
 I was now landed, and safe on shore, and began to 
 look up and thank God that my life was saved in a case 
 wherein there was some minutes before scarce any room 
 to hope. I believe it is impossible to express to the life 
 what the ecstasies and trausports of the soul are when 
 It IS so saved, as I may say, out of the very grave : and 
 1 do not wonder now at that custom, viz., that when 
 a male&ctor, who has the halter about his neck is tied 
 up, and just going to be turned off, and has a reprieve 
 brought to him— I say, I do not wonder that they brin^ 
 a surgeon with it, to let him blood that very momeS 
 they teU him of it, that the surprise may not drive 
 the animal spirits from the heart, and overwhelm 
 him : 
 
 For radden Joys, Uke griefs, confound at first 
 
 I walked about on the shore, lifting up my hands 
 and my whole being, as I may say, wrapt up in the 
 contemplation of my deliverance, making a thousand 
 gestures and motions which 1 cannot describe, reflectiniP 
 upon all my comrades that were drowned, and that thwS 
 should not be one soul saved but myself; for, as for them 
 1 never saw them afterwards, or any sign of them' 
 except three of their hats, one cap, and two shoes that 
 were not fellows. 
 
 I cast my eyes to the stranded vessel, when the 
 breach and froth of the sea being so big, 1 could hardly 
 see It, It lay so far off, and considered. Lord ! how w^ 
 It possible I could get on shore ? 
 
 After I had solaced my mind with the comfortable 
 part of my condition, I began to look round me to see 
 what kind of place I was in, and what was next to be 
 done, and I soon found my comforts abate, and that, in 
 a word, I had a dreadful deliverance ; for I was wet, 
 bad no clothes to shift me, nor anything either to 
 eat or drink to comfort me, neither diT I see any 
 prospect before me but that of perishing with hunger 
 
 
 or beinff devoured hj wild beasts ; sad that which was 
 particularly afflicting to me was, that 1 had no weapon 
 either to hunt and kill any creature for my sustenance, 
 or to defend myself against any other creature that 
 might desire to kill me for theirs. In a word, I had 
 nothing about me but a knife, a tobarco-pipe, and a 
 little tobacco in a box. This was all my provision ; and 
 this threw me into terrible agonies of mind, that for a 
 while I ran about like a madman. Night coming upon 
 me, I began, with a heavy heart, to consider what would 
 be my lot if there were any ravenous beasts in that 
 country, seeing at night they always come abroad for 
 their prey. 
 
 All the remedy that offered to my thoughts at that 
 time was, to get up into a thick bushy tree like a fir, 
 but thorny, which grew near me, and where I resolved 
 to sit all night, and consider the next day what death I 
 should die, for as yet I saw no prospect of life. 
 I walked about a furlong from the shore, to see if I 
 could find ^y fresh water to drink, which I did, to 
 mv great joy; and having drank, and put a little 
 tobacco in my mouth to prevent hunger, I went to tiie 
 tree, and getting up into it, endeavoured to place 
 myself so, as that if I should sleep 1 might not fa'' ; 
 and having cut me a short stick, like a trunche 'n, 
 for my defence, I took up my lodging, and ha ',ig 
 been excessively fatigued, I fell fast asleep, and -iept 
 as comfortably as, I believe, few could have done 
 in my condition, and found myself the most refreshed 
 with it that I think I ever was on such an occasion. 
 
 When I waked it was broad day, the weather clear, 
 and the storm abated, so that the sea did not rage and 
 swell as before. But that which surprised me most 
 was, that the ship was lifted off in the night from the 
 sand where she ' y, by the swelling of tte tide, and 
 was driven up alu;08t as far as the rock which I first 
 mentioned, where I had been so bruised by the 
 dashing me against it This being within about a 
 mile from the shore where I was, ana the ship seeming 
 to stand upright still, I wished myself on board. 
 
 
 that, at l6Mt, I might have lome necesiary thiiun for 
 my uae. ^ 
 
 When I oame down from my apartment in the tree 
 I looked about me apin, and the fint thing I found 
 was the boat, which lay aa the wind and the tea had 
 towed her up upon the land, about two mUea on my 
 right hand. J walked as far as I could upon the shore 
 to have got to her, but found a neck or mlet of water 
 between me and the boat, which was about half a mile 
 broad ; so I came back for the present, being more 
 intent upon getUng at the ship, where I hopedTto find 
 something for my present subsistence. 
 
 A litUe after noon 1 found the sea very calm, and 
 the tide ebbed so far out, that I could come within 
 a quarter of a mile of the ship ; and here I found a 
 fresh renewing of my grief, for I saw evidently, that if 
 we had kept on board we had been all safe, that is to 
 say, we had all got safe on shore, and I had not been 
 so miserable as to be left entirely destitute of all comfort 
 and company, as I now was. This forced tears from 
 my eyes a«»n ; but as there was littie relief in that. I 
 resolved, if possible, to get to the ship ; so I pulled off 
 my clothes, for the weather was hot to extremity, and 
 took the water. But when I came to the ship, my 
 difficulty was stdl greater to know how to get on 
 board ; for as she ky aground, and high out of the 
 w^ter, there was nothing within my reach to ky hold 
 of; I swam round her twice, and the second time I 
 spied a small piece of a rope, which I wondered I did 
 not see at first, hang down by the fore-chains so low. 
 as that with great difficulty I got hold of it, and b^ 
 the help of that rope got up into the forecasUe of the 
 snip. Here I found that the ship was bulged, and had 
 a great deal of water in her hold, but thatlhe lay so on 
 the side of a bank of hard sand, or rather earth, that 
 In- «,^™,Jfyj»fte<i "P upon the bank, and her head 
 low ^most to the water. 6y this means all her quarter 
 was free, and all that was in that part was dry ; forVou 
 may be sure mv first work was to search and to see 
 what was spoiled and what was free. And first I found 
 
 
 that all theshipS p .,/iBionf were dry and untouched 
 by the water; aud !w ig very well disposed to eat, I 
 went to the brr ' . n and filled my pockets with 
 biscuit, and eat i a< I ^ent about other things, for I 
 had no time U ' • . * also found some rum in the

 It was in vai • »!+ s 'i aud wish for what was not 
 to be had, and t is ei. irity roused my application. 
 We had several «r>are va..i-.. and two or three large 
 spars of wood, aud a spare top-mast or two in the 
 ship. I resolved to fall to work with these, and flung 
 as many of them overboard as I could manage for 
 their weight, tying every one with a rope, that they 
 might not drive away. When this was done I went 
 down the ship's side, and, pulling them to me, I tied 
 four of them fest together at both ends as well as ! 
 could, in the form of a raft ; and laying two or three 
 short pieces of plank upon them crossways, I found 
 I could walk upon it very well, but that it was not 
 able to bear any great weight, the pieces being too 
 light So I went to work, and with the carpenter's 
 saw I cut a spare top-mast into three lengths, and 
 added them to my raft, with a great deal of labour 
 and pains; but hope of furnishing myself with 
 necessaries encouraged me to go l^yond what I 
 should have been able to have done upon another 
 occasion. 
 
 My raft was now strong enough to bear any reason- 
 able weight. My next care was what to load it with, 
 and how to preserve what I laid upon it from the surf 
 of the sea ; but I was not long considering this. I first 
 laid all the planks or boards upon it that I could get, 
 and having considered well what I most wanted, J 
 first got three of the seamen'? chests, which I had 
 broken open and emptied, and lowered them down 
 upon my raft. The first of these I filled with provisions.

 neither sail, oar, or rudder; and the least capful of 
 wind would have overset all my navigation. 
 
 I had three encouragements. 1. A smooth, calm 
 ea. 2. The tide rising and setting in to the shoi^. 
 3. What little wind there was blew me towards the 
 land. And thus, having found two or three broken 
 oars belonging to the boat, and besides the tools which 
 were in the chest, I found two saws, an axe, and a 
 hammer, and with this cargo I put to sea. For a 
 mile or thereabouts my raft went very well, only that 
 I found it drive a little distant from the place where 
 I had landed before, by which I perceived that there 
 was some indraft of the water, and consequently 1 
 hoped to find some creek or river there, which I 
 might make use of as a port to get to land with my 
 cargo. 
 
 As I imagined, so it was ; there appeared before me a 
 little opening of the land, and I found a strong current 
 of the tide set into it, so I guided my raft as well as 
 I could to keep in the middle of the stream. But here 
 I had like to have suffered a second shipwreck, which, 
 if I had, I think verily would have broke my heart ; 
 for knowing nothing of the coast, my raft ran aground 
 at one end of it upon a shoal, and not being aground at 
 the other end, it wanted but a little that all my ca-^go 
 had slipped off towards that end that was afloat, and so 
 fallen into the water. I did my utmost by setting my 
 back against the chests to keep them in their places, 
 but could not thrust off tJie rart with all my strength, 
 neither durst I stir from the posture I was in, but 
 holding up the chests with all my might, stood in that 
 manner near half an hour, in which time the rising of 
 the water brought me a little more upon a level ; and a 
 little after, the water still rising, my raft floated again, 
 and 1 thrust her off with the oar I had into the channel, 
 and then driving up higher, I at length found myself in 
 the mouth of a little river, with land on both sides, 
 and a strong current or tide running up. I looked 
 on both sides for a proper place to get to shore, 
 for I was not willing to be driven too high up th 
 
 river, hopinif in time to see some ship at sea and

 a great way oflF, and two small islands less than thk, 
 which lay about three leagues to the west. 
 
 I found also that the island 1 was in was barren, and, 
 as I saw good reason to believe, uninhabited, except by 
 wild beasts, of whom, however, I saw none ; yet 1 saw 
 abundance of fowls, but knew not their kinds ; neither, 
 when I killed them, could I tell what was fit for food, 
 and what not. At my coming back, I shot at a great 
 bird which I saw sitting upon a tree on the side of a 
 great wood. I believe it was the first gun that had 
 been fired there since the creation of the world. I had 
 no sooner fired, but from all the parts of the wood there 
 arose an innumerable number of fowls of many sorts 
 making a confused screaming, and crying every one 
 according to his usual note ; but not one of them of any 
 kind that I knew. As for the creature 1 killed, I took 
 it to be a kind of a hawk, its colour and beak resem- 
 bling it, but had no talons or claws more than common ; 
 its flesh was carrion, and fit for nothing. 
 
 Contented with this discovery, I came back to my 
 raft, and fell to work to bring my cargo on shore, 
 which took ne up the rest of that day ; and what to do | 
 with myself at night, I knew not, nor indeed where to 
 rest ; for I was afraid to lie down on the ground, not 
 knowing but some wild beast might devour me, though, 
 as 1 afterwards found, there was really no need for ^ 
 those fears. However, as well as I could, I barricaded ' 
 myself round with the chests and boards that I had 
 brought on shore, and made a kind of a hut for that 
 night's lodging ; as for food, I • et saw not which way 
 to supply myself, except that 1 nad seen two or three 
 creatures like hares run out of the wood where 1 shot 
 the fowl. 
 
 1 now began to consider, that 1 might yet get a great 
 many things out of the ship, which would be usetul to 
 me, and particularly some of the rigging and sails, and 
 such other things as might come to land; and I 
 resolved to make another voyage on board the vessel, 
 if possible. And as I knew that the first storm that 
 blew must necessarily break her all in pieces, I rewlved 
 
 
 S«"l?? other thin« apart till I ^ot everythinir out of

 However, I spared her a bit, I say, and she went to it, 
 smelled of it, and ate it, and loolced (as pleased) for 
 mere ; but I thanked her, and could spare no more, so 
 she marched off. 
 
 Having got my second cargo on shore, though I was 
 tain to open the barrels of powder and bring them by 
 parcels, for they were too heavy, being large casks, I 
 went to work to make me a little tent with the sail and 
 some poles which I cut for that purpose ; and into this 
 tent I brought everything that I knew would spoil 
 either with rain or sun ; and I .piled all the empty 
 chests and casks up in a circle round the tent, to fortify 
 It from any sudden attempt, either from man or beast 
 When I had done this I blocked up the door of the 
 tent with some boards within, and an empty chest set 
 up on end without ; and spreading one of the beds upon 
 the ground, laying my two pistols just at my head, and 
 my gun at length by me, I went to bed for the first 
 time, and slept very quietly all night, for I was very 
 weary and heavy ; for the night before I had slept little, 
 and had laboured verv hard all day, as well to fetch 
 all those things from the ship, as to get them on shore. 
 I had the biggest magazine of all kinds now that ever 
 was laid up, I believe, for one man ; but I was not 
 satisfied still, for while the ship sat upright in that 
 posture, I thought I ought to get everything out of her 
 that I could. So every day at low water I went on 
 board, and brought away something or other; but 
 particularly, the third time I went I brought away as 
 much of the rigging as I could, as also all the small 
 ropes and rope-twine I could get, with a piece of spare 
 canvas, which was to mend the sails upon occasion, the 
 barrel of wet gunpowder ; in a word, I brought awav 
 all the sails first and last, only that I was fain to cut 
 theni m pieces, and bring as much at a time as I could ; 
 for they were no more useful to be sails, but as mere 
 canvas only. 
 
 But that which comforted me more still was, that at 
 last of all, after I had made five or six such voyages as 
 these, and thought I had nothing more to expect from

 fcegin to rise. However, at low water I went on board, 
 and though I thought I had rummaged the cabin m 
 effectually as that nothing more could be found, yet I 
 discovered a locker with drawers in it, in one of which 
 1 found two or three razors, and one pair of large scissors, 
 with some ten or a dozen of good knives and forks; 
 in another, I found about thirty-six pounds value in 
 money, some European coin, some Brazil, some pieces 
 of eight, some gold, some silver. 
 
 I smiled to myself at the sight of this money. 'O 
 drug! sai4 I aloud, *what art thou good for? 
 1 hou art not worth to me, no, not the taking off of 
 the ground ; one of those knives is worth aU this heap. 
 1 have no manner of use for thee ; even remain where 
 thou art, and go to the bottom as a creature whose Ufe 
 is not worth saving.' However, upon second thoughts. 
 
 and the wind began to rise, and in a quarter of an hour 
 
 it blew a fresh gale from the shore. It presently 
 
 occurred to me that it was in vain to pretend to make 
 
 a raft with the wind off shore, and that it was my 
 
 business to be gone before the tide of flood began. 
 
 otherwise I might not be able to reach the shore at all. 
 
 Accordingly 1 let myself down into the water, and 
 
 s^m across the channel, which lay between the ship 
 
 and the sands, and even that with difficulty enough, 
 
 partly with the weight of the things I had about me, 
 
 and parUy the roughness of the water ; for the wind 
 
 rose very hastily, and before it was quite high water it 
 
 blew a storm. *

 very hard all that night, and in the morning, when I

 was I little surprised, but recovered myself with this 
 Mtisfkctory reflection, viz., that I had lost no time, nor 
 abated no diligence, to get everything out of her that 
 could be usefiil to me, and that indeed there was little 
 
 
 left in her that I was able to bring away if I had had

 ^ these to a sufficient Quantity, and was in a fair way 
 to provide myself in such a manner, as to live without 
 my ffun when my ammunition was spent ; so that I had 
 !. ? r i* '"^'^ of subsisting without any want as long 
 \a' F^'l ^ considered from the beginning howl 
 would provide for the accidents that mig?t bappln, and 
 for the time that was to come, even not only after my 
 ammunition should be spent, but even after my health 
 or strength should decay. 
 
 I confess I had not entertained any notion of my 
 ammunition being destroyed at one blast—I mean, my 
 powder being blown up by lightning ; and this madi 
 the thoughts of It so surprising to me when it lightened 
 and thundered, as 1 observed just now. 
 
 And now being to enter into a melancholy relation 
 of a scone of silent life, such, perhaps, as was never 
 heard of in the worid before, I shall toke it from ite 
 beginning and continue it in its order. It was, by my 
 account, the 30th of September when, in the maLniJ

 place ; for I carried both tK- .?t '^y something m i.s 
 
 
 I wanted nothing that he could fetch me, nor any com- 
 pany that he could make up to me ; I only wanted to 
 have him talk to me, but that would not do. As I 
 observed before, I found pen, ink, and pap«r, and I 
 husbanded them to the utmost; and I shall show that 
 while my ink Listed, I kept things very exact ; but 
 after that was gone, I could not, for I could not make 
 any ink by any means that I could devise 
 
 And this put me in mind that I wanted many things, 
 notwithstanding all that 1 had amassed together; and 
 of these, this of ink was one, as also spade, pick-axe. 
 and shovel, to dig or remove the earth, needles, pins 
 and thread ; as for linen, I soon learned to want that 
 without much difficulty. 
 
 This want of tools made every work I did go on 
 heavilv ; and it was near a whole year before I had 
 entirelyfinished my Uttle pale or surrounded habita. 
 tion The piles or stakes, which were as heavy as I 
 could well lift, were a long time in cutting and prepar- 
 ing m the woods, and more by fiu- in bringing home; 
 so that I snent BomAtimma tnm /i..,. :» r..*f: i 
 
 ttriving it .-.^ v«« gtuuuu , iwr wnicn purpose i arot a 
 heavy piece of wood at first, but at last bethought 
 myself of one of the iron crows, which, however, 
 though I found It, yet it made driving those posts or 
 piles very laborious and tedious work. 
 
 But what need I have been concerned at the tedious- 
 ne^ of anything I had to do, seeing I had time enough 
 to do It in? nor had 1 any other employment, if that 
 had been over, at least, that I could foresee, except the 
 ranging the island to seek for food, which I did more 
 or less every day. 
 
 I now began to consider seriously my condition, and 
 the circumstance I was reduced to ; and 1 drew up the 
 state of my affairs in writing ; not so much to leave 
 them to any that were to come after me, for I was like 
 to have but few heirs, as to deliver my thoughts from 
 daUy ponng upon them, and afflicting my mind. And 
 M my reason began now to master my despondency, 1

 But I am in a hot cli-

 But I am cast on an

 as I saw on the coast of 
 Africa ; and what if I had 
 been shipwrecked there .^ 
 
 But God wonderfully 
 sent the ship in near 
 enough to the shore, that 
 1 have gotten out so 
 many necessMy things as 
 will either supply my 
 wants, or enable me to 
 supply myself even as 
 long as I live. 
 
 
 Upon the whole, here was an undouhted testimony, 
 that there was scarce any condition in the world so 
 miserable, but there was something negative or some- 
 thing positive to be thankful for in it ; and let this 
 stand as a direction from the experience of the moat 
 miserable of all conditions in this world, that we may 
 always find in it something to comfort ourselves from, 
 and to set in the description of good and evil on the 
 credit side of the account. 
 
 Having now brought my mind a little to relish my 
 condition, and given over looking out to sea, to aea if 
 I could spy a ship ; I say, giving over these things, I 
 began to apply myself to accommodate my way of living, 
 and to make things as easy to me as I could. 
 
 I have already described my habitation, which was 
 a tent under the side of a rock, surrounded with a 
 strong pale of posts and cables ; but I might now rather 
 call it a wall, for I raised a kind of wall up against it 
 of turfe, about two feet thick on the outside, and after 
 some time— I think it was a year and a half— I raised 
 rafters from it leading to the rock, and thatched or 
 covered it with boughs of trees and such things as I 
 could get to keep out the rain, which I found at some 
 times of the year very violent. 
 
 I have already observed how I brought all my goods 
 into this pale, and into the cave which I had made 
 behind me. But I must observe, too, that at first this 
 was a confused heap of goods, which as they lay in no 
 order, so they took up all my place ; I had no room 
 to turn myself. So 1 set myself to enlarge my cave 
 and works &rther into the earth ; for it was a loose 
 sandy rock, which yielded easily to the labour I bestowed 
 on it And so, when I found I was pretty safe as to 
 beasts of prey, I worked sideways to the right hand 
 into the rock ; and then, turning to the right again, 
 worked quite out, and made me a door to come out on 
 the outside of my nale or fortification. This gave me 
 not only egress and regress, as it were a back-way to 
 my tent and to my storehouse, but gave me room to 
 stow my goods.

 been to be seen, it looked like a general magazine of all 
 necessary things ; and I had everything so ready at ny 
 hand, that it was a great pleasure to me to see all my 
 goods in such order, and especially to find my stock of 
 all necessaries so great. 
 
 And now it was when I began to keep a journal of 
 every day's employment ; for, indeed, at first, I was in 
 too much hurry, and not only hurry as to labour, but 
 in too much discomposure of mind ; and my journal 
 would have been full of many dull things. For ex- 
 ample, 1 must have said thus: .Si^. the 30*4.— After I 
 got to shore, and had escaped drowning, instead of being 
 thankful to God for ray ddi«eranc«, having int vomited 
 with the great ^uanti^ of salt «)rter which was gottas 
 into my stonnch, and recovering mya^ a Bttle, I iwi 
 about the slwre, wringing my hands, and beating ray 
 head and face, exclaiming at my misery, and crying out, 
 I was undcme, undone, till, tired and faint, I was forced 
 to lie down on the ground to repose ; but durst not rfeep, 
 for fear of beinisr devoured. 
 
 Some days after this, and after I had been on board 
 &e ship, and got all that I could out of her, yet I 
 could not forbear getting up to the top of a little 
 mountain, and looking out to sea, in hopes of seeing a 
 ship ; then fancy at a vast distance I spied a sail, please 
 myself with the hopes of it, and then, after looking 
 steadily till I was almost blind, lose it quite, and sit 
 down and weep like a child, ami thus increase my 
 misery by my folly. 
 
 But having gotten over these things in some measure, 
 and having settled my houseb<^d stuff and habitation, 
 made me a table and a chair, and all as handsome about 
 me as I could, I began to keep my journal, of which I 
 shall here give you the copy (though in it will ka told 
 aU these particulars over again) as long as it lasted ; for, 
 having no more ink, 1 was forced to leave it off.

 grew older they flew all away, which, perhaps, was at 
 first tor want of feeding them, for I had nothing to give 
 them However, I frequently found their nests, and 
 got their young ones, which were very good meat 
 
 And now in the managing my household affairs I 
 found myself wanting in many things, which I thought 
 at hrst It was impossible for me to make, as indeed, as 
 to some of them, it was. For instance, I could never 
 make a cask to be hooped ; I had a small runlet or 
 two, as I observed before, but I could never arrive to 
 the capacity of making one by them, though I spent 
 many weeks about it I could neither put in the 
 heads or jomt the staves so true to one another, as to 
 make them hold water ; so I gave that also over. 
 
 In the next place, I was at a great loss for candle ; 
 so that as soon as ever It was dark, which was generally 
 by seven o clock, I was obliged to go to bed. J 
 remembered the lump of beeswax with which I made 
 candles m my African adventure, but I had none of 
 
 u^}v^7'a ^® "."^J" ""^^^^y ' ^^ ^as. that when 1 
 had killed a -cat I saved the tallow, and with a little 
 dish made of clay, which I baked in the sun, to which 
 
 aTU * "^'^^ of some oakum, I made me a lamp ; 
 and this gave me light, though not a clear steady 
 light like a candle. ^ 
 
 In the middle of ail my labours it happened, that 
 rummagingr my things, I found a little b^, which, as 
 I hinted before, had been filled with ^m for th^ 
 feeding of poultry, not for this voyage, but before, as I 
 suppose, when tbe ship came from Lisbon. What 
 httle remainder of corn had been in the bag was all 
 devoured with the rats, and I saw nothing i? the baff 
 but husks and dust ; and being willing to have the bal 
 for some other use, I think it was to put powder m 
 when I divided it for fear of the lightning^or Lme 
 such use, I shook the husks of com out of it on one 
 «de of my fortification, under the rock. It was a little

 all this WM nothing but what was common ; thouirh I 
 ought to have been as thankful for so strange and 
 unforeseen providence, as if it had been miraculous : 
 for It was really the work of Providence as to me, that 
 should order or appoint, that ten or twelve grains of 
 corn should remain unspoiled (when the rats had 
 destroyed all the rest), as if it had been dropped from 
 heaven; as also that I should throw it out in thrt 
 particular place, where, it being in the shade of a hiirh 
 rock. It sprang up immediately ; whereas, if I hid 
 thrown It anywhere else at that time, it had been burnt 
 up and destroyed. 
 
 I carefully saved the ears of this corn, you may be 
 sure, in their season, which wasab«jut the end of June • 
 and laying up every corn, I resolved to sow them all 
 again, hoping m time to have some quantity sufficient 
 to supply me with bread. But it was not till the fourth

 80 ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 
 
 After the third shock was over, and I felt no more 
 tor some time, I began to take courage ; and yet I had 
 not heart enough to go over my waU again, for fear 
 of being buned alive, but sat still upon the ground, 
 greatly cast down and disconsolate, not knowing what 
 to do. All thi whUe I had not the least serious 
 religious thought, nothing but the common, ' Lord 
 have mercy upon me ! ' and when it was over, that 
 went away too. ' 
 
 While I sat thus, I found the air overcast, and irrow 
 cloudv, as if it would rain. Soon after that the wind 
 rose by little and litUe, so that in less than half an 
 hour It blew a most dreadful hurricane. The sea was 
 all on a sudden covered over with foam and froth • the 
 shore was covered with the breach of the water • the 
 trees were torn up by the roots ; and a terrible storm it 
 was ; and this held about three hours, and then began 
 to abate; and m two hours more it was stark «2ni 
 and began to rain very hard. * 
 
 AU this while I sat upon the ground, very much 
 terrified and dejected ; when on a sudden it came into 
 my thoughts, that these winds and rain being the con- 
 sequences of the earthquake, the earthquake itself was

 tent was ready to be beaten down with it, and 1 wi 
 torced to go into my cave, though very much afraid and 
 uneasy, for fear it should fall on my head. 
 
 This violent rain forced me to a new work, viz., to 
 cut a hole through my new fortification, like a sink, to 
 let the water go out, which would else have drowned 
 my cave. After I had been in my cave some time, and 
 lound still no more shocks of the earthquake follow I 
 began to be more composed. And now to support my 
 spirits, which indeed wanted it very much, I went to 
 my little store, and took a small sup of rum, which 
 however, I did then, and always, very sparingly! 
 knowing I could have no more when that was gonei.

 very hard, and came home very much tired, and had 
 thoughts of ffiving it over. 
 
 May 7.— Went to the wreck ajfain, but with an 
 intent not to work, but found the weight of the 
 wreck had broke itself down, the beams being cut ; 
 that several pieces of the ship seemed to lie loose, 
 and the inside of the hold lay so open, that I could 
 see into it, but almost full of water and sand. 
 
 May 8.— Went to the wreck, and carried an iron 
 crow to wrench up the deck, which lay now quite 
 clear of the water or sand. I wrenched open two 
 
 Flanks, and brought them on shore also with the tide, 
 left the iron crow iu the wreck for next day. 
 
 iu«y 9.— Went to the wreck, and with the crow 
 made way into the body of the wreck, and felt 
 several casks, and loosened them with the crow, but 
 could not break them up. i felt also the roll of 
 English lead, and could stir it, but it was too heavy 
 to remove. 
 
 May 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.— Went every day to the 
 wreck, and got a great deal of pieces of timber, and 
 boards, or plank, and two or three hundredweight 
 of iron. 
 
 May 15.— I carried two hatchets to ti, 'f I could 
 not cut a piece oflF of the roll of lead,' by placing? 
 the edge of one hatchet, and driving it with the 
 other ; but as it lay about a foot and a half in the 
 water, I could not make any blow to drive the 
 hatchet 
 
 May 16.— It had blowed hard in the night, and the 
 wreck appeared more broken by the force of the water ; 
 but I stayed so long in the woods to get pigeons for 
 food, that the tide prevented me going to the wreck 
 that day. 
 
 May 17. — I saw some pieces of the wreck blowu 
 on shore, at a great distance, near two miles off me, 
 but resolved to see what they were, and found it was 
 a piece of the head, but too heavy for me to bring 
 away.

 June 22.— A little better, but under dreadful appre-

 then a violent headache. 
 
 June 24.— Much better. 
 
 June 26.— An ague very violent ; the fit held me 
 seven hours; cold fit, and hot, with faint sweats 
 after it 
 
 June 26. — Better ; and having no victuals to eat, took 
 my gun, but found myself very weak. However, I killed 
 a she-goat, and with much difficulty got it home, and 
 broiled some of it, and eat I would fain have stewed 
 it, and made some broth, but had no pot 
 
 June 27.— The ague again so violent that I lay abed 
 all day, and neither eat or drank. I was ready to perish 
 for thirst ; but so weak, I had not strength to stand up, 
 or to ffet myself anv water to drink. Prayed to God 
 agun, but was light-headed ; and when I was not, I was 
 so ignorant that I knew not what to say ; only I lay 
 and cried, 'Lord, look upon me! Lord, pity r\e! Lord, 
 have mercy upon me ! ' I suppose I did nothing else for 
 two or three hours, till the ht wearing off, I fefi asleep, 
 and did not wake till far in the night When I waked, 
 I found myself much refreshed, but weak, and exceeding 
 thirsty. However, as I had no water in my whole 
 habitation, I was forced to lie till morning, and went to 
 sleep again. In this second sleep I had this terrible 
 dream. 
 
 I thought that I was sitting on the ground, on the 
 outside of my wall, where I sat when the storm blew 
 after the -'thquake, and that I saw a man descen*! 
 from a fe. . black cloud, in a bright flame of fire, ami 
 light upon the ground. He was all over as bright as a 
 flame, so that I could but just bear to look towards him. 
 His countenance was most inexpressibly dreadful, im- 
 possible for words to describe. When he stepped upon 
 the ground with his feet, I thought the eaHh trembled, 
 just as It had done before in the earthq lake, and all

 88 ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 
 
 punishment for my sin ; my rebellious behaviour 
 against my father, or my present sins, which were 
 great; or so much as a punishment for the general 
 course or my wicked life. When J was on the desperate 
 expedition on the desert shores of Africa, I never 
 had so much as one thought of what would become 
 of me ; or one wish to God to direct me whither I 
 should go, or to keep me from the danger which 
 apparency surrounded me, as well from voracious 
 creatures as cruel savages. But I was merely thought- 
 less of a God or a Providence; acted like a mere 
 brute from the principles of Nature, and by the dictates 
 of common sense only, and indeed hardly that. 
 
 "WTien I was delivered and taken up at sea by the 
 Portugal captain, well used, and dealt justly and 
 honourably with, as well as charitably, I had not the 
 least thankfulness in my thoughts. When again J 
 was shipwrecked, ruined, and in danger of drowning 
 on this island, I was as far from remorse, or looking 
 on it as a judgment; I only said to myself often, 
 that I was an unfortunate dog, and bom to be always 
 miserable. 
 
 It is true, when I got on shore first here, and 
 found all my ship's crew drowned, and myself spared, 
 I was surprised with a kind of ecstasy, and some trans- 
 ports of soul, which, had the grace of God assisted, 
 might have come up to true thankfulness ; but it ended 
 where it begun, in a mere common flight of joy, or, as 
 I may say, being glad 1 was alive, without the least 
 reflection upon the distinguishing goodness of the hand 
 which had preserved me, and had singled me out to 
 be preserved, when all the rest were destroyed ; or an 
 inquiry why Providence had been thus merciful to me; 
 even just the same common sort of joy which seamen 
 generally have after they are got safe ashore from a 
 shipwreck, which they drown all in the next bowl of 
 punch, and forget almost as soon as it is over, and all 
 the rest of my life was like it. 
 
 Even when I was afterwards, on due consideration, 
 made sensible of my condition, how 1 was cast on this

 to God, though I cannot say they were either a prayer 
 attended with desires or with hopes ; it was rather the 
 voice of mere fright and distress. My thoughts were 
 confused, the convictions great upon my mind, and the 
 horror of dying in such a miserable condition, raised 
 vapours into my head with the mere apprehensions; 
 and in these hurries of my soul, I know not what 
 my tongue might express ; but it was rather exclama- 
 tion, such as, ' Lord ! what a miserable creature am 
 I ! If I should be sick, I shall certainly die for want 
 of help; and what will become of mer' Then the 
 tears burst out of my eyes, and I could say no more 
 for a good while. 
 
 In this interval, the good advice of my father came 
 to my mind, and presently his prediction, which I 
 mentioned at the beginning of this story, viz., that if 
 I did take this foolish step, God would not bless me, 
 and I would have leisure hereafter to reflect upon 
 having neglected his counsel, when there might be 
 none to assist in my recovery. ' Now,' said I aloud, 
 ' my dear father's words are come to pass ; God's 
 justice has overtaken me, and I have none to help or 
 hear me. I rejected the voice of Providence, which 
 had mercifully put me in a posture or station of life 
 wherein I might have been happy and easy ; but I 
 would neither see it myself, or learn to know the 
 blessing of it from my parents. I left them to mourn 
 over my folly, and now I am left to mourn under the 
 consequences of it. I refused their help and assistance, 
 who would have lifted me into the world, and would 
 have made everything easy to me ; and now I have 
 difficulties to struggle with, too great for even Nature 
 itself to support, and no assistance, no help, no com- 
 fort, no advice.' Then I cried out, 'Lord, be my 
 help, for I am in great distress.' 
 
 This was the first prayer, if I may caU it so, that 
 I had made for many years. But I return to my 
 journal. 
 
 June 28. — Having been somewhat refreshed with 
 the sleep I had had, and the fit being entirely off, I 
 
 got up ; and though the fright and terror of mv d«.^m

 And if nothing happens without His knowledge, He 
 knows that I am here, and am in this dreadful condi- 
 tion. And if nothing happens without His appoint- 
 ment, He has appointed all this to hefall me. 
 
 Nothing occurred to my thoughts to contradict any 
 of these conclusions ; and therefore it rested upon me 
 with the greater force, that it must needs be that God 
 had appointed all this to be&ll me ; that I was brought 
 to this miserable circumstance by His direction, He 
 having the sole power, not of me only, but of every- 
 thing that happened in the world. Immediately it 
 followed. Why has God done this to me } What have 
 I done to be uius used ? 
 
 My conscience presently checked me in that inquiry, 
 as if I had blasphemed, and methought it spoke to me 
 like a voice : * Wretch ! dost thou ask what thou 
 hast done ^ Look back upon a dreadful misspent life, 
 &nd ask thyself what thou nast not done.'' Ask, why is 
 it that thou wert not long ago destroyed .'' Wliy wert 
 thou not drowned in Yarmouth Roads; killed in the 
 fight when the ship was taken by the Sallee man-of- 
 war ; devoured by the wild beasts on the coast of 
 Africa ; or drowned here, when all the crew 
 perished but thyself? Dost thou ask. What have I 
 done .'' ' 
 
 I was struck dumb with these reflections, as one 
 astonished, and had not a word to say, no, not to 
 answer to myself, but rose up pensive and sad, walked 
 back to my retreat, and went up over my wall, as if 
 I had been going to bed. But my thoughts were 
 sadly disturbed, and I had no inclination to sleep ; so 
 1 sat down in my chair, and lighted my lamp, for it 
 began to be dark. Now, as the apprehension of the 
 return of my distemper terrified me very much, it 
 occurred to my thought that the Brazilians take no 
 physic but their tobacco for almost all distempers; 
 and 1 had a piece of a roll of tobacco in one of the 
 chests, which was quite cured, and some also that was 
 green, and not quite cured. 
 
 I went, directed by Heaven no doubt; for in this

 made a great impression upon me, and I mused upon 
 the?Ji very often. 
 
 Ii, g^ew now late, and the tobacco had, as I said, 
 dozed my head so much, that I inclined to sleep ; so 
 I left my lamp burning in the cave, lest I should want 
 anything in the night, and went to bed. But before I 
 lav down, I did what I ne^^er had done in all my life ; 
 I kneeled down, and prayed to God to fulfil the promii t 
 to me, that ?f I called upon Him in the day of trouble. 
 He would deliver me. After my broken and imperfect 
 prayer was over, I drank the rum in which I had 
 steeped the tobacco ; which was so strong and rank of 
 the tobacco, that indeed I could scarce get it down. 
 Immediately upon this I went to bed. I found presently 
 It flew up in my head violently; but I fell into a sound 
 sleep, and waked no more till, by the sun, it must 
 necessarily be near three o'clock in the afternoon the 
 next day. Nav, to this hour I am partly of the opinion 
 that I slept all the next day and night, and till almost 
 three that day after ; for otherwise I knew not how 
 I should lose a day out of my reckoning in the days 
 of the week, as it appeared some years after I had 
 done. For if I had lost it by crossing and re-crossing 
 the line, I should have lost more than one day. But 
 certainly I lost a day in my account, and never knew 
 which way. 
 
 Be that, however, one way or the other, when I 
 awaked I found myself exceedingly refreshed, and my 
 spirits lively and cheerful. ^Vhen I got up, I wm 
 stonerer Ijian I was the day before, and my stomach 
 better, for I was hungry ; and, in short, I had no fit 
 the next day, but continued much altered for the 
 better. This was the 29th. 
 
 The 30th was my well day, of course, and I went 
 abroad with my gun, but did not care to travel too far. 
 1 killed a sea-fowl or two, something like a brandl 
 goose, and brought them home, but was not very for- 
 ward to eat them ; so I eat some more of the turtle's 
 ^gs, which were very good. This evening I renewed

 ran seriously in my thought I was earnestly betrging 
 of God to give me repentance, when it happened pro- 
 videntially, the very day, that, reading the Scripture, 
 I came to these words, * He is exalted a Prince and a 
 Saviour, to give repentance, and to give remission.' 1 
 threw down the book ; and with my heart as well as 
 my hands lifted up to heaven, in a kind of ecstasy of 
 joy, I cried out aloud, * Jesus, Thou son of David ! 
 Jesus, Thou exalted Prince and Saviour, give me 
 reventance ! ' 
 
 This was the first time that I could say, in the true 
 sense of the words, that 1 prayed in all my life ; for 
 now I prayed with a sense of my condition, and with a 
 true Scripture view of hope founded on the encourage- 
 ment of the Word of God ; and from this time, I may 
 say, I began to have hope that God would hear me. 
 
 Now I began to construe the words mentioned above, 
 * Call on Me, and I will deliver you,' in a different 
 sense from what I had ever done before ; for then I 
 had no notion of anything being called deliverance but 
 my being delivered from the captivity I was in; for 
 though I was indeed at large in the place, yet the 
 island was certainly a prison to me, and that in the 
 worst sense in the world. But now I learned to take 
 it in another sense ; now I looked back upon my past 
 life with such horror, and my sins appearetf so drea^ul, 
 that my soul sought nothing of God but deliverance 
 from the load of guilt that bore down all my comfort. 
 As for my solitary life, it was nothing ; I did not so 
 much as ^ray to be delivered from it, or think of it ; 
 it was all of no consideration, in comparison to this. 
 And I add this part here, to hint to whoever shall read 
 it, that whenever they come to a true sense of things, 
 they will find deliverance from sin a much greater 
 blessing than deliverance from aflBiction. 
 
 But leaving this part, I return to my journal. 
 
 My condition began now to be, though not less 
 miserable as to my way of living, yet much easier to 
 my mind ; and my thoughts being directed, I " a 
 constant reading the Scripture, and praying to God,

 more than a little brook of runuinff water, and very 
 fresh and good ; but this being the orv leaaon, there 
 was hardly any water in some parts of it, at least, not 
 enough to run in any stream, so as it could be per- 
 ceived. 
 
 On the banic of this brook I found many pleasant 
 savannas or meadows, plain, smooth, and covered with 
 grass ; and on the rising parts of them, next to the 
 higher grounds, where the water, as might be supposed . 
 never overflowed, I found a great deal of tobacco, ^«en,' 
 and growing to a great and very strong stalk. There 
 were divers other plants, which I had no notion of, or 
 understanding about, and might perhaps have virtues 
 of their own, which I could not find out 
 
 I searched for the cassava root, which the Indians, in 
 all that climate, make their bread of, but I could find 
 none. I saw large plants of aloes, but did not then 
 understand them. I saw several sugar-canes, but wild, 
 and, for want of cultivation, imperfect I contented 
 myself with these discoveries for this time, and came 
 back, musing with myself what course I might take to 
 know the virtue and goodness of any of the fruits or 
 plants which I should discover ; but could bring it to 
 no conclusion ; for, in short, I had made so little 
 observation while I was in the Brazils, that I knew 
 little of the plants in the field, at least very little that 
 might serve me to any purpose now in my distress. 
 
 The next day, the 16th, I went up the same way 
 again , and after going something farther than I had 
 gone th^day before, I found the brook and the savannas 
 began to cease, and the country became more woodv 
 ihan before. In this part I found diflFerent fruits, and 
 particularly I found melons upon the ground in great 
 abundance, and grapes upon the trees. The vines had 
 spread indeed over the trees, and the clusters of grapes 
 were just now in their prime, very ripe and rich. This 
 was a surprising discovery, and I was exceeding glad 
 of them ; but 1 was warned by my experience to eat 
 sparingly of them, remembering that when I was ashore 
 in Barbary the eating of grapes killed several of our

 of gnpM M limes and lemoni to fiirnidi tnytelf for 
 the wet Maton, which I Icnew waa apprMching. 
 
 In order to thi«, I gathered a great heap of grapea in 
 one place, and a lesser heap in another place, and a 
 great parcel of Mmes and lemons in another place ; 
 and, taking a few of each with me, I travelled home- 
 ward ; and resolved to come again, and bring a bag or 
 sack, or what I could make, to carry the rest home. 
 
 Accordingly, having spent three days in this journey, 
 I came home (ao I must now call my tent and my 
 cave); but before I got thither, the grapes were 
 spoiled ; the richness of the fruits, and the weight of 
 the juice, having broken them and bruised them, they 
 were good for little or nothing : as to the limes, they 
 were good, but 1 could bring but a few. 
 
 Tlie next day, being the lUth, I went !iacl, having 
 made me two small bags to bring home my harv-'t ; 
 but I was surprised, when, coming to mv heap of 
 ^pes, which were so rich and fine when 1 gathered 
 them, I found them all spread about, trod to pieces, 
 and dragged about, some here, some there, and abund- 
 ance eaten and devoured. By this I concluded th-^re 
 were some wild creatures thereabouts, which had c le 
 this ; but what they were, I knew not 
 
 However, as I found that there was no laying them 
 up on heaps, and no carrying them away in a sack, but 
 that one way they would be destroyed, and the other 
 way they would be crushed with their own weight, 
 I took another course ; for I gathered a large quantity 
 of the giftpes, and hung them up upon the out-branches 
 of the trees, that they might cure and dry in the sun ; 
 and as for the limes and lemons, I carried as many 
 back as I could well stand under. 
 
 When I came home from this journey, I contem- 
 plated with great pleasure the fruitfulness of that valley, 
 and the pleasantness of the situation ; the security 
 from storms on that side the water and the wood ; 
 and concluded that I had pitched upon a place to fix 
 my abode, which was by far the worst part of the 
 country. Upon the whole, I began to consider of

 raisins of the sun ; so I began to take them down 
 from the trees. And it was very happy that I did so^ 
 for the rains which followed would have spoiled them, 
 and I had lost the best part of my winter food ; for 
 I had above two hundred larffe bunches of them. No 
 sooner had I taken them all down, and carried most 
 of them home to my cave, but it began to rain ; and 
 from hence, which was the 14th of August, it rained, 
 more or less, every day till the middle of October, 
 and sometimes so violcnUy, that I could not stir out of 
 my cave for several days. 
 
 In this season, I was much surprised with the 
 increase .of my fiimily. I had been concerned for 
 the loss of one of my cats, who run away from me, 
 or, as I thought, had been dead, and I heard no more 
 tale or tidings of her, till, to my astonishment, she 
 came home about the end of August with three 
 kittens. This was the more strange to me, because, 
 though I had killed a wild cat, as I called it, with 
 my gun, yet I thought it was a quite different kind 
 from our European cats ; yet the young cats were the 
 same kind of house-breed like the old one ; and both 
 my cats being females, I thought it very strange. But 
 from these three cats I afterwards came to be so 
 pestered with cats, that I was forced to kiU them like 
 vermin, or wild beasts, and to drive them from my 
 house as much as possible. 
 
 From the 14th of August to the 26th, incessant 
 rain, so that I could not stir, and was now very 
 carefuknot to be much wet. In this confinement, 1 
 began to be straitened for food ; but venturing out 
 twice, I one day killed a goat, and the last day, which 
 was the 26th, found a very large tortoise, which 
 was a treat to me, and my food was regulated thus : 
 I eat a bunch of raisins for my breakfast, a piece of 
 the goat's flesh, or of the turtle, for my dinner^ 
 broiled ; for, to my great misfortune, I had no vessel 
 to boil or stew anything; and two or three of the 
 turtle's eggs for my supper.

 my experience before I had it^ and this I am going to 
 relate was one of the most discouraging experiments 
 that I made at all. I have mentioned that I had saved 
 the few ears of barley and rice, which I had so sur- 
 prisingly found spring up, as I thought, of themselves, 
 and believe there were about thirty stalks of rice, and 
 about twenty of barley ; and now I thought it a proper 
 time to sow it after the rains, the sun being in its 
 southern position, going from me. 
 
 Accordingly I dug up a piece of ground as well as I 
 could with my wooden spade, and dividing it into two 
 parts, I so^ed my grain; but as I was sowing, it 
 casually occurred to my thoughts that I would not 
 sow it all at first, because 1 did not know when was 
 the proper time for it, so I sowed about two-thirds of 
 the seed, leaving about a handful of each. 
 
 It was a great comfort to me afterwards that I did 
 so, for not one grain of that I sowed this time came to 
 anything, for the dry months following, the earth 
 having had no rain after the seed was sown, it had 
 no moisture to assist its growth, and never came up 
 at all till the wet season had come again, and then 
 it grew as if it had been but newly sown. 
 
 Finding my first seed did not grow, which I easily 
 imagined was by the drought, I sought for a moister 
 piece of ground to make another trial in, and I dug 
 up a piece of ground near my new bower, and sowed 
 the rest of my seed in February, a little before the 
 vernal equinox. And this having the rainy months of 
 March and April to water it, sprung up very pleasantly, 
 and yielded a very good crop ; but having part of the 
 seed left only, and not daring to sow all that I had, 
 I had but a small quantity at last, my whole crop not 
 amounting to above half a peck of each kind. But by 
 this experiment I was made master of my business, and 
 knew exactly when the proper season was to sow, and 
 that I might expect two seed-times and two harvests 
 every year. 
 
 While this com was growing, I made a little dis- 
 covery, which was of use to me afterwards. A^ soon

 The rainy season sometimes held longer or shorter 
 as the winds happened to blow, but this was the general 
 observation I made. After I had found by experience 
 the ill consequence of being abroad in the rain, I took 
 care to furnish myself with provisions beforehand, *hat 
 I might not be obliged to go out ; and I sat witain 
 
 very 
 
 -, -— p occasion of 
 
 many thmgs which I had no way to furnish myself 
 with but by hard labour and constant application; 
 particularly, I tried many wavs to make myself a 
 basket ; but all the twigs I could get for the purpose 
 proved so brittle, that tiiey would do nothing. It 
 proved of excellent advantage to me now, that when I 
 was a boy I used to take great delight in standing at 
 a basket-maker's in the town where my father lived, to 
 see them make their wicker-ware ; and being, as boys 
 usually are, very officious to help, and a great observer 
 of the manner how they worked those things, and 
 some+imes lending a hand, I had by this means full 
 knowledge of the methods of it, that I wanted nothing 
 but the materials ; when it came into my mind that the 
 twigs of that tree from whence I cut my stakes that 
 grew might possibly be as tough as the sallows, and 
 willows, and osiers in England, and I resolved to try. 
 
 Accordingly, the next day, I went to my country 
 house, as 1 called it ; and cutting some of the smaller 
 twigs, I found them to my purpose as much as I could 
 desire ; whereupon I came the next time prepared with 
 a hatchet to cut down a quantity, which I soon found,

 When I had passed the vale where my bower stood, as 
 above, I came within view of the sea to the west ; and 
 It being a very clear day, I fairlv descried land, whether 
 an island or a continent I could ..ot teU ; but it lay very 
 high, extending from the west to the W.S.W. at a very 
 great distance ; bv my guess, it could not be less thai 
 fifteen or twenty leagues off. 
 
 I could not tell what part of the world this might 
 be, otherwise than that I know it must be part of 
 America, and, as I concluded, by aU my observations, 
 must be near the Spanish dominions, and perhaps wa^ 
 all inhabited by savages, where, if J should have landed. 
 1 had been m a worse condition than I was now : and 
 therefore I acquiesced in the dispositions of Providence, 
 which I began now to own and to believe ordered 
 everything for the best. I say, I quieted my mind with 
 tins, and left afflicting myself with fruitless wishes of 
 being there. 
 
 Besides, after some pause upon this affair, I con- 
 sidered that if this land was the Spanish coast, I should 
 certainly, one time or other, see some vessel pass or 
 repass one way or other ; but if not, then it 4a8 the 
 savage coast between the Spanish country and Brazils, 
 which are indeed the worst of savages; for they are 
 cannibals or men-eaters, and fail not to murder and 
 
 w".l*ll*^® ^"'"*" ^''^'^^ *h*t ^" into their hands. 
 
 With these considerations I walked very leisurely 
 forward. I found that side of the island, where I now 
 was, much pleasanter than mine, the open or savanna 
 fields sweet, adorned with flowers and grass, and full of 
 very fine woods. 
 
 I saw abundance of parrots, and fain I would have 
 caught one, if possible, to have kept it to be tame, and 
 taught It to speak to me. I di^ after some pains- 
 taking, catch a young parrot, for I knocked it down 
 with a stick, and having recovered it, I brought it 
 home ; but it was some years before I could make him 
 speak. However, at last I taught him to call me by my 
 name very familiarly. But the accident that followed, 
 though It be a trifle, wiU be very diverting in its place

 I confess this side of the country was muchjpleasanter 
 than mine ; but yet I had not the least inclination to 
 remove, for as I was fixed in my habitation, it became 
 natural to me, and 1 seemed all the while I was here to 
 be as it were upon a journey, and from home. How- 
 ever, I travelled along the shore of the sea towards the 
 east, I suppose about twelve miles, and then setting up 
 a great pole upon the shore for a mark, I concluded 1 
 would go home again ; and that the next journey I took 
 should be on the other side of the island, east from my 
 dwelling, and so round till I came to my post again ; 
 of which in its place. 
 
 I took another way to come back than that I went, 
 thinking I could easily keep all the island so much in 
 my view, that I could not miss finding my first dwell- 
 ing by viewing the country. But I found myself mis- 
 taken ; for being come about two or three miles, I 
 found myself descended into a very large valley, but 
 so surrounded with hills, and those hills covered with 
 wood, that I could not see which was my way by any 
 direction but that of the sun, nor even then, unless I 
 knew very well the position of the sun at that time of 
 the day. 
 
 It happened to my farther misfortune, that the 
 weather proved hazy for three or four days while 1 
 was in this valley ; and not being able to see the sun, I 
 wandered about very uncomfortably, and at last was 
 obliged to find out the seaside, look for my post, and 
 come back the same way I went; and then by easy 
 journeys I turned homeward, the weather being exceed- 
 ing hot, and my gun, ammunition, hatchet, and other 
 things very heavy. 
 
 In this journey my dog surprised a young kid, and 
 seized upon it, and I running in to take hold of it, 
 caught it, and saved it alive from the dog. I had a 
 great mind to bring it home if I could, for I had often 
 been musing whether it might not be possible to get a 
 kid or two, and so raise a breed of tame goats, which 
 might supply me when my powder and shot should be 
 all spent

 day I came there. I ipent the whole day in humble 
 and thankful acknowledgments of the many wonderful 
 mercies which my solitcry condition was attended with, 
 and without which it mi^ht have been infinitely mo;-e 
 miserable. I gave humble and hearty thanks that God 
 had been pleased to discover to me even that it was 
 iwssible I might be more happy in this solitary condi- 
 tion, than I should have been in a liberty of society, 
 and in all the pleasures of the world ; that He could 
 fully make up to me the deficiencie!> of my solitary 
 state, and the want of human society, by His presence, 
 and the communications of His grace to my soul, 
 supporting, comforting, and encouraging me to depend 
 upon His providence here, and hope for His eternal 
 presence hereafter. 
 
 It was now that I began sensibly to feel how much 
 more happy this life I now led was, with all its miser- 
 able circumstances, than the wicked, cursed, abominable 
 life I led all the past part of my days. And now I 
 changed both my sorrows and my joys ; my very de- 
 sires altered, my aflFections changed their gusts, and 
 my delights were perfectly new from what they were 
 at my first coming, or indeed for the two years past. 
 
 Before, as I walked about, either on my hunting, or 
 for viewing the country, the anguish of my soul at my 
 condition would break out upon me on a sudden, and 
 my very heart would die within me, to think of the 
 woods, the mountains, the deserts I was in, and how 
 I was a prisoner, locked up with the eternal bars and 
 bolts of the ocean, in an uninhabited wilderness, without 
 redemption. In the midst of the greatest composures 
 of my mind, this would break out upon me like a storm, 
 and make me wring my hands, and weep like a child. 
 Sometimes it would take me in the midtfle of my work, 
 and I would immediately sit down and sigh, and look 
 upon the ground for an hour or two together ; and this 
 was still worse to me, for if I could burst out into tears, 
 or vent myself by words, it would go off, and the grief, 
 having exhausted itself, would abate. 
 But now I began to exercise myself with new

 114 ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 
 
 my time, according to the leveral daily employments 
 that were before me, such as, first, my duty to God, 
 and the reading the Scriptures, which I constantly set 
 apart some time for, thrice every day ; secondly, the 
 going abroad with my ^un for food, which generally 
 toolc me up three hours in every morning, when it did 
 not rain ; thirdly, the ordering, curing, preserving, and 
 cooking what I had killed or catched for my supply ; 
 these took up great part of the day ; also, it is to be 
 considered tliat the middle of the day, when the sun 
 was in the zenith, the violence of the heat was too great 
 to stir out ; so that about four hours in the evening was 
 all the time I could be supposed to work in, with this 
 exception, that sometimes I changed my hours of hunt- 
 ing and working, and went to work in the morning, and 
 abroad with my gun in the afternoon. 
 
 To this short time allowed for labour, I desire may 
 be added the exceeding laboriousness of my work ; the 
 many hours which, for want of tools, want of help, and 
 want of skill, everything I did took up out of my time. 
 For example, I was full two and forty days making me 
 a board for a long shelf, which T r i; ted in my cave ; 
 whereas two sawyers, with their toolsand a saw-pit, would 
 have cut six of them out of the same tree in half a day. 
 My case was this : it was to be a large tree which 
 was to be cut down, because my board was to be a 
 broad one. This tree I was three days a-cutting down, 
 and two more cutting oflF the boughs, and reducing it to 
 a ^og, or piece of timber. With inexpressible hacking 
 and hewing, I reduced both the sides of it luio chips 
 till it begun to be light enough to move ; then I turned 
 it, and made one side of it smooth and flat as a board 
 from end to end ; then turning that side downward, 
 cut the other side, till I brought the plank to be about 
 three inches thick, and smooth on both sides. Any 
 one may judge the labour of my hands in such a piece 
 of work ; but labour and patience carried me through 
 that, and many other things. I only oUerve this in 
 particular, to show the reason why so much of my time 
 went away with so little work, viz., that what might

 116 ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 
 
 This touched me sensihiv, for I foresaw that in a few 
 days they would devour all my hopes, that I should be 
 starved, and never be able to raise a crop at all, and 
 what to do I could not tell. However, I resolved not 
 to lose my com, if possible, though I should watch it 
 night and day. In the first place, I went among it to 
 see what dan age was already done, and found they 
 had spoiled a good deal of it ; but that as it was yet 
 too green for them, the loss was not so great but that 
 the remainder was like to be a good crop if it could be 
 saved. 
 
 I stayed by it to load my gun, and then coming away, 
 1 could easily see the thieves sitting upon all the trees 
 about me, as if they only waited till I was gone away. 
 And the event proved it to be so ; for as I walked off, 
 as if 1 was gone, I was no sooner out of their sight 
 but they dropped down, one by one, into the corn again. 
 1 was so provoked, that I could not have patience 
 to stay till more came on, knowing that every grain 
 that they eat now was, as it might be said, a peck-loaf 
 to me in the consequence ; but coming up to the hedge, 
 I fired again, and killed three of them. This was 
 what I wished for ; so I took them up, and served them 
 as we serve notorious thieves in England, viz. , hanged 
 them in chains, for a terror to others. It is impossible 
 to imagine almost that this should have such an effect 
 as it had, for the fowls would not only not come at the 
 corn, but, in short, they forsook all that part of the 
 island, and I could never see a bird near the place as 
 long as my scare-crows hung there. 
 
 lliis I was very glad of, you may be sure ; and about 
 the latter end of December, which was our second 
 harvest of the year, I reaped my crop. 
 
 I was sadlv put to it for a scythe or a sickle to cut it 
 down, and all I could do was to make one as well as I 
 could out of one of the broadswords, or cutlasses, which 
 1 saved among the arms out of the ship. However, as 
 my first crop was but small, I had no great difficulty to 
 cut it down ; in short, I reaped it my way, for I cut 
 nothing off but the ears, and carried it away in a great 
 
 
 ket which I ha^ ...Jc, and m rubbed it .,.f „:.x. __

 of the performance. WTien the com was sowed, I 
 had no harrow, but was forced to go over it myself, 
 and drag a great heavy bough of a tree over it, to 
 scratch it, as it may be called, rather than rake or 
 harrow it. 
 
 When it was growing and grown, I have observed 
 already how man^ things I wanted to fence it, secure 
 it, mow or reap it, cure and carry it home, thrash, 
 part it from the chaff, and save it Then I wanted 
 a mill to grind it, sieves to dress it, yeast and salt 
 to make it into bread, and an oven to bake it, and yet 
 all these things I did without, as shall be observed ; 
 and yet the com was an inestimable comfort and 
 advantage to me too. All this, as I said, made every- 
 thing laborious and tedious to me, but that there was 
 no help for ; neither was my time so much loss to me, 
 because, as I had divided it, a certain part of it was 
 every day appointed to these works, and as I resolved 
 to use none of the com for bread till I had a greater 
 quantity by me, I had the next six mouths to apply 
 myself wholly, by labour and invention, to furnish 
 myself with utensils proper for the performing all the 
 operations necessary for the making the corn, wheu 
 I had it, fit for my use. 
 
 But first I was to prepare more land, for I had now 
 seed enough to sow above an acre of ground. Before 
 I did this, I had a week's work at least to make me 
 a spade, which, wheu it was done, was but a sorry one 
 indeed, and very heavy, and required double labour to 
 work with it. However, I went through that, and 
 sowed my seed in two large flat pieces of ground, as 
 near my house as I could find them to my mind, and 
 fenced them in with a good hedge, the stakes of which 
 were all cut of that wood which I had set before, and 
 knew it would grow; so that in one year's time 1 
 knew I should have a quick or living hedge, that 
 would want but little repair. This work was not so 
 little as to take me up less than three months, because 
 great part of that time was of the wet 8ea.son, when I 
 could not go abroad.

 on purpose for them, that they might not break ; and 
 as between the pot and the basket there was a little 
 room to spare, I stuffed it full of the rice and barley 
 straw, and these two pots being to stand always dry, 
 I thought would hold my dry corn, and perhaps the 
 meal, when the corn was bruised. 
 
 Though I miscarried so much in my design for large 
 pots, yet I made several smaller things with better 
 success ; such as little round pots, flat dishes, pitchers, 
 and pipkins, avd any things my hand turned to ; and 
 the heat of tl sun baked them strangely hard. But 
 all this would -lo*^ answer my end, which was to get 
 an earthen po o Mold what was liquid, and bear the 
 fire, which none of these could do. It happened after 
 some time, making a pretty large fire for cooking my 
 meat, when I went to put it out after I had done with 
 it, I found a broken piece of one of my earthenware 
 vessels in the tire, burnt as hard as a stone, and red 
 as a tile. I was agreeably surprised to see it, and 
 said to myself, that certainly they might be made to 
 burn whole, if they would burn broken. 
 
 This set me to studying how to order my fire, so 
 as to make it bum me some pots. I had no notion 
 of a kilu, such as the potters burn in, or of glazing 
 tLem with lead, though I had some lead to do it with ; 
 but I placed three large pipkins, and two or three pots 
 in a pile, one upon another, and placed my firewood 
 all round it, with a great heap of embers under them. 
 I plied the fire with fresh fuel round the outside, and 
 upon the top, till 1 saw the pots in the inside red-hot 
 quite through, and observed that they did not crack 
 at all. When I saw them clear red, I let them stand 
 in that heat about five or six houia, till I found one 
 of them, chough it did not crack, did melt or run, for 
 the sand which was mixed with the clay melted by the 
 ^olence of the heat, and would have run into glass, 
 if I had gone on ; so I slacked my fire gradually ull 
 the pots b^n to abate of the red colour ; and watch- 
 ing them aU night, that I might not let the fire abate 
 too last, '.n the morning I had three very good, I will

 and infinite labour^ made a hollow place in it, as the 
 Indians in Brazil make their canoes. After this, I 
 made a great heavy pestle, or beater, of the wood 
 called the iron-wood ; and this I prepared and laid by 
 against I had my next crop of corn, when I proposed 
 to myself to grind, or rather pound, my corn into 
 meal, to make my bread. 
 
 My next difficulty was to make a sieve, or search, 
 to dress my meal, and to part it from the bran and the 
 husk, without which I did not see it possible I could 
 have any bread. This was a most difficult thing, so 
 much as but to think on, for to be sure I had nothing 
 like the necessary thing to make it ; I mean fine thin 
 canvas or stuff, to search the meal through. And here 
 I was at a full stop for many months, nor did I really 
 know what to do ; linen I had none left, but what was 
 mere rags ; I had goats'-hair, but neither knew I how 
 to weave it or spin it ; and had I known how, here 
 was no tools to work it with. All the remedy that I 
 found for this was, that at last I did remember I had, 
 among the seamen's clothes which were saved out of 
 the ship, some neckcloths of calico or muslin ; and with 
 some pieces of these I made three small sieves, but 
 proper enough for the work ; and thus I made shift for 
 some years. How I did afterwards, I shall show in 
 its place. 
 
 'Tie baking part was the next thing to be considered, 
 ani how I should make bread when I came to have 
 corn ; for, first, I had no yeast As to that part, as 
 there was no supplying the want, so I did not concern 
 myself much about it ; but for an oven I was indeed in 
 great pain. At length I found out an experiment for 
 that also, which was this : I made some earthen vessels 
 very broad, but not deep, that is to say, about two 
 feet diameter, and not above nine inches deep ; these 
 I burned in the fire, as I had done the other, and laid 
 them by ; and when I wanted to bake, I made a great 
 fire upon my hearth, which I had paved with some 
 square tiles, of my own making and burning also ; but 
 I should not call them square.

 i ad, and I was not without secret wishes that I were 
 on shore there, fancying the seeing tho mainhind, and 
 m an inhabited country, I might find some way or 
 other to convey myself farther, and perhaps at last find 
 some means of escape. 
 
 But all this while I made no allowance for the 
 dangers of such a condition, and how 1 might fall into 
 the hands of savages, and perhaps such as I might have 
 reason to think far worse than the lions and tigers of 
 Africa ; that if I once came into their power, I should 
 run a hazard more than a thousand to one of being 
 killed, and perhaps of being eaten ; for I had heard 
 that the people of the Caribbean coasts were cannibals 
 or man-eaters, and 1 knew by the latitude that I could 
 not be far off from that shore. That suppose they were 
 not cannibals, yet that they might kifl me, as many 
 Europeans who had fallen into their hands had been 
 served, even when they had been ten or twenty to- 
 gether, much more I, that was but one, and could make 
 little or no defence ; all these things, I say, which I 
 ought to have considered well of, and did cast up in 
 my thoughts afterwards, yet took up none of my appre- 
 hensions at first, but my head ran mightily upon the 
 thought of getting over to the shore. 
 
 Now I wished for my boy Xury, and the long-boat 
 with the shoulder-of-mutton sail, with which I sailed 
 above a thousand miles on the coast of Africa ; but 
 this was in vain. Then I thought I would go and look 
 at our ship's boat, which, as I have said, was blown up 
 upon the shore a great way, in the storm, when we 
 were first cast away. Sho lay almost where she did at 
 hrst, but not quite ; and was turned, by the force of 
 the waves and the winds, almost bottom upward, against 
 a high ridge of beachy rough sand, but no water about 
 ner, as before. 
 
 1 ^^ \^^^ ^^ ^*°*^^ *® ^*^® refitted her, and to have 
 launched her into the water, the boat would have done 
 well enough, and I might have gone back into the 
 Brazils with her easily enough ; but 1 might have 
 foreseen that I could no more turn her and set her

 Jne would have thought I could not havo had tl»e 
 least reflection upon my mind of my circumstance 
 while I was making this boat, but I should havt. 
 immediately thought how I should get it into the sea ; 
 but my thoughts were so intent upon my voyage over 
 the sea in it, that I never once considered howl should 
 get it off of the land ; and it was really, in its own 
 nature, more easy for me to guide it over forty-five 
 miles of sea, than about forty-five fathoms of land, 
 where it lay, to set it afloat in the water. 
 
 I vent to work upon this boat the most like a fool 
 that ever man did who had any of his senses awake. I 
 pleased myself with the design, without determining 
 whether 1 was ever able to undertake it Not but 
 that ihe diflSculty of launching my boat came often into 
 my head ; but I put a stop to my own inquiries into it, 
 by this foolish answer which I gave myself, ' Let's first 
 m,*;- it ; I'll warrant I'll find some way or other to 
 g'-; ii along when 'tis done.' 
 
 This was a most preposterous method ; but the 
 eagerness of my fancy prevailed, and to work I went. 
 I felled a cedar tree: I question much whether 
 Solomon ever had such a one for the building of the 
 Temple at Jerusalem. It was five feet ten inches dia- 
 meter at the lower part next the stump, and four feet 
 eleven inches diameter at the end of twenty-two feet, 
 after which it lessened for awhile, and then parted into 
 branches. It was not without infinite labour that I 
 felled this tree. I was twenty days hacking and hewing 
 at it at the bottom ; I was fourteen more getting the 
 branches and limbs, and the vast spreading head of it 
 cut off, which I hacked and hewed through with axe 
 and hatchet, and inexpressible labour. After this, it 
 cost me a month to shape it and dub it to a proportion, 
 and to something like the bottom of a boat, that it 
 might swim upright as it ought to do. It cost me 
 near three months more to clear the inside, and work 
 it so as to make an exact boat of it This I did, indeed, 
 without fire, by mere mallet and chisel, and by the dint 
 of hard labour, till I had brought it to oe a very hand-

 In the middle of thig work I linighed my fourth year 
 in this place, and kept my anniverwry with the rame 
 devotion, and with m much comfort as ever before ; for 
 by a constant study and serious application of the Word 
 of Ood, and by the assistance of His grace, I gained a 
 different knowledge from what I had before. I enter- 
 tained different notions of things. I looked now upon 
 the world as a thing remote, which I had nothing to 
 do with, no expectation from, and, indeed, no desires 
 about In a word, I had nothing indeed to do with it 
 nor was ever like to have ; so I thought it looked, as 
 we may perhaps look upon it hereafter, viz., as a place 
 I had lived in, but was come out of it; and well miirht 
 I say, as father Abraham to Dives, ' Between me and 
 thee IS a great gulf fixed.' 
 
 In the first place, I was removed from all the 
 wickedness of the world here. I had neither the lust 
 of the flesh, the lust of the eye, or the pride of life. I 
 had nothing to covet, for I had all that I was now 
 capable of enjoying. 1 was lord of the whole manor • 
 or, if 1 pleased, I might call myself king or emperor 
 over the whole country which I had possession if. 
 There were no rivals : I had no competitor, none to 
 dispute sovereignty or command with me. I might 
 have raised ship-loadings of corn, but I had no use for 
 it ; so I let as little grow as I thought enough for my 
 occasion. I had tortoise or turtles enough, but now 
 and then one was as much as I could put to any use 
 I had timber enough to have built a fleet of ships. 1 
 had grapes enough to have made wine, or to have cured 
 into raisins, to have loaded that fleet when they had 
 been built 
 
 But all I could make use of was all that was valuable. 
 I bad enough to eat and to supply my wants, and what 
 was all the rest to me? U I killed more flesh than I 
 could eat, the dog must eat it, or the vermin. If I 
 sowed more corn than I could eat, it must be spoiled. 
 The trees that I cut down were lying to rot on the 
 ground ; I could make no more use of them than for 
 fuel, and that I had no occasion for but to dress my food.

 what we want, appeared to me to spring from the want 
 of thankfulness for what we have. 
 
 Another reflection was of great use to me, and 
 doubtless would be so to any one that should ^1 into 
 such distress as mine was ; and this was, to compare 
 my present condition with what I at first expected it 
 should be ; nay, with what it would certainly have 
 been, if the good providence of God had not wonder- 
 fully ordered the ship to be cast up nearer to the shore, 
 where I not only could come at her, but could bring 
 what I got out of her to the shore, for my relief and 
 comfort; without which 1 had wanted for tools to 
 work, weapons for defence, or gunpowder and shot for 
 getting my food. 
 
 I spent whole hours, I may ray whole days, in repre- 
 senting to myself, in the niosc lively colours, how I 
 must have acted if I had got nothing out of the ship. 
 How I could not have so much as got any food, except 
 fish and turtles ; and that as it was long before I found 
 any of them, I must have perished first ; that I should 
 have lived, if I had not perished, like a mere savage ; 
 that if I had killed a goat or a fowl, by any con- 
 trivance, I had no way to flay or open them, or part the 
 flesh from the skin and the bowels, or to cut it up ; but 
 must gnaw it with my teeth, and pull it with my claws, 
 like a beast 
 
 These reflections made me very sensible of the good- 
 ness of Providence to me, and very thankful for my 
 J present condition, with all its hardships and mis- 
 brtunes ; and this part also I cannot but recommend 
 to the reflection of those who are apt, in their misery, 
 to say. Is any aflliction like mine ? Let them consider 
 how much worse the cases of some people are, and 
 their case might have been, if Providence had thought 
 fit. 
 
 I had another reflection, which assisted me also to 
 comfort my mind with hopes ; and this was, comparing 
 my present condition with what I had deserved, and had 
 therefore reason to escpect from the hand of Providence. 
 I had lived a dreadftil life, perfectly destitute of the

 disposition of my circumstances, but even to a sincere 
 thankfulness for my condition ; and that I, who was 
 yet a living man, ought not to complain, seeing 1 had 
 not the due punishment of my sins ; that I enjoyed so 
 many mercies, which I had no reason to have expected 
 in that place ; that I ought never more to repine at my 
 condition, but to rejoice, and to give daily thanks for 
 that daily bread, which nothing but a crowd of wonders 
 could have brought ; that I ought to consider I had 
 been fed even by miracle, even as great as that of 
 feeding Elijah by ravens ; nay, by a long series of 
 miracles ; and that I could hardly have named a place 
 in the unhabitable part of the world where I could 
 have been cast more to my advantage ; a place where, 
 as I had no society, which was my affliction on one 
 band, so I found no ravenous beasts, no furious wolves 
 or tigers, to threaten my life ; no venomous creatures 
 or poisonous, which I might feed on to my hurt ; no 
 savages to murder and devour me. 
 
 In a word, as my life was a life ot sorrow one way, 
 so it was a life of mercy another ; and I wanted 
 nothing to make it a life of comfort, but to be able to 
 make my sense of God's goodness to me, and care 
 over me in this condition, be my daily consolation ; 
 and after I did make a just improvement of these 
 things, I went away, and was no more sad. 
 
 I had now been here so long, that many things which 
 I brought on shore for my help were either quite gone, 
 or very much wast^ and near spent My ink, as I 
 observed, had been ffone for some time, all but a very 
 little, which I eked out with water, a little and a little, 
 till it was so pale it scarce left any appearance of black 
 upon the paper. As long as it lasted, I made use of 
 it to minute down the days of the month on which any 
 remarkable thing happened to me. And, first, by casting 
 up times past, I remember that there was a strange con- 
 currence of days in the various providences which befell 
 me, and which, if I had been superstitiously inclined 
 to observe days as fatal or fortunate, I might have had 
 reason to have looked upon with a great deal of curiosity.

 ' ""^> the very heat 
 
 i '1 
 
 
 frequently blistered my skin ; whereas, with a shirt on, 
 the air itself made some motion, and whistling under 
 that shirt, was twofold cooler than without it. No 
 more could I ever bring myself to go out in the heat 
 of the sun without a cap or a hat. The heat of the sun 
 beating with such violence, as it does in that place, 
 would give me the headache presently, by darting so 
 directly on my head, without a cap or hat on, so that 
 I could not bear it ; whereas, if I put on my hat, it 
 would presently go away. 
 
 Upon those views, I began to consider about putting 
 the lew rags I had, which I called clothes, into some 
 order. I had worn out all the waistcoats I had, and 
 my business was now to try if I could not make 
 jackets out of the great watch-coats which I had by 
 me, and with such other materials as I had ; so I 
 set to work a-tailoring, or rather, indeed, a-botching, for 
 I made most piteous work of it However, I made shift 
 to make me two or three new waistcoats, which I hoped 
 would serve me a great while. As for breeches or 
 drawers, I n^ade but a very sorry shift indeed till 
 afterward. 
 
 I have mentioned that I saved the skins of all 
 the creatures that I killed, I mean four-footed ones, 
 and I had hung them up stretched out with sticks 
 in the sun, by which means some of them were so 
 dry and hard that they were fit for little, but others 
 it seems were very useful. The first thing I made 
 of these was a grtot cap for my head, with the hair 
 on the outside, to "^hoot off the rain ; and this I 
 performed so well, that after this I made me a suit 
 of clothes wholly of these skins, that is to say, a 
 waistcoat, and breeches open at knees, and both 
 loose, for they were rather wanting to keep me cool 
 than to keep me warm. I must not omit to acknow- 
 ledge that they were wretchedly made ; for if I was a 
 bad carpenter, I was a worse tailor. However, they 
 were such as I made very good shift with ; and when 
 I was abroad, if it happened to rain, the hair of my 
 waistcoat and cap being outermost, I was l:ept very dry.

 kept up just enough to have sufficient stock of one 
 years nrovisions beforehand — I say, besides this 
 yearly labour, and my daily labour of going out with 
 ^7. ?"°» } ^^^ °"« labour, to make me a canoe, 
 which at last I finished ; so that by digging a canal 
 to It of six feet wide, and four feet deep, I brought 
 It into the creek, almost half a mile. As for the Sst, 
 which was so vastly big, as I made it without con- 
 sidering beforehand, as I ought to do, how I should 
 be able to launch it ; so, never being able to bring it 
 to the water, or bring the water to it, I was obliged 
 to let It lie where it was, as a memorandum to teach 
 me to be wiser next time. Indeed, the next time, 
 though I could not get a tree proper for it, and in a 
 place where I could not get the water to it at any 
 less distance than, as I have said, near half a mile 
 jret as I saw it was practicable at last, I never gave 
 It over ; and though I was near two years about it, 
 vet I never grudged my labour, in hopes of havinir a 
 boat to go off to sea at last 
 
 However, though iny little ;)ena^t/a was finished, yet 
 the size of it was not at all answerable to the design 
 which I had in view when I made the first ; I mean, 
 of venturing over to the terra firma, where it was 
 above forty miles broad. Accordingly, the smallness 
 of my boat assisted to put an end to that design, and 
 now I thought no more of it. But as I had a boat, 
 my next design was to make a tour round the island : 
 for as 1 had been on the other side in one place 
 crossing, as J have already described it, over the land' 
 so the discoveries J made in that little journey made 
 me very eager to see other parts of the coast ; and now 
 I had a boat, I thought of nothing but sailing round 
 the island. ** 
 
 For this purpose, that I might do everything with 
 discretion and consideration, I fitted up a little mast to 
 niy boat, and made a sail to it out of some of the pieces 
 of the ship's sail, which lay in store, and of which J 
 had a great stock by me.

 Having secured my boat, I took my gun and went 
 on shore, climbing up upon a hill, which seemed to 
 overlook that point, where I saw the full extent of it, 
 and resolved to venture. 
 
 In m^ viewing the sea from that hill, where I stood, 
 I perceived a strong, and indeed a most furious current, 
 which run to the east, and even came close to the 
 point; and I took the more notice of it, because I 
 saw there might be some danger that when I came 
 into it I might be carried out to sea by the strength 
 of it, and not be able to make the island again. And 
 indeed, had I not gotten first up upon this hill, I 
 believe it would have been so ; for there was the same 
 current on the other side the island, only that it set off 
 at a &rther distance ; and I saw there was a strong 
 edd^ under the shore ; so I had nothing to do but to 
 get in out of the first current, and I should presently 
 be in an eddy. 
 
 I lay here, however, two days; because the wind, 
 blowing pretty fresh at E S.E., and that being just 
 contrary to the said currei , -^«ide a great breach of 
 the sea upon the point ; so that it was not safe for me 
 to keep too close to the shore for the breach, nor to go 
 too far off because of the stream. 
 
 The third day, in the morning, the wind having abated 
 overnight, the sea was calm, and I ventured. But I am 
 a warning piece again to all rash and ignorant pilots ; 
 for no sooner was I come to the point, when even I 
 was not my boat's length from the shore, but I found 
 myself in a great depth of water, and a current like the 
 sluice of a mill. It carried my boat along with it with 
 such violence, that all I could do could not keep her 
 so much as on the edge of it, but I found it hurried me 
 ferther and farther out from the eddy, which was on 
 my left hand. There was no wind stirring to help me, 
 and all I could do with my paddlers signified nothing. 
 And now I began to give myself over for lost ; for, as 
 the current was on both sides the island, I knew in a 
 few leagues distance they must join again, and then 
 I was irrecoverably gone. Nor did I see any

 never have known how to have gteered towards the 
 inland if I had but once lost sight of it. But the 
 weather continuing clear, I applied myself to get up 
 my mast again, and spread my sail, standing away 
 to the north as much as possible, to get out of the 
 current 
 
 Just as I had set my mast and sail, and the boat 
 began to stretch away, I saw even by the clearness of 
 the water some alteration of the current was near ; for 
 where the current was so strong, the water was foul. 
 But perceiving the water clear, I found the current 
 abate, and presently I found to the east, at a*x)ut half 
 a mile, a breach of the sea upon some rocks. These 
 rocks I found caused the current to part again ; and 
 as the main stress of it ran away more southerly, leav- 
 ing the rocks to the north-east, so the other returned 
 by the repulse of the rocks, and made a strong eddy, 
 which ran back again to the north-west with a very 
 sharp stream. 
 
 They who know what it is to have a reprieve brought 
 to them upon the ladder, or to be rescued from thieves 
 just going to murder them, or who have been in such 
 like extremities, may guess what my f<»sent surprise 
 of joy was, and how gladly I put m «at into the 
 stream of this eddy; and the wind :«!^ freshening, 
 how gladly I spread my sail to it, rtt aing cheerfuUy 
 before the wind, and with a strong tide or eddy under 
 foot. 
 
 This eddy carried me about a league in my way back 
 again, directly towards the island, but about two leagues 
 more to the northward than the current which carried 
 me away at first ; so that when I came near the island, 
 I found myself open to the northern shore of it, that is 
 to r ", the other end of the island, opposite to that 
 whi( . I went out from. 
 
 ^VTien I had made something more than a league of 
 way by the help of this current or eddy, I found it 
 was spent, and served me no fiirther. However, I 
 found that being between the two great currents, viz., 
 that on the south side, which had hurried me away, and

 Btanau ; ab ' J > .t ; for I always kept it in good order, 
 being, M I saw i - fore, my country house. 
 
 1 got aver li<> fence, and laid me down in the shade 
 to rest my limbs, for 1 was very weary, and fell asleep. 
 But judge you, if you can, that read mv story, what a 
 surprise I must be in, when 1 was waked out of my 
 sleen by a voice calling me by my name several times, 
 * Robin, Robin, Robin Crusoe, poor Robin Crusoe! 
 
 are 
 
 you; 
 
 Where are you, Robin Crusoe.* Where 
 MTiere have you been .'* ' 
 
 I was so dead asleep at first, being fatigued with 
 rowing, or paddling, as it is called, the first part of the 
 day, and with walking the latter part, that 1 did not 
 wake thoroughly ; but dozing between sleeping and 
 waking, thought I dreamed that somebody spoke to me. 
 But as the voice continued to repeat 'Robin Crusoe 
 Robin Crusoe,' at last I began to wake more perfectl) , 
 and was at first dreadfully frighted, and started up iu 
 the utmost consternation. But no sooner were my eyes 
 open, but I saw my Poll sitting on the top of the hedge, 
 and immediately knew that it was he that spoke to me ; 
 for just iu such bemoaning language I had used to talk 
 to him, and teach him ; and he had learned it so per- 
 fectly, that he would sit upon my finger, and lay his 
 bill close to my face, and cry, * Poor Robin Crusoe ! 
 Where are you ? Where have you been ? How come 
 you here r and such things as I had taught him. 
 
 However, even though I knew it was the parrot, 
 and that indeed it could be nobody else, it was a good 
 while before I could compose myself. First, i was

 perfection in my earthenware, and contrived well enough 
 to make them with a wheel, which 1 found infinitdy 
 easier and better, because I made things round and 
 shapable which before were filthy things indeed to 
 look on. But I think I was never more vain of my 
 own performance, or more joyful for anything I found 
 out, than for my being able to make a tobacco-pipe. 
 And though it was a very ugly, clumsy thing when it 
 was done, and only burnt red, like other earthenware, 
 yet as it was hard and firm, and would draw the smoke, 
 I was exceedingly comforted with it; for I had been 
 always used to smoke, and there were pipes in the 
 ship, but I forgot them at first, not knowing that there 
 was tobacco intheisland ; and afterwards, when 1 searched 
 the ship again, I could not come at any pipes at aU. 
 
 In my wicker-ware also I improved much, and made 
 abundance of necessary baskets, as well as my invention 
 showed me ; though not very handsome, yet they were 
 such as were very handy and convenient for my laying 
 things up in, or fetching things home in. For example, 
 if I killed a goat abroad, I could hang it up in a tree, 
 flay it, and dress it, and cut it in pieces, and bring it 
 home in a basket ; and the like by a tu-tle ; I could 
 cut it up, take out the eggs, and a piece or two of the 
 flesh, which was enough for me, and bring them home 
 in a basket, and leave the rest behind me. Also large 
 deep baskets were my receivers for my corn, which I 
 always rubbed out as soon as it was dry, and cured, and 
 kept it in great baskets. 
 
 I began now to perceive my powder abated consider- 
 ably, and this was a want which it was impossible for 
 me to supply, and I began seriously to consider what I 
 must do when I should have no more powder ; that is 
 to say, how I should do to kill any goats. I had, as 
 is observed, in the third year of my being here kept a 
 young kid, and bred her up tame, and I was in hope of 
 getting a ho-goat. But I could not by any means bring 
 it to pass, till my kid grew an old goat ; and I could 
 never find in my heart to kill her, till she died at last 
 of mere age.

 and taking them one by one, I tied them with strinffi 
 together, and with some difficulty brought them ul 
 home. 
 
 It was a good while before they would feed, but 
 throwing them some sweet com, it tempted them, and 
 they began to be tame. And now I found that if 1 
 expected to supply myself with goat-flesh when I had 
 no powder or shot left, breeding some up tame was my 
 only way, when perhaps I might have them about my 
 house like a flock of sheep. 
 
 liut then it presently occurred to me that I must 
 keep the tame from the wild, or else they would always 
 run wild when they grew up ; and the only way for 
 this was to have some enclosed piece of ground, well 
 fenced either with hedge or pale, to keep them in so 
 effectually, that those within might not oreak out, or 
 those without break in. 
 
 This was a great undertaking for one pair of hands ; 
 yet as I saw there was an absolute necessity of doing it, 
 m^ first piece of work was to find out a proper piece 
 of ground, viz., where there was likely to be herbage 
 for them to eat, ^ater for them to drink, and cover to 
 keep them from the sun. 
 
 Those who understand such enclosures will think I 
 had very little contrivance when I pitched upon a place 
 very proper for all these, being a plain open piece of 
 meadow land, or savanna (as our people call it in the 
 western colonies), whi^h had two or three little drills 
 of fresh water in it, ^nd at one end was very woody ; 
 I say, they will smile at my forecast, when I shall tell 
 them I hegAn my enclosing of this piece of ground in 
 such a manner, that my hedge or pale must have been 
 at least two miles about Nor was the madness of it so 
 great as to the compass, for if it was ten miles about, I 
 was like to have time enough to do it in. But I did 
 not consider that my goats would be as wild in so 
 much compass as if they had had the whole island, and 
 I should have so much room to chase them in, that I 
 should never catch them. 
 
 My hedge was begun and carried on, I believe, about 
 
 
 fifty yards, when this thouirht occurrpH f« «.« »^ 1

 seemed to be overwhelmed in destruction ! How can 
 He sweeten the bitterest providences^ and give us cause 
 to praise Him for dungeons and prisons ! What a 
 table was here spread for iiie in a wilderness, wliere I 
 saw nothing at first but to perish for hunger ! 
 
 It would have made a stoic smile, to nave seen me 
 and m^ little family sit down to dinner. There was 
 my majesty, the prince and lord of the whole island ; 
 I had tiie lives of all my subjects at my absolute com- 
 mand. I could hang, draw, give liberty, and take it 
 awa^ ; and no rebels among all my subjects. 
 
 Then to see how like a king I dined, too, all alone, 
 attended by my servants. Poll, as if he had been my 
 favourit*^, was the only person permitted to talk to me. 
 My dog, who was now grown very old and crazy, and 
 haia found no species to multiply his kind upon, sat 
 always at my nght hand, and two cats, one on one 
 side the table, and one on the otiier, expecting now 
 and then a bit from my hand, as a mark of special 
 favour. 
 
 But these were not the two cats which 1 brought 
 on shore at first, for they were both of them dead, and 
 had been interred near my habitation, by my own hand. 
 But one of them having multiplied by I know not what 
 kind of creature, these were two which 1 had preserved 
 tame, whereas the rest run wild in the woods, and 
 became indeed troublesome to me at last; for they 
 would often come into my house, and plunder me too, 
 till at last I was obliged to shoot them, and did kill a 
 great many ; at length they left me. With this attend- 
 ance, and in this plentiful manner, I lived ; neither 
 could I be said to want anything bi t society ; and of 
 that in some time after this, I was like to have too 
 much. 
 
 I was something impatient, as I have observed, to 
 have the use of my boat, though very loth to run any 
 fnore hazards ; and therefore sometimes I sat contriving 
 ways to get her about the island, and at other times I 
 sat myself down contented enough without her. But

 a great clumsy ugly goat-skin umbrella, but which, 
 after all, was the most necessary thing I had about me, 
 next to my gun. As for my fice, the colour of it was 
 really not so mulatto-like as one might expect from a 
 man not at all careful of it, and living within nineteen 
 degrees of the equinox. My beard Iliad once suflFered 
 to grow till it was about a quarter of a yard long ; but 
 as I had both scissors and razors sufficient, I had cut it 
 
 fretty short, exce{>t what grew on my upper lip, which 
 haid trimmed into a large pair of Mahometan 
 whiskers, such as I had seen worn by some Turks 
 whom I saw at Sallee; for the Moors did not wear 
 such, though the Turks did. Of these mustachios or 
 whiskers, I will not say thev were long enough to hang 
 my hat upon them, but they were of a length and 
 shape monstrous enough, and such as, in England, 
 would have passed for frightful. 
 
 But all this is by the bye ; for, as to my figure, I 
 had so few to observe me, Uiat it was of no manner of 
 consequence ; so I say no more to that part In this 
 kind of figure I went my new journey, and was out 
 five or six days. 1 travelled first along the sea-shore, 
 directly to the place where I first brought my boat to 
 an anchor, to get up upon the rocks. And having no 
 boat now to take care of, I went over the land, a 
 nearer way, to the same height that I was upon before ; 
 when, looking forward to the point of the rocks which 
 lay out, and which I was obliged to double with my 
 boat, as is said above, I was surprised to see the sea all 
 smooth and quiet, no rippling, no motion, no current, 
 any more there than in other places. 
 
 was 
 
 at a strange loss to understand this, and 
 resolved to spend some time in the observing it, to see 
 if nothing from the sets of the tide had occasioned it. 
 But I was presently convinced how it was, viz. , that 
 the tide of ebb setting from the west, and joining with 
 the current of waters from some great river on the 
 shore, must be the occasion of this current ; and that 
 according as the wind blew more forcibly from the 
 west, or from the north, this current came near, or 
 
 
 irant farther from the shore; for waitinir thereabout- 
 
 tide of ebb bemgr made, I pkinlv saw^the cuirent Lain 
 as before, only that it run farther off, beinTn^rTaS 
 a league from the shore ; whereas in myc^l^l

 Near this dweUin* of mine, but a littfe farther within 
 the land, and upon lower ground, lay my two pieces of 
 corn wound, which I kept duly cultivated and sowed, 
 and which duly yielded me their harvest in its season • 
 and whenever I had occasion for more com, I had more 
 land adjoining as fit as that 
 
 Besides this, I had my country seat, and I had now 
 ?. J?*™^® plantation there also ; for, first, I had my 
 little bower, as I called it, which I kept iu repair ; that 
 18 to say, I kept the hedge which circled it in con- 
 stantly fitted up to its usual height, the ladder standing 
 always in the inside. I kept the trees, which at first 
 were no more than my stakes, but were now grown 
 very firm and tall, I kept them always so cut, that 
 they might spread and grow thick and wild, and make 
 the more agreeable shade, which they did effectually to 
 my mind. In the middle of this, I had my tent always 
 standing, being a piece of a sail spread over poles, set 
 up for that purpose, and which never wanted any 
 repair or renewing ; and under this I had made me a 
 squab or couch, with the skins of the creatures I had 
 killed, and with other soft things, and a blanket laid 
 on them, such as belonged to our sea-bedding, which J 
 had saved, and a great watch-coat to cover me ; and 
 here, whenever I had occasion to be absent from my 
 chief seat, I took up my country habitation. 
 
 Adjoining to this I had my enclosures for my cattle 
 that 18 to say, my goats. And as I had taken an 
 inconceivable deal of pains to fence and enclose this 
 ground, so I was so uneasy to see it kept entire, lest 
 the goats should break through, that I never left off 
 till, with infinite labour, I had stuck the outside of 
 the hedge so full of small stakes, and so -ar to one 
 another, that it was rather a pale than & edge, and 
 there was scarce room to put a hand throu^J between 
 thi-Ji ; which afterwards, when those stakes grew, as 
 they all did m the next rainy season, made the en-

 Kay more, and to observo if it might not be my 
 fancy ; but there was no room for that, for there wm 
 exactly the very print of a foot— toes, heel, and every 
 part of a foot. How it came thither I knew not, nor 
 oould m the iMst imagine. But after innumerable 
 fluttering thoughts, like a man perfectly confused and 
 out of myself, I came home to my fortification, not 
 feeling, as we say, the ground I went on, but terrified 
 to the last degree, looking behind me at every two or 
 three steps, mistaking every bush and tree, and fancy- 
 ing every stump at a distance to be a man ; nor is 
 It possible to describe how many various shapes 
 affrighted imiwination represented things to me m, 
 how many wUd ideas were found every moment in my 
 fiincy, and what strange, unaccountoble whimsies came 
 into my thoughts by the way.

 \Vhether I went over by the ladder, as first contrived,

 door, 1 cannot remember ; no, nor could I remember 
 the next morning, for never frighted hare fled to cover, 
 or fox to earth, with more terror of mind than I to 
 this retreat. 
 
 I slept none that night The farther I was from the 
 occasion of my fright, the greater my apprehensions 
 were ; which is something contrary to the nature of 
 such things, and especially to the usual practice of all 
 creatures in fear. But I was so embarrassed with my 
 own frightful ideas of the thing, that I formed nothini 
 but dismal imaginations to myself, even thouirh I 
 was now a great way off it Sometimes I fanced it 
 must be the devil, and reason joined in with me upon 
 this supposition; for how should any other thinff in 
 human shape come into the place ? Where was the 
 vessel that brought them ? \Vhat marks was there of 
 any other footsteps ? And how was it possible a man 
 should cnme there? But then to thinl that Satau

 all this might be a mere chimera of my own ; and that 
 this foot might be the print of my own foot, when I 
 came on shore from my boat This cheered me up a 
 little too, and I began to persuade myself it was all a 
 delusion, that it was nothing else but my own foot ; 
 and why might not I come that way from the boat, as 
 well as I was going that way to the boat ? Again, 1 
 considered also, that I could by no means tell, for 
 certain, where I had trod, and where I had not ; and 
 that if, at last, this was only the print of my own foot, 
 I had played the par£ of those fools who strive to make 
 stories of spectres and apparitions, and then are 
 frighted at them more than anybody. 
 
 Now I began to take courage, and to peep abroad 
 again, for I had not stirred out of my castle for three 
 days and nights, so that I began to starve for orovision; 
 for I had little or nothing within doors but some 
 barley-cakes and water, llien I knew that my goats 
 wanted to be milked too, which usually was my even- 
 ing diversion ; and the poor creatures were in great 
 pain and inconvenience for want of it ; and, indeed, 
 it almost spoiled some of them, and almost dried up 
 their milk. 
 
 Heartening myself, therefore, with the belief that 
 this was nothing but the print of one of my own feet, 
 and so I might be truly said to start at my own 
 shadow, I be^n to go abroad again, and went to mv 
 country house to milk my flock. But to see with 
 what fear I went forward, now often I looked behind 
 me, how I was ready, every now and then, to lay 
 down my basket, and run for my life, it would have 
 made any one have thought I was haunted with an 
 evil conscience, or that I had been lately most terribly 
 frighted ; and so, indeed, I had. 
 
 However, as I went down thus two or three days, 
 and having seen nothing, I began to be a little bolder, 
 and to think there was really nothing in it but my own 
 imagination. But I could not persuade myself fully of 
 this tLU I should go down to the shore again, and see 
 this print of a foot, and measure it by my own, and see 
 
 
 if there was any simUitude or fitness, that I miirht be 
 assured It was my own foot But when I came to the 
 pliwe, first, It appeared evidently to me, that when I 
 laid up my boat, I could not possibly be on shore any- 
 where thereabout ; secondly, when f came to measure 
 the mark with my own foot, I found my foot not so 
 large by a great deal. Both these things fiUed my 
 head with new imaginations, and gave me the vapouw 
 again to the highest degree ; so that I shook with wld, 
 
 ^•5 T *^r"r!f"®' """^ ^ "«°* *»o»ne again, fiUed 
 with the behef tSat some man or men hsS b4en on 
 shore there ; or, m short, that the island was inhabited, 
 and I might be surprised before I was aware. And 
 wliat course to take for my security, 1 knew not 
 
 Uh what ridiculous resolution men take when pos- 
 sessed with fear ! It deprives them of the use of those 
 means which reason offers for their relief. The first 
 thing I proposed to myself was to throw down mv 
 enclosures, and turn aU mv tame cattle wild into the 
 woods, ttiat the enemy might not find them, and then 
 frequent the island in prospect of the same or the like 
 boory ; «ien to the simple thing of digging up my two

 which had so overrun my mind were frS. upon me, 
 and my head was full of vapours, as above. Ttms fear

 This confusion of my thoughts kept me waking all 
 night,.but m the morning I feU asleep ; and having, by 
 the amusement of my mind, been, cs it were, tired 
 and my spirite exhausted, I slept very soundly, and 
 w^ed much better composed than I had ever been 
 before. And now I began to think sedately ; and 
 upon the utmost debate with myself, 1 concluded that 
 tins island, which was so exceeding pleasant, fruitful 
 and no farther from the mainland than as 1 had seen 
 
 fW *!?k "^u*?u''*^^ abandoned as I might imagine '; 
 that although there were no stated inhabitants whcTli ved 
 
 ?° . ®«T*' y®^ *^f ' ^^®™ ™'»^* sometimes come 
 boats off from the shore, who, either with design, or 
 perhaps never but when they were driven by cross 
 winds, might come to this place ; that 1 had lived here 
 fatteeu years now, and had not met with the least 
 shadow or hgure of any people yet ; and that if at any 
 time they should be driven here, it was probable they 
 went away again as soon as ever they could, seeini 
 they had never thought fit to fix there upon any 
 occasion to this time ; that the most I could suirjrest 
 any danger from, was from any such casual accidental 
 landing of straggling people from the main, who. as it 
 was likely, if they were driven hither, were here against 
 their wiUs; so they made no stay here, but WMt off 
 again with all possible speed, seldom staying one niirht 
 on shore, lest they should not have the help of the 
 tides and daylight back again ; and that, therefore, I 
 had nothing to do but to consider of some safe retreat 
 m case I should see any savages land upon the spot.

 cave so large as to bring a door through again, 5hich

 no avenue, it was by setting two ladders, one to a park

 of the rock which was low, and then broke in, and left 
 room to place another ladder upon that; so when 
 the two ladders were taken down, no man living could 
 <5ome down to me without mischieving himself; and if 
 they had come down, they were still on the outside of 
 my outer wall. 
 
 Thug 1 took all the measures human prudence could 
 «UKgost for my own preservation ; and it will be seen, 
 at length, that they were not altogether without just 
 reason ; tho«gh 1 foresaw nothing at that time more 
 than my mere fear suggested to me. 
 
 H^^ae thk was 4oing, 1 was not altogether careless 
 «f mj edier a&irs ; for 1 hmi. a great eoncem upon me 
 for my little herd ef goats. They were not only a 
 present supply to me upon every occasion, and began 
 to be suficient to me, withmt the expense of powder 
 and shot, but also without the fatigue of hunting after 
 the wild ones ; and I was loth to lose the advantage of 
 them, and to have them all to nurse up over again. 
 
 To this purpoM, after long consideration, 1 could 
 think of but two ways to preserve them. One was, to 
 find another convenient place to dig a cave uader 
 ground, and to dri^ them into it every ^ht ; and the 
 other was, to enclose two or three littk bits of land, 
 remote from one another, and as much concealed as I 
 could, where I might keep about half a dozen young 
 goats in each place ; so that if any disaster happened 
 to the flock in general, I might be able to raise them 
 again with little trouble and time. And this, though 
 It would require a great deal of time and labour, I 
 thoufM warn the BM>st rational design. 
 
 A(x*oriingly I raent seme time to find out the most 
 retired parts of the island ; and I pitched opon one 
 which was as private indeed as my heart eeold wish 
 for. It was a little damp piece of ground, in tlu 
 middle of the hollow and thick woods, wl^re, as is 
 obsen'ed, I almost lost myself once before, endeeTouring 
 to come back that way from the eastern part of the 
 idand. Here 1 found a clear piece of land, near three

 body; and the discomposure of the mind must 
 necessarily be as great a disability as that of the body, 
 and much greater, praving to God being properly an 
 act of the mind, not of the body. 
 
 But to go on. After I had thus secured one part of 
 my little Bving stock, I went about the whole uknd, 
 searching for another private place to make such 
 another deposit; when, wandering more to the west 
 point of the island than I had ever done yet, and 
 looking out to sea, I thought I saw a boat upon the 
 sea, at a great distance. I had found a prospective 
 glass or two in one of the seamen's chests, which I 
 saved out of our ship, but I had it not about me ; and 
 this was so remote, that I could not tell what to make 
 of it, though I looked at it till my eyes were not able 
 to hold to look any longer. Whether it was a boat or 
 not, I do not know ; but as I descended from the hill, I 
 could see no more of it, so I gave it over ; only I 
 resolved to go no more out without a prospective glass 
 in my pocket 
 
 When I was come down the hill to the end of the 
 island, where, indeed, I had never been before, I was 
 presently convinced that the seeing the print of a 
 man's foot was not such a strange thing in the island as 
 I imagined. And, but that it was a special |RV)vidence 
 that 1 was cast upon the side of the island where the 
 savages never came, I should easily have known that 
 nothing was more frequent than for the canoes from 
 the main, when they happened to be a little too for out 
 at sea, to shoot over to that side of the island for 
 harbour ; likewise, as they often met and fought in 
 their canoes, the victors having taken any prisoners 
 would bring them over to this shore, where, according 
 to their dreadful customs, being all cannibals, they 
 would kill and eat them ; of which hereafter. 
 
 When I was come down the hill to the shore, as I 
 said above, being the S. W. point of the island, I was 
 perfectly confounded and amazed ; nor is it posable for 
 me to express the horror of my mind at se«ng the 
 shore spread with skulls, hands, feet, and other bones

 eeking, not wanting, or not expecting, anything here ; 
 and having often, no doubt, been up in the rovered 
 woody part of it, without finding anything to their 
 purpose. I knew I had been here now almost eighteen 
 years, and never saw the least footsteps of human 
 creature there before ; and I might be here eighteen 
 more as entirely concealed as I was now, if I did not 
 discover myself to them, which I had no manner of 
 occasion to do ; it being my only business to keep 
 myself entirely concealed where I was, unless I found 
 a better sort of creatures than cannibals to make 
 myself known to. 
 
 Yet I entertained such an abhorrence of the savaire 
 wretches that I have been speaking of, and of the 
 wretched, inhuman custom of their devouring and 
 eating one another up, that I continued pensive and 
 sad, and kept close within my own circle for almost two 
 vears after this. When I say my own circle, I mean 
 by It my three plantations, viz., my castle, my country 
 seat, which I called my bower, and my enclosure in 
 the woods. Nor did 1 look after this for any other 
 use than as an enclosure for my yoats ; for the aversion 
 which Nature gave me to these" hellish wretches was 
 such, that I was fearful of seeing them as of seeing the 
 devil himself. Nor did I so much as go to look after 
 my boat m all this time, but began rather to think of 
 making me another ; for I could not think of ever 
 making anj more attempts to bring the other boat 
 round the isiand to me, lest I should meet with some 
 of these creatures at sea, in which, if I had happened 
 to have fallen into their hands, I knew what would 
 nave been my lot. 
 
 Time, however, and the satisfaction I had that I 
 was in no danger of being discovered by these people 
 began to wear off my uneasiness about them ; and f 
 began to live just in the same composed manner as 
 before ; only with this difference, that I used more 
 caution, and kept my eyes more about me, than I did 
 before, lest I should happen to be seen by any of them- 
 and particularly, I was more cautious of firing m'^ gun

 I reproved myself often lor the aimplicity of it : for I 
 
 presently saw there would be the want of several thinn 
 
 uecessarv to the mukhig my beer, that it would be 
 
 impossible for me to sumil j . Aa, first, casks to presene 
 
 It in, which was a thinjf that, as I have observed 
 
 already, I could never compass ; no, though 1 spent 
 
 not many days, but week«, nay, months, in attempting 
 
 It, but to no purpose. In the next place, 1 had no 
 
 hops to make it keep, no yeast to make it work, no 
 
 TOpper or ketUe to make it boil ; and yet all these 
 
 things notwithstanding, I rerilv believe, liud not these 
 
 things intervened, I mean tie frights and terrors I was 
 
 in about the savages, I had undertaken it, and perhaps 
 
 brought it to pass too ; for I seldom gave anything 
 
 over without accomplishing it when I once had it in 
 
 my head enough to begin it 
 
 But my invention now ran quite another way ; for 
 night and day, I could think of nothing but how 1 
 might destroy some of these monsters in their cniel, 
 bloody entertainment, and, if possible, save the victim 
 they should bring hither to destroy. It would toke 
 up a larger volumt than this whole work is intended 
 to be, to set down all the contrivances I hatched, or 
 rather brooded upon, in my thought, for the destroying 
 these creatures, or at least frighting them so as to 
 prevent their coming hither any more. But all was 
 abortive; nothing could be possible to take effect, 
 unless I was to be there to do it myself. And what 
 could one man do among them, when perhaps there 
 might be twenty or thirty of them together, with 
 their darts, or their bows and arrows, with which 
 they could shoot as true to a mark as I could with 
 my gun? 
 
 Sometimes I contrived to dig a hole under the place 
 whore they made their fire, and put in five or six 
 pound of gunpowder, which, when thay kindled their 
 fire, would consequently take fire, aud blow up all that 
 was near it But as, in the first place, I should be

 accordingly, I prepared two muskets and my ordinary 
 fowling-piece. The two muskets I loaded with a brace 
 of slugs each, and four or five smaller bullets, about 
 the size of pistol- bullets ; and the fowling-piece 1 
 loaded with near a handful of swan-shot, of the 
 largest size. I also loaded my pistols with about four 
 bullets each ; and in this posture, well provided with 
 ammunition for a second and third charge, I prepared 
 myself for my expedition. 
 
 After I had thus laid the scheme of my design, and 
 in my imagination put it in practice, I continually 
 made my tour every morning up to the top of the hill, 
 which was from my castle, as I called it, about three 
 miles, or more, to see if I could observe any boats 
 upon the sea coming near the island, or standing over 
 towards it. But I began to tire of this hard duty, after 
 I had, for two or three months, constantly kept my 
 watch, but came always back without any discovery ; 
 ther<» having not, in all that time, been the least ap- 
 pearance, not only on or near the shore, but not on the 
 whole ocean, so far as my eyes or glasses could reach 
 every way. 
 
 As long as I kept up my daily tour to the hill to 
 look out, so long also I kept up the vigour of my 
 design, and my spirits seemed to be all the while in a 
 suitable form for so outrageous an execution as the 
 killing twenty or thirty naked savages for an offence 
 which I had not at all entered into a discussion of in 
 my thoughts, any farther than my passions were at 
 first fired by the horror I conceived at the unnatural 
 custom of that people of the country ; who, it seems, 
 had been suffered by Providence, in His wise disposition 
 of the world, to have no other guide than that of their 
 own abominable and vitiated passions; and conse- 
 quently were left, and perhaps had been so for some 
 ages, to act such horrid things, and receive such dread- 
 ful customs, as nothing but nature entirely abandoned 
 of Heaven, and acted by some hellish degeneracy, 
 could have run them into. But now when, as I have 
 said, I began to be weary of the fruitless excursion 
 
 
 which I had made so long and so far every mominir in 
 vam, so my opinion of the action itself began to alter • 
 and I began, with cooler and calmer thoughts, to 
 consider what it was I was going to engage in. What 
 authority or call I had topetend tTS judge an] 
 hX^ii^T^/w ^^'^^ ™*° *« criminals, whom fleaven

 an offence, and then commit it in defiance of Divine 
 
 niey think it no more a crime to kiU a captive taken 
 
 flesh, than we do to eat mutton. 
 
 When I had considered this a little, it followed 
 necessarily that I was certainly in the wrong in it tTat 
 these people were not murderers in the sense that I

 fall upon them, lliat this would justify the conduct 
 of the Spaniards in all their barbarities practised in 
 America, and where they destroyed millions of these 
 people; who, however they were idolaters and bar- 
 barians, and had several bloody and barbarous rites in 
 their customs, such as sacrificing human bodies to 
 their idols, were yet, as to the Spaniards, very innocent 
 people ; and that the rooting them out of the country 
 is spoken of with thr itmost abliorrence and detestation 
 by even the Spaniards themselves at this time, and 
 by all other Christian nations of Europe, as a mere 
 butchery, a bloody and unnatural piece of cruelty, 
 unjustifiable either to God or man ; and such, as for 
 which the very name of a Spaniard is reckoned to be 
 frightful and terrible to all people of humanity, or of 
 Christian compassion ; as if tiie kingdom of Spain were 
 particularly eminent for the product of a race of wen 
 who were without principles of tenderness, or lie 
 common boyrels of pity to the miserable, which is 
 reckoned to be a mark of generous temper in the 
 mind. 
 
 ITiese considerations really put me to a pause, and 
 to a kind of a full stop ; and I began, by little and 
 little, to be off of my design, and to conclude I had 
 taken wrong measures in my resolutions to attack 
 the savages ; that it was not my business to meddle 
 with them, unless they first attacked me ; and this 
 it was my business, if possibL, to prevent ; but that if 
 1 were discovered and attacked, then I knew my duty. 
 
 On the other hand, I argued with myself that this 
 really was the way not to deliver myself, but entirely 
 to ruin and destroy myself; for unless I was sure to 
 kill every one that not only should be on shore at 
 that time, but that should ever come on shore after- 
 wards, if but one of them escaped to tell their country 
 people what had happenec^ they would come over 
 again by thousands to revenge the death of their 
 fellows, and I should only bring upon myself a certain 
 destruction, which, at present, I had no manner of 
 occasion for.

 removed my boat, which I had on the other side the 
 island, and carried it down to the east end of the 
 whole island, where I ran it into a little cove, which I 
 found undc ' some high rocks, and where I knew, by 
 reason of the currents, the savages durst not, at least 
 would not come, with their boats, upon any account 
 whatsoever. 
 
 With my boat I carried away everything that I had 
 left there belonging to her, though not necessary for 
 the bare going thither, viz. , a mast and sail which I 
 had made for her, and a thing like an anchor, but 
 indeed which could not be called either anchor or 
 grappling ; however, it was the best I could make of 
 its kind. All these I removed, that there might not 
 be the least shadow of any discovery, or any appear- 
 ance of any boat, or of any human habitation, upon 
 the island. 
 
 Besides this, I kept myself, as I said, more retired 
 than ever, and seldom went from my cell, other than 
 upon my constant employment, viz., to milk my she- 
 goats, and manage my little flock in the wood, which, 
 .3 it was quite on the other part of the island, was 
 quite out of danger ; for certain it is, that these savage 
 people, who sometimes haunted this island, never came 
 with any thoughts of finding anything here, and con- 
 sequently never wandered off from the coast ; and 1 
 doubt not but they might have been several times on 
 shore after my apprehensions of them had made me 
 cautious, as well as before , and indeed, I looked back 
 with some horror upon the thoughts of what my con- 
 dition would have been if I had chopped upon them 
 and been discovered before that, when, naked and 
 unarmed, except with one gun, and that loaded often 
 only with small shot, I walked everywhere, peeping 
 and peeping about the island to see what I could get 
 What a surprise should I have been in if, when 1 dis- 
 covered the print of a man's foot, I had, instead of 
 that, seen fifteen or twenty savages, and found them 
 pursuing me, and by the swiftness of their running, no 
 tpossibility of my escaping ^hem !

 give many examples of the success of this conduct in 
 the course of my life, but more especially in the latter 
 part of my inhabiting this unhappy island ; besides 
 many occasions which it is very likely I might have 
 taken notice of, if I had seen with the same eyes then 
 that I saw with now. But 'tis never too late to be wise ; 
 and I cannot but advise all considering men, whose 
 lives are attended with such extraordinary incidents 
 as mine, or even though not so extraordinary, not to 
 slight such secret intimations of Providence, let them 
 come from what invisible intelligence they will. That 
 I shall not discuss, and perhaps cannot account for ; 
 but certainly they are a proof of the converse of spirits, 
 and the secret communication between those embodied 
 and those unembodied, and such a proof as can never 
 be withstood, of which I shall have occasion to give 
 some very remarkable instances in the remainder of my 
 solitary residence in this dismal place. 
 
 I believe the reader of this will not think strange 
 if I confess that these anxieties, these constant dangers 
 I liveu in, and the concern that was now upon me, put 
 an end to all invention, and to all the contrivances hat 
 I had laid for mv future accommodations and co " 
 ences. I had the care of my safety more no'* 
 my hands than that of my food. I cared not t 
 a nail, or chop a stick of wood now, for fear tb*. 
 I should make should be heard ; much less would 1 hre 
 a gun, for the same reason ; and, above all, I was 
 intolerably uneasy at making any fire, lest the smoke, 
 which is visible at a great distance in the day, should 
 betray me ; and for this reason I removed that part of 
 my business which required fire, such as burning of 
 pots and pipes, etc., into my new apartment in the 
 woods ; where, after I had been some time, I found, to 
 my unspeakable consolation, a mere natural cave in 
 the earth, which went in a vast way, and where, I dare 
 say, no savage, had he been at the mouth of it, would 
 be so .^ardy as to venture in ; nor, indeed, would any

 foUowed by a broken noise, a» if of words half ex- 
 pired? a/d then a deep sigh again. I.stepped hack 
 Jnd wa^ indeed struck with such a surprise, that it put 
 me into a cold sweat ; and if 1 had had a hat on my 
 h«id, I will not answer for it, that my hair might not

 considering that the power and presence of God was 
 eveJprhere, and was able to protect me upon this I 
 stepped forward again, and by the light o? the fire- 
 bS, hol'ing it u? a little over my head, I eaw lying 
 on the ground a most monstrous, frightful, old he- 
 goat, just making his will, as we say, and gasping for 
 life ; and dying, indeed, of mere old age. 
 
 I 'stirred Lm^ a little to see if I could eet him out, 
 and he essayed to get up, but was not al>le to raise 
 himself; and I thought with myself he might even lie 
 thTrV; for if he had frighted me so, he would certeinh^ 
 fright any of the savages, if any of them should be 
 goliardy as to come in there while he had any life in 
 
 him 
 
 I 'was now recovered from my surprise, and began 
 
 to look round me, when I found the cave was but 
 
 very small ; that is to say, it might be about twelve 
 
 feet over, but in no manner of shape, either round or 
 
 square, no hands having ever been employed »n making 
 
 it but those of mere Nature. I observed also that 
 
 there was a place at the farther side of it that went m 
 
 ferther, but was so low, that it required me to creep 
 
 upon my hands and knees to go into it, and whither 
 
 I went 1 knew not ; .so having no candle, I gave it over 
 
 for some time, but resolved to come again the next 
 
 day, provided with candles and a tinder-box, which I 
 
 had made of the lock of one of the muskets, with some 
 
 wild-fire in the pan. , . 
 
 Accordingly, the next day I came nrovided with six 
 large candid of my own making, for 1 made very good 
 candles now of goafs tallow ; and going into this low 
 place, I was obliged to creep upon all fours, as I have 
 SSd, almost ten yards ; whfch, by the way, 1 thought

 of a surprise of any kind. I also carried thither all the 
 lead I had left for bullets. 
 
 1 &ncied myself now like one of the ancient giants, 
 which were said to live in caves and holes in the 
 rocks, where none could come at them ; for I persuaded 
 myseU', while I was hero, if five hundred savages were 
 to hunt me, they could never find me out ; or, If they 
 did, they would not venture to attack me here. 
 
 The old goat, whom I found expiring, died in the 
 mouth of the cave the next day after I made this 
 discovery ; and I found it much easier to dig a great 
 hole there, and throw him in and cover nim with 
 earth, than to drag him out ; so I interred him there, 
 to prevent the onence to my nose. 
 
 I was now in my twenty- third year of residence in 
 this island ; and was so naturalised to the place, and 
 to the manner of living, that could I have but enjoyed 
 the certainty that no savages would -ome to the place 
 to disturb me, I could have been content to nave 
 capitulated for spending the rest of my time there, even 
 to the last moment, till I had laid me down and died, 
 like the old goat in the cave. I had also arrived to lome 
 little diversions and amusements, which made the time 
 pass more pleasantly with me a great deal than it did 
 be^re. As, first, I had taught my Poll, as I noted 
 before, to speak ; and he did it so familiarly, and 
 talked so articulately and plain, that it was very 
 pleasant to me ; and he lived with me no less than six 
 twenty years. How long he might live afterwards 
 1 know not, though I know they have a notion in the 
 Brazils that they live a hundred years. Perhaps poor 
 I'oU may be alive there still, calling after poor Robin 
 Crusoe to this day. I wish no Englishman the ill 
 luck to come there and hear him ; but if he did, he 
 would certainly believe it was th>? devil. My dog was 
 a very pleasant and loving companion to me for no less 
 than sixteen years of my time, and then died of mere 
 old age. As for my cats, thev multiplied, as I have 
 observed, to that degree, tha'c I was obliged to shoot

 fallen into it, is the most dreadful to us, is oftentimes the 
 very „,eans or door of our deliverance, by which^ alone 
 intn*°T^ raised again from the affliction we a,e fallen 
 into. I could give many examples of this in the course 
 of my unaccountable life ; but in nothing was it more 
 particularly remarkable, than in the circumstances of 
 my last years of solitary residence in this island 
 
 it was now the month of December, as I said'above 
 in my twenty-third year ; and ' lis, being the MutheiS 
 
 tit^n? (^°V'°*«' ^«^°"ot <«il it), was'^the iTrticul" 
 time of my han.e8t,and required my being prltty much 
 abroad in the fields ; when, going Lt pretty eLhr In 
 the morning, even before it was thorough daylight, I 
 
 
 
 P- 
 
 
 was surprised with seeing a light of some fire upon the 
 shore, at a distance from me of about two miles, 
 towards the end of the island, where I had observed 
 some savages had been, as before. But not on the 
 other side ; but, to my great affliction, it was on my 
 side of the island. 
 
 I was indeed terribly surprised at the sight, and 
 stepped short within my grove, not daring to go out, 
 lest 1 might be surprised ; and yet I had no more 
 peace within, from the apprehensions I had that if 
 these savages, in rambling over the island, should find 
 my corn standing or cut, or any of my works and 
 improvements, they would immediatoly conclude that 
 tiere were people in the place, and would then never 
 give over till they had found me out. In this extremity 
 I went back directly to my castle, pulled up the ladder 
 after me, and made all things without look as wild 
 and natural as I could. 
 
 Then I prepared myself within, putting myself in a 
 posture of defence. I loaded all my cannon, as I 
 called them, that is to say, my muskets, which were 
 mounted upon my new fortificatiou, and all my pistols, 
 and resolved to defend myself to the last (^P > not 
 forgetting seriously to commend myself to the Divine 
 protection, and earnestly to pray to God to deliver me 
 out of the hands of the barbarians. And in this 
 posture J continued about two hours ; but began to 
 be mighty impatient for intelligence abroad, for I 
 had no spies to send out. 
 
 After sitting a while longer, and musing what I 
 should do in this case, I was not able to bear sitting in 
 ignorance any longer ; so setting up my ladder to the 
 side of the hill where there was a flat place, as I 
 observed before, and then pulling the ladder up after 
 me, I set it up again, and mounted to the top of 
 the hill ; and pulling out my perspective-glass, which 
 I had taken on purpose, I laid me down flat on my 
 belly on the ground, and began to look for the 
 place. I presently found there was no less than nine 
 naked savages sitting round a small fire they had 
 
 
 made, not to warm them, for they had no need of 
 that, the weather being extreme hot, but, as I sup- 
 posed, to dress some of their barbarous diet of human 
 flesh which they had brought with them, whether 
 ahve or dead, I could not know. 
 
 TTiey had two canoes with them, which they had 
 hauled up upon the shore ; and as it was then tide 
 of ebb, they seemed to me to wait for the return of 
 the flood to go away again. It is not easy to imagine 
 what confusion this sight put me into, especially 
 seeing them come on my side the island, and so 
 near me too. But when I observed their coming 
 must be always with the current of the ebb, I began 
 afterwards to be more sedate in my mind, being 
 satisfied that I might go abroad with safety all the 
 time of the tide of flood, if they were not on shore 
 before; and having made this observation, I went 
 abroad about my harvest- work with the more com- 
 posure. 
 
 As I expected, so it proved ; for as soon as the tide 
 made to the westward, 1 saw them all take boat, and row 
 (or paddle, as we call it) all away. I should have 
 observed, that for an hour and more before they went 
 off, they went to dancing ; and I could easily discern 
 their postures and gestures by my glasses. I could 
 not perceive, by my nicest observation, but that they 
 were stark naked, and had not the least covering upon 
 them ; but whether they were men or women, that I 
 could not distinguish. 
 
 As soon as I saw them shipped and gone, I took two 
 guns upon my shoulders, and two pistols at my girdle, 
 and my great sword by my side, without a scabbard, 
 and with all the speed I was able to make I went away 
 to the hill where I had discovered the first appearance 
 Of all. And as soon as I gat thither, which was not 
 less than two hours (for I could not go apace, being so 
 loden with arms as I was), I perceived there had been 
 three canoes more of savages on that place ; and looking 
 out iarther, I saw they were all at sea together, making 
 over for the main. *

 I b- 
 
 This was a dreadful sight to me, especially when, 
 
 going down to the shore, I could see the marks of 
 orror which the dismal work they had been about had 
 left behind it, viz. , the blood, the bones, and part of 
 the flesh of human bodies, eaten and devoured by those 
 wretches with merriment and sport. I was so filled 
 witii indignation at the sight, that I began now to pre- 
 meditate the destruction of the next that I saw there, 
 let them be who or how many soever. 
 
 It seemed evident to me that the visits which they 
 thus made to this island are not very frequent, for it 
 was above fifteen months before any more of them 
 came on shore there again ; that is to say, I neither 
 saw them, or any footsteps or signals of them, in all 
 that time ; for, as to the rainy seasons, then they are 
 sure not to come abroad, at least not so far. Yet all 
 this while I lived uncomfortably, by reason of the 
 constant apprehensions I was in of their coming upon 
 me by surprise; from whence I observe, that the 
 expectation of evil is more bitter than the suffering, 
 especially if there is no room to shake off that ex- 
 pectation, or those apprehensions. 
 
 During all this time I was in a murdering humour, 
 and took up most of my hours, which should have been 
 better employed, in contriving how to circumvent and 
 fidl upon them the very next time I should see them ; 
 especially if they should be divided, as they were the 
 last time, into two parties. Nor did I consider at all 
 that if I killed one party, suppose ten or a dozen, I 
 was still the next day, or week, or month, to kill 
 another, and so another, even ad infinitum, till I should 
 be at length no less a murderer than they were in being 
 man-eaters, and perhaps much more so. 
 
 I spent my days now in great perplexity and anxiety 
 of mind, expecting that I should, one day or other, faU 
 into the hands of these merciless creatures ; and if I 
 did at any time venture abroad, it was not without 
 looking round me with the greatest care and caution 
 imaginable. And now I found, to my great comfort, 
 how happy it was that I provided for a tame flock or

 mounting it the second time, got to the top of the 
 hill the very moment that a flash of fire bid me listen 
 for a second gun, which accordingly, in about half 
 a minute, 1 heard ; and, by the sound, knew that it 
 was from that part of the sea where I was driven down 
 the current in my boat 
 
 I immediately considered that this must be some ship 
 in distress, and that they had some comrade, or some 
 other sliip in company, and fired these guns for signals 
 of distress, and to obtain help. I had this presence of 
 mind, at that minute, as to think that though I could 
 not help them, it may be they might help me ; so I 
 brought together all the dry wood I could get at hand, 
 and, making a good handsome pile, I set it on fire 
 upon the hill. The wood was dry, and blazed freely ; 
 and though the wind blew very hard, yet it burnt 
 fairly out ; so that I was certain, if there was any 
 such thing as a ship, they must needs see it, and no 
 doubt they did ; for as soon as ever my fire blazed 
 up I heard another gun, and after that several others, 
 afi from the same quarter. I plied my fire all night 
 long till day broke ; and when it was broad day, and 
 the air cleared up, I saw something at a great distance 
 at sea, full east of the island, whether a sail or a hull I 
 could not distinguish," no, not with my glasses, the 
 distance was so great, and the weather still something 
 hazy also ; at least it was so out at sea. 
 
 I looked frequently at it all that day, and soon per- 
 ceived that it did not move ; so I presently concluded 
 that it was a ship at an anchor. And being eager, you 
 may be sure, to oe satisfied, I took my gun in my hand 
 and ran toward the south side of the island, to the 
 rocks where I had formerly been carried away with the 
 current ; and getting up there, the weather by this 
 time being perfectly clear, I could plainly see, to my 
 great sorrow, the wreck of a ship, cast away in t? " 
 night upon those concealed rocks which I found when 
 I was out in my boat ; and which rocks, as they 
 checked the violence of the stream, and made a kind 
 of counter-stream or eddy, were the occasion of my 
 
 
 recovering from the most desperate, hopeless condition 
 that ever I had been in in all my life. 
 
 Thus, what is one man's safety is another man's 
 destruction ; for it seems these men, whoever thev 
 were, being out of their knowledge, and the rocks beinJ 
 wholly under water, had been driven upon them in the 
 nig-ht, the wind blowing hard at E. and E.N E Had 
 the^ seen the island, as I m t necessarily suppose they 
 did not, they must, as 1 thought, have endeavoured to 
 have saved themselves on shore by the help of their 
 boat ; but tueir firing of guns for help, especially when 
 they saw, as I imagined, my fire, filled me with many 
 thoughts First, I imagined that upon seeing my light, 
 they might have put themselves into their boat, and 
 have endeavoured to make the shore ; but that the sea 
 going very high, they might have been cast away. 
 Other times I imagined that they might have lost their 
 boat before, as might be the case many ways ; as. 
 particularly, by the breaking of the sea upon their ship! 
 which many times obliges men to stave, or take m 
 pieces their boat, and sometimes to throw it overboard 
 with their own hands. Other times I imagined t'aey 
 had some other ship or ships in company, who, ULon 
 the signals of distress they tad made, had taken them 
 up and carried them off. Other whiles I fancied they 
 were all gone off to sea in their boat, and being hurried 
 away by the current that 1 had been formeriy in, were 
 carried out into the great ocean, where th-re war 
 nothing but misery and perishing- and that perhaps, 
 they might by this time think of st<irving, an- 1 of beinff 
 in a condition to eat one another. 
 
 As all these were but conjectures at best, so, in the 
 condition I was in, I could do no more than look on 
 
 "^'^'Vr^'^lffT ^^ *''® P^'O'' »"e°^ and pity them; 
 which had still this good effect on my side, that it gave 
 me more and more cause to give thanks to God, who 
 had so happily and comfortably provided for me in my 
 desolate condition ; and that of two ships' companii 
 who were now cast away upon this f t of the ^rid, 
 not one life should be spared but mine. I learned here

 188 ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 
 
 affain to observe^ that it is very rare that the providence 
 of God casts us into any condition of life so low, or 
 any misery so gr«at, but we may see something or other 
 to be thankful for, and may see others in wcrde circum- 
 stsnees than our own. 
 
 Such certainly was the case of these men, of whom 
 I could not so much as see room to suppose any of 
 them were saved. Nothing could make ft rational so 
 much as to wish or expect thpt they did not all perish 
 there, except the possibility only of their being taken 
 up by another ship in company; and this was but 
 mere possibility indeed, for 1 hslw not the least signal 
 or appearance of any such thing. 
 
 I cannot explain, by any possible energy of words, 
 what a strange longing or hankering of desires 1 felt 
 in my soul upon this sight, breaking out sometimes 
 thus : * Oh that there had been but one or two, nay, 
 or but one soul, saved out of this ship, to have escaped 
 to me, that I might but have had one companion, one 
 fellow-creature, to have spoken to me, and to hpve 
 conversed with ! ' In all the time of my solitary life, 
 I never felt so earnest, so strong a desire after the 
 society of my fellow-creatures, or so deep a regi-et at 
 the want of it 
 
 There are some secret moving springs in the affec- 
 tions which, when they are set agoing by some object 
 in view, or be it some object, though not in view, 
 yet rendered present to the mind by the power of 
 imagination, that motion carries out the soul by its 
 impetuosity to such violent, eager embracings of th ) 
 objfcct, that the absence of it is insupportable. 
 
 Such were these earnest wishings that but one man 
 had been saved ! 'Oh that it had been but one !' 
 I believe I repeated the words, ' Oh that it had been 
 one ! ' a thousand times ; and the desires were so 
 moved by it, that when I spoke the words my hands 
 would clinch together, and my fingers press the palms 
 of my hands, that if I had had any soft thing in my 
 hand, it would have crushed it involuntarily ; and my 
 teeth in my head would strike together, and set against

 to mj castle, prepared everything for my voyage, took 
 a quantity of bread, a great pot for fresh water, a 
 compass to steer by, a bottle of rum (for I had still 
 a great deal of that left), a basket full of raisins. 
 And thus, loading mvself with everything necessary, 
 I went down to my boat, got the water out of her, 
 and got her afloat, loaded all my cargo in her, and then 
 went home again for more. My second cargo was 
 a great bag full of rice, tlie umbrella to set up over 
 my head for shade, another large pot full of fresh 
 water, and about two dozen of my small loaves, or 
 barley-cakes, more than before, with a uottle of goat's 
 milk and a cheese ; all which, with great labour and 
 sweat, I brought to my boat And praying to Grod 
 to direct my voyage, I put out; and rowing, or 
 paddling, the canoe sdong the shore, I came at last 
 to the utmost point of the island on that side, viz., 
 N.E. And now I was to launch ou*. into the ocean, 
 and either to venture or not to venture. I looked on 
 the rapid currents which ran constantly on both sides 
 of the island at a distance, and which were very 
 terrible to me, from the remembrance of the hazard 
 I had been in before, and my heart began to &il 
 me ; for I foresaw that if I was driven into either 
 of those currents, I should be carried a vast way out 
 to sea, and perhaps out of my reach, or sight of the 
 island again ; and that then, as my boat was but small, 
 if any little gale of wind should rise, I should be 
 inevitably lost. 
 
 These thoughts so oppressed my mind, that I began 
 to give over my enterprise ; and having hauled my boat 
 into a little creek on the shore, I stepped out, and sate 
 me down upon a little rising bit of ground, very pensive 
 and anxious, between fear and desire, about my voyage ; 
 when, as I was musing, I could perceive that the tide 
 was turned, and the flood come on ; upon which my 
 going was for so many hours impracticable. Upon 
 this, presently it occurred to me that I should go up 
 to the highest piece of ground I could find and observe, 
 if I could, how the sets of the tide, or currents, lay 
 
 
 T^^L^A ^****^ "*"* '""' **»*' ' "^*»' i*"*?* whether. 
 If I was dmen one way out, I mi^ht not Scpect to b^ 
 driven another way home, with the ume rrEdnew of 
 the currents. This thought was no sooner in my head 
 
 ^^lij^A^^I *^* T°." *'*^« ^'"' ^»»»«^ sufficiently 
 overlooked the sea hoth ways, and from whence 1 had 
 a clear view of the currents, or sets of the tide, and 
 
 rS; /Ml'^*'.? «^'*''* ""'y^^^ '° "^y return. Here 
 I found, that as the current of the ebb set out close by 
 the south point of the island, so the current of the flood 
 set m close by the shore of the north side ; and that I 
 had nothing to do but to keep to the north of the 
 island in my return, and I should do well enough 
 
 Encouraged with this observation, I resolVed the 
 next morning to set out with the first of the tide, and 
 reposing myself for the night in the canoe, under the 
 ^eat watch-coat I mentioned, I launched ou*. I made 
 
 thf f.nl2f TM? '^' ^"" °?^*'> *i» I began to feel 
 the benefit of the current which set eas^ard, and 
 which carried me at a great rate ; and yet did not so 
 hurry me as the southern side current had done before, 
 and so as to take from me all government of the boat 
 but haviug a strong steerage with my paddle, 1 went at 
 a great rate directly for the wreck, an/in les^ than two 
 hours I came up to it 
 
 It was a dismal sight to look at The ship, which, 
 hlfl' building was Spanish, stuck fest, jammed in 
 between two rocks. All the stern and quarter of her 
 was beaten to pieces with the sea ; and as her fore- 
 castle, which stuck in the rocks, had run on with great 
 yiolen'^e, her mainmast and foremast were brought by 
 ^e board ; that is to say, broken short off; but her 
 
 S^P"^" T""^' r*^ *be head and bow appeared 
 firm. When I came close to her a dog appearelupon 
 her who, seeing me coming, yelped and cried ; ind 
 as soon Ml c^ed him, jumned into the sea to cometo 
 d^^f i^^ h™ into the W, but found him almort 
 dead for hunger and thirst I gave him a cake of my 
 bread, and he eat it like a ravenous wolf that hid b^n 
 starving a fortnight in the snow. I then gaveTe p^r

 creature some fresh water, with which, if I would have 
 let him, he would have burst himself. 
 
 After this I went on board ; but the first sight I 
 met with was two men drowned in the coolc-room, or 
 forecastle of the ship, with their arms fas* about one 
 another. I concluded, as is indeed probable, that when 
 ue ship struck, it being in a storm, the sea broke so 
 high, and so continually over her. that the men were 
 not able to bear it, and were strangled with the constant 
 rushing in of the water, as much as if they had been 
 under water. Besides the dog, there was nothing left 
 in the ship that had life ; nor any goods that I could 
 see, but what were spoiled by the water. There were 
 some casks of liquor, whether wine or brandy I knew 
 not, which lay lower in the hold, and which, the water 
 being ebbed out, I could see ; but they were too big to 
 meddle with. I saw several chests, which I believed 
 belonged to some of the seamen ; and I got two of 
 them into the boat, without Examining what was in 
 them. 
 
 Had the stem of the ship been lixed, and the fore- 
 part broken off, I am persuaded I might have made a 
 good voyage; for by what I found in these two 
 chests, I had room to suppose the ship had a great 
 deal of wealth on board ; and if I may guess by the 
 course she steered, she must have been bound from the 
 Buenos Ayres, or the Rio de la Plata, in the south 
 part of America, beyond the Brazils, to the Havrua, 
 in the Gulf of Mexico, and so perhaps to Spain. 
 Sho had, no doubt, a great treasure in her, but of 
 no use, at that time, to anybody ; and what became 
 of the rest of her people, I then knew not. 
 
 I found, besides these chests, a little cask full of 
 liquor, of about twenty gallons, which I got into 
 my boat with much difficulty. There were several 
 muskets in a cabin, and a great powder-horn, with about 
 four pounds of powder in it As for the muskets, I 
 had no occasion for them, so I left them, but took the 
 powder-horn. 1 took a fire-shovel and tongs, which 
 I wanted extremely ; as also two little brass kettles.

 fe«t ; and I would have given it all for three or four 
 pair of English ihoet and stockingi, which were 
 thing! I greatly wanted, but had not nad on my feet 
 now for many years. I had indeed gotten two pair of 
 ihoei now, which I toolc off of the feet of the two 
 drowned men whom I mw in the wreclc, and I found 
 two pair more in one of the cheats, which were verv 
 welcome to me ; but they were not lilce our Englisn 
 shoes, either for ease or service, being rather what we 
 call pumps than shoes. I found in this seaman's chest 
 about fiftv pieces of eight in royals, but no gold. I 
 suppose t^is belonged to a poorer man than the other, 
 which seemed to lielong to soma officer. 
 
 Well, however, I lugged this mone> aome to my 
 cave, and laid it up, as I nad done that before which I 
 brought from our own ship ; but it was great pity, as 
 I said, that the other part of this ship had not come to 
 my share, for I am satisfied I might have loaded my 
 canoe several times over with money, w* 'ch, if I had 
 ever escaped to England, would have .  n here safe 
 enough till I might nave come again and fetched it. 
 
 Having now brought all my things on shore, and 
 secured them, I went bacic to my boat, and rowed or 
 
 riddled her along the shore to her old harbour, where 
 laid her up, and made the best of my way to my old 
 habitation, where I found everything safe and quiet 
 So I began to repose myself, live after my old fiswnion, 
 and take care of my family affairs ; and, for a while, I 
 lived easy enough, only that I was mora vigilant than 
 I used to be, looked out oftener, and did not go abroad 
 so much ; and if at any time I did stir with any freedom, 
 it was always to the east part of the island, where I was 
 
 Fretty well satisfied the savages never came, and where 
 could go without so many precautions, and such a 
 load of arms and ammunition as I always carried with 
 me if I went the other way. 
 
 I lived in this condition near two years more ; but 
 my unlucky head, that was always to let me know it 
 was bom to make my body miserable, was all this two 
 years filled with projects and designs, how, if it were

 time ; and so it was with me now. And yet, so deep 
 had tie mistake taken root in my temper, that I could 
 not satisfy myself in my station, but was contirually 
 poring upon the means and possibility of my escape 
 from this place. And that 1 may, with the greater 
 pleasure to the reader, bring on the remaining part of 
 my story, it may not be improper to give some account 
 of my first conceptions on the subject of this foolish 
 scheme for my escape, and how, and upon what founda- 
 tion, I acted. 
 
 I am now to be supposed retired into my castle, 
 after my late voyage to the wreck, my frigate laid up 
 and secured under water, as usual, and my condition 
 restored to what it was before. 1 had more wealth, 
 indeed, than I had before, but was not at all the richer ; 
 for I had no more use for it than the Indians of Peru 
 had before the Spaniards came there. 
 
 It was one of the nights in the rainy season in 
 March, the four and twentieth year of my first setting 
 foot in this island of solitariness. I was lying in my 
 bed, or hammock, awake, very well in health, had no 
 pain, no distemper, no uneasiness of body, no, nor 
 any uneasiness of mind, more than ordinary, but could 
 by no means close my eyes, that is, so as to sleep; 
 no, not a wink all night long, otherwise than as 
 follows. 
 
 It is as impossible, as needless, to set down the in- 
 numerable crowd of thoughts that whirled through that 
 great thoroughfare of the brain, the memory, in this 
 night's time. I ran over the whole history of my life 
 in miniature, or by abridgment, as 1 may call it, to my 
 coming to this island, and also of the part of my life 
 since I came to this island. In my reflections upon 
 the state of my case since I came on shore on this 
 island, I was comparing the happy posture of my 
 affairs in the first years of my habitation here com- 
 pared to tie life of anxiety, fear, and care which I 
 had lived ever since I had seen the print of a foot in 
 the sand ; not that I did not believe the savages had 
 frequented the island even all the while, and might 
 
 
 .|..! 
 
 
 have been several hundreds of them at times on shore 
 there ; but I had never known it, and was incapable of 
 any apprehensions about it My satisfaction was perfect, 
 though my danger was the same ; and I was as happy 
 m not knowing my danger, as if I had never really bSen 
 exposed to It This furnished my thoughts with many 
 very profitable reflections, and particularly this one : 
 how infinitely good that Providence is which has pro- 
 vided, m Its government of mankind, such narrow 
 bounds to his sight and knowledge of things; and 
 though he walks in the midst of so many thousand 
 ln?f7J- *^%«'?^* of which, if discovered to him, 
 would distract his mind and sink his spirits, he is kept 
 serene and calm, by having the events of things hid 
 from his eyes, and knowing nothing of the dangers 
 which surround him. ** 
 
 After these thoughts had for some time entertained 
 me, I came to reflect seriously upon the real danger I 
 had been m for so many years in this very island, and 
 how I had wa ked about in the greatest security, and 
 with all possible tranquillity, even when perhaps nothinir 
 but a brow of a hill, a great tree, or tHie casual 
 approach of night had been between me and tlie worst 
 kind of destruction, viz., that of falling into the hands 
 of cannibals and savages, who would have seized on 
 me with the same view as I did of a goat or a turtle, 
 and have thought it no more a crime to kiU and 
 
 iTu '"^ .^^'^^ ' f '^ °^ * P'*f«'>'^ o'- a curlew. I 
 would unjustly slander myself if I should sav I was 
 not sincerely thankful to my great Preserver, to whose 
 singular protection I acknowledged, with great humility, 
 that all these unknown deliverances were due, and 
 without which I must inevitably have faUen into their 
 merciless hands. 
 
 When these thoughts were over, my head was for 
 some time taken up m considering the nature of these 
 wretched creatures, I mean the savages, and how it 
 came to pass in the world that th? wise Governor 
 
 «,nJ • r°^ *.?"*"*** ^""^ "P '^y o^ His creatures to 
 such inhumanity; nay, to something so much below 
 
 ' Bfj i 
 
 
 even brutality itself, as to devour its own kind. But 
 as this ended in some (at that time fruitless) specula- 
 tions, it occurred to me to inquire what part of the 
 world these wretches lived in? how far off the coast 
 was from whence they came ? what they ventured over 
 80 far from home for? what kind of boats they had? 
 and why I might not order myself and my business so, 
 that 1 might be as able to go over thither, as they were 
 to come to me. 
 
 I never so much as troubled myself to consider what 
 I should do with myself when I came thither ; what 
 would become of me, if I fell into the hands of the 
 savages ; or how I should escape from them, if they 
 attempted me ; no, nor so much as how it was possible 
 for me to reach the coast, and not be attempted by some 
 or other of them, without anv possibility of delivering 
 myself; and if I should not fell into their hands, what 
 I should do for provision, or whither I should bend 
 my course. None of these thoughts, I sav, so much as 
 came in my way ; but my mind was wholly bent upon 
 the notion of my passing over in my boat to the main- 
 land. I looked back upon my present condition as 
 the most miserable that could possibly be ; that I was 
 not able to throw myself into anything, but death, that 
 could be called worse ; that if I reached the shore of 
 the main, I might perhaps meet with relief, or I might 
 coast along, as I did on the shore of Africa, till I came 
 to some inhabited country, and where I might find some 
 relief ; and after all, perhaps I might fall in with some 
 Christian ship that might take me in ; and if the worse 
 came to the worst, I could but die, which would put 
 an end to all these miseries at once. Pray note, all 
 this was the fruit of a disturbed mind, an impatient 
 temper, made as it were desperate by the long con- 
 tinuance of my troubles, and the disappointments I had 
 met in the wreck I had been on board of, and where I 
 had been so near the obtaining what I so earnestly 
 longed for, viz., somebody to speak to, and to learn 
 some knowledge from of the place where I was, and 
 of the probable means of my deliverance. I say, 1

 it was no more than a dream were equally extravagant 
 the other way, and threw me into a "ery g^eat dejection 
 of spirit. 
 
 Upon this, however, I made this conclusion; that 
 my only way to go about an attempt for an escape 
 was, if possible, to get a savage into my possession ; 
 and, if possible, it should be one of their prisoners 
 whom they had condemned to be eaten, and should 
 bring thither to kill. But these thoughts still were 
 attended with this difficulty, that it wa" impossible to 
 effect this without attacking a whole caravan of them, 
 and killing them all ; and this was not only a very 
 desperate attempt, and might miscarry, but, on the 
 other hand, I had greatly scrupled the lawfulness of 
 it to me ; and my heart trembled at the thoughts of 
 shedding so much blood, though it was for my deliver- 
 ance. I need not repeat the arguments which occurred 
 to me against this, they bein^ the same mentioned 
 before. But thv'>ugh I had other reasons to offer now, 
 viz., that those r.ien were enemies to my life, an'i would 
 devour me if they could ; that it was self-preservation, 
 in the highest degree, to deliver myself from this death 
 of a life, and was acting in my own defence as much as 
 if they were actually assaulting me, and the like ; I say, 
 though these things argued for it, yet the thoughts of 
 shedding human blood for my deliverance were very 
 terrible to me, and such as I could by no means re- 
 concile myself to a great while. 
 
 However, at last, after many secret disputes with 
 myself, and after great perplexities about it, for all 
 these arguments, one way and another, struggled in 
 my head a long time, the eager prevailing desire of 
 deliverance at length mastered all the rest, and I re- 
 solved, if possible, to get one of those savages into my 
 hands, cost what it would. My next thing then was 
 to contriv«i how to do it, and this indeed was very 
 difficult to resolve on. But as I could pitch upon no 
 probable means for it, so I resolved to put myself 
 upon the watch, to see them when they came on shore^ 
 and leave the rest to the event, taking such measures

 for action if anything had presented. Having waited 
 a good while, listening to hear if they made any noise, 
 at length, being very impatient, I set my guns at the 
 foot of my ladder, and clambered up to the top of the 
 hill, by my two stages, as usual ; standing so, however, 
 that my head did not appear above the hill, so that 
 they could not perceive me by any means. Here I 
 observed, by the help of my perspective -glass, that 
 they were no less than thirty in number, that they had 
 a fire Icindled, that they had had meat dressed. How 
 tiiey had cooked it, that I knew not, or what it was ; 
 but they were all dancing, in 1 know not how many 
 barbarous gestures and figures, their own way, round 
 the iira 
 
 While I was thus looking on them, I perceived by 
 my perspective two miserable wretches dragged from 
 the boats, where, it seems, they were laid by, and were 
 now brought out for the slaughter. I perceived one 
 of them immediately fell, being knocked down, I 
 suppose, with a club or wooden sword, for that was 
 their way, and two or three others were at work 
 immediately, cutting him open for their cookery, 
 while the other victim was left standing by himself, 
 till they should be ready for him. In that very 
 moment this poor wretch seeing himself a little at 
 liberty. Nature inspired him with hopes of life, and 
 he started away from them, and ran with incredible 
 swiftness along the sands directly towards me, I mean 
 towards that part of the coast where my habitation 
 was. 
 
 I was dreadfully frighted (that I must acknowledge) ' 
 when I perceived him to run my way, and especially 
 when, as I thought, I saw him pursued by the whole 
 body ; and now I expected that part of my dream was 
 coming to pass, and that he would certainly teke 
 shelter in my grove ; but I could not depend, by any 
 means, upon my dream for the rest of it, viz., that 
 the other savages would not pursue him thither, 
 and find him there. However, I kept my station, and 
 my spirits began to recover when I found that there

 knocked him down with the stock of my piece. I wai 
 loth to fire, because I would not have the rest hear ; 
 thouffh, at that distance, it would not have been easily 
 heard, and being out of sight of the smoke too, they 
 would not have easily known what to make of it 
 Having knocked this fellow down, the other who 
 pursued with him stopped, as if he had been frighted, 
 and I advanced apace towards him ; but as 1 came 
 nearer, I perceived presently he had a bow and arrow, 
 and was fitting it to shoot at me ; so I was then 
 necessitated to shoot at him first, which I did, and 
 killed him at the first shot 
 
 The poor savage who fled, but had stopped, though 
 he saw both his enemies fallen and killed, as he 
 thought, yet was so frighted with the fire and noise 
 of my piece, that he stood stock-still, and neither came 
 forward or went backward, though he neemed rather 
 Inclined to fly still, than to come on. I hallooed 
 again to him, and made signs to come forward, which 
 he easily understood, and came a little way, then 
 stopped again, and then a little further, and stopped 
 again ; and I could then perceive that he stood trem- 
 bling, as if he had been taken prisoner, and had just 
 been to be killed, as his two enemies were. I beckoned 
 him again to come to me, and gave him all the signs 
 of encouragement that I could think of ; and he came 
 nearer and nearer, kneeling down every ten or twelve 
 steps, in token of acknowledgment for my saving his 
 life. I smiled at him, and looked pleasantly, and 
 beckoned to him to come still nearer. At length he 
 came close to me, and then he kneeled down again, 
 kissed the ground, and laid his head upon the ground, 
 and taking me by the foot, set my foot upon his head. 
 This, it seems, was in token of swearing to be my slave 
 for ever. I took him up, and made much of him, and 
 encouraged him all I could. But there was more 
 work to do yet; for I perceived the savage whom I 
 knocked down was not killed, but stunn^ with the 
 blow, and began to come to himself ; so I pointed to 
 him, and showing him the savage, that he was not

 Upon this he signed to me that he should bury them 
 V7ith sand, that thev might not be seen hy the rest if 
 they followed ; and so I made signs again to liim to 
 do so. He fell to worlc, and in an instant he had 
 scraped a hole in the sand with his hands big enough 
 to bury the first in, and then dragged him into it, and 
 covered him, and did so also by tie other. I believe 
 he had buried them both in a quarter of ar hour. 
 Then calling him away, I carried him, not to my 
 castle, but quite awa^ to mv cave, on the farther part 
 of the island ; so 1 did not let my dream come to pass 
 in that part, viz., that he came into my grove for 
 shelter. 
 
 Here I gave him bread and a bunch of raisius to eat, 
 and a draught of water, which 1 found he was indeed 
 in great distress for, by his running ; and having re- 
 freshed him, I made signs for him to go lie down and 
 sleep, pointing to a place where I 'lad laid a great 
 parcel of rice-straw, and a blanket upon it, which I 
 used to sleep upon m3rself sometimes ; so the poor 
 creature laid down, and went to sleep. 
 
 He was a comely, handsome fellow, perfectly well 
 made, with straight strong limbs, not too large, tall, 
 and well-shaped, and, as I reckon, about twenty -six 
 years of age. He haJ a very good countenance, not 
 a fierce and surly aspect, but seemed to have some- 
 thing very manly in his &ce ; and yet he had itU the 
 sweetness and softness of an European in his counten- 
 ance too, especially when he smiled. His hair wis 
 long and black, not curled like wool ; his forehead 
 very high and large ; and a great vivacity and sparkling 
 sharpness in his eyes. The colour of his skin was not 
 quite black, but very tawny ; and vet not of an ugly, 
 yellow, nauseous tawny, as the Brazilians and Vir- 
 ginians, and other natives of America are, but of a 
 bright kind of a dun olive colour, that had in it some- 
 thing very agreeable, though not very easy to describe. 
 His &ce was round and plump ; his nose small not 
 fiat like the negroes; a very good mouth, thin lips, 
 and his fine teeth well set, and white as ivory. 
 
 
 After he had slumbered, rather than Blept, about 
 half an hour, he waked again, and comes out of the 
 cave to me, for I had been milking my goats, which 
 I had in Uie enclosure just by. When he espied me, 
 he came running to me, laying himself down again 
 upon the ground, with all the possible signs of an 
 humble, thankful disposition, making a many antic 
 gestures to show it At last he lays his hrad flat 
 upon the ground, close to my foot, and seU my other 
 foot upon his head, as he had done before, and after 
 this m^e all the signs to me of subjection, servitude 
 and submission imamnable, to let me know how he 
 would serve me as long as he lived. 1 understood 
 him in many things, and let him know I was very 
 weU pleased with him. In a little time I began to 
 speak to him, and teach him to speak to me; and, 
 first, 1 made him know his name should be Friday 
 which was the day I saved his life. I caUed him so 
 for the memory of the time. I likewise taught him 
 to say master, and then let him know that was to be 
 my name. I likewise taught him to say Yes and No, 
 and to know the meaning of them. I gave him some 
 milk m an earthen pot, and let him see me drink it 
 before him, and sop my bread in it ; and I gave him 
 a cake of bread to do the like, which he quickly 
 complied with, and made signs that it was very ffood 
 for him. ' ® 
 
 I kept there with him all that night ; but as soon as 
 It was day, I beckoned to him to come with me, and 
 let him know I would give him some clothes ; at which 
 he seemed very glad, for he was stark naked. As we 
 went by the place where he had buried the two men 
 he pointed exactly to the place, and showed me the 
 marks that he had made to find them again, makinir 
 signs to me that we should dig them up again, and &tt 
 them. At tins I appeared very angry, expressed my 
 abhorrence of it, made as if I would vomit at the 
 thoughts of it, and beckoned with my hand to him to 
 come away; which he did immediately, with irreat 
 submission. I then led him up to the top of the hiU 
 
 i. 
 
 
 to M6 if hii euemiM were goue ; and pulling out vay 
 tlaaa, I looked, and nw plainly the puce where they 
 had been, but no appearance of them or of their 
 canoes ; lo that it wai plain that they were gone, and 
 had left their two comrades behind them, without any 
 search after them. 
 
 But 1 was not content with this discovery; but 
 having now more courage, and consequent!^ more 
 curiosity, I talceti my man Fridav with me, giving him 
 the sword in his hand, with the bow and arrows at his 
 back, which 1 found he could use very dexterousW, 
 making him carry one gun for me, and I two for 
 myself and away we marched to the place where these 
 creatures had been ; for I had a mind now to get SQme 
 fuller intelligence of them. When I came to the 
 
 Elace, my very blood ran chill in my veins, and my 
 eart sunk within me, at the horror of the spectacle. 
 Indeed, it was a dreadful ei^ht. at least it was so to 
 me, though Friday mauo nothing of it The place was 
 covered with human bones, the ground dyed with their 
 blood, great pieces of flesh left here and there, half- 
 eaten, mangled, and scorched ; and, in short, all the 
 tokens of the triumphant feast they had been making 
 there, after a victory over their enemies. 1 saw three 
 skulls, iive hands, and the bones of three or four legs 
 and feet, and abundance of oC'^r parts of the bodies ; 
 and Friday, by his signs, made me understand that 
 they brought over four prisoners to feast upon ; that 
 three of them were eaten up, and that he, pointing to 
 himself, was the fourth ; that there had beer a great 
 battle between them and their next king, whose sub- 
 jects it seems he had been one of, and that they had 
 taken a great number of prisoners ; all which were 
 carried to several places by those that had taken them 
 in tiie fight, in order to feast upon them, as was done 
 here by Uiese wretches upon those they brought 
 hither. 
 
 I caused Friday to gather all the skulls, bones, flesh, 
 and whatever remained, and lay them together on a 
 heap, and make a great fire upon it, and bum them all

 When we had done thia we came back to our caaUe

 And that I m ght do weU for him, and yet be perfSv

 l?' Jr*^''*^* ^^"^ ^°*'' "-y <»^e> I made a foTSLd 
 
 Hu^t tr"'"^' "°^ ^ ^r' *« •* °^ boards, anHt 
 ^ up in the passage, a little within the entrance : and 
 
 m the night, taking m my ladders too ; so that Frida? 
 
 jail without making so much noise in getting over, that 
 «t must needs waken me ; for my first walffl aow a 
 complete roof over it of long jiles, coTeri^ aHv 
 
 
 tent, and leaning up to the side of the hill, which was 
 a(jain laid cross with smaller sticks instead of laths, 
 and then thr .jhed over a great thickness with the rice- 
 straw, which was strong, like reeds ; and at the hole 
 or place which was left to go in or out by the ladder, I 
 had placed a kind of trap-door, which, if it had been 
 attempted on the outside, would not have opened at 
 all, but would have fallen down, and made a great 
 noise ; and as to weapons, I took them all into my side 
 
 every night . 
 
 But I needed none of all this precaution ; for never 
 man had a more faithful, loving, sincere servant than 
 Friday "was to me ; without passions, sullenness, or 
 designs, perfectly obliged and engaged ; his very affec- 
 tions were tied to me, like those of a child to a father ; 
 and I dare say he would have sacrificed his life for the 
 saving mine, upon any occasion whatsoever. The many 
 testimonies he gave me of this put it out of doubt, and 
 soon convinced me that I needed to use no precautions 
 as to my safety on his account. 
 
 This frequently gave me occasion to observe, and that 
 with wonder, that however it had pleased God, in His 
 providence, and in the government of the works of His 
 hands, to take from so great a part of the world of 
 His creatures the best uses to which their faculties and 
 the powers of their souls are adapted, yet that He has 
 bestowed upon them the same powers, the same reason, 
 the same affections, the same sentiments of kindness 
 and obligation, the same passions and resentments of 
 wrongs, the same sense of gratitude, sincerity, fidelity, 
 and all the capacities of doing good, and receiving good, 
 that He has given to us ; and that when He pleases to 
 offer to them occasions of exerting these, they are as 
 ready, nay, more ready, to apply them to the right 
 uses for which they were bestowed than we are. And 
 this made me very melancholy sometimes, in reflecting, 
 as the several occasions presented, how mean a use we 
 make of all these, even though we have these powers 
 enlightened by the great lamp of instruction, the Spirit 
 of God, and by the knowledge of His Word added ia 
 
 
 ?hP 'i^T^^^^' and why it has pleased God to hide 
 S,!i; \ "^IPf knowledge from so many millions of 
 souls, who. If I might judge by this poor skvage, would 
 make a much better use of it than we did

 212 ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 
 
 I went, indeed, intending to kill a kid out of my own 
 flock, and bring him home and dress it ; but as I was 
 going, 1 saw a she-goat lying down in the shade, and 
 two young kids sitting by her. I catched hold of 
 Friday. ^Hold,' says I, 'stand still,' and made signs 
 to him not to stir. Immediately I presented my piece, 
 shot and killed one of the kids. The poor creature, 
 who had, at a distance indeed, seen me kill the savage, 
 his enemy, but did not know, or could imagine, how it 
 was done, was sensibly surprised, trembled and shook, 
 and looked so amazed, that I thought he would have 
 sunk down. He did not see the kid I had shot at, or 
 perceive I had killed it, but ripped up his waistcoat to 
 feel if he was not wounded ; and, as I found presently, 
 thought I was resolved to kill him ; for he came and 
 kneeled down to me, and embracing mv knees, said a 
 great many things I did not understand ; but I could 
 easily see that the meaning was to pray me not to kill 
 him. 
 
 I soon found a way to convince him that I would do 
 him no harm ; and taking him up by the hand, laughed 
 at him, and pointing to the kid which I had killed, 
 beckoned to him to run and fetch it, which he did; 
 and while he was wondering, and looking to see how 
 the creature was killed, I loaded my gun again ; and 
 by and by 1 saw a great fowl, like a hawk, sit upon a 
 tree, within shot ; so, to let Friday understand a little 
 what I would do, I called him to me again, pointing 
 at the fowl, which was indeed a parrot, though I thought 
 it had been a hawk ; I say, pointing to the parrot, and 
 to my gun, and to the ground under the parrot, to let 
 him see I would make it fall, I made him understand 
 that I would shoot and kill that bird. Accordingly I 
 fired, and bade him look, and immediately he saw the 
 parrot fiill. He stood like one frighted again, notwith- 
 standing all I had said to him ; and I found he was the 
 more amazed, because he did not see me put an3rthiDg 
 into the gun, but thought that there ^ust be some 
 wonderful fund of death and destruction in that thing, 
 able to kill man, beast, bird, or anything near or iar 
 
 
 off; and the astonishment this created in him was such 
 as could not wear off for a W time ; and I bdieve 5

 and one cross on the top^ and tying the string to the 
 cross stick, letting the meat turn continually. This 
 Friday admired very much. But when he came to 
 taste the ilesh, he took so many ways to tell me how 
 well he liked it, that I could not but understand him ; 
 and at last he told me he would never eat man's flesh 
 f more, which I was very glad to hear. 
 
 rhe next day I set him to work to beating some 
 ( ^ out, and sifting it in the manner I used to do, 
 as 1 observed before ; and he soon understood how to 
 do it as well as I, especially after he had seen what 
 the meaning of it was, and that it was to make bread 
 of; for after that I let him see me make my bread, 
 and bake it too ; and in a little time Friday was able 
 to do all the work for me, as well as I could do it 
 myself. 
 
 I began now to consider that, having two mouths 
 to feed instead of one, 1 must provide more ground 
 for my harvest, and plant a larger quantity of corn 
 than I used to do ; so I marked out a larger piece 
 of land, and began the fence in the same manner as 
 before, in which Friday not only worked very wil- 
 lingly and very hard, but did it very cheerfully ; and 
 I told him what it was for ; that it was for corn to 
 make more bread, because he was now with me, and 
 that I might have enough for him and myself too. 
 He appeared very sensible of that part, and let me 
 know that he thought I had much more labour upon 
 me on his account, than I had for myself; and that 
 he would work the harder for me, if I would tell him 
 what to do. 
 
 This was the pleasantest year of all the life I led 
 in this place. Friday began to talk pretty well, and 
 understand the names of almost everything I had 
 occasion to call for, and of every place I had to send 
 him to, and talk a great deal to me ; so that, in 
 short, I began now to have some use for my tongue 
 again, which, indeed, I had very little occasion for 
 before, that is to say, about speech. Besides the plea- 
 sure of talking to him, I had a singular satisfaction 
 
 
 in the fellow himself. His simple, unfeigned honestt 
 appeared to me more and more every day, and I 
 began really to love the creature ; and, on his side, 
 I believe he loved me more than it was possible for 
 him ever to love anythinsf before. 
 
 I had a mind once to" try if he had any hankering 
 mchnation to his own cou.utry again; and having 
 learned him English so well that he could answer me 
 almost any questions, I asked him whether the nation 
 that he belonged to never conquered in battle.^ At 
 which he smiled, and said, * Yes, yes, we always fight 
 the better' ; that is, he meant, always get the better in 
 fight ; and so we began the following discourse : * You 
 always fight the better,' said I. ' How came you to be 
 taken prisoner then, Friday.^' 
 
 Friday. My nation beat much for all that. 
 
 Master. How beat } If your nation beat them, how 
 came you to be tal.en .'' 
 
 Friday. They more many than my nation in the 
 place where me was ; they take one, two, three, and 
 me. My nation overheat them in the yonder place, 
 where me no was; there my nation take one, two, 
 great thousand. 
 
 Master. But why did not your side recover you from 
 the hands of your enemies then } 
 
 Friday. They run one, two, three, and me, and 
 make go in the canoe ; my nation have no canoe that 
 time. 
 
 Master. Well, Friday, and what does your nation 
 do with the men they take ? Do they carry them away 
 and eat them, as these did ? 
 
 Friday. Yes, my nation eat mans too ; eat all up. 
 
 Master. Where do they carry them ^ 
 
 Friday. Go to other place, where \ . jy think. 
 
 Master. Do they come hither ? 
 
 Friday. Yes, yes, they come hither ; come other else 
 place. 
 
 Master. Have you been here with them } 
 Friday. Yes, I been here. {Points to the N. W. side 
 of the island, which, it seems, was their side.) 
 
 
 'li 
 
 
 By this I understood that my man Friday had 
 formerly been among the savages who used to come 
 on shore on the farther part of the island, on the same 
 man-eating occasions that he was now brought for; 
 and, some time after, when I toolc the courage to carry 
 him to that side, being the same I formerly mentioned, 
 he presently knew the place, and told me he was there 
 once when they eat up twenty men, two women, and 
 one child. He could not tell twenty in English, but 
 he numbered them by laying so many stones on a row, 
 and pointing to me to tell them over. 
 
 I have told this passage^ because it introduces what 
 follows ; that after I had had this discourse with him, 
 I asked him how far it was from our island to the 
 shore, and whether the canoes were not often lost He 
 told me there was no danger, no canoes ever lost ; 
 but that, after a little way out to the sea, there was a 
 current and a wind, always one way in the morning, 
 the other in the afternoon. 
 
 This I understood to be no more than the sets of 
 tbe tide, as going out or coming in ; but I afterwards 
 understood it was occasioned by the great draught and 
 reflux of the mighty river Oroonoko, in the mouth or 
 the gulf of which river, as I found afterwards, our 
 island lay ; and this land which I perceived to the W. 
 and N.W. was the great island Trinidad, on the north 
 point of the mouth of the river. I asked Friday a 
 thousand questions about the country, the inhabitants^ 
 the sea, the coast, and what nation were near. He 
 told me all he knew, with the greatest openness 
 imaginable. I asked him the names of the several 
 nations of his sort of people, but could get no other 
 name than Caribs ; from whence I easily understood 
 that these were the Caribbees, which our maps place on 
 the part of America which reaches from the mouth of 
 the river Oroonoko to Guiana, and onwards to St 
 Martha. He told me that up a great way beyond 
 the moon, that was, beyond the setting of the moon, 
 which must be W. from their country, there dwelt 
 white-bearded men, like me, and pointed to my great 
 
 
 whiskers, which I mentioned before ; and that they had 
 
 .TiS®lj""^^l "'"'^ *^?' ^"^ *>" '^or<* ; fey all which 1 
 understood he meant the Spaniards, whose cruelties in 
 America had been spread over the whole countries 
 and was remembered by all the nations from father to 
 son. 
 
 I inquired if he could tell me how I might come 
 from this ishind and get among those white men. He

 ^^^^l u** "IT* V,*^*» ^°°® 5 t^l at last, ^th 
 great difficulty, I found he meant it must be in a larire 
 great boat, as big as two canoes. * 
 
 This part of Friday's discourse began to relish with 
 
 hnrTI T^" ' "B^ ^°" ^'^ ^^"^ ^ entertained some 
 hopes that, one time or other, I might find an oppor- 
 tumty to make my escape from this place, and that this 
 V poor savage miffht be a means to hefp me to do it. 
 During the long time that Friday had now been 
 with me, and that he began to speak to me, and under- 
 stand me, I was not wanting to lay a foundation of 
 rehgious knowledge in his mind ; particularly I asked 
 him one time. Who made him ? TTbie poor criture did

 Maker of all things lived up there, pointi: j up towards 
 heaven ; that He governs tne world by the same power 
 and providence by which He had made it ; that He was 
 omnipotent, could do everything for us, give everything 
 to US, take everything from us ; and thus, by degrees, 
 I opened his eyes. He listened with great attention, 
 and received with pleasure the notion of Jesus Christ 
 being sent to redeem us, and of the manner of making 
 our prayers to God, and His being able to hear us, even 
 into heaven. He told me one day that if our God 
 could hear us up beyond the sun. He must needs be a 
 greater God than their Benamuckee, who lived but a 
 little way off, and yet could not hear till they went up 
 to the great mountains where he dwelt to speak to him. 
 I asked him if he ever went thither to speak to him ? 
 He said. No ; they never went that were young men ; 
 none went thither but the old men, whom he called their 
 Oowokakee, that is, as I made him explain it to me, 
 their religious, or clergy ; and that they went to say 
 O (so he called saying prayers), and then came back, 
 and told them what Benamuckee said. By this I 
 observed thLi there is priestcraft even amongst the 
 most blinded, ignorant pagans in the world ; and the 
 policy of making a secret religion in order to preserve 
 the veneration of the people to the clergy is not only to 
 be found in the Roman, but perhaps among all religions 
 in the world, even among the most brutish and bar- 
 barous savages. 
 
 I endeavoured to clear up this fraud to my man 
 Friday, and told him that the pretence of their old men 
 going up to the mountains to say O to their god Bena- 
 muckee was a cheat, and their bringing word from 
 thence what he said was much more so ; that if they 
 met with any answer, or spoke with any one there, it 
 must be with an evil spirit ; and then I entered into a 
 long discourse with him about the devil, the original of 
 him, his rebellion against God, his enmity to man, the 
 reason of it, his setting himself up in the dark parts of 
 the world to be worshipped instead cf God, and as 
 Grod, and the many stratagems he made use of to delude 
 
 
 mankind to their ruin ; how he had a secret access to 
 our passions and to our affections, to adapt his snarM 
 so to our inclinations, as to cause us even to Cou^

 to do evil, and to draw us in to do so too ; and the 
 
 poor creature puzzled me once in such a mamier by a 
 question merely natural and innocent, that I scarce 
 knew what to say to him. I had been 'talking a grS?

 a solver of difficulUei ; and at first I could not tell 
 what to say ; so I pretended not to hear him, and asked 
 him what he said? But he was too earnest for an 
 answer to forget his question, so that he repeated it in the 
 very same broken words as above. By this time 1 had 
 recovered myself a little, and I said, ' God will at last 
 punish him severely ; ho is reserved for the judgment, 
 and is to be cast into the bottomless pit, to dwell with 
 everlasting fire.* This did not satisfy Friday ; but he 
 returns upon me, repeating mv words, * Reserve at 
 last ! me no understand ; but wny not kill the' devil 
 now ? not kill great ago ?' * You may as well ask me,' 
 said I, ' why God does not kill you and I, when we do 
 wicked things here that offend Him ; we are preserved 
 to repent and be pardoned.' He muses awhile at this. 
 'Well, well,' says he, mighty affectionately, 'that 
 well ; so you, I, devil, all wicked, all preserve, repent, 
 God pardon all.' Here I was run down again by him 
 to the last degree, and it was a testimony to me how 
 the mere notions of nature, though they will guide 
 reasonable creatures to the knowledge of a God, and of 
 a warship or homage due to the supreme being of God, 
 as the consequence of our nature, yet nothing but 
 Divine revelation can form the knowledgo of Jesus 
 Christ, and of a redemption purchased for us, of a 
 Mediator of the new covenant, and of an Intercessor at 
 the footstool of God's tiirone; I say, nothing but a 
 revelation from heaven can form these in the soul, and 
 that therefore the Gospc^ of our Lord and Saviour 
 Jesus Christ, I mean the Word of God, and the Spirit 
 of God, promised for the guide and sanctifier of His 
 people, are the absolutely necessary instructors of the 
 souls of men in the B&vmg knowledge of God, and the 
 means of salvation. 
 
 I therefore diverted the present discourse between 
 me and my man, rising up hastily, as upon some sudden 
 occasion of going out ; then sending him for something 
 a good way off, I s&riously prayed to God that He 
 would enable me to instruct savingly this poor ttavage, 
 assisting, by His Spirit, the heart of the poor ignorant 
 
 
 creature to receive the light of the knowledge of God 
 in Lhnst, reconciling him to Hinwelf, and would 
 ffuide me to ipeak so to him from the Word of God a« 
 hi8 conMience might be convinced, his eyes opened, 
 and hts soul saved. When he came again to me, 1 
 enter^ into a long discourse with him upon the sib- 
 ject of the redemption of man by the Saviour of the 
 world, and of the ''-ctrine of the Gospel preached from 
 heaven, viz., of repentance towards God, and faith in 
 our blessed Lord Jesus. I then explained to him as 
 well as I could why our blessed Redeemer took not on 
 Him the nature of angels, but the seed of Abraham ; 
 and how, for that reason, the fallen angels had no 
 share in the redempUon ; that He came only to the 
 lost sheep of the house of Israel, and the like. 
 
 1 had, God knows, more sincerity than knovled«»in 
 all the methods I took for this poor creature's instruc 
 tion, and must acknowledge, what I believe all that

 only been moved myself to look up to heaven, and to 
 seek to the Hand that had brought me there, but was

 reflected upon all these things, a secret joy rai through 
 every part of my soul, and I frequently rejoiced that 
 
 4 
 
 
 ever I was brought to this place, which I had so often 
 thought the most dreadful of all afflictionH that could 
 posflioly have befallen me. 
 
 In this thankful frame I continued all the remainder 
 of my time, and the conv( .*sation which employed the 
 hours between Friday and I was such, as made the 
 three years which we lived there together perfectly and 
 completely happy, if any such thing as complete happi- 
 ness can he formed in a subluuaiy state. The savage 
 was now a good Oiristian, a much better than 1 ; 
 though I have reason to hope, and bless Ciod for it, 
 that we were equally penitent, and comforted, restored 
 peuiter*<i. VVe had here the Word of God to read, 
 and no farther off from His Spirit to instruct than if 
 we had been in England. 
 
 I always applied mvself to reading the Scripture, to 
 let him know, as well as 1 could, the meaning of what 
 I rend; and he again, by his sei'tus inquiries and 
 questions, made me, as I said before, a much better 
 scholar in the Scripture-knowledge than I should ever 
 have l)een by my own private mere reading. Another 
 thing 1 cannot refrain from observing here also, from 
 experience in this retired part of my life, viz., how 
 infinite and inexpressible a blessing it is that the know- 
 ledge of God, and of the doctrine of salvation by Christ 
 Jesus, is so plainly laid down in the Word of God, so 
 easy to be received and understood ; that as the bare 
 reading the Scripture made me capable of under- 
 standing enough of my duty to carry me directly on to 
 the ^reat work of sincere repentance for my sins, au J 
 laying hold of a Saviour for life and salvation, to a 
 stated reformation in practice, and obedience to all 
 God's commands, and this without any teacher or 
 instructor (I mean human) ; so the same plain instruc- 
 tion sufficiently served to the enlightening this savage 
 creature, and bringing him to be such a Cliristian, as 1 
 have known few equal to him in my life. 
 
 As to all the disputes, wranglings, strife, and 
 contention which has happened in the world about 
 religion, whether niceties in doctrines, or schemes of 
 
 
 Church government, they were all perfectly unelem to 
 u« ; M, for aught I can yet see, they have been to all 
 the rest In the world. We had the 8ure guide to 
 heaven, viz., the Word of God; and we had, hfewed be 
 Ood, comfortable view* of the Spirit of God teaching 
 and instructing us by His Word, leading us into all 
 truth, and making us both willing and obedient to the 
 instruction of His Word ; and I cannot see the least 
 use that the greatest knowledge of the disputed points 
 m religion, which have made such confusions m the 
 world, would have been to us if we could have obtained 
 It But 1 must go on with the historical part of thiiiirs. 
 and take every part in its order. 
 
 After Friday and 1 became more intimately ac- 
 quainted, and that he could understand almost all I 
 ^id to him, and speak fluently, though in broken 
 hnglish, to me, I acquainted him with my own story, 
 or at east so much of it as related to my coming into 
 the place; how I had lived there, and how long. I 
 let hm. into the mystery, for such it was to him, of 
 gunpowder and bullet, and taught him how to shol)t : 
 1 gave him a knife, which he was wonderfully delighted 
 with, and I made him a belt, with a frog hanging to 
 it, such as m Eng and we wear hangers in ; and in the 
 trog, instead of a hanger, I gave him a hatchet, which 
 was not only as good a weapon, in some cases, but much 
 more useful upon other occasions. 
 
 1 described to him the country of Europe, and parti- 
 cularly England, which I came from ; how we lived, 
 how we worshipped God, how we behaved to one 
 another, and how we traded in ships to all parts of the 
 worid. I gave him an account of the wreck which I 
 had been on board of, and showed him, as near as I 
 could, the place where she ky ; but she was all beaten 
 m pieces before, and gone. 
 
 I showed him the ruins of our boat, which we lost 
 when we escaned, and which I could not stir with my 
 whole strength then, but was now fallen almost all to 
 pieces. Upon seeing this boat, Friday stood musing a 
 great whUe, and said nothing. I asked him what it 
 
 
 
 was he studied upon. At last says he, ' Me see such 
 boat like come to place at my nation.' 
 
 I did not understand him a good while ; but at last, 
 when I had examined further into it, I understood by 
 him that a boat such as that had been, came on shore 
 upon the country where he lived ; that is, as he ex- 
 pUiined it, was driven thither by stress of weather. I 
 presently imagined that some European ship must have 
 been cast away upon their coast, and the boat might 
 get loose and drive ashore ; but was so dull, that I 
 never once thought of men making escape from a wreck 
 thither, much less whence they might come ; so I only 
 inquired after a description of the boat 
 
 Friday described the boat to me well enough ; but 
 brought me better to understand him when he added 
 with some warmth, 'We save the white mans froni 
 drown.' Then I presently asked him if there was any 
 white mans, as he called them, in the boat. * Yes,' he 
 said, 'the boat full of white mans.' I asked him how 
 many. He told upon his fingers seventeen. I asked 
 him then what became of them. He told me, ' They 
 live, they dwell at my nation.' 
 
 This put new thoughts into my head ; for I presently 
 imagined that these might be the men belonging to the 
 ship that was cast away in sight of my island, as I now 
 (»[ll it ; and who, after the ship was struck on the rock, 
 and they saw her inevitably lost, had saved themselves 
 in their boat, and were landed upon that wild shore 
 among the savages. . . „ , 
 
 Upon this I inquired of him more critically what 
 was become of tfiem. He assured me they lived still 
 there ; that they had been there about four years ; that 
 the savages let them alone, and gave them victuals to 
 Uve. I asked him how it came to pass they did not 
 kill them, and eat them. He said, * No, they make 
 brother with them' ; that is, as I understood him, a 
 truce; and then he added, 'They no eat mans but 
 when make the war fight' ; that is to say, they never 
 eat any men but such as come to fight with them and 
 are taken in battle. 
 
 
 It was after this some considerable time, that beinir 
 
 (from whence, as I have said, I had in a clear dayd^ 
 covered Uie main or continent of America) Friday t£ 
 wither being very serene, looks very earnesUy toward! 
 the mainland, and, in a kind of surprise, falls a-jumpW 
 and dancing, and calls out to me, for Iwas at wmf 
 distance from him. I asked him what wis t?e maZ ?

 that If Friday could get back to his own nation again

 nourish my suspicion ; and, in spite of all my uneasi- 
 ness, he made me at last entirely his own again, nor 
 did he in the least perceive that I was uneasy, and 
 therefore I could not suspect him of deceit 
 
 One day, walking up the same hill, but the weather 
 being hazy at sea, so that we could not see the conti- 
 nent, 1 called to him, and said, * Friday, do not you 
 wish yourself in your own country, your own nation ? ' 
 * Yes,' he said, * I be much O glad to be at my own 
 nation.' * What would you do there ? ' said I. ' Would 
 you turn wild again, eat men's flesh again, and be a 
 savage as you were before?' He looked full of con- 
 cern, and shaking his head said, *No, no; Friday 
 tell them to live good ; tell them to pray God ; tell 
 them to eat corn-bread, cattle-flesh, milk, no eat mau 
 again.' * Why then,' said I to him, * they will kill 
 you.' He looked grave at that, and then said, * No, 
 they no kill me, they willing love learn.' He meant 
 by this they would be willing to learn. He added, 
 they learned much of the bearded mans that come in 
 the boat Then I asked him if he would go back to 
 them ? He smiled at that, and told me he could not 
 swim so for. I told him I would make a canoe for 
 him.. He told me he would go, if I would go with 
 him. * I go ! ' says I ; * why, they will eat me if I 
 come there.' *No, no,' says he, *me make they no 
 eat you ; me make they much love you.' He meant, 
 he would tell them how I had killed his enemies, and 
 saved his life, and so he would make them love me. 
 Then he told me, as well as he could, how kind they 
 were to seventeen white men, or bearded men, as he 
 called them, who came on shore there in distress. 
 
 From this time I confess I had a mind to venture 
 over, and see if I could possibly join with these bearded 
 men, who, I made no doubt, were Spaniards or Portu- 
 guese; not doubting but, if I could, we might find 
 some method to escape from thence, being upon the 
 continent, and a good company together, better than 
 I could from an ishmd forty miles o£F the shore, and 
 alone, without help. So, after some days, I took

 mans to be 
 
 
 good, sober, tame mans ; you tell them know God, 
 pray God, and live new life.' 'Alas ! Friday,' says I, 
 ^thou knowest not what thou sayest. I am but an 
 ignorant man myself.' * Yes, yes,' says he, ' you 
 teachee me good, you teachee them good.' *No, no, 
 Friday,* says I, * you shall go without me ; leave me 
 here to live by myself, as I did before.' He looked 
 confused again at that word, and running to one of 
 the hatchets which he used to wear, he takes it up 
 hastily, comes and gives it me. 'What must I do 
 with this.'*' says I to him. 'You take kill Friday,' 
 says he. . * What must I kill you for } ' said I again. 
 He returns very quick, ' What you send Friday away 
 for.? Take kill Friday, no send Friday away.' This 
 he spoke so earnestly, that I saw tears stand in his eyes. 
 In a word, I so plainly discovered the utmost affection 
 in him to nie, and a firm resolution in him, that I told 
 him then, and often after, that I would never send him 
 away from me if he was willing to stay with me. 
 
 Upon the whole, as I found by all his discourse a 
 settled affection to me, and that nothing should part 
 him from me, so I found all the foundation of his 
 desire to go to his own country was laid in his ardent 
 affection to the people, and his hopes of my doing them 
 good , a thing whicli, as I had no notion of myself, so 
 I had not the least thought or intention or desire of 
 undertaking it But still I found a strong inclination 
 to my attempting an escape, as above, founded on the 
 supposition gathered from the discourse, viz., that there 
 were seventeen bearded men there ; and, therefore, 
 without any more delay I went to work with Friday 
 to find out a great tree proper to fell, and make a large 
 periagua, or canoe, to undertake the voyage. There 
 were trees enough in the island to have built a little 
 fleet, not of periaguas and canoes, but even of good 
 large vessels. But the ma-n thing I looked at was, to 
 get one so near the water that we might launch it when 
 it was made, to avoid the mistake I committed at first 
 
 At last Friday pitched upon a tree, for I found he 
 knew much better than I what kind of wood was fittest 
 
 
 for it ; nor can I tell, to this day, what wood to call 
 the tree we cut down, except that it was very like the 
 tree we call fustic, or between that and the Nicarairua 
 wood, for It was much of the same colour and smell, 
 friday was for burning the hollow or cavity of this 
 tree out, to make it for a boat, but I showed him how 
 rather to cut it out with tools; which, after I hkd 
 showed him how to use, he did very handily ; and in 
 about a month s hard labour we finished it, and made it 
 yenr handsome ; especially when, with our axes, which 
 I showed him how to handle, we cut and hewed the 
 outside into the true shape of a boat. After this, how- 
 ever. It cost us near a fortnight's time to get her alone, 
 as It were inch by inch, upon great rollers into the 
 water ; but when she was in, she would have carried 
 twenty men with great ease. 
 
 When she was in the water, and though she was so 
 big, It amazed me to see with what dexterity, and how 
 swift mv man Friday would manage her, turn her, and 
 paddle her along. So I asked him if he would, and if 
 we might venture over in her. 'Yes,' he said, 'he 
 venture over in her very well, though great blow wind.' 
 However, I had a farther design that he knew nothing 
 ot, and that was to make a mast and sail, and to fit 
 her with an anchor and cable. As to a mast, that was 
 easy enough to get ; so I nitched upon a straight young 
 cedar tree, which I founS near the place, and which 
 there was great plenty of in the island ; and I set Friday 
 to work to cut it down, and gave him directions how 
 to shape and order it But as to the sail, that was my 
 particular care. I knew I had old sails, or rather 
 pieces of old sails enough; but as I had had them 
 
 o,JIf rf "*^"''* ^^"1 ^y "*«' *"*^ h«d not been very 
 careful to preserve them, not imagining that I should 
 ever have this kind of use for them, f did not doubt

 made a three-cornered ugly thing, like what we call Id 
 England a shoulder-of-mutton sail, to go with a boom 
 at bottom, and a little short sprit at the top, such as 
 usually our ships' longboats sail with, and such as I 
 best knew how to manage ; because it was such a one 
 as I had to the boat in which I made my escape from 
 Barbary, as related in the first part of my story. 
 
 I was near two months performing this last work, 
 viz., rigging and fitting my mast and sails; for I 
 finished them very complete, making a small stay, and 
 a sail, or foresail, to it, to assist, if we should turn to 
 windward; and, which was more than all, I fixed a 
 rudder to the stern of her to steer with ; and though I 
 was but a bungling shipwright, yet as I knew the 
 usefulness, and even necessity, of such a thing, I applied 
 myself with so much pains to do it, that at last I 
 brought it to pass ; though, considering the many dull 
 contrivances I had for it that failed, I think it cost me 
 almost as much labour as making the boat. 
 
 After all this was done too, I had my man Friday 
 to teach as to what belonged to the navigation of my 
 boat ; for though he knew very well how to paddle a 
 canoe, he knew nothing what belonged to a sail and a 
 rudder; and was the most amazed when he saw me 
 work the boat to and again in the sea by the rudder, 
 and how the sail jibbed, and filled this way, or that 
 way, as the course we sailed changed ; I say, when he 
 saw this, he stood like one astonished and amazed. 
 However, with a little use I made all these tilings 
 familiar to him, and he became an expert sailor, 
 except that as to the compass I could make him 
 understand very little of that. On the other hand, 
 as there was very little cloudy weather, and seldom 
 or never any fogs in those parts, there was the 
 less occasion for a compass, seeing the stars were 
 always to be seen by night, and the shore by day, 
 except in the rainy seasons, and then nobody cared to 
 stir abroad, either by land or sea. 
 
 I was now entered on the seven and twentieth 
 year of my captivity in this place ; though the three 
 
 
 lart years that I had this creature with me ouirht 
 rather to be left out of the recount, my habitation 
 bemg quite of another kind than in aU the rest of the 
 tune. I kept the anniversary of my landing here with 
 the same thankfulness to God for His mercies as at 
 brst; and if I had such cause of acknowledgment at 
 hrst, i had much more so now, having such additional 
 testimonies of the care of Providence over me, and the 
 great hopes I had of being eflFectually and speedily 
 dehvered^; for I had an invincible impression upon my 
 thoughts that my deliverance was at hand, and that I 
 should not be another year in this place. However, I 
 r°,«n^r ? ^y.^^sl^ndnr, digging, planting, fencing, 
 as .isual. I gathered and cured my grapes, and did 
 e^ . ry necessary thing as before. ^' 
 
 The rainy season was, in the meantime, upon me, 
 when I kept more withm doors than at other times : so I 
 bad stowed our newvessel as secure as we could, brinirinir 
 her up into the cr^k, where, as I said in the beginning, 
 I landed my rafts from the ship ; and hauling her up 
 to the shore at high-water mark, I made my maS 
 Friday dig a littie dock, just big enough to hold her. 
 and just deep enough to give her water enough to float 
 m ; and then, when the tide was out, we made a stronjr 
 dam cross the end of it, to keep the water out ; and 
 80 she lay dry, as to the tide, from the sea; and to 
 keep the ram off, we laid a great many boughs of trees, 
 80 thick, that she was as well thatched as a house 
 and thus we raited for the month of November and 
 Uecember, in which I designed to make my adventure. 
 
 ti,« vf r® ^J*^?** ^®*^°° ^««*° *° co™e in, as the 
 thought of my design returned with the feir weather. 
 1 was preparing daily for the voyage; and the first 
 thing I did was to lay by a certain quantity of pro- 
 visions, being the stores for our voyage ; and intended, 
 n a week or a fortnight's time, to open the dock, and 
 launch out our boat I was busy one morning upon 
 ^mething of this kind, when I called to Fridfy, ^d 
 om him go to the sea-shore and see if he could find 
 a turUe, or tortoise, a thing which we generaUy got 
 
 I 
 
 
 once a week, for the sake of the eggs as well as the 
 flesh. Friday had not been long gone when he came 
 running back, and flew over my outer wall, or fence, 
 like one that felt not the ground, or the steps he set 
 his feet on ; and before I had time to speak to him, 
 he cries out to me, ' O master ! O master ! O 
 sorrow! O bad!' 'What's the matter, Friday?' 
 says I. *0 yonder, there,' savs he, 'one, two, 
 three canoe ! one, two, three l' By his way of 
 speaking, I concluded there were six ; but, on inquiry, 
 I found it was but three. *Well, Friday,' says I, 
 'do not be frighted.' So I heartened him up as well 
 as I could. However, I saw the poor fellow was 
 most terribly scared ; for nothing ran in his head but 
 that they were come to look for him, and would cut 
 him in pier<^, and eat him ; and the poor fellow 
 trembled so

 asked him whether, if 
 would defend me, and 
 
 I scarce knew what to do with him. 
 I comforted him as well as I could, and told him I 
 was in as much danger as he, and that they would eat 
 me as well as him. ' But,' says I, ' Friday, we 
 must resolve to fight them. Can you fight, Friday } ' 
 ' Me shoot,' says he ; * but there come many great 
 
 for that,' said I again ; ' our

 I resolved to defend him, he 
 stand by me, and do just as I 
 bid him. He said, 'Me die when you bid die, 
 master.' So I went and fetched a good dram of 
 rum, and gave him ; for I had been so good a husband 
 of my rum, that I had a great deal left. ^Vhen he 
 had drank it, I made him take the two fowling-pieces, 
 which we always carried, and load them with large 
 swan-shot, as big as small pistol-bullets. Then I took 
 four muskets, and loaded them with two slugs and five 
 small bullets each ; and my two pistols I loaded with 
 a brace of bullets each. 1 hung my great sword, as 
 usual, naked by my side, and gave Friday his hatchet 
 When I had thus prepared mysell, I took my 
 perspective-glass, and went up to the side of the hill 
 to see what I could discover ; and I found quickly, by 
 
 
 myglaM, that there were one and twenty uvaffes

 I* 
 
 
 occuionj much le« what necessitf, I was in to go and 
 dip my hands in blood, to attack people who had 
 neither done or inteudeid me any wrong; who, ai 
 to me, were innocent, and whose barbarous customs 
 were their own disaster ; being in them a token indeed 
 of God's having left them, with the other nations of 
 that part of the world, to such stupidity, and to such 
 inhuman courses ; but did not call me to take upon me 
 to be a judge of their actions, much less an executioner 
 of His justice; that whenever He thought fit. He 
 would take the cause into His own hands, and by 
 national vengeance, punish them, as a people, for 
 national crimes; but that, in the meantime, it was 
 none of my business ; that, it was true, Friday might 
 justify it, because he was a declared enemy, and in 
 a state of war with those very particular people, and 
 it was lawful for him to attack them ; but I could not 
 say the same with respect to me. These things were 
 so warmly pressed upon my thoughts all the way as I 
 went, that I resolveia I > >uld only go and place my- 
 self near them, that ] r ^^ht observe their Wbarous 
 feast, and that I woulr. ^t then as God should direct ; 
 but that, unless something o£Fered that was more a call 
 to me than yet I knew of, I would not meddle with 
 them. 
 
 With this resolution I entered the wood, and with 
 all possible wariness and silence, Friday following close 
 at my heels, I inarched till I came to the skirt of the 
 wood, on the side which was next to them ; only that 
 one corner of the wood lay between me and them. 
 Here I caUed softly to Friday, and showing him a 
 
 f-eat tree, which was just at the comer of the wood, 
 bade him go to the tree and bring me word if he 
 could see there plainly what they were doing. He 
 did so, and came immediately back to me, and told me 
 they might be plainly viewed there ; that they were all 
 about their fire, eating the ilesh of one of their prisoners, 
 and tiiat another lay bound upon the sand, a little from 
 them, which, he said, they would kill next ; and, which 
 fired all the very soul within me, he told me it was

 immediately know which way to run, or which way 
 to look, for thev knew n^ t from whence their destruc- 
 tion came. Friday kept his eyei close upon me, that, 
 n« r h  bid him, he might ohwrve what 1 did ; so 
 ^i- -.4 ,.i as the first shot was made I threw down 
 )' c p><>ce, and took up the fowling-piece, and Friday 
 'i'd the like. He sees me cock and preient ; he did 
 uie same again. 'Are you ready, Friday?' said 
 I. 'Yes,' says he. 'Let fly, then,' says I, 'in 
 the name of God!' and with that I fired again 
 among the amazed wretches, and so did Friday ; and 
 as our pieces were now loaded with what 1 •called 
 swan-shot, or small pistol-bullets, we found only two 
 drop, but so many were wounded, that they ran about 
 yelfing and screaming like mad creatures, all bloody, 
 and miserably wounded most of them ; whereof three 
 more fell quickly after, though not quite dead. 
 
 'Now, Fril. /,' says I, laying down the discharircd 
 
 ftieces, and taking up the musket which was yet 
 oaded, 'follow me,' says I, which he did with a 
 great deal of courage ; upon which I rushed out of 
 the wood, and showed myself, and Friday close at 
 my foot. As soon as 1 perceived they saw me, 1 
 shouted as loud as I could, md bade Friday do sf 
 too ; and running as fast as I could, which, by the 
 way, was not very fast, being load en with arms a<^ 
 I was, I made directly towards the poor victim, who 
 was, as I said, lying upon the beach, or shore, be- 
 tween the place where they sat and the sea. The 
 two butchers, who were just going to ork with him, 
 had left him at the surprise of our first fire, and fled 
 in a terrible fright to the seaside, and had jumped 
 into a canoe, and three more of the rest made the 
 sam3 way. I turned to Friday, and bid him step 
 forwards and fire at them. He understood me im 
 mediately, and running about forty ya-.is, to be near 
 them, he shot at them, and I toughi. he had killed 
 them all, for 1 saw them all iall of a heap into the 
 boat ; though I saw two of t) em up again quickly. 
 However, he killed two of them <nd wounded the

 loading these pieces, there happened a fierce engage- 
 ment between the Spaniard and one of the savages, 
 who made at him with one of their great wo(men 
 swords, the same weapon that was to have killed him 
 before if I had not prevented it. The Spaniard, who 
 was as bold and as brave as could be imagined, though 
 weak, had fought this Indian a good while, and had 
 cut him two great wounds on his head ; but the savage 
 being a stout, lusty fellow, closing in with him, had 
 thrown him down, being faint, and was wringing my 
 sword out of his hand, when the Spaniard, though 
 undermost, wisely quitting the sword, drew ihe pistol 
 from his girdle, shot the savage through the oody, 
 and killed him upon the spot, before I, who was 
 running to help him, could come near him. 
 
 Friday being now left to his liberty, pursued the 
 flying wretches with no weapon in his hand but his 
 hatchet; and with that he despatched those three 
 who, as I said before, were wounded at first, and 
 fallen, and all the rest he could come up with ; and 
 the Spaniard coming to me for a gun, I gave him one 
 of the fowling-pieces, with which he pursued two of 
 the savages, and wounded them both ; but as he was 
 not able to run, they both got from him into the 
 wood, where Friday pursued them, and killed one of 
 them ; but the other was too nimble for him, and 
 though he was wounded, vet had plunged himself into 
 the sea, and swam with all his might off to those two 
 who were left in the canoe ; which three in the canoe, 
 with one wounded, who we know not whether he died 
 or no, were all that escaped our hands of one and 
 twenty. The account of the rest is as follows : — 
 
 3 killed at our first shot from the tree. 
 
 2 killed at the next shot 
 
 2 killed by Friday in the hoat. 
 
 2 killed by ditto, of those at first wounded.

 what the matter was ; for he had not b^n ab Wo H

 haUoed, jumped about, danced, sung; ttiencried^Jn' 
 wrung his hand., beat his own fi«5e\Ld h^^^d^e^ 
 
 
 sung and jumped about again, like a distracted creature. 
 It was a good while before I could make him speak to 
 me, or tell me what was the matter; but wnen he 
 came a little to himself, he told me that it was his 
 father. 
 
 It is not easy for me to express how it moved me to 
 see what ecstasy and filial affection had worked in this 
 
 Soor savage at the sight of his father, and of his beinff 
 elivered from death ; nor, indeed, can I describe half 
 the extravagances of his affection after this ; for he 
 went into the boat, and out of the boat, a great many 
 times. When he went in to him. he would sit down 
 by him, open his breast, and hold his father's head 
 close to his bosom, half an hour together, to nourish 
 it; then he took his arms and ankles, which were 
 numbed and stiff with the binding, and chafed and 
 rubbed them with hiy hands ; and I, perceiving what 
 the case was, gave him some rum out of my bottle 
 to rub them with, which did them a great deal of 
 good. 
 
 This action put an end to Our pursuit of the canoe 
 with the other savages, who were now gotten almost 
 out of sight ; and it was happy for us that we did not, 
 for it blew so hard within two hours after, and before 
 they coi'<d be gotten a quarter of their way, and con- 
 tinued blowing so 'hard all night, and that from the 
 north-west, which was against them, that I could not 
 suppose their boat could live, or that they ever reached 
 to tneir own coast. 
 
 But to return to Friday. He was so busy about his 
 father, that I could not find in my heart to take him 
 off for some lime ; but after I thought he could leave 
 him a little, I called him to me, and he came jumping 
 and laughing, and pleased to the highest extreme. Then 
 I asked him if he nad given his father any bread. He 
 shook his head, and said, ' None ; uglv dog eat all up 
 self.' So I gave him a cake of bread out of a little 
 pouch I carried on purpose. I also gave him a dram 
 for himself, but he would not taste it, but carried it to 
 his father. I had in my pocket also two or three

 Friday to rub his ankles, and bathe them with rum, as 
 he had done his father's. 
 
 I observed the poor aflfectionate creature, every two 
 minutes, or perhaps less, all the while he was here, 
 turned his head about to see if his father was in the 
 same place and posture as he left him sitting ; and at 
 last he ftmnd he was not to be seen ; at which he 
 started up, and without speaking a word, flew with 
 that swiftness to him, that one could scarce perceive 
 his feet to touch the ground as he went But when he 
 came, he only found he had laid himself down to ease 
 his limbs ; so Friday came back to me presently, and 
 I then spoke to the Spaniard to let Friday help him 
 up, if he could, and lead him to the boat, and then he 
 should carry him to our dwelling, where I would take 
 care of him. But Friday, a lusty strong fellow, took 
 the Spaniard quite up upon his back, and carried him 
 away to the boat, and set him down softly upon the 
 side or gunnel of the canoe, with his feet in the inside 
 of it, and then lifted him quite in, and set him close 
 to his father ; and presently stepping out again, launched 
 the boat off, and paddled it along the shore faster than 
 I could walk, though the wind blew pretty hard too. 
 So he brought them both safe into our creek, and 
 leaving them in the boat, runs away to fetch the other 
 canoe. As he passed me, I spoke to him, and asked 
 him whither he went. He told me, 'Go fetch more 
 boat ' So away he went like the wind, for sure never 
 man or horse ran like him ; and he had the other 
 canoe in the creek almost as soon as I got to it by 
 land ; so he wafted me over, and then went to help 
 our new guests out of the boat, which he did ; but 
 they were neither of them able to walk, so that poor 
 Friday knew not what to do. 
 
 To remedy this I went to work in my thought, and 
 calling to Friday to bid them sit down on the bank 
 while he came to me, I soon made a kind of hand- 
 barrow to lay them on, and Friday and 1 carried them 
 up both together upon it between us. But when we 
 got them to the outside of our wall, or fortification, we

 possible to them to conceive that a man could dart 
 fire, and speak thunder, and kill at a distance with- 
 out lifting up the hand, as was done now. And 
 this old savage was in the right ; for, as I understood 
 since by other hands, the savages never attempted 
 to go over to the island afterwards. They were so 
 terrified with the accounts given by those four men 
 (for, it seems, they did escape the sea), that they 
 believed whoever went to that enchanted island would 
 be destroyed with fire from tlie gods. 
 
 This, however, I knew not, and therefore was under 
 continual apprehensions for a good while, and kept 
 always upon my guard, me and all my army ; for as 
 we were now four of us, I would have ventured upon 
 a hundred of them, feirly in the open field, at any time. 
 
 In a little time, however, no more canoes appearing, 
 the fear of their coming wore oflF, and I began to take 
 my former thoughts of a voyage to the main into con- 
 sideration ; being likewise assured, by Friday's father, 
 that I might depend upon good usage from their 
 nation, on his account, if I would go. 
 
 But my thoughts were a little suspended when I 
 had a serious discourse with the Spaniard, and when I 
 understood that there were sixteen more of his coiintry- 
 men and Portuguese, who, having been cast away, and 
 inade their escape to that side, lived there at peace, 
 indeed, with the savages, but were very sore put to 
 it for necessaries, and indeed for life. I asked him 
 all the particulars of their voyage, and found they 
 were a Spanish ship bound from the Rio de la Plata 
 to the Havana, being directed to leave their loading 
 there, which was chiefly hides and silver, and to bring 
 back what European goods they could meet with there; 
 that they had five Portuguese seamen on board, whom 
 they took out of another wreck ; that five of their 
 own men were drowned when the first ship was lost, 
 and that these escaped, through infinite dangers and 
 hazards, and arrived, almost starved, on the cannibal 
 coast, where they expected to have been devoured 
 every moment. 
 
 
 He told me they had some arms with them, hut 
 they were perfectly useless, for that they had neither 
 powder or ball, the washing of the sea having spoiled 
 all their powder but a litUe, which they used, at their 
 first landing, to provide themselves some food. 
 
 I asked him what he thought would become of tiiem 
 there, and if they had formed no design of making 
 any ^pe? He said they had many consultations 
 about it ; but that having neither vessel, or tools to 
 build one, or provisions of any kind, their councils 
 always ended in tears and despair. 
 
 1 asked him how he thought they would receive a 
 proposal from me, which might tend towards an 
 hacipe ; and whether, if they were aU here, it might 
 not be done? I told him with freedom, I feared 
 mostly their treachery and ill usage of me if I put my 
 Ufe in their hands ; for that gratitude was no inherent 
 virtue in the nature of man, nor did men always square 
 their dealings by the obligations they had received, so 
 much as they did by the advantages t^^y expected. I 
 told him it would be very hard that I should be the 
 instrument of their deliverance, and that they should 
 afterwards make me their prisoner in New bpain, 
 where an Englishman was certain to be made a sacri- 
 fice, what necessity or what accident soever brought 
 him thither ; and that I had rather be delivered up to 
 the savages, and be devoured alive, than fall into the 
 mercile^ claws of the priests, and be carried into the 
 Inquisition. I added, tW otherwise I was persuaded, 
 if they were all here, we rht, with so many hands, 
 build a bark large enough ..' carry us aU away, either 
 to the Brazils, southward, or to the islands, or Spanish 
 coast, northward ; but that if, in requital, they should, 
 when I had put weapons into their hands, carry me 
 by force among their own people, I might be Ul used 
 for my kindness to them, and make my case worse than 
 
 it was before. , , i. j „ j 
 
 He answered, with a great deal of candour and 
 
 Inirenuity, that their condition was so miserable, and 
 
 they were so sensible of it, that he believed they would 
 
 
 abhor the thought of using any man unkindly thai 
 hould contribute to their deliverance ; and that, if I 
 pleased, he would go to them with the old man, and 
 discourse with them about it, and return again, and 
 bring me their answer ; that he would make conditions 
 with them upon their solemn oath that they should 
 be absolutely under my leading, as their commander 
 and captain ; and that they should swear upon the 
 holy sacraments and the gospel to be true to me, and 
 to go to such Christian country as that I should 
 agree to, and no other, and to be directed wholly 
 and absolutely by my orders till they were landed 
 safely in such country as I intended ; and that he 
 would bring a contract from them, under their hands, 
 for that purpose. 
 
 Then he told me he would first swear to me himself, 
 that he would never stir from me as long as he lived 
 till ; gave him orders ; and that he would take my 
 side to the last drop of his blood, if there should 
 happta the least breach of faith among his country- 
 men. ^ 
 
 He told me they were all of them very civil, honest 
 men, and they were under the greatest distress imagin- 
 able, having neither weapons or clothes, or any food, 
 but at the mercy and discretion of the savages ; out of 
 all hopes of ever returning to their own country ; and 
 that he was sure, if I would undertake their relief, 
 they would live and die by me. 
 
 Upon these assurances, I resolved to venture to 
 relieve them, if possible, and to send the old savage 
 and this Spaniard over to them to treat But when 
 we had gotten all things in a readiness to go, the 
 Spaniard himself started an objection, which had so 
 much prudence m it on one hand, and so much 
 sincerity on the other hand, that I could not but be 
 very well satisfied in it, and by his advice put oflF the 
 deliverance of his comrades for at least half a year. 
 The case was thus. 
 
 He had been with us now about a month, during 
 which time I had let him see m what manner I had 
 
 
 provided, with the MBirtance of Providence, for my 
 upport ; and he saw evidently what rtock of com and 
 rice 1 had laid up ; which, at it was more than sufficient 
 for mytelf, lo it was not sufficient, at least without 
 good husbandry, for my fiimily, now it was incraased 
 to number four ; but much less would it be sufficient 
 if his countrymen, who were, as he said, fourteen, still 
 alive, should come over ; and least of alT would it be 
 sufficient to victual our vessel, if we should build one, 
 for a voyaire to any of the Christian colonies of America. 
 So he told me he thought it would be more advisable 
 to let him and the two others dig and cultivate some 
 more land, as much as I could spare seed to sow ; and 
 that we should wait another harvest, that we might 
 have a supply of com for his countrymen when they 
 should come ; for want might be a temptation to them 
 to disagree, or not to think themselves delivered, other- 
 wise than out of one difficulty into another. *You 
 know,' says he, *the children of Israel, though they 
 rejoiced at first for their being delivered out of Egypt, 
 yet rebelled even against God Himself, that delivered 
 them, when they came to want bread in the wilderness. 
 His caution was so seasonable, and his advice so 
 good, that I could not but be very well pleased with 
 his proposal, as well as I was satisfied with his fidebty. 
 So we fell to digging all four of us, as weU as the 
 wooden tools we were furnished with permitted ; and 
 in about a month's time, by the end of which it was 
 seed-time, we had gotten as much land cured and 
 trimmed up as we sowed twenty-two bushels of barley 
 on, and sixteen jars of rice ; which was, in short, all 
 the seed we had to spare ; nor, indeed, did we leave 
 ourselves barley sufficient for our own food for the six 
 months that we had to expect our crop ; that is to say, 
 reckoning from the time we set our seed aside for 
 sowing ; for it is not to be supposed it is six months m 
 the ground in that country, . 
 
 Having now society enough, and our number being 
 sufficient to put us out of fear of the savages, if they 
 had come, unless their number had been very great, we 
 
 
 wnt freely all over the isUnd, wherever we found 
 occawon ; and m here we had our escape or deUver- 
 ance upon our thoughts, it was imposaibli; at least for 
 me, to have the means of it out of mine. To this 
 purooae I marked out several trees which I tliuutfht 
 fit for our work, and 1 set Friday and hii fether to cut- 
 ting them down ; and then I caused the Spaniard, to 
 whom I imparted my thought on that aflair, to ove^ee 
 
 tadefotigBble pains I had hewed a large tree into single 
 pLmks, and I caused them to do the like, tiU they £ui 
 
 feet broad thirt^-five feet long, and from two inches 
 to four inches thick. What prodigious kbour it took 
 up, any one may imagine. 
 
 At the same time, I contrived to increase my UtUe 
 flock of tame goats as much as I could ; and to this 
 purpose I made Friday and the Spaniard go out one 
 day, and myself w.th iMday the neVt day. For we took 
 our turns, and by this means we got above twenty 
 young kids to breed up with the r^t; for wheneveV 
 we shot the dam, we saved the kids, and added them 
 to our flock. But above all, the season for curing the 
 graws coming on, I caused such a prodigious quantity 
 to be hung up m the sun, that I bllieveT had we been 
 at AJiMnt, where the raisins of the sun are cured, we 
 wuld have filled sixty or eighty barrels ; and these, 
 m^ our bread, was a great part of our food, and ver^ 
 
 TurisMng^f^": ' ""^^ ^°" • '°' " ^« - «-««*^'2 
 
 It was now harvest, and our crop in good order. It 
 
 was not the most plentiful increase I had seen in the 
 
 island, but, however, it was enough to answer our end- 
 
 f;f .^°l»?"\*^*°*y"*^,° ^"^^'^^ «^ »>"l«y ^e brought 
 m and thrashed out above two hundred and twenty

 was store enough for our food to the next harveS^ 
 
 with me ; or if we had been ready for a voya«s it 
 would very plentifiiUy have victuaUed our ship^toSiv. 
 
 'H 
 
 
 euried ui to any part of the world, that i» to say, of 
 America. 
 
 When we had thus housed and secured our magazine 
 of corn, we fell to work to make more wicker-work, 
 viz., great baskets, in which we kept it; and the 
 Spaniard was very handy and dexterous at this part, 
 and often blamed me that I did not make some things for 
 defence of this kind of work ; but I saw no need of it. 
 
 And now having a full supply of food for all the 
 guests I expected, 1 gave the Spaniard leave to go over 
 to the main, to see what he could do with those he had 
 left behind him there. I gave him a strict charj;:e in 
 writing not to bring any man with him who would not 
 first swear, in the presence of himself and of the old 
 savage, that he would no way injure, fight v»ith, or 
 attack the person he should find in the island, whu was 
 so kind to send for them in order to their deliverance ; 
 but that they would stand by and defend him a^inst 
 all such attempts, and wherever they went would be 
 entirely under and subjected to his commands; and 
 thai this should be put in writing, and signed with 
 their hands. How we were to have this done, when 
 I knew they had neither pen or ink, that indeed was 
 a question which we never asked. 
 
 Under these instructions, the Spaniard and the old 
 savage, the father of Friday, went away in one of the 
 canoes which they might be said to come in, or rather 
 were brought in, when they came as prisoners to be 
 devoured by the savages. 
 
 I gave each of them a musket, with a firelock on i , 
 and about eight charges of powder and ball, chargi ^r 
 them to be very good husbands of both, and not to u ^  
 either of them but upon urgent occasion. 
 
 This was a cheerful work, being the first measures 
 used by me, in view of my deliverance, for now twenty- 
 seven years and some days. I gave them provisions 
 of bread and of dried grapes sufficient for themselves 
 for many days, and sufficient for all their countrymen 
 for about eight days' time ; and wishing them a good 
 voyage, I see them go, agreeing with them about a 
 
 
 •Ignal th«v should hang out at their return, by which 
 I jboiiid know them again, when they came hack, at 
 a distance, befor(> they came on shore. 
 
 They went away with a fair gale on the day that 
 the moon wfts at lull, by m account in the month of 
 October ; but a for an exact reckoning of davs, after 
 I had once lost it, I could never recover it again ; nor 
 had 1 kept even the rsumber ,f years so punctually as 
 to be sure that I was right, tJ.ough as it proved, when 
 1 atterw.uil^ ax-imnf^d my account, I found I hau kept 
 a true ret-kuriiiiji of > im-s. 
 
 It was no k^s tliaii ei,-ht days I had waited for 
 them, when a str; ui^re and unforeseen accident inter- 
 vened, of which the likft h;is not perhaps been heard of 
 in history. I was fast asleep in my hutch one morn- 
 ing, when my man Friday came running in to me, and 
 caUed aloud, 'Master, master, they are come, thev 
 are come ! ' ' 
 
 I jun»ped up, and, regardless of danger, I went fu 
 as soon as I could get my clothes on, through m . te 
 grove, winch, \,y the way, was by this time gr-.v^ » 
 be a very thick wood ; I say, regardless of danior. I 
 went without my arms, which was not my custom to 
 do ; but I was surprised when, turning my eyes to the 
 sea, I presenUy saw a boat at about a league and 
 half 8 distance standing in for the shore, with a 
 8houIder-of-mutton sail, as they call it, and the wind 
 Wowing pretty fair to bring *hem in ; also 1 observed 
 presently that they did not come from that side which 
 the shore lay on, but from the southernmost end of the 
 island. Upon this I oaUed Friday in, and bid him lie 
 close, for these were i,ot the people we looked for, and 
 that we might not kn-.vr yet whether they were friends 
 or enemies. 
 
 In the next place, I went in to fetch my perspective- 
 glass, to see what I could make of them ; and havimr 
 taken the ladder out, I climbed up to the top of the 
 iiili, a-, i used to do when I was apprehensive of «iiny. 
 thin^r, xm to take my view the plainer, without being 
 
 
 2fi2 ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 
 
 I had scarce set my foot on the hill, when my eye 
 plainly discovered a ship lying at an anchor at ahout 
 two leagues and a half s distance from me, south- 
 south-east, but not above a league and a half from the 
 shore. By my observation, it appeared plainly to be 
 an English ship, and the boat appeared to be an 
 English longboat. , , i. *i. 
 
 1 cannot express the confusion I was in ; though tha 
 joy of seeing a ship, and one who I had reamn to 
 believe was manned by my own countrymen, and con- 
 sequently friends, was such as 1 cannot describe. But 
 yet I had some secret doubts hung about me, I cannot 
 tell from whence they came, bidding me keep upon my 
 guard. In the first place, it occurred to me to consider 
 what business an English ship could have in that part 
 of the world, since it was not the way to or from any 
 part of the world where the English had any traffic ; 
 and I knew there had been no storms to drive them in 
 there as in distress ; and that if they were Eughsh 
 really, it vras most probable that they were here upon 
 no good design ; and that I had better continue as i 
 was, than fall into the hands of thieves and murderers. 
 
 Let uo man despise the secret hints and notices of 
 danger which sometimes are given him when he may 
 think there is no possibUity of its being real That 
 such hints and notices are given us, I believe few that 
 have made any observations of things can deny ; that 
 they are certain discoveries of an invisible world, and 
 a converse of spirits, we cannot doubt ; and if the ten- 
 dency of them seems to be to warn us of danger, why 
 should we not suppose they are fron. some friendly 
 agent, whether supreme, or inferior and subordinate, 
 is not the question, and that they are given for our 
 
 The present question abundantly confirms me in the 
 justice of this reasoning ; for had I not been made 
 cautious by this secret admonition, come it from whence 
 it will, I had been undone inevitably, and in a far 
 worse condition than before, as you will see presently. 
 
 I had not kept myself long in this posture, but I saw 
 
 
 the boat draw near the shore, a« if they looked for a 
 creek to thrust m at, for the convenience of landinir 
 However, «" tibey did not come quite fer enough, thJy 
 did not see the Uttle inlet where I formerly knded 
 ™/ ^ I ^r* '•"".*^e»' ^<»t on shore upon the beach, 
 at about half a mUe from me, which was very happy 
 for me ; for otherwise they would have landed just as 
 1 may say, at my door, and would soon have beaten me 
 I had °*^ ' perhaps have plundered me of aU 
 
 When they were on shore, I was fully saUsfied that 
 they were Englishmen, at least most of them ; one or 
 two 1 thought were Dutch, but it did not prove so. 
 Ihere were m aU eleven men, whereof three of them I 
 found were unarmed, and as I thought, bound ; and when 
 the ftrst four or five of them were jumped on shore. 
 
 One of the three I could perceive using the most pas- 
 rri^ ^tures of entreaty, affliction, and des^ 
 eveb to a kmd of extravagance ; the other two, I <Wd

 All this while I had no thought of what the matter 
 really wm, but stood trembling with the horror of 
 tae sight, expecting every moment when the three 
 l\7f?'»«7.1^»y.be kiUed ; nay, once I saw one of the 
 illains lift up his arm with a great cutlass, as the sea- 
 men caU ,t, or sword, to strike one of the poor menTJ

 I wished heartUy now for mv Spaniard, and the savage 
 that was gone with him ; or that I had any way to have 
 come undiscovered within shot of them, that I might 
 have rescued the three men, for I saw no firearms they 
 had among them ; hut it fell out to my mmd another way . 
 After 1 had ohserved the outrageous usage ot the 
 three men hv the insolent seamen, 1 observed the 
 feUows run scattering about the land, as if they wanted 
 to see the country. I observed that the three other men 
 had liberty to go also where they pleased ; but they sat 
 down all three upon the ground, very pensive, and 
 looked like men in despair. 
 
 This put me in mind of the first time when I came on 
 shore, and began to look about me ; how 1 gave myself 
 over for lost; how wildly I looked round me ; what 
 dreadful apprehensions I had ; and how I lodged in the 
 tree aU niglit, for fear of being devoured by wild lieaste. 
 As I knew nothing that night of the supply I was to 
 receive by the providential driving of the ship nearer 
 the land by the storms and tide, by which 1 have since 
 been so long nourished and supported ; so these three 
 poor desolate men knew nothing how certain ot 
 deliverance and supply they were, how near it was to 
 them, and how effectually and really they were in a 
 condition of safety, at the same time that they thought 
 themselves lost, and their case desperate. 
 
 So little do we see before us in the world, and so 
 much reason have we to depend cheerfully upon ttie 
 irreat Maker of the world, that He does not leave His 
 creatures so absolutely destitute, but that, in the worst 
 circumstances, they have always something to be 
 thankful for, and sometimes are nearer their deliver- 
 ance than they imagine ; nay, are even brought to their 
 deliverance by the means by which they seem to be 
 brought to their destruction. , o 
 
 It was just at the top of high -water when these 
 people came on shore; and while partly they stood 
 mrfeying with the prisoners they brought, and partly 
 while they rambled about to see what kind of a place 
 they were in, they had carelessly stayed tiU the tide 
 
 
 They had left two men in the boat, who as I founrf

 were all gone rtraggling into the woods, and, as I 
 thought, were laid down to sleep. The three poor 
 distressed men, too anxious for their condition to get 
 any sleep, were, however, set down under the shelter 
 of a great tree, at ahout a quarter of a mile from me, 
 and, as I thought, out of sight of any of the rest 
 
 Upon this I resolved to discover myself to them, and 
 learn something of their condition. Immediately I 
 manned in the ifure as above, my man Friday at a 
 goti distance Wliind ma. as formidable for his arms as 
 I, but wrt mabng quito m staring a spectre-like figure 
 
 I came as near them undiscovered as I could, and 
 then, before any of them saw me, I called aloud to 
 them iu Spanish, ' What are ye, gentlemen? 
 
 They started up at the noise, bet were ten timM 
 more confounded when they saw me, and the uncouth 
 fiirure that I made. They made no answer at all, but 
 I thought I perceived them just goin« to fly from me, 
 when I spoke to them in EagUsh. * Gentlemen, said 
 I, ' d» not be surprised at ma ; perhaps you may have 
 a friend near you, when ii« did not expect it. He 
 must be sent direcUy from heaven then," said one of 
 them very gravely to me, and pulling oflF his hat at the 
 gune time to me, ' for our condition is past the help ot 
 man.' 'All help is from heaven, sir,' said I. But 
 can you put a stranger in the way how to help you, for 
 you seem to me to be in ^me great distress ? I saw you 
 wken you landed ; and when you seemed to make 
 applications to the brutes that came with you, I saw 
 one of them litt i^ his sword to kill you.' 
 
 The poor man, with tears running down his face, 
 and trembling, looking like ooe astoniahed, returned, 
 • Am I talking to God, or man ? Is it a real man, or 
 an angel ? ' ' Be in no fear about that, sir, said 1. It 
 God had sent an angel to relieve you, he would have 
 come better clothed, and armed after another manner 
 than you •• me m. Pray Uy aside yimr fears ; 1 am

 * Well/ says I, * my conditions are but two. 1. 
 That while you stay on this island with me, you will 
 not pretend to any authority here ; and if I put arms 
 into your hands, you will, upon all occasions, give them 
 up to me, and do no prejudice to me or mine upon this 
 island ; and in the meantime, be governed by my 
 orders. 2. That if the ship, is, or may be, recovered, 
 you will carry me and my man to England, passage 
 free.' 
 
 He gave me all the assurances that the invention and 
 faith of man could devise that he would comply with 
 these most reasonable demands ; and, besides, would 
 owe his life to me, and acknowledge it upon all occa- 
 sions, as long as he lived. 
 
 * Well then,' said I, * here are three muskets for you, 
 with powder and ball ; tell me next what you think is 
 proper to be done.' He showed all the testimony of 
 his gratitude that he was able, but offered to be wholly 
 guided by me. 1 told him I thought it was hard 
 venturing aiiHhing ; but the best method I could think 
 of was to fire upon them at once, as they lay ; and if 
 any was not killed at the first volley, and oflfered to 
 submit, we might save them, and so put it wholly upon 
 God's providence to direct the shot. 
 
 He said very modestly that he was loth to kill them, 
 if he could help it ; biit that those two were incor- 
 rigible villains, and had been the authors of all the 
 mutiny in the ship, and if they escaped, we should be 
 undone still ; for they would go on board and brinir 
 the whole ship's company, and destroy us all. ' Well 
 then,' says I, * necessity legitimates my advice, for it 
 is the only way to save our lives.' However, seeing 
 him still cautious of shedding blood, I told him they 
 should go themselves, and manage as they §o\iud con- 
 venient. 
 
 In the middle of this discourse we heard some ot 
 them awake, and soon after we saw two of them on 
 their feet. I asked him if either of them were of the 
 men who he had said were the heads of the mutinv ? 
 He said, *No.' 'Well then,' said I, *you may let

 It now remained that the captain and I should in- 
 quire into one another's circumstances. I began first, 
 and told him my whole history, which he heard with 
 an attention even to amazement ; and particularly at 
 the wonderful manner of my being furnished with 
 provisions and ammunition ; and, indeed, as my story 
 is a whole collection of wonders, it affected him deeply. 
 But when he reflected from thence upon himself, and 
 how I seemed to have been preserved there on purpose 
 to save his life, the tears ran down his face, and he 
 could not speak a word more. 
 
 After this communication was at an end, I carried 
 him and his two men into my apartment, leading them 
 in just where I came out, viz., at the top of the house, 
 where I refreshed them with such provisions as I had, 
 and showed them all the contrivances I had made 
 during my long, long inhabiting that place. 
 
 All I showed them, all I said to them, was perfectly 
 amazing ; but above all, the captain admired my forti- 
 fication, and how perfectly I had concealed my retreat 
 with a grove of trees, which , having been now planted 
 near twenty years, and the trees growing much faster 
 than in England, was become a little wood, and so 
 thick, that it was unpassable in any part of it but at 
 that one side where I had reserved my little winding 
 passage into it. I told him this was my castle and my 
 residence, but that I had a seat in the country, as 
 most princes have, whither I could retreat upon occa- 
 sion, and I would show him that too another time ; hut 
 at present, our business was to consider how to recover 
 the ship. He agreed with me as to that, but told me 
 he was perfectly at a loss what measures to take, for 
 that there were still six and twenty hands on bwird, 
 who having entered into a cursed conspiracy, by whuh 
 they had all forfeited their lives to the law, would \>e 
 hardened in it now by desperation, and would carry 
 it on, knowing that if they were reduced, they should 
 
 
 be brought to the galJows as soon as tliey came to 
 England, or to any of the English colonies ; and tha? 
 therefore there would be no attacking them witl so 
 small a number as we were.

 Hliile we were thui preparing our designs, and had 
 first, by main strength, heaved the boat up upon the 
 beach ^o liigh that the tide would not fleet her off at 
 high-water mark ; and besides, had broke a hole in her 
 bottom too big to be quickly stopped, and were sat 
 down musing what we should do, we heard the ship 
 fire a ^un, and saw her make a waft with her ancient 
 as a signal for the boat to come on board. But no boat 
 stirred ; and they fired several times, making other 
 signals for the boat 
 
 At last, when all their signals and firings proved 
 fruitless, and thev found the l)oat did not stir, we saw 
 them, by the help of my glasses, hoist another boat 
 out, and row towards the shore ; and we found, as they 
 approached, that there was no less than ten men in 
 her, and that they had firearms with them. 
 
 As the ship lay almost two leagues from the shore, 
 we had a full view of them as they came, and a plain 
 sight of the men, even of their faces ; because the tide 
 having set them a little to the east of the other boat, 
 they rowed up under shore, to come to the same place 
 where the other had landed, and where the boat lay. 
 
 By this means, I say, we had a full view of them, 
 and the captain knew the persons and characters of all 
 the men in the boat, of whom he sai() that there were 
 three very honest fellows, who, he was sure, were led 
 into this conspiracy by the rest, being overpowered and 
 frighted ; but that as for the boatswain, who, it seems, 
 was the chief officer among them, and all the rest, 
 they were as outrageous as any of the ship's crew, and 
 were no doubt made desperate in their new enterprise ; 
 and terribly apprehensive he was that they would be 
 too powerful for us. 
 
 I smiled at him, had told him that men in our cir- 
 cumstances were: past the operation of fear ; that seeing 
 almost every condition that could be was better than 
 that which we were supposed to be in, we ought to 
 expect that the consequence, whether death or life, 
 would be sure to be a deliverance. I asked him what 
 he thought of the circumstances of my life, and whether

 and upon their solemnly engag'ing to live and die with 
 us ; so with them and the three honest men we were 
 seven men well armed ; and I made no douht we should 
 he able to deal well enough with the ten that were 
 a-coming, considering that the captain had said there 
 were three or four honest men among them also. 
 
 As soon as they got to the place where their other 
 boat lay, they rail their boat into the beach, and came 
 all on shore, hauling the boat up after them, which I 
 was glad to see ; for I was afraid they would rather 
 have left the boat at an anchor some distance fi-om the 
 shore, with some hands in her to guard her, and so we 
 should not be able to seize the boat. 
 
 Being on shore, the first thing they did they ran all 
 to their other boat ; and it was easy to see that they 
 were under a great surprise to find her stripped, as 
 above, of all that was in her, and a great hole in her 
 bottom. 
 
 After they had mused a while upon this, they set up 
 two or three great shouts, hallooing with all their 
 might, to try if they could make their companions 
 hear ; but all was to no purpose. Tlien they came all 
 close in a ring, and fired a volley of their small arms, 
 which, indeed, we heard, and the echoes made the 
 woods ring. But it was all one ; those in the cave we 
 were surf could not hear, and those la our keeping, 
 though they heard it well enough, yet durst give no 
 answer to them. 
 
 They were so astonished at the surprise of this, that, 
 as they told us afterwards, they resolved to go all on 
 board again, to their ship, and let them know there 
 that the men were all murdered, and the longboat 
 staved. Accordingly, they immediately launched their 
 boat again, and gat all of them on board. 
 
 The captair was terribly amazed, and even con- 
 founded at tLis, believing they would go on board the 
 ship again, and set sail, giving their comrades for lost, 
 and so he should still lose the ship, which he was in 
 hopes we should have recovered ; but he was quickly 
 as much frighted the other way.

 i^ould all fire a volley a^in, to endeavour to make 
 their fellows hear, and that we should all sally upon 
 them, just at the juncture when their pieces were all 
 discharged, and they would certainly yield, and we 
 should have them without bloodshed. I liked the 
 proposal, provided it was done while we were near 
 enough to come up to them before they could load 
 their pieces again. 
 
 But this event did not happen, and we lay still a 
 long time, very irresolute what course to take. At 
 length I told them there would be nothing lo be done, 
 in my opinion, till night ; and then, if they did not 
 return to the boat, perhaps we might find a way to get 
 between them and the shore, and so might use some 
 stratagem with them in the boat to get them on shore. 
 
 We waited a great while, though very impatient for 
 their removing; and were very uneasy when, after 
 long consultations, we saw them start all up, and march 
 down toward the sea. It setims they had such dread- 
 ful apprehensions upon them of the danger of the 
 place, that they resolved to go on board the ship again, 
 give their companions over for lost, and so go on with 
 their intended voyage with the ship. 
 
 As soon as I perceived them go towards the shore, 
 I imagined it to be, as it really was, that they had 
 given over their search, and were for going back again ; 
 and the captain, as soon as 1 told him my thoughts, 
 was ready to sink at the apprehensions of it ; but 1 
 presently thought of a stratagem to fetch them back 
 again, and which answered my end to a tittle. 
 
 I ordered Friday and the captain's mate to go over 
 the little creek westward, towards the place where the 
 savages came on shore when Friday was rescued, and 
 as soon as they came to a little rising ground, at about 
 half a mile distance, I bade them halloo as loud as 
 they could, and wait till they found the seamen heard

 heartily tired tliemselves also by the time they came 
 back to us. 
 
 We had nothing now to do but to watch for them 
 in the dark, and to fall upon them, so as to make sure 
 work with them. 
 
 It was several hours after Friday came back to me 
 before they came back to their boat; and we could hear 
 the foremost of them, long before they came quite up, 
 calling to those behind to come along, and could also 
 hear them answer and complain how lame and tired 
 they were, and not able to come any faster ; which was 
 very welcome news to us. 
 
 At length they came up to the boat ; but 'tis im- 
 possible to express their confusion when they found 
 the boat fast aground in the creek, the tide ebbed 
 out, and their two men gone. VVe could hear them 
 call to one another in a most lamentable manner, 
 telling one another they were gotten into an enchanted 
 island ; that either there were inhabitants in it, and 
 they should all be murdered, or else there were devils 
 and spirits in it, and they should be all carried away 
 and devoured. 
 
 They hallooed again, ad called their two comrades 
 by their names a great many times ; but no answer. 
 After some time we could see them, by the little light 
 there was, run about, wringing their hands like men 
 in despair, and that sometimes they would go and sit 
 down in the boat to rest themselves ; then come ashore 
 again, and walk about again, and so the same thing 
 over again. 
 
 My men would fain have me give them leave to fall 
 upon them at once in the dark ; but I was willing to 
 take them at some advantage, so to spare them, and 
 kill as few of them as I could ; and especially I was 
 unwilling to hazard the killing any of our own men, 
 knowing the other were very well armed. I resolved 
 to wait, to see if they did not separate ; and, therefore, 
 to make sure of them, 1 drew my ambuscade nearer, 
 and ordered Friday and the captain to creep upon 
 thei' hands and feet, as close to the ground as they

 not yield, you are all lost.' 
 
 * VTill they ^ve us quarter then/ says Tom Smith, 
 * and we will yield ? ' 'I'll go and ask, if you promise 
 to yield,' says Robinson. So he asked the captain, 
 and the captain then calls himself out, * You, Smith, 
 you know my voice, if you lav down your arms immedi- 
 ately, and submit, you shall have your lives, all but 
 Will Atkins.' 
 
 Upon this Will Atkins cried out, * For God's sake, 
 captain, give me quarter; what have I done? They 
 have been all as bad as I ' ; which, by the way, was 
 not true neither ; for, it seems, this Will Atkins was 
 the first man that laid hold of the captain when they 
 first mutinied, and used him barbarously, in tying 
 his hands, and giving him injurious language. How- 
 ever, the captain told him he must lay down his arms 
 at discretion, and trust to the governor's mercy ; by 
 which he n-3ant me, for they all called me governor. 
 
 In a word, they all laid down their arms, and begged 
 their lives; and I sent the man that had parleyed 
 with them and two more, who bound them all; and 
 then my great army of fifty men, which, particularly 
 with those three, were all but eight, came up and 
 seized upon them all, and upon their boat ; only that 
 1 kept myself and one more out of sight for reasons 
 of state. 
 
 Our next work was to repair the boat, and think of 
 seizing the ship ; and as for the captain, now he had 
 leisure to parley with them, he expostulated with them 
 upon the villainy of their practices with him, and at 
 length upon the farther wickedness of their design, 
 and how certainly it must bring them to misery and 
 .distress in the ena, and perhaps to the gallows. 
 
 They all appeared very penitent, and begged hard 
 for their lives. As for that, he told them they were 
 none of his prisoners, but the commander of the 
 island ; that they thought they ha** set him on shore 
 in a barren, uninhabited island ; ) 'it it had pleased

 and u it was fenced in, and they pinioned, the place 
 was secure enough, considering they were upou their 
 behaviour. 
 
 To these in the morning I sent the captain, who 
 was to enter into a parley with them ; iu a word, to try 
 them, and tell me whether he thought they might be 
 trusted or no to go on board and surprise the ship. 
 He talked to them of the injury done him, of the 
 condition they were brought to ; and that though the 
 governor had given them Quarter for their live:* as to 
 the present action, yet that if they were sent to England 
 they would all be iianged in chains, to be sure ; but 
 Uiat if they would join in so just an attempt as to 
 recover the ship, he wc Id have the governor's engage- 
 ment for their pardon. 
 
 Any one may guess how readily such a proposal 
 woula be accepted by men in their condition. They 
 fell down on their knees to the captain, and promised, 
 with the deepest imprecations, toat they would be 
 faithful to him to the last drop, and that they should 
 owe their lives to him, and would go with him all 
 over the world ; that they would own him for a father 
 to them as long as they lived. 
 
 'Well,' says the captain, 'I must go and tell, the 
 governor what you say, and see what I can do to bring 
 him to consent to it.' So he brought me an account of 
 the temper he found them in, and that he verily 
 believed they would be faithful. 
 
 However, that we might be very secure, I told him 
 he should go back again and choose out live of them^ 
 and tell them they might see that he did not want 
 men, that he would take out those five to be his 
 assistants, and that the governor would keep the other 
 two and the three that were sent prisoners to the castle, 
 my cave, as hostages for the fidelity of those five ; 
 and that if they proved unfaithful in the execution, 
 the five hostages should he hanged in chains alive upou 
 the shore. 
 
 This looked severe, and convinced them that the 
 governor was in earnest However, they had no way

 he made Robinwn hail them, and tell them they had 
 brought off the men and the boat, but that it was a long 
 time before they had found them, and the like, holding 
 them in a chat till they came to the ship's side ; when 
 the captain and the mate entering first, with their 
 arms, immediately knocked down the second mate and 
 carpenter with tne butt-end of their muskets, being 
 very faithfully seconded by their men. They secured 
 all the rest that were upon the main and quarter-decks, 
 and began to fasten tne hat hes to keep them down 
 who were below ; when the other boat and their men 
 entering at the forechains, secured the forecastle of the 
 ship, and the scuttle which went down into the cook- 
 room, aking three men they found there prisoners. 
 
 When this was done, and all safe upon deck, the 
 captain ordered the mate, with three men, to break into 
 the round-house, wliere the new rebel captain lay, and 
 having taken the alarm was gotten up, and witn two 
 men and a boy had gotten firearms in their hands ; 
 and when the mate with a crow split open the door, the 
 new captain and his men fired boldly among them, and 
 wounded the mate with a musket-bsul, whicii broke his 
 arm, and wounded two more of the men, but killed 
 nobody. 
 
 The mate calling for help, rushed however into the 
 round-house wounded as ne was, and with his pistol 
 shot the new captain through the head, the bullet 
 entering at his mouth and came out again behind one 
 of his ears, so that he never spoke a word ; upon which 
 the rest yielded, and the ship was taken effectually, 
 without any more lives lost. 
 
 As soon as the ship wp' ''bus secured, the captain 
 ordered seven guns t'< be .ireil, which was the signal 
 agreed upon with me to give me notice of his success, 
 which you may be sure I was very glad to hear, having 
 sat witching upon the shore for it till near two of the 
 clock in the morning. 
 
 Having thus heard the signal plainly, I laid me 
 down ; and it having been a day of great fatigue to me, 
 I slept very sound, till J was something surprised with the

 testimonies we had of a secret hand of Providence 
 governing the world, and an evidence that the eyes of 
 an infinite Power could search into the remot^'st corner 
 of the world, and send help to the miserable whenever 
 He pleased. 
 
 I forgot not to lift up my heart in thankfulness to 
 heaven ; and what heart could forbear to bless Him, 
 who had not only in a miraculous manner provided for 
 one in such a wilderness, and in such a desolate condi- 
 tion, but from whom every deliverance must always be 
 acknowledged to proceed r 
 
 When we had talked a while, the captain told me he 
 had brought me some little refreshment, such as the 
 ship afforded, and such as the wretches that had been 
 so long his masters had not plundered him of. Upon 
 this he called aloud to the boat, and bid his men bring 
 the things ashore that were for the governor ; and, 
 indeed, it was a present as if I had been one, not that 
 was to be carried away along with them, but as if I had 
 been to dwell upon tne island still, and thuy were to 
 go without me. 
 
 First, he had brought me a case of bottles full of 
 excellent cordial waters, six large bottles of Madeira 
 wine (the bottles held two quarts apiece), two pounds 
 of excellent good tobacco, twelve good pieces of the ship's 
 beef, and six pieces of pork, with a oag of peas, and 
 about a hundredweight of biscuit. 
 
 He brought me also a box of sugar, a box of flour, a 
 bag full of lemons, and two bottles of lime-juice, and 
 abundance of other things ; but besides these, and 
 what was a thousand times more useful to me, he 
 brought me six clean new shirts, six very good neck- 
 cloths, two pair of gloves, one pair of shoes, a hat, 
 and one pair of stockings, and a very good suit of 
 clothes 01 his own, which had lieen worn but very 
 little ; in a word, he clothed me from head to 
 foot. 
 
 It was a very kind and agreeable present, as any one 
 may imagine, to one in my circumstances ; but never 
 was anything in the world of that kind so unpleasant,

 see him hanging at the yard-arm ; that as to them^ I 
 vranted to know what they had to say why I should 
 not execute them as pirates, taken in the &LCt, as hy 
 my commission they could not doubt I had authority 
 to do. 
 
 One of them answered in the name of the rest that 
 they had nothing to say but this, that when they were 
 taken the captain promised them their lives, and they 
 humbly implored my mercy. But I told them I knew 
 not what mercy to show them ; for as for myself, I had 
 resolved to quit the island with all my men, and had 
 taken passage with the captain to go for England. And 
 as for the captain, he could not carry them to England 
 other than as prisoners in irons, to be tried for mutiny, 
 and running away with the ship ; the consequence of 
 which, they must needs know, would be the gallows ; 
 so that I could not tell which was best for them, unless 
 they had a mind to take their fate in the island. If 
 they desired that, I did not care, as I had liberty to 
 leave it. I had some inclination to give them tneir 
 lives, if they thought they could shift on shore. 
 
 They seemed very thankful for it, said they would 
 much rather venture to stay there than to be carried 
 to England to be hanged ; so I left it on that 
 issue. 
 
 However, the captain seemed to make some difRculty 
 of it, as if he durst not leave them there. Upon this I 
 seemed a little angry with the captain, and told him 
 that they were my prisoners, not his ; and that seeing 
 I had offered them so much favour, I would be as good 
 as my word ; and that if he did not think fit to con- 
 sent to it, I would set them at liberty, as I found then ; 
 and if he did not like it, he might take them again if 
 he could catch them. 
 
 Upon this they appeared very thankful, and I 
 accordingly set them at liberty, and bade them retire 
 into the woods to the place whence they came, and I 
 would leave them some firearms, some ammunition, 
 and some directions how they should live very well, if 
 they thought fit

 and increase them. 
 
 Having done all this, I left them the next day, and 
 went on board the ship. Wo prepared immediately to 
 sail, but did not weigh that night The next morning 
 early two of the five men came swimming to the ship's 
 side, and making a most lamentable complaint of the 
 other three, begged to be taken into the ship for God's 
 sake, for they should be murdered, and begged the 
 captain to take them on board, though he hanged them 
 immediately. 
 
 Upon this the captain pretended to have no power 
 without me ; but after some difficulty, and after their 
 solemn promises of amendment, they were taken on 
 board, and were some time after soundly whipped and 
 pickled, after which they proved very honest and quiet 
 fellows. 
 
 Some time after this the boat was ordered on shore, 
 the tide being up, with the things promised to the men, 
 to which the captain, at my intercession, caused their 
 chests and clothes to be added, which they took, and 
 were very thankful for. 1 also encouraged them by 
 telling them that if it lay in my way to send any vessel 
 to take them in, I would not forget them. 
 
 When I took leave of this island, I carried on board, 
 for relics, the great goat -skin cap I had made, my 
 umbrella, and my parrot ; also I forgot not to take the 
 money I formerly mentioned, which had lain by me so 
 long useless that it was grown rusty or tarnished, and 
 could hardly pass for silver till it had been a little 
 rubbed and handled ; as also the money 1 found in the 
 wreck of the Spanish ship. 
 
 And thus I left the island, the 19th of December, as 
 I found by the ship's account, in the year 1686, after I 
 had been upon it eight and twenty years, two months, 
 and nineteen days, being delivered from this second 
 captivity the same day of the month that I first made 
 my escape in the barco-longo, from among the Moors of 
 Sallee.

 of what WM Wome of .ny partner, who I had re«80D 
 to suppose had son.i€ years now given ire over for 
 dead. 
 
 With this view I took shipping for Lisbon, where I 
 arrived iu April following; mv man Friday accom- 
 panying me ver^ honestly in all these ramblings, and 
 proving a most nithfu). servant upon all occasions. 
 
 \Vlien I came to Lisbon, I found out, by inquiry, 
 and to my particular satisfaction, my old friend the 
 captain of the ship who firut took me up at sea off 
 of the shore of Africa. He was now grown old, and 
 had left ofiF the sea, having put his son, who was far 
 from a young man, into his ship, and who still used 
 the Brazil trade. The old man did not know me ; 
 and, indeed, 1 hardly knew him ; but I soon brought 
 him to my remembrance, and as soon brought myself 
 to his remembrance when I told him who I was. 
 
 After some passionate expressions of the old acquaint- 
 ance, I inquired, you may be sure, after my plantation 
 and my partner. The old man told me he had not been 
 in the Brazils for about nine years ; but that he could 
 assure me that, when he came away, my partner was 
 living ; but the trustees, whom I had joined with him 
 to take cognisance of my part, were both dead. That, 
 however, he believed that I would have a very good 
 account of the improvement of the plantation ; for that 
 upon the general belief of my being cast away and 
 drowned, my trustees had given in the account of the 
 produce of my par*^ of the plantation to the procurator- 
 fiscal, who had appropriated it, in case I never came to 
 claim it, one-third to the king, and two-thirds to the 
 monastery of St. Augustine, to be expended for the 
 benefit if the poor, and for the conversion of the 
 Indians to the Catholic faith ; but that if 1 appeared, 
 or any one for me, to claim the inheritance, it should 
 be restored ; only that the improvement, or annual 
 production, being distributed to charitable uses, could 
 not be restored. But he assured me that the steward 
 of the king's revenue from lands, and the provedidore, 
 or steward of the monastery, had taken great care aU

 any account of my being dead or alive, he would have 
 acted by procuration, and taken possession of the ingenio, 
 o they called the sumr-house, and had given his son, 
 who was now at the Brazils, order to do it 
 
 'But,' says the old man, 'I have one piece of 
 news to tell you, which perhaps may not be so ac- 
 ceptable to you as the rest ; and that is, that believing 
 you were lost, and all the world believing so also, your 
 partner and trustees did offer to account to me, in your 
 name, for six or eight of the first years of profits, which 
 I received ; but there being at that time,' says he, 
 * great disbursements for increasing the works, building 
 an ingenio, and buying slaves, it did not anxount to near 
 so much as afterwards it produced. However,' says 
 the old man, *I shall give you a true account of 
 what I have received in all, and how I have disposed 
 ©fit.' *^ 
 
 After a few days' farther conference with this ancient 
 friend, he brought me an account of the six first years' 
 income of my plantation, signed by my partner and the 
 merchant- trustees, being always delivered in goods, 
 viz., tobacco in roll, and sugar in chests, besides rum, 
 molasses, etc., which is the consequence of a sugar-work ; 
 and I found, by this account, that every year the income 
 considerably increased ; but, as above, the disbursement 
 being large, the sum at first was small. However, the 
 old man let me see that he was debtor to me 470 moidores 
 of gold, besides 60 chests of sugar, and 16 double rolls 
 of tobacco, which were lost in his ship, he having been 
 shipwrecked coming home to Lisbon, about eleven years 
 after my leaving the place. 
 
 The good man then began to complain of his mis- 
 fortunes, and how he had been obliged to make use of 
 my money to recover his losses, and buy him a share 
 in a new ship. 'However, my old friend,' says he, 'you 
 shall not want a supply in vour necessity ; and as soon 
 as my son returns, you shall be fully satisfied.' 
 
 Upon this he pulls out an old pouch, and gives me 
 160 Portugal moidores in gold; and giving me the 
 writing of his title to the ship, which his son was gone 
 
 for .ecurily „f the rit " '"''' ""» ""y iMud,

 Thii being regularly attested by a notary, and a pro- 
 curation affixed, he directed me to send it, with a letter 
 of hit writing, to a merchant of his acquidntance at 
 the place, and then proposed my staying with him till 
 an account came of tKe return. 
 
 Never anjrthing was more honourable than the pro- 
 ceedings upon this procuration ; for in less than seven 
 months I rect ived a large packet from tiie survivors of 
 my trustees, the merchants, for whose account I went 
 to sea, in which were the following particular letters 
 and papers enclosed. 
 
 First, there was the account-current of the produce 
 of my farm or plantation from the year when their 
 fathers had balanced with my old Portugal captain, 
 being for six years; the balance appeared to be 1174 
 moidores in my favour. 
 
 Secondly, there was the account of four years more, 
 while they kept the effects in tlieir hands, before the 
 government claimed the administration, as being the 
 effects of a person not to be found, which they called 
 civil death ; and the balance of this, the value of the 
 plantation increasing, amounted to 38,892 crusadoes, 
 which made 3241 moidores. 
 
 Thirdly, there was the prior of the Augustines' 
 account, who had received the profits for above four- 
 teen years ; but not being to account for what was 
 disposed to the hospital, very honestly declared he had 
 872 moidores not distributed, which he acknowledged 
 to my account; as to the king's part, that refunded 
 nothing. 
 
 There was a letter of my partner's, congratulating me 
 very affectionately upon my being alive, giving me an 
 account how the estate was improved, and what it pro- 
 duced a year, with a particular of the number of squares 
 or acres that it contained ; how planted, how many 
 slaves there were upon it, and making two and twenty 
 crosses for blessings, told me he had said so many Ave 
 Marias to thank tiie blessed Virgin that I was alive ; 
 inviting me very passionately to come over and take 
 possession of my own ; and m the meantime, to give

 enioyment of it ^ compose myself for the 
 
 
 ohariUble to me in my diatr«M, kind to me in my 
 beginning, and honeet to me at tho end. I ^owed 
 him all that was lent me. I told him that, next to 
 the providence of Heaven, which diipoaet all things, 
 it was owing to him ; and that il now lay on me to 
 reward him, which I would do a hundredfold. So I 
 first returned to him the hundred moidorea I had 
 received of him ; then 1 sent for a notarv, and caused 
 him to draw up a general release or disctiarge for the 
 470 moidores which he had acknowledged he owed me 
 in the fullest and firmest manner possible ; after which 
 1 aused a procuration to be drawn, empowering him 
 to be my receiver of the annual profits of my planta- 
 tion, and appointin(r my partner to account to him, and 
 make the returns oy the usual Heets to him in my 
 name ; and a clause in the end, being a grant of 100 
 moidores a year to him, during his life, out of the 
 effects, and 60 moidores a year to ins sou after him, for 
 his life ; and thus I requited my old man. 
 
 I was now to consider which way to steer my course 
 next, and what to do with the estate that Providence 
 had thus put into my hands ; and, indeed, I had more 
 care upon my head now than 1 had in my silent 
 Stat of life in the island, where I wanted nothing but 
 what I had, and had nothing but what I wanted ; 
 whereas I had now a great cliarge upon me, and my 
 business was how to secure it. 1 had ne'er a cave 
 now to hide my money in, or a place where it might 
 lie without lock or key till it grew mouldy and tar- 
 nished before anybody would meddle with it. On the 
 contrary, I knew not where to put it, or whom to trust 
 with it My old patron, the captain, indeed, was 
 honest, and that was the only refuge I had. 
 
 In the next place, my interest in the Brazils seemed 
 to summon me thither ; but now I could not tell how 
 to think of going thither till I had settled my affairs, 
 and left my effects in some safe hands l)ehind me. At 
 first I thought of my old friend the widow, who I 
 knew was honest, and would he just to me ; but then 
 she was in years, and but poor, and for aught I knew 
 
 
 might J»e in debt : m thaf i« - j . .

 But, as 1 have said, this was not the main thinir that 
 kept me from going to the Brazils, but that r4lly I 
 did not know with whom to leave my effects behind 
 me ; so I resolved, at last, to go to England with it, 
 where, if I arrived, I concluded I should make some 
 acquaintance, or find some relations, that would be 
 teithful to nie ; and accordingly I prepared to go for 
 England with all my wealth. ^ ' »^ *^ » 
 
 « i° ^1^^% to prepare thin^ for my going home, I 
 first, the Brazil fleet being just going away, resolved 
 to give answers suitable to the just and faithful account 
 of things I had from thence. And first, to the prior of 
 St. Augustine I wrote a letter full of thanks for their just 
 de^ings, and the offer of the 872 moidores which was 
 undisposed of, which I desired might be given, 600 
 to the monastery, and 372 to the poor, as the prior 
 should direct, desiring the good padre's prayers for me, 
 and the like. 
 
 •i"^ n*!""®*^ * ^^,^*®'" **^ ^^^^'^s *o ™y two trustees, 
 with all the acknowledgment that so much justice and 
 honesty called for. As for sending them any present, 
 they were far above having any occasion of it. 
 
 Lastly, I wrote to my partner, acknowledging his 
 industry in the improving the plantation, and his in- 
 tegrity m increasing the stock of the works, ffivintr 
 him instructions for his future government of mv part 
 according to the powers I had left with my old patron! 
 to whom I desired him to send whatever became due 
 to me till he should hear from me more particularly • 
 assuring him that it was my intention not only to come 
 to him, but to settle myself there for the remainder of

 such the captains son informed me he had? with two 
 pieces of fine English broadcloth, the best I could get 
 m Lisbon, five pieces of black baize, and some Flanders 
 lace or a good value. 
 
 Having thus settled my affairs, sold my cargo, and 
 turned all my effects into good bills of exchange, my 
 next difficulty was which way to go to England I

 between two, to save the charge ; and as for me, I 
 ffot an English sailor to travel with me as a servant, 
 besides my man Friday, who was too much a stranger 
 to be capable of supplying the place of a servant on 
 the road. 
 
 In this manner I set out from Lisbon ; and our com- 
 pany being aU very well mounted and armed, we made 
 a little troop, whereof they did me the honour to call 
 me captain, as well because I was the oldest man, as 
 because I had two servants, and indeed was the original 
 of the whole journey. 
 
 As I have troubled you with none of my sea jour- 
 nals, so I shall trouble you now with none of my land 
 journal ; but some adventures that happened to us in 
 this tedious and diflScult journey I must not omit 
 
 When we came to Madrid, we being all of us 
 strangers to Spain, were willing to stay some time to 
 see the court of Spain, and to see what was worth 
 observing ; but it being the latter part of the summer 
 we hastened away, and set out from Madrid about the 
 middle of October ; but when we came to the edge of 
 Navarre, we were alarmed at several towns on the way 
 with an account that so much snow was fallen on the 
 French side of the mountains, that several travellers 
 were obliged to come back to Pampeluna, after having 
 attempted, at an extreme hazard, to pass on. 
 
 VVlien we came to Pampeluna itself, we found it so 
 indeed ; and to me, that had been always used to a hot 
 climate, and indeed to countries where we could scarce 
 bear any clothes on, the cold was insufferable ; nor 
 indeed was it more painful than it was surprising to 
 come but ten days before out of the Old Castile, where 
 the weather was not only warm, but very hot, and im- 
 mediately to feel a wind from the Pyrenean mountains 
 so very keen, so severely cold, as to be intolerable, and 
 to endanger benumbing and perishing of our fingers 
 and toes. 
 
 Poor Friday was really frighted when he saw the 
 mountains all covered with snow, and felt cold weather 
 which he had never seen or felt before in his life. '

 aid, had attempted to go, and were obliged to come 
 back again. 
 
 Accordingly we all set out from Pampeluna, with 
 our guide, on the 16th of November ; and, indeed, I 
 was surprised when, instead of going forward, he came 
 directly back with us oa the same road that we came 
 from Madrid, above twenty miles ; when being passed 
 two rivers, and come into the plain country, we found 
 ourselves in a warm climate again, where the country 
 was pleasant, and no snow to be seen: but on a 
 sudden, turning to his left, he approached the moun- 
 tains another way ; and though it is true the hills and 
 precipices looked dreadful, vet he made so many tours 
 such meanders, and led us by such winding ways, that 
 we were insensibly passed the height of the mountains 
 without being much encumbered with the snow ; and 
 ail on a sudden he ihowed us the pleasant fruitful 
 provinces of Languedoc and Gaseoign, all green and 
 flourishing, though, indeed, it was at a great distance, 
 and we had some rough way to pass yet. 
 
 We were a little uneasy, however, when we found 
 It snowed one whole day and a night so fast, that we 
 could not travel ; but he bid us be easy, we should 
 soon be past it all. We found, indeed, that we 
 tiegan to descend every day, and to come more north 
 than before ; and so, depending upon our guide we 
 went on. tr o t 
 
 It was about two hours before night when, our 
 guide being something before us, and not just in sight, 
 out rushed three monstrous wolves, and after them a 
 bear, out of a hollow way adjoining to a thick wood. 
 Iwoof the wolves ilew upon the guide, and had he 
 been half a mile before us he had been devoured 
 indeed before we could have helped him. One of 
 them fastened upon his horse, and the other attacked 
 the man with that violence, that he had not time, 
 or not presence of mind enough, to draw his pistol, 
 but hallooed and cried out to us most lustily. My 
 
 man Friday being next to me, 1

 296 ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 
 
 at first we were surprised and afraid for him, the greatest 
 diversion imaginable. As the bear is a heavy, clumsy 
 creature, and does not gallop as the wolf d s who 
 is swift and light, so he has two particular qualities, 
 which generally are the rule of his actions : first, as to 
 men, who are not his proper prey; 1 sar, not his 
 proper prey, because, though 1 cannot say what exces- 
 sive hunger might do, which was now their case, the 
 ground being all covered with snow ; but as to men, 
 e does not usually attempt them, unless they first 
 attack him. On the contrary, if you meet him in the 
 woods, if you don't meddle with him, he won't meddle 
 wit^ you ; but then you must take care to be very 
 civil to him, and give him the road, for he is a very 
 nice gentleman. He won't go a step out of his way for 
 a prince ; nay, if you are really afraid, your best way 
 IS to look another way, and keep going on ; for some- 
 times if you stop, and stand still, and look steadilv at 
 him, he takes it for an affront ; but if you throw or 
 toss anything at him, and it hits him, though it were 
 but a bit of a stick as big as your finger, he takes it for 
 an affront, and sets all his other business aside to pur- 
 sue his revenge; for he will have satisfaction in point 
 of hom)ur. That is his first quality ; the next is, that 
 if he be once affronted, he will never leave you, night 
 or day, till he has his revenge, but foUows, at a good 
 round rate, till he overtakes you. 
 
 My man Friday had delivered our guide, and when 
 we came up to him he was helping him off from his 
 horse ; for the man was both hurt and frighted, and 
 indeed the last more than the first; when, on the 
 sudden, we spied the bear come out of the wood, and 
 a vast monstrous one it was, the biggest by far that 
 ever I saw. We were all a little surprised when we 
 saw him ; but when Friday saw him, it was easy to see 
 joy and courage in the fellow's countenance. *0 ! O ' 
 O ! ' savs Friday, three times pointing to him. ' 6 
 master ! you give me te leave ; me shakee te hand with 
 him ; me make you good laugh.' 
 
 I was surprised to see the fellow so pleased. 'You

 no ihoot ; stand still, you get much laugh.' And aa 
 the nimble creature run two feet for the beast's one, he 
 turned on a sudden, on one side of us, and seeimr a 
 peat oak tree fit for his purpose, he beckoned tous 
 to foUow ; and doubling his pace, he gets nimbly up 
 the tree, laying his gun down upon the ground, at 
 about five or six yards from the bottom of the 
 tree. 
 
 The bear sooit came to the tree, and we followed at 
 a distance. The first thing he did, he stopped at the 
 gun, smelt to it, but let it lie, and up he scrambles into 
 the tree, climbing like a cat, though so monstrously 
 heavy. I was amazed at the folly, as I thought it of 
 my man, and could not for my life see anything to 
 laugh at yet, tiU seeing the bear get up the tree! we 
 all rode nearer to him. 
 
 WTien we came to the tree, there was Friday KOt 
 out to the small end of a large limb of the tree, and 
 the bear got about half way to him. As soon as the 
 bear got out to that part where the Umb of the tree 
 was weaker, 'Ha!' says he to us, 'now you see me 
 teachee the bear dance.' So he falls a-jumping and 
 shaking the bough, at which the bear began to totter, 
 but stood still, and began to look behind him, to see 
 how he should get back. Then, indeed, we did lauirh 
 heartily. But Friday had not done with him by a 
 great deal. When he sees him stand stUl, he caUs out 
 to him again, as if he had supposed the bear could 
 speak Enghsh, 'What, you no come farther? pray 
 you come farther'; so he left jumping and shaW 
 the tree ; and the bear, just as if he had understood 
 what he said, did come a little farther ; then he fell 
 a-jumpmg again, and the bear stopped again. 
 
 \^e thought now was a good time to knock him on 
 the head, and I called to Friday to stand still, and we 
 would shoot the bear ; but he cried out earnestly, ' O 
 pray ! O pray ! no shoot, me shoot by and then ' ; he 
 would have said by and by. However, to shorten the 
 story, Friday danced so much, and the bear stood so 
 tickJish, that we had laughing enough indeed, but still

 and what to do we hardly knew. The howling of wolvei 
 ran much in my head ; and indeed, except the noise 
 I once heard on the shore of Africa, of wlbich I have 
 Mid something already, I never heard anythinir that 
 nJled me with so much horror. 
 
 These things, and the approach of night, called us 
 off, or elw, as Friday would have had us, we should 
 certainly have taken the skin of this monstrous creature 
 off, whicli was worth saving ; but we had three leagues 
 to go, and our guide hastened us ; so we left hirn/and 
 went forward on our journey. 
 
 The ground was still covered with snow, though not 
 so deep and dangerous as on the mounUins ; and the 
 ravenous creatures, as we heard afterwards, were come 
 down into the forest and plain country, pressed bv 
 hunger, to seek for food, and had done a great deal 
 of mischief m the villages, where they surprised the 
 country people, kiUed a great many of their sheep and 
 borses, and some people too. 
 
 .r„!L^iS3 one dangerous place to pass, which 'our 
 guide told us if there were any more wolves in the 
 country we should find them there ; and this was in a 
 smaU plain, surrounded with woods on every side and 
 a long narrow defile, or lane, which we were to pass 
 to get through the wood, and then we should comfto 
 the village where we were to lodge. 
 
 It was within half an hour of sunset when we 
 entered the first wood, and a litUe after sunset wher 
 we came into the pUin. We met with nothing in the 
 first wood, except that, in a litUe plain within the 
 wood, which was not above two furlongs over, we saw 
 five great wolves cross the road, full speed, one after 
 anotfier as if they had been in chase of some pTey 
 and had it m view; they took no notice of us, and 
 were gone and out of our sight in a few moments. 
 Upon this our guide, who, by the way, was a wretehed 
 faint-hearted fellow, bid us keep in a readv posture,

 902 ADVENTURES OP ROBINSON CRUSOE 
 
 M loud M we oould ; and I found the notion not alto- 
 gether mistaken, for upon our ihout they beffan to 
 retire and turn about Then I ordered a leoond 
 volley to be fired in their rear, which put them to the 
 fallop, and awav they went to the woodi. 
 
 ThiB gave us leisure to charge our pieces again ; and 
 tVat we in" ' lose no time, we Icept going. But we 
 had but Hue more than loaded our fusees, and put 
 ourselves into a readiness, when we heard a terrible 
 noise in the same wood, on our left, only that it was 
 farther onward, the same way we were to go. 
 
 The night was coming on, and the light began to be 
 dusicy, which made it worse on our side ; but the noise 
 increasing, we could easily perceive that it was the 
 howling and yelling of those hellish creatures ; and on 
 a sudden, we perceived two or three troops of wolves, 
 one on our left, one behind us, and one on our front, 
 so that we seemed to be surrounded with them. How- 
 ever, as they did not fall upon us, we kept our way 
 forward as fast as we could make our horses go, which, 
 the way being very rough, was only a good largo trot, 
 and in this manner we came in view of the entrance o.' 
 a wood, through which we were to pass, at the farther 
 side -f the plam ; but we were greatly surprised when, 
 coming nearer the lane, or pass, we saw a confused 
 number of wolves standing just at the entrance. 
 
 On a sudden, at another opening of tlie wood, we 
 heard ti -.Jse of a gun, and looking that way, out 
 ru8he«t H iru ivith a saddle and a bridle on him, 
 flying ijjve the , n^^^ and sixteen or seventeen wolves 
 after him, vAl j.eec) ; indeed, the horse had the heels 
 of them ; but as we supposed that he could not hold it 
 at that rate, we doubted not but they would get un 
 with him at last, and no question but they did. ' 
 
 But here we had a most horrible sight ; for riding 
 up to the entrance where the horse came out, we 
 found the carcass of another horse and of two men, 
 devoured by the ravenous creatures ; and one of the 
 men was no doubt the same whom we heard fire the 
 gun, for there lay a gun just by him fired off ; but as

 while VI J were engaged ; but as I said, I called my 
 other man, and giving him a horn of powder, I bade 
 him lay a train all along the piece of timber, and let it 
 be a large train. He did so, and had but just time to 
 get away when the wolves came up to it, and some 
 were got up upon it, when I, snapping an uncharged 
 pistol close to the powder, set It on fire. Those tnat 
 were upon the timber were scorched with it, and six or 
 seven of them fell, or rather jumped, in among us with 
 the force and fright of the fire. VVe despatched these 
 in an instant, and the rest were so frighted with the 
 light, which the night, for it was now very near darlc, 
 made more terrible, that they drew back a little ; 
 upon which I ordered our last pistol to be fired off 
 in -* volley, and after that we gave a shout. Upon 
 t) wolves turned taU, and we sallied immediately 
 
 u^ iar twenty lame ones, whom we found struggling 
 
 on i. .a ground, and fell a-cutting them with our swords, 
 which answered our expectation ; for the crying and 
 howling they made was better understood by their 
 fellows, so that they all fled aud left us. 
 
 W? had, first and last, killed about threescore of 
 them, and had it been daylight we had killed many 
 more. The field of battle being thus cleared, we made 
 forward again, for we had still near a league to go. 
 We heard the ravenous creatures howl and yell in the 
 woods as we went several times, and sometimes we 
 fancied we saw some of them, but the snow dazzling 
 our eyes, we were not certain. So in about an hour 
 more we came to the town where we were to lodge, 
 which we found in a terrible fright, and all in arms ; 
 for it seems that the night before the wolves and some 
 bears had broke into the village in the night, and put 
 them in a terrible fright ; and they were obliged to 
 keep guard night and day, but especially in the night, 
 to preserve their cattle, and, indeed, their people. 
 
 The next morning our guide was so ill, and his 
 limbs swelled with the rankling of his two wounds, 
 that he could go no farther ; so we were obliged to 
 take a new guide there, and go to Toulouse, where

 306 ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 
 
 advantage than I can. I travelled from Toulouse to 
 Paris, and without any considerable stay came to Calais, 
 and landed safe at Dover, the 14th of January, after 
 having had a severe cold season to travel in. 
 
 I was now come to the centre of my travels, and 
 had in a little time all my new-discovered estate safe 
 about me, the bills of exchange which I brought with 
 me having been very currently paid. 
 
 My principal guide and privy councillor was my good 
 ancient widow ; who, in gratitude for the money 1 had 
 sent her, thought no pains too much, or care too great, 
 to employ for me ; and I trusted her so entirely with 
 everything, that I was perfectly easy as to the security 
 of my effects ; and indeed 1 was very happy from my 
 beginning, and now to the end, in the unspotted in- 
 tegrity of this good gentlewoman. 
 
 And now I began to think of leaving my effects with 
 this woman and setting out for Lisbon, and so to the 
 Brazils. But now another scruple came in my way, 
 and that was religion ; for as i had entertained some 
 duubts about the Roman religion even while I was 
 abroad, especially in my state of solitude, so I knew 
 there was no going to the Brazils for me, much less 
 going to settle there, unless I resolved to embrace the 
 Roman Catholic religion without any reserve ; unless 
 on the other hand I resolved to be a sacrifice to my 
 
 firincjples, be a martyr for religion, and die in the 
 nquisitiou. So I resolved to stay at home, and if 1 
 could find means for it, to dispose of my plantation. 
 
 To this purpose I wrote to my old friend at Lisbon, 
 who in return gave me notice that he could easily 
 dispose of it there ; but that if I thought fit to give 
 him leave to offer it in my name to the two merchants, 
 the survivors of my trustees, who lived in the Brazils, 
 who must fully understand the value of it, who lived 
 just upon the spot, and whom I knew were very rich, 
 so that he believed they would be fond of buying it, he 
 did not doubt but I should make 4000 or 5000 pieces 
 of eight the more of it. 
 
 Accordingly I agreed, gave him order to offer it to

 308 ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 
 
 bold, enterprising young fellow, I put him into a good 
 8bip and sent him to sea ; and this young fellow after- 
 wards drew me in, as old as I was, to farther adventures 
 myself. 
 
 In the meantime, 1 in part settled myself here; for, 
 first of all, I married, and that not either to my dis- 
 advantage or dissatisfaction, and had three children 
 two sons and one daughter ; but my wife dying, and 
 my nephew coming home with good success from a 
 voyage to Spain, my inclinati- to go abroad, and 
 his importunity, prevailed, and ingaged me to go in 
 his ship as a private trader to -. /.ast Indies. This 
 was m the year 1G94. 
 
 In this voyage I visited my new colony in the island 
 saw my successors the Spaniards, had the whole story 
 of their lives, and of the villains I left there; how at 
 first they insulted the poor Spaniards, how they after- 
 wards agreed, disagreed, united, separated, and'how at 
 last the bparnards were obliged to use violence with 
 them ; liow they were subjected to the Spaniards ; how 
 honestly the Spaniards used them ; a history, if it were 
 entered into, as full of variety and wonderful accidents 
 as my own part; particu! rly also as to their battles 
 with the Caribbeanr., who landed several times upon 
 the island, and as to the improvement they made upon 
 the island itself; and how five of them made an attempt 
 upon the mainland, and brought away eleven men and 
 hve women prisoners, by which, at my coming, I found 
 al)out twenty young children on the island 
 
 Here I stayed about twenty days, left them supplies 
 of all necessary things, and particularly of arms 
 powder shot, clothes, tools, and two workmen, which 
 1 brought from England w^^h me, viz., a carpenter and 
 a smith. ' 
 
 Besides this, I shared the island into parts with 
 them, reserved to myself the property of the whole, 
 hut gave them such parts respectively as they agreed 
 on; and having settled all things with themf and 
 engaged them not to leave the place, I left them there 
 
 iTom thence I touched at the Brazils, from whence

Tne World's Classics 
 
 THE best recommendation of The World't 
 Classics is the books themselves, which have 
 earned unstinted praise from critics and all classes 
 of the public. Some two million copies have been 
 sold, and of the volumes already published nearly 
 one-half have gone into a second, third, fourth, 
 fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, or ninth impression. It 
 is only possible to give so much for the money when 
 large sates are ce-*ain. The clearness of the type, 
 the qual?^ of Ibe paper, the size of the page, the 
 printing, and the binding— from the cheapest to the 
 best— cannot fail to commend themselves to all 
 who love good literature presented in worthy form. 
 That a high standard is insisted upon is proved by 
 the hst of books already published and of those on 
 tLe eve of publication. A great feature is the brief 
 critical introductions written by leading authorities 
 of the day. The volumes of The World's Classics 
 are obtainable in a number of different styles, 
 the description and prices of which are given 
 on page i ; but special attention may be called to 
 the sultan-red limp leather style, which is un- 
 surpassable in leather bindings at the price of i/6 
 net.
