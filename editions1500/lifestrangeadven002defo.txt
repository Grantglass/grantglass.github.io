AUTHORS PREFACE 



THE success the former part of this work 
has met with in the world, has yet been 
no other than is acknowledged to be due 
to the surprising variety of the subject 
and to the agreeable manner of the 
performance. 

All the endeavours of envious people to reproach 
it with being a romance, to search it for errors in 
geography, inconsistency in the relation, and contra- 
dictions in the fact, have proved abortive, and as 
impotent as malicious. 

The just application of every incident, the religious 
and useful inferences drawn from every part, are 
so many testimonies to the good design of making it 
public, and must legitimate all the part that may be 
called invention or parable in the story. 

The second part, if the Editor's opinion may pass, 
is (contrary to the usage of second parts) every way 
as entertaining as the first, contains as strange and 
surprising incidents, and as great a variety of them ; 
nor is the application less serious and suitable, and 
doubtless will, to the sober as well as ingenious reader, 
be every way as profitable and diverting ; and this 
makes the abridging this work as scandalous as it is 
knavish and ridiculous, seeing, while to shorten the 
book that they may seem to reduce the value, they 
strip it of all those reflections, as well religious as 
moral, which are not only the greatest beauties of 
the work, but are calculated for the infinite advan- 
tage of the reader.

AUTHOR'S PREFACE 



By this they leave the work naked of its brightest 
ornaments ; and if they would at the same time pre- 
tend that the author has supplied the story out of 
his invention, they take from it the improvement 
which alone recommends that invention to wise and 
good men. 

The injury these men do the proprietor of this 
work is a practice all honest men abhor, and he be- 
lieves he may challenge them to show the difference 
between that and robbing on the highway, or break- 
ing open a house. 

If they can't show any difference in the crime, 
they will find it hard to show why there should be 
any difference in the punishment ; and he will answer 
for it that nothing shall be wanting on his part to 
do them justice.

FARTHER ADVENTURES 

^ROBINSON CRUSOE 



THAT homely proverb used on so many 
occasions in England, viz., 44 That what 
is bred in the bone will not go out of the 
flesh,' 11 was never more verified than in the 
story of my life. Any one would think 
that, after thirty -five years'* affliction, and a variety of 
unhappy circumstances, which few men, if any, ever 
went through before, and after near seven years of 
peace and enjoyment in the fulness of all things, grown 
old, and when, if ever, it might be allowed me to have 
had experience of every state of middle life, and to 
know which was most adapted to make a man com- 
pletely happy ; I say, after all this, any one would 
have thought that the native propensity to rambling, 
which I gave an account of in my first setting out 
into the world to have been so predominant in my 
thoughts, should be worn out, the volatile part be 
fully evacuated, or at least condensed, and I might, 
at sixty-one years of age, have been a little inclined 
to stay at home, and have done venturing life and 
fortune any more. 

Nay, farther, the common motive of foreign adven- 
tures was taken away in me ; for I had no fortune to 
make, I had nothing to seek. If I had gained ten 
thousand pounds, I had been no richer ; for I had 
already sufficient for me, and for those I had to leave 
it to, and that I had was visibly increasing; for hav- 
ing no great family, I could not spend the income of 

VOL. II. — 1 [ 1 1 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



what I had unless I would set up for an expensive 
way of living, such as a great family, servants, equi- 
page, gaiety, and the like, which were things I had no 
notion of, or inclination to ; so that I had nothing 
indeed to do but to sit still and fully enjoy what I 
had got, and see it increase daily upon my hands. 

Yet all these things had no effect upon me, or at 
least not enough to resist the strong inclination I had 
to go abroad again, which hung about me like a 
chronical distemper ; particularly the desire of seeing 
my new plantation in the island, and the colony I left 
there, ran in my head continually. I dreamed of it 
all night, and my imagination ran upon it all day ; it 
was uppermost in all my thoughts, and my fancy 
worked so steadily and strongly upon it, that I talked 
of it out of my sleep. In short, nothing could remove 
it out of my mind ; it even broke so violently into 
all my discourses, that it made my conversation tire- 
some, for I could talk of nothing else ; all my dis- 
course run into it, even to impertinence, and I saw 
it myself. 

I have often heard persons of good judgment say, 
that all the stir people make in the world about 
ghosts and apparitions is owing to the strength of 
imagination, and the powerful operation of fancy in 
their minds ; that there is no such thing as a spirit 
appearing, or a ghost walking, and the like ; that 
people's poring affectionately upon the past conver- 
sation of their deceased friends so realises it to them, 
that they are capable of fancying upon some extra- 
ordinary circumstances that they see them, talk to 
them, and are answered by them, when, in truth, 
there is nothing but shadow and vapour in the thing, 
and they really know nothing of the matter. 

For my part, I know not to this hour whether there 
are any such things as real apparitions, spectres, or 
walking of people after they are dead, or whether 

[2] 



UOHINSON CRUSOE 



there is anything in the stories they tell us of that 
kind, more than the product of vapours, sick minds, 
and wandering fancies. But this I know, that my 
imagination worked up to such a height, and brought 
me into such ecstasies of vapours, or what else I may 
call it, that I actually supposed myself oftentimes 
upon the spot, at my old castle behind the trees, 
saw my old Spaniard, Friday's father, and the repro- 
bate sailors I left upon the island ; nay, I fancied I 
talked with them, and looked at them so steadily, 
though I was broad awake, as at persons just before 
me ; and this I did till I often frighted myself with 
the images my fancy represented to me. One time 
in my sleep I had the villainy of the three pirate 
sailors so lively related to me by the first Spaniard 
and Friday's father, that it was surprising. They 
told me how they barbarously attempted to murder 
all the Spaniards, and that they set fire to the pro- 
visions they had laid up, on purpose to distress and 
starve them ; things that I had never heard of, and 
that indeed were never all of them true in fact ; but 
it was so warm in my imagination, and so realised to 
me, that to the hour I saw them I could not be per- 
suaded but that it was or would be true ; also how 
I resented it when the Spaniard complained to me, 
and how I brought them to justice, tried them be- 
fore me, and ordered them all three to be hanged. 
What there was really in this, shall be seen in its 
place ; for however I came to form such things in 
my dream, and what secret converse of spirits in- 
jected it, yet there was very much of it true. I say, 
I own that this dream had nothing in it literally and 
specifically true ; but the general part was so true, 
the base villainous behaviour of these three hardened 
rogues was such, and had been so much worse than 
all I can describe, that the dream had too much 
similitude of the fact; and as I would afterwards 

[3] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



have punished them severely, so if I had hanged them 
all I had been much in the right, and should have 
been justifiable both by the laws of God and man. 

But to return to my story. In this kind of tem- 
per I had lived some years. I had no enjoyment of 
my life, no pleasant hours, no agreeable diversion 
but what had something or other of this in it ; 
so that my wife, who saw my mind so wholly bent 
upon it, told me very seriously one night that she 
believed there was some secret powerful impulse of 
Providence upon me, which had determined me to go 
thither again; and that she found nothing hindered 
my going, but my being engaged to a wife and 
children. She told me, that it was true she could 
not think of parting with me ; but as she was as- 
sured that if she was dead it would be the first thing 
I would do, so, as it seemed to her that the tiling 
was determined above, she would not be the only 
obstruction ; for if I thought fit, and resolved to go 

here she found me very intent upon her words, 

and that I looked very earnestly at her, so that it a 
little disordered her, and she stopped. I asked her 
why she did not go on, and say out what she was 
going to say. But I perceived her heart was too 
full, and some tears stood in her eyes. M Speak out, 
my dear," said I; "are you willing I should go?" 
" No, M says she very affectionately, " I am far from 
willing ; but if you are resolved to go," says she, 
" and rather than I will be the only hindrance, I 
will go with you ; for though I think it a most pre- 
posterous thing for one of your years, and in your 
condition, yet if it must be, 11 said she again, weep- 
ing, " I won't leave you ; for if it be of Heaven, you 
must do it. There is no resisting it ; and if Heaven 
makes it your duty to go, He will also make it mine 
to go with you, or otherwise dispose of me, that I may 
not obstruct it." 

[4] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



This affectionate behaviour of my wife's brought 
me a little out of the vapours, and I began to con- 
sider what I was a-doing. I corrected my wander- 
ing fancy, and began to argue with myself sedately 
what business I had, after threescore years, and after 
such a life of tedious sufferings and disasters, and 
closed in so happy and easy a manner — I say, what 
business I had to rush into new hazards, and put 
myself upon adventures fit only for youth and 
poverty to run into. 

With those thoughts, I considered my new en- 
gagement ; that I had a wife, one child born, and 
my wife then great with child of another ; that I 
had all the world could give me, and had no need 
to seek hazards for gain ; that I was declining in 
years, and ought to think rather of leaving what I 
had gained, than of seeking to increase it ; that as 
to what my wife had said, of its being an impulse 
from Heaven, and that it should be my duty to go, 
I had no notion of that ; so after many of these 
cogitations, I struggled with the power of my imagi- 
nation, reasoned myself out of it, as I believe people 
may always do in like cases, if they will ; and, in a 
word, I conquered it, composed myself with such 
arguments as occurred to my thought, and which 
my present condition furnished me plentifully with ; 
and particularly, as the most effectual method, I 
resolved to divert myself with other things, and to 
engage in some business that might effectually tie 
me up from any more excursions of this kind ; for 
I found that thing return upon me chiefly when I 
was idle, had nothing to do, nor anything of moment 
immediately before me. 

To this purpose I bought a little farm in the 
county of Bedford, and resolved to remove myself 
thither. I had a little convenient house upon it, 
and the land about it I found was capable of great 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



improvement, and that it was many ways suited to 
my inclination, which delighted in cultivating, man- 
aging, planting, and improving of land; and par- 
ticularly being an inland country, I was removed 
from conversing among ships, sailors, and things re- 
lating to the remote part of the world. 

In a word, I went down to my farm, settled my 
family, bought me ploughs, harrows, a cart, waggon, 
horses, cows, sheep; and setting seriously to work, 
became in one half year a mere country gentleman. 
My thoughts were entirely taken up in managing 
my servants, cultivating the ground, enclosing, plant- 
ing, &c. ; and I lived, as I thought, the most agree- 
able life that nature was capable of directing, or 
that a man always bred to misfortunes was capable 
of being retreated to. 

I farmed upon my own land, I had no rent to 
pay, was limited by no articles. I could pull up 
or cut down as I pleased. What I planted was 
for myself, and what I improved was for my fam- 
ily ; and having thus left off the thoughts of wan- 
dering, I had not the least discomfort in any part 
of life, as to this world. Now I thought indeed that 
I enjoyed the middle state of life that my father so 
earnestly recommended to me, and lived a kind of 
heavenly life, something like what is described by 
the poet upon the subject of a country life : 

*' Free from vices, free from care, 
Age has no pain, and youth no snare." 

But in the middle of all this felicity, one blow 
from unforeseen Providence unhinged me at once ; 
and not only made a breach upon me, inevitable and 
incurable, but drove me, by its consequences, into a 
deep relapse into the wandering disposition ; which, 
as I may say, being born in my very blood, soon 
recovered its hold of me, and, like the returns of a 

[6] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



violent distemper, came on with an irresistible force 
upon me, so that nothing could make any more 
impression upon me. This blow was the loss of 
my wife. 

It is not my business here to write an elegy upon 
my wife, give a character of her particular virtues, 
and make my court to the sex by the flattery of a 
funeral sermon. She was, in a few words, the stay 
of all my affairs, the centre of all my enterprises, 
the engine that, by her prudence, reduced me to 
that happy compass I was in, from the most extrava- 
gant and ruinous project that fluttered in my head, 
as above, and did more to guide my rambling genius 
than a mother's tears, a father's instructions, a 
friend's counsel, or my own reasoning powers could 
do. I was happy in listening to her tears, and in 
being moved by her entreaties, and to the last 
degree desolate and dislocated in the world by the 
loss of her. 

When she was gone, the world looked awkwardly 
round me. I was as much a stranger in it, in my 
thoughts, as I was in the Brazils when I went first 
on shore there ; and as much alone, except as to the 
assistance of servants, as I was in my island. I 
knew neither what to do, or what not to do. I saw 
the world busy round me, one part labouring for 
bread, and the other part squandering in vile ex- 
cesses or empty pleasures, equally miserable, because 
the end they proposed still fled from them ; for the 
man of pleasure every day surfeited of his vice, and 
heaped up work for sorrow and repentance ; and the 
men of labour spent their strength in daily strag- 
glings for bread to maintain the vital strength they 
laboured with, so living in a daily circulation of 
sorrow, living but to work, and working but to live, as 
if daily bread were the only end of wearisome life, and 
a wearisome life the only occasion of daily bread. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



This put me in mind of the life I lived in my 
kingdom, the island, where I suffered no more corn 
to grow because I did not want it; and bred no 
more goats, because I had no more use for them ; 
where the money lay in the drawer till it grew 
mouldy, and had scarce the favour to be looked 
upon in twenty years. 

All these things, had I improved them as I ought 
to have done, and as reason and religion had dictated 
to me, would have taught to me to search farther 
than human enjoyments for a full felicity, and that 
there was something which certainly was the reason 
and end of life, superior to all these things, and 
which was either to be possessed, or at least hoped 
for, on this side the grave. 

But my sage counsellor was gone ; I was like a 
ship without a pilot, that could only run afore 
the wind. My thoughts ran all away again into 
the old affair; my head was quite turned with the 
whimsies of foreign adventures ; and all the pleasant 
innocent amusements of my farm and my garden, 
my cattle and my family, which before entirely pos- 
sessed me, were nothing to me, had no relish, and 
were like music to one that has no ear, or food to 
one that has no taste. In a word, I resolved to 
leave off housekeeping, let my farm, and return 
to London ; and in a few months after I did so. 

When I came to London, I was still as uneasy as 
I was before. I had no relish to the place, no em- 
ployment in it, nothing to do but to saunter about 
like an idle person, of whom it may be said he is 
perfectly useless in God's creation, and it is not one 
farthing matter to the rest of his kind whether he 
be dead or alive. This also was the life which of 
all circumstances of life was the most my aversion, 
who had been all my days used to an active life ; 
and I would often say to myself, " A state of idle- 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



ness is the very dregs of life ; " and indeed I thought 
I was much more suitably employed when I was 
twenty-six days a-making me a deal board. 

It was now the beginning of the year 1693, when 
my nephew, whom, as I had observed before, I had 
brought up to the sea, and had made him commander 
of a ship, was come home from a short voyage to 
Bilboa, being the first he had made ; and he came to 
me, and told me that some merchants of his acquaint- 
ance had been proposing to him to go a voyage for 
them to the East Indies and to China, as private 
traders. " And now, uncle," says he, " if you will 
go to sea with me, 1 11 engage to land you upon your 
old habitation in the island, for we are to touch at 
the Brazils." 

Nothing can be a greater demonstration of a future 
state, and of the existence of an invisible world, than 
the concurrence of second causes with the ideas of 
things which we form in our minds, perfectly re- 
served, and not communicated to any in the world. 

My nephew knew nothing how far my distemper 
of wandering was returned upon me, and I knew 
nothing of what he had in his thoughts to say, when 
that very morning, before he came to me, I had, in a 
great deal of confusion of thought, and revolving every 
part of my circumstances in my mind, come to this 
resolution, viz., that I would go to Lisbon, and con- 
sult with my old sea-captain ; and so, if it was rational 
and practicable, I would go and see the island again, 
and see what was become of my people there. I had 
pleased myself with the thoughts of peopling the 
place, and carrying inhabitants from hence, getting 
a patent for the possession, and I know not what ; 
when in the middle of all this in comes my nephew, 
as I have said, with his project of carrying me 
thither, in his way to the East Indies. 

I paused awhile at his words, and looking steadily 

[9] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



at him, "What devil,'" said I, "sent you of this 
unlucky errand ? w My nephew startled, as if he had 
been frighted at first ; out perceiving I was not much 
displeased with the proposal, he recovered himself. 
" I hope it may not be an unlucky proposal, sir,"" says 
he. " I dare say you would be pleased to see your 
new colony there, where you once reigned with more 
felicity than most of your brother monarchs in the 
world." 

In a word, the scheme hit so exactly with my 
temper, that is to say, the prepossession I was under, 
and of which I have said so much, that I told him, 
in few words, if he agreed with the merchants, I 
would go with him ; but I told him I would not 
promise to go any farther than my own island. 
k * Why, sir," says he, "you don't want to be left 
there again, I hope? 11 " Why," said I, "can you 
not take me up again in your return ? 11 He told 
me it could not be possible that the merchants would 
allow him to come that way with a loaded ship of 
such value, it being a month's sail out of his way, 
and might be three or four. " Besides, sir, if I 
should miscarry, 11 said he, "and not return at all, 
then you would be just reduced to the condition 
you were in before. 11 

This was very rational ; but we both found out a 
remedy for it, which was to cany a framed sloop on 
board the ship, which, being taken in pieces, and 
shipped on board the ship, might, by the help of 
some carpenters, whom we agreed to carry with us, 
be set up again in the island, and finished, fit to go 
to sea in a few days. 

I was not long resolving ; for indeed the impor- 
tunities of my nephew joined in so effectually with 
my inclination, that nothing could oppose me. On 
the other hand, my wife lxjing dead, I had nobody 
concerned themselves so much for me as to persuade 

[10] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



me one way or other, except my ancient good 
friend the widow, who earnestly struggled with me 
to consider my years, my easy circumstances, and 
the needless hazards of a long voyage ; and above all, 
my young children. But it was all to no purpose ; 
I had an irresistible desire to the voyage; and I told 
her I thought there was something so uncommon in 
the impressions I had upon my mind for the voyage, 
that it would be a kind of resisting Providence if I 
should attempt to stay at home ; after which she 
ceased her expostulations, and joined with me, not 
only in making provision for my voyage, but also in 
settling my family affairs for my absence, and provid- 
ing for the education of my children. 

In order to this I made my will, and settled the 
estate I had in such a manner for my children, and 
placed in such hands, that I was perfectly easy 
and satisfied they would have justice done them, 
whatever might befall me ; and for their education, 
I left it wholly to my widow, with a sufficient 
maintenance to herself for her care ; all which she 
richly deserved, for no mother could have taken 
more care in their education, or understood it better ; 
and as she lived till I came home, I also lived to 
thank her for it. 

My nephew was ready to sail about the beginning 
of January 1694-95, and I with my man Friday 
went on board in the Downs the 8th, having, besides 
that sloop which I mentioned above, a very consider- 
able cargo of all kinds of necessary things for my 
colony, which if I did not find in good condition, I 
resolved to leave so. 

First, I carried with me some servants, whom I 
purposed to place there as inhabitants, or at least to 
set on work there upon my own account while I 
stayed, and either to leave them there, or carry them 
forward, as they should appear willing ; particularly, 

[ii] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



I carried two carpenters, a smith, and a very handy, 
ingenious fellow, who was a cooper by trade, but was 
a No a general mechanic ; for he was dexterous at 
making wheels, and handmills to grind corn, was 
a good turner, and a good pot-maker. He also made 
anything that was proper to make of earth, or of 
wood; in a word, we called him our Jack-of-all- 
trades. 

With these I carried a tailor, who had offered 
himself to go passenger to the East Indies with my 
nephew, but afterwards consented to stay on our 
new plantation, and proved a most necessary handy 
fellow as could be desired, in many other businesses 
besides that of his trade ; for, as I observed formerly, 
necessity arms us for all employments. 

My cargo, as near as I can collect, for I have 
not kept an account of the particulars, consisted of 
a sufficient quantity of linen, and some thin English 
si nil's for clothing the Spaniards, that I expected to 
find there, and enough of them as by my calculation 
might comfortably supply them for seven years. If 
I remember right, the materials I carried for cloth- 
ing them with, gloves, hats, shoes, stockings, and all 
Mic h things as they could want for wearing, amounted 
to above two hundred pounds, including some beds, 
bedding, and household stuff, particularly kitchen 
utensils, with p>ts, kettles, pewter, brass, &c, and 
near an hundred pound more in iron-work, nails, tools 
of every kind, staples, hooks, hinges, and every 
necessary thing I could think of. 

I carried also an hundred spare arms, muskets, and 
fusees, besides some pistols, a considerable quantity 
of shot of all sizes, and two pieces of brass cannon ; 
and because I knew not what time and what extrem- 
ities I was providing for, I carried an hundred barrels 
of powder, besides swords, cutlasses, and the iron part 
of some pikes and halberds ; so that, in short, we had 

[12] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



a large magazine of all sorts of stores; and I made 
my nephew carry two small quarter-deck guns more 
than he wanted for his ship, to leave behind if there 
was occasion ; that when we came there, we might 
build a fort, and man it against all sorts of enemies. 
And indeed I at first thought there was need enough 
for it all, and much more, if we hoped to maintain 
our possession of the island, as shall be seen in the 
course of that story. 

I had not such bad luck in this voyage as I had 
been used to meet with, and therefore shall have the 
less occasion to interrupt the reader, who perhaps 
may be impatient to hear how matters went with my 
colony ; yet some odd accidents, cross winds, and bad 
weather happened on this first setting out, which 
made the voyage longer than I expected it at first ; 
and I, who had never made but one voyage, viz., my 
first voyage to Guinea, in which I might be said to 
come back again as the voyage was at first designed, 
began to think the same ill fate still attended me, 
and that I was born never to be contented with being 
on shore, and yet to be always unfortunate at sea. 

Contrary winds first put us to the northward, and 
we were obliged to put in at Galway, in Ireland, where 
we lay windbound two and twenty days ; but we had 
this satisfaction with the disaster, that provisions 
were here exceeding cheap, and in the utmost 
plenty ; so that while we lay here we never touched 
the ship's stores, but rather added to them ; also I 
took in several live hogs, and two cows and calves, 
which I resolved, if I had a good passage, to put on 
shore in my island ; but we found occasion to dispose 
otherwise of them. 

We set out the 5th of February from Ireland, and 
had a very fair gale of wind for some days. As I 
remember, it might be about the 20th of February, 
in the evening late, when the mate, having the watch, 

[13] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



came into the round-house, and told us he saw a flash 
of fire, and heard a gun fired ; and while he was tell- 
ing us of it, a boy came in, and told us the boatswain 
heard another. This made us all run out upon the 
quarter-deck, where for a while we heard nothing, but 
in a few minutes we saw a very great light, and found 
that there was some very terrible fire at a distance. 
Immediately we had recourse to our reckonings, in 
which we all agreed that there could be no land that 
way in which the fire showed itself, no, not for five 
hundred leagues, for it appeared at, W.N.W. Upon 
this we concluded it must be some ship on fire at 
se a ; and as by our hearing the noise of guns just 
before we concluded it could not be far off, we stood 
directly towards it, and were presently satisfied we 
should discover it, because the farther we sailed the 
greater I he light appealed, though the weather being 
hazy we could not perceive anything but the light 
for a while. In about half-ail -hour's sailing, the 
wind being fair for us, though not much of it, and 
the weather clearing up a little, we could plainly dis- 
cern that it was a great ship on fire in the middle of 
the sea. 

I was most sensibly touched with this disaster, 
though not at all acquainted with the persons engaged 
in it. I presently recollected my former circum- 
stances, and in what condition I was in when taken 
up by the Portugal captain ; and how much more 
deplorable the circumstances of the poor creatures 
belonging to this ship must be if they had no other 
ship in company with them. Upon this I immedi- 
ately ordered that five guns should be fired, one soon 
after another, that, if possible, we might give notice 
to them that there was help for them at hand, and 
that they might endeavour to save themselves in their 
boat ; for though we could see the fiaine of the ship, 
yet they, it being night, could see nothing of us. 

[14] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



We lay by some time upon this, only driving as 
the burning ship drove, waiting for daylight ; when, 
on a sudden, to our great terror, though we had 
reason to expect it, the ship blew up in the air, and 
immediately, that is to say, in a few minutes, all the 
fire was out, that is to say, the rest of the ship sunk. 
This was terrible, and indeed an afflicting sight, for 
the sake of the poor men, who, I concluded, must 
be either all destroyed in the ship, or be in the ut- 
most distress in their boat in the middle of the 
ocean, which, at present, by reason it was dark, I 
could not see. However, to direct them as well as 
I could, I caused lights to be hung out in all the 
parts of the ship where we could, and which we had 
lanthorns for, and kept firing guns all the night 
long, letting them know by this that there was a 
ship not far off. 

About eight o'clock in the morning we discovered 
the ship's boats by the help of our perspective glasses, 
and found there were two of them, both thronged 
with people, and deep in the water. We perceived 
they rowed, the wind being against them, that they 
saw our ship, and did their utmost to make us see 
them. 

We immediately spread our ancient to let them 
know we saw them, and hung a waft out as a signal 
for them to come on board, and then made more 
sail, standing directly to them. In little more than 
half-an-hour we came up with them, and in a word 
took them all in, being no less than sixty-four men, 
women, and children ; for there were a great many 
passengers. 

Upon the whole, we found it was a French mer- 
chant ship of three hundred tons, homeward bound 
from Quebec, in the river of Canada. The master 
gave us a long account of the distress of his ship, 
how the fire began in the steerage by the negligence 

[15] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



of the steersman ; but on his crying out for help 
was, as everybody thought, entirely put out, when 
they found that some sparks of the first fire had 
gotten into some part of the ship so difficult to come 
at, that they could not effectually quench it ; till 
getting in between the timbers, and within the ceil- 
ing of the ship, it proceeded into the hold, and 
mastered all the skill and all the application they 
were able to exert. 

They had no more to do then but to get into 
their boats, which, to their great comfort, were 
pretty large ; being their longboat, and a great 
shallop, besides a small skiff, which was of no great 
service to them other than to get some fresh water 
and provisions into her, after they had secured their 
lives from the fire. They had indeed small hope of 
their lives by getting into these boats at that dis- 
tance from any land, only, as they said well, that 
they were escaped from the fire, and had a possi- 
bility that some ship might happen to be at sea, and 
might take them in. They had sails, oars, and a 
compass, and were preparing to make the best of 
their way back to Newfoundland, the wind blowing 
pretty fair; for it blew an easy gale at S.E. by E. 
They had as much provisions and water as, with 
sparing it so as to be next door to starving, might 
support them about twelve days ; in which, if they 
had no bad weather, and no contrary winds, the 
captain said he hoped he might get the banks of 
Newfoundland, and might perhaps take some fish to 
sustain them till they might go on shore. But 
there were so many chances against them in all 
these cases, such as storms to overset and founder 
them, rains and cold to benumb and perish their 
limbs, contrary winds to keep them out and starve 
them, that it must have been next to miraculous 
if they had escaped. 

[16] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



In the midst of their consultations, every one 
being hopeless and ready to despair, the captain, 
with tears in his eyes, told me they were on a sudden 
surprised with the joy of hearing a gun fired, and 
after that four more ; these were the five guns which 
I caused to be fired at first seeing the light. This 
revived their hearts, and gave them the notice which, 
as above, I desired it should, viz., that there was a 
ship at hand for their help. 

It was upon hearing these guns that they took 
down their masts and sails ; the sound coming from 
the windward, they resolved to lie by till morning. 
Some time after this, hearing no more guns, they 
fired three muskets, one a considerable while after 
another ; but these, the wind being contrary, we 
never heard. 

Some time after that again they were still more 
agreeably surprised with seeing our lights and hear- 
ing the guns, which, as I have said, I caused to be 
fired all the rest of the night. This set them to 
work with their oars to keep their boats ahead, at 
least that we might the sooner come up with them ; 
and at last, to their inexpressible joy, they found 
we saw them. 

It is impossible for me to express the several 
gestures, the strange ecstasies, the variety of postures, 
which these poor delivered people ran into to ex- 
press the joy of their souls at so unexpected a de- 
liverance. Grief and fear are easily described ; sighs, 
tears, groans, and a very few motions of the head 
and hands make up the sum of its variety ; but an 
excess of joy, a surprise of joy, has a thousand ex- 
travagancies in it. There were some in tears, some 
raging and tearing themselves, as if they had been 
in the greatest agonies of sorrow ; some stark rav- 
ing and downright lunatic ; some ran about the 
ship stamping with their feet, others wringing their 
vol. n. — 2 [ 17 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



hands ; some were dancing, some singing, some laugh- 
ing, more crying; many quite dumb, not able to 
speak a word ; others sick and vomiting, several 
swooning, and ready to faint ; and a few were cross- 
ing themselves and giving God thanks. 

I would not wrong them neither. There might 
be many that were thankful afterward ; but the 
passion was too strong for them at first, and they 
were not able to master it ; they were thrown into 
ecstasies and a kind of frenzy, and it was but a 
very few that were composed and serious in their 

joy- 
Perhaps the case may have some addition to it 

from the particular circumstance of that nation they 
belonged to; I mean the French, whose temper is 
allowed to be more volatile, more passionate, and 
more sprightly, and their spirits more fluid, than in 
other nations. I am not philosopher enough to 
determine the cause, but nothing I had ever seen 
before came up to it. The ecstasies poor Friday, 
my trusty savage, was in when he found his father 
in the boat came the Dearest to it; and the surprise 
of the master and his two companions, whom I de- 
livered from the villains that set them on shore in 
the island, came a little way towards it ; but noth- 
ing was to compare to this, either that I saw in 
Friday, or anywhere else in my life. 

It is further observable that these extravagancies 
did not show themselves in that different manner I 
have mentioned in different persons only, but all the 
variety would appear in a short succession of mo- 
ments in one and the same person. A man that we 
saw this minute dumb, and, as it were, stupid and 
confounded, should the next minute be dancing and 
hallooing like an antic ; and the next moment be 
tearing his hair, or pulling his ( lot Ik s to pieces, and 
stamping them under his feet like a madman ; and a 

[18] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



few moments after that we should have him all in 
tears, then sick, then swooning; and had not immedi- 
ate help been had would, in a few moments more, 
have been dead. And thus it was, not with one or 
two, or ten or twenty, but with the greatest part of 
them ; and, if I remember right, our surgeon was 
obliged to let above thirty of them blood. 

There were two priests among them, one an old 
man, and the other a young man ; and that which was 
strangest was, that the oldest man was the worst. As 
soon as he set his foot on board our ship, and saw 
himself safe, he dropped down stone dead, not the 
least sign of life could be perceived in him. Our 
surgeon immediately applied proper remedies to re- 
cover him, and was the only man in the ship that 
believed he was not dead. At length he opened a 
vein in his arm, having first chafed and rubbed the 
part, so as to warm it as much as possible. Upon 
this the blood, which only dropped at first, flowed 
something freely. In three minutes after the man 
opened his eyes ; and about a quarter of an hour 
after that he spoke, grew better, and, in a little time, 
quite well. After the blood was stopped he walked 
about, and told us he was perfectly well, took a dram 
of cordial which the surgeon gave him, and was what 
we called, come to himself. About a quarter of an 
hour after they came running into the cabin to the 
surgeon, who was bleeding a French woman that had 
fainted, and told him the priest was gone stark mad. 
It seems he had begun to revolve the change of his 
circumstance, and again this put him into an ecstasy 
of joy ; his spirits whirled about faster than the ves- 
sels could convey them ; the blood grew hot and 
feverish ; and the man was as fit for Bedlam as any 
creature that ever was in it. The surgeon would not 
bleed him again in that condition, but gave him 
something to doze and put him to sleep, which, after 

[19] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



sonic time, operated upon him, and he waked the 
next morning perfectly composed and well. 

The younger priest behaved with great command 
of his passions, and was really an example of a 
serious, well-governed mind. At his first coming 
on board the ship he threw himself flat on his face, 
prostrating himself in thankfulness for his deliver- 
ance, in which I unhappily and unseasonably dis- 
turbed him, really thinking he had been in a swoon ; 
but he spake calmly, thanked me, told me he was 
giving God thanks for his deliverance, and begged 
me to leave him a few moments, and that next to his 
Maker he would give me thanks also. 

I was heartily sorry that I disturbed him, and not 
only left him, but kept othei-s from interrupting him 
also. He continued in that posture about three 
minutes, or a little more, after I left him, then came 
to me, as he had said he would, and with a great deal 
of seriousness and affection, but with tears in his eyes, 
thanked me that had, under God, given him and so 
many miserable creatures their lives. I told him I 
had no room to move him to thank God for it rather 
than me; but I added, that it was nothing but what 
reason and humanity dictated to all men, and that 
we had as much reason as he to give thanks to God, 
who had blessed us so far as to make us the instru- 
ments of His mercy to so many of I lis creatures. 

After this the young priest applied himself to his 
country-folks ; laboured to compose them ; persuaded, 
entreated, argued, reasoned with them, and did his 
utmost to keep them within the exercise of their 
reason ; and with some he had success, though others 
were, for a time, out of all government of them- 
selves. 

I cannot help committing this to writing, as per- 
haps it may be useful to those into whose hands 
it may fall, for the guiding themselves in all the 

[20] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



extravagancies of their passions ; for if an excess of 
joy can carry men out to such a length beyond the 
reach of their reason, what will not the extrava- 
gancies of anger, rage, and a provoked mind carry us 
to ? And, indeed, here I saw reason for keeping an 
exceeding watch over our passions of every kind, as 
well those of joy and satisfaction, as those of sorrow 
and anger. 

We were something disordered by these extrava- 
gancies among our new guests for the first day ; 
but when they had been retired, lodgings provided 
for them as well as our ship would allow, and they 
had slept heartily, as most of them did, they were 
quite another sort of people the next day. 

Nothing of good manners, or civil acknowledg- 
ments for the kindness shown them, was wanting. 
The French, 't is known, are naturally apt to exceed 
that way. The captain and one of the priests came 
to me the next day ; and desiring to speak with me 
and my nephew, the commander, began to consult 
with us what should be done with them ; and first 
they told us, that as we had saved their lives, so all 
they had was little enough for a return to us for 
that kindness received. The captain said they had 
saved some money and some things of value in their 
boats, catched hastily up out of the flames ; and if 
we would accept it, they were ordered to make an 
offer of it all to us ; they only desired to be set on 
shore somewhere in our way, where, if possible, they 
might get passage to France. 

My nephew was for accepting their money at first 
word, and to consider what to do with them after- 
wards ; but I overruled him in that part, for I knew 
what it was to be set on shore in a strange country ; 
and if the Portugal captain that took me up at sea 
had served me so, and took all I had for my deliver- 
ance, I must have starved, or have been as much a 

[21] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



slave at the Brazils as I had been in Barbary, the 
mere being sold to a Mahometan excepted; and 
pe rhaps a Portuguese is not much a better master 
than a Turk, if not, in some cases, a much worse. 

I therefore told the French captain that we had 
taken them up in their distress, it was true ; but 
that it was our duty to do so, as we were fellow- 
creatures, and as we would desire to be so delivered, 
if we were in the like or any other extremity ; that 
we had done nothing for them but what we believed 
they would have done for us, if we had been in their 
case and they in ours ; but that we took them up to 
save them, not to plunder them ; and it would be a 
most barbarous thing to take that little from them 
which they saved out of the (ire, and then set them 
on shore and leave them ; that this wouid be first to 
save them from death, and then to 1'ill them our- 
selves; save them from drowning and abandon them 
to starving; and therefore I would not let the least 
thing be taken from them. As to setting them on 
shore, I told them indeed that was an exceeding 
difficulty to us, for that the ship was bound to the 
East Indies ; and though we were driven out of our 
course to the westward a very great way, and per- 
haps were directed by Heaven on purpose for their 
deliverance, yet it was impossible for us wilfully to 
change our voyage on this particular account ; nor 
could my nephew, the captain, answer it to the 
freighters, with whom he was under charter-party to 
pursue his voyage by the way of Brazil ; ana all 
I knew we could do for them was, to put ourselves 
in the way of meeting with other ships homeward- 
bound from the West Indies, and get them passage, 
if possible, to England or France. 

The first part of the proposal was so generous and 
kind, they could not but Ixj very thankful for it; but 
they were in a very great consternation, especially the 

[22] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



passengers, at the notion of being carried away to the 
East Indies ; and they then entreated me that, seeing 
I was driven so far to the westward before I met with 
them, I would at least keep on the same course to 
the banks of Newfoundland, where it was probable I 
might meet with some ship or sloop that they might 
hire to carry them back to Canada, from whence 
they came. 

I thought this was but a reasonable request on 
their part, and therefore I inclined to agree to it ; 
for indeed I considered that to carry this whole com- 
pany to the East Indies would not only be an intol- 
erable severity upon the poor people, but would be 
ruining our whole voyage by devouring all our pro- 
visions ; so I thought it no breach of charter-party, 
but what an unforeseen accident made absolutely 
necessary to us, and in which no one could say we 
were to blame : for the laws of God and Nature 
would have forbid that we should refuse to take up 
two boats full of people in such a distressed condi- 
tion ; and the nature of the thing, as well respecting 
ourselves as the poor people, obliged us to set them 
on shore somewhere or other for their deliver- 
ance. So I consented that we should carry them to 
Newfoundland, if wind and weather would permit ; 
and, if not, that I would carry them to Martinico, 
in the West Indies. 

The wind continued fresh easterly, but the weather 
pretty good ; and as the winds had continued in the 
points between N.E. and S.E. a long time, we missed 
several opportunities of sending them to France ; for 
we met several ships bound to Europe, whereof two 
were French, from St. Christopher's ; but they had 
been so long beating up against the wind, that they 
durst take in no passengers for fear of wanting pro- 
visions for the voyage, as well for themselves as for 
those they should take in, so we were obliged to go 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



on. It was about a week after this that we made the 
banks of Newfoundland, where, to shorten my story, 
we put all our French people on board a bark, which 
they hired at sea there, to put them on shore, and 
afterwards to carry them to France, if they could get 
provisions to victual themselves with. When I say 
all the French went on shore, I should remember 
that the young priest I spoke of, hearing we were 
bound to the East Indies, desired to go the voyage 
with us, and to be set on shore on the coast of Cor- 
nmandel, which I readily agreed to, for I wonderfully 
liked the man, and had very good reason, as will 
appear afterwards ; also four of the seamen entered 
themselves on our ship, and proved very useful 
fellow s. 

From hence we directed our course to the West 
Indies, steering away S. and S. by E. for about 
twenty days together, sometimes little or no wind 
at all, when we met with another subject for our 
humanity to work upon, almost as deplorable as that 
before. 

It was in the latitude of 27 degrees 5 minutes N., 
and the 19th day of March 1694-95, when we espied 
a sail, our course S. E. and by S. We soon per- 
ceived it was a large vessel, and that she bore up to 
us; but could not at first know what to make of her 
till, after coming a little nearer, we found she had 
lost her maintopm.ost, foremast, and bowsprit ; and 
presently she fired a gun as a signal of distress. The 
weather was pretty good, wind at N. N. W. a fresh 
gale, and we soon came to speak with her. 

We found her a ship of Bristol bound home from 
Rubadoes, but had been blown out of the road at 
Barbadoes, a few days before she was ready to sail, 
by a terrible hurricane, while the captain and chief 
mate were both gone on shore ; so that besides the 
terror of the storm, they were but in an indifferent 

t24] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



case for good artists to bring the ship home. They 
had been already nine weeks at sea, and had met 
with another terrible storm after the hurricane was 
over, which had blown them quite out of their knowl- 
edge to the westward, and in which they lost their 
masts, as above. They told us they expected to 
have seen the Bahama Islands, but were then driven 
away again to the south-east by a strong gale of 
wind at N.N.W., the same that blew now, and hav- 
ing no sails to work the ship with but a main-course, 
and a kind of square sail upon a jury-foremast, which 
they had set up, they could not lie near the wind, 
but were endeavouring to stand away for the Canaries. 

But that which was worst of all was, that they 
were almost starved for want of provisions, besides the 
fatigues they had undergone. Their bread and flesh 
was quite gone, they had not one ounce left in the 
ship, and had had none for eleven days. The only 
relief they had was, their water was not all spent, and 
they had about half a barrel of flour left ; they had 
sugar enough ; some succades or sweetmeats they had 
at first, but they were devoured ; and they had seven 
casks of rum. 

There was a youth and his mother and a maid- 
servant on board, who were going passengers, and 
thinking the ship was ready to sail unhappily came on 
board the evening before the hurricane began ; and 
having no provisions of their own left, they were in a 
more deplorable condition than the rest ; for the sea- 
men, being reduced to such an extreme necessity 
themselves, had no compassion, we may be sure, for 
the poor passengers ; and they were indeed in a con- 
dition that their misery is very hard to describe. 

I had perhaps not known this part if my curiosity 
had not led me, the weather being fair, and the wind 
abated, to go on board the ship. The second mate, 
who upon this occasion commanded the ship, had been 

[25] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



on board our ship ; and he told me indeed, they had 
three passengers in the great cabin, that were in a de- 
plorable condition. " Nay," says he, "I believe they 
are dead, for I have heard nothing of them for above 
two days ; and I was afraid to inquire after them," 
said he, " for I had nothing to relieve them with." 

We immediately applied ourselves to give them 
what relief we could spare ; and indeed I had so far 
overruled things with my nephew, that I would 
have victualled them, though we had gone away to 
Virginia, or any part of the coast of America, to 
have supplied ourselves ; but there was no necessity 
for that. 

But now they were in a new (Linger, for they were 
afraid of eating too much, even of that little we gave 
them. The mate, or commander, brought six men 
with him in his boat, but these poor wretches looked 
like skeletons, and were so weak, they could hardly 
sit to their oars. The mate himself was very ill, and 
half starved, for he declared he had reserved nothing 
from the men, and went share and share alike with 
them in every bit they ate. 

I cautioned him to eat Sparingly, but set meat 
before him immediately, and he had not eaten three 
mouthfuls before he began to be sick, and out of 
order; so he stopped a while, and our surgeon mixed 
him up something with some broth, which he said 
would be to him both food and physic ; and after he 
had taken it, he grew better. In the meantime, I for- 
got not the men. I ordered victuals to be given them, 
and the poor creatures rather devoured than eat it ; 
they were so exceeding hungry, that they were in a 
kind ravenous, and had no command of themselves; 
and two of them eat with so much greediness, that 
they were in danger of their lives the next morning. 

The sight of these people's distress was very mov- 
ing to me, and brought to mind what I had a terrible 

[2CJ 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



prospect of at my first coming on shore in the island, 
where I had neither the least mouthful of food, or 
any prospect of procuring any, besides the hourly 
apprehension I had of being made the food of other 
creatures. But all the while the mate was thus re- 
lating to me the miserable condition of the ship's 
company, I could not put out of my thought the 
story he had told me of the three poor creatures in 
the great cabin, viz., the mother, her son, and the 
maid-servant, whom he had heard nothing of for two 
or three days, and whom he seemed to confess they 
had wholly neglected, their own extremities being 
so great ; by which I understood, that they had 
really given them no food at all, and that there- 
fore they must be perished, and be all lying dead 
perhaps on the floor or deck of the cabin. 

As I therefore kept the mate, whom we then 
called captain, on board with his men, to refresh 
them, so I also forgot not the starving crew that 
were left on board, but ordered my own boat to go 
on board the ship, and with my mate and twelve 
men to carry them a sack of bread, and four or five 
pieces of beef to boil. Our surgeon charged the 
men to cause the meat to be boiled while they 
stayed, and to keep guard in the cook-room, to pre- 
vent the men taking it to eat raw, or taking it out 
of the pot before it was well boiled, and then to 
give every man but a very little at a time ; and 
by this caution he preserved the men, who would 
otherwise have killed themselves with that very food 
that was given them on purpose to save their lives. 

At the same time I ordered the mate to go into 
the great cabin, and see what condition the poor 
passengers were in, and if they were alive to com- 
fort them, and give them what refreshment was 
proper ; and the surgeon gave him a large pitcher 
with some of the prepared broth which he had given 

[27] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



the mate that was on board, and which he did not 
question would restore them gradually. 

I was not satisfied with this ; but, as I said above, 
having a great mind to see the scene of misery, 
which I knew the ship itself would present me with, 
in a mote lively manner than I could have it by re- 
port, I took the captain of the ship, as we now 
called him, with me, and went myself a little after 
in their boat. 

I found the poor men on board almost in a 
tumult to get the victuals out of the boiler before it 
was ready ; but my mate observed his order, and 
kept a good guard at the cook-room door ; and the 
man he placed there, after using all possible per- 
suasion to have patience, kept them off by force. 
However, be caused some biscuit-cakes to be dipped 
in the pot, and softened with the liquor of the meat, 
which they called brews, and gave them every one 
one, to stay their stomachs, and told them it was for 
their own safety that lie was obliged to give them 
but a little at a time. Rut it was all in vain ; and 
had I not come on board, and their own commander 
and officers with me, and with good words, and some 
threats also of giving them no more, I believe they 
would have broke into the cook-room by force, and 
tore the meat out of the furnace ; for words are indeed 
of very small force to a hungry tally. However, we 
pacified them, and fed them gradually and cautiously 
for the first time, and the next time gave them 
more, and at last filled their bellies, and the men did 
well enough. 

But the misery of the poor passengers in the 
cabin was of another nature, and far beyond the 
rest ; for as first the ship's company had so little for 
themselves, it was but too true that they had at first 
kept them very low, and at last totally neglected 
them ; so that for six or seven days, it might be

ROBINSON CRUSOE 



said, they had really had no food at all, and for 
several days before very little. The poor mother, 
who, as the men reported, was a woman of good 
sense and good breeding, had spared all she eould 
get so affeetionately for her son, that at last she 
entirely sunk under it ; and when the mate of our 
ship went in, she sat upon the floor or deck, with her 
back up against the sides, between two chairs, which 
were lashed fast, and her head sunk in between her 
shoulders, like a corpse, though not quite dead. 
My mate said all he could to revive and encourage 
her, and with a spoon put some broth into her 
mouth. She opened her lips, and lifted up one hand, 
but could not speak ; yet she understood what he 
said, and made signs to him, intimating that it was 
too late for her, but pointed to her child, as if she 
would have said they should take care of him. 

However, the mate, who was exceedingly moved 
with the sight, endeavoured to get some of the broth 
into her mouth ; and, as he said, got two or three 
spoonfuls down, though I question whether he could 
be sure of it or not ; but it was too late, and she died 
the same night. 

The youth, who was preserved at the price of his 
most affectionate mother's life, was not so far gone ; 
yet he lay in a cabin-bed as one stretched out, with 
hardly any life left in him. He had a piece of an 
old glove in his mouth, having eaten up the rest of 
it. However, being young, and having more strength 
than his mother, the mate got something down his 
throat, and he began sensibly to revive, though, by 
giving him some time after but two or three spoon- 
fuls extraordinary, he was very sick, and brought it 
up again. 

But the next care was the poor maid. She lay all 
along upon the deck hard by her mistress, and just 
like one that had fallen down with an apoplexy, and 

[29] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



struggled for life. Her limbs were distorted, one of 
her hands was clasped round the frame of a chair, 
and she gripped it so hard, that we could not easily 
make her let go. Her other arm lay over her head, 
and her feet lay both together, set fast against the 
frame of the cabin-table. In short, she lay just like 
one in the last agonies of death ; and yet she was 
alive too. 

The poor creature was not only starved with hunger, 
and terrified with the thoughts of death, but, as the 
men told us afterwards, was broken-hearted for her 
mistress, whom she saw dying for two or three days 
before, and whom she loved most tenderly. 

We knew not what to do with this poor girl ; for 
when our surgeon, who was a man of very great 
knowledge and experience, had with great application 
recovered her as to life, he had her upon his hand as 
to her senses, for she was little less than distracted 
for a considerable time after, as shall appear presently. 

Whoever shall read these memorandums, must be 
desired to consider that visits at sea are not like a 
journey into the country, where sometimes people 
stav a week or a fortnight at a place. Our business 
was to relieve this distressed ship's crew, but not to 
lie by for them ; and though they were willing to 
steer the same course with us for some days, yet we 
could cany no sail to keep pace with a ship that had 
no masts. However, as their captain begged of us 
to help him to set up a main-topmast, and a kind of 
a topmast to his jury-foremast, we did, as it were, 
lie by him for three or four days ; and then having 
given him five barrels of beef, and a barrel of pork, 
two hogsheads of biscuit, and a proportion of peas, 
flour, and what other things we could spare ; and 
biking three casks of sugar, some rum, and some 
pieces of eight of them for satisfaction, we left them, 
taking on board with us, at their own earnest re- 

[30] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



quest, the priest, the youth, and the maid, and all 
their goods. 

The young lad was about seventeen years of age, 
a pretty, well-bred, modest, and sensible youth ; 
greatly dejected with the loss of his mother, and, as 
it seems, had lost his father but a few months before 
at Barbadoes. He begged of the surgeon to speak 
to me to take him out of the ship ; for, he said, the 
cruel fellows had murdered his mother ; and indeed 
so they had, that is to say, passively ; for they might 
have spared a small sustenance to the poor helpless 
widow, that might have preserved her life, though it 
had been but just to keep hei alive. But hunger 
knows no friend, no relation, no justice, no right, 
and therefore is remorseless, and capable of no 
compassion. 

The surgeon told him how far we were going, and 
how it would carry him away from all his friends, 
and put him perhaps in as bad circumstances, almost, 
as those we found him in ; that is to say, starving in 
the world. He said he mattered not whither he 
went, if he was but delivered from the terrible crew 
he was among ; that the captain (by which he meant 
me, for he could know nothing of my nephew) had 
saved his life, and he was sure would not hurt him ; 
and as for the maid, he was sure, if she came to her- 
self, she would be very thankful for it, let us carry 
them where we would. The surgeon represented the 
case so affectionately to me that I yielded, and we 
took them both on board, with all their goods, ex- 
cept eleven hogsheads of sugar, which could not be 
removed, or come at ; and as the youth had a bill 
of lading for them, I made his commander sign a 
writing, obliging himself to go, as soon as he came 
to Bristol, to one Mr. Rogers, a merchant there, to 
whom the youth said he was related, and to deliver 
a letter which I wrote to him, and all the goods he 

[31] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



had belonging to the deceased widow ; which I sup- 
pose was not done ; for I could never learn that the 
ship came to Bristol, but was, as is most probable, 
lost at sea, being in so disabled a condition, and so 
far from any land, that I am of opinion the first 
storm she met with afterwards she might founder in 
the sea ; for she was leaky, and had damage in her 
hold when we met with her. 

I was now in the latitude of 19 degrees 32 minutes, 
and had hitherto had a tolerable voyage as to 
weather, though at first the winds had been contrary. 
I shall trouble nobody with the little incidents of 
wind, weather, currents, &c, on the rest of our 
voyage ; but shortening niv story for the sake of what 
is to follow, shall observe that I came to my old 
habitation, the island, on the 10th of April 1695. 
It was with no small difficulty that I found the 
place; for as I came to it, and went from it before, 
on the south and cast side of the island, as coming 
from the Brazils ; bo now, coming in between the 
main and the island, and having no chart for the 
coast, nor any land mark, I did not know it when I 
saw it, or know whether I saw it or no. 

We beat about a great while, and went on shore on 
several islands in the mouth of the great river Oro- 
Dooque, but none for my purpose ; only this I learned 
by my coasting the shore, that I was under one 
great mistake before, viz., that the continent which 
I thought I saw from the island I lived in was really 
no continent, but a long island, or rather a ridge of 
islands, reaching from one to the other side of the 
extended mouth of that great river ; and that the 
savages who came to my island were not properly 
those which we called Caribbees, but islanders, and 
other barbarians of the same kind, who inhabited 
something nearer to our side than the rest. 

In short, I visited several of these islands to no 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



purpose ; some I found were inhabited, and some 
were not. On one of them I found some Spaniards, 
and thought they had lived there ; but speaking 
with them, I found they had a sloop lay in a small 
creek hard by, and they came thither to make salt, 
and to catch some pearl- mussels, if they could ; but 
that they belonged to the Isle de Trinidad, which 
lay farther north, in the latitude of 10 and 11 
degrees. 

But at last coasting from one island to another, 
sometimes with the ship, sometimes with the French- 
man's shallop, which we had found a convenient boat, 
and therefore kept her with their very good will, at 
length I came fair on the south side of my island, and 
I presently knew the very countenance of the place ; 
so I brought the ship safe to an anchor broadside 
with the little creek where was my old habitation. 

As soon as I saw the place I called for Friday, 
and asked him if he knew where he was ? He looked 
about a little, and presently clapping his hands cried, 
44 O yes, O there, O yes, O there ! " pointing to our 
old habitation, and fell a-dancing and capering like 
a mad fellow ; and I had much ado to keep him from 
jumping into the sea, to swim ashore to the place. 

" Well, Friday,'' 1 says I, 44 do you think we shall 
find anybody here, or no ? And what do you think : 
shall we see your father ? " The fellow stood mute 
as a stock a good while ; but when I named his father, 
the poor affectionate creature looked dejected, and I 
could see the tears run down his face very plentifully. 
" What is the matter, Friday ? " says I ; 44 are you 
troubled because you may see your father ? w 44 No, 
no," says he, shaking his head, " no see him more, no 
ever more see again." " Why so," said I, 44 Friday ? 
how do you know that ? " — 44 O no, O no," says 
Friday, 44 he long ago die ; long ago, he much old 
man." 44 Well, well," said I, 44 Friday, you dont 

VOL. II.— 3 [33] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 

know; but shall we see anyone else then? " The 
fellow, it seems, had better eyes than I, and he points 
just to the hill above my old house ; and though we 
lay half a league off, he cries out, " We see ! we see ! 
yes, we see much men there, and there, and there. 1 ' 
I looked, but I could see nobody, no, not with a per- 
spective glass ; which was, I suppose, because I could 
not hit the place ; for the fellow was right, as I found 
upon inquiry the next day, and there was five or six 
men altogether stood to look at the ship, not knowing 
what to think of us. 

As soon as Friday had told me he saw people, I 
caused the English ancient to be spread, and fired 
three guns, to give them notice we were friends ; and 
in about half a quarter of an hour after, we perceived 
a smoke rise from the side of the creek. So I im- 
mediately ordered a boat out, taking Friday with 
me ; and hanging out a white flag, or flag of truce, I 
went directly on shore, taking with me the young 
friar I mentioned, to whom I had told the whole 
story of my living there, and the manner of it, and 
every particular both of myself and those I left there, 
and who was on that account extremely desirous to 
go with me. We had besides about sixteen men 
very well armed, if we had found any new guests 
there which we did not know of ; but we had no need 
of weapons. 

As we went on shore upon the tide of flood near 
high-water, we rowed directly into the creek ; and 
the first man I fixed my eyes upon was the Spaniard 
whose life I had saved, and whom I knew by his face 
perfectly well ; as to his habit, I shall describe it 
afterwards. I ordered nobody to go on shore at 
first but myself ; but there was no keeping Friday in 
the boat ; for the affectionate creature had spied his 
father at a distance, a good way off of the Spaniards, 
where indeed I saw nothing of him ; and if they had 

[34] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



not let him go on shore, he would have jumped into 
the sea. He was no sooner on shore, but he flew 
away to his father like an arrow out of a bow. It 
would have made any man have shed tears, in spite 
of the firmest resolution, to have seen the first trans- 
ports of this poor fellow's joy when he came to his 
father ; how he embraced him, kissed him, stroked 
his face, took him up in his arms, set him down upon 
a tree, and lay down by him ; then stood and looked 
at him as any one would look at a strange picture, 
for a quarter of an hour together ; then lie down on 
the ground, and stroke his legs, and kiss them, and 
then get up again, and stare at him ; one would have 
thought the fellow bewitched ; but it would have 
made a dog laugh to see how the next day his passion 
run out another way. In the morning he walked 
along the shore, to and again, with his father, several 
hours, always leading him by the hand as if he had 
been a lady ; and every now and then he would come 
to fetch something or other for him to the boat, 
either a lump of sugar, or a dram, a biscuit-cake, or 
something or other that was good. In the afternoon 
his frolics ran another way ; for then he would set 
the old man down upon the ground, and dance about 
him, and make a thousand antic postures and ges- 
tures ; and all the while he did this he would be 
talking to him, and telling him one story or another 
of his travels, and of what had happened to him 
abroad, to divert him. In short, if the same filial 
affection was to be found in Christians to their 
parents in our part of the world, one would be 
tempted to say there would hardly have been any 
need of the fifth commandment. 

But this is a digression ; I return to my landing. 
It would be endless to take notice of all the cere- 
monies and civilities that the Spaniards received me 
with. The first Spaniard, whom, as I said, I knew 

[35] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



very well, was he whose life I had saved. He came 
towards the boat, attended by one more, carrying a 
Bag of truce also ; and he did not only not know me at 
first, but he had no thoughts, no notion, of its being 
nie that was come till I spoke to him. " Seignior," 
said I, in Portuguese, " do you not know me ? " 
At Which he spoke not a word ; but giving his 
musket to the man that was with him, threw his 
arms abroad, and saying something in Spanish that 
I did not perfectly hear, comes forward, and embraced 
me, telling me he was inexcusable not to know that 
lace again that he had once seen, as of an angel from 
heaven sent to save his life. He said abundance of 
very handsome things, as a well-bred Spaniard always 
knows how ; and then beckoning to the person that 
attended him, bade him go and call out his comrades. 
He then asked me if I would walk to my old habita- 
tion, where he would give me possession of my own 
house again, and where I should see there had been 
but mean improvements ; so I walked along with him. 
But alas ! I could no more find the place again than 
if I had never been there ; for they had planted so 
many trees, and placed them in such a posture, so 
thick and close to one another, and in ten years' time 
they were grown so big, that, in short, the place was 
inaccessible, except by such windings and blind ways 
as they themselves only who made them could find. 

I asked them what put them upon all these fortifi- 
cations ? He told me I would say there was need 
enough of it when they had given mean account how 
they had passed their time since their arriving in the 
island, especially after they had the misfortune to find 
that I was gone. He told me he could not but have 
some satisfaction in my good fortune when he heard 
that I was gone away in a good ship, and to my satis- 
faction ; and that he had oftentimes a strong persua- 
sion that one time or other he should see me again ;

ROBINSON CRUSOE 



but nothing that ever befell him in his life, he said, 
was so surprising and afflicting to him at first, as the 
disappointment he was under when he came back to 
the island, and found I was not there. 

As to the three barbarians (so he called them) that 
were left behind, and of whom he said he had a long 
story to tell me, the Spaniards all thought themselves 
much better among the savages, only that their num- 
ber was so small. " And," says he, " had they been 
strong enough, we had been all long ago in purga- 
torv ; V and with that he crossed himself on the breast. 
u But, sir," says he, " 1 hope you will not be displeased 
when I shall tell you how, forced by necessity, we 
were obliged, for our own preservation, to disarm 
them, and make them our subjects, who would not 
be content with being moderately our masters, but 
would be our murderers." I answered, I was heartily 
afraid of it when I left them there ; and nothing 
troubled me at my parting from the island but that 
they were not come back, that I might have put them 
in possession of everything first, and left the other 
in a state of subjection, as they deserved ; but if they 
had reduced them to it, I was very glad, and should 
be very far from finding any fault with it ; for I knew 
they were a parcel of refractory, ungoverned villains, 
and were fit for any manner of mischief. 

While I was saying this, came the man whom he 
had sent back, and with him eleven men more. In 
the distress they were in, it was impossible to guess 
what nation they were of; but he made all clear 
both to them and to me. First he turned to me, 
and pointing to them said, " These, sir, are some of 
the gentlemen who owe their lives to you ; " and 
then turning to them, and pointing to me, he let 
them know who I was ; upon which they all came 
up one by one, not as if they had been sailors, and 
ordinary fellows, and I the like, but really as if they 

[37] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



had been ambassadors of noblemen, and I a monarch 
or a great conqueror. Their behaviour was to the 
last degree obliging and courteous, and jet mixed 
with a manly, majestic gravity, which very well be- 
came them ; and, in short, they had so much more 
manners than I, that I scarce knew how to receive their 
civilities, much less how to return them in kind. 

The history of their coming to, and conduct in, 
the island after my going away is so very remark- 
able, and has so many incidents which the former 
part of my relation will help to understand, and 
which will, in most of the particulars, refer to that 
account I have already given, that I cannot but 
commit them with great delight to the reading of 
those that come after me. 

I shall no longer trouble the story with a relation 
in the first person, which will put me to the expense 
of ten thousand said I 's, and said he's, and he told 
me's, and I told hum's, and the like; but I shall 
collect the facts historically as near as I can gather 
them out of my memory from what they related to 
me, and from what I met with in my conversing 
with them, and with the place. 

In order to do this succinctly, and as intelligibly 
as I can, I must go back to the circumstance in 
which I left the island, and in which the persons 
were of whom I am to speak. And first it is neces- 
sary to repeat, that I had sent away Friday's father 
and the Spaniard, the two whose lives I had rescued 
from the savages ; I say, I had sent them away in a 
large canoe to the main, as I then thought it, to 
fetch over the Spaniard's companions whom he had 
left behind him, in order to save them from the like 
calamity that he had been in, and in order to suc- 
cour them for the present, and that, if possible, we 
might together fina some way for our deliverance 
afterward. 

[38] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



When I sent them away, I had no visible appear- 
ance of, or the least room to hope for, my own de- 
liverance, any more than I had twenty years before ; 
much less had I any foreknowledge of what after- 
wards happened, I mean of an English ship coming 
on shore there to fetch me off ; and it could not but 
be a very great surprise to them when they came 
back, not only to find that I was gone, but to find 
three strangers left on the spot, possessed of all that 
I had left behind me, which would otherwise have 
been their own. 

The first thing, however, which I inquired into, 
that I might begin where I left off, was of their own 
part ; and I desired he would give me a particular 
account of his voyage back to his countrymen with 
the boat, when I sent him to fetch them over. He 
told me there was little variety in that part ; for 
nothing remarkable happened to them on the way, 
they having very calm weather and a smooth sea ; 
for his countrymen it could not be doubted, he said, 
but that they were overjoyed to see him. (It seems 
he was the principal man among them, the captain 
of the vessel they had been shipwrecked in having 
been dead some time.) They were, he said, the 
more surprised to see him, because they knew that 
he was fallen into the hands of the savages, who, 
they were satisfied, would devour him, as they did 
all the rest of the prisoners ; that when he told them 
the story of his deliverance, and in what manner he 
was furnished for carrying them away, it was like a 
dream to them ; and their astonishment, they said, 
was something like that of Joseph's brethren, when 
he told them who he was, and told them the story 
of his exaltation in Pharaoh's court ; but when he 
showed them the arms, the powder, the ball, and the 
provisions that he brought them for their journey 
or voyage, they were restored to themselves, took a 

[39] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



just share of the joy of their deliverance, and imme- 
diately prepared to come away with him. 

Their first business was to get canoes ; and in this 
they were obliged not to stick so much upon the 
honest part of it, but to trespass upon their friendly 
savages, and to borrow two large canoes, or periaguas, 
on pretence of going out a-fishing, or for pleasure. 

In these they came away the next morning. It 
seems they wanted no time to get themselves ready, 
for they had no baggage, neither clothes, or pro- 
visions, or anything in the world, but what they had 
on them, and a few roots to eat, of which they used 
to make their bread. 

They were in all three weeks absent, and in that 
time, unluckily for them, I had the occasion offered 
for my escape, as I mentioned in my other part, and 
to get off from the island ; leaving three of the most 
impudent, hardened, ungoverned, disagreeable villains 
behind me that any man could desire to meet with, 
to the poor Spaniards' great grief and disappoint- 
ment, you may be sure. 

The only just thing the rogues did was, that when 
the Spaniards came on shore they gave my letter to 
them, and gave them provisions and other relief, as I 
had ordered them to do ; also they gave them the 
long paper of directions, which I had left with them, 
containing the particular methods which I took for 
managing every part of my life there ; the way how 
I baked my bread, bred up tame goats, and planted 
my corn ; how I cured my grapes, made my pots, 
and, in a word, everything I did. All this being 
written down, they gave to the Spaniards, two of 
whom understood English well enough ; nor did they 
refuse to accommodate the Spaniards with everything 
else, for they agreed very well for some time. They 
gave them an equal admission into the house, or 
cave, and they began to live very sociably ; and the 

[40] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



head Spaniard, who had seen pretty much of my 
methods, and Friday's father together, managed all 
their affairs; for as for the Englishmen, they did 
nothing but ramble about the island, shoot parrots, 
and catch tortoises, and when they came home at 
night, the Spaniards provided their suppers for 
them. 

The Spaniards would have been satisfied with 
this, would the other but have let them alone ; 
which, however, they could not find in their hearts 
to do long ; but like the dog in the manger, they 
would not eat themselves, and would not let others 
eat neither. The differences, nevertheless, were at 
first but trivial, and such as are not worth relating ; 
but at last it broke out into open war, and it begun 
with all the rudeness and insolence that can be 
imagined, without reason, without provocation, con- 
trary to nature, and indeed to common-sense ; and 
though, it is true, the first relation of it came from 
the Spaniards themselves, whom I may call the ac- 
cusers, yet when I came to examine the fellows, they 
could not deny a word of it. 

But before I come to the particulars of this part, 
I must supply a defect in my former relation ; and 
this was, that I forgot to set down among the rest, 
that just as we were weighing the anchor to set sail, 
there happened a little quarrel on board our ship, 
which I was afraid once would have turned to a 
second mutiny ; nor was it appeased till the captain, 
rousing up his courage, and taking us all to his 
assistance, parted them by force, and making two of 
the most refractory fellows prisoners, he laid them 
in irons ; and as they had been active in the former 
disorders, and let fall some dangerous ugly words 
the second time, he threatened to carry them in 
irons to England, and have them hanged there for 
mutiny, and running away with the ship. 

[41 j 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



This, it seems, though the captain did not intend 
to do it, frighted some other men in the ship ; and 
some of them had put it into the heads of the rest 
that the captain only gave them good words for the 
present till they should come to some English port, 
and that then they should be all put into gaol, and 
tried for their lives. 

The mate got intelligence of this, and acquainted 
us with it ; upon which it was desired that I, who 
still passed for a great man among them, should go 
down with the mate and satisfy the men, and tell 
them that they might be assured, if they behaved 
well the rest of the voyage, all they had done for 
the time past should be pardoned. So I went, and 
after passing my honour's word to them they ap- 
peared easy, and the more so when I caused the 
two men who were in irons to be released and 
forgiven. 

But this mutiny had brought us to an anchor for 
that night, the wind also falling calm. Next morn- 
ing we found that our two men who had been laid 
in irons had stole each of them a musket and some 
other weapons ; what powder or shot they had, we 
know not ; and had taKen the ship's pinnace, which 
was not yet hauled up, and ran away with her to 
their companions in roguery on shore. 

As soon as we found this, I ordered the longboat 
on shore, with twelve men and the mate, and away 
they went to seek the rogues ; but they could neither 
find them nor any of the rest ; for they all fled into 
the woods when they saw the boat coming on shore. 
The mate was once resolved, in justice to their 
roguery, to have destroyed their plantations, burnt 
all their household stuff and furniture, and left them 
to shift without it ; but having no order, he let it all 
alone, left everything as they found it, and bringing 
the pinnace away, came on board without them. 

[42] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



These two men made their number five ; but the 
other three villains were so much wickeder than 
these, that after they had been two or three days 
together, they turned their two new-comers out of 
doors to shift for themselves, and would have noth- 
ing to do with them ; nor could they, for a good 
while, be persuaded to give them any food. As for 
the Spaniards, they were not yet come. 

When the Spaniards came first on shore, the busi- 
ness began to go forward. The Spaniards would 
have persuaded the three English brutes to have 
taken in their two countrymen again, that, as they 
said, they might be all one family ; but they would 
not hear of it. So the two poor fellows lived by 
themselves ; and finding nothing but industry and 
application would make them live comfortably, they 
pitched their tents on the north shore of the island, 
but a little more on the west, to be out of the dan- 
ger of the savages, who always landed on the east 
parts of the island. 

Here they built them two huts, one to lodge in, 
and the other to lay up their magazines and stores 
in ; and the Spaniards having given them some corn 
for seed, and especially some of the peas which I had 
left them, they dug, and planted, and enclosed, after 
the pattern I had set for them all, and began to live 
pretty well. Their first crop of corn was on the 
ground ; and though it was but a little bit of land 
which they had dug up at first, having had but a 
little time, yet it was enough to relieve them, and 
find them with bread and other eatables ; and one of 
the fellows being the cook's mate of the ship, was 
very ready at making soup, puddings, and other such 
preparations as the rice and the milk, and such little 
flesh as they got, furnished him to do. 

They were going on in this little thriving posture, 
when the three unnatural rogues, their own country- 

[43] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



men too, in mere humour, and to insult them, came 
and bullied them, and told them the island was 
theirs ; that the governor, meaning me, had given 
them possession of it, and nobody else had any 
right to it ; and damn 'em, they should build no 
houses upon their ground, unless they would pay 
them rent for them. 

The two men thought they had jested at first, 
asked them to come in and sit down, and see what 
fine houses they were that they had built, and tell 
them what rent they demanded ; and one of them 
merrily told them if they were ground-landlords, he 
hoped if they built tenements upon their land and 
made improvements, they would, according to the 
custom of landlords, grant them a long lease ; and 
bid them go fetch a scrivener to draw the writings. 
One of the three, damning and raging, told them 
they should see they were not in jest; and going to 
a little place at a distance, where the honest men 
had made a fire to dress their victuals, he takes a 
firebrand, and claps it to the outside of their hut, 
and very fairly set it on fire ; and it would have been 
all burnt down in a few minutes, if one of the two 
had not run to the fellow, thrust him away, and trod 
the fire out with his feet, and that not without some 
diliiculty too. 

The fellow was in such a rage at the honest man's 
thrusting him away, that he returned upon him with 
a pole he had in his hand ; and had not the man 
avoided the blow very nimbly, and run into the hut, 
he had ended his days at once. His comrade, see- 
ing the danger they were both in, ran in after him, 
and immediately they came both out with their 
muskets ; and the man that was first struck at with 
the pole knocked the fellow down that had begun 
the quarrel with the stock of his musket, and that 
before the other two could come to help him ; and 

f 44 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



then seeing the rest come at them, they stood to- 
gether, and presenting the other ends of their pieces 
to them, bade them stand off. 

The other had firearms with them too ; but one of 
the two honest men, bolder than his comrade, and 
made desperate by his danger, told them if they 
offered to move hand or foot they were dead men, 
and boldly commanded them to lay down their arms. 
They did not indeed lay down their arms ; but see- 
ing him so resolute, it brought them to a parley, and 
they consented to take their wounded man with 
them, and be gone ; and, indeed, it seems the fellow 
was wounded sufficiently with the blow. However, 
they were much in the wrong, since they had the 
advantage, that they did not disarm them effect- 
ually, as they might have done, and have gone im- 
mediately to the Spaniards, and given them an 
account how the rogues had treated them ; for the 
three villains studied nothing but revenge, and every 
day gave them some intimation that they did so. 

But not to crowd this part with an account of the 
lesser part of their rogueries, such as treading down 
their corn, shooting three young kids and a she- 
goat, which the poor men had got to breed up tame 
for their store, and in a word, plaguing them night 
and day in this manner, it forced the two men to 
such a desperation, that they resolved to fight them 
all three the first time they had a fair opportunity. 
In order to this they resolved to go to the castle, as 
they called it, that was my old dwelling, where the 
three rogues and the Spaniards all lived together at 
that time, intending to have a fair battle, and the 
Spaniards should stand by to see fair play. So they 
got up in the morning before day, and came to the 
place, and called the Englishmen by their names, 
telling a Spaniard that answered that they wanted 
to speak with them. 

[45 J 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



It happened that the day before two of the Span- 
iards having been in the woods had seen one of the 
two Englishmen, whom for distinction I call the 
honest men, and he had made a sad complaint to 
the Spaniards of the barbarous usage they had met 
with from their three countrymen, and how they 
had ruined their plantation, and destroyed their 
coi n, that they had laboured so hard to bring for- 
ward, and killed the milch-goat and their three kids, 
which was all they had provided for their sustenance ; 
and that if he and his friends, meaning the Span- 
iards, did not assist them again, they should be 
starved. When the Spaniards came home at night, 
and they were all at supper, he took the freedom to 
reprove the three Englishmen, though in very gentle 
and mannerly terms, and asked them how they could 
be so cruel, they being harmless, inoffensive fellows, 
and that they were only putting themselves in a 
way to subsist by their labour, and that it had cost 
them a great deal of pains to bring things to such 
perfection as they had. 

One of the Englishmen returned very briskly, 
What had they to do there? that they came on 
shore without leave, and they should not plant or 
build upon the island ; it was none of their ground. 
k * Why, says the Spaniard, very calmly, " Seignior 
Inglese, they must not starve. The Englishman 
replied, like a true rough-hewn tarpaulin, " They 
might starve and be damned, they should not plant 
nor build."" " But what must they do then, sei- 
gnior ? " said the Spaniard. Another of the brutes 
returned, " Do ! d — n 'em, they should be servants, 
and work for them." u But how can you expect 
that of them ? " says the Spaniard ; " they are not 
bought with your money ; you have no right to 
make them servants." The Englishman answered, 
the island was theirs, the governor had given it to 

[46] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



them, and no man had anything to do there but 
themselves ; and with that swore by his Maker that 
they would go and burn all their new huts, they 
should build none upon their land. 

" Why, seignior," says the Spaniard, " by the 
same rule, we must be your servants too." " Ah," 
says the bold dog, " and so you shall too, before we 
have done with you ; " mixing two or three G — d 
damme "s in the proper intervals of his speech. The 
Spaniard only smiled at that, and made him no an- 
swer. However, this little discourse had heated 
them ; and starting up, one says to the other, I 
think it was he they called Will Atkins, " Come, 
Jack, let us go and have V other brush with them ; 
well demolish their castle, I'll warrant you; they 
shall plant no colony in our dominions." 

Upon this they went all trooping away, with every 
man a gun, a pistol, and a sword, and muttered some 
insolent things among themselves of what they would 
do to the Spaniards too when opportunity offered. 
But the Spaniards, it seems, did not so perfectly 
understand them as to know r all the particulars ; only 
that, in general, they threatened them hard for 
taking the two Englishmen's part. 

Whither they went, or how they bestowed their 
time that evening, the Spaniards said they did not 
know ; but it seems they wandered about the country 
part of the night ; and then lying down in the place 
which I used to call my bower, they were weary, and 
overslept themselves. The case was this : they had 
resolved to stay till midnight, and so to take the 
two poor men when they were asleep ; and as they 
acknowledged afterwards, intended to set fire to 
their huts while they were in them and either burn 
them in them, or murder them, as they came out ; 
and as malice seldom sleeps very sound, it was very 
strange they should not have been kept waking. 

[47] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 

However, as the two men had also a design upon 
them, as I have said, though a much fairer one than 
that of burning and murdering, it happened, and very 
luckily for them all, that they were up and gone abroad, 
before the bloody-minded rogues came to their huts. 

When they came there and found the men gone, 
Atkins, who it seems was the forwardest man, called 
out to his comrades, "Ha! Jack, here's the nest, 
but d — n 'em, the birds are flown." They mused 
awhile to think what should be the occasion of their 
being gone abroad so soon, and suggested presently 
that the Spaniards had given them notice of it ; and 
with that they shook hands, and swore to one an- 
other that they would be revenged of the Spaniards. 
As soon as they had made this bloody bargain, they 
fell to work with the poor men's habitation. They 
did not set fire indeed to anything, but they pulled 
down both their little houses, and pulled them so 
limb from limb, that they left not the least stick 
standing, or scarce any sign on the ground where they 
stood ; they tore all their little collected household 
stuff in pieces, and threw everything about in such 
a manner, that the poor men afterwards found some 
of their things a mile off of their habitation. 

When they had done this, they pulled up all the 
young trees the poor men had planted ; pulled up an 
enclosure they had made to secure their cattle and 
their corn ; and in a word, sacked and plundered 
everything as completely as a horde of Tartars would 
have done. 

The two men were at this juncture gone to find 
them out, and had resolved to fight them wherever 
they had been, though they were but two to three ; 
so that, had they met, there certainly would have 
been bloodshed among them ; for they were all very 
stout, resolute fellows, to give them their due. 

But Providence took more care to keep them 

[48] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



asunder than they themselves could do to meet ; for 
as if they had dogged one another, when the three 
were gone thither, the two were here ; and afterwards, 
when the two went back to find them, the three were 
come to the old habitation again ; we shall see their 
differing conduct presently. When the three came 
back, like furious creatures, flushed with the rage 
which the work they had been about had put them 
into, they came up to the Spaniards, and told them 
what they had done, by way of scoff and bravado ; 
and one of them stepping up to one of the Spaniards, 
as if they had been a couple of boys at play, takes 
hold of his hat, as it was upon his head, and giving 
it a twirl about, sneering in his face, says he to him, 
" And you, Seignior Jack Spaniard, shall have the 
same sauce if you do not mend your manners.'' 1 The 
Spaniard, who though a quiet, civil man, was as 
brave as a man could be desired to be, and withal a 
strong, well-made man, looked steadily at him for 
a good while, and then, having no weapon in his 
hand, stepped gravely up to him, and w T ith one blow 
of his fist knocked him down, as an ox is felled with 
a pole-axe ; at which one of the rogues, insolent as 
the first, fired his pistol at the Spaniard immediately. 
He missed his body indeed, for the bullets went 
through his hair, but one of them touched the tip 
of his ear, and he bled pretty much. The blood 
made the Spaniard believe he was more hurt than 
he really was, and that put him into some heat, for 
before he acted all in a perfect calm ; but now re- 
solving to go through with his work, he stooped to 
take the fellow's musket whom he had knocked down, 
and was just going to shoot the man who had fired 
at him, when the rest of the Spaniards, being in the 
cave, came out, and calling to him not to shoot, they 
stepped in, secured the other two, and took their 
arms from them. 

vol. n. — 4 [ 49 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



When they were thus disarmed, and found they 
had made all the Spaniards their enemies, as well 
as their own countrymen, they began to cool ; and 
giving the Spaniards better words, would have had 
their arms again. But the Spaniards, considering 
the feud that was between them and the other two 
Englishmen, and that it would be the best method 
they could take to keep them from killing one 
another, told them they would do them no harm ; 
and if they would live peaceably, they would be very 
willing to assist and associate with them, as they 
did before ; but that they could not think of giving 
them their arms again while they appeared so re- 
solved to do mischief with them to their own 
countrymen, and had even threatened them all to 
make them their servants. 

The rogues were now no more capable to hear 
reason than to act reason ; and being refused their 
arms, they went raving away, and raging like mad- 
men, threatening what they would do, though they 
had no firearms. But the Spaniards, despising their 
threatening, told them they should take care how 
they offered any injury to their plantation or cattle ; 
for if they did, they would shoot them as they would 
do ravenous beasts, wherever they found them ; and 
if they fell into their hands alive, they should cer- 
tainly be hanged. However, this was far from cool- 
ing them ; but away they went, raging and swearing 
like furies of hell. As soon as they were gone, came 
back the two men in passion and rage enough also, 
though of another kind ; for having been at their 
plantation, and finding it all demolished and de- 
stroyed, as above, it will easily be supposed they had 
provocation enough. They could scarce have room to 
tell their tale, the Spaniards were so eager to tell them 
theirs; and it was strange enough to find three men 
thus bully nineteen, and receive no punishment at all. 

[50 J 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



The Spaniards indeed despised them, and espe- 
cially having thus disarmed them made light of all 
their threatenings ; but the two Englishmen resolved 
to have their remedy against them, what pain soever 
it cost to find them out. 

But the Spaniards interposed here too, and told 
them that as they had disarmed them, they could 
not consent that they (the two) should pursue them 
with firearms, and perhaps kill them. " But,'" said 
the grave Spaniard, who was their governor, " we 
will endeavour to make them do you justice, if you 
will leave it to us ; for as there is no doubt but 
they will come to us again when their passion is 
over, being not able to subsist without our assist- 
ance, we promise you to make no peace with them 
without having a full satisfaction for you ; upon this 
condition we hope you will promise to use no vio- 
lence with them, other than in your own defence." 

The two Englishmen yielded to this very awkwardly, 
and with great reluctance ; but the Spanish protested 
they did it only to keep them from bloodshed, and 
to make all easy at last. " For,' 11 said they, " we are 
not so many of us ; here is room enough for us all, 
and it is great pity we should not be all good friends." 
At length they did consent, and waited for the issue 
of the thing, living for some days with the Spaniards, 
for their own habitation was destroyed. 

In about five days'* time the three vagrants, tired 
with wandering, and almost starved with hunger, 
having chiefly lived on turtles' eggs all that while, 
came back to the grove, and finding my Spaniard, 
who, as I have said, was the governor, and two 
more with him, walking by the side of the creek, 
they came up in a very submissive, humble manner, 
and begged to be received again into the family. 
The Spaniards used them civilly, but told them they 
had acted so unnaturally by their countrymen, and 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



so very grossly by them (the Spaniards), that they 
could not come to any conclusion without consulting 
the two Englishmen and the rest ; but, however, they 
would go to them, and discourse about it, and they 
should know in half-an-hour. It may be guessed 
that they were very hard put to it, for it seems, as 
they were to wait this half-hour for an answer, they 
begged he would send them out some bread in the 
meantime ; which he did, and sent them at the same 
time a large piece of goafs flesh and a broiled parrot, 
which they eat very heartily, for they were hungry 
enough. 

After half-an-hour\s consultation they were called 
in, and a long debate had among them, their two 
countrymen charging them with the ruin of all their 
labour, and a design to murder them ; all which they 
owned before, and therefore could not deny now. 
Upon the whole, the Spaniard acted the moderator 
between them ; and as they had obliged the two 
Englishmen not to hurt the three while they were 
naked and unarmed, so they now obliged the three 
to go and build their fellows 1 two huts, one of the 
same, and the other of larger dimensions than they 
were before ; to fence their ground again, where they 
had pulled up the fences, plant trees in the room of 
those pulled up, dig up the land again for planting 
corn, where they had spoiled it ; and, in a word, to 
restore everything in the same state they found it, 
as near as they could ; for entirely it could not be, 
the season for the corn, and the growth of the trees 
and hedges, not being possible to be recovered. 

Well, they submitted to all this, and as they had 
plenty of provisions given them all the while, they 
grew very orderly, and the whole society began to 
live pleasantly and agreeably together ; only that 
these three fellows could never be persuaded to work, 
I mean for themselves, except now and then a little, 

[52] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



just as they pleased. However, the Spaniards told 
them plainly that if they would but live sociably and 
friendly together, and study in the whole the good 
of the plantation, they would be content to work for 
them, and let them walk about and be as idle as they 
pleased ; and thus having lived pretty well together 
for a month or two, the Spaniards gave them arms 
again, and gave them liberty to go abroad with them 
as before. 

It was not above a week after they had these arms, 
and went abroad, but the ungrateful creatures began 
to be insolent and troublesome as before ; but, how- 
ever, an accident happening presently upon this, 
which endangered the safety of them all, they were 
obliged to lay by all private resentments, and look 
to the preservation of their lives. 

It happened one night that the Spaniard govern- 
or, as I call him, that is to say, the Spaniard whose 
life I had saved, who was now the captain, or leader, 
or governor of the rest, found himself very uneasy in 
the night, and could by no means get any sleep. 
He was perfectly well in body, as he told me the 
story, only found his thoughts tumultuous ; his 
mind ran upon men fighting, and killing of one 
another, but was broad awake, and could not by any 
means get any sleep. In short, he lay a great 
while ; but growing more and more uneasy, he re- 
solved to rise. As they lay, being so many of them, 
upon goafs-skins, laid thick upon such couches and 
pads as they made for themselves, not in ham- 
mocks and ship-beds, as I did, who was but one ; so 
they had little to do, when they were willing to rise, 
but to get up upon their feet, and perhaps put on a 
coat, such as it was, and their pumps, and they were 
ready for going any way that their thoughts guided 
them. 

Being thus gotten up, he looked out ; but being 

[53] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 

dark, he could see little or nothing ; and besides, the 
trees which I had planted, as in my former account 
is described, and which were now grown tall, inter- 
cepted his sight, so that he could only look up, and 
see that it was a clear starlight night ; and hearing 
no noise, he returned and laid him down again ; but 
it was all one, he could not sleep, nor could he com- 
pose himself to anything like rest, but his thoughts 
were to the last degree uneasy, and yet he knew not 
for what. 

Having made some noise with rising and walking 
about, going out and coming in, another of them 
waked, and calling, asked who it was that was up. 
The governor told him how it had been with him. 
" Say you so ? " says the other Spaniard ; " such 
things are not to be slighted, I assure you ; there is 
certainly some mischief working," says he, "near 
us ; " and presently he asked him, " Where are the 
Englishmen ? " " They are all in their huts,"' 1 says he, 
M safe enough."" It seems the Spaniards had kept 
possession of the main apartment, and had made a 
place where the three Englishmen, since their last 
mutiny, always quartered by themselves, and could 
not come at the rest. " Well," says the Spaniard, 
" there is something in it, I am persuaded from my 
own experience. I am satisfied our spirits embodied 
have a converse with, and receive intelligence from, 
the spirits unembodied, and inhabiting the invisible 
world ; and this friendly notice is given for our ad- 
vantage, if we know how to make use of it. Come, 1 ' 
says he, " let us go out and look abroad ; and if we 
find nothing at all in it to justify the trouble, I will 
tell you a story to the purpose, that shall convince 
you of the justice of my proposing it. ,, 

In a word, they went out to go up to the top of 
the hill, where I used to go ; but they, being strong, 
and in good company, not alone, as I was, used none 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



of my cautions to go up by the ladder, and then 
pulling it up after them to go up a second stage to 
the top, but were going round through the grove, 
unconcerned and unwary, when they were surprised 
with seeing a light, as of fire, a very little way off 
from them, and hearing the voices of men, not of one 
or two, but of a great number. 

In all the discoveries I had made of the savages 
landing on the island, it was my constant care to 
prevent them making the least discovery of there 
being any inhabitant upon the place ; and when by 
any occasion they came to know it, they felt it so 
effectually, that they that got away were scarce able 
to give any account of it, for we disappeared as soon 
as possible, nor did ever any that had seen me escape 
to tell any one else, except it were the three savages 
in our last encounter, who jumped into the boat, of 
whom I mentioned that I was afraid they should go 
home and bring more help. 

Whether it was the consequence of the escape of 
those men that so great a number came now together, 
or whether they came ignorantly, and by accident, 
on their usual bloody errand, they could not, it 
seems, understand ; but whatever it was, it had been 
their business, either to have concealed themselves, 
as not to have seen them at all, much less to have 
let the savages have seen that there were any inhab- 
itants in the place ; or to have fallen upon them so 
effectually, as that not a man of them should have 
escaped, which could only have been by getting in 
between them and their boats. But this presence of 
mind was wanting to them, which was the ruin of 
their tranquillity for a great while. 

We need not doubt but that the governor and the 
man with him, surprised with this sight, ran back 
immediately, and raised their fellows, giving them an 
account of the imminent danger they were all in, and 

[55 J 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



they again as readily took the alarm ; but it was im- 
possible to persuade them to stay close within where 
they were, but that they must run all out to see how 
things stood. 

While it was dark, indeed, they were well enough, 
and they had opportunity enough, for some hours, to 
view them by the light of three fires they had made 
at a distance from one another. What they were 
doing they knew not, and what to do themselves they 
knew not ; for, first, the enemy were too many ; 
and, secondly, they did not keep together, but were 
divided into several parties, and were on shore in 
several places. 

The Spaniards were in no small consternation at 
this sight ; and as they found that the fellows ran 
straggling all over the shore, they made no doubt 
but, first or last, some of them would chop in upon 
their habitation, or upon some other place, where 
they would see the token of inhabitants ; and they 
were in great perplexity also for fear of their flock of 
goats, which would have been little less than starving 
them if they should have been destroyed ; so the first 
thing they resolved upon, was to despatch three nun 
away before it was light, viz., two Spaniards and one 
Englishman, to drive all the goats away to the great 
valley where the cave was, and if need were to drive 
them into the very cave itself. 

Could they have seen the savages all together in 
one body, and at any distance from their canoes, they 
resolved, if they had been an hundred of them, to 
have attacked them ; but that could not be obtained, 
for they were some of them two miles off from the 
other, and, as it appeared afterwards, were of two 
different nations. 

After having mused a great while on the course 
they should take, and beaten their brains in con- 
sidering their present circumstances, they resolved at 

[56] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



last, while it was dark, to send the old savage, Friday's 
father, out as a spy, to learn if possible something 
concerning them, what they came for, and what they 
intended to do. The old man readily undertook it, 
and stripping himself quite naked, as most of the 
savages were, away he went. After he had been gone 
an hour or two, he brings word that he had been 
among them undiscovered, that he found they were 
two parties, and of two several nations, who had war 
with one another, and had had a great battle in their 
own country, and that both sides having had several 
prisoners taken in the fight, they were by mere chance 
landed all in the same island for the devouring their 
prisoners, and making merry, but their coming so by 
chance to the same place had spoiled all their 
mirth ; that they were in a great rage at one another, 
and that they were so near, that he believed they 
would fight again as soon as daylight began to 
appear ; but he did not perceive that they had any 
notion of anybody's being on the island but them- 
selves. He had hardly made an end of telling his 
story, when they could perceive, by the unusual 
noise they made, that the two little armies were 
engaged in a bloody fight. 

Friday's father used all the arguments he could to 
persuade our people to lie close, and not be seen. He 
told them their safety consisted in it, and that they 
had nothing to do but lie still, and the savages 
would kill one another to their hands, and then the 
rest would go away ; and it was so to a tittle. But 
it was impossible to prevail, especially upon the 
Englishmen, their curiosity was so importunate upon 
their prudentials, that they must run out and see 
the battle. However, they used some caution too, 
viz., they did not go openly just by their own dwell- 
ing, but went farther into the woods, and placed 
themselves to advantage, where they might securely 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 

see them manage the fight, and, as they thought, 
not to be seen by them ; but it seems the savages 
did see them, as we shall find hereafter. 

The battle was very fierce, and if I might believe 
the Englishmen, one of them said he could perceive 
that some of them were men of great bravery, of 
invincible spirit, and of great policy in guiding the 
fight. The battle, they said, held two hours before 
they could guess which party would be beaten ; but 
then that party which was nearest our peopled 
habitation began to appear weakest, and after some 
time more, some of them began to fly ; and this put 
our men again into a great consternation, lest any 
of those that fled should run into the grove before 
their dwelling for shelter, and thereby involuntarily 
discover the place, and that by consequence the 
pursuers should do the like in search for them. 
Upon this they resolved that they would stand 
armed within the wall, and whoever came into the 
grove they should sally out over the wall and kill 
them, so that if possible not one should return to 
give an account of it. They ordered, also, that it 
should be done with their swords, or by knocking 
them down with the stock of the musket, but not 
by shooting them, for fear of the noise. 

As they expected, it fell out. Three of the routed 
army fled for life, and crossing the creek ran directly 
into the place, not in the least knowing whither 
they went, but running as into a thick wood for 
shelter. The scout they kept to look abroad gave 
notice of this within, with this addition, to our 
men's great satisfaction, viz., that the conquerors 
had not pursued them, or seen which way they were 
gone. Upon this the Spaniard governor, a man of 
humanity, would not suffer them to kill the three 
fugitives ; but sending three men out by the top 
of the hill, ordered them to go round and come in 

[58] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



behind them, surprise, and take them prisoners, 
which was done. The residue of the conquered people 
fled to their canoes, and got off to sea ; the victors 
retired, and made no pursuit, or very little, but draw- 
ing themselves into a body together gave two great 
screaming shouts, which they supposed was by way 
of triumph, and so the fight ended ; and the same 
day, about three o'clock in the afternoon, they also 
marched to their canoes. And thus the Spaniards 
had their island again free to themselves, their 
fright was over, and they saw no savages in several 
years after. 

After they were all gone, the Spaniards came out 
of their den, and viewing the field of battle, they 
found about two and thirty dead men upon the spot. 
Some were killed with great long arrows, some of 
which were found sticking in their bodies ; but most 
of them were killed with their great wooden swords, 
sixteen or seventeen of which they found in the 
field of battle, and as many bows, with a great 
many arrows. These swords were strange great un- 
wieldy things, and they must be very strong men 
that used them. Most of those men that were 
killed with them had their heads mashed to pieces, 
as we may say, or, as we call it in English, their 
brains knocked out, and several their arms and legs 
broken ; so that 't is evident they fight with inex- 
pressible rage and fury. We found not one wounded 
man that was not stone dead ; for either they stay 
by their enemy till they have quite killed him, or 
they carry all the wounded men, that are not quite 
dead, away with them. 

This deliverance tamed our Englishmen for a 
great while. The sight had filled them with horror, 
and the consequences appeared terrible to the last 
degree, even to them, if ever they should fall into 
the hands of those creatures, who would not onlv 

[59] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



kill them as enemies, but kill them for food, as we 
kill our cattle. And they professed to me that the 
thoughts of being eaten up like beef or mutton, 
though it was supposed it was not to be till they 
were dead, had something in it so horrible, that it 
nauseated their very stomachs, made them sick when 
they thought of it, and filled their minds with such 
unusual terror, that they were not themselves for 
some weeks after. 

This, as I said, tamed even the three English 
brutes I have been speaking of, and for a great while 
after they were very tractable, and went about the 
common business of their whole society well enough ; 
planted, sowed, reaped, and began to be all naturalised 
to the country. But some time after this they fell 
all into such measures as brought them into a great 
deal of trouble. 

They had taken three prisoners, as I had observed ; 
and these three being lusty stout young fellows, 
they made them servants, and taught them to work 
for them, and as slaves they did well enough ; but 
they did not take their measures with them as I did 
by my man Friday, viz., to begin with them upon 
the principle of having saved their lives, and then 
instruct them in the rational principles of life, much 
less of religion, civilising and reducing them by kind 
usage and affectionate arguings ; but as they gave 
them their food every day, so they gave them their 
work too, and kept them fully employed in drudgery 
enough ; but they failed in this by it, that they 
never had them to assist them and fight for them as 
I had my man Friday, who was as true to me as the 
very flesh upon my bones. 

But to come to the family part. Being all now 
good friends — for common danger, as I said above, 
had effectually reconciled them — they began to 
consider their general circumstances ; and the first 

[60] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



thing that came under their consideration was, 
whether, seeing the savages particularly haunted 
that side of the island, and that there were more re- 
mote and retired parts of it equally adapted to their 
way of living, and manifestly to their advantage, 
they should not rather remove their habitation, and 
plant in some more proper place for their safety, 
and especially for the security of their cattle and 
corn. 

Upon this, after long debate, it was concluded 
that they would not remove their habitation, be- 
cause that, some time or other, they thought they 
might hear from their governor again, meaning me ; 
and if I should send any one to seek them, I should 
be sure to direct them to that side, where, if they 
should find the place demolished, they would con- 
clude the savages had killed us all, and we were 
gone, and so our supply would go too. 

But as to their corn and cattle, they agreed to 
remove them into the valley where my cave was, 
where the land was as proper for both, and where 
indeed there was land enough. However, upon 
second thoughts they altered one part of that reso- 
lution too, and resolved only to remove part of their 
cattle thither, and plant part of their corn there ; 
and so, if one part was destroyed, the other might 
be saved. And one part of prudence they used, 
which it was very well they did, viz., that they never 
trusted those three savages, which they had prison- 
ers, with knowing anything of the plantation they 
had made in that valley, or of any cattle they had 
there ; much less of the cave there, which they kept 
in case of necessity as a safe retreat, and whither 
they carried also the two barrels of powder which I 
had sent them at my coming away. 

But, however, they resolved not to change their 
habitation ; yet they agreed that as I had carefully 

[61] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



covered it first with a wall, or fortification, and then 
with a grove of trees, so seeing their safety consisted 
entirely in their being concealed, of which they were 
now fully convinced, they set to work to cover and 
conceal the place yet more effectually than before. 
To this purpose, as I had planted trees (or rather 
thrust in stakes which in time all grew up to be 
tries) for some good distance before the entrance 
into my apartment, they went on in the same manner, 
and filled up the rest of that whole space of ground, 
from the trees I had set quite down to the side of 
the creek, where, as I said, I landed my floats, and 
even in the very ooze where the tide flowed, not so 
much as leaving any place to land, or any sign that 
there had been any landing thereabout. These 
stakes also being of a wood very forward to grow, as 
I have noted formerly, they took care to have gener- 
ally very much larger and taller than those which 
I liad planted ; and as they grew apace, so they 
planted them so very thick and close together, that 
when they had been three or four years grown, there 
was no piercing with the eye any considerable way 
into the plantation. And as for that part which I 
had planted, the trees were grown as thick as a man's 
thigh ; and among them they placed so many other 
short ones, and so thick, that, in a word, it stood 
like a palisado a quarter of a mile thick, and it was 
next to impossible to penetrate it but with a little 
army to cut it all down ; for a little dog could hardly 
get between the trees, they stood so close. 

But this w as not all ; for they did the same by all 
the ground to the right hand, and to the left, and 
round even to the top of the hill, leaving no way, 
not so much as for themselves to come out but by the 
ladder placed up to the side of the hill, and then 
lifted up and placed again from the first stage up to 
the top ; which ladder, when it was taken down, 

[62] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



nothing but what had wings or witchcraft to assist 
it could come at them. 

This was excellently well contrived, nor was it less 
than what they afterwards found occasion for ; which 
served to convince me, that as human prudence has 
the authority of Providence to justify it, so it has, 
doubtless, the direction of Providence to set it to work; 
and would we listen carefully to the voice of it, I am 
fully persuaded we might prevent many of the dis- 
asters which our lives are now, by our own negli- 
gence, subjected to. But this by the way. 

I return to the story. They lived two years after 
this in perfect retirement, and had no more visits 
from the savages. They had indeed an alarm given 
them one morning, which put them into a great 
consternation ; for some of the Spaniards being out 
early one morning on the west side, or rather the 
end of the island, which, by the way, was that end 
where I never went, for fear of being discovered, 
they were surprised with seeing above twenty canoes 
of Indians just coming on shore. They made the 
best of their way home in hurry enough, and giving 
the alarm to their comrades, they kept close all that 
day and the next, going out only at night to make 
observation. But they had the good luck to be 
mistaken, for wherever the savages went, they did 
not land at that time in the island, but pursued 
some other design. 

And now they had another broil with the three 
Englishmen, one of which, a most turbulent fellow, 
being in a rage at one of the three slaves, which I 
had mentioned they had taken, because the fellow 
had not done something right which he bid him do, 
and seemed a little untractable in his showing him, 
drew a hatchet out of a frog-belt, in which he wore 
it by his side, and fell upon the poor savage, not to 
correct him, but to kill him. One of the Spaniards 

[63] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



who was by, seeing him give the fellow a barbarous 
cut with the hatchet, which he aimed at his head, 
but struck into his shoulder so that he thought he 
had cut the poor creature^ arm off, ran to him, and 
entreating him not to murder the poor man, clapped 
in between him and the savage to prevent the 
mischief. 

The fellow being enraged the more at this, struck 
at the Spaniard with his hatchet, and swore he 
would serve him as he intended to serve the savage ; 
which the Spaniard perceiving, avoided the blow, 
and with a shovel which he had in his hand (for 
they were all working in the field about their corn- 
land) knocked the brute down. Another of the 
Englishmen running at the same time to help his 
comrade, knocked the Spaniard down ; and then two 
Spaniards more came in to help their man, and a 
third Englishman fell in upon them. They had 
none of them any firearms, or any other weapon but 
hatchets and other tools, except this third English- 
man ; he had one of my old rusty cutlasses, with 
which he made at the two last Spaniards, and 
wounded them both. This fray set the whole family 
in an uproar, and more help coming in, they took 
the three Englishmen prisoners. The next question 
was, what should be done with them ? They had 
been so often mutinous, and were so furious, so des- 
perate, and so idle withal, that they knew not what 
course to take with them, for they were mischievous 
to the highest degree, and valued not what hurt they 
did to any man ; so that, in short, it was not safe to 
live with them. 

The Spaniard who was governor told them, in so 
many words, that if they had been of his own coun- 
try he would have hanged them ; for all laws and all 
governors were to preserve society, and those who 
were dangerous to the society ought to be expelled 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



out of it ; but as they were Englishmen, and that it 
was to the generous kindness of an Englishman that 
they all owed their preservation and deliverance, he 
would use them with all possible lenity, and would 
leave them to the judgment of the other two English- 
men, who were their countrymen. 

One of the two honest Englishmen stood up and 
said, they desired it might not be left to them, 
" For,"" says he, " I am sure we ought to sentence 
them to the gallows ; M and with that he gives an 
account how Will Atkins, one of the three, had pro- 
posed to have all the five Englishmen join together, 
and murder all the Spaniards when they were in 
their sleep. 

When the Spanish governor heard this he calls to 
William Atkins, " How, Seignior Atkins, 11 says he, 
" would you murder us all ? What have you to say 
to that ? " That hardened villain was so far from 
denying it, that he said it was true, and G — d d — m 
him if they would not do it still before they had 
done with them. " Well but, Seignior Atkins," says 
the Spaniard, " what have we done to you that you 
would kill us ? And what would you get by killing 
us ? And what must we do to prevent you killing us ? 
Must we kill you, or you will kill us ? Why will you 
put us to the necessity of this, Seignior Atkins ? " 
says the Spaniard very calmly, and smiling. 

Seignior Atkins was in such a rage at the Span- 
iard's making a jest of it that had he not been held 
by three men, and withal had no weapons with him, 
it was thought he would have attempted to have killed 
the Spaniard in the middle of all the company. 

This hair-brained carriage obliged them to con- 
sider seriously what was to be done. The two 
Englishmen and the Spaniard who saved the poor 
savage was of the opinion they should hang one of 
the three for an example to the rest ; and that, 
VOL. n. — 5 [ 65 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 

particularly, it should be he that had twice at- 
tempted to commit murder with his hatchet ; and 
indeed there was some reason to believe he had done 
it, for the poor savage was in such a miserable con- 
dition with the wound he had received, that it was 
thought he could not live. 

But the governor Spaniard still said, No ; it was 
an Englishman that had saved all their lives, and he 
would never consent to put an Englishman to death, 
though he had murdered half of them ; nay, he said, 
if he had been killed himself by an Englishman, and 
had time left to speak, it should be that they would 
pardon him. 

This was so positively insisted on by the governor 
Spaniard, that there was no gainsaying it ; and as 
merciful counsels are most apt to prevail where they 
are so earnestly pressed, so they all came into it ; 
but then it was to be considered what should be 
done to keep them from doing the mischief they 
designed ; for all agreed, governor and all, that 
means were to be used for preserving the society 
from danger. After a long debate it was agreed, 
first, that they should be disarmed, and not per- 
mitted to have either gun, or powder, or shot, or 
sword, or any weapon, and should be turned out of 
the society, and left to live where they would, and 
how they would, by themselves ; but that none of 
the rest, either Spaniards or English, should converse 
with them, speak with them, or have anything to 
do with them ; that they should be forbid to come 
within a certain distance of the place where the rest 
dwelt ; and that if they offered to commit any dis- 
order, so as to spoil, burn, kill, or destroy any of 
the corn, plantings, buildings, fences, or cattle be- 
longing to the society, they should die without 
mercy, and they would shoot them wherever they 
could find them. 

[66] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



The governor, a man of great humanity, musing 
upon the sentence, considered a little upon it, and 
turning to the two honest Englishmen said, " Hold, 
you must reflect that it will be long ere they can 
raise corn and cattle of their own, and they must 
not starve ; we must therefore allow them provi- 
sions.'' 1 So he caused to be added, that they should 
have a proportion of corn given to them to last them 
eight months, and for seed to sow, by which time 
they might be supposed to raise some of their own ; 
that they should have six milch-goats, four he-goats, 
and six kids given them, as well for present subsist- 
ence as for a store ; and that they should have 
tools given them for their work in the fields ; such 
as six hatchets, an axe, a saw, and the like ; but 
they should have none of these tools or provisions 
unless they would swear solemnly that they would 
not hurt or injure any of the Spaniards with them, 
or of their fellow Englishmen. 

Thus they dismissed them the society, and turned 
them out to shift for themselves. They went away 
sullen and refractory, as neither contented to go 
away or to stay ; but as there was no remedy they 
went, pretending to go and choose a place where 
they would settle themselves, to plant and live by 
themselves ; and some provisions were given them, 
but no weapons. 

About four or five days after they came again for 
some victuals, and gave the governor an account 
where they had pitched their tents, and marked 
themselves out an habitation and plantation ; and it 
was a very convenient place indeed, on the remotest 
part of the island, N.E., much about the place where 
I landed in my first voyage when I was driven out 
to sea, the Lord knows whither, in my attempt to 
surround the island. 

Here they built themselves two handsome huts, 

[67] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



and contrived them in a manner like my first habita- 
tion, being close under the side of a hill, having some 
trees growing already on three sides of it ; so that by 
planting others it would be very easily covered from 
the sight, unless narrowly searched for. They de- 
sired some dried goatVskins for beds and covering, 
which were given them ; and upon giving their words 
that they would not disturb the rest, or injure any 
of their plantations, they gave them hatchets and 
what other tools they could spare, some peas, barley, 
and rice for sowing, and in a word, anything they 
wanted but arms and ammunition. 

They lived in this separate condition about six 
months, and had gotten in their first harvest, though 
the quantity was but small, the parcel of land they 
had planted being but little ; for indeed having all 
their plantation to form, they had a great deal of 
work upon their hands ; and when they came to make 
boards, and pots, and such things, they were quite 
out of their element, and could make nothing of it ; 
and when the rainy season came on, for want of a 
cave in the earth they could not keep their grain dry, 
and it was in great danger of spoiling. And this 
humbled them much ; so they came and begged the 
Spaniards to help them, which they very readily did ; 
and in four days worked a great hole in the side of 
the hill for them, big enough to secure their corn 
and other things from the rain. But it was but a 
poor place at best compared to mine, and especially 
as mine was then ; for the Spaniards had greatly en- 
larged it, and made several new apartments in it. 

About three quarters of a year after this separation 
a new frolic took these rogues, which, together with 
the former villainy they had committed, brought 
mischief enough upon them, and had very near been 
the ruin of the whole colony. The three new asso- 
ciates began, it seems, to be weary of the laborious 

[68] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



life they led, and that without hope of bettering 
their circumstances ; and a whim took them that they 
would make a voyage to the continent from whence 
the savages came, and would try if they could not 
seize upon some prisoners among the natives there, 
and bring them home, so to make them do the labo- 
rious part of their work for them. 

The project was not so preposterous if they had 
gone no farther ; but they did nothing, and proposed 
nothing, but had either mischief in the design, or 
mischief in the event ; and if I may give my opinion, 
they seemed to be under a blast from Heaven ; for if 
we will not allow a visible curse to pursue visible 
crimes, how shall we reconcile the events of tilings 
with the Divine justice? It was certainly an appar- 
ent vengeance on their crime of mutiny and piracy 
that brought them to the state they were in ; and as 
they showed not the least remorse for the crime, but 
added new villainies to it, such as, particularly, the 
piece of monstrous cruelty of wounding a poor slave 
because he did not, or perhaps could not, understand 
to do what he was directed, and to wound him in 
such a manner as, no question, made him a cripple 
all his life, and in a place where no surgeon or medi- 
cine could be had for his cure ; and what was still 
worse, the murderous intent, or to do justice to the 
crime, the intentional murder, for such to be sure it 
was, as was afterwards the formed design they all laid 
to murder the Spaniards in cold blood, and in their 
sleep. 

But I leave observing, and return to the story. 
The three fellows came down to the Spaniards one 
morning, and in very humble terms desired to be 
admitted to speak with them. The Spaniards very 
readily heard what they had to say, which was this, 
that they were tired of living in the manner they 
did ; that they were not handy enough to make the 

[69] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



nec essaries they wanted ; and that, having no help, 
they found they should be starved ; but if the Span- 
iards would give them leave to take one of the ca- 
noes which they came over in, and give them arms 
and ammunition proportioned for their defence, they 
would go over to the main, and seek their fortune, 
and so deliver them from the trouble of supplying 
them with any other provisions. 

The Spaniards were glad enough to be rid of 
them ; but yet very honestly represented to them 
the certain destruction they were running into ; told 
them they had suffered such hardships upon that 
very spot, that they could, without any spirit of 
prophecy, tell them that they would be starved or 
be murdered, and bade them consider of it. 

The men replied audaciously, they should be 
starved if they stayed here, for they could not work, 
and would not work, and they could but be starved 
abroad ; and if they were murdered, there was an 
end of them, they had no wives or children to cry 
after them ; and, in short, insisted importunately 
upon their demand declaring that they would go 
whether they would give them any arms or no. 

The Spaniards told them with great kindness that 
if they were resolved to go, they should not go like 
naked men, and be in no condition to defend them- 
selves, and that though they could ill spare their 
firearms, having not enough for themselves, yet they 
would let them have two muskets, a pistol, and a 
cutlass, and each man a hatchet, which they thought 
was sufficient for them. 

In a word, they accepted the offer, and having 
baked them bread enough to serve them a month, 
and given them as much goafs flesh as they could 
eat while it was sweet, and a great basketful of dried 
grapes, a pot full of fresh water, and a young kid 
alive to kill, they boldly set out in a canoe for a 

[70] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



voyage over the sea, where it was at least forty miles 
broad. 

The boat was indeed a large one, and would have 
very well carried fifteen or twenty men, and there- 
fore was rather too big for them to manage ; but as 
they had a fair breeze and the flood tide with them, 
they did well enough. They had made a mast of a 
long pole, and a sail of four large goatVskins dried, 
which they had sewed or laced together ; and away 
they went merrily enough. The Spaniards called 
after them, Bon veyajo ; and no man ever thought 
of seeing them any more. 

The Spaniards would often say to one another, 
and to the two honest Englishmen who remained 
behind, how quietly and comfortably they lived now 
those three turbulent fellows were gone. As for 
their ever coming again, that was the remotest thing 
from their thoughts that could be imagined ; when, 
behold, after two and twenty days 1 absence, one of 
the Englishmen being abroad upon his planting 
work, sees three strange men coming towards him at 
a distance, with guns upon their shoulders. 

Away runs the Englishman as if he was bewitched, 
comes frighted and amazed to the governor Spaniard, 
and tells him they were all undone, for there were 
strangers landed upon the island, he could not tell 
who. The Spaniard, pausing a while, says he to 
him, u How do you mean, you cannot tell who ? 
They are the savages, to be sure."' 1 " No, no," says 
the Englishman, " they are men in clothes, with 
arms." " Nay, then," says the Spaniard, " why are 
you concerned ? If they are not savages, they must 
be friends ; for there is no Christian nation upon 
earth but will do us good rather than harm. ,, 

While they were debating thus, comes the three 
Englishmen, and standing without the wood, which 
was new planted, hallooed to them. They presently 

[71] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 

knew their voices, and so all the wonder of that kind 
ceased. But now the admiration was turned upon 
another question, viz., what could be the matter, 
and what made them come back again ? 

It was not long before they brought the men in ; 
and inquiring where they had been, and what they 
had been doing, they gave them a full account of 
their voyage in a few words, viz., that they reached 
the land in two days, or something less, but finding 
the people alarmed at their coming, and preparing 
with bows and arrows to fight them, they durst not 
go on shore, but sailed on to the northward six or 
seven hours, till they came to a great opening, by 
which they perceived that the land they saw from 
our island was not the main, but an island ; that 
entering that opening of the sea, they saw another 
island on the right hand north, and several more 
west ; and being resolved to land somewhere, they 
put over to one of the islands which lay west, and 
went boldly on shore ; that they found the people 
very courteous and friendly to them, and that they 
gave them several roots, and some dried fish, and 
appeared very sociable ; and the women, as well as 
the men, were very forward to supply them with 
anything they could get for them to eat, and brought 
it to them a great way upon their heads. 

They continued here four days, and inquired, as 
well as they could of them by signs, what nations 
were this way, and that way ; and were told of several 
fierce and terrible people, that lived almost every 
way ; who, as they made signs to them, used to eat 
men ; but as for themselves, they said that they 
never ate men or women, except only such as 
they took in the wars ; and then they owned that 
they made a great feast, and ate their prisoners. 

The Englishmen inquired when they had a feast 
of that kind, and they told him about two moons 

[72] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



ago, pointing to the moon, and then to two fingers ; 
and that their great king had two hundred prisoners 
now, which he had taken in his war, and they were 
feeding them to make them fat for the next feast. 
The Englishmen seemed mighty desirous to see those 
prisoners, but the other mistaking them, thought 
they were desirous to have some of them to carry 
away for their own eating. So they beckoned to 
them, pointing to the setting of the sun, and then 
to the rising ; which was to signify, that the next 
morning at sun-rising they would bring some for 
them ; and accordingly the next morning they 
brought down five women and eleven men, and 
gave them to the Englishmen to carry with them 
on their voyage, just as we would bring so many 
cows and oxen down to a seaport town to victual 
a ship. 

As brutish and barbarous as these fellows were at 
home, their stomachs turned at this sight, and they 
did not know what to do. To refuse the prisoners 
would have been the highest affront to the savage 
gentry that offered them ; and what to do with 
them they knew not. However, upon some debates, 
they resolved to accept of them ; and in return they 
gave the savages that brought them one of their 
hatchets, an old key, a knife, and six or seven of 
their bullets, which though they did not understand, 
they seemed extremely pleased with ; and then tying 
the poor creatures'* hands behind them, they (the 
people) dragged the poor prisoners into the boat 
for our men. 

The Englishmen were obliged to come away as 
soon as they had them, or else they that gave them 
this noble present would certainly have expected 
that they should have gone to work with them, have 
killed two or three of them the next morning, and 
perhaps have invited the donors to dinner. 

[73] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



But having taken their leave with all the respects 
and thanks that could well pass between people 
where, on either side, they understood not one word 
they could say, they put off with their boat, and 
came back towards the first island, where when they 
arrived they set eight of their prisoners at liberty, 
there being too many of them for their occasion. 

In their voyage they endeavoured to have some 
communication with their prisoners, but it was im- 
possible to make them understand anything ; noth- 
ing they could say to them, or give them, or do for 
them, but was looked upon as going about to mur- 
der them. They first of all unbound them, but the 
poor creatures screamed at that, especially the women, 
as if they had just felt the knife at their throats ; 
for they immediately concluded they were unbound 
on purpose to be killed. 

If they gave them anything to eat, it was the 
same thing ; then they concluded it was for fear 
they should sink in flesh, and so not be fat enough 
to kill ; if they looked at one of them more par- 
ticularly, the party presently concluded it was to 
see whether he or she was fattest and fittest to kill ; 
nay, after they had brought them quite over, and 
began to use them kindly, and treat them well, still 
they expected every day to make a dinner or supper 
for their new masters. 

When the three wanderers had given this unac- 
countable history or journal of their voyage, the 
Spaniard asked them where their new family was ? 
And being told that they had brought them on 
shore, and put them into one of their huts, and were 
come up to beg some victuals for them, they, the 
Spaniards and the other two Englishmen, that is to 
say, the whole colony, resolved to go all down to 
the place and see them, and did so, and Friday^ 
father with them. 

[74] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



W hen they came into the hut, there they sat all 
hound; for when they had brought them on shore 
they bound their hands, that they might not take 
the boat and make their escape. There, I say, they 
sat, all of them stark naked. First, there were three 
men, lusty, comely fellows, well shaped, straight and 
fair limbs, about thirty to thirty-five years of age, 
and five women, whereof two might be from thirty 
to forty, two more not above four or five and twenty, 
and the fifth, a tall, comely maiden, about sixteen 
or seventeen. The women were well favoured, agree- 
able persons, both in shape and features, only tawny ; 
and two of them, had they been perfect white, would 
have passed for very handsome women, even in Lon- 
don itself, having pleasant, agreeable countenances, 
and of a very modest behaviour, especially when 
they came afterwards to be clothed, and dressed, as 
they called it, though the dress was very indifferent, 
it must be confessed ; of which hereafter. 

The sight, you may be sure, was something un- 
couth to our Spaniards, who were, to give them a 
just character, men of the best behaviour, of the 
most calm, sedate tempers, and perfect good-humour 
that ever I met with ; and, in particular, of the most 
modesty, as will presently appear ; I say, the sight 
was very uncouth to see three naked men and five 
naked women, all together bound, and in the most 
miserable circumstances that human nature could be 
supposed to be, viz., to be expecting every moment 
to be dragged out and have their brains knocked 
out, and then to be eaten up like a calf that is 
killed for a dainty. 

The first thing they did was to cause the old 
Indian, Friday's father, to go in and see first if he 
knew any of them, and then if he understood any of 
their speech. As soon as the old man came in, he 
looked seriously at them, but knew none of them ; 

[75] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



neither could any of them understand a word he 
said, or a sign he could make, except one of the 
women. 

However, this was enough to answer the end, 
which was to satisfy them that the men into whose 
hands they were fallen were Christians ; that they 
abhorred eating of men or women, and that they 
might be sure they would not be killed. As soon as 
they were assured of this, they discovered such joy, 
and by such awkward and several ways as is hard to 
describe, for it seems they were of several nations. 

The woman who was their interpreter was bid in 
the next place to ask them if they were willing to be 
servants, and to work for the men who had brought 
them away to save their lives ? At which they all 
fell a-dancing ; and presently one fell to taking up 
this, and another that, or anything that lay next, to 
carry on their shoulders, to intimate that they were 
willing to work. 

The governor, who found that the having women 
among them would presently be attended with some 
inconvenience, and might occasion some strife, and 
perhaps blood, asked the three men what they in- 
tended to do with these women, and how they in- 
tended to use them, whether as servants or as 
women ? One of the Englishmen answered very 
boldly and readily, that they would use them as 
both. To which the governor said, " I am not 
going to restrain you from it ; you are your own 
masters as to that ; but this I think is but just, for 
avoiding disorders and quarrels amongst you, and I 
desire it of you for that reason only, viz., that you 
will all engage, that if any of you take any of these 
women as a woman, or wife, that he shall take but 
one ; and that having taken one, none else shall 
touch her ; for though we cannot marry any of you, 
yet 't is but reasonable that while you stay here, the 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



woman any of you takes should be maintained by 
the man that takes her, and should be his wife ; I 
mean," says he, " while he continues here ; and that 
none else shall have any thing to do with her." All 
this appeared so just, that every one agreed to it 
without any difficulty. 

Then the Englishmen asked the Spaniards if they 
designed to take any of them ? But every one of 
them answered " No." Some of them said they had 
wives in Spain, and the others did not like women 
that were not Christians, and all together declared 
that they would not touch one of them ; which was 
an instance of such virtue as I have not met with in 
all my travels. On the other hand, to be short, the 
five Englishmen took them every one a wife, that is 
to say, a temporary wife ; and so they set up a new 
form of living ; for the Spaniards and Friday's father 
lived in my old habitation, which they had enlarged 
exceedingly within. The three servants which were 
taken in the late battle of the savages, lived with 
them ; and these carried on the main part of the 
colony, supplying all the rest with food, and assist- 
ing them in anything as they could, or as they found 
necessity required. 

But the wonder of this story was, how five such 
refractory, ill-matched fellows should agree about 
these women, and that two of them should not pitch 
upon the same woman, especially seeing two or three 
of them were, without comparison, more agreeable 
than the other : but they took a good way enough 
to prevent quarrelling among themselves ; for they 
set the five women by themselves in one of their 
huts, and they went all into the other hut, and drew 
lots among them who should choose first. 

He that drew to choose first went away by him- 
self to the hut where the poor naked creatures were, 
and fetched out her he chose ; and it was worth ob- 

[77] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



serving, that he that chose first took her that was 
reckoned the homeliest and the oldest of the five, 
which made mirth enough among the rest ; and even 
the Spaniards laughed at it. But the fellow con- 
sidered better than any of them, that it was ap- 
plication and business that they were to expect 
assistance in as much as anything else ; and she 
proved the best wife of all the parcel. 

When the poor women saw themselves set in a 
row thus, and fetched out one by one, the terrors of 
their condition returned upon them again, and they 
firmly believed that they were now a-going to be 
devoured. Accordingly, when the English sailor 
came in and fetched out one of them, the rest set 
up a most lamentable cry, and hung about her, and 
took their leave of her with such agonies and such 
a flection as would have grieved the hardest heart in 
the world ; nor was it possible for the Englishmen 
to satisfy them that they were not to be immediately 
murdered, till they fetched the old man, Friday's 
father, who immediately let them know that the five 
men who had fetched them out one by one had 
chosen them for their wives. 

When they had done, and the fright the women 
were in was a little over, the men went to work, and 
the Spaniards came and helped them ; and in a few 
hours they had built them every one a new hut or 
tent for their lodging apart ; for those they had 
already Mere crowded with their tools, household 
stuff", and provision. The three wicked ones had 
pitched farthest off, and the two honest ones nearer, 
but both on the north shore of the island, so that 
they continued separate as before ; and thus my 
island was peopled in three places, and, as I might 
say, three towns were begun to be planted. 

And here 'tis very well worth observing, that as 
it often happens in the world (what the wise ends of 

[78] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



God's providence are in such a disposition of things 
I cannot say), the two honest fellows had the two 
worst wives ; and the three reprobates, that were 
scarce worth hanging, that were fit for nothing, and 
neither seemed born to do themselves good, or any 
one else, had three clever, diligent, careful, and in- 
genious wives; not that the two first were ill wives 
as to their temper or humour, for all the five were 
most willing, quiet, passive, and subjective creatures, 
rather like slaves than wives ; but my meaning is, 
they were not alike capable, ingenious, or indus- 
trious, or alike cleanly and neat. 

Another observation I must make, to the honour 
of a diligent application on one hand, and to the 
disgrace of a slothful, negligent, idle temper on the 
other, that when I came to the place and viewed 
the several improvements, plantings, and manage- 
ment of the several little colonies, the two men had 
so far outgone the three, that there was no com- 
parison. They had indeed both of them as much 
ground laid out for corn as they wanted ; and the 
reason was, because, according to my rule, Nature 
dictated that it was to no purpose to sow more corn 
than they wanted ; but the difference of the cultiva- 
tion, of the planting, of the fences, and indeed of 
everything else, was easy to be seen at first view. 

The two men had innumerable young trees planted 
about their huts, that when you came to the place 
nothing was to be seen but a wood ; and though 
they had twice had their plantations demolished, 
once by their own countrymen, and once by the 
enemy, as shall be shown in its place, yet they had 
restored all again, and everything was thriving and 
flourishing about them. They had grapes planted 
in order, and managed like a vineyard, though they 
had themselves never seen anything of that kind ; 
and by their good ordering their vines, their grapes 

[79] 

31-15 8 23 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



were as good again as any of the others. They had 
also found themselves out a retreat in the thickest 
part of the woods, where, though there was not a 
natural cave, as I had found, yet they made one 
with incessant labour of their hands, and where, 
when the mischief which followed happened, they 
secured their wives and children, so as they could 
never be found ; they having, by sticking innumer- 
able stakes and poles of the wood which, as I said, 
grew so easily, made the wood unpassable except in 
some places, where they climbed up to get over the 
outside part, and then went on by ways of their 
own leaving. 

As to the three reprobates, as I justly call them, 
though they were much civilised by their new settle- 
ment compared to what they were before, and were 
not so quarrelsome, having not the same oppor- 
tunity, yet one of the certain companions of a profli- 
gate mind never left them, and that was their 
idleness. It is true, they planted corn and made 
fences ; but Solomon's words were never better veri- 
fied than in them : M 1 went by the vineyard of the 
slothful, and it was all overgrown with thorns for 
when the Spaniards came to view their crop, they 
could not see it in some places for weeds ; the hedge 
had several gaps in it, where the wild goats had 
gotten in and eaten up the com ; perhaps here and 
there a dead bush was crammed in to stop them out 
for the present, but it was only shutting the stable 
door after the steed was stolen. Whereas, when 
they looked on the colony of the other two, there 
was the very face of industry and success upon all 
they did ; there was not a weed to be seen in all 
their corn, or a gap in any of their hedges ; and they, 
on the other hand, verified Solomon's words in 
another place : " That the diligent hand maketh 
rich;"' 1 for everything grew and thrived, and they 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



had plenty within and without ; they had more tame 
cattle than the other, more utensils and necessaries 
within doors, and yet more pleasure and diversion 
too. 

It is true, the wives of the three were very handy 
and cleanly within doors ; and having learned the 
English ways of dressing and cooking from one of 
the other Englishmen, who, as I said, was cook's 
mate on board the ship, they dressed their husbands 1 
victuals very nicely and well ; whereas the other 
could not be brought to understand it ; but then the 
husband, who, as I say, had been cook's mate, did it 
himself. But as for the husbands of the three wives, 
they loitered about, fetched turtles"' eggs, and caught 
fish and birds ; in a word, anything but labour, and 
they fared accordingly. The diligent lived well and 
comfortably, and the slothful lived hard and beg- 
garly ; and so I believe, generally speaking, it is all 
over the world. 

But now I come to a scene different from all that 
had happened before, either to them or to me ; and 
the original of the story was this. 

Early one morning there came on shore five or six 
canoes of Indians, or savages, call them which you 
please ; and there is no room to doubt that they 
came upon the old errand of feeding upon their 
slaves. But that part was now so familiar to the 
Spaniards, and to our men too, that they did not 
concern themselves about it, as I did ; but having 
been made sensible by their experience that their 
only business was to lie concealed, and that, if they 
were not seen by any of the savages, they would go 
off again quietly when their business was done, 
having as yet not the least notion of there being any 
inhabitants in the island ; I say, having been made 
sensible of this, they had nothing to do but to give 
notice to all the three plantations to keep within 
vol. n. — 6 [ 81 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



doors, and not show themselves, only placing a scout 
in a proper place to give notice when the boats went 
to sea again. 

This was, without doubt, very right ; but a dis- 
aster spoiled all these measures, and made it known 
among the savages that there were inhabitants there, 
which was, in the end, the desolation of almost the 
whole colony. After the canoes with the savages 
were gone off, the Spaniards peeped abroad again, 
and some of them had the curiosity to go to the 
place where they had been, to see what they had 
been doing. Here, to their great surprise, they 
found three savages left behind, and lying fast 
asleep upon the ground. It was supposed they had 
either been so gorged with their inhuman feast that, 
like beasts, they were asleep, and would not stir when 
the others went, or they were wandered into the 
woods, and did not come back in time to be taken in. 

The Spaniards were greatly surprised at this sight, 
and perfectly at a loss what to do. The Spaniard 
governor, as it happened, was with them, and his 
advice was asked ; but he professed he knew not 
what to do. As for slaves, they had enough already ; 
and as to killing them, they were none of them in- 
clined to that. The Spaniard governor told me 
they could not think of shedding innocent blood ; 
for as to them, the poor creatures had done them 
no wrong, invaded none of their property, and they 
thought they had no just quarrel against them to 
take away their lives. 

And here I must, in justice to these Spaniards, 
observe, that let the accounts of Spanish cruelty in 
Mexico and Peru be what they will, I never met 
with seventeen men, of any nation whatsoever, in any 
foreign country, who were so universally modest, 
temperate, virtuous, so very good-humoured, and so 
courteous as these Spaniards ; and as to cruelty, they 

[82] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



had nothing of it in their very nature ; no inhuman- 
ity, no barbarity, no outrageous passions, and yet 
all of them men of great courage and spirit. 

Their temper and calmness had appeared in their 
bearing the insufferable usage of the three English- 
men ; and their justice and humanity appeared now 
in the case of the savages, as above. After some 
consultation they resolved upon this, that they would 
lie still a while longer, till, if possible, these three 
men might be gone ; but then the governor Spaniard 
recollected that the three savages had no boat, and 
that if they were left to rove about the island, they 
would certainly discover that there were inhabitants 
in it, and so they should be undone that way. 

Upon this they went back again, and there lay 
the fellows fast asleep still ; so they resolved to 
waken them, and take them prisoners, and they did 
so. The poor fellows were strangely frighted when 
they were seized upon and bound, and afraid, like 
the women, that they should be murdered and 
eaten ; for it seems those people think all the world 
does as they do, eating men's flesh ; but they were 
soon made easy as to that, and away they carried 
them. 

It was very happy to them that they did not 
carry them home to their castle ; I mean, to my 
palace under the hill ; but they carried them first to 
the bower, where was the chief of their country 
work, such as the keeping the goats, the planting 
the corn, &c. ; and afterwards they carried them to 
the habitation of the two Englishmen. 

Here they were set to work, though it was not 
much they had for them to do ; and whether it 
was by negligence in guarding them, or that they 
thought the fellows could not mend themselves, I 
know not, but one of them ran away, and taking 
into the woods, they could never hear of him more. 

[83] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



They had good reason to believe he got home 
again soon after, in some other boats or canoes of 
savages, who came on shore three or four weeks 
afterwards, and who, carrying on their revels as 
usual, went off again in two days 1 time. This 
thought terrified them exceedingly ; for they con- 
cluded, and that not without good cause indeed, 
that if this fellow came safe home among his com- 
rades, he would certainly give them an account that 
there were people in the island, as also how few and 
weak they were ; for this savage, as I observed be- 
fore, had never been told, and it was very happy he 
had not, how many there were, or where they lived, 
nor had he ever seen or heard the fire of any of their 
guns, much less had they shown him any of their 
other retired places, such as the cave in the valley, 
or the new retreat which the two Englishmen had 
made, and the like. 

The first testimony they had that this fellow had 
given intelligence of them was, that about two 
months after this six canoes of savages, with about 
seven or eight or ten men in a canoe, came rowing 
along the north side of the island, where they never 
used to come before, and landed about an hour after 
sunrise at a convenient place, about a mile from the 
habitation of the two Englishmen, where this es- 
caped man had been kept. As the Spaniard gov- 
ernor said, had they been all there the damage would 
not have been so much, for not a man of them 
would have escaped ; but the case differed now very 
much, for two men to fifty was too much odds. 
The two men had the happiness to discover them 
about a league off, so that it was above an hour be- 
fore they landed, and as they landed a mile from 
their huts, it was some time before they could come 
at them. Now having great reason to believe that 
they were betrayed, the first thing they did was to 

[84] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



bind the two slaves which were left, and cause two 
of the three men whom they brought with the 
women, who, it seems, proved very faithful to them, 
to lead them with their two wives, and whatever 
they could carry away with them, to their retired 
place in the woods, which I have spoken of above, 
and there to bind the two fellows hand and foot till 
they heard further. 

In the next place, seeing the savages were all 
come on shore, and that they bent their course di- 
rectly that way, they opened the fences where their 
milch-goats were kept, and drove them all out, leav- 
ing their goats to straggle into the woods whither 
they pleased, that the savages might think they 
were all bred wild ; but the rogue who came with 
them was too cunning for that, and gave them an 
account of it all, for they went directly to the 
place. 

When the two poor frighted men had secured 
their wives and goods, they sent the other slave they 
had of the three who came with the women, and 
who was at their place by accident, away to the 
Spaniards with all speed, to give them the alarm, 
and desire speedy help ; and in the meantime they 
took their arms, and what ammunition they had, 
and retreated towards the place in the wood where 
their wives were sent, keeping at a distance, yet so 
that they might see, if possible, which way the sav- 
ages took. 

They had not gone far but that, from a rising 
ground, they could see the little army of their ene- 
mies come on directly to their habitation, and in a 
moment more could see all their huts and household 
stuff flaming up together, to their great grief and 
mortification ; for they had a very great loss, to 
them irretrievable, at least for some time. They 
kept their station for a while till they found the 

[85] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



savages, like wild beasts, spread themselves all over 
the place, rummaging every way, and every place 
they could think of, in search for prey, and in par- 
ticular for the people, of whom it now plainly ap- 
peared they had intelligence. 

The two Englishmen seeing this, thinking them- 
selves not secure where they stood, because as it was 
likely some of the wild people might come that way, 
so they might come too many together, thought 
it proper to make another retreat about half a 
mile farther, believing, as it afterwards happened, 
that the farther they strolled the fewer would be 
together. 

The next halt was at the entrance into a very 
thick grown part of the woods, and where an old 
trunk of a tree stood, which was hollow, and vastly 
large ; and in this tree they both took their stand- 
ing, resolving to see there what might offer. 

They had not stood there long, but two of the 
savages appeared running directly that way, as if 
they had already had notice where they stood, and 
were coming up to attack them ; and a little way 
farther they spied three more coming after them, 
and five more beyond them, all coming the same 
way, besides which they saw seven or eight more at 
a distance running another way ; for in a word, they 
ran every way, like sportsmen beating for their 
game. 

The poor men were now in great perplexity whether 
they should stand and keep their posture, or fly ; but 
after a very short debate with themselves, they con- 
sidered, that if the savages ranged the country thus 
before help came, they might, perhaps, find out their 
retreat in the woods, then all would be lost ; so they 
resolved to stand them there ; and if they were too 
many to deal with, then they would get up to the 
top of the tree, from whence they doubted not to 

[86] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



defend themselves, fire excepted, as long as their 
ammunition lasted, though all the savages that were 
landed, which was near fifty, were to attack them. 

Having resolved upon this, they next considered 
whether they should fire at the first two, or wait for 
the three, and so take the middle party, by which 
the two and the five that followed would be sepa- 
rated ; and they resolved to let the two first pass 
by, unless they should spy them in the tree, and 
come to attack them. The two first savages also 
confirmed them in this regulation, by turning a little 
from them towards another part of the wood ; but 
the three, and the five after them, came forwards 
directly to the tree, as if they had known the En- 
glishmen were there. 

Seeing them come so straight towards them, they 
resolved to take them in a line as they came ; and as 
they resolved to fire but one at a time, perhaps the 
first shot might hit them all three ; to which pur- 
pose the man who was to fire put three or four 
small bullets into his piece, and having a fair loop- 
hole, as it were, from a broken hole in the tree, he 
took a sure aim, without being seen, waiting till 
they were within about thirty yards of the tree, so 
that he could not miss. 

While they were thus waiting, and the savages 
came on, they plainly saw that one of the three was 
the runaway savage that had escaped from them, 
and they both knew him distinctly, and resolved 
that, if possible, he should not escape, though they 
should both fire ; so the other stood ready with his 
piece, that if he did not drop at the first shot, he 
should be sure to have a second. 

But the first was too good a marksman to miss his 
aim ; for as the savages kept near one another, a 
little behind in a line, in a word, he fired, and hit 
two of them directly. The foremost was killed out- 

[87] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



right, being shot in the head ; the second, which 
was the runaway Indian, was shot through the body, 
and fell, but was not quite dead ; and the third had 
a little scratch in the shoulder, perhaps by the same 
ball that went through the body of the second ; and 
being dreadfully frighted, though not much hurt, 
sat down upon the ground, screaming and yelling 
in a hideous manner. 

The five that were behind, more frighted with the 
noise than sensible of the danger, stood still at first ; 
for the woods made the sound a thousand times 
bigger than it really was, the echoes rattling from 
one side to another, and the fowls rising from all 
parts, screaming and making, every sort, a several 
kind of noise, according to their kind ; just as it 
was when I fired the first gun that, perhaps, was 
ever shot off in that place since it was an island. 

However, all being silent again, and they not 
knowing what the matter was, came on unconcerned, 
till they came to the place where their companions 
lay in a condition miserable enough ; and here the 
poor ignorant creatures, not sensible that they were 
within reach of the same mischief, stood all of a 
huddle over the wounded man, talking, and, as may 
be supposed, inquiring of him how he came to be 
hurt ; and who, 't is very rational to believe, told 
them that a flash of fire first, and immediately after 
that thunder from their gods, had killed two, and 
wounded him. This, I say, is rational ; for nothing 
is more certain than that, as they saw no man near 
them, so they had never heard a gun in all their 
lives, or so much as heard of a gun ; neither knew 
they anything of killing or wounding at a distance 
with fire and bullets. If they had, one might reason- 
ably believe they would not have stood so uncon- 
cerned in viewing the fate of their fellows without 
some apprehension of their own. 

[88] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



Our two men, though, as they confessed to me, it 
grieved them to be obliged to kill so many poor 
creatures, who at the same time had no notion of 
their danger ; yet having them all thus in their 
power, and the first having loaded his piece again, 
resolved to let fly both together among them, and 
singling out, by agreement, which to aim at, they 
shot together, and killed, or very much wounded, 
four of them ; the fifth, frighted even to death, 
though not hurt, fell with the rest ; so that our men, 
seeing them all fall together, thought they had 
killed them all. 

The belief that the savages were all killed made 
our two men come boldly out from the tree before 
they had charged their guns again, which was a 
wrong step, and they were under some surprise when 
they came to the place and found no less than four 
of the men alive, and of them two very little hurt, 
and one not at all. This obliged them to fall upon 
them with the stocks of their muskets ; and first they 
made sure of the runaway savage, that had been the 
cause of all the mischief, and of another that was 
hurt in his knee, and put them out of their pain. 
Then the man that was not hurt at all came and 
kneeled down to them with his two hands held up, 
and made piteous moans to them by gestures and 
signs for his life, but could not say one word to 
them that they could understand. 

However, they signed to him to sit down at the 
foot of a tree thereby ; and one of the Englishmen, 
with a piece of rope-twine which he had by great 
chance in his pocket, tied his two feet fast together, 
and his two hands behind him, and there they left him, 
and with what speed they could made after the other 
two which were gone before, fearing they, or any 
more of them, should find the way to their covered 
place in the woods, where their wives, and the few 

[89] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



goods they had left, lay. They came once in sight 
of the two men, but it was at a great distance. 
However, they had the satisfaction to see them cross 
over a valley towards the sea, the quite contrary way 
from that which led to their retreat, which they 
were afraid of ; and being satisfied with that, they 
went back to the tree where they left their prisoner, 
who, as they supposed, was delivered by his com- 
rades ; for he was gone, and the two pieces of rope- 
yarn with which they bound him lay just at the foot 
of the tree. 

They were now in as great concern as before, not 
knowing what course to take, or how near the enemy 
might be, or in what numbers ; so they resolved to 
go away to the place where their wives were, to see 
if all was well there, and to make them easy, who 
were in fright enough to be sure ; for though the 
savages were their own country-folk, yet they were 
most terribly afraid of them, and perhaps the more 
for the knowledge they had of them. 

When they came there, they found the savages 
had been in the wood, and very near that place, but 
had not found it ; for it was indeed inaccessible, by 
the trees standing so thick, as before, had not the 
persons seeking it been directed by those that knew 
it, which these did not. They found, therefore, 
everything very safe, only the women in a terrible 
fright. While they were here they had the comfort 
to have seven of the Spaniards come to their assist- 
ance ; the other ten, with their servants and old 
Friday, I mean Friday's father, were gone in a body 
to defend their bower, and the corn and cattle that 
was kept there, in case the savages should have 
roved over to that side of the country ; but they did 
not spread so far. With the seven Spaniards came 
one of the three savages, who, as I said, were their 
prisoners formerly, and with them also came the 

[90] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



savage whom the Englishmen had left bound hand 
and foot at the tree ; for it seems they came that 
way, saw the slaughter of the seven men, and un- 
bound the eighth, and brought him along with them, 
where, however, they were obliged to bind him again, 
as they had the two others, who were left when the 
third ran away. 

The prisoners began now to be a burden to them, 
and they were so afraid of their escaping, that they 
were once resolving to kill them all, believing they 
were under an absolute necessity to do so for their 
own preservation. However, the Spaniard governor 
would not consent to it, but ordered for the present 
that they should be sent out of the way to my old 
cave in the valley, and be kept there, with two 
Spaniards to guard them and give them food for 
their subsistence, which was done ; and they were 
bound there hand and foot for that night. 

When the Spaniards came, the two Englishmen 
were so encouraged, that they could not satisfy 
themselves to stay any longer there ; but taking five 
of the Spaniards, and themselves, with four muskets 
and a pistol among them, and two stout quarter- 
staves, away they went in quest of the savages. 
And first, they came to the tree where the men lay 
that had been killed ; but it was easy to see that 
some more of the savages had been there ; for they 
had attempted to carry their dead men away, and 
had dragged two of them a good way, but had given 
it over. From thence they advanced to the first 
rising ground, where they stood and saw their camp 
destroyed, and where they had the mortification still 
to see some of the smoke ; but neither could they 
here see any of the savages. They then resolved, 
though with all possible caution, to go forward 
towards their ruined plantation ; but a little before 
they came thither, coming in sight of the sea-shore, 

[91] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



they saw plainly the savages all embarking again in 
their canoes, in order to be gone. 

They seemed sorry at first, and there was no way to 
come at them to give them a parting blow ; but upon 
the whole were very well satisfied to be rid of them. 

The poor Englishmen being now twice ruined, 
and all their improvement destroyed, the rest all 
agreed to come and help them to rebuild, and to 
assist them with needful supplies. Their three 
countrymen, who were not yet noted for having the 
least inclination to any good, yet as soon as they 
heard of it (for they, living remote eastward, knew 
nothing of the matter till all was over), came and 
offered their help and assistance, and did very 
friendly work for several days to restore their habi- 
tation, and make necessaries for them ; and thus in 
a little time they were set upon their legs again. 

About two days after this they had the further 
satisfaction of seeing three of the savages' canoes 
come driving on shore, and at some distance from 
them, two drowned men ; by which they had reason 
to believe that they had met with a storm at sea, 
and had overset some of them, for it had blown 
very hard the very night after they went off. 

However, as some might miscarry, so on the other 
hand enough of them escaped to inform the rest, as 
well of what they had done, as of what had hap- 
pened to them, and to whet them on to another en- 
terprise of the same nature, which they, it seems, 
resolved to attempt, with sufficient force to carry all 
before them ; for except what the first man had told 
them of inhabitants, they could say little to it of 
their own knowledge, for they never saw one man ; 
and the fellow being killed that had affirmed it, 
they had no other witness to confirm it to them. 

It was five or six months after this before they 
heard any more of the savages, in which time our 

[92] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



men were in hopes they had either forgot their 
former bad luek, or given over the hopes of better, 
when on a sudden they were invaded with the most 
formidable fleet of no less than eight and twenty 
canoes, full of savages, armed with bows and arrows, 
great clubs, wooden swords, and such like engines of 
war ; and they brought such numbers with them, 
that, in short, it put all our people into the utmost 
consternation. 

As they came on shore in the evening, and at the 
easternmost side of the island, our men had that 
night to consult and consider what to do ; and in 
the first place, knowing that their being entirely 
concealed was their only safety before, and would 
much more be so now while the number of their ene- 
mies was so great, they therefore resolved, first of 
all, to take down the huts which were built for the 
two Englishmen, and drive away their goats to the 
old cave ; because they supposed the savages would 
go directly thither as soon as it was day to play the 
old game over again, though they did not now land 
within two leagues of it. 

In the next place, they drove away all the flock of 
goats they had at the old bower, as I called it, which 
belonged to the Spaniards, and, in short, left as 
little appearance of inhabitants anywhere as was 
possible ; and the next morning early they posted 
themselves with all their force at the plantation of 
the two men, waiting for their coming. As they 
guessed, so it happened. These new invaders, leav- 
ing their canoes at the east end of the island, came 
ranging along the shore, directly towards the place, 
to the number of 250, as near as our men could 
judge. Our army was but small indeed ; but that 
which was worse, they had not arms for all their 
number neither. The whole account, it seems, 
stood thus. First, as to the men : — 

[93] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



17 Spaniards. 
5 Englishmen. 

1 Old Friday, or Friday's father. 

3 The three slaves taken with the women, who 

proved very faithful. 
3 Other slaves who lived with the Spaniards. 

To arm these they had : — 

11 Muskets. 
5 Pistols. 
3 Fowling-pieces. 

5 Muskets, or fowling-pieces, which were taken by 
me from the mutinous seamen whom I reduced. 

2 Swords. 

3 Old halberds. 

To their slaves they did not give either musket or 
fusee, but they had every one a halberd, or a long 
staff, like a quarter-staff, with a great spike of iron 
fastened into each end of it, and by his side a 
hatchet ; also every one of our men had hatchets. 
Two of the women could not be prevailed upon but 
they would come into the fight, and they had bows 
and arrows, which the Spaniards had taken from the 
savages when the first action happened, which I 
have spoken of, where the Indians fought with one 
another ; and the women had hatchets too. 

The Spaniard governor, whom I have described so 
often, commanded the whole ; and William Atkins, 
who, though a dreadful fellow for wickedness, was 
a most daring, bold fellow, commanded under him. 
The savages came forward like lions, and our men, 
which was the worst of their fate, had no advantage 
in their situation ; only that Will Atkins, who now 
proved a most useful fellow, with six men, was 
planted just behind a small thicket of bushes, as an 
advanced guard, with orders to let the first of them 

[94] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



pass by, and then fire into the middle of them, and 
as soon as he had fired to make his retreat, as nimbly 
as he could, round a part of the wood, and so come 
in behind the Spaniards where they stood, having 
a thicket of trees also before them. 

When the savages came on, they ran straggling 
about every way in heaps, out of all manner of 
order, and William Atkins let about fifty of them 
pass by him ; then seeing the rest come in a very 
thick throng, he orders three of his men to fire, 
having loaded their muskets with six or seven bullets 
apiece, about as big as large pistol-bullets. How 
many they killed or wounded they knew not ; but 
the consternation and surprise was inexpressible 
among the savages. They were frighted to the last 
degree to hear such a dreadful noise, and see their 
men killed, and others hurt, but see nobody that 
did it. When in the middle of their fright William 
Atkins and his other three let fly again among the 
thickest of them, and in less than a minute the first 
three, being loaded again, gave them a third volley. 

Had William Atkins and his men retired immedi- 
ately as soon as they had fired, as they were ordered 
to do, or had the rest of the body been at hand to 
have poured in their shot continually, the savages 
had been effectually routed ; for the terror that was 
among them came principally from this, viz., that 
they were killed by the gods with thunder and 
lightning, and could see nobody that hurt them. 
But William Atkins, staying to load again, dis- 
covered the cheat. Some of the savages, who were 
at a distance, spying them, came upon them behind ; 
and though Atkins and his men fired at them also, 
two or three times, and killed above twenty, retir- 
ing as fast as they could, yet they wounded Atkins 
himself, and killed one of his fellow Englishmen 
with their arrows, as they did afterwards one Span- 

[95] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 

iard and one of the Indian slaves who came with 
the women. This slave was a most gallant fellow, 
and fought most desperately, killing five of them 
with his own hand, having no weapon but one of 
the armed staves and a hatchet. 

Our men being thus hard laid at, Atkins wounded 
and two other men killed, retreated to a rising ground 
in the wood ; and the Spaniards, after firing three 
volleys upon them, retreated also ; for their number 
was so great, and they were so desperate, that though 
above fifty of them were killed, and more than so 
many wounded, yet they came on in the teeth of our 
men, fearless of danger, and shot their arrows like a 
cloud ; and it was observed that their wounded men, 
who were not quite disabled, were made outrageous 
by their wounds, and fought like madmen. 

When our men retreated, they left the Spaniard 
and the Englishman that was killed behind them ; 
and the savages, when they came up to them, killed 
them over again in a wretched manner, breaking their 
arms, legs, and heads with their clubs and wooden 
swords, like true savages. But finding our men were 
gone, they did not seem to pursue them, but drew 
themselves up in a kind of a ring, which is, it seems, 
their custom, and shouted twice in token of their 
victory ; after which, they had the mortification to 
see several of their wounded men fall, dying with the 
mere loss of blood. 

The Spaniard governor having drawn his little 
body up together upon a rising ground, Atkins, 
though he was wounded, would have had him marched 
and charged them again altogether at once. But 
the Spaniard replied, " Seignior Atkins, you see how 
their wounded men fight ; let them alone till morn- 
ing ; all these wounded men will be stiff and sore 
with their wounds, and faint with the loss of blood, 
and so we shall have the fewer to engage." 

[96] 



ROBIxNSON CRUSOE 



The advice was good ; but Will Atkins replied 
merrily, " That 'a true, Seignior, and so shall I too ; 
and that's the reason I would go on while I am 
warm." " Well, Seignior Atkins," says the Spaniard, 
" you have behaved gallantly, and done your part ; 
we will fight for you if you cannot come on, but I 
think it best to stay till morning." So they waited. 

But as it was a clear moonlight night, and they 
found the savages in great disorder about their dead 
and wounded men, and a great hurry and noise 
among them where they lay, they afterwards resolved 
to fall upon them in the night, especially if they 
could come to give them but one volley before they 
were discovered, which they had a fair opportunity 
to do ; for one of the two Englishmen, in whose 
quarter it was where the fight began, led them round 
between the woods and seaside westward, and then 
turning short south they came so near where the 
thickest of them lay, that before they were seen or 
heard eight of them fired in among them, and did 
dreadful execution upon them. In half a minute 
more eight others fired after them, pouring in their 
small shot in such a quantity, that abundance were 
killed and wounded ; and all this while they were not 
able to see who hurt them, or which way to fly. 

The Spaniards charged again with the utmost 
expedition, and then divided themselves into three 
bodies, and resolved to fall in among them altogether. 
They had in each body eight persons ; that is to say, 
twenty-four, whereof were twenty-two men and the 
two women, who, by the way, fought desperately. 

They divided the firearms equally in each party, 
and so of the halberds and staves. They would have 
had the women keep back, but they said they were 
resolved to die with their husbands. Having thus 
formed their little army, they marched out from 
among the trees, and came up to the teeth of the 
VOL. ii. —7 [ 97 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



enemy, shouting and hallooing as loud as they could. 
The savages stood all together, but were in the 
utmost confusion, hearing the noise of our men shout- 
ing from three quarters together ; they would have 
fought if they had seen us ; and as soon as we came near 
enough to be seen, some arrows were shot, and poor 
old Friday was wounded, though not dangerously. 
But our men gave them no time, but running up to 
them fired among them three ways, and then fell in 
with the butt ends of their muskets, their swords, 
armed staves, and hatchets ; and laid about them so 
well, that, in a word, they set up a dismal screaming 
and howling, flying to save their lives which way so- 
ever they could. 

Our men were tired with the execution ; and 
killed, or mortally wounded, in the two fights, about 
one hundred and eighty of them. The rest, being 
frighted out of their wits, scoured through the woods 
and over the hills, with all the speed and fear that 
nimble feet could help them to do; and as we did 
not trouble ourselves much to pursue them, they got 
all together to the seaside, where they landed, and 
where their canoes lay. But their disaster was not 
at an end yet, for it blew a terrible storm of wind 
that evening from the seaward, so that it was im- 
possible for them to go off ; nay, the storm con- 
tinuing all night, when the tide came up their canoes 
were most of them driven by the surge of the sea so 
high upon the shore, that it required infinite toil to 
get them off ; and some of them were even dashed 
to pieces against the beach, or against one another. 

Our men, though glad of their victory, yet got 
little rest that night ; but having refreshed, them- 
selves as well as they could, they resolved to march 
to that part of the island where the savages were 
fled, and see what posture they were in. This 
necessarily led them over the place where the fight 

[98] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



had been, and where they found several of the poor 
creatures not quite dead, and yet past recovering 
life ; a sight disagreeable enough to generous minds ; 
for a truly great man, though obliged by the law of 
battle to destroy his enemy, takes no delight in his 
misery. However, there was no need to give any 
orders in this case ; for their own savages, who were 
their servants, despatched those poor creatures with 
their hatchets. 

At length they came in view of the place where 
the more miserable remains of the savages 1 army lay, 
where there appeared about a hundred still; there 
posture was generally sitting upon the ground, with 
their knees up towards their mouth, and the head 
put between the two hands, leaning down upon the 
knees. 

When our men came within two musket-shot of 
them, the Spaniard governor ordered two muskets to 
be fired without ball, to alarm them ; this he did, 
that by their countenance he might know what to 
expect, viz., whether they were still in heart to fight, 
or were so heartily beaten, as to be dispirited and 
discouraged, and so he might manage accordingly. 

This stratagem took ; for as soon as the savages 
heard the first gun, and saw the flash of the second, 
they started up from their feet in the greatest con- 
sternation imaginable; and as our men advanced 
swiftly towards them, they all ran screaming and 
yawling away, with a kind of a howling noise, which 
our men did not understand, and had never heard 
before; and thus they ran up the hills into the 
country. 

At first, our men had much rather the weather had 
been calm, and they had all gone away to sea ; but 
they did not then consider that this might probably 
have been the occasion of their coming again in such 
multitudes as not to be resisted ; or, at least, to come 

[99] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



so many, and so often, as would quite desolate the 
island and starve them. Will Atkins, therefore, who, 
notwithstanding his wound, kept always with them, 
proved the best counsellor in this case. His advice 
was, to take the advantage that offered, and clap in 
between them and their boats, and so deprive them 
of the capacity of ever returning any more to plague 
the island. 

They consulted long about this, and some were 
against it, for fear of making the wretches fly to the 
woods, and live there desperate ; and so they should 
have them to hunt like wild beasts, be afraid to stir 
out about their business, and have their plantations 
continually rifled, all their tame goats destroyed, and, 
in short, be reduc ed to a life of continual distress. 

Will Atkins told them they had better have to do 
with a hundred men, than with a hundred nations ; 
that as they must destroy their boats, so they must 
destroy the men, or be all of them destroyed them- 
selves. In a word, he showed them the necessity of 
it so plainly, that they all came into it ; so they 
went to work immediately with the boats, and get- 
ting some dry wood together from a dead tree, they 
tried to set some of them on fire ; but they were so 
wet that they would not burn. However, the fire 
so burned the upper part, that it soon made them 
unfit for swimming in the sea as boats. When the 
Indians saw what they were about, some of them 
came running ou t of the woods, and coming as near 
as they could to our men, kneeled down and cried, 
Oa, Oa, Waramoka, and some other words of their 
language, which none of the others understood any- 
thing of ; but as they made pitiful gestures and 
strange noises, it was easy to understand they 
begged to have their boats spared, and that they 
would be gone, and never come there again. 

But our men were now satisfied that they had no 

[100] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



way to preserve themselves or to save their colony, 
but effectually to prevent any of these people from 
ever going home again ; depending upon this, that 
if ever so much as one of them got back into their 
country to tell the story, the colony was undone. 
So that letting them know that they should not 
have any mercy, they fell to work with their canoes, 
and destroyed them, every one that the storm had 
not destroyed before ; at the sight of which the 
savages raised a hideous cry in the woods, which our 
people heard plain enough ; after which they ran 
about the island like distracted men ; so that, in a 
word, our men did not really know at first what to 
do with them. 

Nor did the Spaniards, with all their prudence, 
consider that while they made those people thus 
desperate, they ought to have kept good guard at 
the same time upon their plantations ; for though 
it is true they had driven away their cattle, and the 
Indians did not find out their main retreat, I mean 
my old castle at the hill, nor the cave in the valley, 
yet they found out my plantation at the bower, and 
pulled it all to pieces, and all the fences and plant- 
ing about it ; trod all the corn under foot ; tore up 
the vines and grapes, being just then almost ripe, 
and did to our men an inestimable damage, though 
to themselves not one farthing worth of service. 

Though our men were able to fight them upon 
all occasions, yet they were in no condition to pursue 
them, or hunt them up or down ; for as they were 
too nimble of foot for our men when they found them 
single, so our men durst not go about single for fear 
of being surrounded with their numbers. The best 
was, they had no weapons ; for though they had bows, 
they haa no arrows left, nor any materials to make any, 
nor had they any edged tool or weapon among them. 

The extremity and distress they were reduced to 
[101 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 

w as great, and indeed deplorable, but at the same 
time our men were also brought to very bad circum- 
stances by them ; for though their retreats were pre- 
served, yet their provision was destroyed, and their 
harvest spoiled ; and what to do, or which way to 
turn themselves, they knew not. The only refuge 
they had now was the stock of cattle they had in 
the valley by the cave, and some little corn which 
grew there ; and the plantation of the three English- 
men, William Atkins and his comrades, who were 
now reduced to two, one of them being killed by an 
arrow, which struck him on the side of his head, 
just under the temple, so that he never spoke more ; 
and it was very remarkable, that this was the same 
barbarous fellow who cut the poor savage slave with 
his hatchet, and who afterwards intended to have 
murdered all the Spaniards. 

I looked upon this case to have been worse at this 
time than mine was at any time after I first dis- 
covered the grains of barley and rice, and got into 
the manner of planting and raising my corn, and my 
tame cattle ; for now they had, as I may say, a hun- 
dred wolves upon the island, which would devour 
everything they could come at, yet could very hardly 
be come at themselves. 

The first thing they concluded when they saw 
what their circumstances were, was that they would, 
if possible, drive them up to the farther part of the 
island, south-west, that if any more savages came on 
shore, they might not find one another ; then that 
they would daily hunt and harass them, and kill as 
many of them as they could come at, till they had 
reduced their number ; and if they could at last tame 
them, and bring them to anything, they would give 
them corn, and teach them how to plant, and live 
upon their daily labour. 

In order to this they so followed them, and so 

[102 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



terrified them with their guns, that in a few days, 
if any of them fired a gun at an Indian, if he did not 
hit him, yet he would fall down for fear ; and so 
dreadfully frighted they were, that they kept out of 
sight farther and farther, till at last our men follow- 
ing them, and every day almost killing and wound- 
ing some of them, they kept up in the woods and 
hollow places so much, that it reduced them to the 
utmost misery for want of food ; and many were 
afterwards found dead in the woods, without any 
hurt, but merely starved to death. 

When our men found this, it made their hearts re- 
lent, and pity moved them ; especially the Spaniard 
governor, who was the most gentlemanly, generous- 
minded man that ever I met with in my life ; and he 
proposed, if possible, to take one of them alive, and 
bring him to understand what they meant, so far as 
to be able to act as interpreter, and to go among 
them, and see if they might be brought to some con- 
ditions that might be depended upon, to save their 
lives, and to do us no spoil. 

It was some while before any of them could be 
taken ; but being weak and half-starved, one of them 
was at last surprised, and made a prisoner. He was 
sullen at first, and would neither eat or drink ; but 
finding himself kindly used, and victuals given him, 
and no violence offered him, he at last grew tractable, 
and came to himself. 

They brought old Friday to him, who talked often 
with him, and told him how kind the others would 
be to them all ; that they would not only save their 
lives, but would give them a part of the island to 
live in, provided they would give satisfaction that 
they would keep in their own bounds, and not come 
beyond it, to injure or prejudice others ; and that 
they should have corn given them to plant and make 
it grow for their bread, and some bread given them 

[103] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



for their present subsistence ; and old Friday bade 
the fellow go and talk with the rest of his country- 
men, and see what they said to it, assuring them that 
if they did not agree immediately they should be all 

destroyed. 

The poor wretches, thoroughly humbled, and re- 
duced in number to about thirty-seven, closed with 
the proposal at the first offer, and begged to have 
some food given them ; upon which twelve Spaniards 
and two Englishmen, well armed, with three Indian 
slaves, and old Friday, marched to the place where 
they were. The three Indian slaves carried them a 
large quantity of bread, some rice boiled up to cakes, 
and dried in the sun, and three live goats ; and they 
were ordered to go to the side of a hill, where they 
sat down, ate the provisions very thankfully, and 
were the most faithful fellows to their words that 
could be thought of ; for except when they came 
to beg victuals and directions, they never came out 
of their bounds ; and there they lived when I came 
to the island, and I went to see them. 

They had taught them both to plant corn, make 
bread, breed tame goats, and milk them ; they 
wanted nothing but wives, and they soon would have 
been a nation. They were confined to a neck of 
land surrounded with high rocks behind them, and 
lying plain towards the sea before them, on the 
south-east corner of the island. They had land 
enough, and it was very good and fruitful ; they 
had a piece of land about a mile and half broad, 
and three or four miles in length. 

Our men taught them to make wooden spades, 
such as I made for myself ; and gave them among 
them twelve hatchets, and three or four knives ; 
and there they lived, the most subjected innocent 
creatures that ever were heard of. 

After this the colony enjoyed a perfect tranquillity 

[ 104 ] 



ROBIxNSON CRUSOE 



with respect to the savages till I came to revisit 
them, which was above two years ; not but that now 
and then some canoes of savages came on shore for 
their triumphal unnatural feasts ; but as they were 
of several nations, and, perhaps, had never heard of 
those that came before, or the reason of it, they did 
not make any search or inquiry after their country- 
men ; and if they had, it would have been very hard 
to have found them out. 

Thus, I think, I have given a full account of all 
that happened to them to my return, at least that 
was worth notice. The Indians, or savages, were 
wonderfully civilised by them, and they frequently 
went among them ; but forbid, on pain of death, 
any of the Indians coming to them, because they 
would not have their settlement betrayed again. 

One thing was very remarkable, viz., that they 
taught the savages to make wicker-work, or baskets, 
but they soon outdid their masters ; for they made 
abundance of most ingenious things in wicker-work ; 
particularly all sorts of baskets, sieves, bird-cages, 
cupboards, &c, as also chairs to sit on, stools, beds, 
couches, and abundance of other things, being very 
ingenious at such work when they were once put in 
the way of it. 

My coming was a particular relief to these people, 
because we furnished them with knives, scissors, 
spades, shovels, pickaxes, and all things of that kind 
which they could want. 

With the help of these tools they were so very 
handy, that they came at last to build up their huts, 
or houses, very handsomely ; raddling, or working it 
up like basket-work all the way round, which was a 
very extraordinary piece of ingenuity, and looked 
very odd ; but was an exceeding good fence, as well 
against heat as against all sorts of vermin ; and our 
men were so taken with it, that they got the wild 

[105] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 

savages to come and do the like for them ; so that 
when I came to see the two Englishmen's colonies, 
they looked, at a distance, as if they lived all like 
bees in a hive. And as for Will Atkins, who was 
now become a very industrious, necessary, and sober 
fellow, he had made himself such a tent of basket- 
work as I believe was never seen. It was one hun- 
dred and twenty paces round in the outside, as I 
measured by my steps ; the walls were as close 
worked as a basket, in panels or squares of thirty- 
two in number, and very strong, standing about 
seven feet high. In the middle was another, not 
above twenty-two paces round, but built stronger, 
being eight-square in its form, and in the eight 
corners stood eight very strong posts, round the top 
of which he laid strong pieces, pinned together with 
wooden pins, from which he raised a pyramid for the 
roof of eight rafters, very handsome I assure you, 
and joined together very well, though he had no 
nails, and only a few iron spikes, which he made 
himself too out of the old iron that I had left there ; 
and indeed this fellow showed abundance of inge- 
nuity in several things which he had no knowledge 
of. He made him a forge, with a pair of wooden 
bellows to blow the fire ; he made himself charcoal 
for his work, and he formed out of one of the iron 
crows a middling good anvil to hammer upon ; in 
this manner he made many things, but especially 
hooks, staples, and spikes, bolts and hinges. But 
to return to the house ; after he had pitched the 
roof of his innermost tent, he worked it up between 
the rafters with basket-work, so firm, and thatched 
that over again so ingeniously with rice-straw, and 
over that a large leaf of a tree, which covered the 
top, that his house was as dry as if it had been tiled 
or slated. Indeed, he owned that the savages made 
the basket-work for him. 

[106] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



The outer circuit was covered, as a lean-to, all 
round this inner apartment, and long rafters lay from 
the two and thirty angles to the top of the posts of 
the inner house, being about twenty feet distance ; so 
that there was a space like a walk within the outer 
wicker wall, and without the inner, near twenty feet 
wide. 

The inner place he partitioned off with the same 
wicker-work, but much fairer, and divided it into 
six apartments, so that he had six rooms on a floor, 
and out of every one of these there was a door : first, 
into the entry, or coming into the main tent ; and 
another door into the space or walk that was round 
it ; so that walk was also divided into six equal parts, 
which served not only for retreat, but to store up 
any necessaries which the family had occasion for. 
These six spaces not taking up the whole circum- 
ference, what other apartments the outer circle had, 
were thus ordered : as soon as you were in at the 
door of the outer circle, you had a short passage 
straight before you to the door of the inner house ; 
but on either side was a wicker partition, and a door 
in it, by which you went first into a large room or 
store-house, twenty feet wide, and about thirty feet 
long, and through that into another not quite so 
long ; so that in the outer circle was ten handsome 
rooms, six of which were only to be come at through 
the apartments of the inner tent, and served as closets 
or retiring rooms to the respective chambers of the 
inner circle ; and four large warehouses or barns, 
or what you please to call them, which went in 
through one another, two on either hand of the 
passage, that led through the outer door to the 
inner tent. 

Such a piece of basket-work, I believe, was never 
seen in the world ; nor a house or tent so neatly con- 
trived, much less so built. In this great beehive 

[107] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



lived the three families ; that is to say, Will Atkins 
and his companion ; the third was killed, but his 
wife remained with three children ; for she was, it 
seems, big with child when he died, and the other 
two were not at all backward to give the widow her 
full share of everything, I mean as to their corn, 
milk, grapes, &c., and when they killed a kid, or 
found a turtle on the shore ; so that they all lived 
well enough, though it was true they were not so 
industrious as the other two, as has been observed 
already. 

One thing, however, cannot be omitted, viz., that 
is for religion, I don't know that there was anything 
of that kind among them. They pretty often indeed 
put one another in mind that there was a God by 
the very common method of seamen, viz., swearing 
by His name ; nor were their poor, ignorant, savage 
wives much the better for having been married to 
Christians, as we must call them ; for as they knew 
very little of God themselves, so they were utterly 
incapable of entering into any discourse with their 
wives about a God, or to talk anything to them con- 
cerning religion. 

The utmost of all the improvement which I can 
say the wives had made from them was, that they 
had taught them to speak English pretty well ; and 
all the children they had, which were near twenty in 
all, were taught to speak English too, from their 
first learning to speak, though they at first spoke it 
in a very broken manner, like their mothers. There 
were none of these children above six years old when 
I came thither ; for it was not much above seven 
years that they had fetched these five savage ladies 
over, but they had all been pretty fruitful, for they 
had all children, more or less. I think the cook's 
mate's wife was big of her sixth child ; and the 
mothers were all a good sort of well-governed, quiet, 

[108] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



laborious women, modest and decent, helpful to 
one another, mighty observant and subject to their 
masters, I cannot call them husbands ; and wanted 
nothing but to be well instructed in the Christian 
religion, and to be legally married ; both which were 
happily brought about afterwards by my means, 
or at least in consequence of my coming among 
them. 

Having thus given an account of the colony in 
general, and pretty much of my five runagate English- 
men, I must say something of the Spaniards, who 
were the main body of the family, and in whose story 
there are some incidents also remarkable enough. 

I had a great many discourses with them about 
their circumstances when they were among the 
savages. They told me readily, that they had no 
instances to give of their application or ingenuity in 
that country ; that they were a poor, miserable, de- 
jected handful of people ; that if means had been 
put into their hands, they had yet so abandoned 
themselves to despair, and so sunk under the weight 
of their misfortunes, that they thought of nothing 
but starving. One of them, a grave and very sen- 
sible man, told me he was convinced they were in 
the wrong ; that it was not the part of wise men to 
give up themselves to their misery, but always to 
take hold of the helps which reason offered, as well 
for present support, as for future deliverance. He 
told me that grief was the most senseless insignificant 
passion in the world ; for that it regarded only things 
past, which was generally impossible to be recalled 
or to be remedied, but had no views to things to 
come, and had no share in anything that looked like 
deliverance, but rather added to the affliction than 
proposed a remedy ; and upon this he repeated a 
Spanish proverb, which though I cannot repeat in 
just the same words that he spoke in, yet I remember 

[109] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



I made it into an English proverb of my own, 
thus : 

In trouble to be troubled, 

Is to have your trouble doubled. 

He ran on then in remarks upon all the little im- 
provements I had made in my solitude ; my unwearied 
application, as he called it, and how I had made a 
condition, which in its circumstances was at first 
much worse than theirs, a thousand times more 
happy than theirs was even now, when they were 
all together. He told me it was remarkable that 
Englishmen had a greater presence of mind in their 
distress than any people that ever he met with ; 
that their unhappy nation, and the Portuguese, were 
the worst men in the world to struggle with mis- 
fortunes ; for their first step in dangers, after the 
common efforts are over, was always to despair, lie 
down under it and die, without rousing their thoughts 
up to proper remedies for escape. 

I told him their case and mine differed exceed- 
ingly ; that they were cast upon the shore without 
necessaries, without supply of food, or of present 
sustenance, till they could provide ; that it is true I 
had this disadvantage and discomfort, that I was 
alone ; but then the supplies I had providentially 
thrown into my hands by the unexpected driving of 
the ship on shore, was such a help, as would have 
encouraged any creature in the world to have ap- 
plied himself as I had done. " Seignior," says the 
Spaniard, " had we poor Spaniards been in your 
case, we should never have gotten half those things 
out of the ship as you did ; nay," says he, " we 
should never have found means to have gotten a 
raft to carry them, or to have gotten the raft on 
shore without boat or sail ; and how much less 
should we have done," said he, " if any of us had 

[110] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



been alone ? " Well, I desired him to abate his 
compliment, and go on with the history of their 
coming on shore, where they landed. He told me 
they unhappily landed at a place where there were 
people without provisions ; whereas, had they had the 
common sense to have put off to sea again, and 
gone to another island a little farther, they had 
found provisions, though without people ; there be- 
ing an island that way, as they had been told, where 
there was provisions, though no people ; that is to 
say, that the Spaniards of Trinidad had frequently 
been there, and had filled the island with goats and 
hogs at several times, where they had bred in such 
multitudes, and where turtle and sea-fowls were in 
such plenty, that they could have been in no want 
of flesh though they had found no bread ; whereas 
here they were only sustained with a few roots and 
herbs which they understood not, and which had no 
substance in them, and which the inhabitants gave 
them sparingly enough, and who could treat them no 
better unless they would turn cannibals, and eat men's 
flesh, which was the great dainty of their country. 

They gave me an account how many ways they 
strove to civilise the savages they were with, and to 
teach them rational customs in the ordinary way of 
living, but in vain ; and how they retorted it upon 
them as unjust, that they, who came there for assist- 
ance and support, should attempt to set up for in- 
structors of those that gave them bread ; intimating, 
it seems, that none should set up for the instructors 
of others but those who could live without them. 

They gave me dismal accounts of the extremities 
they were driven to ; how sometimes they were 
many ways without any food at all, the island they 
were upon being inhabited by a sort of savages that 
lived more indolent, and for that reason were less 
supplied with the necessaries of life than they had 

[in] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



reason to believe others were in the same part of 
the world ; and yet they found that these savages 
were less ravenous and voracious than those who had 
better supplies of food. 

Also they added, that they could not but see with 
what demonstrations of wisdom and goodness the 
governing providence of God directs the events of 
things in the world, which they said appeared in their 
circumstances ; for if, pressed by the hardships they 
were under, and the barrenness of the country where 
they were, they had searched after a better place to 
live in, they had then been out of the way of the 
relief that happened to them by my means. 

Then they gave me an account how the savages 
whom they lived among expected them to go out 
with them into their wars ; and it was true, that as 
they had firearms with them, had they not had the 
disaster to lose their ammunition, they should not 
have been serviceable only to their friends, but have 
made themselves terrible both to friends and enemies ; 
but being without powder and shot, and yet in a condi- 
tion that they could not in reason deny to go out with 
their landlords to their wars, when they came into 
the field of battle they were in a worse condition 
than the savages themselves, for they neither had 
bows or arrows, nor could they use those the savages 
gave them, so that they could do nothing but stand 
still and be wounded with arrows, till they came up 
to the teeth of their enemy ; and then indeed the 
three halberds they had were of use to them, and 
they would often drive a whole little army before 
them with those halberds and sharpened sticks put 
into the muzzles of their muskets ; but that for all 
this, they were sometimes surrounded with multi- 
tudes, and in great danger from their arrows ; till at 
last they found the way to make themselves large 
targets of wood, which they covered with skins of 

[112] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



wild beasts, whose names they knew not, and these 
covered them from the arrows of the savages ; that 
notwithstanding these, they were sometimes in great 
danger, and were once five of them knocked down 
together with the clubs of the savages, which was 
the time when one of them was taken prisoner, that 
is to say, the Spaniard whom I had relieved, that at 
first they thought had been killed ; but when after- 
wards they heard he was taken prisoner, they were 
under the greatest grief imaginable, and would will- 
ingly have ventured their lives to have rescued him. 

They told me, that when they were so knocked 
down, the rest of their company rescued them, and 
stood over them, fighting till they were come to 
themselves, all but him who they thought had been 
dead ; and then they made their way with their 
halberds and pieces, standing close together in a line, 
through a body of above a thousand savages, beat- 
ing down all that came in their way, got the victory 
over their enemies, but to their great sorrow, because 
it was with the loss of their friend ; whom the other 
party, finding him alive, carried off with some others, 
as I gave an account in my former. 

They described, most affectionately, how they were 
surprised with joy at the return of their friend and 
companion in misery, who they thought had been 
devoured by wild beasts of the worst kind, viz., by 
wild men ; and yet how more and more they were 
surprised with the account he gave them of his 
errand, and that there was a Christian in any place 
near, much more one that was able, and had human- 
ity enough, to contribute to their deliverance. 

They described how they were astonished at the 
sight of the relief I sent them, and at the appearance 
of loaves of bread, things they had not seen since 
their coming to that miserable place ; how often they 
crossed it, and blessed it, as bread sent from heaven ,• 
vol. ii. —8 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



and what a reviving cordial it was to their spirits to 
taste it, as also of the other things I had sent for their 
supply. And after all, they would have told me 
something of the joy they were in at the sight of a 
boat and pilots to carry them away to the person 
and place from whence all these new comforts came ; 
but they told me it was impossible to express it by 
words, for their excessive joy naturally driving them 
to unbecoming extravagances, they had no way to 
describe them but by telling me that they bordered 
upon lunacy, having no way to give vent to their 
passion suitable to the sense that was upon them ; 
that in some it worked one way, and in some 
another ; and that some of them, through a surprise 
of joy, would burst out into tears ; others be stark 
mad, and others immediately faint. This discourse 
extremely affected me, and called to my mind 
Friday's ecstacy when he met his father, and the 
poor people's ecstacy when I took them up at sea, 
after their ship was on fire ; the mate of the ship's 
joy, when he found himself delivered in the place 
where he expected to perish ; and my own joy, when 
after twenty-eight years' captivity I found a good 
ship ready to carry me to my own country. All 
these things made me more sensible of the relation 
of those poor men, and more affected with it. 

Having thus given a view of the state of things 
as I found them, I must relate the heads of what 
I did for these people, and the condition in which 
I left them. It was their opinion, and mine too, 
that they would be troubled no more with the 
savages ; or that, if they were, they would be able 
to cut them off, if they were twice as many as be- 
fore ; so they had no concern about that. Then I 
entered into a serious discourse with the Spaniard, 
whom I called governor, about their stay in the 
island ; for as I was not come to carry any of them 

[114] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



off, so it would not be just to carry off some and 
leave others, who perhaps would be unwilling to 
stay if their strength was diminished. 

On the other hand, I told them I came to establish 
them there, not to remove them ; and then I let 
them know that I had brought with me relief of 
sundry kinds for them ; that I had been at a great 
charge to supply them with all things necessary, as 
well for their convenience as their defence ; and that 
I had such and such particular persons with me, as 
well to increase and recruit their number, as by the 
particular necessary employments which they were 
bred to, being artificers, to assist them in those 
things in which at present they were to seek. 

They were all together when I talked thus to 
them ; and before I delivered to them the stores I 
had brought, I asked them, one by one, if they had 
entirely forgot and buried the first animosities that 
had been among them, and would shake hands with 
one another, and engage in a strict friendship and 
union of interest, that so there might be no more 
misunderstandings or jealousies. 

Will Atkins, with abundance of frankness and 
good-humour, said they had met with afflictions 
enough to make them all sober, and enemies enough 
to make them all friends ; that for his part, he would 
live and die with them ; and was so far from design- 
ing anything against the Spaniards, that he owned 
they had done nothing to him but what his own 
mad humours made necessary, and what he would 
have done, and perhaps much worse, in their case ; 
and that he would ask them pardon, if I desired it, 
for the foolish and brutish things he had done to 
them ; and was very willing and desirous of living 
in terms of entire friendship and union with them, 
and would do anything that lay in his power to 
convince them of it ; and as for going to England, 

[115] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



he cared not if he did not go thither these twenty 

years. 

The Spaniards said they had indeed at first dis- 
armed and excluded Will Atkins and his two coun- 
trymen, for their ill conduct, as they had let me 
know ; and they appealed to me for the necessity 
they were under to do so ; but that Will Atkins 
had behaved himself so bravely in the great fight 
they had with the savages, and on several occasions 
since, and had shown himself so faithful to, and 
concerned for, the general interest of them all, that 
they had forgotten all that was past, and thought he 
merited as much to be trusted with arms, and to be 
supplied witli necessaries, as any of them ; and that 
they had testified their satisfaction in him by com- 
mitting the command to him, next to the governor 
himself; and as they had an entire confidence in him 
and all his countrymen, so they acknowledged they 
had merited that confidence by all the methods that 
honest men could merit to be valued and trusted ; 
and they most heartily embraced the occasion of 
giving me this assurance, that they would never have 
any interest separate from one another. 

Upon these frank and open declarations of friend- 
ship, we appointed the next day to dine all together, 
and indeed we made a splendid feast. I caused the 
ship's cook and his mate to come on shore and dress 
our dinner, and the old cook's mate we had on shore 
assisted. We brought on shore six pieces of good 
beef, and four pieces of pork, out of the ship's pro- 
vision, with our punch-bowl, and materials to fill it ; 
and in particular, gave them ten bottles of French 
claret, and ten bottles of English beer, things that 
neither the Spaniards or the Englishmen had tasted 
for many years, and which it may be supposed they 
were exceeding glad of. 

The Spaniards added to our feast five whole kids, 

[116] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



which the cooks roasted ; and three of them were 
sent, covered up close, on board the ship to the 
seamen, that they might feast on fresh meat from 
on shore, as we did with their salt meat from on 
board. 

After this feast, at which we were very innocently 
merry, I brought out my cargo of goods, wherein, 
that there might be no dispute about dividing, I 
showed them that there was sufficient for them all ; 
and desired that they might all take an equal 
quantity of the goods that were for wearing ; that 
is to say, equal when made up. At first, I dis- 
tributed linen sufficient to make every one of them 
four shirts ; and, at the Spaniards' request, afterwards 
made them up six ; these were exceeding comfortable 
to them, having been what, as I may say, they had 
long since forgot the use of, or what it was to wear 
them. 

I allotted the thin English stuffs, which I men- 
tioned before, to make every one a light coat like 
a frock, which I judged fittest for the heat of the 
season, cool and loose ; and ordered that whenever 
they decayed they should make more, as they thought 
fit. The like for pumps, shoes, stockings, and 
hats, &c. 

I cannot express what pleasure, what satisfaction, 
sat upon the countenances of all these poor men 
when they saw the care I had taken of them, and 
how well I had furnished them. They told me I 
was a father to them ; and that having such a cor- 
respondent as I was in so remote a part of the 
world, it would make them forget that they were 
left in a desolate place ; and they all voluntarily 
engaged to me not to leave the place without my 
consent. 

Then I presented to them the people I had 
brought with me, particularly the tailor, the smith, 

[117] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



and the two carpenters, all of them most necessary 
people ; but above all my general artificer, than 
whom they could not name anything that was more 
useful to them ; and the tailor, to show his concern 
for them, went to work immediately, and, with my 
leave, made them every one a shirt the first thing 
he did ; and which was still more, he taught the 
women not only how to sew and stitch, and use the 
needle, but made them assist to make the shirts for 
their husbands and for all the rest. 

As to the carpenters, I scarce need mention how 
useful they were, for they took in pieces all my 
clumsy unhandy things, and made them clever con- 
venient tables, stools, bedsteads, cupboards, lockers, 
shelves, and every tiling they wanted of that kind. 

But to let them see how Nature made artificers at 
first, I carried the carpenters to see Will Atkins's 
basket-house, as I called it, and they both owned 
they never saw an instance of such natural ingenuity 
before, nor anything so regular and so handily built, 
at least of its kind ; and one of them, when he saw 
it, after musing a good while, turning about to me, 
" I am sure," says he, " that man has no need of us ; 
you need do nothing but give him tools. 11 

Then I brought them out all my store of tools, 
and gave every man a digging spade, a shovel, and 
a rake, for we had no harrows or ploughs ; and to 
every separate place a pickaxe, crow, a broad axe, 
and a saw ; always appointing, that as often as any 
were broken, or worn-out, they should be supplied, 
without grudging, out of the general stores that I 
left behind. 

Nails, staples, hinges, hammers, chisels, knives, 
scissors, and all sorts of tools and iron-work, they 
had without tale as they required ; for no man would 
care to take more than they wanted, and he must be 
a fool that would waste or spoil them on any account 

[118] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



whatever ; and for the use of the smith I left two 
tons of un wrought iron for a supply. 

My magazine of powder and arms which I brought 
them was such, even to profusion, that they could 
not but rejoice at them ; for now they could march, 
as I used to do, with a musket upon each shoulder, 
if there was occasion ; and were able to fight a 
thousand savages, if they had but some little advan- 
tages of situation, which also they could not miss of 
if they had occasion. 

I carried on shore with me the young man whose 
mother was starved to death, and the maid also ; she 
was a sober, well-educated, religious young woman, 
and behaved so inoffensively, that every one gave her 
a good word. She had, indeed, an unhappy life with 
us, there being no woman in the ship but herself ; 
but she bore it with patience. After a while, seeing 
things so well ordered, and in so fine a way of thriv- 
ing upon my island, and considering that they had 
neither business or acqaintance in the East Indies, 
or reason for taking so long a voyage ; I say, con- 
sidering all this, both of them came to me, and de- 
sired I would give them leave to remain on the 
island, and be entered among my family, as they 
called it. 

I agreed to it readily, and they had a little plat of 
ground allotted to them, where they had three tents 
or houses set up, surrounded with a basket-work, 
palisadoed like Atkins's, adjoining to his plantation. 
Their tents were contrived so, that they had each of 
them a room apart to lodge in, and a middle tent, 
like a great storehouse, to lay all their goods 
in, and to eat and drink in. And now the other 
two Englishmen removed their habitation to the 
same place, and so the island was divided into three 
colonies, and no more, viz., the Spaniards, with old 
Friday and the first servants, at my old habitation 

[119] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



under the hill, which was, in a word, the capital city, 
and where they had so enlarged and extended their 
works, as well under as on the outside of the hill, 
that they lived, though perfectly concealed, yet full 
at large. Never was there such a little city in a 
wood, and so hid, I believe, in any part of the world ; 
for I verily believe a thousand men might have 
ranged the island a month, and if they had not 
known there was such a thing, and looked on pur- 
pose for it, they would not have found it ; for the 
trees stood so thick and so close, and grew so fast 
matted into one another, that nothing but cutting 
them down first could discover the place, except the 
only two narrow entrances where they went in and 
out could be found, which was not very easy. One 
of them was just down at the water edge of the 
creek, and it was afterwards above two hundred 
yards to the place ; and the other was up the ladder 
at twice, as I have already formerly described it ; and 
they had a large wood, thick planted, also on the 
top of the hill, which contained above an acre, 
which grew apace, and covered the place from all 
discovery there, with only one narrow place between 
two trees, not easy to be discovered, to enter on that 
side. 

The other colony was that of Will Atkins, where 
there were four families of Englishmen, I mean those 
I had left there, with their wives and children ; three 
savages that were slaves ; the widow and children of 
the Englishman that was killed ; the young man 
and the maid ; and by the way, we made a wife of 
her also before we went away. There were also the 
two carpenters and the tailor, whom I brought with 
me for them ; also the smith, who was a very neces- 
sary man to them, especially as a gunsmith, to take 
care of their arms ; and my other man, whom I 
called Jack-of-all-trades, who was in himself as good 

[ 120 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



almost as twenty men, for he was not only a very 
ingenious fellow, but a very merry fellow ; and be- 
fore I went away we married him to the honest maid 
that came with the youth in the ship I mentioned 
before. 

And now I speak of marrying, it brings me nat- 
urally to say something of the French ecclesiastic 
that I had brought with me out of the ship's crew 
whom I took up at sea. It is true this man was a 
Roman, and perhaps it may give offence to some 
hereafter if I leave anything extraordinary upon 
record of a man whom, before I begin, I must, to 
set him out in just colours, represent in terms very 
much to his disadvantage in the account of Protes- 
tants ; as, first, that he was a Papist ; secondly, a 
Popish priest ; and thirdly, a French Popish priest. 

But justice demands of me to give him a due 
character ; and I must say, he was a grave, sober, 
pious, and most religious person ; exact in his life, 
extensive in his charity, and exemplary in almost 
everything he did. What, then, can any one say 
against my being very sensible of the value of such 
a man, notwithstanding his profession ? though it 
may be my opinion, perhaps, as well as the opinion 
of others who shall read this, that he was mistaken. 

The first hour that I began to converse with him, 
after he had agreed to go with me to the East 
Indies, I found reason to delight exceedingly in his 
conversation ; and he first began with me about 
religion, in the most obliging manner imaginable. 

" Sir," says he, " you have not only, under God " 
(and at that he crossed his breast), " saved my life, 
but you have admitted me to go this voyage in 
your ship, and by your obliging civility have taken 
me into your family, giving me an opportunity of 
free conversation. Now, sir," says he, " you see by 
my habit what my profession is, and I guess by your 

[ 121 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



nation what yours is ; I may think it is my duty, 
and doubtless it is so, to use my utmost endeavours 
on all occasions to bring all the souls I can to the 
knowledge of the truth, and to embrace the Catholic 
doctrine ; but as I am here under your permission, 
and in your family, I am bound, in justice to your 
kindness, as well as in decency and good manners, 
to be under your government ; and therefore I shall 
not, without your leave, enter into any debates on 
the point of religion, in which we may not agree, 
farther than you shall give me leave. 1 ' 

I told him his carriage was so modest, that I could 
not but acknowledge it ; that it was true we were 
such people as they called heretics, but that he was 
not the first Catholic that I had conversed with 
without falling into any inconveniences, or carrying 
the questions to any height in debate ; that he 
should not find himself the worse used for being of 
a different opinion from us ; and if we did not con- 
verse without any dislike on either side upon that 
score, it should be his fault, not ours. 

He replied that he thought all our conversation 
might be easily separated from disputes ; that it was 
not his business to cap principles with every man he 
discoursed with ; and that he rather desired me to 
converse with him as a gentleman, than as a reVig- 
ieuse\ that if I would give him leave at any time to 
discourse upon religious subjects, he would readily 
comply with it ; and that then he did not doubt 
but I would allow him also to defend his own opin- 
ions as well as he could ; but that without my leave 
he would not break in upon me with any such 
thing. 

He told me farther, that he would not cease to do 
all that became him in his office as a priest, as well 
as a private Christian, to procure the good of the 
ship, and the safety of all that was in her ; and 

[ 122 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



though, perhaps, we would not join with him, and 
he could not pray with us, he hoped he might pray 
for us, which he would do upon all occasions. In 
this manner we conversed ; and as he was of a most 
obliging gentleman-like behaviour, so he was, if I 
may be allowed to say so, a man of good sense, and, 
as I believe, of great learning. 

He gave me a most diverting account of his life, 
and of the many extraordinary events of it ; of many 
adventures which had befallen him in the few years 
that he had been abroad in the world, and particu- 
larly this was very remarkable, viz., that in the voy- 
age he was now engaged, he had had the misfortune 
to be five times shipped and unshipped, and never 
to go to the place whither any of the ships he was 
in were at first designed ; that his first intent was to 
have gone to Martinico, and that he went on board 
a ship bound thither at St. Malo ; but being forced 
into Lisbon by bad weather, the ship received some 
damage by running aground in the mouth of the 
river Tagus, and was obliged to unload her cargo 
there ; that finding a Portuguese ship there bound 
to the Madeiras, and ready to sail, and supposing he 
should easily meet with a vessel there bound to 
Martinico, he went on board, in order to sail to the 
Madeiras ; but the master of the Portuguese ship 
being but an indifferent mariner, had been out in 
his reckoning, and they drove to Fayal ; where, 
however, he happened to find a very good market 
for his cargo, which was corn, and therefore resolved 
not to go to the Madeiras, but to load salt at the 
Isle of May, and go away to Newfoundland. He 
had no remedy in this exigence but to go with the 
ship, and had a pretty good voyage as far as the 
Banks, so they call the place where they catch 
the fish, where meeting with a French ship bound 
from France to Quebec, in the river of Canada, and 

[ 123 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



from thence to Martinico, to carry provisions, he 
thought he should have an opportunity to complete 
his first design. But when he came to Quebec the 
master of the ship died, and the ship proceeded no 
farther. So the next voyage he shipped himself for 
France, in the ship that was burnt, when we took 
them up at sea, and then shipped with us for the 
East Indies, as I have already said. Thus he had 
been disappointed in five voyages, all, as I may call 
it, in one voyage, besides what I shall have occasion 
to mention farther of the same person. 

But I shall not make digressions into other men's 
stories which have no relation to my own. I return 
to what concerns our affair in the island. He came 
to me one morning, for he lodged among us all the 
while we were upon the island, and it happened to 
be just when I was going to visit the Englishmen's 
colony at the farthest part of the island ; I say, he 
came to me, and told me with a very grave counte- 
nance that he had for two or three days desired an 
opportunity of some discourse with me, which he 
hoped would not be displeasing to me, because he 
thought it might in some measure correspond with 
my general design, which was the prosperity of my 
new colony, and perhaps might put it at least more 
than he yet thought it was in the way of God's 
blessing. 

I looked a little surprised at the last part of his 
discourse, and turning a little short, " How, sir," 
said I, " can it be said that we are not in the way of 
God's blessing, after such visible assistances and 
wonderful deliverances as we have seen here, and of 
which I have given you a large account ? " 

" If you had pleased, sir," said he, with a world of 
modesty, and yet with great readiness, " to have 
heard me, you would have found no room to have 
been displeased, much less to think so hard of me, 

[ 124 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



that I should suggest that you have not had wonder- 
ful assistances and deliverances ; and I hope, on your 
behalf, that you are in the way of God's blessing, 
and your design is exceeding good, and will prosper. 
But, sir, though it were more so than is even possible 
to you, yet there may be some among you that are 
not equally right in their actions ; and you know 
that in the story of the children of Israel, one Achan 
in the camp removed God's blessing from them, and 
turned His hand so against them, that six and thirty 
of them, though not concerned in the crime, were 
the object of Divine vengeance, and bore the weight 
of that punishment.'' 

I was sensibly touched with his discourse, and told 
him his inference was so just, and the whole design 
seemed so sincere, and was really so religious in its 
own nature, that I was very sorry I had interrupted 
him, and begged him to go on ; and in the meantime, 
because it seemed that what we had both to say 
might take up some time, I told him I was going to 
the Englishmen's plantations, and asked him to go 
with me, and we might discourse of it by the way. 
He told me he would more willingly wait on me 
thither, because there, partly, the thing was acted 
which he desired to speak to me about. So we 
walked on, and I pressed him to be free and plain 
with me in what he had to say. 

" Why then, sir," says he, " be pleased to give me 
leave to lay down a few propositions as the founda- 
tion of what I have to say, that we may not differ 
in the general principles, though we may be of some 
differing opinions in the practice of particulars. 
First, sir, though we differ in some of the doctrinal 
articles of religion, and it is very unhappy that it is 
so, especially in the case before us, as I shall show 
afterwards ; yet there are some general principles in 
which we both agree, viz., first, that there is a God, 

[125] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



and that this God having given us some stated 
general rules for our service and obedience, we ought 
not willingly and knowingly to offend Him, either 
by neglecting to do what He has commanded, or by 
doing what He has expressly forbidden ; and let our 
different religions be what they will, this general 
principle is readily owned by us all, that the bless- 
ing of God does not ordinarily follow a presumptu- 
ous sinning against His command ; and every good 
Christian will be affectionately concerned to prevent 
any that are under his care, living in a total neglect 
of God and His commands. It is not your men 
being Protestants, whatever my opinion may be of 
such, that discharges me from being concerned for 
their souls, and from endeavouring, if it lies before 
me, that they should live in as little distance from 
and enmity with their Maker as possible ; especially 
if you give me leave to meddle so far in your 
circuit." 

I could not yet imagine what he aimed at, and 
told him I granted all he had said, and thanked 
hi in that he would so far concern himself for us ; and 
begged he would explain the particulars of what he 
had observed, that like Joshua, to take his own 
parable, I might put away the accursed thing from 
us. 

" Why then, sir," says he, " I will take the liberty 
you give me ; and there are three things which, if I 
am right, must stand in the way of God's blessing 
upon your endeavours here, and which I should re- 
joice, for your sake, and their own, to see removed. 
And, sir," says he, " I promise myself that you will 
fully agree with me in them all as soon as I name 
them ; especially because I shall convince you that 
every one of them may with great ease, and very 
much to your satisfaction, be remedied. 11 

He gave me no leave to put in any more civilities, 

[ 126] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



but went on. " First, sir," says he, " you have here 
four Englishmen, who have fetched women from among 
the savages, and have taken them as their wives, and 
have had many children by them all, and yet are not 
married to them after any stated legal manner, as 
the laws of God and man require ; and therefore are 
yet, in the sense of both, no less than adulterers, 
and living in adultery. To this, sir," says he, " I 
know you will object, that there was no clergyman or 
priest of any kind, or of any profession, to perform 
the ceremony ; nor any pen and ink, or paper, to 
write down a contract of marriage, and have it signed 
between them. And I know also, sir, what the 
Spaniard governor has told you ; I mean of the 
agreement that he obliged them to make when they 
took these women, viz., that they should choose them 
out by consent, and keep separately to them ; which, 
by the way, is nothing of a marriage, no agreement 
with the women as wives, but only an agreement 
among themselves, to keep them from quarrelling. 

" But, sir, the essence of the sacrament of matri- 
mony (so he called it, being a Roman) consists not 
only in the mutual consent of the parties to take 
one another as man and wife, but in the formal and 
legal obligation that there is in the contract to com- 
pel the man and woman at all times to own and ac- 
knowledge each other ; obliging the men to abstain 
from all other women, to engage in no other contract 
while these subsist ; and on all occasions, as ability 
allows, to provide honestly for them and their 
children ; and to oblige the women to the same, or 
like conditions, mutatis mutandis, on their side. 

u Now, sir," says he, " these men may, when they 
please, or when occasion presents, abandon these 
women, disown their children, leave them to perish, 
and take other women and marry them whilst these 
are living." And here he added with some warmth, 

[127 J 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 

" How, sir, is God honoured in this unlawful liberty ? 
And how shall a blessing succeed your endeavours in 
this place, however good in themselves, and however 
sincere in your design, while these men, who at pres- 
ent are your subjects, under your absolute govern- 
ment and dominion, are allowed by you to live in 
open adultery ? " 

I confess I was struck at the thing itself, but 
much more with the convincing arguments he sup- 
ported it with. For it was certainly true, that 
though they had no clergyman upon the spot, yet a 
formal contract on both sides, made before witnesses, 
and confirmed by any token which they had all 
agreed to be bound by, though it had been but 
breaking a stick between them, engaging the men to 
own these women for their wives upon all occasions, 
and never to abandon them or their children, and 
the women to the same with their husbands, had 
been an effectual lawful marriage in the sight of 
God, and it was a great neglect that it was not 
done. 

But I thought to have gotten off with my young 
priest by telling him, that all that part was done 
when I was not here ; and they had lived so many 
years with them now, that if it was an adultery it 
was past remedy, they could do nothing in it now. 

" Sir," says he, " asking your pardon for such 
freedom, you are right in this ; that it being done in 
your absence, you could not be charged with that 
part of the crime ; but I beseech you, flatter not 
yourself that you are not therefore under an obliga- 
tion to do your utmost now to put an end to it. 
How can you think but that, let the time past lie 
on whom it will, all the guilt for the future will lie 
entirely upon you ? Because it is certainly in your 
power now to put an end to it, and in nobody's 
power but yours." 

[ 128 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



I was so dull still, that I did not take him right, 
but I imagined that by putting an end to it he 
meant that I should part them, and not suffer them 
to live together any longer ; and I said to him I 
could not do this by any means, for that it would 
put the whole island into confusion. He seemed 
surprised that I should so far mistake him. " No, 
sir,"" says he, " I do not mean that you should now 
separate them, but legally and effectually marry 
them now ; and as, sir, my way of marrying them 
may not be so easy to reconcile them to, though it 
will be as effectual even by your own laws ; so your 
way may be as well before God, and as valid among 
men ; I mean by a written contract, signed by both 
man and woman, and by all the witnesses present, 
which all the laws of Europe would decree to be 
valid: 1 

I was amazed to see so much true piety, and so 
much sincerity of zeal, besides the unusual impartial- 
ity in his discourse, as to his own party or church, 
and such true warmth for the preserving people that 
he had no knowledge of or relation to; I say, for 
preserving them from transgressing the laws of God ; 
the like of which I had indeed not met with any- 
where. But recollecting what he had said of marry- 
ing them by a written contract, which I knew would 
stand too, I returned it back upon him, and told 
him I granted all that he had said to be just, and 
on his part very kind ; that I would discourse with 
the men upon the point now, when I came to them ; 
and I knew no reason why they should scruple to let 
him marry them all ; which I knew well enough 
would be granted to be as authentic and valid in 
England, as if they were married by one of our own 
clergymen. What was afterwards done in this 
matter, I shall speak of by itself. 

I then pressed him to tell me what was the second 
VOL. II. -9 [129] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



complaint which he had to make, acknowledging 
that I was very much his debtor for the first, and 
thanked him heartily for it. He told me he would 
use the same freedom and plainness in the second, 
and hoped I would take it as well; and this was, 
that notwithstanding these English subjects of mine, 
as he called them, had lived with those women for 
almost seven years, had taught them to speak Eng- 
lish, and even to read it ; and that they were, as he 
perceived, women of tolerable understanding and 
capable of instruction ; yet they had not to this 
hour taught them anything of the Christian relig- 
ion ; no, not so much as to know that there was a 
God, or a worship, or in what manner God was to 
be served ; or that their own idolatry, and worship- 
ping they knew not whom, was false and absurd. 

This, he said, was an unaccountable neglect, and 
what God would certainly call them to account for, 
and perhaps at last take the w ork out of their hands. 
He spoke this very affectionately and warmly. "I 
am persuaded, 11 says he, " had those men lived in 
the savage country whence their wives came, the 
savages would have taken more pains to have brought 
them to be idolaters, and to worship the devil, than 
^ny of these men, so far as he could see, had taken 
with them to teach them the knowledge of the true 
God. Now, sir, 11 said he, " though I do not ac- 
knowledge your religion, or you mine, yet we should 
be glad to see the deviPs servants, and the subjects 
of his kingdom, taught to know the general princi- 
ples of the Christian religion ; that they might 
at least hear of God, and of a Redeemer, and 
of the resurrection, and of a future state, things 
which we all believe ; they had at least been so much 
nearer coming into the bosom of the true Church, 
than they are now in the public profession of idolatry 
and devil worship. 11 

[130] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



I could hold no longer; I took him in my arms, 
and embraced him with an excess of passion. "How 
far,' 1 said I to him, "have I been from understand- 
ing the most essential part of a Christian, viz., to 
love the interest of the Christian Church, and the 
good of other men's souls ! I scarce have known 
what belongs to being a Christian." — "Oh, sir, do 
not say so," replied he ; " this thing is not your 
fault; 1 — " No," says I; "but why did I never lay 
it to heart as well as you?" — "'Tis not too late 
yet," said he ; " be not too forward to condemn 
yourself." — " But what can be done now ?" said I ; 
"you see I am going away." — "Will you give me 
leave," said he, " to talk with these poor men about 
it?" — " Yes, with all my heart," said I; "and I 
will oblige them to give heed to what you say too." 
— "As to that," said he, " we must leave them to 
the mercy of Christ ; but it is our business to assist 
them, encourage them, and instruct them ; and if 
you will give me leave, and God His blessing, I do 
not doubt but the poor ignorant souls shall be 
brought home into the great circle of Christianity, 
into the particular faith that we all embrace ; and 
that even while you stay here." Upon this I said, " I 
shall not only give you leave, but give you a thou- 
sand thanks for it." What followed on this account 
I shall mention also again in its place. 

I now pressed him for the third article in which 
we were to blame. " Why really," says he, "it is of 
the same nature, and I will proceed, asking your 
leave, with the same plainness as before ; it is about 
your poor savages, who are, as I may say, your 
conquered subjects. It is a maxim, sir, that is, or 
ought to be received among all Christians, of what 
Church, or pretended Church soever, viz., The Chris- 
tian knowledge ought to be propagated by all pos- 
sible means, and on all possible occasions. "T is on 

[181] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



this principle that our Church sends missionaries 
into Persia, India, and China ; and that our clergy, 
even of the superior sort, willingly engage in the 
most hazardous voyages, and the most dangerous 
residence among murderers and barbarians, to teach 
them the knowledge of the true God, and to bring 
them over to embrace the Christian faith. Now, 
sir, you have such an opportunity here to have six 
or seven and thirty poor savages brought over from 
idolatry to the knowledge of God, their Maker and 
Redeemer, that I wonder how you can pass such an 
occasion of doing good, which is really worth the 
expense of a man's whole life." 

I was now struck dumb indeed, and had not one 
word to say ; I had here a spirit of true Christian 
zeal for God and religion before me, let his parti- 
cular principles be of what kind soever. As for me, 
I had not so much as entertained a thought of this 
in my heart before, and I believe should not have 
thought of it ; for I looked upon these savages as 
slaves, and people whom, had we had any work for 
them to do, we would have used as such, or would 
have been glad to have transported them to any 
other part of the world ; for our business was to get 
rid of them, and we would all have been satisfied if 
they had been sent to any country, so they had 
never seen their own. But to the case : I say, I was 
confounded at his discourse, and knew not what 
answer to make him. He looked earnestly at me, 
seeing me in some disorder. " Sir,'" says he, " I 
shall be very sorry if what I have said gives you 
any offence." — u No, no," says I, " I am offended 
with nobody but myself ; but I am perfectly con- 
founded not only to think that I should never take 
any notice of this before, but with reflecting what 
notice I am able to take of it now. You know, sir," 
said I, " what circumstances I am in ; I am bound 

[ 132 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



to the East Indies, in a ship freighted by merchants, 
and to whom it would be an insufferable piece of 
injustice to detain their ship here, the men lying all 
this while at victuals and wages upon the owners'* 
account. It is true I agreed to be allowed twelve 
days here, and if I stay more I must pay £3 sterling 
per diem demurrage ; nor can I stay upon demur- 
rage above eight days more, and I have been here 
thirteen days already, so that I am perfectly unable 
to engage in this work, unless I would suffer myself 
to be left behind here again ; in which case, if this 
single ship should miscarry in any part of her voy- 
age, I should be just in the same condition that I 
was left in here at first, and from which I have been 
so wonderfully delivered." 

He owned the case was very hard upon me as to 
my voyage, but laid it home upon my conscience, 
whether the blessing of saving seven and thirty souls 
was not worth my venturing all I had in the world 
for ? I was not so sensible of that as he was. I re- 
turned upon him thus : " Why, sir, it is a valuable 
thing indeed to be an instrument in God\s hand to 
convert seven and thirty heathens to the knowledge 
of Christ ; but as you are an ecclesiastic, and are 
given over to the work, so that it seems so naturally 
to fall into the way of your profession, how is it 
that you do not rather offer yourself to undertake it, 
than press me to it ? " 

Upon this he faced about, just before me, as we 
walked along, and putting me to a full stop, made 
me a very low bow. " I most heartily thank God, 
and you, sir," says he, " for giving me so evident a 
call to so blessed a work ; and if you think your- 
self discharged from it, and desire me to undertake 
it, I will most readily do it, and think it a happy 
reward for all the hazards and difficulties of such 
a broken disappointed voyage as I have met with, 

[133] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



that I may be dropped at last into so glorious a 
work." 

I discovered a kind of rapture in his ftxce while he 
spoke this to me ; his eyes sparkled like fire, his 
face glowed, and his colour came and went as if he 
had been falling into fits ; in a word, he was fired 
\\ i tli the joy of being embarked in such a work. I 
paused a considerable while before I could tell what 
to say to him, for I was really surprised to find a 
man of such sincerity and zeal, and carried out in 
his zeal beyond the ordinary rate of men, not of his 
profession only, but even of any profession whatso- 
ever. But after I had considered it awhile, I asked 
him seriously if he was in earnest, and that he 
would venture, on the single consideration of any at- 
tempt on those poor people, to be locked up in an 
implanted island for perhaps his life, and at last 
might not know whether he should be able to do 
them any good, or not ? 

He turned short upon me, and asked me what I 
called a venture ? " Pray, sir, 11 said he, " what do 
you think I consented to go in your ship to the East 
Indies for ? " — " Nay said I,' "that I know not, 
unless it was to preach to the Indians. r> — " Doubt- 
less it was,"" said he ; " and do you think if I can 
convert these seven and thirty men to the faith of 
Christ, it is not worth my time, though I should 
never be fetched off the island again ? Nay, is it 
not infinitely of more worth to save so many souls 
than my life is, or the life of twenty more of the 
same profession ? Yes, sir," says he, " I would give 
Christ and the Blessed Virgin thanks all my days, if 
I could be made the least happy instrument of sav- 
ing the souls of these poor men, though I was never 
to set my foot off this island, or see my native coun- 
try any more. But since you will honour me," says 
he, " with putting me into this work, for which I 

[ 134] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



will pray for you all the days of my life, I have one 
humble petition to vou," said he, " besides. 1 '' — 
" What is that ? " said I. — " Why," says he, " it 
is, that you will leave your man Friday with me, to 
be my interpreter to them, and to assist me ; for 
without some help I cannot speak to them, or they 
to me." 

I was sensibly troubled at his requesting Friday, 
because I could not think of parting with him, and 
that for many reasons. He had been the companion 
of my travels ; he was not only faithful to me, but 
sincerely affectionate to the last degree ; and I had 
resolved to do something considerable for him if he 
outlived me, as it was probable he would. Then I 
knew that as I had bred Friday up to be a Protestant 
it would quite confound him to bring him to em- 
brace another profession ; and he would never, 
while his eyes were open, believe that his old master 
was a heretic, and would be damned ; and this might 
in the end ruin the poor fellow's principles, and so 
turn him to his first idolatry. 

However, a sudden thought relieved me in this 
strait, and it was this : I told him I could not say 
that I was willing to part with Friday on any ac- 
count whatever ; though a work that to him was of 
more value than his life, ought to be to me of much 
less value than the keeping or parting with a ser- 
vant ; but on the other hand, I was persuaded that 
Friday would by no means consent to part with me ; 
and I could not force him to it without his consent 
without manifest injustice, because I had promised 
and engaged him to me that he would never leave 
me unless I put him away. 

He seemed very much concerned at it ; for he had 
no rational access to these poor people, seeing he did 
not understand one word of their language, nor they 
one word of his. To remove this difficulty, I told 

[135] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



him Friday^ father had learnt Spanish, which I 
found he also understood, and he should serve him 
for an interpreter ; so he was much better satisfied, 
and nothing could persuade him but he would stay 
to endeavour to convert them ; but Providence gave 
another and very happy turn to all this. 

I come back now to the first part of his objec- 
tions. When we came to the Englishmen, I sent 
for them all together ; and after some account given 
them of what I had done for them, viz., what neces- 
sary things I had provided for them, and how they 
were distributed, which they were very sensible of, 
and very thankful for, I began to talk to them of 
the scandalous life they led, and gave them a full 
account of the notice the clergyman had already 
taken of it ; and arguing how unchristian and irre- 
ligious a life it was, I first asked them if they were 
married men or bachelors ? They soon explained their 
condition to me, and showed me that two of them 
were widowers, and the other three were single men 
or bachelors. I asked them with what consciences 
they could take these women, and lie with them, as 
they had done, call them their wives, and have so 
many children by them, and not be married lawfully 
to them ? 

They all gave me the answer that I expected, viz., 
that there was nobody to marry them ; that they 
agreed before the governor to keep them as their 
wives, and to keep them and own them as their 
wives ; and they thought, as things stood with them, 
they were as legally married as if they had been 
married by a parson, and with all the formalities in 
the world. 

I told them that no doubt they were married in 
the sight of God, and were bound in conscience to 
keep them as their wives ; but that the laws of men 
being otherwise, they might pretend they were not 

[136] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



married, and so desert the poor women and children 
hereafter ; and that their wives, being poor, desolate 
w omen, friendless and moneyless, would have no way 
to help themselves. I therefore told them, that 
unless I was assured of their honest intent, I could 
do nothing for them ; but would take care that what 
I did should be for the women and their children 
without them ; and that unless they would give some 
assurances that they would marry the women, I could 
not think it was convenient they should continue 
together as man and wife ; for that it was both 
scandalous to men and offensive to God, who they 
could not think would bless them if they went on 
thus. 

All this went on as I expected ; and they told me, 
especially Will Atkins, who seemed now to speak for 
the rest, that they loved their wives as well as if they 
had been born in their own native country, and would 
not leave them upon any account whatever ; and 
they did verily believe their wives were as virtuous 
and as modest, and did to the utmost of their skill 
as much for them and for their children as any 
women could possibly do, and they would not part 
with them on any account ; and Will Atkins for his 
own particular added, if any man would take him 
away, and offer to carry him home to England, and 
make him captain of the best man-of-war in the 
navy, he would not go with him if he might not 
carry his wife and children with him ; and if there 
was a clergyman in the ship, he would be married to 
her now with all his heart. 

This was just as I would have it. The priest was 
not with me at that moment, but was not far off ; so 
to try him farther, I told him I had a clergyman 
with me, and if he was sincere I would have him 
married the next morning, and bid him consider of 
it, and talk with the rest. He said, as for himself, 

[137] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



he need not consider of it at all, for he was very 
ready to do it, and was glad I had a minister with 
me ; and he believed they would be all willing also. 
I then told him that my friend the minister was a 
Frenchman, and could not speak English, but that I 
would act the clerk between them. He never so 
much as asked me whether he was Papist or Protes- 
tant, which was indeed what I was afraid of; but, I 
say, they never inquired about it. So we parted ; I 
went back to my clergyman, and Will Atkins went 
in to talk with his companions. I desired the French 
gentleman not to say anything to them till the busi- 
ness was thorough ripe, and I told him what answer 
the men had given me. 

Before I went from their quarter they all came to 
me, and told me they had been considering what I 
had said ; that they were very glad to hear I had a 
clergyman in my company ; and they were very 
willing to give me the satisfaction I desired, and to 
be formally married as soon as I pleased ; for they 
were far from desiring to part with their wives ; and 
that they meant nothing but what was very honest 
when they chose them. So I appointed them to 
meet me the next morning, and that in the mean- 
time they should let their wives know the meaning 
of the marriage law ; and that it was not only to 
prevent any scandal, but also to oblige them that 
they should not forsake them, whatever might 
happen. 

The women were easily made sensible of the mean- 
ing of the thing, and were very well satisfied with it, 
as indeed they had reason to be ; so they failed not 
to attend all together at my apartment the next 
morning, where I brought out my clergyman ; and 
though he had not on a minister's gown, after the 
manner of England, or the habit of a priest, after 
the manner of France ; yet having a black vest, 

[ 138 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 

something like a cassoek, with a sash round it, he 
did not look very unlike a minister ; and as for his 
language, I was his interpreter. 

But the seriousness of his behaviour to them, and 
the scruples he made of marrying the women because 
they were not baptized and professed Christians, 
gave them an exceeding reverence for his person ; 
and there was no need after that to inquire whether 
lie was a clergyman or no. 

Indeed I was afraid his scruple would have been 
carried so far as that he would not have married 
them at all ; nay, notwithstanding all I was able to 
say to him he resisted me, though modestly, yet very 
steadily, and at last refused absolutely to marry 
them unless he had first talked with the men and 
the women too ; and though at first I was a little 
backward to it, yet at last I agreed to it with a good 
will, perceiving the sincerity of his design. 

When he came to them, he let them know that I 
had acquainted him with their circumstances, and 
with the present design ; that he was very willing to 
perform that part of his function, and marry them 
as I had desired ; but that before he could do it, he 
must take the liberty to talk with them. He told 
them that in the sight of all indifferent men, and in 
the sense of the laws of society, they had lived all this 
while in an open adultery ; and that it was true 
that nothing but the consenting to marry, or effect- 
ually separating them from one another now, could 
put an end to it ; but there was a difficulty in it too, 
with respect to the laws of Christian matrimony, 
which he was not fully satisfied about, viz., that of 
marrying one that is a professed Christian to a 
savage, an idolater, and a heathen, one that is not 
baptized ; and yet that he did not see that there was 
time left for it to endeavour to persuade the women 
to be baptized, or to profess the name of Christ, 

[139] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



whom they had, he doubted, heard nothing of, and 
without which they could not be baptized. 

He told them, he doubted they were but indiffer- 
ent Christians themselves ; that they had but little 
knowledge of God or of His ways, and therefore he 
could not expect that they had said much to their 
wives on that head yet ; but that unless they would 
promise him to use their endeavour with their wives 
to persuade them to become Christians, and would, 
as well as they could, instruct them in the knowledge 
and belief of God that made them, and to worship 
Jesus Christ that redeemed them, he could not 
many them ; for he would have no hand in joining 
Christians with savages ; nor was it consistent with 
the principles of the Christian religion, and was in- 
deed expressly forbidden in God's law. 

They heard all this very attentively, and I de- 
livered it very faithfully to them from nis mouth, as 
near his own words as I could, only sometimes add- 
ing something of my own to convince them how just 
it was, and how I was of his mind ; and I always 
very faithfully distinguished between what I said for 
myself and what were the clergyman's words. They 
told me it was very true what the gentleman had 
said, that they were but very indifferent Christians 
themselves, and that they never talked to their 
wives about religion. — " Lord, sir," says Will At- 
kins, M how should we teach them religion ? Why, 
we know nothing ourselves ; and besides, sir," said 
he, " should we go to talk to them of God, and 
Jesus Christ, and heaven and hell, 'twould be to 
make them laugh at us, and ask us what we believe 
ourselves ; and if we should tell them we believe all 
the things that we speak of to them, such as of good 
people going to heaven, and wicked people to the 
devil, they would ask us where we intend to go 
ourselves that believe all this, and are such wicked 

[140] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



fellows, as we indeed are. Why, sir, "t is enough to 
give them a surfeit of religion at first hearing. 
Folks must have some religion themselves before 
they pretend to teach other people.'" — 44 Will At- 
kins," said I to him, " though I am afraid what you 
say has too much truth in it, yet can you not tell 
your wife that she 's in the wrong ; that there is a 
God, and a religion better than her own ; that her 
gods are idols ; that they can neither hear or speak ; 
that there is a great Being that made all things, and 
that can destroy all that He had made ; that He 
rewards the good, and punishes the bad ; and that 
we are to be judged by Him, at last, for all we do 
here ? You are not so ignorant but even Nature 
itself will teach you that all this is true ; and I am 
satisfied you know it all to be true, and believe it 
yourself." 

44 That 's true, sir," said Atkins ; 44 but with what 
face can I say anything to my wife of all this, when 
she will tell me immediately it cannot be true ? " — 
44 Not true ! " said I ; 44 what do you mean by 
that ? " — 44 Why, sir," said he, 44 she will tell me it 
cannot be true ; that this God I shall tell her of can 
be just, or can punish or reward, since I am not 
punished and sent to the devil, that have been such 
a wicked creature, as she knows I have been, even to 
her, and to everybody else ; and that I should be 
suffered to live, that have been always acting so con- 
trary to what I must tell her is good, and to what 
I ought to have done." 

44 Why truly, Atkins," said I, 44 1 am afraid thou 
speakest too much truth ; " and with that I let the 
clergyman know what Atkins had said, for he was 
impatient to know. 44 Oh ! " said the priest, 44 tell 
him there is one thing will make him the best minis- 
ter in the world to his wife, and that is repentance ; 
for none teach repentance like true penitents. He 

[141] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



wants nothing but to repent, and then he will be so 
much the better qualified to instruct his wife ; he 
will then be able to tell her that there is not only a 
God, and that He is the just rewarder of good and 
evil ; but that He is a merciful Being, and with 
infinite goodness and long-suffering forbears to 
punish those that offend ; waiting to be gracious, and 
willing not the death of a sinner, but rather that 
he should return and live ; that oftentimes suffers 
wicked men to go on a long time, and even reserves 
damnation to the general day of retribution ; that it 
is a clear evidence of God, and of a future state, that 
righteous men receive not their reward, or wicked 
men their punishment, until they come into another 
world ; and this will lead him to teach his wife the 
doctrine of the resurrection, and of the last judg- 
ment. Let him but repent for himself, he will bean 
excellent preacher of repentance to his wife." 

I repeated all this to Atkins, who looked very 
serious all the while, and who, we could easily per- 
ceive, was more than ordinarily affected with it; 
when being eager, and hardly suffering me to make 
an end, " I know all this, master, r> says he, "and a 
great deal more ; but I han't the impudence to bilk 
thus to my wife, when God and my own conscience 
knows, and my wife will be an undeniable evidence 
against me, that I have lived as I had never heard 
of a God or future state, or anything about it ; and 
to talk of my repenting, alas! " and with that he 
fetched a deep sigh, and I could see that tears 
stood in his eyes, " 't is past all that with me." — 
" Past it, Atkins ! " said I ; " what dost thou mean 
by that ? " — "I know well enough what I mean," 
Bays he ; "I mean 't is too late ; and that is too 
true." 

I told my clergyman word for word what he said. 
The poor zealous priest (I must call him so, for be 

[ 142] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



his opinion what it will, ho had certainly a most 
singular affection for the good of other men's souls, 
and it would be hard to think he had not the like 
for his own), I say, this zealous, affectionate man 
could not refrain tears also ; but recovering himself, 
he said to me, " Ask him but one question, Is he 
easy that it is too late, or is he troubled, and wishes 
it were not so?" I put the question fairly to 
Atkins ; and he answered with a great deal of pas- 
sion, how could any man be easy in a condition that 
certainly must end in eternal destruction ? that he 
was far from being easy ; but that, on the contrary, 
he believed it would one time or other ruin him. 
"What do you mean by that?" said I. "Why," 
he said, " he believed he should, one time or other, 
cut his throat to put an end to the terror of it." 

The clergyman shook his head, with a great con- 
cern in his face, when I told him all this ; but turn- 
ing quick to me upon it, says he, " If that be his 
case, you may assure him it is not too late ; Christ 
will give him repentance. But pray," says he, "ex- 
plain this to him, that as no man is saved but by 
Christ, and the merits of His passion, procuring 
Divine mercy for him, how can it be too late for any 
man to receive mercy ? Does he think he is able to 
sin beyond the power or reach of Divine mercy ? 
Pray tell him, there may be a time when provoked 
mercy will no longer strive, and when God may 
refuse to hear ; but that ''t is never too late for men 
to ask mercy ; and we that are Christ's servants are 
commanded to preach mercy at all times, in the 
name of Jesus Christ, to all those that sincerely 
repent ; so that 't is never too late to repent." 

I told Atkins all this, and he heard me with great 
earnestness ; but it seemed as if he turned off the dis- 
course to the rest ; for he said to me he would go 
and have some talk with his wife ; so he went out 

[ 143 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



awhile, and we talked to the rest. I perceived they 
were all stupidly ignorant as to matters of religion, 
much as I was when I went rambling away from my 
father ; and yet that there were none of them back- 
ward to hear what had been said ; and all of them 
seriously promised that they would talk with their 
wives about it, and do their endeavour to persuade 
them to turn Christians. 

The clergyman smiled upon me when I reported 
what answer they gave, but said nothing a good 
while ; but at last shaking his head, w We that are 
Christ's servants," says he, " can go no further than 
to exhort and instruct ; and when men comply, sub- 
mit to the reproof, and promise what we ask, t is all 
we can do. We are bound to accept their good 
words ; but believe me, sir," said he, " whatever you 
may have known of the life of that man you call 
Will Atkins, I believe he is the only sincere convert 
among them. I take that man to be a true peni- 
tent ; I won't despair of the rest, but that man is 
apparently struck with the sense of his past life; 
and I doubt not but when he comes to talk religion 
to his wife, he will talk himself effectually into it ; 
for attempting to teach others is sometimes the best 
way of teaching ourselves. I knew a man, who 
having nothing but a summary notion of religion 
himself, and being wicked and profligate to the last 
degree in his life, made a thorough reformation in 
himself by labouring to convert a Jew. If that poor 
Atkins begins but once to talk seriously of Jesus 
Christ to his wife, my life for it he talks himself 
into a thorough convert, makes himself a penitent ; 
and who knows what may follow ? 11 

Upon this discourse, however, and their promising, 
as above, to endeavour to persuade their wives to em- 
brace Christianity, he married the other three couple ; 
but Will Atkins and his wife were not yet come in. 

[ 144] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



After this my clergyman, waiting awhile, was curious 
to know where Atkins was gone ; and turning to me, 
says he, " I entreat you, sir, let us walk out of your 
labyrinth here and look ; I dare say we shall find 
this poor man somewhere or other talking seriously 
to his wife, and teaching her already something of 
religion. " I began to be of the same mind ; so we 
went out together, and I carried him a way which 
none knew but myself, and where the trees were so 
thick set, as that it was not easy to see through the 
thicket of leaves, and far harder to see in than to see 
out ; when coming to the edge of the wood I saw 
Atkins and his tawny savage wife sitting under the 
shade of a bush, very eager in discourse. I stopped 
short till my clergyman came up to me, and then 
having showed him where they were, we stood and 
looked very steadily at them a good while. 

We observed him very earnest with her, pointing 
up to the sun, and to every quarter of the heavens, 
then down to the earth, then out to the sea, then to 
himself, then to her, to the woods, to the trees. 
" Now," says my clergyman, " you see my words are 
made good, the man preaches to her ; mark him now, 
he is telling her that our God has made him, and 
her, and the heavens, the earth, the sea, the woods, 
the trees, &c." n — "I believe he is,"" said I. Imme- 
diately we perceived Will Atkins start up upon his 
feet, fall down on his knees, and lift up both his 
hands ; we suppose he said something, but we could 
not hear him ; it was too far for that. He did not 
continue kneeling half a minute, but comes and sits 
down again by his wife, and talks to her again. We 
perceived then the woman very attentive, but whether 
she said anything or no we could not tell. While 
the poor fellow was upon his knees, I could see the 
tears run plentifully down my clergyman^ cheeks, 
and I could hardly forbear myself ; but it was a great 
vol. ii. — 10 [ 145 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



affliction to us both that we were not near enough to 
hear anything that passed between them. 

Well, however, we could come no nearer for fear 
of disturbing them ; so we resolved to see an end of 
this piece of still conversation, and it spoke loud 
enough to us without the help of voice. He sat 
down again, as I have said, close by her, and talked 
again earnestly to her, and two or three times we 
could see him embrace her most passionately ; another 
time we saw him take out his handkerchief and wipe 
her eyes, and then kiss her again, with a kind of 
transport very unusual ; and after several of these 
things we see him, on a sudden, jump up again, and 
lend her his hand to help her up, when immediately 
leading her by the hand a step or two, they both 
kneeled down together, and continued so about two 
minutes. 

My friend could bear it no longer, but cries out 
aloud, " St. Paul, St. Paul, behold he prayeth ! " 
I was afraid Atkins would hear him, therefore I 
entreated him to withhold himself awhile, that we 
might see an end of the scene, which to me, I must 
confess, was the most affecting, and yet the most 
agreeable, that ever I saw in my life. Well, he 
strove with himself, and contained himself for awhile, 
but was in such raptures of joy to think that the poor 
heathen woman was become a Christian, that he was 
not able to contain himself. He wept several times ; 
then throwing up his hands and crossing his breast, 
said over several things ejaculatory, and by way of 
giving God thanks for so miraculous a testimony of 
. the success of our endeavours. Some he spoke softly, 
and I could not well hear ; others audibly ; some in 
Latin, some in French ; then two or three times the 
tears of joy would interrupt him, that he could not 
speak at all. But I begged that he would compose 
himself, and let us more narrowly and fully observe 

[ 146] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



what was before us, which he did for a time, and the 
scene was not ended there yet; for after the poor 
man and his wife were risen again from their knees, 
we observed he stood talking still eagerly to her ; 
and we observed by her motion that she was greatly 
affected with what he said, by her frequent lifting up 
her hands, laying her hand to her breast, and such 
other postures as usually express the greatest serious- 
ness and attention. This continued about half a 
quarter of an hour, and then they walked away 
too ; so that we could see no more of them in that 
situation. 

I took this interval to talk with my clergyman ; 
and first I told him, I was glad to see the particulars 
we had both been witnesses to; that though I was 
hard enough of belief in such cases, yet that I began 
to think it was all very sincere here, both in the man 
and his wife, however ignorant they might both be ; 
and I hoped such a beginning would have a yet more 
happy end ; " and who knows," said I, 66 but these 
two may in time, by instruction and example, work 
upon some of the others ? " — M Some of them ! " 
said he, turning quick upon me, " ay, upon all of 
them. Depend upon it, if those two savages, for he 
has been but little better as you relate it, should 
embrace Jesus Christ, they will never leave till they 
work upon all the rest ; for true religion is naturally 
communicative, and he that is once made a Christian 
will never leave a pagan behind him if he can help 
it." I owned it was a most Christian principle to 
think so, and a testimony of a true zeal, as well as a 
generous heart in him. " But, my friend," said I, 
u will you give me leave to start one difficulty here ? 
I cannot tell how to object the least thing against 
that affectionate concern which you show for the 
turning the poor people from their paganism to the 
Christian religion ; but how does this comfort you, 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



while these people are, in your account, out of the 
pale of the Catholic Church, without which, you 
believe, there is no salvation, so that you esteem 
these but heretics ; and for other reasons, as effectu- 
ally lost as the pagans themselves ? " 

To this he answered with abundance of candour 
and Christian charity, thus : " Sir, I am a Catholic 
of the Roman Church, and a priest of the order of 
St. Benedict, and I embrace all the principles of the 
Roman faith ; but yet, if you will believe me, and 
that I do not speak in compliment to you, or in 
respect to my circumstances and your civilities ; I 
say, nevertheless, I do not look upon you, who call 
yourselves reformed, without some charity. I dare 
not say, though I know it is our opinion in general 
— I say, I dare not say that you cannot be saved ; 
I will by no means limit the mercy of Christ so far 
as to think that He cannot receive you into the 
bosom of His Church, in a manner to us unper- 
ceivable, and which it is impossible for us to know ; 
and I hope you have the same charitv for us. I 
pray daily for your being all restored to Christ's 
Church, by whatsoever methods He, who is all-wise, 
is pleased to direct. In the meantime, sure you will 
allow it to consist with me, as a Roman, to distin- 
guish far between a Protestant and a pagan ; be- 
tween one that calls on Jesus Christ, though in a 
way which I do not think is according to the true 
faith, and a savage, a barbarian, that knows no God, 
no Christ, no Redeemer ; and if you are not within 
the pale of the Catholic Church, we hope you are 
nearer being restored to it than those that knew 
nothing of God or His Church ; and I rejoice, there- 
fore, when I see this poor man, who, you say, has 
been a profligate, and almost a murderer, kneel 
down and pray to Jesus Christ, as we suppose he 
did, though not fully enlightened; believing that 

[ 148 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



God, from whom every such work proceeds, will sen- 
sibly touch his heart, and bring him to the further 
knowledge of that truth in His own time. And if 
God shall influence this poor man to convert and 
instruct the poor ignorant savage his wife, I can 
never believe that he shall be cast away himself ; and 
have I not reason then to rejoice the nearer any are 
brought to the knowledge of Christ, though they 
may not be brought quite home into the bosom of 
the Catholic Church, just in the time when I may 
desire it ; leaving it to the goodness of Christ to 
perfect His work in His own time, and in His own 
way ? Certainly I would rejoice if all the savages 
in America were brought, like this poor woman, to 
pray to God, though they were to be all Protestants 
at first, rather than they should continue pagans 
and heathens ; firmly believing, that He that had 
bestowed the first light to them, would further illu- 
minate them with a beam of His heavenly grace, 
and bring them into the pale of His Church, when 
He should see good." 

I was astonished at the sincerity and temper of 
this truly pious Papist, as much as I was oppressed 
by the power of his reasoning ; and it presently oc- 
curred to my thoughts that if such a temper was 
universal, we might be all Catholic Christians, what- 
ever church or particular profession we joined to, or 
joined in ; that a spirit of charity would soon work 
us all up into right principles ; and, in a word, as he 
thought that the like charity would make us all 
Catholics, so I told him I believed had all the mem- 
bers of his Church the like moderation, they would 
soon be all Protestants ; and there we left that part, 
for we never disputed at all. 

However, I talked to him another way ; and taking 
him by the hand, " My friend," says I, " I wish all 
the clergy of the Romish Church were blessed with 

[ 149] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



such moderation, and had an equal share of your 
charity. I am entirely of your opinion ; but I must 
tell you, that if you should preach such doctrine 
in Spain or Italy, they would put you into the 
Inquisition."" 

" It may be so," said he ; 44 1 know not what the) 
might do in Spain or Italy ; but I will not say they 
would be the better Christians for that severity, for 
I am sure there is no heresy in too much charity. 11 

Well, as Will Atkins and his wife were gone, our 
business there was over, so we went back our own 
way, and when we came back we found them waiting 
to be called in. Observing this, I asked my clergy- 
man if we should discover to him that we had seen 
him under the bush, or no? and it was his opinion 
we should not ; but that we should talk to him first, 
and hear what he would say to us. So we called him 
in alone, nobody being in the place but ourselves ; 
and I began with him thus : 

" Will Atkins, 11 said I, " prythee what education 
had you ? What was your father ? 11 

W. A. A better man than ever I shall be. Sir, 
my father was a clergyman. 

li. C. What education did he give you ? 

W. A. He would have taught me well, sir ; but I 
despised all education, instruction, or correction, like 
a beast as I was. 

It. C. It "s true, Solomon says, " He that despises 
reproof is brutish. 11 

W. A. Ay, sir, I was brutish indeed ; I murdered 
my father ; for God^ sake, sir, talk no more about 
that, sir ; I murdered my poor father. 

Pr. Ha ! a murderer ! 

[Here the priest started, for I interpreted every 
word as he spoke it, and looked pale. It seems he 
believed that Will had really killed his own father.] 

R. C, No, no, sir ; I do not understand him so. 

[150] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



Will Atkins, explain yourself. You did not kill your 
father, did you, with your own hand ? 

IV. A. No, sir, I did not eat his throat ; but I eut 
the thread of his comforts, and shortened his days ; 
I broke his heart by the most ungrateful, unnatural 
return for the most tender, affectionate treatment 
that ever father gave, or child could receive. 

R. C. Well, I did not ask you about your father 
to extort this confession ; I pray God give you re- 
pentance for it, and forgive you that and all your 
other sins ; but I asked you because I see that, though 
you have not much learning, yet you are not so 
ignorant as some are in things that are good ; that 
you have known more of religion a great deal than 
you have practised. 

W. A. Though you, sir, did not extort the con- 
fession that I made about my father, conscience does ; 
and whenever we come to look back upon our lives, 
the sins against our indulgent parents are certainly 
the first that touch us ; the wounds they make lie the 
deepest ; and the weight they leave will lie heaviest 
upon the mind of all the sins we can commit. 

R. C. You talk too feelingly and sensibly for me, 
Atkins ; I cannot bear it. 

W. A. You bear it, master ! I dare say you know 
nothing of it. 

R. C. Yes, Atkins, every shore, every hill, nay, I 
may say every tree in this island, is witness to the 
anguish of my soul for my ingratitude and base 
usage of a good tender father — a father much like 
yours by your description ; and I murdered my father 
as well as you, Will Atkins ; but I think for all that 
my repentance is short of yours too, by a great deal. 

I would have said more, if I could have restrained 
my passions ; but I thought this poor man's repent- 
ance was so much sincerer than mine, that I was 
going to leave off the discourse and retire, for I was 

[151] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



surprised with what he said, and thought that, in- 
stead of my going about to teach and instruct him, 
the man was a teacher and instructor to me, in a 
most surprising and unexpected manner. 

I laid all this before the young clergyman, who was 
greatly affected with it, and said to me, " Did I not 
say, sir, that when this man was converted he would 
preach to us all ? I tell you, sir, if this one man be 
made a true penitent, here will be no need of me ; 
he will make Christians of all in the island."" But 
having a little composed myself, I renewed my dis- 
course with Will Atkins. 

" But, Will," said I, " how comes the sense of this 
matter to touch you just now? 1 ' 

W. A. Sir, you have set me about a work that has 
struck a dart through my very soul. I have been 
talking about God and religion to my wife, in order, 
as you directed me, to make a Christian of her ; and 
she has preached such a sermon to me as I shall 
never forget while I live. 

R. C. No, no ; it is not your wife has preached to 
you ; but when you were moving religious arguments 
to her, conscience has flung them back upon you. 

W. A. Ay, sir, with such a force as is not to be 
resisted. 

R. C. Pray, Will, let us know what passed between 
you and your wife, for I know something of it already. 

W. A. Sir, it is impossible to give you a full 
account of it. I am too full to hold it, and yet 
have no tongue to express it ; but let her have said 
what she will, and though I cannot give you an ac- 
count of it, this I can tell you of it, that I resolve 
to amend and reform my life. 

R. C. But tell us some of it. How did you be- 
gin, Will ? for this has been an extraordinary case, 
that 's certain ; she has preached a sermon indeed, if 
she has wrought this upon you. 

[ 152 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



W. A. Why, I first told her the nature of our 
laws about marriage, and what the reasons were that 
men and women were obliged to enter into such 
compacts as it was neither in the power of one or 
other to break ; that otherwise, order and justice 
could not be maintained, and men would run from 
their wives and abandon their children, mix con- 
fusedly with one another, and neither families be 
kept entire, or inheritances be settled by legal 
descent. 

R. C. You talk like a civilian, Will. Could you 
make her understand what you meant by inheritance 
and families ? They know no such thing among 
the savages, but marry anyhow, without regard to 
relation, consanguinity, or family ; brother and sis- 
ter, nay, as I have been told, even the father and 
daughter, and the son and the mother. 

W. A. I believe, sir, you are misinformed ; and 
my wife assures me of the contrary, and that they 
abhor it. Perhaps for any farther relations they 
may not be so exact as we are, but she tells me 
they never touch one another in the near relations 
you speak of. 

R. C. Well, what did she say to what you told 
her ? 

W. A. She said she liked it very well, and it was 
much better than in her country. 

R. C. But did you tell her what marriage was ? 

W. A. Ay, ay ; there began all our dialogue. I 
asked her if she would be married to me our way ? 
She asked me what way that was ? I told marriage 
was appointed by God ; and here we had a strange 
talk together indeed, as ever man and wife had, I 
believe. 

[N. B. — This dialogue between W. Atkins and 
his wife, as I took it down in writing, just after he 
told it me, was as follows.] 

[153] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



Wife. Appointed by your God ! Why, have you 
a God in your country ? 

IV. A. Yes, my dear, God is in every country. 

Wife. No you God in my country ; my country 
have the great old Benamuckee God. 

W. A. Child, I am very unfit to show you who 
God is. God is in heaven, and made the heaven 
and the earth, the sea, and all that in them is. 

Wife. No makee de earth ; no you God make all 
earth, no make my country. 

[W. A. laughed a little at her expression of God 
not making her country.] 

Wife. No laugh ; why laugh me ? This no thing 
to laugh. 

[He was justly reproved by his wife, for she was 
more serious than he at first.] 

W. A. That 's true, indeed ; I will not laugh any 
more, my dear. 

Wife. Why you say, you God make all ? 

W. A. Yes, child, our God made the whole 
world, and you, and me, and all things ; for He is 
the only true God ; there is no God but Him ; He 
lives for ever in heaven. 

Wife. Why you no tell me long ago ? 

W. A. That's true, indeed; but I have been a 
wicked wretch, and have not only forgotten to ac- 
quaint thee with anything before, but have lived 
without God in the world myself. 

Wife. What, have you de great God in you 
country, you no know Him ? No say O to Him ? 
No do good thing for Him ? That no possible ! 

W. A. It is too true though, for all that ; we 
live as if there was no God in heaven, or that He 
had no power on earth. 

Wife. But why God let you do so ? Why He no 
makee you good live ? 

W. A. It is all our own fault. 

[ 154 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



Wife. But you say me He is great, much great, 
have much great power ; can makee kill when He 
will. Why He no makee kill when you no serve 
Him, no say O to Him, no be good mans ? 

W. A. That is true. He might strike me dead, 
and I ought to expect it ; for I have been a wicked 
wretch, that is true ; but God is merciful, and does 
not deal with us as we deserve. 

Wife. But then, do not you tell God tankee for 
that too ? 

W. A. No, indeed ; I have not thanked God for 
His mercy, any more than I have feared God for 
His power. 

Wife. Then you God no God ; me no think, be- 
lieve, He be such one, great, much power, strong ; 
no makee kill you, though you makee Him much 
angry. 

W A. What ! will my wicked life hinder you 
from believing in God ? What a dreadful creature am 
I ; and what a sad truth is it, that the horrid live.'-: 
of Christians hinders the conversion of heathens ! 

Wife. How me tink you have great much God 
[she points up to heaven] up there and yet no do 
well, no do good thing ? Can He tell ? Sure He 
no tell what you do? 

W. A. Yes, yes, He knows and sees all things ; 
He hears us speak, sees what we do, knows what we 
think, though we do not speak. 

Wife. What ! He no hear you swear, curse, 
speak the great damn ? 

W. A. Yes, yes, He hears it all. 

Wife. Where be then the muchee great power 
strong ? 

W. A. He is merciful, that's all we can say for 
it ; and this proves Him to be the true God. He 
is God, and not man ; and therefore we are not 
consumed. 

[155] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



[Here Will Atkins told us he was struck with 
horror to think how he could tell his wife so clearly 
that God sees, and hears, and knows the secret 
thoughts of the heart, and all that we do, and yet 
that he had dared to do all the vile things he had 
done.] 

Wife. Merciful ! what you call that ? 

W. A. He is our Father and Maker, and He 
pities and spares us. 

Wife. So then He never makee kill, never angry 
when you do wicked ; then He no good Himself, or 
no great able. 

W. A. Yes, yes, my dear ; He is infinitely good, 
and infinitely great, and able to punish too ; and 
sometimes, to show His justice and vengeance, He 
lets fly His anger to destroy sinners, and make ex- 
amples ; many are cut off in their sins. 

Wife. But no make kill you yet ; then He tell 
you, may be, that He no make you kill, so you 
make de bargain with Him, you do bad thing, He 
no be angry at you, when He be angry at other 
mans ? 

W. A. No, indeed, my sins are all presumptions 
upon His goodness ; and He would be infinitely just 
if He destroyed me, as He has done other men. 

Wife. Well, and yet no kill, no makee you dead ; 
what you say to Him for that? You no tell Him 
tankee for all that too? 

W. A. I am an unthankful, ungrateful dog, that's 
true. 

Wife. Why He no makee you much good better ? 
You say He makee you. 

W. A. He made me as He made all the world ; 
't is I have deformed myself, and abused His good- 
ness, and made myself an abominable wretch. 

Wife. I wish you makee God know me ; I no 
makee Him angry ; I no do bad wicked thing. 

[156] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



[Here Will Atkins said his heart sunk within him 
to hear a poor, untaught creature desire to be taught 
to know God, and he such a wicked wretch that he 
could not say one word to her about God but what 
the reproach of his own carriage would make most 
irrational to her to believe ; nay, that already she 
had told him that she could not believe in God, 
because he that was so wicked was not destroyed.] 

W. A. My dear, you mean you wish I could teach 
you to know God, not God to know you? for He knows 
you already, and every thought in your heart. 

Wife. Why then He know what I say to you 
now ? He know me wish to know Him ; how shall 
me know who makee me ? 

W. A. Poor creature, He must teach thee, I can- 
not teach thee ; I '11 pray to Him to teach thee to 
know Him, and to forgive me that I am unworthy 
to teach thee. 

[The poor fellow was in such an agony at her de- 
siring him to make her know God, and her wishing 
to know Him, that he said he fell down on his knees 
before her, and prayed to God to enlighten her 
mind with the saving knowledge of Jesus Christ, and 
to pardon his sins, and accept of his being the un- 
worthy instrument of instructing her in the prin- 
ciples of religion ; after which he sat down by her 
again, and their dialogue went on. N.B. — This 
was the time when we saw him kneel down and lift 
up his hands.] 

Wife. What you put down the knee for ? What 
you hold up the hand for ? What you say ? Who 
you speak to ? What is all that ? 

W. A. My dear, I bow my knees in token of my 
submission to Him that made me ; I said O to Him, 
as you call it, and as you say your old men do to 
their idol Benamuckee ; that is, I prayed to Him. 

Wife. What you say O to Him for ? 

[157] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



W. A. I prayed to Him to open your eyes and 
your understanding, that you may know Him, and 
be accepted by Him. 

Wife. Can He do that too ? 

W. A. Yes, He can ; He can do all things. 

1 1 "ife. But now He hear what you say ? 

W. A. Yes ; He has bid us pray to Him, and 
promised to hear us. 

Wife. Bid you pray ? When He bid you ? How 
He bid you ? What, you hear Him speak ? 

W. A. No, we do not hear Him speak ; but He 
has revealed Himself many ways to us. 

| 1 lore he was at a great loss to make her under- 
stand that God has revealed Himself to us by His 
\\ r 6rd ; and what His Word was; but at last he 
told it her thus.] 

W. A. God has spoken to some good men in 
former days, even from heaven, by plain words ; and 
God has inspired good men by His Spirit, and they 
have written all I lis laws down in a book. 

Wife. Me no understand that ; where is book? 

\V. A. Alas, my poor creature, I have not this 
book ! but I hope I shall, one time or other, get it 
for you, and help you to read it. 

[Here he embraced her with great affection ; but 
with inexpressible grief that he had not a Bible.] 

Wife. But how you makee me know that God 
teachee them to write that book? 

W. A. By the same rule that we know Him to 
be God. 

Wife. What rule ? what way you know Him ? 

W. A. Because He teaches and commands nothing 
but what is good, righteous, and holy, and tends to 
make us perfectly good, as well as perfectly happy ; 
and because He forbids, and commands us to avoid, 
all that is wicked, that is evil in itself, or evil in its 
consequences. 

[158] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



Wife. That me would understand, that me fain 
see ; if He teachee all good thing, forbid all wicked 
thing, He reward all good thing, punish all wicked 
thing, He make all thing, He give all thing ; He 
hear me when I say O to Him, as you go do just 
now ; He makee me good if I wish be good ; He 
spare me, no makee kill me when I no be good ; all 
this you say He do ; yet He be great God ; me take, 
think, believe him be great God ; me say O to Him 
too with you, my dear. 

Here the poor man could forbear no longer ; but 
raising her up, made her kneel by him ; and he 
prayed to God aloud to instruct her in the knowl- 
edge of Himself by His Spirit ; and that by some 
good providence, if possible, she might some time or 
other come to have a Bible, that she might read the 
Word of God, and be taught by it to know Him. 

This was the time that we saw him lift her up by 
the hand, and saw him kneel down by her, as above. 

They had several other discourses, it seems, after 
this, too long to set down here ; and particularly she 
made him promise, that since he confessed his own 
life had been a wicked abominable course of provo- 
cation against God, that he would reform it, and 
not make God angry any more, lest he should make 
him dead, as she called it, and then she should be 
left alone, and never be taught to know this God 
better ; and lest he should be miserable, as he had told 
her wicked men should be after death. 

This was a strange account, and very affecting to 
us both, but particularly to the young clergyman. 
He was indeed wonderfully surprised with it, but 
under the greatest affliction imaginable that he 
could not talk to her ; that he could not speak 
English to make her understand him, and as she 
spoke but very broken English, he could not under- 
stand her. However, he turned himself to me, and 

[159] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



told me that he believed there must be more to 
do with this woman than to marry her. I did not 
understand him at first, but at length he explained 
himself, viz., that she ought to be baptized. 

I agreed with him in that part readily, and was 
for going about it presently. " No, no ; hold, sir," 
said he ; " though I would have her be baptized by 
all means, yet I must observe that Will Atkins, her 
husband, has indeed brought her, in a wonderful 
manner, to be willing to embrace a religious life; 
and has given her just ideas of the being of a God, 
of His power, justice, mercy ; yet I desire to know 
of him if he has said anything to her of Jesus 
Christ, and of the salvation of sinners ; of the nature 
of faith in Him, and redemption by Him ; of the 
Holy Spirit, the resurrection, the last judgment, and 
a future state." 

I called Will Atkins again, and asked him ; but the 
poor fellow fell immediately into tears, and told us 
he had said something to her of all those things, but 
that he was himself so wicked a creature, and his 
own conscience so reproached him with his horrid 
ungodly life, that he trembled at the apprehensions 
that her knowledge of him should lessen the atten- 
tion she should give to those things, and make her 
rather contemn religion than receive it ; but he was 
assured, he said, that her mind was so disposed to 
receive due impressions of all those things, that if 
I would but discourse with her, she would make it 
appear to my satisfaction that my labour would not 
be lost upon her. 

Accordingly I called her in, and placing myself as 
interpreter between my religious priest and the 
woman, I entreated him to begin with her. But 
sure such a sermon was never preached by a Popish 
priest in these latter ages of the world ; and as I told 
him, I thought he had all the zeal, all the knowledge, 

[160] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



all the sincerity of a Christian, without the error of 
a Roman Catholic ; and that I took him to be such 
a clergyman as the Roman bishops were before the 
Church of Rome assumed spiritual sovereignty over 
the consciences of men. 

In a word, he brought the poor woman to embrace 
the knowledge of Christ, and of redemption by Him, 
not with wonder and astonishment only, as she did 
the first notions of a God, but with joy and faith, 
with an affection, and a surprising degree of under- 
standing, scarce to be imagined, much less to be 
expressed ; and at her own request she was baptized. 

When he was preparing to baptize her, I entreated 
him that he would perform that office with some 
caution, that the man might not perceive he was of 
the Roman Church, if possible, because of other ill 
consequences which might attend a difference among 
us in that very religion which we were instructing 
the other in. He told me that as he had no con- 
secrated chapel, no proper things for the office, I 
should see he would do it in a manner that I should 
not know by it that he was a Roman Catholic my- 
self if I had not known it before. And so he did ; 
for saying only some words over to himself in Latin, 
which I could not understand, he poured a whole 
dishful of water upon the woman's head, pronouncing 
in French very loud, " Mary," — which was the name 
her husband desired me to give her, for I was her 
godfather — "I baptize thee in the name of the 
Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost ; " 
so that none could know anything by it what religion 
he was of. He gave the benediction afterwards in 
Latin ; but either Will Atkins did not know but it 
was in French, or else did not take notice of it at 
that time. 

As soon as this was over, we married them ; and 
after the marriage was over, he turned himself to 
VOL. II. — 11 [ 161 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



Will Atkins, and in a very affectionate manner ex- 
horted him not only to persevere in that good dis- 
position he was in, but to support the convictions 
that were upon him by a resolution to reform his 
life ; told him it was in vain to say he repented if he 
did not forsake his crimes ; represented to him how 
God had honoured him with being the instrument 
of bringing his wife to the knowledge of the Christian 
religion, and that he should be careful he did not 
dishonour the grace of God ; and that if he did, he 
would see the heathen a better Christian than himself; 
the savage converted, and the instrument cast away. 

He said a great many good things to them both, 
and then recommending them, in a few words, to 
God's goodness, gave them the benediction again, I 
repeating everything to them in English, and thus 
ended the ceremony. I think it was the most 
pleasant, agreeable day to me that ever I passed in 
my whole life. 

But my clergyman had not done yet. His 
thoughts hung continually upon the conversion of 
the seven and thirty savages, and fain he would have 
stayed upon the island to have undertaken it ; but 
I convinced him, first, that his undertaking was im- 
practicable in itself ; and secondly, that, perhaps, I 
would put it into a way of being done, in his absence, 
to his satisfaction ; of which by-and-by. 

Having thus brought the affair of the island to a 
narrow compass, I was preparing to go on board the 
ship when the young man, whom I had taken out of 
the famished ship's company, came to me, and told 
me he understood I had a clergyman with me, and 
that I caused the Englishmen to be married to the 
savages whom they called wives ; that he had a 
match too which he desired might be finished before 
I went, between two Christians, which he hoped 
would not be disagreeable to me. 

[ 162 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



I knew this must be the young woman who was 
his mother's servant, for there was no other Chris- 
tian woman on the island. So I began to persuade 
him not to do anything of that kind rashly, or be- 
cause he found himself in this solitary circumstance. 
I represented to him that he had some considerable 
substance in the world, and good friends, as I under- 
stood by himself, and by his maid also ; that his 
maid was not only poor, and a servant, but was un- 
equal to him, she being six or seven and twenty 
years old, and he not above seventeen or eighteen ; 
that he might very probably, with my assistance, 
make a remove from this wilderness, and come into 
his own country again, and that then it would be a 
thousand to one but he would repent his choice, and 
the dislike of that circumstance might be disadvan- 
tageous to both. I was going to say more, but he 
interrupted me, smiling, and told me, with a great 
deal of modesty, that I mistook in my guesses ; that 
he had nothing of that kind in his thoughts, his 
present circumstance being melancholy and disconso- 
late enough ; and he was very glad to hear that I 
had thoughts of putting them in a way to see their 
country again ; and nothing should have put him 
upon staying there but that the voyage I was going 
was so exceeding long and hazardous, and would 
carry him quite out of the reach of all his friends ; 
that he had nothing to desire of me but that I 
would settle him in some little property in the is- 
land where he was, give him a servant or two, and 
some few necessaries, and he would settle himself 
here like a planter, waiting the good time when, if 
ever I returned to England, I would redeem him, 
and hoped I would not be unmindful of him when I 
came into England ; that he would give me some 
letters to his friends in London, to let them know 
how good I had been to him, and in what part of 

[163] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



the world, and what circumstance I had left him in ; 
that he promised me that whenever I redeemed him, 
the plantation, and all the improvement he had 
made upon it, let the value be what it would, should 
be wholly mine. 

His discourse was very prettily delivered consider- 
ing his youth, and was the more agreeable to me be- 
cause he told me positively the match was not for 
himself. I gave him all possible assurances that, if 
I lived to come safe to England, I would deliver his 
letters, .and do his business effectually, and that he 
might depend I would never forget the circumstance 
I had left him in. But still I was impatient to 
know who were the persons to be married ; upon 
which he told me it was my Jack-of-all-trades and 
his maid Susan. 

I was most agreeably surprised when he named 
the match, for indeed I thought it very suitable. 
The character of that man I have given already ; 
and as for the maid, she was a very honest, modest, 
sober, and religious young woman ; had a very good 
share of sense ; was agreeable enough in her person ; 
spoke very handsomely, and to the purpose ; always 
with decency and good manners, and not backward 
to speak when anything required it, or impertinently 
forward to speak when it was not her business ; very 
handy and housewifely in anything that was before 
her ; an excellent manager, and fit indeed to have 
been governess to the whole island. She knew very 
well how to behave to all kind of folks she had 
about her, and to better if she had found any 
there. 

The match being proposed in this manner, we 
married them the same day ; and as I was father at 
the altar, as I may say, and gave her away, so I gave 
her a portion, for I appointed her and her husband 
a handsome large space of ground for their planta- 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



tion ; and indeed this match, and the proposal the 
young gentleman made, to give him a small property 
in the island, put me upon parcelling it out amongst 
them, that they might not quarrel afterwards about 
their situation. 

This sharing out the land to them I left to Will 
Atkins, who indeed was now grown a most sober, 
grave, managing fellow, perfectly reformed, exceeding 
pious and religious, and as far as I may be allowed 
to speak positively in such a case, I verily believe 
was a true sincere penitent. 

He divided things so justly, and so much to every 
one's satisfaction, that they only desired one general 
writing under my hand for the whole, which I caused 
to be drawn up and signed and sealed to them, setting 
out the bounds and situation of every man's planta- 
tion, and testifying that I gave them thereby, sever- 
ally, a right to the whole possession and inheritance 
of the respective plantations or farms, with their 
improvements, to them and their heirs ; reserving 
all the rest of the island as my own property, and a 
certain rent for every particular plantation after 
eleven years, as I or any one from me, or in my 
name, came to demand it, producing an attested 
copy of the same writing. 

As to the government and laws among them, I 
told them I was not capable of giving them better 
rules than they were able to give themselves ; only 
made them promise me to live in love and good 
neighbourhood with one another ; and so I prepared 
to leave them. 

One thing I must not omit, and this is, that being 
now settled in a kind of commonwealth among them- 
selves, and having much business in hand, it was but 
odd to have seven and thirty Indians live in a 
nook of the island, independent, and indeed unem- 
ployed ; for excepting the providing themselves food, 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



which they had difficulty enough in too, sometimes, 
they had no manner of business or property to 
manage. I proposed therefore to the governor 
Spaniard that he should go to them with Friday's 
father, and propose to them to remove, and either 
plant for themselves, or take them into their several 
families as servants, to be maintained for their labour, 
but without being absolute slaves ; for I would not 
admit them to make them slaves by force by any 
means, because they had their liberty given them by 
capitulation, and as it were, articles of surrender, 
which they ought not to break. 

They most willingly embraced the proposal, and 
came all very cheerfully along with him ; so we 
allotted them land and plantations, which three or 
four accepted of, but all the rest chose to be employed 
as servants in the several families we had settled ; 
and thus my colony was in a manner settled as fol- 
lows : — The Spaniards possessed my original habi- 
tation, which was the capital city, and extended their 
plantations all along the side of the brook, which 
made the creek that I have so often described, as far 
as my bower ; and as they increased their culture, it 
went always eastward. The English lived in the 
north-east part, where Will Atkins and his com- 
rades began, and came on southward and south- 
west, towards the back part of the Spaniards ; and 
every plantation had a great addition of land to take 
in if they found occasion, so that they need not 
jostle one another for want of room. 

All the east end of the island was left uninhabited, 
that if any of the savages should come on shore there, 
only for their usual customary barbarities, they might 
come and go; if they disturbed nobody, nobody would 
disturb them ; and no doubt but they were often 
ashore and went away again, for I never heard that 
the planters were attacked or disturbed any more. 

[ 166 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



It now came into my thoughts that I had hinted 
to my friend the clergyman that the work of con- 
verting the savages might perhaps be set on foot in 
his absence to his satisfaction ; and I told him that 
now I thought it was put in a fair way, for the 
savages being thus divided among the Christians, if 
they would but every one of them do their part 
with those which came under their hands, I hoped 
it might have a very good effect. 

He agreed presently in that. " If," said he, " they 
will do their part ; but how," says he, 4< shall we 
obtain that of them ? " I told him we would call 
them together, and leave it in charge with them, 
or go to them one by one, which he thought best. 
So we divided it — he to speak to the Spaniards, 
who were all Papists, and I to the English, who were 
all Protestants ; and we recommended it earnestly 
to them, and made them promise that they never 
would make any distinction of Papist or Protestant 
in their exhorting the savages to turn Christians, 
but teach them the general knowledge of the true 
God, and of their Saviour Jesus Christ ; and they 
likewise promised us that they would never have 
any differences or disputes one with another about 
religion. 

When I came to Will Atkins's house — I may 
call it so, for such a house, or such a piece of basket- 
work, I believe w r as not standing in the world again ; 
I say when I came there, I found the young woman 
I have mentioned above and Will Atkins's wife 
were become intimates ; and this prudent, religious 
young woman had perfected the work Will Atkins 
had begun ; and though it was not above four days 
after what I have related, yet the new-baptized 
savage woman was made such a Christian as I have 
seldom heard of any like her in all my observation 
or conversation in the world. 

[ 167 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



It came next into my mind in the morning, be- 
fore I went to them, that amongst all the needful 
things I had to leave with them, I had not left them 
a Bible ; in which I showed myself less considering 
for them than my good friend the widow was for 
me, when she sent me the cargo of a hundred pounds 
from Lisbon, where she packed up three Bibles and 
a prayer-book. However, the good woman's charity 
had a greater extent than ever she imagined, for 
they were reserved for the comfort and instruction 
of those that made much better use of them than 
I had done. 

I took one of the Bibles in my pocket ; and when 
I came to Will Atkins's tent, or house, and found 
the young woman and Atkins's baptized wife had 
been discoursing of religion together — for Will 
Atkins told it me with a great deal of joy — I 
asked if they were together now, and he said yes. 
So I went into the house, and he with me, and we 
found them together, very earnest in discourse. " O 
sir," says Will Atkins, " when God has sinners to 
reconcile to Himself, and aliens to bring home, He 
never wants a messenger ; my wife has got a new 
instructor — I knew I was unworthy, as I was in- 
capable of that work — that young woman has been 
sent hither from heaven — she is enough to convert 
a whole island of savages." The young woman 
blushed, and rose up to go away, but I desired her to 
sit still. I told her she had a good work upon her 
hands, and I hoped God would bless her in it. 

We talked a little, and I did not perceive they 
had any book among them, though I did not ask ; 
but I put my hand in my pocket and pulled out my 
Bible. " Here," says I to Atkins, " I have brought 
you an assistant that perhaps you had not before." 
The man was so confounded, that he was not able to 
speak for some time; but recovering himself, he 

[168] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



takes it with both his hands, and turning to his 
wife, " Here, my dear," says he, " did not I tell you 
our God, though He lives above, could hear what 
we said ? Here 's the book I prayed for when you 
and I kneeled down under the bush ; now God has 
heard us, and sent it." When he had said so, the 
man fell into such transports of a passionate joy, 
that between the joy of having it, and giving God 
thanks for it, the tears ran down his face like a 
child that was crying. 

The woman was surprised, and was like to have 
run into a mistake that none of us were aware of ; 
for she firmly believed God had sent the book upon 
her husband's petition. It is true that providentially 
it was so, and might be taken so in a consequent 
sense ; but I believe it would have been no difficult 
matter at that time to have persuaded the poor 
woman to have believed that an express messenger 
came from heaven on purpose to bring that individ- 
ual book. But it was too serious a matter to suffer 
any delusion to take place ; so I turned to the young 
woman, and told her we did not desire to impose 
upon the new convert in her first and more ignorant 
understanding of things, and begged her to explain 
to her that God may be very properly said to answer 
our petitions when in the course of His providence 
such things are in a particular manner brought to 
pass as we petitioned for ; but we do not expect re- 
turns from heaven in a miraculous and particular 
manner ; and that it is our mercy that it is not so. 

This the young woman did afterwards effectually ; 
so that there was, I assure you, no priestcraft used 
here ; and I should have thought it one of the most 
unjustifiable frauds in the world to have had it so. 
But the surprise of joy upon Will Atkins is really 
not to be expressed ; and there we may be sure there 
was no delusion. Sure no man was ever more thank- 

[169] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 

ful in the world for anything of its kind than he 
was for his Bible ; nor, I believe, never any man was 
glad of a Bible from a better principle. And though 
he had been a most profligate creature, desperate, 
headstrong, outrageous, furious, and wicked to a 
great degree, yet this man is a standing rule to us 
all for the well instructing children, viz., that parents 
should never give over to teach and instruct, or ever 
despair of the success of their endeavours, let the 
children be ever so obstinate, refractory, or to ap- 
pearance insensible of instruction ; for if ever God 
in His providence touches the consciences of such, 
the force of their education returns upon them, and 
the early instruction of parents is not lost, though 
it may have been many years laid asleep, but some 
time or other they may find the benefit of it. 

Thus it was with this poor man ; however ignorant 
he was, or divested of religion and Christian knowl- 
edge, he found he had some to do with now more 
ignorant than himself, and that the least part of the 
instruction of his good father that could now come 
to his mind was of use to him. 

Among the rest it occurred to him, he said, how 
his father used to insist much upon the inexpressible 
value of the Bible, the privilege and blessing of it to 
nations, families, and persons ; but he never enter- 
tained the least notion of the worth of it till now, 
when being to talk to heathens, savages, and bar- 
barians, he wanted the help of the written oracle for 
his assistance. 

The young woman was very glad of it also for the 
present occasion, though she had one, and so had the 
youth, on board our ship among their goods, which 
were not yet brought on shore. And now, having 
said so many things of this young woman, I cannot 
omit telling one story more of her and myself, which 
has something in it very informing and remarkable. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



I have related to what extremity the poor young 
woman was reduced ; how her mistress was starved 
to death, and did die on board that unhappy ship 
we met at sea ; and how the whole ship's company 
being reduced to the last extremity, the gentlewoman 
and her son, and this maid, were first hardly used as 
to provisions, and at last totally neglected and 
starved ; that is to say, brought to the last extremity 
of hunger. 

One day being discoursing with her upon the ex- 
tremities they suffered, I asked her if she could de- 
scribe by what she had felt what it was to starve, and 
how it appeared ? She told me she believed she 
could, and she told her tale very distinctly thus : — 

" First, sir,"" said she, " we had for some days fared 
exceeding hard, and suffered very great hunger, but 
now at last we were wholly without food of any kind 
except sugar, and a little wine, and a little water. 
The first day after I had received no food at all, I 
found myself towards evening first empty and sickish 
at my stomach, and nearer night mightily inclined 
to yawning, and sleepy. I laid down on a couch in 
the great cabin to sleep, and slept about three hours, 
and awaked a little refreshed, having taken a glass 
of wine when I lay down. After being about three 
hours awake, it being about five o'clock in the morn- 
ing, I found myself empty, and my stomach sickish, 
and laid down again, but could not sleep at all, being 
very faint and ill ; and thus I continued all the 
second day, with a strange variety — first hungry, 
then sick again, with Teachings to vomit. The 
second night, being obliged to go to bed again with- 
out any food more than a draught of fair water, and 
being asleep, I dreamed I was at Barbadoes, and that 
the market was mightily stocked with provisions, 
that I bought some for my mistress, and went and 
dined very heartily. 

[ 171 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



" I thought my stomach was as full after this as 
any would have been after or at a good dinner ; but 
when I waked, I was exceedingly sunk in my spirits 
to find myself in the extremity of famine. The last 
glass of wine we had I drank, and put sugar in it, 
because of its having some spirit to supply nourish- 
ment ; but there being no substance in the stomach 
for the digesting office to work upon, I found the 
only effect of the wine was to raise disagreeable 
fomes from the stomach into the head ; and I lay, 
as they told me, stupid and senseless, as one drunk, 
for some time. 

"The third day, in the morning, after a night of 
si range and confused inconsistent dreams, and rather 
dozing than sleeping, I waked, ravenous and furious 
with hunger ; and I question, had not my under- 
st anding returned and conquered it, I say, I question 
whether, if I had been a mother, and had had a little 
child with me, its life would have been safe or not. 
This lasted about three hours, during which time I 
was tw ice raging mad as any creature in Bedlam, as 
my young master told me, and as he can now inform 
you. 

" In one of these fits of lunacy or distraction, 
whether by the motion of the ship or some slip of 
my foot I know not, I fell down, and struck my face 
against the corner of a pallet bed, in which my 
mistress lay, and with the blow the blood gushed 
out of my nose, and the cabin-boy bringing me a 
little basin, I sat down and bled into it a great deal, 
and as the blood ran from me I came to myself, and 
the violence of the flame or the fever I was in abated, 
and so did the ravenous part of the hunger. 

" Then I grew sick and reached to vomit, but 
could not, for I had nothing in my stomach to bring 
up. After I had bled some time I swooned, and 
they all believed I was dead ; but I came to myself 

[ 172] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



soon after, and then had a most dreadful pain in my 
stomach, not to be described, not like the colic, but 
a gnawing, eager pain for food ; and towards night 
it went off with a kind of earnest wishing or longing 
for food, something like, as I suppose, the longing of 
a woman with child. I took another draught of 
water with sugar in it, but my stomach loathed the 
sugar, and brought it all up again ; then I took a 
draught of water without sugar, and that stayed 
with me, and I laid me down upon the bed, praying 
most heartily that it would please God to take me 
away ; and composing my mind in hopes of it, I 
slumbered awhile ; and then waking, thought myself 
dying, being light with vapours from an empty 
stomach. I recommended my soul then to God, and 
earnestly wished that somebody would throw me into 
the sea. 

" All this while my mistress lay by me just, as I 
thought, expiring, but bore it with much more pa- 
tience than I, and gave the last bit of bread she had 
left to her child, my young master, who would not 
have taken it, but she obliged him to eat it ; and I 
believe it saved his life. 

" Towards the morning I slept again, and first 
when I awaked I fell into a violent passion of crying, 
and after that had a second fit of violent hunger. I 
got up ravenous, and in a most dreadful condition. 
Had my mistress been dead, as much as I loved her 
I am certain I should have eaten a piece of her flesh 
with as much relish, and as unconcerned, as ever I 
did the flesh of any creature appointed for food ; 
and once or twice I was going to bite my own arm. 
At last I saw the basin in which was the blood I 
had bled at my nose the day before. I ran to it, 
and swallowed it with such haste, and such a greedy 
appetite, as if I had wondered nobody had taken it 
before, and afraid it would be taken from me now. 

[ 173] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



" Though after it was down the thoughts of it 
filled me with horror, yet it checked the fit of hun- 
ger, and I drank a draught of fair water, and was 
composed and refreshed for some hours after it. 
This was the fourth day ; and thus I held it till 
towards night, when, within the compass of three 
hours, I had all these several circumstances over 
again, one after another, viz., sick, sleepy, eagerly 
hungry, pain in the stomach, then ravenous again, 
then sick again, then lunatic, then crying, then rav- 
enous again, and so every quarter of an hour ; and 
my strength wasted exceedingly. At night I laid 
me down, having no comfort but in the hope that I 
should die before morning. 

" All this night I had no sleep ; but the hunger 
was now turned into a disease, and I had a terrible 
colic and griping by wind instead of food having 
found its way into the bowels ; and in this condition 
I lay till morning, when I was surprised a little with 
the cries and lamentations of my young master, who 
called out to me that his mother was dead. I lifted 
myself up a little, for I had not strength to rise, but 
found she was not dead, though she was able to give 
very little signs of life. 

" I had then such convulsions in my stomach for 
want of some sustenance, that I cannot describe, 
with such frequent throes and pangs of appetite that 
nothing but the tortures of death can imitate ; and 
in this condition I was when I heard the seamen 
above cry out ' A sail ! a sail ! ' and halloo and jump 
about as if they were distracted. 

" I was not able to get off from the bed, and my 
mistress much less, and my young master was so sick 
that I thought he had been expiring ; so we could 
not open the cabin-door, or get any account what it 
was that occasioned such a combustion ; nor had we 
had any conversation with the ship's company for 

[174] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



two days, they having told us that they had not a 
mouthful of anything to eat in the ship ; and they 
told us afterwards they thought we had been dead. 

" It was this dreadful condition we were in when 
you were sent to save our lives ; and how you found 
us, sir, you know as well as I, and better too. 1 ' 

This was her own relation, and is such a distinct 
account of starving to death as I confess I never met 
with, and was exceeding entertaining to me. I am 
the rather apt to believe it to be a true account, 
because the youth gave me an account of a good 
part of it ; though I must own not so distinct and 
so feelingly as his maid, and the rather because it 
seems his mother fed him at the price of her own 
life ; but the poor maid, though her constitution 
being stronger than that of her mistress, who was in 
years, and a weakly woman too, she might struggle 
harder with it ; I say, the poor maid might be 
supposed to feel the extremity something sooner 
than her mistress, who might be allowed to keep the 
last bit something longer than she parted with any 
to relieve the maid. No question, as the case is 
here related, if our ship, or some other, had not so 
providentially met them, a few days more would 
have ended all their lives, unless they had prevented 
it by eating one another ; and even that, as their 
case stood, would have served them but a little 
while, they being five hundred leagues from any 
land, or any possibility of relief, other than in the 
miraculous manner it happened. But this is by 
the way ; I return to my disposition of things among 
the people. 

And first, it is to be observed here, that for many 
reasons I did not think fit to let them know any- 
thing of the sloop I had framed, and which I thought 
of setting up among them ; for I found, at least at 

[175] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 

my first coming, such seeds of divisions among them, 
that I saw it plainly had I set up the sloop, and 
left it among them, they would, upon every light 
disgust, have separated, and gone away from one 
another ; or perhaps have turned pirates, and so 
made the island a den of thieves, instead of a plan- 
tation of sober and religious people, so as I intended 
it ; nor did I leave the two pieces of brass cannon 
that I had on board, or the two quarter-deck guns 
that my nephew took extraordinarily, for the same 
reason. I thought it was enough to qualify them 
for a defensive war against any that should invade 
them, but not to set them up for an offensive war, 
or to encourage them to go abroad to attack others, 
which, in the end, would only bring ruin and de- 
struction upon themselves and all their undertaking. 
I reserved the sloop, therefore, and the guns for their 
service another way, as I shall observe in its place. 

I have now done with the island. I left them all 
in good circumstances, and in a flourishing condition, 
and went on board my ship again the [fifth day] of 
[May], having been five and twenty days among 
them ; and as they were all resolved to stay upon 
the island till I came to remove them, I promised 
to send some farther relief from the Brazils, if I 
could possibly find an opportunity ; and particularly, 
I promised to send them some cattle, such as sheep, 
hogs, and cows ; for as to the two cows and calves 
which I brought from England, we had been obliged, 
by the length of our voyage, to kill them at sea 
for want of hay to feed them. 

The next day, giving them a salute of five guns at 
parting, we set sail, and arrived at the Bay of All 
Saints, in the Brazils, in about twenty-two days, 
meeting nothing remarkable in our passage but this, 
that about three days after we sailed, being be- 

[176] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



calmed, and the current setting strong to the E.N.E., 
running, as it were, into a bay or gulf on the land 
side, we were driven something out of our course ; 
and once or twice our men cried land to the east- 
ward ; but whether it was the continent, or islands, 
we could not tell by any means. 

But the third day, towards evening, the sea smooth 
and the weather calm, we saw the sea, as it were 
covered towards the land with something very black ; 
not being able to discover what it was till, after some 
time, our chief mate going up the main shrouds a 
little way, and looking at them with a perspective, 
cried out it was an army. I could not imagine what 
he meant by an army, and spoke a little hastily, 
calling the fellow a fool, or some such word. " Nay, 
sir," says he, " don't be angry, for 't is an army, and 
a fleet too ; for I believe there are a thousand canoes, 
and you may see them paddle along, and they are 
coming towards us too, apace." 

I was a little surprised then, indeed, and so was 
my nephew, the captain ; for he had heard such 
terrible stories of them in the island, and having 
never been in those seas before, that he could not 
tell what to think of it, but said two or three times 
we should all be devoured. I must confess, consider- 
ing we were becalmed, and the current set strong 
towards the shore, I liked it the worse. However, 
I bade him not be afraid, but bring the ship to an 
anchor as soon as we came so near to know that we 
must engage them. 

The weather continued calm, and they came on 
apace towards us ; so I gave order to come to an 
anchor, and furl all our sails. As for the savages, I 
told them they had nothing to fear but fire ; and 
therefore they should get their boats out, and fasten 
them, one close by the head, and the other by the 
stern, and man them both well, and wait the issue 
VOL. II. — 12 [ 1 77 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



in that posture. This I did, that the men in the 
boats might be ready, with skeets and buckets, to 
put out any fire these savages might endeavour to 
fix to the outside of the ship. In this posture we 
lay by for them, and in a little while they came up 
with us ; but never was such a horrid sight seen by 
Christians. My mate was much mistaken in his 
calculation of their number, I mean of a thousand 
canoes, the most we could make of them when they 
came up being about a hundred and six and twenty ; 
and a great many of them too ; for some of them 
had sixteen or seventeen men in them, and some 
more, and the least six or seven. 

When they came nearer to us they seemed to be 
struck with wonder and astonishment, as at a sight 
which they had, doubtless, never seen before; nor 
could they at first, as we afterwards understood, 
know what to make of us. They came boldly up, 
however, very near to us, and seemed to go about 
to row round us ; but we called to our men in the 
boats not to let them come too near them. 

This very order brought us to an engagement with 
them, without our designing it ; for five or six of 
their large canoes came so near our longboat, that 
our men beckoned with their hands to them to keep 
back, which they understood very well, and went 
back ; but at their retreat about fifty arrows came 
on board us from those boats, and one of our men 
in the longboat was very much wounded. 

However, I called to them not to fire by any 
means ; but we handed down some deal boards into 
the boat, and the carpenters presently set up a kind 
of fence, like waist boards, to cover them from the 
arrows of the savages, if they should shoot again. 

About half-an-hour afterwards they came all up 
in a body astern of us, and pretty near us, so near 
that wc could easily discern what they were, though 

[178] 



KOHINSON CRUSOE 



we could not tell their design ; and I easily found 
they were some of mv old friends, the same sort of 
savages that I had been used to engage with ; and in 
a little time more they rowed a little farther out to 
sea, till they came directly broadside with us, and 
then rowed down straight upon us, till they came so 
near, that they could hear us speak. Upon this I 
ordered all my men to keep close, less they should 
shoot any more arrows, and made all our guns 
ready ; but being so near as to be within hearing, I 
made Friday go out upon the deck and call out aloud 
to them in his language to know what they meant, 
which accordingly he did. Whether they understood 
him or not, that I knew not ; but as soon as he had 
called to them, six of them, who were in the foremost 
or nighest boat to us, turned their canoes from us, 
and stooping down, showed us their naked back- 
sides ; just as if, in English, saving your presence, they 

had bid us kiss . Whether this was a defiance 

or challenge, we know not ; or whether it was done 
in mere contempt, or as a signal to the rest ; but 
immediately Friday cried out they were going to 
shoot; and unhappily for him, poor fellow, they let 
fly about three hundred of their arrows, and to my 
inexpressible grief killed poor Friday, no other man 
being in their sight. The poor fellow was shot with 
no less than three arrows, and about three more 
fell very near him ; such unlucky marksmen they 
were. 

I was so enraged with the loss of my old servant, 
the companion of all my sorrows and solitudes, that 
I immediately ordered five guns to be loaded with 
small shot, and four with great, and gave them such 
a broadside as they had never heard in their lives 
before, to be sure. They were not above half a 
cable length off when we fired ; and our gunners 
took their aim so well, that three or four of their 

[179] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



canoes were overset, as we had reason to believe, by 
one shot only. 

The ill manners of turning up their bare backsides 
to us, gave us no great offence ; neither did I know 
for certain whether that, which would pass for the 
greatest contempt among us, might be understood 
so by them or not ; therefore in return I had only 
resolved to have fired four or five guns at them witn 
powder only, which I knew would fright them suffi- 
ciently ; but when they shot at us directly with all 
the fury they were capable of, and especially as they 
had killed my poor Friday, whom I so entirely loved 
and valued, and who, indeed, so well deserved it, I 
not only had been justified before God and man, 
but would have been very glad, if I could, to have 
overset every canoe there, and drowned every one of 
them. 

I can neither tell how many we killed, or how 
many we wounded, at this broadside ; but sure such 
a fright and hurry never was seen among such a 
multitude. There were thirteen or fourteen of their 
canoes split and overset, in all, and the men all set 
a-swimming ; the rest, frighted out of their wits, 
scoured away as fast as they could, taking but little 
care to save those whose boats were split or spoiled 
with our shot. So I suppose that they were many 
of them lost ; and our men took one poor fellow 
swimming for his life above an hour after they were 
all gone. 

Our small shot from our cannon must needs kill 
and wound a great many ; but, in short, we never 
knew anything how it went with them ; for they fled 
so fast, that in three hours, or thereabouts, we could 
not see above three or four straggling canoes ; nor 
did we ever see the rest any more ; for a breeze of 
wind springing up the same evening, we weighed and 
set sail for the Brazils.

ROBINSON CRUSOE 

We had a prisoner indeed, but the creature was so 
sullen, that he would neither eat or speak ; and we 
all fancied he would starve himself to death. But I 
took a way to cure him ; for I made them take him 
and turn him into the longboat, and made him be- 
lieve they would toss him into the sea again, and so 
leave him where they found him if he would not 
speak. Nor would that do ; but they really did 
throw him into the sea, and came away from him ; 
and then he followed them, for he swam like a cork, 
and called to them in his tongue, though they knew 
not one word of what he said. However, at last 
they took him in again, and then he began to be 
more tractable ; nor did I ever design they should 
drown him. 

We were now under sail again ; but I was the 
most disconsolate creature alive, for want of my man 
Friday, and would have been very glad to have gone 
back to the island to have taken one of the rest 
from thence for my occasion, but it could not be ; so 
we went on. We had one prisoner, as I have said ; 
and 't was a long while before we could make him 
understand anything ; but in time our men taught 
him some English, and he began to be a little tract- 
able. Afterwards we inquired what country he 
came from, but could make nothing of what he said ; 
for his speech was so odd, all gutturals, and spoke 
in the throat in such a hollow odd manner, that we 
could never form a word from him ; and we were all 
of opinion that they might speak that language as 
well if they were gagged as otherwise ; nor could we 
perceive that they had any occasion either for teeth, 
tongue, lips, or palate, but formed their words just 
as a hunting-horn forms a tune with an open throat. 
He told us, however, some time after, when we 
taught him to speak a little English, that they were 
going, with their kings, to fight a great battle. 

[181] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



When he said kings, we asked him how many kings. 
He said they were five nation (we could not make 
him understand the plural s) 9 and that they all joined 
to go against two nation. We asked him what made 
them come up to us ? He said, "To makee to great 
wonder look." Where it is to be observed, that all 
those natives, as also those of Africa, when they 
learn English, they always add two e*a at the end of 
the words where we use one, and make the accent 
upon them, as mak& 9 tnkee, and the like; and we 
could not bre ak them off it ; nay, I could hardly 
make Friday leave it off, though at last he did. 

And now I name the poor fellow once more, I 
must take my last leave of him, poor honest Friday ! 
We buried him with all the decency and solemnity 
possible, by putting him into a coffin, and throwing 
him into the sea; and I caused them to fire eleven 
guns for him ; and so ended the life of the most 
grateful, faithful, honest, and most affectionate ser- 
vant that ever man had. 

We went now away with a fair wind for Brazil, 
and in about twelve days'* time we made land in the 
latitude of five degrees south of the line, being the 
north-easternmost land of all that part of America. 
We kept on S. by E. in sight of the shore four days, 
when we made Cape St. Augustine, and in three 
davs came to an anchor off of the Hay of All Saints, 
the old place of my deliverance, from whence came 
both my good and evil fate. 

Never ship came to this part that had less busi- 
ness than I had, and yet it was with great difficulty 
that we were admitted to hold the least correspond- 
ence on shore. Not my planter himself, who was 
alive, and made a great figure among them, not my 
two merchant trustees, not the fame of my wonderful 
preservation in that island, could obtain me that 
favour; but my partner remembering that I had 

[ 182 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



given five hundred moidores to the prior of the 
monastery of the Augustines, and two hundred and 
seventy-two to the poor, went to the monastery, and 
obliged the prior that then was to go to the governor 
and get leave for me personally, with the captain 
and one more, besides eight seamen, to come on 
shore, and no more ; and this upon condition abso- 
lutely capitulated for, that we should not offer to 
land any goods out of the ship, or to carry any 
person away without licence. 

They were so strict with us as to landing any 
goods, that it was with extreme difficulty that I got 
on shore three bales of English goods, such as fine 
broadcloths, stuffs, and some linen, which I had 
brought for a present to my partner. 

He was a very generous, broad-hearted man, 
though, like me, he came from little at first ; and 
though he knew not that I had the least design of 
giving him anything, he sent me on board a present 
of fresh provisions, wine, and sweetmeats, worth 
above thirty moidores, including some tobacco, and 
three or four fine medals in gold. But I was even 
with him in my present, which, as I have said, con- 
sisted of fine broadcloth, English stuffs, lace, and fine 
hollands. Also I delivered him about the value of 
i?100 sterling, in the same goods, for other uses ; 
and I obliged him to set up the sloop which I had 
brought with me from England, as I have said, for 
the use of my colony, in order to send the refresh- 
ments I intended to my plantation. 

Accordingly he got hands, and finished the sloop 
in a very few days, for she was ready framed ; and I 
gave the master of her such instructions as he could 
not miss the place ; nor did he miss them, as I had 
an account from my partner afterwards. I got him 
soon loaded with the small cargo I sent them ; and 
one of our seamen, that had been on shore with me 

[ 183 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



there, offered to go with the sloop, and settle there, 
upon my letter to the governor Spaniard, to allot 
him a sufficient quantity of land for a plantation ; 
and giving him some clothes, and tools for his plant- 
ing work, which he said he understood, having been 
an old planter at Maryland, and a buccaneer into 
the bargain. 

I encouraged the fellow by granting all he desired ; 
and as an addition, I gave him the savage which we 
had taken prisoner of war to be his slave, and ordered 
the governor Spaniard to give him his share of every- 
thing he wanted, with the rest. 

When we came to fit this man out, my old partner 
told me there was a certain very honest fellow, a 
Brazil planter of his acquaintance, who had fallen 
into the displeasure of the Church. " I know not 
what the matter is with him," says he, " but, on my 
conscience, I think he is a heretic in his heart, and 
he has been obliged to conceal himself for fear of the 
Inquisition ; " that he would be very glad of such an 
opportunity to make his escape with his wife and two 
daughters ; and if I would let them go to the island, 
and allot them a plantation, he would give them a 
small stock to begin with ; for the officers of the 
Inquisition had seized all his effects and estate, and 
he had nothing left but a little household stuff, and 
two slaves. " And," adds he, " though I hate his 
principles, yet I would not have him fall into their 
hands, for he would assuredly be burnt alive if he 
does." 

I granted this presently, and joined my English- 
man with them ; and we concealed the man and his 
wife and daughters on board our ship, till the sloop 
put out to go to sea ; and then, having put all their 
goods on board the sloop some time before, we put 
them on board the sloop after he was got out of 
the bay. 

[184] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



Our seaman was mightily pleased with this new 
partner ; and their stock, indeed, was much alike, rich 
in tools, in preparations, and a farm ; but nothing to 
begin with, but as above. However, they carried 
over with them, which was worth all the rest, some 
materials for planting sugar-canes, with some plants 
of canes ; which he, I mean the Portugal man, under- 
stood very well. 

Among the rest of the supplies sent my tenants 
in the island, I sent them by their sloop three milch 
cows and five calves, about twenty-two hogs, among 
them three sows big with pig, two mares, and a 
stone-horse. 

For my Spaniards, according to my promise, I 
engaged three Portugal women to go ; and recom- 
mended it to them to marry them, and use them 
kindly. I could have procured more women, but I 
remembered that the poor persecuted man had two 
daughters, and there was but five of the Spaniards 
that wanted ; the rest had wives of their own, 
though in another country. 

All this cargo arrived safe, and, as you may easily 
suppose, very welcome to my old inhabitants, who 
were now, with this addition, between sixty and 
seventy people, besides little children, of which there 
was a great many. I found letters at London from 
them all, by the way of Lisbon, when I came back 
to England, of which I shall also take some notice 
immediately. 

I have now done with my island, and all manner 
of discourse about it ; and whoever reads the rest 
of my memorandums, would do well to turn his 
thoughts entirely from it, and expect to read of the 
follies of an old man, not warned by his own harms, 
much less by those of other men, to beware of the 
like ; not cooled by almost forty years'* misery and 
disappointments, not satisfied with prosperity be- 

[185] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



yond expectation, not made cautious by affliction 
and distress beyond imitation. 

I had no more business to go to the East Indies 
than a man at full liberty, and having committed no 
crime, has to go to the turnkey at Newgate and de- 
sire him to lock him up among the prisoners there 
and starve him. Had I taken a small vessel from 
England, and went directly to the island ; had I 
loaded her, as I did the other vessel, with all the 
necessaries for the plantation, and for my people ; 
took a patent from the governor here to have se- 
cured my property, in subjection only to that of 
England ; had I carried over cannon and ammuni- 
tion, servants and people, to plant, and taking pos- 
session of the place, fortified and strengthened it in 
the name of England, and increased it with people, 
as I might easily have done ; had I then settled 
myself there, and sent the ship back loaden with 
good rice, as I might also have done in six months' 
time, and ordered my friends to have fitted her out 
again for our supply ; had I done this, and stayed 
there myself, I had at least acted like a man of 
common-sense. But I was possessed with a wander- 
ing spirit, scorned all advantages ; I pleased myself 
with being the patron of those people I placed there, 
and doing for them in a kind of haughty majestic 
way, like an old patriarchal monarch ; providing for 
them, as if I had been father of the whole family, 
as well as of the plantation. But I never so much 
as pretended to plant in the name of any govern- 
ment or nation, or to acknowledge any prince, or to 
call my people subjects to any one nation more than 
another; nay, I never so much as gave the place 
a name, but left it as I found it, belonging to no 
man, and the people under no discipline or govern- 
ment but my own, who, though I had influence over 
them as father and benefactor, had no authority or 

[186] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



power to act or command one way or other, farther 
than voluntary consent moved them to comply. 
Yet even this, had I stayed there, would have done 
well enough ; but as I rambled from them, and 
came there no more, the last letters I had from any 
of them was by my partner's means, who afterwards 
sent another sloop to the place, and who sent me 
word, though I had not the letter till five years after 
it was written, that they went on but poorly ; were 
malcontent with their long stay there ; that Will 
Atkins was dead ; that five of the Spaniards were 
come away ; and that though they had not been 
much molested by the savages, yet they had had 
some skirmishes with them ; and that they begged 
of him to write to me to think of the promise I had 
made to fetch them away, that they might see their 
own country again before they died. 

But I was gone a wild-goose chase indeed, and 
they that will have any more of me must be content 
to follow me through a new variety of follies, hard- 
ships, and wild adventures ; wherein the justice of 
Providence may be duly observed, and we may see how 
easily Heaven can gorge us with our own desires, make 
the strongest of our wishes be our affliction, and punish 
us most severely with those very things which we think 
it would be our utmost happiness to be allowed in. 

Let no wise man flatter himself with the strength 
of his own judgment, as if he was able to choose any 
particular station of life for himself. Man is a short- 
sighted creature, sees but a very little way before 
him ; and as his passions are none of his best friends, 
so his particular affections are generally his worst 
counsellors. 

I say this with respect to the impetuous desire I 
had from a youth to wander into the world, and how 
evident it now was that this principle was preserved 
in me for my punishment. How it came on, the 

[187 J 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



manner, the circumstance, and the conclusion of it, 
it is easy to give you historically, and with its utmost 
variety of particulars ; but the secret ends of Divine 
Power in thus permitting us to be hurried down the 
stream of our own desires, is only to be understood 
of those who can listen to the voice of Providence, 
and draw religious consequences from God's justice 
and their own mistakes. 

Be it I had business, or no business, away I went. 
ir ris no time now to enlarge any farther upon the 
reason or absurdity of my own conduct ; but to come 
to the history. I was embarked for the voyage, and 
the voyage I went. 

I should only add here, that my honest and truly 
pious clergyman left me here ; a ship being ready 
to go to Lisbon, he asked me leave to go thither, 
being still, as he observed, bound never to finish any 
voyage he began. How happy had it been for me if 
I had gone with him ! 

But it was too late now ; all things Heaven ap- 
points are best. Had I gone with him, I had never 
had so many things to be thankful for, and you had 
never heard of the Second Part of the Travels and 
Adventures of Robinson Crusoe ; so I must leave 
here the fruitless exclaiming at myself, and go on 
with my voyage. 

From the Brazils we made directly away over the 
Atlantic sea to the Cape de Bonne Esperance, or, as 
we call it, the Cape of Good Hope ; and had a toler- 
able good voyage, our course generally south-east ; 
now and then a storm, and some contrary winds. 
But my disasters at sea were at an end ; my future 
rubs and cross events were to befall me on shore, 
that it might appear the land was as well prepared 
to be our scourge as the sea, when Heaven, who 
directs the circumstances of things, pleases to appoint 
it to be so. 

[188] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



Our ship was on a trading voyage, and had a 
supercargo on board, who was to direct all her 
motions after she arrived at the Cape ; only being 
limited to certain numbers of days for stay, by 
charter-party, at the several ports she was to go to. 
This was none of my business, neither did I meddle 
with it at all ; my nephew the captain, and the 
supercargo, adjusting all those things between them 
as they thought fit. 

We made no stay at the Cape longer than was 
needful to take in fresh water, but made the best of 
our way for the coast of Coromandel. We were in- 
deed informed that a French man-of-war of fifty 
guns and two large merchant ships were gone for the 
Indies ; and as I knew we were at war with France, I 
had some apprehensions of them ; but they went 
their way, and we heard no more of them. 

I shall not pester my account, or the reader, with 
descriptions of places, journals of our voyages, varia- 
tions of the compass, latitudes, meridian distances, 
trade winds, situation of ports, and the like ; such as 
almost all the histories of long navigation are full of, 
and makes the reading tiresome enough, and are 
perfectly unprofitable to all that read it, except only 
to those who are to go to those places themselves. 

It is enough to name the ports and places which 
we touched at, and what occurred to us upon our 
passing from one to another. We touched first at 
the island of Madagascar, where, though the people 
are fierce and treacherous, and, in particular, very 
well armed with lances and bows, which they use 
with inconceivable dexterity, yet we fared very well 
with them a while ; they treated us very civilly ; and 
for some trifles which we gave them, such as knives, 
scissors, &c., they brought us eleven good fat bul- 
locks, middling in size, but very good in flesh, 
which we took in, partly for fresh provisions for 

[189] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



our present spending, and the rest to salt for the 

ship's use. 

We were obliged to stay here some time after 
we had furnished ourselves with provisions ; and I, 
that was always too curious to look into every nook 
of the world wherever I came, was for going on 
shore as fast as I could. It was on the east side of 
the island that we went on shore one evening, and 
the people, who by the way are very numerous, came 
thronging about us, and stood gazing at us at a 
distance ; but as we had traded freely with them, and 
had been kindly used, we thought ourselves in no 
danger. But when we saw the people, we cut three 
boughs out of a tree, and stuck them up at a dis- 
tance from us, which it seems is a mark in the country 
not only of truce and friendship, but when it is 
accepted the other side set up three poles or boughs, 
which is a signal that they accept the truce too ; but 
then this is a known condition of the truce, that you 
arc not to pass between their three poles towards 
them, nor they to come past your three poles or 
boughs towards you ; so that you are perfectly secure 
within the three poles, and all the space between 
your poles and theirs is allowed like a market for 
free converse, traffic, and commerce. When you go 
there, you must not carry your weapons with you ; 
and if they come into that space, they stick up their 
javelins and lances, all at the first poles, and come 
on unarmed ; but if any violence is offered them, 
and the truce thereby broken, away they run to the 
poles and lay hold of their weapons, and then the 
truce is at an end. 

It happened one evening when we went on shore 
that a greater number of their people came down 
than usual, but all was very friendly and civil, and 
they brought in several kinds of provisions, for which 
we satisfied them with such toys as we had ; their 

[190] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



women also brought us milk and roots, and several 
things very acceptable to us, and all was quiet ; and 
we made us a little tent or hut, of some boughs of 
trees, and lay on shore all night. 

I knew not what was the occasion, but I was not 
so well satisfied to lie on shore as the rest ; and the 
boat lying at an anchor about a stone cast from the 
land, with two men in her to take care of her, I 
made one of them come on shore, and getting some 
boughs of trees to cover us also in the boat, I spread 
the sail on the bottom of the boat, and lay under 
the cover of the branches of trees all night in the 
boat. 

About two o'clock in the morning we heard one 
of our men make a terrible noise on the shore, call- 
ing out for God's sake to bring the boat in, and 
come and help them, for they were all like to be 
murdered ; at the same time I heard the firing of 
five muskets, which was the number of the guns 
they had, and that three times over ; for it seems 
the natives here were not so easily frighted with 
guns as the savages were in America, where I had to 
do with them. 

All this while I knew not what was the matter ; 
but rousing immediately from sleep with the noise, I 
caused the boat to be thrust in, and resolved, with 
three fusils we had on board, to land and assist our 
men. 

We got the boat soon to the shore, but our men 
were in too much haste ; for being come to the 
shore, they plunged into the water to get to the 
boat with all the expedition they could, being pur- 
sued by between three and four hundred men. Our 
men were but nine in all, and only five of them had 
fusils with them ; the rest had, indeed, pistols and 
swords, but they were of small use to them. 

We took up seven of our men, and with difficulty 
[ 391 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 

enough too, three of them being very ill wounded ; 
and that which was still worse was, that while we 
stood in the boat to take our men in, we were in as 
much danger as they were in on shore ; for they 
poured their arrows in upon us so thick, that we 
were fain to barricade the side of the boat up with 
the benches and two or three loose boards, which to 
our great satisfaction we had by mere accident, or 
providence, in the boat. 

And yet had it been daylight, they are, it seems, 
such exact marksmen, that if they could have seen 
but the least part of any of us, they would have 
been sure of us. We had, by the light of the moon, 
a little sight of them as they stood pelting us from 
the shore with darts and arrows ; and having got 
ready our firearms, we gave them a volley, and we 
could hear by the cries of some of them that we had 
wounded several. However, they stood thus in bat- 
tle array on the shore till break of day, which we 
suppose was that they might see the better to take 
their aim at us. 

In this condition we lay, and could not tell how 
to weigh our anchor, or set up our sail, because we 
must needs stand up in the boat, and they were as 
sure to hit us, as we were to hit a bird in a tree with 
small shot. We made signals of distress to the ship, 
which, though we rode a league off, yet my nephew, 
the captain, hearing our firing, and by glasses per- 
ceiving the posture we lay in, and that we fired 
towards the shore, pretty well understood us ; and 
weighing anchor with all speed, he stood as near the 
shore as he durst with the ship, and then sent an- 
other boat with ten hands in her to assist us ; but 
we called to them not to come too near, telling them 
what condition we were in. However, they stood in 
nearer to us ; and one of the men taking the end of 
a tow-line in his hand, and keeping our boat between 

[ 192 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



him and the enemy, so that they could not perfectly 
see him, swam on board us, and made fast the line 
to the boat, upon which we slipped our little cable, 
and leaving our anchor behind, they towed us out of 
reach of the arrows, we all the while lying close be- 
hind the barricado we had made. 

As soon as we were got from between the ship and 
the shore, that she could lay her side to the shore, 
she ran along just by them, and we poured in a 
broadside among them, loaden with pieces of iron and 
lead, small bullets, and such stuff, besides the great 
shot, which made a terrible havoc amongst them. 

When we were got on board and out of danger, 
we had time to examine into the occasion of this 
fray ; and indeed our supercargo, who had been 
often in those parts, put me upon it ; for he said he 
was sure the inhabitants would not have touched us 
after we had made a truce, if we had not done some- 
thing to provoke them to it. At length it came 
out, viz., that an old woman, who had come to sell 
us some milk, had brought it within our poles, with 
a young woman with her, who also brought some 
roots or herbs ; and while the old woman, whether 
she was mother to the young woman or no they 
could not tell, was selling us the milk, one of our 
men offered some rudeness to the wench that was 
with her, at which the old woman made a great 
noise. However, the seaman would not quit his 
prize, but carried her out of the old woman's sight 
among the trees, it being almost dark. The old 
woman went away without her, and, as we suppose, 
made an outcry among the people she came from ; 
who, upon notice, raised this great army upon us in 
three or four hours ; and it was great odds but we 
had been all destroyed. 

One of our men was killed with a lance thrown at 
him just at the beginning of the attack, as he sallied 

VOL. II. -13 [ 193 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



out of the tent they had made ; the rest came off 
free, all but the fellow who was the occasion of all 
the mischief, who paid dear enough for his black 
mistress, for we could not hear what became of him 
a great while. We lay upon the shore two days 
after, though the wind presented, and made signals 
for him ; made our boat sail up shore and down 
shore several leagues, but in vain ; so we were obliged 
to give him over ; and if he alone had suffered for it, 
the loss had been the less. 

I could not satisfy myself, however, without ven- 
turing on shore once more to try if I could learn 
anything of him or them. It was the third night 
after the action that I had a great mind to learn, if 
I could by any means, what mischief we had done, 
and how the game stood on the Indians' 1 side. I 
was careful to do it in the dark, lest we should be 
attacked again ; but I ought indeed to have been 
sure that the men I went with had been under my 
command before I engaged in a thing so hazardous 
and mischievous, as I was brought into by it without 
my knowledge or design. 

We took twenty stout fellows with us as any in 
the ship, besides the supercargo and myself ; and we 
landed two hours before midnight, at the same place 
where the Indians stood drawn up the evening be- 
fore. I landed here, because my design, as I have 
said, was chiefly to see if they had quitted the field, 
and if they had left any marks behind them of the 
mischief we had done them ; and I thought if we 
could surprise one or two of them, perhaps we might- 
get our man again by way of exchange. 

We landed without any noise, and divided our 
men into two bodies, whereof the boatswain com- 
manded one, and I the other. We neither saw or 
heard anybody stir when we landed, and we marched 
up, one body at a distance from the other, to the 

[ 194] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



place, but at first could see nothing, it being very 
dark ; till by-and-by our boatswain, that led the 
first party, stumbled and fell over a dead body. 
This made them halt awhile ; for knowing by the 
circumstances that they were at the place where the 
Indians had stood, they waited for my coming up. 
Here we concluded to halt till the moon began to 
rise, which we knew would be in less than an hour, 
when we could easily discern the havoc we had made 
among them. We told two and thirty bodies upon 
the ground, whereof two were not quite dead ; some 
had an arm, and some a leg, shot off, and one his 
head ; those that were wounded we supposed they 
had carried away. 

When we had made, as I thought, a full discovery 
of all we could come at the knowledge of, I was 
resolved for going on board ; but the boatswain and 
his party sent me word that they were resolved to 
make a visit to the Indian town, where these dogs, 
as they called them, dwelt, and asked me to go 
along with them ; and if they could find them, as 
still they fancied they should, they did not doubt 
getting a good booty, and it might be they might 
find Tho. Jeffery there ; that was the man's name 
we had lost. 

Had they sent to ask my leave to go, I knew well 
enough what answer to have given them ; for I 
would have commanded them instantly on board, 
knowing it was not a hazard fit for us to run who 
had a ship and ship-loading in our charge, and a 
voyage to make, which depended very much upon 
the lives of the men ; but as they sent me word they 
were resolved to go, and only asked me and my 
company to go along with them, I positively refused 
it, and rose up, for I was sitting on the ground, in 
order to go to the boat. One or two of the men 
began to importune me to go, and when I refused 

[195] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



positively began to grumble, and say they were not 
under my command, and they would go. " Come, 
Jack/ 1 says one of the men, " will you go with me ? 
Ill go for one." Jack said he would ; and another 
followed, and then another ; and in a word, they all 
left me but one, whom I persuaded to stay, and a 
boy left in the boat ; so the supercargo and. I, with 
the third man, went back to the boat, where we told 
them we would stay for them, and take care to take 
in as many of them as should be left ; for I told 
them it was a mad thing they were going about, 
and supposed most of them would run the fate of 
Thomas Jeffery. 

They told me, like seamen, they'd warrant it 
they would come off again, and they would take 
care, &c. So away they went. I entreated them to 
consider the ship and voyage ; that their lives were 
not their own ; and that they were entrusted with 
the voyage in some measure ; that if they miscar- 
ried, the ship might be lost for want of their help ; 
and that they could not answer it to God or man. 
I said a great deal more to them on that head, but 
I might as well have talked to the mainmast of the 
ship ; they were mad upon their journey ; only they 
gave me good words, and begged I would not be 
angry ; that they would be very cautious, and they 
did not doubt out they would be back again in 
about an hour at farthest; for the Indian town, 
they said, was not above half a mile off, though 
they found it above two miles before they got 
to it. 

Well, they all went away, as above ; and though 
the attempt was desperate, and such as none but 
madmen would have gone about, yet, to give 
them their due, they went about it as warily as 
boldly. They were gallantly armed, that's true; 
for they had every man a fusil or musket, a bayonet, 

[19G] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



and every man a pistol ; some of them had broad 
cutlasses, some of them hangers, and the boatswain 
and two more had pole-axes; besides all which they 
had among them thirteen hand grenades. Bolder 
fellows, and better provided, never went about any 
wicked work in the world. 

When they went out their chief design was plun- 
der, and they were in mighty hopes of finding gold 
there ; but a circumstance, which none of them were 
aware of, set them on fire with revenge, and made 
devils of them all. When they came to the few 
Indian houses which they thought had been the 
town, which was not above half a mile off, they 
were under a great disappointment ; for there were 
not above twelve or thirteen houses ; and where the 
town was, or how big, they knew not. They con- 
sulted therefore what to do, and were some time 
before they could resolve ; for if they fell upon these 
they must cut all their throats, and it was ten to 
one but some of them might escape, it being in the 
night, though the moon was up ; and if one escaped, 
he would run away and raise all the town, so they 
should have a whole army upon them. Again, on 
the other hand, if they went away, and left those 
untouched, for the people were all asleep, they could 
not tell which way to look for the town. 

However, the last was the best advice ; so they 
resolved to leave them, and look for the town as 
well as they could. They went on a little way, and 
found a cow tied to a tree ; this they presently con- 
cluded would be a good guide to them ; for they said 
the cow certainly belonged to the town before them 
or the town behind them, and if they untied her 
they should see which way she went. If she went 
back, they had nothing to say to her ; but if she went 
forward, they had nothing to do but to follow her ; 
so they cut the cord, which was made of twisted flags, 

[ 197 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



and the cow went on before them. In a word, the 
cow led them directly to the town, which, as they 
report, consisted of above two hundred houses or 
huts, and in some of these they found several families 
living tog-ether. 

Here they found all in silence, as profoundly 
secure as sleep and a country that had never seen 
an enemy of that kind could made them. And first 
they called another council to consider what they 
had to do, and in a word, they resolved to divide 
themselves into three bodies, and to set three houses 
on fire in three parts of the town ; and as the men 
came out, to seize them and bind them ; if any re- 
sisted, they need not be asked what to do then, and 
so to search the rest of the houses for plunder ; but 
they resolved to march silently first through the 
town, and see what dimensions it was of, and if they 
might venture upon it or no. 

They did so, and desperately resolved that they 
would venture upon them ; but while they were ani- 
mating one another to the work, three of them that 
were a little before the rest called out aloud to 
them, and told them they had found Tom Jeff cry ; 
they all ran up to the place ; and so it was indeed, 
for there they found the poor fellow, hanged up 
naked by one arm, and his throat cut. There was 
an Indian house just by the tree, where they found 
sixteen or seventeen of the principal Indians who had 
been concerned in the fray with us before, and two 
or three of them wounded with our shot ; and our 
men found they were awake, and talking one to 
another in that house, but knew not their number. 

The sight of their poor mangled comrade so en- 
raged them, as before, that they swore to one 
another they would be revenged, and that not an 
Indian who came into their hands should have quar- 
ter ; and to work they went immediately, and yet not 

[198] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



so madly as by the rage and fury they were in might 
be expected. Their first care was to get something 
that would soon take fire ; but after a little search 
they found that would be to no purpose, for most 
of the houses were low, and thatched with flags or 
rushes, of which the country is full ; so they pres- 
ently made some wild-fire, as we call it, by wetting a 
little powder in the palms of their hands ; and in a 
quarter of an hour they set the town on fire in four 
or five places, and particularly that house where the 
Indians were not gone to bed. As soon as the fire 
began to blaze, the poor frighted creatures began to 
rush out to save their lives, but met with their fate 
in the attempt, and especially at the door, where 
they drove them back, the boatswain himself killing 
one or two with his pole-axe ; the house being large, 
and many in it, he did not care to go in, but called 
for a hand-grenade, and threw it among them, which 
at first frighted them ; but when it burst made such 
havoc among them, that they cried out in a hideous 
manner. 

In short, most of the Indians who were in the open 
part of the house were killed or hurt with the gren- 
ade, except two or three more, who pressed to the 
door, which the boatswain and two more kept with 
their bayonets in the muzzles of their pieces, and 
despatched all who came that way. But there was 
another apartment in the house, where the prince, 
or king, or whatever he was, and several other, were ; 
and these they kept in till the house, which was by 
this time all of a light flame, fell in upon them, and 
they were smothered or burnt together. 

All this while they fired not a gun, because they 
would not waken the people faster than they could 
master them ; but the fire began to waken them fast 
enough, and our fellows were glad to keep a little 
together in bodies ; for the fire grew so raging, all 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



the houses being made of light combustible stuff, 
that they could hardly bear the street between them, 
and their business was to follow the fire for the surer 
execution. As fast as the fire either forced the people 
out of those houses which were burning, or frighted 
them out of others, our people were ready at their 
doors to knock them on the head, still calling and 
hallooing to one another to remember Thomas Jeffery. 

While this was doing I must confess I was very 
uneasy, and especially when I saw the flames of 
the town, which, it being night, seemed to be just 
by me. 

My nephew, the captain, who was roused by his 
men too, seeing such a fire, was very uneasy, not 
knowing what the matter was, or what danger I 
was in ; especially hearing the guns too, for by this 
time they began to use their firearms. A thousand 
thoughts oppressed his mind concerning me and the 
supercargo, what should become of us ; and at last, 
though he could ill spare any more men, yet, not 
knowing what exigence we might be in, he takes 
another boat, and with thirteen men and himself 
come on shore to me. 

He was surprised to see me and the supercargo in 
the boat with no more than two men ; and though 
he was glad that we were well, yet he was in the 
same impatience with us to know what was doing ; 
for the noise continued, and the flame increased. In 
short, it was next to an impossibility for any men in 
the world to restrain their curiosity to know what 
had happened, or their concern for the safety of the 
men. In a word, the captain told me he would go 
and help his men, let what would come. I argued 
with him, as I did before with the men, the safety 
of the ship, the danger of the voyage, the interest 
of the owners and merchants, &c, and told him I 
would go, and the two men, and only see if we could, 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



at a distance, learn what was like to be the event, 
and come back and tell him. 

It was all one to talk to my nephew, as it was to 
talk to the rest before ; he would go, he said, and he 
only wished he had left but ten men in the ship, for 
he could not think of having his men lost for want 
of help ; he had rather lose the ship, the voyage, and 
his life and all, and away went he. 

In a word, I was no more able to stay behind now 
than I was to persuade them not to go ; so, in short, 
the captain ordered two men to row back the pin- 
nace, and fetch twelve men more, leaving the long- 
boat at an anchor ; and that when they came back 
six men should keep the two boats, and six more 
come after us, so that he left only sixteen men in 
the ship ; for the whole ship's company consisted of 
sixty-five men, whereof two were lost in the last 
quarrel which brought this mischief on. 

Being now on the march, you may be sure we felt 
little of the ground we trod on ; and being guided 
by the fire, we kept no path, but went directly to the 
place of the flame. If the noise of the guns were 
surprising to us before, the cries of the poor people 
were now of quite another nature, and filled us with 
horror. I must confess I never was at the sacking 
a city, or at the taking a town by storm. I had 
heard of Oliver Cromwell taking Drogheda in Ire- 
land, and killing man, woman, and child ; and I had 
read of Count Tilly sacking the city of Magdeburg, 
and cutting the throats of 22,000 of all sexes ; but 
I never had an idea of the thing itself before, nor is 
it possible to describe it, or the horror which was 
upon our minds at hearing it. 

However, we went on, and at length came to the 
town, though there was no entering the streets of it 
for the fire. The first object we met with was the 
ruins of a hut or house, or rather the ashes of it, for 

[ 201 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



the house was consumed ; and just before it, plain 
now to be seen by the light of the fire, lay four men 
and three women killed ; and, as we thought, one or 
two more lay in the heap among the fire. In short, 
there were such instances of a rage altogether bar- 
barous, and of a fury something beyond what was 
human, that we thought it impossible our men could 
be guilty of it ; or if they were the authors of it, we 
thought they ought to be every one of them put to 
the worst of deaths. But this was not all ; we saw 
the fire increased forward, and the cry went on just 
as the fire went on, so that we were in the utmost 
confusion. We advanced a little way farther, and 
behold, to our astonishment, three women naked, and 
crying in a most dreadful manner, come flying as if 
they had indeed had wings, and after them sixteen 
or seventeen men, natives, in the same terror and 
consternation, with three of our English butchers, 
for I can call them no better, in their rear, who when 
they could not overtake them fired in among them, 
and one that was killed by their shot fell down in 
our sight. When the rest saw us, believing us to be 
their enemies, and that we would murder them as 
well as those that pursued them, they set up a most 
dreadful shriek, especially the women, and two of 
them fell down as if already dead with the fright. 

My very soul shrunk within me, and my blood ran 
chill in my veins when I saw this ; and I believe had 
the three English sailors that pursued them come on, 
I had made our men kill them all. However, we 
took some ways to let the poor flying creatures know 
that we would not hurt them, and immediately they 
came up to us, and kneeling down, with their hands 
lifted up, made piteous lamentation to us to save 
them, which we let them know we would ; where- 
upon they crept all together in a huddle close behind 
us as for protection. I left my men drawn up to- 

[ 202 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



gether, and charged them to hurt nobody, but if 
possible to get at some of our people, and see what 
devil it was possessed them, and what they in- 
tended to do ; and in a word, to command them off, 
assuring them that if they stayed till daylight they 
would have a hundred thousand men about their 
ears ; I say, I left them and went among those flying 
people, taking only two of our men with me ; and 
there was indeed a piteous spectacle among them. 
Some of them had their feet terribly burnt with 
trampling and running through the fire, others their 
hands burnt. One of the women had fallen down in 
the fire, and was very much burnt before she could 
get out again ; and two or three of the men had cuts 
in their backs and thighs, from our men pursuing ; 
and another was shot through the body, and died 
while I was there. 

I would fain have learned what the occasion of all 
this was, but I could not understand one word they 
said, though by signs I perceived that some of them 
knew not what was the occasion themselves. I was 
so terrified in my thoughts at this outrageous at- 
tempt, that I could not stay there, but went back to 
my own men, and resolved to go into the middle of 
the town through the fire, or whatever might be in 
the way, and put an end to it, cost what it would. 
Accordingly, as soon as I came back to my mem, I 
told them my resolution, and commanded them to 
follow me, when in the very moment came four of 
our men, with the boatswain at their head, roving 
over the heaps of bodies they had killed, all covered 
with blood and dust, as if they wanted more people 
to massacre, when our men hallooed to them as loud 
as they could halloo, and with much ado one of them 
made them hear, so that they knew who we were, and 
came up to us. 

As soon as the boatswain saw us he set up a 
[ 203 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 

halloo, like a shout of triumph, for having, as he 
thought, more help come; and without bearing to hear 
me, " Captain," says he, " noble captain, I am glad 
you are come ! We have not half done yet, villain- 
ous hell-hound dogs ! I "ll kill as many of them as 
poor Tom has hairs upon his head. We have sworn 
to spare none of them ; we '11 root out the very 
nation of them from the earth." And thus he ran 
on, out of breath, too, with action, and would not 
give us leave to speak a word. 

At last, raising my voice, that I might silence him 
a little, " Barbarous dog ! " said I, " what are you 
doing ? I won't have one creature touched more 
upon pain of death. I charge you upon your life to 
stop your hands, and stand still here, or you are a 
dead man this minute.' 1 

" Why, sir," says he, " do you know what you do, 
or what they have done ? If you want a reason for 
what we have done, come hither ; " and with that he 
showed me the poor fellow hanging with his throat 
cut. 

I confess I was urged then myself, and at another 
time would have been forward enough ; but I thought 
they had carried their rage too far, and I thought 
of Jacob's words to his sons Simeon and Levi, "Cursed 
be their anger, for it was fierce ; and their wrath, for 
it was cruel." But I had now a new task upon my 
hands ; for when the men I carried with me saw the 
sight as I had done, I had as much to do to restrain 
them as I should have had with the others ; nay, my 
nephew himself fell in with them, and told me in 
their hearing that he was only concerned for fear of 
the men being overpowered ; for as to the people, he 
thought not one of them ought to live ; for they had 
all glutted themselves with the murder of the poor 
man, and that they ought to be used like murderers. 
Upon these words away ran eight of my men with 



71

ROBINSON CRUSOE 



the boatswain and his crew to complete their bloody 
work ; and I, seeing it quite out of my power to 
restrain them, came away pensive and sad, for I could 
not bear the sight, much less the horrible noise and 
cries of the poor wretches that fell into their hands. 

I got nobody to come back with me but the 
supercargo and two men, and with these I walked 
back to the boats. It was a very great piece of folly 
in me, I confess, to venture back as it were alone; for 
as it began now to be almost day, and the alarm had 
run over the country, there stood above forty men 
armed with lances and bows at the little place where 
the twelve or thirteen houses stood mentioned be- 
fore ; but by accident I missed the place, and came 
directly to the seaside ; and by the time I got to the 
seaside it was broad day. Immediately I took the 
pinnace and went aboard, and sent her back to assist 
the men in what might happen. 

I observed about the time that I came to the boat- 
side that the fire was pretty well out, and the noise 
abated ; but in about half-an-hour after I got on 
board I heard a volley of our men's firearms, and 
saw a great smoke ; this, as I understood afterwards, 
was our men falling upon the men who, as I said, 
stood at the few houses on the way ; of whom they 
killed sixteen or seventeen, and set all those houses 
on fire, but did not meddle with the women or 
children. 

By that time the men got to the shore again with 
the pinnace our men began to appear ; they came 
dropping in some and some, not in two bodies, and 
in form, as they went, but all in heaps, straggling 
here and there in such a manner that a small force 
of resolute men might have cut them all off. 

But the dread of them was upon the whole 
country ; and the men were amazed and surprised, 
and so frighted, that I believe a hundred of them 

[ 205 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



1 



would have fled at the sight of but five of our men. 
Nor in all this terrible action was there a man who 
made any considerable defence ; they were so sur- 
prised between the terror of the fire, and the sudden 
attack of our men in the dark, that they knew not 
which way to turn themselves ; for if they fled one 
way, they were met by one party ; if back again, by 
another; so that they were everywhere knocked 
down. Nor did any of our men receive the least 
hurt, except one, who strained his foot, and another 
had one of his hands very much burnt. 

I was very angry with my nephew the captain, 
and indeed with all the men, in my mind, but with 
him in particular, as well for his acting so out of his 
duty as commander of the ship, and having the 
charge of the voyage upon him, as in his prompting 
rather than cooling the rage of his men in so bloody 
and cruel an enterprise. My nephew answered me 
very respectfully, but told me that when he saw the 
body of the poor seaman whom they had murdered 
in such a cruel and barbarous manner he was not 
master of himself, neither could he govern his pas- 
sion. He owned he should not have done so, as he 
was commander of the ship ; but as he was a man, 
and nature moved him, he could not bear it. As 
for the rest of the men, they were not subject to me 
at all, and they knew it well enough, so they took 
no notice of my dislike. 

The next day we set sail, so we never heard any 
more of it. Our men differed in the account of the 
number they killed ; some said one thing, some 
another ; but according to the best of their ac- 
counts, put all together, they killed or destroyed 
about one hundred and fifty people, men, women, 
and children, and left not a house standing in the 
town. 

As for the poor fellow, Tho. JefFery, as he was 

[206] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



quite dead, for his throat was so cut that his head 
was half off, it would do him no service to bring 
him away ; so they left him where they found him, 
only took him down from the tree where he was 
hanged by one hand. 

However just our men thought this action, I was 
against them in it, and I always after that time told 
them God would blast the voyage ; for I looked 
upon all the blood they shed that night to be mur- 
der in them ; for though it is true that they had 
killed Tho. Jeffery, yet it was as true that Jeffery was 
the aggressor, had broken the truce, and had violated 
or debauched a young woman of theirs, who came 
down to them innocently, and on the faith of their 
public capitulation. 

The boatswain defended this quarrel when we 
were afterwards on board. He said it is true that 
we seemed to break the truce, but really had not, 
and that the war was begun the night before by the 
natives themselves, who had shot at us, and killed 
one of our men without any just provocation ; so 
that as we were in a capacity to fight them now, we 
might also be in a capacity to do ourselves justice 
upon them in an extraordinary manner ; that though 
the poor man had taken a little liberty with a 
wench, he ought not to have been murdered, and 
that in such a villainous manner ; and that they did 
nothing but what was just, and what the laws of 
God allowed to be done to murderers. 

One would think this should have been enough to 
have warned us against going on shore among 
heathens and barbarians ; but it is impossible to 
make mankind wise but at their own experience ; 
and their experience seems to be always of most use 
to them when it is dearest bought. 

We were now bound to the Gulf of Persia, and 
from thence to the coast of Coromandel, only to 

[207] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



touch at Surat ; but the chief of the supercargo's 
design lay at the Bay of Bengal, where if he missed 
of his business outward-bound he was to go up to 
China, and return to the coast as he came home. 

The first disaster that befell us was in the Gulf of 
Persia, where five of our men venturing on shore on 
the Arabian side of the gulf were surrounded by the 
Arabians, and either all killed or carried away into 
slavery ; the rest of the boat's crew were not able to 
rescue them, and had but just time to get oft* their 
boat. I began to upbraid them with the just retri- 
bution of Heaven in this case ; but the boatswain 
very warmly told me he thought I went farther in 
my censures than I could show any warrant for 
in Scripture, and referred to the 13th of St. Luke, 
verse 4, where our Saviour intimates that those men 
on whom the tower of Siloam fell were not sinners 
above all the Galileans ; but that which indeed put 
me to silence in the case was, that not one of these 
five men who were now lost were of the number of 
those who went on shore to the massacre of Mada- 
gascar (so I always called it, though our men could 
not bear the word massacre with any patience) ; and, 
indeed, this last circumstance, as I have said, put me 
to silence for the present. 

But my frequent preaching to them on this sub- 
ject had worse consequences than I expected ; and 
the boatswain, who had been the head of the attempt, 
came up boldly to me one time, and told me he 
found that I continually brought that affair upon 
the stage, that I made unjust reflections upon it, 
and had used the men very ill on that account, and 
himself in particular; that as I was but a passenger, 
and had no command in the ship, or concern in the 
voyage, they were not obliged to bear it ; that they 
did not know but I might have some ill design in 
my head, and perhaps to call them to account for it 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



when they came to England ; and that, therefore, 
unless I would resolve to have done with it, and also 
not to concern myself any farther with him, or any 
of his affairs, he would leave the ship ; for he did not 
think it was safe to sail with me among them. 

I heard him patiently enough till he had done, 
and then told him that I did confess I had all along 
opposed the massacre of Madagascar, for such I would 
always call it ; and that I had on all occasions 
spoken my mind freely about it, though not more 
upon him than any of the rest ; that as to my having 
no command in the ship, that was true, nor did I 
exercise any authority, only took my liberty of 
speaking my mind in things which publicly con- 
cerned us all ; and what concern I had in the voyage 
was none of his business ; that I was a considerable 
owner of the ship, and in that claim I conceived I 
had a right to speak, even farther than I had yet 
done, and would not be accountable to him or any 
one else ; and began to be a little warm with him. 
He made but little reply to me at that time, and I 
thought that affair had been over. We were at 
this time in the road at Bengal ; and being willing 
to see the place, I went on shore with the supercargo 
in the ship's boat to divert myself ; and towards 
evening was preparing to go on board, when one of 
the men came to me, and told me he would not have 
me trouble myself to come down to the boat, for 
they had orders not to carry me on board any more. 
Any one may guess what a surprise I was in at so 
insolent a message ; and I asked the man who bade 
him deliver that errand to me ? He told me the 
coxswain. I said no more to the fellow, but bade 
him let them know he had delivered his message, 
and that I had given him no answer to it. 

I immediately went and found out the supercargo 
and told him the story, adding what I presently fore- 
vol. ir. - 14 [ 209 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



saw, viz., that there would certainly be a mutiny in the 
ship, and entreated him to go immediately on board 
the ship in an Indian boat, and acquaint the cap- 
tain of it. But I might have spared this intelligence, 
for before I had spoken to him on shore the matter 
was effected on board. The boatswain, the gunner, 
the carpenter, and, in a word, all the inferior officers, 
as soon as I was gone off in the boat, came up to the 
quarter-deck and desired to speak with the captain ; 
and there the boatswain making a long harangue, for 
the fellow talked very well, and repeating all he had 
said to me, told the captain in a few words that as I 
was now gone peaceably on shore, they were loath to 
use any violence with me ; which if I had not gone 
on shore, they would otherwise have done, to oblige 
me to have gone. They therefore thought fit to tell 
him that as they shipped themselves to serve in the 
ship under his command, they would perform it well 
and faithfully ; but if I would not quit the ship, or 
the captain oblige me to quit it, they would all leave 
the ship, and sail no farther with him ; and at that 
word " all," he turned his face about towards the 
mainmast, which was, it seems, the signal agreed on 
between them, at which all the seamen being got 
together they cried out, " One and all, one and all ! " 

My nephew, the captain, was a man of spirit, and 
of great presence of mind ; and though he was sur- 
prised, you may be sure, at the thing, yet he told 
them calmly that he would consider of the thing, 
but that he could do nothing in it till he had spoken 
to me about it. He used some arguments with them 
to show them the unreasonableness and injustice of 
the thing, but it was all in vain ; they swore, and 
shook hands round, before his face, that they would 
go all on shore unless he would engage to them not 
to suffer me to come any more on board the ship. 

This was a hard article upon him, who knew his 

[810] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



obligation to me, and did not know how I might 
take it ; so he began to talk cavalierly to them ; 
told them that I was a very considerable owner of 
the ship, and that in justice he could not put me 
out of my own house ; that this was next door to 
serving me as the famous pirate Kidd had done, who 
made the mutiny in a ship, set the captain on shore 
in an uninhabited island, and ran away with the 
ship ; that let them go into what ship they would, 
if ever they came to England again it would cost 
them dear; that the ship was mine, and that he 
could not put me out of it ; and that he would 
rather lose the ship, and the voyage too, than dis- 
oblige me so much ; so they might do as they 
pleased. However, he would go on shore, and talk 
with me on shore, and invited the boatswain to go 
with him, and perhaps they might accommodate the 
matter with me. 

But they all rejected the proposal, and said they 
would have nothing to do with me any more, neither 
on board or on shore ; and if I came on board, they 
would all go on shore. " Well," said the captain, 
" if you are all of this mind, let me go on shore and 
talk with him ; " so away he came to me with this 
account, a little after the message had been brought 
to me from the coxswain. 

I was very glad to see my nephew I must confess, 
for I was not without apprehensions that they would 
confine him by violence, set sail, and run away with 
the ship ; and then I had been stripped naked, in a 
remote country, and nothing to help myself ; in 
short, I had been in a worse case than when I was 
all alone in the island. 

But they had not come that length, it seems, to 
my great satisfaction ; and when my nephew told me 
what they had said to him, and how they had sworn, 
and shook hands, that they would one and all leave 

[211 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 

the ship if I was suffered to come on board, I told 
him he should not be concerned at it at all, for I 
would stay on shore. I only desired he would take 
care and send me all my necessary things on shore, 
and leave me a sufficient sum of money, and I would 
find my way to England as well as I could. 

This was a heavy piece of news to my nephew ; but 
there was no way to help it, but to comply with it. 
So, in short, he went on board the ship again, and 
satisfied the men that his uncle had yielded to their 
importunity, and had sent for his goods from on 
board the ship. So that matter was over in a very 
few hours ; the men returned to their duty, and I 
began to consider what course I should steer. 

I was now alone in the remotest part of the world, 
as I think I may call it, for I was near three thou- 
sand leagues, by sea, farther off from England than 
I was at my island ; only, it is true, I might travel 
here by land over the Great Mogul's country to 
Surat, might go from thence to Bassora by sea, up 
the Gulf of Persia, and from thence might take the 
way of the caravans over the desert of Arabia to 
Aleppo and Scanderoon, from thence by sea again 
to Italy, and so overland into France ; and this, put 
together, might be, at least, a full diameter of the 
globe ; but if it were to be measured, I suppose it 
would appear to be a great deal more. 

I had another way before me, which was to wait 
for some English ships which were coming to Bengal 
from Acheen, on the island of Sumatra, and get pas- 
sage on board them for England ; but as I came 
hither without any concern with the English East 
India Company, so it would be difficult to go from 
hence without their licence, unless with great favour 
of the captains of the ships, or of the Company's 
factors ; and to both I was an utter stranger. 

Here I had the particular pleasure, speaking by 

[ 212 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



contraries, to see the ship sail without me ; a treat- 
ment, I think, a man in my circumstances scarce 
ever met with, except from pirates running away 
with a ship, and setting those that would not agree 
with their villainy on shore: indeed, this was next 
door to it both ways. However, my nephew left me 
two servants, or rather, one companion and one ser- 
vant ; the first was clerk to the purser, whom he en- 
gaged to go with me, and the other was his own 
servant. I took me also a good lodging in the 
house of an Englishwoman, where several merchants 
lodged, some French, two Italians, or rather Jews, 
and one Englishman. Here I was handsomely 
enough entertained ; and that I might not be said 
to run rashly upon anything, I stayed here above 
nine months, considering what course to take, and 
how to manage myself. I had some English goods 
with me of value, and a considerable sum of money ; 
my nephew furnishing me with a thousand pieces of 
eight, and a letter of credit for more, if I had occa- 
sion, that I might not be straitened, whatever might 
happen. I quickly disposed of my goods, and to 
advantage too ; and as I originally intended, I 
bought here some very good diamonds, which, of all 
other things, was the most proper for me in my 
present circumstances, because I might always carry 
my whole estate about me. 

After a long stay here, and many proposals made 
for my return to England, but none falling out to 
my mind, the English merchant who lodged with 
me, and with whom I had contracted an intimate 
acquaintance, came to me one morning. " Country- 
man," says he, " I have a project to communicate 
to you, which, as it suits with my thoughts, may, 
for aught I know, suit with yours also, when you 
shall have thoroughly considered it. 

u Here we are posted," says he, " you by accident,

ROBINSON CRUSOE 



and I by my own choice, in a part of the world very 
remote from our own country ; but it is in a country 
where, by us who understand trade and business, a 
great deal of money is to be got. If you will put a 
thousand pounds to my thousand pounds, we will 
hire a ship here, the first we can get to our minds ; 
you shall be captain, 1 11 be merchant, and we will 
go a trading voyage to China ; for what should we 
6tand still for ? The whole world is in motion, roll- 
ing round and round ; all the creatures of God, 
heavenly bodies and earthly, are busy and diligent ; 
why should we be idle ? There are no drones in 
the world, but men ; why should we be of that 
number ? " 

I liked his proposal very well ; and the more be- 
cause it seemed to be expressed with so much good 
will, and in so friendly a manner. I will not say 
but that I might, by my loose and unhinged circum- 
stances, be the fitter to embrace a proposal for 
trade, or indeed for anything else ; whereas other- 
wise, trade was none of my element. However, I 
might, perhaps, say with some truth, that if trade 
was not my element, rambling was ; and no proposal 
for seeing any part of the world which I never had 
seen before, could possibly come amiss to me. 

It was, however, some time before we could get a 
ship to our minds ; and when we had got a vessel, it 
was not easy to get English sailors ; that is to say, 
so many as were necessary to govern the voyage, and 
manage the sailors which we should pick up there. 
After some time we got a mate, a boatswain, and a 
gunner, English ; a Dutch carpenter, and three Port- 
uguese foremastmen ; with these we found we could 
do well enough, having Indian seamen, such as they 
are, to make up. 

There are so many travellers who have wrote the 
history of their voyages and travels this way, that it 

[ 214 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



would be very little diversion to anybody to give a 
long account of the places we went to, and the 
people who inhabit there. Those things I leave to 
others, and refer the reader to those journals and 
travels of Englishmen, of which many I find are 
published, and more promised every day. Tis 
enough to me to tell you that I made this voyage to 
Achecn, in the island of Sumatra, and from thence 
to Si am, where we exchanged some of our wares for 
opium, and some arrack ; the first a commodity 
which bears a great price among the Chinese, and 
which, at that time, was very much wanted there ; 
in a word, we went up to Suskan, made a very great 
voyage, were eight months out, and returned to 
Bengal, and I was very well satisfied with my 
adventure. 

I observe, that our people in England often ad- 
mire how the officers which the Company send into 
India, and the merchants which generally stay there, 
get such very great estates as they do, and some- 
times come home worth sixty to seventy and a hun- 
dred thousand pounds at a time. But it is no 
wonder, or at least we shall see so much farther into 
it, when we consider the innumerable ports and 
places where they have a free commerce, that it will 
then be no wonder ; and much less will it be so when 
we consider, at all those places and ports where the 
English ships come, there is so much and such con- 
stant demand for the growth of all other countries, 
that there is a certain vent for the returns, as well 
as a market abroad for the goods earned out. 

In short, we made a very good voyage, and I got 
so much money by the first adventure, and such an 
insight into the method of getting more, that had I 
been twenty years younger I should have been 
tempted to have stayed here, and sought no farther 
for making my fortune. But what was all this to a 

[215] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 

man on the wrong side of threescore, that was rich 
enough, and came abroad more in obedience to a 
restless desire of seeing the world, than a covetous 
desire of getting in it ? And indeed I think "t is 
with great justice that I now call it a restless desire, 
for it was so. When I was at home, I was restless 
to go abroad ; and now I was abroad, I was restless 
to be at home. I say, what gain was this to me ? 
I was rich enough, nor had I any uneasy desires 
about getting more money ; and therefore the prof- 
its of the voyage to me were things of no great 
force for the prompting me forward to farther under- 
takings ; and I thought that by this voyage I had 
made no progress at all, because I was come back, as 
I might call it, to the place from whence I came, as 
to a home ; whereas my eye, which, like that which 
Solomon speaks of, was never satisfied with seeing, 
was still more desirous of wandering and seeing. I 
was come into a part of the world which I was never 
in before, and that part in particular which I had heard 
much of, and was resolved to see as much of as I 
could, and then I thought I might say I had seen all 
the world that was worth seeing. 

But my fellow-traveller and I had different 
notions. I do not name this to insist upon my own, 
for I acknowledge his were the most just, and the 
most suited to the end of a merchant's life, who, 
when he is abroad upon adventures, "t is his wisdom 
to stick to that as the best thing for him, which he 
is like to get the most money by. My new friend 
kept himself to the nature of the thing, and would 
have been content to have gone, like a carrier's 
horse, always to the same inn, backward and forward, 
provided he could, as he called it, find his account in 
it ; on the other hand, mine was the notion of a mad 
rambling boy, that never cares to see a thing twice 
over. 

[216] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



But this was not all. I had a kind of impatience 
upon me to be nearer home, and yet the most un- 
settled resolution imaginable which way to go. In 
the interval of these consultations, my friend, who 
was always upon the search for business, proposed 
another voyage to me among the Spice Islands, and 
to bring home a loading of cloves from the Manillas, 
or thereabouts ; places where, indeed, the Dutch do 
trade, but islands belonging partly to the Spaniards ; 
though we went not so far, but to some other, where 
they have not the whole power, as they have at 
Batavia, Ceylon, &c. We were not long in preparing 
for this voyage ; the chief difficulty was in bringing 
me to come into it. However, nothing else offer- 
ing, and finding that really stirring about and trad- 
ing, the profit being so great, and, as I may say, 
certain, had more pleasure in it, and more satisfaction 
to the mind, than sitting still, which, to me espe- 
cially, was the unhappiest part of life, I resolved on 
this voyage too, which we made very successfully, 
touching at Borneo and several islands, whose names 
I do not remember, and came home in about five 
months. We sold our spice, which was chiefly cloves, 
and some nutmegs, to the Persian merchants, who 
carried them away for the gulf ; and making near five 
of one, we really got a great deal of money. 

My friend, when we made up this account, smiled 
at me. " Well, now," said he, with a sort of agree- 
able insult upon my indolent temper, " is not this 
better than walking about here, like a man of noth- 
ing to do, and spending our time in staring at the 
nonsense and ignorance of the pagans ? " " Why 
truly," says I, " my friend, I think it is, and I begin 
to be a convert to the principles of merchandising ; 
but I must tell you," said I, " by the way, you do 
not know what I am a-doing ; for if once I conquer 
my backwardness, and embark heartily, as old as I 

[217] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



am, I shall harass you up and down the world till 
I tire you ; for I shall pursue it so eagerly, I shall 
never let you lie still." 

But to be short with my speculations. A little 
while after this there came in a Dutch ship from 
Batavia ; she was a coaster, not an European trader, 
and of about two hundred tons burden ; the men, as 
they pretended, having been so sickly, that the cap- 
tain had not men enough to go to sea with. He 
lay by at Bengal ; and having, it seems, got money 
enough, or being willing for other reasons to go for 
Europe, he gave public notice that he would sell his 
ship. This came to my ears before my new partner 
heard of it, and I had a great mind to buy it ; so I 
goes home to him, and told him of it. He considered 
awhile, for he was no rash man either; but musing 
some time, he replied, " She is a little too big ; but, 
however, we will have her." Accordingly we bought 
the ship ; and agreeing with the master, we paid for 
her, and took possession. When we had done so, we 
resolved to entertain the men, if we could, to join 
them with those we had, for the pursuing our busi- 
ness ; but on a sudden, they having received not 
their wages, but their share of the money, not one 
of them was to be found. We inquired much about 
them, and at length were told that they were all 
gone together, by land, to Agra, the great city of 
the Mogul's residence ; and from thence were to 
travel to Surat, and so by sea to the Gulf of Persia. 

Nothing had so heartily troubled me a good while, 
as that I missed the opportunity of going with them ; 
for such a ramble I thought, and in such company as 
would both have guarded me and diverted me, would 
have suited mightily with my great design ; and I 
should both have seen the world, and gone home- 
wards too. But I was much better satisfied a few 
(lavs after, when I came to know what sort of fellows 

[ 218 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



they were ; for, in short, their history was, that this 
man they called captain was the gunner only, not the 
commander ; that they had been a trading voyage, 
in which they were attacked on shore by some of the 
Malayans, who had killed the captain and three of 
his men ; and that after the captain was killed these 
men, eleven in number, had resolved to run away 
with the ship, which they did, and brought her in at 
the Bay of Bengal, leaving the mate and five men 
more on shore ; of whom we shall hear further. 

Well, let them come by the ship how they would, 
we came honestly by her, as we thought ; though we 
did not, I confess, examine into things so exactly as 
we ought ; for we never inquired anything of the 
seamen, who, if we had examined, would certainly 
have faltered in their account, contradicted one an- 
other, and perhaps contradicted themselves ; or, one 
how or other, we should have seen reason to have 
suspected them. But the man showed us a bill of 
sale for the ship to one Emanuel Clostershoven, or 
some such name, for I suppose it was all a forgery, 
and called himself by that name ; and we could not 
contradict him ; and being withal a little too un- 
wary, or at least having no suspicion of the thing, 
we went through with our bargain. 

We picked up some more English seamen here 
after this, and some Dutch ; and now we resolved 
for a second voyage to the south-east for cloves, &c., 
that is to say, among the Philippine and Malacca 
Isles ; and in short, not to fill this part of my story 
with trifles, when what is yet to come is so remark- 
able, I spent, from first to last, six years in this 
country, trading from port to port, backward and 
forward, and with very good success ; and was now 
the last year with my new partner, going in the ship 
above-mentioned, on a voyage to China, but design- 
ing first to Siam, to buy rice. 

[ 219 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



In this voyage, being by contrary winds obliged 
to beat up and down a great while in the Straits of 
Malacca, and among the islands, we were no sooner 
got clear of those difficult seas, but we found our 
ship had sprung a leak, and we were not able, by all 
our industry, to find it out where it was. This 
forced us to make for some port ; and my partner, 
who knew the country better than I did, directed 
the captain to put into the river of Cambodia ; for 
I had made the English mate, one Mr. Thompson, 
captain, not being willing to take the charge of two 
ships upon myself. This river lies on the north 
side of the great bay or gulf which goes up to 
Siam. 

While we were here, and going often on shore for 
refreshment, there comes to me one day an English- 
man, and he was, it seems, a gunner's mate on 
board an English East India ship, which rode in 
the same river, up at or near the city of Cambodia. 
What brought him hither, we know not ; but he 
comes up to me, and speaking in English, " Sir," 
says he, " you are a stranger to me, and I to you ; 
but I have something to tell you, that very nearly 
concerns you." 

I looked steadily at him a good while, and thought 
at first I had known him, but I did not. "If it 
very nearly concerns me," said I, " and not yourself, 
what moves you to tell it me ? " — "I am moved," 
says he, " by the imminent danger you are in ; and, 
for ought I see, you have no knowledge of it." — "I 
know no danger I am in," said I, " but that my 
ship is leaky, and I cannot find it out ; but I pur- 
pose to lay her aground to-morrow, to see if I can 
find it." — " But, sir," says he, " leaky or not leaky, 
find it or not find it, you will be wiser than to lay 
your ship on shore to-morrow, when you hear what 
I have to say to you. Do you know, sir," said he, 

[ 220 J 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



" the town of Cambodia lies about fifteen leagues 
up this river? And there are two large English 
ships about five leagues on this side, and three 
Dutch.'" — " Well," said I, "and what is that to 
me ? " — " Why, sir," said he, "is it for a man that 
is upon such adventures as you are upon to come 
into a port and not examine first what ships there 
are there, and whether he is able to deal with them ? 
I suppose you do not think you are a match for 
them ? " I was amused very much at his discourse, 
but not amazed at it, for I could not conceive what 
he meant. I turned short upon him, and said, " Sir, 
I wish you would explain yourself ; I cannot imagine 
what reason I have to be afraid of any company of 
ships, or Dutch ships ; I am no interloper ; what 
can they have to say to me ? " 

He looked like a man half angry, half pleased ; 
and pausing awhile, but smiling, " Well, sir,'" said 
he, " if you think yourself secure, you must take 
your chance. I am sorry your fate should blind 
you against good advice ; but assure yourself if you 
do not put to sea immediately, you will the very 
next tide be attacked by five longboats full of men ; 
and perhaps, if you are taken, you will be hanged 
for a pirate, and the particulars be examined after- 
wards. I thought, sir,"" added he, "I should have 
met with a better reception than this for doing you 
a piece of service of such importance.'''' — "I can 
never be ungrateful, 1 ' said I, " for any service, or to 
any man that offers me any kindness ; but it is past 
my comprehension," said I, " what they should have 
such a design upon me for. However, since you 
say there is no time to be lost, and that there is 
some villainous design in hand against me, 1 11 go 
on board this minute, and put to sea immediately, 
if my men can stop the leak, or if we can swim 
without stopping it ; but, sir," said I, " shall I go 

[ 221 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



away ignorant of the reason of all this ? Can you 
give me no farther light into it?" 

" I can tell you but part of the story, sir," says 
he ; " but I have a Dutch seaman here with me, and 
I believe I could persuade him to tell you the rest ; 
but there is scarce time for it. But the short of the 
story is this, the first part of which, I suppose, you 
know well enough, viz., that you was with this ship at 
Sumatra ; that there your captain was murdered by 
the Malayans, with three of his men; and that you, or 
some of those who were on board with you, ran away 
with the ship, and are since turned pirates. This is the 
sum of the story, and you will be all seized as pirates, 
I can assure you, and executed with very little cere- 
mony ; for you know merchant-ships show but little 
law to pirates, if they get them into their power." 

" Now you speak plain English," said I, " and I 
thank you ; and though I know nothing that we have 
done like what you talk of, but am sure we came 
honestly and fairly by the ship, yet seeing such work 
is a-doing, as you say, and that you seem to mean 
honestly, 1 11 be upon my guard." — " Nay, sir," says 
he, " do not talk of being upon your guard ; the best 
defence is to be out of the danger. If you have any 
regard to your life, and the lives of all your men, put 
out to sea without fail at high-water ; and as you 
have a whole tide before you, you will be gone too 
far out before they can come down, for they come 
away at high-water ; and as they have twenty miles 
to come, you get near two hours of them by the 
difference of the tide, not reckoning the length of 
the way ; besides, as they are only boats, and not 
ships, they will not venture to follow you far out to 
sea, especially if it blows." 

" Well," says I, " you have been very kind in this ; 
what shall I do for you to make you amends ? " — 
" Sir," says he, " you may not be so willing to make 

[ 222 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



me any amends, because you may not be convinced 
of the truth of it. I'll make an offer to you. I 
have nineteen months' pay due to me on board the 

ship , which I came out of England in ; and 

the Dutchman that is with me has seven months' 
pay due to him ; if you will make good our pay to 
us, we will go along with you ; and if you find no 
more in it, we will desire no more ; but if we do con- 
vince you that we have saved your lives, and the ship, 
and the lives of all the men in her, we will leave the 
rest to you." 

I consented to this readily, and went immediately 
on board, and the two men with me. As soon as I 
came to the ship's side, my partner, who was on 
board, came out on the quarter-deck, and called to 
me with a great deal of joy, " O ho ! O ho ! we have 
stopped the leak ! we have stopped the leak ! " — 
" Say you so ? " said I ; " thank God ! but weigh 
the anchor immediately." — " Weigh ! " says he ; 
" what do you mean by that ? What is the mat- 
ter ? " says he. — w Ask no questions," says I, " but 
all hands to work, and weigh without losing a 
minute." He was surprised ; but, however, he called 
the captain, and he immediately ordered the anchor 
to be got up ; and though the tide was not quite 
done, yet a little land-breeze blowing, we stood out 
to sea. Then I called him into the cabin, and told 
him the story at large ; and we called in the men, 
and they told us the rest of it. But as it took us up 
a great deal of time, so before we had done a seaman 
comes to the cabin door, and calls out to us, 
that the captain bade him tell us we were chased. 
" Chased ! " said I ; "by whom, and by what ? " — 
" By five sloops, or boats," says the fellow, " full of 
men." — " Very well," said I ; " then it is apparent 
there is something in it." In the next place, I 
ordered all our men to be called up, and told them 

[223] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



that there was a design to seize the ship, and to take 
us for pirates, and asked them if they would stand 
by us, and by one another? The men answered 
cheerfully that, one and all, they would live and die 
with us. Then I asked the captain what way he 
thought best for us to manage the fight with them, 
for resist them I was resolved we would, and that to 
the last drop. He said readily, that the way was to 
keep them off with our great shot as long as we 
could, and then to fire at them with our small arms 
as long as we could ; but when neither of these would 
do any longer, we should retire to our close quarters ; 
perhaps they had not materials to break open our 
bulk-heads, or get in upon us. 

The gunner had, in the meantime, order to bring 
two guns to bear fore and aft out of the steerage, 
to clear the deck, and load them with musket- 
bullets and small pieces of old iron, and what next 
came to hand, and thus we made ready for fight ; 
but all this while we kept out to sea, with wind 
enough, and could see the boats at a distance, being 
five large longboats, following us with all the sail 
they could make. 

Two of these boats, which by our glasses we could 
see were English, outsailed the rest, and were near 
two leagues ahead of them, and gained upon us con- 
siderably, so that we found they would come up with 
us ; upon which we fired a gun without ball, to 
intimate that they should bring to ; and we put out 
a flag of truce, as a signal for parley ; but they kept 
crowding after us till they came within shot, when we 
took in our white flag, they having made no answer 
to it, hung out a red flag, and fired at them with a 
shot. Notwithstanding this they came on till they 
were near enough to call to them with a speaking- 
trumpet, which we had on board ; so we called to 
them, and bid them keep off at their peril. 

[ 224 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



It was all one ; they crowded after us, and endeav- 
oured to come under our stern, so to board us on 
our quarter ; upon which, seeing they were resolute 
for mischief, and depended upon the strength that 
followed them, I ordered to bring the ship to, so 
that they lay upon our broadside, when immediately 
we fired five guns at them, one of which had been 
levelled so true as to carry away the stern of the 
hindermost boat, and bring them to the necessity of 
taking down their sail, and running all to the head 
of the boat to keep her from sinking. So she lay 
by, and had enough of it ; but seeing the foremost 
boat crowd on after us, we made ready to fire at her 
in particular. 

While this was doing, one of the three boats that 
was behind, being forwarder than the other two, 
made up to the boat which we had disabled, to re- 
lieve her, and we could afterwards see her take out 
the men. We called again to the foremost boat, and 
offered a truce to parley again, and to know what 
was her business with us, but had no answer : only 
she crowded close under our stern. Upon this our 
gunner, who was a very dexterous fellow, ran out his 
two chase-guns, and fired again at her ; but the 
shot missing, the men in the boat shouted, waved 
their caps, and came on. But the gunner, getting 
quickly ready again, fired among them the second 
time, one shot of which, though it missed the boat 
itself, yet fell in among the men, and we could easily 
see had done a great deal of mischief among them ; 
but we, taking no notice of that, wared the ship again, 
and brought our quarter to bear upon them, and 
firing three guns more, we found the boat was split 
almost to pieces ; in particular, her rudder, and a 
piece of her stern, were shot quite away ; so they 
handed their sail immediately, and were in great 
disorder ; but to complete their misfortune our

gunner let fly two guns at them again ; where he 
hit them we could not tell, but we found the boat 
was sinking, and some of the men already in the 
water. Upon this I immediately manned out our pin- 
nace, which we had kept close by our side, with orders 
to pick up some of the men, if they could, and save 
them from drowning, and immediately to come on 
board with them, because we saw the rest of the 
boats began to come up. Our men in the pinnace 
followed their orders, and took up three men ; one 
of which was just drowning, and it was a good while 
before we could recover him. As soon as they were 
on board we crowded all the sail we could make, and 
stood farther out to sea ; and we found that when 
the other three boats came up to the first two, they 
gave over their chase. \ 

Being thus delivered from a danger, which, though 
I knew not the reason of it, yet seemed to be much 
greater than I apprehended, I took care that we 
would change our course, and not let anyone imagine 
whither we were going ; so we stood out to sea east- 
ward, quite out of the course of all European ships, 
whether they were bound to China, or anywhere else 
within the commerce of the European nations. 

When we were now at sea, we began to consult 
with the two seamen, and inquire first what the 
meaning of all this should be ? and the Dutchman 
let us into the secret of it at once, telling us that the 
fellow that sold us the ship, as we said, was no more 
than a thief that had run away with her. Then he 
told us how the captain, whose name too he told us, 
though I do not remember, was treacherously mur- 
dered by the natives on the coast of Malacca, with 
three of his men ; and that he, this Dutchman and 
four more, got into the woods, where they wandered 
about a great while ; till at length he, in particular, 
in a miraculous manner made his escape, and swam 

[ 226 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



off to a Dutch ship, which sailing near the shore in 
its way from China, had sent their boat on shore for 
fresh water ; that he durst not come to that part of 
the shore where the boat was, but made shift in the 
night to take the water farther off, and the ship's 
boat took him up. 

He then told us that he went to Batavia, where 
two of the seamen belonging to the ship arrived, 
having deserted the rest in their travels ; and gave 
an account that the fellow who had run away with 
the ship sold her at Bengal to a set of pirates, which 
were gone a-cruising in her, and that they had al- 
ready taken an English ship and two Dutch ships, 
very richly laden. 

This latter part we found to concern us directly ; 
and though we knew it to be false, yet, as my part- 
ner said very well, if we had fallen into their hands, 
and they had had such a prepossession against us 
beforehand, it had been in vain for us to have de- 
fended ourselves, or to hope for any good quarter 
at their hands ; and especially considering that our 
accusers had been our judges, and that we could 
have expected nothing from them but what rage 
would have dictated, and an ungoverned passion 
have executed ; and therefore it was his opinion we 
should go directly back to Bengal, from whence we 
came, without putting in at any port whatever, be- 
cause there we could give a good account of our- 
selves, could prove where we were when the ship put 
in, whom we bought her of, and the like ; and which 
was more than all the rest, if we were put to the 
necessity of bringing it before the proper judges, we 
should be sure to have some justice, and not be 
hanged first, and judged afterwards. 

I was some time of my partner's opinion ; but 
after a little more serious thinking, I told him I 
thought it was a very great hazard for us to attempt 

[ W ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



returning to Bengal, for that we were on the wrong 
side of the Straits of Malacca ; and that if the alarm 
was given, we should be sure to be waylaid on every 
side, as well by the Dutch of Batavia, as the English 
elsewhere ; that if we should be taken, as it were run- 
ning away, we should even condemn ourselves, and 
there would want no more evidence to destroy us. I 
also asked the English sailor's opinion, who said he 
was of my mind, and that we should certainly be 
taken. 

This danger a little startled my partner, and all 
the ship's company ; and we immediately resolved to 
go away to the coast of Tonquin, and so on to the 
coast of China ; and pursuing the first design as to 
trade, find some way or other to dispose of the ship, 
and come back in some of the vessels of the country, 
such as we could get. This was approved of as the 
best method for our security ; and accordingly we 
steered away N.N.E., keeping above fifty leagues off 
from the usual course to the eastward. 

This, however, put us to some inconveniences ; for 
first the winds, when we came to the distance from 
the shore, seemed to be more steadily against us, 
blowing almost trade, as we call it, from the east 
and E.N.E., so that we were a long while upon our 
voyage, and we were but ill provided with victuals 
for so long a voyage ; and which was still worse, there 
was some danger that those English and Dutch ships, 
whose boats pursued us, whereof some were bound 
that way, might be got in before us ; and if not, 
some other ship bound to China might have infor- 
mation of us from them, and pursue us with the 
same vigour. 

I must confess I was now very uneasy, and thought 
myself, including the late escape from the longboats, 
to have been in the most dangerous condition that 
ever I was in through all my past life ; for whatever 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



ill circumstances I had been in, I was never pursued 
for a thief before ; nor had I ever done anything that 
merited the name of dishonest or fraudulent, much 
less thievish. I had chiefly been my own enemy ; or, 
as I may rightly say, I had been nobody's enemy but 
my own. But now I was embarrassed in the worst 
condition imaginable ; for though I was perfectly in- 
nocent, I was in no condition to make that innocence 
appear ; and if I had been taken, it had been under 
a supposed guilt of the worst kind, at least a crime 
esteemed so among the people I had to do with. 

This made me very anxious to make an escape, 
though which way to do it I knew not, or what port 
or place we should go to. My partner, seeing me 
thus dejected, though he was the most concerned at 
first, began to encourage me, and describing to me 
the several ports of that coast, told me he would put 
in on the coast of Cochin China, or the bay of Ton- 
quin ; intending to go afterwards to Macao, a town 
once in the possession of the Portuguese, and where 
still a great many European families resided, and par- 
ticularly the missionary priests usually went thither, 
in order to their going forward to China. 

Hither then we resolved to go ; and accordingly, 
though after a tedious and irregular course, and very 
much straitened for provisions, we came within sight 
of the coast very early in the morning ; and upon 
reflection upon the past circumstances we were in, 
and the danger, if we had not escaped, we resolved 
to put into a small river, which, however, had a 
depth enough of w ater for us, and to see if we could, 
either overland or by the ship's pinnace, come to 
know what ships were in any ports thereabouts. 
This happy step was, indeed, our deliverance ; for 
though we did not immediately see any European 
ships in the bay of Tonquin, yet the next morning 
there came into the bay two Dutch ships, and a 

[ 229 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



third without any colours spread out, but which we 
believed to be a Dutchman, passed by at about two 
leagues - ' distance, steering for the coast of China; 
and in the afternoon went by two English ships, 
steering the same course ; and thus we thought we 
saw ourselves beset with enemies, both one way or 
other. The place we were in was wild and barbar- 
ous, the people thieves, even by occupation or pro- 
fession ; and though, it is true, we had not much to 
seek of them, and except getting a few provisions, 
cared not how little we had to do with them, yet it 
was with much difficulty that we kept ourselves 
from being insulted by them several ways. 

We were in a small river of this country, within a 
few leagues of its utmost limits northward, and by 
our boat we coasted north-east to the point of land 
which opens the great bay of Tonquin ; and it was 
in this beating up along the shore that we dis- 
covered as above, that in a word, we were surrounded 
with enemies. The people we were among were the 
most barbarous of all the inhabitants of the coast, hav- 
ing no correspondence with any other nation, and 
dealing only in fish and oil, and such gross commodi- 
ties ; and it may be particularly seen that they are, 
as I said, the most barbarous of any of the inhabi- 
tants, viz., that among other customs they have this as 
one, viz., that if any vessel have the misfortune to be 
shipwrecked upon the coast, they presently make the 
men all prisoners or slaves ; and it was not long be- 
fore we found a spice of their kindness this way, on 
the occasion following. 

I have observed above that our ship sprung a leak 
at sea, and that we could not find it out ; and however 
it happened that, as I have said, it was stopped unex- 

Eectedly in the happy minute of our being to be seized 
y the Dutch and English ships in the bay of Siam, 
yet as we did not find the ship so perfectly fit and 

[230] 



ROBINSOxN CRUSOE 



sound as we desired, we resolved while we were in 
this place to lay her on shore, take out what heavy 
things we had on board, which were not many, and 
to wash and clean her bottom, and if possible to find 
out where the leaks were. 

Accordingly, having lightened the ship, and 
brought all our guns and other movable things to one 
side, we tried to bring her down, that we might 
come at her bottom ; but on second thoughts we did 
not care to lay her dry on ground, neither could we 
find out a proper place for it. 

The inhabitants, who had never been acquainted 
with such a sight, came wondering down to the shore 
to look at us ; and seeing the ship lie down on one 
side in such a manner, and heeling in towards the 
shore, and not seeing our men, who were at work on 
her bottom with stages and with their boats, on the 
off side, they presently concluded that the ship was 
cast away, and so lay fast on the ground. 

On this supposition they came all about us in two 
or three hours'' time, with ten or twelve large boats, 
having some of them eight, some ten men in a boat, 
intending, no doubt, to have come on board and 
plundered the ship ; and if they had found us there, 
to have carried us away for slaves to their king, or 
whatever they call him, for we knew nothing who was 
their governor. 

When they came up to the ship and began to row 
round her, they discovered us all hard at work on the 
outside of the ship^ bottom and side, washing, and 
graving, and stooping, as every seafaring man knows 
how. 

They stood for awhile gazing at us, and we, who 
were a little surprised, could not imagine what their 
design was ; but being willing to be sure, we took 
this opportunity to get some of us into the ship, and 
others to hand down arms and ammunition to those 

[ 231 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 

that were at work to defend themselves with, if 
there should be occasion ; and it was no more than 
need, for in less than a quarter of an hour's consul- 
tation they agreed, it seems, that the ship was really 
a wreck ; that we were all at work endeavouring to 
save her, or to save our lives by the help of our 
boats ; and when we handed our arms into the 
boats, they concluded by that motion that we were 
endeavouring to save some of our goods. Upon 
this they took it for granted we all belonged to 
them, and away they came down upon our men, as 
if it had been in a line of battle. 

Our men seeing so many of them began to be 
frighted, for we lay but in an ill posture to fight, 
and cried out to us to know what they should do. 
I immediately called to the men who worked upon 
the stage to slip them down and get up the side 
into the ship, and bade those in the boat to row 
round and come on board ; and those few of us who 
were on board worked with all the strength and 
hands we had to bring the ship to rights ; but, how- 
ever, neither the men upon the stage, or those in 
the boats, could do as they were ordered before the 
Cochin Chinese were upon them, and two of their 
boats boarded our longboat, and began to lay hold 
of the men as their prisoners. 

The first man they laid hold of was an English 
seaman, a stout, strong fellow, who having a musket 
in his hand never offered to fire it, but laid it down 
in the boat, like a fool as I thought. But he un- 
derstood his business better than I could teach him ; 
for he grappled the pagan, and dragged him by 
main force out of their own boat into ours, where 
taking him by the two ears he beat his head so 
against the boat's gunnel, that the fellow died in- 
stantly in his hands ; and in the meantime a Dutch- 
man, who stood next, took up the musket, and 

[ 232 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



with the butt-end of it so laid about him, that he 
knocked down five of them who attempted to enter 
the boat. But this was doing little towards resist- 
ing thirty or forty men, who, fearless, because ig- 
norant of their danger, began to throw themselves 
into the longboat, where we had but five men in all 
to defend it. But one accident gave our men a 
complete victory, which deserved our laughter rather 
than anything else, and that was this. 

Our carpenter being preparing to grave the out- 
side of the ship, as well as to pay the seams where 
he had caulked her to stop the leaks, had got two 
kettles just let down into the boat, one filled with 
boiling pitch, and the other with rosin, tallow, and 
oil, and such stuff as the shipwrights use for that 
work ; and the man that attended the carpenter had 
a great iron ladle in his hand, with which he sup- 
plied the men that were at work with that hot stuff. 
Two of the enemy's men entered the boat just where 
this fellow stood, being in the fore-sheets ; he im- 
mediately saluted them with a ladleful of the stuff, 
boiling hot, which so burnt and scalded them, being 
half naked, that they roared out like two bulls, and 
enraged with the fire, leaped both into the sea. 
The carpenter saw it, and cried out, "Well done, 
Jack, give them some more of it;" and stepping 
forward himself takes one of their mops, and dip- 
ping it in the pitch-pot, he and his man threw it 
among them so plentifully, that, in short, of all the 
men in the three boats there was not one that was 
not scalded and burnt with it in a most frightful 
and pitiful manner, and made such a howling and 
crying, that I never heard a worse noise, and, in- 
deed, nothing like it ; for it is worth observing, that 
though pain naturally makes all people cry out, 
yet every nation has a particular way of exclama- 
tion, and making noises as different from one another 

[ 233 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



as their speech. I cannot give the noise these 
creatures made a better name than howling, nor a 
name more proper to the tone of it ; for I never 
heard anything more like the noise of the wolves 
which, as I have said, I heard howl in the forest 
on the frontiers of Languedoc. 

I was never pleased with a victory better in my 
life ; not only as it was a perfect surprise to me, and 
that our danger was imminent before ; but as we got 
this victory without any bloodshed, except of that man 
the fellow killed with his naked hands, and which I 
was very much concerned at ; for I was sick of kill- 
ing such poor savage wretches, even though it was in 
my own defence, knowing they came on errands 
which they thought just, and knew no better ; and 
that though it may be a just thing, because neces- 
sary, for there is no necessary wickedness in nature ; 
yet I thought it was a sad life in which we must be 
always obliged to be killing our fellow-creatures to 
preserve our own, and, indeed, I think so still, and I 
would, even now, suffer a great deal rather than I 
would take away the life even of the person injuring 
me ; and I believe all considering people, who know 
the value of life, would be of my opinion, at least 
they would if they entered seriously into the consid- 
eration of it. 

But to return to my story. All the while this 
was doing, my partner and I, who managed the rest 
of the men on board, had with great dexterity 
brought the ship almost to rights ; and having got- 
ten the guns into their places again, the gunner 
called to me to bid our boat get out of the way, for 
he would let fly among them. I called back again 
to him, and bid him not offer to fire, for the carpen- 
ter would do the work without him, but bade him 
heat another pitch-kettle, which our cook, who was 
on board, took care of. But the enemy was so ter- 

[234] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



rifled with what they had met with in their first at- 
tack, that they would not come on again ; and some 
of them that were farthest off seeing the ship swim, 
as it were, upright, begun, as we supposed, to see 
their mistake, and give over the enterprise, finding 
it was not as they expected. Thus we got clear of 
this merry fight ; and having gotten some rice and 
some roots and bread, with about sixteen good big 
hogs on board two days before, we resolved to stay 
here no longer, but go forward whatever came of it ; 
for we made no doubt but we should be surrounded 
the next day with rogues enough, perhaps more than 
our pitch-kettle would dispose of for us. 

We therefore got all our things on board the same 
evening, and the next morning were ready to sail. In 
the meantime, lying at an anchor at some distance, we 
were not so much concerned, being now in a fighting 
posture, as well as in a sailing posture, if any enemy 
had presented. The next day, having finished our 
work within board, and finding our ship was per- 
fectly healed of all her leaks, we set sail. We would 
have gone into the bay of Tonquin, for we wanted 
to inform ourselves of what was to be known con- 
cerning the Dutch ships that had been there ; but 
we durst not stand in there, because we had seen 
several ships go in, as we supposed, but a little be- 
fore ; so we kept on N.E. towards the Isle of For- 
mosa, as much afraid of being seen by a Dutch or 
English merchant-ship, as a Dutch or English mer- 
chant-ship in the Mediterranean is of an Algerine 
man-of-war. 

When we were thus got to sea we kept out N.E. 
as if we would go to the Manillas or the Philippine 
Islands, and this we did that we might not fall into 
the way of any of our European ships ; and then we 
steered north till we came to the latitude of 22 
degrees 30 minutes, by which means we made the 

[ 235 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



island of Formosa directly, where we came to an 
anchor in order to get water and fresh provisions, 
which the people there, who are very courteous and 
civil in their manners, supplied us with willingly, 
and dealt very fairly and punctually with us in all 
their agreements and bargains ; which is what we 
did not find among other people, and may be owing 
to the remains of Christianity, which was once 
planted here by a Dutch missionary of Protestants, 
and is a testimony of what I have often observed, 
viz., that the Christian religion always civilises the 
people and reforms their manners, where it is received, 
whether it works saving effects upon them or no. 

From hence we sailed still north, keeping the coast 
of China at an equal distance, till we knew we were 
beyond all the ports of China where our European 
ships usually come ; being resolved, if possible, not 
to fall into any of their hands, especially in this 
country, where, as our circumstances were, we could 
not fail of being entirely ruined ; nay, so great 
was my fear in particular as to my being taken 
by them, that I believe firmly I would much rather 
have chosen to fall into the hands of the Spanish 
Inquisition. 

Being now come to the latitude of 30 degrees, we 
resolved to put into the first trading port we should 
come at, and standing in for the shore a boat came 
off two leagues to us, with an old Portuguese pilot 
on board, who, knowing us to be an European ship, 
came to offer his service, which indeed we were very 
glad of, and took him on board ; upon which, with- 
out asking us whither we would go, he dismissed the 
boat he came in, and sent them back. 

I thought it was now so much in our choice to 
make the old man carry us whither we would, that 
I began to talk with him about carrying us to the 
Gulf of Nanking, which is the most northern part of 

[ 236 1 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



the coast of China. The old man said he knew the 
Gulf of Nanking very well; but smiling, asked us 
what we would do there ? 

I told him we would sell our cargo, and purchase 
China wares, calicoes, raw silks, tea, wrought silks, 
&c, and so would return by the same course we 
came. He told us our best port had been to have 
put in at Macao, where we could not have failed of 
a market for our opium to our satisfaction, and might, 
for our money, have purchased all sorts of China goods 
as cheap as we could at Nanking. 

Not being able to put the old man out of his talk, 
of which he was very opinionated, or conceited, I told 
him we were gentlemen as well as merchants, and 
that we had a mind to go and see the great city of 
Peking, and the famous court of the monarch of 
China. " Why then," says the old man, " you should 
go to Ningpo, where, by the river which runs into 
the sea there, you may go up within five leagues of 
the great canal. This canal is a navigable river, 
which goes through the heart of all that vast empire 
of China, crosses all the rivers, passes some consider- 
able hills by the help of sluices and gates, and goes 
up to the city of Peking, being in length near two 
hundred and seventy leagues. 1 ' 

" Well," said I, " Seignior Portuguese, but that is 
not our business now ; the great question is, if you 
can carry us up to the city of Nanking, from whence 
we can travel to Peking afterwards ? w Yes, he said 
he could do so very well, and that there was a great 
Dutch ship gone by that way just before. This gave 
me a little shock ; a Dutch ship was now our terror, 
and we had much rather have met the devil, at least 
if he had not come in too frightful a figure, and we 
depended upon it that a Dutch ship would be our 
destruction, for we were in no condition to fight them, 
all the ships they trade with into those parts being 

[237] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



of great burden, and of much greater force than we 

were. 

The old man found me a little confused and under 
some concern when he named a Dutch ship, and said 
to me, " Sir, you need be under no apprehensions of 
the Dutch ; I suppose they are not now at war with 
your nation ?" — " No," says I, " that 's true ; but I 
know not what liberties men may take when they arc 
out of the reach of the law.'" — " Why," says he, 
" you are no pirates, what need you fear ? They 
will not meddle with peaceable merchants, sure.' 1 

If I had any blood in my body that did not fly up 
into my face at that word, it was hindered by sonic 
stop in the vessels appointed by Nature to prevent 
it ; for it put me into the greatest disorder and con- 
fusion imaginable ; nor was it possible for me to con- 
ceal it so but that the old man easily perceived it. 

" Sir," says he, " I find you are in some disorder 
in your thoughts at my talk ; pray be pleased to go 
which way you think fit, and depend upon it I '11 do 
you all the service I can." — " Why, seignior," said 
I, u it is true I am a little unsettled in my resolu- 
tion at this time whither to go in particular, and I 
am something more so for what you said about 
pirates. I hope there are no pirates in these seas ; 
we are but in an ill condition to meet with them, for 
you see we have but a small force, and but very 
weakly manned." 

" Oh sir," says he, " do not be concerned ; I do not 
know that there has been any pirates in these seas 
these fifteen years, except one, which was seen, as I 
hear, in the bay of Siam, about a month since; but 
you may be assured she is gone to the southward ; 
nor was she a ship of any great force, or fit for the 
work ; she was not built for a privateer, but was run 
away with by a reprobate crew that were on board, 
after the captain and some of his men had been mur- 

[ 238 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



dered by the Malayans at or near the island of 
Sumatra." 

" What ! w said I, seeming to know nothing of the 
matter, " did they murder the captain ? V — " No," 
said he, " I do not understand that they murdered 
him ; but as they afterwards ran away with the ship, 
it is generally believed they betrayed him into the 
hands of the Malayans, who did murder him, and, 
perhaps, they procured them to do it."" — " Why 
then," said I, "they deserve death as much as if 
they had done it themselves." — " Nay," says the old 
man, " they do deserve it, and they will certainly 
have it if they light upon any English or Dutch ship, 
for they have all agreed together that if they meet 
that rogue they will give him no quarter." 

" But," said I to him, 66 you say the pirate is gone 
out of those seas ; how can they meet with him ?" 
— " Why, that is true," says he, " they do say so ; 
but he was, as I tell you, in the bay of Siam, in the 
river Cambodia, and was discovered there by some 
Dutchmen who belonged to the ship, and who were 
left on shore when they ran away with her ; and 
some English and Dutch traders being in the river, 
they were within a little of taking him. Nay," said 
he, " if the foremost boats had been well seconded 
by the rest, they had certainly taken him ; but he 
finding only two boats within reach of him, tacked 
about, and fired at these two, and disabled them be- 
fore the others came up ; and then standing off to 
sea, the others were not able to follow him, and so 
he got away. But they have all so exact a descrip- 
tion of the ship, that they will be sure to know him ; 
and wherever they find him, they have vowed to give 
no quarter to either the captain or the seamen, but 
to hang them all up at the yardarm." 

" What ! " says I, " will they execute them, right 
or wrong; hang them first, and judge them af'ter- 

[ 239 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 

wards ? " — a Oh, sir," says the old pilot, " there 's 
no need to make a formal business of it with such 
rogues as those ; let them tie them back to back, 
and set them a-diving; it is no more than they 
richly deserve." 

I knew I had my old man fast aboard, and that he 
could do me no harm, so that I turned short upon 
him. " Well now, seignior,' 1 said I, " and this is the 
very reason why I would have you carry us up to 
Nanking, and not to put back to Macao, or to any 
other part of the country where the English or 
Dutch ships come ; for be it known to you, seignior, 
those captains of the English and Dutch ships are a 
parcel of rash, proud, insolent fellows, that neither 
know what belongs to justice, or how to behave 
themselves as the laws of God and Nature direct; 
but being proud of their offices, and not understand- 
ing their power, they would act the murderers to 
punish robbers ; would take upon them to insult 
men falsely accused, and determine them guilty 
without due inquiry, and perhaps I may live to 
call some of them to an account for it, where they 
may be taught how justice is to be executed, and 
that no man ought to be treated as a criminal till 
some evidence may be had of the crime, and that he 
is the man." 

With this I told him that this was the very ship 
they attacked, and gave him a full account of the 
skirmish we had with their boats, and how foolishly 
and coward-like they behaved. I told him all the 
story of our buying the ship, and how the Dutch- 
men served us. I told him the reasons I had to 
believe that this story of killing the master by the 
Malayans was not true, as also the running away 
with the ship ; but that it was all a fiction of their 
own to suggest that the men were turned pirates ; 
and they ought to have been sure it was so before

they had ventured to attack us by surprise, and 
oblige us to resist them ; adding, that they would 
have the blood of those men whom we killed there 
in our just defence to answer for. 

The old man was amazed at this relation, and told 
us we were very much in the right to go away to the 
north, and that if he might advise us, it should be 
to sell the ship in China, which we might very well 
do, and buy or build another in the country ; " and," 
said he, " though you will not get so good a ship, yet 
you may get one able enough to carry you and all 
your goods back again to Bengal, or anywhere else.'" 

I told him I would take his advice when I came to 
any port where I could find a ship for my turn, or 
get any customer to buy this. He replied, I should 
meet with customers enough for the ship at Nan- 
king, and that a Chinese junk would serve me very 
well to go back again ; and that he would procure 
me people both to buy one and sell the other. 

" Well, but, seignior,'" says I, 66 as you say they 
know the ship so well, I may, perhaps, if I follow 
your measures, be instrumental to bring some honest 
innocent man into a terrible broil, and perhaps to be 
murdered in cold blood ; for wherever they find the 
ship they will prove the guilt upon the men by prov- 
ing this was the ship, and so innocent men may 
probably be overpowered and murdered.' 11 — " Why," 
says the old man, " I will find out a way to prevent 
that also ; for as I know all those commanders you 
speak of very well, and shall see them all as they 
pass by, I will be sure to set them to rights in the 
thing, and let them know that they had been so 
much in the wrong, that though the people who 
were on board at first might run away with the ship, 
yet it was not true that they had turned pirates ; 
and that in particular these were not the men that 
first went off with the ship, but innocently bought

her for their trade ; and I am persuaded they will so 
far believe me as at least to act more cautiously for 
the time to come. 11 — " Well,' 1 says I, " and will you 
deliver one message to them from me ? " — " Yes, I 
will," says he, " if you will give it under your hand 
in writing, that I may be able to prove that it came 
from you, and not out of my own head." I answered 
that I would readily give it him under my hand ; so 
I took a pen and ink and paper, and wrote at large 
the story of assaulting me with the longboats, &c, 
the pretended reason of it, and the unjust cruel 
design of it, and concluded to the commanders that 
they had done what they not only should have been 
ashamed of, but also that if ever they came to Eng- 
land, and I lived to see them there, they should all 
pay dearly for it if the laws of my country were not 
grown out of use before I arrived there. 

My old pilot read this over and over again, and 
asked me several times if I would stand to it. I 
answered, I would stand to it as long as I had any- 
tiling left in the world, being sensible that I should 
one time or other find an opportunity to put it 
home to them. But we had no occasion ever to Let 
the pilot carry this letter, for he never went back 
again. While those things were passing between us 
by way of discourse, we went forward directly for 
Nanking, and in about thirteen days' sail came to an 
anchor at the south-west point of the great gulf of 
Nanking ; where, by the way, I came by accident to 
understand that two Dutch ships were gone the 
length before me, and that I should certainly fall 
into their hands. I consulted my partner again in 
this exigency, and he was as much at a loss as I was, 
and would very gladly have been safe on shore al- 
most anywhere. However, I was not in such per- 
plexity neither, but I asked the old pilot if there 
was no creek or harbour which I might put into, 

[ 242] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



and pursue my business with the Chinese privately, 
and be in no danger of the enemy. He told me if 
I would sail to the southward about two and forty 
leagues there was a little port called Quinchang, 
where the fathers of the mission usually landed from 
Macao on their progress to teach the Christian 
religion to the Chinese, and where no European 
ships ever put in ; and if I thought to put in there, 
I might consider what farther course to take when I 
was ashore. He confessed, he said, it was not a 
place for merchants, except that at some certain 
times they had a kind of a fair there, when the 
merchants from Japan came over to buy the Chinese 
merchandises. 

We all agreed to go back to this place ; the name 
of the port, as he called it, I may, perhaps, spell 
wrong, for I do not particularly remember it, hav- 
ing lost this together with the names of many other 
places set down in a little pocket-book, which was 
spoiled by the water, on an accident, which I shall 
relate in its order ; but this I remember, that the 
Chinese or Japanese merchants we corresponded with 
called it by a differing name from that which our 
Portuguese pilot gave it, and pronounced it, as 
above, Quinchang. 

As we were unanimous in our resolutions to go to 
this place, we weighed the next day, having only 
gone twice ashore, where we were to get fresh water ; 
on both which occasions the people of the country 
were very civil to us, and brought us abundance of 
things to sell to us ; I mean of provisions, plants, 
roots, tea, rice, and some fowls ; but nothing with- 
out money. 

We came to the other port (the wind being con- 
trary) not till five days ; but it was very much to 
our satisfaction, and I was joyful, and I may say 
thankful, when I set my foot safe on shore, resolv- 

[ 243 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 

ing, and my partner too, that if it was possible to 
dispose of ourselves and effects any other way, 
though not every way to our satisfaction, we would 
never set one foot on board that unhappy vessel 
more ; and indeed I must acknowledge, that of all 
the circumstances of life that ever I had any ex- 
perience of, nothing makes mankind so completely 
miserable as that of being in constant fear. Well 
does the Scripture say, "The fear of man brings a 
snare;" it is a life of death, and the mind is so 
entirely suppressed by it, that it is capable of no 
relief; the animal spirits sink, and all the vigour 
of nature, which usually supports men under other 
afflictions, and is present to them in the greatest 
exigencies, falls them here. 

Nor did it fail of its usual operations upon the 
fancy by heightening every danger, representing the 
English and Dutch captains to be men incapable of 
hearing reason, or of distinguishing between honest 
men and rogues ; or between a story calculated for 
our own turn, made out of nothing, on purpose to 
deceive, and a true genuine account of our whole 
voyage, progress, and design ; for we might many 
ways have convinced any reasonable creature that we 
were not pirates ; the goods we had on board, the 
course we steered, our frankly showing ourselves, 
and entering into such and such ports ; and even 
our very manner, the force we had, the number of 
men, the few arms, little ammunition, short provis- 
ions ; all these would have served to convince any 
men that we were no pirates. The opium and other 
goods we had on board would make it appear the 
ship had been at Bengal ; the Dutchmen, who, it 
was said, had the names of all the men that were in 
the ship, might easily see that we were a mixture of 
English, Portuguese, and Indians, and but two 
Dutchmen on board. These, and many other par- 

[ 244 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



ticular circumstances, might have made it evident 
to the understanding of any commander, whose 
hands we might fall into, that we were no pirates. 

But fear, that blind useless passion, worked an- 
other way, and threw us into the vapours ; it be- 
wildered our understandings, and set the imagination 
at work to form a thousand terrible things that, 
perhaps, might never happen. We first supposed, 
as indeed everybody had related to us, that the sea- 
men on board the English and Dutch ships, but es- 
pecially the Dutch, were so enraged at the name of 
a pirate, and especially at our beating off their boats 
and escaping, that they would not give themselves 
leave to inquire whether we were pirates or no, but 
would execute us offhand, as we call it, without giv- 
ing us any room for a defence. We reflected that 
there was really so much apparent evidence before 
them, that they would scarce inquire after any more ; 
as first, that the ship was certainly the same, and 
that some of the seamen among them knew her, and 
had been on board her ; and secondly, that when we 
had intelligence at the river of Cambodia that they 
were coming down to examine us, we fought their 
boats and fled ; so that we made no doubt but they 
were fully satisfied of our being pirates, as we were 
satisfied of the contrary ; and as I often said, I know 
not but I should have been apt to have taken those 
circumstances for evidence if the tables were turned, 
and my case was theirs, and have made no scruple of 
cutting all the crew to pieces, without believing, or 
perhaps considering, what they might have to offer 
in their defence. 

But let that be how it will, those were our appre- 
hensions ; and both my partner and I too scarce 
slept a night without dreaming of halters and yard- 
arms, that is to say, gibbets ; of fighting, and being 
taken ; of killing, and being killed ; and one night I 

[ 245 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



was in such a fury in my dream, fancying the Dutch- 
men had boarded us, and I was knocking one of their 
seamen down, that I struck my double fist against 
the side of the cabin I lay in with such a force as 
wounded my hand most grievously, broke my knuck- 
les, and cut and bruised the flesh, so that it not 
only waked me out of my sleep, but I was once 
afraid I should have lost two of my fingers. 

Another apprehension I had was, of the cruel 
usage we might meet with from them if we fell into 
their hands ; then the story of Amboyna came into 
my head, and how the Dutch might, perhaps, torture 
us, as they did our countrymen there ; and make 
some of the men, by extremity of torture, confess 
those crimes they never were guilty of; own them- 
selves, and all of us, to be pirates; and so they would 
put us to death, with a formal appearance of justice ; 
and that they might be tempted to do this for the 
gain of our ship and cargo, which was worth four or 
five thousand pounds, put all together. 

These things tormented me, and my partner too, 
night and day ; nor did we consider that the captains 
of ships have no authority to act thus ; and if we had 
surrended prisoners to them, they could not answer 
the destroying us, or torturing us, but would be 
accountable for it when they came into their own 
country. This, I say, gave me no satisfact ion ; for 
if they will act thus with us, what advantage would 
it be to us that they would be called to an account 
for it ; or if we were first to be murdered, what satis- 
faction would it be to us to have them punished 
when they came home ? 

I cannot refrain taking notice here what reflections 
I now had upon the past variety of my particular 
circumstances ; how hard I thought it was that I, 
who had spent forty years in a life of continued diffi- 
culties, and was at last come, as it were, to the port 

[ 246 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



or haven which all men drive at, viz., to have rest 
and plenty, should be a volunteer in new sorrows by 
my own unhappy choice ; and that I, who escaped so 
many dangers in my youth, should now come to be 
hanged in my old age, and in so remote a place, for 
a crime I was not in the least inclined to, much less 
really guilty of ; and in a place and circumstance, 
where innocence was not like to be any protection at 
all to me. 

After these thoughts, something of religion would 
come in ; and I would be considering that this seemed 
to me to be a disposition of immediate Providence, 
and I ought to look upon it, and submit to it, as 
such ; that although I was innocent as to men, I was 
far from being innocent as to my Maker ; and I 
ought to look in and examine what other crimes in 
my life were more obvious to me, and for which 
Providence might justly inflict this punishment as a 
retribution ; and that I ought to submit to this, just 
as I would to a shipwreck, if it had pleased God to 
have brought such a disaster upon me. 

In its turn, natural courage would sometimes take 
its place, and then I would be talking myself up to 
vigorous resolutions, that I would not be taken to be 
barbarously used by a parcel of merciless wretches in 
cold blood ; that it were much better to have fallen 
into the hands of the savages, who were men-eaters, 
and who, I was sure, would feast upon me when they 
had taken me, than by those who would perhaps glut 
their rage upon me by inhuman tortures and bar- 
barities ; that in the case of the savages I always 
resolved to die fighting to the last gasp ; and why 
should I not do so, seeing it was much more dread- 
ful, to me at least, to think of falling into these men's 
hands, than ever it was to think of being eaten by 
men ? for the savages, give them their due, would 
not eat a man till he was dead, and killed him first, 

[ 247 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



as we do a bullock ; but that these men had many 
arts beyond the cruelty of death. Whenever these 
thoughts prevailed, I was sure to put myself in a 
kind of fever with the agitations of a supposed fight ; 
my blood would boil, and my eyes sparkle, as if I 
was engaged ; and I always resolved that I would 
take no quarter at their hands ; but even at last, if I 
could resist no longer, I would blow up the ship, 
and all that was in her, and leave them but little 
booty to boast of. 

By how much the greater weight the anxieties 
and perplexities of these things were to our thoughts 
while we were at sea, by so much the greater was our 
satisfaction when we saw ourselves on shore ; and my 
partner told me he dreamed that he had a very heavy 
load upon his back, which he was to carry up a hill, 
and found that he was not able to stand long under 
it, but that the Portuguese pilot came and took it 
off his back, and the hill disappeared, the ground 
before him showing all smooth and plain ; and truly 
it was so ; we were all like men who had a load taken 
off their backs. 

For my part, I had a weight taken off from my 
heart that I was not able any longer to bear ; ana, 
as I said above, we resolved to go no more to sea in 
that ship. When we came on shore the old pilot, 
who was now our friend, got us a lodging, and a 
warehouse for our goods, which, by the way, was 
much the same. It was a little house, or hut, with 
a large house joining to it, all built with canes, and 
palisadoed round with large canes to keep out pil- 
fering thieves, of which, it seems, there were not a few 
in that country. However, the magistrates allowed 
us also a little guard, and we had a sentinel with a 
kind of halberd, or half pike, who stood sentinel at 
our door, to whom we allowed a pint of rice and 
a little piece of money, about the value of three- 

[ 248 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 

pence, per day ; so that our goods were kept very 
safe. 

The fair or mart usually kept in this place had 
been over some time ; however, we found that there 
were three or four junks in the river, and two 
Japanners (I mean ships from Japan), with goods 
which they had bought in China, and were not gone 
away, having Japanese merchants on shore. 

The first thing our old Portuguese pilot did for us 
was to bring us acquainted with three missionary Rom- 
ish priests who were in the town, and who had been 
there some time converting the people to Christian- 
ity ; but we thought they made but poor work of it, 
and made them but sorry Christians when they had 
done. However, that was none of our business. 
One of these was a Frenchman, whom they called 
Father Simon. He was a jolly, well-conditioned 
man, very free in his conversation, not seeming so 
.serious and grave as the other two did, one of whom 
was a Portuguese, and the other a Genoese ; but 
Father Simon was courteous, easy in his manner, 
and very agreeable company ; the other two were 
more reserved, seemed rigid and austere, and applied 
seriously to the work that came about, viz., to talk 
with, and insinuate themselves among, the inhab- 
itants wherever they had opportunity. We often ate 
and drank with those men ; and though I must con- 
fess the conversion, as they call it, of the Chinese to 
Christianity is so far from the true conversion re- 
quired to bring heathen people to the faith of 
Christ, that it seems to amount to little more than 
letting them know the name of Christ, and say 
some prayers to the Virgin Mary and her Son in a 
tongue which they understand not, and to cross 
themselves and the like ; yet it must be confessed 
that these religious, whom we call missionaries, have 
a firm belief that these people shall be saved, and 

[249] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



that they are the instruments of it; and on this 
account they undergo not only the fatigue of the 
voyage, and hazards of living in such places, but 
oftentimes death itself, with the most violent tor- 
tures, for the sake of this work ; and it would be a 
great want of charity in us, whatever opinion we 
have of the work itself, and the manner of their 
doing it, if we should not have a good opinion of 
their zeal, who undertook it with so many hazards, 
and who have no prospect of the least temporal 
advantage to themselves. 

But to return to my story. This French priest, 
Father Simon, was appointed, it seems, by order of 
the chief of the mission to go up to Peking, the 
royal seat of the Chinese emperor, and waited only 
for another priest, who was ordered to come to him 
from Macao to go along with him ; and we scarce 
ever met together but he was inviting me to go that 
journey, telling me how he would show me all the 
glorious things of that mighty empire, and among 
the rest the greatest city in the world ; a city, said 
he, that your London and our Paris, put together, 
cannot be equal to. This was the city of Peking, 
which, I confess, is very great, and infinitely full of 
people ; but as I looked on those things with differ- 
ent eyes from other men, so I shall give my opinion 
of them in few words when I come in the course of 
my travels to speak more particularly of them. 

But first I come to my friar or missionary. Dining 
with him one day, and being very merry together, I 
showed some little inclination to go with him ; and 
he pressed me and my partner very hard, and with a 
great many persuasions, to consent. " Why, Father 
Simon," says my partner, " why should you desire 
our company so much ? You know we are heretics, 
and you do not love us, nor cannot keep us company 
with any pleasure." — "Oh!" says he, "you may, 

[ 250 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



perhaps, be good Catholics in time ; my business 
here is to convert heathens, and who knows but I 
may convert you too? 11 — "Very well, father, 11 said 
I, " so you will preach to us all the way. 11 — "I 
won't be troublesome to you, 11 says he ; " our religion 
does not divest us of good manners ; besides, 11 says 
he, " we are here like countrymen ; and so we are, 
compared to the place we are in ; and if you are 
Huguenots, and I a Catholic, we may be all Chris- 
tians at last ; at least, 11 said he, u we are all gentle- 
men, and we may converse so without being uneasy 
to one another. 11 I liked that part of his discourse 
very well, and it began to put me in mind of my 
priest that I had left in the Brazils ; but this Father 
Simon did not come up to his character by a great 
deal ; for though Father Simon had no appearance 
of a criminal levity in him neither, yet he had not 
that fund of Christian zeal, strict piety, and sincere 
affection to religion that my other good ecclesiastic 
had, of whom I have said so much. 

But to leave him a little, though he never left us, 
nor soliciting us to go with him, but we had some- 
thing else before us at first ; for we had all this while 
our ship and our merchandise to dispose of ; and we 
began to be very doubtful what we should do, for we 
were now in a place of very little business ; and once 
I was about to venture to sail for the river of Kilam 
and the city of Nanking ; but Providence seemed 
now more visibly, as I thought, than ever to concern 
itself in our affair ; and I was encouraged from this 
very time to think I should, one way or other, get 
out of this tangled circumstance, and be brought 
home to my own country again, though I had not 
the least view of the manner ; and when I began 
sometimes to think of it, could not imagine by what 
method it was to be done ; Providence, I say, began 
here to clear up our way a little ; and the first thing 

[251] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 

that offered was, that our old Portuguese pilot 
brought a Japan merchant to us, who began to in- 
quire what goods we had ; and, in the first place, he 
bought all our opium, and gave us a very good price 
for it, paying us in gold by weight, some in small 
pieces of their own coin, and some in small wedges, 
of about ten or eleven ounces each. While we were 
dealing with him for our opium, it came into my 
head that he might, perhaps, deal with us for the 
ship too ; and I ordered the interpreter to propose 
it to him. He shrunk up his shoulders at it when it 
was first proposed to him ; but in a few days after- 
he came to me, with one of the missionary priests for 
his interpreter, and told me he had a proposal to 
make to me, and that was this : he had bought a 
great quantity of goods of us when he had no 
thoughts, or proposals made to him, of buying the 
ship, and that, therefore, he had not money enough 
to pay for the ship ; but if I would let the same men 
who were in the ship navigate her, he would hire the 
ship to go to Japan, and would send them from thence 
to the Philippine Islands with another loading, which 
he would pay the freight of before they went from 
Japan ; and that, at their return, he would buy the 
ship. I began to listen to his proposal ; and so 
eager did my head still run upon rambling, that I 
could not but begin to entertain a notion of going 
myself with him, and to sail from the Philippine 
Islands away to the South Seas ; and accordingly I 
asked the Japan merchant if he would not hire us 
to the Philippine Islands, and discharge us there. 
He said no, he could not do that, for then he could 
not have the return of his cargo ; but he would dis- 
charge us in Japan, he said, at the ship's return. 
Well, still I was for taking him at that proposal, 
and going myself ; but my partner, wiser than my- 
self, persuaded me from it, representing the dangers 

[ 252 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



as well of the seas as of the Japanese, who are a 
false, cruel, and treacherous people ; and then of the 
Spaniards at the Philippines, more false, more cruel, 
and more treacherous than they. 

But to bring this long turn of our affairs to a con- 
clusion. The first thing we had to do was to consult 
with the captain of the ship and with his men, and 
know if they were willing to go to Japan ; and while 
I was doing this, the young man whom, as I said, my 
nephew had left with me as my companion for my 
travels, came to me, and told me that he thought 
that voyage promised very fair, and that there was a 
great prospect of advantage, and he would be very 
glad if I undertook it ; but that if I would not, and 
would give him leave, he would go as a merchant, or 
how I pleased to order him ; that if ever he came to 
England, and I was there, and alive, he would render 
me a faithful account of his success, and it should be 
as much mine as I pleased. 

I was really loath to part with him ; but consid- 
ering the prospect of advantage, which was really 
considerable, and that he was a young fellow as 
likely to do well in it as any I knew, I inclined to 
let him go ; but first I told him I would consult my 
partner, and give him an answer the next day. My 
partner and I discoursed about it, and my partner 
made a most generous offer. He told me, " You 
know it has been an unlucky ship, and we both re- 
solve not to go to sea in it again ; if your steward (so 
he called my man) will venture the voyage, 1 11 leave 
my share of the vessel to him, and let him make his 
best of it ; and if we live to meet in England, and 
he meets with success abroad, he shall account for 
one-half of the profits of the ship's freight to us, the 
other shall be his own. 1 ' 

If my partner, who was no way concerned with my 
young man, made him such an offer, I could do no 

[ 253 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 

less than offer him the same ; and all the ship's com- 
pany being willing to go with him, we made over 
half the ship to him in property, and took a writing 
from him, obliging him to account for the other ; 
and away he went to Japan. The Japan merchant 

{Moved a very punctual honest man to him, protected 
dm at Japan, and got him a licence to come on 
shore, which the Europeans in general have not 
lately obtained, paid him his freight very punctu- 
ally, sent him to the Philippines, loaded with Japan 
and China wares, and a supercargo of their own, who 
t rafficking with the Spaniards brought back Euro- 
pean goods again, and a great quantity of cloves and 
other spices ; and there he was not only paid his 
freight very well, and at a very good price, but being 
not willing to sell the ship then, the merchant fur- 
nished him with goods on his own account; that for 
some money and some spices of his own, which he 
brought with him, he went back to the Manillas, to 
the Spaniards, where he sold his cargo very well. 
Here having gotten a good acquaintance at Manilla, 
he got his ship made a free ship ; and the governor 
of Manilla hired him to go to Acapulco, in America, 
on the coast of Mexico ; and gave him a licence to 
land there, and travel to Mexico ; and to pass in any 
Spanish ship to Europe, with all his men. 

I [e made the voyage to Acapulco very happily, and 
there he sold his ship ; and having there also ob- 
tained allowance to travel by land to Porto Bello, 
he found means somehow or other to get to Jamaica 
with all his treasure, and about eight years after 
came to England exceeding rich, of the which I 
shall take notice in its place ; in the meantime, I re- 
turn to our particular affairs. 

Being now to part with the ship and ship's com- 
pany, it came before us, of course, to consider what 
recompense we should give to the two men that they 

[ 254 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



gave us such timely notice of the design against us in 
the river of Cambodia. The truth was, that they 
had done us a considerable service, and deserved well 
at our hands, though, by the way, they were a couple 
of rogues too ; for as they believed the story of our 
being pirates, and that we had really run away with 
the ship, they came down to us not only to betray 
the design that was formed against us, but to go to 
sea with us as pirates ; and one of them confessed 
afterwards that nothing else but the hopes of going 
a-roguing brought him to do it. However, the ser- 
vice they did us was not the less ; and therefore, as 
I had promised to be grateful to them, I first ordered 
the money to be paid to them which they said was 
due to them on board their respective ships ; that is 
to say, the Englishman nineteen months' pay, and to 
the Dutchman seven ; and over and above that I 
gave them, each of them, a small sum of money in 
gold, and which contented them very well. Then 
I made the Englishman gunner in the ship, the gun- 
ner being now made second mate and purser ; the 
Dutchman I made boatswain ; so they were both 
very well pleased, and proved very serviceable, being 
both able seamen, and very stout fellows. 

We were now on shore in China. If I thought 
myself banished and remote from my own country at 
Bengal, where I had many ways to get home for my 
money, what could I think of myself now, when I 
was gotten about a thousand leagues farther off from 
home, and perfectly destitute of all manner of pros- 
pect of return ? 

All we had for it was this, that in about four 
months 1 time there was to be another fair at the 
place where we were, and then we might be able to 
purchase all sorts of the manufactures of the country, 
and withal might possibly find some Chinese junks 
or vessels from Tonquin that would be to be sold, 

[ 255 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 

and would carry us and our goods whither we pleased. 
This I liked very well, and resolved to wait ; Tbesides, 
as our particular persons were not obnoxious, so if 
any English or Dutch ships came thither, perhaps 
we might have an opportunity to load our goods, 
and get passage to some other place in India nearer 
home. 

Upon these hopes we resolved to continue here ; 
but to divert ourselves we took two or three journeys 
into the country. First, we went ten days 1 journey 
to see the city of Nanking, a city well worth seeing 
indeed ; they say it has a million of people in it, 
which, however, I do not believe. It is regularly 
built, the streets all exactly straight, and cross one 
another in direct lines, which gives the figure of it 
great advantage. 

But when I come to compare the miserable people 
of these countries with ours, their fabrics, their man- 
ner of living, their government, their religion, their 
wealth, and their glory, as some call it, I must con- 
fess I do not so much as think it is worth naming, 
or worth my while to write of, or any that shall 
come after me to read. 

It is very observable that we wonder at the grand- 
eur, the riches, the pomp, the ceremonies, the gov- 
ernment, the manufactures, the commerce, and the 
conduct of these people ; not that it is to be won- 
dered at, or, indeed, in the least to be regarded ; 
but because, having first a true notion of the barbar- 
ity of those countries, the rudeness and the ignorance 
that prevails there, we do not expect to find any 
such things so far off. 

Otherwise, what are their buildings to the palaces 
and royal buildings of Europe ? What is their 
trade to the universal commerce of England, Hol- 
land, France, and Spain ? What are their cities to 
ours for wealth, strength, gaiety of apparel, rich 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



furniture, and an infinite variety ? What are their 
ports, supplied with a few junks and barks, to our 
navigation, our merchant fleets, our large and pow- 
erful navies ? Our city of London has more trade 
than all their mighty empire. One English, or 
Dutch, or French man-of-war of eighty guns would 
fight and destroy all the shipping of China. But 
the greatness of their wealth, their trade, the power 
of their government, and strength of their armies, is 
surprising to us, because, as I have said, considering 
them as a barbarous nation of pagans, little better 
than savages, we did not expect such things among 
them ; and this, indeed, is the advantage with which 
all their greatness and power is represented to us, 
otherwise it is in itself nothing at all. For as I 
have said of their ships, so may be said of their arm- 
ies and troops ; all the forces of their empire, though 
they were to bring two millions of men into the field 
together, would be able to do nothing but ruin the 
country, and starve themselves. If they were to be- 
siege a strong town in Flanders, or to fight a disci- 
plined army, one line of German cuirassiers, or of 
French cavalry, would overthrow all the horse of 
China ; a million of their foot could not stand before 
one embattled body of our infantry, posted so as not 
to be surrounded, though they were to be not one to 
twenty in number ; nav, I do not boast if I say that 
30,000 German or English foot, and 10,000 French 
horse, would fairly beat all the forces of China. 
And so of our fortified towns, and of the art of our 
engineers, in assaulting and defending towns ; there \s 
not a fortified town in China could hold out one 
month against the batteries and attacks of an Euro- 
pean army ; and at the same time, all the armies in 
China could never take such a town as Dunkirk, 
provided it was not starved ; no, not in ten years'* 
siege. They have firearms, 'tis true, but they are 
vol. n. — 17 [ 257 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 

awkward, clumsy, and uncertain in going off ; they 
have powder, but it is of no strength ; they have 
neither discipline in the field, exercise to their arms, 
skill to attack, or temper to retreat ; and therefore 
I must confess it seemed strange to me when I came 
home and heard our people say such fine things of 
the power, riches, glory, magnificence, and trade of 
the Chinese, because I saw and knew that they were 
a contemptible herd or crowd of ignorant, sordid 
slaves, subjected to a government qualified only to 
rule such a people ; and, in a word, for I am now 
launched quite beside my design, I say, in a word, 
were not its distance inconceivably great from Mus- 
covy, and was not the Muscovite empire almost 
as rude, impotent, and ill-governed a crowd of slaves 
as they, the Czar of Muscovy might, with much ease, 
drive them all out of their country, and conquer 
them in one campaign ; and had the Czar, who I 
since hear is a growing prince, and begins to appear 
formidable in the world, fallen this way instead of 
attacking the warlike Swedes, in which attempt none 
of the powers of Europe would have envied or inter- 
rupted him, he might, by this time, have been Em- 
peror of China, instead of being beaten by the King 
of Sweden at Narva, when the latter was not one to 
six in number. 

As their strength and their grandeur, so their navi- 
gation, commerce, and husbandry is imperfect and 
impotent compared to the same things in Europe. 
Also in their knowledge, their learning, their skill in 
the sciences ; they have globes and spheres, and a 
smatch of the knowledge of the mathematics ; but 
when you come to inquire into their knowledge, how 
short-sighted are the wisest of their students ! They 
know nothing of the motion of the heavenly bodies ; 
and so grossly, absurdly ignorant, that when the 
sun is eclipsed they think 'tis a great dragon has 

[ 258 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



assaulted and run away with it, and they fall a-clat- 
tering with all the drums and kettles in the country 
to fright the monster away, just as we do to hive a 
swarm of bees. 

As this is the only excursion of this kind which 
I have made in all the account I have given of my 
travels, so I shall make no more descriptions of coun- 
tries and people; 'tis none of my business, or any 
part of my design, but giving an account of my own 
adventures, through a life of inimitable wanderings, 
and a long variety of changes, which, perhaps, few 
that come after me will have heard the like of. I 
shall, therefore, say very little of all the mighty 
places, desert countries, and numerous people I have 
yet to pass through, more than relates to my own 
story, and which my concern among them will make 
necessary. I was now, as near as I can compute, in 
the heart of China, about the latitude of thirty de- 
grees north of the line, for we were returned from 
Nanking. I had, indeed, a mind to see the city of 
Peking, which I had heard so much of, and Father 
Simon importuned me daily to do it. At length his 
time of going away being set, and the other mission- 
ary, who was to go with him, being arrived from 
Macao, it was necessary that we should resolve either 
to go, or not to go ; so I referred him to my part- 
ner, and left it wholly to his choice, who at length 
resolved it in the affirmative, and we prepared for 
our journey. 

We set out with very good advantage as to finding 
the way ; for we got leave to travel in the retinue of 
one of their mandarins, a kind of viceroy, or princi- 
pal magistrate, in the province where they reside, 
and who take great state upon them, travelling with 
great attendance, and with great homage from the 
people, who are sometimes greatly impoverished by 
them, because all the countries they pass through 

[ 259 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



are obliged to furnish provisions for them, and all 
their attendance. That which I particularly ob- 
served as to our travelling with his baggage, was 
this, that though we received sufficient provisions, 
both for ourselves and our horses, from the country, 
as belonging to the mandarin, yet we were obliged 
to pay for everything we had after the market-price 
of the country, and the mandarin's steward, or com- 
missary of the provisions, collected it duly from us ; 
so that our travelling in the retinue of the man- 
darin, though it was a very great kindness to us, was 
not such a mighty favour in him, but was, indeed, a 
great advantage to him, considering there were above 
thirty other people travelled in the same manner be- 
sides us, under the protection of his retinue, or, as 
we may call it, under his convoy ; this, I say, was a 
great advantage to him, for the country furnished 
all the provisions for nothing, and he took all our 
money for them. 

We were five and twenty days travelling to 
Peking, through a country infinitely populous, but 
miserably cultivated ; the husbandry, the economy, 
and the way of living miserable, though they boast 
so much of the industry of the people ; I say miser- 
able ; and so it is, if we, who understand how to 
live, were to endure it, or to compare it with our 
own ; but not so to these poor wretches, who know 
no other. The pride of these people is infinitely 
great, and exceeded by nothing but their poverty, 
which adds to that which I call their misery ; and I 
must needs think the naked savages of America live 
much more happy, because, as they have nothing, so 
they desire nothing ; whereas these are proud and 
insolent, and, in the main, are mere beggars and 
drudges ; their ostentation is inexpressible, and is 
chiefly showed in their clothes and buildings, and in 
keeping multitudes of servants or slaves; and which 

[ 260 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



is to the last degree ridiculous, their contempt of all 
the world but themselves. 

I must confess I travelled more pleasantly after- 
wards in the deserts and vast wildernesses of Grand 
Tartary than here ; and yet the roads here are 
well paved and well kept, and very convenient for 
travellers ; but nothing was more awkward to me than 
to see such a haughty, imperious, insolent people in 
the midst of the grossest simplicity and ignorance, for 
all their famed ingenuity is no more ; and my friend 
Father Simon and I used to be very merry upon these 
occasions to see the beggarly pride of those people. 
For example, coming by the house of a country gentle- 
man, as Father Simon called him, about ten leagues 
off of the city of Nanking, we had, first of all, the 
honour to ride with the master of the house about 
two miles ; the state he rode in was a perfect Don 
Quixotism, being a mixture of pomp and poverty. 

The habit of this greasy Don was very proper for 
a scaramouch or merry-andrew, being a dirty calico, 
with all the tawdry and trapping of a fool's coat, 
such as hanging sleeves, tassels, and cuts and slashes 
almost on every side ; it covered a taffeta vest, as 
greasy as a butcher, and which testified that his 
honour must needs be a most exquisite sloven. His 
horse was a poor, lean, starved, hobbling creature, 
such as in England might sell for about thirty or 
forty shillings ; and he had two slaves followed him 
on foot, to drive the poor creature along. He had 
a whip in his hand, and he belaboured the beast as 
fast about the head as his slaves did about the tail ; 
and thus he rode by us with about ten or twelve 
servants ; and we were told he was going from the 
city to his country seat, about half a league before 
us. We travelled on gently, but this figure of a 
gentleman rode away before us, and we stopped at a 
village about an hour to refresh us. 

[ 261 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



When we came by the country seat of this great 
man, we saw him in a little place before his door, 
eating his repast. It was a Kind of a garden, but 
he was easy to be seen ; and we were given to under- 
stand that the more we looked on him, the better 
he would be pleased. He sat under a tree, some- 
thing like the palmetto-tree, which effectually shaded 
him over the head, and on the south side ; but 
under the tree also was placed a large umbrella, 
which made that part look well enough. He sat 
lolling back in a great elbow-chair, being a heavy, 
corpulent man, and his meat being brought him 
by two women slaves. He had two more, whose 
office, I think, few gentlemen in Europe would ac- 
cept of their service in, viz., one fed the squire with 
a spoon, and the other held the dish with one hand, 
and scraped off what he let fall upon his worship's 
beard and taffeta vest ; while the great fat brute 
thought it below him to employ his own hands in 
any of those familiar offices which kings and monarchs 
would rather do than be troubled with the clumsy 
fingers of their servants. 

I took this time to think what pains men's pride 
puts them to, and how troublesome a haughty 
temper, thus ill-managed, must be to a man of 
common-sense ; and leaving the poor wretch to please 
himself with our looking at him, as if we admired 
his pomp, whereas we really pitied and contemned 
him, we pursued our journey ; only Father Simon 
had the curiosity to stay to inform himself what 
dainties the country justice had to feed on in all his 
state ; which he said he had the honour to taste of, 
and which was, I think, a dose that an English 
hound would scarce have eaten if it had been offered 
him, viz., a mess of boiled rice, with a great piece of 
garlic in it, and a little bag filled with green pepper, 
and another plant which they have there, something 

[ 262 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



like our ginger, but smelling like musk, and tasting 
like mustard. All this was put together, and a 
small lump or piece of lean mutton boiled in it ; 
and this was his worship's repast, four or five ser- 
vants more attending at a distance. If he fed them 
meaner than he was fed himself, the spice excepted, 
they must fare very coarsely indeed. 

As for our mandarin with whom we travelled, he 
was respected like a king : surrounded always with 
his gentlemen, and attended in all his appearances 
with such pomp, that I saw little of him but at a 
distance ; but this I observed, that there was not a 
horse in his retinue but that our carriers' 1 pack-horses 
in England seem to me to look much better ; but 
they were so covered with equipage, mantles, trap- 
pings, and such like trumpery, that you cannot see 
whether they are fat or lean ; in a word, we could 
see scarce anything but their feet and their heads. 

I was now light-hearted, and all my trouble and 
perplexity that I had given an account of being 
over, I had no anxious thoughts about me, which 
made this journey the pleasanter to me ; nor had I 
any ill accident attended me, only in the passing or 
fording a small river my horse fell, and made me 
free of the country, as they call it ; that is to say, 
threw me in. The place was not deep, but it wetted 
me all over. I mention it, because it spoiled my 
pocket-book, wherein I had set down the names of 
several people and places which I had occasion to 
remember, and which, not taking due care of, the 
leaves rotted, and the words were never after to be 
read, to my great loss as to the names of some places 
I touched at in this voyage. 

At length we arrived at Peking. I had nobody 
with me but the youth, whom my nephew, the cap- 
tain, had given me to attend me as a servant, and 
who proved very trusty and diligent ; and my part- 

[263] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



ner had nobody with him but one servant, who was 
a kinsman. As for the Portuguese pilot, he being 
desirous to see the court, we gave him his passage, 
that is to say, bore his charges for his company, and 
to use him as an interpreter, for he understood the 
language of the country, and spoke good French and 
a little English ; and, indeed, this old man was a 
most useful implement to us everywhere; for we had 
not been above a week at Peking, when he came 
laughing. " Ah, seignior Inglese," says he, " I have 
something to tell you will make your heart glad." — 
" My heart glad," says I, " what can that be ? I 
don't know anything in this country can either give 
me joy or grief, to any great degree." — " Yes, yes,' 1 
said the old man in broken English, " make you 
glad, me sorrow ; " sorry, he would have said. This 
made me more inquisitive. " Why," said I, "will 
it make you sorry ? " — " Because," said he, " you 
have brought me here twenty-five days 1 journey, and 
will leave me to go back alone ; and which way shall 
I get to my port afterwards, without a ship, without, 
a bone, without pecune ?" so he called money ; being 
his broken Latin, of which he had abundance to 
make us merry with. 

In short, he told us there was a great caravan of 
Muscovite and Polish merchants in the city, and 
they were preparing to set out on their journey, by 
land, to Muscovy within four or five weeks, and he 
\\as sure we would take the opportunity to go with 
them, and leave him behind to go back all alone. I 
confess I was surprised with his news. A secrel joy 
spread itself over my whole soul, which I cannot 
describe, and never felt before or since ; and I had 
no power, for a good while, to speak a word to the 
old man ; but at last I turned to him. " How do 
you know this? 11 said I ; "are you sure it is true?" 
— "Yes," says he, " I met this morning in the street 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



an old acquaintance of mine, an Armenian, or one 
you call a Grecian, who is among them ; he came 
last from Astrakhan, and was designing to go to 
Tonquin, where I formerly knew him, but has altered 
his mind, and is now resolved to go with the caravan 
to Moscow, and so down the river Volga to Astrakhan." 
— " Well, seignior ," says I, " do not be uneasy about 
being left to go back alone. If this be a method for 
my return to England, it shall be your fault if you 
go back to Macao at all." We then went to con- 
sulting together what was to be done, and I asked 
my partner what he thought of the pilot's news, and 
whether it would suit with his affairs. He told me 
he would do just as I would ; for he had settled all 
his affairs so well at Bengal, and left his effects in 
such good hands, that as we had made a good voy- 
age here, if he could vest it in China silks, wrought 
and raw, such as might be worth the carriage, 
he would be content to go to England, and then 
make his voyage back to Bengal by the Company's 
ships. 

Having resolved upon this, we agreed that if our 
Portugal pilot would go with us we would bear his 
charges to Moscow, or to England if he pleased ; 
nor, indeed, were we to be esteemed over-generous 
in that part neither, if we had not rewarded him 
farther ; for the service he had done us was really 
worth all that, and more ; for he had not only been 
a pilot to us at sea, but he had been like a broker 
for us on shore; and his procuring for us the Japan 
merchant was some hundred of pounds in our pocket. 
So we consulted together about it ; and being willing 
to gratify him, which was indeed but doing him jus- 
tice, and very willing also to have him with us besides, 
for he was a most necessary man on all occasions, we 
agreed to give him a quantity of coined gold, which, 
as I compute it, came to about ^175 sterling between 

[ 265 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



us, and to bear all his charges, both for himself and 
horse, except only a horse to carry his goods. 

Having settled this among ourselves, we called him 
to let him know what we had resolved. I told him 
he had complained of our being to let him go back 
alone, and I was now to tell him we were resolved he 
should not go back at all ; that as we had resolved 
to go to Europe with the caravan, we resolved also 
he should go with us, and that we called him to know 
his mind. He shook his head, and said it was a long 
journey, and he had no pecune to carry him thither, 
or to subsist himself when he came there. We told 
him we believed it was so, and therefore we had 
resolved to do something for him that should let 
him see how sensible we were of the service he had 
done us, and also how agreeable he was to us ; and 
then I told him what we had resolved to give him 
here, which he might lay out as we would do our 
own ; and that as for his charges, if he would go 
with us, we would set him safe ashore, life and 
casualties excepted, either in Muscovy or England, 
which he would, at our own charge, except only the 
carriage of his goods. 

He received the proposal like a man transported, 
and told us he would go with us over the whole 
world ; and so, in short, we all prepared ourselves 
for the journey. However, as it was with us, so it 
was with the other merchants ; they had many 
things to do, and instead of being ready in five 
weeks, it was four months and some odd days before 
all things were got together. 

It was the beginning of February, our style, when 
we set out from Peking. My partner and the old 
pilot had gone express back to the port where we 
had first put in, to dispose of some goods which we 
had left there ; and I, with a Chinese merchant, 
whom I had some knowledge of at Nanking, and 

[266 J 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



who came to Peking on his own affairs, went to 
Nanking, where I bought ninety pieces of fine 
damasks, with about two hundred pieces of other 
very fine silks, of several sorts, some mixed with 
gold, and had all these brought to Peking against 
my partner's return. Besides this, we bought a 
very large quantity of raw silk, and some other 
goods ; our cargo amounting, in these goods only, 
to about three thousand five hundred pounds ster- 
ling, which, together with tea, and some fine calicoes, 
and three camels' 1 loads of nutmegs and cloves, loaded 
in all eighteen camels for our share, besides those we 
rode upon ; which, with two or three spare horses, 
and two horses loaded with provisions, made us, in 
short, twenty-six camels and horses in our retinue. 

The company was very great, and, as near as I 
can remember, made between three and four hundred 
horse, and upwards of a hundred and twenty men, 
very well armed, and provided for all events ; for, as 
the eastern caravans are subjected to be attacked 
by the Arabs, so are these by the Tartars ; but they 
are not altogether so dangerous as the Arabs, nor 
so barbarous when they prevail. 

The company consisted of people of several nations, 
such as Muscovites chiefly ; for there were above 
sixty of them who were merchants or inhabitants 
of Moscow, though of them some were Livonians ; 
and to our particular satisfaction, five of them were 
Scots, who appeared also to be men of great experi- 
ence in business, and men of very good substance. 

When we had travelled one day's journey, the 
guides, who were five in number, called all the gen- 
tlemen and merchants, that is to say, all the passen- 
gers, except the servants, to a great council, as they 
called it. At this great council every one deposited 
a certain quantity of money to a common stock for 
the necessary expense of buying forage on the way, 

[267] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



where it was not otherwise to be had, and for satis- 
fying the guides, getting horses, and the like. And 
here they constituted the journey, as they call it, 
viz., they named captains and officers, to draw us all 
up, and give the command in case of an attack, and 
gave every one their turn of command ; nor was 
this forming us into order any more than what we 
found needful upon the way, as shall be observed 
in its place. 

The road all on this side of the country is very 
populous, and is full of potters and earth makers ; 
that is to say, people that tempered the earth for 
the China ware; and as I was coming along, our 
Portugal pilot, who had always something or other 
to say to make us merry, came sneering to me, and 
told me he would show me the greatest rarity in all 
the country ; and that I should have this to say of 
China, after all the ill-humoured things I had said 
of it, that I had seen one thing which was not to be 
seen in all the world beside. I was very importu- 
nate to know what it was. At last he told me it 
was a gentleman's house, built all with China ware. 
44 Well, 1 ' says I, " are not the materials of their 
building the product of their own country ; and so 
is all China ware, is it not ? 11 — " No, no," says he, 
" I mean it is an house all made of China ware, such 
as you call it in England ; or, as it is called in our 
country, porcelain. " — " Well,'" says I, " such a 
thing may be ; how big is it ? can we carry it in 
a box upon a camel ? If we can, we will buy it." — 
44 Upon a camel ! " says the old pilot, holding up 
both his hands ; 44 why, there is a family of thirty 
people in it."" 

I was then curious, indeed, to see it ; and when I 
came to it, it was nothing but this : it was a timber 
house, or a house built, as we call it in England, with 
lath and plaster, but all the plastering was really 

[ 268 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



China ware, that is to say, it was plastered with the 
earth that makes China ware. 

The outside, which the sun shone hot upon, was 
glazed, and looked very well, perfect white, and 
painted with blue figures, as the large China ware in 
England is painted, and hard, as if it had been burnt. 
As to the inside, all the walls, instead of wainscot, 
were lined up with hardened and painted tiles, like 
the little square tiles we calls galley tiles in England, 
all made of the finest china, and the figures exceed- 
ing fine indeed, with extraordinary variety of colours, 
mixed with gold, many tiles making but one figure, 
but joined so artifically, the mortar being made of 
the same earth, that it was very hard to see where the 
tiles met. The floors of the rooms were of the same 
composition, and as hard as the earthen floors we 
have in use in several parts of England, especially 
Lincolnshire, Nottinghamshire, Leicestershire, &c., 
as hard as a stone, and smooth, but not burnt and 
painted, except some smaller rooms, like closets, 
which were all, as it were, paved with the same tile ; 
the ceiling and, in a word, all the plastering work in 
the whole house were of the same earth ; and, after 
all, the roof was covered with tiles of the same, but 
of a deep shining black. 

This was a China warehouse indeed, truly and 
literally to be called so ; and had I not been upon 
the journey, I could have stayed some days to see 
and examine the particulars of it. They told me 
there were fountains and fish-ponds in the garden, 
all paved at the bottom and sides with the same, and 
fine statues set up in rows on the walks, entirely 
formed of the porcelain earth, and burnt whole. 

As this is one of the singularities of China, so 
they may be allowed to excel in it ; but I am very 
sure they excel in their accounts of it, for they told 
me such incredible things of their performance in 

[269] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



crockery -ware, for such it is, that I care not to relate, 
as knowing it could not be true. They told me, in 
particular, of one workman that made a ship, with 
all its tackle, and masts, and sails, in earthenware, 
big enough to carry fifty men. If he had told me 
he launched it, and made a voyage to Japan in it, 
I might have said something to it indeed ; but as it 
was, I knew the whole of the story, which was, in 
short, asking pardon for the word, that the fellow 
lied ; so I smiled, and said nothing to it. 

This odd sight kept me two hours behind the 
caravan, for which the leader of it for the day fined 
me about the value of three shillings ; and told me, 
if it had been three days'* journey without the wall, 
as it was three days within, he must have fined me 
four times as much, and made me ask pardon the 
next council-day ; so I promised to be more orderly ; 
for, indeed, I found afterward the orders made for 
keeping all together were absolutely necessary for our 
common safety. 

In two days more we passed the great China wall, 
made for a fortification against the Tartars ; and a 
very great work it is, going over hills and mountains 
in a needless track, where the rocks are impassable, 
and the precipices such as no enemy could possibly 
enter, or indeed climb up, or where, if they did, no 
wall could hinder them. They tell us its length is 
near a thousand English miles, but that the country 
is five hundred in a straight measured line, which the 
wall bounds, without measuring the windings and 
turnings it takes ; 't is about four fathoms high, and 
as many thick in some places. 

I stood still an hour, or thereabout, without tres- 
passing our orders, for so long the caravan was in 
passing the gate ; I say, I stood still an hour to look 
at it on every side, near, and far off ; I mean, that 
was within my view ; and the guide of our caravan, 

[270 J 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



who had been extolling it for the wonder of the 
world, was mighty eager to hear my opinion of it. 
I told him it was a most excellent thing to keep off 
the Tartars, which he happened not to understand 
as I meant it, and so took it for a compliment ; but 
the old pilot laughed. " O seignior Inglese," says 
he, " you speak in colours.' 1 " In colours ! " said I ; 
" what do you mean by that ? " " Why, you speak 
what looks white this way, and black that way — 
gay one way, and dull another way. You tell him 
it is a good wall to keep out Tartars ; you tell me, by 
that, it is good for nothing but to keep out Tartars, 
or it will keep out none but Tartars. I understand 
you, seignior Inglese, I understand you,'" says he, 
" but seignior Chinese understood you his own 
way." 

" Well," says I, " seignior, do you think it would 
stand out an army of our country-people, with a good 
train of artillery, or our engineers, with two com- 
panies of miners ? Would not they batter it down 
in ten days, that an army might enter in battalia, or 
blow it up in the air, foundation and all, that there 
should be no sign of it left ? " — " Ah, ah ! " says he, 
" I know that." The Chinese wanted mightily to 
know what I said, and I gave him leave to tell him 
a few days after, for he was then almost out of their 
country, and he was to leave us in a little time after- 
ward ; but when he knew what I had said, he was 
dumb all the rest of the way, and we heard no more 
of his fine story of the Chinese power and greatness 
while he stayed. 

After we had passed this mighty nothing, called a 
wall, something like the Picts"* wall, and so famous in 
Northumberland, and built by the Romans, we be- 
gan to find the country thinly inhabited, and the 
people rather confined to live in fortified towns and 
cities, as being subject to the inroads and depreda- 

[ 271 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



tions of the Tartars, who rob in great armies, and 
therefore are not to be resisted by the naked inhabi- 
tants of an open country. 

And here I began to find the necessity of keeping 
together in a caravan as we travelled, for we saw 
several troops of Tartars roving about ; but when I 
came to see them distinctly, I wondered more that 
the Chinese Empire could be conquered by such con- 
temptible fellows ; for they are a mere horde or 
crowd of wild fellows, keeping no order, and under- 
standing no discipline, or manner of fight. 

Their horses are poor, lean, starved creatures, 
taught nothing, and fit for nothing ; and this we said 
the first day we saw them, which was after we entered 
the wider part of the country. Our leader for the day 
gave leave for about sixteen of us to go a-hunting, 
as they call it, and what was this but hunting of 
sheep ? However, it may be called hunting too ; 
for the creatures are the wildest and swiftest of foot 
that ever I saw of their kind, only they will not run 
a great way, and you are sure of sport when you be- 
gin the chase, for they appear generally thirty or 
forty in a flock, and, like true sheep, always keep to- 
gether when they fly. 

In pursuit of this odd sort of game, it was our hap 
to meet with about forty Tartars. Whether they were 
hunting mutton as we were, or whether they looked 
for another kind of prey, I know not ; but as soon 
as they saw us, one of them blew a kind of horn very 
loud, but with a barbarous sound that I had never 
heard before, and, by the way, never care to hear 
again. We all supposed this was to call their friends 
about them ; and so it was, for in less than half a 
quarter of an hour a troop of forty or fifty more 
appeared at about a mile distance ; but our work 
was over first, as it happened. 

One of the Scots merchants of Moscow happened 

[ 272 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



to be amongst us ; and as soon as he heard the horn 
he told us, in short, that we had nothing to do but 
to charge them immediately, without loss of time; 
and drawing us up in a line, he asked if we were 
resolved ? We told him we were ready to follow 
him ; so he rode directly up to them. They stood 
gazing at us like a mere crowd, drawn up in no 
order, nor showing the face of any order at all ; but 
as soon as they saw us advance, they let fly their 
arrows, which, however, missed us very happily. It 
seems they mistook not their aim, but their dis- 
tance ; for their arrows all fell a little short of us, 
but with so true an aim, that had we been about 
twenty yards nearer, we must have had several men 
wounded, if not killed. 

Immediately we halted ; and though it was at a 
great distance, we fired, and sent them leaden bullets 
for wooden arrows, following our shot full gallop, to 
fall in among them sword in hand, for so our bold 
Scot that led us directed. He was, indeed, but a 
merchant, but he behaved with that vigour and 
bravery on this occasion, and yet with such a cool 
courage too, that I never saw any man in action 
fitter for command. As soon as we came up to them 
we fired our pistols in their faces, and then drew, but 
they fled in the greatest confusion imaginable. The 
only stand any of them made was on our right, where 
three of them stood, and, by signs, called the rest to 
come back to them, having a kind of scymitar in 
their hands, and their bows hanging at their backs. 
Our brave commander, without asking anybody to 
follow him, gallops up close to them, and with his 
fusee knocks one of them off his horse, killed the 
second with his pistol, and the third ran away, and 
thus ended our fight. But we had this misfortune 
attending it, viz., that all our mutton that we had 
in chase got away. We had not a man killed or 

VOL. II. — 18 [273] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



hurt ; but as for the Tartars there was about five 
of them killed. Who were wounded, we knew not ; 
but this we knew, that the other party was so 
frighted with the noise of our guns, that they 
made off, and never made any attempt upon us. 

We were all this while in the Chinese dominion, 
and therefore the Tartars were not so bold as after- 
wards ; but in about five days we entered a vast 
great wild desert, which held us three days' and 
nights 1 march ; and we were obliged to carry our 
water with us in great leather bottles, and to en- 
camp all night, just as I have heard they do in the 
desert of Arabia. 

I asked whose dominion this was in, and they told 
me this was a kind of border, that might be called 
No Man's Land ; being a part of the Great Kara- 
kathie, or Grand Tartary, but that, however, it was 
all reckoned to China ; but that there was no care 
taken here to preserve it from the inroads of thieves, 
and therefore it was reckoned the worst desert in the 
whole world, though we were to go over some much 
larger. 

In passing this wilderness, which, I confess, was 
at the first very frightful to me, we saw two or three 
times little parties of the Tartars, but they seemed 
to be upon their own affairs, and to have no design 
upon us ; and so, like the man who met the devil, if 
they had nothing to say to us, we had nothing to 
say to them ; we let them go. 

Once, however, a party of them came so near as to 
stand and gaze at us ; whether it was to consider 
what they should do, whether attack us or not attack 
us, that we knew not ; but when we w r ere passed at 
some distance by them, we made a rearguard of forty 
men, and stood ready for them, letting the caravan 
pass half a mile, or thereabouts, before us ; but after 
a while they marched off, only we found they saluted 

[ 274 J 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



us with five arrows at their parting, one of which 
wounded a horse so that it disabled him, and we left 
him the next day, poor creature, in great need of a 
good farrier. We suppose they might shoot more 
arrows, which might fall short of us ; but we saw no 
more arrows, or Tartars, that time. 

We travelled near a month after this, the ways 
being not so bad as at first, though still in the domin- 
ions of the Emperor of China ; but lay, for the most 
part, in villages, some of which were fortified because 
of the incursions of the Tartars. When we came to 
one of these towns (it was about two days and a half 
journey before we were to come to the city Naum), 
I wanted to buy a camel, of which there are plenty 
to be sold all the way upon that road, and of horses 
also, such as they are, because so many caravans 
coming that way they are often wanted. The person 
that I spoke to to get me a camel would have gone 
and fetched it for me, but I, like a fool, must be 
officious, and go myself along with him. The place 
was about two miles out of the village, where, it 
seems, they kept the camels and horses feeding under 
a guard. 

I walked it on foot with my old pilot, being 
very desirous, forsooth, of a little variety. When 
we came to the place it was a low marshy ground, 
walled round with a stone wall, piled up dry, with- 
out mortar or earth among it, like a park, with a 
little guard of Chinese soldiers at the door. Having 
bought a camel, and agreed for the price, I came 
away ; and the Chinese man, that went with me, led 
the camel, when on a sudden came up five Tartars 
on horseback. Two of them seized the fellow, and 
took the camel from him, while the other three 
stepped up to me and my old pilot, seeing us, as it 
were, unarmed ; for I had no weapon about me but 
my sword, which could but ill defend me against 

[ 275 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



three horsemen. The first that came up stopped 
short upon my drawing my sword (for they are 
arrant cowards), but a second coming up on my left 
gave me a blow on the head, which I never felt till 
afterward, and wondered, when I came to myself, 
what was the matter with me, and where I was, for 
he laid me flat on the ground ; but my never-failing 
old pilot, the Portuguese (so Providence, unlooked 
for, directs deliverances from dangers which to us 
are unforeseen), had a pistol in his pocket, which I 
knew nothing of, nor the Tartars neither ; if they 
had, I suppose they would not have attacked us ; 
but cowards are always boldest when there is no 
danger. 

The old man seeing me down, with a bold heart 
stepped up to the fellow that had struck me, and laid 
hold of his arm with one hand, and pulling him down 
by main force a little towards him with the other, 
shot him into the head, and laid him dead upon the 
spot. He then immediately stepped up to him who 
had stopped us, as I said, and before he could come 
forward again, for it was all done as it were in a 
moment, made a blow at him with a scymitar, which 
he always wore, but missing the man, cut his horse 
into the side of his head, cut one of his ears off by 
the root, and a great slice down the side of his face. 
The poor beast, enraged with the wound, was no 
more to be governed by his rider, though the fellow 
sat well enough too ; but away he flew, and carried 
him quite out of the pilot's reach, and at some dis- 
tance, rising up upon his hind-legs, threw down the 
Tartar, and fell upon him. 

In this interval the poor Chinese came in who had 
lost the camel, but he had no weapon. However, 
seeing the Tartar down, and his horse fallen upon 
him, away he runs to him, and seizing upon an ugly 
ill-favoured weapon he had by his side, something 

[ 276 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



like a pole-axe, but not a pole-axe neither, he 
wrenched it from him, and made shift to knock 
his Tartarian brains out with it. But my old man 
had the third Tartar to deal with still ; and seeing 
he did not fly as he expected, nor come on to fight 
him as he apprehended, but stand stock still, the 
old man stood still too, and falls to work with his 
tackle to charge his pistol again. But as soon as the 
Tartar saw the pistol, whether he supposed it to be 
the same or another, I know not ; but away he 
scoured, and left my pilot, my champion I called 
him afterward, a complete victory. 

By this time I was a little awake ; for I thought, 
when first I began to wake, that I had been in a 
sweet sleep ; but as I said above, I wondered where I 
was, how I came upon the ground, and what was the 
matter ; in a word, a few moments after, as sense 
returned, I felt pain, though I did not know where. 
I clapped my hand to my head, and took it away 
bloody ; then I felt my head ache, and then, in 
another moment, memory returned, and everything 
was present to me again. 

I jumped up upon my feet instantly, and got hold 
of my sword, but no enemies in view. I found a 
Tartar lie dead, and his horse standing very quietly 
by him ; and looking farther, I saw my champion 
and deliverer, who had been to see what the Chinese 
had done, coming back with his hanger in his hand. 
The old man seeing me on my feet came running to 
me, and embraced me with a great deal of joy, being 
afraid before that I had been killed ; and seeing me 
bloody, would see how I was hurt ; but it was not 
much, only what we call a broken head ; neither did 
I afterwards find any great inconvenience from the 
blow other than the place which was hurt, and was 
well again in two or three days. 

We made no great gain, however, by this victory, 
[277] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



for we lost a camel, and gained a horse ; but that 
which was remarkable, when we came back to the 
village the man demanded to be paid for the camel. 
I disputed it, and it was brought to a hearing before 
the Chinese judge of the place ; that is to say, in 
English, we went before a justice of the peace. Give 
him his due, he acted with a great deal of prudence 
and impartiality ; and having heard both sides, he 
gravely asked the Chinese man that went with me to 
buy the camel whose servant he was ? " I am no 
servant,' 1 says he, " but went with the stranger."" — 
" At whose request ? " says the justice. — " At the 
stranger's request, 11 says he. — " Why then, 11 says the 
justice, " you were the stranger's servant for the time, 
and the camel being delivered to his servant, it was 
delivered to him, and he must pay for it." 

I confess the thing was clear, that I had not a word 
to say ; but admiring to see such just reasoning upon 
the consequence, and so accurate stating the case, I 

Eaid willingly for the camel, and sent for another ; 
ut you may observe, I sent for it ; I did not go and 
fetch it myself any more ; I had enough of that. 

The city of Naun is a frontier of the Chinese Em- 
pire. They call it fortified, and so it is, as fortifica- 
tions go there ; for this I will venture to affirm, that 
all the Tartars in Karakathie, which, I believe, are 
some millions, could not batter down the walls with 
their bows and arrows ; but to call it strong, if it 
were attacked with cannon, would be to make those 
who understand it laugh at you. 

We wanted, as I have said, above two days' jour- 
ney of this city when messengers were sent express to 
every part of the road to tell all travellers and cara- 
vans to halt till they had a guard sent for them, for 
that an unusual body of Tartars, making ten thou- 
sand in all, had appeared in the way, about thirty 
miles beyond the city. 

[278] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



This was very bad news to travellers. However, 
it was carefully done of the governor, and we were 
very glad to hear we should have a guard. Accord- 
ingly, two days after, we had two hundred soldiers 
sent us from a garrison of the Chinese on our left, 
and three hundred more from the city of Naun, and 
with those we advanced boldly ; the three hundred 
soldiers from Naun marched in our front, the two 
hundred in our rear, and our men on each side or 
our camels with our baggage, and the whole caravan 
in the centre. In this order, and well prepared for 
battle, we thought ourselves a match for the whole 
ten thousand Mongol Tartars if they had appeared ; 
but the next day, when they did appear, it was quite 
another thing. 

It was early in the morning when, marching from 
a little well-situated town called Changu, we had a 
river to pass, where we were obliged to ferry ; and had 
the Tartars had any intelligence, then had been the 
time to have attacked us, when, the caravan being over, 
the rearguard was behind ; but they did not appear. 

About three hours after, when we were entered 
upon a desert of about fifteen or sixteen miles over, 
behold, by a cloud of dust they raised, we saw an 
enemy was at hand ; and they were at hand indeed, 
for they came on upon the spur. 

The Chinese, our guard on the front, who had 
talked so big the day before, began to stagger, and 
the soldiers frequently looked behind them, which is 
a certain sign in a soldier that he is just ready to 
run away. My old pilot was of my mind ; and be- 
ing near me, he called out, " Seignior Inglese," says 
he, " those fellows must be encouraged, or they will 
ruin us all ; for if the Tartars come on, they will 
never stand it." — "I am of your mind," said I, 
" but what course must be done ? " — " Done ! " says 
he, " let fifty of our men advance and flank them on 

[279] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



each wing, and encourage them, and they will fight 
like brave fellows in brave company ; but without, 
they will every man turn his back."" Immediately I 
rode up to our leader and told him, who was exactly 
of our mind ; and accordingly fifty of us marched to 
the right wing, and fifty to the left, and the rest 
made a line of reserve ; and so we marched, leaving 
the last two hundred men to make another body by 
themselves, and to guard the camels; only that, if 
Deed were, they should send a hundred men to assist 
the last fifty. 

In a word, the Tartars came on, and an innumer- 
able company they were ; how many, we could not 
tell, but ten thousand we thought was the least. A 
party of them came on first and viewed our posture, 
traversing the ground in the front of our line ; and 
as we found them within gunshot, our leader ordered 
the two wings to advance swiftly, and give them a 
salvo on each wing with their shot, which was done • 
but they went off, and I suppose back to give BD 
account of the reception they were like to meet 
with ; and indeed that salute dogged their stomach, 
for they immediately halted, stood a while to con- 
sider of it, and wheeling off to the left they gave 
over the design, and said no more to us for that 
time ; which was very agreeable to our circum- 
stances, which were but very indifferent for a battle 
with such a number. 

Two days after this we came to the city of Nairn, 
or Naum. We thanked the governor for his care 
for us, and collected to the value of a hundred 
crowns, or thereabouts, w hich we gave to the soldiers 
sent to guard us, and here we rested one day. This 
is a garrison, indeed, and there were nine hundred 
soldiers kept here ; but the reason of it was, that 
formerly the Muscovite frontiers lay nearer to them 
than they do now, the Muscovites having abandoned 

[ 280 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



that part of the country (which lies from this city 
west for about two hundred miles) as desolate and 
unfit for use ; and more especially, being so very re- 
mote, and so difficult to send troops thither for its 
defence ; for we had yet above two thousand miles 
to Muscovy, properly so called. 

After this we passed several great rivers, and two 
dreadful deserts, one of which we were sixteen days 
passing over, and which, as I said, was to be called 
No Man's Land ; and on the 13th of April we came 
to the frontiers of the Muscovite dominions. I 
think the first city, or town, or fortress, whatever it 
might be called, that belonged to the Czar of Mus- 
covy, was called Argunsk, being on the west side of 
the river Argun. 

I could not but discover an infinite satisfaction 
that I was soon arrived in, as I called it, a Christian 
country, or at least in a country governed by Chris- 
tians ; for though the Muscovites do, in my opinion, 
but just deserve the name of Christians, yet such 
they pretend to be, and are very devout in their 
way. It would certainly occur to any man who trav- 
els in the world as I have done, and who had any 
power of reflection, I say, it would occur to him to 
reflect what a blessing it is to be brought into the 
world where the name of God and of a Redeemer is 
known, worshipped, and adored ; and not where the 
people, given up by Heaven to strong delusions, 
worship the devil, and prostrate themselves to stocks 
and stones, worship monsters, elements, horrible 
shaped animals, and statues, or images of monsters. 
Not a town or city we passed through but had their 
pagodas, their idols, and their temples, and ignorant 
people worshipping even the works of their own 
hands. 

Now we came where, at least, a face of the Chris- 
tian worship appeared, where the knee was bowed to 

[281] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



Jesus ; and whether ignorantly or not, yet the 
Christian religion was owned, and the name of the 
true God was called upon and adored, and it made 
the very recesses of my soul rejoice to see it. I sa- 
luted the brave Scots merchant I mentioned above 
with my first acknowledgment of this ; and taking 
him by the hand, I said to him, "Blessed be God, 
we are once again come among Christians ! 11 He 
smiled, and answered, " Do not rejoice too soon, 
countryman ; these Muscovites are but an odd sort 
of Christians ; and but for the name of it, you may 
see very little of the substance for some months far- 
ther of our journey. " 

84 Well," says I, " bat still 't is better than pagan- 
ism, and worshipping of devils." — "Why, I'll tell 
you,'" says he, " except the Russian soldiers in garri- 
sons, and a few of the inhabitants of the cities upon 
the road, all the rest of this country, for above a 
thousand miles farther, is inhabited by the worst 
and most ignorant of pagans. 1 '' And so indeed we 
found it. 

We were now launched into the greatest piece of 
solid earth, if I understand anything of the surface 
of the globe, that is to be found in any part of the 
earth. We had at least twelve hundred miles to 
the sea, eastward ; we had at least two thousand to 
the bottom of the Baltic Sea, westward ; and above 
three thousand miles, if we left that sea, and went 
on west to the British and French channels ; we had 
full five thousand miles to the Indian or Persian Sea, 
south ; and about eight hundred miles to the Frozen 
sea, north ; nay, if some people may be believed, 
there might be no sea north-east till we came round 
the pole, and consequently into the north-west, and 
so had a continent of land into America, the Lord 
knows where ; though I could give some reasons 
why I believe that to be a mistake. 

[ 282 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



As we entered into the Muscovite dominions a 
good while before we came to any considerable towns, 
we had nothing to observe there but this ; first, that 
all the rivers that run to the east — as I understood 
by the charts, which some in our caravan had with 
them — it was plain all those rivers ran into the 
great river Amour, or Gam m our. This river, by 
the natural course of it, must run into the east sea, 
or Chinese ocean. The story they tell us, that the 
mouth of this river is choked up with bulrushes of 
a monstrous growth, viz., three feet about, and twenty 
or thirty feet high, I must be allowed to say I believe 
nothing of ; but as its navigation is of no use, because 
there is no trade that way, the Tartars, to whom 
alone it belongs, dealing in nothing but cattle, so 
nobody that ever I heard of has been curious enough 
either to go down to the mouth of it in boats, or 
come up from the mouth of it in ships ; but this is 
certain, that this river running due east, in the lati- 
tude of [fifty degrees], carries a vast concourse of 
rivers along with it, and finds an ocean to empty 
itself in that latitude ; so we are sure of sea there. 

Some leagues to the north of this river there are 
several considerable rivers, whose streams run as due 
north as the Amour runs east ; and these are all 
found to join their waters with the great river Tar- 
tarus, named so from the northernmost nations of 
the Mongol Tartars, who, the Chinese say, were the 
first Tartars in the world ; and who, as our geogra- 
phers allege, are the Gog and Magog mentioned in 
sacred story. 

These rivers running all northward, as well as all 
the other rivers I am yet to speak of, make it evident 
that the northern ocean bounds the land also on that 
side, so that it does not seem rational in the least to 
think that the land can extend itself to join with 
America on that side, or that there is not a com- 

[ 283 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



munication between the northern and the eastern 
ocean ; but of this I shall say no more ; it was my 
observation at that time, and therefore I take notice 
of it in this place. We now advanced from the river 
Argun by easy and moderate journeys, and were very 
visibly obliged to the care the Czar of Muscovy has 
taken to have cities and towns built in as many places 
as are possible to place them, where his soldiers keep 
garrison something like the stationary soldiers placed 
by the Romans in the remotest countries of their 
empire, some of which I had read particularly were 
placed in Britain for the security of commerce, and 
For the lodging travellers. And thus it was here; 
for wherever we came, though at these towns and 
stations the garrisons and governor were Russians 
and professed Christians, yet the inhabitants of the 
country were mere pagans, sacrificing to idols, and 
worshipping the sun, moon, and stars, or all the 
host of heaven ; and not only so, but were, of all 
the heathens and pagans that ever I met with, the 
most barbarous, except only that they did not eat 
man's flesh, as our savages of America did. 

Some instances of this we met with in the country 
between Argunsk, where we enter the Muscovite 
dominions, and a city of Tartars and Russians to- 
gether, called Nertchinsk, in which is a continued 
desert or forest, which cost us twenty days to travel 
over it. In a village near the last of those places, I 
had the curiosity to go and see their way of living, 
which is most brutish and unsufferable. They had, 
I suppose, a great sacrifice that day ; for there stood 
out upon an old stump of a tree an idol made of 
wood, frightful as the devil, at least as anything we 
can think of to represent the devil can be made. 
It had a head certainly not so much as resembling 
any creature that the world ever saw ; ears as big as 
goat's horns, and as high ; eyes as big as a crown- 

[ 284 J 



KOMNSON CRUSOE 



piece ; a nose like a crooked ram's horn ; and a 
mouth extended four-cornered, like that of a lion, 
with horrible teeth, hooked like a parrot's under- 
bill. It was dressed up in the filthiest manner that 
you could suppose ; its upper garment was of sheep- 
skins, with the wool outward ; a great Tartar bonnet 
on the head, with two horns growing through it ; it 
was about eight feet high, yet had no feet or legs, 
or any other proportion of parts. 

This scarcecrow was set up at the outer side of 
the village ; and when I came near to it there was 
sixteen or seventeen creatures, whether men or women 
I could not tell, for they make no distinction by 
their habits, either of body or head ; these lay all 
flat on the ground, round this formidable block of 
shapeless wood- I saw no motion among them any 
more than if they had been all logs of wood, like 
their idol ; and at first really thought they had been 
so ; but when I came a little nearer, they started up 
upon their feet, and raised a howling cry, as if it 
had been so many deep-mouthed hounds, and walked 
away as if they were displeased at our disturbing 
them. A little way off from the idol, and at the 
door of that tent or hut, made all of sheep-skins 
and cow -skins, dried, stood three butchers ; I thought 
they were such ; when I came nearer to them I 
found they had long knives in their hands, and in 
the middle of the tent appeared three sheep killed, 
and one young bullock, or steer. These, it seems, 
were sacrifices to that senseless log of an idol, and 
these three men priests belonging to it ; and the 
seventeen prostrated wretches were the people who 
brought the offering, and were making their prayers 
to that stock. 

I confess I was more moved at their stupidity and 
brutish worship of a hobgoblin, than ever I was at 
anything in my life ; to see God's most glorious and 

[285] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



best creature, to whom He had granted so many 
advantages, even by creation, above the rest of the 
works of His hands, vested with a reasonable soul, 
and that soul adorned with faculties and capacities 
adapted both to honour his Maker and be honoured 
by Him, sunk and degenerated to a degree so more 
than stupid as to prostrate itself to a frightful 
nothing, a mere imaginary object dressed up by 
themselves, and made terrible to themselves by their 
own contrivance, adorned only with clouts and rags; 
and that this should be the effect of mere ignorance, 
wrought up into hellish devotion by the devil him- 
self, who, envying (to his Maker) the homage and 
adoration of His creatures, had deluded them into 
such gross, surfeiting, sordid, and brutish things as 
odu would think should shock Nature itself. 

But what signified all the astonishment and re- 
flection of thoughts ? Thus it was, and I saw it 
before my eyes ; and there was no room to wonder 
at it, or think it impossible. All my admiration 
turned to rage ; and I rode up to the image, or 
monster, call it what you will, and with my sword 
cut the bonnet that was on its head in two in the 
middle, so that it hung down by one of the horns ; 
and one of our men that was with me took hold of 
the sheep-skin that covered it, and pulled at it, 
when, behold, a most hideous outcry and howling 
ran through the village, and two or three hundred 
people came about my ears, so that I was glad to 
scour for it, for we saw some had bows and arrows ; 
but I resolved from that moment to visit them 
again. 

Our caravan rested three nights at the town, 
which was about four miles off, in order to provide 
some horses which they wanted, several of the horses 
having been lamed and jaded with the badness of the 
way and long march over the last desert ; so we had 

[286] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



some leisure here to put my design in execution. I 
communicated my project to the Scots merchant of 
Moscow, of whose courage I had had sufficient testi- 
mony, as above. I told him what I had seen, and 
with what indignation I had since thought that 
human nature could be so degenerate. I told him I 
was resolved, if I could but get four or five men well 
armed to go with me, I was resolved to go and de- 
stroy that vile, abominable idol, and let them see 
that it had no power to help itself, and consequently 
could not be an object of worship, or to be prayed 
to, much less help them that offered sacrifices to it. 

He laughed at me. Says he, " Your zeal may be 
good, but what do you propose to yourself by it ? n 
— " Propose ! " said I ; "to vindicate the honour of 
God, which is insulted by this devil worship." — 
" But how will it vindicate the honour of God," 
said he, 66 while the people will not be able to know 
what you mean by it, unless you could speak to 
them, and tell them so ? and then they will fight you, 
and beat you too, I '11 assure you, for they are des- 
perate fellows, and that especially in defence of their 
idolatry.'" — 44 Can we not," said I, 44 do it in the 
night, and then leave them the reasons and causes in 
writing, in their own language ?" — "Writing!" 
said he ; 44 why, there is not a man in five nations 
of them that know anything of a letter, or how to 
read a word in any language, or in their own.'" — 
" Wretched ignorance ! " said I to him ; " however, 
I have a great mind to do it ; perhaps Nature may 
draw inferences from it to them, to let them see how 
brutish they are to worship such horrid things. " — 
44 Look you, sir," said he, 44 if your zeal prompts you 
to it so warmly, you must do it ; but in the next 
place I would have you consider these wild nations 
of people are subjected by force to the Czar of Mus- 
covy^ dominions ; and if vou do this 't is ten to one 

[ 287 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



but they will come by thousands to the governor of 
Nertchinsk, and complain, and demand satisfaction ; 
and if he cannot give them satisfaction, 't is ten to 
one but they revolt, and will occasion a new war with 
all the Tartars in the country." 

This, I confess, put new thoughts into my head for 
a while ; but I harped upon the same string still, and 
all that day I was uneasy to put my project in 
execution. Towards the evening the Scots merchant 
met me by accident in our walk about the town, 
and desired to speak with me. " I believe,'" said 
he, " I have put you off of your good design ; I have 
been a little concerned about it since, for I abhor 
the idol and idolatry as much as you can do." — 
" Truly," says I, " you have put it off a little as to 
the execution of it, but you have not put it all out 
of my thoughts, and I believe I shall do it still be- 
fore I quit this place, though I were to be delivered 
up to them for satisfaction." — u No, no," says he ; 
" God forbid they should deliver you up to such a 
crew of monsters ! they shall not do that neither ; 
that would be murdering you indeed." — " Why," 
says I, " how would they use me ? " — " Use you ! " 
says he ; " 1 11 tell you how they served a poor Rus- 
sian who affronted them in their worship just as you 
did, and who they took prisoner after they had 
lamed him with an arrow, that he could not run 
away. They took him and stripped him stark naked, 
and set him up on the top of the idol monster, and 
stood all round him, and shot as many arrows into 
him as would stick over his whole body; and then they 
burnt him, and all the arrows sticking in him, as a 
sacrifice to the idol." — " And was this the same 
idol?" — "Yes," says he, "the very same." — 
" Well," says I, " 1 11 tell you a story." So I related 
the story of our men at Madagascar, and how they 
burnt and sacked the village there, and killed man, 

[288] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



woman, and child for their murdering one of our 
men, just as it is related before ; and when I had 
done, I added that I thought we ought to do so to 
this village. 

He listened very attentively to the story ; but 
when I talked of doing so to that village, says he, 
" You mistake very much ; it was not this village, 
it was almost a hundred miles from this place ; but 
it was the same idol, for they carry him about in 
procession all over the country.' 1 — " Well then," 
says I, " then that idol ought to be punished for it ; 
and it shall, ,, says I, " if I live this night out. 11 

In a word, finding me resolute, he liked the design, 
and told me I should not go alone, but he would go 
with me, and bring a stout fellow, one of his country- 
men, to go also with us ; " and one, 11 says he, " as 
famous for his zeal as you can desire any one to be 
against such devilish things as these. 11 In a word, 
he brought me his comrade, a Scotsman, whom he 
called Captain Richardson ; and I gave him a full 
account of what I had seen, and, in a word, of what 
I intended ; and he told me readily he would go 
with me if it cost him his life ; so we agreed to go, 
only us three. I had, indeed, proposed it to my 
partner, but he declined it. He said he was ready 
to assist me to the utmost, and upon all occasions, 
for my defence ; but that this was an adventure quite 
out of his way ; so, I say, we resolved upon our work, 
only us three, and my man-servant, and to put it in 
execution that night about midnight, with all the 
secrecy imaginable. 

However, upon second thoughts we were willing to 
delay it till the next night, because the caravan being 
to set forward in the morning, we supposed the gov- 
ernor could not pretend to give them any satisfaction 
upon us when we were out of his power. The Scots 
merchant, as steady in his resolution for the enter- 
VOL. II.— 19 [289] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



prise as bold in executing, brought me a Tartar's 
robe or gown of the sheep-skins, and a bonnet, with a 
bow and arrows, and had provided the same for him- 
self and his countryman, that the people, if they saw 
us, should not be able to determine who we were. 

All the first night we spent in mixing up some 
combustible matter with aqua-vitae, gunpowder, and 
such other materials as we could get ; and having a 
good quantity of tar in a little pot, about an hour 
after night we set out upon our expedition. 

We came to the place about eleven o'clock at 
night, and found that the people had not the least 
jealousy of danger attending their idol ; the night 
was cloudy, yet the moon gave us light enough to 
see that the idol stood just in the same posture and 
place that it did before. The people seemed to be 
all at their rest ; only, that in the great hut, or tent, 
as we called it, where we saw the three priests, whom 
we mistook for butchers, we saw a light, and going 
up close to the door we heard people talking, as if 
there were five or six of them. We concluded, 
therefore, that if we set the wild-fire to the idol, 
these men would come out immediately and run up 
to the place to rescue it from the destruction that 
we intended for it; and what to do with them we 
knew not. Once we thought of carrying it away, 
and setting fire to it at a distance ; but when we 
came to handle it, we found it too bulky for our 
carriage, so we were at a loss again. The second 
Scotsman was for setting fire to the tent or hut, and 
knocking the creatures that were there on the head 
when they came out ; but I could not join with that. 
I was against killing them, if it was possible to be 
avoided. " Well then," said the Scots merchant, 
" 1 11 tell you what we will do ; we will try to take 
them prisoners, tie their hands behind them, and 
make them stand still and see their idol destroyed." 

[ 290 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



As it happened, we had twine or packthread 
enough about us, which was used to tie our fireworks 
together with ; so we resolved to attack the people 
first, and with as little noise as we could. The first 
thing we did we knocked at the door, which issued 
j ust as we desired it ; for one of their idol priests 
came to the door. We immediately seized upon 
him, stopped his mouth, and tied his hands behind 
him, and led him to the idol, where we gagged him 
that he might not make a noise, tied his feet also 
together, and left him on the ground. 

Two of us then waited at the door, expecting that 
another would come out to see what the matter was ; 
but we waited so long till the third man came back 
to us, and then nobody coming out, we knocked 
again gently, and immediately out came two more, 
and we served them just in the same manner, but 
were obliged to go all with them, and lay them down 
by the idol some distance from one another ; when 
going back we found two more were come out to the 
door, and a third stood between them within the 
door. We seized the two, and immediately tied 
them, when the third stepping back, and crying out, 
my Scots merchant went in after him, and taking 
out a composition we had made, that would only 
smoke and stink, he set fire to it, and threw it in 
among them. By that time the other Scotsman and 
my man taking charge of the two men who were 
already bound, and tied together also by the arm, 
led them away to the idol, and left them there, to 
see if their idol would relieve them, making haste back 
to us. 

When the fuze we had thrown in had filled the hut 
with so much smoke that they were almost suffocated, 
we then threw in a small leather bag of another kind, 
which flamed like a candle, and following it in we 
found there was but four people left, who, it seems, 

[291 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



were two men and two women, and, as we supposed, 
had been about some of their diabolic sacrifices. 
They appeared, in short, frighted to death, at least 
so as to sit trembling and stupid, and not able to 
speak neither for the smoke. 

In a word, we took them, bound them as we had 
the others, and all without any noise. I should have 
s;iid we brought them out of the house, or hut, first ; 
for, indeed, we were not able to bear the smoke any 
more than they were. When we had done this, 
we carried them all together to the idol. When we 
came there, we fell to work with him ; and first we 
daubed him all over, and his robes also, with tar and 
such other stuff as we had, which was tallow mixed 
with brimstone ; then we stopped his eyes, ears, and 
mouth full of gunpowder ; and then we wrapped up 
a great piece of wild-fire in his bonnet ; and then 
sticking all the combustibles we had brought with 
us upon him, we looked about to see if we could find 
anything else to help to burn him ; when my man 
remembered that by the tent or hut, where the men 
were, there lay a heap of dry forage, whether straw 
or rushes I do not remember; away he and one of 
the Scotsmen ran, and fetched their arms full of that. 
When we had done this, we took all our prisoners, 
and brought them, having untied their feet and 
ungagged their mouths, and made them stand up, 
and set them just before their monstrous idol, and 
there set fire to the whole. 

We stayed by it a quarter of an hour or there- 
abouts, till the powder in the eyes, and mouth, and 
ears of the idol blew up, and we could perceive had 
split and deformed the shape, and in a word, till we 
saw it burn into a mere block or log of wood ; and 
then setting the dry forage to it, we found it would 
be quite consumed, when we began to think of going 
away ; but the Scotsman said, " No, we must not go, 

[ 292 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



for these poor deluded wretches will all throw them- 
selves into the fire, and burn themselves with the 
idol. 1 ' So we resolved to stay till the forage was 
burnt down too, and then we came away and left 
them. 

In the morning we appeared among our fellow- 
travellers, exceeding busy in getting ready for our 
journey ; nor could any man suggest that we had 
been anywhere but in our beds, as travellers might 
be supposed to be, to fit themselves for the fatigue 
of that day's journey. 

But it did not end so. The next day came a 
great multitude of the country people, not only of 
this village, but of a hundred more, for aught I 
know, to the town gates, and in a most outrageous 
manner demanded satisfaction of the Russian gov- 
ernor for the insulting their priests, and burning 
their great Cham-Chi-Thaungu, such a hard name 
they gave the monstrous creature they worshipped. 
The people of Nertchinsk were at first in a great 
consternation ; for they said the Tartars were no less 
than thirty thousand, and that in a few days more 
would be one hundred thousand strong. 

The Russian governor sent out messengers to ap- 
pease them, and gave them all the good words imag- 
inable. He assured them he knew nothing of it, and 
that there had not a soul of his garrison been 
abroad ; that it could not be from anybody there ; 
and if they would let him know who it was, they 
should be exemplarily punished. They returned 
haughtily that all the country reverenced the great 
Cham-Chi-Thaungu, who dwelt in the sun, and no 
mortal would have dared to offer violence to his 
image but some Christian miscreant, so they called 
them, it seems ; and they therefore denounced war 
against him and all the Russians, who, they said, 
were miscreants and Christians. 

[ 293 1 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



The governor, still patient, and unwilling to make 
a breach, or to have any cause of war alleged to be 
given by him, the Czar having strictly charged them 
to treat the conquered country with gentleness and 
civility, gave them still all the good words he could. 
At last he told them there was a caravan gone to- 
wards Russia that morning, and perhaps it was some 
of them who had done them this injury ; and that if 
they would be satisfied with that, he would send 
after them, to inquire into it. This seemed to ap- 
pease them a little ; and accordingly the governor 
sent after us, and gave us a particular account how 
the thing was, intimating withal that if any in our 
caravan had done it they should make their escape ; 
but that whether they had done it or no, we should 
make all the haste forward that was possible, and 
that in the meantime he would keep them in play as 
long as he could. 

This was very friendly in the governor. However, 
when it came to the caravan there was nobody knew 
anything of the matter ; and as for us that were guilty, 
we were the least of all suspected ; none so much as 
asked us the question. However, the captain of the 
caravan for the time took the hint that the governor 
gave us, and we marched or travelled two days and 
two nights without any considerable stop, and then 
we lay at a village called Plotbus ; nor did we make 
any long stop here, but hastened on towards Jera- 
wena, another of the Czar of Muscovy's colonies, and 
where we expected we should be safe. But it is to 
be observed that here we began, for two or three 
days' march, to enter upon the vast nameless desert, 
of which I shall say more in its place, and which if 
we had now been upon it, it is more than probable 
we had been all destroyed. It was the second day's 
march from Plotbus that by the clouds of dust be- 
hind us, at a great distance, some of our people 

[ 294 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



began to be sensible we were pursued. We had 
entered the desert, and had passed by a great lake 
called Schaks-Oser, when we perceived a very great 
body of horse appear on the other side of the 
lake to the north, we travelling west. We observed 
they went away west, as we did, but had supposed 
we would have taken that side of the lake, whereas 
we very happily took the south side ; and in two 
days more we saw them not, for they, believing we 
were still before them, pushed on till they came to 
the river Uda. This is a very great river when it 
passes farther north, but where we came to it we 
found it narrow and fordable. 

The third day they either found their mistake, or 
had intelligence of us, and came pouring in upon us 
towards the dusk of the evening. We had, to our 
great satisfaction, just pitched upon a place for our 
camp which was very convenient for the night ; for 
as we were upon a desert, though but at the begin- 
ning of it, that was above five hundred miles over, 
we had no towns to lodge at, and, indeed, expected 
none but the city Jerawena, which we had yet two 
days 1 march to ; the desert, however, had some few 
woods in it on this side, and little rivers which ran 
all into the great river Uda. It was in a narrow 
strait, between two little but very thick woods, that 
we pitched our little camp for that night, expecting 
to be attacked in the night. 

Nobody knew but ourselves what we were pursued 
for ; but as it was usual for the Mongol Tartars to 
go about in troops in that desert, so the caravans 
always fortify themselves every night against them 
as against armies of robbers ; and it was, therefore, 
no new thing to be pursued. But we had this night, 
of all the nights of our travels, a most advantageous 
camp ; for we lay between two woods, with a little 
rivulet running just before our front, so that we 

[295] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



could not be surrounded or attacked any way but in 
our front or rear. We took care also to make our 
front as strong as we could by placing our packs, 
with our camels and horses, all in a line on the 
inside of the river, and felling some trees in our 
rear. 

In this posture we encamped for the night ; but 
the enemy was upon us before we had finished our 
situation. They did not come on us like thieves, as 
we expected, but sent three messengers to us, to 
demand the men to be delivered to them that had 
abused their priests, and burnt their god Cham-Chi- 
Thaungu with fire, that they might burn them with 
fire ; and upon this, they said they would go away, 
and do us no farther harm ; otherwise, they would 
burn us all with fire. Our men looked very blank 
at this message, and began to stare at one another 
to see who looked with most guilt in their faces ; 
but " nobody " was the word, nobody did it. The 
leader of the caravan sent word he was well assured 
it was not done by any of our camp ; that we were 
peaceable merchants travelling on our business ; that 
we had done no harm to them, or to any one else ; 
and that, therefore, they must look farther for their 
enemies who had injured them, for we were not the 
people ; so desired them not to disturb us, for if 
they did, we should defend ourselves. 

They were far from being satisfied with this for 
an answer, but a great crowd of them came down in 
the morning, by break of day, to our camp ; but 
seeing us in such an unaccountable situation, they 
durst come no farther than the brook in our front, 
where they stood and showed us such a number, that 
indeed terrified us very much ; for those that spoke 
least of them, spoke of ten thousand. Here they 
stood and looked at us a while, and then setting up 
a great howl, they let fly a crowd of arrows among 

[296] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



us ; but we were well enough fortified for that, for 
we sheltered under our baggage ; and I do not re- 
member that one man of us was hurt. 

Some time after this we saw them move a little to 
our right, and expected them on the rear, when a 
cunning fellow, a Cossack, as they call them, of Jera- 
wena, in the pay of the Muscovites, calling to the 
leader of the caravan, said to him, " 1 11 go send all 
these people away to Shilka ; " this was a city four 
or five days' journey at least to the south, and 
rather behind us. So he takes his bow and arrows, 
and getting on horseback, he rides away from our 
rear directly, as it were back to Nertchinsk ; after 
this he takes a great circuit about, and comes to the 
army of the Tartars, as if he had been sent express 
to tell them a long story, that the people who had 
burnt the Cham-Chi-Thaungu were gone to Shilka 
with a caravan of miscreants, as he called them, that 
is to say, Christians, and that they had resolved to 
burn the god Schal-Isar, belonging to the Tonguses. 

As this fellow was himself a mere Tartar, and per- 
fectly spoke their language, he counterfeited so well, 
that they all took it from him, and away they drove 
in a most violent hurry to Shilka, which it seems 
was five days' journey to the north ; and in less than 
three hours they were entirely out of our sight, and 
we never heard any more of them, and we never 
knew whether they went to that other place called 
Shilka or no. So we passed safely on to the city of 
Jerawena, where there was a garrison of Muscovites ; 
and there we rested five days, the caravan being ex- 
ceedingly fatigued with the last day's hard march, 
and with want of rest in the night. 

From this city we had a frightful desert, which 
held us three and twenty days' march. We furnished 
ourselves with some tents here, for the better accom- 
modating ourselves in the night ; and the leader of 

[ 297 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



the caravan procured sixteen carriages, or waggons, 
of the country for carrying our water and provisions ; 
and these carriages were our defence every night 
round our little camp ; so that had the Tartars ap- 
peared, unless they had been very numerous indeed, 
they would not have been able to hurt us. 

We may well be supposed to want rest again after 
this long journey ; for in this desert we saw abun- 
dance of the sable-hunters, as they called them. 
These are all Tartars of the Mongol Tartary, of 
which this country is a part, and they frequently at- 
tack small caravans ; but we saw no numbers of them 
together. I was curious to see the sable skins they 
catched, but could never speak with any of them, 
for they durst not come near vis, neither durst we 
straggle from our company to go near them. 

After we had passed this desert, we came into a 
country pretty well inhabited ; that is to say, we 
found towns and castles settled by the Czar of Mus- 
covy with garrisons of stationary soldiers, to protect 
the caravans, and defend the country against the 
Tartars, who would otherwise make it very danger- 
ous travelling ; and his czarish majesty has given 
such strict orders for the well guarding the caravans 
and merchants, that if there are any Tartars heard 
of in the country, detachments of the garrisons are 
always sent to see the travellers safe from station to 
station. And thus the governor of Udinsk, whom I 
had opportunity to make a visit to by means of the 
Scots merchant, who was acquainted with him, of- 
fered us a guard of fifty men, if we thought there 
was any danger, to the next station. 

I thought long before this, that as we came nearer 
to Europe we should find the country better peopled, 
and the people more civilised ; but I found myself 
mistaken in both, for we had yet the nation of the 
Tonguses to pass through, where we saw the same 

[ 298 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



tokens of paganism and barbarity, or worse, than 
before ; only as they were conquered by the Mus- 
covites, and entirely reduced, they were not so 
dangerous ; but for rudeness of manners, idolatry, 
and multitheism, no people in the world ever went 
beyond them. They are clothed all in skins of 
beasts, and their houses are built of the same. You 
know not a man from a woman, neither by the 
ruggedness of their countenances or their clothes ; 
and in the winter, when the ground is covered with 
snow, they live underground, in houses like vaults, 
which have cavities going from one to another. 

If the Tartars had their Cham-Chi-Thaungu for a 
whole village or country, these had idols in every hut 
and in every cave; besides, they worship the stars, the 
sun, the water, the snow ; and in a word, everything 
that they do not understand — and they understand 
but very little — so that almost every element, every 
uncommon thing, sets them a-sacrificing. 

But I am no more to describe people than countries, 
any farther than my own story comes to be con- 
cerned in them. I met with nothing peculiar to 
myself in this country, which I reckon was, from the 
desert which I spoke of last, at least four hundred 
miles, half of it being another desert, which took us 
up twelve days 1 severe travelling, without house, or 
tree, or bush, but were obliged again to carry our 
own provisions, as well water as bread. After we 
were out of this desert, and had travelled two days, 
we came to Yeniseisk, a Muscovite city or station 
on the great river Yenisei. This river, they told us, 
parted Europe from Asia, though our map-makers, 
as I am told, do not agree to it ; however, it is 
certainly the eastern boundary of the ancient Siberia, 
which now makes up a province only of the vast 
Muscovite Empire, but is itself equal in bigness to 
the whole empire of Germany. 

[299] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



And yet here I observed ignorance and paganism 
still prevailed, except in the Muscovite garrisons. 
All the country between the river Obi and the river 
Yenisei is as entirely pagan, and the people as bar- 
barous, as the remotest of the Tartars ; nay, as any 
nation, for ought I know, in Asia or America. I 
also found, which I observed to the Muscovite 
governors, whom I had opportunity to converse 
with, that the poor pagans are not much the wiser, 
or the nearer Christianity, for being under the Mus- 
covite government, which they acknowledged was 
true enough, but as they said, was none of their 
business ; that if the Czar expected to convert his 
Siberian, or Tonguse, or Tartar subjects, it should 
be done by sending clergymen among them, not 
soldiers ; and they added, with more sincerity than I 
expected, that they found it was not so much the 
concern of their monarch to make the people Chris- 
tians, as it was to make them subjects. 

From this river to the great river Obi we crossed 
a wild and uncultivated country ; I cannot say 't is a 
barren soil ; 't is only barren of people, and good 
management, otherwise it is in itself a most pleasant, 
fruitful, and agreeable country. What inhabitants 
we found in it are all pagans, except such as arc 
sent among them from Russia ; for this is the country, 
I mean on both sides the river Obi, whither the 
Muscovite criminals, that are not put to death, are 
banished, and from whence it is next to impossible 
they should ever come away. 

I have nothing material to say of my particular 
affairs till I came to Tobolsk, the capital city of 
Siberia, where I continued some time on the follow- 
ing occasion. 

We had been now almost seven months on our 
journey, and winter began to come on apace, where- 
upon my partner and I called a council about our 

[ 300 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



particular affairs, in which we found it proper, con- 
sidering that we were bound for England, and not 
for Moscow, to consider how to dispose of ourselves. 
They told us of sledges and reindeer to carry us over 
the snow in the winter-time ; and, indeed, they have 
such things, that it would be incredible to relate the 
particulars of, by which means the Russians travel 
more in the winter than they can in summer, be- 
cause in these sledges they are able to run all night 
and day ; the snow being frozen, is one universal 
covering to Nature, by which the hills, the vales, 
the rivers, the lakes all are smooth, and hard as a 
stone, and they run upon the surface without any 
regard to what is underneath. 

But I had no occasion to push at a winter journey 
of this kind. I was bound to England, not to Mos- 
cow, and my route lay two ways ; either I must go 
on, as the caravan went, till I came to Jaroslav, and 
then go off west for Narva and the Gulf of Finland, 
and so either by sea or land to Dantzic, where I 
might possibly sell my China cargo to good advan- 
tage, or I must leave the caravan at a little town on 
the Dwina, from whence I had but six days by water 
to Archangel, and from thence might be sure of 
shipping either to England, Holland, or Hamburg. 

Now to go any of these journeys in the winter 
would have been preposterous ; for as to Dantzic, the 
Baltic would be frozen up, and I could not get pas- 
sage ; and to go by land in those countries, was far 
less safe than among the Mongol Tartars ; likewise 
to go to Archangel in October, all the ships would 
be gone from thence, and even the merchants, who 
dwell there in summer, retire south to Moscow in 
the winter when the ships are gone, so that I should 
have nothing but extremity of cold to encounter, 
with a scarcity of provisions, and must lie there in 
an empty town all the winter; so that, upon the 

[ 301 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



whole, I thought it a much better way to let the 
caravan go, and to make provision to winter where 
I was, viz., at Tobolsk, in Siberia, in the latitude of 
[fifty-eight] degrees, where I was sure of three things 
to wear out a cold winter with, viz., plenty of pro- 
vision, such as the country afforded, a warm house, 
with fuel enough, and excellent company; of all 
which I shall give a full account in its place. 

I was now in a quite different climate from my 
beloved island, where I never felt cold, except when 
I had my ague ; on the contrary, I had much to do 
to bear my clothes on my back, and never made any 
fire but without doors, and for my necessity, in dress- 
ing my food, &c. Now I made me three good vests, 
with large robes or gowns over them, to hang down 
to the feet, and button close to the wrists, and all 
these lined with furs, to make them sufficiently warm. 

As to a warm house, I must confess I greatly dis- 
liked our way in England of making fires in every 
room in the house, in open chimneys, which, when 
the fire was out, always kept the air in the room 
cold as the climate ; but taking an apartment in a 
good house in the town, I ordered a chimney to be 
built like a furnace, in the centre of six several 
rooms, like a stove ; the funnel to carry the smoke 
went up one way, the door to come at the fire went 
in another, and all the rooms were kept equally 
warm, but no fire seen, just as they heat the bagnios 
in England. 

By this means we had always the same climate in 
all the rooms, and an equal heat was preserved ; and 
how cold soever it was without, it was always warm 
within ; and yet we saw no fire, nor was incommoded 
with any smoke. 

The most wonderful thing of all was, that it 
should be possible to meet with good company 
here, in a country so barbarous as that of the most 

[ 302 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



northerly parts of Europe, near the Frozen ocean, 
and within but a very few degrees of Nova Zembla. 

But this being the country where the state crim- 
inals of Muscovy, as I observed before, are all 
banished, this city was full of noblemen, princes, 
gentlemen, colonels, and, in short, all degrees of the 
nobility, gentry, soldiery, and courtiers of Muscovy. 
Here was the famous Prince Galliozen, the old 
General Robostiski, and several other persons of 
note, and some ladies. 

By means of my Scots merchant, whom, neverthe- 
less, I parted with here, I made an acquaintance 
here with several of these gentlemen, and some of 
them of the first rank ; and from these in the long 
winter nights in which I stayed here I received 
several very agreeable visits. It was talking one 
night with Prince one of the banished min- 
isters of state belonging to the Czar of Muscovy, 
that my talk of my particular case began. He had 
been telling me abundance of fine things of the 
greatness, the magnificence, the dominions, and the 
absolute power of the Emperor of the Russians. I 
interrupted him, and told him I was a greater and 
more powerful prince than ever the Czar of Muscovy 
was, though my dominions were not so large, or my 
people so many. The Russian grandee looked a 
little surprised, and fixing his eyes steadily upon 
me, began to wonder what I meant. 

I told him his wonder would cease when I had ex- 
plained myself. First, I told him I had the absolute 
disposal of the lives and fortunes of all my subjects ; 
that notwithstanding my absolute power, I had not 
one person disaffected to my government or to my 
person in all my dominions. He shook his head at 
that, and said, there indeed I outdid the Czar of 
Muscovy. I told him that all the lands in my 
kingdom were my own, and all my subjects were not 

[ 303 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



only my tenants, but tenants at will ; that they 
would all fight for me to the last drop ; and that 
never tyrant, for such I acknowledged myself to be, 
was ever so universally beloved, and yet so horribly 
feared, by his subjects. 

After amusing them with these riddles in govern- 
ment for a while, I opened the case, and told them 
the story at large of my living in the island, and 
how I managed both myself and the people there 
that were under me, just as I have since minuted it 
down. They were exceedingly taken with the story, 
and especially the prince, who told me with a sigh 
that the true greatness of life was to be master of 
ourselves ; that he would not have exchanged such 
a state of life as mine to have been Czar of Muscovy ; 
and that he found more felicity in the retirement he 
seemed to be banished to there, than ever he found 
in the highest authority he enjoyed in the court of 
his master the Czar ; that the height of human wis- 
dom was to bring our tempers down to our circum- 
stances, and to make a calm within, under the weight 
of the greatest storm without. When he came first 
hither, he said, he used to tear the hair from his 
head, and the clothes from his back, as others had 
done before him ; but a little time and considera- 
tion had made him look into himself, as well as 
round him, to things without ; that he found the 
mind of man, if it was but once brought to reflect 
upon the state of universal life, and how little this 
world was concerned in its true felicity, was perfectly 
capable of making a felicity for itself, fully satisfy- 
ing to itself, and suitable to its own best ends and 
desires, with but very little assistance from the 
world ; that air to breathe in, food to sustain life, 
clothes for warmth, and liberty for exercise in order 
to health, completed, in his opinion, all that the 
world could do for us ; and though the greatness, 

[ 304 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



the authority, the riches, and the pleasures which 
some enjoyed in the world, and which he had en- 
joyed his share of, had much in them that was 
agreeable to us, yet he observed that all those things 
chiefly gratified the coarsest of our affections, such 
as our ambition, our particular pride, our avarice, 
our vanity, and our sensuality ; all which were, 
indeed, the mere product of the worst part of man, 
were in themselves crimes, and had in them the 
seeds of all manner of crimes ; but neither were re- 
lated to, or concerned with, any of those virtues that 
constituted us wise men, or of those graces which 
distinguished us as Christians ; that being now de- 
prived of all the fancied felicity which he enjoyed in 
the full exercise of all those vices, he said he was 
at leisure to look upon the dark side of them, where 
he found all manner of deformity ; and was now 
convinced that virtue only makes a man truly wise, 
rich, and great, and preserves him in the way to a 
superior happiness in a future state ; and in this, he 
said, they were more happy in their banishment than 
all their enemies were, who had the full possession 
of all the wealth and power that they, the banished, 
had left behind them. 

" Nor, sir," says he, " do I bring my mind to this 
politically by the necessity of my circumstances, 
which some call miserable ; but if I know anything 
of myself, I would not now go back, though the 
Czar, my master, should call me, and reinstate me 
in all my former grandeur ; I say, I would no more 
go back to it, than I believe my soul, when it shall 
be delivered from this prison of the body, and has 
had a taste of the glorious state beyond life, would 
come back to the gaol of flesh and blood it is now 
inclosed in, and leave heaven to deal in the dirt and 
crime of human affairs." 

He spoke this with so much warmth in his temper, 
vol. ii. — 20 [ 305 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



so much earnestness and motion of his spirits, which 
were apparent in his countenance, that it was evident 
it was the true sense of his soul ; there was no room 
to doubt his sincerity. 

I told him I once thought myself a kind of a 
monarch in my old station, of which I had given him 
an account, but that I thought he was not a monarch 
only, but a great conqueror ; for that he that has got 
a victory over his own exorbitant desires, and has the 
absolute dominion over himself, whose reason entirely 
governs his will, is certainly greater than he that 
conquers a city. "But, my lord," said I, " shall I 
take the liberty to ask you a question ? 11 — " With 
all my heart, 11 says he. — " If the door of your liberty 
was opened, 11 said I, " would you not take hold of it 
to deliver yourself from this exile ? 11 

" Hold, 11 said he, " your question is subtle, and 
requires some serious just distinctions to give it a 
sincere answer, and I ll give it you from the bot- 
tom of my heart. Nothing that I know of in this 
world would move me to deliver myself from this 
state of banishment, except these two ; first, the en- 
joyment of my relations ; and, secondly, a little 
warmer climate. But I protest to you, that to go 
back to the pomp of the court, the glory, the power, 
the hurry of a minister of state, the wealth, the 
gaiety, and the pleasures, that is to say, follies of a 
courtier ; if my master should send me word this 
moment that he restores me to all he banished me 
from, I protest, if I know myself at all, I would not 
leave this wilderness, these deserts, and these frozen 
lakes, for the palace at Moscow. 11 

"But, my lord, 11 said I, "perhaps you not only 
are banished from the pleasure of the court, and 
from the power, and authority, and wealth, you en- 
joyed before, but you may be absent too from some 
of the conveniences of life ; your estate, perhaps, con- 

[ 306 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



fi seated, and your effects plundered ; and the supplies 
left you here may not be suitable to the ordinary 
demands of life.'*'' 

" Ay," says he, " that is, as you suppose me to be 
a lord, or a prince, &c. So indeed I am ; but you 
are now to consider me only as a man, a human crea- 
ture, not at all distinguished from another ; and so 
I can suffer no want, unless I should be visited with 
sickness and distempers. However, to put the ques- 
tion out of dispute, you see our manner ; we are in 
this place five persons of rank ; we live perfectly 
retired, as suited to a state of banishment ; we have 
something rescued from the shipwreck of our for- 
tunes, which keeps us from the mere necessity of 
hunting for our food ; but the poor soldiers who are 
here, without that help, live in as much plenty as 
we, who go into the woods and catch sables and 
foxes ; the labour of a month will maintain them a 
year; and as the way of living is not expensive, so 
it is not hard to get sufficient to ourselves ; so that 
objection is out of doors." 

I have not room to give a full account of the most 
agreeable conversation I had with this truly great 
man, in all which he showed that his mind was so 
inspired with a superior knowledge of things, so sup- 
ported by religion as well as by a vast share of wis- 
dom, that his contempt of the world was really as 
much as he had expressed, and that he was always 
the same to the last, as will appear in the story I am 
going to tell. 

I had been here eight months, and a dark, dread- 
ful winter I thought it to be, the cold so intense, 
that I could not so much as look about without be- 
ing wrapped in furs, and a mask of fur before my 
face, or rather a hood, with only a hole for breath, 
and two for sight. The little daylight we had was, 
as we reckoned, for three months, not above five 

[ 307 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



hours a day, and six at most ; only that the snow 
lying on the ground continually, and the weather 
clear, it was never quite dark. Our horses were 
kept, or rather starved, underground; and as for 
our servants, for we hired three servants here to 
look after our horses and selves, we had every now 
and then their fingers and toes to thaw, and take care 
of, lest they should mortify and fall off. 

It is true within doors we were warm, the houses 
being close, the walls thick, the lights small, and the 
glass all double. Our food was chiefly the flesh 
of deer, dried and cured in the season ; good bread 
enough, but baked as biscuits ; dried fish of several 
sorts, and some flesh of mutton, and of the buffaloes, 
which is pretty good beef. All the stores of provi- 
sion for the winter are laid up in the summer, and 
well cured. Our drink was water mixed with aqua- 
vitae instead of brandy ; and for a treat, mead instead 
of wine, which, however, they have excellent good. 
The hunters, who venture abroad all weathers, fre- 
quently brought us in fresh venison, very fat and 
good ; and sometimes bear's flesh, but we did not 
much care for the last. We had a good stock of 
tea, with which we .treated our friends, as above; 
and, in a word, we lived very cheerfully and well 
all things considered. 

It was now March and the days grown consider- 
ably longer, and the weather at least tolerable, so 
the other travellers began to prepare sleds to carry 
them over the snow, and to get things ready to be 
going ; but my measures being fixed, as I have said, 
for Archangel, and not to Muscovy or the Baltic, I 
made no motion, knowing very well that the ships 
from the south do not set out for that part of the 
world till May or June, and that if I was there by 
the beginning of August, it would be as soon as any 
ships would be ready to go away, and therefore, I 

[ 308 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



say, I, made no haste to be gone, as others did ; in a 
word, I saw a great many people — nay, all the 
travellers — go away before me. It seems every year 
they go from hence to Moscow for trade, viz., to carry 
furs and buy necessaries with them, which they bring 
back to furnish their shops ; also others went of the 
same errand to Archangel, but then they also, being 
to come back again above eight hundred miles, went 
all out before me. 

In short, about the latter end of May I began to 
make all ready to pack up ; and as I was doing this, 
it occurred to me that seeing all these people were 
banished by the Czar of Muscovy to Siberia, and yet 
when they came there were left at liberty to go 
whither they would, why did they not then go away 
to any part of the world wherever they thought fit ? 
and I began to examine what should hinder them 
from making such an attempt. 

But my wonder was over when I entered upon 
that subject with the person I have mentioned, who 
answered me thus : " Consider first, sir," said he, 
" the place where we are, and secondly, the condition 
we are in ; especially," said he, " the generality of 
the people who are banished hither. We are sur- 
rounded," said he, " with stronger things than bars 
and bolts ; on the north side an unnavigable ocean, 
where ship never sailed, and boat never swam ; neither, 
if we had both, could we know where to go with them. 
Every other way,"" said he, 64 we have above a thousand 
miles to pass through the Czar's own dominions, and 
by ways utterly unpassable except by the roads made 
by the governor, and by the towns garrisoned by his 
troops, so that we could neither pass undiscovered 
by the road, or subsist any other way, so that it is in 
vain to attempt it." 

I was silenced indeed at once, and found that they 
were in a prison every jot as secure as if they had 

[309] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



been locked up in the castle at Moscow. However, 
it came into my thought that I might certainly be 
made an instrument to procure the escape of this 
excellent person, and that whatever hazard I ran, I 
would certainly try if I could carry him off. Upon 
this I took an occasion one evening to tell him my 
thoughts. I represented to him that it was very 
easy for me to carry him away, there being no guard 
over him in the country ; ana as I was not going to 
Moscow, but to Archangel, and that I went in the 
nature of a caravan, by which I was not obliged to 
lie in the stationary towns in the desert, but could 
encamp every night where I would, we might easily 
pass uninterrupted to Archangel, where I would 
immediately secure him on board an English or 
Dutch ship and carry him off safe along with me ; 
and as to his subsistence and other particulars, it 
should be my care till he could better supply himself. 

He heard me very attentively, and looked earnestly 
on me all the while I spoke ; nay, I could see in his 
very face that what I said put his spirits into an 
exceeding ferment ; his colour frequently changed, 
his eyes looked red, and his heart fluttered, that it 
might be even perceived in his countenance, nor 
could he immediately answer me when I had done, 
and, as it were, expected what he would say to it ; 
but after he had paused a little, he embraced me, 
and said, " How happy are we, unguarded creatures 
as we are, that even our greatest acts of friendship 
are made snares to us, and we are made tempters of 
one another ! My dear friend," said he, " your offer 
is so sincere, has such kindness in it, is so disinter- 
ested in itself, and is so calculated for my advantage, 
that I must have very little knowledge of the world 
if I did not both wonder at it and acknowledge the 
obligation I have upon me to you for it. But did 
you believe I was sincere in what I have so often said 

[310] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



to you of my contempt of the world ? Did you 
believe I spoke my very soul to you, and that I had 
really obtained that degree of felicity here, that had 
placed me above all that the world could give me, or 
do for me ? Did you believe I was sincere when I 
told you I would not go back, if I was recalled even 
to all that once I was in the court, with the favour 
of the Czar my master? Did you believe me, my 
friend, to be an honest man ? or did you think me 
to be a boasting hypocrite ? " Here he stopped as 
if he would hear what I would say ; but indeed I 
soon after perceived that he stopped because his 
spirits were in motion ; his great heart was full of 
struggles, and he could not go on. I was, I confess, 
astonished at the thing as well as at the man, and I 
used some arguments with him to urge him to set 
himself free ; that he ought to look upon this as a 
door opened by Heaven for his deliverance, and a 
summons by Providence, who has the care and dis- 
position of all events, to do himself good, and to 
render himself useful in the world. 

He had by this time recovered himself. " How do 
you know, sir," says he warmly, " that instead of a 
summons from Heaven it may not be a feint of an- 
other instrument, representing in all the alluring 
colours to me the show of felicity as a deliverance, 
which may in itself be my snare, and tend directly 
to my ruin ? Here I am, free from the temptation 
of returning to my former miserable greatness ; there 
I am not sure but that all the seeds of pride, am- 
bition, avarice, and luxury, which I know remain in 
nature, may revive and take root, and in a word, 
again overwhelm me ; and then the happy prisoner, 
whom you see now master of his soul's liberty, shall 
be the miserable slave of his own senses, in the full 
of all personal liberty. Dear sir, let me remain in 
this blessed confinement, banished from the crimes 

[311] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



of life, rather than purchase a show of freedom at 
the expense of the liberty of my reason, and at the 
expense of the future happiness which now I have in 
my view, but shall then, I fear, quickly lose sight 
of; for I am but flesh, a man, a mere man, have 
passions and affections as likely to possess and over- 
throw me as any man. Oh, be not my friend and 
my tempter both together ! 11 

If I was surprised before, I was quite dumb now, 
and stood silent, looking at him, and indeed admired 
at what I saw. The struggle in his soul was so 
great, that though the weather was extremely cold 
it put him into a most violent sweat, and I found he 
wanted to give vent to his mind ; so I said a word or 
two, that I would leave him to consider of it, and 
wait on him again, and then I withdrew to my own 
apartment. 

About two hours after I heard somebody at or 
near the door of my room, and I was going to open 
the door ; but he had opened it, and came in. " My 
dear friend, 11 says he, "you had almost overset me, 
but I am recovered ; do not take it ill that I do 
not close with your offer ; I assure you 't is not for 
want of a sense of the kindness of it in you, and I 
came to make the most sincere acknowledgment of it 
to you ; but I hope I have got the victory over 
myself." 

" My lord," said I, " I hope you are fully satisfied 
that you do not resist the call of Heaven." — " Sir, 11 
said he, M if it had been from Heaven, the same 
Power would have influenced me to accept it ; but I 
hope, and am fully satisfied, that it is from Heaven 
that I decline it ; and I have an infinite satisfaction 
in the parting, that you shall leave me an honest 
man still, though not a free man. 11 

I had nothing to do but to acquiesce, and make 
professions to him of my having no end in it but a 

[ 312 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



sincere desire to serve him. He embraced me very 
passionately, and assured me he was sensible of that, 
and should always acknowledge it ; and with that 
he offered me a very fine present of sables, too much 
indeed for me to accept from a man in his circum- 
stances ; and I would have avoided them, but he 
would not be refused. 

The next morning I sent my servant to his lord- 
ship with a small present of tea and two pieces of 
China damask and four little wedges of Japan gold, 
which did not all weigh above six ounces or there- 
about, but were far short of the value of his sables, 
which indeed when I came to England I found worth 
near £200. He accepted the tea and one piece of 
the damask and one of the pieces of gold, which had 
a fine stamp upon it of the Japan coinage, which I 
found he took for the rarity of it, but would not 
take any more, and he sent word by my servant that 
he desired to speak with me. 

When I came to him, he told me I knew what 
had passed between us, and hoped I would not move 
him any more in that affair ; but that since I had 
made such a generous offer to him, he asked me if I 
had kindness enough to offer the same to another 
person that he would name to me, in whom he had 
a great share of concern. I told him that I could 
not say I inclined to do so much for any one but him- 
self, for whom I had a particular value, and should 
have been glad to have been the instrument of his 
deliverance. However, if he would please to name 
the person to me, I would give him my answer, and 
hoped he would not be displeased with me if he was 
with my answer. He told me it was only his son, 
whom, though I had not seen, yet was in the same 
condition with himself, and above two hundred miles 
from him, on the other side the Obi ; but that if I 
consented, he would send for him. 

[ 313 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



I made no hesitation, but told him I would do it. 
I made some ceremony in letting him understand 
that it was wholly on his account and that seeing I 
could not prevail on him, I would show my respect 
to him by my concern for his son ; but these things 
are too tedious to repeat here. He sent away the 
next day for his son, and in about twenty days he 
came back with the messenger, bringing six or seven 
horses loaded with very rich furs, and which, in the 
whole, amounted to a very great value. His ser- 
vants brought the horses into the town, but left the 
young lord at a distance till night, when he came 
incognito into our apartment, and his father pre- 
sented him to me, and in short, we concerted there 
the manner of our travelling, and everything proper 
for the journey. 

I had bought a considerable quantity of sables, 
black fox-skins, fine ermines, and such other furs as 
are very rich ; I say, I had bought them in that city in 
exchange for some of the goods I brought from China ; 
in particular for the cloves and nutmegs, of which I 
sold the greatest part here, and the rest afterwards 
at Archangel, for a much better price than I could 
have done at London ; and my partner, who was 
sensible of the profit, and whose business, more par- 
ticularly than mine, was merchandise, was mightily 
pleased with our stay on account of the traffic we 
made here. 

It was the beginning of June when I left this re- 
mote place, a city, I believe, little heard of in the 
world ; and indeed it is so far out of the road of 
commerce, that I know not how it should be much 
talked of. We were now come to a very small cara- 
van, being only thirty-two horses and camels in all, 
and all of them passed for mine, though my new 
guest was proprietor of eleven of them. It was 
most natural also that I should take more servants 

[ 314 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



with me than I had before, and the young lord 
passed for my steward ; what great man I passed for 
myself I know not, neither did it concern me to in- 
quire. We had here the worst and the largest desert 
to pass over that we met with in all the journey ; 
indeed I call it the worst, because the way was very 
deep in some places, and very uneven in others ; the 
best we had to say for it was, that we thought we 
had no troops of Tartars and robbers to fear, and 
that they never came on this side the Obi, or at 
least but very seldom ; but we found it otherwise. 

My young lord had with him a faithful Muscovite 
servant, or rather a Siberian servant, who was per- 
fectly acquainted with the country, and led us by 
private roads that we avoided coming into the prin- 
cipal towns and cities upon the great road, such 
as Tuimen, Solikamsk, and several others, because 
the Muscovite garrisons which are kept there are 
very curious and strict in their observation upon 
travellers, and searching lest any of the banished 
persons of note should make their escape that way 
into Muscovy ; but by this means, as we were kept 
out of the cities, so our whole journey was a desert, 
and we were obliged to encamp and lie in our tents, 
when we might have had very good accommodation 
in the cities on the way. This the young lord was 
so sensible of, that he would not allow us to lie 
abroad when we came to several cities on the way, 
but lay abroad himself with his servant in the woods, 
and met us always at the appointed places. 

We were just entered Europe, having passed the 
river Kama, which in these parts is the boundary 
between Europe and Asia ; and the first citv on the 
European side was called Solikamsk, which is as 
much as to say, the great city on the river Kama ; 
and here we thought to have seen some evident al- 
teration in the people, their manner, their habit, 

[315] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



their religion, and their business ; but we were mis- 
taken ; for as we had a vast desert to pass, which by 
relation is near seven hundred miles long in some 
places, but not above two hundred miles over where 
we passed it, so till we came past that horrible place 
we found very little difference between that country 
and the Mongol Tartary ; the people most pagans, 
and little better than the savages of America ; their 
houses and towns full of idols, and their way of liv- 
ing wholly barbarous, except in the cities as above, and 
the villages near them ; where there are Christians, 
as they call themselves, of the Greek Church, but 
have their religion mingled with so many relics of 
superstition, that it is scarce to be known in some 
places from mere sorcery and witchcraft. 

In passing this forest, I thought indeed we must, 
after all our dangers were, in our imagination, es- 
caped, as before, have been plundered and robbed, 
and perhaps murdered, by a troop of thieves ; of what 
country they were, whether the roving bands of the 
Ostiaks, a kind of Tartars, or wild people on the 
bank of the Obi, and ranged thus far, or whether 
they were the sable-hunters of Siberia, I am yet at 
a loss to know ; but they were all on horseback, 
carried bows and arrows, and were at first about five 
and forty in number. They came so near to us as 
within about two musket-shot ; and asking no ques- 
tions, they suiTOunded us with their horse, and 
looked very earnestly upon us twice. At length 
they placed themselves just in our way, upon which 
we drew up in a little line before our camels, being 
not above sixteen men in all ; and being drawn up 
thus we halted, and sent out the Siberian servant 
who attended his lord to see who they were. His 
master was the more willing to let him go, because 
he was not a little apprehensive that they were a 
Siberian troop sent out after him. The man came 

[316] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



up near them with a flag of truce, and called them ; 
but though he spoke several of their languages, or 
dialects of languages rather, he could not understand 
a word they said. However, after some signs to 
him not to come nearer to them at his peril, so he 
said he understood them to mean, offering to shoot 
at him if he advanced, the fellow came back no wiser 
than he went, only that by their dress, he said he 
believed them to be some Tartars of Kalmuck, or of 
Circassian hordes ; and that there must be more of 
them upon the great desert, though he never heard 
that any of them ever were seen so far north before. 

This was small comfort to us ; however, we had 
no remedy. There was on our left hand, at about a 
quarter of a mile's distance, a little grove or clump 
of trees, which stood close together, and very near 
the road. I immediately resolved we would advance 
to those trees, and fortify ourselves as well as we 
could there ; for first, I considered that the trees 
would in a great measure cover us from their arrows ; 
and in the next place, they could not come to charge 
us in a body. It was indeed my old Portuguese 
pilot who proposed it, and who had this excellency 
attending him, namely, that he was always readiest 
and most apt to direct and encourage us in cases of 
the most danger. We advanced immediately with 
what speed we could and gained that little wood, 
the Tartars, or thieves, for we know not what to call 
them, keeping their stand, and not attempting to 
hinder us. When we came thither, we found to our 
great satisfaction that it was a swampy, springy 
piece of ground, and on the one side a very great 
spring of water, which running out in a little rill 
or brook, was a little farther joined by another of 
the like bigness, and was, in short, the head or 
source of a considerable river, called afterwards the 
Wirtska. The trees which grew about this spring 

[317] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



were not in all above two hundred, but were very 
large, and stood pretty thick, so that as soon as we 
got in we saw ourselves perfectly safe from the 
enemy, unless they alighted aud attacked us on foot. 
Hut to make this more difficult our Portuguese, with 
indefatigable application, cut down great arms of 
the trees, and laid them hanging, not quite cut off, 
from one tree to another, so that he made a con- 
tinued fence almost round us. 

We stayed here waiting the motion of the enemy 
sonic hours, without perceiving they made any mo- 
tion ; when, about two hours before night, they 
came down directly upon us ; and though we had 
not perceived it, we found they had been joined by 
some more of the same, so that they were near four- 
score horse, whereof, however, we fancied some were 
women. They came on till they were within half 
shot of our little wood, when we fired one musket 
without ball, and called to them in the Russian 
tongue to know what they wanted, and bid them 
keep off ; but as if they knew nothing of what we 
said, they came on with a double fury directly up to 
the wood-side, not imagining we were so barricaded 
that they could not break in. Our old pilot was 
our captain, as well as he had been our engineer, and 
desired of us not to fire upon them till they came 
within pistol-shot, and that we might be sure to kill, 
and that when we did fire we should be sure to take 
good aim. We bade him give the word of com- 
mand, which he delayed so long that they were, 
some of them, within two pikes 1 length of us when 
we fired. 

We aimed so true, or Providence directed our shot 
so sure, that we killed fourteen of them and wounded 
several others, as also several of their horses ; for we 
had all of us loaded our pieces with two or three 
bullets at least. 

[318] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



They were terribly surprised with our fire, and 
retreated immediately about one hundred rods from 
us, in which time we loaded our pieces again, and 
seeing them keep that distance, we sallied out, and 
catched four or five of their horses, whose riders, we 
suppose, were killed ; and coming up to the dead, we 
could easily perceive they were Tartars, but knew not 
from what country, or how they came to make an 
excursion such an unusual length. 

About an hour after they made a motion to attack 
us again, and rode round our little wood to see where 
else they might break in ; but finding us always 
ready to face them, they went off again, and we 
resolved not to stir from the place for that night. 

We slept little you may be sure, but spent the 
most part of the night in strengthening our situation, 
and barricading the entrances into the wood, and 
keeping a strict watch. We waited for daylight, 
and when it came, it gave us a very unwelcome dis- 
covery indeed ; for the enemy, whom we thought 
were discouraged with the reception they had met 
with, were now increased to no less than three hun- 
dred, and had set up eleven or twelve huts and tents, 
as if they were resolved to besiege us ; and this little 
camp they had pitched upon the open plain, at about 
three-quarters of a mile from us. We were indeed 
surprised at this discovery ; and now, I confess, I 
gave myself over for lost, and all that I had. The 
loss of my effects did not lie so near me, though they 
were very considerable, as the thoughts of falling into 
the hands of such barbarians at the latter end of my 
journey, after so many difficulties and hazards as I 
had gone through, and even in sight of our port, 
where we expected safety and deliverance. As for my 
partner, he was raging ; he declared that to lose his 
goods would be his ruin, and he would rather die than 
be starved, and he was for fighting to the last drop. 

[ 319] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



The young lord, as gallant as ever flesh showed 
itself, was for fighting to the last also ; and my old 
pilot was of the opinion we were able to resist them 
all in the situation we were then in, and thus we spent 
the day in debates of what we should do ; but towards 
evening we found that the number of our enemies 
still increased. Perhaps, as they were abroad in sev- 
eral parties for prey, the first had sent out scouts to 
call for help, and to acquaint them of the booty ; and 
we did not know but by the morning they might still 
be a greater number ; so I began to inquire of those 
people we had brought from Tobolsk if there was 
no other, or more private ways, by which we might 
avoid them in the night, and perhaps either retreat to 
some town, or get help to guard us over the desert. 

The Siberian, who was servant to the young lord, 
told us if we designed to avoid them and not fight, 
he would engage to carry us off in the night to a 
way that went north towards the Petrov, by which 
he made no question but we might get away, and 
the Tartars never the wiser, but he said his lord had 
told him he would not retreat, but would rather 
choose to fight. I told him he mistook his lord, for 
that he was too wise a man to love fighting for the 
sake of it ; that I knew his lord was brave enough 
by what he had showed already ; but that his lord 
knew better than to desire to have seventeen or 
eighteen men fight five hundred, unless an unavoid- 
able necessity forced them to it ; and that if he 
thought it possible for us to escape in the night, we 
had nothing else to do but to attempt it. He 
answered, if his lord gave him such orders, he would 
lose his life if he did not perform it. We soon 
brought his lord to give that order, though privatelv, 
and we immediately prepared for the putting it in 
practice. 

And first, as soon as it began to be dark we kin- 

[ 320 ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



died a fire in our little camp, which we kept burning, 
and prepared so as to make it burn all night, that 
the Tartars might conclude we were still there ; but 
as soon as it was dark, that is to say, so as we could 
see the stars, for our guide would not stir before, 
having all our horses and camels ready loaded, we 
followed our new guide, who, I soon found, steered 
himself by the pole or north star, all the country 
being level for a long way. 

After we had travelled two hours very hard it 
began to be lighter still, not that it was quite dark 
all night, but the moon began to rise, so that, in a 
word, it was rather lighter than we wished it to be ; 
by six o'clock the next morning we were gotten near 
forty miles, though the truth is we almost spoiled 
our horses. Here we found a Russian village named 
Kermazinskoy [? Kertchemskoy], where we rested, 
and heard nothing of the Kalmuck Tartars that 
day. About two hours before night we set out 
again, and travelled till eight the next morning, 
though not quite so quiet as before ; and about 
seven o'clock we passed a little river called Kirtza, 
and came to a good large town inhabited by Rus- 
sians, and very populous, called Ozomoys [?]. There 
we heard that several troops or hordes of Kalmucks 
had been abroad upon the desert, but that we were 
now completely out of danger of them, which was to 
our great satisfaction, you may be sure. Here we 
were obliged to get some fresh horses, and having 
need enough of rest, we stayed five days ; and my 
partner and I agreed to give the honest Siberian 
who brought us thither the value of ten pistoles for 
his conducting us. 

In five days more we came to Veuslima [?], upon 
the river Vychegda, and running into the Dwina ; 
we were there very happily near the end of our 
travels by land, that river being navigable in seven

days' passage to Archangel. From hence we came 
to Lawrenskoy [? Jarensk] the 3rd of July, and pro- 
viding ourselves with two luggage-boats and a barge 
for our own convenience, we embarked the 7th, and 
arrived all safe at Archangel the 18th, having been 
a year and five months and three days on the jour- 
ney, including our stay of eight months and odd 
days at Tobolsk. 

We were obliged to stay at this place six weeks 
for the arrival of the ships, and must have tarried 
longer had not a Hamburger come in above a month 
sooner than any of the English ships, when, after 
some consideration that the city of Hamburg might 
happen to be as good a market for our goods as 
London, we all took freight with him ; and having 
put my goods on board, it was most natural for me 
to put my steward on board to take care of them, by 
which means my young lord had a sufficient oppor- 
tunity to conceal himself, never coming on shore in 
all the time we stayed there ; and this he did, that 
he might not be seen in the city, where some of the 
Moscow merchants would certainly have seen and 
discovered him. 

We sailed from Archangel the 20th of August the 
same year, and after no extraordinary bad voyage 
arrived in the Elbe the 13th of September. Here 
my partner and I found a very good sale for our 
goods, as well those of China as the sables, &c, of 
Siberia; and dividing the produce of our effects, my 
share amounted to i/3475, 17s. 3d., notwithstanding 
so many losses we had sustained, and charges we had 
been at; only remembering that I had included in 
this about six hundred pounds'* worth of diamonds, 
which I had purchased at Bengal. 

Here the young lord took his leave of us, and 
went up the Elbe in order to go to the court of 
Vienna, where he resolved to seek protection, and 

[ 322 ]

where he could correspond with those of his father's 
friends who were left alive. He did not part with- 
out all the testimonies he could give me of gratitude 
for the service I had done him, and his sense of my 
kindness to the prince his father. 

To conclude. Having stayed near four months 
in Hamburg, I came from thence overland to the 
Hague, where I embarked in the packet, and arrived 
in London the 10th of January 1705, having been 
gone from England ten years and nine months. 

And here resolving to harass myself no more, I am 
preparing for a longer journey than all these, having 
lived seventy-two years a life of infinite variety, and 
learnt sufficiently to know the value of retirement, 
and the blessing of ending our days in peace. ,~
