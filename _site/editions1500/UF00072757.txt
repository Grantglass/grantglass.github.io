~THE
' LIFE

' t'DE' FOE \

DANIEL 'DE FOE was descended from a respect
able family in the county" of Northampton, and born
in London, about the year 1663. ' His father, James
Foe, was a butcher, in the parish of St. Giles's,.Cripo
plegate, and a protestant dissenter. Why the subject,
of this memoir prefixed the De to his family name
cannottnow be ascertained, .nor did he at any period
of his life. think it necessary to give his reasons to the
public. The political scribblers of the day, however,
thought proper to remedy this lack of information,
and accused him of posessing so little of the amor
patriaz, as to make the addition . in order that he
might not be taken for an Englishman; thongh this
idea could have had no other foundation than the
Circumstance of his having, in consequence of his
acalfor king William, attacked the prejudices of his
country'menin his 9' True-born Englishman." '

After receiving a good education at an academy at
Newington, young De Foe, before he had attained his
twenty-first year, commenced hiscareer as an author,
by writinga pamplet against a very'prevailing' senti--' '
ment in favour o the Turks, who were at 'hat time '
laying siegeto Vienna; This production, being very
inferior to those of his maturer years, was very little '
read, and the indignant author, deSpairing of success
with. his pen, had recourse to the sword; or, as he
termed it, when boasting of the exploit his latter
years, " displayed his attachment to liberty and. pro-.
testantism," .by joining the ill-advised insurrection
under the duke of Monmouth, in the west. On the
failure of that unfortunate enterprise, he returned'3 ' I LIFE OF DE FOE.

again to the metropolis; and it is not improbable,
but that the circumstance of his being a native of
London, and his arson not much known in that part
of the kingdom w ere therebeilion teak place, might
facilitate his escape, and be the means of preventing
his being brought to trial for his share in the transac-
tion. With the professions of a writer and a soldier,
Mr. De Foe, in the ear 1685, joined that ofa trader;
he was first engage as a hosier, in Cornbii], and af-
terwards as a maker of bricks and pantiies, near Tii~
bury Fort, in Essex; but in consequence of spending _
those hours in the hilarity 0f the tavern Which he
ought to have employed; in the calculations of the
countin <<house, his commercial schemes proved un~
success ul; and in 1694 he was obliged to" ahscond
from his creditors, not failing to attribute those ads
fortunes to the war and the severity of the times,
which were doubtless owing to his own misconduct.
It .is much to his credit however, that after having
been freed from his debts by composition, and being
in prosperous circumstances from King William's fa-
vour, he voluntarily paid most'of his creditors both
the principal and interest of their claims. This is
such an examp e of honesty as it would he unjust to
De Foe and to the .world to conceal. The amount
of the sums thus paid must have been very Consider.
able, as be afterwards feelingiy mentions to Lord
Haversham, who had repfoached him with covetous~
ness; "'~Witb a numerous faraaily, and no heips but '
, my own industry, I have forced my way through a <<

sea of misfortunes, and reduced my debts exclusive .
of composition, from seventeen thousand to less than
five thousepd pounds." ' j ' ' '
Atktiiefo'eiginning of the year 1700, Mr. De Foe

publishe'd'a satire in verse, which excited very cork
adorable-attention, called the " True-born English-
man." Its purpose was to furnish a reply to those
who were continuaiiy abusing KingWillia'm and some
of his friends asforeigners, by skewing that the pre-
sent race ofEng'iishmen was a mixed and 'heteroge.
' moss brood, scarcely any of which could "lay claim tog LIFE OF DE FOE, ' ' iii."

' native purity of blood. The satire was in many parts
very severe; and though 'it gave' hign ofl'enCe, it
claimed a considerable share of the public attention.
The reader will perhaps be gratrtied'by a specimen 0!
thisproducticn, wherein he endeavours to account

" What makes this'discontented land appear
Less happy now in times of peace, than war;
Why civil feuds disturb the nation more,
Than 'all our bloody wars had done before :

- Fools out of favour grudge at knaves in place,
And men are alWays honest in disgrace; _
The court preferments make men knaves in course,
But they, who would be in them, would be worse. .
'Tis not at foreignersthat we repine, ~ '
Would foreigners their perquisites resign:

The 'grand-Contention's plainly to be seen,
To get some men put out and some put in."

It will be immediately perceived that De Foe could
have no pretensions to the character of a. poet; but
he has, notwithstanding, some nervous and well-ver-
sified lines, and'in choice of subject and moral heis
in general excellent. The True-born Englishman
concludes thus: ' .

Could but our ancestors retrieve their fate,
' 'And see their offspring thus degenerate;

~ How we contend for birth and names unknown,
And build on their past actions, not our own;
They'd cancel records, and theirztombs deface,
And openly disown the vile degenerate race.
For fame of families is-all a cheat; . .. , _
'Trs PERSONAL vrn'rus ONLY MAKES us GREAT. - '

For this defence of foreigners De Foe _ was amply
rewarded by King William, who not only Ordered him
a'pension, but as his opponents denominated it, ap-
pointed him pampklet--wrz'ter general to the court,-
an office for which he was peculiarly well calculated,
possessing, with a strong mind and a ready wit, that
kind ofyieldiug conscience which allowed him to sup.

portthe measures of his benefactors though convinced
they Were injurious to his country. De Foe now re-
:tired to Newington with his. family, and for a short
time lived at ease; but the death or 'his royal patron
deprived-him of a generous protector, and opened a
scene of sorrow which probably embittered his future
life. ' ~
He had always discovered a great inclination to en-
gage in religious controversy, and the furious contest,
civil and ecclesiastical, which ensued on the accession
of QueenAnne, gave him an opportunity of gratify-.
ing his favourite passion; He therefore published a
tract entitled *' The shortest Way with the Dissenters,
or Proposals for the Establishment of the Church,"
which contained an ironical recommendation of per-
secution, hut written in so serious a, strain, that many
persons, particular Dissenters, at first mistook its
real intention. The high church party however saw,
and felt the ridicule, and by their influence, a prose-
cution was commenced against him, and a proClama-
tion published in the Gazette, offering a reward for

- much rigour himself and his pamphlet were about to
by treated, he at first secreted himself; but his printer
and bookseller being taken into custodody, he surren-
dered, being resolved, as he expressed it, " to throw
himself upon the favour of: government,' rather than
that others should be ruined for his mistakes'?' In .
July, 1703, he was brought to trial, found guilty, and
sentenced to be imprisoned, to stand in the pillory, and
to pay a fine of two hundred marks. He underwent
the infamous part of the punishment with great for-
titude, and it seems to have been generally thought
' that he was treated with unreasonable severity. So
far Was be from being ashamed of his fate himself,
that he wrote a hymn to the pillory, which thus ends,
alluding to his accusers: '

T'dl them, the men- that plac'd him here
Are scandals to the times;

Are at a loss to find his guilt, .

And can't commit his crimes.

Pepe, Who has thought fit to introduce him in his
Dunciad (probably from mother reason than part};
difference) characterises him'in the following line :"gi

Earless on high stood unabash'd De Foe.

This is one of those instances of injustice and malig.
nity which so frequently occur in the Dunciad, and
Which reflect more dishonour on the author than on
the parties traduced. . De Foe lay friendless and dis.
' treSsed in Newg'ate, his Family mined, and himself
without hopes of deliverance, till Sir Robert Harley,
who approved of his principles, and foresaw that dur~
ing a factions age such a genius could be converted
to many uses, represented his unmerited sufferings
to the Queen, and at length procured his release. The
treasurer, Lord, Godolphin, also sent a considerable
sum to his wife and family, and to him money to pay.
his fine and the eitpense of his discharge. Gratitude
and fidelity are inseparable from an honest mamand
it was this benevolent act that prompted De Foe to
support Harley, with his able and ingenious pen, when
Anne lay lifeless, and his benefactor in the vicissitude
of party was persecuted by faction, and overpowered,
though not conquered, by violence. _

The talents and perseverance of De Foe began;
now tgbc' preperly estimated, andfas a firm supporter
of theadministration, he was sent by Lord Godol-
phin to Scotland, on an' errand which, as he says, was

'far from being unfit for a. sovereign to direct or an
honest man to perform. Hislinowledge of commerce -
and revenue, his powers, of 'insinuation, and above
all his readiness of pen, were deemed of no'small
utility, in romoting the union of the two kingdoms;
of which lie wrote an able history, in 1709 with two
dedications, one to the Queen, and another to the
Duke of Q'ueensbury. 'Soon afterwards he unhappily,
by some equivocal writings, rendered himself su5pect>>
ed by both parties, so that he once more retired to
Newington in hopes of spending the remaider of his
days in' peace, His pension being withdrawn, and
_ wearied with politics, he began to compose works of
a different kind.----The year 1715 may therefore be re-
garded as the period of De Foe's political life. Fac-
tion henceforth found sother advocates, and parties
procured other writers to disseminate their sugges-
tions, and to propagate their falsehoods. ' . .
. In 1715 De Foe published the " Family Instruc-
torf," a work inculcating the domestic duties in a
lively manner, by narration and dialogue, and' 'dis-
playing much knowledge of life in the middle ranks
of society. " Religious Courtship" also appeared --
soon after, which, like the "Family Instructor," is
eminently religious and moral in its tendency, and
strongly impresses on the mind that spirit 'ofsobriety
and private devotion for Which the dissenters have.
generally been distinguished. The. most celebrated
of all his works, " The Life and Adventures of R0-
binson Crusoe," appeared in 1719}}."=','~I~'_his~ work has

in the most'easy and natural manner, together with
the excellency of the moral and religious reflections, '
render, it a performance of very superior and uncom-
mon merit, and one of the most interesting works
that ever appeared. It is strongly recommended by
Rosseau as a book admirably calculated to promote
the pu oses of natural education; and Dr. Blair
says, " o fictionin any language, was ever better
311meth than the adventures of Robinson Crusoe.
While it is carried on with. that appearance of truth
and simplicity, which takes a strong hold on the ima-
gination of all readers, it suggests, at the same time,
very useful instruction; by showing howmuch the
native powers of '* men may be exerted for surmount-
ing the difficulties of any external situation." It has
been'pretended, that De Foe surreptitiously appro-
priated the papers of Alexander. Selkirk, a Scotch
mariner, who lived four years alone on the island of
Juan Fernandez, and a sketch of whose story had
before ap ared in the voyage of Captain Woodes.
Rogers. ut this charge, though repeatedly and con-"
tidently brought, appears to be totally destitute of
any foundation. De Foe probably took some gene-
ral hints for his work from the story of Selkirk, but ~
there exists no proof whatever, nor is it reasonable
to suppose that he possessed any of his papers or
memorrs, which had been published seven years be-
fore the appearance of Robinson Crusoe. As a far- '
that proof of De Foe's innocence, Captain Rogers's

. Account of Selkirk may be produced, in which'it is

said that .the' latter had neither preserved pen, ink,
3'0! paper, and had in a great measure lost his lan-
guage ; consequently De Foe could not'have received
any written assistance, and we have only the assero,
tion of his enemies to prove that he had any-verbal.
The great success of Robinson Crusoe induced its

..author to write a number of other lives and adven-
, tures some of whxchwere popular in their times,

though at present nearly forgotten. One of his latest
publications was " A Tour through the Island of

\\

. ".0

' :' .. -. '
Great Britain,". a performance of very inferior rnerit;.
but De Foe 'was now the garralous old man, and his

' spirit (to use the words of an ingenious biographer)

"like a candle struggling in the socket, blazed and
sunk, blazed and sunk, till it disappeared at length in
total darkness". His laborious and unfortunate life
was finished on the 26th of April, 1731, in the parish
of St. Giles's, Cripplegate. -

l Daniel De Foe possessed very extraordinary ta-
lents; as a commercial Writer, he is fairly entitled to
stand in the foremost rank among his, co'tempora-
ties, whatever may be their performances or their

- fame. His distinguished characteristics are origina-

lity, spirit, and a profound knowledge of his subject,
and in these particulars he has seldom been surpassed.
As the author of Robinson CruSoe he has a claim
not only to the admiration, but to the gratitude of
his countrymen; and so long as we have a regard
for supereminent merit and take an interest in the
welfare of the rising generation, that gratitude will
not cease to exist. But the opinion of the learned
and ingenious Dr. Beattie will be the best eulogium
that can be. produced on that celebrated romance :
" Robinson Crusoe," says the Doctor, " must be ad-

' lowed by the most rigid moralist, to be one of those

novels. which one may read, not: only with pleasure
but'also with profit. It breathes throughout a Spirit

'of piety and benevolence; it sets in a very striking

light the importance of the mechanic arts, which they,

'who know" not what it is to be without them. are so

apt to undervalue; it fixes on the mind a lively idea
of the horrors of solitude, and, consequently of the
sweets of social life, and of the blessings we derive
from Conversation and mutual aid; and it shew's,
how, by labouring with one's own hands, one may
secure inde endence, and Open for one's self many
sources of realth and amusement. I. agree,'there-
fore, with Rosseau, that it is one of the best book

that can he put into the hands of children}? -_ m: _ _

' ROBIN-SOB? entrees. =

I WAS born in the year 1632, in the city of Y,o1k
of a good family though not of that country, my -
farther being a foreigner of Bremen, who settled first
at Hull; he. got a good estate by merchandise, and
leaving 01? his trade, lived afterwards at York, from
whence he had married my mother, whose relations
were named Robinson, in very good family 111 that

country, and from whom I was called Robinson .Jij.

Krutznaer , by the usual corruption of words in
England, we are now called, nay we call ourselves,
and write our name Crusoe, and so my companions
always called me.'

I had two elder brothers, one of which was lieu-
tenant~colonel to an English regiment of foot 1n Flan'
ders, formerly [commanded by the famous Colonel
Lockhart, and was killed at the battle near Dunkirk
against the Spaniards. What became of my second
brother I never knew, any more than my father or
mother did know what was become of me. '

Being,r the third son of the familv, and not bred to
any-trade, my'head began to be filled very early With
rambling thoughts: my father, who was very ancient,
' had given me a competent share of learning, as far
as house education and a country free-school gene-
rally go, and designed mefor-the law; but I would
be satisfied with nothing but going to sea; and my in-
. clination to this led me strongly against the will,
nay the commands of my father, and against all th
. entreaties and persuasions of my mother and Other
' friends, that there seemed to be something fatalin that
propension of nature tending directly to the life of
misery which was to be fatal to me. . ' -
My father, a wise and grave man, gave 'me serious
and excellent counsel again st what he foresaw was my
design. He called me one morning into his chamber,
where he was confined by the gout, and expostulated _
very warmly with me upon this subject: he asked
me what reason more than a mere wandering incli-
nation I had for leaving my father's house 'and my
native country, where I might be well introduced, and
had a prospect of raising my fortune by application
and industry, with a life of ease and pleasure. He
told' me it was for men of desperate fortunes on one
hand, or of aspiring superior fortunes on the other,
who went abroad upon adventures, to raise by enter-
prise, and make themselves'famous in undertakings of-
a nature out of the common road; that these things
"were all either, too far above me, or too far below
me; that mine was the middle state, or what might be
called the upper station of low life, which he had '
found by long experience was the best state in the
world, the most suited to human happiness, not ex-
- posed to the miseries and hardships, the labour and
sufferings of the mechanic part of mankind, and not
embarrased with the pride, luxury, ambition, and
envy of the upper part of mankind. He told me, I
might judge of the happiness of this state by this one
think, viz. that this was the state of life which all other
people envied; that kings have frequently lamented
the miserable consequences of being born togreat

things, and wish they had been placed in the middle
of the two extremes, between the mean and the great;
that the wise man gave his testimony to this as"the
. just standard of true felicity, when he prayed to have
, neither poverty nor riches. , '
He bid me observe it, and I should always find,
' that the calamities of life were shared among the up-
per and lower part of mankind; but that the middle
station had the fewest disasters, and was not exposed
- to so many vicissitudes asthe higher or lower part
of mankind ; nay, they were not subjected to so many
distempers and uneasinesses, either. of body or mind,
as those were, who by vicious living, luxury, and ex-
trava'gances, on one hand, or by hard labour, want of
necessaries, and mean or insufficient diet, on the other
hand, bring distempers upon themselves by the na-
tural. consequences .of their way of living; that the
middle station of life was calculated for all kind of
virtues and all kind of enjoyments; that peace'and
plenty were the handmaids of a middle fertune; that
temperance, moderation, quietness, health, society, all
. agreeable diversions, and all desirable pleasures, were
the blessings attending the middle station of life; that
this way men went silently and smoothly through the
world, and comfortably out of it, not embarrassed
with the labours of the hands or of the head, not sold
to the life of slavery for daily bread, or harassed with
perplexed circumstances, whichrob the soul of peace,
and the body of rest; not enraged with the passion
of envy, ' or secret burning lust of ambition for great
things; but in easycircums'tances slidinggently through
the world, and sensibly tasting the sweets of living,
without the bitter, feeling that they are happy, and
learning by, every day's experience to know it more
sensibly, . ' ~ . '

After' this, he pressed me earnestly, and in the most
affectionate manner, not to play the young man, not
to precipitate myself into miseries whichnature and
the station of life I was born in seemed to have pros
vided against ;' that I was under no necessity of seeku
ing, my bread; that he would do well for me, and
endeavour to enter me fairly into the station of life
which he had been just recumrneuding to me ; and
that if I ,was not very easy and happy in the world,
it must be my more fate or fault that must hinder it,
and that he should have nothing to answer for, having
thus discharged his duty in warning me against mono
sures which he knew would be to my hurt : in a word,
that as he would do very kind things for me if I would
stay. and settle at home as he directed, so he would
not have so much hand in my misfortunes, as to give
me any'encouragement to go away: and to close all,
he told me I had my elder brother for an example,
to Whom he had used the same earnest persuasions to '
keep him from going into the Low Country wars, but
could not prevail, his young desires prompting him to
run into the army, where he was killed; and though
he said he would not cease to pray for me, yet he
would venture to say to me, that if I' did take this
foolish step, God would not bless me, and I would
have leisure hereafter to- reflect upon having neglect-
ed his counsel when there might be none to assist in
my recovery. - .' - '

I observed in this last part of his discourse, which '
was truly prophetic, though I suppose my father did
not know it to be 'so himself; I say, I observed the
tears' run dOWll his face very plentifully, and espe.
cially when he spoke of my brother who was killed;
. and that when he spoke of my having leisure to re.
font, and none to assist me, he was so moved, that .
'rc broke off the discourse, and told me, his heartwas
so full that. he could do no more, .

I was sincerely affected with this discourse, as in.
deed who could be otherwise? and I resolved not 'to
think ofgoing abroad any more, butto settle at home
according to my father's desire. But, alas! a few days
wore it all off; and in short, to prevent any of my fa-
} ther's farther importunities, in a few week after I re-

solved to run quite away from him. However, I did
not act so hastily neither as my first heat of resolution.OF ROBINSON causes. a

prompted, but I took my. mother, at a time when I;

thought her a little pleasanter than ordinary, and told
her, that my thoughts were so entirely bent upon see-
ing the world, that I should never settle to any thing
with" resolution enough to go through with it, and my
father had better give me his consent than force- me
to go without it; that -I was now eighteen years old, "
which was too late to go apprentice to a trade, or clerk
to an attorney; that I was sure, if I did, I should
never serve out my time, and I should certainly run
away from my master before .my time was out, and
. go to sea ;- and if she would speak to mylfather to let
me go one voyage abroad, if I camehome again, and
did not like it, I would go no more, and I would pro-
miss by a double diligence to recover that time I, had -
lost. ' ' '

This put my mother into a great passion :. she told '
me, she knew it would be to no purpose to speak to
my father upon any such subject; that he knew too
well what was my interest to give his consent to any
such thing so much for my hurt; and that she won-
dered how I could think of any such thing after such
a discourse as I had had with my father, and such kind
and tender expressions as she knew my father had
used to me; and that, in short, if I would ruin my-
self, there was no help for me; but I might depend I
should never have their consent to it : that for her part
she would not have so much hand in my destruction;
and I should never haVe it to say, that my mother
was willing When my father was net. :

Though my mother refused to move it to my- father, -
yet, as I have heard afterwards, she reported all the
_ discourse to him, and that-my father, after showinga
great concern at it, said to her with. a sigh, "That'
boy might be happy if he would stay at home; but if
he goes abroad, he will be the most miserable wretch
that Was ever born; I can give no consent to it."

It was not till almost a year after this that I broke
loose, though, in the meantime, I continued obsti-
nately deaf to all proposals of settling to business, and
frequently expoetnlating' with my father and mother
about their being so positively determined against
what they knew my incnnati'on grompted me to. But .
being one day at Hull, whereI went casually, and with.
out any purpose of making an elopemen't that time;
but I say, being there, and one of my companions
being going by sea. to London, in his father's ship,'and
prompting mete go with them, with the. common al- ,
lurement of seafaring men, viz. that it should cost me
nothing. for my .passage,'I consulted neither father or
mother any more, not so much as sent them word of
it; but leaving them to hear of it as they might, with-
out asking God's. blessing, or my father's, without any
consideration of circumstances or consequences, and
in an ill hour, God knoWs, (in the first of, September,'
1651, I' went on board 'a ship bound for London.
Never any young adventurer's misfortunes, I believe,'
began sooner, or continued longer than mine. The
ship was no sooner gotten out of the Humber, but the
" *wind began to blow, and the waves to rise in a mosr
frightful manner; and, as I had never been at sea be-
fore, I was most inexpressibly sick in body, and ter-
rified in mind. I began how seriously to reflect upon
what I had done, and hear justly I was overtaken by
the judgment of Heaven for my wicked leaving. my
father's house, and abandoning my duty; all the good
counsel of my parents, my father's tears and my mo- '
ther's entreaties, came new fresh into my mind; and
my conscience, which was not yet come to the pitch
of hardnessto which it has been since, reproached me
with the contempt of advice, and the breach of my ~-
duty to God and my-'father.

All. this while the storm increased, and the sea,
which I had never been upon lie-fore, went very high,
though nothing like what I have seen many times
since; no, nor like what Isaw a few days after: but
it was enough to affect me then, who was but a young
sailor, and had never known any thing of themattei'.
I expected every wave would have swallowed us up,

' and that every time the ship fell down, as I thought,
in the trough or hollow of the sea, 'we should never
rise more; and-in this agony of mind I made many
vows and resolutions, that if it would please'God here
to spare my life this one voyage, if ever I got once
my foot upon dry land again I would go directly home
to my father, and never set it into'a ship again. while
I lived; that I would. take his advice, and never run
myself into such miseries as these any more. Now I
saw plainly the'goodness of his observations about the '
middle station of life, how easy, howcomfortably he
had lived all his days, and never had been exposed to '
tempests at sea, or troubles on shore ;, and I resolved
that~I would, like a true repenting- prodigal, go home
to my father. .

These wise and sober thoughts continued all the
while the storm continued,- and indeed some time af-
ter; but the next day'the wind was abated, and the
sea calmer, and I began to be. a little inured to it:
however, I 'was very grave for all that day, being also
a little sea-,sickstill; but towards night the weather
cleared up, the wind was quite over," and a charming >>
fine evening followed ,; the sun went down perfectly
clear, and rose so the next morning; and having little
or no wind, and a smooth sea, the sun shining upon
it, the sight was, as I thought, the most delightful that
ever I saw.

Iliad slept well in the night, and was now no more
sea-sick, but very cheerful, looking with wonder'upon
the sea that was so rough and terrible the day before,

. and could be so calm and so pleasant-in so little time
after, . And now, lest my good resolutions should
continue, my'compa'nion, who had indeed enticed me
away, comes to me : " Well, Bob," says he, (clapping
me upon the shoulder) " how do you do after it '? I
warrant you were frighted, wa'n7t you, last night,"when
it blew but a capfulof wind i"---" A capful do you call
it" ?" said I; " it was a terrible storm."----" A storm,
you fool you," replied he, " do you call that a storm ?
.why it was nothing at all; give us but a good ship
and sea-room, and we think nothing of such a squall 'of wind as that; but you're but a fresh-water sailor,
Bob. Come, let us make a bowl of punch, and we'll
' forget all that ;--,do you see what charming weather it
is new 3'" To make short this sad part of my story, we
went the old way of all sailors; the punch was made,
and I Was made drunk with it; and in that one night's
wickedness {drowned all my. repentance, all my. re.
fiections' upon my past conduct, and all my resolutions
for my future. In. a word, as the sea was returned to
its smoothness of surface and settled calmness by. the
abatement of that storm, so the hurry of my thoughts
being over, my fears and apprehensions of being swal-
low'ed up by the sea being forgotten, and the current.
of my former desires returned,'l entirely forgot the
,vows and promises that I made in my distress. I
found, indeed, some intervals of reflection, and the
serious thoughts did, as it were, endeavour to return
again sometimes; but I shook them ofi', and roused
myself from them' as it were from a distemper, and
' applying myself to drinking and company, soon mase
tered the return .of those ties, for so I called them; and
I had in five or six days {3.01. as complete a victory
over conscience, as any your-g fellow that resolved not
to be troubled with it could desire : but I was to have
another trial for it still; and Providence, as in such
cases generally it does, resolved to leave' me entirely
withdut excuse: for if I would not take this for a de-
liverance, the next 'was to be'such a. one as the worst
and. niost hardened 'wretch among us would confess
both the danger and the mercy. '.
' The. sixth day of our being at sea we came into "
Yarmo'uth Roads; the wind having been contrary, and
the weather calm, we' had made but little way since
the storm. Here we were obliged to' come toanchor,
and here we lay, the wind continuing contrary, viz.
at southwest, for seven, or eight days, during which
time a great many ships'from Newcastle came into
the'same roads, as the common harbour where the,
ships might wait-{for a wind for the river. '
We had not, beware)", rid here So long, but should

5
have tided it up the river, but that theiwind blew too
fresh ;' and after we had lain four or five days, blew
very hard.' However, the roads; being reckoned as-
good as a harbour, the anchoragegood', and our ground
tackle very'strong,>> ottr men were unconcerned, and
not in the least apprehensive of danger, but spent the,
time in rest and mirth, after the manner of the sea ;~
but the eighth day in the morning the wind increased,-
and we had all hands at work to strike our top-masts

and 'make every thing snug and close, that the ship
migh ride as easy as possible. - By noon the sea went
very high indeed, and our ship rid forecastle in,
shipped several seas, and we thought once or twice'
our anchor had come home; upon which our master
ordered out. the sheet anchor; so that we rode with
two anchors ahead, and the cables veered out to the
better end; . . . , ' _
' By this time it blew a terrible'storm indeed ;- and

now I began to see terror and amazement in the faces
even of the seamen themselves." The master, though
vigilant in the business of preserving the ship, yet as
he went in and out of his cabin by me, I could hear
him softly to himself say several times, " Lord be

merciful to us! we shall be all lost, we shall be all un-
done I" and the like. During these first hurries I was

stupid, lying still in my cabin, which was in the steer,-
age, and cannot describe my temper :.~ I could ill re-
assu'me the first penitence which I had'bn apparently
trampled upon, and hardened myself against? Ithought
the bitterness of death had been past, and that-this
would be nothing like the first: but when the master '
himself came by me, as I said just now, and said we
should be all lost, I was dreadfully frightened : I got up
out of my cabin, and looked out; but such a dismal
sight I never saw; the sea went mountains high, and
broke upon us every three or four minutes: when I V
couldlook' about, I could see nothing but distress round

us,-two ships that rid near us, we found had cut their

masts by the board, being deep loaden ; and our than
B 2 '

icried out, that a ship which rid about a miie ahead ,
'of us was foundered. Two more ships being driven
Yrom their anchors, were run out of the roads to sea,
' at an adventures, and that with not a mast standing.
The light ships fared the best, as not so much labour-
ing in the sea; but two or three of them drove, and
came close by. us, running away with only their sprit-

seil out before the wind. ' - ' ,

' Towards evening the mate and boatswain begged the
master of our ship to let them not aWay the foremost,
which he was very unwiiiing to do: but the boatswin
rotesting to him, that if he did not, the ship would
ounder, he consented; and when they had cut sway
the fore-mast, the. main-mast stood so loose, and
shook the ship so much, they were obliged to cut her

away also, and make a clear deck. . " '
Any one may judge what a condition I must he in
at all this, who was but a young sailor, and who had
been ii: such a fright before at but a, little. But if I
can express at this distance the thoughts I had about
me at that time, I was in tenfold more horror of mind
upon account of my format-convictions, and the he ving
returned from them to the resolutions 1 had 'wickodiy
taken at first, than I was at death itself;,, and these,
added to the terror of the storm, put 'me in such a con-
dition, that I can by no words describe it.>> But the
'vwrst- was not'come yet; the storm continued with
such fore, that the seamen themselves acknowledged
they had never known a. worse. We had a good ship,
' but she Was deep loaden, and wailowed in the see,
that the seamen every now and then cried out, she"
would founder. It was my advantage in one respect,
that 'I did not know what they meant by founder on
I inguited. However, the storm was so violent, that
I saw what is not often seen, the master, the boatswan,
and some others more sensible than the rest, at their
prayers, and expecting every moment when the ship
would go to the bottom. In the middle of the night,
and under all the rest of our distresses, one of the men
, that had been down on purpose to see, exi'ed out, we

- water in the hold. Then all hands were called to the
pump. At that very word my heart, as I thought, died
within me, and I fell backwards upon the side of my
bed where I sat, into the cabin. However, the men
roused me, and told me, that [that was able to do
nothing before, was as well able to pump as another:
at which I stirred up, and went to the pump and
worked very heartily. .While this was doing, the
master seeing some light colliers, who not able to ride
out the storm, were obliged to slip and run away to
sea, and Would come near us ordered to fire a gun as

a signal of distress. I, who knew nothing what that.

meant, was so surprised, that I thought the ship had
broke, or some dreadful thing happened. In a word,

I 'was so surprised, that I fell down in a swoon. As...>>

this was a time when every body had hisown life
think of, nobody minded me, or what was becon
of me; but another man stept up to tie pump, an

thursting me aside with his foot, let me lie, thinking

I had been dead; and it was a great while before I
came to myself. = . .

We worked on; but the water increasing in the.

hold," it was apparent that the ship would founder;
' and though the storm began to abate a little, yet as it
was not possible she could swim till we might run
into a port, so the master continued firing guns for
help; and a light ship who had rid it out just ahead
of us, ventured. a boat out to help us. ' It was with the
utmost hazard the boat came near us, but'it was im.
possible for us to get on board, or for the boat to lie
near the ship's side, till at laSt the men rowing ver'y
heartily, and venturing their lives to save ours, our
men cast them a rope over the stem with a buoy to it,
and then veered it out agreat length, which they after
great labour and hazard took hold of, and we hauled
them close under our stern, and got all into their
boat. It was to no purpose for them or us, after we
'were in "the boat, to think of reaching to their own
ship; ',so all" agreed to let her drive, and only to pull
her in towards shore as much as we could; andgour
master promised them, that if the boat was stived
upon shore he would make it good to their master:
.so partly rowing and partly driving, our boat went
away to 'the nothward, sloping towards the shore
almost as far as Winterton-Ness.

We were not much more than a ql'tiiarter of an hour
out of our ship but we saw her sin , and then I un-
derstood for the first time what was meant by a ship
foundering in the sea. I must acknowledge I had
hardly eyes to look up when the seamen told me she
was sinking; for from that moment they rather put
me into the boat, than that I might be said to go in;
my heart was, as it'were, dead within me, partly
with frighth, partly with horror of mind, and the
thoughts of what was yet before me. .

While we were in this condition, the men yet 1a.
homing at the oar" to bring the boat near the shore,
we could see, when our boat mounting the waves we
were able to see the shore, a great many people run-
ning along the shore to assist us when we should come
near; but we made but slow way towards the shore,
nor were we able toreach the shore, till being past
the light-house at Winterton, the shore falls off to the
westward towards Cromer, and. so the land broke off
a little the violence of the wind. Here we got in,-
and, though not without much difficulty, got all safe
on shore, and walked afterwards on foot to Yar-
mouth,' where, as unfortunate men, we were used--
with great humanity, as well by the magistrates of
the town, 'who assigned us good quarters, as by arc
ticular merchants and owners of ships, and ad
money given us sufficient to carry (is either to Lon-
don or back to Hull, as we thought fit.

Had I now had the sense to have gone back to Hall,
and have gone home, I had been happy, and my
father, an emblem of our blessed Saviour's parable, had
even killed the fatted calf for me ; for hearing the ship. K .went'awayin was cast away in Yarrnouth Roads, it
was a great while- before he had any assurance that I
was not drowned.
. But my ill fate pushed me on now with an obsti-
nacy that nothing could resist; and though I had se-
veral times loud calls from my reason and my more
Composed judgment to go home, yet I had- no power
to do it. I know nut what to call this, nor'will I
urge that it is a secret overruling decree that hurries
us on to be the instruments of our own destruction,
even though it be before us, and that we push upon it
with our eyes open. . Certainly nothing but somesuc'n
decreed unavoidable misery atttending, and which it
was impossible for me to escape, could have pushed
me forward against the calm reasonings and persua--
sions of my most retired thoughts, and against two
such visible instructions as I had met. with in my first
attempt. ' . " . ' .
My comrade, who had helped to harden me before
and who was the master's son, was now less forward
than I. The first time he spoke to me after we were
at Yarmouth, which was not till two or three days,
for we were separated in the town to several quarters;
I say, the first timehe saw me, it appeared his tone
was altered, and looking very melancholy, and shalt-
ing his head, asked me how I did, and telling his fa~
ther who I ~was, and howl had come this vo ago only
for a trial, in order to go farther abroad; iis father
turning to me with a. very grave andconc'erned tone,
" Young man," says he, " you ought never to go to
sea any more; you ought to take this for a plain and
visible token that you are not to be a seafaring man."
--" Why, Sir," said I, " will you go to sea no more?"
" That is another case," said he; " it is my calling,
and therefore my duty; but as you made this voyage
for a trial, you see what a taste Heaven has given you
of what you are to expect if you persist: erhaps this
is all befallen us on your account, like onah in the
ship of Tarshish, Pray, " continues he, " what are
you? and on what account did you go to sea?" Upon
that! told him some If my story ; at the end of which
he burst outwith a. straoge kind of passion; " What
had I done," says he, " that such an unhappy wretcfi
should .come into my ship? I would not set my foot
in the same ship with thee again for a thousand
ands." This indeed was, as I said, an excursion of

is spirits, which were yet agitated by the sense of his

loss, and was farther than he could have authority to .

go. However, he afterwards talked very gravely to
me, exhorting me to go back to my father, and not
tempt Providence to my ruin; told me I might see a
visible hand of Heaven against me. " And young
man," said he, " depend upon it, if you do not go
back, wherever' you go; you will meet with nothing
but disasters and disappointments, till your farmer's
words are fulfilled upon you." . "

We parted soon after; for I made him little answer,
and I saw him no more: which way he went,1 know
not. 'As for me, having some money in my pocket,
l-travelled to London by land: and there,-as well as
on the road, had many struggles with myself, what.
_ course of life I should--take, and whether I should
go home, or get to sea.

As to going home; shame opposed the best motions
that offered to my thoughts; and it immediately OCv
curred to me how! should he laughed at among the
neighbours, and should be ashamed to see, not my
father and mother "only, but even every body else;
from whence. I have since often observed, how ioeom
greens and irrational the'common temper of mankind
is, especially of youth, to that reason which ought to
guide them in such cases,viz. that they are not asham-v
ed to sin, and yet are ashamed to repent; nor ashamed
of the action for which they ought justly. to be esteem-
ed tools, but are,ashamed of the returning, which
only can make them be esteemed wise men.

In this state of life however I remained some time,
uncertain what measure to-take, and what course of
life to lead. An irresistible reluctance continued to
going home; and as I stored a while, the'remem-

urance of the distress'I had been in were off; and as
thatabated, the'little motion I had in my desires to a
return wore off with it, till at last I quite laid asule
the thoughts of it, and looked out for a voyage.

That evil influence which carried 'me first away ,
from my father's heuse, that hurriedme into the wild

' and indigested notion of raising my fortune; and that
impressed those conceits so forcibly upon me as to
make me deaf to all good advice, and to the entreaties
and even the command of my father: I say, the same
influence, whatever it was, presented the most unfor.
tunate of all enterprises to my view; and I went on
board a vessel bound to. the coast of Africa; or, as
our sailors vulgarly call it a voyage to Guinea.

It was my great misfortune that in all these adven-
tures I did not ship myself as a sailor; whereby,
though I might indeed have worked a little harder
than ordinary, yet at the same time I had learnt the
duty and ollice of a foremastman; and in time might
have qualified myself for a mate or lieutenant, if not
for a master. But as it was always my fate to
choose for the worse, so I did here ; for having money
in my pocket, and good clothes upon my back, I
would always go on board in the habit of a gentle-
man; and so I neither had any business in the ship,
or learnt to do any.

It was my lot first of all-to fall into pretty good
company in London, which does not always happen
to such loose and unguided young fellows as I then
was; the devil generally not omitting to lay Some
snare for them very early: but it was not so with me;
I first fell acquainted with the master of a ship Who'-
had been on the coast of Guinea; and who, having had
very good success there, was resolved to go again;:, _
and who taking a fancy to my conversation, which" '
was not at all disagreeable at that time, hearing me
say I had a mind to see the world, told me if I would
go the voyage with him I should be at no expense; I
should be his messmate and his companion; and if I
could carry any thing. with me, I should have all there use .ANo ADVENTURES:

friendship with ,the captain, who was an honest and
plain-dealing man, Iwent the voyage with him, and

- ', {Carried a small adventure with me, Which, by the dis

interested honesty of my friend the captain, Iincr'eas--
.-od_very'considerably'; for I carried about401. ihsueh
toys and trifies as the captain directed me to buy.
This 402, I had mustered together by the assistance of
some of my relations whom I corresponded with, and
who, 1,,helieve, got my father, or at least my mother,
to contribute so much as that to my first adventure.
' This was the only voyage which I may say was
' successful in all my adventures, and which I owe to
the integrity and honesty of my friend the captain,
under or om also I got a com etent knowledge of the
mathematics and the rules ofp navigation, learnt how
to keep an accountof the ship's course, take an obsera
vation, and, in short, to understand some things that
were needful to he understood by a sailor: for, as
:he took delight to instruct me, I took delight to learn;
and, in a Word, this voyage made me both a sailor
:end a merchant: for I brought home five pounds nine-
.ounces of gold--dust for my adventure, which yielded
me, in London at my return almost 3002. and thisfil>>
, - led me with those aspiring thought-s which have so

.oompleted my ruin. .

' Yet even in this voyage I had my misfortunes too;
particularly, that I was continually sick, being thrown
into a wolent calenture by the escessive heat of the:
' .olimate ;, our principal trading being upon the coast.
[reaffthe latitude of 35 degrees north even to the line
itse . ,

I was now set up for a Guinea trader; and my
friend, to my great misfortune, dying soon after his
:arrival, I resolved to go the same voyage again, and
it embarked in the same vessel with one who washis
mate in the former vo age, and had now got the com-

mode! the ship, ' his was the unhappiest voyage
that ever man made; for though I did not carry quite
1002. of my new-gained wealth, so that I had, 2001. left,
and which" I lodged with my friend's widow, who was .
very just to me, yet I fell into terrible misfortunes in .
this voyage; and the first was this, viz. our ship mak-
ingher course towards the Canary Islands, or rather '.
between those islands and the African shore, was-sur-
prized in the grey of the morning by a Turkish rover
' of Sauce, who gave chase to us with all the sail she
could make. 'We crowded also as much .can'vass as
our yards would spread; or our masts carry, to have
got clear; but finding the pirate gained upon us, and
would certainly come up with us in a few hours, we
prepared to fight; ourship'having twelve guns, and
the rogue eighteen. About three in the afternoon he
came up with us, and bringing to by mistake just '
athwart our quarter, instead nfathwart our stern, as
he intended, we brought eight of our guns to bear on
that side, and poured in a broadside upon him,_'which
made him sheer off again, after rewriting our fire,
and pouring in'also his small-shot from nearly 200 men
which he had On board. However, we had not a man
touched, all our men keeping close. He prepared to
attack us again, and we to defend ourselves; but lay-
ing us on board the next time upon our other quar-
' ter, he entered sixty men upon our decks, who immeo
diately fell to cutting and hacking the decks and rig-
ging. We plied them with small shot, lialf4pikes,
powder-chests, and such like, and cleared our deck .
of them twice. However, to 'cut short this melan-
choly part of our story, our ship being disabled, and
three of our men killed and eight wounded, we were
obliged to yield, and were carried all prisoners into
Sallee, a port belonging to the Moors. _
The usage I had there was not so dreadful as at first
I apprehended; nor was I carried up the country to
the emperor's court, as the rest of our men were, but
was kept. by the captain of the rover as his proper
prize, and made his slave, being young and nimble.

and fit for his business. At this surprising change of
O ' ,. _

i.
my circumstances, from a merchant to a miserable
slave, I was perfectly overwhelmed ; and new I look,
ed backupon' my father's prophetic discourse to me,
that} should be miserable, and have none to relieve
me, which I thought was now so effectually brc'mght to
grass, that I could not be worse; that now the hand of
fewer: had overtaken'me, and I was undone with
out redemption: but alas 3 this was but a taste of the
misery I was to go through, as will appear in the .
sequel of this star . , -

As'my new patron, or master, had taken me home
to his house so I was in hopes that he'would take me"
with him when he went to sea again, believing-that it

would some time or other be his fate to be taken by a
Spanish. or Portugal man of war; and that then I
should be set at liberty. But this hope of mine was
soon' taken; away; for when he went to sea, he left me
on shere to look after his little garden, and to do the
common drudgery of slaves about his house; and
when he came home again from his cruise, he ordero
ed me to lie in the cabin to look after the ship.

Here I meditated nothing but my escape, and what
method I would take to effect it, but found no way-
that had the least probability in it 2' nothing presented:
to make the supposition of it rational; for I hadno--'
body to communicate it tothat would embark with me,
no follow slavemoEngiishmau, Irishman, or Scotsman
there but myself ; so that forum years, though I often
pleased myself with the imagination, yet I never had
the leastencouraging prospect of putting it in practice,

After about two years an odd circumstance 'presentJ
ed itself, whichput the old thought of making some
attempt for my liberty again in my head: my patron
lying at home longer than usul without fitting out his
ship, which, as I heard, was for want- of money, he
used constantly, once or' twice a'weelt, sometimes
oftener, if the weather was fair, to take the ship's
pinnace and go out into the road a~fishing; and as he
always took me and a young Maresco with him to

- tow the boat, we made him very merry, and I proved
very dexterous in catching fish; insomuch that some-'
times he would send me with a Moor, one of his
kinsmen, and the youth the Maresco, as they called.
him, to catch a. dish of fish for him. - _ '
. It happened one time, that going aafishing in a stark
calm morning, a fog ruse so thick, that though we
were not half a league from the shore we lo'st sight of
it; and rowing we. knew not whither or which way,
we laboured all day, and all the next night, and when
the morning came we found we had pulled off to sea
instead of pulling in for the shore; and that. we were
at least two leagues from the shore : however, we got
well in again, though with a great deal of labour and
some danger; for the wind began to blow pretty fresh
in the morning; but particularly we were all very
hungry. _ ' _ .' :-

'But our patron, warned by this disaster, resolvedto
take more care, of himself for the future; and, having
lying by him' the long-boat of our English ship he had
taken, he resolved he would not go a-fishing any more
without a compass and some provision ; so he ordered
the carpenter of his ship, who also was an English
slave, to build a little state-room, or cabin, in the
middle of the long-boat, like that of a barge, with a
place to stand behind it to steer and hale home the
main--sheet: and room before for a hand or two to
stand and work the sails: she sailed with what we call
a shoulder of mutton sail; and'the boom gihed over
the top of the cabin, which lay very snug and low,
and-had in it room for him to lie, with a slave or two,
and a tableto eat on, with some small lockers to put -
in some bottles'of such'liquor as he thought fit to '

,drink; particularlv his bread, rice and coffee.

We went frequently out with this boat a-fishing, and
as I- was most dexterous to catchfish for him, he never
went without me. It happened that he had ap ointed
to go out in this heat, either for pleasure or or fish,
with twoo'r' three Moores of some distinction in that
place, and for whom he had provided extraordinarily, .

_ and hadtherefore sent on board the boat over-night a}
larger store of. provisions than ordinary; and had or'
dered me to get ready three fusees with powder and
shot, which were on board his ship; for that they de-
signed some sport of fowling as well as fishing."

I got all things ready as he had directed, and waited
the next morning with the boat washed clean, her
ancient and pendants out, and every thing to accumu-
modate his guests; when by and bye my patron'came
on board alone, and 'told me his guests had put off
going, upon some business that fell out, and ordered
me with the man and boy, as usual, to go out with
the boat and catch them some fish, for that his friends
- were to sup, at his house; and commanded that as
soon as I got some fish I should bring it home to his
house; all which I prepared to do.. V

This 'moment my former- n'otions of deliverance
darted into my thoughts, for now i found I was like
to have a little ship at my command; and my master
being gone, I prepated to furnish myself, not for fish-
ing business, but for'a voyage; though lknew not.-
neither 'did I so much as consider, whither I should
steer; for any way to get out of that place was my
way. .
My. first contrivance was to make a pretence to
speak to" this Moor, to get something for our subsist-
ence on board; for I told him we must not presume
to' eat of our patron's bread; he said, that was true:
so he brought a large basket of rusk or hisket'bf their
kind, and three jars with fresh water, into the boat.
I. 'knew where my patron's case of bottles stood, '
which it was evident, by the make, were taken out at
some English prize, and I conveyed them into the
boat while the Moor was on shore as if they had been.
there before for our master-r: Iconveyed also a great
Inn: of bees-wax into the boat, which weighed above '
hal ,a hundred weighs. with'a parcel of twine or
thread, a hatchet, a saw, and a hammer, all which
, were of great .4158 to us afterwards, 'es ecially the

was Ismael, whom they call Muly, or Moley; so I
' called to him: '" Moley," said I, " our patron's guns
are on board the boat ; can you not get a little powder

the, " I'll bring some ;" and ace rdinglyhe broughta
' 'great leather pouch which .hel about a pound and a
half of powder, or rather more; and another with
shot, that had five or six pounds, with some bullets,
and put all into the boat: at the same time I had
found some powder of my master's in the great cabin,
with which 1 filled one of the large bottles in the case,
which was almost em pty,' pouring what was, in it into
another ; and thus furnished with every thing'needful,
we sailed out of the port to fish. The castle, which
is <<at the entrance of the port, knew who we were,
and took no notice of us: and we were not above a
mile out of the port before we baled in our sail, and
set-"us down to fish. The wind blew from'the N.N.E.
which was contrary to my desire; for had it blown
southerly,iI had: been sure to have made the coast of
Spain, and at least reached to the bay of Cadiz; but
my resolutions were, blo'w which way it would, I
would be gone from that horrid place where I was,
and leave the rest to fate. . '
After we had fished some time and catched nothing,
for when I had fish on my hook I would not pull
'them up, that he might not see them, I said to the
Moor, " This will not do ; our master will not be thus -
served; we must stand farther ofi'." He,.thinking no
harm, agreed, and being in the head of the boat 'set
the sails; and as I had the helm I run the boat out
near a league farther, and then brought her to as if I
wOuld fish; when giving the boy the helm, I stepped
'forward to where the Moor was, and making'as if I
steeped for something behind him, I took him by suru

be taken in, told me he would go all over the world
with me.' He swam so strong after the boat, that he
would have reached me very quickly, there being but .~

' little wind; upon which I stepped into the cabin, and '

fetching ,out one of 'the fowling--pieces, I presented it
at him, and told him, lhad done him no hurt, and if .

.he would be quiet I woulddo him none: " But," said
I, "you swim Well enough to reach to the shore, and
the'sea is calm; make the best of your way to shore,
and I will do you no harm; but if you come nearthe
boat I'll shout you through the head, for I am resolved
to have my liberty ;" "so he turned himself about,
and swam for the shore, and Imake no doubt but
he reached it with ease, for he was an excellent
swimmer. ' '

. I could have been content to have taken this Moor
with me, and have-drowned the boy, but there was
no, venturing to trust him. When he was gone 1
turned to the boy, whom theycalled Xury, and said
to him, " Xury, if you will be faithful to me I'll
make you a great man; but if you will not stroke '-
your face to be true to me," that is, swear by Maho-

met and his father's heard, I must throw you into
the sea too." The boy smiled in my face, and Spoke-
so innocently, that I could not mistrust him; and
swore to be faithful to me, and go all over the world
with me.

. While I was in view, of the Moor that was swim-

- ming, I stood out directly to sea. with the boat, rather
stretching to windward, that they might think'me -
gone towards the Strait's mouth ; (as indeed any one
that had been in their wits must have been supposed
to do) for who would have supposed we were sailed
on to the southward to the truly barbarian coast,
where whole nations of Negroes were sure to sur-
round us'with their canoes, and destroy us; where >>
we could. never once go on shore but we should be
devoured by savage beasts, or more merciless savages

'of human kind? ' '

But as seen as it grew dusk in the evening,'l
' changed my course, and steered directly south and by

cast, bending my course. a little toward the east, that}
might keep in with the shore ; and having a fair, fresh
gale of wind, and a smooth, quiet sea, I made such
s'ail that I believe by the next day at three o'clock in
the afternoon,'when [first made the land,I could not

be less than 150 miles south of Sallee; quite beyond

the Emperor'of Morocco's dominions, or indeed cf
any other king thereabouts, for we saw no people. '

" Yet such was the fright I had taken at the Moors,
and the dreadful apprehensions I had of falling into
their hands, that I would not stop, or go on'shore,' 6r
Come to an anchor; the wind continuing fair till I
had sailed in that manner five days; and then the
wind shifting to the'southward, I concluded also that
if any of our vessels were in chase of me, they also
would now give over; so I ventured to make to the
coast and come to an anchor in the mouth of a little
river, I knew not what, or where; neither what lati-
tude, what country, what nation,- or what riVer; I'
neither saw, nor desired to see any people ; the princi-
pal thing I wanted was fresh water. We came into
this creek in the evening, resolving to swim on shore
as soon as it was dark, and discover the country; but
as soon as it was quite dark, we heard such dreadful
noises of the barking, roaring, and howling of'wild
creatures, of we knew not of what kinds, that the poor
boy was ready to die with fear, and beget] of me not
to go on shore till day. " Well, Xury," said I,

" then I won't; but it may be we may see men by' . ,
day, who will be as bad to us as those lions."----- '

" Then we give them the shoot gun," says Xury,

_, laughing, ".make them run wey." Such English

Xury spoke by conversing among us slaves. How-'

. ever, I was glad to see the boy so cheerful, and I'gave

him a dram (out of our patron's case of bottles) to
cheer him up. After all, Xury's advice was good,
and I took it; we dropped our little anchor, and lay
still all night; I say still, for we slept none; for in
two or three hours we saw vast great creatures (wee: Lilo: AND ADVEiV'i'URES.

knew not what to call them) of many Sorts,come
down to the seaLshor'e and ruzrinto the water wallow-
ing and washing themselves for the pleasure of cool~
iiig themselves; and they made such hideous howlinge
and yellings, that I never indeed heard thelike.

Xury was dreadfully frightened, and indeed so was
hoe; butwe were both more frighted when we heard
tone of these mighty creatures come swimming ten
wards our boat; we criuld not ,see him, but we might
hear him by his blowing to be a monstrous huge and
; furious beast; Xury said it was a. lion, and it might

be so for ought I,kn0w; but poor Xury cried to me
to weigh the anchor and row away: " No," says I,
" Kory ; we 'can- slip our cable with the buoy to it,
end go off to sea; they cannot follow us fan??? I had
no sooner said so than I perceived the creetureIwhat-
ever it was) within tivo oars' length, which some>>
thing surprised me; however, I immediately stepped
. to the cabin-door, and taking up mygnn fired at him;
upon which he immediately turned about, and swam
_ towards the. shore again. .-

But it is impossible to describe the horrible noises,
and hideous cries and howlings, that were raised, as
well upon the edge of the shore as higher within the
eouo'try, upon the noise or report of the gun, a thing
I have me reason to believe these creatures had
. never he rd before: this convinced me there was no
going on shore for us in the night upon that coast,
arid how, to venture'On shore in the day was another
question too; for to have fallen into the hands of any.
of the savages, lied beenas bad as to have fallen into

the hands of lions and tigers; at least we are equally
apgrehensive of the danger of it. . -,

e that as it would; we were obliged to go on shore
somewhere or other for water, for we had not a pint
left in the boat; when or where to get it, was the
point: Xury said, if I would let him go on shore with
one of the jars, he would find if there was any water.
and bring'some to' me. I asked him why he would
go? why Isliould not go, and heme)? inthe boat?mua~.mw ~ '

The boy answered with so much afi'ection,-that made

fine love him ever after. :Says he, " If wild mans
come, they eat'me, you go wey.3'---" Well, Xury,"
said I, " we will koth go, and if the wild mans come,
we Will kill them, they shall eat neither ofusl.' So I
gave. Xury a piece of rusk bread to eat, and a dram
out of .our atron's case of bottles. which, I mentioned
before; an we haled the boat in as near the shore as
we thought was proper, and 'waded on shore; carry--
ing nothing but ourarms, and two jars for .water.

I did not care to go out of sight of the boat, fearing
the coming of canoes with saVages down the river:'
but the boy seeing a low place about a mile up the
country, rambled to it; and by and by I saw him
come running rewards me. I thOught he was parsuetl
by some savage, or frigh'ted with some wild beast,'and'

I run forward towards him to help him; but when I

" camenearer to him, I 'saw something hanging over his -
shoulders, which was a creature that he had,shot,
like a hare, but'difi'erent in Colour, and longer legs; .
however, we' were very glad of it, and it was very
good meat; but the great joy that poor Xury came
with, 'was to tell me that he had found'good water,
and seen. no wild mans.

But we found afterwards that we need not take
such pains for water, for a little higher up the creek
where we were, we found the water fresh when the.
tide was out, which flows but a little way up; so we
filled our jars, and feasted 'on the hare: we had killed,
and prepared to go on our way, having seen no foot~
steps of any human creature in that part of the coun-

'. try. - .
As I had been one voyage to this coast before, 'I.

7 knew very well that the islands of the Canaries, and /
i , the Cape de Verd islands also, lay not far; off. from 7/
the coast. But as I had no instruments to take-arr

them, or when to stand off to sea towards them;
other-Wise I might now easily have found some of

these-islands. But my ho e was, that if I stood along '

this .coast til} I Came to t at part where the English
traded, I should find some of their vessels upon their
penal design oftrade, that would relieve and take as

m. .- . .
By the bestof my calculation, that place where I

now was, must be that country, which, lying between

~ the emperor of Morocoo's dominions and the Negroes,
lies waste, and uninhabited, except by wild boasts;
the negroes having abandoned it, and gone farther
sooth for fear of the Moors ; and the Moors not think--
ing it worth inhabiting, by reason of. its barrenness;
and indeed both {creaking it because of the prodigi~

ous number of tigers, lions, leopards, and other furio,

ous creatures which harbour there ; so that the Moors
use if for their hunting only, where they go like an
army, two or three thousand men at a time; and in<<
deed for 'near an hundred miles together upon this
' coast, we saw nothing but a waste uninhabited ooun~
try by day, and' heard nothing but howlings'and
roaring of wild beasts'by night; - , '
Once or twice in the daytime I thought I saw the
'Pioo of Tenerifi'e, being the high mp of the Mountain
Tenerifi'e in the Canaries; and had a greatmind to

ventureout in hopes of reaching thither ;.--but having.

tried twice, I was forced in again by: contrary winds,
the sea also going too high for my little vessel; so I
. resolved to pursue my first design, and keep along
the shore. ' . .-
Several times I was obliged to land for fresh Water,
after we had left this place; and once in particular,

being early in the morning, we came to an anchor-

_ under a little point of land which was pretty high ;
= and the tide beginning to flow, we lay" still to go
farther in. Xury, ,wiiose eyes were more about-him
' than it seems mine were, calls softly to 'me, and tells
me that we had best go farther ofi' the shore; " for,"
says beg? look yonder lies a dreadful monster'ontho

r
side of that hillock fast asleep." I leaked where'he
pointed, and saw a dreadful monster indeed, fer it
was a terrible great lion that lay on the side of the
shore, under the shade of a piece of the hill that hung
as it were a little over him. " Xury," says I, " you
shall go On shore and kill him." Xury looked fright-
ed, and said, " Me kill l he eat me at one month ;."
one mouthful he meant: however, I said no more to
the boy, but had him lie still, and I took our biggest .
gun, which was almost musket-bore, and loaded it '

with a good charge of powder, and with two slugs,
'and laid it down; then' I loaded another gun'with

two bullets; and the third, for we had three pieces, I
loaded with five smaller bullets. I took the best aim

.I could with the first piece to have shot him into the

head, but he lay so Witlhhis leg raised a little above
his nose, that the slugs hit his leg about the knee", and
broke the bone. He started up growling at first,-but

- finding his leg broke fell down again, and then got up

upon three legs, and gave the most hideous roar that
ever Iheard. I was a little surprised that 1 had not

hit him on the head ; however, I took up the second

piece immediately, and though he began to move off,
fired again, and shot him into the head, and had the
pleasure to see him drop, and make but little noise,
but lie struggling for life. Then Xury took heart,
and would have me let him go on shore: " Well, go,"
said I; so the boy jumped into the water and taking
a little gun .in one hand, swam to shore with the
other hand, and coming close to the creature, put the.
muzzle of the piece to his ear, and shot him into the,

' head again, which dispatched him quite.

This was game indeed to us, but this was no food;
and -I was very sorry to lose three charges of powder
and shot upon a- creature that was good for nothing to
us. However, Xury said he would have some of
him; so :he comes on board, and asked me to give
him the hatchet. " For what, Xury i'?' said I, '.' Me
cut oil" his head," said he. However, Xury couldriot out off his head, but be out ofi' a foot, and brought
it with him, and it was a. monstrous great one.

I bethought myself however, that perhaps the skin
of him might one. Way or' other be of- some value to
as; and I resolved to take off his skin if I could.
So 'Xurv and I went to work with him; but Xury
was' much the better workman at it, for I knew very
in how to do it. Indeed it took us up mm the whole
day, but at last we got off the hide of him, and
spreading it on the tap of our cabin, the sun effectu-
afiy dried it in two [days time, and it afterwards
served me to lie upon.'_ '

'Ai'ter this stop, we made on to the southward con-
tin'utmy for ten- or twelve days, living very sparing

"on our provisions, which began to abate very much;
and gomg no oftener into the shore than we were
obliged to for fresh water: my design in this was, to
make the river Gambia or Senegal, that is to say, any
where about the Cape do Vera, where I was in hopes
to meet with some European ship; and if I did not,
I knew not what oourse I hadto take, but to seek for
the isiands, or perish there among the Negroes. I
knew that all the ships from Europe, which sailed
either to the coast of Guinea or to Brazil, or to the
East Indies, made this Cape, or these islands; and
in a word, I put the whole of my fortune upon this
single point, either that'I must meet with some ship
or must perish. . _'

. When I had pursued this resolution about ten days ~
longer, as I-have said, I began to see'that the land '
was'inhabited; and in two or three places}, as we

' sailed by, we saw people stand upon the shore to look

at us; we could also perceive they were quite black,
and stark naked. 'I was once inclined~ to have gone
on shore to them; butqu was my better counsellor,

and said. to me, " No go, no go," . However, I
hauled in nearer the shore that I might talk to them.
and I found they run along the share by me a. good-
way': 1 observed they had no weapons in their hands,
except one, who had a long slender stick, which
Xury said was, a lance, and that'they would throw
them a great way with good aim; so I kept at a dis:
tance, but talked with them by signs as well as I
could; and particularly made signs for something to
eat; they beckoned to me to stop my boat, and they
would {etch me some meat. Upon this I lowered the
top of my sail, and lay by, and two of them ran up
into the'country, and in less than half an hour came
back, and brought with them two pieces of dry flesh
and some corn, such as is the produce of their coun-
try; but we neither knew what the one nor the other
was : however, we were willing to acceptlit, but how
' to come at it'was our next disPute, for I was not for
venturing on shore to them, and they were as much
afraid of'us; but they took-a safe way for us all, for
they brought it to the shore and laid it down, and
' went and stood a great way off till we fetched it'on .
board, and then came close to us again. .
We made signs of thanks to them, for 'ive had
nothing to make them amends; but an opportunity
\ offered that very instant to oblige them wonderfully;
for while we were lying by the shore came two
mighty creatures, one pursuing the other (as we tool;
it) with greatfury from the mountains towards the
sea ;.whether it was the male pursuing the female
or whether they were in sport or in rage we could not
tell, any more than we, could tell whether it was usual
or. strange, but I believe it was the latter; because, in
the first place, those ravenous creatures seldom appear
but in the nightgand in the second. place, we fortnd the
people terribly frighted, especially the women. The
man that had the lance or dart 'did notfly from them,
but the rest did; however, as the two creatures ran
directly into the water they did not'seem- to ofi'er to
fall upon any of the Negroes, but plunged themselves -
into the sea and swam about as if they had'come {or '
their diversion. At last one of them began to come .
nearer 'our boat than at first I exPected; butI lay

ready for him,-- for 1 had loaded my gun with all has:
sible expedition, and bad Xury load both the others :'
as 'soon as he came fairly within my reach Ifired, and
shot him directly into the head>>; immediately he
,. sunk down into the water, but rose instantly, and
plunged up and down as-if- he was struggling ferlife;

'and' so indeed he was; he immediately made to the

shore; hut between the wound, which was his mor

tal hhrt, and the strangling of the water, he died jus
' before he reached the share. ; x "

It is impossible to expreSs the astonishment of thee
poor creatures at the noise and the fire of my gun;
some of them were even ready to die for fear, and
fell down as dead with the.very terror. 'But when

' they saw the creature dead, and sunk in the water,
and that I made signs to them to Come to the shore,
they took heart and came to the shore, and began to
search for the creature. I found him by hisblood
staining the water, and by the help of a rope, which I
slung round him, and gave the Negroes to hale, they
dragged him on shore, and found that it was a most
curious le0perd, spotted and fine to an admirable de-
~ gree, and the Negroes held up their hands with admi-
ration to think what it was'I had'kiiled him with.

. -.The other creature, frighted with the flash of fire
and the noise of the gun, swam on shore, and ran up
directly to the mountains from whence they came,
nor could I at that distance "know what it was. I
found quickly the Negroes were for eating the flesh of
this creature, so I was willing to have them take it as '
a favour from me, which, when I made signs to them"
_ that they might take him, they were very thankful
for. Immediately they fell to work with him, and
though they had no knife, 'yet with a sharpened piece
of wood they took off his skin as readily, and much
more readily, than we could have done with a' knife
They offered me same of the. flesh, which I declined,
makingas if I would give it them, but made signs fer
the skin, which they gave me very freely, and brought
me a great deal more of their provision, which.
though I did not understand, yet I accepted; then X
made signs to them for some water, and held out one
of my jars to them, turning it bottom or wards, to
show that it was empty, and that I wante to have it
filled; They called immediately to 'some of their
friends, and there came two women, and brought a.
great vessel made' of earth, and burnt, as I Suppose,
in the sun; this they set dawn for me, as before, and

'I sent Xury on shore with my jars, and filled them
all three. The women were as stark naked as the
men. ,. - .

I was now furnished with roots andcorn, such as
it was, and water; and, leaving my friendly Negroes,.
I made forward for about eleven days more, without
offering to go near the shore, till -I saw the land run
out a great length into the sea, at about the distance
of four or five leagues before me; and, the seabeing'
'very' calm, I kept a large offing to make this point;
at length, doubling the point at about two leagues.
from the land, I saw plainly land on the other side to
seaward;. then I concluded, as it was most certain
indeed, that this was the Cape (le 'Verd, and those
the islands, called from thence Cape de Verd Islands.
However, they they were at a great distance, andl
could not well tell what I had best to do, for if I shOuld
be taken-with a fresh of wind I might neither reach
one nor the other.

In this dilemma, as Iwas very pensive,l stepped into
the cabin and sat me down, Xury having the helm,
when on: a sudden the boy cried out, " Master,
Master, 3. ship-with a sail 2'? and the foolish boy was
frighted- out. of his wits, thinking it must needs be
some of his master's ships sent to pursue us, when I
knew we were gotten far enough out of their reach.
I jur'n'ped out of the cabin, and immediately saw not
only the ship, but what she was, viz. that it was a
Portuguese ship, and, as I thought, was bound to the
coast of Guinea for Negroes. But when I observed
the course she steered, I was soon convinced they
were bound some other way, and did not design to
some any nearer'to the shore; upon which I stretched
out to sea as much as I eculd, resolving to speak with
' them if possible. . ' .

With all the sail I could make, 'Ifound I should
not be able to come in theirway, but that they would

{3e gone by before I could make any signal to them ;

. ut; after I had "crowded to the utmost, aud began to
despair, they, it seems, saw me by the help of their
'perspeCtive-glasses, and that~ it Was some Eumpean
boat, which as they supposed, must belong to some
ship thatwas lost; so they shortened sail'tolet'me
come up. - I was encouraged with this; and as 1 had
my patron's ancient on board, I made a waft of it to
them fora signal of distress, and fired a gun, both
which they'saw, for they told me they saw the smoke,
though they did not hear the gun : upon these signals
they verykindly brought to, and lay'by for me, and
in about three hours time I came up with them. '

_ They asked me what I was in Portuguese, and in
Spanish, and in French ; but I understood none of '
them; but at last a Scots sailor, who was on board,
called to me, and I answered him, and told him I
was an Englishman, that I had made my escape out
of slavery from the Moors at Salee.' Then they. had
me come on board, and very kindly took me in, and
all my goods. .. ~ ~ .

It was an inexpressible joy to me, that any one.
would believe that I was thus delivered, as I esteemed
it, from sueh~a-miserable and almost .hOpeless con-
dition as I was in, and immediately ofl'ered all 1 had to
the captain 'of the ship, past a return 'for my deliver- '
anee; but he generously told me, he would take no-
thing from me, but that all I had should be delivered
- safe to me when I came to the Brasils; " Form. say
he, " I have saved your life on no other terms than '

I would be glad to besaved myself; and it maymre ,

time or other, be my lot to be taken u in the same

condition. " Besides, said he, "' when carry you to
the Brasils, so great a way from your own country,
if Isho'uld take from you what you have, you will be
, starved there, and thenI only take away that life);
have given. No, no, Seignor Ingese," says he, 'F Mr.
Englishman, I will carry you thither in charity, and
those things Will help you to buy your subsistence
there, .and your passage home again." .

As he was charitable in his proposal, so he was just
in the' performance to a tittle; for he ordered the sea-
men, that none should ofi'er to touch any thing I had:
then he took every thing into his own possession, and
gave me'back an exact inventory of them, that'I might
have them ; even so much as my three earthen jars.

As to my boat, it'was a very good one, and that he
saw, and told me he would buy it of me for the ship's '
"use, and asked me what I would have for' it? I told
him, he had been so generous to me in every thing,
that I could not offer to make any price of the host,
but left it. entirely to him ;' upon which he told me ne
would give me a note of his hand to pay me eighty
pieces of eight for it at Brasil; andwhen it came
' there,- if any One offered to give more, he would make
It up: he offered me also sixty pieces of eight more
for my boy Xury, which I was, loath "to take; aot _
that I was not willing to let the captain have him,
'but I was very loath to sell the poor boy's liberty,
' who had assisted me so faithfully in procuring my
- own. However, when I let him know my reason, he
owned it to be just, and offered me this medium, that
- he would give the boy .an obligation to set him free in
ten years, if he turned Christian. Upon this, and
Xury saying he was tvillingto go to him, I let the
ca tain have him. . ' ' . - .

. e had a very good voyage to the Bi'asilsgjand are
rived in the Bay de .Todos los'Santos,' or All Saints'
Bay, in about twenty-two days after. And now I
was once more delivered from the most miserable of
, all conditions of life; and what to do next with my-
self I was now to consider. . -

The generous treatment the captain gave me,I can
_ never enough remember ;, he would take nothing of
me for my passage, gavg rge twenty ducats for the

leopard's skin, and forty for. the lion's skin, which I
had-in my boat, and caused every thing I had in the
.ship to be punctually delivered me; and what I was
willing to sell he. bought, such as the case of bottles,
two of my guns, and' a iece of the lump of bees-
wax, for I had made can les of'the rest: in a word, '
I made about two hundred and twenty pieces of eigl-t
of all my cargo; and with this stdck I went on shor'
in the Brasils. ' . '

I had'not been long here, but being recommended"
to the house of a good honest man like himself, who
had an ingez'no as they call it; that is, a- plantation
and a sugar-house; I lived with him some time, and
acquainted myself by that means with the manner of
their planting and making of sugar; and seeing how
well the planters-lived, and how they grew rich sud-
denly, I" resolved, if I could get license to settle there,
I would turn planter among them, resolving, in the
mean time, to find ,out some way to get my mOney,
- which I had left in London, remitted to me. To this
. purpose, getting a kind of a letter of naturalization, I
purchased as much land that was uncured as my
money would reach, and formed a plan for my plan-

' . tation and settlement, and such a one as might be-

suitable to the stock which I preposed to myself to

i receive from England. . ~

I had a neighbour, a Portuguese of Lisbon, "but
born of English parents, whose name was Wells, and
in much'such circumstances as I was. I'call him
neighbour, because his plantation. lay next to mine,
and we'Went'on-very sociable together; My 'stock
- was but. low, as well as his: and 'we rather planted
for food than any thing else, for about two years.
However, we began to increase, and our land began
to Come into order; so that the third year" we planted
some tobacCo, and made each of us a; large piece of
ground-"ready for planting cube in the year to come;
but we both wanted 'help; and now I found, more...
' 't'qan before, I had done wrong in'pa'rting'with my

boy Xury. 'a'

or ROBINSON CRUSOE 35

- But, alas !- for me to do wrong, that never did right,
was no great wonder: I. had no remedy but to go on;
I was gotten into an employment-quite remote to my
genius, and directly contrary to the life I delighted in,
. and for which I forsook myfather's house,' and broke
through all his good advice; nay, I was coming into
the very middle station, or upper degree of . low life,
which my father advised me to before; and which if
' I resolved to go on' with, I might as well have staid at
home, and never have fatigued myself in the world as
I had done ; and I used often to say to myself, I
could have done this as well in England amongst my
friends, as havegone five thousand miles off to doiit,
among strangers and savages in a wilderness, and at
such distanae, as 'never to hear from any part of the
world that had the least knowledge of me. -
- In this mannerI used to look upon my condition
with the 'utmost regret. I had nobody to converse
with, but now. and then this neighbour; no work to
he done, but by the labour' of my hands; and I used
to say, I lived just like a man cast away upon same
desolate island, that had nobody there but himself.
But how just has it been, and how should all men
reflect, that, when they compare their present condi<<
tions with: others that are worse, Heaven may oblige

them to makethe exchange, and be convinced of their - , "

former felicity, by their experience; I say, how just
has it been, that the truly solitary life I reflected on in
an island of mere desolation should be my lot, who
had so often unjustly compared it with the life which
I then led, in which had I continued, I had in all
probability been exceeding prosperous and rich. _._

I was in some degree settled in my measures for
carrying on the plantation, before my kind friend'the
captain of the ship, that took me up at sea, Went
back; for the ship remained there, in providing his
loading, and preparing for his voyage, near three
months; when, telling him what little stOckl had left
behind me in London, he gave me this friendly and
sincere adviee: " Seignor Inglese," says he, {or sohe
always called me, " if you will give me letters, and a
procuration here in form to me, with orders to the
person who has'your money in London, to send your
eti'ects to Lisbon, to such persons as I shall direct, and
in such goods as are preper 'for this country, I will
bring you the prodhce of them, God willing, at my
return; but since human afl'airs are all subject to
changes and disasters, I would have you give orders
but for one hundred pounds sterling, which you say
is half your stock, andlet the hazard be run .for the.
first; so that if it comes safe, you may order the
rest the same way; and if it miscarry, you may have
the other halfrto have recourse to for your supply."

This was so wholesome, advice, and looked so
friendly, that I could not but be convinced itwas the
best course I could take; so I accordingly, prepared
letters to the gentl'ewoman with whom I hadsleft my
money, and a procuration to the Portuguese captain,
as he desired. ~ ' - - " . , ~

I wrote the English captain's widow a full account
of all my adventures, my slavery, escape, and how I

.had met with the Portugal captain at sea, the huma-
nity of his behaviour, and what condition I was now
in, with all other necessary directions for my supply;
and when this honest ca tain came to Lisbon, he found
means, by'some of therl'i'nglish "merchants there, .to
send over, not the order only, but a full account of_
my story to a merchant at Lendon, .who represented
.it effectually to her; whereupon, shenot only deliver.~
ed themoney, but out of her own pocket sent the
Portugal captain a very handsome present for'his hu-
manity and charity to me. , _

The merchant in London vesting this ,hundred
pounds in English goods, such as the captain had ,'writ
for, sent them directly to him at Lisbon, and he
brought them all safe to me to the Brasils;_. among
which, without my direction (for I was too young in
my business to think of them) he had taken care to
have all sorts oftools, ironwork, and utensils necessary
for my plantation, and Which were of great use to me.IVhen this cargo arrived, I thought my 'fditune.

made, for I was surprised with joy of it; and my "Z i

good steward the captain had laid out the five pounds
which my. friend had sent him ,for- a present for him-'
self, to purchase, and bring me over a servant under
bond for six years service, and would not accept of any
consideration, except a little tobacco, whichI would
,have'him accept, being of my own produce. - '- '
. Neither was this all; butany goods being all Eng
ish manufactures, such as cloth, stuffs, baize,.a'nd
things particularly valuable and desirable in the coun-
try, I found means to sell them to a very greatadvan-
tage; so that I may say, I had more than four times
the value of my first cargo, and was now infinitely
beyond my poor neighbour, I mean in the advance-
ment of my plantation; for the first thing I did, I
bought me a Negro .slave, and an European servant
also; I mean another besides that which the captain-
brought me from Lisbon. ' .
But as abused prosperity is oftentimes'made the

very means 'of our greatest adversity, so'was it with
me. I went on the next year with great success in
my plantation: Iraised fifty great rolls of tobacco on
my own ground, more than I had disposed of for
necessaries among my neighbours; and these fifty
rolls, being each of above one hundred weight, were
-' well cured and laid by against the return of the fleet
from Lisbon. And now, increasing in business and
in wealth, my head began to be full of projects and
undertakings beyond my reach; such as are indeed
often the ruin of the best heads in business.

. Had I continued in the station I was now in, I had -
com for all .the happy thingsto have befallen me,
or which my father so earnestly recommended a
quiet retired life, and of which he had so sensibly de-.
scribed the middle station of life to be full; but other.
, things attended me, and I was still' to be the wilful
agent of all my own miseries; and particularly to in-.
crease my fault, and double the reflectionsupon mye'
self, which in 'my future sorrows I'should have leisure
' to make; all these miscarriages were procured'by my
apparent obstinate adhering to my foolish inclination
of wandering abroad, and pursuing that inclination,
in contradiction to the clearest views of doing myself
' good in a fair and plain pursuit of those prospects
_ and those measures of life, which nature and Provi

dence 'concurred to present me with, and to make my
dut . J .

Ays I had done this in my breaking away from my
parents, so I could not be content now, but I must go
and leave the happy view I had of being a rich and
thriving man in my new plantation, only to pursue a
rash and immoderate desire of raising faster than the
nature of the thing admitted; and thus I cast myself .

down again into the'deepest gulph of human misery
that ever man fell into, or erhaps could be consist.
em with life and a state of ~ ealth in the world;

To come then by just degrees to the particulars of
this part of my story; you may su pose, that having
now lived almostfour years in the rasils, and begin>>,
ning to thrive and prospervery well upon my plan-
tation, I had not only learnt the language, but had
contracted acquaintance and friendship among my
fellow4planters, as well as among the merchants atSt.
Salvadore, which was our port ;' and that in my dis-
course among them, I had'frequently given them an
account of my two voyages to the coast of Guinea,
the manner of trading with the Negroes there, and
'how easy it was to purchase upon the coast, for tri-
fles', such as beads, toys, knives, scissars,' hatchets,

. bits of glass, and the like, not only gold-dust, Gui-
nea grains, ele hants teeth, &0. but Negroes for the
service of the rasils in great numbers. _

They listened always very attentively to my dis-
courses on .these heads, but especially to that part -
which related to the buying Negroes, which. was a
trade at that time not only in entered into, but,
. as far as it was, had been carried on by the Assientos

bu-,.o.oC/ . . .....

~ . n. .-_r......_
or permissionof the kings of Spain and Portugal, and
engrossed in the public, so that few Negroes ,were
bought, and those excessrve dear.- . ' ._
It happened, being 'in company With some mer-

chants and planters of my acquaintance, and talking
of those things very earnestly, threeof them came to
me the next morning, and told me they had been"
musing fiery much upon what I had discoursed with
them of, the last night, and they came to make

, secret proposal to me ; and after enjoining me secrecy,
they told me, that'they had a mind to fit out a Ship to
.go to. Guinea; that they had all plantations as-well as . ~
1, and were straitened for nothing so much as serg ~
vents; that as it was a trade could not be carried on,
because they could not ublicly sell the Negroes'when
they came home, so. t ey desired to make but one
voyage, to bring the Negroes on shore privately, and
divide the-.3 amongtheir-own plantations; and in a
word, the question was, whether I would go their su-
percargo in the ship, to manage the trading part upon
the coast of Guinea? and they offered me that I
should have my-equal share of the Negroes, without
providing any part of the stock. . --. 1--

This was a fair proposal, it must he confessed, had

it been made to any one that had not had a settle-
ment and plantation of his own to look after, which
was in a fair way of coming to be very considerable,
and with a good stock upon it. But for me, that was
thus entered and established, and had nothing to do
but go on as I had begun, for three'or four years
more, and to have sent for the other hundred pounds
from England, and-who in that time, and withfthat
little addition, Could scarce have failed of being worth
three or four thousand pounds sterling, and that in.
creasing too; for me to' think of . such a voyage, was
the most'preposterous thing that ever. man in such
circumstances could" be guilty of. .

. But I, that was born to be my .own destroyer,

_ could l-nornore resist the offer, than I could restrain .
my. first rambling designs, when. my father's good"
. counsel was lost upon me; In a wOrd, I told them I
would go with all my-heart,tif they would Undertake '
to look after my plantation'in my absence, and would
dispose of it to such- as I should direct if I miscarried.
This they all engaged to do, and entered into writings
or covenants. to. do so ;, and I made a formal will,
di8posing of my plantation and eflfects, in case'of my '
death, making the captain of the ship that had save ,.
my life as before, my'universal heir, but 'obliging him
to dispose of my efi'ectsas I had directed in my will;
one half of the produce being to; himself, and the
other to be shipped to England, . a
In short I took all possible caution to reserve my
effects, and keep up myiplantation: ha I used half'
as much prudence to have looked into my own inter-
est, and have made a judgment of what I ought to .
' have done, and not to have done, I had certainly
never gone away from so prosperous an undertaking;
leaving all the probable views of a thriving circum-
'Stance, and gone upon a voyage. to sea, attended with
all its common hazards; to say nothing of the reasons
I had to eXpect particular misfortunes to myself.

But I'was hurried on, and obeyed blindly the die-
tates of my fancy rather than my reason : and accord:
ineg the ship. being fitted out, and the cargo furnish-
ed, and all things done as by agreement by my part.-
ners in the voyage, I went on' board in .an evil hour,
the lst of September, 1659, being the same day eight
years that I went from my father and mother atHull,
in-order to act the rebel to their authority, and the
fool tomy own interest.

Our ship was about one hundred and twenty tons
burden, carrying six guns, and fourteen men, besides
the master,- his boy, and myself; we had-on board no
large cargo of goods, encept of such toys as were. fit
for our trade- with the Negroes, such as beads, bits of
glass, -'shells, and odd trifles, especiallylittle looking-
glasses, knives, scissors, hatchets, and the like. -

The same day I went on board we set sail, stand- .
ing away to the northward upon our own coast, with
design to stretch over for the African coast; when
they came about 10 or lwegre'es of. northern latitude,
,which'it seems. was the manner of their course in
those daysl We had very good weather, only exces-
sive hot, all the way upon our own coast, till we made
the height of Cape St. Augustine, from whence keep-
ing'farther off at sea we lost sight of land, and steered
as if we were bound for the isle Fernahd de Noronha
holding our course N. E. by N. and leavingpthos

-' isles on the east. In this coursewe passed the line in
about twelve days time, and were by our last obser-
vation in 7 degrees 22 min. northem latitude, when a

-violent tornado or hurricane took us quite'out of our.
knowledge ; it began from the south-east, came about
to the north-West, and then settled into the north-east,
fron'r whence it blew in such a terrible'manner, that
for twelve days tbgether 'we could 'do nothing bot
drive; and scudding away before it, let it carry .us
whither ever fate and the fury of the winds directed;
and during these twelve days, I need notsay that I
expected every day to be swallowed up, nor indeed
did any in the ship expect'to save their lives. '

In this distress, we had, besides the terror of the
storm, one of our men die' of the calenture, and one
man and the boy washed overboard; about the 12th
daythe weather abating a little, the master made an
observation as well as he could, and found that he was
in about 11 degrees north latitude, but that he was 22
degrees of longitude' difference west from Cape St.
Augustine; so that he found he was gotten upon the
coast of Guinea, or the north part of Brasil, beyond
the river Amazones, toward that of the river Oro-
noque, commonly called the Great River, and be-
gan to consult with me what course he should take,
for' the ship was leaky and very much disabled, and '

. he was going directly'back to the coast of Brasil. '

I was positively against that, and looking over the

charts of the sea-coast of America with him we con-

. eluded there was no inhabited country for us to have

recourse to, till' we came within the circle of the
.4
Carribhee islands, and therefore resolved to stand
away fer Barbadoes, whic'i'h' by keeping of at sea, to
-_ avoid the indraft of the "bay or gulf of Mexico, we
might easily perform; as we heped, in about fifteen
days vsail; whereas we could not possibly make our
voyagegto the coast of Africa without someassist-
ance, both to our ship and ourselves. '
. With this design we changed our course, and steer
ed away N. W. by W. in order to reach some of on
English islands, where I hoped for relief; but our
voyage was otherwise determined; for being in the
latitude of12 deg. 18 min. a second storm came upon
Us, which carried us away with the same impetuosit
westward, and drove us scout of the very way of a
human commerce, that had all our lives been saved,
as to'the see, we were rather in danger of being de-
. voured by savages than ever returning to our own
country. ' -

In this distress, the wind still blowing very hard,
one of our men early in the morning cried out, Land!
and we had no sooner run out of the cabin to look
out in hopes of seeing whereabouts in the world 'we-
were, but the ship struck upon a sand, and in a mo-
ment, her motion being so stopped, the sea broke over'
her in such a manner, that we expected weshould
all 'have perished immediately; and we were imme-
diately driven into our close quarters to shelter us
from the very foam and spray of the sea.- --

It is not easy for any one, who has not been in the ..
. like condition, to describe or conceive the censterna-
tion of men in such circumstances; we knew nothing
where we were, or upon what land it was we were
driven, whether an island or the main, whether inha
bited or not inhabited; and as. the rage. of the wind
was still great, though rather lessthan at first, we
c'Ould not so much as hope to have the ship hold many
minutes without breaking in pieces, unless the winds
by a kind of miracle should turn immediately about.
In a word, we sat looking one upon another, and ex.
' .pecting death every moment, and every man acting, , '
accordingly, as preparing for another world, for there
was little Or nothing more for us to do in this; that
which was our present comfort, and all the comfort
we had, was, that contrary to our expectation, the
ship 'did not break yet, and that the master said the
wind began to abate.
' Now though we-thoughtthat-the wind dida little
abate, yet the Ship having thus struck upon the sand,
and, sticking too fast for us to expect her getting of,
we'were in a dreadful condition indeed, and had no-
.thing to do but to think of saving Our lives as well as
we could. We had a boat at our stern, just before the
storm ; but she was first staved'by dashing against the
ship's rudder, and in the next place she broke away,
and either sunk or was driven off to sea; so there Was
no hopemfrom her. We had another boat on board,
but how to get her .off into the 'sea was a doubtful
thing; however, there was no roomlto debate, for we
fancied the ship would break in pieces every minute, '
and some told us she was actually broken already.
In this distress, the mate of our vessel Iays'hold of
the boat and with thelhelp of the rest of the men they
\ got her slung over the ship's'side, and getting all into
her, let go, and committed ourselves, being eleven in
number, to God's mercy and the wild sea; for though
the storm was abated considerably, yet the sea went
dreadful high upon the shore, and might well be cal-
led den wild zee, as the Dutch call drama in a storm.
And new'our case Was very dismal indeed ; for we
all saw plainly, that the sea went so high, that the
boat could not live, and that we should be inevitabl '
drowned. . As to making sail, we had none, nor, if '

- . we had, could we have done any thing with it; so we

worked at 'he oar towards the land, though with

' heavy hearts, like men going to execution; for we all

.knew, that when the boat came nearer the shore, she
would be dashed into a thousand pieces by the breach
of the sea. However, we committed our souls to God
in, the most earnest manner; and the wind driving 'f

44 LIP-E AND ADVENTURES

. us towards the shore, we hastened our destruction with
"tour own hands,pulhng as well aswe could towards land.

Vv'hat theshore was, whether rock or sand, whe--
ther steep or shoal, we knew not; the only hope that
could rationally give us the least shadow of expecta.

' tion, was, ifwe might happen into some bay or gulf,

or the mouth 01' some river, where, by great chance .
we' might- have' run our boat in, or got under the lee o
the land, and perhaps made smooth water. But
there was nothing (if this appeared; but as we mad
nearer and nearer f the shore, ,the land looked more

' frightful-than the sea.

After we had rowed orfrather driven about a league
and a half, as we reckoned it, a raging wave, "moun-
tain-likegcame rolling astern of us, and plainly had
us. expect the coup-deograce. In a word, it took us

~ with such a fury,' that it" overset the boat at once';

and separating us as well from the boat as from one
another, gave us not time hardly to 'say 0 God! for
we were all swallowed up in a moment, .

. . Nothing can describe the confusion of thought which
I felt- when I sunk into the water; for though I swam
very well, yet I could not deliver'tnyselffrom the waves '

. so as to draw breath, till that wave having driven'me

or rather carried me a vast way'on towards the shore, '
and having spent itself, went back, and left me upon
the land almost dry, but half dead with the Water I
tack in. I had so much presence of mind as well as

-_ breath left, that, seeing myself nearer the main land

so

than I expectedJ got upon my feet, and endeavoured
'to make on towards the land as fast as I could, before

another wave should return, and take me up again.

But I soon found it was impossible to avoid it": {on};
saw the sea come after me as high as a great hill. and
as furious as an enemy which I had'no meansge'r
strength to contend with; my business was to hold ni'y
breath, and raise myself upon the water, if I could;
and so by swimming to preserve. my breathing, and ',
pilot myself towards the shore, if possible ; my greatest

'v'O

or ROBINSON causes; , 4::

concern now being, that the sea, as it would carry me
a great way towards the shore when it came on,
might not carry me back again with it when it gave
back towards the sea. - ' ~ ' . -

The wave that 'came upon me again, buried me at
once twenty or thirty feet deep in its own body; and
I could feel myself carried with a mighty force and
swiftness towards the shore a very great way; but I
held my breath, and assisted myself to swim still for-
ward with all my might. I was ready to burst with
holding my breath,'when, as I felt myself rising up,
so, to myimmediate relief, .I found my head and hands
shoot outabove the surface of the water; and though
it was not two seconds of time that I could keep my-
self so, yet it relieved me greatly, gave me breath and
new courage. I was covered again with water a good
while, but not so long but I held it out; and finding
the water had spentitself, and began to return,i struck
forward against the return of the waves, and felt
ground again with my feet. I stood still a few mo-
ments to recover breath, and till the water went from
me, and then took to my heels, and run with what
strength I had farther towards the shore. But neither
would this deliver me from the fury of the sea, which
came pouring in after me again; and twice more I
was lifted up by the waves and carried forwards as
before, the shore being very flat. .

The last time of these two had well near been fatal
to me; for the sea having hurried me along as before,
landed me, or rather dashed me against a piece of a
reek, and that with such force, as it left me senseless,
and indeed helpless, as to my own deliverance; for
the blometaking my side and breast, beat the breath'
as ityq'eie-quite out of my body; and had it returned
again; immediately, I must have been strangled in the
water; but I recovered a little before the return of
th'ta'tvaves, and seeing I should be covered again with
the water, I resolved to hold fast by a piece of the rock,
and so to hold my breath, if possible, till the wave'
went back. -Now as the waves were not so high as at
first, being near land, I held my hold-till the wave "
abated, and then fetched another run, which brought
me so near the shore, that the next wave,'th0ugh it _
went- over me, yet did not so swallow me up as to
carry me away: and the next run I took I got to the .
main land, where to my great comfort lclambered
up the clifts of the shore, and sat me down upon the
grass, free from danger, and quite out of the reach of
the water. .

I was now landed, and safe on shore, and began to
look up and thank God that my life was saved in a
case wherein there was some minutes before scarce
any room to hope. I believe it is impossible to ex-
press to thelife what the ectasies and transports of.
the'soul' are, when it is so saved, as I may say', out
of the very grave ;. and I do not wonder now at that
custom, viz. that when a malefactor, who has the hal-
ter about his neck, is tied up, and just going to be
turned off, and has a reprieve brought to him: I say,
I do not wonder that they bring a' surgeon with it, to
let him blood that very moment they tell him of it,
'that the surprise may not drive the animal spirits from
the heart, and overwhelm him: '

For sudden joys; like 'griefs, confound at first.

I walked abdut on the shore, lifting up my hands
and my whole being, as I may say, wrapped up in the
contemplation of my deliverance, making a" thousand ' -
gestures and motions which I cannot describe; reflect-
ing upon all my comrades that were drowned, and
that there should not be one soul saved but myself;
for, as for them, I never saw them afterwardsgbi'i'any
sign of them, except three of their hats, one c'a'p,an _. ~
two shoes that were not fellows. , . f 2 -

I cast my eyes to the stranded. vessel, when the
breach and from of the sea being so big, I Could
hardly see it, it lay, so far 01?, and considered, Lord!
how was it possible I could get on shore! ' '

After I had solaced my mind with the comfortable

\
part of my condition, .I' began to look round me, to
see what kind'of place I was in, and what was next .
to be done; and I soon found my comforts abate,
and that in a word I had a dreadful delit'crance; for
I was wet, had no clothes to shift me, nor any thing
either to eat or drink to, comfort me; neither did I
see any pro'spect before me, but that of perishing with .
hunger, .or being devoured by wild beasts; and that
which was particularly afflicting to me, was, that I-
had no weapon either to hunt and killany creature
for my sustenance, or to defend myself against any
other creature that might desire to kill me for theirs:
in a word, I had nothing about me but a knife, 8,
tobacco-pipe, and a little tobacco in a box; this was
all my provision, and this threw me into terrible ago>>
nies of mind, that fer a while I run about like a mad-
man. Night coming upon me, I began with a heavy.
heart to consider what would be my lot. if there were
any ravenous beasts in that country, seeing at night .
they always come abroad for their prey. .

All the remedy that ofl'ered to my thoughts at that
time, was, to get up into a thick bushy tree like a'fir,
but thorny, which grew near me, and where I resolv-
ed to sit all night, and consider the next day what
death I should die," for as yet I saw no prospect of
life. I walked about a furlong {mm the shore, to see
ifI couldtfind any fresh water to drink, which I did,
to my great joy ;' and having drank, and put a little
tobacco in my mouth to preVent hunger, I went to
the tree, and getting up into it, endeavoured to place
myself 'so, as that if I should sleep, I might not fa.l,
; and having cut mea short stick, like a truncheonfi' :'
my. defence, I took up my lodging, and having been
excessively, fatigued, I fell fast asleep, and slept as
comfortably as, I believe, few could have done in '1'!
condition, and found myself the most refreshed t 3&3.
it thatI think I ever was on such an occasion. _

When Iwaked it was broad day, the weather 02 52-."
and the storm abated, so that the sea did not rage t; _.
swell as before; but that which surprised me :, :3},

.,v
was, that the ship was lifted off in the night from the
- sand where she lay, by the swelling of the tide, and
was driven up almost as far as the rock. which I first
mentioned, where I had been so bruised by the dash-
Zing me against it; this being within about a.mile from
the, shore where I was, and the ship seeming to stand
tupright Still, I wished myself on board, that, at least
I might save some necessary things for my'hse.
. When I came down from niy apartment in the tree
', , I looked about me again, and the first thing I foun
was the boat, which lay as the wind and the sea had
- tossed her up upon the land, about two miles on my
right hand. I walked as far as I could upon the shore
to have got to, her, but found aneck or inlet of water
between me and the boat which was about half a' mile
bread; so .'I came back for the present, being more
'iritent'uppn getting at the ship, where I hoped to find '
_ semething for my present subsistence. .
"A little after noon I found the sea very calm, and
' *the'tide ebb'ed so far out, that l ecul'd come within a
_ quarter of a mile of the ship; and here i found a fresh
ienewing ofmy'grief: 161' 1 saw evidently, that if we
"had kept on board, we had been all safe, that is t0"

so miserable as to be left entirely destitute of all com-
fort and company, as i' now was. This forced tears
from my eyes again; but as there was little relief in
that, I resolved,"if possible, to get to the ship; so I
pulled ofl' my clothes, for the weather was hot "to ex-
tremity, and took the water; but when'I .came to the
-ship,.my difficulty was still greater to know how to' '
get on board; for as she lay aground, and high out of
'the water, there'was nothing within my reach to lay
:hold of.. I . swam round her twice, and the second
time I eSpied a small piece of a rope, which I wonder-
ed I did not see at first, hang claim by the fore-chains .
so low. as that with great difficulty I got hold of it,
":and. 'by the help of that rape got up into the fore-castle
.of-the ship. Here I found that the ship was bulged,
sandhada great deal of water in her hold, but that she

lay so on the side of a bank of hard sand, or rather
earth, and her stern lay lifted up upon the bank, and
her head low almost to the water: by this means all
her quarter was free, and all that was in that part was
dry; for you may he sure my first work was to search
and to see what was spoiled and what was free; and
_first I found that all the ship's provisions were dry
and untouched by the water; and being very welldis-
posed to eat, I went to the bread-room and filled my.
pockets with bisket, and ate it as I .went about other
things, forl had no time. to lose.' I also found some
rum in the great cabin, of which I took a large dram,
' and which I had indeed need enough of to spirit me
for what was'before me. >>' Now I wanted nothinghut

foresaw would be very necessary to me. _. A-

It was in vain to sit still and wish for what wasnOt,
to be had; and this extremity roused my applicatiOn.
We had several spare yards, and two or three large
spars of wood, and a spare topmast or two in the
ship; I resolved-to fall to work with these, and flung
as'many of them overboard as I could manageof
their weight, tying every 0ne_with a rope, that they
might not drive away. When this was done I went
down the ship's side, and pulling them to me"I tied
four of them fast together at both ends as well as I
could, in the form of a raft, and laying two or three
short pieces of plank upon them crossways, I found I
'could walk upon it very well, but that it was not able
to bear any great weight, the pieces being too light;
so I went to work, and with the carpenter's saw I cut
a spare topmast into three lengths, and added them to
my raft, with a great deal of labour, and. pains; but
hOpe of furnishing myself with necessaries encourago

led me to go beyond what I should have been able to
have done upon another occasion. l _

My raft was now strong enough to hear any reason-
able weight; my next care was what to load it with,
and how to preserve whatI laid upon it from the surf

of the sea; but I was not long considering this: I first .
laid all the planks Or boards upon it that I could get,
. and having Considered well what I most wanted, I
first got three of the seamen's chests, which I had
broken Open and emptied, and lowered them down-
upon my raft. The first of these I filled With provi-.
' , sions, viz..bread, rice, three Dutch cheeses, five pieces
'of dried goat's flesh, which we lived muCh upon, and
a little. remainder of European corn which had been
laid'b'yr'for some fowls which we brought to sea with -

l'

, _-;us,:'bi1t"the' {owls were-killed. There had been some}

barley and wheat together, but, to my great disap-
pointment, I found afterwards that the rats had eaten
or spoiled it all. _As for liquors, I found several cases
of bottles belonging to our skipper, in which were
some cordial waters, and in all above five or six gal-
lons' of rack: theseI stowed by themselves, there being
no need to put them into the chest, nor no room for
them. ' While Iwas doing this, I found the tide began .
to flow, thongh very calm, and I had the mortification
to see my coat, shirt, and waistcoat, whichI had
left on shore upon the sand, swim away; as for my
breeches, which were onlylinen, and Open-knee'd, I ~
swamjo'n board in them and my stockings: however,
this put me upon rummaging for clothes, of which I
found enough, but tool}. no more than-[ wantedfor
present use, forI had other things which my eye Was
more upon; as, first, tools to work with on shore;
and it was after long searching, that I found out the
carpenter's -chest, which was indeed a very useful
prize to me, and much more valuable than'a ship--
loading of gold would have been at that time: IggOt
it down to my "raft, even whole as it was, without
losing time to look into it, for I knew in general what
it contained. _ ~ _-, .

. My next care was for some ammunition andarms.
There were two very good fowling-pieces in the great.
cabin, and two pistols: these I secured first, with some
powder horns, and'a small .bag of shot, and two old
rusty swords. _I knew there were three barrels of _
Eowder in the ship, but, knew not where our gunner
ad stowed them; but with much search I found them,
two of them-dry and good, the third had taken water,
those two I get to my raft, with the arins. And now
I thought myself pretty well'freighted, and began to '
think how I should get to shore with them, having
neither sail, oar, or rudder, and the least capful of
wind Would have overset all my navigation. '

I had three encouragements: .1. A smooth, calm).
sea; 2. The tide rising and setting in to" the shore; 3. '
What little wind there was blew me to'wardsthe land :'
and thus, having found two or. threabzqkensoarsbeo
longing to the boat, and besides :the'tofols whidhtvere
in thefchest, I found two saws, ang'axfe', ah'dahammens'
and with this cargo I put to seat fora 'i'r'rilggorithereo
abouts, my raft went very well, only-that'jlfifo'tind it
drive a little distant from the place where I had landed
before, by which I perceived that there was some in-
draft of the water, and consequently I hoped to find
some creek or river there, which I might make use
of as a port to get to land with my cargo: ,

As I imagined, so it was: there apfpeared before
me a little opening of the land, and I ound a strong '
currentof the tide set into it, so I guided my raft as
well .as I could to keep into the middle of the stream;
but here I had like to have suffered a second ship-
wreck, which, if I had, I think verily would have
broke my heart; for knowing nothing of the coast, my
raft run aground'at one end of it upon a shoal, and
. not being aground at the other end, it wanted butt!
little that all my cargo had slipped off towards that
end that was afloat, and so fallen into the water. I
did my utmost, by setting my back against the chests,
I to keep them in their places, but could "not thrust off
- the raft with all my strength ; neither durst I stir from-
- the posture I .was' in, but holding up the chests with

all my might, stood in that manner near half an hour.
in which time the rising of the water brought me a
little more upon a level; and a little after, the water
still rising, my raft floated again, and I thru'st her off
witn-tne oar I had into the channel ; and then driving
up higher, I at length found myself in the mouth of a
little river, with land on both sides, and a strong. cur-
rent or tide running up. Hooked on both sides for
a proper place to get to shore; for I was not willing
to be driven too high up the river, hoping in time to
.see some'ship at sea, and therefore resolved to place
myself as near the coast as I could. _ ,

At length I spied a little cove on the right shore of
the creek, to which, with great pain and difficulty, I
guided my "raft, and at last got so near, as that, reaoh~ ,
ing ground with my oar, I could thrust herdirectly
in; but here I had liked 'to have dipped all my cargo
, in the sea again; for that shore lying pretty steep,
that is to'say slapi'ng, there" was no place to land, but
where one end of the float, if it run 011 shore, would
lie so high, and the other sink lower as before, that it
would endanger my cargo again: an that I could do,
was to wait till the tide was at the highest, keeping
the raft with my. oar like an anchor to hold the side
of it fast to the shore, near a flat piece of ground, .
which I expected the water would flow over; and so
it did. As soon as I found water'enough, for my raft
drew about a foot of water, I thurst her on upon that
flat piece of ground, and, there faStened or moored
her by sticking my two broken, oars into theground;
one on one side near one end, and one on the other
side near the other end; and thus I lay till the water
. ebhed away, and left my raft and all my cargo safe
on shore.

My next Work was to view the country, and seek a'
proper place for my-hahitation, and where to stow
my goods, to secure them from whatever might hap-
pen. Where I was I yet knew not; whether ' on the
continent or on an island,.whether inhabited or not
inhabited, whether in danger of wild beasts or. not. .
There was a hill not above a' mile from me, which.
rose up very steep and high, and which seemed to
overtop some other hills which lay as in a ridge from
it northward: I, took out one of the fowling pieces,
and one of the pistols, and an horn of powder, and
thus armed I travelled for discovery up to the top of
_ that hill, where, afterI had with great labour and
ditiiculty got to the top, , I saw my fates to my great
afllictiou, viz. that I was in an island environed- every
way with the sea, no~ land to be seen, -except.some
' rocks which lay a great way off, and two small islands
less than 'tlij'swvhicii lay about three leagues to the
west. . ,

I found also that the island I was in was barren,
and as I saw good reason to believe, uninhabited, ex.
cept by wild beasts, of whomfhowever, I saw none;
yet I saw abundance of fowls, but knew. not their
kinds; neither when I killed them could I tell what
was fit for food, and what not. At my coming back
I shot at a great bird, which I saw sitting upOn a tree
on the side of a great wood--I believe it was the first
gun that had been fired there since the creation ofthe.
world. I had no sooner fired, but from all partsfif' -
the wood there arose an innumerable number of fowls
of many sorts, making a confused screaming,'and cry-
ingevery .'one according to his 'usu'a'l note; but not
. one of them of any kind that Irknew. As for the
creature i killed, I took it to be a kind of a hawk, its
colour and beak resembling it, but had no talons or
claws more than coinino'n; its flesh was carrion, and
' fit for nothing. ~

Contented with this discovery, I came back to my
raft, and fell to work to bring my cargo on shore,
whichtook .me up the rest of that day}; and what to
do with myself at night I knew not, nor indeed where
to rest; for I was afraid to lie dawn on the ground,
not knowing but some wild beast might devour me;
though, as I afterwards found there was really no need
for those fears. _

However, as well as I could, I barricadoed myself
round with the chestsand boards that I had brought
on shore, and made a kind of ahut for that night's
iodginw. As for food, I yet saxtfijnot which way to
supply myself, except that'l 'hari,,js.een two or three
. creatures like hares run outcf the wood where I shot
the fowl. . '

' I now began to consider, that I might yet "get a

great many things out of the ship, which would be use.-
.ful to me, and particularly some of the rigging and
' sails, and such other things as might come to land,-
and I resolved to make another voyage'on board the
vessel, if possible; and as I knew that the first storm
.-that blew must necessarily break her all in pieces, I
resolved to set all other things a art, till I got every
' thing out of the ship that I coul get. Then I called

' . a council, that is to say, in my thoughts, whether I

Should, take back the raft; but this appeared imprac-
ticable: so I resoived to go as before, when the tide
was down, and I did so, only that I stripped before I
, went from my hut, having nothing on but a checked
shirt and a pair of linen trowsers, and a pair of pumps
on my feet. '
I got on board the ship, as before, andpreparcd a
' vse'cond raft; and having had experience of the first, I
neither made this so unwieldy,-nor loaded it so hard,
' but yet I brought away several things very useful to
me; as first, in the carpenter's stores. I found two or
three bags full of nails and spikes, a great screw-jack, -
a dozen or two of hatchets, and above' all, that most
useful thing called a grindstone; all these I secured,
together with several things belonging to the gunner,
particularly two or three iron crows, and two barrels
~ of musket-bullets, seven muskets, and another fowling-v
' ' iece, with some small quantity of powder more; a
'_ a'rge bag full of small shot, and a great roll of sheet
lead; but this last was so heavy Icould not hoist it
' Upto get it over the ship's side. -
' Besides these things, I took all the me'n's clothes
that I could find, and a sparefore--tOpsail, hammoCk,
and some bedding; and with this I loaded my second
raft, and brought them all safe on shore to my very
great comfort. '
' I- was under some apprehensions during my absence
_ from the land, that at least my provisions might be\ ' . ' ..

a devoured on shore; but when I came bask, I found
no sign of any visitor, only there sat a creature like a
wild cat upon one of the chests, which, when I came
towards it,ran away a little distance, and then stood

' still; she sat very composed and unconcerned, and
, looked full in my face, as if she had a mind to be ac-
quainted with me: I presented my gun at her, betas
she did not understand it, she was perfectly uncon-
cerned at it, nor did she offer to stir. away; upon-
which I tossed her a bit of biscuit, though by the way '
I was not very free of it, for my store was'not great.-
however, I spared her a bit, I say, and she went to
it, smelled of it, and ate it, and looked, as plea'sed,vf0r
more; but I thanked her, and could spare no more;
so she marched ofli ' ~ g. -
Having got my second cargo on shore, though I
was 'fain to open the barrels of powder and bring

.. them by parcels, for they were too heavy, being large
casks, I went to work to make me a little tent with
the sail and some poles which I cut for that purpose;
and into this tent I brought every thing that I knew. -
would spoil, either with rain orsun; and I piled all'
the empty chests and casks up in a circle round the
tent, to fortify it from any sudden attempt, either from '
man or beast. . g -

When I had done this, I blocked up the door' of the
tent with some boards within, and an empty chest set
up an end without, and spreading one of the beds -
upon the ground, laying my two pistols just at my
head, and my gun at length by me, I went to bed for
the first time, and slept very quietly all night, for}
was very weary and heavy, as the night before I'had
Slept little, and had laboured very hard all day, as well
to fetch all those things from the ship as to get them
on shore. ' i

I had the biggest magazine-of all kinds now that

. ever were laid up, I believe, for one man; but I was
not satisfied still; for while the ship sat 'upright in
that posture, I thought I ought to get every thing on:

- of her thatI could: so every day at low water I went
_ 'on board, and brought away something or other; but
particularly the- third time I went, I brought away as
much of the rigging as, I could, as also all the small
repes and rope-twine I could get, withra piece of spare
canvass, which was to mend the sails upon occasion,
andthe barrel of wet gunpowder: in a word I brought
away all the sails first and last, only that I was fain
to. cut them in pieces, and bring as much at a time as -
I could; for they were no moreuseful to be sails, bu
as mere canvass only. ' ' .

But that which comforted me more still, was, that
al. last of all, after I_had made five or six such voyages
as these, and thought I had nothing moreto expect
from the ship that was worth my meddling with; I
say, after all this, I found a great hogshead of bread,-
and three large runlets of rum or Spirits, and a box '
of sugar, and a barrel of fine flower; this was surpris-y
ing to me because I had given over expecting any
more provisions, except what was spoiled by the wa'
ter: I soon emptied the hogshead of that bread, and
wrapped it up, parcel by parcel, in pieces of the sails,
which I cut out: and in a word, I got all this Safe on
shore also. - _

'The next day I made another voyage: and now,
having plundered the ship of what was portable and
fit "to hand out, I began with the cables; and cutting
the great cable into pieces, such as I could move, I
got two cables and a hawser on shore, with all the
' iron work I could get; and having cut dotvn the sprit-
sail yard, and the mizen yard, and every thing I coold
. to make a large raft, l leaded it 'with all those heavy
goods, and came away: but'my good luck began now
to leave me; for this raft was so unwieldy and so
ov'erladen, that after I had entered the little Cove 'where
I had landed the rest of 'my goods, not being able to
guide it so handily as I did the other, it ovarset, and
. threw me and all my cargo into the water. As for
myself, it was no great harm, for l was near the shore;
but'as to my cargo, it was great part of it lost, espe- z
ciallythe iron, which [expected would have been of f,0E itoBiNSON causeE.' ' A .57 -

great use to me: however, when the tide was out, I
got most of the pieces of cable ashore, and some of
the iron, though with infinite labour; for I was fair:
to dip forit into the water,- a work which fatigued me
Very much, After this, I went every day on board, '
and brought away what I could get'. ' -
I had been new thirteen days on shore, andhad
- been eleven times on board the ship ;' in which time
. I had brought away all that one pair of hands could
well be supposed Capable to bring, though I believe
. verily, had the calm weather held, I should have
brought away the whole ship, piece bypiece; but .prea
paring the-twelfth time to go on board, "bond the
wind began to rise; however at low water 'I went on ,
board, and though] thoughtl had rummaged the cabin
so effectually, as thatnothing more could be found,
yet I - discovered a locker with drawers in it, in one
of which I found two or three razors, and one pair of
large scissars, with some ten ora dozen of good knives
and forks; in another I found about thirty-Six pounds
value in money, some European coin, some Brasil,
some pieces of eight, some gold, some silver. '
- I smiled to myself at the sight of this-money. " 0
drug 3",.said I, aloud, " what art thou good for? thou
art not worth to me, no not the taking off of the
g'fOund ; tone of those knives is worth all this been; I
have no manner of use for thee ; even remain w .e're
thou art,' and go to the bottom as a creature whose
life is not worth Savingl' However, upon second
thoughts, I took it away. and wrapping all this in a.
piece of canvass, I began to think'of making another
raft, but While I was preparing this, I found the sky ~
overcast, and the wind began to rise, and in aquarter
of an heuritblew afresh .galefrom the shore, It
, presentlyOCcurred to me, that it was in vain to pre-
tend to make a raft with the wind off shore, and that. -
it was my business to be gone before the tide of flood
began, otherwise I might not be able to reach the shore

at all ; accordingly I let Iirryself down into the water,
5 . 2 '
and swam across the channel which lay between the
"ship and the sands, and even that with difficulty
strongh, partly with the weight of things l'had about
, me, and parly the roughness of the water, for the wind
rose very hastily, and beforeit was quite high water
it blew a storm. ' . : -

But I was gotten home to my little tent, where I_
lay with all my wealth about me very secure. It blew
verp hard all that night, and in the morning when I
looked out behold no more ship was to be seen. I
was a little surprised, but recovered myself With this
satisfactory reflection, viz. that I had lost no time, nor
abated no diligence. to get every thing out of her that
could be useful to me, and that indeed there was little
left in her that I was able to bring away, if I had had
more time. , . - ' ' ' .

I now gave over any more" thoughtsof the ship, or
of any thing out of her, except what might drive on
shore from her wreck, as indeed, divers pieces of her .'
afterwards did ;_ but those things were of small use to '
me. n .

. My thoughts were now wholly' employed aboutlseg
curing myself against either savages, if any should ap-
ear, or wild beasts, if any were in the'island; and I
ad many thoughts of the method how to do this, and
what kind of dwelling to make; whether I shomd
, make me a cave in the earth, are tent upon the earth : _
and, in short,~ I resolvedupon both, the manneriand
description of which it may not be improper to give
an account of. . -' . ' . -

I seen found the place I was in was not for my set-

'tlement, particularly because it was upon a low moor-
ish ground near the sea, and I believed would not he
wholesome, and more particularly because there was.
no fresh water near it; so I resolved. to find a more
healthy and more convenientspot of ground. -

I consulted several things in my situation which I
found would be proper for me '; lst, Health, and fresh
water, I just now mentioned. 2ndly, Shelte'rirom the
heat of the'sun. 3dly, Security from ravenous crea-
cures, whether man or beast. . 4thly,A view to the
sea, that if God sent any ship in sight, I mightnot .
lose any advantage for my deliverance, of which I was
not willing to banish all my expectation yet.

In search of a place pr0per for this, I found a little
plain .on- the side of a rising hill, whose front towards
this little plain was steep as a h'ouse<<side, so that no-
thing could come down upon me' from the top : on
the side of this rock there was hollow place "worn a
little way in a like the entrance or door of a cave, but
theriaI was not really any cave or way into the rock
at a . - ' - ' '-

Onthe flat of the green, justbefore this hollow place,
I resolved to pitch my tent : this plain was not above
an hundred yards broad, and about twice as long, and
lay like a green before my door, and at the end of it
'dEscended irregularly every way down into the low
grounds by the sea-side. It was on the N. N. W. side
of the hill, so that I was sheltered from the heat every
day, till it came to a:W. and by 3. sun, or thereabouts,
which in those countries is near the sitting.

Before I set up my tent, I drew a half circle before
the hollow place, which took in about ten yards in its
semi-diameter from the rock, and twenty yards in its
diameter, from its beginning and ending.

In this half-circle I pitched two rows of strong
stakes; driving them into the ground till they stood
very firm, like piles, the biggest end being out of the
ground about five foot and a'half, and sharppened on
the t0p; the-two rows did not stand above six inches.
from one another. ' -' - '

Then I took the pieces of cable which I had cut'i'n?
the ship, and laid them in rows one above another,
within the circle between these two rows of stakes, up
' to the top, placing other stakes in the inside, leaning . '
against them, about two foot and a half high,.like a
5 ur to a post; and this fence was so strong, that nei-
t er man or beast could get into it or over it: this cost
me a great deal of time and labour, especially to cut
so . .LIFE AND ADVENTURES

The entrance into this place I made to be not by a
door, but by a short ladder, to go over the top: which

' I was completely fenced in, and fortified, as I thought,

from all the world, and consequently slept secure in
the night,' which otherwise I could not have done,
though, as it appeared afterward, there was no need
of all this caution from the enemies that I apprehend.
ed danger from. ' '
" Into this fence or fortress, with infinite labour, I
carried all my riches, all my provisions, ammunition,
and stores, of which you have the account amaze; and
I made me a large tent, which, to-preserve me from
the rains, that in one part of the year are very violent
there, I made double, viz. one smaller tent, within,
and one larger tent above it, and covered the, upper-
most with a lage tarpaulin which I had saved among
the sails. '

And now I lay no more for awhile in the bed which

I had brought on shore but in a hammock, which was '

indeed a very good one, and belonged to the mate of
the. ship. .

Into this tent I brought all my provisions, and every
thing that would spoil by the wet; and having thus
enclosed all my goods. I made up the entrance, which

I dug doWn, out through my tent, I laid them up with-
in my fence in'the nature of a' terrace, that so it rais-

thus I made me a cave just behind my tent, which
servedme like a cellar to my house.

' It cost me much' labour and? many days, before all
these things were brought to perfection, and therefore
I must go back to some other things which took up'1

some of my thoughts. At the same time it happened,
after I had laid my scheme for the setting up my
tent, and making the cave, that a storm of irain fall-
ing frOm a thick dark cloud, a sudden flash of light-
ning happened, and after that a great clap of thunder,
as is naturally the effect of it. I was not so much
surprised with the lightning, as I was with a thought

which darted into my mind as swift as the lightning

itself: 0 my powder 3. my very heart sunk within me,_

when I thought, that at one blast all my powder might
be destroyed: on which, not my defence only, but
the roviding me of food, as I thought, entirely de-
pen ed : I was nothing near so anxious about my
own danger; though, had the powder took fire, I had
'never known who had hurt me. . -
Such' impression did this make upon me, that, after
the storm was over, I laid aside all my works, my
building, and fortifying, and applied myself to make
bags and hexes to separate the powder, and to keep
it a little and a little m a parcel, in hope, that, whats
ever might come, it might not all take fire at once,
and to keep it so apart, that it should not be possibl

to make one part fire another. I finished this work

in about a fortnight; and I think my powder, which
in all was about two hundred and forty pounds

A"

weight, was divided in not less than a hundred par-z.
eels. t As to the barrel that had been wet, I did not ,

apprehend any danger from that, so I placed it in my,
new cave, which in my-fancy I called my kitchen ;.
and the rest I hid up and down in holes among the
rocks, so that no wet might come to it, marking very
carefully where Ilaid it. ,

In the interval of time while this was doing, I- went
out once at least every day with my gun, as well to,
.divert myself, as to see if I could kill any thing fit for
food, and as near as ,I could to acquaint myself with
what the island produced. -. The first time I went out

I presently discovered that there were goats in the ,

island, which was a great'satisfaction to me ; but then
it was attended with this misfortue to me, viz. that
they were so shy, so subtle, and so swift of foot, that
it was the most difficult thing in the world to come at
them. But I was net discouraged at this, not doubt
,ing but _I might now and then shoot one, as it
soon happened; for after I had found their haunts a
little,'I laid wait in this manner for them : I observed,
if they saw me in the vallics, though they were upon
the rocks, they would run away as in a terrible fright ;
but if they were feeding in the vallies, and '1 was
upon the rocks, they took no notice of me; from
_ whence I concluded, that by the position of their

optics, their sight was so directed downward, that they
did not readily see objects that were above them ;-so
afterward I took this method; I always climbed the
rocks first to get above them, and then had frequent-
ly a fair mark. The first shot I made among these
creatures I killed a she-goat, which had a little kid
by her which she gave suck to, which grieved me
heartily; but when the old one fell, the kid stood
stock still by her till I came and took her up; and not
only so; but when I carried the old one with me upon
my shoulders, the kid followed me quite to my en-
closure; upon which I laid down the dam, and took
the kid in my arms, and carried it over my pale, in
hepes to have bred it up tame; but it would not eat;
so I was forced to kill it, and eat it myself. These
two supplied me with flesh a great while, for I ate
sparingly, and saved my provisions (my bread esPe-
cially) as much as possibly I could. -

Having now fixed my habitation, I found it abso-
lutely necessary to provide a place to make a fire in,
andfuel to burn; and what I did for that, as also
lmw I enlarged my cave, and what conveniences I
made, I shall give a full account of in its place; but
1 must first give some little account'of myself, and of
my thoughts about living, which it may wellvbe sop-
posed were not a few. , '

I had a dismal prospect of my condition; for as I s
was not cast away upon that island without being
driven, as is said, by a violent storm quite out of the011' ROBINSON onuson.' 65

course of our intended voyage, and a great way, viz.
some hundreds of leagues out'of the ordinary course
' of the trade of mankind, I had great reason to consi-
der it as a determination of Heaven, that in this de-
solate place, and in this desolate manner, I should
end my life. The tears would run plentifully down
my face when I made these reflections; and some-
times I would expostulate with myself, why 'Provi- '
deride should thus. completely ruin hiscreatures, and
render them so absolutely miserable, so without help
abandoned, so entirely depressed, that it could hardly
'be rational to be thankful for such a life. '
But something always returned 'swift upon me to
check. these thoughts, and to reprove me; and parti-
cularly one day, walking with my gun in my hand by
the sea-side, I was very pensive upon the subject of
my present condition; when reason, as it were, ex-
postulating with me t'other way, thus: " Well, you
are in a desolate condition, 'tis true, but pray rememev
her, where are the rest of you? Did not you come
eleven of you into the boat ? Where are the ten ? Why
were" they not saved and you lost? Why were you
singled out? Is it better to be here or there P" And
then I pointed to the sea. All evils are to be consi-
dered with the good that is in them, and with what
worse attended them. t
Then it occurred to me again, how well I was fur. -
nished for my subsistence, and what would have been
my case if it had not happened, which was a'hun~
dred thousand to one, that the ship floated from the
place where she first struck, and was driven so near
the shore that I had time to get all these things out'of
her. What would have been my case, if I had been
to have lived in the condition in which I at first came
on shore, without necessaries of life, or necessaries to
supply and procure them? " particularly," said 1,
loud (though to myself), "what should I have done
Without a gun, without ammunition, without any tools
to make any thing, or to work with ; without clothes,
Bedding, a tent, or any manner of covering?" and
that now I had all these to a sufficient quantity, and
was in a fair way to provide myself in such a inan-
ner, as to live withoutmy gun when my ammunition
was spent; so thatI had a tolerable view of subsist-
ing, 'withOut any want, as long as I lived; for I con-
sidered'from the beginning how I should provide for~
the acCidents that might happen, and for the time
that, 'was to come, even not only after myjammuni
't-Eon should be spent, but even _ after my health 0.
strength should decay.

I cOnfess I had not entertained any notion of my
ammunition being destroyed at one blast, I mean my

powder being blown up by lightning; and this made '

the thoughts of it so surprising to me when it light-
ened and thundered, as I observed just now.

And 'now, being about to enter into a melancholy
relation of a scene of silent life, suchperhaps-as was
;never heard of in the world before, Ishall take it
, from its beginning, and continue it in its order, It

' was, by my account, the 30th of September, when, in
the'.manner as above said, I first set foot upon this
horrid. island, when the sun being, to us, in its autum-
nal. equinox, was almost just over my head, for I
reckoned myself, by observation, to be inthe latitude
of 9. degrees 22 minutes north of the line. .

After I had been there about ten or twelve days, it
came into my thoughts, that I should' lose my rcekonfi
'ing of time for want of books, and pen and ink, and
should even forget the sabbath days from the working
days; but to prevent this, I cut it with my knife upon
a large post, in capital letters, and making it into a
great cross, I set it up on the shore where I first land-
ed, viz " I came on shore .here on .the:30th of Sep-
tember 1659." Upon the sides of this-situate post, I
out every day a notch with my knife,- and. every se-
venth notch was as long again as the ,r'est,iand every
first day of the month as long again'.as..that long one;

and thus I kept my calendar, or weekly, monthly, and .
yearly reckoning of time. . . ' .. ,
' In the next place we are tovobserve, that among

a

I
tnemany things which I brought out of the ship in the
several voyages, which,-as above mentioned, I made '
to .it, I got several things of less value, but not all less
useful to me, Which I ' omitted setting down before ;
as in particular, pens, ink, and paper, several parcels
in the captain's,C/nate's, gunner's, and carpenters keep-
ing, three or four compasses, some mathematical in-
struments, dials, perspectives, charts, and books of
navigation ; all which I huddled together, whether I .
might want them or no. -. Also I found three very good
Bibles, which came to me in my carg'o from England,
and which I had packed up among my- things ; some
Portuguese books also, and among them two or three
papish prayer-books, and several other books; all
which] carefully secured. And I must not forget,-'
"that we had in. the ship a dog and two cats, of whose
eminent history I may have occasion to say something
in its place: for I carried both the cats with me; and
'as for the dog, he jumped'out of the ship of himself,
and swam on shore to me the day after I went on
shore with my first cargo, and was a trusty servant to
me many years; I wanted nothing that he could fetch
me, nor any company that he could make up to me ; -
I only wanted to have him talk to me, 'hut that he ,
could not do. As I observed before, I found pen, '
ink, and paper, and I husbanded them to the utmost;
and I shall show, that while my i'nk lasted, I kept
things very exact; but after that was gone I could not,'-.
for I could not make any ink by any means that I
could devise. , .

And this putme in mind that I. wanted many things,
notwithstanding all that I had amassed together; and
of these, this of ink was one, as also spade, pickaxe,
and shovel, to dig or remove the earth; needles, pins,
and thread-1" As rm- linen', I'soon learnt to want that '
without mUch difficulty. ' -

This want of tqois made every work I did go on'
heavily, and it was near a whole year before I had
entirely finished my little pale or surrounded habita~
tion ; the piles or. stakes, which were as heavy as I

5 .

0*
could well lift, were a long time in- Cutting and pre-
Karing' inthe woods. and more'by far in bringing
ome; so that I spent sometimes two days in cutting

and bringing home one of those posts, and athird day .
in driving it into the ground; for which purpose I

got a heavy piece of wood at first, but at last bethought

myself of one of the iron crows, which however,

though I found it, yet it made driving those posts or

piles very laborious and tedious work. ' '

But what need I have been concerned at the tedi-

ous'ness of any thing I had to do, seeing I had time

enough to do it in? Nor had I any other employment ._
if that had been over, at least that I could foresee,
except the ranging the island to seek for food, which
I did more or less every day.
. -I now began to consider seriously my condition,
and the circumstance l was reduced to, and I drew
up the state of my affairs in writing, not so much to-
leave them to any that were to come after me, for I
was like to .have but few heirs, .as to deliver my
thoughts from daily poring upon them, and afflicting
my mind ; and as my reason began now to master'my
despondency, I began to comfort myself as well as I
could, and to set the good against the evil that I might
have something to distinguish my case from worSe ;
and I stated it very impartially, like debtor and cre-
ditor the comforts I enjoyed against the miseries I
suffered, thus

But God wonderfully
sent the ship in .near
enough to the shore, that
I have gotten out so many
necessary things as will
either supply my wants,
or enable me to supply
inyself even as long as I
we. *

Upon the whole, here was an undoubted testimony,
that there was scarce any condition in the world so
miserable, but there was something negative or some-
thing positive to be thankful for in it; and let this
_ stand as a direction from the experience of the most
miserable of all conditions in this world, that we may
always find in it something to comfort ourselves from,
and to set, in the-description of good and evil, on the

credit side of the account.

Having now brought my mind a little to relish my
condition, and given Over looking out to sea, to see.
if I could Spy a ship ; I say, giving over these things,
I began to apply myself to accommodate my way of
living, and to make things as easy to me as I could. .
I have already described my habitation, which was
a tent-under the side of a rock, surrounded'with' a
strong pale of posts and cables ; but I might now ra>>
ther call it a, wall, for I raised a kind of wall up against
it of turfs, about two foot thick on the outside; and

,- after some time, I think it was a year and half, I
raised rafters from it, leaning to the rock, and thatch-
ed or covered it with boughs of trees, and such things
as I could get to keep out the rain, which I found at
some times of the year very violent.

I have already observed how I brought all m goods
into this pale, and into the cave which I ha made
behind me : but I must observe too that at first this
was a confused heap of goods, which as they lay inho
order, so they tack up all my place : I'had no room
to turn myself; so I set myself to enlarge my cave,
and work farther into the earth ; for it was a loose
sandy rock, which yielded easily to the labour 1 be-
stowed on it ; and so when I found I was pretty safe
as to beasts of prey, I worked sideways to the right.
hand into the rock ; and then, turning to the right
again, worked quite out, and made me a door to
come out, on the outside of my pale or fortification.

This gave me not only egress and regress, as it were

a back-way to my tent and to my storehouse, but
gave me room to stow my goods.
. And now I began to apply myself 'to make suah
necessary things as I found I most wanted, particu- '
Iarly a chair and a table ; for without these I was not-
able to enjoy. the few comforts I had in the world ; I

. could not write or eat, or do several things with so
much pleasure without a table. , '

_ So I went to work ; and here I must needs observe,-
hat as reason is the substance and original of the ma-
thematics, so by stating and squaring every thing by
reason; and by making the most rational judgment of
things, every man may be in time master of 'every
mechanic art. I had never handled a tool in my life,
' and yet in time, by labour, application, and contriv-'t
ancefl found at last that I wanted nothing but lcould _. '0? 'nomNeon censor: '69

have made it, especially if I had had tools; however, -
I made abundance of things, even without tools, and
some with no more tools than an adzeand a hatchet,
which perhaps were never made that way before, and
that with infinite labour: for example, if I wanted a
board, I had no other way but to cut down a tree, set
it on an edge before me, and hew it flat on either side
with my axe, till I had brought it to be as thin as a
plank, and then dub it smooth with my adze. It is
'true, by this method I could make but one board out
of a whole tree; but this I had no remedy for but
patience, any more than I _had for. the prodigiOus
deal of time and labour which it took me up to make
a plank or board: but my time or labour was little
worth, and so. it was as well employed one way as
another.

However, I; made me a table and a chair, as I ob-
served above, in the first place; and this I did out of
the short pieces of boards that I brought on my raft
from the ship: but when I had wrought out some
boards, as above, I made large shelves of the breadth
of a foot and a half one over another, all along one
side of my cave, to lay all my tools, nails, and-iron.
work, and 'in a word, to separate every thing at large
in their places, that I might come easily at them. I
knocked pieces in the wall of the rock to hang my
guns and all things that would hang up. '

So that, had my cave been to be seen, it looked
like a general magazine of all necessary things; and
I had every thing so ready at my hand, that it was a
great pleasure to me'to see all my goods in such or-- ,
der, and especially to find my stock of all necessa-
ries so great. . -

And now it was that I began to keep a journal of
every day's employment; for indeed at first I was in
too much a hurry; and not only hurry as to labour,
but in too much discomposure of mind, and my
journal would have been full of many dull things.
For examp e I must have said .thus: Sept. the ,50th,
after I got to shore, and had escaped drowning, in

/
stead of being thankful to God for my deliverance,
having first vomited with the' great quantity of salt
water which was gotten into my stomach, and reco-
Vering myself a little, I ran about the shore, wringing
my hands, and beating my head and face, exclaiming'
at my misery, and crying out, I was undone, undone;
till tired and faint I 'was forced to lie doWn on the
ground to repose, but durst not sleep for fear of be-
ing devoured. , '
ome days after this, and after I had been on board
the ship, and got all that Icould out of her, yet I
could not .forbear getting up to the top of a'little
mountain, and looking out to sea in hapes of seeing a.'
ship; than fancy at a vast distance I spie'd'a sail;
please myself with the hopes of it; and then after
looking steadily till I was almost blind, lose it quite,
and sit down and weep like a child, and thusin-
crease my misery by my folly. '
. But having gotten over these things in some mea'
sure, and having settled my household-stuff and ha-
bitation, made me a table and a chair, and all as
handsome about me as I could, I began to keep my '
- journal, of which I shall here give you the com
_ (though in it will be told all these particulars over
again) as long as it lasted; for having no more ink, I
was forced to leave it off. ' ' '

THE JOURNAL.
September 30,1659. .

I POOR miserable Robinson Crusoe, being ship- '
_ wrecked, during a dreadful storm in the offing,-
came on shore on this dismal unfortunate island,
which I called the Island of Despair; all the rest of
the ship's company being drowned, and myself :11-

most dead. / , . _
All the rest of that day I spent in afflicting myself

at the dismal circumstances I was brought to viz. I
had neither food, house, clothes, weaponyor place to
fly to, and in despair of any relief, saw nothing but
death before me, either that I should be devoured by
wild beasts, murdered by savages, or starved to death
fur-want of food. At the approach of night I slept
in a tree, for fear of wild. creatures, but slept soundly,
though it rained all night. .
Octdber I. In the morning I saw, to my great sur-
prise, the ship had floated with the high tide, and was
driven on shore again much nearer-the island; which
as it was some comfort on one hand, for seeing her
Sit upright, and not broken to pieces, I ho ed, if the
wind abated, I might get' on board, an get some
food and necessaries out of her. for- my relief; so on
the other hand, it renewed, my grief at the loss of my
comrades, who I imagined, if we had all staid on
. board, might have saved the ship, or at least that they
would not have been all drowned, as they were; and
that, had the men been saved, we might perhaps have
built; us a boat out Of the ruins of the ship, to have
carried us to some other part of the world. I spent
great part of this day in perplexing myself on these
things; but at length, seeing the ship almost dry, I
Went upon the sand as' near as "I could, and then
swam on board. deg This day also it continued raining,
though with no wind at all. -
From the 1st of October to the 24th. All these
days entirely spent in many several voyages to get all
I could out of the ship, which I brought on shore,
every tide of flood, upon rafts. Much rain-also in
these days, though with some intervals of fair wea- '
ther: but, it seems, this was the rainy season. ' "
' Oct. 20. I overset my raft, and all the goods I had
got up upon it; but being in shoal water, and the
things being chiefly heavy, I recovered many of them
whenthe tide was<out. '
Oct. 25, It rained all night and all day, with some
gusts of wind ; during which time the ship broke in
pieces, the wind blowing a litttle harder than .before,

and was no more to be seen, except the wreck of her,
and that only at low water. I spent this day in
covering and scouring the goods which I had saved,
that rain might not spoil them. .

Oct; 26. I walked about the shorealmost all day,
to find out a place to fix my habitation, greatly con-
cerned to secure myself from'any attack in the night,
either from wild beasts or men. Towards night I
fixed upon a proper place under a rock, and marked
out a semicircle for my encampment, which ,I resolv-
ed to strengthen with a work, wall, or fortification
made of double piles, lined within with cable, and
without with turf. , ' --

' From the 26th to the 30th I worked very hard~ in
carrying all my goods to my new habitation, though
some part of the time it rained exceeding hard.

The Slst in the morning I went out into the island
with my gun, to see for some food, and discover the
country; .when I killed a-she-goat, and-her kid fol-

lowed me home, which I afterwards killed also, be-
eause it would not feed. - '
November 1. I set up my tent under a rock, and
lay there for the first night, making it as large as!
could'with stakes driven in to swing my hammock
u on. .
ApNov. 2._ I set up all my' chests and boards, and the
pieces of timber which made my rafts, and with them

' formed a fence round me, a little Within the place I

had marked out for my. fortification.

Nov. 3. ,I went out with my gun, and killed two
fowls like ducks, which were very good food. In the
afternoon went to work to make me a table. -

Nov. 4. This morning I began to order my times of
work, of going out with my gun, time of sleep, and

ime of diversion; viz. every morning I walked out
with my gun for two or three hours, if it did not rain,
then employed myself to work till about eleven
o'clock, then ate what I .had to live on, and from
twelve to two I lay down to sleep, the weather being
excessive hot, and then in the evening to work again :
the working part of this day and of .the next were

\--
wholly employed in making my table, for If-was yet

but a very sorry- workman, though time and necessity

made me a complete natural mechanic soon after, as
~l~ believe it would do any one else.

Nov. 5. This day went ' abroad with my gun and '

my dog, and killed a wild cat, her skin pretty soft,
b t her flesh good for nothing , every creature I killed
took off the skins and preserved them, Coming

ack by the sea-shoreI saw many sorts of sea-{owls _'

which. I did not understand ;' but was surprised and
almost frighted with two or three seals, which, while

got into the sea, and escaped me for that time.

Nov. 6. After my morningwalk I went to work

liking; nor was it long before I learnt to mend it.
Nov. 7. Now it began to be settled fair weather.'

The 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, and part of the lfith (for the

llth was Sunday), I took wholly up to make me a-

I
,I

'with my table again, and finished it, though not to my _,

chair, and with much ado brought it to a tolerable '

shape, but never to please me; and even in the making
I pulled it in pieces several times. Note, I soon neg-
lected my keeping Sundays, for omitting my mark for
them on my post, I forgot which was which.

Nov. 13. This day it. rained, which refreshed me '

exceedingly, and cooled the earth, but it was accom--
panied with terrible thunder and lightning, which
frighted me dreadfully for fear of my powder: as'
soon as it was over I resolved to separate my stock of
powder into as many little parcels as possible, that
it might not be in danger. -
Nov, 14, 15, 16. These three days I spent in making
ittle square chests or boxes, 'which might hold about
. pound, or two pound, at most, of powder; and so
utting the powder in, I stowed it in places'as secure
nd remote from one another as possible. On one
of these three days I killed a large 'bird that was
good to eat, but I knew not what to call it.
Nov. 17. This day I began to dig behind my tent

I was gazing at, not well knowing what they were, ; "
into the rock, to make room for my farther conveni-
ency. Note, Three things I wanted exceedingly for
this work, viz. a pickaxe, a shovel, and a wheel-ban
rower basket; so I desisted from my work, and be-

.gan to consider how to supply that want, and make

me some tools: as for a pickaxe, I made use of the
iron crows, which 'wcre proper enough, though

heavy; but the next thing Was a shovel or spade;

this was so absolutely necessary, that indeed I eouli
do nothing effectually without it; but what kind of
one to make I knew not. _ v .

Nov. 18. The next day in searching the woods I
found a tree of that wood, or like it, which .in the .
Brasils they call the iron tree, for its exceeding hard-
ness: of this, with great labour and almost spoiling
my axe, I cut a piece, and brought it home too with
difficulty enough,'for it was exceeding heavy. -

"\ The excessive hardness of the wood, and having

no other wa , made me a long while upon this ma-
chine; for worked it effectually by little and little
into the form of a shovel or spade, the handle exactly
shaped like ours in England, only that the broad part
having no iron shod upon it at bottom, it would not
last me so long; however, it served well enough for

the uses which I had occasion to put it to; but never

was" a shovel, I believe, made after this fashion, or

' so long a making. .

I was still deficient, for I wanted a'bas'ket or r:
Wheel-barrow; a basket'I cauld not. make by any
means, having no such things as tw1gs._that would

. bend to make Wicker-ware, at least none yet found
, out ; and as to awheel-barrow, I fancied I could make
all but the wheel, but that I had no notion of, neither

did I know how to go about it; besides, I had no pos-
sible way to make the iron gudgeons for the spindle

brands of the wheel to run in, so I gave it over; and

so for carrying away the earthwhich I dug out oftha
cave, I made me a thing like a bed which the labour-
ers carry mortar in, when they serve the hricklayers;

This was not so difficult to me as the making the
shovel; and yet this, and the shovel, and the attempt
whichI made in vain to make a wheel-barrow, took
me up no less than four days, I mean always except-
ing my morningj'walk with my gun, which I seldom
failed; and very seldom failed also bringing home
. something to eat. , ' . . .

Nov. '23. My other work having now stood still,
because of my making these tools, when they were
finished I went on, and working every day, as my
- strength and time allowed, I spent eighteen daysren-
tirely in widening and deepening my 'cave, that it
might hold my goods commodiously. ' ' -

Note, Daring all thistime, I worked to make this
room or cave spacious enough to accommodate meas
a- warehouse or magazine, a kitchen, a dining-room,
and a cellar: as for my lodging,_ I kept to the tent,
eXcept that sometimes. in the wet Season of the year,
it rained so hard that I could not keep myself dry,
which eaused me afterwards to cover all my place
' within my pale with long poles in the form of rafters,
leaning against the rock, and load them with flags
and large leaves of trees like a thatch.

Dec. 10. I began now 'to think my cave or vault
finished, when on a sudden (it seems I had made it
too large) a great quantity of earth fell down from the
' .top and one side, so much that in short it frighted me,
and net without reason too; for if I had been under'
it I had never wanted a gravedigger. Upon this dis-
aster I had a great deal of work to do over again; for
I had the loose earth to carry out, and, which was of
more importance, I had the ceiling to prep up, So that
1 might be sure no more would come down.

Dec. 11. This day I went to work with it accord-
ingly, and got two shores or posts pitched upright to
the top, with twopieces of boards across over each
post; this I finished the next day; and setting more
posts up with boards, in about a week more I had the
roof secured ; and the posts, standing in rows, served
me for partitions to part off my house.

. .Dec. 17. From this day to the twentieth I placed
'26 LIFE AND ADVENTURES

shelves, and knocked up nails on the posts to hang
every thing up that could be hung up: and now I
began to be in some order within doors. '
Dec. 20. Now I carried every thing into the cave,
and began to furnish myhouse, and set up some

pieces of boards like a dresser, to order my victua'ls -

upon; but beards began to be very scarce'with me :
also 1 made me another table. ' j

Dec. 27. Killed a young goat, and lamed another,
so that I caught it, and led it home in a string; when
Ifhad it home, I bound and splintered up its leg,
Which was broke. ' N. B. I took such care of it that
it lived, and the leg grew well and as strong as ever;
but by nursing it so long it grevq tame, and'fed upon
the-little green at my door, and would not goaway.
.This was the first time that I entertained a thought
of breeding up some 'tame creatures, that I might
have food when my powder and shot was all Spent. _'

Dec. 28, 29, 30. Great heatsand no breeze; so that
there was no stirring abroad, except in the evening

for food. This time I spent in putting all my things

'in order within 'doors. '
' January 1. Very hot still, but I went abroad early '-

and late with my gun, and lay still in the middle of
the day. This evening, going farther into the vallies,
which lay towards the centre of the island, I found
there was plenty of goats, though exceeding shy and
hard to come at; however, I resolved to try if I
could not bring my dog to hunt them down. .
Jan. 2. Accordingly, the next day I went out with
my dog, and set him upon the' goats; but I was mis-
taken, for they all faced about upon the dog; and he
knew his danger too well, for he would not conic
near them. .
J an..3. I began my fence or wall; which, being
still jealous of ' my being attacked by somebody, I re-
solved to make very thick and strong; . .'
' N. B. This wall being described before, I pure
poselybmit what was said,~in the Journal ; it
' is suificient to observe, that I was no less time
than from the 3d of January to the 14th of
April, working, finishing, and perfecting this
wall, though it was no more than about twenty-
four yards in length, being a half-circle from
one place in the :'I'OCk to another place about
eight yards frOm it, the door of the cave being
in the centre behind it. . . ' . -
Kll this time I worked very hard, the rains hinder.
ing me many days, nay, sometimes weeks together ;
but I thought .I should never be perfectly secure until
this wall was finished; and it is scarce credible what
inexpressible labour every thing was done with,.espe-
cially the bringing piles out of the woods, and driving
them into the ground, for I made them much bigger.
than I need to have done. - . g. _
When this wall was finiShed, and the outside double
fenced with a turf wall raised up close to it, I per-
suaded myself that if any peOple were to come on
shore there, they, would not perceive any thing like a
habitation ; and'it was very well I did so, as maybe
observed hereafter upona very remarkable occasion.
. During this time I made my rounds in the woods
for game every day, when the rain admitted me, and
made frequent discoveries in these walks of something
or other to my advantage; particularly I found 'a kind
of wild pigeons, who built not as wood igeons in a
tree, but rather as house pigeons, in the holes of the
rocks ; and taking some'young ones, I endeavoured to
breed them up tame, and did so; but when they grew
older they flew away, which perhaps at first was for
want of feeding them, for I had nothing to give them; ,
~ however, I frequently found their nests, and got their
young ones,' which were very good meat.
And now, in the managing my household affairs, I
found myself wanting in many things, which I
thought atifirst it was impossible for me to make, as!

indeed as to some of them it was; for instance, I
could never make a cash to be hooped; I had a.

small runlet or two, as I observed'before, but I could -

never arrive to the capacity of making one by them,
though- I spent many weeksiabout it; I could neither
put'inythe heads, or joint the slaves so'true to ,on'
another as to make them hold'water: so I gave that
we: also. . , -
"In the next place, I was at a great loss for candle;

so that as soon as ever it was dark, which was gene.
rally by seven o'clock, I was obliged to go to bed : . I

- remembered the lum of bees-wax with which I

made candles in my ~ frican adventure, but I had
none of that now ; the only' remedy I had, was, that"
when I had killed a goat I saved the tallow, and with
.a little dish made of"olay, which I baked-in the sun,
to which I added a wick of some oakum, I made me

' a' lamp ;. and this gave me light, though not a'clear

hf

.J_ .>

I

steady light like a candle. In the-middle of all my.

labours it happened, that, rummaging my things, I
" .. fonnd a little bag, which, as I hinted before, had been
-';filled with corn for the feeding of poultry, not for this

voyage, but before, as I suppose, when the ship came.

from Lisbon'; what little remainder of corn had been ,

in the bag, was all. devourded'with the rats, and I saw.

nothing in" the beg but husks and dust; and 'being.

willing to have the bag for some other use, I think it
was- to put powder in, when I divided it for fear of
the lightning, or some such use, I shook the husks of

'corn out of it on one side of my fortification tinder

the rock. . _ t
It was a. little before the great rains, joist now then

' tioned, that I threw this stuff away, taking no notice

of anything, and not, so much as remembering that

'hndthtOWn any thing there; when about a month-

aftei'fi'dr thereabout, I saw some few stalks of some-

. J . thing green shooting out of the ground, which 1 fan-

,ciedinight'be some, plant I had not seen ; but I was
surprised and perfectly astonished, when after a little

I
longer time I saw about ten ontwelve ears come out;
which were perfect green barley of the same kind'as
our European, nay, as our English barley. -

It is impossible to express the astonishment and
confusion of my thoughts on this occasion ; 'I had .
hitherto acted upon no religious fanndzi'tion at. all;
indeed I had very few notiOns of religion in my _
head, or had entertained any sense of any thing the.
had befallen me, otherwise than as a chance, or, a
we lightly say, what pleases God ; without so much as
inquiring into the end of Providence in these things,
or 'his' order 'in governing events in the'world; but
after I saw barley grow there, in a climate which I
knew was not proper forcorn, and especially that I
knew not how it came there, it startled me strangely,
and I began to suggest, that 'God had miraculously
caused this grain to grow without any help of seed '
sown, and that it was so directed purely for my sus'o
tenance on that wild miserable place; '

This touched my heart a little, and brought tears .
out of my eyes, and I'bega'n to bleSs myself, that .
such a progidy of nature should happen upon my ac-
count; and this was the more. strange to me, b'ecause
I saw near it still, all along by the side of the rock,
some other straggling stalks, which proved to be
stalks of rice, and which I know, because I had seen
it grow in Africa, when I was ashore there.

I not only thought these the pure productions of
Providence for my support,'but not doubting but that i
there was more in the place, I went all over that part
of the island, where I had been before, peeping in
every corner and under every rock to see for more of
it, but I could not find any; at last it occurred tomy
thought, that I had shook a bag of chicken's meat out
in that place, and then the wonder began, to cease;
and I must confess, my religious thankfulness to
God's rovidence began to abate too upon discovering
that 1 this was nothing but what was common;'
though I ought to have been as thankful far so strange
and unfereseen a providence as if it had been miracu~
lous : for it was really the work of Providence as to _
me, that should order or appoint ten or twelve grains
of corn to remain -un5poiled, when the rats had de-
stroyedall thetfrest, as if it had been dropped from .
[heaven 5 as also, that I should throw it out in that

, particular place, Where, it being in the shade of a

igh rock, it sprang up immediately ;-- whereas if I
had thrown itany where .else at that time, it had been -
burntup and destroyed. . ' . . " '

. I carefully saved the ears of corn, you may be sure,
in their season, which was about the end of June, and
laying up every corn, I resolved to sow them all
again, haping~ in time to have somequantity sufficient
10' supply me with bread ; but it was not till the
fourth year that I could allow myself the least grain
of this corn to eat, and even then but sparingly, as I
shall say afterwards in its order; for I lost all that I
sowed the first season, by not observing the proper
time; for I sowed" it just before the dry season, so
that it never came up at all, at least not as it would
have done: of which in its place. ' .

. Besides this barley there were, as above, twenty or
shitty stalks of "rice which I preserved with the same
.care, and whose use was of the same kinder to the
. same purpose, viz. to make me bread, or rather
food ; for I found ways to cook it up'without baking,,
though I didthat also after some time. But to return
:30. my journal. ' , , , '

p . I worked excessive hard these three or four months
ridget my wall done; and the 14th of April I closed
'it' upcontriving to go'into it, not by a door but over _
:the wall bya ladder, that there might be no sign in

the outside of my habitation.

April 16.>> lfinished the ladder; so I went up with
'the'ladder- to the top, and then pulled it up after me,
and let it down on the inside : this was a complete
enclosure to me ; for within I had room enough, and
admin .could come at, me from without, unless it
_ ,eould rst mount my wall. ' _ .

"The very next day after this wall was finished,- I
had almost had all my labour overthrown at once, and
myself killed'; the case was thus : As I was busy in
the inside of it behind my tent, just in the entrance '
into my cave, I was terribly frightened with a most
dreadful surprising thing indeed 5 for on a sudden I
found theearth come crumbling'down from the roof
of my cave, and from the edge of the hill, over my
head and two of. the posts I hadset up in the cave
cracked in a frightful manner'; I was heartily scared,
but thought nothing of what was really the cause,
only thinking that the top of my cave, was falling in
_ as some of it had done before ; and for fear I should
be buried in-it, I ran forward to my ladder, and not
thinking myself safe there neither, I got over my wall
for fear of the pieces of the hill which I expected '
' (might roll down upon me. I was, no sooner stept
down upon the firm ground, but I plainly saw it was
a terrible earthquake, for the ground I stood on shook
three times at about eight minutes distance, with three
such shocks, as would have'overtumed the strongest
building that could be supposed to have stood" on the
earth ; and a great piece of the t0p. of a rock, which
stood about half a mile from me next the sea, fell
down' with such a terrible noise as I never heard in
all my life : I perceived also the very sea was put in
violent motion by it; and I believe the shocks were
stronger under the Water than on the island.

I was so amazed with the thing itself, having never
felt the like, or discoursed with any one that had, that .
I was like one dead or stupified ; and the motion'of
the earth made my stomach sick, like one that was
tossed at sea ; but the noise of the falling of the rock
awaked me, as it were, and rousing me from the stu- '
pificd condition I was in, filled me with horror, and I
thought of nothing then but the hill falling upon my
tent and all rny household goods, and burying all at
once; and this sunk my verysoul within me a second
:tnne. " ' '

After the third shock vg'as over, and I felt no more

6 ~ . . 2 - ' 'for some time, 1 began to take courage, and yet I had
nothean enough to get over my wall again, for 'fear
of ' being buried alive, but sat still upon the ground,
greatly cast clown and disconsolate, not knowing what
to do. fAllthis whilel had not the least serious reli-
gious thought, nothing but the common " Lord have
mercy upon me, !" and when it was over, that [went
away too. .
While I sat thus, I found the air overcast, and grow
cloudy. as if" it wbuld rain ; soon after that the wind
rose by little'and little, so that in less than half an
incur, it blew a most dreadful hurricane ; the sea was
all on a sudden covered over with foam and froth,
theshore was covered with the breach of the water,
the trees were torn up' by the roots, and a terrible
storm it was; and this held about three hours, and
then began to abate, and in two hours more it was
stark calm, and began to ram 'very hard.
' 'All this'while I sat upon the ground, very much
terrified and dejected, when on a sudden it came into.
my thoughts, that these winds and rain being the con-
sequence of theearthquake, the earthquake itself was
spent and over, and I might venture into my cave
again ; with this thought my spirits began to revive,
and the rain also helping to persuade me, I went in
and sat down in my tent; but the rain was so violent,

' , that my tent was ready to be beaten down with it:

and I was forced to go into my cave, though very
inucih afraid and uneaSy, for fear it should fall on my
. iea . ' '

'- The violent rain forced me into anew work, viz. to
cut a hole through my new fortification like a sink, to._
let water go out, which would else have drowned my
cave. .After 'I had been in my cave some time, and
found still no more shocks of the earthquake follow,
I began to be more composed; and now, to support
my spirits, which indeed wanted it very much,l went
to my little store, and took a small sup" of rum, which
however I did then and always very sparingly, know-
ing I could have no more when that was gone.
- It-continuegii'aining all that night, and~ great part of
the next day, so that I could not stir abroad ; but my ~
mind beingfmore com osed, I began to think of what
I had best do, conclu ing that if the island was sub-
ject to these earthquakes, there would be no living for
me in a cave, but I must consider of building me ,
some little but in an open place, which I might sur-
round with a wallas I had done here, and so make '
myself secure from wild beasts or men: but conclud--
ed, if I staid where I was, I should certainly, one
time or other, be buried alive. ; . '

With these thoughts I resolved to remove my. tent
from the place where it stood, which was just under
\the hanging precipice of the hill, and which, if it
should be shaken again, would certainly fall upon my
tent; And I spent the two next days, being the 19th
and 20th of April, in contriving where and how to
remove my habitation. - _ - ' h.

The fear of being swallowed up alive, made me
that 1 never slept in quiet, and yet the apprehension
of lying abroad without any fence was almbst equal
to it; but still, whenI looked about and saw how
every thing was put in order, how pleasantly conceal.
- ed I was, and how safe from danger, it made me ve
10th to remove. . .

In the' mean time it occurred to me that it would
require a vast deal of time for meto do this, and that
I must be contented to run the venture where I was,
till I had. formed a camp for myself, and had secured
it so as, to remove to it. So with this resolution I
composed myself for a time, and resolved that ,1,
would go to work with all speed to build me a wall
with piles and cables, &c. in a circle as before; and
set my tent up in it when it was finished, but that I
would venture to stay where I was till it was finished
and fit to remove to. This was the 21 st.

April 22. The next morning I began to consider of
means to put this resolve in execution, but I was at a
great loss about my tools. I had three large axes and
abundance of hatchets (for we carried the hatchets fora4 LIFE AND Anvmwans

trafic withthe Indians) :-' but with Fifi'ch chopping
and 'cutting knotty hard wood, they were all full of
notches and dull ; and though I had a grindstone, I
could notturn it and grind mytools too : this cost me
as much thought as a-statesmah would have bestowed
. 'upon a grand point of politics, or a judge upon the

life and death of a man. At length I contrived a
wheel with a string, to turn it with my foot, that I
might have both my'hands at liberty. Note, I had
never seen any such thing in England, or at least not
to take notice how it was done, though since I have
observed it was very common there ; besides that my
grindstone was very large and heavy. Thismachine
cost me a full week's work to bring it to perfection.

' April 28, 29. ' These two whole days I tocik up in
grinding my tools, my'machine for turningmy grind--
stone performing very well. ' , '

. 'April 30. Having perceived my bread had been
low a great 'while, nowI took a survey of it and re'.
duced myself to one biscuit-cake a day, which made
my heart very heavy. , ' . >

May 1. In the morning, looking toward the sea-

side, the tide beingllow, I saw something lie on the
shore bigger than ordinary; and it looked like a cask;
when I came to it, I_ found a small barrel, and two or
, three pieces of the wreck of the ship, which were
driven on shore by the late hurricane ; and-looking
toivards the wreck itself, I thought it seemed to lie'
. higher out of the water than it'used to do. I examin-
a ed the barrel which was driven on shore, and soon
found'it was a barrel of gunpowder, but it had taken
water, and the powder was caked as hard as a stone;
however, I rolled it farther on shore for the present,
and went'on upon the sand as near as I could to the
Wreck of the ship, to look for more. . _
. When I came down to the ship, I found it strangely
removed; the forecastle, which lay before buried in
sand, was heaved up at least six foot ; and the stern,
which was broke to pieces, and parted from the rest
by the force of the sea, soon after I had left rumma~
ing her, was tossed, as it were, up, and cast on one
side, and the sand was thrown so high "on that side
next her stern, that whereas there was a great place of
water before, so that I could not come within a quar-
ter of a mile of the wreck without swimming; I could
now walk quite up to her when the tide was out. I
was surprised with this at first, but soon concluded it
.must'be done by the earthquake : and as by this vio-
lence the ship was more broken open than formerly
so many things came daily on shore, which the sea
had loosened, and which the winds and water rolled
by degrees to the land. . . -' p

This wholly diverted my thoughts from the design
of removing my habitation; and I busied myself
' mightily, that day especially, in searching whether I
Could make any way into the ship; but I found no-
thing was to be expected of that kind, for that all the
. inside of the ship was choked up with sand: however
as I learnt not to despair of. any thing, I resolves
to pull every thing to pieces that I could of the ship,
concluding, that every thing I could get from her
would be of some use 'or other tome; . ' .

May 3. I began with my saw, and cut apiece of a
beam through, which I thoughtheld some of the upper
part or quarter-deck tbgether, and' when I had cut it
through, I cleared away the sand as well as Icould _
from the side which. lay highest; but the tide coming
in, I was obliged to give over for that time. - _

May. 4. I went a-fishing, but caught not one fish
that I durst eat of, till I was weary of my sport ;
when just going to leave off, I caught a young dolphin.
I had made me a long line of some rope-yarn, but I
had no books, yet I frequently caught fish enough, as
much as I cared to eat; all Which I'dried in the'sun, '
and ate them dry. V '

May 5. Worked on the wreck, out another beam
asunder, and brought three great fir planks off from
the decks, which I tied together, and made swim on
shore when the tide of flood came on. '

May 6. Worked on the wreck, got several iron
bolts out o'f her, and other pieces of iron-werk;
worked 'very hard, and came home very much tired,
and had. th'oughts'of giving it over. . __-
May'7'.'Went to the wreck again, but'with an intent
not to work, but found the'weight of the wreck hail
broke itself down, the heamsbeing cut, that'several
pieces of the ship seemed to lie loose, and the inside
of the hold lay so open, that I could 'see into it, but

almost full of water and sand.

. May 8. Went to the wreck, and carried an irtm
crow. to wrench up the deck, which lay now quite

- clear of the water or sand; 1 wrenched Open two
, planks, and brought them on shore also with the tide -
'l lelf the iron crew in the wreck- for next day.

. May 9. Went to the wreck, and with the crow
made way into the body of the wreck, and felt several
casks,' and loosened them with the crow, but cauld
not break them up: Ifelt also the roll of Englieh
lead, and could stir it, but it wastoo heavy to remove.
May 10, 11, 12, 13, I4. Went every day to the
wreck, and got a great many pieces of timber, and
boards, or plank, and two or three hundred weight 01
iron. ' - . - .
, May 15'. I carried two hatchets, to try if Icould
not cut 'a. piece off the roll of lead, by placing the
edgeof one hatchet and driving it with the other;

' '_ but as it lay about a foot and a half in the Water, I

o

, . could not make. any blow to drive the hatchet.

May 16, It-had blown hard in thevnight, and the

"wreck appeared more broken by the force of the

water; but I staid so long in the woods to get pigeons
for food, that the. tide prevented me going to the

Wreck that day. -
May 17. I saw some pieces of the wreck blown on

shore, at a great distance, near two miles off me, but

" resolved to see what they were, and found it was a
sprees of the head, but too heavy for me to bring away.

:13. :2

.'-:-%SS;;;{May 24. Everyday to this day I worked on the

. , wreck, and with hard labour I loosened some things

' "so much with the crew, that the first flowing tide
several cases floated out, and two of' the seamen's
chests; but the wind blowing from the shore, nothing
came to land that day but pieces of timber, and a "
hogshead, which had some Brazil pork in it, but the -
salt water and the sand had spoiled it. ' a .

I continued this work every day to the 15th of J une,
except the time necessary to get food, which I always
appointed, during this part of- my employment, . to be
when the tide was up, that I might be ready when it
was ebbed out; and by this time I had gotten timber,
and plank, and ironwork enough to have built a good
boat, if 'I had known how; and also I got at several-
times, and in several pieces, near one hundred weight
of the sheet-lead. - . ;

June 16. Going down to the sea-side, I; feund a
large tortoise or turtle: this was the first I had seen,
which it seems was only my misfortune, not any de'. .
fect of the place, or scarcity; for bad I happened to
be on the other side of the island, I mighthave had
hundreds of them every day, asI-found afterwards;
but perhaps had paid dear enough for them. _

June 1 7. I spent in cooking the turtle; Ifound in her
threescore eggs; and her flesh was tome at that time _
the most savory and pleasant that ever Itasted in my
life, having had no flesh, but of goats and fowls, since
I landed in this horrid place. t . ,

_ June 18. Rained all day, and stayed within. I
thought at this time the rain felt cold , and I was
something chilly, which I knew was not 'usual in that '
latitude. _ . ' ' l .

June 19. Very ill, and shivering, as if the weather
' had been'cold. A '

June 20. No rest all night, violent pains in 'rny
head, and feverish. , ,

June 21. Very ill, frighted almost to death with the
apprehensions of my sad condition, to be sick, and
- no help. Prayed to God for the first time since the
storm off Hull, but scarce knew what I said, or Why ;~
my thoughts being all confused. - - s '
, June 22: A little better, but under dreadful appre-
. hensions of sickness. ' ~ :
.' June '23. Very bad again, cold and shivering, and
'-' then a violent headach.

June 24.. ' Much better. ' ,,

June 25. An ague very violent; the fit held me
seven hours, cold fit'and hot, with faint sweats after it

June. 28. >> Better; and having no victuals to eat
took my gun, but found myself very weak; however
I killed a .she goat; and with much difficulty 'goti
home, and broiled some of it, and ate; I would fain

- have stewed it, and made some broth, but had no pot.

June 27. The ague again so violent, thatI lay abed
all day; and neither ate or drank. I was ready to
perish for thirst, but so weakl had not strength to stand
,up, or to get myself any water to drink. Prayed to
God again, but was light-headed ; and when I was not

' I was so ignorant, that I knew not what to say; only
I lay and cried, " Lord look upon me! Lord pity
me, Lord have mercy: upon me!" I suppose I did ~
nothing else for two or three hours, till the fit wearing
off, I fell asleep, and did not wake till far in the night;
when] I waked, I' found myself much refreshed, but
weak, and exceeding thirsty: however, as I had no
water in my whole habitation, I- was forced to lie till
morning, and went to sleep again. In this second

Tsleep I had this terrible dream. -

I thought that. I was sitting on the ground on the
outside of my wall, where I sat when the storm blew
after the earthquake, and that I saw a man descend

' from a great black cloud, in a bright flame of fire, and. .
light upon the ground. He was all over as bright as
a flame, so that I could but just hear to 'look towards-
him; his ecuntenance was most inexpressibly dread-
ful. impossible for words to describe; when he step-
ped upon the ground with his feetI thought the earth
trembled, just as it had done before in the earthquake,
and all the air looked to my apprehension as if it had
been filled with flashes offire. - - '

I
He was no sooner landed upon the earth,.buthe
moved forwards towards me,; with a long-spearor
. weapon in his hand to kill me; and when he Came '

to a rising ground, at some distance, he spoke to me,

or I heard a voice so terrible, math is impossible to
express the terror of it ; all that I can say I under.
stood-was this, " Seeing all these things have not
brought thee to repentance, new thou shalt die g" at,
which Words I thought'he lifted up the Spear that was

in. his hand to kill me. ' ,

' 'No one, that shall ever read this account, will ex.

pect that I should be able to describe the horrors of
I: my scul at this terrible vision; I mean, that even- while

it was a dream, I even dreamed of those horrors;
nor is it any more. possible to describe the impression
that remained upon my mind, when I awaited; and
found it was but a dream. ~ . ',

I had, alas ! no divine knowledge; what I had re-
ceived-by the good instruction of. my father was then
worn out by an uninterrupted series, for eight. years,
of seafaring wickedness, and a constant conversatioii
with nothing but such as 'were, like myself, wicked
and profane to the last degree. I do not remember
that I had in all'that time one thought that so much
as, tended either to looking upwards toward God, or
inwards towards a reflection upon my own ways.
But a certain stupidity ofsoul, without desire of good,
or conscience of evil, had entirely overwhelmed me,
and I was all that the most hardened, unthinking,
wicked creature among our common sailors can be

, supposed to be, not having the least sense, either of
the fear of God in danger, or of thankfulness to God
in deliverance. . '

In the relating what is already past of my story,
this will be the more easily believed, whcnl shall add,
that through'all the variety of miseries that had to-
this day befallen' me, I never had. so much as one
thought of it being the hand of God, or that it was a.
just punishment for my sin, my rebellious behaviour
against my fether, 'or my present sins, which were
great; or so much as a punishment for the general
course of my-wicked life. When I was on the despe-
rate expedition on the desertshores of Africa, I never
had so .much as one thought of what would become of
of me; or one wish to God -to direct 'me whither 1
should go, or'to keep me from the danger which ap-
parently surrounded me, as well from voracious crea-
tures as cruel savages ; but I was merely thoughtless
of .a God, or a Providence, acted like a mere brute
from the principles of nature, and by the dictates of
. common sense only, and indeed hardly that.

When I was delivered, and taken up at sea by the ~
Portugal captain, well used, and dealt justly and ho~-
. nourably, with, as well as charitably, Ikhad not the.
least thankfulness on my thoughts. When again I
was shipwrecked ruined and in danger, of drowning
on this island, lwa's as far from remorse, or looking
on it 'asa judgment ; I only said to myself often, that
I was. an unflrtunaz'e dog, and born to, be always
miserable; " ~ ' . _

It is true, when I got on shore first here, and found
all my ships crew dro'u'rned, and myself spared, I was
surprised With a kind of extasy, and some transports
of soul, which, had the grace of God assisted, might
have come up to true thankfulness; but it ended where
it begun, in a mere common flight of joy, or, as I
may say, being glad I was alive, without the least
reflection upon the distinguishing goodness of the Hand
whichhad Sreserved me, and had singled me out to
. he preserve. , when all the rest were destroyed ; or an
inquiry why Providence had been thus merciful to
me ;. even just the same common sort of joy which
seamen generally have, after. they have got safe on _
'shOre' from a shipwreck, which they drown. all in the
next bewl of punch, and forget almost as soon as it is
over; and all the rest of my life was like it.

Even when I was afterward s, on due consideration,-
made sensible of my condition, how I was cast on this
dreadful place, out of the reach of human kind, out of
all lmpe of relief, or prospect of,1'edemption, as 59011
as I saw 'but a prospect (if-living and that I should
not starve and perish for lmnger,.all the sense- of my
afiliction wore off, and I began to be very easy, ap-
plied myself to the Works proper for my preservation
and supply, and was far enough from being afilicted'
at my condition, as a judgment from Heaven, or as
the hand. of God' against me: these were thoughts
which Very seldom entered into my head. / .
. The growing up of the-corn, 'as is hinted in my-
journal, had at first some little influence upon me,'and
began to affect me with 'seriousness,. as, long as ,I
thought it had something miraculous in. iti;'hut'as soon
as ever that part of thought was removed, all'athe'im-
~ress'ion which Was-raised from it Wore of also, as I
ave noted already. ' - f ' ' "

Even the earthquake, though nothing can be more
terrible in its nature, or more immediatelv directing
to the invisible Power which 'alone directs such things;
yet no sooner was the first fright o'ver, but the im-
pression it had made went off also. 'I had no, more
sense efGod or his" judgments, much less of the prc~
sent affliction of my circumstances being from his
hand, than if 1 had been in the most prosperouscori:
dition of life. ' . ' - ~. .

'But now, when I began-{to be sick, and a leisurely
view of the miseries of death came to place itself be-
fore me ;~ when my spirits began to sink under the
burden of strong distemper, and nature was exhaust-
ed With the violence ofthe fever; conscience, that had
slept so long, began to awake, and I began to reproach
myself with my past life, in which I had so evidently,
by unCommon wickedness, provoked the justice. of
God to lay me under uncommon strokes, and to deal
with me imso vindictive a manner. .

These reflections 'oppressed me from the second or
third day of my distemper. and in the'viol'ence, as
well of the fever as of the dreadful reproaches of my
conscience,-extorted some words from me like pray-
ing to God, though I cannot say they were either a.
prayer attended with desires, or'with hopes ; it has
rather the voice of mere fright and distress; my
thoughts were confused, the convictions great upon
my mind and the horror of dying 111 such a miserable
condition, raised vapours into my head with the mere
apprehensions; and, in these hurries of my soul, I
.knew not what my tongue mightx ex 1055: but it was
rather exclamation, such as," Lor ! what a misera
gble creature am I! If I should be sick, I shall cer<<
' tainly die for want of help, .'and what will become of
.me. l". Then the tears burstout of my eyes, and I could
"say no more for a good while.
In this interval, the good advice of my father came
to my mind; arid presently his prediction, which I
mentioned 111 the beginning- bf this story, viz. that 1f I
did take this foolish-D step, God would not bless me,
and I would have leisure hereafter to reflect upon havo
ing neglected his counsel, when there might be none
to assist in my 1,-ecoveryl~ " Now," said I aloud,
" my dear father's words are come to pass . God's
justiCe has overtaken me, and I have none to help or
..l1earn1e:I rejeered the voice of Providence, which
had mercifully put me in a posture or station of life
wherein I might have been happy and 6115 ;.but I
would neitherb see it myself nor learn .to know the
blessing of it from my parents; I left them to mourn
over my folly, and now I am left to mourn under the
consequences of? .1t; -I refused their help. and assist-
ance who would ha1e lifted me into the world, and
~ would have made every thing easy to me; and now I
have difliculties to struggle with, too great for even
nature itself to support, and no assistance, no help,
no comfort, no advice." Then I cried out, "Lord be _.
my help, for I am in great distress. i"
This was the first prayer,1 1fI might call it so, that
I had made for many years. But I retu1n to my
journal. .
June 23. Having been somewhat refreshed with
the sleep I had had, and the fit being entirely off, I
got up , and though the fright and terror of my dream
11- as very great, vet I considered, that the fit of the
ague would return again, the next day, and now was
my time>> to get something to refresh and support my.
self . when I should be ill ;'-and the first thing I did,
I filled 'a large squarefcase-bottle with water, and set
itupon my table, in reach: (if my bed 5 and to take
off the chill or aguish disposition of the water, I --put
, about a quarter 017a pint of_ rum into it, and mixed
them together; then I got me a piece of the goat's
flesh and broiled it on the coals, but could eat Very,
little. I-walked about, but was very weak, and withal

very sad'and heavy-hearted under a sense of my mi. .; ._

serable condition, dreadiii'g'gthe return of my_disteme
per-the next da . At night. I made "my supper of
three. of the rut e's eggs, which I roasted in the ashes,
and ate, as we callit, in ,th'eshell'; and this was the
first bit of meat-I had ever asked God'sblessing . to,
even, as I could remember, in, my whole life. .
After I had eaten I tried to walk; but found my.
self so weak that I could hardly carry the gun. (for I
never went out without that) : so I' ,went butl-a; little
way, and sat down uponthe ground;vlo,oking,out upon
'the sea, which was just before _rne,.',a.nd.very calm and
smooth. As I sat here, some such thoughts. as these
occurredtome: , .~ ' , ' 1., - '
What is the earth and sea of which I have seen so
_. much? Whence is it produced? And, what ant-I, and
.all the other creatures, wild and t'ame,',human and
brutal? whence are we ? -
_ Sure we are all made by some secret Power, who
formed>> the earth and sea, the air and sky; and who
is that. _ .
Then it followed most naturally -: it is God that
has made it' all : well, but then it came on strangely;
if God has made all these things, he guides and gove
erns them all, and all things that concern them ; for
the Being that could make all things, must certainly
have power to guide and direct them. '
If so, nothing can happen in the great circuit of his .
works, either. without his knowledge or appointment.
And if nothing happenswithout his knn'wledge, he
'knc.W's that Iam here, and am in a dreadful condi'
tion': and if nothing happens without his appointment,
- he has appointed all this to befal me. . " '

. Nothing occurred to mythoughts to contradict any
of these conclusions; and therefore it rested upon me
with the greater force, that it must needs be, that God
had appointed this to befal me ; that I was brought
to this miserable circumstance by his direction, he
having 'the sole power, not of me only, but of every.

"thing that happened in the world. Immediately it
followed. - ~ . '

' .Why has God done this to me ? What have I done
tobethusused? _ 2

My conscience presently checked me in that inqui--
ty, as if I hadl'blasphemed; and methought it spoke to
me like a voice ; " Wretch ! dost thou ask what thou
hast done? look back upon a dreadful mispent life,
and ask thySelf what thou hast not done? ask, why is-
it that thou wert not long ago destroyed? why wert
thou-not drowned in Yarmouth Roads? killed in the
fight when the ship'v'vas' taken by the Sallce man of
war? devoured by thewild beasts on the coast 'of-
Africa ? o'r- drowned here, when all the'crew perished
but thyself? Dost thou ask, What have I done P"

I was struck with~ these reflections as one astonish-
ed, and had not a word to say, no, not to answer to .
myself; but rose up pensive and sad," walked back
to my retreat and went up over'my wall, as if I had
been going to bed; but my thoughts were sadly dis-
turbed, and I had no inclination to sleep; so I sat
down in my chair, and lighted my lamp, for it began
to be dark. Nowas the apprehensions, of the return
of my distemper terrified me very much, it occurred -
to my thought that the Brasilians take no physio but
their tobacco, for almost all distempers; and I had a
piece of a roll'of tobacco in one of the chests, which
' was quite cured, and some also that wasgreen, and
hot quite cured. " ' ' ' '

; I went, directed'by Heaven, _'no doubt; 'for in this

chest I found a cure both for soul and body. I opened
the chest, and found what I looked for, viz. the to.
bacco; and as the, few books I had saved lay there too,
I .took oht one of the Bibles which I mentioned be-
fore, and which, to this time, I had not. found leisure,
or so muchas inclination, to look into; I say I took
it out, and brought both that and the tobacco With me
to the table. . " ' .
\ What use to make of the tobacco I knew not as to
my distemper, "or whether it was good for it or no ;,
. but I tried several experiments with it, as if I was re-
solved it should hit one way orother: I first took- a . '
piece 'of a leaf, and chewed it in my mouth, which -
indeed at first alinost stupified my brain, the tobacco
being green and strong, and that I had, not been much
used to'it; then I took some, and steeped it an hour
or two in some rum, and resolved to take a-' dose of
' it when I lay down; and lastly, l burnt some upon a
pan of coals, and held my nose close over the smoke
of it, as long as I could bear it, asrwell for the heat
as the' virtue of it, and _I held, almost to suffocation;

In the interval of this operation I took up the Bible,
and began to read ; bet my head was too much dis.
turbed 'with the tobacco to bear "reading, .at .least' at

' that time ; only having opened the book casually, the

' fisrt words that'occurred to me were these: " Call on
me in the day of trouble, and Iwill' deliver, and thou
shalt glorify me." .

The words were very apt to my case, and made
some impression upon my thoughts at the time of
reading them,-though not so much as they did after- i
wards ; for as for being delivered, the word had no
sound as I may say, to me; the thing was so remote,
so impossible in my apprehension of things, that I
began tosay; as the children of Israel -did,'when they
wererpromised- flesh to eat, " Ca'n God spread a table
in the wilderness ?" So I began to say, ,Can God him-
self deliver me from this place? And'as it was not ,
for many years that any- hope appeared, thisprevailed
very often upon my thoughts : but, however, the
words made a very'great impression upon me, and I
as LIFE AND ADVENTURES '

mused upon them very often. It grew now late, and
the tobacco had, as I said, dozed my head *so much,

' that I inclined to sleep; so that I left my lamp burn-
ing in the cave, lest I should want any thing in the
night and went to bed ; but before I lay down, I did
what I neyerhad done in all my life; Ilmeeled down,
and prayed to God to fulfil the premise to me, that
.if I called upon .him in the day of trouble, he would
- deliver me. After m'y-broken and imperfect prayer
was'over, I drank' the rum in which I had steeped
. the tobacco, which was so strong and rank of the to-
bacco, that-indeed I could scarce get it down. Imme-
diately upon this I went ,to bed, and I found resend};
it flew up into my head violently; but I. fe 1 into a
sound sleep, and waked no more, till by the sun it
tnust'nec'essarily be near three o'clock in the afternoon
the next day; nay, to this hour I am- partly of the
opinion that I slept all the next day and night, and
till almost three the day after ; for otherwise I knew
not how I should lose a day out of my reckoning in
the 'days of theweek, as, it appeared some years after
I had done; forgif I had lost it, by crossing and re.
crossing the line, I should have 'lost more than a day;
. but in my account-it was lost, and I never knew

which way. t ' .. . -

Be that however one way or other ;,.when I awak-
ed, I found myself , exceedingly refreshed, and my

' spirits lively and cheerful ; when I got up, Ifivas
stronger than I was the day before, and my stomach
better; for I was hungry ; and, in short, I had no fit
the next day, but continued much altered for the bet-

ter: this was the 29th. _ -

The 30th was my well day of course, and I went -

abroad with my gun, but did not care to travel too
far : I killed a - seaufowl or two, something like a
brand goose,.and brought them home, but was not
very forward to eat them -. so I ate' Some more of the
.' .turtle's eggs, which-were very good. This evening I
renewed the medicine which I had supposed 'did me
good the day before, viz. the tobacco steeped in mm ;,0F nosmson causes. 97:-

only I did. not take so much as before, nor did I chew
. any of the leaf, or, hold my head over the smoke;
however, I was no so well the next day, which was-
the 1st of July, as _I hoped I should have been; for I
had a little spice of thepoldfit, but it was not. much.
July 2. I renewedthe medicine all the threeways,
and dozed myself with it at'first, and doubledthe
quantity which I drank.- ' . ' .
Jnly 3.. I missed-the fit for good and all, thou h I
did not recover my full strength for some Weeks a ter.
While I was thus gathering strength, my thoughts ran _
exceedingly upon this scripture, " I will deliverthee;"'
and the impossibility of "my. deliverance lay. much
upon my mind, in" bar of my ever expecting it: but as.
I Was discouraging myself with. such thoughts, it oc-
curred'to my mind, that I pored so much upon my
deliverance from the main affliction, that I disregard-
ed the deliverance I had received; and I was, as it
were, made to ask myself such questions, as these;
viz. Have I not been delivered, and wonderfully too,
from sickness? from the most distressed condition
that could be, and that was so frightful to me? and
what notice had I taken of it?_ had I 'done my part?
__ God had delivered me; butl 'had not glorified him.-
' that is to say,- I had not owned and been thankful for
that as a deliverance; and how could I expect greater
deliverance ? . - ' '
This touched my heart very much, and immedi-
ately I kneeled down, and gave God thanks aloud,
for my recovery from my sickness. , . ' '
.July 4. In the morning I took the Bible; and, be-
ginning at the New Testament, I began seriouslyto
read it; and imposed upon myself to read a while
every morning and'every night, not tying myself to
the number of chapters, but as long as my thoughts
- should engage me. It was not long after I set seri-
ously-to this work, butl found my heart more deeply _
and sincerely affected with'the wickedness of my past -

life; the impression of my dream revived, and the
V011- ,. 7 ' 1' . ~
words, '5 All these things have not brought thee to re-
pentance," ra'n seriously in my thoughts: I was ear;
nestly' begging of God "to give me repentance, 'when it
happened providentially. the very ay, that, reading
the Scripture, I came to these 'words, " He is exalted
a Prince, and a Saviour, to give repentance, and to
give remission," I threw down the book, and with

my heart as well as my hand lifted up'to heaven, in a"

kind of ecstacy of joy, I cried'~out aloud, " Jesus,
thou. Son of- David, Jesus, thou, exalted Prince and
Saviour, give me repentance!" ' '
This was the first time 'thatI cauld say, in the true
sense of the words, that ,I prayed in all my life; for
now I prayed with a sense of my condition, and with
a true Scripture view of hope, founded on the encou-
ragement of the word of God; and from this time, I

may say, I began to have hepe that God would hear me. _

' '- Now I. .began 'to construe the words mentioned,
abotre, "Call on me, and I will deliver thee," in a
different sense 'from what I had ever done before; for
then I had no notion of any thing being called deli .
verance, but my being delivered from the captivity I
was in; for though I was indeed at large in the place,
yet the island was certainly a prison to me, and'that
in the worst sense in the world; but now I learnt to
take it in another sense. 'Now I looked bach'upon
my past life with such horror, and 'my sins appeared
so dreadful, that my soul sought nothing of God, but
deliverance from the load of guilt that boredown all
my conifo'rt. ' As for my solitary life, it was nothing;
I 'did not so much as pray-to be delivered from it, or
think of it; it was all of no consideration in 0mm
parison of this; and I added this part here, to hint to
Whoever shall read it, that whenever they come to a
{true sense of things, theyg will find deliverance from,
sin a 'much greater blessing than deliverance from
, aflliction. '
' But leaving this part, I return to my journal.

"My condition began now to be, though not less
miserable as to my way of living, yet much easier to
' my mind; and my thoughts being directed, by a'con-
Stant reading the Scripture, and praying to God, to
things of a higher- nature, I had 'a great deal of com-
fort within, which till now I knew nothing of: also
as my health and strength returned, I bestirred my-
self to furnish myself with every thing that I wanted,
4 and make my way of living as regular as I could.
From the 4th of July to the 14th, I was chiefly em-
played in walking about with my gun in my hand a
little and a little at a time, as a man that was'gather-
ing up his strength after a fit of sickneSs ; for it is hard-
ly to be imagined how low I was, and to what weak:
ness .1 was reduced. The application Which I made
use of was perfectly new, and ;perha 3 what. had
never cured an ag'ue before; neither can recommend
it.to any one to practise by this experiment; and
though it did carry off the fit, yet it rather contributed
to "weaken me; for I had frequent convulsions in my
nerves and limbs for some time. '
I learnt from it also this in particular, that being
. abroad in the rainy season was the most pernicious
-'thin_'g' to my health that could be, especially in those
---i'ain's' which came attended with storms and hurricanes
'-' of wind ; for as the rain which came in a dry season
. was always most accompanied with such storms, so I
found. this rain wasmuch more dangerous than the
rain Which fell in September and October>> , '

I had been new in this unhappy island above ten'
months; all'possibility of deliverance from 'this con-'
dition' seemed to be entirely taken from me ; . and I
firmly believed that no human .shape had ever set
foot-upon that place. Having now secured my habi-
ration, as I thought, fully to my mind, I had a great
desire to make a more perfect discovery of the island,
and to see what other productions I might find, which
yet I knew nothing of. ' - - ' -

' It was the-15th of July that I began to take a more '
particular survey of the island itself. I went up the
creek first, where, as I hinted, I brought my rafts on
' shore. I found, after I cameahout two miles up, that

'
the tide, did not flow any higher, and that it Was :10.
mOre than a little brook of running water, and very
fresh and good: butthis being the dry seasOn, there
was hardly any water. in some parts 'of it, at least not
enough to run into any stream, so as it could be
perceived. ' . _' - ' -'
0n the bank of this brook I found many pleasant
savannas or meadows, plain, smooth, and covered with
grass; and on the rising parts: of' them next to the
higher grounds, where the water, as it might be sup.
posed, 'never overflowed, I found a great deal of to- .
. . bacco, green, and growing to a great and very strong
stalk; there were divers other plants which I had no
- notion of, or understanding about; and might erhaps
have virtues of their own, which I could not nd out.
I searched for the cassave root, which the Indians
in all that climate make their bread of, but'I could
find .n'one.. I saw large "plants of aloes, but did not
then understand them: I saw several sugar-canes, but
wild, and, for want of cultivation, imperfect ' I con-
tented" myself with these discoveries for this time, and
came back, musing with myself what course I might
take to know the virtue and goodness of any of the
fruitsor plants which I should discover, b'utcould bring
it to no conclusion {for in short, I had made solittle
observation while I was in the Brasils, that I knew
little of the plants of the field, at least very little that
might serve me to any purpose now in my distress.
. he next. day, the 16th, I went up the same way
_ again; and, after going something farther than I had
done, the day before, I found the brook and the sac
vannas began to cease, and the country became- more
. wOody than before. In this part I found different -
'fruits, and particularlyl found melons upon the ground
in great abundance, and grapes upon the trees; the
vines had spread indeed over the trees, and the clus-
ters of grapes were justnow in their prime, very ripe
and rich. This was a surprising discovery, and l' was
exceeding glad of them; but I was warned by my ex-
perience to eat Sparingly of them, remembering, thatwhen I was ashore in Barbary, the eating of grapes
killed several of our Englishmen who were slaves
there, by throwinglthem into fluxes and fevers: but I
. leund an excellent use for these grapes, and that was
to cure or dry them in the's'un, and keep them as dried
grapes or raisins are kept, which I thought would be,
as indeedthey- were, as wholesome, and as agreeable
to eat when no grapes might be had. .

'Ifipent all that evening there, and went not back to
my habitation, which by the way was the first night,
as I might say, I had lain from home. In the night I
took my first contrivanCe, and got up into a tree,
where I sle t well, and the next morning proceeded
upon my , iscovery, travelling near four miles, as I
might judge by thetlength of the valley, keeping still
due north, with a ridge of hills on the south and north
sideofme. . ' ' . -

At the'end of this march I came to an opening,
where the country seemed to, descend to the west; and
a little spring of fresh water, which issued Out of the
side,of the hill by me, ran the other way, that is, due
east; and the country appeared so fresh, so green, so
flourishing, every thing being in a constant verdure or
flourish of spring, that it looked like a planted garden.

I descended a little on the side of that delicious val-
ley, surveying it with a secret kind of pleasure (though
mixed with other afflicting thoughts) to think that this
was all'my own, that I 'was king and lord of all this
country indefeasibly, and had a right of possession;
- and if I could convey it, I mighthave it in inheritance,
as completely as any lord of a. manor in England. 1
saw here abundance of cocoa-trees, orange andlemon';
and citron-trees, but all wild, and few' bearing any
fruit; at least, not then: however the green limes that-
I gathered were not only pleasant to eat, but very
wholesome; and 1 mixed their juice afterwards with
water, which'made it very wholesome, and very cool
and refreshing.

I found new I bad business enough to gather and

carry home ; and resolved to lay up a store, as well a!

/
grapes as limes and lemons, to furnish myself for the
wet season, which I knew was approaching.

In order to do this I gathered a great heap of grapes
in'one place, and a lesser heap in another place, and
a great parcel of limes and lemons in another place; .
,and taking a few of 'each with me, I travelled home- '
'ward, and resolved to come'again, and bring a bag 0
sack, or whatI could make, to carry the rest home.

Accordingly, having spent three days in this jour
ney', I came-home (so I must nov'v-eall my ltent',"and
my cave ;) but before Ilgot thither, the grapes were
spoiled; the richness of the fruit, and. the weight of
the juice, having broken them, and bruised them, they
were good for little or nothing :' as-to the limes, they
were good, but I ebuld bring but a few. - .

The next day, being the 19th, I went back, :having
made me two small bags to bring home my harvest.

- ButI was surprised ' when coming to my heap, of

grapes, which Were so rich and fine when I gathered
them, I found them all spread abroad, trod to pieces,
and dragged about, some here, some there, and abun-
dance eaten anddevoured. By this Iconcluded there
were some wild creatures thereabouts, which had
done-this ; but what they were I knew not. .

However; as I found there was. no laying them'up
on heaps, and no- carrying them away in a sack, but
that one way they would be destroyed, and the other
way they-would be crushed with their own Weight, I
took another course; for I gathered a large quantity.
of the grapes, and hung them upon the out branches,
of the trees, that they might cure and dry in the sun;
and as for the limes and lemons, I carried as many
back as I could well stand under. ' ' . --
' _VVhen I came home from this journey, I contem-
plated with great pleasure on the fruitfuluess of that
valley, and the pleasantness of the situation, the secu- '
rity, from storms on that side of the water, and the
- wood ;' and concluded that'I had pitched upon a place
to fix my abode, which was by far the worst part of

V

.the country. [pen the whole, I began to consider >>
of remoirmg my habitation, and to look out for a
place equally safe as where I now was situated, if
possible, in that pleasant fruitful part of the island.
This thought ran long in my head, and I was ex-
ceeding fond of it for some time, the pleasantness of
the place tempting me: but when I came to a nearer-
view of it, and to consider that I was now by the sea
side, where it was at least possible that something
might happen tony advantage", and that the same ill
fate that brought me hither, might bring some other
unhappy wretches to the same place ; and though it
was scarce probable that any such thing should ever
happen, yet to enclose myself among the 'hills and
woods, in the centre of the island was to anticipate
my bondage, and tovrender such an affair not only
improbable, but impossible ; and ~ that therefore I
ought not by any means to remove. -
Hewever, I was so enamoured with this place, that
I Spent much of my time there for the whole remain-
ingpart of the month of July; and though, upon se-
cond thoughts, I resolved as 'above, not to remove,
yet I built me a little kind of a bower, and surround-
ed it ata distance with a strong fence, being a double
hedge, as high as Ic'ould reach, well staked and filled
. between with brushwood; and here I lay very secure, -
sometimes two or three nights together, always going
over it with a ladder, as before ; so that I fancied now'
I had my country house, and my sea-coast house :
and this work took me up the beginning of A ugust.
I'had but newly finished my fence, and began to
enjoy my labour, but the rains came on, and made
me stick close to my first habitation: for though I had
made me a tent like the other, with a piece of a sail,
and spread it very well, yet I had not the shelter of
an hill to keep me from storms; nor a cave behind me
. to retreat intowhen the rains were extraordinary.
About the beginning of August, as I said, I- had
finishedgmy bower and began to enjoy myself. (Dire
3d of AugustI found the grapes I had hung up were
perfectly dried, and indeed were excellent good raisins
of the sun; so I. began to talge them-adown from the

. trees, audit was very'happy' that I did fee; for the

rains which followed would have 'spOiled'them, and I -
had lost the best part of'my winter food ; for I had

above two'hundred large bunches of them. No sooner

"had I taken them all down, and carried 'most Of them
home; to my cave, but it began to ram '; and from

7 . thence, which! was the 14th of August, it rained more

orles's every day, till the-middle of OCther;"and'
sometimes so violently, that I could not" stir out 0-
my cave 'for several. days. .
"In this season I was much surprised with the in-
~ crease ofniy family : Ihad been concerned for the
loss of one of my cats, who ran away' from. me, or,
as I thought, had been dead; and I'heai-d no more
tale or tidings of her. till to my astonishment she came
home about the end of August, with three kittens.
This was the more strange to me, because though I
had killed a' wild cat as I called it, with my gun, yet
I thought it was'a quite different kind from our Euro;
pean cats; yet the young cats were the same kind of
house breed like the old one; 'and both my cats being
females, I thought it very strange : but from these!-
three cats I afterwards came to be so estered with-
cats, thatI was forced td-'killthem li _ e vermin, 'or
wild ham, and to drive them from my house as much
as possible. - , , a - .
From the 14th of August to the 26th,- incessant rain,
so that I could not stir, and 'was now very careful not '
to be much wet. In this confinement I began to be .
, straitened for food ; but venturing out twice, I one
day killed a goat :- and the last day, which was the
_ 26th, found a very large tortise which was a treat to_
me, and my food'was regulated thus : I ate a bunch
of raisins for my breakfast, a piece of the goat's flesh,
or of the turtje, for my dinner, broiled (for, to my
great misfortune, I had no vessel to' boil or stew any
thing ;) and two or threelof the turtle's'eg'gs for supper.
.Durinv this confinement-in my'cove'r by- the rain:
I worked daily two or three hours at enlarging my .' cave; and, by degrees, worked it. on towards one"
side, till I came to the outside of the hill, and made
a door or way out, which' came, beyond my fence or'
trail; and. so I came in and out this way: but I was
not perfectly easy at lying so Open; for as I had' ' '
managed myself before," Llwas in a perfect enclosure;
whereas. now I thoughtI lay exposed; and yet I
could not perceive that there was any living thing to'
fear, 'the biggest creature that I had seen upon th

island being a goat. '

September the 30th. -- _I was now come to the"
unhappy>> anniversary of my landing: I cast up the
notches on my pdst, and found I had. been on shore
three hundred and sixty-five days. 'I kept this day
as a solemn fast, setting it apart to a religious exer-
cise, pro'strating' myself . to the ground withthe most
serious humiliation, confessing myself to God ac>>
'knowledging' his righteous judgment upon me, and
praying to him to have mercy on me, through J esns=
Christ; and having not tested the least refreshment
for twelve hours, even till the going down of the sun;
I thenate a biscuit-cake and a-bunch of grapes, and
wentto bed, finishing the day as I began it. _-

I had all thistime observed nosabbath-day; for as
at firStI had no sense of religion=upon my mind, I had
after some time omitted to distinguish the weeks, by
making a longer notch than ordinary for the sabbath'
day, and so did not really know what any of the days
iv'ere; but now, having cast up the days as before, l~
found I had been there a year; so I divided it into
weeks, and set apart every seventh day'for a sabbath;
though I found atthe end of my account I had lost
.a day or- two'of my reckoning. ~ '

A. little after this my ink began to fail me and so I
contented myself to use it more sparingly, and to
write. down only the most remarkable events of my
life, without continuing a daily memorandum of
other.things,' . . . - ~. - _ p

1 The rain yrseason, and tIhe'2dryseason, began nowsa.
J .' ' " . I '
appear regular to me, and I learnt to divide them'so
as to provide for them accordingly.- But I bought all
my experience before I had it; and this I am going to
relate, was one of the most discouraging experiments
that I made at all; I have mentioned, that I'had saved
the few ears of barley and rice which I had so sur- .
pri'singly found spring up, as I thought, of themselves,
and believe there were about thirty stalks of rice, and '
about twenty of barley: and now I thought it a pro-
per time to sow it after the rains, the sun being in its
southern position going from me.

Accordingly I dug up a piece 'of ground, as well as
I could, with my wooden spade, and dividing it into
tWo parts,-I sowed my grain; but as I was sowing, it
. casually occurred to my thought, that I would not
sow it. all at first, because I did not know When was
the proper time forlit; so I sowed about two thirds of
the seeds, leaving about a. handful" of each. '
' .It was a great comfort to me afterwards that I did
so, for not one grain of that I sowed this time came
to any thing; for the dry months following, the-earth
having had- no rain after the seed was sown, it had
no moisture to assist its growth, and never came up
' 'at all, till the wet season had'come again, and then
it grew as if it had been newly sown. - f

' Finding mylfirst seed did not grow, which I easily

imagined was by'the drought, I sought for a moister
piece of ground to make another trial in ; and-I dug
up a piece of ground near my new bower, and sowed
the rest of my seed in February, a little before the
vernal equinox; and this, having the rainy months
of March and April to water it, sprung up very plea-
sently, and ,yielded a very' good crop; but having
part of the seed left only, and not daring to sow all
that I had yet, I had but a small quantity at last, my
whole crop not amounting to above half a peek- of
each kind. ' * >> .

But by thisexperience I was made master of mg:
business, and knew exactly when the prayer season
was to sow; and that I might expect two seed-times;
and two harvests, every year. - , .

' -While this corn was growing, I madealittle disco-
very," which Was of use to me afterwards. As soon
as the' rains Were over, and the Weather began to set--
tie, which was about" the month of "November, I.
made a visit up the country to my. bower, where
though I had not been some months, yet I found all

hings just as I left them. The circle or double
hedge that I had made, was 1101; only firm and entire, -
but the stakes which I had cut ofi'gof some trees that

- grei'v thereabouts, were all shot out, and grown with
long branches, as much as a. willow tree uSuale'
shoots the firshyear after lapping its head. I could
not tell what tree, to call it that these stakes were'cut
from. I was surprised, and yet very well pleased, to
see the young trees grow; and I prunedthem, and
led them up to grow as much alike as I could; .and
it is scarce credible, how beautiful a figure they grew

into in three years; so that though the hedge made a
circle of about twenty-five yards in diameter, yet the
trees, for such I might now-call them, soon covered
it; and it was a complete shade, sufficient to lodge
under all the dry season. .

This made me resolveto cut' some more stakes,
and make me an hedge like this in a semicircle round
my wall, I mean that'of my first dwelling, which I
did; and placing the trees or stakes in a double row, .
at about eight yards distance from my first fence, they

grew presently, and were at first a fine cover to my
habitation, and afterwards served for a defence also,
as I shall observe in its order. . . ..

I found now, that the seasons of the year might .
generally be divided, not into sumnier and winter,.as :
in Europe, but into the rainy seasons and the dry
seasons, which were generally thus: . << ' .

Half February,

The rainy season sometimesheld longei or shorter,
as the winds happened to blow; but this was the geo
neral observation I made. After I had found, by
experience, the ill consequence of being abroad in the
rain, I took care to furnish myself with provision be-
fore-hand, that I niight not be obliged to go out; and
I sat within doots' as much as possible during the wet
months; - a . . '

In this time I found. much'employment, (and very
suitable also to'the time) for. I- fonnd great oceasion
of many things which I had no way to furnish myself
with, but by hard '-labour and- constant application;
particularly, I tried. many ways to make myselfa
basket; but all the twigs I could get for the pUrpOSe
proved so brittle, that they would do nothing. It
proved ofiaxcellent advantage to me now, that when
1 was a boy I used to take great delightin standing at
a basket maker's in the townwhere my father lived,
to see them make their wicker-ware; and being, as
boys usually are, very officious to help,'and .8" great
"observer of <<the manner how they worked those things,
and sometimes lent an hand, khad by this means so
full knowledge of the methods of it, . that I wanted
" nothing but the materials; - when 'it came into'my

mind, that the twigs of that tree from whence I cut, 1
' my stakes, that grew, might possiblyhe' as tough as the |
swallows,.and willows, and osiers, in England; and
I resolved to try. . ._ _ .

Accordingly the next day I wentto my country-

house, as I called it, and cutting 'some of the smaller
twigs, I found them tofmy purpose as much as I could
desire; whereupon I came the next time pre lared
with an hatchet to cut down a. quantity, which soon
.found, for there- was a great plenty of - them : these I
set up to dry within "my circle or; hedges; and when
they were fit for use, I carried .them to my cave; and>>
here. during the next season I employed myself in
making (as well as I could) a great-many. baskets,
both to carry earth, or to carry or lay up any thing,
as I had occasion; and though I did not finish them
very handsomely, yet I made them sufficiently service-
able for my purpose; and thusafterwards I took care .
never to be without them; and as my wicker-ware -,
decayed Imade more; especially I made strong eep-
baskets to place my corn in, instead'of sacks, when I
should come to have any quantity of it.~

Having mastered this difliculty, and employed a
world 'of time about it, I bestirred myself to see, if
possible, how to supply two wants. . I had no Vessels
to hold any thing that ivas liquid, ex'cept two runlets,
which were ahndstfull cf rum,.and some glass bot.-
tles, some of the 'common size, and others which
were case--bottles square, fort-he holding of waters,
Spirits, doc. I had not so much as a pot to boil any
thing in, eXcept a great kettle which I saved out of
the ship, and which was too big for such uses as I
desired-it for, viz. to make broth, and stew a bit of
meat by itself. The second thing I would fain have
had, was a tobacco-pipe, but it Was impossible for
me to make one; however, I found a contrivancef
for that too at last. ' - '

I employed myself in planting my second rows of
stakes or piles, and in this wicker-work, all the sum -
mer, or dry season; when anotherbusiness took me
up more time than it could be imagined I could spare.
. I mentioned before, that I had a great mind to
see the whole island, 'and'that I had travelled up the
brook, and so on to .where _I built 'my "bower, and
where I had an Opening quite to the sea, on the other
side of the island. I now resolved to travel quite
acrossto the sea-shore on that side. So taking my
gun and hatchet, and my dog, and a larger quantity
of powder and shot than usual, with twobiscuit-cakes
and a great bunch of raisins in my pouch, for. my
store, I began my journey. When I had passed the
vale where my bower stood, as above, I came within
view of the sea, to the west; and it being a very clear
day, I fairly descried land, whether an island or con-
tinent I could not tell; but it lay very high, extend-
ing from "the west to the W. S. W. at a very great
distance ; by' my guess it could not be less than fifteen
or twenty leagues off. - ~ ,
I could not tell whatpart of the world this might
be, otherwise than that I knew it must be part of Ame-
rica; and, as I concluded by all my observations,
must be . near the Spanish dominions, and perhaps
was all inhabited by savages, where if Ishould have
landed, I had been in a worse condition. than I was
now; and therefore I-acQuiesced in the dispositions
of Providence, which I began ' now to own, and to
believe ordered every thing- for the best; I say, I qui-
eted my mind with this, and left afflicting myself
with fruitless wishes of _ being there. ' '
' , Besides, after some pause upon this afl'air, I consi-
dered, that if this land was the Spanish coast, I should
certainly, one time or other, see some'vessels pass or
repass one way or other; but if not, then it '_was the
_ savage cost. between the Spanish country and Brasil,
which. were indeed the worst of sa'vages; for they are
cannibals, or men-eaters, and fail not to murder and
devour all the human bodies that'fall into their hands.
With these considerations I walked very leisurely
forward. I found that side of the island where I now
was, much pleasanter than'mine, the open or savanna
fields sweet, adorned with flowers and grass, and full
of very fine Woods. I saw abundance of parrots, and
fain "would I_ have'caught one, if possible, to have
kept it .to_ be tame, and taught it to speak to me. I
did, after somepains-taking, catch a yOung parrot;
for I knocked it down with a stick, and having reco-
vered it, I brought it home,, but it was 'some years
before. I could make him speak. However, at last I
taught him to call .me by my name very familiarly:
but the accident that'followed, thoughitbe a trifle
will be very diverting in its place. ~- '

I .was exceedingly diverted with this journey: I
found in the low grounds, hares, as I thought them to
,be, and foxes, but they difi'ered greatly from all the
other kinds I had met with ;. nor could I satisfy my-
self to eat them, though [killed several: but I had no
need to be venturouS; for I had no want of food, and-
of that which was very good too; especially these
three sorts, viz. goats, pigeons,.and turtle or ~tortorse;
whichadded to my'grapes, Leadenhall-market could'
not have. furnished a better' table than I, in propor--
tion to the company: and :though my case was de-
plorable enough, yet I had a great cause for thankful-
ness, that I was not driven. to any extremities for
food; but rather plenty, even to dainties.

I never travelled in this journey above two miles
outright in a day, orthereabouts ; 'but I took so many
turns and returns, to see what discoveries I could
make, thatI came weary enough to the place where I
resolved to sit down for all night; and then either '
'reposed myself in a tree, or surrounded 'myself with
a row of stakes set upright in the ground, either .from
one tree to another, or so as no wild creature Could
come at me without waking me. '

As soon as I came to the sea-shore, I was surprised
to seeth'at I hadt-akenup'my lot on the worst side
of the island; for here indeed the shore was covered
with innumerable turtles, whereas on the other side
I had found but three in a year and an half. Here
was also an infinite number of fowls of many kinds,

some of which I had not seen before, and many 'of
them very good meat; but such as I knew not the
flames of except those called pengiuns; J _ .

I could have shot as. many as'I pleased, but was
very-sparing of my powder and shot: and therefore
had'more mind to kill a she-goat, if I could, which I
mould better feed on: and though there were many
goats here more than on the other side of the island,
yet itI-was with much more difiiculty that I could
Icome near them {the country being flat and even,
.and they saw memuch sooner than when I was on
(the hills. , \ ' -

I confess this side of the country was much plea-
santer than mine, but yet I had not the least'inclina-
aim to remove; for as I was fixed in my habitation,
- it became natural to me, and I seemed all the while I
was here to be, as it were upon a journey, and from
home: however, I travelled along the shore of the sea
towards the east", Iisuppose, about twelve miles; and
then setting up a grea'apole upon the shorefor a mark,
I concluded Izwould go home again; and the next jour-
tney I took should be on the other side of the island,
east from my dwelling, and so round, till I came to
my post again : of which in its place . , . . . .

I' took another wayto come back than that I went,
thinking I could easily keep all the island somuch in
my view, that I could not miss finding my first dwell-
ing by viewing the country; but I found myself mis-
taken; for :being come about two or three miles, I
found myself descended into a very large valley; but
so surrounded with hills, and those bills covered with '
wwoods, that I could not see Which was my Way by
:any direction but that of the sun; nor even then,
unless I knew very well the position .of the sun at
' hat-time of the day. - f ,.

It happened, to my farther misfortune, that the
weather proved hazy for three or four days, while I
was in-this valley; and not 'beingable to see the sun,

l-wandered aboutvery uncomfortably, and at last was ~
.abliged to find out the sea-side, look 'for my post. and
come back the same way I Went; and then by easy
journies Irturned :homeward, the-weather being ex-
ceeding hdt ;'and my gun, ammunition, hatchet, and"
other things, very heavy. '

In this journey my dog surprised a young kid, and
seized .upon it; and 1- running in to take hold of it,
caugh 'it and saved it alive from the dog". I had a
great mind to bring it home, if . I could; fer I had
often been musing whether it might not be possible to
get a kid or two, and so raise a breed of tame goats,
which might supply me when my powder and shot~
should be spent. - .. ' ~ ' ' -

I" made a collar for this little creature, and with a
string which I made of some rope-yarn, which I
always carried ,about me, I led him along,- though
with some difficulty, till I came to my bower, and
there I enclosed him, and left him; for I was very
impatient" to be at home, from whence I had been
absent abovea month. . -'

I' cannot express what'a satisfactionit was-to me
- to come into myold hutch, and lie down in my ham-
mock-bed: .this little wandering journey, without a
settled place of abode, had been so unpleasant to me,
that my ,own house, as I called it to myself, was a
perfect settlement to me, compared to that; and it
rendered eVe/ry thing about me so comfortable, thatI
resolved I would never go a great way from it again,
while it should be. my lot to stay on the island. .

I re osed myself herea week, to rest and regale
myselfP after my long journey; during which, most
(if-the time was taken up in the weighty affair of
making a cage for my Pol, who began now to be a
mere domestic, and to be mighty well acquainted with
me. Then I began to think of the poor kid, which I
had pent in within my little circle, and resolved to go
and feteh it'home, and give it some food; accordingly
I went. and found it where I left it; for indeed it
could not get out, but was almost starved for want of
food; I went-and cut boughs of trees and branches of
.such shrubs as I could find, and threw it over, 'andhaving fed-it, I tied it as I did before to lead it away;
but it was so tame' with being hungry,' that I had no
need to have tied it; for it followed'me like a dog ,
and .as I Continually fed it, the creature became so
loving, so gentle, and so fond, that it became from
that time one of my domestics also, and would never
leave me afterwards , ' '. .
The rainy season of . the autumnal equinox was now
come, and I kept the 30th of September in the sauna.
solemn. manner as before, being the anniversary (I
my landing on the island, having'now been there two.
years, and no more prospect of being. delivered than
the first day I came there. I spent the whole day in
humble and thankful acknowledgements of the many
wonderful mercies which my solitary Condition was
attended with, and without which it might have been
infinitely more miserable. I gave humble and hearty
thanks, that God had been pleased to discover to me
even that it was possible I might be more happy in
this solitary condition than I should have been in a
liberty of society, and in allthe pleasures of the world:
that he could fully make up to me the deficiencies of
my solitry state, and the want of human society, ' by
his presence, and the communication of his grace to
my soul, supporting, comforting, and encouraging me
to depend upon his providence here, and hope for
his eternal presence hereafter. '
It was now that I began sensibly to feel how much
more happy the lifeI now led was, with all its miser-
able circumstances, than the wicked, cursed, abomina-
ble life I led all the past part of my days; and now,
having changed both my sorrows and my joys, my
very desires altered, my affections changed their gust,
and my delights were perfectly new from what they
were at'first coming, or indeed for two years past.
Before as I walked about, either on my hunting,
' or for viewing>> the country, the anguish of my soul at
my condition would break out upon me on a sudden,
.and my very heart would die Within me, to think of
the woods, the mountains, the deserts I was in; and
how I was a prisoner, locked up with the eternal bars
and bolts of the ocean, in an uninhabited wilderness,
without redemption. Iln the midst of the greatest
composures of my mind, this wbuld break out upon
me like a storm, and made me: ring my hands, and
weep like a child. Sometimes it would take me in
the middle of my work", and I would immediately sit
down and sigh, and look upon the ground for an hour
or twotogether, and-this was still worse to' me; for if -
I could burst out into tears, or'vent mySelf by words,
it would 'go off; and the grief, having exhausted
'.itself, would abate.~ _ ' . .
' But now I began to exercise myself with new
. thoughts; I daily read the word of God, and applied
all the coniferts (if it to my present state. One morn-
ing being Very sad, I opened the Bible upon these
words; " I will never, never leave thee, nor forsake
thee 1." Immediately it occurred, that "these words
were to me, why else should they be directed in such
a manner, just at the moment when I was mourning
over my condition, as one forsaken of God and man?
"Well then," said I, " if ,God does not forsake me,
of what ill consequence can it be, or what matters it,
though 'the- world should all forsake me; seeing, on
the other-hand, if I had all the world, and should lose
the favour and blessing of God, there would he no
coinparison in the loss?" ,
From this moment I began to conclude in my
mind, that it was possible-for me to be more happy
in this forsaken, solitary condition, than it was proba-
ble I should have ever been in any .other particular
state in the world; and with this thought I was going
to give thanks to God for bringing me to this place.
lknow not what it was, but something shocked my
mind at that thought, andl durst not speak the words,
" How canst thou'be such an hypocrite," said-I, even
audibly, "to pretend to bethankful for a condition,
which, however thou maystendeavour to be contented
with, then wouldest rather pray heartin to be deliver-
ed from?" So i stopped there; but though I couldits ,' ' LIFE AND Anvnrv'runns

not say! thanked'God for being there, yet I sincerely
. gave thanks ~to'God for opening my eyes, by what.
ever afiiicting 'providences, to, see the former condition
of my life, and, to mourn for my wickedness, and re.-
pent. I never' Opened the Bible, or shut it, but, my
very soul" within me blessed God for directing my
friend in England, without any order of mine, to pack
it up among my goods; and for assisting me after.
wards to save it out of the wreck- of the 'ship. '
' Thus, and. in this disposition of mind, I began my
third year; and though I have not given the reader
~ the trouble of so particular-an account of my works
this year as at the first, yet in general it may be ob-
serVed, that I was very seldom idle; having regularly -
divided my time, according to the several daily em.
plbyments that were before me; such as, first, my
duty to God, and reading the scriptures, which I con-
stantly set apart some time for, thrice every day:
secondly, the going abroad with my gun for food,
which generally took me' up, three hours every morn-
ing when .it didnot rain; thirdly, the ordering, cur;
. ing, preserving, and cooking what I 'had killed or
catched for; my supply; these took up great part of
the day: also it is to be considered, that in the middle
of the day, when the sun was in the zenith, the vio-
lence of the heat' was too great to stir'out; so that
about four hours in the evening was all. the time I'
could "be supposed to work in; with this exception,
that sometimes [changed my' hours of hunting and
working, and went to work in the morning, and
abroad with my. gun in the afternoon. ,
To this short time allowed for labour, I desire may
.be-added the exceeding'laboriousness of my work;
the many hours, which for. want of tools, want of
help, and want of skill, every thing that I did, took
up out of my time: for example, I was full two-and-
forty days making me a board for a long-shelf, which
I wanted in "my cave; whereas two sawyers, with
their tools and saw-pit, would have cut six" of them
out 'of the same tree in a half a day. ' -
My case was this: it was to bp'a large tree which
was to be cut down, because my'board was to be a,
broad one. The tree [was three days acuttin gdown,
and two ,more cutting off the boughs, andreducing it
to a log, or piece of timber.' With . inexpressible
hacking andA'hewing I reduced both the sides of it
into chips, till it began to be light enough to move;
then I turned it, and made one side of it smooth and

' flat, as aboard, from end to end : then turning that
side downward, cut the other side ' till I. brought the
plank to be about three inches thick, and smooth ',on.
both sides. .Any- one may judge the labOur of my
hands in such a piece of work '; but labour and pa-
tience carried me through that and manyother things ;
1 only observe this in particular, to show the reason
why so much of my time went away with so little
work, viz. that what might be a little to be done with
help and toOls, was a vast labour, and required a pro. .

deg.digioustime to do alone, and by hand.

But notwithstandingthis, with patience and labour,

. I went throughmany thingsgand indeed every thing
that my circumstances made; necessary for me 'to-do,
as will appear by what follows. '

- I was new in the months of November and De.
camber, expecting my crap of barley and rice. The
ground! had manured or dug up for them was not
great; for, as; I observed, my seed of each was not
above the quantity of half a peck : for I had lost one
whole cr0p by sowing in the dry season ; but now
my crop promised very well, when on a sudden I
found I was in danger of losing it all again by ene-
mies of severalsorts, Which it was scarce possibleto
keep from it ; as first the goats and wild creatures

._ which I called hares, which, tasting the sweetness of
the blade, lay in it night and day as soon as it came.
up,-and ate it so close,.that it could 'get no time to
shoot up into stalks. '

This I'saw no remedy for, but by making an enclo-
ure about it with a hedge, which I did with a- great
,deal of toil; and the more, because it requireda great
deal of ,speed ; the creatures daily spoiling mycorn.
However, as my, arable land was but small, suited to
my crop, lgot it "totally well fenced in about .three
' weeks time, and "shooting some of the creatures in the
day-time, I set my dogto--guard it in the night, tying
him up to a stake at the gate, where he would stand
and bark all night long ; so in a little time-the ene-
_mies forsook the place and the corn grew very strong
and well, and began to ripen apace . . . ._
But as the beasts ruined me before, while my corn
was in the blade, so thebirds were as likely to ruin
me now, when it was in the ear ; .for going along by
the place to see how it thro've, I saw my little crOp
surrounded with fowls of I know not how many sorts,
. which stood as it were watching till I should be gone.
I immediately let fly among them (for I alWays had
'my gun withme.) I had no sooner shot, but there
arose up. a little cloud of fowlskwhich I had net seen
at all, frOm among the corn itself. .' .. ' '
This touched me sensibly; for I foresaw, that in a '
few day they would devOur all my hopes ;' that I
should be starved, and never be able to raise a crop at
all : and what to do I' could not tell ; however, [I
resolved not to loose my corn, if possible, though 'I
= should watch it night and day. In the first place, .I
went among it to see what damage was already done,
and found they had. spoiled a good deal of it; but
that, as it wasryet too green fer them, the loss was
not, so great, but the, remainder was like to be a good
crcip, if it could be saved. ' '
' , stayed by it -to load my gun, and then coming
away, 'I could easily see the thieves sitting upon all
the-trees about me, as if they only waited till I was.
' gone away, and the event it proved to be so ; for asI
walked ofi' as if Iwas gone, I was no sooner out of
their sight, but they dropped dotvn one by one into
the corn again. I was so provoked, that I could not
have patience to stay till more cameon, knowing that
every grain that they. now ate was, as it might be said.
a peck loaf tome in the consequence; but coming. or Roamshficauson. ' . 1219

-to the' hedge, I fired again, and killed three of them.
This was what I looked for ; so I took them _up, and
served them as we serve notorious. thieves in Engg
land, viz. hanged them in chains for a. terror to others. .
It is impossibleto imagine almost, that this should '
have such an efi'ect as it had ; for the fowls. would
not only not come at the corn, but in short they for- -
such all that art of the island, and I could never see
ahbird near 6 place as long as my scarecrows hung
t ere.. ' . . .
This I was very glad of, you may be sure; and
about the latter end of December, which was. our
s'eCo'nd harvest of the year, I reaped my corn:
,{'I was sadly ut to it for a scythe or a sc1ckle to
cut it down, and, all I could do was to' make one as
well as I could out of one of the broad-swords, or
cutla'sses which I saved among the arms out of the
ship. However, as my amp was but small, I had no
great difficult to cut it down: in short I reaped it
my way, for IV cut nothing off but the ears, and. car-
ried it away in a great basket which I had made, and
so rubbed it out with my hands : and at the end 'of all '
my harvesting I found, that out of my half-peck of "
seed I had near two bushels of rice, and above two,
bushels and a half of barley, that is to say, by my
guess, for I had no measure at that time. _-
However, this was a great encouragement to me ;
and Iforesaw, that in time it would please God to ,
supply me with bread: and yet here I was perplexed
again ; far I neither knew how t0grind or make meal
~ of my cornfior indeed how to clean it and part it;
nor, if made into meal, how to make bread, of it ,;
and if how to make it, yet I knew not haw to bake
it. These things being added to thy-desire of having
a good 'quantity for store, and to secure a constant
supply, I resolved not to taste any of this crap, but
to preserve it all for seed against the next season, and
7 m the mean time to' employ all my study and hours
of working to accomplish this great work ofprovidhg
myself with com and bread. - , , A
>> It might be truly said, that. [now worked for my
bread. It is alittle wonderful, and what I belieVe
few people'ha've .thOughtmuch upon; viz, the strange
multitude of little'thiu'gsnecessaryinithe providing.
producing, curing, dressing, making, and finishing
this one article of bread. ' . ' '

I, .that was reduced to aimere state of nature, found
this to be my daily discouragement, and was made
more and more sensible of it every hour, even after
I got the first handful of seed corn, which, asI have
said, came up unexpectedly, and indeed to a surprise.
. First, I had no plough to turn the earth, no spade.
or shovel to dig it. Well, this I conquered by mak-
ing a wooden spade, as I observed before ; but this

'did my work but me. wooden manner; and though

it coSt me agreat many days tor'nak'e it, yet, .for'. want

'of iron, it not only wore" out the sooner, buti'made

my. work the harder, and made it be performed much

However, this I bore with too, and was cOntentto
work it out with patience, and bear with the badness
0f the;performance. When the corn was sowed, l

' had no barrow, but was forced to go over 'it myself,
and drag a great heav'y bough of a tree over it, to

scratch the earth, as it may be called, rather than rake
or barrow it. ' . ..

When it was growing'or-grown, I have "observed
already how many things I wanted, to fence it, secure
it, mow or map it, cure or carry it home, thr'eSh',
part it from the chaff, and save it. Then I wanted a
mill to grind, sieves to dress it, yeast. and Salt to

j make it into bread, and an oven to bake it in ; and all

these things I did without, as shall be obsen'ed ; and

' 'yet- the corn was an inestimable comfort and adren-

tage to me too ; but all this, as I said, made every.
thing laborious and tedious to me, but that there was
no help for; neither was my time so much less to nie,

because-I had divided it; a certain art of itwas

.jevery day appointed to these works; an 3131 resolved

to use none of the corn for bread till I had a greater

\
quantity by 'me, I had the neat. six months to apply '
myself wholly by labour and invention, to furnish
myself with utensils proper for the performing all the

operations necessary for the making the corn, when I
had it, fit for my use.

- 'But first I was to prepare more land, for I had now
seed enough to sow above an acre of ground. Before
Idid this, I had a week's work at least to make meat
~ pade, which, when it was dOne, wasa very sorry one

ndeed, and very heavy, and required double labour

. to' work with it; however, I went through that, and
'sowed my seeds in two large flat pieces of ground, as
near my house as I could find them to my mind, and
fenced them in_With a good hedge, the stakes of which
were all cut off that wood which I had set before,
which I knew would grow"; so that in one year's time
I knew I should have a quick or living hedge, that
would want'but little repair. This work was not
so little as to take me up less than three months; bee
cause great part of that time was in the 1Wet season,

when I could not go abroad. ' ; .

' iVithin-door, that is, when it raised, and I could
not go out," I found employment on the following oc-
casion, always observing, that all the'xwhile I was
at work, I diverted myself with talking to my parrot,
and teaching him to speak; and I quickly learnt him
to know his own name; at last, to speak it out pretty
loud, Pol; which was the first word I ever heard
'spoken in the island by any month but'my own. This
therefore was not my work, but an assistant to my
work; for new, as I said, I had a great employment
upon my hands, as follows-2'" viz. I had long studied,
by some means or other, to make myself some earthen

'vessels, which indeed I wanted sorely, but knew nct
where to come at them: however, considering the.
heat of the climate, I did not doubt but, if I could
find out any such clay, I might botch up some such
pot as might, being dried by the sun, be hard enough
and strong enough to bear handling, and to hold any

"VOL. I. ' Sr G-
things that was dry, and required to be kept so; and
as this was necessa' in preparing corn, meal, &c.'
which was the thing was upon, I resolved to make
some as large as I could, and fit only to stand like
jars to hold what should be put into them. ' '

It would make the reader pity me, or rather laugh
at me, to tell how many awkward ways I took to
raise this paste, what odd misshapen ugly things!
made, how many of them fell in, and how many fell
out, the clay not being stiff enough to bear its own-
weight; how many cracked by the over-violent heat
of the sun, being setout too hastily; and how many
foil to pieces with only removing, as well before as
after they were dried; and, in a word, how, after
having laboured hard to find the clay, to dig it, to
temper it, to bring it home, and work it, I could not
make above two large earthen ugly things, Icannot
call them jars in about two months labour.

However, as the sun baked these two very dry and
hard, I lifted them very gently up and set them down
again in two great wicker-baskets, which I had'made
on purpose for them that they might not break; and,
as between the pot and the basket there was a little
room to spare, 1 stuffed it full of the rice and barley
straw; and these two pots being to stand always dry,
I thought would hold my dry corn, and perhaps the
meal when the cord was bruised,

Though I miscarried so much in my design for
large pots, yet I made several smaller things with
better success; such as little round pots, flat dishes,
pitchers, and pipkins, and any thing my hand turned
10; and the heat of the sun baked them strangely

lard. , '

But all this would not answer my end, which was
to get an earthen pot to hold what was liquid, and
bear the fire, which none of these could do. It hap-
pened after some time, making a pretty large fire for
- cooking my meat, when I went to put it out, after I
had done with it, I found a broken piece of one of
my earthenware vessels in the fire, burnt as hard as a :'
stone, and red as a tile. I was greatly surprised to
" see it, and said to myself, that certainly they might be
made to burn whole, if they would burn broken.

This set me to study how to order my fire, so as to
make it burn me some pots. 'I had no notion of a '
kiln such as the potters burn in, or of glazing them
with lead, though I had some lead to do it with; but
I placed three large pipkins, and two ,or three pots,
in a pile one upon another, and placed my fire-wood
all round it with a great heap of embers under them :
I plied the fire with fresh fuel round the outside, and
upon the top, till I saw the pots in the inside red-hot
quite through, and observed that they did not crack
at all: when I saw them clear red, I let them stand
' in that heat about five or six hours, till I found one
of them, though it did not crack, did melt or run; for
the sand which was mixed with the clay melted by '
the violence of the heat, and would have run into
glass, if I had gone on; so I slacked my fire gradu-
ally, till the pots began to abate of the red colour;
and watching them all night that I might not let the
fire abate .too fast, in the morning I had three very
good, I- will not say handsome pipkins, and two other
earthen pots, as hard burnt as could be desired; and
one of them perfectly glazed with the running of the
sand.

After this experiment I need not say that I wanted
no sort of earthenware for my'use; but I must needs
say, as to the shapes of them, they were very indifi'er-
out, as any one may suppose, when I had no way of
making them, but as the children make dirt-pies, or .
as a woman would make pics that never learnt to
raise paste. '

No joy at a thing of so mean a nature was ever
equal to mine, when I found I had made an earthen
pot. that would bear the fire; and I had hardly pati-
ence to stay till they were cold, before I set one upon
the fire again with some water in it, to boil me some
meat, which I did admirably well; and with a piece
of a kid I made some very good broth, though 1;124 arm are} Abram-ones

wanted oatmeal, and several other ingredientsrequi-
site to make it so good as I would have had it.

My next concern was to get me a stone mortar to
stamp or heat some corn in; for as to the mill, there
was no thought of arriving to that perfection of art
with one pair of hands. To supply this want, I was
at a great loss; for of all the trades in the world I was
as perfectly unqualified for a stone-cutter, as for any
whatever; neither had I any tools to go about it with.
I spent many a day to find out a great stone big
enough to cut hollow, and make fit for a mortar, and
could find none at all except what was in the solid
rock, and which I had no way to dig or cut out; nor '
indeed were the rocks in the island of hardness suffi-
cient, but were all of a sandy crumbling stone, which
would neither bear the weight of an heavy pestle, nor
would break the corn without filling it with sand; 50,
after a great deal of time lost in searching for a stone,
I gave it over, and resolved to look out a great block
of hard wood, which I found indeed much easier;
and getting one as big as I had strength to stir, I
rounded it, and formed it on the outside with my axe
and hatchet; and then with the-help of fire and infia
nite labour, made an hollow place in it, as the Indi-
ans in Brasil make their canoes; After this, I made
a great heavy pestle or beater of the wood called the
iron-wood, and this I prepared and laid by against I
had my next crop of corn, when l propsed to myself
to grind or rather pound, my corn or meal to make
my bread.

My next difficulty was to make a sieve or searce,
to dress my meal, and part it from the bran and the
husk, without which [did not see it possible I could
have any bread. This was a most difficult thing, so
much as but to think on; for to be sure I had nothing
like the necessary things to make it with ; I mean tine.
thin canvass, or stuff, to searce the meal through.
And here I was at a full stop for man months ; nor
did I really know what to do': linen had none left
but what was mere rags ; I had goat's hair, but neither
knew I how to weave 'or spin it; and had I known
how, here were no tools to work it with. All. the
remedy that I found for this, was, that at last I did
remember I had among the seamen's clothes which
were saved out of the ship, some neckcloths of calico
or muslin ;.and with some pieces of these I made
three small selves, but proper enough for the work ;
and thus I made shift for some years; how I did
afterwards, I shall show in its place.

The baking part was the next thing to be considered, '
and how I should make bread when I came to have ~
corn; for, first, I had no yeast: as to that part, there
was no supplying the want, so I did not concern my-
self muchabout it, But for an oven, 1 was indeed in
great pain. At length I found out an experiment for
that also, which was this ; I made some earthen ves-
sels very broad, but not deep ; that is to say, about
two feet diameter, and not above nine inches deep;
these, I burnt in the fire, as I had done the other, and
laid them by; and when I wanted to bake, I made a
great fire upon thehearth, which I had paved with
some square tiles of my own making and burning .
also ; but I should not call them square. .

When the fire-wood was burnt pretty much into
embers, or live coals, I drew them forward upon this
hearth, so as to cover it all over; and there I let
them lie, till the hearth was very hot; then sweeping
away all the embers, I set down my loaf, or loaves ;
and whelmifing down the earthen pot upon them, drew
the-embers all round the outside of the pot, to keep
in, and add to the heat ; and thus, as well as in the
best ovens in the world, I baked my barley--loaves,
and became in a little time a more pastry-cook into
the bargain ; for I made myself several cakes of the
rice, and puddings; indeed I made no pies, neither
had I any thing to put into them, supposing I had,
except the flesh either of fowls or goats. '

It need not be wondered at, if all these things tool: --
me up most part of the third year of my abode here;
for it is to he observed, that in the intervals of these
things I had my new harvest and husbandry to ma.
nage: for I reaped my corn in its season, and carried
it home as well as I could, and laid it up in the ear,
in my large baskets, till I had time to rub it out; for
I had no floor to thresh it on, or instrument to thresh

it with. 4 . _ , . '

And now indeed my stock of corn increasing, '
really wanted to build my barns bigger :- I wanted
place to lay it up in ; for the increase of the corn nor.
yielded me so much, that I had of - the barley abou
twenty bushels, and of the rice as much, or more ;
insomuch that I now resolved to begin to use it freely,
for my bread had been quite gone a great while ; also
I, resolved to see what quantity would be sufficient
for me a' whole year, and to sow but once a year.

' Upon the whole, I found that the forty bushels of
barley and rice were much more than I could con-
sume in a year : so I resolved to sow just the same
quantity every year that I sowed the last, in hopes'
that such a quantity would fully provide me with
bread, ch. '

All the while these things were doing, you may be
sure my thoughts ran many times upon the prOspect
of land which I had seen upon the other side of the
island ; and I was not without secret wishes, that I

,was on shore there, fancying that seeing the main
land, and an inhabited country, I might find some
way or other to convey myself farther, and perhaps
at last find some means of escape.

But all 'this while I made no allowance for the
dangers of such a condition, and how I might fall
into the hands of savages, and perhaps such as I
might have reason tothink far worse than the lions
and tigers of Africa: that if I once came into their
power, I should run an hazard more than a thousand
to one of being killed, and perha s of being eaten;
for I had heard that the peeple of the Caribean coasts
were cannibals, or men-eaters; and I knew by the
latitude that I could not be far off from that shore :
that, suppose they were not cannibals, yet they might
kill me, as many Europeans who had fallen into their
hands had been served, even when they had been ten
or twenty together : much more I that was but one,
and could make little or no defence. All these things, -
I say, which I ought to have considered well of, and
I did cast up in my thoughts afterwards, yet took
none of my apprehensions at first; "and my head ran
nilightily upon the thonghts of getting over to that
s ore. .

Now I wished for my boy Xury, and the long-boat,
with the shoulder of mutton sail, with which 1 sailed
above a thousand miles on the coast of Africa ; but
this .was in vain. Then I thought I would go and
look on our ship's boat, which, as I have said, was
blown up upon the shore a great way in the storm,
when we were first cast away. She lay almost where
she did at first but not quite; and was turned by the
force of the waves and the winds almost bottom up-
wards, against the high ridge of a beachy rough sand,
but no water about her as before. ' _

If I had had hands to have refitted her, and have
launched her into the water, the boat would have done
well enough, and I might have gone back into the
Brasils with her easy enough ; but I might have easily
foreseen that I could no more turn her, and set her
upright upon her bottOm, than I Could remove the
island. However, I went to the :wood, and cut levers
and rollers, and brought them to the boat, resolving to
try what I c0uld do ; suggesting to myself, that if I
could but turn her down, I might easily repair the
damage she had received, and she would be a -very
good boat, and I mightgo to sea in her very easily.

I spared no pains indeed in this piece of fruitless
toil, and spent, I think, three or four weeks about it;
at last finding it impossible to heave it up with my
little. strength, I fell to diggingaway the sand to un-
dermine it; and so to make it fall down, setting pieces
' of wood to thrust and guide it right in the fall. .

But when I had done this, I was unable to stir it
up again, or to get under it, much less to move it _
forwards towards the Water ; so I was forced to give
it over; and, yet though I gave over the hopes of the
boat, my desire to venture over for the main increas-
ed, rather than decreased, as the means of it seemed
im'ii'ossible. ' ,
his at length set me upon thinking whether it was
not possible to make myself a canoe or periagua, such
as the natives of those climates make, even withou
tools, or, as I might say, without hands, viz. of th
trunk of a great tree. This I not only thought possi
ble, but easy; and pleased myself extremely with my
thoughts of making it, and with my having much more
convenience for it than any of the Negroes or Indio'
ans ; but not at all considering the particular inconve;
nience'which I lay under more than the Indians did,
viz. want of hands to move it into the water, when
it was made 2 a difficulty much harder for me to sur-
mount than all the consequences of want of tools
could be to them: for what was it to me that when I
had chosen a vast tree in the woods, I might with
great trouble cut it down, if after {might be able with
my tools to hew and dub the outsideinto a preper
shape of a boat, and burn or cut out the inside to
make it hollow, so as to make a boat of it, if, after all>>
this, I must leave it just there w rare I found it, and
was not able to launch it into the water ?

'One would have thought I could not have had the
least reflection upon my mind of this circumstance,
while I was making this boat, but I should have im-
mediately thought how I should get it into the sea :
but my thoughts were so intent upon my voyage over
the sea in it, that I never once considered how I
should get it'off the land ; and itwas really in its own
nature more easy for me to' guide it over forty-five
miles of sea, than about forty-five fathoms of land,
where it lay, to set it afloat in the water.

I went to work upon this boat the most like a fool "
that ever man did, who had any of his senses awake,
I pleased myself with the design, withont determin-

. ing whether I was ever able to undertake it ; not but
that the difiiculty. of launchingmy boat came often
into my head; .but' I put a stop to my own inquiries
into it by this foolish answer, which 1 gave myself;
Let me 'first make it, I'll warrant I'll find some way
or other to get it along, when it is done. _ '

This was a most preposterous method; but the eager
ness of my fancy prevailed, and to work 'I went, and
felled a cedar tree: I question much whether Solomon
ever had 'such an one for the building the temple 5:
Jerusalem; it was five feet ten inches diameter at the
lower part next the stump, and four feet eleven inches
diameter at the end of twenty-two feet, after which it
lessened for a while, and then it parted into branches.
It was not without infinite labour thatI felled this
tree: I was twenty days hacking and hew'ing at it at
the bottom; I was fourteen more getting the branches
and limbs, and the vast spreading head of it, cut ofl',
which I hacked and hewed through with my axe and
hatchet, with inexpressible labour: after this it cost
me a 'month to shape it, and dub it to a proportion, .
and to something like the bottom of a boat, that it
might swim upright as it ought to do. It cost me near
three months more to clear the inside, and work it
out so as to make an exact boat of.it: this I did in<<
deed without fire, by mere mallet and chissel, and by i
the dint of hard labour; till I had brought it to be a
very handsome periagua, and big enough to have car-
ried six-and-twenty men, and consequently big enough
to have carried me and all my cargo. _ .

When I had gone through this work, I was ex-
tremely delighted with it: the boat was really much
bigger than I ever saw a. canoe or periagua, that was
made of one tree, in my life '; many a weary stroke it
had cost, you may be sure, for there remained nothing
but to get it into the water; and hadI gotten it into
the water, I make no question but I should have be-
gun the maddest voyage, and the most unlikely to .be
performed, that ever was undertaken. .

But- all my devices triage? it into the water faile

9 1 i. '
me, though they cost infinite labour too; it layabout
one hundred yards from the water, and not more;
but the first inconvenience was, it was up hill towards
the creek. Well, to take away this discouragement,
I resolved to dig into the surface of the earth, and so
make a declivity; this I began, and it cost me a pro-
digious deal of pains: but who grudge pains, that
have their deliverance in view? but when this was
worked through, and this difficulty managed, it was
still much at one; for I could no more stir the canoe,
than I could the other boat. _

Then I measured the distance of ground, and re-
solved to cut a dock, or canal, to bring the water up
to the canoe, seeing I could not bring the canoe dotvn
to the water; well, I began this work, and when I
began to enter into it, and calculated how deep it was
to be dug, how broad, how the stuff to be thrown out,
I found, that by the number of hands I had, being
none but my own, it must have been ten or twelve
years before I should have gone through with it; for
the shore lay high, so that at the upper end it must
have been at least twenty feet deep: so at length, though
with great reluctancy, I gave this attem t over also. .

This grieved me heartily; and now saw, though
too late,SSthe folly of beginning a work before we count
the cost, and before we judge rightly of our own
' strength to go through with it.

In the middle of this work I finished my fourth
year in this place, and kept my anniversary with the
same devotion, and with as much comfort, as ever
before; for by aconstant study, and serious applica-
tion of the word of God, and'by the assistance of his
grace, I gained a different knowledge from what I
had before; I entertained different notions of things;
I looked now upon the world as a thing remote;
which I had nothing to do with, no expectation from,
and indeed no desires about: in a word, I had no--
thing indeedto do with it, nor was ever like to have;
so I thought it looked as we may perhaps look upon
it hereafter viz. as a place. -I had lived in, but was
come out of it; and well I might say, as father Abra-
ham to" Dives, ' " Between me and thee there is a
great gulph fixed."

In the first place, I was removed from all the wick-
edness of the world here: I had neither the lust of
the flesh, the lust of the eye, or the pride of life: I .
had nothing to covet, for I had all I was now capable
of enjoying; -I was lord of the whole manor, or, if I
pleased, I might call myself king or emperor over the
whole countr'y'which 1 had possession of: there were
no rivals: I had no competitor, none to-di'spute sove-
reignty or command with me; 'I might have raised
ship-loads of corn, but I had name for it; so I let
as little grow as I thought enough for my occasion:
I had tortoise or turtles enough; but now and then
one was as much as I could put to any use: I had

'timber enough to have built a fleet of ships; I had .
grapes enough to have made wine, or to have cured
into raisins, to have loaded that fleet when they had
been built. ' '

But all I could make use of, was-all that was valu-
able: I had enough to eat, and to supply my wants,

and what was all the rest to me? If I killed more
flesh than I could eat, the dog must eat it, or the ver-

' min; if I sowed more com than I could eat, it must

be spoiled. The trees that I cut down were lying to
rot on the ground, I could make no moreuse of them
than for fuel; and that I had no occasion for, but to

dress my food. .

In a word, the nature and experience of things dic-
tated tome upon just reflection, that all the good
things of this world are no farther good to us, than as
they are for our use : and that whateverwe may heap
up indeed to give to others, we enjoy as much as we-
can use, and no more. .The most coveteous griping
miser in the world would have been cured of the vice '
of coveteousness, if he had been in my case; for ,I
possessed infinitely more than I knew-What to do
with. I had no room for desire, except it was of
things which I had not, and they were but trifles,
though indeed of great use to me. I had, as I hinted
before, a parcel of money, as well gold as silver,
about thirty-six pounds sterling; alas! there the nasty,
sorry, useless stuff lay; I had no manner of business
for it; and I often thought with myself, thatI would
have given an handful of it for a gross of tobacco-
pipes, or for an hand-mill to grind my corn ; nay, I
would have given it all for six-penny-worth of turnip
.and carrot seed out of England, or for an handful of
peas and beans, and a bottle of ink: as it was, I had
not the least advantage by it, or benefit from it; but
there it lay in a drawer, andgrew mouldy with the
damp of the cave, in the'wet season; and if -I had
had the drawer full of diamonds, it had been the same
case; and they had been of no manner of value to
me because of no use. _ . - .
I had now brought my state of life to be much
easier in itself than it was at first, and much easier to
my mind, as well as to my body. I frequently sat
down to my meat with thankfulness, and admired the
hand of God's providence, which had thus spread my
table in the wilderness: I learn to look more upon.
the bright side of my condition, and less upon the
dark side; and to consider what I enjoyed, rather
than what I wanted ; and this gave me sometimes such
secret comforts, that I cannot express them; and
which I took notice of here, to put those discontented .
people in mind of it, who cannot enjoy comfortably
what Godhath given them, because they see and covet
something that he has not given them : all our discon-
tents about what we want, appeared. to me to Spring
from the want of thankfulness for what we have.-
Anpther reflection Was of great use to me, and
doubtless would be so to any one that should fall into
such distress as mine was ; and this was to compare my
present condition with what I at first expected it should
be; nay, with what it would certainly have been, if the ~
good providence of God had not wonderfully ordered
the ship to be cast' up near to the shore, where I not.
only could come at her, but could bring what I got
'out of her to the shore for my relief and comfort ,
without which I had wanted tools to work, weapons
iorelefence,'or gunpowder and shot forgetting my

00 . ..

I spent whole hours, I may say whole days, in re-

presenting to myself in the most lively colours, how -I
must have acted, if I had got nothing out of the ship;
how I could not have so much'as got any food, ex-
_ cept fish and turtles; and that, as it was long before I
found any of them, I must have perished first: that I
should have lived, if I had not perished, like a mere
savage : that . if I had killed a goat or a fow' by any
~ contrivance, I had no way to flay or open them, or
part the flesh from the skin and the boWels, or to cut
it up; but must gnaw it with my teeth, and pull it
with my claws, like a beast.

- These reflections made me very sensible of the good-
ness of Providence to me. and very thankful for my
present condition, with all its hardships and misfor-
tunes: and this part also I cannot but recommend to
the reflection of those who are apt in their misery to
say, Is any afl'liction like mine? Let them consider,
how much worse the cases of some people are, and
what their case might have been, if Providence had '
thought fit.

I had another reflection which assisted me also to
comfort my mind with hopes ; and this was compar-
ing my present condition with what I. had deserved,
and had therefore reason to expect from the hand of
Providence. I had lived a dreadful life, perfectly .des-
titute of the knowledge and fear of God ; I had been
well instructed by father and mother; neither had they
been wanting to me in their early endeavours to infuse
a religious awe of God into my mind, a senSe of my
duty, and of what the nature and end of my. beingre--
quired of me. But, alas ! falling early into thesea--
faring life, which of all the lives is the most destitute
of the fear of God, though his terrors are always be-
fore them ; I say, falling early into the seafaring life,
and. into seafaring company, all that little sense o'l're>>
ligion which I had entertained, was laughed out ofme
by my messmates; by an hardened despising of danv
gers', and the views of death, which grew habitual to
me; by my long absence from all manner of opport-
' tunities to converse with any thing but what was like
myself, or to hear any thing of what was good, or
tended towards it. -
, So void was I of every thing that. was good, or of
the least sense of what I was, or was to be, that in the
greatest deliverance I enjoyed, such as my escape from
Sallee, my being takenup by the Portuguese master
of the ship my being planted so well. in Brvasil, my
receiving the cargo from England, and the like I never
once had the words, Thank God, so much as on my
mind, or in my mouth ; nor in the greatest distress
had I so much thought as to pray to him ; nor so
much as to say Lord, have mercy upon me ! no, not
to mention the name of God, unless it was to swear
by, and blaspheme it.

I had terrible reflections upon my mind for many
months, as I have already observed, on the account of
my wicked and hardened life past; and when I looked
about me, and considered what particular providen-
ces had attended me, since my coming into this place,
and how God had dealt bountifully with me ; had
not only punished me less than my iniquity deserved,
but had so plentifully provided for me; this gave me
'great hopes that my repentance was accepted, and
that God had yet mercies. in store for me. -

With these reflections I worked my mind up, not
only to resignation to the will of God in the present
disposition of my circumstances, but even to a sincere
thankfulness of my condition ; and that I, who was
yet a living man, ought not to complain, seeing I had-
not the due. punishment of my sins; that I enjoyed so
many mercies, which Ihad no reason to have expected
in that place, that I ought never more to repine at my
condition, but to rejoice, and to give daily thanks,
for that daily bread, which nothing but a cloud of
wonders could have brought : that I ought to consider
I had been fed evenby a miracle, even as great as
that of feeding Elijah by ravens; nay, by a long series
, of miracles; and that I could hardly have named a .
place in the uninhabited. part of the world, where I
could have been cast more to my advantage; aplace,
where as I had no society, which was my affliction
on one hand, so I found no ravenous beast, no furious
wolves or tigers, to threaten at life; no venomous
creatures, or poisonous, which might have fed on to
my hurt ; no savages to murder and devour me.

In a word, as my life wasa life-of sorrow one way,
so it was alife of mercy another; and I wanted no-
thing togmal'te'ift a,,life of comfort, but to be able to
make my senseHof-TGod's goodnes to' me, and care
over me in this'eo'ndition,be my. daily consolation; -
and after I made a just improvement of these things,
I went away, and was no more sad.

I had now been here so long, that many things
which 1 brought on shore for my help, were either
quite gone, or very much wasted, and near spent.

My ink, as I observed, had been gone for 'some
time, all but a very little, which I eked out with water.
a little and a little, till it was so pale it scarce left any
appearance of black upon the paper : as long. as"it:-'>
lasted, I made use of it to minute dOWn the days. of
the month on which any remarkable thing happened
to me ; and first, by castingepp times past, I remema
her that there was. a strange concurrence of days in
the various providences which befel me, and which,
if I had been supersticiously inclined to observe days
as fatal or fortunate, I might have had reason to have
looked upon with a great deal of curiosity.

First, had observed, that the same day that I
broke away from my father and my friends, and ran
away to Hull in- order to go to sea, the same day at:
terwards I was taken by the Sallee man of war, and
made a slave.

The same day of the year that I escaped out of the

Wreck of the ship in Yarmouth Roads, that same dayof the year afterwards I made my escape from Sallee
in the boat.

The same day of the year I was born on, via. the
20th of September, the same day I'had my life somi- _
raculously saved tWenty-six years after, when I was
cast on shore in this island; so that my wicked life,
and solitary life, both began on a day. ' '

The next thing to my ink's being wasted, was tha
of my bread, I mean the buiscuit which Ibrought on
of the ship. ~ This I had husbanded to the last degree

' allowing myself -.but one Cake of bread a day, for
' above a year': and yet I'was quite without bread for

a year before I got any corn of my own : and great

reason I had to be thankful that I had any at all, the

getting it being, as has been already observed, next to
miraculous. ' '
My clothes too began to decay mightily : as to linen,

I had none 3. good while, except some chequred shirts

which I found in the chests of the other seamen, and

which! carefully preserved, because many times I

could'bear no other clothes on but ashirt; and it was

a very great help to me, that I had among all the

men's clothes of the ship almost three dozen of shirts.
. There were also several thick watch--coats of the sea-

nen, which were left behind, but they were too hot
to wear ; and though it is true, that the weather was
so violent hot, that therewas no need "of clothes, yet

I-could not go quite naked ; no, though I had been
- inclined to it, whichl was not; nor could I abide

the thought of it, though I was all alone. .

One reason Why I could not go quite naked, was

I could not bear the heat of the sun so well when

quite naked as with some clothes on ; nay, the very

heat frequently blistered my skin ; whereas, with a.

shirt on, the air itself made some motion, and whist--
- ling under the shirt, was twofold cooler than without

it; no more could I ever bring. myself to go out-in
* the heat of the sun without a cap or a hat-: the heat
of the sun heating with such violence as it does in thatplace, would give me the headach'pr'esently, hydart.
ing so directlyon my head, without a cap or hat on, '
so that I could not bear "it; whereas, if I put on my
hat,__it would presently go away. ' ' ' ' .

_ Upon these views I began to consideraboutputting
the few tags I had, which I called clothes, into some
"order , I. had'worn out all tliewaistco'atsl had, and
my business was now to try if Iicould not make '
jackets out of the great watch-Coats which.I:'ha'd by
me, and with such other materials as I" had; so I set
to work a-tailoring, oi; rather indeed a-botching; for
I made m'o'st-'piteo'us work of it. However, I made

- 'shift' to make two in three waistcoats, which I hoped , '

would' serve. me. 'a'great. "while; as, for breaches-or
dravgers, I made but very sorry Shift indeed, till af-'
war 3. . . u . = - '
I have'meirtioned that I saved't-heskins of all the
creatures that I killed, I mean four footed ones; and
I had-hung them up stretchedout- with. sticks in: the '
sun; b'y'which means some of them'wer'e so dry and
hard,'ythat-they were fit for little ; but others, itseems,
'were "very useful. Thefirst thing- I made Of these
'was- a great cap for my head, with the hair on the'out-
, side to' shoot off the rains; and this I performed so
'well, that after this I made a suit of clothes wholly
,of those skins; that is to say, a waistcoat andhreeches
V ppe'nfaththe knees, and, both loose; for they were ra~
g'iitherwanted'to keep me cook-than to keep me warm.
;.. ' 452m ust not omit to. acknowledge, that they were
a, 'fgfiretchedly made; for if I was abad carpenter, I was
"aiworse tailor: however, they- were such a'sI made a
' very good" shift with; and when I was abroad, if it
happened to rain, the hair of the waistcoat and cap
being outmost, I was kept very dry. . '
After this I spent a deal of time and pains to. make
me an umbrella: I was indeed in great want of' one,
and had a great mind to make one: I had seen them
' 'made in the Brasils, where they are very 'useful in the
great heats which are there; and I felt the heats every
fat as great here, and greater too,- being nearer the
if} -

  

' i
eqinox; besides, as I was obliged to be much abroad,
it was a most .useful thing to me, as well' for the rains
as the heats. I teaka world of pains at it, and-was a
great while before I could make any thing likely to
hold; naY, after I thought I had hit the way, I spoiled
two or three before I made one to my mind; but at
last I made one that answered indifl'erently well. The
main difficulty I found Was to make it to.let down:
I could make it to spread; but if it did not let down
too, and. draw in, it would not be portable for me '
' any way, but just over my'head, which would not do.
However, at last, as I said, I made one to answer;
I covered it with skins, the hair upwards, so that it
cast off the rain like a penthouse, and kept off the sun
so effectually, that I could walk out in the hottest of
the weather, with greater advantage than I could be-
fore in the coolest; and when I'had no need of it, .1
. could Close it, and carry it under my arm. '

Thus 'I, lived mighty comfortably, my mind being
entirely composed by'resigning to the will of God,
and throwing myself wholly upon the disposal of his
providence; this made my life better than sociable;

, for when I began to regret the want of converSation,
I would ask myself, whether thus conversing mutu-
ally with my own thoughts, and as I hope I may. say,
with even my Maker, by ejaculations and petitions,
was not better than the utmost enjoyment Of human
society in the world? . jg,

I cannot say, that after this, for five years, any C3: ":2;
traordinary thing happened to me; but I lived on 31.14, "-
the same course, in the same posture and place, j'ti'Stf's'f'""f-'
as before. The chief thing I was employed in, be:-
sides my yearly labour of planting my barley and rice
and curing my raisins, of. both which I always kept
up just enough to have sufficient stock of the year's
provision beforehand; I say, besides this yearly la- ;
hour, and mydaily labour of going out witlrmy gun, .
I had one-labour to make me a canoe, which at last. I
finished: so that by digging a canal to it,ls.ix teet
wide, and four feet deep, I brought it into the creek,
almost half a mile: As for the first, that was so vastly
. ' big, as I made it without considering beforehand, as
I ought to do, how I should be able to launch it; 'so
, never being able-to bring it to the water, or bring the
water toit, I was obliged'to let it lie where. it was,
as a'memorandum to teach me to be wiser next time.
Indeed; the next time, though I could not get a tree
prOper far it, and was in a place where I could not
get the water to it at any less distance'than, as I have
' said, 'of near half a mile; yet as I 'saw'it was practi-
, cable at last, I never gave it over; and though I was
near two years about it, yet I never grudged my la- "
hour, in hopes of having a boat to go ad to sea at least.
However, thought my little periagua was finished,
yet the size of it was'not at all answerable to the de-
sign which I had in view, when I made 'the first; I
mean of venturing ov er to the Terra Firma, where it
was above forty miles broad; aCcordingl y, the small. .
ness of my boat assisted to put an end to that design,
and now I thought no more of it. But as I had a
boat, my next design was to make a tour round the
island: for as I had been on the other ' side, in one
place, crossing, as I have already described. it, over.
the land, so the-discoveries I made in that journey
made me very eager to see the other parts of the
coast; and now I had a boat, I thought of nothing
but sailing round the island".- -

For this purpose, and that I might do every thing
with discretion and consideration, I fitted up a little
mast to my boat, and m'elde a 'sail to it out of some of
the pieces of the ship's sail, which lay in store, and -
of which I had a great store by me. '

Having fitted my mast and sail, and tried the boat,
I found she would sail very well. Then I made little
lockers and boxes at each end of my boat, to put pro.
visions, necessaries and ammunition, 850. into, to
be kept dry, either from rain, or the spray of the sea;
and a little long hollow place I cut in the inside of
the boat, where Icould lay my gun, making a flap to.
hang dewn over it to keep it dry.
I fixed my umbrella also in a step at the stern, like
a. mast, to stand over my head, and keep the heat'of
the sun ofl'me', like an awning; and thus I every now
and then took a little voyage upon the see, but never
went far out, n'or far from. the little creek ; but at last,
being eager to view the circumference of my little
kingdom, 'I resolved upOn mytour, and accordingly
I victualled my ship for-the voyage; putting initivo
dozen of my.loaves- (cakes I should r'ather call them)
of barelyLbread'; an earthen pot full of parched rice,
8. food I ate a great deal of, a little bottleof rum, halt
a goat, and powder with. shot for killing more, and
. two large watch-coats, of those Which, as I mentioned
before, 'I- had saved out of the seamen's chests; these
I took, one to lie" upon, and the other to cover me in
the night. ' _ .' .

It was the 6th of November, in the sixth year of
my reign, or my captivity, which you please, that I
set ' out on' this voyage, and I found it much longer
" than I. expected; for though the island itself was not
.very large, yet whenJ came'to the east side of it, 'I
found a great ledge of rocks lie out about two leagues
into the sea, some above water, some under it; and
beyond this a shoal of sand, lying dry half a league
more; so that I was obliged to go a great way out to
sea to doule that point. ' , ,

When I first discovered them, I was going to give
over my enterprise, and come back again, not know-
ing how far it might oblige e to go out to sea, and
above all, doubting how Ls buld go back again; so I:
came to an anchor, for I had made me a kind of an
anchor with a piece of a brdken. grappling which 1
get out of the ship. ' ' ,

' Having secured my boat, I took my gun, and won
,on shore,.climbing up an hill, which seemed to over
look that point, where I saw the full extent of it, and
resolved to venture. ' '-

" In my viewing the sea from that hill where I stood,
3". perceived a strong, and indeed a most furious cur-
rent, which ran to the east, even came close to the
-\

point and, I took the more notice of it, because 3.
saw there might be some danger, that when I came
into it, I' mightibe carried out to sea by the strength
of it, and'not beable to make theiisland again. And
"indeed, had Inot gottenfirsttupon this bill, I believe
it would'have been so ; for therewas the same current
on- the other side of the island, only that it set, all. at
a farther-distance ; and I saw there was a strong eddy
finder'thef'shqre; so I had nothing-to-dd but'to 'get
- out 'tefathegfir'st' current, and I should-presently be in
an e 3' >> . -

' 3 I layyhereyhowever, two days; because the wind
blowing pretty fresh (at E. S. E. and that being just
contrary to the said current) made a great breach of
the sea upon the point ; ,so that it was not safe for me
to keep too close to the shore for the breach, nor to

' go too far off because. of the stream, 5 . . .

_ The third day in the morning, the wind having;
abated Over-night,- the Sea 'tvas Calm, and I ventured :,
but _I am a warning-piece again toall rash .and igno<<
rant pilots; fornno sooner was I, come. to the point.
when I was not my boat's length from the shore, but
'I found myself in a great depth of water, and a cur-
rent like a sluice of a mill. It carried my boat along
with it with such violence, that all I could do could
not keep her somuch as on the edge of it; but I found
it hurried me fartherand fartherout from the eddy,
which {vas on the left hand; There was no wind sti r-
ring to help me, and all that I could do with my
paddles signified nothing"; and now I began to give
myself over for lost; for, as the current was on both ,
sides the island, I knew in a few leagues distance they
must join again, and then I was irrecoverably gone;
nor did I see any possibility of avoiding it;' so that "I
had no prospect before me but of perishing ; not by '
the sea, for that was calm enough, but of "starving for
hunger. I had indeed found a tortoise on the Show,
as big almost as leould lift, and had tossed it into
the boat; and I had a great jar of fresh water, that
Is to say, one of my earthen pots: but what was all
this to being driven into the Vast ocean, where to be
. sure, there was no shore, no main land or island, for
a thousand leagues at least? . . .
And now I saw how easy it was for the providence
of God to make the most miserable condition that
mankind could be in, worse. Now I looked back
'upon my desolate solitary island, as the most pleasant
place in the world, and all the happiness my heart "
could wish far, was to be there again. I stretched out
my hands to it with eager wishes; ""0 happy desert !"
said I, " I shall never see the more! 0 miserable
creature 3" said I, " whither am I going !" Then I
rcpmached myself with my unthankful temper, and
how I had re ined at my solitary condition; and now
what would giveto been shore there again ? Thus
'we neversee the true state of our condition, till it is
illustratedto us by its contraries ; nor know how to
value what we enjoy, but by the Want of it. It is
scarce possible to imagine the consternation I was
now in, being driven frOm my beloved island (for so it

_ appeared to me now to be) into the wideocean, ala
most two leagues, and in the utmost despair of ever
recovering it again : however, I worked hard, till in-
deed my strength was almost exhausted; and kept
my boat as much to the northward, that is, towards
the side of the current which the eddy lay on, as pos-
sibly I'could; when about noon, as the sun passed the
meridian, I thought I felt a little breeze of wind in
my,,face springing up from the S. S. E. This cheered ,
my'h'eart a little, and especially when in about half
an hour. more it blew a. pretty small gentle gale. By
this time Iwas'gotten ,at a frightful distance from the
island; and, had the leastcloud or hazy weather in-
tervened, I had been undone another way too: for I
had no compass on board, and 'should never have
known how to have steered towards the island, if 1
had but once lost sight of it ; but the weather contin--
uing clear, I applied myself to get up my mast again,
and spread my sail standing away to the north as
much as possible, to get out of the current.
Just as I had set my mast and sail,- and the boat
began to stretch away, I saw even by the ,elearnessof
the Water, some alteration of the current was near ;
for where the current was so strong, the water was
foul; but perceiving the water clear, I found the cur-
rent abate, and presently I- found to the east,- at about
half a mile, a- breach of the sea upon some rocks:
these rocks I found caused the current to part again
and as the main stress of it ran away more southerly
leaving the rocks to the north-east, so the other. re.
turned by the repulse of the rock, and made a strong
eddy, which ran back again to the north-west with a.
verysharp stream. '

They who know what it is to-have a reprieve

' brought to them upon the ladder, or to be rescued
from thieves just going to murder them, or who have
been in such like extremeties,_ may guess what my
present surprise of joy was, and how gladly I put my

' boat into the stream of thiseddy ; and the wind also

freshening, how gladly I 5 read my sail to it, running.
cheerfully before the wind: 'andwith a strong tide or

eddy under foot. " y .

This eddy carried me about a league in my way
back again directly towards the island, but about two
leagues more towards the northward than the current

lay, which carried me away at first ; so that when'I ,

came near the island, I found myself Open '_to the
northern shore of it, that is to say, the other end of
the island, opposite to that which I went out from.

When I had made something more than a league
of way by the help of this current or eddy, I found

it was spent, and served me no farther. However I

found, that being between the two great currents, viz.
that on the south side which had hurried me away,
and that on the north which lay about two leagues on
the other side; I say, between these two, in the west
of the island, I found the water at least'still, and run-
ring no way; and having still a breeze of wind fair
for me, I kept on steering directly for the island,

though not making such fresh way as I'did before.

V
I
. - About four o'clock in the evening, being then within
about a league of the island, I found the point of the
rocks which occasioned the distance stretching out as
is described before, to the southward, and casting off
the Current more southwardly, had of course made
another eddy to the north ; and this I found very
strong, but directly setting the way my course lay, '
which was due west, but almost-full north; However,
having a fresh gale, I stretched across this eddy slant-
ing north-west, and- in about an hour came within
about a mile of the shore, where, it being smooth wa-
ter, I soon'got to land. -- \.

When I was on shore, I fell on my knees, and gave
God thanks for my deliverance, resolving to lay aside
all thoughts of my deliverance by my boat ; and re-
freshing myself with such things as I had, I brought
my boat close to the shore, in a little cove that I had
"espied under some trees, and laid. me down to sleep,
being quite spent with the labour and fatigue of the _
'voyage._ - _ _.,-:..~ - '

' I was now at a-great loss. which way to get home
with my boat; I had run so much hazard, and know
too much the case to think of attempting it by the
way I went out; and what might be at the other side
(I mean the west side) I knew not, nor had I any-
mind to 'run any more ventures ; so I. only resolved
in thetmorning to make my way westward along the
shore,'and to see if there was no creek where I might
lay up my frigate in safety, so as to have her again it

I wanted her. .In about three miles, or thereabouts,
coasting the shore, I came to a very good inlet, 0r
bay, about a mile'over, which narrowed till it came
to a very little rivulet, or brook, where I found a con-
venient harbour for my boat, and where she lay as
if she had been in a little dock made. on purpose for
her ; 'here I put in, and having stowed my boat, very
gafe I went on shdre to look about me, and see where

was. . -
. I soon found I had but a little passed by the place
whereI had been before when I travelled on foot to
- that shore; so taking nothing out of my boat but my
gun and my umbrella, for it was exceeding hot, I.
began my march: the .way was comfortable enough,
after such a voyage as I had been upon, and I reached
my old bower in the evening, where I found every
thing standing'as I left it; for Ialways kept it in good
order, being, as;I said before, my country- iouse. '

I got Over the fence, and laid me down in the shade-

0 rest my limbs, for I was very weary, and fell asleep:

ut judge you if you can, that read my story, what a
surpries'I must be in when I was awaked outof my '
sleep by a voice calling me by my name seVeral times,
"Robin, Robin, Robin Crusoe? Where are you?
'Where have you been i". - -

I wasso dead asleep at first, being fatigued with
rowing, or paddling, as it is called, the first part of
the day, and walking the latter" part, that I did not
awake thoroughly; and dozing between sleeping and
waking, thought I dreamed that somebody spoke to
' me: but as the voice continued to repeat Robin Cru-
.. sue, Robin Crusoe; at last I began to. awake more '

perfectly, and was at first dreadfully frighted, and
' startled up in the utmost consternation : but no sooner
were my eyes open, but I saw my Pol sitting on the
10p of the hedge, and immediately knew that this was
he that Spoke to me; forjustin such bemoaning lan-
guage I had used to-talk to him, and teach him ; and
- he had learnt it so perfectly, that he would sit upon
my finger, and lay his bill close to. my face, and cry,
" Poor Robin Crusoe, where are you? Where have
you been? 'How came you here?" and such things as

had taught him.

However, even though I-knew it was the parrot,
and that indeed it could be no body else, it was a good
while before I could compose myself. First, I was
amazed how the creature got thither, and then how' he
should just keep about the place, and no where eise:

but as I was well satisfied it could be nobody but lino

calling him by his name, Pol, the sociable creature
came to me, and sat upon my thumb, as he used to. '
do, and continued talking to me, Poor Robin Crusoe,
and, how did" I come here? and where had I been?
just as if he had been overjoyed to see me again; and
so I carried him home along with me. '

' I had now had enough of rambling to sea for some
time, and had enough to do for many days to sit still,
and reflect upon the' danger I had been in. .I would
have been very glad to have had my boat again on
my side of the island, but I knew not how it was
practicable to get it about: as to the east side of the
island, which I had gone round, I knew well enough
there was no venturing that way; my very heart would
shrink, and my very blood run' chill, but to think of
it: and to the other side of the island, I did not know .
how it might be there; but supposing the currant ran
with the same'force against the shore at the'east, as it
passed by it on the other, I might run the same risk
of being driven down the stream, and carried bythe
island, as 1 had been before of being carried away
from it.. So with these thoughts I contented myself
to be without any boat, though it had. been the pro-

" duct of so, many months labour to make it, and of so
many more to get it' into the sea. - - .
In this government of my temper Iremained near '

a year, lived a very sedate retired life, as you may
well suppose ; and my thoughts being very much com-
posed, as to my condition, and fully comforted in re?
signing myself to the disposition of Providence, I
thought I lived really very Happily in all things, ex.
cept that of society. ' -

I improved myself in this time, in all the mechanic
exercises which my necessities put me upon applying
myself to; and I believe could, upon occasion, have
made a very good carpenter, especially considering
how. few toolsI had. . ' , '

Besides this, I arrived at an unexpected perfection
m my earthenware, and contrived well enough to
make them with _a. wheel, which .I found infinitely
easier and better; because I made things round and
shapeable, which before were filthy things indeed to
look on. ' But I think I never was more vain of my
own performance, or more joyful for any thing I found
out, than for my being able to make a tobacco-pipe;
and though it was avery ugly clumsy thing when it-
was done, and only burnt red like other earthenware,
yet as it was hard and firm, and would draw the
smoke, I was exceedingly comforted with it; for I
had been always used to smoke, and there were pipes '
in the ship, but I forgot them at first, not knowing
there Was tobacco in the>> island; and afterwards,
when I searched the ship again, I could not come at'
any pipes at all. . . , a

In my wicker-ware I also improved much, and '
made abundance of necessary baskets, as well as my
invention shewed me. though not'very handsome, yet
convenient far my laying things up in, or fetching
things home in. For example, if ' I killed a goat,
abroad, I could hang it up in a'tree, flayit, and dress
it, and cut it in pieces, and bring it home in a basket:
and the like 'by a turtle ; I could opt it up, take out
the eggs and a piece or two of the flesh,~which was
enough. for me, and bring them borne in a basket, and
. leave the rest behind me. Also large deep baskets
- were my receivers for my corn, Which I always rub-
bed out as soon as it was dry, and cured; and'kept
it in great baskets instead of a granary. ;

I began now to perceive my powder abated consi-
derably; and this was a want which it was impossi-
ble for me to supply, and I began seriously to consider
what I must do when I should have no more powder;
that is to say, how I should do to kill any goats. I
had, as I observed, in the third year of my being here,
kept a youg kid, and bred her tame; I was in hepes
of getting an he kid, but I could not by any means
bring it to pass, till my kid grew an old goat; and I ,
could never find in my heart to kill her, till she died '
at last of mere age. ' - '
_ But being new, in the eleventh year .ofgmy 'x'e'si-.
"dence',"and_, as I have said, my ammunition growing
low, I set myself to study some art to trapand snare
the goats, to: see whether'l could not catch" Some of
them "alive; 'and partiCularly' I' wanted a she-goat
[great With young. - ' 3 ' , _ '--
'_ To'this' purpose I made-Snares to hamper them;
~- and believe they were more than once taken in them; ~
but my, tatskle was not good, for-I had no .wire,:and
alWayszfourid'fthem broken, and my bait devoured.
At length, I resolved to try a pitfall ;=. so I.dug se-
,veral "large ,'pitsjj in' the earth, in places where Igh'ad

could easily perceiVe,pthatithe goatshad gone in, and
eaten'fijp the,corn, that I could see the mark of their
feet ':"fat ' lengthiigl-Tset three traps in one night, ' and
going the. next,'in'orning, .I found them all standing,
and yet the .bait' eaten and gone. This was yery dis-
couraging; however,- '_.I altered my trap; and,"not to
trouble ,you with. particu1ars,' going one moming to
' see my traps, I found in one of. them a large old he-
goat; and in one-of- the other,1three kids, avrnale and
two females. '. , " ' .'_' ".1: ' a . = .
As to the: old one, I: knew not What to do with
him; he was so fierce I durst not 'go into the .pit to
him; that is to say, to go about to bring-him away
alive, which was. what I, wanted ;' ,I could have killed
him, but that was not my business, nor would it'anw
swer my end; so I e'en let him out, and he ran away
as if he had .beeu frighted out of his wits; but I did
net then know what I afterwards learnt, that hunger
would tame 'a lion: if I had let Him stay there three
Or four days without food, and the}, have carried him
some water to drink, and then a little corn, he would
have been as tame as one of thekids; for they are
mighty sagacious tractable creatures, where they are
well used. - -

' .
However, for the p1 esent I let him go, knowing no
better at that time; then I went to the three. kids ,
and, taking them one\by one, I tied them with strings
1ogether; and with some difficulty brought them all
{01116.1
. It was a. good while before they would feed; but

throwing them some s1v'eet corn it tempted them, and

they began to be tame: and now I found, that if I -
._'expected to supply myself with goats flesl1,fwhen.

had no powder or shot left, breeding some .up' tame
was my only. way, when perhaps I might have them
about my house like a flock of sheep. _ g '.'-.

But then it presently occurred to me, that I must
'keep the tame fiom the wild, or else they would al--

ways run wild when they grew up , and the" only.way, .

for this' was to' have some enclosed piece of ground,"
. well fenced either with hedge or pale, 'to keep them
up so effectually, that those 11 ithin might not b1eak
out, Or these without break 111. -. -.

This Was a great undertaking for one pair of hands;
yet as '__I saw there was an absolute necessity of domg
it, my first piece of Work was to find out a prOper
piece of ground, viz. where there 'was likely to be

erbage for them to eat, water for them to drink, and
cover to keep them from the sun. '

Those who understand such enclosures, will think
I had very little contrivance, when I pitched upon a
.pIaCe .very proPer for all theSe, being a plain Open
piece of meadow-land or. savana (as our people call
it in the western colonies) which had two or three
little drills of fresh water in it, and at one end was
1 very woody; I say they will smile at my forecast,
when I shall tell them I began by enclosing of this
piece of ground in such a manner, that my hedge or
pale must have been at least two miles about; nor was
the madness of it so great as to the compas; for if it
was ten miles about, bl was like to have time enough'
'to do it in, - but I did not consider, that my goats
11 ould be as wild 111 so much oompas, as if they had

l

1%
' -'had. the whole island -; and I should have so much .
roomto chase them in, that I should never catch-them.
~ My hedge was begun and carried .on,~ I"believe,
about fifty yards, when this thought occurred to me;
so' I preSently'stopped' short, and for the firSt begin-
tning I resolved to'enclose a piece of about one hun-
dred and fifty yards in length, and one hundred yards
' ' in breadth, Which. as it wc'mld maintain as many as I
'should'have in any reasonable time, so, as, my flock
=inCrea'sed,'I could add more ground to the enclosure.
' This, was'acting with some prudence, and I went to
Work with courage. I Was about three months hedg-
'- ing in the firstpiece ; and,.till I had done it, I tethered
. the three kids m the best part of .it, and used them to
feed. tasnear mafas possible, to make them familiar;
-andv'ei'yfoften I'w'ould go and carry them Some ears
oft'barley, or a'handfu'l of rice, and feed them out of
my hand; sothat after my. enclosure was finished,
and I, let them "lobsevthey would follow me up and
- down bleating after me for :a handful of com. '
This answered my>>'end, and inabout a year andfa
~ half-I had a flockgofabout' twelve goats, kids and all;
and in two years more-Ir had three-and-forty, besides
several that I took 'and-killed'fdr my- food; and after
that .I enclosed five several pieces. of grOund to 'feed.
- them-in," with, little-pens to drive them into, to take
them as- I wanted them _';1 and gates out (if one pieceof
ground into another. ' ~ ' - .- - ~ . . -
Butthis was not all .; for new I not only had goat's
flesh to feed on when I' pleased, but milk too-,a thing
which indeed in my beginning I did not so much as
think of, and which when it came into my thoughts,
' 'wasreally an agreeable surprise; for now I set up my
, dairy, and had sometimes a gallon Or two of milk in
a day. And as nature who gives supplies of food
to every creature, dictates even naturally how to make
use of it; so I, that never milked a cow much less-a
goat, or saw butter'or cheese made, very readily and
handily, though after a great many essays and miscar>>.

It would have made a stoic smile, to have seen me
and my little family sit down to dinner : there was
- my majesty, the prince and-lord, of the whole island;
, I had the livesof all my subjects at absolute'command;
:I could hang, draw, give life and liberty, and'take ' it

away, and no rebels among all my subject's.- - .- .f- -.
' ; Then to see how like 'a, king I dined too,'all alone,
attended by my servants! Pol, as if he had been my
favorite, as. the only person permitted to. talkvto me;
my dog, which was now grown very'old and'fcra'zy,
and found no s ec'ies to multiplyhis kind upon, sat al'
ways at my rig 1t hand ; and'twocats one on one side
the table, and one on the -other,~-expecting now and
then a bit from my hand. as email: of special" favour.
But these were not the two 'cats which I brought on
share at first; for they were both of them dead, and
had been interred near. my habitation. by my own
hands; but one of them having multiplied by I'know
not what kind of creature, these were two which" I 'p're- .
served tame, whereas the rest ran wild. into the woods,
and became indeed troublesome to m ,at last; for they
would often come into my house, an plunder me too,
till at last I was obliged to shoot them, and did kill a
great many; at length they left me. With this at.
tendance, andin this plentiful manner, I lived ; nei-
, ther could I be said to want any thing, but society and
of thlat, in some time after this, I was like to have too'
muc . . ,
I was something impatient, as I had observed, to' -
have the use of my boat, though very loath to run any
more hazard : and therefore sometimes I sat contriv-
ing Ways to get her about the island, and at other times .
I sat myself down contented enough without her. But '
_ I had a strange uneasiness in my mind to go down to
(the point of . the island, where, as I have said in niy
last ramble, ,Iwe'nt up the hill to see how the Shore
lay, and how the current set, that I might see what I
had to do. This inclination increased uponme every
day, and at length I resolved to travel thither by land,
and following the edge 'of the shore, I did so; buthad
any one in Englandbeen to meet sech a man as I was,
it must either have frighted them, or raised. a great
deal of laughter -; and 'as I frequently stood still to
look at myself, I 'could not but smile at the notion of
my traVelling through Yorkshire; with such an equi-
page, and in. such. a dress. Be pleased to take a
sketch of my figure as fOIIOWS :' _ - - '

I had a great high shapeless cap, made of goat's
skin, with a flap hanging down behind, as well to keep
the sun from me,'as to shoot the rain ofi' from run-
ning into my neck; nothing beingso hurtful in these
climates as the rain upon the flesh under the clothes.

I had a short jacket of goat's skin, the skirts coming
down to about the middle of mythighs; and a pair of
Openskneed breaches of the same ; the breeches were
made of a skin of an'old he gOat, whose hair hung
60th such alength on either side, that, like pants-
loons, it reached tothe middle of my legs. . Stockings
and shoes I had none ; but I had made me a pair of
something, I scarce knew what to call them, like bus-
kins, to flap over my legs, and lace on either side like
spatterdashes : but of a most barberous shape, as in-

, deed w'ereall the rest of my clothes.

I had on a broad belt of goat's skin dried, which I
drew togetherwith two thongs of the same, instead
of buckles; and in a kind of a frog on either side of
this, instead of a sword and dagger," hung a little saw
and a hatchet {one on one side, one on the other: I
had another belt not so broad, and fastened in the
same manner, which hung over my shoulder; and at
thecnd of it, under my left arm, hung two pouches,or 120731?va censors; 153

both made of goat'ssitms too; in one of which I hung
my powder, in the other my shot: at my back I car-
ried my basket, on myshoulder my gun, and over my
~ head a great clumsy ugly goat's skin umbrella; but
which, after all, was the most necessary thing I had
aboutme, next to my gun. As for my face, the ma
lour of it was really not so Mullatto-like as one might

xpect from a man not at all careful of it, and living
within nine or ten degrees of the equinox. My beard
I had once sofi'ered to grow till it was about a quan-
ter of a yard long; but as I had bath .scissars and '
razors sufficient, I had it out pretty short, except what
grew on my upper lip, which ,I had trimmed into a
large pair 'of ,Mahometan whiskers, such as I had-
seen worn by Some Turks whom I saw at Sallee; for.
the Moors did not wear such, though the Turks did ; to
these m ustachios, or whiskers, [will not say they were -
long enough to hang my hat upon them; but they
were of length and "shape monstrous enough, and such
as in England would" have passed "for frightful.

But all this is by the by ; for as to my figure, I had
so few to. observe me, that it was of no manner of -
consequence; so I say no more to that part. In this
kind of figure I went my new journey, and-wasfout
, five or six days. I travelled first along the sea-'SIiore,
directly to the place where I first brought my 'boat to
an anchor, to get up upon the rocks; and, having no
boat now to take care of, I went over the land a nearer
way, to the same height thatl was upon before; when
looking forward to the point of the rock which lay
out, and which I was to double with my boat, as I
said above, I was surprised to see the sea all smooth
and quiet; no rippling, no motion, no current, any
more-there than in other places.

'I was at a strange loss to understand this, and re.
solved to spend. some time in the observing of it, to
see if nothing from the sets of the tide had occasioned
it: but I was presently convinced how it was ;' viz. '
that the tide of ebb setting from the west, and joining

if . .. 2 ~

0
with' the current of watersfrom some great river on
the shore, must be the occasion of this current, and
that according as the wind blew m'ore'forcible from
the west, or from the north, this current came near,
or 'went farther from the shore; for, waiting there-
abduts till evening,.I went up to the rock again, and
then the tide of the ebb being made, I plainly saw the
current again as before, only that it ran farther ofi",
being near half a league from the shore; whereas, in
my case, it set close upon the shore, and hurried me
in my can'oe along with it, which at another time it
would not have done. , , , .

Thisobservation convineed me, that I had nothing
to do but observe the ebbing and the flowing of the
tide, and I might very easily bring my'boat about
the island again: but when I began to think of put-
ting it in practice, I had such a terror upon my spi>>
rits at the remembrance of the danger I had been in,
that I could not think of it again with any patience;
but on the contrary, I took up another resolution,
whiCh was more safe, though more laborious; and this
was, that I would build, or rather make me another '
pcriagua, or canoe; and so have one format: side of
the island, and one for the other.

Eon are to understand, that now I had, as I may
call it, two' plantations in the island; one my little.
forrification 0r tent, with the wall about it under the
rock, with'the cavebehind me, which by this 'time I
had enlarged into several apartments or caves, one.
within another. One of these, which was the driest
and largest, and had a door out beyond my wall or
fortification, that is to say, beyond where my wall
Loined to the rock, was all filled up with large earthen
pots, of which I have given an account, and with
'fourteen or fifteen great baskets, which would hold
five or six bushels each, where I laid up my stores of
provisron, especially my corn, some in the ear out
' off short from the straw, and the other rubbed out
with my hands. . ' . .

As for my wall, made as before, with long stake:
or piles, those piles grew alllike trees, and were by
this time grown so big, and s'preadso very much, that
there was not the least a pearance,-to any one's view,
of any habitation behin them. ' deg - '
N ear'this dwelling of mine, but a little farther with-
in the land, and upon lower ground, lay my two
pieces of ' corn-ground ; which I kept duly cultivated .
and sowed, and which duly yielded me their harvest
in. its season: and Whenever I had occasion for more
com, I had more land adjoining as fitas that. . .
' Besides this I had my country-seat, and I- had now
a tolerable plantation there also; for first, I had my
little bower, as I called it, which. I kept in- repair;
that is to say, I kept the hedge which circled it in con-
'stantly fitted up to its usual height, the ladder stand-
ing always in the inside; I kept the trees-which at
first were no more than- my stakes, but .were now
grown very ,fi 'm and tall; I kept them always so cut,
that they mig t spread and grow thick and-wild, and
make the more agreeable shad, which they did effec~
tually to my mind. " In the middle of this I had my
tent always standing, being a piece of a sail spread
over poles set up for that purpose, and which never
wanted any repair or renewing; and under this I had
made me 'a squab or couch, with the skins of the
creatures I had killed, and with other soft things, :and
a blanket laid'on them, such as belonged to our sea-
bedding, which I had saved, and aigreat watch-coat
to cover me; and here, whenever! had occasion to
be absent from my chief seat, I took up my county
habitation. ' ' ~ '
' Adjoining to this I had my enclosures for my cattle,
this is to say, my goats: and as I had taken an in-
conceivable deal of pains to fence and enclose this
ground, I'was so uneasy to see it kept entire, lest the
goats should break through, that I" never left off, till
with infinite labour I had stuck the outside of the hedge
so full of small stakes, .and so near to one another,
that it was rather a pale than a hedge, and there was
scare room to put a hand through between them,which. afterwards, when those 'stak'es grew, as they
all did in the next rainy season, made the enclosure
. strong, like a wall, indeed stronger than any wall.
This will testify for me that I was not idle,"and
that I spared no pains to bring to pass whatever ap-
peared necessary for my comfortable support; for I
considered the keeping up a breedof tame creatures
has at my hand, w'ould b'e'a living magazine of flesh,
milk, butter, and; cheese, for me as long as I lived
in the place, if it were to be'forty'years; and that
keeping them'in" my reach, depended entirely upon
my perfecting my enclosures to such a degree, that I
might be sure of keeping them together; which by
this method indeed I so efi'ectually secured, that when
these littlestakes began to grow, .1 had planted them
so very. thick, I was forced to pull some of ' them up
a in. . ' - ' ' e '
g2Iln this place also I had my grapes grownig, which
I principally depended on for my winter store of '
- raisins, 'and which I never failed to preserve veryr
carefully. as' the, best and most agreeable dainty of .
my whole diet; andindeed they were not agreeable
only, but physical, wholesome, nourishing, and re-~_
freshingto the last degree. , .

As this was also about 'half way~between my other
habitation and the place where 'I had laid l1]!~)'.ty'l)0at,
I generally'staid and lay here in my way thither; for

' I used frequently to 'visit my boat,- and I kept all
things about or belonging to herein very good" order: .
sometimes I went out in her to divert myself, but no -
more hazardous voyages would I go, nor scarce ever
above a stone's cast or two from the shore, I was so.
apprehensive of being hurried out of my knowledge
again by the currents, or.winds, or any other acci
dent. But now I come to a new scene of my life. ..
. It happened one day about noon, going towards
my boat, I was exceedingly surprised with the print
of a man's naked foot on the shore, which was very -
plain to be seen in the sand : I stood like one thunder-
struck, or as if Iliad-seen an apparatiou; I listened,
I looked roimd me, I could hear nothing, nor see any
thing; I'went up to a rising ground to look farther :
I went up the shore, and down the share, but it Was
all one, I could see no other impression but that one;
. I went.' to it again to see if there were any more, and
- to observe'if it might not be my fancy ; but there was
no room for that, for there 'was exacdy the very print
' of a foot, toes, heel, and every part of foot ; how it
came thither I'knew'not, norcouldin the least ima- .
gine. _ But after innumerable fluttering thoughts, like
a man perfectly Confued, and out of myself, I came
home to my mortification, not feeling, as we say, the
ground I Went Oh, but terrified to thelast degree,
looking behind me at every two or three steps, mis-
taking every bu'sh and tree,' and fancying eVery stump
at a distance to be a man; ' nor is it poesible ,to de-
'scribe how many various shapes an affrighted imagi'
nation represented. things to me in ;.how many wild
- ideas were formed every moment in my fancy, and
what strange unaccountable whims'i'es came into in
thoughts by thenway. . '
When I came to my castle,for so I think I called
' it ever after this, I fled into it like one pursued; whe-
ther I went over by the ladder, as first Contrived, or
went mat the hole in the rock, which I called a door,
I cannot remember ; for never frighted hare fled to
cover, or fox .to'earth,' with more terror of mind than
I to this retreat. * ' ~ '
Had no sleepthat night; the farther I was from
the occasion Of my fright the greater my-apprehen-
sions were; which is something contrary to the nature
- of such things, and especially to the usual practice of
all creatures in fear. ButI was so embarraSsed with
my own frightful ideas of the thing, that I. formed
nothing but dismal imaginations to myselfieven'though
I was now a great way off it. Sometimes I fancied
it must be the devil ; and reason joined in with me
upon this suppositipn. For how should any other
thing in human shape come into the place? Where was
the vessel that'brought them? What marks were there

' .
of any other footste 3? And how was it possible a man
should come there? ut'thenito think'thatSatan should
' take human shape upon him in such a- place. where
there could be no manner of occasion for it,- but to
leave the print of his foot behind him, and that even'
for no purpose too (for he could not be sure I should
see it 3 this was an amazement thetother way; Icon
sidere that the devil might have found out abundanc
' of other ways to have terrified me, than this of th
single print of a foot; that as I lived quite on the oth ,
or side of the island, he would never have been so Sim-
ple to leave a mark; in a place where it was ten thou-
sand. to one whether I should ever see it or not, and in"
the sand too, which the first surge of the sea upon an
high Wind would have defaced entirely. All this
seemed inconsiStent with the thing itself, and with all
nations we usually entertain of the subtlety of the devil. ~
- Abundance of "such things as these assisted to argue
,me out of all apprehensions of its being the devil.'
And I presently concluded that it musthe some more
dangerous creat'ure ; viz; that it must be some of the
savages of the main land over against me,gwho'had
wandered out to sea in their canoes,'and, either drivo >>
en by the currents, or by contrary winds, had made
the island, and had been on shore, but were gone away '
again to sea, being as loath,'perhaps, to have staid in
this desolateislaud, as I would have been to have
had them. , .4
While these reflections were rolling upon my min 8,
~ I was very thankful in my thought, that -I was so
happy as not to be thereabouts at that time, or. that
they did not see my boat, by which they would have
concluded, that some inhabitants had been in- the
place, and ' perhaps have. searched farther for me
I'hen terrible thoughts racked myimaginations abou
their having found my boat, and that there were peo
' ple here; and if so, I should certainly have them
come again in great numbers, and devour me; that '
if it should hap en so that they should- not find me.
yet they would nd my enclosure, destroy all my corn,
carry away all my flock of tame goats and [should
perish at last for were want. . - '
Thus my fear banished all my religious hope; all
that former confidence in God, which was founded
upon such wonderful experience as I had had of his
goodness, now vanished; as if he that hadfed me by
miracle hitherto, could not preserve by his power the
' provision which he had made for me by his goodness,
. . Q rcproached myself with my uneasiness, that I would
not sow anymore" corn one year, than would just
serve me till the next season, as if no; accident could
intervene to prevent my enjoying the crop that was
upon. the ground. And this I thought so just a re-
'pmof, that I resolved for the future to have two or
ca three years corn beforehand, So that, whatevermight
come; I might not perishforwant of bread. .
How strangea chequer-work of Providence-is the
life of man! And by what secret differing springs are
the afi'ections hurried about, as differing circ urnstauces
present 5 To-day we love 'what tomorrow we hate;
to-day we seek what to-morrow we shun; to-day we
>> desire what tomorrow we fear; nay, even tremble at
the apprehensions of. This was exemplified in me
at this time in the most lively manner imaginable ; for
1', whose only affliction was, that I seemed banished
fromhumari society, that I was alone, circumscribed
by the boundless ocean, cutoff from mankind, and
condemned to what I call a silent life; that I was as
one whom Heaven thought not worthy to be number-
ed among the living, or to appear among the ,rest of
his creatures; that to have seen one of my own Spe-
cies," would have seemed to me a raising me from
death to life, and the greatest blessing that Heaven it-
self, next to the supreme blessing of salvation,; could
bestow; I say, that I should now tremble at" the very
apprehensions of seeing a man, and was ready to 5111!:
into the ground, at but the shadow, or silent appear-
ance of a man's having set his foot on the islsnd.
Such is the uneven state of human life; and; it af-
forded me a great many curious speculations after-
wards, 'when I' had a little recovered my first sur-
prise: I considered that this was the Station of. life
the infinitely wise and good rovidence of God had '
. ' determined for me 2 that as could not foresee what _
' the ends of divine wisdom might be in all this, so :1
was not to dispute his sovereignty, v'vho, as I was his
creature had an undoubted right by creationto govern .
.and dispose of me absolutely as he thought fit; and
who, as LWas a creature'who ha'd ofi'ended him, had" _'
likewise a judicial right to condemn me to what pup. .
ishment he thought fit; and that it was my part to.
' submit to hear his indignation, because I had sinned
against him; ' ' . ' t ' . a I .-
I then reflected,'that God who was not only right-"' -
. 'eous, but omnipotent, as he had thought fitjthus'to6
punish and afl'lictgme, so he was able "to deliver -me';.-deg
that if he did notithi'iik fit'to do it, it was my unques-
tioned duty>to resign myself absolutely and entirely
to his will ; and on the other hand, it was my duty
also to hope in him, pray to him, and quietly toatteud
the dictates and directions of his daily providence. -
These thoughts took me up many hours, days, nay;
I may say, weeks and months; and. one particular --
effect of my cOgitation's on this occasion 'I cannot
omit; viz. one morning early, lying in my .bed, and-
iilled with thoughts about my danger from the appear-- '
an'Ce of saVages, I found it discomposed me. very _
.much; u on which those words of the Scripture came .
' into my _ ought, " Call upon me in the day of trau-
blc,"ahd I will deliver thee, and thou shalthg'ldrit'z
me.- ' ' ". " '
. Upon this, rising cheerfully out of my bed, my
heart was not only comforted, hot I was guidedzand
. encouraged to pray earnestly to Godfor'deliverance.
"Then I had done praying, I took u myBible, and
Opening it to read, the first words that presented to
me were, " Wait on the Lord, and be of good cheer,
and he shall strengthen thy heart : Wait, I say, on
the Lord." It is impossible to express the comfort '
this gave me ;- and in return, I thankfully laid down
the'boo'k, and was no moiesad, at least, not on that _
occasion. ' . - ~ . '
In the middle of these cogitations, apprehensions,
and reflections, it came into my thoughtsone day, that- '
all this might be a mere chimera of my own, and that
this .foot'might be the print of my "own foot, when I
came on shore from my boat.' This cheered me up a
little too, and I began to persuade myself it was all a
delusion; that it was nothing-else but my oWn' foot; .
and why might not I. come that way from 'the boat, as
well ' as I 'was going that way to the boat? Again, I
considered also, that I could by- no means tell for per:
' tain where I had trod, and where I had not; and that
if at 'last this was only the print of my own foot, I
had played the part of tho.se.fools,.who strive to" make
stories of spectres and apparations, and then are them
selves frighted at them more than any body else. .
_ Now' I began to take courage; and to peep abroad
again ; for I had not stirred outof my castle for. three
days and nights, 50 that I began" to starve for provi-
sion ;, for I had little or nothing within doors, but
- some barley cakes and water. Then I knew that my
goats wanted -to be milked too, which usually was
my evening diversion: and the poor creatures were in
great pain and'inconvenience for want o'fit; and in--
deed .it almost spoiled some of them, and almost
dried up their milk. . ' .
Heartening myself thereforewith the belief, that
this was nothing. but the print of one of my own feet
(and so I might be truly said to startiat my own sha-
dow,) I, began to go abroad again, and went to my
country-houseto milk my flock: but to seetw'ith what
fear [went forward, 'how often I looked behind .me,
how I was ready, every now-and then, to lay down
. my basket, and-run for mytlife; it would have made
any onehave thought I was haunted with an evil
. conscience, or that I had been lately most terribly
frighted; and so indeed Ihad. . - -
However, as l went down thus two or. three days,
. and having seen nothing. I began 'to be a little bolder
and to think there was really nothingin it but my
own imagination; but I could not persuade myself ,
fully of this, till I should goldown to the shore again,
and see this print of a foot, and measure it by my
own, and see if there was any similitude or. fitness,
that- I might be assured it was my OWn foot.- But
when I came to the place first, it appeared evidently
to me,that when I laid up my boat, I could not pos-
sibly he on shore any where' thereabouts. Secondly,
when I came to measure the mark with my own foot,
I found my foot not so large by a great deal. Both
_ these things filled my head 'with new imaginations,
and gave me the vapours again to the highest degree;
so that I shook with cold, like one in an ague, and I
went home again, filled with the belief. that some
man or men had been on shore there; or, in short,
that the__ island was inhabited, and I might be sur-.
prised before I Was aware; and what course to take
for my security, I knew'not. '.

0 what ridiculous resolutions men take, when pos-
sessed with fear! It de rives them of the use of those
means ,whiCh reason 0 ers for their relief. The first
thing .I proposed to myself was, to throw down my
enclosures, and turn all my tame cattle wild into
the woods, that the enemy might not find them, and
then frequent the island in prospect of the same, or
the like booty; then to the simple thing of digging up
my two corn-fields, that they might not find such a
grain there, and still to be prompted to frequentthc
island; then to. demolish my . bower and tent, that
they might not see any vestiges of my habitation, and
be prompted to look farther, in order to find out the
persons inhabiting.- '

These were the subjects of the first night's cogita-
tation, afterI was come home again, while the appre-
hensions which had so over-run my mind were fresh
u on me, and my head was full of vapours, as above.

hus fearpf danger is ten thousand times more terrify-
ing than danger itself, when apparent to the eyes 3-
and we find the burden of anxiety greater by much
than the evil which we are anxious about; but, which _
was worse than all this, I' had not that relief in this
trouble from the resignation I-nsed to practise, that I ,
hoped to have. I looked, ,l thought, like Saul, who
complained not only that the Philisfiines were upon
him,>> but that God haddegforsaken him; for I did not
now take due ways to compose my mind, by crying to
God in my distress, and resting upon his providence,
as I had done before, for my "defence and deliver-
ance; which if I had done, I had, at least, been more
cheerfully supported under this new surprise, and
. perhaps carried through it with more resolution.

This confusion of my thoughts kept me waking all
night; but in the morningl fell asleep, and having
by the- amusement of my mind been, as it were, tired,
and my spirits exhausted, I slept very SOundly, and
awaked much better composed than I had ever been
before. And new I began to think setlately; and,_
upon the utmost debate with myself, I concluded, that
this island, which was so exceeding pleasant, fruitful,
and no farther from the mainland than asl had seen,
was not so entirely abandoned as I might imagine,
that although there were no stated inhabitants Who'
lived on the spot; yeLthat there might sometimes
come boats oil~ from the shore, whoeither with de-
sign, or perhaps never but when they were driven
by cross winds,'might come'to this place.

That I had lived here fifteen years now, and had not
, met with the least shadow or figure of any people be-
fore; and that if at any time they should be driven.
here, it was probable they went away again as soon
as ever they could, seeing they had never thought fit
to fix there upon any occasion, to this time. , '

That the most I could suggest any danger from,
was from any such casual accidental landing of
straggling people from the main, 1th, as- it ' was
likely, if they were driven hither, were"here against
their wills: so they made no stay here, but went off
again with all possible speed, seldom staying one
night on shore, "lest they should not have the help of
the tides and day light back again; and that there.
fore I had nothing, to do but to consider of some safe
retreat, in case i should see any savages land upon
the spot. _ . . j '

Now I began sorely to repent that I had dug my
cave so large, as to bring a door through again, which
door, as I said, came out beydnd where my fortifica-
tion . joined to the rock. Upon maturely considering
this, therefore, i resolved to 'draw me a second fortia
.fication, in the manner of a semicircle, at'a distance
from my wall, just where I had planted a double row
of trees about twelve years before, of which I made
mention: these trees having been planted so thick
before, there wanted but a few piles to be driven be-
tween them, that they should be thicker and stronger,
and my wall would be soon finished. .

So that i had now a double wall, and my outer
' Wall was thickened with pieces of timber, old cables,
and every thing 1 could think of to make it strong;
having in it seven little. holes, about as big as I might
put my arm out at. In the inside of thisl thieke..r.\rl
r my wall to about :eir.feet. thick, continuallybringing
earth out of my cave, and laying it at the foot of the
wall,. and walking upon it; and through the seven
holes I-contrived to plant the muskets, of which I'
took notice that I got seven on shore out of the ship;
'these, I say, I planted Ill-Le my cannon, and fitted
them into frames that held them like 'a carriage, that
. so IcOuld fire all the seven guns in two minutes time.
This wall l was. many a weary month in finishing,
. and yet never thought myself safe till it was done.

When this was done,~l stuck all the ground without
my wall, fer a great way every way,has full with
stakes or sticks of the osier-like wood, which I found
so apt to grow, as they could well stand; insomuch
that I believe I might set in near twenty thousand of
them, leaving a pretty large space .betweee themand
my wall, that I might have room to see an enemy,
and they might have no shelter from the young trees,
if they attempted to approach my outer wall.

Thus in two years time I had a thick grove; and in
five or six years time I had a wood before my dwel.
ling, grown so monstrous thick and strong that it was
indeed perfectly impassable ; and me man of what
kind soever Would ever imagine that there was any
thing beyond it, much less an habitation : as for the
way I propOsed myself to go in and out (for I left no
avenue), it was by setting two ladders; one to a part
of the rock which was low, and then broke in, and ~
left room to place another ladder upon that; so when
the two ladders were taken down, no man living could
come down to me without mischiefing himself; and if
they' had come down, they. were still on the Outside
of my outer wall. - -

Thus I took all the measures human prudence could
suggest for my own preservation; and it will be seen
at length, that they were not altdgether without just
reason ; though I foresaw nothingat that time more
than my mere fear suavested. . ' .

While this was doing, I was not altogether careless
of my other alfairs ; for I had "a great concern upon
me for my little herd of goats ; they were not only a
present supply to me upon every occasion, and began
to be suflicient for me, without the expense of powder
and shot, but also abated the fatigue of my hunting
after the wild ones; and I was loath to loose the ad-
vantage of them, and to have them all to nurse up
over again. _ _' '

To this purpose, after longeonsideration, I could

_ think but of two ways to preserve them, one was to
, find another convenient place to dig a cave under
ground, and to drive them into it every night; and _,
the other was to enclose two 'or three little bits of
land, remote from one another, and, as much con-
cealed asI could, Where I might keep about half a
dozen young goats in each place, ; so that if any dis.
aster happened to the flock in general,I might be ableto raise them again with little trouble and time : a'ndf
this, though it would require a great deal 'of time and
labour, I thought was the "most rational design. . -
* ' Accordingly I spent some time, to-find out the
most retired parts of the island ;','.andLI pitched upon
one which was as private indeed as my heart could
wish ;-for it was a little damp piece of ground in the
middle of the hollow and thidk woods, where, as, i
observed, I almostlost myself once before, endeav
ouring to come back that way from the eastern part
of the island: here I found a Clear piece of land near
. three acres, so surounded With woods, "that it was
almost an enclosure by nature; at least it did not
want near so much labour to make it 'so, as the other
pieces of ground I had worked so hard at. ,' _ " '
I immediately went to work with this piece. of

ground, and in less than a month's time I had' so
fenced it round, that my flock or herd, call it which
you please, which were not so wild now as at first"
. they might be supposed to be, were well enough
secured in it>> So withoutany farther delay, I re-
moved ten she--goats, and two he-g'oats to this piece;
and when. there, I continued to perfect the fence, till
I had made it as secure as the other, which, however,
I did at more leisure, and it took me up more time
by a great deal. , . _ j

' All this labour I was at the expense of, purely
from my apprehensions on account of the print of
a man's foot which I had seen ; for as yet, I never
saw any human creature come'near'the-island, and
I had now lived two years under these "uneasinesses,
whichin'deed made my life much less comfortable
than, it was before; as may well be imagined,_ by any
who know what it is to live in the consant snare of ,_
the fear of man; and this I must observe with grief '
too, that the discomposure of 'my mind had too-
great impressions also Upon the religious part of my _ ,
thoughts; for the dread and terror of falling into the
hands of savages and cannibalslayso upon my spirits,
that I seldom found myself in a due temper for ap' plication to my" Maker ; at leastnot, with the sedate
jcalmncss and resignation of soul which I was Wont to
do. I-rather prayed to God as under great affliction
and pressure of mind, surrounded withdanger, and in
expectation every night of'being murdered and de-
Noured before the morning; and I must testify from
my experience, that a temper of peace, thankfulness,'
glove, and affection, is much more the preper frame
for prayer'than- that'offte'rrOr and discomposure; and
that under the dread of mischief impending, a man is
no: more fit for a comforting performance of the duty
ofgraying to,God, then he is for repentance on 3. Sid: -
be ;_for these diScomposures affect the mind as the
others do the body; and the discomposure .of the
mind must necessarily be as great a disability as that ;
of the body, and much greater; praying to God be'ing
pr0per1y an act of the' mind, not of the body.

But to go on : after I had thus Secured One part of
my little living stock,\I went" about the, whole island, '
searching for another private place, to ' make such .
another deposit; when wandering more to the west
' oint of the island than I had ever done yet, and

coking out to sea, 'I thought I saw a boat upon the
sea at a great distance ; I had found a perspective
glassor two in one of the seamen's chests, which I-
saved out of our ship; but I had it not about me, and
this was so remote, that I could not tell what to make
of it, though! looked at it 'till my eyes were net able
to look, any longer : whether it was a boat or not, I '
do riot know ;. but as I descended :'from the hill, I
could .se'e no more of it, so I , gave it'f'civer ; only I
resolved to go in more-without a perspective glass in
my pocket. . -

When I was 'come down the hill, to the endof-the
island, where indeed I had never he'en'before, I't'vas
presently convinced, that the seeing the print of a

, man's foot, was not such a strange thing in the island
'" as I imagined; and, but that it was a'jspecialprovi-
t'dence that I was cast upon the'side of the island where
the savages never came, I should easily have known '
that nothing was more frequent than for the canoes
from the main, when they happened to be a little too
far out 'at sea, to shoot over to that side of the island.
for harbour ; likewise, as they often met, and fought
in their canoes, the victors, having taken any prison--
ers, would bring them over to this shore, where, ac-
cording to their dreadful customs, being all cannibals
they would kill and eat them: of which hereafter.
When I was come down the hill to the shore, as . A
said above, being the S. W. point of the island, I wa
pefectly confounded and amazed; nor is it possible
for me to exgiress the. horror of my mind at seeing the
shore sprea with skulls, hands, feet, and other bones
of human bodies; and particularlyl observed a place
' where there had been a fire made, and a circle dug in
the earth, like a cock-pit, where it is supposed the
savage wretches had sat down'to their inhuman feast-
ings upon the bodies of their fellow-creatures.

I was so astonished with the sight of these things,
that I entertained no notions of any danger to myself
from it, for along while; all my apprehensions were
buried in the thoughts of such a pitch of inhuman,
hellish brutality, and the horror of the degeneracy of '
human nuture'; which, though I had heard 'of often,

-yet I never had sonea-r a view_of before : in short, I
turned away my face from the horrid spectacle ; my
stomach grew sick, and I was just at the point of
fainting, when nature discharged the disorder from
my stomach,and,~having veniited with'an uncommon
violence, I was a little relieved, but could not bear to
stay in the-place 'a- moment ; so I got me up the hill
again with all the speed I could, and walked on to.

. wards my own habitation. '

' When I came a little out of that part of the island

stood still a while as amazed ; and then recovering
myself, I looked up with the utmost affection of my
soul, and, with a flood of tears. in my eyes, gave

God thanks, that had cast myfirst lot in a part ofthe'
world where l was distinguished from such dreadful
creatures as these ; and that though I had esteemed
r

O

, my present condition very miserable, had yet given
me so many comforts in it, that I had still more to
give thanks for than to complain of; and this above
all, that Lhad, even in this miserable condition, been
comforted with the knowledge of himself, and the
hope of his blessing, which was a'felicity more than
sutliciently equivalent to all the misery which I had
suffered, or could suffer. ' " ' .

>> In this frame of thankfulness I went home to my
castle, and began to be much easier now, as to the.
safety of my circumstances, than ever I was before;
for I observed, that these wretches never came to this
island in search of what they could get; perhaps not
seeking, not wanting, or not expecting, any thing
here, and having .often, no doubt, been up in the cos
vered woody part of it, without finding any thing to
their purpose. I knew I had been here now almost
eighteen years, and I never-saw the least footsteps of
a human creature there before; and might be here
eighteen more as entirely concealed as I was now, if,
I did not discover myself to' them,"whichI had no-
mannercf occasion todo, it being my only business
to. keep myselfentirel y concealed where I was, unless
I found a better sort of creatures than cannibals to.
make myself known to. -

' Yet l entertained such an abhorrence of the savage
Wretches that! have been speaking 'of, and of the
wretched inhuman custom of their ,devOuring- and eat-
ing one another up, that Icontinued pensive and sad,
and kept closeurithin my own circle for almost two
years after this: when I say my own circle,_- I mean
by it my three plantations, win my castle, my mum
try-seat, which I called my bower, and my encloSure
in the woods; nor did I look after this for any other
use than as an enclosure for my goats; for the aversibn
which. nature gave me to these hellish wretche's was
such, that I was as fearful of seeing them as of seeing -

- the devil himself; nor did I so much as go to loolt
after mv boat in all this time, but 'hega'n rather to

W 'L. r, l? . l' 76 7 -. LIFE AND .hn'vnNTUBEs

think of making me another; for I could not think of
ever making any more attempts to bring the other
boat round the island to me, lest I should meet with
some. of those creatures at sea, in which, if Ihad
happened to have fallen into their hands, I knew
what would have been my lot.

Time, however, and the satisfaction I had, that
was in no danger of being discovered by these people
began to w'ear off my uneasiness about them; and
began to live just in the same composed manner a
before; only with this difference, that I used more
caution, and kept my eyes mere about me' than I did
before, lest I should happen to be seen by any of them;
and particularly, .1 was more cautious of firing my
gun leSt any of them on the island should happen to
hear it; and it was therefore a very good provio
dence to 'me, that I had furnished myself with a tame
breed of goats, that I had no need to hunt any more
about the woods, or shoot at them; and if I did catch '
any more of them after this, it was by traps and
snares, as I had done before; so that for two years
after this, I believe I never fired my gun .oncoofi',
though I never went out without it; and, which was
more, as I had saved three pistols out of the ship, I
always carried them out with me, or at least two of
them, sticking them in my goatskin belt: I likewise
furbished up one of the great cutlasses that I had out
of the ship, and'mademe a belt to put it in also; so
that I Was now a most formidable fellow to look at
when I went abroad, if you add to the former descrip-
tion of myself, the particular of two pistols, and a
great broadsword, hanging. at my side ina belt, but
without a scabbard.

Things going on thus, as I have said, for some
time, I seemed, excepting these'cautions, to be re.
duced to my former. calm sedate way of living. All
these things tended to shew me more and more how
far my condition was from being miserable, compared
to 'some others; nay, to many other particulars of life,
which it might have pleased God to have made my
lot. It put me upon reflecting, how- little repimng
there would be among mankind, at any condition of!
life, if peeple would rather compare their condition
withthose that are. worse, in order to be thankful,
than be always comparing them with those which are
better, to assist their murmurings and complainings.
As in my present condition there were not really
many things which I wanted, so indeed I thought that
the frights I had been in-about these savage wretches,
and the concern I had been in for, my own preservao
tion, had taken off the edge of my invention for. my
own conveniences, and I had dr0pped a good design,
which I had once bent my thoughts upon; and that
was, to-try if I could not make some of my barley
into malt, and then try to brew myself some beer:
' this was really a whimsical thought, and I - reproyed
myself often" for the simplicity of it, for I presently
saw there would be the want of Several things neces-
_ sary to the making my beer, that it would be impos-
sible, for me to supply; as, first, casks to preserve it
in, which was a thing that, as I have observed already,
I could neven compass; no, though I spent not many
days, but weeks, nay months, in attempting it, but to

'no purpose. In the next place, I. had no hops to '

make it keep, no yeast to make it work, no copper or
kettle to make it boil; and yet, had not all these things
intervened, I mean the frightsand terrors I was in
' about the savages, I had undertaken it, and perhaps
brought it to pass too ; for I seldom gave any thing

over without-accomplishing it, when I once had it in -

my head enough to begin i . _

, But my invention now ran quite another away; for
night and day [could think of nothing, but how I
might destroy some of these monsters in their'cruel
bloodyentertainment, and, if possible, save the victim
they should bring hither to destroy.- It would take up
a larger volume than this whole work is intended to
be, to set down all the contrivances I hatched, or
rather brooded upon in my thoughs, for the destroyo
ing these creatures or at least fri htening them, so no
. " to prevent their coming hither any more; but all was
abOrtive; nothing could be possible to take effect un. .
. less I_..Was to bethere to do.it myself; and what could
one man do among them, when perhaps there might
be twenty or thirty of them together, with their darts,
or their bows and arrows-,, with which they could
shoot as true to a mark as I could with my gun ?
Sometimes I contrived to dig arhole under the place
.where- they, made their fire, and put in five or six
pounds of gunpowder, which, when they kindled thei
fire,' would consequently take fire, and blowxup all
_that,was near it; but, as in the first place I should be ,.
' very loath to waste so much powder upon them, my
fstore being now within the quantity (if. a barrel, so-
neither could I [be sure of its going off at any. certain
time, when it might surprize them ; and, at best, that
it. would do little more than just blow the firegabout
- their ears and frightthem, but not sufficient to make
, them forsake the place ; so I laid it aside, a'nd'then
"proposed, that I would place myself in ambush in

' some weeks, and I was so full of it that I often dream-

; '_Welll, at .ength I found a 'place in the side of the
hill, where I was satisfied I might securely wait till I
saw' any of the boats coming, and might then, even
before they tvolild be ready to come on shore, convey
myself unseen into thicketsr'of tree's, in one of which
there was an [idllow large enough to conceal me en-
, tirely; and where I might sit, and observe all their
bloody doings, and take my full aim at their heads,
tvhen'they were so close together, as that it would be
next to impossible that I should. miss my shoot, or
that I could fail wounding three or four of them at the
firSt shoot. ' a ' ' .
. In this plac'e then I resolved to fix my design gland
accordingly I prepared tivomuskets andm ordinary

. ' fotvling-piece. The two muskets I l'oac ed with a

brace' of slugs each, and four or five smaller bullets,
about the size of pistol-bullets, and the fowling-piece '
{loaded with near an handful of swan-shot of the
largest size ; I also loaded my pistols with about four.
bullets each : and in this ,posture, well provided with '
ammunition for a second and third charge, I prepared '
mysdffor my expedition. . _, 4

_ _ After I had thus'laid the scheme for my design,
and'in my imagination put it in practice, Icontinul ,
ally made my tour every morning up to the top of the
hill, which was from my castle, as I called it, about
threevmiles or more,. to see if I could observe any
boats' upon the sea, coming near the island, or stand-
ing over towards it ; but I began to tire of , this hard
duty, after I had 'for two or three months constantly
kept my watch ; but came always back without any
discovery, there having not inall that time been the
least appearance, not only On or. near the shore, but
not on the whole ocean, so far as my eyes or glasses
could reach every Way. _ . ..

As long as I kept up my daily tour to the hill to
look outiso long also i kept up the vigour of my.de-
sign, an" my spirits seemed to be all the while in a
suitable tame for so outrageous an execution, as the
hiiimg twenty or thirty naked savages for an offence,
which I had not at all entered into a discussion of in
my thoughts,.any further than my passions were at
first fired by the horror I conceived at the unnatural
custom of the maple of that country, who, it seems,
had been suffered by Providence, in his wise disposi-
tion of the wo'ld, to have no other guide than that of
their own abominable and vitiated passions; and 'con<<
sequently were left, and perhaps had been for some
ages, to act such horrid things and receive such dread-
ful customs, as nothing but nature entirely abandoned -
of Heaven, and'actuate'd by some hellishdegeneracy,
could have run them into ; but now, when, as I have
said, I began to be weary of the fruitless excursion
which I had made so long, and so far, every morning '
in vain ; so my opinion of the action itself began to
alter, and I began, with cooler and calmer thoughts,
to consider what it was I was going to engage in;
what authority or call I had to pretend to he judge
and exechtioner upon these men as Criminals, whom

. Heaven had thought fit for so many ages to suffer, uno .
punished, to go on, and to be, as it were, the execu-
tioners of his judgments upon one another; also, how
far these people were offenders again'St me, and what
right I had to engage in the quarrel of that blood,
which they shed promiscuously one txpon'anotherr I
debated this Very often with myself thus : How do I
know what God himself judges in this particular case ? .
It is certain these people do not Commit this as a -
crime; it is not against their own consciences reprov-"
ing, or their light reproaching them. They' do not
know it to be an offence, and then commit it in defi-
ance of divine justice as we do in'almost all the sins
~we commit. They think it no more a crime to kill a
captive'taken in war, than we do to kill an ox ;' nor
to eat human flesh, than we do to eat mutton.

When, I. considered this a little, it followed ne-
cessarily, that I was certainly in the wrong in it; that
these pe0p1e' were not murderers in the sense that I
had before condemned them in my thoughts, any more
than those Christians were murderers, who often putto death the prisoners taken in battle; or more fre.
quently, Upon many occasions, put whole troops of
men to the sword, without giving quarter, though they
threw down their arms and submitted. ' g

In the next place, it occurred to me, that albeit the
'usage they gave one another was thus brutish and in.
human, yet it was really nothing to me; thesepeople
had-done me no injury .- that if they attempted me,
'or I saw it necessary for my'immediate preservation
~ _ 0. fall upon them, something might be said for it; but
hat I was yet out of their power, and they had really
no knowledge of me, and consequently no design
upon me; and therefore it could not be just for me
to fall upon them ' that this would justify the conduct
of the Spaniards, in all their barbaritics practised .in
_ America, where they destroyed millions of ,these
people, who however they were idolator's and bar-
rians, and had several bloody and barbarous rites in
- these customs, such as sacrificing human bodies to
their idols, were yet, as to the Spaniards very inno-
cent people: and that the rooting them out of the coun-
try is spoken of with the utmost abhorrence and detes-
tation, even by the Spaniards themselves, at this time,.
and by all other Christian nations of EurOpe, as a
.mere butchery, a bloody and unnatural piece of cru-
elty, unjustifiable either to God or man : and such, as
for which the very name of a Spaniard is reckoned to
be frightful and terrible to all pe0ple of humanity, or

' . of Christian compassion; as if the kingdom of Spain

were particularly eminent for the product of a race of
men, who were without principles of tenderness, or
the common bowels of pity to the miserable, which is
recltpned to be a mark of 'a generous temper in the
mm . , A '

These considerations really put me to a pause, and
to a kind of a full stop; and Ibegan by little and little
to be off of my design, and to conclude I had taken a
wrongmeasure in my resolution to attack the savages;
that it was not my business to meddle with them, un-z
less they first attacked me', and this it was my.busi-
ness, if possible, to prevent; but that if 1 were disco-
vered "and attacked, then I knew my duty.
0n the "other hand, I argued with myself that.this
really was the way not to deliver myself, bin entirely
'to ruin and destroy myself ;. for unless I was sure to
kill every one that not only should be on shore at that
time, but that shouldever come on shore afterwards,
if but one of them escaped to tell their cauntry people
what had happened, they'Would come over again by
' thousands to revenge the death of their fellows; and I
should only bring upon myself a certain destruction,
which 'at present I had no manner of occasion for.
Upon the whole, I concluded, that neither in prin- .
ciples nor in policy, I ought one way or other to con-
cern myself in this affair : that my business was by-
all possible means to conceal myself from them, and
- not to leave the least signal to them to guess by, that
there were any living creatures upon the island, I '
mean of humnn shape. , '

Religion joined in with this prudential, and I was
Convinced now many ways thatI was perfectly Out of
my duty when I was laying all my bloody schemes
for the .destruction,of innocent creatures I mean in-
nocent as to me ; as to the crime they were guilty of
towards one another, I hadnothing to do with them ;
they were nationalpunishments to make a Just retri-
bution for national offences; and to bring public judg-
Tmen'ts upon those who offendin a public manner, by
such ways as best please God. ' -

This appeared so clear to me now, that nothing Was
a greater satisfaction to 'me,' than that I had not been
suffered tO'dO a thing which I now saw so much rea-
son jto'be'lieve would have'heen no less a sin than that
'o'f 'wilfuImu-rder, if 1- had comitted it; and I gave
most humble thanks on my knees to God, that had
thus delivered me from blood-guiltiness; beseeching
him totgran't me'the protection of his Providence, that
gin-igh't not fall into the hands of barbarians ; or that
i might not lay my. hands upon them, unless I had a
more clear call from Heaven to do it, indefence of
my own life. ' .

Inthis disposition I continued for near ayear after
this: and so far was I from desiring an occasion for
falling upon these wretches, that .in all that time I
never once wentup the hill to see whether there were
any of them in sight, or to know whether any of them
had been on shore there, or not; that I might not be
tempted to renew any of my contrivances against
them, or be provoked; by any advantage which might

,present itself, to fall upon them; only this I did I
went and removed my boat, which I had on the other
side of the island, and carried it dow to the east end
of the whole island, and carried it down-to the east end
of the whole island, where I ran it into a little cove
which I found under some high rocks, and where I
knew, by 'reason of the currents, the savages dur'st
not, at least would not, come with their boats upon.
any account whatsoever. . '

With my boat I carried away every thing that I had
left there belonging to her, though not necessary for
the baie going thither; viz. a mast and sail, which I
had made for her, and a thing like an anchor, but in-
deed which could not be called eithe'r anchor or grap-
ling; however, it was the best I could make of its
kind. .All these I removed, that there might not he
the least shadow of any discovery, or any appearance
of my boat,- or of any habitation upon the island.

Besides this, I kept myself, as I said, more retired
than ever, and seldom went from my cell. other than
upon my constant employment, viz. to milk my size--
goats, and manage my little flock in the wood. which,
as it was quite on the other part of the island, was
quite out of danger: for certain it is, that ""393
savage peOple, who sometimes haunted this lSllll-Iil,
never came with any'thoughts of finding; any thine;
here, and consequently never wandered oll' from the
coast; and I doubt not but they might have been
several times on shore, after my apprellmlsiuns of
them had made me cautious. as well as heir-"c
indeed I looked back with some horror~ upon the
thoughts of what my condition would have been, if I
had. chopped upon them, and been discovered before
- that when naked, and unarmed, except with one gun,
and that loaded often only with small shot. 'I walk-
ed every where, peeping and peering about the island,
to see what I could get: what a surprise should I
have been in, if, when I discovered the print of a.
man's foot, I had instead of that seen fifteen or men. ,
ty savages, and found them pursuing me, and, by the
swiftness of their running, 'no possibility of my escap-
ing them! . '

' The thoughts of this sometimes sunk my very soul
within me, andidistressed my mind so much, that I
could not soon recover - it; to think what I should
have done, and how I not only should not have been
able to resist them, but even should not have had .
presence of mind enough to do what I might have
done; much less what now, after so much conside-
ration .and preparation, I might be able to do. In-
deed, after eerious thinking of these things, I would
be very melancholy, and sometimes it would last a
great while; but I resolved it at last all into thankful-
ness to that Providence which had delivered me from
so ma...y unseen danger-giant! _had kept me from those
mia'hiefs, which I could no way have been the agent
ir delivering myself from; because I had not the least
action of any such thingdepending, or the least sup-
position of its being possible. .

This renewed acontemplation,whieh of ten had com e
to my thought in former time, whe first I began to see '
the merciful dispositions of Heaven, in the dangers we
run through in this life; how wonderfully we'are delio
vered' when we know nothing of it: how, when we are
in a quandary, (as we 'call it) a doubt or hesitation,
whether to go this way, or that'way, a secret hint shall
direct nsthis way,when we intended to go another way;
nay,when sense,o_ur own inclination,and perhaps busi-
ness,has called to go the other way,yet a strange impres-
sion upon the mind, from we know not what amines,
and by we knew not what power, shall over-rule us to
go this way ;' and it shall afterwards appear, that had
we gone that way which we would have gone, and even
to ourimagination ought to have gene, we should have
been ruined and lost;' upon these, and many like re-
flections, I afterwards made it a certain rule with me,
that whenever I found these secret hints, or pressing
of my mind, to doing or not doing any thing that pre
ented, or to going this way or that way,- I never fail
ed to obey the secret dictate; though I new no othe
reason for it, than that such a pressure, or such an
hint, hung upon my mind: I could give many exam-
ples of the success of this conduct in the course of my
life; but more especially in the latter part of my in
habiting this unhappy island ; besides many oceasions
which it is very likely I might have taken notice of,
if I had seen with the same eyes then thatI saw with
now: but 'tis never too late to be wise; and I cannot
but advise all considering men, whose lives arefat~
tended with such extraordinary incidents as mine, or
even though not so extraordinary, not to slight such
secret intimations of Providence, let them come from
what invisible intelligencethey will; that I shall not
discuss, and perhaps'cannot account for; but certainly
they are a proof of the converse of spirits, and the
secret communication between those embodied, and
those unembodied; and such a proof as can never be
withstood : . of which I shall have occasion to give
some Very remarkable instances, in. the remainder of
my solitary residence in this dismal place.
I believe the reader of this will not think, it strange,
if I confess that these anxieties, these constant dangers
lived in, 'and the concern that was now upon me,
ut an end to all invention, and to all the contrivances
that I had laid for my future accommodations and
conveniences. I had the care of my safety more now'
upon my hand than that of my food. I cared not to
drive a nail, or choP-a stick of wood now, for fear the
noise I should make should be heard; much less would
I fire a gun, for the same reason; and, above all, i

r

was very uneasy at making any fire, rest the smoke,
which is visible at a great distance in the day, should
betray me; and for this reason I removed that part
of my business which required fire, such as burning
of pots and pipes, &0. into my new apartment in the
wood;~where, after I had been some time, I found,
to my unspeakable consolation, a mere natural cave
in the earth, ,which went in a vast way, and where,
I dare say, no savage, had he been in the mouth of it,
would be so hardy as to venture in, nor indeed would
any man else, but one who, like me, wanted nothing
so much as a safe retreat. '

- The mouth of this hollow was at the bottom of a
great rock, where, by mere accident, (1 would say,'if
I did not see an abundant reason to ascribe all such
' things to Providence,) I was 'cutting down some
thick branches of trees to make charcoal; and before
I go on, I must observe the reason of my making this
, charcoal, which wasthus: '

I was afraid of making a smoke about my habita-
tioir, as I said'before; and yet I could not live-there
without baking my bread, cooking my meat, 6L0. ; so
I'contrived to burn some wood here, 'as I had seen
done in England under turf, till it became chark, or
dry coal; and then putting the fire out, I preserved
the coal to carry home,' and perform the other set>>

.vices, which fire was wanting for at home, without
danger or smbke. ' . '

But this by the by: while I was cutting down
some wood here, I erceived that behind a very thick
branch of low hrus wood. or underwood, there was
a kind of hollow place; I was curious to look into it,
and getting with difficulty into the mouth of it. I
found it was pretty large, thatis to say, sufficient for
me to stand-upright in it, and perhaps another with
me; but I must confess to you, I made more haste
out than I did in, when, looking further into the place,
which was perfectly dark, I saw two broad shining
eyes of some creature, whether devil or man I knew
not, which twinkled like two stars, the dim light
from the cave's mouth shining directly inand making '
the reflection. " _.
However, after, some pause, I recovered myself,
and began to call myself a thousand fools, and tell
myself, that he that was afraid to see the devil, was
not fit to live twenty years in an island'all alone, and
' that I. durst to.be1ieve"there was nothing in this cave
that was more frightful than myself; upon this,- pluck-
,ing up my courage, I took up a large firebrand, and
' in I, rushed a'gin, with the stick flaming in my hand :
I had not gone three steps in, but I was almost as
much frightened 'as I'was before ; for I heard a very
loud sigh, like that of a man in some pain ; and it was
folloWed by a broken noise,'as if of words half-e>>
.. pressed, and then a deep sigh again: I-stepped back,
and was indeed struck with such a surprise, thatit put
me into a cold sweat; and if I hadhad an hat on my
head, 'I will not answer for it that" my hair might
not have lifted it all". ' But still plucking up my spirits
as well as I could, and encouraging myself a- little,
- with considering that the power and presence'of God
was every where, and was able to protect me ; upon
this I stepped forward again, and by the light of the
firebrand, holding it up a little over my head, I saw
lying on the ground a most monstrous frightful, Old
he goat, just making'his will, as we say, gasping for
life, and dying indeed of mere old age. .
I stirred him a little to see if I could get him out,
' and he essayed to get up, but was not able to raise
himself ; and I thought with myself, he "might even
lie there ;.for if he had frightened me so, he "would
certainly fright any of 'the savages, if any of them ,
should be so hardy as to come in there, while he had
_ any life in him. ' -
I was now recovered from my surprise, and began
to look round me, when! found, the cave was but
very small; that is to say, it might be about twelve
feet over, but in no manner of shape, either round or
square, no hands having ever been employed intmak-
ing it but those of mere nature: I observed also, that
there was a place at the farther side of .it that went
in farther, but so low, that. it required me to creep
upon my hands and knees to get into it, and whither '
it went I knew not; so having no candle, I gave it
over for. some time, but resolved to come again the
next day, provided with candles and a tinder-box,
which I had made of the lock of one of the muskets,
with some wildfire in the pan. ,
Accordingly, the next day, I' came provided with
six large candles of my own making, for I made very
good candles now of goats tallow ; and going into
_ this low place, I was obliged'to cree upon all fours,
as I have said, almost ten yards ; w ich, by the way,
I thought was a venture bold enough, considering that
I knew nothow far it might go, or what was beyond
it. When I was got through the streight, I foundthe
roof rose higher u , I believe near twenty feet; but
never was such a g orious sight seen on this island, I
dare say as it was, to look round the 'sides and roof
of this vault or cave. The walls reflected an hundred
thousand lights to me from my two candles; what it
was in the rock, whether diamonds, or any other pre-
cious stones, or gold, which I rather supposed it to
he, I knew not. ' _
The place I was in was a most delightful cavity,
or grotto, of its kind, as could be expected, ' thOugh
perfectly dark; the ,floor was dry and level, and had
a sort of small loose gravel upon it; so that there avas
no nauseous creatureto be seen; neither was there
any damp or wet on the sides of the roof; the only
difficulty in it was the entrance, which, however, as
it was a lace of security, and such a retreat as I
wanted, thought that was a convenience ; so that I
was really rejoiced at the discovery, and resolved,
without any delay, to bring some of those things which
I was mostanxious about to this place; particularly, ' '
I resolved to bring hither my magazine of powder,
and all my spare arms, viz. two fowling--pieces (for I
had three in all) and three rnuskets; (for of them I
had eight in all) so I kept at my castle only five, which
stood ready mounted like pieces of cannon, on my
utmost fence, and were ready also to take out upon
any expedition. ' . '

Upon this occasion of removing my ammunition,
I was obliged to open the barrel of powder which I
took'up out of the sea, and which had been wet; and
I found, that the water had penetrated about three or
four inches into the powder on every side, which,
caking and growing hard, had' preserved the. inside
like a kernelin a shell; 80 that I had near sixty
pounds of very good powder in the centre of the cask ;
and this was an agreeable discovery to me at that
time; so I carried all away thither, never keeping
above two or three pounds of owder with me in my ,
castle, for fear. of a surprise 0 any kind; I also car-
ried thither all the lead I had left for bullets.

I fancied myself now like one of the antient giants,
which were said to live in_ caves and holes in the
rocks, where none could come at them ; for I per-
suaded myself while I was here, if five hundred sava-
ges were to hunt me, they could never find me out"; or
if they did, they-would not venture to attack me here.

The old goat, which I found expiring, died in the
mouth of the cave the next day after I made this dis-
covery; and I found it much easier to dig a great
hole there, and throw him in, and cover him with
earth, than to drag him out; so I interred him there,
to revent offence to my nose. - >>

l1 was now in my twenty-third year of residence in
this island, and was so naturalized to the place, and '
to the manner of living, that could I have but enjoyed
the certainty that no savages would come to the place
.to disturb me, I could have been content to have ca-
pitulatcd for spending the rest of my time there, even
to the last moment, till I had laid me down and died,
like the old goat, in the cave: I had also arrived to
some little diversions and amusements, which made '
the time pass more pleasantly with me a great deal
than it dld before; as, first, I had taught- my Pol, as
I noted before, to speak; and he did it so familiarly,

l
and talked so articulately and plain, that it was very
pleasant to me ; and he lived with me no less then
six-and-twenty' years; how long he migh live after-
'wards I kiiew not; though I know they have a notion
in the .Brasils, that they live an hundred yea rs ; per.
haps some of my Polls may be alive there still, calling
after poor Robin Crusoe to this day ; I wish no Eng-
lishmen the ill luck to comethere and hear them;
but if he did, he would certainly believe it was the
devil. My dog was a very pleasant and, loving com-
panion to me for no less than sixteen years of my
time, and then died of mere old age ; as for my <<cats,
they multiplied, as I have observed, to that degree,
that l was obliged to shoot several of them at first, to
keep them from devouring me, and all I had ; but at
length, when the' two old ones I brought with me
where gone, and after. some time continually driving
them from me, and letting them have no' provision
with me, they all ran wild into the woods,- except two
'or three favourites, which I kept tame', and whose
yodng, when they had any, I always drowned, and
these were part of my family: besides these, I always
kept two or three household kids ' about me, which I
taught to feed out of my hand ; and I had alSo more
arrots which talked pretty well, and would .all call
obin Crusoe, but none like my first ; nor, indeed,
did I take the pains with any of them that I had done
with him: I had also several tame sea-fowls, whose
names I know not, which I caught upon the shore,
and cut their wings; and the little stakes which I had
. planted before my castle wall, being now grown up
to a good thick grave, these {owls all live'd among
these low trees, and bred there, which was very agree-
able to me '; so that, as I. said above I began to be
very well contented with the life Iled, if it might but
have been secured from the dread of savages. .
But it was otherwise directed ; and it might noth'e
. amiss for all people who shall meet with ,my story to
make this just observation from it. viz. How frequent-
Ly, iirtlte course of our lives, the evil, which in itselg~we {seek most .to' shun, and whieh, when we are fallen ..
into, is, the most dreadfulzto us, is oftentimes the very,
means or door of our deliverance, by which "alone We
can be raised again from the affliction we are, fallen
into. -_ I ' could. give many examples of this in the
course of my unaccountable life; but in nothing'was '
it more particularly remarkable, than in the circumg
stpncdes of my last. years of solitary residence in this.

It was now the month of December, as I. said above,
In mytwenty-third'year; and this being the Southern A
solstice, for winter I cannot call it, was the particular \
time of. my harvest, and required my being pretty .
much- abroad in the fields; when going out pretty
early in' the morning, 'even' before it was thorough;
(layolight, I was surprised with seeing a light of
some fire upon the shore, at a distance from me of '
aboot two miles, towards the end of the islands, where,
I had observed some savages had been, as before ; but:
not on the other side; but, to my great affliction, it
was on' my side of the island. ' ' '

I was indeed terribly- surprised at the siglit,.aml-
stOpped short within my grove, not daring to go out,
lest I might be sorprised'; and yet I had no more
peace within, from the apprehensions I had, that-if
these savages, in rambling over the island, should find
my corn standing, or cut, or any of my works and
improvements, they would immediatelyconclude that
there were people in 'the place, and would then never
give over till they found me out. In this extremity
I went back directly to my castle, pulled up the lads
tier after me, having made all things without look as.-
wild and natural as I could.

Then i prepared myself within, putting myself in a
posture of defence; I loaded all my cannon, as I
called them, that is to say, my muske'ts, which were
mounted upon" my new fortification, and all my pise
tale, and resolved to_ defend myself to the last'gasp; .
not forgetting seriously to recommend myself to the.
divine protection, and earnestly to pray to God to den

"had no spies to send Out.. ' - ' ' . . - 1 .-
Afte'r sitting aWhile longer, and musing what I.
should do in this case, I was not able to bear sitting
in ignorance longer; so sitting up my'ladder to the .
side'of the hill, where there was a flat place, 2151 ob;-
served before, and then ulling the ladder up after
me, I set it up again, andP mounted to the. tap of the
hill; and pulling out my perspective glass,'Which I had
taken on purpose, I laid me down flat on my belly on
the ground, and began to look 'for the place. I
presently found there were no less thannine naked
Savages sitting round a small fire they had made; not
to warm them, for they had no need of that, the'wea:

ing them come on my side the island, and so near me

ways with the current of the ebb, I- began afterwards
to be more sedate in my mind, being satisfied that I
might go abroad with safety all the time of tide of
flood, if they Were not on shore before; and having
made this observation, I went abroad about my her.

As I expected, so it proved; for as soon as the
tide made tot'the westward, I saw them all take boat,
and raw (or paddle, as we call it) all away; I should
-- have observed, that for an hour and more before they
went ofl"; they went to dancing, and I could easily
discern their postures and gestures by my glasses: I

could only per'eeive, by my nicest observation, that
they werestark naked, and had not theleastcoverv
ing uponthem ; but whether they were men or women, ~ . '
that. could not distinguish" . . . . . - .- - ' "
As soon as .I saw them shipped and gone, I took:~ ,
two "grins upon my. shoulders, and two pistols'at-myj
girdle, and my-great sword by my side, without a
scabb'ard; andwith all the speed I was able to make,
I went away to the hill, where I had discovered the
first appearance of all. ,As' soon as I got thither,
- which was not lessthan two hours, (forI could not; go
apace, being so loaded with arms as I' was,)' I per.
ceived there had been three canoes more of savages
on that? place; :and ,looking out further, I saw they
. wereall'atlsea together, making over for the main.

3 ,This was a. dreadful sight to me, especially when,
going down .to~the shore, .I could see the m'arksof
horror. which the dismal Work they had been about '-
hadleft behind it, viz. the blood, the bones, and art
of the flesh of human bodies, eaten and devoure by
those wretches with .merriment and sport.' .I Was so
filled with indignation at the sight, .that I began now
. to premeditate the destruction of the next that I saw
'there,.let them be who or how many soever.

. It seemed evident to me, that the 'visits which they
thus made to this island were not very frequent; for
itwas above fifteen months before. any more of them
came on shore there again;- that is to say, I never
saw them, or any footsteps or signals, of them, in all
that time ;. for'as to the rainy seasons, then they are
sure not to crime abroad, at least not so far; yet all
this while I lived uncomfortably, by reason of- the
constant apprehensions I. was in of their coming upon
nie by surprise; from whence I observe, that the ex.
pectation of evil is more bitter than the suffering,
especially if there is no-room to shake off that ex-
pectation or those apprehensions.

During all this time, I was in the murdering hu.

have been better employed, in contriving how to air;

happy',it was that. I had provided a tame flock or"

my gun, eSpecially near that si e of the island, where
they usually came, lest I Should alarm the savages;

them come back again, with perhaps two or three

knew what to expect. ~ ' - - .

'I found them again, as I shall soon observe. It is

started out of my sleep in the night; in the day great
troubles overwhelmed my mind ; in the night I dream-
ed often of killing the savages, and the reason why
I might justify the doing of it. But to wave all this
for awhile, it was in the middle of May, on the six-
teenth day, I think, as well as mypoor wooden calen,'dr ROBINSON enuson' _ 139 , T

up with serious thoughts about my present condition,
I was surprised with' the noise of a gun as I thought,
tired at sea. ' ~ ' ' >>

This Was, to be sure, a surprise of a quite different
nature from any I had met with before ; for the Ma
tions this pd? into my thoughts were'quite of another

gun, which accordingly in about half a moment I
heard,'and by the sound knew that it was- from that
part of the 'sea where I was driven out with the cur-
rent in my boat. ' - i -.

.I immediately considered that this must be some
ship in distress, and that they had some comrade, or
some other ship in company, and fired these guns for,
signals-of distress, and to obtain help. _I had this

they had made, had taken them up, and carried them

/
off ; other whiles' I fancied they were all gone off to
sea in their boat, and being hurried away-by the cur- .

'. rent that I had been formerly in, were carred out into

the great ocean;'where there was nothing but'misery
., and perishing; and that perhaps they might by this
time think of starving, and of being in a condition to

' eataone another. ' ' - . ' "
_- Allthese were'but conjectures 'at best, so, in the

, condition I was in, I could do no lmore than look

- upon the misery of the poor men, and pity them ;.'

. which-had stillthis good effect on my side, that. it gave

'had so happily and comfortably provided for me in

' the- providence of God castsus into any'condition of
life solow, or any misery-so great, but. we may 'see
something orother to be thankful for, and may see
'others in worse circumstances than our own.

I could not so much as see room to suppose any "of .

' much as to wish or expect that the did not all perish

believe I repeated. the words, " 0 that it hadr'been

my teeth in my head would strike together, and set

could not part them again. . >> '

' Let the natunlists eXplain these things, and the rea-
son and manner of them : all I can say of them is to '
describe the fact, which _was ever surprising to me
when I found it, though I knew not from what it
should proceed ; it was doubtless the affect of ardent
wishes, and of strong ideas formed in my mind, rea-
lizing the comfort which the conversation of. one of
my fellow-Christians would have been to me. .. . ~

But it was not to be ; either their fate,or mine, or
both, forbad it; for till the last year of my being on
this island, I never knew whether any were saved
out of that ship, . or' no ; and had only the affliction
some days after tasee the corpse of a drowned boy
come on shore, at the end of the island which was
next the shipwreck ; he had on no clothes but a sea-
tnan's Waiscom,' a paircf open-knead "linen drawers,
and a blue linen shirt ; but nothing to direct me so
much as to guess what nation he was of : he had no-
thing in his pocket but two pieces of eight, and a.
tobaccmpipe 5 the last was to me of ten times more
Value than the first. , '

I t was now calm, and I had a great mind to ventureout in my boat to this wreck, not doubting butI
might find something on board that might be useful
to me; but that did notaltogether press me so much,
as the possibility that there might be yet some living
creature on board, whose life I mightnot only save,
but might, by-saving that life, comfort my own to
the last degree : andthis' thought clung so to my heart,
that I could not be quiet night norlday, but I must
venture out in my'boat on board this wreck; and
committing the rest to God's providence,l thought
the impression was so strong upon my mind, that it
could not be resisted, thatit must come from some
invisible direction, and that I should be. wanting to
myself if I did not, go. , z
" Under the power of this impression, I hastened
back' to my castle, prepared every thing for my voy:
age,- took a quantity of bread, a great at of fresh
. water, a compass to steer by, a bottle 0 rum, (for'l
' had still a great deal of'Ihat left) a' basket full of
raisins; and thus loadin'g'myself with every thing
p-necessary,' I went down to my boat, got the Water out
of her, and got her aflOat, loaded all my cargo in her,
and. then went home again for more: my secend
cargo was a great bag; full of'rice, the umbrella to set
up ever my'head for shade, another large pot full of
fresh water, and about two dozen of my small loaves,
or barley-cakes, more than before, with abettle'of
goat's milk, and a cheese :' all which, with great 18.-
bour' and sweat, I brought to my boat; and praying
to God'to' direct my voyage, I put out, and roWing

the rapid currents which'ran constantly on both sides

for I foresaw, that if I was driven into eithr of those

and perhaps out of my reach, or sight of' the island
again; and that then, as my boat was but small, if any
little gale of wind should rise, I should be inevitably

DS'L ' ' - ' ' ~ '

' These thoughts so oppressed my mind, that finger:
to give over my enterprise, and having haled my boat
into a little creek on the shore, I stepped out, and sat
me down. upon a little spot of rising ground, very pen
sive and anxious, between fear and desire, about, my
voyage; when, as I Was musing, I could perceive that
the tide was turned, and the flood came on, upon
which my going was for so many hours im racticable:
this it, presently occurred to me, that I 8 room go up

to the highest piece of ground I could find, and ob-
serve, if I could, howthesets of the tide or currents
lay, when the flood came in, that I "might. judge
whether, if I was driven one way out,.l might not
expect to be driven another Way home, with the same
rapidness of the currents. This thought was no
sooner in my head, but-I cast my eyes upon a little
hill which sufficiently overlooked the sea both ways,
and from whence I had a clear view (if the currents,
or sets of the tide, and-Which way I 'was to guide
myself in my return : 'hereI found, that'as the current
of the ebb set out close by the south point of the
island, so the current of the flood set in closeby the
shore of the ,ndrth side; and that 1 had nothing to do '
but"to keep to the north of the island in my return,
and I should do well enough. . .

. Encouraged with this observation, I resolved the
next morning. to set out with the first of the tide; and
reposing myself for that night in the came, under

the great. watch coat I mentioned, I launched out. .I
made firsf'a litte out to sea full north, till I began to
feel the benefit of the current. which sat eastward, and
which carried me at a great rate, and yet did not so
hurry me as the southernside current had done before,
and so as to take from me all government of the

' boat: but having a strong steerage with my paddle, I _
Went, I say: at agreat rate, directly" for the wreck:
and in less thantwo hours I came up to it.
It was a dismal sight to look at: the ship, which
' by its - building was S anish, stuck 'fast, jambed in
between two rocks; allt . _e stern and quarter of her was
beaten to pieces with: the sea; and as her forecastle,
which stuck in the rocks, had run, on with great vio-
_ lence, her main-mast and fore-mast were brought by
the board, that is to say,rbroken short off, but'her
boltsprit was-sound, and the head and bow appeared
' firm. -When I came close to her, a dog appeared upon ,
her,.which, seeing me coming, cgrelped and cried, and '
as soon as I called him, jumpe into the sea to come
to me: and I took him into' the boat, but found .him
almost dead fer hunger and thirst: Ifgave him a cake
of my bread,>> and he ate like a ravenous wolf that
had been _-starving a fortnight in the snow: I then gave
the poor Creature some fresh water, with which, if I'
would have let him, he would have burst himself, '
- After this I went on board. The first sight I met
with was tWo ' men drowned in the cook-room, or
forecastle of the ship, with their arms 'ast about "one
another. I concluded, asis indeed probable, that
~ 1. when the ship struck, it being in a stOrm;the-sea broke
so high, can so continually over her, that the men
were not able to bear it, andwere strangled with the
'constant'rushing in of the water, as much as if they
had been under water Besides the dog, there was
. nothing left in the ship that had.life,., nor any goods
. that I could see', but what were spoiled by'the water:

there were some-casks of liquor, whether wine or ' '

brandy I knew not, which lay lower in the held, and
which,, the water being ebbed out, I could'see; but
' they were too big to meddle with: I saw several chests
which I believed belonged to some of. the seamen,
and I got two of thein into the boat without examin-
ing what was inthem. ~ " -
Had the stern of the ship been fixed, and. the fore
part broken off, I am persuaded I might have made a
good voyage ; for by whatI found in these two'chests.
I had room to suppose the 'ship had a great deals?

wealth on- board; and if I may guess by the course '

she steered, she must have been bound from the Buee

nos Ayres, or the Rio de laPlata, in the south part of .

America, beybnd the Brasils, to the'Havanna, in the '

Gulph of Mexico, and so perhaps to Spain: she had,

. no doubt, a great treasure in her,'but of no use at that ,
sime .to any body; and what became of the restof
her people'I then knew not. ' ' .

{I found, besides these chests, a little cash fullo'f
liquor, of about twenty gallons, 'whiCh I got into 'my' '

"boat with much difliculty. There were several mus-
kets in a cabin, and a great powder-horn, with about
four pounds of powder in it: as for the muskets, I
had no occasion. for them,' so I left them, but took the -
powder-horn. I took a fire-shovel and tongs, which '
I wanted extremely; as also two little brass kettles,
a copper pot to make, chocolate, and a gridiron; and
with this 'cargo,~ and the dog, I came away, the tide'
beginning to makelhome again; and the same even-
ing, about an hour within night, I reached the island
again, weary and fatigued to the last degree. '

- I re used that night in the boat, and in the morning

' I reso ved to harbour what [had gotten in my-new
cave, not to carry it home to my castle. 'After. re-
freshing myself, I got all my cargo on shore, and began

'to examine the particulars: the cask of liquor Ifound- .
to be a kind- of rum, bdt not Such as we had at the
Brasils; and, in a word, not all geod; butwhen I
came to open the chests, I found several things which
I wanted}: for example, I found in one 'a fine case of
bottles, of tin-extraordinary kind, and filled with cor-g
dial; waters, fine, and very good; the ,bdttles held
about three pints each, and were tipped with silver."
I found two.. pots of very good succades, or'sweeto
meats, so fastened also on the top, that the salt water. ..
had not hurt them; and two more of the same, which -
the water had'sp'oiled; I found some very good shirts.
which were very welcOme to me, and about a dozen
and a half of 'white linen handkerchiefs and colouredofloetu'son' CRUSOE. . l 1,971

neckcloths ;' the former were also very welcome, being
. exceeding refreshing to wipe my face in a hot day.
Besides this, when I came to the till in the chest, I
found there three great bags of pieces of eight, which
"held. about eleven hundred pieces in all; and in one f,
.of'them, wrapt up in a paper, six doubloons of gold,
and. some small bars'or wedges of gold; [suppose
they might all weigh near a' pound. ' -

The' other chestI found had some clothes in it, but
of little value; but by the circumstances,,it mu'st have
belonged to the gunner's mate, as there was no powder-
in it, but about two pounds of glazed powder 'in the

.' three flasks, kept, I suppose, for charging their fowl-
ing-pieces on occasion. Upon the whole, I got very
littleby this voyage that was of much use to me; for,
as to_tIie-mbney,.I had no manner of occasion for it ;
itwas to me as the dirt under my feet; and I would
have given,it all for three' or four pair of English

' 'shoes and stockings which were things I greatly wants
ed, but had not had- on my feet new for many years :
I had, indeed, get two pair of shoes now, which I '
tack off the feet of the two drowned men whom'I
saw in the wreck ; and I found two pair more in one
of. the chests, which were very welcome to me ; but
they were not like our English shoes, either' for ease
or service, being rather what we- call pumps than
shoes; I found in the seamen's chest about fifty pie-
ces of eight in royals, but no gold : I suppose this be- -
longed ,to a poorer man than the other, which seemed
to belong to some ofl'icer. , '

Well, however, I lugged the money home to my
eave,-and laid it up; as I had done that before, which
I brought fr'om'our own ship ; but it was great pity,

' as I said,-that.the other part ofthe shiphad not come

to my share, forI am satisfied I might have loaded '-

my canoe several times overwith mimey, which, if .I

Having now brought all my things on shore, and

laid her up, and made the best of my way' to my
old habitation, where I found every thing safe and '
quiet ; so I began to repose myself, live-after my old
fashion, and take care of my family affairs; and for
awhile I lived easy. enough ; only that I was more'vi
gilant than I used to be, looked out oftener, and did
not go abroad so much ; and if at any time Idid sti
with any freedom, it was always to the east part 0
the island, where I was pretty well satisfied the savage
' never came, and'Where I could go without so many
precautions, and such a load of arms and ammunition
as I always carried with me, if I went the other way.

I lived in this condition near two yearsmore ; but
my unlucky head, that was always to let me know it
was born to make my body miserable, was all these
two years filled with projects and designs, how', if it '
were possible, I might get away from this island; for
sometimes I was for making another voyage to the
wreck, though my reason told me, that-there was no-
thing left there worth the hazard of my'voyage; some-
times for a ramble one way, sometimes another; .and
I believe verily, if I had had the boat that I went from 4

, Sallee in, I should have ventured tosea, bound any
where, I knew not whither. ' . - '

I have been, in all my circumstances, a memento
to those who are touched with that general plague of
mankind, whence, for aught I know, one half of their
miseries flow; I mean, that of not being satisfied with
the station wherein God and nature hath placed them;
for, not to look back upon my primitive condition, 1
and the excellent advice of (my father, the Opposition
to which was, as I maycall it, my original sin, my '
subsequent mistakes of thesame kind have been the
means of my coming into this miserable condition
for bad that Providence, which so happily had seated
me at the Brasils as a planter, blessed me with con-
fined desires, and could I have been contented to have
gOne on gradually, I might have been by this time, I
mean in the time of my being on this island, one of .
the most considerable planters in the Brasils ; nay, I .
am persuaded, that by the improvements I had made
in that little time I lived there, and the increase I
should probably have made if I had stayed, I might.
have been worth a hundred thousand moidores; and
what business had I to leave a settled forture, well-' '
stocked plantation, improving and increasing, to turn
. supercargo to Guinea, to fetch Negroes, when patience

and time 'would have so increased our stock at home,
that we could have bought them at our own doors,
from those whose'business it was to fetch them? And
though it had 'cost 'us. something more, yet the differ-- '
ence of that price was by no me'ans'worth saving at
so great a hazard. . ' ' ' '

But as this is ordinarily the fate of young heads,
so reflection upon the folly of 'it is as ordinarily the
exercise of more years, or of the dear-bought expe-
rience of time ; and so it was with me now; and yet,
so deep had the "mistake taken root in my temper,

Continually poring upon .the meansand possibility of

greater pleasure to the reader, bring on, the remain-a

upon what foundation, I acted. -

I am now to be supposed to be- retired into my
castle, after my late voyage to the wreck, my frigate
laid' up, and secured under water as usual, 'and my
condition restored to whatit was before; 'I had more
wealth, indeed, than I had before, but was not at all'
the richer; for I had no more use for it than the In-
dians of Peru had before the Spaniards came hither.

It was one of the nights in the rainy season in
March, the four-and-twentieth year of my first setting
foot in this island of solitariness, I.was lying in my
bed or hammock, awake, and very well in health, had
no pain, no distemper, no uneasiness of body. no,
nor any uneasmess of mind more than ordinary, butcould by no means clOse my eyes; that is, 'so as to
_'sleep ;_ no, not a wink all night long, otherwise than
'asfollows: y ' ' - .
It is as impossible as needless to set down the innu-
merable crowd of thoughts that whirled through that
great thorOughfare of the brain, the memory, in this-
night's-time :' I ran over the whole history of my life
in miniature-or by abridgment,.as I" may, call it,,tol
my coming to this island; and also of that part of my?
life since I came to this'island; in iny reflections upon
the state of my case, since I came- on shore on this
island ; I was'comparing the happy posture of my af-
fairs, in the first years of my habitation here, 'to that
course of anxiety, fearand care,- which I had lived in
ever since I had seen the print of a' foot in the sand;
not that I<< did not believe the savages had frequented
the'island even all the while, and 'might have been
several hundred of them at times on the shore there;
butas Ihad never known it, and was incapable of
any apprehensions about' it, my satisfaction was per-
fect, though my danger was the same ; and I was as
happy in not knowing'my danger, as if I had never
' really been eXposed to it; this furnished my thoughts
with many very profitable reflections, and particularly
this "one: How infinitely good that Pr_ovidence"ie,"
which has settled 'in its government, of mankind'such
-. narrow bounds'to his sight and knowledge of things;
andthough he walks in the midst of so many thousand'
dangers, the sight 'of which, if discovered ,to him,
would distract his mind andsink his spirits, he is kept
.'serene and calxn,'by having the events of things hid
from his eyes and'knowing nothing of the dangers
which surround him. ' - ' . - - .
' After these thoughts had for some time entertained
me,I came to reflect seriously upon the real danger
I had been in for so many years in this very island ;
and how I had walked aboutlin the greatest security,
and with all possible tranquility, even perhaps when"
nothing but a brow on a bill, a great tree or the ca,-
sual approach of night, had been between me and the
* worst kind of destruction, viz; that of falling into the
hands of cannibals and savages, who would have,
seized -on.-me with the same view as I did on a-'goat:
or a turtle, and have thought it no more a crime to
kill and devour me, than I did of a pigeon or curlew,
I should unjustly slander myself, if I should say!
was not sincerely thankful to my great Presen'er,' to
whose singular protection I acknowledged, withgreat
humility, that all these. unknown deliverances were
due, and without which I should inevitably have {a}:
len into their merciless hands. - .

,When" these'thought's were over, my head was for
some time taken .up in considering the nature of these
wretched creatures, I mean, the savages; and how it
came to pass in the world, that the wise Governor of
all things, should give up any of his creatures to such
inhumanity, nay, to something so much below even
brutality itself, as to devour its own kind; but as this
ended in some (at that time fruitless) speculations, it

occurred to me to inquire what part of the world these
wretches lived in; how far off the coast was from
whence they came; what they ventured so far from
home for; what kind of boats they had; and why I
might not order myself, and my business so, that
I might be as able to go over thither, as they were to
come 'to me. . i -

'I never so much as. troubled myself 'to consider
what I should do with myself when I came thither;
what should become of ,me if I fell into the hands of
the savages; or how I should escape from them, if
they attempted me; no, nor so much as how it was
possible for me to reach the coast,.and not he attacked
by some or other of them. without any, ossibility of
delivering myself ; and if I should not all into their
hands, what I should do for provision, or whither I
should bend my course : none of these thoughts, I say, .
so much as came in my way; but my mind was
wholly bent upon the notion of my passing over in
".3. neat to the main kid"; I looked back upon my

" 14 r. ~ .
present condition as the most miserable that could
possibly be; that I was not able to throw myself into
. anything butdeath that c0uld be called worse; that
if I reached the shore of the main; I might, perhaps
meet with relief; or I might coast alc'mg, as did on
the shore . of Africa, till I came to some inhabited
country, and where I, might find some relief; and after
all, perhaps, I might fall in with some ChriStian ship

that might take me in; and it" the worst came to the -

worst, I could but die, which would put an end to all
these miseries at once. Pray, note all this was the
' fruit of a disturbed mind,.an impatient temper, made,
as it. were, des erate' by the long continuance of my
troubles, and t e disappointments I had met in the
wreck I had been on board of, and where I had been
so near the obtaining of what I so earnestly longed for,
viz. somebody to speak to, and to learn some know-
ledge from of the place where I was, and of the pro-
bable means of my deliverance; I say, I was agitated
wholly by these thonghts. 'All my calm of mind in
my resignation to Providence, and waiting the issue
of the disgrosition of Heaven, seemed to be suspended;
and I ha , as it were, no power totum my thoughts
to any thing but the project of a voyage to the main;
' which came upon meiwith such force, and such an
impetuosity of desire that it was not to be resisted.
When this had agitated my thoughts for two hours
or more, with such violence that it set my very blood
into a ferment, and my pulse beat as high as if I had
been in a fever, merely with the extraordinary fer-
vour of my mind about it; nature, as if I had been
fatigued and exhausted with the very thought of it,
. threw me into a sound slee : one would have thought
I should have dreamed o it; but I did not, nor of
. any thing relating to it; but I dreamed, that as l was
going out in the morning, as usual, from my castle, I
saw upon the, shore two canoes and eleven savages
coming to land, and that they brought with them an-
other savage, whom they were going to kill, in order
to eat him; when on a sudden, the savage that they' 0F Roernson CRUSOE.

were going to kill jumped away, and ran for his life:
then I thought. in my sleep, that he came running into
my little thick grove, before my fortification, to hide.
himself; and that I seeing-him alone,and,no't perceiv- .
' ing that the others-sought him-that way, shewed my-
self to him, and, smiling upon him, encouraged him:
that he k'neeled downto me, seeming to pray me to
assist him; upon which I shewedmy ladder, made
him go up it, and, carried him "into my Cave, and he
became m' servant; and that as soon .as I had got
this man, said to myself, " Now I may certainly
venture to the main land ; for this fellow will serve me
' as a pilot, and will tell me what to do, and yhither
to go for provisions, and whither not to go for fear of
being devoured; what places to, venture into, and '
' what to escape. I waked'with this thought, and was
under such inexpressible impressions of joy at the
prospect of my escape in my dream, that the disap-
pointments which I felt u on coming to myself, and
finding it was no more t an a dream, were equally
extravagant the other way, and threw me into avery
great dejection of Spirit. '
Uponthis, however, I made this conclusion, that
_ my only way to go about an attempt for an escape,
was if possible, to get a savage in my possession ;
and if possible, it should be one of their prisoners
whbm they had condemned to be eaten, and should
bring, hither to kill: but these thonghts still were at-
tended with this clifficulty, that it was impossible to
effect this, without attacking a wholecaravan of them,
and killing them all; and this was not only'a very des-
perate attempt, and might miscarry; but, on the other
hand, I had greatly sampled the lawfulness of it to
me, and my heart trembled at the thoughts of shedding
so much blood; though it was for my deliverance : I
need not repeat the arguments which occurred to me
against this, they being the same mentioned before:
but though I had other reasons to offer now, viz. that .
those men were enemies to my life, and would devour
me if they could that it was self-preservation, in the
'~ highest degree, to'deliver myself from this death of a
life,-a'nd was aeting in my oWn defence, as much as
'if 'they'were actually assaulting me, and the like; I
say, thongh these things argued fer it, yet the thoughts
of shedding human blood for mykleliverance were
very terrible to me, and such as lc'ould by no means
receneile myself to a'great while. . ;

However, Vat'last, after many secret dispr'rtes with '
myself, and after great perplexities about it, (for all -

- these arguments, one 'Way and another, str'uggledin
my head'a'l'ong time,) the eager prevailing desires of
deliverance at length'r'naste'red' 'all the 'rest, and I re-

.s.solv'e'd, if'possibl'e,' to get. one of these savages into my'

hands,"C/o.'st What 'it 'would': the'neiit't thing then Waste

contrive how to 'do it';_ and 'thi'sindeed was very diffi-

- cult-toresolv'e on: but as I could pitch upon no pro-

bable means for it, so I resolved'to put myself upon

the wa'tch'to see them 'when'they' came on shore, and
leave the rest to the event, taking 'such measures as the

Opportunity should present, let it be what it would.

With these reselutions in my thoughts, I set myself
upon the scout as often as possible, and indeed so
often, till I was heartily tired of it; for it was above

a' year and a half that I waited, and for a great part

of that time went out to the west end, and to the

sauth-tvest corner of the island, almost every day, to

-' see the canoes, but none appeared. This was very

discouraging, and be an to trouble me much; though

I can't say that it di in this case, as it had done some

time before that, via. wear of the edge ofi my desire

to the. thing; but the longer it seemed to be delayed,

'the mere eager I was {or it: in a word, I was not at

first more careful to shun the sight of these savages,
and avoid "being seen by them, than I was now eager
to be upon them.

\1 Besides, I fancied myself, able to manage one,.na_v, .
. 3:1

fia-orthrkee savages, if I had. them, so as to make
them>> entirely. slaves to me, to do whatever I should
direct them, and to prevent their being able, at any

time, to do me any hurt. I t was a great wlnle that l01? aenmson CRUSOE; 905

pleased myself with this affair, but nothing still pre-
sented ; all my fancies and schemes came to nothing,
-_ for no savages came near me for a great while. '
About a year and a half after I.had entertained
these notions, and, by long musing, had, as it were,
' resolved them all into nothing, for want of an ocea-
sion to put them in execution, I'wassurprised one
morning- early, with seeing no less thanfive ca'noes all
on shore together, on my side the island, and the pee-. _
ple who belonged tothem- all landed, and; out of'm)
'sight : thenumber of- "them broke all my measures:
for seeing so, many, and knowing that they always
' came four, or six, or sometimes more, in a boat, I
could not tell what to think of it, or how to takemy
measures, to attack twenty- or thirty men single-hand
ed 1; so I lay still in my castle, perplexed and discom
forted -;- however, I put myself into all the same pos~
titres foran attack that I had formerly provided, and
was just ready for action, if any. thing: had presented.
Having waited a good while, listening to hear if they
made any noise; at_leng'th being very impatient, Ilset
'my guns at the foot of my ladder, and clambered up
to the top of the hill. by my. two stages, as usual,
standing so, however,'that my head did not appear
above the hill, so that they-could not percieve. me by
any means. Here I observed, by the help'bf mygper-
spective glass, that they were. no less than thirty. in.
number ; that they hadafire kindled, .andthat' they
had had meat dressed ; how they 'cooked it, that I
knew not, or what itwas; but they were all dancing
in I know not how many barbarous gestures and -
figures, their own'way, round the fire. - . -
When I was thus. looking on them, I- pereeived by:
my perspectivestwo miserable wretches dragged from
the boats, where, it seems. they were laid.by, and-
were now brought out for the'slaugbter ':. [perceivedi
one of them immediately fall, being'knocked;down,_l';
suppose, with a club or wooden sword, for thatgwas-
their ways; and two or three others 'were. at work im-
mediately, cutting him open for their- cookery,". while.
the other victim was left standing byhimself,' till they'
Should be ready for him. V In that very moment this
poor-wretch,'-seeing himself a little at liberty,' nature
inspired him with hopes of life, and" he started away,
from them, and ran with incredible swiftness along-
the sands, directly towards me, I meantowards that
part of the coast where my habitation was. - . ~.
- I was dreadfully frighted (that I must acknowledge)
when I perceived him to run my way; and especially
when, as I thought, I saw him pursued bythe whole
body; and now I expected that 'part of my dream was
' _ coming to pass,- and that he would certainly take
sh'elterin' my grove ; but I could not depend, by any
means, ,upbn my dream for the rest of it, viz. that the'
other savagesv'would not ursue him thither, and find.
him ' there. However, kept my station, and my
Spirits began to recover, when I found that there Were
not above three/men that followed him; and still
more was I encouraged, when I found that he put-
s'tript them-exceedingly'in running, and gained ground
of them, so that if he. could but hold it for half an
hour, I saw easily he would fairly get away from
them all. . y ' -~ .. , '
' There was between them and my castle the creek,
which I mentioned .oftenzat the first part of my story,
when I landed my cargoes out of the. ship; and this,
I knew he must necessarily swim over, or the poor
wretch would 'be taken there :3 but when the savage
escaping came thither, he made nothing of it, though
the tide was then up; but plunging in swam through
. in about thirty strokes, 'or thereabouts, landed, and
ran on with exceeding strength and swiftness. ' When
. the'three pursuers came to the creek, I found that two
of them could swim, but the third cbuld not, and that
he, standing on the other side, looked at the other,
but went no farther ;"_and soon after went softly back
again, Which, as it happened, was very well for him

in the_ma1n._- . . _
I observed, that the two who swam were yet more

than twice as long svvimming over the creek than the

fellow was 'thatlied from them. It came now very
warmly upon, my thoughts, and indeed irresistibly,
that now was-my time to get- a servant and perhaps a
companion or assitant, .andthat I was called plainly
by Providence to save this poor creature's life. I im-
mediately got down the ladderswith all possible ex-
pedition, fetched my two guns, for they were both at
the 'foot of' the ladder, as I observe'd~_ab0ve ; and get.
ting up again With the same haste-to the top ofthe hill

I crosseditowards the sea; and 'havinga very short ' .

cut,-a'nd all>> down hill, clapped myself. in ,the way-be-
tween the p'ursuers' and the pursued, hallooing' aloud
to him that fled, who, looking back, was at first per- .
haps as much frighted at me as 'at them ; butI beckon-
, ed with my hand to him to come back'; and in the
meantime I slowly advanced toward the two that fol-
. lowed ; then rushing at once upon, the foremost, I
knocked him down with the stock of my piece; I was
loath to-fire, because I Would not have the rest hear,
though at that distance it would not have been easily
heard ; and being out of sight of the smoke too, they
would not have easily known what to - make, of it.
Having knocked this fellow down, the, other who pur-
sued him stopped, as if he had been frightened, and I'
advanced apace towards him; but as [came nearer, I
perceived presently he had a bow and arrow, and was
fitting it'to shoot at me; so .I was then necessitated to
shoot at him first; which I did, and killed him at the
first shot. The poor savage who fled, but had stopped, ,
though he'saw both his enemies fallen, and killed, (as

he thought) vet was so frighted with the fire and'norse

of my piece, that he steed stock-still, an'dneither came , '

forward nor went backward, though. he seemed rather
'inclined to fly still, then to come on.' Ilhallooed again
to him, and made signs tocome forward, which he "
easily understood, and names; little way,.then stoppedj
again, and then a~-little farther, and stopped again"; -
and I could then perceive that he stood trembling," as '
if he had been taken prisoner, and had just _ been" to
be killed as his two enemies were. I _ beckoned him

- /,'/
/

l
again to come to me, and give him all the signs of em
courageme'nt that I_could think of ; and he came nearer
{and nearer, kneeling down every ten or twelve steps,
in "token 'of acknowledgement for saving his life. I
' smiled atkhim, and looked, pleasantly, and beckoned
to him to come still nearer. .. At length he came close
to me, and then he kneeled down again, kissed the
ground, and laid his head upon the ground, and taking
me by the foot, set my foot upon his head. This, i '
seems, was in token. of swearing'to be my slave for
error. I tookhim up, and made muchof' him, and
encouraged him all I could. But there 'was more
Work to do yet ; for'I perceived the savage, whom I
' knocked down, was not killed, but stunned with the
blow, andhegan to come to' himself ; so I pointed to
him and shewed him the savage, that he was not
"dead: upontthis he spoke some words to me; and
(though I cooldmot understand them, yet I thought
they were pleasant to hear,for they were the first sound
of aman's voice that I had heard, my own excepted,
for above five-and-twentyyears. ' But there was no
time for such reflections now ; the savage, who was
. kno'ckeddo'wn, recoved, himself "so far as to sit up
upon the ground; and I perceived that my savage be-
gan to be afraid; but whenI saw that, I presented
my other piece at the man, asif I ,woqld shoot him:
'upon 'this my savage, for so I called him now, made a
motion-to me 'to lend him my sword, which hung
naked 'in a belt by my side: so I did : he no sooner
had it, but he runs to his enemy, and at one blow cut
'o'fi'his head so cleverly, no executionerin Germany
could have done it sooner or better; which I thought
very strange for one, who, I had reason to believe,
meve'r Saw a sword in his life before, except their own
"wooden swords: however, it seems, as I learnt after-
"wards they make their wooden swords so sharp, so
:lieavy, and the wood is so hard,,that.they will cut off
heads even with them, nay, and arms, and that at one
- '. fb'lthoo. ,When he had done this, he comes laughing
tome-in sign of triumph, and brought me the sword

\
\
again, and, with abundance of gestures, which I did
not understand,.1aid it dewn, with the head of the
savages that he had .killed, just before me. _

But that which astonished him most was, to know
how I had killed the other Indians?) far 01?; so point-
'ing to him, he made signs. to me to let him go to him
so I bade him go, as well as I could. When he came
to him, he; stoodlike One amazedylooking at him; -
turned him first-on one side, 'then on t'other; looked
at the wound3 the bullet had made, which it-seems was
just in' his breast, where it had made a-hole, and no
greatquantity of blood had followed; but hefhad bled
inwardly,>> for he was quite dead. Then he took up
his bow and arrows, and came back; so I turned to
go away, and beckoned him to follow me, making.
signs tohim that more might come afterthem.

, Upon this ' he signed to me, that he should bury

them with sand, that they might not be seen by the
rest, if they followed; and sol made' signs again. to
him to do so. He fell to work, and in an instant he
had scraped a hole in thesand with his hands, big
enough' to bury the first in, and then dragged him into
it, and covered him, and did so also by the other; I
believe he had buried them both in a quarter of an
hour: then calling him away, I carried him not to my
castle, but quite away to my cave, "on the farther
part of the' island; so 1 did not let my dream come to
pass 'in that part; viz. that he cameinto my grove,
for shelter. _ . , ' -
" Here I gave him bread anda bunch of raisins to
eat, and a draught of water, which I found he was
indeed in greatdistress far, by his running; and hav-
ing refreshed h'im;-I made signs for him to go to lie
down and sleep; pointing to a place whereI had laid
a greatparcel of rice-straw, and a blanket Upon it,
which I used to. sleep,upon myself sometimes; so the
poor creature lay down and went to sleep.

He was a-comely handsome fellow, perfectly well
made, with straight long limbs, not too large, tall,
and well shaped, and, as l reck0n, about twenty-six

14
years of age. He had a very good countenance, not
apfierce and surly aSpcct, but seemed to have some
thing .very manly in his {ace,'and yet he had all the
sweetness and softness of an European in his coun-
tenance too,'e'specially when he 'smiled: his hair was
long and black, not curled" like wool; his forehead
very high and large, and a great vivacity' and spark
ling sharpness in his eyes. The'colour of hisskin wa
not'quite black, but. very tawny, and yet not of an
ugly yellow nauseous tawny, as the Brasilians and.
Virginians, and other natives of America are, but of a
bright-kind of a dun olive colour, that had in it
something very agreeable, though not very easy to de-
scribe. His face was round and plump, his nose
small, not flat likethe Neg'roe's, a very good mouth,
thin lips. and his teeth fine, well-set, and white as
ivory. : 'After he had slumbered, rather than slept,
about half an hour, he waited again,'and comes out of
the cave to me, for I had been milking my goats,
which I had'in theenclosure just by; when he espied
me, he came running to me, laying himself down
again upon the ground, with all the-possible signs of
an humble thankful disposition, making many antic
gestures-to shew it. At last he lays his head flat upon
the ground, close to my foot, and sets my other foot
' upon his head,as he had done before; and-after this,
madeall the signs tome of subjection,~'servitude, and
submission imaginable, to let me know how much he
would 'serve me as long as he lined. I understood
him in many-things, and let himknow I was very
well pleased with him. In a little time I began to
speak to him, and teach him to Speak,_to me; and first,
I made him know his name should be Friday, which
.was the day I saved his-life; and .I called him so for
the memory of the time ~;' I likewise taught him to say
Master, <<and then let him know that was to be my
. ,name; I likewise taught himhto say Yes and No, and p
_ to knowthe meaning of them. ' l'gave him some milk
in" an earthen pot, and let him see me drink it before
him, and sup my bread in it; and I gave him a cake .
of bread to do the like, which he quicklycomplied
with, and made signs that it was very geod for him.
I kept there with him all that night; but as soon as
it was. day, I beckoned him to come with me, and let
him know I would give him some clothes; at which
he seemed very glad, for he was stark-naked. As we
went by the place where he had buried the two men,
he pointed exactly to the spot, and, shewed me the
marks that he had made to find them again, making
signs to me that we should dig them up again, and eat
them: at this I appeared very angry, expressed my
abhorrence of it, made as if I would vomit at the
thoughts Of it, and beckoned with my'hand to him to-
c0me away, which he did immediately, with great
submission. I then let him up to the top of the hill,
.to see if his enemies were gone, and pulling out my
glass, I looked, and saw plainly the place where they
had' been, bu: no appearance of them, or of their
canoes; so that it- was plain that they were gone, and
'had left their two comrades behind them, without any
~ search after them. . ' ,
But I was not content with this discovery; but
having. now more couraee, and consequently more
curiosity, I 'tOok my man rii'riday with me, giving him
the sword in his hand, with the bow and arrows at his
back, which I found he could use very-dexterously,
. making him Carry one gun for me, and I two for my-
self, and away we marched to the place where these
creatures had been; for I had a mind now to'getsome
fuller intelligence of them. When I came to the
lace, my very blood ran chill in my veins, and my
reart sunkWithin meat the horror-of the spectacle:
indeed it was a dreadful sight, at least it was so to me,
though Friday made nothing .of it: the place was co-
vered with human bones, the-ground dyed with the
blood, great pieces of flesh left here and there, half.
eaten, mangled, and scorched; and, in short, all the .
tokens of the triumphant feast they had been making
there, after a victory 'over their enemies. 1 saw three
skulls, five hands, and the bones of three or four legs
and feet, and abundance of other parts of the bodies;
and Friday,' by his signs made me understand that
they brought over four prisoners to feast upon; that
three of them were eaten up, and that he, pointing to
himself, was the fourth; that therehad been a great
' battle between them andtheir next king, whose sub-
jects, it seems, he had been 'one of; and that they had
taken a great number of prisoners, iallwhich were car-.
fled to several placesby those that had taken them in
the flight, inorder to feast upon them, as ,was done.
here by these wretches upon. those they brought hither.
I caused Friday to gather all the skulls, bones, flesh,
and whatever remained, and lay them together on an
heap, andvmake a great fire upon it, and burn them
' to ashes. 1 found Friday had still an hankering-
stomaeh after. some of the flesh, and was still a-canni-
ha] in his nature; but I discovered so much abhor-
rence at the very thoughts of it, and at the least ap-
Eearance of 'it, that he durst not discover it; for It
' ad, by some means, let him know that 1 would kill
him if he offered it. ' t - . ,
When we had done this, we came back to our
castle, and therel ,fell to work for my man Friday;
andfirst of, all, I gave him a pair of linen drawers,
which I had: out of "the peor gunner's -chest..I men-
tioned, and'whiCh'IIound in the wreck; and which;
with Va.>>_1i:tt,l'e alteration, fitted him very. well; then I
made himya, jerkin ofigoat's skin as well as my skill
would-9.110, _;-,'_and'I was now-grown a tolerable good

and thus he was dressed, for the present, tolerably'

' ' almost as Well clothed as his master. It is true, he
went awkwardly in these. things atiiirst; wearing the

' The next day after! came home to my hutch with
him, I began toconsider-where I should lodge him ;
and thatI might do well for-him, and yet be perfeclty
easy myself I made a little tent for him in the vacant
place between my two fortifications, in' the inside of
the last, and in the outside'of' the first: and as there
was a door or entrance there into my cave, I made a
- formal framed doorecase, and a door to it of boards,
and set it up in the passage,'a little withinthe en<<
trance ; and causing the door to Open to the inside, I -
barred it up in the night; taking in my ladders too ; so
that Friday could no way come at, me in the inside of _,
the innermost wall without making so much noise in a;
getting over, that it must needs awaken me ; for my
first wall had-new a complete roof merit of long.
poles, covering all my tent; and leaning up to the side
'of the hill, which was again laid cross with small
sticks instead of laths, and then thatched Over a great ' '
thickness with the rice straw, which was strong like
reeds; and at the hole or place which" was left to go
in or out by the ladder, I had placed a-kind of trap-
door, which if it had been attempted on the outside,
would not have Opened at all, but would have 'fallen
down, and made a great noise; and as toweapons, I
took themall in to my side every night. .- '~ .'

But I needed none of all this precaution-.3 for never
man had a more faithful, loving, sincere servant than
Friday was to me; without passions, sullen'ne's, or'
designs; perfectly obliging and 'eng'agin'gr-his very
affections were tied to me, like those of a child to a,
father; and I dare say, he would have" sacrificed his
life for the saving mine, upon any occasion wh'atso-
ever ; the many testimonies he gave me of this put it ' ' - '
out of doubt ; and soon convinced me, that I needed
to use no precautions as to my safety'on his account.

This frequently gave me occasion to observe, and
that with wonder, that, however it had pleasedGodl; "
in his providence, and in the government ,ofthe.;i;

works of hishands, to take from so great a part; 0;
the world of his creatures the host uses to which "their
faculties, and the powers of their souls, are adapted ,
yet that he has bestowed upon them the same powers
the same reason, the same affections, the same 'sentio
ments of kindness and obligation, the same passions
and resentments of wrongs, the same sense'of grati-
tude, sincerity, fidelity, and all the capacities of doing
good, and receiving good,'t_hat he has given to us;
and that when hepleases'to ofi'er them occasions of
exerting these, they are as ready, nay more ready, to
apply them to the right uses for which they were be-
stowed, than we are. And this made me very melan-
choly sometimes, in reflecting, asthe several occasions
presented, how mean an use we make of all these,
even though wezhave these powers enlightened by the
great lamp of instruction, the Spirit of .God, and by
the knowledge of his word, added to our understand-
ing; and why it has pleased God to hide the like sav<<
ingknowledge from so many millions of souls, who,
if I might judge by this poor savage, would make a
-much better use of it than we did.

From hence I sometimes was led too far to invade
the sovereignty of Providence ; and, as it were", ar-
raign the justice of so arbitrary a disposition of things,
that should hide that light from some, and reveal it to
others, and y'etexpect alike duty frbm both : butI
shu't'it up, and checked my thoughts with this conclu-
sion: first,- that we do not know by what light and law
these should be condemned; but that as God was ne-
cessarily, 'and by the nature of his being infinitely
holy and just, 'so it could not be, but" that if these crea-
tures were all sentenced to absence from himself,- it
was on account of sinning against that light, which, '
asthe Scripture says, was'a law to themselves, and by

_. such rules as their consciences would aCknowledge to

be just, though the foundation was not discovered to

. "us; and, secondly, that still, as we are all clay in the

.' . hand of the potter, no'vcssel could say to him, "Why
' hast thou formed me thus ?" .

But to return to my new companion : I was greatly
delighted with him, and made it my business to, teach
him every thing that was pmper to make him useful,
handy, and helpful; but es ecially to make him speak
and understand me when Ispake ; and he was the
aptest scholar that ever was: and particularly was so
merry, so constantly diligent, and so pleased when he
could but understand me, or make me understand
him, that it was very pleasant to me to talk to him.
.And now my life began to'be so easy, that I began to
say to myself, that 'could I but have been safe from
more savages, I cared not if .I was never to remove
from the place where I lived.

After I had been two or three days returned to my
castle, I thought, that, in~ orders to bring Friday off
from this'horrid way of feeding, and from~the relish
of a cannibal's stomach, I Ought to let him taste other
flesh '; so I took him out with me one morning to the
woods : I went, indeed ,intendi'ng to kill a kid out of
my own flock, and bring it home and dress it : but as
I was going, I saw a she goat lying down in'theshade, ,
and two young kids sitting by her. I catched hold of
Friday; " Hold," said I, " stand" still ;" and made '
signs to him not to stir. Immediatelyl presented my
piece, 5th and killed one of the kids. The poor crea-
ture, who had, at a distance indeed, seen me kill the
savage "his enemy, but did not know, or could imagine
how it was done, was sensibly sur rised, trembled
and shook, and looked so amazed, t at I thought he
would have sunk doWn :. he did not see the kid I had
shot at, 'or perceive I hadlkilled it, but ripped up his
waiscoat to ,feel if he was not wounded; and, as I
found, presently thought I was resolved to kill him ;
for he came and kneeled down to me, and, embrac-
ing my knees, said a great many things I did nOt un-
defstand; but I could easily see that his meaning was
to pray me not to kill him. ' ' ~ .

I soon found a way to convince him, that'I wouldi-y-g
do him no harm i and taking him up by by-the hand"? ,_ '
laughed at him, and pointing to the kid" which I had? ..
killed, beckoned to him to run and fetchit, which he i
did; and while he was wondering and looking to see '
how the creature was'killed, I loaded my gun agaur'

and by and by I saw .a great fowl, like a hawk, sit
upon" a\tree within shot; so, to let Friday understand
a little what I would do, I called him _to me again,
pointing at the fowl, which was indeed a parrot,
though I thought it had been a hawk; I say, pointing
to the parrot, and to my. gun, and to the g'roundunder
the parrot, to let him see I would make him fall, I
made him understand that I would shoot and kill tha

bird ; accordingly Ifired, andbid-him look, and im

mediately he saw the parrot fall ; . he stood like one
frighted again, notwithstanding all that I had said to
v him ; and I found he was the more amazed, because

he did not see me put any thing into the, gun; but.

thought there must be some wonderful fund of death
and destruction in that thing, able to kill man, beast,
bird, or any thing near or far off ; for the astonish-
ment this'ereate'd in him was such, as could not wear
Off fora long time; andl believe, if I would have
let him, he would have worshipped me and my gun ;
as for the gun itself, he would not so much as touch it
fdr several days,,after; but would speak to it, and talk
to it, as if ithad answered him, when he was by him-
self; which, as I-afterwards le'ant of him, was to de-
sire it not to kill him.

Well: afteiuhis astonishn'ient was a little over' at
this, I pointed to him to run and fetch the, bird I had
shat, which he did, but staid some time; for the par-
rot, not being quite dead, had fluttered a good wa}r
off from the 'place where she fell ; however, he found
her, took her up, and brought her to me ; and, as-I
had perceived his ignorance about the gun before, I
took this advantage to charge the gun again, and not
let him see'me do.,it, that I might be'ready for any
. other mark. that might resent; but nothing more
iofi'eredy-at that time; so brought home the kid ; and

  

' - hailed ~or'S-steured some of the flesh, and made same
verygood lwoth . after I had begun to eat some, i

g"?- the same;_'evening I took the skin off, and cut it out as ' 1
" PS9 well 'asliIhouldfland having a pot for that purpose, I
gave some .to my man, who seemedvery glad of it,.
and liked it very well; but that which was strangest
to him, was, to see me. eat salt with it. He made a.
sign to me that the salt wasnot good to eat; and put~ "
ting a little into his own mOuth, he seemed to nauseate
it, and would spit and sputter at it, washing his mouth
with fresh water aftereit. 0n the other hand, I took

ome meat in my mouth without salt, and I pretended
o spit and sputter for want of salt, as fast as he. had

one at the salt; but it would not do, he-would never
care for salt with meat, or in his broth; at least, not
a great while, and then but a. very litfle. ,

Having thus fed him with boiled meat and broth, I -
was resolved to feast him the next day with roasting a.
piece of the kid: this I did by hanging it before the
fire in a string, as I had seen many people do in Eng.
land, setting twd poles up, one on each side the fire,
and one cross on the t0p, and tying the string to the
cross stick, letting the meat t'urn continually ; this Fri-
day admired very. much; but when he came to taste

the flesh, he took so many ways to tell me how well
he liked it, that I could not but understand him; and .
at last he told me he would never eat man's flesh any
more, which I was very glad to her. -

The next day I set'him to work to beating same
corn out,'and sifting it in the manner I used to do, as
I observed before; and he understood how to do
it as well as I, especially after he had seen what the
meaning of it was, and that it was to make bread of;
for after that I let him see me make my bread, and
bake it too; and in a little time Friday was able to do .
all the work for me, as well as I could' do it myself. '.

I began now ,to consider, that, having two mouth

0 feed instead of one, 1 must provide more round
or my harvest, and plant a'larger'quantity 0 corn,"
han I used to do; so I marked outa larger. piecegfil-xgu
land, and began the fence in the same' manneri'a'sibef-'fggefisg.
fore, in which Friday 'not only worked ve'rygniiillingly :1"
and very hard, but did it very cheerfully; ahdg'lftold? . ' _3
VOL. I; '15 "L ' 'i' u . r << '-
him what it was for, that it was for corn to make
more bread, because he was now with me, and that I
might have enough for. him and myself too: he ap-
' peare'd very sensibleof that part, and let me know,
that he thought lhad much more labour upon me on
his account, than I had for myself, and that he would
work the harder for me, if I would tell him what to
do. - a . ' ' .
This was the pleasantest year of all the life I led in
. this place. Friday began to talk pretty well, and un- .
derstand the names of , almost everything 1 had oc-'
casion to call for, and of every place had to send him
~ to, and talk a great deal to me; so that, in short, I
began now to have some use for my-tongue again,
which indeed I had very little occasion for before;
that is to Say, about speech. Besides the pleasure of
talking to him, I had a singular satisfaction in the fel-
low'himself; his simple unfeigned honestyappearetl
tome more and more every day, and I began really
to love the creature; and on his side, I believe, he
loved me more than it was possible for him. ever to
love any thing before. ~
I had a mind once to try if'he had any hanliering
inclination to his own country again; and having
learnt him English so. well, that he could answer me
almost any questions, I asked him, whether the nation
that, he belonged to never conquered in battle? At
which he smiled, and said, " Yes, yes, we always
fight the better; that is, he meant, always get the
better in fight; and so we began the following disc
course. " You always fight the better!" said I :
"' how came you to be taken prisoner then, Friday?"
Friday. My nation heat much for all that.

. .Muster. .But why did not your side recover you

make go in the canoe ;. my nation have no canoe that
time. - . - .
JlItiSter. ' Well, Friday, and what does your nation
do \With the men they take? Do they. carry them
" away, and eat them as these did? .

Friday. Yes, my nation eat mans, too, eat all up. '

.Master. YVhere do they'carry them ?'

Friday. Go to other place where they think.

JlIaster. 1Do they come hither? '

Fa'z'day, Yes, yes, they come hither; come other
else lace. , ..

Jl' aster. Have ou been here withthem? ~

Friday. Yes, been herer [points to the N. W.
side of the island, which, it seems, was their side]

By this I understood, that my man Friday had
formerly been among the Savages, who used to come
on shore on the farther part of the island, on the said'
man eating occasiOns that he was now brought for; .
and some time after, when I took the courage to carry
him to that side, being the same I formerly mention-
ed, he presently knew the place, and told>> me, he was;
' there once when they ate up twenty men, two women,
and one child: he could not tell twenty in English,
but he numbered them by laying so many stones in a.
row, and pointing to me to tell them over.

I have told this passage, because it introduces'what
follows; that after I had had this discourse with him,
I asked him, how far it was from our island to' the
shore, and whether the canoes were not. often lost?
He told me there was no danger, no canoes ever lost;
but that after a little way out to sea, there was a cur-
rent, and a wind always one way in the morning, the
other in the afternoon. ..

'l'his'I. understand to be no more than the sets of the
tide, as going'out, or coming in ; but I afterwards un-
derstood it was occasioned by the great draught and .

reflux of the mighty river Oroonoquetin the mouth
.of which river, as I thought afterwards, our island lay;
and that this land, which I erceived to the W. and
N. W. was the great islan Trinidad, on the north
point of the mouth of the river.'_ I. asked Fridaya
thousand questions about the country,the inhabitants,
the sea, the coast, and what nations were near: he
told-me all he knew 'with the greatest openness imai

inable. I asked him the names of the several nations

f his sort of people, but could get no other name
than Caribs; from whence I easily understood, that
these were the Caribees, which our maps place on the
part of America which reaches from the mouth of the
river _Oroonoque to Guinea, and onwards to St .
Martha; - He told me, that up a great way beyond the
moon, that 'was', beyond 'the setting of the moon,
which must be W. from their country, there dwelt
white-bearded men, like me, and pointed to my great
whiskers, which I mentioned before; and that they
had killed much mans, that was his word: by which
I understood he meant the Spaniard, whose cru'elties
in America had been spread over the wholecoun- .
tries, and were remembered by all the nations from
father to son. ' ,

I inquired if he. could, tell mehow. I might come
from this island, and get among those white men; he
told me, Yes, yes, I might in two canoe; I could
. not understand what he meant by two canoe; till at
last, with great difficulty, I found he meant, that it
must be in a large great boat as big as two canoes.

This part of Friday's discourse began to relish with
with me very well; and from this time I entertained
some hopes, that one time or other I might find an
opportunity to make my escape from this place, and
ehat this' poor savage might be a means to help me to

o it. - - _ .
During the long time that Friday had now been
with me, and that he began to speak to me, and under-
stand. me, I was not wanting to lay a foundation of
religious knowledge in his mind ; particularly I asked
him one time, Who made him? The poor creature
\ did not understand me at all but thought I had asked
who was his father; but I took it by another handle,
and asked him, Who made the sea, the ground he
walked on, and the hills and woods? He told me it

-'was one old, Benamuckee that lived beyond all ; he
'could describe nothing of this great person, but that

' he was very old; md'ch older, he said, than. the sea
or the land, than the moon or the stars. I asked him
then, if this old person had made all things, why did
not' all things worship him? 'He looked very grave,
and'with a perfect look of innocence said, All things

. said O! to him. I asked him, if the peeple who die
in his country, went away any where ? ' He said, Yes,
they all went to Benamuckee. Then I. askedhim, '

_ whether those they ate up, went thither too? he said,
es. ~ * ,

- ' From these things I began. to; instruct him in the
knowledge of the true God. I told. him," that the
great Maker of all things lived there, pointing'up to-
wards heaven ; that he governs'the world bythe same.
poWer and providence by which he made it ;. that he
was omnipotent, could do every thing for us; give
every thing to us, take every thing from us ;.and thus,
by degrees, I opened his eyes. He listened with great
attention, and received with pleasure the notion of
Jesus Christ being sent to redeem us, and of the man'-

. ner of making our prayers to God, and his being able
to hear" us, even/into heaven : he told me one day,
that if our God could hear us up beyond the sun, he
must needs be a greater God than their Benamuckee,

- who lived but a-little way off, and yet could not hear,
till they went up to the great mountains, where he
dwelt, to speak to him. I asked him, if ever he went

hither to speak to him ? He V said, Np, they never
went that were young men; ,none' went thither but
the old men -; whom he called their Oowookakee, that
is, as I made him explain it to me; their religious,_or
clergy; and that they went to say 0 ! ('so- he 'called
sayin%prayers,) and then came back, and told them
what enamuckee said. B ythisl observed, that there
is priestcraft even among the most blinded ignorant
Pagans in the world; and the policy of making-a se-
cret religion, in order to preserve the' veneration of
the peo.p1e to the clergy, is not only to be found in. the
Roman, but perhaps among all religions in,the world,
' even among the most brutish and barbarous savages. .
I endeavoured to clear up this fraud to 'my ma
Friday; and told him, that the'pretence of their 61
men going up to the mountains to say 0! to their go
Benamuckee, was a cheat; and their bringing wor
from thence what he said,.was much more so ; tha
if they met with any answer, ons'poke with any one
there, it must be an evil spirit: and then I_ entered
into a long-discourse with him about the devil, the
original of him, his rebellion'against God, his enmity
to man, the reason of it, his setting himself up in-the
dark parts of the world to be worshipped instead of
God, and as God, and the many stratagemls he made
use of, to d'elude mankind to their ruin :j how he had
a secret access to our passions and to our affections,
to adapt his snares to our inclinations, as to cause
. us even to be our-own tempter's, and to run upbn our
own destruction by our own choice. i
I found} it was not so easy to imprint right notions
in his mind about the devil, as it was about the being
of ' a God : nature assisted all my arguments to evi-
dence to him even the'necessity of a great First Cause,
and over-ruling governing Power. a secret directing
Providence, and/of the equity and justice of paying-
homage to Him that made us, and "the like : but there '
appeared nothing of all this in the notion of an evil
spirit, of his original, his being, his nature, and, above
all of his inclination todo evil, and to draw us in u;
'do so too: and the poor creature puzzled me-once in
such a manner, by a question merely natural and in.
nocent,fthat I scarce knew what to say, to-jiim.' ' I
had been talking to him a great deal of the. power 0.
God, his omnipotence, his dreadful aversion to sin,
"his being aconsuming fire to the workers'ot iniquity;
how, as he had made us all, he could destroy us, andor hosmson onuson. 2'23

all the world, in a moment; and he listened wit
great seriousness to me all the while. ,

After this, I had been telling him how the devil
was God's enemy in the hearts of men, and used all
his malice and skill to defeat the good designs of Pro-
vidence, and" to ruin the kingdom of Christ in the
world, 'and the like : " Well," says Friday, " but you
say God is so strong, so great, is he not much strong,
much "might, as the devil 7'"-'-" Yes, yes)? said 1,
Friday, '.' God is stronger than the devil, God is above
the devil, and therefore We pray. to God- to tread him
under our feet, and. enable us to resist his temptations, '
and quench his fiery darts;"--" But'? says ' he again,

" ifGodmuc'h strong, much might, as the devil, why
God not kill the devil, so make him no more wicked 3'"

l was strangely surprised at his question ; and after
all," hough I was now an old man, yet I was but a
you "g. duct!>> and. ill enough qualified fora caSuist, or
a solver (if difficulties: and at first 1 could not-tell
what to say ;' . so 'I pretended not to hear him, and
, asked him what'he said? but he was too earnest for -

-- an answer to forget his question ; so that he re eated
it in the 'very same broken words, as above, y this
time I had reCovered myself .a little, and I said, " God
will at last punish him severely; he is reserved for
the judgment, and is to be cast into the bottomless pit,
to dWell with everlasting fire." This did not satisfy
Friday; but he returns upon me, repeating my words,
"Reserve at last ! me no understand : but 'why not
kill the devil now, not kill great ago ?"----" You may

. as well ask me,"' said I, " why God does not kill you
' and me, when we do wicked things here that offend _
him P we are preserved to repent and be pardoned."*.
He mus'es awhile at this: " Well, well," Says he,
mighty affectionately, " that'well; 8.0. you I, devil, all
. wicked,'all preserve, repent. God pardon all." " Here
I was run down again by him to the last degree, and
it was a' testimony to me, how the mere notions of
nature. though thev will snide reasonable creatures to
the knowledge ot'a God, and or a worsm'p or homage
'due to the supreme being' of God as the consequence,
of our nature; yet nothing but divine revelation can
form the knowledge of Jesus Christ, and of a redemp-
tiOn purchased for us; of a Mediator; ,ofa new cove-
nant; and of an Intercessoi' at-the .footstool of God's
throne; I say, nothing butla revelation-from Heaven
can form these in the; soul; and that therefore the
' Gospel of our Lord ,and_Sav-iour Jesus Christ, I mean
the word of God, and the Spirit of God,-promised
for the guide and sanctifier of his people, and the ab-
solutely necessary instructors of the souls of men, in
. the saving knowledge of God, and the means of 5an
' Yation'. . . ->> _' ' '
: I therefore diverted the present discourse between
me and my man, rising up hastily, as upon some sud-
den occasion of going out; then, sending him-forsome-
thing a great way ofl', I seriously prayed to Gugsfithat
begrwould enable me 'to instruct savingly this.- poor
aavage, assisting, by his Spirit, the heart .of the poor
. ignorant creature to receive the light of the knowlede
of God in Christ,' reconciling him to himself, - and
would guide me (to speak so to him from the wbrd of
God, as his conscience might .be convinced, his eyes
opened, and his scul saved. When he came again to
me, I entered into a long discourse _ with him upon
thesubject of the redemption of man by the Saviour
of the world, and of the doctrine cf. the Gospel
preached from Heaven, viz. of the re entance towards
God, and faith of our blessed Lord esus : I then ex-
plained-to him, as well as I could, why our blessed
edeemer took not on him the nature of angels,>> but
. the seed of ' Abraham, and how,-for that reason, the
.fallen angels had no share in the redemption; that he
came only to the lost sheep of ' the j house'of Israel,
and theiike. ' g - - i '
I' had, God knows, more sincerity than knowledge,
' in all the methods I took-ferithis poo'rcreature's in-
' struction and must: acknowledge, what I believe all -
that act upon the same principle will find, thatin lay.
in: things Open to him, really informed and instruct-
ed myself- in many things that either I did not know,
or had not fully Considered before ; but which occur-
red naturally to mymind, upon my searching into
them for the information of this poor savage; and I
had more affection in my enquiry after things upon
this occasion, than ever I felt before; so that whether
this poor wild wretch' was the better for me or no,
I 'had great reason to be. thankful that ever he came to
me: mygrief sat lighter upon me,'my habitation grew
comfortable to me beyond measure; and when I re-
flected, that in this solitary life, which .I had been
confined to, I had not only been moved "3561f to look
up to Heaven, and to seek to the Hand at brought
. me thither, but was now to be made an inStrument,
tinder Providence, 'to save the life, and for aught I
knew thefsoul, of a poor savage, and bring him to the '
true knowledge of religion, "and of- the Christian doc-
trine, that he might know Christ Jesus, to know whom
is life eternal: I say, when I'reflected upon all these
things, a secret . joy ran, through every part ' of. my
soul, and I frequently rejoiced that ever I was brought
to this place, which I .had often thought the moet
dreadful of all afflictions that could possibly have be-
fallen me. , .

In this thankful'frame Icontinued all the remainder
of my time; and the conversation which employed
' ' the hours between Friday and me was such as made,
the three years which we lived heretOgether perfectly
and completely happy, if any such thing as complete
happiness can be found in a sublunary state. The
savage was now a good Christian, a much better than '
I; though I have reason to hope, and bless God for
_t, that we were equally penitent, and comforted re-
stored penitents: we had here the Word of God to
read, and no farther ofi'from his spirit to instruct than
if we had been in England. - , , , . '

I always applied, myself tore'ading the :Scripture,
and to let him know as well a'sI "could the meaning
of what I read; and heagiain', by his serious inquiries

I ' . ' . 15 .0 w ' J '
and questions, made me, as I said before, a much bet..
ter scholar in the Scripture knoWledge, than I should
. ever have been by my own private reading. - Another
thing I cannot refrain from observing here, also from
experience, in this retired part of my life; viz. how
infinite and inexpressible a blessing it is, that the
knowledge of God, and of the doctrine of salvation by
Christ Jesus, is so plainly laid down in the Word of -
God, so easily to be received and understood, that as.
_ the bare reading the Scripture made me capable of
- understanding enough of my duty to carry me directly
on to the great work- of sincere repentance for my ,
sins, and laying hold of a Saviour for life and salva-
tion, to a stated reformation in practice, and obedience
to all'God's commands, and this without any teacher
or instructor (I mean, human ;) so the plain instruc-

As to the disputes, wranglings, strife, and conten-
tion, which has happened in the world-about religion,
whether nicetiesin doctrines, or schemes of church-
governmeut, they were all perlhctly useless to us, as
for aught Ican yet 'see, they have been to' all the rest
in the world : we had the sure 'guide to heaven, viz.
the Word'of God ; and we. had, blessed be God ! com-
fortable views of the Spirit of God, teaching and .in-
structing us by his Word, leading us into all truth, and,
making us both willing and obedient to the instruction
of his Word ; and I cannot see the least use that the'

After Friday and I became more intimately ac-
quainted and that he" could understand almost all!
said to him, and 'speak fluently,'though in broken Eng-
lish, to me, I acquainted himwith my own story, 01'
at least so much of it as relates to my coming into
the place, how I had lived there, and how long: I let -
him into the mystery (for such it was to him) ot gun-
powder and bullets, and taught him how to shoot; I
gave him a knife, which he was wonderfully delighted
with : and I. made him a belt with a. frog hanging to
it, 'such-as in England we wear hangers in ; and in the
_ frog, instead of a hanger, Igave him a hatchet, which
was notonly as good a weapon in some cases, but
' much more useful upon many occasions. '

I described to him the countries of Europe, and
particularly England, which I came from; how we ,
lived, how we worshipped God, how we behaved to
one another, and how we traded in ships to all the
parts of the world. I gave him an account of the .
'wreck which I had been on board of, and shewed him
as near as I could, the place where she lay ; but she
was all beaten 'in pieces, long-before, and quite gone.

I shewed him the r'uinscf-our boat, which we lost
when we escaped, and which 'I could not stir with
my whole strength then, but was now fallen almost all
to pieces. Upon .lseeing'this'boat, Friday stood mus-
tng a great while, and said nothing: I asked him what
it was he studied upon? At last, says he, " Me see
such boat like come to place at my nation."

I did not understand him a good while; but at last,
when I had examined further into it, I understood -
by him, that a boat, such as that had been, came on
shore upon the country where he lived ; that is, as he
- eXplained it, was driven thither b stress of weather.
I presently imagined, that some uropean ship must
have been cast away upon their coast, and the boat
might get loose, and drive ashore ;' but was so dull,
that I never once thought of men making escape from
a wreck thither, much less whence they might come ;
so I only enquired after a description of the boat.

Friday described the boat'to me well enough : but
brought me better to understand him, when he added,
with som'e warmth, " We save the white mans from
drown." ,Then I presently asked him, if there were
any white mans, as he called them in the boat P "Yes,"
- he said, " the boatfull of white mans." I__ asked him,
how many? he told upon his fingers seventeen- I
askedhim'then, what became of them ?' he told. me,
" They live,'they-'d_well at my nation."

This put, new thOughts into my head again {for I
presently' imagined, that these might be the men he'-
longing to'the ship that was cast awayin sight of my
island, as I now callr it; and who,'after-. the ship wa
struck on the rock, and they Saw her inevitably lost
had saved themselves in' their boat, andwere lande
ufidn that wild shore among the savages.' .

Upon his I enquired of him more critically, what
was become of them '? He assured me they lived still
there,- that they had been there about four years, that
the savages let them alone, and gave them victuals to
live. I asked him, how it came to'pass they did not

.kill them, and eat them? He said, " No, they. make
brother with them :" that is, as I understood him, a
truce : and then he added, " They eat no mans but
when make the war fight ;" that is to say, they never
eat any men, but such as'come to fight with them, and

are taken in battle. - , j .-~ '

It 'was after this, some considerable time, that being
on the t0p of the hill, at the east side of the island,
from whence, as I have said, I. had in a clear day dis-

' covered the main or continent of America; Friday,

theweather being very serene, looks very earnestly

towards the main land, and in a 'kind of surprise falls

aojumping and dancing, and calls out to me, for I

was at some distance from him : I asked him what

was the matter P " 0 joy 2" says he, " 0 glad! there

see my country, there my nation!" fl ,

I observedan extraordinary sense of 1 pleasure ap

x peared in his face, and his eyes sparkled, and his court,

tenance discovered a strange eagerness, as if he had a

mind tobe in his own country again ; and ' this ob-,

servation of mine puta great- many thoughts into me ,' '
which made me' at first. not so easy about my new
man Friday as I wasbefore; and I made no doubt,
but that if Friday could get back to his own nation
again, he would not only forget all hisreligion, but all
his obligations to me; and would be forward enough
to giVe his countrymen an account of; me, and come
back, perhaps, with an hundred 61' 'two of them, and

make a feast upon me, at Which he might be as merry . A
as he 'used to be with thoSe of his enemies, when they -

were taken in war. . . ,
. But I wronged the poor honest creature very much,
for which I was very sorry afterwards: however, as
my jealousy increased" and held me some weeks,;..I
was a little more circumspect, and n'ot's'o firmiliar' and
kind . to himas before; in which I was certainly in
thejwrong too, the hOnest grateful creature having no
' thought about it, but what consisted of the best prin-
ciples, both as a religious Christian and as'a grateful
friend, as appeared afterwards to my full satisfaction.
' Whilst my jealousy of .him'lasted, you may be sure
i was every day pumping him, to see if he would dis-
cover any of the new thoughts which I suspected were
in him ;'but I found every thing he said was so honest

' bud so'innocent, that I could find nothing to nourish '

my suspicion; and, in spite of all myunea'siness, he
made me at last entirely his own again; nor did he
in the least perceive that I was-uneasy; and there-
fore I could not suspect him of deceit. '

'One day, walking up the same hill, but the weather '

being hazy at sea, so that we could not see the con-'
tment, I called to him, and said, " Friday, do not you

wish yourself in your own country, your own na-"

tion ?----" Yes,"' he said, " I be much. 0 glad to be
army own nation."--.--" What would you 'do there?"
said I ': " would you turn wild again, eat men's flesh

again, and be a savage as you were before ?" He look. .,

ed full of concern, and shaking-his head, said, " No,
no, Friday tell them to live good; tell them. 'to pray
God ; tell them it eat corn-bread,'cattle-fiesh, milk, no
eat man again-o, "Why, then," said I to him, " they
will kill you." He looked grave at that, and then
said, " No,'they no kill me, they willing love learn :"

he meant by this, they would be willing to learn. H6

Iadded, they learnt much of the bearded mans that
came in the boat. Then I asked him, if he would go
back to them? He smiled at that, and told me he ~
could- not-swim so far. I told him I would make a'
canoe for him. "He told-me herwould go, if I would'
. go with him." "I go!" said 1, "why, they will eat
'me if "I come there."---'f No, no," says he, " me make ,
" them no eat you, me make they much love on :" he
meant he would tell them how I had kille his ene-
mies'and saved his life, and so he would make them
love me. Then he told me, as well as he could, how
kind they, wereto seventeen white men, or bearded
men, as he called them, who came on shore in dis-
tress. ' ' ' ' >
From thistime, I confess, I had a mind to venture
over, and see if Ieould possibly join with these beard-
ed men, who, I made nodoubt, were Spaniards or
Portuguese; not doubting but, if I could, we'might
find some method to esca e from thence, being upon
the continent, and a goo company together, better
than I could from an island forty miles off the shore,
and alone without help. So, after some days,-I took
2 Friday to work again, by way of discourse; andtold
him, I would give him. a boat to go back to his own ;

l _ nation; and accordingly I carried him to my frigate, ,

which lay on the other side of the. island; and hav- '
ing cleared it ofx water (for I always kept it sunk in
the water), I brought it out, showed it him, and we '
both went into it; . ' '

I found he was a most dexterous fellow at manag-
ing it, would make it go almost as swift and fast again
as I could; so when he'was in, I said to him, " Well,
now,_Friday, shall we go to yournation ?" He locked
very dull at my saying so, which, it seems, ' was be-
cause he thought the boat too small to go so 'far.- I
told him then I-had abigger; so the next day I .went
tothe place where the first boat lay which I had made, '
but which I could not get into the water; he said.
that was big enough ; but then, as _I had taken no cars
of it, and it had lain two or three and twenty years
0F ROBINSON censors" - 231

there, thesun-had split and dried it, that it was in "a
manner rotten. Friday told .me, sueh'a boat would
do very well, and would carry " much enough vittle,
drink, bread ;" that was his way of talking.
' Upon the whole, I-was t; this time so fixed upon
* my design of going over with him to the continent,
that" told him we-would go and make one as big as
that, and he' should go home in it. - He answe'rednot
one word, but looked very grave and sad. I asked
him, what/was the matter with him 3'... He asked ,me
again thus, "Why you angrymad withrFriday :1 what
me done ?" I asked him, what he meant? I told him
I wasnot-angry with him at all: '"No angry! no
angry l" sa s'he,repeating the words several times,
" why- sen Friday home away to my nation ?"---
" why," said I, ". Friday, did you not say you wish. t
ed you were there ?"<--" Yes, yes," says he, " wish be
both there; n6 wish Friday there,.no master there."
In a word, he would not think .of going there with- _
out me; '9 I g?) there, Friday!" said I; f'what should
I do there ?" He turned very quick upon, me at this;
" You do great deal much good," says he; " you
teach wild mans be good, sober, tame mans; you tell
them ,know God, pray God, and live new life"...
" Alas, Friday," said I, " thou knowest not what
thou sayest; I am but an ignorant man mysel'f."----
f' Yes, yes," says he, " you teechee me good, you
teechee them: good."~--'.' No, no, Friday," said I,
"you shall go without me; leave me hereto live by
myself, as I did before." He'looked confused again
at that word, and running to one of the'hatchets which
he used to wear, he takes it up hastily, and gives it
me. -" What 1111181: I do with this?" said I to him.
' x" You take kill Friday," says he. " What must I
kill on for ?" said I. again. He returns very quick,
" W at you send Friday away for? Take kill Friday,
no send. Friday away." This he spoke so earnestly,
that I saw tears stand in his eyes. In al--u'rord, [so
plainly discovered the utmost affection-in'him to me,
and a .firm resolution in him, that I told him then, andoften after, that I' would never send-him away from

me if he was willing to stay with me.:- - .

_. Upon theuwholeras I" found by all his discourse a. _
settled affection". to me, and that nothing should part '
him from'me, sol found all the foundation of his deo-
sire to go to his own' country was- laid in his ardent
affection to the people, and-his hOpes'of my doing
them good; a thing, which I had no notion-of my
self, so .I had not the least thought, or intention, o
desire of undertaking it; But still [found astrong
inclination to my attempting an escape, as above,
founded. on the supposition gathered from the farmer
discourse; viz. that there. were seventeen bearded
'men there; and therefore, without any delay, I went
to Work with Friday, to find out a great tree proper
to fell, and make a' large periagua or canoe, to under--
take the; voyage: there were trees enOUgh in the
island to have built a little fleet,.not of periaguas and
'canoes only, but even of good large vessels: hut'lthe
main thing I looked at, was to get one so near the
water, that we might launch it when it was made, to
avoid the mistake committed at first. -. ' "

At last Friday pitched upon a tree; for I found he
knew niuch better than I what kind of wood was
fittest for it; nor can I- tell to this day what wood to
call the tree we cut down, except that is was very
'like' the tree we call fustick, or between that and the
Nicaragua wood, for it was much of the same colour
and smell. Friday was for burning the hollow or ca- -
.vityof this, tree out, 'to make it into a boat: but .I
showed him how rather to cut it with tools, which
after I'shewed him how to use, he did ,very handily;
and in about a, month'shard labour we finished it,
.and made. it very hadsome, especially, when, with
our axes, which, I shewed him how to handle, we'
cut and hewed the outside into the true shape>> of a
boat; after this, hoWever, it cost us near a fortnight's
"time'to get her along, as it were inch by inch, upon '
great rollers, .into the water: but when she was in,
she would have carried twenty men with great ease;

\
'When she was in the water, and though she was. '-
so big, it amazed me to seewith what dexrerity and
how swift my man Friday'could manage her, turn
her,' and paddle her alang; so I-- asked him if he
would , and. if we mightyenture'OVer in her ? , "- Yes,"
he Said, ":he' Venture over in her very well, though
great blow. wind)! However, I had a farther design
thathe knew nothing of, and that was, to make a ,
mast and sail, and 'to fit her- with an anchor and cable.
Asto' a mast, that was easy enough to get; so I pitohg
ed upon a straight young cedar tree, which I found
near the place, and which there was a great plenty of
in the. island; and I set Friday 'to work to cut it;

~. ' down, and gave him directions. how to shape and

order it :. but as to the sail, that was my particular
care; I knew I had old sails, or rather pieces of old ,
sails enough; but as I "had them now twenty-six
years by me, and had not been'very'careful to prea-
serve them, not imagining thatI should ever-have this
kind of use for them, I did not doubt but they were
all rotten: and indeed most of them were so; hOWe
ever Ifound two pieces which appeared pretty good,
and with these I went to work, and with a great deal
. of pains, and awkward tedious stitching (you may be
sure) for wantof'. needles, I at length made a three:
cornered ugly thing, like what we call in England a,
shoulder-of-mutton sail, to go with a. boom at bottom,-
and a little short sprit at the to ., such as usually our
ships' longnboa'ts sail with, an such as I best knew
7 how. to manage; because it was such a one as I used
in the beat in which I'made my escape from Barbas
ry, as related .in the first part of my story.
I was near two months performing this last work,
viz. rigging and fitting my mast andrsails; forI finish!
' ed them very complete, making a Small stay, and a
sail or foresail to it, to assist, if; we" should turn to
windward; and, which was more than all, I fixed a
rudder to the stern of her, to steer with; and thongh-
I was but a bungling shipwright, yet as I knew the
usefulness, agd even necessity of such a thing, I spit
,1 . J
lied myself with so much pains to do it, that at last
brought it .topass, though, considering'the many
dull contrivances I' had- for it that failed, I think it
post me almost as much labour as making the. boat. -
' After - all ' this: was done, I had my man Friday to
teach as' to what belonged to the navigation of . y
boat; for though he knew very well how to pa dle ,
the canoe, he knew nothing what belonged to a sail
and a rudder, and was the more amazed when he saw
me work the boat to and again in the sea by the
rudder, and how the sail gibed, and filled this way or
- that 'way, as' the course we sailed changed; I say,
when he saw this, he stood like one astonished and
amazed :' however, with a little use, I made all these
things familiar to him, and 'he became an-expert saio
vilor, except that as to the compass I could make him
'understand very little of that: on the other hand, as"
there was very little cloudy weather, and seldom or
never any fogs in those parts, there was the less oc-
casion for a compass, seeing the stars were always
to be seen by night, and the shore by day, except in
the rainy seasons; and then nobody cared to stir
abroad, either by land or Sea. ' ~
-. I was" now entered on the seven-and-twentieth year
of my captivity in'this place ;. though the three last
years that I had this creature with me, ought rather
to be left out of'the account, my habitation being quite
of another kind than in all the reSt of my time.
kept the anniversary of my landing here with the V
Same thankfulness to God for his mercies as at first;
and if. I had such cause of acknowledgement at first, 'I'
had much more so now, having such additional" tes-
timonies of the care of Providence over me, and the
great ho es I had of being effectually and speedily
delivere ; for I had an invincible impression upon
my thoughts,; that my deliverance was at hand, and
that I should not be another year in this place. .How-
ever, I wont On_with my husbandry, digging, plant.
ing, and fencing, as usual; I gathered and cured my
grapes, and did every necessarything, as before.
. The rainy. season was in the mean time'upon me,
when IIkept more within doors. than at other times;
_so hadI stowed our new vessel as secure as we could, '
bringing her up into 'the creek, where, as I said in
the. beginning, I landed my rafts-.fromrtheship; and
haling her up to the shore, athigh-water mark, I made
my man'Friday dig a little dock, just big enoughfor
..her,.' to float in; and then, when the tide Was'out,
we made a strong dam across the end of it, to keep
the water' out; and soshe lay dry, as to the tide,
from the sea; and to keep the rain ofi', we laid a great
many boughs of treesso thick, thatshe was as well
thatched as a house; and thus we, waited for" the
months of , Noremberand-December, in which-I deg
signed to make my adventure. . . - .

. When the settled seasonfibegan to comein, as the.
thought of my design returned with the fair weather;3'
I was preparing daily for the voyage; and the first
thing I did was to lay up a certain quantity-of proviv
sion, being the store for. the voyage; and intended,
in .a week or a fortnight's time, to open the dock; and ,'
lau'nch out our. boat. I was busy one morning upon
something of this kind, when I called to Friday, and
bid him go to the sea-shore, and; see if he could find
a turtle or tortoise, a thing which we generally got
once a week, fer the sake of the eggs, as wellas the
' flesh. Friday had not been long gone, when he came
rUn'ning back, and flew over. my outward wall, or
fence, like one that felt not the ground, or the steps '
he set his feet on; and before I had time'to speak to
- him, he cried out _to me, "0 master!_ Omaster! O
sorrow! -0 bad !"---" What's the matter, Friday 5'"
said "I. " O yonder. there,'_' says he, '3" one, two,
three canoe! one, two three 1" By this Way of speak:
ing 1. concluded ther were six; but on inquiry I
found there were but three. " Well, Friday," said],
."- do not be frighted ;" soI heartened him up as weil
as I 'cOuld. However, I saw the poor fellow-most
terribly scared; for nothing ran in his head, but that
they were come to look for him, and w'ould cut him.
1;: pieces, andeathim'; thepdor fellow trembled so
that'I'scarcei knew what to do With him; I com'fOrted
-~ him as'well" "as;I could,- and told him I "was in as
much danger-as he, and that they wouldye'at me as
well as ihim;'*';fl",But," said I, " Friday, we must re.
solve to fight th'eme can you fight, Friday 2'"--'-' Me
shoot,".. says he, " but there come many great num-
' ber.,"---" No matter for that," said'I again; "our
'guns will fright them that we do not kill."- So I asked
him, whether, if I resolved to defend him, he would
defend me, and stand by me, and do just 1 bade
him? He said, "Me die, when you bid die, master-g"
so I went and fetched a good dram of rum, and gave
him; for I had been so good a husband of ' my rum,
that I had a great deal left; When he haddrank it,
J~-m'_a'dez-h_im take 'the two foWling-pieces which'we
alwaysgjearried, and load them with large swan-shot
as big aS'small pistol-bullets; then I took four muskets,
and loaded them with two slugs and five small hill!
lets each; and my two pistols I loaded with a brace
of bullets each: I hung my great sword, as usual,
naked by my side, and gave Friday hisihatchet. ' . '

- IV hen I had thus prepared myself, I took my per-
sPective-glass, and went up to the side of the hill, to
see what I could discover; and I found quickly, by, ,
my. glass, that there were one-and-twenty savages,
three prisoners, and three canoes; and that their whole,
business seemed tobe the triumphant banquet upon
these three human bodies; a barbarous feast indeed,
but nothing more than as I had observed was usual
with them, .- . . '

" .I observed also, that they were landed, not where
they had done when Friday made his escape, but
' nearer to my creek, where the shore was low, and

where a. thick wood came close almost down to the

sea : this, with the abhorrence of the inhuman errand
these 'wretches came about, so filled me with indigna-
- tion, that I came down again. to Friday, and told him,
I was resolved to go down to them, and kill them .-
all; and asked him if he would stand by me. i! e:'tvas now gotten'over his fright, and his spirits being a.
little raised with the 'dram I had given him, hewa's
very cheerful; and told me, as before he. wduld die
when .I did die. . ' \. , "lavage-r 'I j . _
' 'In this fit'of fury, I teak first and divided the arms
which'I. had charged, as before between'u's: I gay'e-
Friday one pistol to stick in his girdle, and three guns
upon his shoulder; and I- tookone pistol, and the
other three, myself; ' and in this posture we-ma'rched
out. ' I took a small "bottle of rum in my pocket, and
gave Friday a large bag with more powder and .bul- '
let ; and as to orders, I charged him to keep close be-
hind me, and not to stir, shoot,.or do any thing till I
. bid him ;. and in the mean time, not to speak a word.
In this posture I fetched a compass to my right hand
. 0f near a mile, as well to get over the creek as to get.
into the wood ; so that I might come within shot of
them before'I could be discovered, which [had seen
by my glass it was easy to do. '
'WhileI was making this march, my former thoughts
returning, I began,to abate my resolution ; I do not
mean, that I entertained any fear of their number; for
as they were naked, unarmed wretches, it is certain I
was superior to them; nay, though I had been alone:
but it occurred to my thoughts, what call, what occao
sion, much less what necessity, I was in to go and dip
my hands in blood, to attack people who had neither
done or intended meany wrong, who, as to me, were
innocent, and whose barbarous customs were their
own disaster, being in them a token indeed of God's
having left them, with the other nations of that part
of the World to such stupidity and to such inhuman
courses-; but did not call me to take upon me to bea
judge of theiractions, much less an executioner of his
justice ; that whenever he thought fit, he would take
the cause into his own hands, a d by national ven-
geance punish them for nationa crimes; but that in
the mean time, it was none of my business; that it Was
true, Friday might justify it, because he was a de-
clared enemy, and in a state of war with those very
pmfieglar'geoples and it Was lawful for him to attack
them? hut could not say the same with respect" to
me. These things were so warmly pressed in on my
~. "thoughts all the way as I went, that I resolved Would
only go place myself near them, that I might observe
their barbarous feast, and that 1 would act then as

God should direct; but that unless something offered
that was more a call to me than .yet I hnewtof, I
Would not meddle with them. ' .

, With this resolution I entered the wood, and with-
all pessible wariness and silence (Friday following .
close at my heels) I marched till I came to the skirt
of. the wood, on the side which was next to them ;-
only that one corner of the wood lay between me and '
them :' here I called softly to Friday, and '- shewing

-_him a great tree, which was just at the corner of the
.wdod, Ibade himgo to the tree, and bring me word
if he ..could see there plainly what they were doing :
he did so, and came immediately back to me, and told
me they might plainly be viewed there; that they
were all about the fire, eating the flesh of one of their
prisoners ; and that another lay bound uponthe send;
1a little .l'rom them, whom he said they would kill'
next, and which fired the very. soul within me; He '
told me, it was not one of their nation, but one of the.
bearded men whom he had told me of, who came to
their cduntry in- the boat. I was filled with horror
at the very naming the white bearded man, and, going
'to the tree, I saw plainly, by my glass, a whiteeman, ,
.sleo My upon the beach of the' sea, with his hands
gandhis feet tied with flags, or things like rushes; and
that he Was an European, and had clothes on. ' '

_ There was another tree, and a little thicket beyond

. it,' about fifty yards nearer to them than the place

where I was, which, by going a little way about, I

saw I'might come at undiscovered, and- that then I ,

shouldbe within half-shot of them; so I withheld my
passion', though I Was indeed enraged to the highest

_ degree,- and going back about twenty paces, l'got' be- '

hind some bushes, which held all the way till 1 came.
to the Other tree, and then I came to a little rising"
ground, which gave me, a full'view-of them, atFthe'
distance-of about eighty yards. , V _ - U ' > ', ' '
.I had now not a moment to lose; for-nineteen of ~
the, dreadful wretches sat upon the. ground all close
(huddled together, and had just'sent. the other two to"
butchcrlthe- poor Christian, and bring him, perhaps
limb by limb, to their' fire'; and they were stooped
.tdown. to nntie the bandsat his feet," I" turned to Fri-

Friday said, he'would. " Then, Friday," said I," do
exactly asiyou see 'me do; fail in nothing." So "I
set' down one Of the'musk'ets and the' fo'wling--piece
upon the ground, and Friday. did" the like by his ; and
with; the other musketl tookm'y aim at the'savag'es,
bidding him do'the like._ Then asking him ifhe was
_ ready, he said, " Ye's."---" Then fire at them," said
- l'; and the same moment I fired also. _ ..
Friday took his aim so much better than-I, that

, on the side that he 'shot, he killed two of them, and

wounded three more; and on my sidie,'l killed one,
and wounded two. They were, you may be sure, in
a dreadful consternation: and all of them'twho were
not hurt, jumped up upon thei r' feet immediately, but
did not know which way to run, or Which way to
look ;' for they knew not from whence their destruc-
tion Came. Friday kept his eyes close upon me, that,
as I had bid him, _he might observe what I did ; so
as soon as the first shot was made, i threw down the
piece. and took up the fowling--piecc, and Friday did
. the like; (he sees me cock, and present ; he did the
- same? again. '- Are you ready, Friday P" said I.
"' Yes," says he. " Let fly then," said I, "in the ~
name of God; and with} that I fired again among
the amazed wretches, and so did Friday; and as our
pieces were. nowloaden with what I call swan shot,
or small pistol-bullets, we found only two dr0p ; but

dealof. "courage; upon which _I rushed out of the wood,
and shewed myself, and Friday close at my 'foot ;'as'
soon 'as' I perceived [they saw 'me, I shouted as loud

.'as I could, and badeFriday do so too; and running
as fast 'as I could, which by the 'way-wa's not very

towards the poor victim, who was, as laid, lying
-np'on the beaCh, 0r shore, between the place where
"theyr sat and the sea; .the two butchers who Were just
going to work-with him, had left him, at__the surprise
, 'of'ourfirst fire, and fled in a terrible frighti to the
_ sea-side, and had jumped into a canoe, and three more
'of the rest made the same way: I turned to Friday,

<<heap into the boat ; though I saw filo of them,- up -
again quickly: however,_he killed two of them, and -
. Wounded thethjrd, so that he lay down in the bottom
'ofthe boat as if he had been dead. V , _ -
_ Whil'e'my man'Friday fired at them, I pulled out
my knife, and cut the flags that bound the cor .vica
tim; and l'oosi'ng his hands and feet I lifte him up,
and asked him in the Portuguese tongue, what he was ?
- He answered in Latin, ' Christianus' ; but Was so
weak and {aim that heCould scarce stand, Or speak;
I took my- bottle out of my pocket, and gave it him,
making signs that he should drink, which he did ; and '
I gave him a piece of bread, which he ate; then I
"asked him, what c'ountr'yman he was? and he said,
Espagnole ; and, being a little recovered, let me
know, by all the signs-he could possibly make, how
much he was imnydebtforhis deliverance. "Seignor,"
said I, with as much Spanish as I could make up,
'f we will talk afterwards, but we must fight DOWJ; "if

. . you have any strength left, take this pistol and sword, ,

and no sooner had he the arms in his hands, but as if -
they had put new vigour intohim, he'fle'w upon his
murderers'likc a fury, and had cut t'wo'of them in
pisses. in an instant; for the truth is, as the whole was
'a surprise .to them', so the cor creatures Were so much.
frightejd with the. noise 0 our pieces, that they fell _
thWn 'for mere'amazement arid fear, and had no more
power to attempt their own escape, than their flesh
had to resist our shot; and that was the aim of . those
live that Friday shot, in the boat ;.for as three of them
fell with the' hurt they received, so the other two fell
with the fright. '

I kept my piece in my hand still, without firing,
being willing to keep my charge ready, because I h'ad .
given the Spaniard my postal and sword; so I called
to Friday, and bade him run u to the~ tree froin'
whence we first fired, and fetch the arms which lay

. "there that had been discharged, which, he did with
great swiftness; and then givingghim my musket, I
sat down myself to load all the rest again, and bade
them come to me when they wanted. While I was
loading the pieces, there happened a fierce engage-
ment between the "Spaniard and one of the savages,
'who made at him with one of their great wooden
swords, the same weapon that was to have killed him
before, if I had not prevented it; the Spaniard, who
was .as bold and as brave as could be imagined,

and had cut him two great wounds on his head; bu

him, had thrown him down, (being faint) and we!>>

iard, though undermost',' wisely quitting his sword,

' I, who was running to help could come near him}.
I'riday, being now left at his liberty, pursued the
fly ying wretches. with no weapon in his hand but his

'and all the. rest he could come 11 with: and the
paniard coming- to me for a gun, gave him one 1f

savages, and wounded them both; but as he was not
able to run, they both got from him into the weed,

Those that were in the canoe worked hard to get
out of gun shot; and though Friday made two or
three shot at them, I did not find that he hit any of
them: Friday would fain have had me take one of
their canoes, and pursue them; and indeed I was
very anxious about their escape, lest, carrying the
news home to their people, they. should come back,
perhaps, with two or three hundred of their cannes
and devour. us by mere multitudes; so 1 consented to
pursue them by sea ; and 'r'unnin to .one of their
canoes, I- jumped in, and bade riday follow me ;
but when l was in the canoe, I was surprised to find
' riotherlpoor creature lie'there' alive, bound hand and

cat, as the Spartiardwas, for the slaughterfind almost "
dead. with fear,'n_ot knowing what the matter was ; for
' he had not been able to look up over the side of the
'boat, he was tied' so hard, neck and heels, and had
~ been tied so long, that he had really little life in him.

- I immediately out the: twisted flags, or. rushes,
which they had-bound him with, and wouldhave
helped him gup'fibut he could not stand,'or speak, but
groaned mojs't piteously,believing, it' seems still, that
he was only unbound in order to be killed,

When Friday came to'him,l bade him speak to
him, and tell him of hisdeliverance; and ulling out
my bottle,'made-him give'the poor wr'etcE a dram,
which with the news of his being delivered, revived
him, and he sat up in the boat; but when Friday
came to hear him speak, and looked in his face, it
would have moved any one to tears, to have seen how
Friday kissed .him, embraced him,huggedhin1, cried,
i laughed, hallooed, jum ed about, danced, sung, then
cried again, wrung his ands, beat his own face and
head, and then sung and jumped about again like a
distracted creature. , It was a good while before I
could. make him speak-to me, or tell me what was the
matter; but when he came a little to himself, he told
me that it was his father. .

It was not easy for me to express how it moved
me, to see what ecstasyand'filial affection had work-
ed in this pour savage, at the sight of his father, and
of his being delivered from death ; nor indeed can I
describe half the extravaganCes of his affection after
this; for he went into the boat and out of the boat a
great many times : when he went in to him, he would
sit down by him, open his breast, and hold his father'shead close to his bosom, half an hour together, to
nourish it; then he took his arms and ankles, which
were numbed and stiff with the binding,'and chafed
and rubbed them with his hands; and I, perceiving
what the case was, gave him some rum out of my
bottle to rub them with, whichdid them a great deal
of good. ' ' _ _
4 This action put an end to our pursuit of the cano
with the other savages, who were now gotten almos
, out of sight; and it was happy for Us thatwe di
not; for it blew so hard within two haurs after; and
before they could be gotten. a quarter of their-way,
'- and continued blowing so hard all night,.,and that
from the north-west, which was a ainstthem, that I
could' not suppose their boat coul 'live, or that they
[ever reached to "their own coast. ' .

- But to return to Friday; he was sa-busy about his
father, that I could not find in my heart to take him
'off for some time : but after I thought he could leave
him a little, Ica'lledhim to me, and he came jump-
ing and laughing, and pleased to the highest extreme. .
Then [asked him, if he had given his father any
bread ? He shook his head, and said, ~" None : ugly
-dog eat all up self," So I gave him 'a cake of bread
out of a little pouch-'1' carried on purpose; I also
gave him a dram for himself, but he would not taste
it, but carried it to his father; I had in my pocket
also two' or three bunches of my rasins, so I gave
him 'a handful of them for his, father He had no
sooner given his father these rasins, but I .saw' him
come out of the boat, and run away as if he had'been

' bewitched. He ran at such a rate (for he was the
swiftest fellow of his feet that ever I saw)----I say, he
ran at such a rate that he was out of sight,' as it were,
in an instant ; andvthough I called and halloo'ed too
after him, it was all one ; away he went, and in a
quarter of an hour] saw him come back again, though
not so fast as he went; and as he came nearer, I
found his pace slacker, because he had something
in his hand. - '4'. When he came up to me, Irfound he had been quite _
, homefor' an earthen jug,- orpot, to bring hisfather-
some freshwater; and that he had got two more cakes
or loaves of bread. Thejbre'ad he gave me, but the
water he carried to his father: however, as I was. .
very thirsty too, I took a little sup of it: this water
revived his father more than all the rum or Spirits I
had given him' '; for he was just fainting with thirst.

When his father had drank, Icalled him, to know
if there was any water left? he said, " Yes;" and I"
bade him give. it to the poor Spaniard, who was in as
much want of it as his father; and I sent one of the
cakes, that Friday brought, to the Spaniard too, who.
was indeed very weak,' and was reposing himself
upon a green place, under the shade of a tree, and '
whose limbs were also very stiff, and very much
swelled'with'the rude bandage he had been tied with:

- when I saw that, upon Friday's coming to 'him with
the water, he sat up and drank, and took the bread, -
and began 'to eat, I went to him, and gave him 'a.'
handful of raisins: he looked up in my face with all
the tokens of gratitude and thankfulness that could
appear in any countenance; but was so weak, not-
withstanding he had so exertedhimself in the fight,
that he could not stand upon his feet; he tried to do
it two or three times, but was really not able, his
' ankles were so swelled and so painful to him; 501 .
bade him sit still, and caused Friday to rub his ankles,
and bathe them with win, as he had done his fathers.

I observed the poor affectionate creature every two
minutes, Or perhaps less, all the while he was here,
turnedghis head about, to see if his father Was in the
same place and posture as heleft him sitting; and at
last he found he was not to be seen ; at which he
started up," and, without speaking a word, flew with
that 'swiftness to him, that one could scarce perceive
his feet to touch the ground as he went: but when he _
came, he only found he had laid himself down to case
hislimbs: so Friday came back tome presently, and '
i then spoke to the Spaniards to let Friday help him
Up, if he could, and lead him to the boat, and than
he should carry him to our dwelling, where I would
take ca re of him : but Friday; a lusty young fellow."
took the Spaniard'quite up upon his back,1'anrl Carried '
. him: away to the boat, and set him down softly upon
' . the side or gunn'el of the canoe, with his feetih the in-
side of it, and then lifted them quite in, and'set hi1
'close to his father; and presently stepping out again
aunched the boat off, and paddled it along the slim
faster than I could walk, though the wind blew pretty
hard too; so he brought them both . safe; into>> our
creek; and leaving them in the boat,- runs away to
fetch the other canoe. i As he passed me, I spoke to
him, and asked him whither he went? He told me,
" Go fetch more boat ;" so away he 'went', like the
wind ;. for sure never.rnan or-horse ran like him, and
he had the other canoe in the creek almost ,as soon as
I got to .it by land; so he wafted ,me over, and then
went to help our, new guests out of the boat, which he
did ; but they were neither of them able to walk; so
that poor Friday knew not what to do. ' ,
To remedy this, I went to work in my thOughts, and
calling to Friday to bid them sit down on the bank '
while he came to me, I soon made a kind of hand-
barrow to lay them on, and Friday and I carried them
up both together. upon it between us; but when We
got _.them to the outside of our wall. or- fortification,
we were at a worse lossthan before; for it was im- '
possible to get them over; and l'was resolved notto
break it down: so I set to work again; and Friday
and I, in about. two hours time, made a very handsome
tent, covered.' with old sails, and above that with
houghs. of trees, being in the space without our cut-
ward fence, and between that and the grove of young ,
wood which I had planted: and here we made two ,
beds of such things as I had; viz; of good rice-straw,
with blankets laid upon it to lie on, and another to
. cover them on each bed. ., ' . . , '

had been occasion for it, for me : it was remarkable

too, I had but three' subjeets, and they were of three '
. different religions. .- My- man Friday was a Protestant

his father a Pagan and a cannibal; and the Spaniard
was a Papist, hawever, I allow'ed liberty of com
science throughout my dominions: butthis by the way.

As soon as I'had Scented my two weak rescued
prisoners, and given'them shelter, and a place to rest
them upon, I began to think of making some provi>>

sion for them;' and the first thing I did, I ordered '

Friday to take a yearling-goat, betwixt a kid and a
goat, out of my particular flock, to he killed : then I
cut of the hind quarter, and chopping it into small

pieces, I set Friday to wOrk to boiling and stewing, '

and made them avery good dish, I assure you, .of
flesh an broth ; having put some barley and rice also

into the roth; and as I cooked it without doors, (for-

I made "no fire within my inner wall) so I carried it
an into the new tent ;' and haying set a table there for
them, I sat down and ate my dinner also with them ;
and, as well as lcould, cheered them and encourag'ed
them, Friday being my interpreter, especially to his

father, and indeed to the Spaniard-too; for the Spans '

iard spoke the'languge of the savages pretty well.
After ' we had dined, or rather supped, I ordered

Friday ,to take oneof the canoes, and go and fetch -
our muskets and othcr'fire-arms, which, for want of ' '

time, we .had left upon the place of battle ; and the

next (lav I ordered him to go and bury the dead

bodies of the savages, "Which lax Open to the sun, and
Would presently be ofi'ensive; and I also ordered him
to bury thehorrid remains of their barbarous feast,
which I knew were pretty much, and which Icould
not think of doing myself; nay, I could not bear to

a
see them, if I went that-way: all which he punctm
ally performed, and defaced the .very appearance of '
the savages being there; so that when I went again, I
could scarce know where it was, otherwise than by
the, corner of the woodpointing to the place. '

I theri. began to enter into a little conversation with
my two'new subjects; and first I set Friday to inquire
of his father, what he thought of the escape of- the
savages inth'at canoe-Rand whether he might eitpect a
return of them witha powertoo great for us to resist?
* His first 0 ion was, 'that-the savages. in the boat
. never coul live out the'storm Which blew that night
they went off, but most of necessity he drowned or
driven south to those other shores, where they were'as
sure to be devoured, as they were to be drowned if
they were cast away ;, but as to what they would doif
they came safe on shore, he said, he knew not; but it
was his opinion, that they were s'o-dread'fully frighted
with the manner'pf being attacked, the noise, and the.
fire, that (he believed they would tell their peo le they
were all killed by thunder and lightning, an not by
the hand of- man; and that the Mo which appeared
(viz. Friday and I) Were two heavenly spirits or furies
cornedown to destroy them, and not men with weaq
pons. This, he said, he knew, because he heard them-
all cry out. so in' their language to one another; for it
was impossible for then; to conceive that a man should
dart fire, and 'speak thunder, and kill ata distance,
without lifting up the hand, as was done now. And
this old savage was in the right; for,.as I understood
since by other hands, the savages of that part never
attempted to go over to the island afterwards. They-
wereso terrified with the accounts given by these four
men,(for it seems they did escape the sea)-that they
believed, whoever went to that enchanted island,
. would be destroyed with fire from the gods.

This however, I knew not, and therefore was under
continual apprehensions for a good while, and kept
always open my guard, I and all my army; for as
there were new four of us, ' I 'would have ventured.v.aw"'"_' '

upon a hundred of them fairly. in the'open field at any
time. ' ' '
in a little time, however, no more canoes appear:
ing, the fear of their conning wore off, and I began to
take my former thoughts of a voyage to the main into
consideration, being likewise assured by Friday's
father, that I mightdepend upon good usuage from
their nation on his account, if I would go, ' '
. But my thoughts were a little suspended, when ' '
had a serious discourse with the Spaniard, and when
I understood, that there were sixteen more of his
countrymen and Portuguese, who having been east_
away,'and made their escapeto that side, lived there
at peace indeed with the savages, but were very sore
put to it for necessaries, and indeed for life; [asked
him all the particulars of their voyage; and found
they were a Spanish ship, bound from the Rio de la

Plan: to the Havanna, being directed to leave their

loading there, which was chiefly hides and silver, and
to bring back what European goods they eouid meet
with there ; that they had iive'Portuguese seamen on
board, whom they too}; 'out of another wreck; that;
five of their own men were drowned when first the
ship was lost; and that these escaped through infinite
dangers and hazards, and arrived almost starved an
the cannibal coast, where they expeeted to have. been
devoured every moment.' ' ' '

He told me, they had some arms with them, but

' they Were perfectly useless, for that they had neither

powder nor ball, the washing of the sea having spoiled

' all their powder, but a little which they used "at their

first landing to provide themselves some food.

I asked him what he thought would bec'ome of
them there; and if- thsy had formed 119 design of
making any escape? He said. they-had many sonar:
{rations about it; but that having"_'neither vessel, per:

g tools to build one, or revisions of any hind, their

counsels always ende in tears and despair,

 

I asked him, how he thought they wolud receive a
'__.'.l_'7 '.M2 ' ' '
2"

. proposal from me, which might tend towards an'
escape ; and whether, if they were all here it might
not bedone? I told him with freedom, I feared mostly
their treachery and ill usage of me, if _I put' my life
in their hand; {or that gratitude was no inherent .
virtue in the nature of man ; nor did men always
square their dealings by the obligations they had re
ceived so much as they did by the advantages they -
expected; I told him, it would be very hard, that [
should be the instrument of their deliverance, and the.
they should afterWards make me their prisoner in New

- Spain, where an Englishman was certain to be made
a, sacrifice, what necessity, or what accident soever,
brOught him. thither; and that I had rather be deliver-
ed up to the savages, and be devoured alive, than {all
into the merciless claws of the priests, and be carried
into the Inquisition. I added, that otherwise I was
persuaded, if they were all here, we might with so
~ many hands build, a bark large enough to carry us all
away either to the Brasils southward, or_ to the islands
or Spanish coast nortward :' but that if in requital _

' they Should, when I had put weaponsinto their hands, '

carry me by force among their own p60ple', I might

be ill used for my kindness to them, and make my

case worse'than it was before. .

He ansWered, with a great deal of candour and in-
genuity, that their condition was so miserable, and
they were so sensible of it, that he believed they
would abhor the thought of using any man unkindly
that should contribute to their deliverance ; and that,
if I pleased, he Would go to them with the old man,
and discourse with them about it, and return again, _

and bring me their answer: that he wOuld make con- ,

. ditions with them upon the solemn oath, that they '
would be absolutely under my leading, as their com-

mander and captain; and>> that they should swear upon

the holy Sacraments and G05pel, to be trite to me,
and go to such Christian country asl should agree to,
and no other; and to be directed wholly and abso-
lutely by my orders, till they were landed safely in' " mg'mwp-.. r

 

0F ROBINSON CRUSOE. 935i ,

such country as I intended; and that he would bring
a contraCt fro'mthem under their hands for that porn
ose. ' ' '
P Then he told me, he would first swear to me him--
self, that he would never stir from me as long as he
lived, till I gave him order ; and that he would take
my-side, to the last drop of .blood, if there should
happen the least breach of _ faith among his country-

men.

. He told me, they wereall of them very civil honest;

men, and they were under the greatest distress imagin-
able, having neither weapons or clothes, nor any
food, but at the mercyand discretion of the savages ;
out of all hopes of ever returning to their own coun-
try; and that he was sure, if I would undertake their
relief, they would live and die by me.

Upon these assurances, I resolved to venture to re-
lieve, them, if possible; and to send the old savage and
this Spaniard over to them t6 treat: but when he had
gotten all things in readiness to go, the Spaniard him-
self started an objection, which had so' much prudence
in it .on one hand, and so much sincerity on the other
hand, that I could not but be very well satisfied in it;
and, by his. advice, put off the deliverance of his com-
rades for at least half a year. The case was thus: a

He had been'with us now about a month ; during
which timeI had let him see in what manner I had
provided, with the assistance of Providence, for my
suppert; and he saw evidently what stock of corn and
rice I had laid up ; which, as it was more than suffi-
cient for myself, so it was not sufficient, at least with-
out good husbandry, for my family, now it was in-
creased to number four ; but much less would it be
sufficient, if his countrymen, who were, as he said,
fourteen 'still alive, should come over; and least of
all would it be suflicient to victual our vessel, if we
should build one, for a voyage to any of the Christian
colonies of America. So he told me, he thought it
would be more adviseable, to let him and the other .'
two dig and cultivate some more land, as much as i" wooden tools we were furnished with permitted; and ;

me, to have the meansof it out o mine; to this .pur-
pose I marked out several trees, which I thought ii
for our work, and I set Friday and his father to cut -'3

two feet broad, thirty-five feet long, anifrom two
inches to four inches thick: what prodigious labour
it took up, any one many imagine. _

At the same time I contrived to increase my little
flock cf tame geats as much as I Could; and to this
purpose I made Friday and the Spaniard to go out
one. day, and myself with Friday, the next day, for
we took our turns: and by this means we got about
twenty young kids to breed up with the rest; for
whenever we shot the. dam, we saved the'kids, and
added them to 'our flock: but above all, the season
throwing the grapes coming on, I caused such a pros
digious quantitytto be hung up in the sun, that I be-
lieve, had we been at Alicant, where the raisins of the
Sun are cured, we should have filled sixty or eighty"
barrels; and these, with our bread, was a great part
of our food, and very good living too, I assure you;
for it is an eitceeding nourishing food.

It was now harvest, and our crop in good order; it
was not the most plentiful increase I had seen in the
island, but, however, it was enough to answer our
end ; for from twenty~two bushels of barley, we
brought in and thrashed out abbve two hundred and
twenty bushels, and the like inproportion of the rice,
which was store enough for our food to the next hare
vest, though all the sixteen Spaniards had been on
shore with me ; or, if we had been ready for a voyage,
it would very plentifully have victualled our ship, to
have carried us to any part of the world, that is to say,
of America. When we had thus housed and secured
our magazine of corn, .we fell to work to make more
wicker work ; viz. great baskets, in which we kept it ;'
and the Spaniard was very handy and dexterous' at
this part, and often blamed me, that I did not make'
some things for defence of this kind of work; but I .
saw no need of it. And now having a full supplyof'
foodzfor all the guests expected, 'I gave the Spaniard
leaive to go over to. the main, to see what he could do
with those he left behind him there: I gave hint a
strict charge in writing not to bring any man With
him, who would not first swear, in the presence of
himself and of the old savage, that. he would no way
'injure, fight with, or attack the person he Shouldfind
.in the island, who was so' kind to .'send for-them'in
order. to their deliverance; but that they would stand
by and defend him against all such attempts; and
wherever they went, would be entirely under, and
subjectedto his comand; and that this should he pit
in writing, and signed with their hands: how we wer
to have this done, when I knew they had neither
pen or ink, that, indeed was a question which we
never asked. . . ~ .. _.
Under these instructions, the Spaniard, and the old
savage, (the father of Friday) went away in one of
the canoes, which they might be said. to-come in, or
ratherwere brought. in, when they came. as prisoners
to be devoured by the savages. ~ .
' I gave each" of them a musket with a firelock on it,
and about eight charges of powder and ball, charging
them to be very good husbands of both, and not to
use either of them but upon urgent occasions. * '
This Was a cheerful work, being the first measures
used by me in view _.of my deliverance for now
twenty-seven years and some days. I gave them pro-
visions of bread, and of dried grapes, suificientfor their
eountrymep for about eight days time; and wishing
them a good' voyage, I ' let them go, agreeing with .
them about a signal they should hang out at their re-
turn, by which I should know them again, when they
came back, at a distance, before they came on shore.
They went away 'w-ith a fair gale on the day that
the moon was at the full; by my account in the month
of October; but as for the exact reckoning of ' days,
. after I had once lost it,.I could never recover it again;
nor had I kept even the number of years so [punctu--
ally, as to be sure that! was right, though, as it rov-
ed when I afterwards examined my account, ligand

I had kept a true~ reckoning of years.
It was no less than eight days I waited for them,u.

when a strange and unforeseen accident intervened,
oiwhich the-like has not, perhaps, been heard of in
history. I was fast asleep in my hutch one morning,
when my man Friday came running into me, and
called aloud, " Master, master, they are come, they
are come." 7 ' << * _

I jumped up, and regardless of danger, I went out
as soon as I could get my clothes on, through my
little grove, which (by the way) was by this time
grown to be a very thick wood; I say, regardless of '

anger, I went without my arms, which was not my
custom to do ,- but I was surprised, when, turning my
eyes to the sea, I presently saw a boat at 'about'a
league and a half distance, standing in for the share,
with a shoulder oi'mutton sail, as they call it, and the
wind blowing pretty fair'to bring them in. Also-I
observed presently, that they did not comefrom that
side which the shore lay on, .but from the southern-
most end of- the island. Upon this I called Friday
in,-and bid him lie close for these were not the peo-
ple we looked for, and that we did not know yet
whether they were friends or enemies. .

In the next place, I went in to fetch my perspective
glass, to see what I could make of them; and having
taken the ladder out, I climed up to the top of the
hill, as I used to do when I was apprehensive of any
thing, and to take my View the plainer without being
discovered.

I had scarce set my foot on the hill, when my eye
plainly discovered a ship lying at'an anchor, at about
two leagues and a half's distance from me S. S. E.
but not above a league and a half from the shore. By
my observation it appeared plainly to be an English
sh' , and the boat appeared to be an English long-boat.

cannot express the confusion I was in, though
the joy of seeing a ship, and one .whom Ilhad reason
to believe was manned by my own countrymen, and
conseduently friends, was such ,as I cannot describe;
but yet I had some secret doubts hung about me, I
cannot tell from whence they came, bidding me keep
upon my guard, In the. first place, it occurred to
'me ideonsider what business an English ship could
have in that part of the 'world; since it was not the
Way to or. from any part of the world where the Eng-
lish had any traffic; and I knew therehad been no
stormsto'drive them in there, as indistress; and that
if the ' were English really, it was most probabl

that t_ e'y w'erehere upon no good design; and the
I had better continue "as I was, than fall into the hand

of thieves and murderers; _ , -

. Let no man despise the secret hints and notices 0.-
<<target, which sometimes are given him when he may
think there is no possibility of its being real, That
such hints and notices are given us, I believe few that
have made any observation of things can deny; that
they are certain discoveries of an invisible world, and
7a cenverse of spirits, We cannot doubt; and if the
tendency of them seems to be to warn us of danger,
why should we..not suppose, they are from some
friendly agent, (whether supreme, or inferior and sub'
ordinate, is not the question,) and that they are give-
en for our good? . . , .
_ The present question abundantly confirms me in the
justice of this reasoning; for had I'not been made
cautious by this secret admonition, Come from whence
it- Will, I had been undone inevitably, and in a far

Worse Condition than before, as you will see presently."

I hadhnot kept myself long in this posture, butI
saw the boat draw near the shore, as if they looked
for a Creek to thrust in at for the convenience of land-
ing; hawever, as they did not come quite far enough,
they did _ not . see the little inlet where I formerly
landed my rafts, but run their boat on shore upon the
beach, at about half a mile from me, which was very
happy for me; for otherwise they would have landed
just, est may say, at my door, and wouldhave soon
beaten me out of my castle, and, perhaps, haveplun
dered me of all I had,

When the were on'lshore, I was fully satisfied they
ware Englis men, at least most of them; one Or two

II thought were Dutch, but it did not prove so. There

' Were in all eleven men, whereof three of them I found

Were unarmed, and (as I thought) bound; andwhen
the first four or five of them Were jumped on "show,
they took those threeout "of the boat as prisoners : one
of the three I could perceive using the most passionate '
gestures of entr-eaty, affliction and dispair, even to a
kind of extravagance; the other two, I could per;
eeive,.lifted up their hands sometimes, and appeared
pioneerned indeed, but not to such a degree as the
rst.

. I was perfectly confounded at the sight, and knew
not what the meaning of it should be ;. Friday called
out to me in English, as well as he could, " 0 master!
you see En lish mans eat prisoners as' well as Savage
mans"--" EURVhy," said I, " Friday do you think they
are going to eat them then P"-------" Yes," says Friday,
'_' they will eat them,"------" No, no," said I, " Friday;
I am afraid they will murder them indeed; but you
may be sure they will not eat them." '

All this while I had no thought of what the matter
really was, but stood' trembling with the horror of
the sight, expecting every moment when the three pri-
soners should be killed; nay, once I saw one of the
villains lift up his-arm with a great outlass (as theseao
men call it) or sword to strike one of the poor men;
and I expected to see him fall every moment, at
which all the blood in my body seemed to run chill
in my veins. ' .

I wished heartily now for our Spaniard, and the
savage that was gone with him' ; or that I had any
way to harm come undiscovered within shot of them,
that I might have rescued the three men ; for I saw
no fire-arms they had among them; but it fell out to
my mind another way. . _

After I had observed the outrageous usage of the ~
three men by the insolent seamen, I observed the fel-
lows ran scattering about the land. as if they wanted
to see the country. I observed also, that the three
ether men had liberty to go where they pleased 3 but

it
5.1%
they sat down all three upon the ground very pensive
and looked like men in dispair. '

This put me in mind of the first time when I came
on shore, and began to look about me; how' I. gave
myself over for lost,'how wildly I looked round me,
what dreadful apprehensions I had, and howl lodged
in the tree all 'night for fear of being devoured by
wild beasts. ' \

. ~A's I knew nothing that night of the supply I was
._to receive by the providential driving 'of the ship
nearer the land, by the storms and" tides, by which
I have since been so long nourished and supported;
so these three poor desolate men knew nothing how
certain of deliverance andsupply they were, how near
it was to them, and how effectually and :really' they
were'in a condition of safety, at the same time they
thought themselves lost, and their case desperate.

80 little do. we see before us in the world, and so
much reason have we to depend cheerfully upon the
great Maker of the world, that he does not leave his
creatures so absolutely destitute, but that in the worst
circumstances, they have always something to be
thankful for, and sometimcs'are nearer their deliver-
ance'than they imagine ; nay, are even brought to
their deliverance by the means by which they seem
to be broughtto their destruction. ' '

It'was, just at the tap of high water when these
people came on shore, and while partly they stood
parle'ying with the prisoners they brought, and partly
while they rambledzabout to see what kind of place
they Were in, they had carelessly staid till 'the tide
was spent, and the water was ebbed considerably
away, leaving their boat aground.

They had left two men in the boat, who, as 1 found
afterwards, having drank a little too' much , brandy,
fell (asleep ; however, one of them waking sooner than
the other, and finding the boat too fast aground for

.him to. stir it, hallooed for the reSt who were straggling - ~

about, upon which they all soon 'came to the\-boat ;
but interns past all their strength to launch her, the

54'.

 

1boat being very heavy, and the shore on that side be-
ing a soft oozy sand, almost like a quiCksand.

_ In this condition, like trueseamen, who are, per-
haps, the least of all mankind given to forethought
they gave it over, and away they strolled about the
country again ; andI heard one of them say aloud to
another, (calling them off from the boat) " Why, let
her alone, Jack, can't ye? she'll float next tide." .By
which I was fully confirmed in the main enquiry,-.of
what countrymen they were. -

All thiswhile I kept myself close, not once daring .
to stir out_of my castle, any farther than to my place
,_ of observation, near the. t0p of the hill ;- and very glad
I was, to think how well it was fortified. I knew it
was no less than ten hours before the. boat could- ,be
fon float again, andby that timeit 'would be dark, and
I might be more at liberty to see their motions, and
to hear their discourse, if they had any.

In the mean time I fitted myself up for a battle, as
before, though with more caution, knowingl had to
do with another kind of enemy than I hadat first: I
ordered Friday also, whom I had made an excellent
_ marksman with his gun, to load himself- with arms :
I took myself two fowlingzpieces,,and I gave him three
muskets. My figure indeed, was very fierce; I had
my formidable goat-skin coat on, with "the great cap
I mentioned, a naked sword, two pistols in my ---belt,
and a gun upon each shoulder. '\

It was my design, as I said above, not to have made
any attempt till it- wasdark; but about two o'clock,
being the heat of the day, I found that in short they
were all gone straggling into the Woods, and, as I
thought, were all laid down to, sleep. The three poor
. distressed men, too anxious for their condition to get
any sleep, werehowever set down under the .. shelter
of a great tree, at about a quarter of a mile from me,
and as'l thought out of sight of any of the rest.

Upon this I resolved to discover myself to them,
. and learnsomething of their,condition._ Immediately
I marched in the figure above, my man Friday at a
good distance behind me, as formidable for his arms
as I but not making quite so staring a spectre-like
figure as I did. , . ' >>

I Came as near them undiscovered as. I could, and
then, before any of them saw me, I called aloud to
them in Spanish, " What are ye, gentlemen?"

They started up at the noise, but were ten' times
more confounded when they saw me, and the uncouth
figure that I made : they made no answer at all, bur
I thought I perceived them just going to fly from me',
when I spoke to them in English : ," Gentlemen,'_'
said I, " do not be surprised at me; perhaps you
may have a friend near you, when you did not expect
it."---" He must be sent directly from heaven then,"
said one of them very gravely to me, pulling ofl' his
hat at the same time, " for our condition is past the
help of man."---" All help is from Heaven, Sir," said
I: " but can you put a stranger in the "way how to
help you? For you seem to me to be in some great
distress: I saw you when you landed ; and whenyou
seemed to. make application to the brutes that came
with you, I saw one of them lift up his sword to kill

ou." ' - - -

yr The poor man, with tears running down his face,
and trembling, looking like one'astonished, returned,
" Am I talking to God or man ? Is it'a real man, or
an angel ?"----" Be in no'fear about that, Sir," said I:
" if God had sent an angel to relieve you, he would
have come better clothed, and armed, after another
manner than you see me in ; pray lay aside your
fears ; I 'am a man, an Englishman, and disposed to
assist you; you see I have one servant only; we have
arms and ammunition; tell us freely can we serve
you ?---what is your case ?"

" Our case," said he, " Sir, is too long to tell you,
while our murderers are'so near; but in short, Sir,
I was commander of that ship; my men having muti .
nied against me, they have been hardly prevailed on
not to murder me, and at last have set me on shore
in this desolate-place, with these two men with me,
one my mate, the other apassenger, where we ex

pected to perish, believing the place to he uninhabit-v

ed, and know not yet what to think of it."

" 'Wh'ere are those brutes, your enemies 3"-'-" said

I; "' do you know where they are gone ?"e---" There

they are sir," said he, " pointing to a thicket of trees;
" my heart trembles for fear they have seenus, and
heard you speak; if they have, they will certainly,
' murder us all." .

. " Have they any fire arms ?" said I. He answered,
0 they had only two pieces, and one which they left
in the boat."-.-" Well then," said I, "leave the rest
to me; 1 see they are all asleep; it is an easy thing to
kill them all; but shall we rather take them prison-
ers P" , He told me there were two desperate villians
among them, that it was scarce safe to shew any
mercy to; but if they were secured, he believed all
the rest would return totheir duty: I asked him, which
they were? He told me, he could not at that distance
describe them; but he would obey my orders in
any thing I. would direct; " Well," said I, " let us re.
treat out of their View or hearing, lest they awake, and
we will resolve farther ;" so they willingly went back
with me, till the woods covered us from them.

"Look you, Sir," said I, 5' if I venture upon your
deliverance, are you willing to make two conditions
with me?" He anticipated my preposals, by telling
me, that both he and the ship, if recovered, should be
wholly directed and commanded by me in every
thing; and if the ship was not recovered, he would
live and die with me in what part of the world soever-
I would send him; and the two other men said the
same. -

" Well," said I, " my conditions are but two: I.
That while you stay on this island with me, you will
not pretend to any authority here; and if I put arms
into your hands, you will upon all occasions give them
up to me, and do no prejudice to me or mine, upon
this island, and in the mean time to be governed by
my orders. ~ -

O
" 2. That if the ship is or may be recoverered, you
will carry me and my man to England passage free."

He-gave me all the assurance that the invention and
faith of man could devise, that .he would" Comply
with these most reasonable demands, and. besides
would owe his life to me, and acknowledge it upon
all occasions as long as he lived. ' '

" Well then," said I, "here are three muskets for
you, with powder and ball; tell me "next what you
think is preper to be done." He shewe'd all the testi-
many of his gratitude that he was able; but offered to,
liewholly guided by me: I told him, I. thought it
was hard venturing any thing, but the best method I
could think of, was to fire upon them at once,.as they
lay; and if any were not killed at the first volley, and
offered tos'ubmit, we might-save them, and so put it
wholly upon God's providence to directthe shot.

He said, very modestly, that he was loath to kill
them, if he could help it; but that those tv'vo were in-
corrigible villians, and had been the authors of all the
mutiny in the ship; and if they escaped, we should be
undone still; for they would go on board, and bring
the whole ship's company, and destroy us all. " Well
then," said I, " necessity legitimatesmy advice; for
'it is the only way to save our lives." However, see.-
ing him still cautious of shedding blood, I told him,
they should go themselves, and manage as they ibund
convenient. '

In the middle of this discourse we heardsome' of
them awake, and soon after weksaw two of them On
their feet. I asked him, if either of them were the.
men who he had said were the heads of the mutiny? '-
He said, No. " Well then," said I, " you may let .
them esape, and Providence seems to have wakened
them on purpose to save themselves."-----" Now," said
I " if the rest esca 'e you, it is your fault." .

Animated with t is, hetook the musket I had given
him in his hand, and pistol in his belt, and his two"
comrades with him, with each man a piece in his
hand : the two men, who were with him, going first,

.I'
made some noise, at which one of the seamen, who
was awake, turned about, and seeing them coming,
cried out to the rest; but it was too late then; for the
mement he cried out, they fired, I meanthe two men,
the captain wisely reserving his own piece :-they had
so well aimed ,their shot at the men they'knew, that

ne of them was killed on the spot, and the other very
SSluch wounded; but not being dead he started up
on his feet, and called eagerly for helpto the pther;
but the Captain, stepping. to him, told him it was too
late- to cry for help; he should call upon Godto for-
give his, villany; and with that word knocked'him
down with the stock of his musket, so that he never
spoke more: there were three more in the company,
and one. of them was also slightly wounded. By this
time I was come; and when they saw their danger
and that it was in vain to resist, they begged for mer-
Icy. The captain told them, he would spare their
' lives, if they would give him any assurance of their
abhorrence of the treachery they had been guilty of
and would swear to be faithful to him in recovering '
the ship, and afterwards, in carrying her back to Ja-
maica, from whence they came. They gave him all
the protestations of their sincerity that could be de-
sired, and he was willing to believe them, and spare
their lives, which 1 was not against; onlyl obliged
him to keep them bound hand and foot while they
were upon the island. -
, While this was doing, I sent Friday with the cap>>
ta in's mateto the boat, with orders to secure her, and
bring away the oarsand sail, which they did; and
oy and .by, three straggling men; that were (happily .
for them.) parted from the rest, came back upon
hearing-the guns fired; and seeing their captain, who
before was their prisoner, now their conqueror, they
submitted to be bound also; and so our victory was
complete. '

It now remained, that the captain and 1 Should in-

quire into one another's circumstances: I began first,
and told him my whole history, which he heard with
an attention even to. amazement, and particularly at
the wonderful manner of my being furnished with
provisions and ammunition; and indeed, as my story
is a whole collection of wonders, it affected him deep-
ly; but when he reflected from thence upon himself,
and how I seemed to have been preserved there on
purpose to save his life, the tears'ran down his face,
and he could not speak a word more. _

After this communiCation was at an end, I carried
him and his two men into my apartments, leading
them in just. where I came out, viz. at the tap of the
house; where I refreshed them with such provisions
as I had, and shewed them all the contrivances] had
made during my long, long inhabiting that place.

All I shewed them, all I said to them, was perfectly
amazing; but, above all, the captain admired my for.-
tificatjon; and how perfectly I had concealed my ree
.treat with a grove of trees, which,' having now been.
plantednear twenty years, and the treesgrowing much
faster than in. England, was become a little wood,
and so thick, that it was unpassable in any part of it,
but at that one side where I had reserved my little
winding passage into it: this I told him was my cas-.
tle, and my residence; but that I had a seat in the
cauntry, as most princes have, whither I could retreat
upon occasion, and I would shew him that too am?
thcr time ; but at present our business was to consider
how to recover the ship. He agreed with me as to
that; but told me, he was perfectly at a loss what mea-
sure to take; for that there were still six-and--'twenty
hands on board, who having entered into a cursed
conspiracy, by which they had all forfeited their lives
to the law, would be hardened in it now by despera:
_ tion; and would carry it on, knowing that, if they
were reduced, they. should be brought to the gallows
as soon as they Came to England, or to any of the
English colonies; and that therefore there would be
no attacking them with so small a number as we were.

I mused for some time upon what he had said, and
found it was a very rational conclusion, and that there -- ._,.-._ ran-u--

'or ROBINSON,-CRUSOE.. 263

fore something was to be resolved on very speedily,

as well to draw the men on board into some snare

for their surprise, as to prevent their landing upon us,
and destroying us. 'Upon this it presently occurred
to me, that in'a little while the ship's crew, wonder>>
ing what Was become of their comrades, and of the
boat, would certainly come on shore in their 'oth'er -
boat to see for them; and that then. perhaps they
might come armed, and be too strong for us: this he ~
allowed was rational. ' "

Upon this I told him, the first thing we hadto do
was to stave the boat, which lay upon' the beach, so
that they might not carry her off; and taking every
thing out of her, leaving her so far useless as not to

.be fit to swim ; accordingly we went on board, took

the arms which were left on board out of her, and
whatever else we found there, which was a bottle of
brandy, and another of rum, a few biscuit cakes, an

'horn of powder, and a great lump of sugar in a piece

of canvass; the sugar was five or SIX pounds; all
which was very welcome to me, especially the brandy
and sugar, of which I had had none left for many
years. , '

When we had carried all these things on shore, (the

- oars, mast, sail, and rudder of the boat were carried

before as above,) we knocked a great hole in her
bottom, that if they had come strong enough to mas,>>
ter'us, yet they could not carry off the boat. ' ~
Indeed it was not much in my thoughts, that we
could be capable to recover the ship ; "but my view
was, that if they went awaywithout the boat, I did
not much question to make her fit again to carry us
away to the Leward Islands, and call upon our friends

'the Spaniards in my way, for 1 had them still in my

thoughts. . .

While we were thus preparing our designs, and had
first by mainstrength heaved the boat up upon the
beach, so high that the tide would not float her off at
high water mark; and, besides, had broken allele in

VOL. 1- '18 N '
her bottom too big to be quickly stopped, and were
sat down musing what we should do ;. we heard the
ship fire a gun, and saw her make a' waft with her
ancient as a signal for the boat to come on board ;
but no b'oat stirred; and they fired several times,
making other signals for the boat.

At last, When all their signals and firings prove
fruitless, and they found the boat did not stir, we saw
them (by the help of our glasses) hoist another boa
out, and row towards the shore '; and we found, a
they approached that there were no less than ten men
in her, and that they had fire-arms with them.

As the ship lay almost two leagues from'the shore,
we had a full view of them as they came, and a plain
sight of the men, even of their faces; because the tide
having set them a little to the east of the other boat,
they rowed up under shore, to come to the same place
where the other had landed, and where the boat lay.

 

i
ii

By this means, I say, we had a full view of them, i.
and the captain knew the persons and characters of 3-:

all the men in the boat; of whom he said that there
were three very honest fellows, who he was sure were
led into this conspiracy by the rest, being overpower.
ed and frighted; but that for the hoatswain, who, it
seems, was the chief officer among them, and all'the
rest, they were as outrageous as any of the ship's
crew; and were no doubt, made desperate in their
new enterprise : and terribly apprehensive he was,
that they would be too powerful for us.

. I smiled at him, and told him, that men in our cir-
cumstances were past the operations of fear ; that
seeing almost every condition that could he was better

than that we were supposed to be in, we ought to "

expect that the consequence, whether death or life,
would be sure to be a deliverance: I asked him, what

he thought of the circumstances of my life, and whee "7

 

ther a'deliverance were not worth venturing for? "

" And where, Sir," said I, "is your belief of in)" be-
ing preserved here on purpose to save your life, which
elevated you a little while ago? For my part," said I,
" there seems to be but one thing amiss in all the
prospect of it."---" What's that?" says he. " Why,"
said I, " 'tis, that as you say, there are three or four
honest fellows among them, which should be spared ;
had they been all of the wicked part of the crew, I
should have thought God's provrdence had singled
them out to deliver them into your hands ; for, depend
upon it, every man of them that comes ashore, are
our own', and shall die or live as they behave to us."

As I spoke this with a raised voice and cheerfdl
countenance, I found it greatly encouraged him; so
we set vigorously to our business. We had, upon the
first appearance of the boat's coming from the ship,
considered of separating our prisoners and had in-
deed seetired them effectually. . _

Two of them, of whom the captain was less assured
than ordinary, I sent with Friday, and one of the
three (delivered men) to my cave, where they were
remote enough and-out of danger of being heard or
discovered, or of finding their way out of the woods,
if .they could have delivered themselves ;' here they

: left them bound but gave them provisions, and pro-
mised them, if they continued there quietly, to give ~
. them their liberty in a day or two; but that if they
{ attempted their escape, they should be put to death
' without mercy. They promisied faithfully to bear
' their confinement with patience, and were very thank-
ful that they had such good usuage as to have provi-
" sions and a light left. them ; for Friday gave them
candles (such as we made ourselves) for their com-
' fort; and they did not know but that he stood sentinel
.. over them at the 'entrance. -
' The other prisoners had better usage; two of them
were kept pinioned indeed, because the captain was
, not free to trust them; but the other two Were taken
' into my service upon their captain's recommendation,
and upon their solemny engaging to live and die with
us; so, with them and the three honest men, we Were

should be able to deal well enough with the ten that
were a-eoming, considering that the captain had said,
. there were three or four honest men among them also.

As soon as they got to the place where their other

boat lay, they ran their boat into the beach, and came

. all on shore, hauling the boat up after them, which
I was glad to see; for I was afraid they would rathe
have left the boat at an anchor, some distance from
theshore, with some hands in her to guard her ; an
so we should not be able to sieze the boat.

Being on shore, thefirst thing they did, they ran
all to the other boat; and it was easy to see they were
under a great surprise to find her stripped as above,
of all that was in her, and a great hole in her bottom.

' After they had mused awhile upon this, they set
up two or three great shouts, hallooing with all their
, might, to try if. they could make their companidns '
hear; but all was to no purpose; then they came all
close in a ring, and fired a volley of their small arms,
- which indeed we heard, and the echoes made the
woods ring; but it was all one: those in the cave, we
'were sure, could not hear; and those in our keeping,
though they heard it well enough, yet durst give no
answer to them. ' .

They were so. astonished at the surprise of this, .
that, as they told us afterwards, they resolved to go
all on board again to their ship, and let them know
there, that the men were all murdered, and the long-

' boat staved ; accordingly, they immediately launched
the boat again, and got all of themon board.

The captain was terribly amazed, and event can?
founded at this, believing'they would go on board the
ship again and set sail, giving their comrades up fo
lost, and so he should still lose the ship, which he 'wa '
in hopes we should have recovered; but he was quick
,ly as much frighted the other way; .

They had not been long put off With the boat, but
we perceived them coming onshore again ; but with
this new measure in their conduct. which it seems
they consulted together upon; viz. to leave three men
in the boat, and the rest to go on shore, and go up
into the country to look for their fellows.

This was a great disappointment. to us; for now
we were at aloss what to do;,for our seizing those
seven men on shore would be no advantage to us if
we let the boat escape, because they would then' row
away to the ship; and then the rest of them would be
sure to weigh, and setrsail, and so our recovering the
ship would be lost. . --

However, we had no remedy but to wait and see
what the issue of things might present. The seven
men came on shore,-'and the three who remained in
the boat put her off to a good distance from the shore,-
and came to an anchor to wait for them; so that it
was impossible for us~to> come at them in the boat.

Those tharcame on shore kept close together march-
ing towards the to of the little hill, under which my
habitation lay; an we could see them plainly, though

- they could not perceive us; we could have been very.
glad they would have come nearer to us, so that we
might have fired at them ;' or that they would have
gone farther off, that we might have come abroad.-.

But when they were come-to the brow of the hill,
where they: could see a great way in the valley and
woods, which lay towards the north-east part, and
where the island lay lowest, they shouted and hallooed
till they were weary; and not caring, it seems, to
venture far from the shore, nor far frOm one another,
they sat down together under a tree, to consider of
it: had. they thought fit to have gone to sleep there,
as the other party of them had done, they had done
thejob for us ; but they were too full of apprehensions
of danger, to venture to go to sleep, though they could
not tell what the danger was they had to fear neither.

The captain made every just proposal to me upon
this consultation of theirs; viz. that perhaps they
would all fire a volley again, to endeavour to make
' their fellows hear, and that we shoud all sally upon

1 them, Just at the juncture when their piecess'tere all
discharged, and they would'certainly yield, and we
should have them without bloodshed. I liked the
proposal, provided it was done while we were near
enough to come up to them, before they could load
their pieces again. _ . ' '

But this event did not happen, and we lay still a
long time very irresolute what course to take ; at length
I told'them, there would 'be nothing to be done in
my Opinion till night; and then, if "they did not.re-

" -' turnto the boat, perhaps We might find a way to- get

between them. and the shore, and so~might use some
stratagem with them in the boat, to getthem on shore.
We waited a great while, though very impatient
for their removing, and were veryvuncasy; when, af-
terlong consultations, we saw themstart all up, and
march down toward the sea: it seems, they had'such
dreadful apprehensions upon them of the danger of the
place, that they resolved to go on board the ship
again, give their companions over. for lost, and so. go
on with their intended voyage with the ship'.' \ ,
As soon as I perceived them go towards the'shore,
I imagined it to be as it really was; that theyhad
given over their search, and were for going back again;
and-the captain, as soon as I told him my thoughts,
was ready to, 'sink at the .apprehensions'of it; but l-~ _
presently thought "of a stratagem to fetch them back
again, and which answered my end to a tittle. '
I ordered Friday, and the captain's mate, to go
over the little creek westward, towards the place .
where the savages came on shore when Fridayrwas
rescued; and as soon as they came to a little rising
ground, atabout half a mile's distance, I bade them
halloo as loud as they could, and wait till they found
' the seamen heard there"; that as soon as ever they

heard the seamen answer them, they should return it
_ again, and then, keeping out of sight, take a round,
_ always answering when the others hallooed, to draw
them as far into the island, and among the woods, as
possible, and then wheel about again to me, by such
ways as I directed;
-They were just going into the boat, when Friday
and themate hallobed, and they presently heard them,
and answering, run along the shore westward, towards
the voice they heard, when they were presently step>>
ped by the creek, where the water being up, they
could not get over, ,and called for the boat to come
up, and set them over, as-indeedl expected. . .,

When they had set themselves over, I observed that
the beat being. gone up a good way into the creek,
and as it ,were in a harbour within the land, they
took one. Of the three men, out of her to go along with
them, and left only two in the boat, -"having fastened
her to the stump of a little tree on the shore. - ,

This was what I wished for, and immediately leaVo
ing Friday and the captain's mate to their business, 1
took the rest with me, and, crossing the creek out of
their sight, we surprised the two men before they Were
aware, one of them lying on shore, and the other be-
ing in the boat; the fellow on shore was between
sleeping and waking, and going to. start up, the cap-
tain, who was foremost, ran in upon him and knock-
ed him down, and then called out to him in the boat
to yield, or he was a dead man.

There needed very few arguments to persuade a
single man to yield, when he saw five men upon him,
and his comrade knocked down,- besides, this was, it
seems, one of the three who were'not so hearty in the
mutiny as the rest of the crew, and therefore was
easily persuaded not only to yield, but afterwards to
join very sincerely with us. _ .

In the meantime, Friday and the captain's mate so
well managed their business with the rest, that they
drew them, by hallooing and answering, from one hill
to another, and from 'one wood to another, till they
not only heartily tired them, but left them where they
were very sure they could not reach back to the boat
before it was dark; and indeed they were heartily
tired themselves also by the time they came back'to
us. _

We had nothing new to do but to watch for them
in the dark, and to fall upon them, so as to make
sure work with'them. ' _

_ It was several hours after Friday came back to me
before they came back to their boat; and we could
hear the foremost of them, long before they came
quite up, calling to those behind to come along; and
could also hear them answer, and complain how lame
and tired they were, and not being able to come any
faster, which was very welcome news to us.

At length they came up to the boat; butit is impos-
sible to express their confusion, when they found the
beat fa st aground in the creek, the tide ebbed out, and
their two men gone: we could hear them call to one
anether in a most lamentable manner, telling one an-
other they were gotten into an enchanted island ; that
either there were inhabitants in it, and they should
all be murdered; or else there were devils or spirits in
it, and they should be all carried away and devoured.

They hallooed again, and~called their two com-
rades by their names a great many times, but no an-
swer: after some time, we could see them, by the little
light there was, run about ringing their hands, like
men in despair; and that sometimes they would go
and sit down in the boat to rest themselves, then
come ashore, and .yvalk about again, and. so the same
'thing over again. ' . ' ' ,

' .My men would fain have had me given them leave
to'fall upon them at once in thedark; but I was wil-
ling to take them at some advantage, so to spare them,
and kill as few of them as I could; and especiallyI
was unwilling to hazard the killind any of our men,
knowing the other men were very well armed: I re-
solved to wait to see if they did not separate; and
therefore, to make sure of them, I drew my ambus-
eade nearer; and ordered Friday and the captain to
creep upon their hands and feet as close to the ground
as they could, that they might not be discovered, and
get as near them as they could possibly, before they
'efi'ered to fire. - -

They had not been long in that posture," till the

\

I
hoatstvain, who was the principal ringleader of the
mutiny, and had now shewn himself the most deject-
ed and dispirited of all the rest, came walking towards
them with two more of the crew; the captain was so
eager at having the principal rogue so much in his
power, that he could hardly have patience to let him
come so near as to be sure of him; for they only
heard his tongue before : but when they came nearer;
the captain and Friday, starting Up on their feet, let
fly at them.

The boatswain was killed upon the spot; the next
man was shot in the body, and fell just by him,
th'ough'he did not die till an hour or two, after; and
the third run for it.

At the noise of the fire, I immediatel advanced
with my whole army, which was now eig t men; vi'z.
\myself generalissimo; Friday my lieutenant-general;
the captain~and his two men, and the three prisoners
of war whom he had trusted with arms.

We came upon them indeed in the dark, so that

~they could not see our number; and I made the man
they had left in the boat who was now one of us, to
' call them by name to try if I could bring them to a
parley, and so might perha 3 reduce them to terms;
which fell out just as we esired : for indeed it was
easy to think, as their 'condition then was, they would
' be very willing to capitulate; so he calls out, as loud
as he could, to one of them, " Tom Smith, Tom
' Smith." Tom Smith answered immediately. "Who'fs
that? Robinson?" For it seems he knew 'hisr-vqicef'
The other answered, " Ay, ay; for God's sake, Trim
Smith, throw down your arms, and yield, or you are

all dead men this moment." ' '

" Who must we yield to ? where are they?" says
Smith again. " Here they are," says he; "here is
our captain and fifty men with him, have been hunt-
ing you this two hours ; the boatswain is killed; Will
Frye is wounded, and I am a prisoner ; and if you
do not yield, you are all lost." .

. . 18 .. N 2
" Will they give us quarter then ?" says Tom Smith,
" and we will yield."----" I'll go and ask, if you pro-
mise to yield," says Robinson. So he asked the cap.-
tain, and the captain himself then calls out, " You
Smith, you know my voice, if you lay down your
arms immediately and submit, you. shall have your
lives, all but Will Atkins." .
_ Upon this Will Atkins cried out, " For God's sake,
captain, give me quarter: what have I done? they
have all been as bad as I," (which by the way was
not true either ; for it seems this WilLAtkins was the
first man that laid hold of the captain when they first
mutinied, and used him barbarously, in tying his
hands and giving him injurious language :) however,
the captain told him he must lay down his arms at
discretion, and trust to the governors's mercy, by
which he meant me; for they all called me governor.

In a word, they all laid down their arms, and beg-
ged their lives; and I sent the man that had parleyed
with them, and two more, who bound them all ;' and
then my great army of fifty men, which, particularly
with those three, were all but eight, came up and

' -,~ , seized upon them all, and upon their boat, only that I

kept myself and one more out of sight, for reasons of
state. '

Our next work was to repair the boat, and to think
of seizing the ship ; and as for the captain, now he
had leisure to parley with them, he expostulated with
them upon the villainy of their practices with him,
and at length, upon the farther wickedness of their
design; and how certainly it must bring them to this:
cry and distress in the end, and perhaps to the gallows.

,They all appeared very penitent, and begged hard
for'their lives : as for that, he told them they were
._ none of his prisoners, but 'the commander's of the

"island ; that they'thought they had set him on shore
in a barren uninhabited island ; but it had pleased
God so to direct them, that theisland was inhabited,
and that the governor was an Englishman; that he
might hang them all there if be pleased; but as he
had given them all -quarter, he supposed he would
send them to England, to be dealt with there as jus-
tice required except Atkins, whom he was command>>
ed by the governor to advise to prepare for death ;
for that he would be hanged in the morning.

Though this was all'a fiction of his own, yet-it had
its desired effect. Atkins fell upon his knees to beg
the captain to intercede with the governor for'his life;
and all the rest begged of him for God's sake, that.
they might not be sent to England. '

It now occurred to me, that the time of our deliver.
ance Was come, and that it would be a most easy
thing to bring these fellows in to be hearty in getting
possession of the ship ; so I retired in the dark from
them, that they might not see what kind of a governor
they had, andcalled the captain to me : when I called,
as at a-good distance, one ofthe men was ordered to
speak again and- say to the ca tain, " Captain, the
. commander calls for you ;" an presently the captain
replied, " Tell his excellency I am just a-commg."
This more perfectly amused thei'n ; and they all be. ' -
lieved that the commander was just by with his fifty

men. .
' Upon the captain's coming to me, I told him my
project for seizing the ship, which he liked wonder-
fully well, and resolved to put it in execution the next
morning.

But, in order to execute it with more art, and to be
secure" of success, I told him we must divide the pri-
soners, and that he should go-and take Atkins, and
two more of the worst of them, and send them pinion-
ed to the cave where the others lay : this was com-
mitted to Friday, and the two men who came on shore
with the captain. '

, They conveyed them to the cave, as to a prison',
, and it was indeed a dismal place, especially to men
in their condition. '

The others I ordered to my bower, as Icalled it, of
which I have given a full description; and asit was
fenceed in, and they pinioned,' the place was secure
enough, considering they were upon their behaviour

To these in the morning I sent the captain, who was
to enter into 'a parley with them; in a word, to try
them, and tell me, whether he thought they might be
trusted or no, to go on board, and surprise the ship.
He talked to them of the injury done him, of the con-
dition they were brought to'; and that though the
governor had given them quarter for their lives, as to
the present action, yet that if they were sent to Eng-
.land, they would all be hanged in chains, to be sure;
but that if they would join in such an attempt as to
. recover the ship, he would have the governor's engage-
ment for their pardon. .
- Any one may guess how readily'such a proposal
would be accepted by men in their condition : they
fell down on their knees to the captain, and promised
with the deepest imprecations, that they would be
faithful to him to the last drop, and that they should
owe their lives to him, and would go with him all
over the worl'l ; that they would own him for a father
to them as long as they lived. .

'.' Well," says the captain, " I must go and tell the
governor what you say, and see what I can do to
bring mm to .consem to it." So he brought me an
account of the temper hefound them in ; and that
he verily believed they would be faithful.

However, that we' might be very secure, I told him
he should go back again, and choose out five of them,
and tell them that they should see that they did not
want men ; but he would take out those five to be his ,
assistants, and that the governor would keepthe other
two, and the three that were sent prisoners to the
casde, (my cave)-as hostages for the fidelity of those
five ; and that if , they proved unfaithful in the execu-
tion, the tive hostages should be hanged in chains alive
upon the shore.

This looked severe, and Convinced them that the
governor was in earnest; however, :they had no way
left them but to accept it; and it was now the business
'of the prisoners, as much as of the captain, to per.
suade the other five to do their duty. -

Our strength was now thus ordered for the expedi-
tion: 1. The captain, his mate, and passenger. ' 2.
Then the two prisoners of the first gang, to whom,
having their characters from the captain, I had given
their liberty, and trusted them with arms. 3. The .
other two whom I kept till now in my bower: inion--
ed ; but, u on the captain's motion, had now re eased.
4..These ve released at last; so that they were twelve
in all, besides five we kept prisoners in the cave for
hostages. - ' .

I asked the captain if he was willing to venture
with these bands on board the ship: for, as for me,
and my man Friday, I did not think it was proper
'for us to stir, having seven men left behind; and it
was employment enough for us to keep them asun-
der, and SUpply them with victuals.

As to the five in the cave, I resolved to keep them
fast; but Friday went twice a day to them, to supply '
them with necessaries; and I. made the other two
carry provisions to a_certain distance, where Friday
was to take it. '

When I shewed myself to the two hostages, it was
with the captain, who told them, I was the person the
governor had ordered to look after them, and that it
was the governor's pleasure that they should not stir
any where but by my direction; that if they did, they
should be fetched into the castle, and be laid in irons;
so that as we never suffered them to see me as gover.
nor, so 'I now appeared as another person, and spoke
of the governor, the garrison, the castle, and the like,
upon all occasions. .

p The captain now had no difficulty before him, but
to furnish his two boats, stop the breach of one, and
man them; he made his passenger captain of one,
with four other men; and himself, and his mate, and
five more, went in the other: and they contrived
their business very well; for they came _up to the ship
about midnight. As soon as they came within call of '
the ship, he made Robinson hail them, and tell them
he had brought all 'the men in the boat, but that it '
was a long time before they had found them, and the
like; holding them in a chat, till they came to the
'ship's side ; when the captain and the mate, entering
first with their arms, immediately knocked down the
second. mate and carpenter with the but end of their
muskets ; being very faithfully seconded by their men,
they" secured all the rest that were upon the main and ,
quarter decks, and began to fasten the hatches to'
keep them down who were below; when the other
.boat, and their men, entering at the fore chains, se-
cured the'forecastle of the ship, and the skuttlc which
went down into the cook-room, making three men
they found there prisoners. , a .

When this was done, and all safe upon the deck,
the captain ordered the mate with three men to break
into the round-house, where the-new. rebel captain
lay, and, having taken the alarm, was gotten'up, and
with two men and a boy had gotten fire arms in their
hands; and when the mate with a crow split Open
the door, the new captain and his menfired' boldly
among them, and wounded the mate with. a musket-
ball, which broke his arm, and wounded two more of
the men, but killed nobody. '

The mate, calling for help, rushed, however, into
the round-house, wounded as he was, and with his
pistol shot the new captain through the head, the bul-
lets entering at his mouth, and came out again behind
one of his ears; so that he never spoke a word; upon'
which the rest yielded, and the ship w'as'taken effec-
tually, without any more lives being lost.

As Soon as the ship was thus secured,- the captain
ordered seven guns to be fired, which was the signal
agreed upon with me, to give me netice of his sue-
cess; which you may be sure I was very glad to hear,
having sat watching upon the shore for it, till near
two of the clock in the morning. '

Having thus heard the signal plainly, I laid me
down; and it having been a day of great fatigue to
me, I slept very sound, till I was something surprised
with the noise of a. gun; and presently starting up, I
- heard a man call me by'the name of governor, govern
nor; and presently I knew the captain's voice; when
climbing up to the top of the hill, there he stood, and
pointing to the ship, he embraced me in his arms:
"My dear friend and delivercr," says he, "there's
your ship, for she is all yours, and so are we, and all
that belong to her." I cast my eyes to the ship, and
there she rode within a little more than half a mile of
the shore; for they had weighed her anchor as soon
as they were masters of her; and the weather being
fair, had brought her to an anchor just against the
. mouth of a little creek; and the tide being up, the
captain had hrOught the pinnace in near the place
where I first landed my rafts, and so landed just at
my deer.

I was, at first, ready to sink down with the sur--
prise: for I saw my deliverance indeed visibly put
into my hands, all things easy, and a large ship just
ready to carry me away whither I pleaded to go: at
first, for some time, I. was not able to answer one
word; but as he had taken me in his arms, I held fast
by him, or 1 should have fallen to the ground.

He erceived the surprise, and immediately pulled
a bott e out of his pocket, and gave me a dram of
cordial, which he had brought on purpose for me:
after I drank it, I sat down upon the ground, and
though. it brought me to myself, yet it was a good
while before I could speak a word to him. '

All this while the poor man Was in, as great an
ecstacy as I, only not under any surprise, as I was;
and he said -a thousand kind tender things to me, to
com use and bring me to myself; but such was the
doc of joy in my breast, that it'put all my spirits
into confusion; at last it broke into tears, and in a.
little While after I recovered my speech.

'I'hen I took my turn, and embraced him as my
dolwerer: and we rejoiced together: I told him, I
looked upon him as a man sent from Heaven to de--
liver me, and that the whole transaction seemed to be '
a chain of wonders; that such things as these were the
testimonies weyhad of a secret hand of Providence
governing the world, and an evidence, that the eyes
' of an infinite Power could search into the remo'test
corner of the world, and send help to the miserable
whenever he pleased. ' .-

I forgot not to lift up my heart in thankfulness to
Heaven; and what heart could forbcar to bless Him,
who had not only in a miraculous manner provided
for one in such a wilderness, and such a desolate
condition, but from whom every deliverance must
always be acknowledged to proceed? - ~ '

When we had talked awhile,.the captain told me,
he had brought me some little refreshments, such as
the ship afi'orded, and such as the wretcheswho had
been so long his masters, had net plundered him of.

_Upon this he called aloud to ithe boat, and bids his
men bring the things ashore that were for the gover-
nor; and indeed it was a present, as if I had been
. one, not that I was to be carried along with them, but
as if I had been to dwell upon the island still, and
they. were to go without me. . ' '

First,.' he had.brought me a case of bottles full of
excellent cordial waters ;. six large bottles of Madeira
wine, the bottles held two quarts apiece; two pounds
of excellent good tobacco, twelve, good pieces of the
ship's beef, and six pieces of pork, with a bag of peas,
and about a hundred weight of biscuit.

He brought me also a box of sugar, at box offlour,
a bag full of lemons, and two bottles of lime-juice,
and abundance of other things: but besides these, and

.what was a thousand times more useful to me, he
brought me sir; clean new shirts, Six very good neck-
.cloths, two pair of gloves, one. pair of shoes, a hat,
and one pair of stockings, and a very good suit of
clothes of his own, which had been worn but very
little. In a word, he clothed me from head to foot.
a. It was a very kind and agreeable present, as any
one may imagine, mom in my circumstances; but
neVer, wasan'y thing inthe world of that kind-so um
pleasant, awkward, and uneasy, .as .it Was to me to
wear such clOthes at their first'putting on.

After these ceremonies passed, .and after all his .-

'good things V. were brought intomy little apartment,

we began to consult what was to be done withthe"

prisoners we had ;- for it was worth considering wire.
ther'We-rnight venture'to take them away with us or
no, especially two of them, whom we knew to 'be in-
corrigible and refractory to the last degree {and the
captain (said, he knew they-were such rogues, that
there was no obliging them ;'and if. he 'did carry them
away, it must he inirons, as malefactors, to be de--,
liv'ered over to justice at th'efirst English colony he
couid corneat; and I found that the captain himself
was very anxious about it. - ; . ,

Upon this, I told him,.that, if he desired it, I durst
undertake to bring the two men he spoke of _to make
it. their own re'cjizest that he should leave them upon
the island :' " I should be very glad of. that," says the
- captain, " with all my-he'art." . '

. "Well," ,'said 1,-"l will send for them, and ram,
with them for you :" so i caused Friday and the two'
hostages, for they were now discharged, their can>>

rades having performed their promise; I say, I caused
them to go to the cave,---aud briiig'up the five men,
pinioned' as they were, tothe bower, and. keep them
there till I came. ' ' ' , . '.

'After some time, 'I came thither dressed inmy new
habit, and now I was called governor again. Being
all met, arid the Captain with me; I caused the men;
to be brought before me", and I told them, 'I-had' hat
a fth account of their villanoUs behaviour to the cape
tain, and how they' had run away With theship, and
were preparing to commit farther robberies ;'; but that
Providence had ensnaredathem' intheir 0an ways,
and thatthey were fallen into the pit which they had
digged for others. ' '

I let them know, that by my direction the ship had
1.? . .

\
\

been seized, that she lay now in the road, and they
might see by and by, that their new captain had re-
ceived the rewardpt' his villany; for that they might
see him hanging at the yard-arm: that as' to them, I
wanted to know what they had .to say, why -I should
not execute them as pirates taken in the fact, as by
mydcommission they could not doubt I had authority
to o.- .

, One of them answered in the name of the rest, that

they had nothing to say but this, that when they were
taken, the captain promised them their lives, and they
humbly implored my mercy; but. I told them I knew

not what mercy to shew them; for, as for myself, I
had resolved to quit the island with all my' men", and
had taken passage with the captain to go for England:
and. as for the captain, he could- not carry them to

England, other than as prisoners in irons-to be tried
for mutiny, and running away with the ship; the
consequence of which they must'needs know, would
be the gallows; so that I could not tell what was best

' for them, unless they had a mind 'to take their fate in '
the island; if they desired that, I did not care, as I
had liberty to leave it; I had some inclination to give
them their lives, if they thought they could shift on
shore. ' They seemed very thankful for it; said they
would much rather venture to stay there, than to be
carried to England to be hanged; so I left it on that
issue. _ .

. However the Captain seemed to make some diffi-
culty of it, as if he durst not leave them there: upon Q
this I seemed to be a little angry with the captain, and
told him, that they were my prisoners, not his; ~and
that seeing I had offered .them so much favour, I 4
would be as good as my word; and that if he did not

' think fit to consent to it, I would set them at liberty =

as I found "them ; and if he did not like that, he might i

take them again if he could catch them. I

. Upon' this they appeared very thankful, and I ac.
cordingly set them at liberty, and bade them retire

into the wbods, to the place whence they came, and l
would leave them some fire-arms, some ammunition
and some directions how they should live very well,
if they thought fit. ' .

Upon this, I prepared to go on board the ship; but

told the captain, that I would stay that night to pre-
pare my things; and desired'him to go on board in
the meantime, and keep all right in the ship, and
send the boat on shore themnext day for me; ordering
him in the meantime to cause the new captain who
was killed, toibe hanged at the yard-arm, that these
men might'seephim. -
" When the captain was gone, I sent for the men up
to me to. my apartment, and entered seriously into
discourse with them of their circumstances: I told
them, I thought they had-made a right choice; that
if the captain carried them away, they would eer-
tainly be hanged : I shewed them their captain hang-
ing-at the yard-arm of the. ship, and told them they
had nothing less to eXpect. ' ' '

When they had all declared their willingness to
stay, I then told them I would let them into the Story
of my living there, and 'put them in the way 'df mak-
ing it easy to them: accordingly I gave them the
whble history of the place, 'and of my coming to it:
she'wcd them my tbrt-ifications, the wayI made my
. bread, planted my corn, cured my grapes; and, in a
word, all that was necessary to make' them easy. I
told them the stery of the sixteen Spaniards that were
to be expected; for whom I left a letter, and made
.. them promise to treat them in common with them-
' selves. " ~ - ' ' '

I left them my fire-"arms; viz. fiVe'muskets, three
fowling-piec,es, and three swords: I had about a bar-
rel of powder left; for after the first year'or ton
used but little, and wasted none. I gave them a dc-
. scription of the way I managed the goats, and direc-
tions to milk 'and- fatten them, to make both butter
and cheese. -. _ '

In a Word, I gave them every part of my own
story; and I told them, I would prevail with the cap-
eat LIFE AND ADVENTURES

tain to leave them two barrels of gunpowder more,
and some garden seed; which I told'tltem" I would '
have been ve'ry glad of; also 'I gave them the bag of
was which the captain had brought me to eat, and
_ bade them be sure to sow and increase them. ' ' '
Having done all this, I left them the next day, and
went on board the ship: we prepared immediately to
sail, but did not weigh that night: the next moming
early, two 'of the five men came swimming to the
ship's side, and making a most lamentable complaint
pf the. other three, begged to be. taken into the ship for
God's sake, for they should be murdered; and beg-
ged the captain to take them on board though he
hanged them immediately - t '

- Upon this the captain pretended to have no power
without me; but after some difliculty, and after their
solemn promises of amendment, they were taken on
board, and were some time after soundly whipped
and pickled; after which they proved very- honest
and .quiet fellows. " "

Some time after this, Iwent with the boat on shore,
the tide being up, with the things promised to the men,
to which the captain, at my intercession, caused their
chests and clothes to be added, which they took, and
were very thankful for; I also encouraged them, by

' telling them, that if it lay in my way to send a vessel
to take them in, I would not forget them; '
. When I took leave of this island, I carried on board
for relics the great goat-skin cap I had made, my um-
brella, and One of my parrots; also I forgot not to
take the. money I formerly mentioned,-which had lain
by me so long useless that it was grown rusty- or tar'
nished, and could hardly'pass for silver, till. it had
been a little rubbed and handled; and also the money
' I found in the wreck of the Spanish ship. '
And thus Ileft the island the nineteenth of Decem-
, her, as I found by the ship's account, in the year 1686,
after I had been upon it eight-and-twenty years, two
month, and nineteen days: hein'g'delivered from the
second captivity the same day of the month that I fire-t-
made my escape in the barcoglongo, from among. the
Moors of Sallee. ' ' ' _

' In this vessel, after a long voyage, I arrived in Eng-
land the eleventh of J une, in the year 1687; having
been thirty and five years absent. . ' A '

. When 1 came to England, I was a perfect stranger
to all the word, as'if I had-never been known there :
.my benefactor and faithful steward, whom I had left
in trust with my money, was alive, but had had great
misfortunes in the world, was become a widow the
second time, and very' low in the world : i made her
easy as to what she oWed .me, assuring her I would
give her no trouble; but on the Contrary, in gratitude
to" her former care and faithfulness to me, I. relieved
her as my little stock would afford, which at that
time would indeed allow me to do but little for her :
but I assured her I would never forget her former
kindness to me; nor did I forget her,twhen I had sufv
ficient to help her; as shall be observed in its place.
' I went down afterwwards into Yorkshire; but my
father Was dead, and my mother and all the family
extinct ; except that I found two sisters, and. two of
the children of one of my brothers : and as 1 had
been long ago given over for dead, there had been no
provision made for me, so that. in a word, I found
nothing to relieve or assist me; and that little money
1 Mill would not do much for me as to settling in the
wor -.
.4 I met with one piece of gratitude indeed, which I

did not expect; and this was that the master of the
ship, whom I had so happily delivered, and by the
same means saved the ship and cargo, having givena
very handsome account to the owners, of the manner
howl had saved the lives of the men, and the ship,
they invited me to meet them and some other mer-
chants concerned, and all together made me a very
handsome compliment upon that subject, and a pre-
sent of almost two hundred pounds sterling. ,

But after making several reflections upon the cir-

cumstances of my life, and how little way this wouldgo towards settting me in the world, I'resolved to go'-
to Lisbon, and see if I, might not come by some in-
formation of the state of my plantation in the Brasils,
and what was become of my partner Who, 1 had

. reason'tosuppose, had some years now given me over
for dead. , . . ' " . .

With this view I took shipping for Lisbon, where I
arrived in April following; my man Friday accom-
panying me very honestly in all these ramblings, and
proving a most faithful servant uponsall occasions.

When I came to Lisbon I found out," by enquiry,
and to' my particular satisfaction, my old, friend the
captain of the ship, who first took'me up at sea, oi?
the shore of Africa; he was now grown old and had .
left off the sea,.having fut his son "who was far frbm
a young man, into his s ip'; and who_still used the
Brasil trade. The old man did not know me, and,

indeed, I hardly knew him ; but I'soon brought my-
self to his remembrance, when I told=him who=I Was.

After some passionate expressions of our old ace.
quaintance, I inquired, you may be sure, after my

lantation and my partner; the'old man told me, he
Bad 'not been in the Brazils for about nine years; but
that'he could assure me, that when he came away,
my partner was living; but the trustees, whom I had
jomed with him, to take cognizance of my part, were
both dead ; that, however, he believed that I would
have a very good account of the improvement of the
plantation ;' for that. open the general belief of ' my
being cast away and drowned, my trustees had given
in the account of the produce of my part of the plan-
tation, to the proeurator fiscal; who had appropriated
it in case I never came to claim it, one third to the
king, and two thirds to the monastry of St. Augus-
tine, to be expended for the benefit of .the poor, and
for the conversion of the Indians to- the Catholic
.faith; but that if I appeared, or any one for me, to
claim the inheritance, it would be restored; only that
the improvement, or annual producition, being distri-
buted to charitable uses. could not be restored; hut 'he aesured. me, that the steward of the king's revenue
(from lands) and the provedore or steward of the
monastery, had taken great care all along, that the in.
cumbent, that is tosay my partner, gave every year
a faithful account of the produce, of which they re. ,
ceived duly my moi ety.'~' , '

I aksed him, if he knew to what height of improve-'
ment he had br'oizght the plantation {and whether he
thought it might be wOrth looking after; or whether,
on my going thither, I should meet with no obstruc-
tion to my possessing my just right in the moiety.

He told me, he could not tell exactly to what .de-
gree the plantation was improved ; but this he knew,
that my partner was growing exceeding rich upon
the enjoying but one half of it; and that, to the best
of his remembrance, he had heard, that the king's

' third of my part, which was, it seems, granted away
to sbme other monastry, or religious house, amounted
. to above two hundred moidores a year; that, as to
my being restored to my quiet poss'essien of it, there
was no question to be made of that, my partner being
alive to witness my title. and my name being also
enrolled in theregister of the country. Also he told
me, that the survivors of mytwo trustees were very
fair, honest people, and very wealthy, and he'believed
I would not only have their assistance.for putting me '
in possession, but would find a very considerable sum
of money in their hands for my accomt, being the
produce of the farm, while their fathers held' the trust,
and before it was given up,'as above, which, as he
remembered, was about twelVe years. -

I shewed myself a little concerned and uneasy at
this account, and inquired of the 'old captain, how it
came to pass that the trustees shbuld thus dispose of
my effects, when he knew that I had made my will,
and had made him the Portuguese-captain, my unia
versal heir, 6L0. ' ' .

He told me that was true ; but that, as there was ' '
no proof of my being dead, he could not act asexeo
cuter, until some certain account should come of my
death; and that, besides, he was not. willing. to inter.
meddle with a thing so remote : that it was true, he
had registered my will, and put in his claim _; and
could he have given any account of my being dead or
alive, he. would have acted by procuration, and taken
gossession of the ingenio, (so they called'the Sugar:

', ones) and had given his son, who was now at the

, .Brasils, order to do-it. . ' '

" " But," says. the old man,- " I, have one piece of
news to tell you,.which perhaps may not be'so accept-'
able to you asthe rest; and that is, that believing you
Were lost; and all the world believing so also, your
partner and trustees did offer to account to me in
your name, for six or eight of the first years of profit.

,gwhich I received; but there being at that time," says
he, " great disbursements for increasing the works,
building an ingenio, .and buying slaves, it didnot
amount to near so much 'as afterwardsit produced :
however," says the old-man, " I shall give you a true
account of what I have received in all, and how I
have'disposed of it." ' .. '

Aftera- few. days'farther conference with this an-
cient friend, he brought me an 'aCcount of the six' first _
years income of my plantation, signed by my partner,
and. the merchants' trustees, being always delivered
in goods; viz. tobacco in roll, and sugar in chests,
besides rum, molasses, &c. which is the consequence
of a Sugar-Work ; and _I found, by this account, that
every year the income considerably increased ; but, as
above, the. disbursement being large, the~suni at first
was small: hoWever, the old man let me see, that he
was debtor to me (but hundred and seventy moidores

- of gold, besides sixty chests of sugar, and fifteen dou-
ble rolls of tobacco, whichwere lost in his ship, he
having been shipwrecked coming home to Lisbon,
about eleven years after leaving the place.

. The. good man-then began to complain of his miSv

. fertunes, and how he had been obliged to make use
of my money to recover his losses, and buy him a
share in anew ship; " however, my old friend," says
he, " you shall not want-a supply in your necessity;
and as soon as my son returns, yowshall be fully saa .
tisfied." ' - . . .

, Upon this he pulls out an old pouch, and gives me
two hundred Portugal moidores in gold ; and givmg
me the writings ofhis title to the ship which his son
was gone to the Brasils in, of which he was a quarter
. part owner, and his son another, he puts them both
in my'hands for scourity of the rest.

I was too much moved with the honesty and kinda
ness of the poor man, to beable to bear this; and re-
membering'what he had done for me, how he had

.taken me up at sea, and how generously he had used

the on all occasions, and panicularly how sincere a
friend he was now to ine, I could hardly refrain weepC/
ing at what he said to me: therefore,>>firstl asked him
if his circumstances admitted him to spare so much
money at that time, and if it-would not straiten him?
He told. me he could not say but it might straiten him
'a little ;, but, however, it was my money, and I might
want-it more than he. '

Every thing the good man' said was full of afl'ec-
tion, and I could hardlyrefrain from tears while he
spoke. In short, 1 took one hundred of the moidores,
and called for a pen and ink ' to give him a receipt
for them ; then I returned him the rest, and told him,
if ever I had possession of the plantation, I would
return the other to him also, as indeed I afterwards '
did : and that,.as to the bill of sale of his part in his
son's ship, I would not take it by any means; but that
ifl wanted the money, I found he was honest enough
to pay me; and if I did not, but came to receive what
'he gave me reason to expect, I would never have a
penny more from him. '

When this was past the oldvman began to ask me
if he should put me in a method to make my claim to
my plantation. I told him, I thoughtto go over to it
myself. 'He said, I might do so if I pleased ; but
that if I did not, there were ways enough to secure

VOL '1. Q
my right, and immediately to appropriate the profits
to my use; and as there were ships in the river of
Lisbon, just. ready to go away to Brasil, he'made we
enter my name in a public'register, with his affidavit,
affirming upon oath that I was alive, and that I 'was
the-same person who teck up the land for the plant.
in the. said- plantation at first. '
his being regularly attested by a notary, and a
procuration affixed, he directed me to send it with a.
letter of his writing, to a merchant of his acquaint-
ance'at the place; and then proposed my staying with
him till an account came of the return. .
Never any thing was more honourable that the pro
ceedings upon this procuration; for in less than seven ,
months I received a large packet from the survivors
of my trustees, the merchants, on whose account I
went to sea, in which were the following particular
letters and papers enclosed. .'
First, There was the account current of the produce
of my farm, or plantation, from the year when their
fathers had balanced with my old Portugal captain,
beinor for six years ;"the balance appeared to be 1174

D .

_ moidores in my favour. .
Secondly, There was the account of four years more

' while they kept the effects in their hands, before the
government claimed the administration, as being the .
effects of a person not.to be found, which they call
cim'l death ,- and the balance of this, the value of the
plantation increasing, amounted to crusadoes, which -
made 3241 moidores. t 3
Thirdly, There was the prior of the Augustines ac-
count, who had reCeived the profits for above fourteen
years; but notbeing able to account forwhat was dis-
posed to the hospital, very honestly decl'ted he had
872 moidores not distributed, which he acknowledged
to my account. As to the king's part, that refunded
nothing. . - -. - -
' There was also a' letter of my parnter's, congratu.
lating me very affectionately upon my being alive;
giving me an account how the estate was improved,
' and what it produced a year, with 'a particular of the
number of squares, or acres, that it contained ; how '
planted, how many slaves there were upon it ; and,
making tWO-and-twenty crosses for blessings, told me .
he had said so many Ave Marias .to thank the Blessed
Virgin that I was alive ; inviting me .very passionately
to come over and take possession of my own, andin
the mean time to give him orders to whom he should
deliver my- efi'ects, if I did not COme myself ; conclud- '
ing with a hearty tender of his friendship, and that of
his family ; and sent me as a present, seven fine leo-
pards' skins, which he had, it seems, received from
Africa by some other ship which he- had sent thither;
and who, it seems, had made a better voyage than I.
He sent me also five chests of excellent sweetmeats,
and a hundred pieces of gold uncoined, not quite so
large as' moidores. . _

By the same fleet my merchant-trustees shipped me
1200 chests of sugar, 800 rolls of tobacco,'and the rest
of the whole account in gold. '

I might well say now, indeed, that the latter end
of Job was better than the beginning. It is impossi- ,
ble to express the'flutterings of my very heart, when
. I looked over these letters, and especially when I
found all my wealth about me; for as the Brasil ships
come all in fleets, the same ships which brought my
letters brought my goods -; and the effects werejsafe
in the Tagus before the letters came to my hand. In
a -word I turned pale, and grew sick ;, and had not
the old man run and fetched me a cordial, I believe _
the sudden surprise of joy had overset nature, and I
had died upon the spot. _ . ' - -

Nay. after that, I continued very ill, and was so ,
somehours, till a physician being sent for, and some-J
thing of the real cause of my illness being known,- he
ordered me to be let blood, after which I had relief,
and grew well ; but I verily believe, if it had not beeri
eased by the vent given in that manner to the spirits,
I ' should have died. - '

I was now master, all an a sudden, of above fifty
thousand pounds sterling in money, and had an estate, .
as I might well call it, in' the Brasils, of above a thou-
sand pounds a year,'.as sure as an estate of lands in
England; and, in a word, I was in a condition which
I scarce knew how to understand, or how to com-
pose'myself for the enjoyment of. - '

The first thing I did was to reocmpense my origi:
nal benefaotor, my good old captain, Who had been
first charitable to me in my distress, kind to me in the
beginning, and honest to' me at the end. ' I shewed
liimall that was sent me; Itold him, that, next to
thexprovid'ence of Heaven, which disposes all things,
it was o'wing' to'him ;-and'that it now' Ia on me to;
reward him, which I would do a hundre -fold. So I
first returned to him-the hundred moidores I had re-
ceived of him ; then I sent for a notary, and caused
him to draw up ageneral release ore-discharge for the.
four hundred and seventy moidores, which he had
acknoWledged he owed me, in the fullest and firmest
manner possible; after which I caused a procuration
to be drawn, empowering him to he my receiver of'
...the annual profits of my lantation, and appointing '
my partner to account to im, and-make'tharetums
by the usual fleets to him in my name"; and a Clause
in the end being a grantof one hundred moidores a.
year to him during his life, out of the effects; and
fifty moidores a year to his son after him, for his life.
And thus I requited my old man. - .

I was now to consider Which way to steer, my _
course next and what to do with the estate that Pro-
vidence had thus put into my hands ; and, indeed, I
had more care'upon m'y-head now than I 'had in my
silent state of life in the island, where I wanted no--
' hing but what 1 had, and had nothing but what K
wanted ; Whereas I had new a great charge upon me
and my business was how to secure it; I had never:
cave to hide my money in, or a place where it might
lie without lock or key, till it grew mouldy and tar-
nished before any body would meddle with it. On
macaw-Mary! knew not where to put it or whom
to trust with it; 'my old patron, the captain, indeed,
was honest, and that was the only refuge I had.

'In'thenext place, my interest in the Brasils seemed
to summon me thither; but'now I could not tell how
to think: of going thither till I had settled my affairs,
and leftgmy effects in some safe hands behindme;
At-first'I thought of my oldfriend the widow, who,

.i I knew, was honest, and would be just to me; but

ithen'shewas in years, and but poor, and, for aught I
knew, might be in debt; so that, in a word, I had
no way but to gobacklto England myself, and take - .
my effects with me. ' . - t. ' _ ~

I was some months, however, before I resolved
upon this; and therefore as I had rewarded the old
captain fully, and to satisfaction, who had been my
former benefactor, so I began to think of my poor
widow, whose husband had been my first benefactor,
and she, while it, was in her mower, my faithful
steward and instructor. So the first thingI did, I got
a merchant in Lisbon to write to his correSpondent-

- in London, not only. to pay a bill, but to go find her
out, and carry her in money a- hundred pounds from
- me, and to talk. with her, and comfort her in her po.
'verty, by telling her she "should, if I lived, have a
farther supply. At the same time I sent my two sis.
tors in the country, each of them a hundred pounds,
they being, though not in want, yet not in very good
circumstances; one having been married, and left a
widow ;-and theother having, a husband not so kind
to her as he should he. , '
. But among all'myr'elations or acquaintances, I
could not yet pitch. upon one to whom I durst com-
mit the gross of my stock, that I might go away to
the Brasils, and leave things safe behind me; and-
this greatly perplexed me.

I had once a mind to have goneto the Brasils and
have settled myself there, for I was, as it were, natu-
ralized to the place; but I had some little scruple in
rhymintl about religion, which insensibly drew me
back, of which I shall say more presently.- However,
it was not religion that kept me from going thither
for the present; and as I had made no 'sc'ruple of be-
ing openly of the religion of the country,'all the while
I- was among them, so neither did I yet ;: only that

' now and then having of late thought more of it than
formerly, when I began to think of living andldying
among .them, I began to regret my havingpro'fessed
myself a Rapist, and thought it might not'be the best
religion to die in. . -

' But, as' I have said, this was not the main thing
that kept me from going to the Brasils, but that really
I did .nOt know with whom to leave my efi'ects be-
hind me; so I resolved at last to go "to England with
them, where if I arrived, I concluded I should make
some acquaintance, or find some relations, that would -
be faithful to me; and accordingly I prepared to go

for England with all my wealth; '

In Order to prepare things for my going home, I
first (the Brasi] fleet being just going atvay) resolved
to give lanswers suitable to he just and faithful ac?
count of things I had from . ence; and first to the
prior of St. Augustine I wrote a letter full of thanks
for hisju'st dealings, and the offer of the eight hundred
and seventy-two moidores, which was undisposed of

-which I desired might be 'given,'five hundred to the

. monastery, and three- hundred and seventy-two to the

' poor, as the prior should direct, desiring the good
'adre's prayer for me, and the like. .. . -

I wrote next a letter of thanks to' my two trustees,
with all the acknowledgement that. so much justice"
and-honesty called" for; as for sending them' any pre--
sent, they were far abovehaving any occasion of it.

' Lastly, I wrote to my partner, acknowledging his-
industry in the improving the plantation, anthis in-
tegrity in increasing the stock Of the works, 'giving
him instructions for his future government of my part '
according to the. powers I had left with my old pa-

- tron, to whom I desired him to' send whatever became
due to me, till he should hear from me more particu-

larly; assuring him, that it was my intention, not
only to come to him, but to settle myself there for the
remainder of my life. To this I added a very hand-
some present of status Italian silks for his wife and
two daughters, for such the captain's son informed me
'he had; with two pieces of fine English broad-cloth,
the best I couldget in_LiSbon, five pieces ofblack
bays, and some Flanders lace of a good value. .4

. Having thus settled my affairs, sold my cargo, and
turned all my effects into- good bills of exchange, my
next difficulty was, which 'way to go .to England. I
had been accustomed enough to the sea, and yet I had
a strange aversion .to go to. England by sea at that
time"; and though I'could. give no reason forit, yet
the dilfibulty increased upon me so much, that though
I hadonce shipped my baggage in order'to go, yet I
altered my mind, and that not once,'but two or three
times. \ . -

It is true, I had been very unfortunate by sea, and
this might be one of the reasons. But let no man .
slight the strong impulses of his own thoughts in cases
of such. mement, Two-of. the ships which lhad"sin-
gled. out to go in, I mean- more particularly singled
out than any other, that is to say, so as in one of.them
to put my things .on board, and in the other to have
agreedwith the captain; Isay, two of these ships
miscarried, \iz. one was taken by the Algerines, and
the other was cast away on the start, near Torbay,
and all the people drowned except three; So that in
either of these vessels I had been made miserable,
and in which most, it was hard to say. .

Having been thus harrassed in my thoughts, my old
pilot," to whom I communicated every thing, pressed '
me earnestly not to go to 588.; but either to go by
land to .the Groyne, and cross over the Bay of Bisca
to Rochelle, from whence it was but an easy and sa e
. journey by land to Paris, and so to Cailis and Dover;
. or to go up to Madrid, and so all the way by land
. through France. " ' ' ., ' ~ '

In a Word, I was so preposse'ssed against my going
by sea at all, except from Ca'dis to Dover, that I>.
296 - LIFE AND ADVENTURES

resolved to travel all the way by land; which, as I
was not in haste, and did not value the charge, was
by much the pleasanter way; and to make it more so,
my old..captain brought an English gentleman, the
son o'fa merchant in Lisbon, who was willing to travel
with me; after which, we picked up two who were
English, and merchants also, and two young Portu-
guesegentlemen, the last going to Paris only: so that
we were in all six of us, and five-servants, the two
merchants and the two Portuguese 'contenting'them-
. selves with one servant between two, to save the
charge ; and as for me, I got an English sailor to tra-
vel with me as a servant, besides my man Friday,
who was too much a stranger to be capable of sup.
- plying the place of a servant upon the road. - ~~
In this manner I set out from Lisbon : and our
company being all very well mounted and armed, we
_ made a little troop whereofithey did me the honour
to call me captain, as well-because I was the oldest
mad, as because I had two servants, and indeed was
' the original of the whole journey. _ .r .
As' I have troubled you withnone of my sea jour-
nals, so shall I trouble you with none of in land
journals. But some adventures that happene to us
in this tedious and difficult journey, I must not omit. ,
When 'we came to Madrid, we, being all of us
strangers to Spain, were. willing to stay some time to
see the court of Spain, and to see what was worth ob,
serving; but it being the latter part of the summer,
we hastened away, and set out from Madrid about the
middle of October. But when we came-to the edge
of Navarre, we were alarmed at several towns on the .
way, with an account that so much snow was fallen
on, the French side of the mountains, that several tra.
vellers were obliged to come back to Pam peluna, after
having attempted, at an extreme hazard, to pass on. '
.When we Came to Pampeluna itself, we found it so
indeed; and to me that had' been always used to 'a _
hot climate, and indeed to countries where we could
scarce bear any clothes on, the cold was insufferable;
nor indeed was it more painful than it was surpris>>
ing: to come but ten days before out of the Old Cas-
tile Where the weather was not only warm, but very
hot, and immediately to feel a wind from the Pyre-
nean mountains,-so very keen, so severely cold, asto
'he intolerable, and to endanger benumbing and. per-
ishing of ourfingers and toes, was very strange. i ~

'Poo'r Friday was really frighted when he saw the
mountains all covered with snow, and felt cold Weav
ther, which he had never seen or felt before in his life.

To' mend the matter, after we came to'Pampeluna,
it continued snowing with so much violence, and so
long, that the people said, winter was come before its
time; and the roads, which were difficult before, were
now quite impassible: in a word, the snOw lay in
some places too thick for us to travel ; and being not
hard frozen, as is the case in northern countries, there
was no going without being. in danger of being buried .
alive every step. We staid no less than twenty days .
at Pampeluna; when (seeing the winter coming on,
and no likelihood of its being better, for it- was the
severest winter all over Europe that had been known
in many years) I proposed that we should all go away
to Fontarabia, and there take shipping for Bordeaux,
which 'was a very little voyage. .

But while we were considering this there came in

. four French gentlemen, who, having been st0pped on
the French side of the passes as we were on the Spa-
nish,had found out a guide, who traversing the coun-
try near the head of Languedoc, had brought them
over the mountains, by such ways, that they were not
much incommoded with the snow ; and where they
met with snow in any quantity, they said it was fro>>
zen hard enough to hear them and their horses.

We sent for this guide, who told us, he would un-
dertake to carry us the same way, with no hazard
from the snow, provided we were armed 'sufliciently
to protect us from wild beasts -: for he said,-upon these
great snows it was frequent for some wolves to' shew

go .03
- themselves atthefoot'of the mountains, being made
' ravenous for want of food, the ground being covered
',with snow, We told him. we were well enough we '
. pared for such creatures as they were, if he would.
~ ensure us from a kind of two legged wolves, which we
' were told we were in most danger. from, especially on
the French side of the mountains. . ' .

Hesatisfied us there was no danger of that kind
in the we that we were to go ': so we readily agreed
to follow im ; as did also ,twelve- other gentlemen,'
with their servants,.some French, some Spanish, who,
2191 said, hadattempted to go, and were obliged to
come back again. - .

Accordingly we all set out from Pampeluna, with
.our guide, on the fifteenth of November; and indeed
I was surprised, when, instead of going forward, he
came directly back with us, on the same road'that
we came from" Madrid, above twenty miles; when
having passed two rivers, and come into the plain
country, we found ourselves in a warm climateagain,
where the country was pleasant, and no snow to be
seen; but on a sudden, turning, to the left, be ap-
proached the mountain another way ; and though it is
true, the hills and the precipices looked dreadfully, yet
he made so many tours, such meanders, and led us
by such w'indingways, we insensibly passed the height
of the mountains without being much encumbered
with the snow; and all on a sudden he showed us the
pleasant fruitful provinces of Languedoc'and'Gas-
coigne, all green and flourishing; though indeed they

', ' were at a great distance, and we had some rough

way to pass yet." '

We were a little uneasy, however, when we found
it snowed one whole day and a night, so fast, that we
could not travel ; but be bid us-be easy, we should
soon be past it -all : we found, indeed, that we began
, to descend every day, and to come more north than

before; and so, depending upon our guide, we went on.

.It was about two hours before night, when our

guide being something before us, and not just in sight,

ornoemson causes. _ .299.

out rushed three monstrous wolves, and after them a
hearput of the hollowway adjoining to' a thick-wood.
Two of the wolves flew upon the guide, and had he
been half a mile before us, he had been devoured <<in.
deed, before we could have helped him; one of them
fastened upon his horse and the other attacked the
~ man with that violence, that hethad not time, or net
- pretence of mind enough, to draw his pistol, but halo
. ooed and cried out to us most lustily. My man .Frio

day being next to me, I bid him ride up, and see
what was thelmatter. As soon as Friday came in
' sight of the man,,he hallooed, as loud as the other,
" 0 master! 0 master l" But, like a' bold fellow,
rode directly up to the man', and with his pistol shot
the wolf that attacked him in the head, -

. It was happy for the poor man that it was my man
Friday; for he having been used to that kind of crea-
ture in his c'ountry,had no fear. upon him but went _
close up to him, and shot him as above; whereas any '
of us would have fired at a farther distance, and have
perhaps either missed the wolf, .or endangered shout-
ing the mam _ . _

But it was enough to have terrified a holder man
than I, and indeed it alarmed all our company, when,
with the noise (if Friday's pistol, we heard on both
sides the dismallest howlings of wolves, and the noise
redoubled by the echo of the mountains, that it was
to us as if there had been a prodigious multitude of
them ; and perhaps indeed, there was not such a few,
as that we had no cause of apprehensions.

' , However, as Friday had killed this wolf, the other,

that had fastened upon the horse, left him immediate.
. ly, and fled, having happily fastened upon his head,
where the bosses of the bridle had stuck in his teeth.
so that he had not done him much hurt: the man, iii-
deed, was most hurt ; for the raging creature had' bit
him twice, once on the arm, and the other time a little.
above his knee ; and he was just as it were tumbling
down by the disorder of the horse, when Friday came
up and shot the wolfi ' '
It'is easy to suppose, that at the noise of Friday's
pistol we all mended our pace, and rid up as fast as
' the way (which was very difficult) would give usleave,
' to see what was the matter. As' soon "as we .came
' clear of the trees, which blinded him before, we saw
' plainly what had been the case, and how Friday had
disengaged the poor guide; though we did not present-

' 3y discern what kind of creature it- was he had killed.

'But never was a fight managed so hardily, and in
' such a surprising manner, as that which folldwed be-
tween Friday and the bear, which gave us all (though
~ at'>>.first we were surprised and afraid for him) the
greatest diversion imaginable. As' the bear is a heavy,
_ clumsy creature, and does not gallop as the wolf does,
which is swift and light'; so he has two particular
qualities, which generally are the rule 'of his actions:
first, as to men, who are not his prOper prey, I say
not his proper prey, because though I can't'say 'what
excessive hunger might do; which was now their case,
the ground being all covered with snow ; yet as to
' men, he does not usually attempt them, unless they
first attack him ; on the contrary, if you meet him in
the woods, if you don't meddle with him, he won't
meddle with you ; yet then you must take care to be
very civil to him, and give him the road ; for he-is a
very nice gentleman, he wen't go a step out of the
way for a prince; nay, if you are really afraid, yo'ur
- best way is to look another way, and keep going on;
. for sometimes if you step, and stand still, and look"
steadfastly at him, he takes it for an affront; and if
you throw or toss any thing at him, and it hits him,
though it were but a bit of stick as big as your finger,
he takes'it for an affront, and sets all other business
'aside to pursue his revenge; for he will have satisfac-
, tion in point of honour, and this is his first quality ;
the next is, that if he be once affronted, he will never
leave you, night or day, till he has his revenge, but
follow-at a good round rate till he overtakes you.
My'man Friday had delivered our guide, and when
we came up to him, he was helping him off from his
horse; for the man was both hurt and frighted, and'
indeed thelast more than the first; when on a sud;
den, we espied the bear come out 'of the wood, and a _
very monstrous one it was, the biggest by far that ever
I 'saw; we WereaII a little, Surprised when wesaw~
him; but when Friday saw him, it was easy to see
joy and courage in- the fellow's countenance: 0! 0'!
0!" SaysFriday. three times, pointing to him, "0
master! you give me ,te leave, me shakee te hand
with him, me makee you good laugh." .
I was surprisedto see the fellow so pleased: "-You'
fool you," said I, he will eat .you up,"---" Eatee
me up ! eatee ine up i" says Eriday twice over again;
" me' eatee him up ; me make you good laugh; you
all 'stay here, me shew you good laugh." So down
he sits, and gets his boots off in a moment, and put
on a pair of pumps, (as we call the flat shoes they
wear) and. which he had in his pocket, and gives my,
other servant his horse, and with his gun away he
flew, swift like the wind. .
The hear .was walking softly on, and offered to _
meddle 'with nobody, till Friday coming pretty near, '
calls tohim, as if the bear could understand him:
'f Hark ye, hark ye," says Friday, " me Speakee wiz .
you." We followed at a distance; for now being
come down to the Gascoigne side of the mountains,
we were entered a vast great forest, where the coun-
try was" plain, and pretty Open, though manytrees in '
it scattered here and there. _
Friday, who had,'as we say, the'heels of the bear, '
came up with him quickly, and takes up a great stone,
and throws at him, and hit him just on the head;
but did him no more harm than if he had throWn it
against a wall; but it answered Friday's end; for the
regue was so void of fear, that he did it. purely to
make the bear follow him, and shew us some laugh,

as he called it. -

As soon as the bear felt the stone, and saw him, he
turns about, and comes after him, taking devilish long
strides, and shuffling-along at a strange rate, so as he. 302 LIFE Ann grovrmnmrs

Would put a horse to a middling gallop. Away runs
Friday, and takes his course, as if he ran towards us
for help; so we all resolved to fire at once upon the
bear, and deliver my man; though [was angry'at'
him heartily for bringing the hear back upon us, when '
he Was going about his own business another way;
and eSpecially I was angrytha'the had turned the bear
upon us, and then run away; and I called out" You
' dog," said I, "is this your making us laugh? Come
away, and take your herse, that we may shoot the'
creature." He hears me, and cries Out, " No shoot,
no shoot, stand still, you get much laugh :" and as the
, nimble creature ran two feet for the beast's one he '
turned on a Sudden, on one side of us, and seeing a
great oak tree, fit for his purpose, be beckoned us. to
follow, and doubling his pace, he gets nimbly up the '
tree, laying his gun down upon the ground, at about '
live or six yards from the bottom of the tree. _ ,-

The bear soon came to the tree, and we followed
at a distance. The first thing he did, he stapped at
the gun, smelt to it, but let it lie, and up he scrambles
into the tree, climbing like a cat, though so monstrous
heavy. I was amazed at the folly as I thought it,
of my man, and could not for my life see any thing
to Ian h at yet, till seeing the bear get up the tree, we-
all ro e nearer to him. - ,

When we came to the tree, there, was Friday got-
'out to the Small of a, large limb of the tree, and the
bear got about half way to him. As soon as the bear "
got out to that part where the limb of the tree was
weaker, " Ha," says he to. us, " now you see me
teacheeth'e'bear dance ;"~ so he falls a-jumping, and
shaking the bough, at which the bear began to totter,
but stood still. and began to look behind him,_'to See
how he should get back; then indeed-we did laugh
heartily. But Friday had not done with him by a
great deal: when he sees him' Stand still, he bails out
to him again, as if he had supposed the bear could
speak English, "What you come no farther? Pray
you come farther." So he left jumping and shaking
the hough _; and the bear, just as ifhe understood what _
. he said, did come a little farther; then he fell a-jumpo
in'g again, and the bear stopped" again.
We thought now was a good time to knock him on'
the head. , and called to Friday to stand still, and-we
would .shoot the bear; but 'hecried out earnestly, .
" 0 pray! O pray! no shoot, me sheet by and then ;"
he WOuld have said by and by. However, to shorten
the story, Friday danced so much, and the bear stood '
so ticklish, that we had laughing enough indeed, but
Still could not imagine what the fellow would do; for'
first we thought he depended upon shaking the bear
Off; and we found. the bear was too cunning for'that
too; for he would not get out far enough to be thrown
down, but clings fast with his great broad claws and
feet, so, that we could not imagine What would be the
end of it, and where the jest would be at last.
But Friday puts us out'of doubt quickly; for seeing
the bear cling fast to the bough, and that he would
not be persuaded to come any farther; " Well; well,"
said Friday, " you no come'farther, me go, me go;
you no come to_ me, me come to you ;" and upon this '
he goes out to the smallest end of the bough, where
it would bend with his weight, and gently lets himself
down by it, sliding down the bough, till he came
near enough to jump down on his feet; and away he
ran to his gun, takes it up, and stands still. .
'4 Well,".' said I to him, "' Friday,,l_._what will you
do now? Why don't you shoot hind--4" No shoot,"
' says Friday, " no yet; me' shoot now me no kill;
me stay, give you one more laugh ;" and indeed so
he did, as you will see presently; for'wlien the bear
saw his enemy gone, he come back from the bough
where he stood, but did it mighty leisurely, looking
behind him every step, and coming hackwardtill'he
got into the body of the tree; then with the same
hinder end. foremost, he came down the tree, grasping
it with his claws, and moving on'e foot at a time,
very leisurely, At this juncture,' and 'ust before he

cauld set his hind feet upon the ground, riday merged

'-
close to him, clapped the muzzle of his piece into his
ear, and shot him as dead as a stone. - y ' ' .
- .Then the rogue turned about to see if 'we did not'
laugh; and when he saw we were pleased by our
looks, he falls a-laughing himself very loud ; 9.80 We
kill bear in my country," says Friday. " So you'kill
them 5'" said I; f' why, you have no guns."-+-" No."
says he, " no guns, but shoot great much long arrow."

This was, indeed, a good diversion to us; but we
were still in a wild place, and our guide very much
hurt, and what to do we hardly knew: the howling
of wolves ran much in my head; and indeed except
the noise I once heard on the show of Africa, of which
I have said something;- already, I never heard any
' thing that filled me with somuch horror.

These things, 'and the approach of night, called us
Off, or else, as Friday would have had us, we should
certainly have taken the skin of this monstrous crea-
ture off, which was worth saving; but we had three
leagues to go, and our guide hastened us; so we left
him, and went forward on our journey. ' - '

The ground was still covered with snow, though
not so deep and dangerous as on the mountains; and
the ravenous creaturesfas we heard afterwards,- were
come down into the forest and plain country, pressed
by hunger, to seek for food, and had done a great
' deal of mischief in the villages, where they surprised
the country-people, killed a great many of their sheep
and horses, and some, people too. ' .- . , -

We had one dangerous place to pass, of which our .
guide told us, if there were any mOre woliIesin the
country, we should find them there; and this was a
small plain, surrounded with woods on every side,
, and a long narrow defile or lane, which we were to
pass to get through the wood; and then we should
come to the village where we were to lodge. . '

. It was within half an hour of sunset, when we en-
, tered the first Wood; and a little after sunset, when
We came into the plain. - We met with nothing in the
"first WOod", except that in a little plain within. the
wood, which was' not above two furlongs over, we
saw five great wolves cross the road, full speed one
after another, as if they had been in chase of some
prey, and had it in view ; they took no notice of us,
and were gone and ,out' of sight in 'a'few moments.

A Upon this our guide; who, by the \'way, was a
wretched faint-hearted fellow, bade us keep in a'ready
posture ; for he believed there were more 'wolves

.a-commg. - ,
We kept our arms ready,.and our eyes about us ;
but we saw no more wolves till we came through that
_ wood which was near half .a league, and entered the
plain: as soon as we came into the lain, we had oc-
: gcasion enough to look about us. T e first object we
met with was a dead herse, that is to say a poor horse
which the wolves had killed, and at least' a dozen of
them at work ; we could not say eating of him, but
picking of his bones rather; for they had eaten up all
the flesh before. ' . _.

We did not think fit to disturb them at~their'feast,.
neither did theytake much notice of us ; Friday would
have let fly at them, but I would not suffer him by
any means; for Ifound we were like to have more
business (upon our hands than we were aware of. We
were not half gone over the plain, but we began to
hear the wolves howl in the woods, on our left, in a
frightful manner ; and presently after we saw about a
hundred coming on directly towards us, all in a body,

, and most of them in 'a line, as regularly as an army
drawn up by experienced officers. I scarce knew in
what manner to receive them' ; but found to draw our-
selves in a close line was the only way; so we formed
.in a moment ';..but, that we might-not havettoo much
interval, I ordered, that only every other man should
fire ; and that_the others, who had not fired, should
stand ready to give them a second volley immediate-
ly if they continued to advance upon us; and that
then those who had fired at first, should not pretend
to load their fu'sils again, but stand ready, with every
one a pistol, for we were all armed with a fusil and a' '
pair of pistols each man; so.we were, by this method,
able to fire six vollies, half of us at a time; however,
at present we had no necessity ; for,~upon firing. the
first volley, the enemy made a 'full step, being terri-
fied, as wellwith the noise as with the tire ; four of '
themlbeing shot in the head, dropped; several others
were wounded, and went bleeding off, as we could see:
by the snow. I'found they stopped, but did not ,im-,
mediately retreat; whereupon, remembering than!
. had been 'told that the fiercest creatures were terrified
at the voice of a man, I caused all our company to
hallpo as loud as we-could, and I_ found the notion
not altogether mistaken; for upon our Shout, they he~'
gan to retire, and turn abopt; then I ordered a second
volley to be firedin their rear, which put them. to the
gaIIOp, and away they went to the woods. " - -

This gave us leisure to charge Our pieCes again, and
that we' might lose no time, we kept doing; but we .
-had but little more than loaded our fusils, and put our.
selves into a readiness, when we heard a - terrible .
noise in the same wood on our left ; only" that it was
farther Onward the same way we were to go.

The night was coming on, and the night began to
De dusky, which made it the worse on our side ; l but,
the noise increasing, Wecould easily perceive that it
was the howling and yelling of those hellish creatures ;
and, On a sudden, we perceived, two or three troops of
wolves on our left, onebehind us,and one on our front, '
so that we seemed to be surrounded with them ; how~' - .
ever, as they 'did notfallnpon us, we kept our way
forward, 'as fast as We could make our .horses go,
which, the way being very rough, was only a good
large trot; and in this manner we only came in view

.of the entrance of the wood through which we were
to pass at'the farther side of the plain; but we were
greatly surprised, when. coming near the lane, or pass,
we saw a canfnsed number of wolves standing just at
the entrance. '

On a sudden, at another Opening of the mind, we
heard the noise of a gun _: and, looking thatway, out

I
rushed a horse, with 'a saddle and a "bridle on him,
flying'like the wind, and sixteen or seventeen wolves
after him full speed : indeed the. horse had the heels
,of them ;- but as we supposed that he could not hold'
it at that rate, we doubted not but they would get up
- With'him at last; and no question but they did. - '
Here-we had a most horrible sight; for, riding u
to the entrance where the horse came out, we foun
the carcass of another horse, and of two men devour-
ed by these ravenous creatures, and of one the man
was no doubt the same whom we heard fire a gun,
tor'there lay a gun just by him fired off; but as to the
man, his head, and 'th'e'upper part of his. body, were'
eatenup.' ' ,. . . , . _
This filled us with horror, and we knew not what .
course to take; but the creatures resolved us soon, for
they gathered about us presently, in hopes. of prey '; ,
and I verily believe there were three hundred of them..',
It happened very much to our adVantage, that at the
entrance into the Wood, but a little way from it, there
lay some large timber trees, which had been cut down
the' summer before,'and I suppose lay there for ear-
riage: I drew my little troop m among these trees,
and placing ourselves in a line behind one long tree, l
advised-them all to alight, and keeping that tree before
us for a. 'breastwork, to stand in a triangle, or three
fronts, enclosingour horses in the centre. , . .
We did "so, and it was well we did ; for never was
a more furious charge than the creatutes made upon
us in thisplace; they came on us with a growling kind
of a noise, and mounted the piece of timber (which, as
I said, was our breastwork, as if they were 'only rush-
ing upon their prey; and t is fury of theirs, it seems,
' "was principally occasioned by their seeing. Our horses .
behind us,' which was the prey they aimed'at. I 'or-
dered our men to fire as before, every man; and they
.took their aim so sure, that indeed they killed several
of the wolves at the first volley; but there was a_ ne-
cessity tc keep a continual firing, for they came on
like devils, those behind pushing on those before. '

\'.When we had'fired our second volley of fus'ils,_,we

' ' thought they stopped a little, and I hoped they 'would

have gone off, but it was but a moment, for others
came forward again; so we fired our vollies of pis-
tols; and I believe in these four ffirings we killed se-
venteen or eighteen of them; and lamed twice asma~
ny; yetthey came on again. ' '

I was loath tospend our last shot too hastily ; so I
called my servant, not my man Friday, for he was
better employed ; for, 'with the greatest dexterity ima-
ginable, he charged my fusil and his ohm, while we
were engaged ;' but, as Isaid, I called my other man ;
and gviving him a horn of pewder, I bade him lay a
train all along the piece ofttmber, and let it be a large
train ; he did so, and had but time to get away, when
the wolves came up to it, and some Were got up upon -
it; when I,' snapping an uncharged pistol close to the
powder, set it on fire ; and those that were Upon" the
timber were scorched with it, and six or seven of them
fell, or ratherjumped in among us, with the force and
fright of the fire : we dispatched these in an instant,
and-the rest were so frighted with the light, which the. '
night, for now it was very near dark made more ter-
rible, that they drew back a little. '

Upon which I ordered our last pistols to be fired
oti' in onevolley, and after that we gave a shout:
upon this the wolves turned tail, and we sallied imme-
diatel y Upon near twenty lame ones, which we found
struggling on the ground, and fell a cutting them with"
our sWords which answered our expectation; for the
crying and howling they made were better understood
by their felloWs ; so that they fled and left us.

We had, first and last, killed about three score of ' -
them; and had it been daylight, 'we had killed many
more. The-field of battle being thus cleared, we made,
forward again ; for we had Still near a league to go.
N'Ve heard the ravenous creatures howl and yell in the
woods as we went, several times; and sometimes we
fancied we saw some of them, but the snow dazzling
our eyes, we were not certain ; so in about an hour .
:m'ore we came to the town, where we were to lodge, '
~wh_ich we found in a terrible fright, and all in arms;
for, it seems, that, the night before, the wolves and
- some bears had broken into that village, and ut them
in a terrible fright '; and they were oblige to keep
guard night and day, but especially in the night, to
, preserve their cattle, and indeed their peeple. '
The next morning our guide was so ill, and his
limbs so swelled with the rankling of his tWo wounds,
that he could go no farther; so we were obliged to
take a new guide there, and go to Tholouse, where we .
'- found 'a warm climate, a fruitful pleasant country, and
no snow, n'o wolves, or any thing like them; but
when we told our story at'Tholuose, they told us .it
' was nothing but what was ordinary in the great forest
. at the foot of the mountains,especially when the snow
lay on the ground; but they inquired much what kind

" _ of a guide we had gotten, that would venture to bring

us that way in such a severe season ;' and told us, it
Was very much We were not all devbured. When we
told them him we placed ourselves, and the horses in
the middle, they blamed us exceedingly, and told us
it was fifty to one but we had been all destroyed: for t
it was the sight 'of the horses that made the wolves so ~
furious, seeing their prey; and that at other times they
are really afraid of a gun ; but they being excessive
hungry, andvraging on that account, the eagerness to
come at the horses had made them senseless of dan-
ger; and thatif we had not by the continued'fire, and
at last by the stratagem of the train of power, mas-
tered them, it had been great odds but that we had
been torn to pieces; whereas, had we been content'to
have sat still on horseback, and fired as horsemen,
they would not have taken the horses so much fortheir
own, when men \were on their backs, as othertv'ise;
and withal they told us, that at last, if we had stobd
all together, and left our horses, they would have been
so eager to have devoured them, that we might have
come off safe, especially having our fire-arms in our
hands, and being so many in number.
4 Fer my part, I was never so sensible of danger in
my life; for seeing above three hundred devils come

. roaring. and open-mouthed to devour us, and having , '

' nothing to shelter us, or retreat to, I gave myself over
for lost; and, as it was, I believe, I shall never care to
cross those mountains again; I think I would much
rath'er'go a thousand leagues by sea, though I were
.sure to meet with a storm once a week. 7 -

I have nothing uncommon to take notice of in my.
paSsage through France; nothing but what 'other tra-

' vellers have given an account of, with'much more ad.

vantage than I can. ' I travelled from ~Tholouse to

,Paris, and without any considerable stay came to
Calais, and landed safe at Dover, the 14th of J anu-

_ ary, after having had a severe cold season to travel in.

I was newcome to the centre of my travels, and
had in a little time all- my new-discovered estate safe
about me, the bills of exchange, which I brought

a with me, having been very currently paid. f

My principal guide and privy-counsellor was my'
good ancient widow, who,.in gratitude for the money

I had sent her, thought no pains too much, or care too
great, to employ for me; and I trusted her so entirely
with every thing, that I, was perfectly easy as to the
security of my effects; and indeed I was very happy
from my beginning, and now to the 'end, in the un-
'spotted integrity of this good- gentlewoman. . ~

- And now- I began to think of leaving my-efi'ects
with this woman, and setting out for Lisbon, and'so to
the Brasils. But now another scru le came'in the
way, and that was religion; for as I ad entertained

some doubts about the, Roman religion, even while I
Was abroad, especially in my state of solitude; sol

, knew there was no going'to the Brasils for me, much

less going to settle there, unless [resolved to embrace

the Roman Catholic religion, without any reserve;
~ except on the other hand I resolved to be a sacrifice to

' my principles, be a martyr for religion, and die in the
"Inquisition: so I resolved to stay at home, and, if I
could find means for it, to dispose ofmy plantation
To this purpose I wrote to my old friend at Lisbon,
who in. return. gave me notice, that he could easily
diSpose of it there :' but that if I thought fit to. give
him leave to offer it in my name to the two met. '
chants, the survivors of my trustees, who lived in the
Brasils, who must fully understand the value of it,
who lived just upon the spot,'and who I knew to be
very rich, so that he believed ' they would be fond of
buying ~it.;_ he did not doubt, but I should make 4 or
' 5000 pieces of eight the more of it. . '

- Accordingly I agreed, gave him orders to offer it

- to them, and he did so; and in about eight months .
more, the shi , being then returned, he sent me an ace-
count, that t ey had accepted the offer, and had re-
mitted 33,000 pieces of eight to a'correspondent of
. "theirs at Lisbon, to pay for it.

In return, I signed the instrument of sale in the
form which they sent from Lisbon, and sent it to'my
old man, who sent'me the bills of exchange for 32,800
pieces of eight for the estate; reserving the payment
of 100 moidores a year, to him (the old man) during
his life, and 50 moidores afterwards to his son for his
life, which I had promised them ; and which the Ian.
tation was to make good as a rentecharge. An thus
I have given the first part of a life of fortune and ad>>
venture, a life of Providence's chequerawork, and of
variety which "the world will seldom be able to shew
the like of: beginning foolishly, but closin much
more happily than any part of it ever gave 1 e leave .
so muchas to hope for. , _ ' ' .

Any one would think, that in this state of compli-

cated good fortune, 'I was ast' running any 'more
hazards, and so indeed'l ha been, if other circum-
stances nad concurred: but I was-inured to a wan>>
dering life, .had no family, nor many relatibns; nor

however rich, had I Contracted much acquaintance;
and though I'had sold my estate in the_Brasils, et I
could not keep that country out of my head, an had
a great mind to be upon the wing again; eSpecrally I
could not resist the strong inclination I had to see my
island, andto know? if the poor Spaniards were in being
there; and how the. rogues I'left'there had used them.
r My true friend the widow earnestly dissuaded me
from it, and so far prevailed'with me, that almost for
. seven ye'arsishe prevented my running abroad; dur-
ing-which time I to'okmy two nephews, the children
,of one of my brothers, into my care: the eldest hav-
ing something of his own, I bred up as a gentleman,
and gave him a settlement of some addition to his
* estate, after. my decease; the other I put out to a cap<<
tain of a ship; and after five years, finding him a sen-
) sible, bold, enterprising young fellow, I put himjnto
a good ship, and sent him to sea: and this young fel-
low afterwards drew me in, as old as I was, to far-
' ther adventures myself. .
In the mean time, I in part settled myself here : for,
first of all, I married, and that not either to my dis- ~
advantage or dissatisfaction; and had three children,
two sons and one daughter: but my wife dying, and
my nephew - coming home with good success from a
voyage to Spain, myinclination to go abroad,.and his
importunity, prevailed, and engaged me to g6 in his
ship as a private trader to the East Indies. This was
in the year 1694.

. In this voyage I visited my new colony in the
_ island, saw my successors the Spaniards, had-the whole
' story of their lives, and of the villians I left there;
how at first they insulted the poor Spaniards, how they
afterwards agreed, disagreed, united, separated,-and
. ' how at last the Spaniards were obliged to use violence
' with them; how they'were subjected to the S aniards;
. how honestly the Spaniards used them; an iistory, if ,

it were entered into, as full of variety and wonderful
accidents as my own part : particularly also as to their
battles with' the Carribbeans, who landed several times
upon the island, and as to the improvement they made
- Upon the island itself; and how five of them made an
attempt-upon the main land, and brought away eleven
men and five women prisoners; by which, at my com-
ing, I found about twenty young children on the island.
Here Istayed about twenty da'ys; left them any
plies oflall necessa ry. things, and p'articularly'of arms,

owder,' shot, clothes, tools, and two wtorkmen, whiCh'.

' brought from England with me; vim-fa" carpenter
andasmith. " . ' _'
. Besides this, I shared the lands into parts with them,
reserved to myself the property Of 'the whole, but
gave them such parts respectively, as they agreed on ;
and, having'settled all A' hinge with them, and"engaged
them not to leave the place, I left them there. . -

From thence I touched at the Brasils, from whence
I ,sent a bark, which I bought there, with more peo-
ple, to the island; and in it, besides other supplies, I
sent seven women, being such as I found proper for '
service, or for wives to such as would take them. As
to the Englishmen, I promised tith'em to send them

. some women from England, With a good cargo of_

necessaries, if they would apply themselves to plant-
ing ;T_ which I afterwards cauid net perform : the;fel-.
lows proved very honest and diligent, after they were
mastered, and had their preperties set apart {of-them.

' I sent them alsofrom the Brazils five cows, three of '

them being big with calf, some shteep,,and someho'gs,

. which, when I came again, weregcpnsiderably in-

creased. gray

But all these" things, with _an account how three
hundred Carribees came and invaded them, and ruin-

ed their plantations, and how they fought with that . '
' whole number twice,- and were at first defeated and

one Of them killed; but at last a storm destroying their
enemies'canoes, they famished or destroyed almost all
the rest, and renewed and recovered the possession of
their plantatiOn, and still lived upon the island ':--
All these things, with some very surprising incidents
in some new adventures of my own for ten years more,
I may, perhaps, give a farther account of hereafter.
