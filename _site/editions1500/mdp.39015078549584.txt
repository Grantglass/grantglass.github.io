clence in all the variety of our ch>
cnmftances, let them happen how
they will.

I Was born at York, iit the year 1^32, of a re-
putable family. My father was P. native of Bre-
men, who, by merchandifing at Hull for fome
time, gained a very plentiful fortune. He mar-
ried my mother at York, who received her firft
breath in that country: and as her maiden name
was Robinfon, I was called Rcblrfon 'Kreutznaer;
which not being eafily pronounced in the Englifh
tongue, we are commonly known by the name of
Crufoe.
I was the youngeftof three brothers. The eldeft
was a lieutenant colonel in Lockhart's regiment, but
fl.iin by the Spaniards: what became of the other,
I could never learn.
No charge nor pains were wanting in my educa-
tion. My father defigned me for the law; yet no'
thing would ferve me but I muft go to fea, both a-
gainft the will of my father, the tears of my mother,
and the entreaties of friends. One morning my fa-
ther expoftulated very warmly with me. What rea-
fon, fays he, have you to leave your native country,
where there muft be a more certain profpect of con-
tent and happinefs, to enter into a wandering con-
dition of uneafinefs and uncertainty? He recom-
..•'-. A mended
Amended to me Agur's wifh, Neither tt Je/ire poverty
nor rLfas; that a middle ftate of life was the moft
happy; rind that the high towering thoughts of
r/ifinp. our condition by wandering abroad, were
f in rquridtd with mifery and danger, and often end-
ed with confufion and difappointment. I entreat
yoifr oay, I command you, (fays he), to defift from
fJiO't intentions. Confider your eldeft brother, who
ii-.M down his life for his honour, or rather loft it
for his difobedience to my will. If you will go,
(rxdded he), my prayers fhall howevtr be offered for
your prefervation; but a time may come, when, de*
••lolate, oppreffed, or forfaken, you may wifh you
lud taken your poor defpifed father's counfel—He
-pronoanced thefe words with fuch a moving and
paternal eloquence, while floods of tears ran down
his aged cheeks, that it feemed to ftem the torrent
of my refolutions. But this foon wore off, and a
little after I informed my mother, that I could not
fettle to any hufinefs, my refolutions were fo ftron'g
to fee the world; and begged fhe would gain my
father'* corvfent only to go one voyage; which if
it did not prove proiperous, I would never attempt
a fecond. But my defire was as vain as my folly in
aflcing. My mother paffionately exprelTed her dif-
like of this propofal, telling me, That asihefdvi I
was bent upon my own deflruElton, contrary fo their
-will and my duty, Jhe would fay no more, but leave me
to inyjflf to do \uhatfe- ver Ipleaftd.
I was then, I think, nineteen years old, when one
time being at Hull, I met a fchool fellow of mine,
going along with his father, vho was mafter of a
Jhip, to London ; and acquainting him with my
wandering defires, he aflured me of a free paffage,
and a plentiful fhare of what was neceflary. Thus,
without imploring a blefllng, or taking farewell of
my parents, I took (hipping on the firft of Septem-
ber 4651. We fet fail foon after; and our fhip hail
fcarcc left the Humber aftern, when there arofe fo
\5oknt a ftorm, that, being extremely fea-tick, I
concluded the judgments of God defervedly foHow-
ed me for my difobediencc to my dear parents. It
was thea I called to mind the good advrce of my fa-
ther; how eafy and comfortable was a middle ftate
of life; and I firmly refotved, if it pkafed God to
fet me on dry land once more, I woold return to
my patents, implore their forgivenefs, and bid a
final adieu to my wandering inclinations.
Such were my thoughts while the ftorm continued;
.but thefe good resolutions decreafed with the dan-
ger; more especially when my companion came to
me, clapping me-on the fhoulder * What, Bob ! fard
he, fare you was not frightened laft night -with/caret a
• capful tf-anndf-^-And do yni, cried I, callfitfk a vio-
lent ftorm a -capful 'of-win:'? AJform, y«u fool you-,
faid he, this is nothing: a good Jhip Andfea-rooin al-
Koays baffles fuck afoelib fqual of uind as ihat: But
.you're a freib -water iailor t Come boy, turn out, fee
vihatiine -weather we have now, and a good bowl of
punch -witi drown all OH? pa/1 furrows. In fhort, the
puricti" was made, I was drunk, and in one night's
timeWbwned both my repentance and my good re-
folutions, forgetting entirely the vows and promifes
1 made in my diftrefs: and whenever any reflections
'would: return on me, what by company, and what
•by drinking, I foon maftered thofc fitsi as I derid-
ingly called them. But this only naade way for an-
-other trial, whereby I could not but fee how much
I was beholden to kind-providetice. •- 'i• .
Upon the fixth day we came to/ih anchor in Har-
wich road, <vhere we lay wind bound with fotne New-
caftlc fhips; and thete bemg good anchorage, and
our-cables found, the feanaen forgot their late toil
and clanger, and fpent: the time ras merry as if they
had been on fhore. But 6n the eighth day there a-
rofe a brifk gale of wind, which prevented our tid-
ing it up the river; and ftiH increafing, our fhip
code iorecaftle in, and Ihipped feveral large fe..s.
A * AK
.It was not long berore horror fcized the feamcn
<hemfelves, and 1 heard the mafter exprefs this me-
.Iancholy ejaculation, Lord have mercy upon us, -wejha.ll
he all hji .ind undote! For my part, lick unto death,
1 kept my cabin, till the univ«irfal and terribly dread-
ful apprehenfio.ns of our fpeedy fate made me get
-upon deck: and there I was affrighted inde.ed. The
.-fea went mountains high: I could fee npthuig but
diftrefs around us ; two fhips had cut-their mafts oa
board, and another was foundered: two more that
•had loft their anchors, were farced out to the mer-
x:y of the ocean; and, to fa-ve our livf s, we were
Jforced to cut our foremaftand mainmaft quite away.
Who is there fo ignorant as not to judge of my
.-dreadful condition? I was but a. frefh-water failor,
and therefore it feemed more terrible. Our fhip was
-very good, but overloaded; which made the failors
often cry o.ut, She would founder: Words I then was
lgnoraat of. -All this while the ftorm continuing,
and rather increafing, the mafter and the more fo-
i>er part of his men went to prayers, expecting death
every moment. In the middle of the night,pne.cried
.out, Ife Aiidfprunv a leak; another, That theft was
four foot water in thi hold. i was juft ready to ex-
.pire with fear, when immediately all hauds were call-
oed to the pump; and the men forced me alfo in that
extremity to fhar.e with them in their labour. While
*hus eniployed, the mafter efpying fome light col-
liers, fii-ed A gun a« a figiiali of diftrefs; and I not
underftanding what it meant, and thinking that ei-
ther tlie fiiip br^ke, or fome dreadful thjr.g hap-
pened, fell into a fwoon. Even in that'common
,.condition of woe,. nobody minded me, excepting to
'.thru ft me ailde with their feet, thinking me dead,
t, aiid it was a grCAt while before ,1 recovered.
. ilaopy it was for us,. when, upon the fignal given,
. they -ve#t)ire«l our thei? boat to fave our lives. All
cyir-pum,giag;ha<l b«*n in, vain, ^nd vain had all our
?.ue.nptsbce,i\. had they not come.to our fhip'sfiJe,
and
and our'meri caftltfcetn a rope idvtr the ftern wiih *
buoy to k, which after grebf labour they got hold o$
atid-we hauling -t&em to tw, got into their boat, and
left our (hip, which" fce perceitfed fink within lefs than
a quarter &( an hevif ;"and thws I -learned what was
meant by FcvthJering at fin. And new the men in-'
ceflantly laboured to recover th<ir own (hip"; but ther
fea ran fo high, and' the wind blew fx> hard, that
they thought it convenient to hitte within fhore ;.
which, with great difficulty and danger, at laft we
happily efixrcted, landing at a place called Cramer, not
far from Wintetton light-houfe; from whence we
all walked to Yarmomh, where, as objects of pity,
many good people furnifhed us whh neceflaries to
carry us either to Hull or Lor.dom
Strange, that after all this, lifce the prodigal fon,
I-tlid not return to my fatfeer; who, hearing of the
ftfip's calamity, for a long time thought me intombed
in the deep. No doubt- but I- Ihould have foared in
his' fatted calf, as tfte fcripmre cxprefleth it: but mf
ill fate ftill pvifhed me on-^ in fpire of the powerful'
convictions of reafon and confidence.
When wf had been at Yarmouth three days, I met
my old companion, who hat! given me the invitation
to go on board along with hi? father. His behavi-
Curand fpeech was altered, andin-a melancholy man-
ner alked me how I did, telling his father who I war:',
and how I had rnade this voyage for a trial only to-
proceed farther abroad. Upon which the old gentle-
man turoipg to-me gravely, faid, TPwng man, yon ought
never to go to fea any more, but to take thiifer a certain
fign that you -willnever proffer in a feafaring condition^
Sir, anfviered I, will you take the fame refolution } It
H a different cafe, faid he, -it is my. calling, and confe-
yuently my. duty; but tu you have made this voyage for
« trial, you fee -what illfuccefs heaven has fet- before your

•which I very freely declared mi whole ftory; at the
end of which he made this exclamation. Ye faere4
powers > what had I committed, that fuch a wretch
^iculd enter into my fhip, to heap upon me fuch a
«|eluge of mifcries! Put foon rccollefting his paffi-

upon it, -uAere-evfr yeu go, ym viiil meet viith dtfaf-
fers and difappoii,tments tilllevrfathtr'i viords artful-
jf/led upon you. And fo we parted.
I thought at finl to reiura home; but fhame op-
pofedihatgood motion, asthinkingl ftould be laugh-
ed at by my neighbours and acquaintance. So ftrange
is the nature of youth, who are not afhamed to fin,
tout yet afhamed to repent ^ and fo far from being a-
ibamed of thofe actions for which they may be ac-
counted fools, they think it folly to return to their
duty, which is the principal mark of wifdom- In
iJiort, I travelled up to London, refolding upon a voy-,
age; and a voyage 1 foon heard of, by my acquaintance
with a captain who took a fancy to me, to go to the
coali of Guinea. Having fome money, and appearing
like a gentleman, I went on board not as a common
failor or foremaft man ; nay, the commander agreed
J fhould go that voyage with him without any ex<
pence; that 1 fhouhd be his mefs mate i and compa-
nion, and I was vqry welcome to carry aiiy thing
with me, and make the beft merchandife I could.
I bleflcd try hippy fortune, and humbly thanked,
my captain for this ofier; and acquainting my friends
in Yorkfhire, forty pounds were lent me, the greateft
part of wlwch roy dear father and mother icootribiH-
fd to, with which I bought teys and trifles, as the
captain directed me. My captain alfo taught me na-
vigation, how to keep an account of the fhip's courfa
take an obfervation, and led me into the knowledge
of feveral ufeful branches of the mathematies. And
indeed this voyage made me both a f'ailor and a mer-
chant; for 1 brought home five pounds nine ounce*
of gold duft for my adveature, whiel* produced, ae
. A my
my return to London, almoft three hundred pounds.
But in this voyage 1 was extremely fitk, being
thrown into a violent calenture through excefTive
heat, trading upon the coaft from the latitude of
fifteen degrees north even to the line itftlf. '•
But alas! my dear friend the captain fcon depart-
ed this life after his arrival. This was a fenfible ^ri<f
to me; yet I refolved to go another voyage with hw
mate, who had now got command of the (hip This-
proved a very unfuccefsful one l for though I did not
carry quite a hundred pounds of my late acquired
wealth, (fo that I had two hundred pounds left,
which I repofed with the captain's widow, who wf.s
an honcft gentlewoman,) yet my- misfortunes in thin
unhappy voyage were very great. For our fhip fail-
ing towards the Canary iflands, we were chafed by n
Sake rover; and in "fpight of all the hafte we could
make, by crouding as much canvas as our yards could
fpread, or otir rftafts carry, the pirate gained upon us,
fo that we prepared ourIelves to fight. They hnti
eighteen guns, and we had but twelve. About three
in the afternoon there was a defperate engagment,
wherein many were killed and wounded on both
fides ; but finding ourfelves overpowered with num-
bers, our fliip disabled, and ourfelves too impotent to
have the leaf t hopes of fuccefs, we were forced to fur-
Kndtr, and accordingly vfere all carried prifoners in-
to the port of Salee. Our men were fent to the Em-
peror's court to be fold there ; but the pirate captain-
taking notice of me, kept me to'be his own flave.
In this condition I thought* tbyfelf the mof t miier-
able creature on earth,. and the'prophecy of my. fa.
ther came afrelh into my thoughts. However, my
condition was better than I thought it to be, as will
foon appear. Some hopes indeed I had that my new-
patron would goto fea again, where he might be ta-
ken by a Spanifh or Portuguefe man of war, and then
Iftould be fet at liberty. Batln this 1 was miftaken;
for he utver took me with him, but left me to lock-
A 4 after.
after his little garden, and do .the drudgery of h*
houfe ; and when he retnraed from fea, would make
me lie in the cabin, and look after the fhip. , I had
no one that I could communicate my thoughts to,
which were continually meditating my efcape; na
JSnglifhman, Irifhman, or Scotfman here, but my-
ieif; and for two years I could fee nothing pradti-
cable, but only pleafed myfelf with the imagination.
After fome length of time, my patron, as I found
grew fo poor, .that he could not fit out his fhip as u-
l'ual ^ and then he ufed conftaatly, once or twice a-
week, if the weather was fair, to go out a fifiiing,
taking me and a young Morefco boy to row the boat;
and fo much pleafed was he with me for my dexte-
rity iu catching the fifh, that he would often fend
ine with a Moor, who was one of his kinfmen, and
the Morefco youth, to catch a difh of fifh for him.
One morning, as we were at the fport, there arofe
fuch a thick fog, that we loft fight of the fhore: and
rowing we knew not which way, we laboured all the
iiight, and in the morning found ourfelves in th«
ocean, two leagues from land. However, we attain-
ed there at length, and made the greater hafte, be-
caufe our ftomachs were exceeding fharp and hun-
gry. In order to prevent fuch dilafters for the fu-
ture, my patron ordered a carpenter to build a little
ilate mom or cabin in the middle of the long-boat,
with a place behind it to ft.fer and haul home the
aiain fheet, with other conveniences to keep'him
from the weather, as alfo lockers to put in all man-
ner of provifions, wifh a .handfome fhoulder-of-
rnutton Iail, gibing ov^r the cabin. . ]
in this he frequently took us.out a fifhing; and
one time inviting two dr three perfons of diflinftion
to go with him, made provifion extraordinary, pro-
viding alfo three fufees with powder and fhot, that.
they might have fome fport at fowling along the lea-
coaft. The next morfcing the boat was made clean,
her aaciect an.d peadatna out, and every thing ren-.
dy;
;
df; but their minds altering, my patron ordered US'
to go a fifhing, for that his guefts would certainty
fop with him that night.
And nowl bcgan'to think- of my deliverance in--
deed. In order to this I perfuaded the.moor to gee-
ftme provifions on- board; as-not daring to meddle
with our patron's: and-he taking my advice we flo-;
red ourfelves with ruik bifeui'.. and three jars oPwa*
ter. Befid'es> 'I* privately conveyed into the boat a>
bottle of brandy, fome twine, thread, a hammer, hat-
chet. and'a faw; and in particular fome bees wax,
which was-a-greattonvfort to me, and ferved to make"
candles. T then perfuaded Muley (for f<^ was^the-Moor^
called) to procurefome powder-antl fhot, pretending7
to kill .fea -cwlieus; which he innocently and. readily
agreed .to. In fhort, being provided with-all things
neceflary, we failed •oat, refolving for n>y own part--
to make my efcape though it ifhould coftme-my life.
When we had paffcd the caftle, we-feltto filhing.;
but though I-knew ther&was a bite, I dHletnbltd the
matter, in order to put fdrtherout to fea. Accord^
ingly weran a-league furth«r.; when giving the boy
Ac helm? and'pretefltiing to fl-oap for fomething, I-
feized Muley by furprife, and threw- hka overboard.
As he vwis an excellent fwimriwr, he foon arofe, and^
made towards the beat-; upon which 1 teok out a«
fiiiee, and prefentedi it in him : Mutey^ faidl, Inevtr'
yttdejigned to do you any barmfandfteknothing-nc/w tut
my redemption. • I know yon ar&ttbte enough' iof-wim ta
fare, tmd-faveyour life\ but if yair are rcfohed to fol-
low me, tOi-th« endangering of mine< the very moment y*u=.
proceed I ,uiillikoou.yui through the head. The .harm-
Icfs creature, at thefe words, turned hinnfelf.from me*
and I make no doubt g«t fafe to landif l'hifen:«urn>
ing to the boy:Xuryj I pwreived-he-trembled at the
aftion; but 1. put him our oft aH <feap, telling him,i-
Aat if he would be true and faithful to me, I would*
do well by him. 4nJ there/ore, faid I, yen mujlJlraka

*lid the child then look, and with rach an'obliging
/-mile contented, that I readily believed him, and
from. that day- forwatd began to love him entirely.
We then purfued our voyage ; and left they fhould
tliink me gone to the Streights mouth, 1 kept to the
Southward to the truly Barbarian soalt • but in the
clulk of the svening 1 changed my courfe, and lleered
«3irce'tly S. and by E. that I might keep near the ihore-,
and having 4 frefh gale of wind, with a pleafanr
fmooth fea. by three o'clock next day I was 150 miles
beyond the tmptror of Morocco's dominions. Yet
tftill having the dreadful apprehenfiou of being reta-
Icen, 1 continued Iailing for five days fucceffively, till
fuch time as the wind fhifting to the fouthward, made
rne conclude, that if any veflel was in chacc of mc^
'hey would proceed no farther. After fb much fa-
tigue and thought, I anchored at the mouth of a lit-
tle river, I knew not what, oc where : neither did I
then fee any people. What I principally wanted was
freffc water; and 1 was refalvedabout the dufls to
fwim afhore. But no fooner did the gloomy clouJs of
night begin to fuccecd the declining day, than we
beard.fuch barking, roaring,.and howling of wild
creatures, that one might have thought the «ry
firangeA monftcrs of nature, or infernal fpirits, had
their refidence there. Poor Xury, almoft dead with
fear, entreated me not to go on fhore that night.
Suppefing J don't, Xury, faid I, and in the morning vie
fbouldfet men tuba ate vierft than tbofe tut fear-, what
then t 0 den vie may giv* (tern definot gun, replied Xv~
ry laughing, and de gun make dtm &11 run aviay. The
wit, and broken Englifh which the boy had learned
among the captives of our nation, pleated me entire-
ly ; and to add to his chearfulnef*, 1 gave hkn a dram.
of'he bottle; we could get buf little fleep all the night
for thofe terrible howling they made; and indeed
we were both very much affrighted^. when, bynbe
rollings
rollings of the water, and other tokens, we jufW"
concluded one of thofe inonfters made towards our
boat ! could not fee it tilt it came within two oars
lengthi when taking my fufee, I let fly at him. Whe-
ther I hit him or no, I cannot tell; but he made to-
wards the fhore, and-the noife of my gun increafcd*
the ftupendous noife of the monfters.
The next morning F was-refolved to go on Qiore
to get frefli water; and venture my life among the;
beafts or favages-, fhould either attack me. Xury laid,
ke would take one of the jars^ and bring me fome,
I afked him why he would go, and not 1 ?.The poor -
boy anfwered; If wild mans came, they eat'me, you g«
way. A mind fcarcely now to be imitated, fo con-
trary' to felf-prefervation, the moft powerful law of
nature! This indeed, increafed my affection to the
thiW.. Well, dear Xory, faid I, -wt -will both go aihore.
both kill -wi/d mant, and iteyfoall eat neither of its. So .
giving Xury a piece of ruik bread to ear, and a dram,
we waded afhorei carrying nothing with us but our'
arms, and' 'two jars for water.. 1 did not go out of
fight of the -boat, as dreading-the favages coming
down the river in- their canoes; but the boy feeing..
a-.low defcent or vale about a mile in the country, he
wandered to it; and- then running back to me with
great precipitation-, I thought he was purfued by
feme fuvage or wild beaft.; upon which I approach-
ed, refolv.ing.to periflv or protect him from danger. •
As he came nearer to'me, .1 faw fomething hanging
o-ver his fhonlders, which was.a creature he had 7ho:
like a hare, but different in colour, and longer legs;
however, we were glad of it, for it' proved wholr-
fome and noui ifhing meat; but what added to oiu
joy was, my-boy affured me there was plenty of wa-
ter, and that he fee no wild mans. And greater ftill
»w our comfort, when we found frefii water in the
creeki where we »ere when the tide was out, with-
out going fo far up into the country.
In this place I began to confidcr that the Canary
A 6
and Cape dc Verde iflands lay not far off; but ba-
ling no inftrument, I knew not what latitude, or
when to ftand off to fea for them;-yet-my hopes
were, I fhoulJ meet fome of the Englifh trading
•ve-iTels, -who would relieve and take us in.
•The place I was in was no doubt that wild coun-
try, inhabited only by a few, that lies between the
Umperor of Morocco's dominions and the Negroes.
It is filled with wild beafts, and the Moors ufe it for
hunting chiefly. From this place I thought I faw
the top of the mountain Teneriffe in the Canaries;
•which made me u y twice to attain it; but as often
was 1 drove back, and fo forced to purfue my for-
tune along fhore. r . .. -, „
Early one morning we came to an anchor under a
little point of land, but pretty high ; and the tide be-
ginning to flow, we lay ready to go further in. But
Xury, whofe youthful and penetrating eyes were
fharper than mine, in a ibft tone, defired me to keep
far from land, left we fhould be devoured: For ltx.K.
yonder^ meyter, faid he, and fee de dreadful monft/rfajl
ajletp o.'i de fide of de kill. Accordingly looking where
he pointed, I efpied a fearful monfter indeed. It was
a terrible great lion that lay on fhore, covered. as it
•were by a .(hade of a piece of the hill. Xury, faid I,
y&ujbftllgo. onibore and kill htm. liut the boy looked
amazed : Me kill him, fays he, he eat me at one moiitb-t
meaning one mouthful. Upon which I bid him lit
ilill, and charging my bipgeft gun with two flugs,
and a good charge of poxvder, I took the beft aim I
could ta fhoot him through the head ; but his kg ly-
ing over his cofe, the ftug broke his knee-bone.
The lion awaking with the pain, got up, butfoon fell
down, giving the rnoft hideous groan I ever heard:
but taking my fecond piece, I £hot him through the
head, and then he lay ftruggling for life. Upon diii
Xury took heart and defired my leave to go on ftiore.
.Go then, faid I. Upon which, taking a little gun m
one hand, he fwarn to fhore with the other, and co-
wing
miog dofe to the lion-, pat a period to- his life, by
ihooting him again through the head.
But this was fpending our ammunition in vain, the
fldh not being good to eat. Xury was like a cham-
pion, and comes on board for a hatchet, to cut off
the head of his enemy; but not having ftrength to
perform it, he cut off and brought me a foot. I be-
thought me however that his ikin would be of ufe.
This work coft Xury and me a whok day l when
fpreading it on the top of our cabin, the hot beams
of the fun effectual ly dried it in two days time, and
it afterwards ferved me for a bed to lie on.
And now we failed foutherly, living fparingly on
our proviGons, and went no oftener on fhor.e than we
were obliged for frefh water. My defign was to make
the river Gambia or Senegal, pr any where about ihe-.
Cape de Verde, in hopes to meet fome European
fliip. If Providence did not fo favour me, my next
courfe was to feek for the illands, or lofc my life a-
mong the Negroes. And in a word, I put my whole
ftrefs upon this; " Either that I muft meet w.uh>
"fome fliip, or certainly periih." -, - ; .t
One day as we were failing along, we faw people.
ftand on the fhore looking at us; we could alio per-
ceive they were black and ftark naked. 1 was in-
clined to go on fhore : but Xury cried, No, no; how-
ever I approached nearer, and I found they run a-
long the fhore by me a good way. They had no*
weapons in their hands, except one, who held-a long
ftick, which Xury told me was a lance, with which
they could kill at a great diftance. 1 talked to them.
by Cgns, and made them fenfible I wanted fomething
to eat; they beckoned to me to ftop my boat, while,
two of them ran up into the country, and inlefs
than half an hour came back, and brought with them,
two pieces of dry flefh, and (ome corn, which we
kindly accepted t and to prevent any fears on either
fide, they brought the food to the fhore^laid it down,

I
then went and ftood a great way off till we fetched'
it on board, and then came clofe to us again.
But while we were returning thanks to them, be-
ing all we could afford, two mighty creatures came
from the mountains, one as it were purfuing the o-
ther with great fury, which we were the rather in-
clined to believe, as they feldom appear but in the
rright; and both thefe Iwiftly paffing by the negroes,
jumped into the fta, wantonly fwimming about, as
though the diverfion of the waters had put a flop to •
their fiercenefs. At laft one of them coming nearer
to my boat ihan.I expected or defired, T'fhot him di«
re^tly through-the head ; upon which he funk-imme-
diately, yet riling again, would have willingly made
to the ihore; but between the wound and the ftrang-
ling of the water, he died before he could reach it.
It is impoffible to exprefs the confternation the
poor negroes-were in at thefiring of my gun ; much-
lefs can I mention their furprife, when they perceived
the creature to be flain by it. I made figns to them
to draw near it with a rope, and then gave it to them
to haul on fhore. It was a beautiful leopard, which
rn^de me defire its fkin; and the negroes feeming to-
covet the carcafe, 1 freely-gave it to them. As for-
the other leopard, it made to fiiore, and ran with a:
prodigious fwiftnefs out of fight. The negroes ha-
ving kindly furnifhtd me with water, and with whati
roots and grains their country afforded.,r I took' my'
leave, and, after eleven dap fail, came in fight of
the Cape de Verde and thofe iflands called by is name.
But the great diftance I was from ir, and fearing con-
trary winds would prevent my reaching them, I be-
gan to grow melancholy and dejected, when upon i
fudden, Xury cried out,. Mailer, mafler^ aibip vilth •
*f-M! and looked as affrighted as if it was his matter's
feip fent in fearch of us. But I foon difcovered fte
was a Pbrtugueze ftiip, as I thought, bound to the
coaft of Guinea for N egroes. Upon which I ftrove
for life to conae up to them, But vain had it been.
if through their perfpe&ive gUfies they had not per-
ceived me, and ilioriened their fail to let me come
up. Encouraged at this I let up my patron's ancient,
and fired a gun,.both as lignals of diftrefs; upon
which they very kindly lay to, fo that in three hours
time I came up with them. They (poke to me in Por-
tugueze, Spanifh, and French, but neither of thefa
did I uuderftand; till at length a Scots failor called,
and then I told him I was an I'.nglilhman, who had
tlcaped from the Moors at Salke; upon which they
took me kindly on board, with all my effects.
Surely none. can exprefs the inconceivable joy 1 ftlt
a; this happy deliverance! who, from being a late mi-
ferable and forlorn creature, was not only relieved,.
but in favour with the mafter of the fhip, to whom,

the ftricteft juftice in what be did, taking my things
into his pofllffion, and giving me an cxact inventory),
even to my can hen jars. lie bought my boat of me
for the fhip's ufe. giving me a note of eighty pieces•
•
of eight, payable at Brazil; and if any. body offered
more, he would make it up. tie alfo gave me lixty
pieces for my boy Xury. It was with great reluc-
tance I was prevailed upon to fell the child's liberty,
who had ferved me fo faithfully; but the boy was
willing himfelf; and. it was agreed, that after ten.
years he fhould be made free, upon his renouncing
Mahometifm, and embracing Chriftianity.
Having a plealant voyage to the Brazils, we arrived
in
in the Bay de Todos los Santos, or All Saints 837,
in twenty two days after. And here I cannot forget'
the generous treatment of the captain. He would'
take nothing for my paflage, gav-e me twenty ducats-
for the leopard's fkin, and thirty for the lion's. £-
v«ry thing he caufcd to- be delivered, and what I-
would fell he bought. In fhort, 1 made about 220
pieces of my «argo ; and with this ftock-1 entered-
once more as I may fay, into tire fcene of life.
Being recommended to an honcft planter, I lived1
with him till fuch time as I was informed of the man-
ner of their planting and making fugar; and feeingi
bow well they lived, and how fuddenl'y they grew7
rich, I was filled'with a defire to-fettle among them,
and refolved to get my money. remitted to me> and?
to purchafe a plantation.
To be brief, I bought a'Tettlement next door-to an.
lioncftS and kind neighbour, born at Lifbony of En«
glifh parents, whofe plantation joining to mine we
iiuproved k very amicably together. Both our.ftocks-.
were low., and for two years we planted only for-
food-: but tfoe third year we planted fome tobacco,,
and each of us drefled a' large piece ef- ground the.
enfuing yea* for planting. can«si 13ut now I found'
how much-1 wanted affiilance, and repented the lof«-
of my dear boy Xury. '''
Having none to affift me, my father's words came;
into my mind; and I ufed to aflft myfelf,-if what 1?
fought was onty a middle ftation of life*, why^could it?
not as well be obtained in Eiaglafld as-h«re ?-whei) t
pondered on this with regret, the thoughts of my-
late deliverance forfook me. I had none 10 converfe
vrhh but my neighbour ; no work to be. done bw^by
iny own hands; it often made me fay, my condition
was like to that of a man caft upon a defolate ifland.
So unhappy are we in our reflections* fo foi"getful
of what, good things we receive ourfelves, and fo
onthankful for our deliverance from thofe calamities
that others endure,
I was
I was in fotne meafure fettled, before the captain,
who took me up, departed from the Brazils. One
day I went to him, and told him what fiock I hid iri
London, defiring his affiftance in getting it remitted;
to which the good gentleman readily confented, but
would only have me fend for half my money, left it
fhould mifcarry; which if it didi I might ftill have
the remainder to fupporrme: and fo taking letters
of procuration from me, bid me trouble myfelf no
farther about it.. -'
And indeed wonderful was his kindnefs towards
me; for he not only procured the money I had
drawn for upon my captain's widow, but fent me o-
ver a fervant with a cargo, proportionable to my
condition. He alfo feht me over tools of all forts, iron
work, and utentils neceflary for. my plantation, and
which proved of the greateftufe to me in my bufinefs.
Wealth now accumulating on me, and uncommon
iuccefs crowning my profperous labours, I might
have refted happy in that middle ft ate of life my fa-
ther had fo often recommended; yet nothing would
content me, fuch was my evil genius, but I muft-
leave this happy ftauon, for a foolifh ambition in ri-
fing; and thus, once more, 1 caft myfelf into the
deepeft gulph of mifery that ever poor creature fell
into. Having lived four years in Brazil, I had not
only learned the language, but contracted acquaint-
ance with the.moft eminent planters, and even the
merchants of St. Salvadore ; • to whom once, by way
ofdifcourfe, having.given an account of my two
voyages to the coaft of Guinea, and the manner of
trading there for mere. trifles, by which we furnifh
our plantations with negroes, they gave fuch atten-
tion to what I faid, that three 'of them. came one
morning to me, and told me they had a fecret pro-
polal to make. After injoining me to fecrecy, (it be-
ing an infringement on the powers of the kings of
Portugal and Spain), they told me they had a mind
w lit out a fhip to go to Guinea, in order to ftoclo
the
the plantation with Negroes, which,'as they could
not be publicly fold, they would divide among them;-
and if I would go their fupercargo in the fhip, to
manage the trading part, I fhould have an equal
fhare of the Negroes, without providing any flock.
The thing indeed was fair enough, had I been in an-
other condition. But I, born to be my own deftroy
er, could not refift the propofal, but accepted the
offer, upon condition of their looking after my plan-
tation. So making a formal will, i bequeathed my/
effects to my good friend the captain^ ias my univer-
|al heir; but obliged him to dilpofc of my eft'ects as
tiire&ed, one half of the produce to himfclf, and the
other to be fhipped to £ngland.
The ihip being fitted out, and all things ready, we
Set fail the firft of September 1659, being the fame day
eight year I left my father and mother in Yorkihire^
"\We failed northward upon the couft, in order to gain
Africa, till wemade Cape Auguftine; from whence
going farther in the ocean, out of fight cf land, we
fleered as though we were bound for the iile Fernand,
de Norenba, kaving the iflands on the eaft; and then
it was we met with a terrible tempeft, which conii-
nued for twelve days fucceffively, ib that the winds
carrisd us wherefoever they pleaied. In this psrplex?
ity one of our men died, and one man and a bof
were waflied overboard. When the weather cleared'
up a little, we found ourfelves eleven degrees north.
latitude, upon the coaft of Guiana. Upon this the
captain gave reafons for returning; which 1 oppofed,
counfelling him to ftand away for Barbadoes, which,
as I.fuppofed, might be attained in fifteen days. So
altering our courfe, we failed north-weft and by weft
in order to reach the leeward iflands,; but a kcond
ftorm fucceeding, drove us to the waftward; fo that
we were. juftly afraid of falling into the hands of cru-
el favages, or the paws of devouring beafts of prey.
In this great diftrefs, one of our men, early in tha
Bxprning, cried out. Land,. land; which he had no-
'
foooer cried out, but our fhip ftruckupon a fand, and
in a moment the lea broke over her in fuch a man-
ner, that we expected we fhould all have perifhcd
immediately. We knew nothing where we were, OB
upon what land we were driven ; whether an ifland
or the main; inhabited or not inhabited; and we
could not fo much as hope that the (hip would hold
out many minutes, without breaking in pieces, ex-
cept the wind by a miracle fliould turn about imme-
diately. While we flood looking at one another,
expecting death every moment, the mate lays hold of
the boat, and with the help of the reft got her Sung
over the fhip's fide, and getting all into her, being
eleven of us, commiited ourfelves to God's mercy,
and the wild fea. And now we faw that this hi ft
effort would not be a fufficieat protection from death;
fo high did. the fea rife, that it was impoffible the boat
fhouid live. As to making fail, we had none; neither
if we had, could we make ufe of any. JSo that when,
we had rowed, or rather were driven about a league
and a half, a raging wave, like a lofty mountain,
came rolling aftcrn of us, and took us with fuch fu-
ry, that at once it overitt the boat. Thus being fwat-.
lowed up in a moment, we had hardly time to call
upon the tremendous name of God ; much lefs to im-
plore, in dying ejaculations, his infinite mercy tp re-
stive oar dcpaiting fouls.
Men are generally counted infenfible, when flrug-
gling in the pangs of death; but while 1 was over-
whelmed with water, 1 had the moil dreadful appre*
henfions imaginable. Fcr the joys of heaven and the>
torments of hell, feemed to prefept themfelvts before
me in tht(e dying agonies, and even (mall (pace of.
time, as it xvere, between life and death. 1 was go-
ing, I thought, I knew not whither, in a difmal gulf'
unknown, and as yet unperceived, never to behold-
my friends, nor the light of this world any more!
Could I even have thought of annihilation, or a total
iiflblutipn of fowl as well as body, the gloomy thought*
«£
of having no further being. no knowledge of what we
hoped fur, but an eternal quietus, without life of
fenfe"} oven' that, I fay, -would have been enough to
ftrike-'me with horYer and confufioh! 1 ft rove how-
ever to*ifhe hfl: extremity,• while all my companions
were Overpowered andr intorhbed in the deep : and it
was with great difficulty 1 kept my breath till the
wave fpent itfclf, and retiring back, left me on the
fhore half dead with the water I had taken in., AST
foon as I got oh my feet, I ran as faft as I could, left
another wave fhould purfue me, and carry me back
again.' But tor all the haftr I made, I could not avoidi
it; for the fea came after me like a high mountain,
or furious enemy ; fo that my butinefswas to hold my
breath, and by r^ifing myfelf on the water, preferve
it by fwimming. The next dreadful .wave buried me
at once twenry or thirty feet. deep, but at the fame
time carried me with a mighty force and fwif theft to*
ward the Ihore; when rahlng myfelf; .1 held oufat
well as poffible, till at length the water having fpent
Jtfelf, began to return, at which'I ftruck forward,
and feeling ground with my Feet, I took to my heels-
again. Thus being ferved twice more, I was at laft
dafhstl againft a piece of a rock, in fuch a manner as
I-eft me fer.felefs ; but recovering a little before the
return of the wave, which, no 'doubt, would then.
have overwhelmed me, I held faft by the rock tHt
thofe fucceeding waves abated; and then fetching
another run was overtaken by a fmall wave, which-
was foon conquered. But before any more could
overtake me, I reached the main land, where clam-
bering up the clifts of the fhore, tired and almoft
fpent, I fat down on the graft, free from the dangers
of the foaming oce-in. - • •
No tongue can exprefs the ecftafies and tranfpoits
that my foul felt at this happy deliverance. It was
like a reprieve to a dying malefactor, w-'th the halter
about his neck, and ready to be turned off. 1 wa'
wrapt op b coruemplatioo, and- often lifted up wf
.> hands
hands with. the profonndeft humilify, to.the divine
powers, for favlng my. life, when the reft qf my com-
panions were all drowned. Aud now I began to caft
my eyes around, to behold what place I was in, and
what I had next to do. I could fee no houfe nor
people: I was wet, yet had no doath$ to fhift.me;
hungry and thirfty, yei,nothing to eat or drink.; ,no
weapon to deftroy any creature for my fuftenanee,
nor defend myfelf againft devouring beafts ; in fhort,
1 bad nothing but a knife, a tobacco-pipe, and a box
half filled with tobacco. The darkfome night co-
ming upon me, increafed my fears of being devoured
by wild creatures; my mind was plunged in defpair,
andi having no profpecT, as I thought, of life before
me, I prepared for another^ kind of death than what
1 had. lately efcaped. I walked about a furlong to
fee if I could find any frefh water, which I did, to
my great joy; and taking -a quid of tobacco to pre-
vent hunger, I get up into a thick bufhy tree, and
feating myfelf fo that I could not fall, a deep fleep
overtook me, and for that night buried my fprrows
in a quiet repofe. . ,
It was broad day the next morning before I awa-
ked; when I not only perceived the tempeft was
ceafed, but faw the fhip driven almoft as far as the
rock before-mentioned, which the waves had daflied
me againft, and which was about a mile .from the
place where 1 was. When I came down from my
apartment in the tree, I perceived the fhip's boat two
miles diftant on my right hand, lying on fhore, as
the waves had caft her. 1 thought to have got to
her; but there being an inlet of water of about half
a mile's breadth between it and me, I returned again
towards the £hip,ias hoping to find fomething for my-
more immediate fubfiftance. About noon, when.the
fea was calm, ,that I could come within a quarter of
affiile of her, .\t was to my grief I perceived that if
we had kept on board, all pur lives had been faved,
IJiefe thoughts, and my iblitu.de,, drew tear* from
•7
my eyes, though all in vain. So refolving 10 get to
the fhip, I ftripped and leaped into the water; when
fwimming round her I was afraid I fhould not get
any thing to lay hold of; but 'n was my good fortune
to efpy a fmall piece of rope hangdown by the fore-
chains fo low, that, by the help of it, though with
great difficulty, I got intb the forecaftle of the fhip.
Here I found that the fhip was bulged, and had a great
deal of water'in her hold; her ftern was lifted up a-
Sainft a bank, and her head almoft to the water. All
fcer quarter, and what was there, were free and dry.
The provifions I found in good order, with which I
crammed my pockets; and, lofing no time, ate while
I was doing other things; I alfo found fome rum, of
whffcn I took a hearty dram; and now I wanted for
nothing except a boat, which indeed was' all, to car-
ry away what was needful for me.
Neceffity occafions qukknefs of thought. We had
feveral fpare yards, a fpare topmaft or twe, and two
or three large fpars of wood. With thefe I fell to
work, and flung as many of them over board as I
could manage, tying every one of them with a rope
that they might not drive away, This done, I went
down the (hip's fide, and tied four of them faft toge-
ther at both ends in form of a raft, and laying two
or three fhort pieces of plank upon them croffWife, t
found it would bear me, but not any confiderable
wtiAt. Upon which I went to work again, cutting
'a.fpare topmaft into three lengths, adding them ro
my raft with a gi'.eat desl of labour and pains. 1 then
confidered whit I fhould load it with, it being not
ahL- to bear a ponderous burden. And this I fpon
thought of, firft laying upon it all the planks and
boards I could'get; next I lowered down three of the
featnen's chefts, 'after I had filled them whh bread,
rice, three Dtitch cheefes, five pieces of dried goats
flefh, and fome European corn, what little the rats had
fpared; and for liquors, I found feveral cafes ofbot-
rles belonging to our fldpp?r, in witch were fome

cordial waters, and four or five gallons of rack, which
I flowed by ihemfelves. By this time the tide begin.
ing to flow, 1 perceived my ceat, waiftcoat, and
shin fwirn away, which I had left on the fliore; as
for my iinen breeches and ftockings, I fwam with
them on to the (hip: but I foon found cloaths enough,
though I took no more than I -wanted for the preient.
My eyes were chiefly on tools to work with; and,
after long fearch, I found out the carpenter's ehefr,
which I got fafe down on my raft. I then -looked for
arms and ammunition, and in the great cabin found
two good fowling-pieces, twopiflols, feveral powder-
horns filled, a fmall b ig of fhot, and two oid rufj,y
fwords. Z like wife found three barrels of''powder,
two of which were good, hut the third had taken wa-
ter; alfo two or three broken oars, two laws, an axe,
and a hammer. I then put to fea, and in getting to
fliore had three encouftgements. I. A fmooth calm
fea. a. The tide riling and fetting hi to the fhore.
3. The little wiod there was blew towards land. Af-
ter 1 had failed about a mile., I found the raft to drive
a little diftance from the place where 1 firft landed;
and then I perceived a little opening of the land,
with a ftrong current of the tide running into it; up-
on which 1 kept in the middle of the ftream. But
great was my concern, when on a fudden the fore-
part of my raft ran aground ; fo that had I not, with
great difficulty, for near half an hour, kept my back
training againft the chefts to keep my effects in their
places, all J had would have gone into the fea. But
after foroe time, the rifing of the water caufed the
raft to float again, and coming up a little river with
land on both tides, I landed in a little cave, as near
the mouth as poffible, the better to difco>rer a fail, if
any fuch providentially pafled that way.
Not far off, I efpied a hi'l of a flupencfous height,
furrounded with lefier hflb about it, and thitherf was
rtfolvedto go and view the country, that I might fee
what part was beft to fix my habitation in. Accord-
ingly
ingly arming tnyfelf with a. piftol; a fowling-piece,
powder and ball, I afcendcd the mountain. There
[ perceived I was in an ifland, encoinp,-vfled by the
-ea; no diilant lands to be feen,- but foatterkig rocks
hat lay to the weft: that it feemed to be a barren
ilace, and*, as I. thought, inhabited only by wild
iea^s. il perceived abundance of fowls, tlutigno-
-am of w^at kind, or whether good for nouri(hment.
. fhot one of them at my return, which occafioned a
:onfufed icreaming among the. other birds; and I
"ound ,1,1;,,,by i.ts colours and-beak to be a..kind of a
iawk, but its flefh was perfe& carrion.
When I came to my raft, I brought my effects on
hore, whi^h work fpent that day entirely; and feir-
ng that fqme cruel beafts might devour me in the
Tight time isvhjle I flept, I made a kind of hut or bar-
icade with the chefts and boards I had brought on
hore.. That^ight I ilept ve«y comfortably; and the
iext morning .my thoughts were employed to make
further. atten^pt on the fl>ip, and bring awayiwhat
iectfla-ries' I qould find, before another ftorm fhould
ireak lier to pieces. Accordingly I got on board as
icfore, and prepaired a fecond raft, far more nice
han the firft; upon which 1 brought away the car-
'enter's ftcres, two or three bags full of nails, a great
ick fcrew, a dozen or two of hatchets, and a grind-
:one I alfo took away feveral things that belonged to
be gunner, particularly two or three iron • crows,
wo barrels of mufltet bullets, another fowling-pkce,
fmall quantity of powder,.and a large bagful of
mall' fhot. iiefidos thefe, I took all the men's
loaths I could find, a fpare foretop fail, ahanamocfc,
nd fome bedding; and thus completing my fecond
argo, I made all the hafte to fhoie I CQuld, fearing
ime wild beaft might deftroy whc.t I had .there al-
eady. But I only found a little wild cat fitting on
ne of the chefts, who not feeming to fear me^ or
ic gun that I prefented at her, I threw her a piece
fbifcuit, which fhe inftan'.ly ate, and departed.
3 When
When I had gotten thefe effc&s on (hone, I went
to work, in order to make me a Hide tent with the
fail and fome poles which I had cut for that purpofe;
and having fimfhed it, what things might be dama-
ged by the weather i brought in, piling all the emp-
ty chefts and calks in a circle, the better to fortify
it againft any fudden attempt of man or beaft. Af-
ter this, I blocked up the doors with ibme boards,
and an empty cheft turned the long way out. I ihen
charged my gun and piftol, and laying my bed on
the ground, flept as comfortably, till next morning,
as though I had been in a Chriftian country.
Now, though I had enough to fubfift me a long
time, yet defpairing of a fudden deliverance, of that
both ammunition and provifion might be fpent be-
fore fuch a thing happened, I coveted as much as I
could; and fo long as the fliip remained in that con-
dition, 1 daily brought away onenecelTary or other;
particularly the rigging,fails,and cordage, fome twine,
a barrel of wet powder, fome fugar, a barrel of meal,
three cafks of rum, and, what indeed was moft wel-
come to me, a whole hogfhead of bread.
The next time I went, I cut the cables in pieces,
carried off a haulfer whole, with a great deal of iron
work, and made another raft with the mizen and
fprit-fail-yards; but this being fo umveildy, by the
too heavy burden I had upon it, and not being able
fo dexteroufly to guide it as the former, both my
cargo and 1 were overturned. For my part, all the
damage I fuftained was a wet fkin; and at low wa-
ter, after much labour in diving; I gpt moft of the
cables, and fome pieces of iron.
Thirteen days had I now been in the ifland, and
eleven times on board, bringing away all that was
poffible; and, I believe, had the weather been calm,
1 fhould have brought away the whole fhip piece by
piece. As I was going the twelfth time, the wind
begin to rife; however, I ventured at low water, and
rummaging the cabin, in a locker I found feveral ra-
B zors,
-zors, fciflnrs, and fome dozens of knives and forks;

iilver and gold. dhl Jtmple vur.ity, faid I, -whom this
tucrld fo much dotes on, wheie is now thy virtue, thy ex-
cellency to me? You cannot procure me one thing needful,
-nor remove me frow this defolate ijlandtoa place of plen-
ty. One of theje knives fo meanly eftecmed, is to me
more preferable than all this heap. E'en therefore remain
'where then art, 'to fink in the deep as unregarded, even
jis a. creature u'hofe life is rot -wcrth prefervhig. Yet,
.after all this exclamation, I wrapt it up in a piece of
canvafs, and began to think of making another raft;
-but I foon perceived the wind begin to arife, a frefh
i^ale blowing from the fhore and the fky overcaft
with clouds aiiJ darknefs: So thinking a raft to be
rln vain, I let myfelf in to the water with what things
I had about me; and it was with much difficulty I
.got afhore, when foon after it blew a fearful ftorm.
That night I flept very contentedly in my little
tent, furrounded with. all my eflicb; but when I
looked out in the morning, no more fhip was to be
feen. This much furprifed me for the prefent : yet
when I confidered I had loft no time, abated no
•pains, and had got every thing ufeful out of her, I
-comforted myfelf in the beft manner, and entirely
fubitted to the will of Providence.
My next thoughts were, how I fhould defend and
fecure myfelf from favages and wild beafts, if any
iuch were in the ifland. At one time I thought of
xligging a cave, at another I was for creeling a tent;
.and, at length, I refolved to do both: The manner
or form of which will not, I hope, be unpleufing to
•defcribe.
When I confidered the ground where I was, that
4t was moorifh, and had no frefli water near it, my
refolutions were to fearch for a foil healthy and well
watered, where I might not only be fheltered from
-the fun's fcorching heat, but be more conveniently
fituated, as well to be fecurcd from wild men, and
beafts,
....A.
beafts of prey, as more eafily to difcover any diftant
fail, fhould it ever fo happen.
And indeed it was not long before I had my defire.
I found a liitle plain hear a riling hill, the front to-
wards which being as lleep as a houfc-lide, nothing
could defcend on me from the top. On The fide of
•this rock was a little hollow place, refembling the en-
trance .or door of a cave. Juft before this place, 011
the circle of the green, 1 refolved my tent fhoulcl
ftand. This plain did not much exceed a hundred
uyards broad, and about twice as long, like a delight-
ful green before my door, with a pleafing though ir-
regular defcent every way to the low grounds by the
;fea fide, lying on the N. K. W. fide of the hill, fo
that it was fheltered from the exceffive heat of the
fun. After this I drew a femicircle, containing ten
yards in its femidiameter, and twenty yards in the
whole, driving down two rows of itrong fta-kci not
fix inches from each other. Then the pieces of
cable which I had cut on board, I regularly laid
in the circle ^between the piles up to their tops,
which were more than five feet out of the earth, and
after drove another row of piles looking within fide
againll them, between two or three foot high, which
made me conclude it a little impregnable caille for
men and bcafo. And for my better feiurity I would
have no door, but entered in and came out by the
help of a ladder, which I alfo made.
Here was my fence and fortrefs, into which -I car-
ried all my riches, ammunition, and ftores. After/
which, working on the rock, what with the dirt aml
ftories I dug out, 1 not only raifed my ground two
feet, but made a little cellar to my manlion-houfe;
and this coft me many days labour and pains. One
day in particular a fhower of rain falling, thunder and
lightning enfutd, which put me in terror left my
powder (hould take fire, and not only hinder my ne-
ceiiary fubfiftence, by killing me food, but even blow
up me and my habitation. To prevent which, I fell
13 z 19
•io making boxes and bags, in order to fepara'te it,
having by me near 150 weight. And thus being
eftablilheJ as king of the iihmd, every day 1 went
•out with my gun to fee what I could kill that was fit
-to eat. I loon perceived numbers of goats, but very
•fhy: yet having watched them narrowly, and feeing!
<:ould better fhoot them ofi'the rocks than when in the
Jow grounds, I happened to fhoot a fhe-goat fuckling
St. young kid ; which not thinking its dam flain, flood
t'y her unconcerned; and when I took the dead
•creature up, the young one followed me even to the
•inclofure. I lifted the kid over the pales, and would
-willingly have kept it alive; but finding it could not
be brought to eat, I was forced to flay it alfo for my
own fubfiftence.
- Thus entered into as ftrange a fcene of life as ever
4*ny man was in, I had moft melancholy apprehen-
rfions concerning my deplorable condition; and ma-
•ny times the tears would plentifully run down my
face, when I confidered how I was debarred from all
communkation with humankind. Yet wliile thefe
defponding cogitation would feem to make me ac-
eufe Providence, othergood thoughts would interpofe
and reprove me after this manner: Well, fuppofing
.you are defolate, is it not better to be fo than totally
perifh? Why were you fingled out to be faved, and
the reft deftroyed ? Why fhould you complain, when
riot only your life is preferved, but the fhip driven
tven into your reach, in order to take what was ne-
ceiTary out of her for your fubfiftence? But to pro-
ceed. It was, by the account I kept, the 3oth of
September, when I firft landed on this ifland. About
twelve days after, fearing left 1 fhould lofe my rec-
koning of time, nay, even forget the Sabbath-days,
for want of pen, ink, and paper, I carved withia knife
upon a large poft, in great letters, and fet it up, in
the limilitude of a crofs, on the fea fhore where I
landed, I came on ftx/re Sept. 30 1659. Every day I
(cut a notch with my knife on the fides of this fquare
poft,

poft, and that on Sabbath was as long again as the
reft; and every firft day of the month as long again
as that long one. In this manner I kept my calen-
dar, weekly, monthly, or yearly reckoning of time.
But had I made a more ftrict fearch, ( .s I did after-
wards), I net dec! not have fet up this mark. For an:onij
the parcels belonging to the gunner, c.irpentcr, and
captain's mate, 1 found thofe very things I wanted;
pitticularly pens, ink, and paper; aHb I found two
or three compaffes, fome mathematical inftrumentr,,
dials, perfpecYive glafTes, books of navigation, three
Ehglifh bibles, and feveral other good books, which
I carefully put up. Here I cannot but call to mind5
onr having a dog and two cats on board, whom f'
made inhabitants with me in my caAle. Xhitogh.
one might think I had all the neceflaries that were
defirable, yet ftill I found feveral things wanting. My
ink was daily waiting: I wanted needles, pins, and
thread to mend or keep my c'oaths together; a net-
particularly a fpade, pickaxe, or fhovel, to remove
the earth. It was a year before I finifhcd my liitie
bulwark; and having fome intervals of relaxation,-
after my daily wandering abroad for provifion, I
drew up this plan, alternately, as creditor and debt-
or, to remind me of the miferies and blefllngs of
nly life, u^der fo many various circumftances,

iage and door in the rock, which came out beyond
the pale of my fortification. I next procefdedto make
a chair and table, and /o began to ftudy fuch mecha-!

CEptembsr 30, 1659,1, unhappy R.obinfon Crufoe,
h.aving iuffered ibipwreck, was driven on this dcT-
folate iflind, which I named the Defolate Ifland of'
Defpair, the reft being (wallowed up in the iempef-
tuQus ocean. The next day I fpent in confideradoa
ef my unhappy circumftances, having no profpedt
but of death, either to be ftarved with hunger, or de-
voured by beafts or mercilefs favages.

panions, and our misfortune in leaving the vefTel.
When I perceived the fhip as it were lie dry, I wa-
ded: through the finds, then. fw-am aboard, the wea-

I fecured my goods from the inclemency of the wea-
ther.
Octob. 26. I wandered to fee where I could find
a place convenient for my abode. I fixed upon a rock
in the evening, marked out a half-moon, intending
to erect a wall, fortified with piles, lined within with
pieces of cables, and covered with turf.
Nov. i. I erected my tent under a rock, and took
lip my lodging very contentedly in a hammock that

Nov. 2. This day I fenced myfelf in with timber,
thefts, and boards.
Nov. 3. I fhot two wild fowls, refembling ducks,
\vliich were good to eat, and in the afternoon made
ffie a table.

ir,y return I perceived many wild birds, and was ter-
rified by fome feals which made oft'to fea. .
Nov. 6. Compleated my table.
Nov. 7. Fair weather. I worked till the nth,
t,ut omitted the nth, which, according to my cal-
culation, I fuppofed to be Sunday.
Nov. 13. Rain in abundance, which however
much cooled the earth, with thunder and lighining,
caufed in me a terrible furprife. The weather clear-
log, 1 fecured my powder in fcpnrate parcels.
Nov. 14.— 16. I made little boxes for my powder,
lodging them in feveral places. 1 alfo fhot a large
fowl, which proved excellent meat.

Nov. 17. I began to dig in the rock, yet was obli-

wheel-barrow. Iron crows I caufed to fupply the'
place of the firft; but with all my art I could noti
make a wheel-barrow. ,'
Nov. 18. It was my fortune to find'a tree, refem-
bling what the Brazilians call an iron-tree. I had'
like to have fpoiled my axe with cutting it, being ve-
ry hard and exceeding heavy; yet with much labour'
and induftry, I made a fort of a fpadeout of it.
Nov. 23. Thefe tools' being made, I daily carried
on my bufirtefs ; eighteen days Tallowed for enlarging'
my cave, that it might ferve me, not only for a ware--
h'oufe, but kitchen, parlour, and cellar. I commonly
lay in the tent, unlefs the weather was rainy that 1^
could not He dry. So wet would it be at certain fea- -
fbns,. that I was obliged to covef alb within the paler
with long poles, in the form of rafters, leaning a- -
gainft the rock, and load them with flags -and large r
leaves of trees, iefembling a thatch';

But aowa-xery Orange event happened. For be-
ing. in the height of my fearch, what fhould come in-
to my hand but a bag, which was ufed to hold corn,
(as I fuppofed for 'he fowls): fo immediately refol-
ding to pur gunpowder in it, I fhook all the hulks
and dirt upon one Iide of the rock, little expe&ing
wl.at the coiifetiiience would be. The rain had fal-
len plentifully a few days before ; and about a month
afier, to uiygieai amazement, lomething began to
Io.'k out very green and fli urifhing: and when I
came to view it more nicely, every day as it grew,
j found about ten or twelve ears of green barley.ap-
peared in the very fame fhape and make as that in
England.
1-can fcarce exprefs the agitations of my mind at
this tight Hitherto 1 had looked upon the actions
of this life, no otherwife than only as the events of
blind chance and fortune. But now, the appear-
ance of this barley, flourishing in a barren foil, and
my
irry LgnoBance in nof conceiving how it fhoulcj come
there, made me- conclude, that n}iracles \viere not yet'
ceaffd.: nay, I even thought that God had appointed
it to grow there without any feed, purely for my
luftenance in this-miferable and defolate ifland And
indeed fuch great effedl this had upon me, that it of-
ten. made me melt into, tears, through a grateful
fenfe of God's mercies ; and the greater ftill was my
thanhfulneis, when I perceived about this little field
of barley, fame. rice ftalks, alfo wonderfully flou-
rifhing.
While thus plqafed in. mind,, I concluded there
rauft be; more corn in the ifland ; and. therefore made
a diligent festrch narrowly among the rocks.; but
ttot being. able to find any., on a fudden it came intp
my mind, how I had fhaken the huflts of corn out
of the hag, and then my admiration ceafed, with
nay gratitude to. the Divine Being, as thinking it -wm
but natural, and not. to be conceived a miracle; the*''
even tbetniauner of its prefervation might have made
nae.o.wiiiit ^s.a wonderful evenrof God's kind pro-
•vidence..
It was^about the latter end of June when the ears..
of this corn ripened, which I laid up very carefully,
together with 20 or 30 ftalks of rice, expecting one
day.I fhould reap the fruit of my labour; yet four
years were expired before I could allow myfelf to eat
any barley bread, and much longer ii^e before I har*
any rice. After this, with indefatigable pains awl
induftry for three or four monthsi at Lift I finifhed
my walL on the 14th of April, having no way to go
into it, but by a ladder againft the wall.
April 16: I finifhed my ladder, and afcended it;
afterwards pulled it up, then. let it down on the o--
tber fide, and. defcended into my new habitation
where 1 had fpace enough, and fo fortified, that no-
thing could attack me, without fcaling the walls.
But what does all human pains and induftry avail!
bkffing of God do not crown our labours? Or,,
B 6 who .
•who can ftanct before the Almighty, when be
ffretcheth forth his arm? For one time, as I was at
the entrance of my cave, there happened fitch a
cfreadful earthquake, that not only the roof of the
cave came tumbling about my earf, but the pofts
feemed to crack terribly at the fame time. This put
in great amazement; and running to the ladder,
getting over the wall, I then plainly knew it was
earthquake, the place I flood on fuftaining three
rcrrible rfiocks in lefs than three minutes. But judge
of my tervor when I faw the top of a great rock
fO\\ into the fea; I then expected the iiland would
lye fallowed up every moment: And what made
the fcene ftill more dreadful, was to fee the fea
tbro-wn into the moft violent agitations anddiforders
\ty this tremendous accident.
For my part, I ftood like a criminal at the place
execution ready to expire. At the moving of
earth, I was as it were, fea-fick; and very much
Afraid left the rock, under which was my'fence and
iiabitation, fheuld overwhelm me and it in a lafting
•tomb.
When the third dreadful fhock had fpent itfelf, my
^-pirits began to revive: yet ftill I would not venture
t(j afeend the ladder, but continued fitting, not
lcnowing what I fhoukl do. 80 little grace had I
tlien, as only to lay, Lord have mercy upon me! and
i-,0 fooner was the earthquake over, but that pathe-
tie prayer left me. • ^
Jt was not long after, when a horrible tempeft a-
i-ofc? at the fame time attended with a hurricane of
wind- The fea feemed mountains high, and the
-vvaves rolled fo impetuoufly, that nothing could be
perceived but froth and foam. Three hours did this
itorm continue, and in fo violent a manner, as to
tear the very trees up by the roots, which was fuc-
cccded by abundance of rain. When ihe tempeft was
over, I went to my tent; but .the rain coming on in a
furious manner, i was obliged to take fheltcr in the
cave,
 
cave, where I was forced to cut a channel through
my fortification to let the water out. It continued
raining all that night, and fometime the next day,
Thefe accidents made me refolve, as foon as the wea-
ther cleared up, to build me a little hut in fome open
place, walled round to defend me from wild crea-
tures and favages; not doubting but, at the next
earthquake, the mountain would fall upon my habi-
tation and me, and fwallow up all in its bowels.
April 16. 20. Thefe days I fpent in contriving
how and in what manner 1 fhould fix my place of
abode. Ail this while I was under the moft dread-
ful apprehenfions. When I looked round my habi-
tation, every thing I found in its proper place. I
had fcveral refolutions whether I fhould move or
not; but at length I refolved to ftay where I was, till
I found out a convenient place where I might pitch
my tent.
April 22. When I began to put my refolutions in
practice, I was ftopt for want of tools and inftru-
rnients to work with. Moft of my axes and hatchets
were ufelefs, occafioned by cutting the hard timber
that grew on the ifland. It took me up a full week
lo make my grindftone of ufe to me; and at laft I
found out a way to turn it about with my foot, by
help of a wheel and a firing.

thirfty, yet could not help mylelf to water: l-'rayed
to God in thefe words; Lotdt in pity losh upon me:
Lord have mercy upon me; have mti cy upon me I .1 fter
this i fell afl.ep. whicii ! found had much refrcfhed
me when i awaked, I fell afkep a fecond time, and
Sell into thi' ftrang* and terribit fort of dream.
Methought 1 was 'itting on. Uie fame ipot of
ground, at the outlide of the wall where 1 fatiwhea
the ftorm blew after the earthquake; and that I faw
a man defctnding from a great black cloud, and
light upon the ground. Ht. was all over as bright
as a flafh of fire that a little before furrounded him;
his countenance inconceivably terrible; the earth as
it
fr were trembled when he ftept upon the ground;
an flafhes of fire feemed to fill all the air. No-
fboner1 thought him landed upon the earth, but
with a long fpear or other weapon he made towards
rne; but firft afcending a rifing ground, his voice'
added to my amazement, when I thought I heard him
pronounce thefe dreadful words, Unhappy -wretch!'
jfeeing all thefe things have not brought thee to repm--
fance, tkou Jhalt immediately die. In pronouncing-
this dreadful fentence, I thought he went to kill me.
with" the fpear that was in his hand.
Any body may think it impoffible for me to ex-
prefs the horrors of my mind at this vifion; and.)
even when I awaked, this very dream made a deep'
impreffion upon my mind. The little divine know-
ledge 1 had, I received from my father's inftructions,
and that was worn out by an uninterrupted feries-
of feafaring impiety for eight years fpace. Except
-vvhat ficknefs forced from me, I do not remember I
Jiad one thought of Hftih-g up my heart towards God;
l>ut rather had a certain ftupidity of foul, not having
the leaft fenfe of fear of the Omnipotent Being when.
in diftrefs, nor of gratitude to him for his deliver-
yitces. Nay, when I was on the defperace expedi-i
tion on the defert African fhore, I cannot remember
i had one thought of what would become of me, or
to beg his confolation and affiftance in my iu3enng«
and diftrefs. When the Portugal captain took me
and honourably ufed me: nay-, farther, when I
even delivered from drowning by efcaping to
ifland, I never looked upon it as a judgment,
only faid I was an unfortunate dog, and that's all.
Indeed fome fecret tranfports of foul I had, which
was not through grace, but only a common ffight
Ofjoy, that I was yet alivei when my companions
were all drowned; and no other joy could I con-
ceive but what is common with the failors over, a
bowl of punch, after they have efcaped the greatcft
dangers.
The likelihood of wanting for neither food nor
conveniencies, might have called upon me for a
thankful acknowledgement to Providence. Indeed
the growth of my corn touched me with feme fenfe;
but that foon wore off again. The terrible earth-
quake pointed to me as it were the finger of God,
but my dreadful amazement continued no longer
than iis duration. But now, when my fpirits began
to fink under the burden of n ftrong diftemper,
and I could Ieifurely view the miferies of death pre-
fent thetnfches before my eyes; then my awakened
confcience began to reproach me with my paft life,
in wliich I had fo wickedly provoked the juftice of
God, to pour down his vengeance upon me.
Such reflections as thefe opprefied me even in the
violence of my diftemper. borne prayers I uttered
which only proceeded from my fear of death. Hut
when I confidered my father's advice and prophecy,
I could not forbear weeping: for he told me, That
if I did feriift in my folly, IJbould not only be deprived
of Cod'3 blfjfing, but kaiie time enough to reflect u[&n
my dcffifmg bis inftruSiions; and this in a -wretched
ume, -when none could bt:/j> me. And now concluding
it to be fulfilled, having no foul in the ifland to ad-
minifter any comfort to me, I prayed earneftly to
the Lord, that he would help me in this my great
calamity. And this, I think, wr,s the firft time I
prayed in fincerity for many years. But now 1 muft
return to my journal.
June 28.. Something refrefhed with fleep, and the
fit quite off, I got up. My dream itill occafioned in
me a great confternation; and fearing that the ague
mighf'return the fucceeding day, I concluded it time
to get;fomeihing to comfort me. I filled a cafe bottle
with iwater, and fet it within the reach of my bed;
and^fo make it more nouri/hing, and kfs chilly, I
put fome rum into it. The next thing I did was tp
broil me a piece of goat-fhfh, of which I ate but lit-
tle. I was very weak; however,. walked about, dread-
ing
log the return of my diftemper ; and at night Lfup-
ped on three of the turtle's eggs, which Iroafted and
ate, bagging God's bleffing therewith.
After 1 had eaten, I attempted to walk, again out
of doors with my gun i but was fo weak, that 1 fat
down, and looked at the fea, which was Imootlvand
calm. While I continued here, tbefe thoughts came
into my mind.
In. what manner is the production o.F the earth and
fea, which I have fs;n fo much of? From whence
came myftlf, and,all other. creatures living, and of
what. are we made?
Our beings were affuredly created byr fome al-
mighty invifible power, who framed the earth, the
lea* and air, and all therein. Bat what is that
power?
Certainly. it mufr follow, that God has created if
all : Now, fakl I, if God has made all this, he muft
be the ruler of them. all, and what is relating therer
to; for certainly. the power that.makes, muft indif"
putably have a power to guide and direct them. And
if this be fo,. (as certainly it muft), nothing can hap-
en without his knowledge or appointment. Then
/«ly if nothing happens without God's appoint-
ent, certainly God has appointed thefe my fuffer-v
lpgs to befal me. And here I fixed my firm belief,
chat it, was. his will that it fhould be fo; and then
proceeded. to inquire, why fhould God deal with me
fn this manner? Ur what had I done thus to ckferve
his.indignation ? ;.,'-- - ., ;. .

as a blafphemer; crying with. a loud and pierxring
voice, Un-worthy wretch! dare you cfk wh.it y.at have.

when the fhip was taken. by the Salee man of war,
not entombed in thfhowels of. wild. beafts oa
the African coaft, or drowned here when all thy-
companions fuffered fhipwreck in the ocean?
Struck dumb witli thtfe reflc&ions, I rofe up in ai
peniive manner, being fo. thoughtful that 1 could. nor
go to fleep; and fearing the dreadful return of my
diftemper, it caufed me to remember that the Brazi-
lians ufe tobacco for almoft all difeafes I then went'
to my cheft, in order to find fome, where heaven no
doubt directed me to find a cure for both foul andi
body; for there I found one of the bibles, which.
till this time I had neither leifure nor inclination to'
look ioto; I took both the tobacco and that out of the
cheft, and laid them on the table. Several experi-
ments did I try with the tobacco: Firft, 1 took a:
piece of leaf, and chewed it; but it being very greeni
and ftrong, almoft ftupefied me. Next I fteeped if
in fome rum an hour or.two, refolving when 1 went
to bed to take a dofe of it; and in the third place, It
burnt fome over a pan of fire holding my nofe ovetf
it fo long as I could endure it without fuflbcation.
In the intervals of this operation, though my head
was giddy and difturbed at the tobacco, I took upi
the bible to read. No fooner d;id I open it, but there
appeared to me thefe words, Call on me- in the day.
tftrouble, and I-willdeliver thee, *nd. thouibalt glori*
ft me.
At firft- this fentence made a.very- deep impreffion.
on my heart; but- it foon wore off again, when \v

himfelf-deliver me from this defolate iflandr? Howe**
vtr, the words would ftill return to my. mind, and>
afterwards made a greater imprtfflon upon me. As-
it now was very lave and the tobacco had dozsd myi
lica<), 1 was inclined to fleep; but before I would
lie down, I fell on my knees, and implored the pro--
mile tll^t God had uLade to me in the holy fcriptures,
that if I called uton him in the day cf trouble, he -would
deiiver me. With much difficulty I after drank tb«
rum, wherein I had fteeped the tobacco ; which fly-
ing in my head, threw me into fuch a profound
fLep, that it was three o'clock the next day before
I awaked; or rather, I believe, 1 flept two days,
having certainly loft a day in my account, and I could
never tell any other way. When I got up, my fpi-
rits were lively and cheerful; my ftomach much
better, being very hungry; and in fhort, no fit re-
turned the next day; which was the -29th, but I
found myfelf much altered for the better.
The -3oth, I went abroad with my gun, but not
far, and killed a fea-fowl or two, refembling a
brand goofe, which, however 1 cared not to eat
when I brought them home, but dined on two more
of the turtle's eggs. In the evening I renewed my
medicine, excepting that I did not take fo large a
quantity, neither did I chew the leaf, or hold my
head over the fmoke: but next day, which was the:
lit of July, having a little fpice of the cold fit, I a*
gain took my medicine as I did the 6rft time.
. July 3. The fit quite left me, but very weak. In
this condition, I ofren thought of thefe words, I
will deliver thee; and white at fome times I .would
think of the impoffibility of it, other thoughts would
reprehend me, for di£regarding the deliverances I had
received, even from the moft forlorn and diftreflcd
condition. I aiked myfelf, what regard have I had
to God for his abundant mercies? Have I done my
parr? He has delivered me, but I have not glorified
kim; as if I had faiil, I had not owned and been
thankful for thefe as deliverances, and how could I
expect greater? So much did this fenfibly touch my
heart, that I gave God thanks foriry recovery from
ficknefs in the moft humble proftration.
July 4. This morning I began feiiouily to ponder
on what is written in the New Teftameiu, refblving
tp read a chapter every morning and night as long
". i" OS
is my thoughts would engage me. As foon as
I fet about this work ferioufly, I found my heart
deeply affected with the irp piety of my pa ft life; thefe
words that I thought were fpoken to me in my dream,
revived, All thefe things have not brought thee to repen-
tance. After this, I begged of God to affift me with
his Holy Spirit in returning to my duty. One day,
in perufing the fcriptures, I came to thefe words, He
is exalted a Prince and a Saviour to give repentance,
and to give remij/ion: Immediately I laid down the
book, and, with uplifted hands to heaven, loudly
cried, 0 b'effed Jeius, thoufon ^David ! Jefus, thouex-
alted prince and Saviour, give me repentance! And
now indeed I prayed with a true fenfe of my condi-
tion, and a more certain hope founded on the word
of God. Now I had a different fenfe of thefe words,
Call on me and 1 -will deliver thee, that is, from the
dreadful load of guilt, which oppreffed my finful
foul, and not from a folitary life, which might rather
be called a bleffing, (feeing I wanted neither food
nor raiment,) when-compared with living among the
human race, fuvrounded with fo much opprcffion,
mifery, and affliction: In a word, I came to this
conclulion, that a deliverance from fin was a much
greater bleffing than a deliverance from affliction,
But again I proceed to my journal.
To the 14th of July, 1 walked about with my
gun, little and little at a time, having been reduced
to the greateft extremity of weaknefs. The applica-
tions and experiments I ufed were perfectly new;
neither could I recommend them to any one's prac-
tice. For though it carried off the fit, it very much
weakened me; and I had frequently convuliions in.
my nerves and limbs for fome time. From hence I
learned, that going abroad in rainy weather, efpeci-
ally when it was attended with ftorms and hurri-
canes of wind, was moft pernicious to health. I
had now been above ten months in the ifland; and
as I never had feen any of the human kind, I there-
fore
>fore accounted myfelf as fole monarch ; and-as I grew
•better, having fecured my habitation to my mind, J
.•relolved to make a tour round my kingdom, in order
.to-make new difcoveries.
'I he i5th of Ju|y I began my journey. I firft
•went to the creek, where I had brought my rafts on
.fhoi-e; and travelling. farther, found the tide went
aio higher than two miles up, where there was a
.little brook of running waters on the bank of which
were many pleafant favannas or meadows, plain,
.fmooth, and covered -with grafs. On the riling paits,
where! fuppofed the water did not reach, I perceiv-
ed a great deitl of tobacco growing to a very ftrong
ftalk. Several other plants I likewife found, the
virtues of which! did not underftand. J fearched-a
long time .for the Caflava root, which I knew the
.Indians in that climate made their bread of; but all
in vain. There were feveral plants of aloes, though
at that time I knew not what they were: Likewife.1
faw feveral fugar-canes, but imperfect for want of
cultivation. With thefe few difcoveries I came back
that night, .and flept'contentedly in my little caftle.
The next day, being the i6th, going the fame way
but farther than the day before, I found the country
more adorned with woods and trees. Htre I perceiv-
ed different fruits in great abundance Melons in
•plenty lay on the ground, and clufters of grapes, ripe
and very rich, fpoead over the trees. You may ima-
gine I was glad of this difcovery, yet ate very fpa-
ringly, left I fhould throw myfelf into a flux or fe-
ver. The grapes I found of excellent ufe ; for when
• I had dried them in the fun, which preferved them
as dried raifms are kept, they proved very wholefcme
and nourifhing, and ferved me in thofe ieafons when
no grapes were to be had.
The night drawing on apace, I afcendedup a tree,
andfl'pt very cornfortabfy, thougli.it was the firft
rime 1 had lain out of rny habitation. And when the
morning came, I proceeded with great pleafure on
my
my vrny, travelling about four miles, as I imagined,
by the length of the valley, directing my courfdnorth-
ward, there being a ridge of hills on the fonth and
north fide of me. At the end of this valley I came
to an opening, where the country feemed to defcend
to the weft ; there I found a little fpring of frefh wa-
ter, proceeding out of the fide of a hill wiih its cry-
ftal ftreams running directly eaft. And indeed here
my fenfes were charmed with the moft-beautiful land-
Tcape nature could afford: for the country appeared
fo flonrifhing, green, and delightful, that -to me it
feemed like a planted garden. I then defcended on
the fide of that delicious vale, -when I found abun-
dance of cocoa, orange, lemon, and citron trees, but
very wild and'barren at that time. As for the limes,
they were delightful .and wholeTome, the juice of
which I after ufed to-mix in water, which made it
-very cool and refrefhing. And now I was refolved
to carry home and lay up a ftore of grapes, limes and
lemons againft the approaching wet.feafon. So lay-
ing them'up in feparated parcels, and then taking a
few of each with me, I returned to my little caftle,
after having fpent three days in this journey. Before
I got home the grapes were fo bruifed that they were
•utterly fpoiled; the limes indeed were good, but of
thefe [ could bring only a few.
July 19. Having prepared two bags, I returned
thither again; but to my great furprile found all the
grapes fpread about, trod to pieces, and abundance
•eaten, which made me conclude there were wild
-beafts thereabouts. To prevent this happening again,
1 gathered a-large quantity of the grapes, and hung
them upon the out branches of the trees, both to
keep them unhurt, and that they might cure and dry
in the fun : and having well loaded myfelf with limes
and lemons, I returned once more to my old place
of refidence.
And now contemplating on the fruitfulnefs of this
"valley, the' pleafantnefs of its fltuatiori, its fecurity
from
from ftorms, and the delightfulnefs of the adjacent
woods, 1 concluded I was fettled in the worft part of
the country, and therefore was thinking to remove
my habitation. But when I confidered again, that
though it was pleafaitt, it was off from the fea fide,
where there was a poilibility, feme time or other, a
fiiip might either be driven or fail by; and that to
inclofe myfelf among hills and woods muft certainly
put an end to my hopes of deliverance ; 1 refolved to
let my caftle remain where Providence had firft af-
iigned it. Yet Io ravifhed was I with this place, that
I made me a liule kind of bower, furroundingitwith
a double hedge, as high as I could reach, well ft.iked
and filled with bulrufhes; and having fpent a great
part of the month of July, I think it was the firft of
Auguft before I began to enjoy my labour.
Aug. 3. Perceiving my grapes to be dry, I took
them from the trees, and they proved excellent good
raifins of the fun: the moft of which I carried to my
cave; and happy for me 1 did fo5 by which I favol
the beft part or my winter food.
Aug. 14. This day it began to rain ; -and though
I had made me a tent like theothsr, yet having no
fhelter of a hill to keep me from ftorms, nor a cave
behind me to retreat to, I was obliged to return to
my old caftle. The rain cominued more or lefs eve-
ry day, till the middle of October; and fometimesfo
violently that I could not ftir out of my cave for fe-
veral days. 1 his feafon I found my family to in-
creafe; for one of my cats that ran away from me,
and who I thought had been dead, returned about
Augufl, with three kiitens at her heels, like herlelf;
which I thought ftrange, becaufe both my cats were
females, and the wild cats of the ifland feemed to be
of a different kind from our European cats; but from
thefe cats proceeded luch numbers, that I was forced
to kill and deftroy them as I would do wild beaftsor
To the z6th of this month i could not ftir out, it
raining
raiining inceflamly: when beginning to want food,
1 was compelled to venture twice, the fiift of which 1
fhot a goat, and afterwards found a very large tor-
toife. The manner of my regulating my food was
thus: A bunch of raifins ferved me for breakfaft; a
piece of goat's flefh or turtle broiled for my dinner,
and two or three turtle eggs for my fiipper. While
the rain lafted, I daiiy worked two or three hours at
enlarging my cave, and by degrees worked it on to-
wards one fide till I came to the outfide of the hill,
and made a door or way out, which came beyond my
fence or wall, and fo- I came in and out this way.
But after I had done this, I was troubled to fee my-
ftlf thus expofed; though I could not perceive any
thing to fear, a goat being the biggeft creature I had
feen upon this ifiand.
Sept. 30. Cafting up my notches on my poft, which
amounted to 365, 1 concluded this to be the anni-
verfery of my landing; and therefore humbly pro-
ftrating myfelf on the ground, confeffing my fins, ac-
knowledging Gods righteous judgments upon me,
and praying to Jefus Chrift to have mercy on me, I
failed for twelve hours till the going down of the fun;
and then eating a bifcuit and a bunch of grapes, laid
me on the bed, and with great comfort took my
night's repole. Till this time I never had diftinguifh-
ed the Sabbath-day; but now I made a longer notch
than ordinary-^or the days of reft, and divided the
weeks as well as 1 could, though I found 1 had loft a
day or two in my account. My ink failing foon af-
ter, I omitted in my daiiy memorandum things of an
indifferent nature, and contented myfelf to write
down only the moft remarkable events of my life.
The rainy and dry feafons appeared now regular to
me, and experience taught me how to provide foi-
them ; y£t, in one thing I am going to relate, my ex-
.perience very much failed me. ^rou may call to
mind what 1 have mentioned of fome barley and rice
which I had laved; about thirty ftalks of the former,
C" and
and twenty of the Litter; and at thu time ihe fua
!being in its fouthern politiou, going from me, to-
geiher with the rains, made me conclude it a very
proper feafon to fow it. Accordingly I dug up a
.piece of ground, with my'wooden fpade, and divi-
ding it in two p.ms, fowed about (wo thirds of my
feed, preserving by me about a handful of each.
And happy it was I did fo; for no rains falling, it
was chocked up, and never appeared above the eaith
tiil the wet feafon came again, and then part of it
grew, as if it had been newly fown.
I w.is refolved ftiil to make another trial; and
feekingfor a moifter piece of ground near my bower,
J there fowed the reft of my feed in February, a liule
Jiefore the vernal equinox: which having the rainy
months of March and April to water it, yielded a no-
ble crop, and fprung up very pleafantly. 1 had ftill
faved part of the feed, not daring to venture all;
and by the time 1 found out the proper feafons to
Tow in, and that I might expect every year two feed-
times and two hai veils, myitock amounted to above
/half a peck of each fort of grain.
No fo.oner were the rains over, but the flakes
which I had cut from the trees, fhot out like willows
the fitft year after lopping their heads. I was igno-
rant of the tree I cut them from: but they grew fo
regularly beautiful, that they made a moft lively ap-
pearance, and fo flourilhed in three years time, that
J refolved to cut more of them; and thefe foen
growing, made a gluiious fence, as afterwards Ifhall
obferve.
And now I perceived that the feafons of the year
i-nigbt generally be divided, not into fummer and
winter as in Europe, but into wet and dry
as in this manner.

The Wet feafons would continue Idnger or fhorter
as the winds happened .to blow. But having found
the ill confequences of being abroad in the rain, I
took care beforehand to furnifh tnyfelf with provi-*
fions; and, during the wet fnonths, fat within doprt
as much as poffible. At this time I contrived to maka
many things that I wanted, though it coft ms much
labour and pains before 1 could accotnplHh them.
The firft I tried was to make a bafket; but all the
twigs I could get proved fo brittle, that I could not
then perform it. it now proved of great advantage
to me, that, when a boy, I took great delight in
Handing at a bafket- maker's in the fame town where
my father lived^ to view them at work; and, like
other boys, curious to fee the manner of their work--
ing thefe. things, and very officious to affift, I perftct-
IyJearned the method of it, and wanted nothing but
the tool?. And it coming into my mind, that the
twigs of that tree of which t made my ftakes, might
be as tough. as fallow, willow, or ofiei-s, growing in
England, I refolved to make an experiment, and went
the next day to my country feat, and found lome tit
for my turn 5 and after Cutting down a quantity with
my hatchet, I dried them in my pale, and, when ftt
to work with, Carried them to my cave, where I em-
C t ployed
.ployed myfelf in making feveral forts of bafkets, in-
Ibmuch that I could put in whatfoever I pleafed. It.
is true, they were not cleverly made, yet they fenred
my turn upon all occafions.
But ftill I wanted two neceffary things. I had no
.cafk to hold my liquor, except two rundlets almoft
full of rum, a few bottles of an ordinary fize, and
fame fquare cafe bottles ; neither had 1 a pot to boil
any thing in, only a large kettle, unfit to make broth,
or ftew a bit of meat: I wanted likewife at the be-
ginning of this dry feafon a tobacco-pipe ; but for
tiiis I afterwards found an expedient.
1 kept myfelf employed in planting my fecond row
tof flakes. But remcinbring that when I travelkd
•up to the brook, I had a mind to fee the whole ifland,
J now refumed my intention, and taking my dog,
.gun, hatchet, two bifcuit cakes, a great bunch of
raifins, with a larger quantity of powder and fhot
than ufual; I began my journey. Having paficd the
vale where my bower flood, I came within view of
the fea lying to the weft; when, it being a clear day,
J fairly defcried land, extending from the W. to the v*Ji
i>. W. about 10 or 15 leagues, as I concluded ; but ^ P*'
could not fay whether it was an ifland or a conti- ^JJ
»ent. Neither could I tell what this place might «*
be; only thought it was part of America, and where 3
1 might have been in a miferable condition, had I ^
landed. Again, I confidered, that if this was the ^
Spanifh coaft, certainly, one time or other, I fhould
fee fome fhip pafs by; and if it was not, then it muft
be the Savage coaft, between the Spanifh country
and Brazil, which abounds with cannibals or roan-
caters.
As I proceeded forward, I found thi« fide of^the
ifland much more pleafant than mine ; the fields fra-
grant, adorned with fweet flowers and verdant grafs,
together with feveral very fine woods. There were
parrots in plenty, which made me long for one to be
lny companion; but it was with great difficulty I <«i
eou'd knock down one with my ftick; and I 'kept
lii'-ii at home Some years, before I could get him to
call me by my name.
In the low grounds I found various forts of hares
and foxes, as I'took them to be, but much different
from thoSe in England. Several of thefe I killed, but
never ate them; neither indeed had I any cccafloa ;.
for abounding with goats, pigeons, turtle, and grapes,
I could defy Leadenhall market to furoifii me a bet-
ter table. In this journey I did not travel above two
miles a day, bccauie I took Several turns and wind-
ings to fee what difcoveries I could make, returning
weary enough to the place where 1 defigncd to reft all
night, which was either ki a tree, or to a place which-
1 Surrounded with Stakes,, that no wild creatuie rp.iiiht
fuddenly Surpriz. me. When I came ;o the fea Shore,.
I w.as amazed to' fee the fptendor of it. Its Strand
was covered. with (hells of the moSt beautiful fifh, and'
conftantly abounding with innumerable turtles, and
fowls of many kinds, which I was ignorant of, ex--
cept thofe called Penguins. I might have fhot as ma-
ny as Fpleafed, but was fparing of my ammunition,
rather chufing to kill a fhe-goat, which I did with;
much difficulty, on account of the ILunefs of the
country.
Now, though this journey produced the moft plea-

my liking, that I did no: repine at my being (bated
on the worSt part of the iiland. I continued my jour-

fo round till I came to my poft ag^in. As I had a-

well the pofition of the fun at that time of the day-.
and to add to my misfortune, the weather proving
very hazy, I was obliged to return to my poft by the
fea fide, and fo backwards the fame way I came. la
this journey my dog furprifcd a kid, and would have
killed it, had I not prevented him. As 1 had often
been thinking of getting a kid or two, and fo railing
a breed of tame goats to fupply me after my ammu.
iiition was fpent, I took this opportunity of begin.
Tiing : 'and having made a collar for this little crea-
mre with a ftring made of rope yarn, I brought itto
iny bower, and there inclofed and left him; and ha-
ving fpent a month in this journey, at length 1 re«
.ttirned to my old habitation.
No body can doubt of my fatisfa&ion, when I re-
turned to my little eaftle, and repofcd myfelf in my
hammock. After my journey I refted myfelf a weefc,
which time I employed in nuking a cage for my
ipren-y- poll. I now began to confider of the poor kid
-J. had left at .the bower, and I imruediately weat ta
fetch it home. When I came there, I found the
young creature almoft ftarved; 1 gave it fome food)
and tied k as before: But there was no occafion, for
5t followed me like a dog ; and as I conftanth/ fed it,
it became fo loving, gentle, and fond, that it com-
tnenced one of my domefties, and would neverkave
me.
The rainy feafon of the autumnal; equinox being
now come, I kept the 3oth of September in the moil
fokmn manner, as ufual, it being the third year of
iny abode in the iftand. I fpent the whole day in ac-.
•knowledging God's mercies; in giving him thanks
for making this folitary-life as agreeable, and Ids
iluful, than that of human fociety ; and for the com-
iiiiinications vf his grace to my foul, in fupporting,
comforting, and encouraging me to depend upon his
providence, and hope for his eternal prcfence in the
vorld to come. . •. "I .
Indeed I often did confider how much more happy
I was
1 was in this ftate of life than in that accurfed man-
ner of living 1 formerly \ifed: yet fomeiimes when
hunting, or viewing the country, the anguiih of tf.f
foul would break out upon me, and my very heait
would fink within m,e, to think. of the woods, the
mountains, the defens I was in; and how 1 was x
priloner locked up within the eternal bai& and bohs
of the ocean, in an uninhabited wildernefs without
- hopes and without redemption. . In this condition,
I would often wring my hands, and weep like a
child: And ev.en foinenmes in the middle of my wort
this fit would take me; and then I would fit down
and figh, looking on the ground for an hour or two1
together, till Cuch time as my grief got vent in &
flood of tears.
One morning as I' was fidTy employed in this man--
aer, I opened my Bible, when immediately I fi$cd
my eyrs upon tbefe words, 7-wili nevei leave life, r.ar
prfaki tkee! Surely, thought I, thefe words are dt'"
reeled to met ov e!fc why Uiould they appear jufl nf
a moment wLcu I am btmo.u>iug my forlorn condi-
tion ? and if Ciod does not forfakc me, what matters
it, fmce he can make me more happy .in this ft.ite cf
life, than if I enjoyed the greateft fplendor in the
world ? But while I was going to return God thanks
for my prefent flate, fometlUng feeiTied to fiiock ray

can you pretend to be thankful for a condition from
which you would pray to be delivered! Here I ftopt;- and though I could not fay 1 thanked ths Di-
vine Majefty for being ihere, yet I gave God thanks
for placing to my view my former wicked courfe of
life, and granting me a true knowledge of repent-
ance. AuJ whenever I opened or (hut the Bible, I
bltficd kind Providence, that directed my good friend
in England to fend it among my goods without my
order, and for afiifting me to fave it from the power
of the raging ocean. -i - ', • '«'-''-

took me up when ii did not rain, three hours every
morning. Thirdly, The ordering, curing, prefer-
ving, and cooking what I had killed, or catched for
my .fupply, which took me up a great part of the day:
for in the middle of the day the fun bemg in its
height, it was fo hot, that 1 could not Air out; fo
that I had only but four hours in the evening to work
in : and then the want of tools, of affiltance, and ikill,
-Bailed. a great deal of tinie to little purpofe, I was
Xio kfs than two and forty days making a board fit
ifor a long fhelf, which two fawyers, with their tools
and faw-pit, would have cut out of the fame tree in
Jialf a day. It was of a large tree, as my board was to
l>e broad.. 1. was three days in cutting it down, and
two more in lopping off the boughs, and reducing it
to a piece. pf timber. This 1 hacked ?.nd hewed off
each fide, till it became light to move ; then I turned
/Jr, made one fide of it fmooth and flat as a board
from end to end, then turned it downward, cutting
the other fide, till I brought the plank to be about
three inches thick, and fmooth on both lides. A-
ny body may judge my great labour and fatigue in
fuch a piece of work: but this I went through with
patience, as alfo many other things that my circum-
fiances made neceiTary for me to do.
The harveft months, November, and December,
were now at hand, in which I had the pleafmg prolpect
of a very good crop. But here I met with a new inif-
fortune; for the goats and hares, having tafted of
ilie Aveetnefs of the blade, kept it fo fhort, •that it
had not ftrength to fhoot up into a ftalk. To pre-
vent this, I inclofed it with a hedge, and by day (hot
of its devourers; and my dog, which I had
to ^he field-gate, keeping bjrking all night,
fb frightened thefe creafures, that I got entirely rid
«f them.
But no foOner did I get rid of thefe, than other'
enemies appeared, to wit, whole flocks of feveral
forts of birds, who only waited till my back was
turned to ruin me. So much did this provoke me,
that 1 let fly, and kilted three of the malefactors;
and afterwards ferred them as they do notorious
thieves in England, hung them up in chains as a
terror to others. And indeed fo good an effect had
this, that they not only forfook the corn, but all
that part of the ifland,. fo long as thefe criminals [
bung therei
My corn having ripened' apace, the latter end of
December, which was my fecond harveft, I reaped it
vtith a fey the, made of one of my broad fwords. I
had no fatigue in cutting down my firft crop, it wasi
fd flender. The ears I carried home in a bsilket rub-'
ing it out with my hands inftead of threfhing it;'
and when my haiveft was ovtr, found my half peck
of feed produced near two bufhels of rice and two'
bufhrls and a half of barley And now I plainly
forefaw, fh'ati by God's goodnefs, I fhould be fur-
nifhed-with bread': but yet I was concerned, becaufe'
1 knew not how to grind or make meal of my corn, -
nor bread, neither knew how to bake it. I would'
not however tafte any of the crop, but refolved to'
pieferve it againft next feafon, and in the mean'
while ufe my beft endeavours to provide myfelf w-ith1
Other food.
But where were my labours to end? The want of
a plough to turn up the earth, or fl.ovel to dig it, I'
conquered by making me a wooden fpade: the want
of a harrow, I Supplied myfelf with dragging Over the'
corn a great bough of a tree.- When it was growing,
I was forced to fence it; when ripe, to mow it, •
carry it home, threfh it, part it from the chaff) and'
fave it. And after all, I wanted a mill to grind it, •
fieve to drefs it, yeaft and fait to make it into bread, •
C 5 and'
and an oven to bake it. This fet my brains on worfe
to find feme expedient for every one of thefe necef-
f.iries againft the next harveft.
And now having more feed, my fiift tare was to
prepare me more land. I pitched upon two large flat
pieces of ground near my caftle for that purpofe, in >4n,aK
vhich I fowed my feed, and fenced it with a good ta^'
Jiedge. This took me up three months; by which Mimi,],

enough when dried in the fun to bear handling, and Wti^'

To be fhort, the clay I found; but it would occa- .s |J":™
fion the moft ferious perfon to fmile to fee what avvk- ^H-L
vvard ways 1 took, and what ugly mifhapen things I ti^
made; how many either fell out or cracked by the ^i,!,:
violent heat of the fun, and fell in pieces when they *' ^ a
were removed; fo that I think it was two months kia> N]
time before I.could perfect any thing : and even then \^1*"'
but two clumfy things in imitation of earthen jars. AitJL10'
Thefe however I very gently placed in wicker ba- ^ *it
(kets made on purpofe for them, and between the >., ««r(
pot and the bafkets ftuffed it full of rice and barky ^J,
firaw: and thefe I prefumed would hold my dried fimu11:
L-orn, and perhaps the meal when the corn was brui- fet..,. ^
(Vd. As for the fmaller things, I made them with ii* of
tietter fuccefs; fuch as little round pots, fiat difhes, ;^,i jng
I'irchers, and pipkins, the fun baking them very
bird.
T-ct ftiIl I wanted one tL?ng abfolutely neccflary,
and
and that was an earthen pot, not only to hold fny
liquid, but alfo to bear the lire, which none of thefe
could do. It once happened, that as I \vas putting
out my fire, 1 found therein a broken piece of one'
of my veffels burnt hard as a rock, and red as'a-tite.-
This made me thruk of burning fome pots; and lin-
ving no notion of a kiln, or of glazing them with-
lead, I-fixed three large pipkins, and two or three:
pots-iira pile one upon another; The fire I piled'
round the outfide, and dry wood on the top, till.I-i
faw the pots in the infide red-hot, and found that'
they did not crack at all ; and when 1 perceived them
perfectly red, I let one of them ftand in the lire a--
bout 6ve or.fix hours, till the cl.ty melted by the ex-
tremity of the heat, and would have run to glafs, -
had 1 fuffered it ; upon which I flacktd my fire by••.
degrees, till the rednefs abated; and watching them
till the morning, I found I had three very good pip1
kins, and two earthen pots, as well burnt and fit tor
my turn as 1 could defirei
No joy could be greater than mine at this difco-
•very. For after- this, I may fay, 1 wanted for no
fort of earthen ware. I filled- one oF my pipkins
with water.to boil me fome meat, which it did.ad'
mirably well, and with a piece- of kid I made me
fome good broth, as well as .my circumflances would
afford me at that time.
The next concern I had was to get me a ftone-
mortar to beat fome COTIV in, inftead of a mill to •
grind it. Here indeed 1 was at a great lols, as-not'
being fit for- a ftone cutter; and-many days 1 fpent
to find out a great ftone big enough to cut hollow-
and make fit for-a mortar, and ftrono enough to bf.tr •
the weight of a peftle, that would break the corn .
without filling it wifh fand, But all- the-franes of
the ifland being of a mouldering. nature, rendered •
my fearch fruitlefs, and-then I refolved to look out i
a. great block of hard wood; which having foon
found, 1 formed it with my axe and hammer, and i
c; 6
then with infinite labour made a hallow in it, juft as
the Indians of Brazil make their canoes. When I
liad fini£hed this, I made a great pelUeof iron woodr
-«nd then laid them np againft my fucceeding harveft.
1My n«xt bufinefs was to make me a feve. to fift'
xiiy meal, and part it from the bran and hulk Having:
no fine thin canvas to fearch the meal through, I
could not tell what to do. What linen I had was
reduced to rags: I had goats hair enough, but nei-
ther tools to work it, nor did I know how to fpirv
it: At length I remembered I had feme neckcloths
of callico or muffin of the failors, which I had
brought out of the fhip, and with thde i made three
iuiall fieves, proper enough for the work.
I come now ro confider the baking part. The
\vaTit of an oven I fupplied by nv.king fome earthen
pans very broad, but not deep. When I had a mind
to bake, I made a great fire upon my heartk, the
tiles of which I -had made tnyfelf; and when the
wood was burnt into live coals, I fpread them over
it, till it became very hot; then fweeping them a-
way, I iet down my loaves, and whelming down-
the earthen pots upon them, drew the afhes and
co:ils all around the outfide of the pots to continue
the heat; and in this manner I baked, my barley-
loaves,- as well as. if I had been a complete paftry-
cook, and alfo made of the rice feveral cakes and
puddings.
"It_ is no wonder, that all thefe things took ma up
-the beft part of a year, fince what intermediate time
i b.id was belrowed in managing my new harveft
aod husbandry ; for in the proper feafon I reaped my
corn, carried it home, and laid it up in the ear in
,ny large bafkets, till I had time to rub, inftead of
threfhing it. And now indeed my corn increafed fo
much, that it produced me about twenty bufhels of
barley, and as much of rice, that I not only began
to wfe " freely, but was thinking how to enlarge
my
my.barns, and refolved to- fow as much at a time as
would be fufficient for me for a whole year.
All this while, the profpecT: of land, which 1 had
foen from the other fide of the. ifland, ran in my-
mind. I ftill meditated a deliverance from this
place, though the fear of greater misfortunes mi,.ht
have deterred me from it. For allowing that I had
attained that place, I run the hazard oir being killed
and eaten by the devouring cannibals; and if they
were not fo,. yet L might be flain, as other Euro-
peans had been, who fell into their hands. Not-
witbftanding all this, my thoughts ran continually
upon that fhore. I'now wifhcd for iry boy Xiiry,
and the long-boat, with the fhouldcr of mutton fail:
I went to the fhip's boat, that had been ca'ft a great
w-ay on the fhore in the late ftorm. Mie was remo-
ved but a liitle; but her bottom being turned up by
the impetuofity and fury of the waves and wind, I
fell to work with all the ftrength I hail. and with
kvers and rollers 1 had cut from the wood, to turn
her, and repair the damages fhc had fuffaincd. This
work took me up three or four weeks, when finding
my little ftrength all in vain, I fell to undermining
it by digging away the fand, and fo io make it fall'
down, fetting pieces of wood to thruft and guide it
in the fall. But after this was done, I was (till un-
able to ftir it up, or to get under it; much lefs to
'move it forwards towards the water, and fo I was
forced to give it oTer.
This difappointment however did not frighten me.
f began to think whether it was not poffible for me
to make a canoe or Periagua, fuch at the Indians
make of the trunk of a tree. But here I lay under par-
ticular inconveniencies, want of tools to make it,
and want of hands to move it into ihe water when
it was made. However, to work 1 went upon it,
fiopping all the inquiries I could make, with this
very fimpk anfwcr I made to myfelf, Let's firft make
ify

along when it is done.

ince. • ;"^ii to
In the height of this work, tr.y fourth year expir- ;:,„
,d, from the time I was caft oa this ifland. At
this time 1 did not forget my annivcrfary; but kept
* •-«*;
)
k with rather greater devotion than before. For
now my hopes being fruftrated, I looked upon this
world as a thing I had nothing to do with; and ve-
ry well might I fay, as father Abraham laid unto
.Dives, Bet-ween me and thee there is a gulf fixed. And
indeed I was feparated from its wickednefs too,
having neither the luft.of the flefh, the luft of the
eye, nor the pride of life: I had nothing to covet,
being lord, king, and emperor over the whole
country I had in poffeffion, without difpute, and
without control: I had loadings of corn, plenty of
turtles, timber in abundance, and grapes above
meafure. What was all the reft to me I The money
1 had by me lay as defpicable drofs, which I would
freely have given for a grofs of tobacco pipes, or a
hand-mill to grind my corn: in a word, the na-
ture and experience of thefe things dictated to we
this juft reflection: That the good things of this
world are no farther good to us, than they are for
our ufe l and that whatever we may heap up to give
others, we can but enjoy as much as we ufe, and
no more.
Thefe thoughts rendered my mind more eafy than
ufual. Every time I fat down to meat, I did it with
thankfulnefs, admiring the providential-hand of God
who in this wildernefs had fpread a table to me. And
now I confidered what I enjoyed, rather than what
I wanted ; compared my prefent condition with what
J at firft expected it fhould be; bow I fhould have
done, if I had got nothing out of the fhip; that I
muft have perifhed before I had caught filh or tur-
tles; or lived, had I found them, like a mere fa-
vage, by eating them raw, and pulling them in pie-
ces with my claws, like a beaft. 1 next compared
my ftation to that which I deferved; how undutiful
I had been to my parents; how deftitute of the fear
of God; how void of every thing that was good;
and how ungrateful for thofe abundant mercies I had
received from heaven, being fed, as it were, by a
miracle,
miracle, even as great as Elijah's being fed by rS*-
vens; and caft on a place where there were no vi-
nomous crea'ures to poifon or devour me; in fhoit,
making God's tender mercies matter of great confo-
lation, I relinquifhed all fadnefs,- and gave way to-
contentment.
As long as my ink continued, which with water I
made laft as iong as I coiftd, I ufed to minute down
the days of the month, on which any remarkable
thing happened. And,
Firft, I obferved, that the fame day I fbrfook my
parents and friends, and ran away to Hull, in order
to go,to fea, the fame day afterwards in the next"
year I was takeirand made a flave by the Salee rO-
•Vcrs.
That the very day I efcaped'out of the wreck of
-the fhip in Yarmonth roads, a year after, on the
fame day, I made my efcape from Salee in my pa-
tron's fifhing boat.
And that on the ^oth'of September, being the day-
of the year I was-born on^ on that day twenty-fii-
years after, was Imiraculoufly faved, .and caft afhore
ion this ifland.
The next thing that wafted after my ink, was the
bifcuit which I had bVought but of the fhip: And
though I allowed myfelf but one cake a-day for a-
bove a twelvemonth, yet I was quite out of bread for
tipar a year, before I got any corn of my own.
In the next place, my cloaths began to decay, and
my h'nen had been gone long before. However, I
bad preferved about three dozen of the failors che-
quered (hirts, which proved a great refrefhment to
irie, when the violent beams of the fua would not:
fuffer me to bear any of the feamens heavy watch-
coa''s; which made me turn tailor, and, after a rm-
ferable botching manner, convert them to jackets.
To preferve my head, I made me a cap of goat-
fhins, wiih the hair outwards to keep out the rain i
•which indeed ferved me fo well, that afterwards I
mat!
made me a waiftcoat and open kneed breeches of the
fame: And then 1 contrived a fort of an umbrella,
covering it with ikins which not only kept out the
heat of the fun, but the rain alfo. Thus being eafy
and fettled in my mind, my chiefeft happinels was
to converfe-whh God, in moft heavenly and com-
fortable ejaculations.
For five years after this I cannot fay any extraor-
dinary thing occurred tome. My chief employment
was to cure my raifins, and plant my barley and
rice, of both which I had a year's provifion before-
hand. liut though I was difappointed in my firft
canoe, 1 made it, at intermediate times, my bufineft
to make a fecond, of much inferior fize; and it
was two years before I finifhed it. But as I perceiv-
ed it would nowife anfwer my defign of failing to
the other fhore, my thoughts were confined to take
a tour round the iflmd^ to fee what further difcove-
ries I could make. To this intent, after having
moved her to the water, and tried how fhe would
fail, 1 fitted up a little maft to my boat, and made a
fail of the fhip's fail that lay by me. I then made
lockers or boxes at the end of it, to put in neceffa-
ries, provifions, and ammunition, which would
preferve them dry either from rain, or the fpray of
the fea; and in the infide of the boat, I cut me a
long hollow place to lay my gun, and to keep it dry
made a flag to hang over it. My umbrella I fixed in
-a ftep in the ftern, like a maft, to keep the heat of
the fun off me. And now refolving to fee the cir-'
cumference of my little kingdom, I victualled my
fhip for the voyage, putting in two dozen of my
barley bread loaves, an earthen pot full of parched
rice, a little bottle of rum, half a goat, powder and
(hot, and two watch-coats. It was the 6th of No-
vember, in the fixth year of my reign, or captivity,
that 1 fet out on this voyage; which was mucli
longer than I expected, being obliged to put farther
cut, by reafon of the rocks that lay a great way iu
/ the
the Tea, And indeed fo much did theferocks furpiife
the, that I was for putting back, fearing that if I
ventured farther, it would be out of my power tore-
turn: in this uncertainty I came to an anchorjuft
oft" fhore, to which I waded with my gun on my
fhouldcr, and then climbing.up a hill, whichever,
looked that point, I raw the full extent of it, and fa
I refolded to run nil ha-zirds.
In this profpuft from the hill, I perceived a violent
current running to the call, coming very clofe to the
point; which 1 the more carefuVy obferved, think-
ing it dangerous, and that when I came to it, I
rnight be drove into the fea by its force, and not able
to reiurn to the ifhnd: and certainly it muft have
been fo, hid I not made this obfervation ; for on the
other fide was the like current^ with this difference,
that it fet off at a greater diftance; and I perceived
there was a ftrong eddy nnd;r the land; fo that my
chief bufinefs was to work out of the fir ft current,
and conveniently get into the eddy. Two dayslftaii
Jiere, the wind blowing very brifkly E S. E. which
being contrary to the current, leaves a great breach
of the fea upon the point; fo it was neither fit for
me to keep too near the fhore, on account of the
breach i nor ftnnd at too great a diftance, for fear of
ihe ftrcams. That night the wind abating, it grew
fo calm, that I ventured out; and here I may be a
monument to all rafh and ignorant pilots : For I was-
'TO fooher come to the point, and not above the
boat's length from fhore. but 1 was got into a deep
v'-ater with a current like, a mill, which drove mf
t.oat along fo violently, that it was impoffible for me
to keep her near the edge of it, but forced me more
ancf more ou; from the eddy to the left of me.; apd
»J1 1 could do with my padlers was ukltfs, there bs*

what provifion I had was Ipent, or before, if a ftoim
fli'it'.id happen to arife.
\Vho can conceive the prefent anguifh of my mind
at this calamity ? With longing eyes did I lock up-
on my little kingdom, and thought the ifland the
pkafanteft place in the univeife. Happy, thrice hap-
py defert, laid I, fhall I never iee thee more?
Wretched creature! whither am I going f Why did
1 murmur at my lonefome condition, when now 1
would give the -whole world .to be thither again?
"While 1 was thus complaining, I found mjfelf to
be driven about two leagues into the fea; however I
laboured til) my ftrength was far fpent, to keep n.y
boat as far north as pcffibly I could, to that fide of
the current where the eddy lay on. About nooni!
perceived a little breeze of wind fpring up from the.
S. S. E. which overjoyed my heart; acd I was ftiH
mote elated, when, in about half an hour, it blew a
gentle fine gale. Had any thick weather fprung upv
1 had been loft another v/ay : for having no compaft
en board, I fhould never have found the way to fleer
towards the ifland, if once it had dtfappeared ; but it
proving the contrary, 1 fet tip my milt again, fpread
niy fail, and .flood away northward as much as I
could to get rid of the current. And no fooner did
the boat-begin to flretch away, but I perceived by
. the cltarnefs of the-water, a change of the current
was near: for where it was fliong, the water was
foul: aod «.here it was clean,) the current abated.

my prsfent excefs of joy, how heartily I run my boat
lnta the ftream of ihis-eddy, and how joyfully I
fpre.id my fail to the refrefhing wind, ftancling
cheerfully before it, with a fmavt tide nnder foot.
-By the affiitance of this eddy, 1 was carried above a
Ieague home again, when being in the wake of the
ifland, betwixt the two currents, 1 found the water
to be in a fort of a fund. About four o'clock in the
afternoon, I reached within a league of the ifland,.
and perceived the points of the rock, which caufed
this difatfer, (tretching-out, as i obterved before, to
the foudiward, which throwing oft" the current more
fourhwardly, had occafioned another eddy to the
north. But having a fair briik gale, I ftretched a-
crois this eddy, and in an hour came with in a mile
of the fhore, where I foon landed, to my unfpeak-
able comfort; and after an humble proftration,
thanking God for my deliverance, with a refolution
to lay all thoughts of efcaping alide, I brought my
boat fafe to a little cove, and laid me down to take a
welcome repofe. When I awoke, I was confider-
ing how I might get my boat home; and coafting
along the fhcre, I came to a good bay, which ran up
to a rivulet or brook, where finding a fafe harbour*
J fiowed her as fafe, as if fhe had been on a dry dock
made on purpofe for her.
I now perceived myfelf not far from the place
where before I had travelled on foot; fo taking no-
thing with me except my gown and umbrella, I be-
gan my journey, and in the evening came to my
bower, where 1 again laid trie down to reft 1 had
^otfleptlong before 1 was awakened in great furprife,
4>y a ftrange voice that called me feveral times, Robin.,
fiobin, Robin Crufoe, poor Robin! Where are you, Rf-
bin Crufoe? where are you? where have you been?
iSo faft was I afleep at firft, that 1 did not awake
thoroughly; but half afleep and half awake, I
"* .thought
though I dreamed that fomebody fptke to me. Buti
as the voice repeated Robinfia Crufoe feveral times,
being terribly affrighted, 1 ftarted up in the utmoft
tonfuiion; and no fooner were my eyes fully open,
but I beheld my pretty Poll fitting on the top of the
hedge, and foon knew that it was he that called me;
for juft in fuch bewailing language I ufed to talk and
teach him ; which he fo exactly learned, that he would
lit upon my finger, and lay his bill clofe to my face,
and cry, Peor Ribinjbn Crufoe ! where are you? where
have you bem? how came you here ?• and fuch like
prattle i had conftantly taught him. But even tho'
I knew it to be the parrot, it was a great while be-
fore I could adjuft myfclf; being amazed how
the creature got thither, and that he fhould fix a-
bout that place, and no where elfe. But now, being
affurcd it could be no other than my honeft Poll, my
wonder ceafed ; and reaching out my hand, and cal-
ling familiarly Poll, the creature came to me, and
perched upon my thumb, as he was wont, conftan'-
ly prating to me, with poor Robin/on Cntfot I and bc-w
did I come here? and where had I been? as if the bii d
was overjoyed to fee me; and fo 1 took him home a-
long with me.
1 was now pretty well cured of my rambling to
fea; yet I could wifh my boat, which had coft me fo
much trouble and pains, on this fide the ifiand once
more, but which indeed was impracticable. T there-
fore began to lead a very retired life, living near a
twelvemonth, in a very contented manner, wanting
for nothing except converfation. As to mechanic
labours, which my neceffities obliged me to, I fancied
I couldiupon occafion make a tolerable carpenter,
were the poor tools I had to work withal but good.
Beiidts, as I improved in my earthen ware, 1 contri-
ved to make them withavfheel, which I found much
cafier and better; making my work fhapely, which
before was rude and ugly. But I think 1 was never
fo elevated with my own performance or project, than
for
for being able to mike a tobacco-pipe; which though
It proved an aukward clumfey thing, yet it was very
found and carried fhe linoke perfectly well, to my
great fatisfaction.
- la'fo improved my wicker-ware, making me abun-1
dance of necefiary bafkets,' which, though not very
hand Come, were very handy and convenient to fetch
things home in, as alfo for holding my ftores, barley,
rice, and other provifions.
My powder beginning to fail, made me examine
after what manner I fliould kill the goats or birds to
live on, after it was all gone. Upon which I con*
trived many ways to enfnare the goats, and fee if I
could catch them alive, particularly a fhe-goat with
young. At laft I had my defire ; for making pit-falls
and traps baited with barley and rice, I found one
morning in one of them an old he-goat, and in the
other, three kids, one male, the other two females.
So boifterous was the old one, that I could not
bring him away. But I forgot the old proverb, That
hunger-will tame a Ihn : for had I kept him three or
four days without victuals, and then given him fosne
water with a little corn, he 'would have been as tame
as a young kid. The other creatures I bound with
firings together; but I had great difficulty before t
could bring them to my habitation! It was fomc
time before they would feed; but throwing them
fweet corn, it fo rruch tempted ihem, that they be-
gan to be tamer; from hence I concluded, that if I
clefigned to furnifh myfelf with goats flefh, when my
ammunition was fpent, the tamely breeding them up,
like a flock of fheep, about my feitlemsnt, was the
only method I could take. I concluded alfo I. muft
feparate the wild from the tame, or elfe they would
always run wild as they grew up 5 and the beft way
for this, was to have fome inclofed piece of ground,
well fenced, either with hege or pale, to keep them
fo effectually, that thofe wirhin might not break out
or ihofe without break in. Such an undertaking
wai
was very great for one pair of hands; but as there
was an abfolute nect (fity for doing it; my firft care
was to find a convenient piece of ground where there
was likely to be herbage for them to eat, water to
drink, and cover to keep them from the fun.
Here again I gave another inftance of my ignc-
ranee and inexperience, pitching upon a piece of
meadow land fo large, that had I inclofed it, the
hedge or pale muft have been at leaft two miles about.
Indeed had it been ten miles, I had time enough to
do it in; but then I did not conlider that my goats
would be as 'wild in fo much compafs, as if they had
had the whole ifland, and confequently as difficult for
me to catch them. This thought came into my
head, after I had carried it on, I believe, about fifty
yards: I therefore altered my fcheme, and refolved to
inclofe a piece of ground about 150 yards in length,
and 100 in breadth, fufficient enough for as many ;s
.would maintain me, till fuch time as my flock in-
creafed and then I could add more ground. I now
vigoroufly profecuted my work, and it took me about
three months in hedging the firft piece; in which
time I tethered the three kids in the beft part of it,
feeding them as near me as poffible, to make thfrt
familiar: and indeed I very often would carry forr.e
ears of barley, or a handful of rice and feed them
out of my hand; by which they grew fo tame, that
when my inclofure was finilhed, and I had lu
them loofe,. they would run after me for a handful
of corn. This indeed anfwered ir.y end ; and in a year
and a half's time I had a flock of about twelve goat?,
kids and all; and in two years after, they amount-
ed to forty three, befides what 1 had taken and kil-
led for my fuftenance. After which I inclofed fi-ve
feveral pieces of ground to feed them in, with pers
to drive them into, that I might take them as 1 had
occ.ifion. }
In this project I likewife found additional bleffings;
for I not ooly had plenty of goats flefh, put milk too,
which
which in my beginning I did not fo much as think
of. And indeed though I never had milked a cow
much lefs a go.u, or feen butter or cheefe made
yet after fome eflays and mifcarriages, I made me
both, and never afterwards wanted

geons and prifons! What a bounteous table was here
ipread in a wilderncls for me, where I expected no-
thing at^firft but to periih for hunger!
Certainly a Stoic would have fmilcd to have feen
me at dinner. There fat my royal majefty, an abfo-
Iute prince and ruler of my kingdom, attended by my
dutiful fubjeas, whom, if'l pleafed, I could either
hang, draw, quarter, give them liberty, or take it
away. When I dined, I feemed a king, eating a-
lone none daring to prefume to do fo till I had done.
Poll, as if he had been my principal court favourite,
was the only perfon permitted to talk wiih me. My
old, but faithful dog, now grown exceeding crazy
and who had found no fpecies to multiply his kind
iipon, continually fat on my right hand; while my
two cats fat on each fide of the table, expecting a bit
from my hand, as a principal mark of my royal favour.
Thefe were not the cats I had brought from the (hip;
they had been dead long before, and interred near my
habitation by mine own hand. But one of them, as
1 luppofe, generating with a wild cat, a couple of
their young 1 had made tame; the reft run wild into
.the woods, and in time grew fo impudent as to re-
turn and' plunder me of my ftores, till fuch time is I
ihot a great many, and the reft left me without trou-
bling me any more. In this plentiful manner did I
live, wanting for nothing but converfaiion. One
thing indeed concerned ;»e, the want of my boat;
I knew not which way to get her round the ifl.ind,
Oae time I relblved to go along the fhore by land to
licr; but had any one in England met fuch figure,
It would either have affrighted them, or made them
burft into laughter ; nay, I could not but finite my-
felf at my habit, which I think in this place will be
very proper to defcribe.
The cap I wore upon my head was great, high,
and (hapelefs, made of a goai's Ikin, with a flap or
penthoufe hanging down behind, not only to keep
the fun from-me, but to fhoot the rain off irom run-
ning into my neck, nothing being more pernicious
than the rain falling upon the ildli in theft: climates.
I had a fhort jacket of goats Ikin, whofe hair hung
-down fuch a length on either fide, that it reached
down to the calves of my legs. As for fhoes and
-ftockings, I had none, but made a refemblance of
fomething, I know not what to call them; they were
made like buikins, and laced on the fides like fpatter-
daihts barbaroufly (haped like the reft of my habit.
I had a broad belt of goats fkin dried, girt round me
with a couple of thongs, inftead of buckles ; on each
of which, to fupply the drriciency of fword and dag-
ger, hung my "hatchet and faw. I had another belt,
not to broad, yet faftened in the fame manner, which
hung over my fhoulder, and at the end of it, under
my leu arm, hung two pouches, made alfo of goats-
•fciu, to hold my powder and (hot. My bafket I car-
ried on my back and my gu-n on my Ihoulder; and
over my head a great clumiy ugly goat-lkin umbrella,
which, however, n«xt to my gun, was the moft ne-
ceflary thing about me. As for my face, the colour
was not 10 iwarthy as the Mulattoes, or as might have
been expected from one who eook fo little care of it,
in a climate within nine or ten degrees of the Equinox.
At one time my beard grew fo long that it hung down
above a quarter of a yard ; but as 1 had teeth razors
and fdfiars in ftore, 1 cut it all off, and fuffered none
to grow, except a large .pair of Mahometan whiskers,
the like of which I had feen worn by fome Turks «
Salee. not long enough indeed to hang a hat upon,
O but
but of fuch a monftrous fize, as would have amazd i,,.
.any in England to have feen. ;!"»tto
tfut all this was of no confequence here, there be-
ing none to obferve my behaviour or habit. And fo r
wt'hout fear and without control, I proceeded on my T^c
j'.urney, the profccution of which took me up five lj*«»tli(
or lix days. 1 fir It travelled along the fea fhore, di-
rectly to the place where ] firft brought my boat to
an anchor, to get upon the rocks; but having now
.no boat to take care of, I went over land a nearer way
to tne lame height that I was before upon; when
looking forward to the point of the rock, which lay
out, and which I was forced to double with my boat,
•1 was amazed to fee the fea fo fmooth and quiet, there
being no ripling motion, nor current, any more than
in other places. This made me ponder fome time
to guels the reafon of it, vhen at laft I was convin-
ced, that the ebb fetting from the weft ami joining
with the current of water from fome great river on
ihore, muft be the occafion of thefe rapid ftreams:
and that confequently, as the winds blew more weft--
\vardly, or more fouthwardly, fo the current came
the nearer, or went the farther from fhore. To fa-
tisfy my curiofity; I waited there till evening, when
the time of ebb being made, I plainly perceived from
- the rock the current again as before, with this diffe-
rence, that it ran farther off, near half a league from
the fhore; whereas, in my expedition, it let dole
upon it, furioufly hurrying me and my canoe along
with it, which at another time it would not have
.done. And now I was convinced, that, by obferving
the ebbing and flowing of the tide, I might eafily
bring ray boat round the ifland again. But when I
began to think of putting it in practice, the remem-
brance of the late danger ftruck me with fuch hor-
ror, that I changed my refolution, and formed an'
other, which was more fafe, though more laborious;
and this was to make another canoe, and fo have one
for one fide of the ifland. and one for the other.
Ibld ^
I had now two plantations in the ifland; the firft
my link fortification, fort, or caftle, with many large
and fpacious improvements: for by this time I had
enlarged the cave behind me with feveral little caves,
•one within another, to hold my bafkets, corn, and
ftraw. The piles with which I made my wall were
grown fo lofty and great as to obfcure my habitation,
And near this commodious and pleafent fettlement,
lay my well cultivated and improved corn fields,
which kindly yielded me its fruit in the proper fea-
fon: My fecond plantation was that near my coun-
try-feat or little bower, where my grapes flourifhed,
and where having planted many ftakes, I made in-
clofures for my goats, fo ftrongly fortified by labour
and time, that it was much ftronger than a wall,
and coafequently impoffible for them to break
through. As for my bower itfelf, 1 kept it conftant-
ly in repair, and cut the trees in fuch a manner,. as
made them grow thick and wild, and form a mod
tdelightful fhade. In the centre of this flood my tent,
ihus eredted. I had driven four piles in the ground,
fpreading over it a piece of the fhtp's fail; beneath
which I made me a fort of a couch with the fkins of
the creatures I had flam, and other things; and hav-
ing laid thereon one of the failors blankets, which I
tad faved from the wreck of the fhip, and covering
myfelf with a great watch coat, 1 took up this place
for my country retreat.
Very frequently from this fettlement did I ufe to
sifit my boat, and kept her in very good order. And
f..metimts I would venture in her a caft or two front
fhore, but no farther, left either a ftrong current, a
fudden ftormy wind, or fome unlucky accident,
fhnuld hurry me from the ifland, as before. But
now I entreat your attention, whilft I proceed to in-
form you of a new, but moft furpi ifing fcene of liftf
which here befel me.
You may eafily fuppofe, that, after having been
here fo lung, nothing-could be more amazing than
Da. ... to
to fee a human creature. One day it happened, that
going to my boat, I faw the print of a man's naked
loot on the fhore, very evident on the fand, as the
toes, heels, and every part of it. Had 1 feen an ap-
parition in the moft frightful fhape, I could not have
been more confounded. My willing ears gave the
flricteft attention. I caft my eyes around, but could
fkrisfy neither the one or the other. I proceeded al-
terna-tly to every part of the more, but with equal
cff''^; neither could I fee any other mark, though
the tand about it was as fufceptible to take impref-
fion, as that which was fo plainly ftamped. Thus
Struck witL conmfion and horror, I returned to my
habitation, frightened at every bufh and tree, taking
•every thing for men; and pofieffed with the wildeft
ideas! That night my eyes never clofed, I formed
nothing but the moft difinal imaginations, conclud-
ing it muft be the mark of the devil's foot which I
Jiad feen. For otherwife how could any mortal
.come to this ifland? Where was the (hip that tranf-
tfks?
jnore them ? and what figns of any other footfkps?
•*Ivhough thefe feemed very ftrong reafpns for fuch a
^uppofuion, yet (thought 1) why fhould the devil
iviake the print of his foot to no purpofe, as I can
i'ee, when he might have taken other ways to have
terrified me? Why fhould he leave his mark on the
other fide of the ifland, and that too oa the fand,
where the furging waves of the ocean might foon "lr«i
iiave eraled the impreffion. Surely this action is not ^ w
^onfiftent with the fubtilty of Satan, faid I to my-
felf; but rather muft be fome dangerous creature,
fotne wild favage of the main land over againft me,
that, venturing too far in the ocean, has been dri-
ven here, either by the violent currents or contrary
winds; and not caring to ftay on this defolate ifland,
Jias gone back to fea again.
Happy indeed, thought I myfelf, that none of the
favages had feen me in that place: yet I was not al-
together without fear, left, having found my boat.
they fliould return in numbers and devour me, or at
leaft carry away all my corn, and deftroy my flock
of tame goats: In a word, all my religious hopes va-
nifhed, as though I thought God could not now
protect me by his power, who had fo wonderfully
preferved me fo long.
What various ch.iins of providence are there in-
the life of man? How changeable are our affections,
according to different circumftances? We love to-
day, what we hate to-morrow; we fhun one hour
what we feek the ntxt. This was evident in me in
the moft confpicuous manner: for I, who before
had fo much lamented my condition, in being ba-
niihed from all humankind, was now even ready to
expire, when I confidered that a man had fet his
foot on this defolatc ifland. But when I confidered
my ftaiion of life, decreed by the infinitely wife and
good providence of God; that I ought not to dif-
pute my Creator's fovereignty, who had an undoubt-
ed right to govern and difpofe of his creatures as he
thinks convenient;i and that his juftice and mercy
could either punifh or deliver me : I fay, when I
confidered all this-, t comfortably found it my duty
to truft fincerely in him, pray ardently to him, and
humbly refign.myfelf to his divine will.'
One morning, lying on my bed, thefe words of
the facred writings came again into my mind, Call
upon me in the day of trouble, and I will deliver thee,
and tkouiba.lt-glorify m;. Upon this fentence, rifing.
more cheerful.ly from my bed, I offered up my pray-
ers-in the moft heavenly manner: and when I had
done, taking up my Bible to read, thefe words ap-
peared firft in my light r Wait on the Lord, and be of
good cheer, and he Jballftrengtbm thy heart: Wait, I
fay, on the Lord. Such divine comfort did this give
me,. as to remove all caufe of fadnefs upon that oc-
cafion.
Thus, after a world of apprehenfions and fears,
fbr three days and nights, 1 at Isft ventured out of
D 3.. , my.
-
caftle, and milked my goats, one of which was
almoft fpoiled for want of it. 1 next (though in-
great fear) vifited my bower, and milked my flocks
there alfo; when growing bolder, I went down to
the fhore again, and measuring the print of the foot
to mine, to fee perhaps whether I myfelf had not
occafioned that mark. I found it much fuperior in
largenefs; and fo returned home, now abfolutely
convinced, that either fome men had been afhore, or
that the ifland muft be inhabited; and therefore
that I might be furprifed before I was aware.
I now began to think of providing for my fecuri-
ty, and revolved in my mind many different fchemes
-for that purpofe; I firft propofed to -cut down my
iridofures, and turn my tame cattle wild into the
that the enemy might not find them, and
the ifhnd in hopes of killing the fame. Se-
fondly, I was for digging up my corn fields for the
very fame reafon. And, laflly, I concluded to de-
•gnoiifa my bower, left feeing a place of human cot)-
trivance, they might come farther, and find out and
me in rny littic caftle.
iich notions did the fear of danger fuggeft to me;
1 Looked, 1 thought,- like the unfoitunate king
when not only opp.refied by the Philiftines
l>ut si'fo forfaken by God himfelf. And it is finance
tha1 a little befpre, having entirely refigned myfelf
to the will of Gcd, 'I (hould now have fo little conli-
jence in him, fearing thofe more who could kill
this fading body, than he who could dtftroy n;y im-
uiortalfoul. ...
Sleep was an utter ftranger to tny eyes that mght;
.et nature fpeut and tired, fubmitted to a filent re-
oofe the nex.t morning. And then, joining reafon
with my fear, Iconfidered, that this delightful and
pleafant ifland might uol be fo entirely forfaken as I
might think; but that the inhabitants from -the o-
ther fhore might fail either with defign,--er from ne-
cefiity, by crofs winds; .and if the latter circuqi-
- •' - . . ftance,
k a'u'C
>v
ftance, I had reafon to believe they would depnrt the
fiVft oppor.unity. However, my fear made me think
of a place for retreat upon an attack.. I now repent-
ed that I had made my door to come out beyond my
fortification ;'to remedy which, I refolved to make
me a fecond one : I fell to work, therefore, and.
drove betwixt that double tow of trees, which I
phnred about twelve years before, feveral ftrong
piles, thickening it with pieces of timber and o!cl
cables, and (lengthening the foot of it with earth
which I dug out of my cave; I alfo made me feveu
holes, wherein I planted my muikets like cnnnon^..
fining them into frames refembling carriages. 'ihi*
feeing tinifhe4 with indefatigable industry, for a gre.'C
way every where, I planted flicks of oiler like ii,
wood, about twenty thoufand of them, leaving a-
large fpace between them and my wall, that I might
have room to fee an enemy, and that they might not
be fheltered among the young trees, if they offered
to approach the outer wall. And indeed fcarce two
years had pafled over my head, when there appear-
ed a lovely fhady grove, and in fix years it became
a thick wood perfectly. impaflable. For rny fafety
I left no.avenue to go in or out at; infte,id of which
I (et two ladders, one to a part of the rock which
was low. and then broke ini leaving room to place
another ladder upon that; fo that when 1 took thofe
down, it was impoffible for any man to defcend with-
out hurting himfelf; and if they had, they would
ftill be at the outfide of my cuter wall. But while
- I took all thefe meafures of human prudence for my
own prefervation, I was not altogether unmindful
of other affairs. To preferve my hock of tame goats
that the enemy fhould not take all at once, I look-
ed out for the moft retired part of the ifland, which
was the place where I had 16ft myfelf before-men-
tioned, and there finding a clSar piece of land, con-
taining three acres, furrounded with thick woods, I
wrought fo hard, that, in lefs than a month's time, I
... D 4 fenced I
fenced it fo well round, that my flocks were
well fecurcd in it, and I put therein two he-goats
and ten (he-ones.
AH this labour was occafioned purely by fear-
ful apprehenfions, on account of feeing the print of
a man's foot. And not contented yet with what I
had done, I fearched for another place towards the
veeft point of the ifland, where I might alfo retain
a nother flock. Then wandering on this errand more
to the weft of the ifland than ever I had yet done,
and cafting my eyes towards the fea, methought I
perceived a boat at a great diftance; but could not
pofTibly tell what it was for want of my perfpeftive
fjlaf- I confidered then it was no firapge thing ta
i'ec the print ^f a man's-fioot; and concluding them
cannibals, bkrled God for my being caft on the
other fide of the ifland, where none of the favages,
as I thought, ever came. But when I came down
kill to the fhore, which was the S. W. point of . —.
ifknrl, 1 was foon confirmed in my opinion ; nor '''£
any one deicribe my horror and amazement,
n 1 Taw the ground fpread with fcuUs, hands,.
feet, and bones of human bodies; and particularly
j perceived a fpace like a circle, in the midft or
vbkh had been a fire, about which I conjectured
rbcfe wretches fat, and unnaturally facrifked and
jevoured their fellow-creatures.
The horror and loathfbmenefs of this dreadful
fpscttcle, both confounded my fenfes, and made me
iicharge from my ftomach in an exceffive manner*
then returned towards my habitation; and in my
thither fhedding floods of tears, ana falling
on my bended knees, gave God thanks for
my nature contrary to thefe wretches, and
ng me fo long out of their hands.
'.Though reafon and my long rcfidence here had af-
fured me, that thefe favages never came up to the
thick woody parts of the country, and that i had no
reafon to be apprehenfive of a difcovery ; yet fuch an
abhomnce
abhorrence did I ftill retain, that for two years after •
I confined mytelfonly to my three plantations; I
mean my caftle, country feat, and inclofure in the
woods. And though, in procefs of time, my dread-
ful apprehenfions began to wear away, yet my eyes
were move vigilant for fear of being furprifed, and I
was very cautious of firing my gun, left being heard
by thofe creatures, they fhould proceed to attack me.
I refolved, however, manfully to lofe my life if they'
d-id, and went armed with three piftols ftuck in my •
girdle; which added to the defcnption I have given
of myfelf before, made me- look with a very formi-
dable appearance,,
Thus my circumftaoces for fome time remained'
Tery calm and undifturbed; and when I compared
my condition to others, I found it far from being
miferable. And indeed would° all perfons compare
their circumftances, not with thofe above them, but
with thofe innumerable unhappy objects beneath .
them,. I am fure we ihould not hear thofe daily mur-
murings and complainings that are in the world. •
For my part, I wanted but few things. Indeed the •
terror which the favages had put me in, fpoiled
fome inventions for my own conveniencies. One of my
projects was to brew me fome beer; a very whimfical
one indeed* when it is conildered, that 1 had neither'
ciiks fufficient, nor could I make any to preferve ic
iq ;-neither had I hops to make it keep, yeft to'
- 'make it work'/ nor a copper or kettle to make it -
'boil. Perhaps, indeed, after fome years, I might
bring this to bear, as I had done other things.- But •
•
pow my inventions were placed another way; and .
day and night I could think of no'thing but how 1
might deftroy fome of thefe cannibals, when pro-
ceeding to their bloody entertainments; and fo fa-
cing a victim from being facriGced, that he might af-
ter become my tenant.- Many were my contrivan- •
ces for this purpofe, and as many more objections
occurred, after I hatched them. I once contri- -
D ved-••'
-ved to dig a hole under the place where they made
•their fire, and put therein five or fix pounds of gun-
powder, which would confequently blow up all thofe
that were near it; but then I was loath to fpend fo
xnuch upon them, left it fhould not do that certain
execution I could defire; and but only affright, and
not kill them. Having laid this defign afide, I again
propofed to myfelf to lie privately in ambufh, in
forne convenient place, with my three guns double
loaded, and let fly at them in the midft of their
dreadful ceremony; and having killed two or three of
them at every fhot, fall upon the reft fuddenly with
rny three piftols, and not let one mother's fon efcape.
IThJs imagination pleafed my fancy fo much, that I
-ufed to dream of it in the night-time. To put my
Jefign in execution, I was not long feeking for a
place very convenient for my purpofe, where unfeen
I might behold every acYion of the favages. Here I
placed my two m'ufkets, each of which was loaded
•vvith a brace of flugs, and four or five fmaller bul-
lets, about the fize of piftol bullets; the fowling-
piece was charged with near a handful of the largeft
•fvian fhot; and in every piftol were about four bul-
lets. And thus all things being prepared, nofooner
-tvould the welcome light fpread over the element, ,,
but like a giant refrejhed -wiih -winet as the fcripture t^'
has it, would I iffue forth from my caftle, and from ^
a lofty hill, three miles diftant, view if I could fee -. «Mi
any invaders approach unlawfully to my kingdom.
But having waited in vain two or three months,
it not only grew very tirefome to me, but brought
me into fome confideration, and made me examine
myfelf, what right I had to kill thefe creatures in
this manner. , .
If (argued I to myfelf) this unnatural cuftom of
theirs be a fin offenfive to heaven, it belongs to the
Divine Being, who alone has the vindictive power in
his hands, to fhower down his vengeance upon
them. And perhaps he does to, in making them be-
r » come
come one another's executioners. Or, if nor, if
God thinks thefe doings juft, according to the know-
ledge they conceive, what authority have I to pretend
to thwart the decrees of providence, which has per- •
mitted'thefe actions for fo many ages, perhaps from
almoft the beginning of the creation? They never
offended me, what right have I then to concern my-
felf in their fhedding one another's blood? /nd in- •
deed I have fince known, they value no more to kill
and devour a captive taken in war, than we do to
kill an ox-or eat mutton. I then concluded, it ne-
ccflarily followed, that thefe people were r.o more
murderers'• than Chriftians, who many times put
whole troops to the fword after throwing down their
arms. . Again I confidered, that if I fell upon them,
I fhould be as much in the wrong as the Spaniards.
who had committed the gieateit barbarities upon
thefe people who never had offended them in then-
whole lives; as if the kingdom of Spain was eminent
for a race of men without common compafllon'to the
miferable, a principal fign of the moft generous tem-
per. Thefe confiderations made me paufe, and
brought me to think I had taken wrong mea£ures in
my refolution 5 I now argued with myfelf, that it was -
better for me never to attack, but to rerrairv.undif-
covered as long as poffibly I could; that an oppofite •
conduit would certainly prove dcftruftive; for as ic
was fcarcely to be fuppofed I could kill them al), I
might either be .overpowered by the remaining, or
that fome efcaping, might bring thoufands to my
certain'deftruction. And indeed religion took their
part fo much as to convince me, how contrary it was -
to my duty to be guilty of fhedding human blood,
innocent as to my'particular, whatever they are to •
one another; that I had.nothing to do with it, but
leave it to the God of all power and dominion, as I
faid before, to do therein what feemed convenient to
bis heavenly wifdom. And therefore on my knees I
thanked the Almighty for delivering me from blood.
D 6 'guiltincfe =

guiltinefs, and begged his protection that I might
never fall into their hands.
Thus giving over an attempt which I had rafhly
begun, 1 never afcendcd the hill on that octafion af-
terwards; I only removed my boat, which fay on the
other fide of the ifland, -and every thing that belong-
ed to her, towards the eaft, inte a little cove, that
there might not be the leaft fhadow of difcovery of
any boat near, or habitation upon the ifland My
caftle then became my cell, keeping always retired in
Jr, except when I went out to milk my fhc-goats,
and order my little flock in the wood, which was
quite out of danger; for fure I was, that thefe fa-
v.ages never came here with expectations to find any
tIiing, and confequently never wandered from the
coaft; however, as they might have feveral times
been on fhore as well before as after my dreadful ap-
prehenfions, 1 looked back with horror to think in
-tvhat a ftate I might have been in, had 1 fuddenly met
tIiem flenderly armed, with one gun only loaded with
frnall fhot; and how great would have been iny a-
ynazement, if, inftead of feeing the print of one man's
foot, I had perceived fifteen or twenty favages, who
Jiaving once fet their eyes upon me, by the fwifinefs
of their feet, would have left me no poffibility of
efcaping? Thefe thoughts would fink my very foul,
£o that I would fall into a deep melancholy, till fuch
time as the confideration of my gratitude to the di-
vine Being moved it from my heart. I then fell into
a contemplation of the fecret fprings of Providence;
»nd how wonderfully we are delivered, when infen-
£ble of it; and when intricated in uncertain mazes
or labyrinths of doubt or hefitation, what fecret hint
directs us in the right way, when we intended to go
out of it; nay, perhaps, contrary to our bufinefs,
fenfe, or inclination. Upon which, I fixed within
,ne ,this as a certain rule, never to difobcy thofe fe-
cret impreffions of mind to the acting or not acting
thing that offered, for »fckh I yet «ottW affign
no
Bo reafon. But let it be how it will, the advantage
of this conduct very eminently appeared in the latter
part of my abode on this ifland: I am a ftranger in.
determining whence thefe fecret intimations of pro-
vidence derive: yet methinks they are not only fome
proof of the converfe of fpirits^ but alfo of the fe-
cret communications they are fuppofed to have with
thofe that have not pafied through the gloomy vale
of death.
Thefe anxieties of mind, and the care of my pre-
fervation, put a period to all future inventions and
contrivances, either for accomodation or conveni-
ence -r 1 now cared not to drive a nail, chop a ftick,
fire a gun, or make a fire, left, either the noife
fhould be heard, or the fmoke difcover me. And on
this account I ufed to burn my earthen ware private-
ly in a cave which I found in the wood, and which I
made' convenient for that purpofe; the principal
caufc that brought me here was to make char-
coal, .-fo that I might bake and drefs my bread and
meaf without any danger. At that time a curious
accident happened me, which I fhall now relate.
While I was cutting down fome wood for making
my charcoal, I perceived a cavity behind a very
thick branch of underwood. Curious to look into it,
I attained its mouth, and perceived it fufficient for
me to Hand upright in it. But when I had entered,
and took a further view, two rolling fhining eyes,
like flaming ftars, feemed to dart (hemfelves at me;
fo that 1 made all the hafte out.that I could; as not
knowing whether it was the devil, or a monfler that
had taken his refidence in that place. When I re-
covered a little from my furprife, I called myielf a
thoufand fools, for being afraid to fee the devil one
moment, who had now almoft lived twenty years in
the moft retired folitude. And therefore refuming
all the courage I had, I took up a flaming fire-brand,
and in I rufhed again. I had not proceeded above three
fteps, when I was more affrighted than before; for
then
then I heard a very loud figh like that of a hiimnm
-creature in the greateft agony, fucceeded with abro-<
Jcen noife, refembling words half expreflcd, and then
a. broken figh again. Stepping back, Lord! ( though
I to myfelf), where am I got? into what inchanted
place have I.plunged myfelf, fuch as are reported to .
contain miferable captives, till death puts an end to
their forrow .'-and, indeed, in fuch a great amaze-
inenc was I, that it ftruck me into a cold fweat: and
bad my hat been on my head, I believe my hair
would have moved it offi But again encouraging
myfelf with the hopes of God's protection, I pro-
Deeded forward and, by the light of iny firebrand,
perceived it to be a monftrous he-goat, lying on the
ground, gafping for life, and dying of mere old age<-
J^K. firft I ftirred him, thinking to drive him out;
and the poor ancient creature ftrove to get upon his
feet, but was not able ; fo I e'en let him lie ftill, to af^
fright the favages fhould they venture into this cave.
I now looked round me, and found the place but
ftnall and fhapeh-fs. At the farther fide of it 1 per- -
t-eived a fort of an entrance, yet fo low, as muft
oblige me to creep on my hands and knees to it; fo,
li-aving no candle, I fufpended my enterprife till the
next day, and then I carne provided with two large (
ones of my own making.
Having crept upon my hands and feet through this'
it, I found the roof rofe higher up, I think about
ty feet. But furely never mortal faw fuch a glo-
fight before.!' The roof and walls of this cave •
l.erlected a hundred thoufand lights to me fr»m my
tv*ro candles, as though they were indented with
Chining gold, precious ftones, or fparkling diamond?,
^nd indeed it was the moft delightful cavity or grot-
to of its kind that could be defired, though. entirely
^iark. The floor was dry and level, and had a kind
of grave' upem it; Bo naufeous venomous creatures
to be feen there neither any damp or wet about it. I
could find no fault but in the entrance, and I began
to ,
.-,.---••'
to think that even this might be very neccflary for
my defence, and therefore refolved to make.it my
moft principal magazine. I brought hither ,rwo.
fowling-pieces, and three mulkets, leaving only five
pieces at my caftle, planted in the mar.iier of cannon.
In a barrel of gun-powder, which I took up out of
the fea, I brought away about fixty poundslof good
powder, which were not damaged; and thefe, with.
a great quantity of lead for bullets, I removed from
my caftle to this retreat, now fortified both by art
. and nature.
I fancied myfelf now like ope of the giants of old,
who were fa-id to live in caves and holes among the
rocks, inacceffible to any but themfelves, or, at
leaft, moft dangerous to attempt. -And now 1 de?
fpifed both the cunning and ftrength of the fatages,..
either to find me out or to hurt me.
But I muft not forget the old goat, who caufed try.
late dreadful amazement. The poor creature gave
up the ghoft the day after my difcovery; and it be-
ing very difficult to drag him out, I dug his grave,
and honourably intombed him in the fame place
where he departed, with as' much ceremony as any
Welch goat that has been interred about the high
mountain Penmenmoure.
1 think. I was now in the twemy-third year of my
reign, and my thoughts much eafier than formerly,
having contrived feveral pretty amufements and di-
verfions to pafs away the time in a pleafant manner.
By this time my pretty Poll had learned to fpeak
Englifh, and pronounc* his words very articulately
and plain; fo that for many hours we ufed to chat
together after a very familiar manner, and he lived
with me no lefs than twenty fix years. My dog, who
was nineteen years old,'flxteen of which he lived with
me, died fometime ago of mere old age. As for my
cats, they multiplied fo faft, that I was forced to kill
or drive them into the woods, except two or three,
which became my particular favourites. Befides
thefe,
*
 
yrovementsi I returned directly to my caftle, pulled
ip ihe ladder after me, making all things look as wild
iud natural as poffibly I could. In the next place, I
thefe, I continually kept two or three houfehold? ''biSe],
kids about me, whom I did learn to feet out of my
hand, and two more parrots who could talk indif-
ferently, and call Robinfon Crufoe, but not fo excel-
lently as th« firft, as not taking that pains with
them. I had alfo feveral jfea-fowls which I had
wounded and cut their wings; and growing tame,
they ufed to breed among the low trees about my caf- ,..,1^
tie-walls; all which made my abode very agreeable.
But what unforefeen events fuddenly deftroy the
enjoyments of this uncertain ftate of life, when we
Jeaft expect them! It was now the month of De-
cember. in the fou.thern folitice, and particular time (coo
of my hirveft, which required my attendance in the i«u. .'"
fields; when going out pretty early one morning,
before it was day-light, there appeared to me, front
5*-
the fea-fhore, a flaming light, about two miles from j...
rnc, at the eaft end of the ifland, where I had ob-- »'
ftrved Tome favages had been before, not on the o-
tber fide, but to my great affli<5tion it was on my fide
of the ifland.
Struck with a terrible furprife, . and my ufual ap-
prrehenfions, that the favages would perceive my im--
'
ss
H
•-,,..
myfelf in a pofture of defence, loading my mul-
:ets and piftols, and committing myfelf to God's |\ n
n-otection, I refolved to defend myfelf till my.laftr
'reath. Two hours after, impatient for intelligence,
fet my ladder up to the fide of the hill, where there
.-us aflat place; and then pulling the ladder after me,
fcended to the top, where laying myfelf on my bel.
ff with my perfpective glafs, I perceived no lefs than •
ine naked favages, fitting round a fmall fire, eating,
5 I Tuppofed, human flefh, with their two canoes
allied on Ihore, waiting for the flood to carry them
£F again. You cannot eafily exprefs the conftcrna-
oo I was in at this fight, efpecially feeing them near
me 5 but when I perceived their coming muft be al-
ways with the current of the ebb, I became more ea-
fy in my thoughts, being very fully convinced, that I
might go abroad with fecur/y all the time of flood,
if they were not before landed. And indeed this
proved juft as I imagined ; for no fooner did they all
take boat and paddle away, but the tide made N. Wi
Before they went off they danced, making ridiculous
poftures and geftures, for above an hour, all ftark
caked; but whether men or women, or both, I
could not perceive. When I faw them gone, I took
two guns upon my fhoulders, and placing a couple
of piftols in my belt, with my great fword hanging
by my fide, I went to the hill, where at firft 1 made
a difcovery of thefe cannibals, and then faw there
had been three canoes more of the favages on fhore
at that place, which, with the reft, were making o-
vtr to the main laud.
But nothing could be more horrid to me, than when,
going to the place of facrifice, the blood, the bones,
and other mangled parts of human bodies appeared
hi my fight: and-fo fired was I with indignation^
that I was fully refolved to be revenged on the firft
that came there, though I loft my life in the execu«
lion. It then appeared to me, that the vifits which
they make to this ifland are not very frequent, it
b^ing fifteen months before they came again: but
ftill I was very uneaiy, by reafon of the difmal ap-
prehenfions 1 had of their furprifing me unawares;
nor dared I offer to fire a gun on that fide of the
ifiand where they ufed to appear, left taking the a-
larm, the favages might return with many hundred
canoes, and then God knows in what manner I
fiiould have made my end. Thus was I a year or more
before Ifaw any of thefe devouring cannibals again.
• But to wave this, the following accident, which
demands attention, for a while,. eluded the force of
my thoughts in revenging myfelf on thofe heathens.
On
On the i6th of May (according to my wooden ca-
lendar) the wind blew exceeding.hard, accompanied
with abundance of lightening and thunder all day,
and lucceeded by a very ftormy night. The feeming
anger of the heavens made me have recourfe to my
Bible. Whilft I was ferioufly pondering upon it, I
was fuddenly alarmed with the noife of a gun, which
I conjectured was fired upon the ocean. Such an
unufual furprife made me ftart up in a minute, when
\yith my ladder afcending the mountain as before,
that very moment a flafh of tire prefaged the repoit
of another gun, which 1 prefemly heard, and found
it was from that part of the fea where the current
drove me away. I could not but then think, that
this muft be a fhip in diftrefs, and that thefe were
the melancholy fignals fora fpeedy deliverance. Great
indeed was my fbrrow upon this occafion; but my
labours to affift them muft have proved altogether
vain and fruitlefs. However, I brought together all
the dry wood that was at hand, and making a preity
large pile, fet it on fire on the hill. I was certain
they plainly perceived it, by their firing another gun
as foon as it began to blaze, and after that feveral
more from the fame quarter. All night long I kept
up my fire; and when the air cleared up, I perceiv-
ed fomething a great way at fea, directly E. but
could not diftinguifh what it was, even with my
glafs, by reafon the weather was fo very foggy out
at fea. However, keeping my eye.s directly fixed up-
on it, and perceiving it not to ftir, 1 prefently conclu-
ded it muft be a fhip at anchor, and fo very hafty I
was to be fatisfied, that, taking my gun, I went to
the S. E. part of the ifland, to the fame rocks where
I had been formerly drove away by the current; in
which time the weather being perfectly cleared up,
to my great forrow, I perceived the wreck of a (hip
caft away upon thofe hidden rocks I found when I
was out with my boat; and which, by making a
..' 'kindL
.laft,
kind of an eddy, were the occafion of my prefenra-
tion.
Thus, what is one man's fafety is another's ruin;
for undoubtedly this fhip had been driven on them in
the night, the wind blowing ftrong at E. N. E. Had
they perceived the ifland, as 1 now giiefled they had
not, certainly, infiead of having fired their guns for
help, they would rather have ventured in their boat,
and favcd themfelves that way. 1 fhen thought, that
perhaps they had done fo, upon feeing my fire, and
were caft away in the attempt -, for I perceived no
boat in the (hip. But then again I imagined, that
perhaps they had another vefiel in company, which,
upon fignal, faved their lives, and took the boat
ap : or that the boat might be driven -into the main
ocean, where thefe poor creatures might be in the
inoft nriferable condition. But as all thefe conjec-
tures were very uncertain, I could do no more than
commiferate their diftrefs and thank God for deli-
vering me, in particular, when fo many perifhed in
the raging ocean.
When I confidered ferioufly tvery thing concern-
ing this wreck, and could perceive no room to fup-
pofe any of them faved, I cannot explain by any pof-
l<ble force of words, what longings my foul felt upon
this fight, often breaking out in this manner: O that
there had been but two or.three, nay even one per-
(on faved, that we might have lived together, con-
vei fed with, and comforted one another! And fo
much were niy deflres moved, that when I repeated
thefe wonJs, " Oh! that there had been but one!'
my hands would fo clinch together, and my fingers
prefs the palms of my hands fo clofe, that, had any
foft thing been between, it would have cruflied it in-
voluniaiiiy, while my teeth would ftrike together,
and fet againft each other fo ftiong, that it required
fome iime for me to part them.
''fill the laft year of my being on this iflard, I ne-
ver kqew whether ov not any had been faved out of
this
I
this fhip, I had the affliction fomc time after, to fet
the corpfe of a drowned boy come on fhore, at the
end of the ifland which was next the fhipwreck:
there was nothing on him but a feaman's waiftcoat,
a pair of open-kneed linen drawers, and a blue linen
fhirt -f but no particular mark to guefs what nation
he was of. In his pocket were two pieces of eight,
and a tobacco-pipe, the laft of which I preferred
much more than I did the firft. And now the calm-
nefs xof the fea tempted me to venture oat in my boat
to this wreck, not only to get fomething necefiaiy out
of the fhip, but perhaps fome living creature might
be on board, whofe life I might preferve. This had
fuch an influence upon my mind, that immediately I
went home, and prepared every thing neceflary for
the voyage, carrying on board my boat provifionsof
all forts, with a good quantity of rum, frefh water,
and a compafs: fo putting off I paddled the canoe
along the fhore, till I came at laft to the north eaft
part of the ifland, from whence I was to launch into
the ocean; but here the currents ran fo violently,
and appeared fo terrible, that my heart began to.
fail me; forefeeing, that if I was driven Jnto any
of thefe currents I might be carried not only out of
the reach or fight of the ifland, but even inevitably
loft in the boiling furges of the ocean-.
So opprefled was I at thefe troubles, that I gave
over my enterprife, failing to a little creek on the
fhore, wllere ftepping out, I fat me down on a rifmg
hill, very penfive and thoughtful. 1 then perceived
that the tide was turned, and the flood came on,
which made it impracticable for me to go out for fo
many hours. To be more certain bow the fets of
the tides or currents lay when the flood came in, I
afcended a higher piece of ground, which overlook-
ed the fea both ways; and here I found, that as the
current of the ebb fet out clcfe by the fouth point of
the iflmd, fo the current of the flood fet in clofe by
the fhore of the. north fide; and all that I had to
do
do, was to keep to the north of the ifland in my re-
turn.
That night I rcpofed myfelf in .my canoe, covered
with my watch-coat iuftead of a blanket, the heavens
being my tefter. I fct out with the fifft of the tide
full north, till I felt the benefit of the current, which
tarried me at a great rate eaftward, yet not withfuch
ftnpetuofity as before, as to take me from all govern-
ment of my canoe; fo that in two hours time I came
up to the wreck, which appeared to me a moft me^
lancholy fight. It Teemed to be a Spanifh teflel by
its building, ftuck faft between two rocks; her ftern
and quarter beaten to pieces by the fea; her main-
maft and foremaft were brought off by the board;
that' is, broken fhort 6ft". As 1 approached nearer, I
perceived a dog on board, who feeing me coming,
yelped and cried; and no fooner did 1 call him, but
the poor creature jumped into the fea, out of which
1 took him up, almoft famifhed with hunger and
thirft; fo that when I gave hini a cake of bread, no
ravenous wolf could devour it more greedily; and
he drank to that degree -6f frefh water, that he
would have burft himfelf, had I fuffered him.
The firft fight I met with in the fhip, were two
msn drowned in the cook-room or forecaftle, incio-
fed in one another's arms: hence I very probably
fuppofed, that when the veflel ftruck in the ftorm,
fo high and inceflantly did the waters break in, and
over her, that the men not being able to bear it,
were ilrangled, by the conftant rufhing in of the
waves. There were feveral calks of liquor, whether
wine or brandy I could not be poiitive, which lay in
the lower hold, as were plainly perceptible by the
ebbing out of the water, yet were too large for me to
pretend to meddle with> likewi(e 1 perceived feveral
ehefts, which I fuppoled to belong to the feamen,
two of which I got inio my boat, without exami-
ning what was in them. Had the ftern of the iliip
been fixed, and the iere part biokea off,,.! fhould
have.
have .made a very profperous voyage; fiace, by what
I after found in thefe two chefts, I could not other-
wife conclude, but that the fhip muft have abun-
dance of wealth on board; nay, if I muft guefs by
the courfe fhe fteered, fhe muft have been bound
from the Buenos Ayres, or the Rio de la Plata, ia
the fouthern part of America, beyond the BraIils
to the Havannih, in the gulph of Mexico, and fo
perhaps to Spain. What became of the reft of her
failors, I could not certainly tell ;• and all her riches
fignified nothing at that time to any body.
Searching farther, I.found a calk, containing a-
bout twenty gallons, full of liquor which, with fomc
labour, 1 got into my boat ; in a cabin were feveral
mulkets, which 1 let remain there; but took away
with me a great powder-horn, with about four
pounds of powder in it. I took alfo a fire-fhovd
and tongs, two brafs kettles, a copper pot to make
chocolate, and a gridiron; all which were extreme-
ly nectffkry to me, efpecially the fire-fhovel and
tongs. And fo with thjs cargo, accompanied with.
rny dog, I came away, -the tide ferving for that pur-
pofe; and the fame evening, about an hour within
night, I attained the ifland, after the greateft toil
and fatigue imagipable. . ... .. ,
That night J repofed my wearied limbs in the
boat, refolving the next morning to harbour what I
Jiad gotten in u>y new-found fubterraneous grotto;
and not carrying my cargo home to my ancient ca-
fc.\e. Having refrefhed myfelf, and got all my ef-
fects on fhore, I next proceeded to examine the p.-ir-
ticulars ; and fo tapping the calk, I found the liquor
to be a kind of rum, but not like what we had at
the Brazils, nor indeed near fo good. At the open-
ing of the cheft, feveral things appeared very ufeful
to me; for inftance, I found in one a very fine cafe
of bottles, containing the fineft and btft forts of cor-
dial waters; each bottle held about three pints, cu-
r-roufLy tipt with filver. I found alfo two pots full
of
"<in
^.i
of the <hoiceft fweetmeats, and two more which the
water had utterly fpoiled. There were likewife fe-
vepal good fhirts, exceeding welcome to me, and a-
bout one dozen and a half of white linen handker-
chiefs and coloured neckcloths, the former of which
were abfolutely neceflary for wiping my face in a hot
day; and in the till, I found three bags of pieces of
eight, about eleven hundred in all, in one of which,
decently wrapt up in a piece of paper, were fix dou-
bloons of gold, and fome fmall bars and wedges of
the fame metal, which 1 believe might weigh near A
pound In the other cheft, which I guefled to be-
long to the gunner's mate, by the mean circumftan-
ces that attended it, I only found fome cloaths of ve-
ry little value, except about two pounds ot fine gla-
zed powder, in three flidks, kept, as I believe, for
charging their fowling pieces on any occafion. So
that, on the whole, I had no great advantage by this
voyage. The money was indeed as mere dirt to
me, ufelefs and unprofitable, all which I would have
freely parted with for two or three Englilh pair of
fhoes and ftockings, things that for many years I
had not worn, except lately thofe which I had taken
off" the feet of thofe unfortunate men I found drown-
ed in the wreck, yet not io good as Englilh fhoe?,
either for eafe or fervice. 1 alib found in the fea-
man's cheft about fifty pieces of eight in rials, but
no gold; fo concluded thatv what I took frorn the
firft belonged to an officer, the latter appearing to
have a much inferior perfon for its owner. How-
ever, as defpicable as the money feemed, I likewife
luggtd it to my cave, laying it up fecurcly, as 1 did
the reft of my cargo ; and after 1 had done all this,
I returned back to my boat, rowing or paddling her
along till I came to my ol-d harbour, where I. care-
fully laid her up, and fo made the be ft of my way to
my caftie. When I arrived there, every thing feem-
ed fafe and quiet: fo that now my only bufincfs
was to repofe myfelf after my wonted manner, and
take
take care of my domeftic affairs. But though I might
have lived very eafy, as wanting for nothing abfo-
lutely needful, yet (till I was more vigilant than u-
fual upon ac count of the favages, nerer going much
abroad; or, ifI did, re was to the eaft part of the
lfland, where I was well allured that the Ravages ne-
ver came, and where I might not be troubled to car-
ry that heavy load of weapons for my defence, as I
was obliged to do if I went the other way.
Two years did I live in this anxious condition, in
all which time, contrary to my former refolutions,
my head was filled with nothing but projects and de-
figns, how I might efcape from this ifland; and fo
xnuch were my wandering thoughts bent on a ram-
Ttling difpofition, that had I had the fame boat that
I went from Salee in, I ffeould have ventured one?
.niore to the uncertainty of the raging ocean.
I cannot however but confider myfelf as one of
the unhappy perfons, who make themfelves wretch-
ed by their diiTatisfaction with the ftations which
Cod has placed ihem in; for, not to take a review
of my primitive condition-, and my father's excellent
advice, (the going contrary to which was, as I may
Jay, my original fin), the following miftakes of the'
fume nature certainly had been the means of ray pre-
fent unhappy ftation. What bufmefs had I to leave
a fettled fortune, and well-ftccked plantation, im-
proving and increafing, where, by this time, I might
have been worth a hundred thoufand moidores, to
turn fupercargo to Guinea, to fetch negroes. when
time and pati.-nct would have fo much enlarged mf
flock at home, as to be able to employ thole whole
more immediate buftnefs it was to fetch them home,
even to my own door?
But as this is commonly the fate of young heads,
•fo a ferious reflection upon the folly of it ordinarily
attends the exercife of future years, when the dear-
Jioiight experience of time teaches us repentance.
was « with me; but noiwithftanding the
thought*
thoughts of my deliverance ran fo ftron;'ly in my
mind, that it feemed to check all the dictates of res-
fon and philofophy. And now, to ulher in my
kind reader with great pleafure to the remaining
part of my relation, I flatter myfelf it wiH not be
taken aruifs, to give him an account of my firft con-
ceptions of the manner of efcaping, and upon what
foundation I laid my foolifh fchemes.
Having retired to my caftle, after my late voyage
to the fhip, my frigate laid up and fecured, as ufual,
and my condition the fame as before, except being
richer, though I had as little occafion for riches as
the Indians of Peru had for gold, before the cruel
Spaniards came among them: one night in March,
being the rainy feafon, in the four and twentieth
year of my folitude, I lay down to fleep, very well
in health, without diftemper, pain, or uncommon
uneafinefs, either of body or mind; yet notwith-
ftanding I could not compofe myfelf to fleep Sll the
night long. All this tedious while, it is impoffible
to exprefs what innumerable thoughts came into my
head. I traced quite over the whole hiftory of my
life in minia'ure, from my utmoft remembrance of
things till I came to this ifland; and then proceeded
to examine every action and paflage that had occurred
fince I had taken pofieffion of my kingdom. In my
reflections upon the latter, 1 was comparing the
happy pofture of my aflairs in the beginning of
my reign, to this life of anxiety, fear, and concern,
fince I had difcovered the print of a foot in the fand;
that while I continued without apprehenfion, I was
incapable of feeling the dread and terror I now fuf-
fered. How thankful rather ought I to have been
for the knowledge of my danger, fince the greateft
happinefs one can be poflefled of is to have fufficient
time to provide againft it? How ftupendous is the
goodnefs of providence, which fets fuch narrow
bounds to the fight and knowledge of human nature",
E - that

•that while men walk in the midft of fo many dangers,
they are k?pt fcrene and calm, by having the events
o. tiiings hid from their eyts, and knowing nothing
of thole many dangers that fin-round them, till per-
.haps they are diffipared and vanifh away.
When 1 came more particularly to confider of the
•real danger 1 had for fo many years efcaped; how I
tfrad walked about in the greateft fecurity and tran-
quillity, at a time, perhaps, when even nothing but
the brow ol a hill, a great tree, or the common ap-
proach of night, had imerpofed between me and the
deftructive hands of the cannibals, who would devour
tr.e with as good an appetite, as I would a pigeon
or cui lieu; furely all this, I fay, could not but make
rne fincerely thankful to my great Preferver, whofs
,fing.ul.ir protection I acknowledged with the greattft
Jiumility, and without which I muft inevitably have
fallen into the <:iuel hands of thofe devourers.
Jia-vuig thus tlifcviTed mir thoughts in the cleared
Banner, according to my weak underftanding, I
•next proceeded to confider the wretched nature of
-thefe deftroying favages, by feeming, though with
.great reverence, to inquire, why God fhould give
-up any of his creatures to fuch inhumanity, even to
brutality itfel-f, to devour its own kind? But as this
vr.is rather matter-of abftrufe fpeculation, and as my
tniferable fituation made me think this of mine the
nioft uncomfortable fimation an the world, I then
began rather 'to inquire what part of the world thefe
wretches lived in; how far off the<oaft was from
\vhencetheycame; why they ventured over fo far
from home; what kind of boats conveyed them hi-
ther; and why 1 could not order myfelf and roy bu-
Ariel's fo, that I might be as able to attain their coun-
try, as they were to come to my kingdom-?
But then, thought I, how (hall I manage myfelf
v?hen I come thither; what will become of me if
J fall into the hands of the favages.? or how ftiall I
from ihem, if they make an attempt upon me?

and fuppofing I fhould nor fall into their power, what
will I do for pvovifion, or which way (hall Ibend my
couife? Thefe counter thoughts threw me into the
greaieft horror and confuiion imaginable; but then
1 (till looked upon my prefent condition to be the
moft milerdble that poffibly could be, and thru no-
thing could be worfe, except death. For (thought
I) could I but attain the fhore of the main, I might
perhaps meet with fome rel.ef or coaft it along, as T
did with my boy Xury, on the African fhore, till I
came to fome inhabited country, where I might meet
with fome relief, or fall in with fome Chriftian lliip
'that.might take me in; and if I failed, why then £
could but meet with death, which would put an end
to all my miferies. Thefe thoughts, 1 muft confefs,
were the fririt of a diftempered mind, an impatient
temper made defperate, as it were, by long conti-
nuance of the troubles and the difappointments I had
1 met with in the wreck, where I hoped to have found
fome living perfon to fpeak to, by whom I might
have known in what place I was, and of the probable
means of my deliverance. Thus, while my thoughts
were agitated, my retignation to the will of Heaven
was entirely fufpended ! fo that I had no power to fix
my mind to any thing, but to the project of a voy-
age to the main land. And indeed fo much was I
i>.'!.imed upon this account, that it fet my blood into
a. ferment, and my pulfe beat high, as though I had
been in a fever, till nature being, as it were, fati-
gued and exhaufted with the very thoughts of it,
made me fubmit myfeif to a filent repofe.
In fuch a fituation it is very ftrange, that I did not
dream of what I was fo intent upon; but, inflead
of it, my mind roved on a quite different thin"
altogether foreign. I dreamed, that as I was ajuiiuj
from my caftle, one morning^ as cuftomary, I per_
ceived upon the fhore, two canoes, and eleven fava-
ges, coming to hnd, who had brought with them
another Indian, whom they deflgned to make a fa-

orifice of, in order to devour; but jnft as they were ^
oing to give the fatal blow, methought the poor
aligned victim jumped away, and ran directly into
rriy- little thick grove before my fortification, to ab-
;t'COiiic
from his enemies; when perceiving that the
others did not follow him that way, I appeared to 'a?"n:*:
him; that he humbly kneeled down before me, f], '''u
Deeming to pray for my affiftance; upon which I
Chewed him my ladder, made him afcend, carried
|iim to my cave," and be became my fervant; and
\vhen I had gotten this man, I faid to myfelf, Now
furely I may have fome hopes to attain the main- '7,*4«b 1
land, for this fellow will ferve me as a pilot, tell me ^d was
ivhat to do, and where I muft go for-provifions; /I/i:03 ar.
\vhat places to fhnn, what to venture to, and what '. if* nfoivi
to efcape. But when I awaked, and found all thefe j, fattiv
lnexpreffible impreffions of joy entirely vanifhed, I !''''ts'e thi
Il into the greateft dejection of fpirit imaginable. !3'^rJsth
Yet this dream brought me to reflect, ihat one fure
of efcaping was to get a favage; that after I
ventured my life to deliver him from the bloody
of his devourers, the natural fenfe he might
r of fuch a prefervation, might infpire him with
f, lafting gratitude and moft iincere affection. But
then this objection reafonably interpofed: How can
I effect this (thought I) without I attack a whole
paravau of them, and kill them all? why fhould I
proceed on fuch a defperate attempt, which my fcru-
pies before had fuggefted to be unlawful? and in-
deed my heart trembled at the thoughts of fo much
blood, though it were a means to procure my deli-
verance- '*» true, I might reafonably enough fup-
p0fe thefe men to be real enemies to my life; men
ivho would devour me, was it in their power, fo that
it was felf-prefervation in the higheft degree to free
fnyfe\f by attacking them in my own defence, as ,•• ^
lawfully as if they were actually afiaulting me: **•* •
though all thefe things, 1 fay, feemed to me to be of
greatest weight, yet, as I juft faid before, the
dreadful
,
dreadful thoughts of fhedding human blood, ftruck
fuch a terror to my foul, that it was a long time
before I could reconcile myfelf to it.
But how far will the ardency of defire prompt us
on! For notwithftanding the many difpuies and
perplexities I had with myfelf, I at length refolved,
right or wrong, to get one of thcfe fivages into my
hands, coft what it would, or even though I fhonld
lofe my life in the attempt. Infpired with this firnv
refolution, I fet att my wits ajt work, to find out
what methods I Ihould take to anfwer my defign:
this indeed was fo difficult a talk, that I could nor
pirch upon any probable means to execute it: I
therefore refolved continually to be m a vigil int po-
fture, to perceive when the iavages came on Ihore,
and to leave the reft to th« eveut,' kt theopportu-
nities offer as they would.
Such were my fixed refolutions; and accordingly
1 fct myfeif upon the fcout, as often as I could, nll
fuch time as 1 was heartily tired of it. I waited for
above a year and a half, the greatcft part of which
time I went out to the weft and fonth-weft corner
of the ifland, almoft every day, to look for canoes;
but none appeared. This was a very great diicou-
ragement; yet though I was very much" concerned,
the edge of my defire was as keen as ever, and .the
longer it feemed to be delayed, the moie eag. r was
I for it: in a word, I never before was fo careful to
fhun the loathing fight of thefe favages, as 1 was
now eager to be with them: and I thought myfelf
fufficiently able to manage one, two, or three lava-
ges, if 1 had them, fo as to make them my entire
flaves, to do whatsoever I fhould direct them, and
prevent their being able at any time to do me a mif-
chief. Many times did I ufe to pleafe myfelf with.
thefe thoughts, with long and ardent expectations;
but nothing prefenting, all my deep projected
fchemes, and numerous fancies vanilhed away, as.
tbouglii while I retained fuch thoughts, the decree
£3" of.
of Providence was fuch, that no favages were to
come near me.
About a year and a half after, when I was fern
oxiiiy muling of fundry other ways how I mould at-
tain my end, one morning early I was very much
iurpnled by feeing no lefs than five canoes all'on
in ore together on my fide the iflmd, and the favages
t hat belonged to them all landed, and out of my fight.
.Such a number of them difconcerted all-rr.y mcafures;
tor feeing fo many boats, each of which would con-
tain fix, and fometimes more, I could not tell what
to think of it, or how to order my m«afuies, to at-
t ick twenty or thirty men fingle handed: upon
i-.-liich, much difpirited and perplexed, I lay ftill in my
t-aflle ; which however I put in a proper pofture for
an attack;. and having formerly provided all that was
i^ectrFiry, was foon ready to enter upon an engage-
inent, fliould they aitempt it. Having waited tor
iome tune, ir,y impatient temper would let me bear
ft no longer; I fet my guns at the foot of my ladder,
;3nd, as ufual, afcended up to the top of the hill at
t vvO ftages, ftanding however in fuch a manner that
head did not appear above the hill, fo that they
'i not eafily perceive me: and here, by the af-
ice of my perfpective glafs, I obferved no lefs .
. thirty in number around a fire, feafting upon
,vhat meat they had drefled: how they cooked it,
Or what it was, I could not then perfectly tell; but
they were all dancing and capering about the flames,
i:fir)g many frightful and barbarous geftures.
J3ut while with a curious eye I was beholding thefe
v'-retches, my lpirirs funk within me, when I percei-
ved them drag two miferable creatures from the boats,
10 nct afrefh the dreadful tragedy, as I fuppofed they
l.ia<-l done before. It was not long before one of them
fill upon the ground, knocked down, as 1 fuppofe,
Vv-ith a club or wooden fword, for that was their nian-
; while two or three others went immediately to
k, cutting him open for their cookery, and then
fell
v..••
fell to devour him as they had done the former^
while the laft unhappy captive was left by himfelf till
fuch time as they were ready for him. The poor
creature looked round him with a wifhful eye, trem-
bling at the thoughts of death; yet feeing himfelf a
liulc at liberty. n.itura that very moment as it were
iafpired him with hopes of life; he ftarted away from.
them, and ran with incredible fwiftneis along the
fands, directly to that part of the coaft where my
ancient and venerable caftle flood.
You may well imagine I was dreadfully affrighted
upon this occafion, when, as I thought, they purfucd
him in a whole body, all running towards my palace.
And now indeed -I expected that part of my drc.im
was going to be fulfilled, and that he would certainly
fly to my grove for protection, but for the reft- of
my dream, 1 could depend nothing on it, that the hi*
vages would purfue him thither, and find him there.
However, my fpivits beginning to recover, I ftill fcept
Upon my guard; and I now plainly. perceived tlzcrc-—
were but three men out of the nu.wb.-r that purfued
him. I was infinitely pleafed with wh.it fwiftnefs the
poor creature ran. from his purfuers, gaining fo
much ground of them> that I plainly perceived,,
could. he thus hold it for half an hour, there was
9pt the leaft doubt hut he would fme liis life fro;u
the power of his enemies-..
Between them and my caftle there was a creek; that'
very fame which-I failed into with all my effects from.
the wreck of the fhip, on the fteep banks of which I
very much feared the poor victim would be taken, if
he could not fwlm for his efcape: but foon was I out
qf pain for him, when 1 perceived he made nothing
of it, though at full tide;. but with an intrepid cou-
rage, fpurrt-d on by the fenfe of danger, he plunged
into the flood, (wipiming over in about thirty ftrokes,
aiiJ then landing, ran with the fameincredibk ftrengtli
and fwiftnefs as before. When the three purfuers

could not fwim (happily for his part), returned back,
to his company, while the others with equal cou-
rage, but much lefs fwiftnefs, attained the other fide,
as though they were refolved never to give over their
purfuit. And now, or never, 1 thought was the time
for me to procure me a fervant, companion, or affift-
iint; and that I was decreed by Providence to be the
jnftrument that fhould lave this poor creature's life. I
immediately dtfcended my two ladders with the great-
e 1^ expedition ; 1 took up my two guns, which, aslfaid
before, were at the bottom of them ; and getting up a-
gam with the fame hafte towards the hill, I made near-
er the fea. In a word, taking a ihort cut down the hill
J interpofed between the purfuers and purfued, haloo-
ing aloud to the latter, who venturing to look back,
«vas no doubt at firft as much terrified at me^slat
them. 1 beckoned to him with my hand to return
t>ack, in the mean time advancing towards the pur-
itiers, and rufhing on the foremoft, I knocked him
^iown wJth the ftock of my piece, and laid him flat
on the ground. I was very unwilling to firs left the
i-eifi: fhould hear, though at that diflance I queftioned
xvlie'her they could or no; and being out of fight of
t]ie fmoke, ,they could not eafily have known what to
7i-iake of h. The other favage, feeing his fellow fall,
ilopped as if lie had been amazcd; when advancing
iOwards him, I could perceive him take his bow from
l! is back, «ind fixing an arrow to it, was preparing to
ihopt at me. anJ without difpute might have lodged
the arrow in my breaft; but, in this abfolutely ne-
ceiTary cafe of (elf-prc-fervation, I immediately fired
at him, and fhot him dead, juft as his hand was going
\0 draw the fatal firing. All this while the favage who
la3d fled before ftood ftill, and had the fatisfatfion to
fea his enemies killed, as he thought, who defigned
I0 takeaway his life: fo affrightf.' was he with the
and noiie of my piece, that he ftood as it were
Lot's wife, fixed and immoveable, without either
fs or motion. This obliged me to halloo to him
again.,
again, making the plaineft figns I could to him to'
draw nearer. I perceived he underftood thefe toktns
by his approaching to me a little way, when, as if
afraid I Should kill him too, he flopped again. Seve-
ral times did he advance, and as often flop in this
manner, till, coming more to my view, I perceived
him trembling, as if tie was to undergo the fame fate.
Upon which I looked upon him with a fmiling coun-
tenance, and ftill beckoning to him; at length he
came clofe to me, and kneeled down, kiffed the"
ground, laid his head upon it, and taking me by my-
foot, fet the fame upon his head: and this, as I un-
dcrftood afterwards, was a token of fwearing to be
my flave for ever. I took him up, and making much
of him, encouraged him in the beft manner I coulch
But my work was not yet finifhed; for I perceived:
the favage whom I knocked down, was not killed,
but ftunned with the blow, and began to come to-
llimfelf. Upon which I pointed to my new fervant,
and fhewing him that bis enemy was not yet expired,,
he fpoke fome words to me, but which 1 could not
underftand ; yet being the flrft found of a man's voice-
I had heard for above twenty-five years, they were
very pleafing to me. But there was no time for re--
flection now, the wounded favuge recovering himfclf
fo far as to fit upon the ground, which made my poor"
prifoner as much afraid as before ; to put him out of:
which fear, Lprefented my other gun at the man,
with an intent to /hoot him ; but my favage, for fo I'
muft now call him, prevented my firing, by making
a motion to me, to Itnd him my. (word, which hung
naked in a belt by my fide. No fooner did I grant
his requeft, but away he runs to his enemy, and at
one blow cut off his head as dexterouily as the molt
accomplifhed executioner- in Germany could have
done : for it feems thefe creatures makeufe of wooden
fwords made of hard wood, which will bear edge e-
,nough to cut off heads and arms at one blow. When
tfais valorous exploit was done, he comes to me laugh-
E 5 ine-
ing> as a token of triumph, delivered me my fword
si gain, with abundance of furpri.ing geftures, laying
lt along, with the bkeding and ghaftly head of the
jndian at my feet.
The greateft aftonifhment that my new fervant
conceived, was the manner of killing the favage at
fuch a diftance, without a bow and arrow; and fuch
ivas his longing defire to know it, that he firft point-
ed to the dead carcafe, and then made figns to me
to grant him leave to go to him. Upon which I bid
J'iiT> go, and, as well as I could, made him fenfible
i granted his requeft. But when he came there,
wonderfully was he ftruck with amazement I
-0 he turned him oii one'fide, then on another,
rdering he could perceive no quantity of blood, he
eding inwardly: and after fufHciently admiring
tI1e wound the bullet had made in his bread, he took
his bow and arrows, and ca.ne back again; upon
ich I turned to go away, making many figns to
to follow, left the reft miffing their companions^
come in purfuit of him. And this I found he
food very well, by his making me underftand
his defign was to bury them, that they might not
Teen if it happened; and which by figns again I
him fenfible I very much approved of. Imme-
*}i«*te'y ne fc^ to work, and never was grave-digger
-r^ore dexterous in the world than he was ; for in an
-n(l-ant, as I might fay, he fcraped a large hole in the
fa rids with his hands, fufHcient to bury the firft in;
he dragged him, and without any ceremony he
ed him over; in like manner he ferved the o-
, - fo that I am fure no undertaker could be more
1 xpert in his bufinefs; for all this was done in lefs
tban a qnarter of an hour. I then called him away,
Od inftead of carrying him ^reclly to my caftle at
fif-fk, I conveyed him to my cave, on the further part
f the ifhnd: and fo nay dream was not fulfilled in
that particular, that my grove fhould prove an afy-
or fanftuary to him,
'• Weary
Weary and faint, hungry and thirfty, undoubt-
edly muft this poor creature be, fupported chit fly
by that vivacity of fpirit, and uncommon tranfpoits
of joy that his deliverance occafioned. Here I gave
him bread and a bunch of raifins to eat, and water
to drink, on - which he fed very cheerfully, to his
exceeding refrefhment. I then made him a conve-
nient bed, with-a parcel of rice ftraw, and a blanket
upon it, (a'bed which I ufed myfelf fometimes), and"
then pointing. to it, made figns for him to lie down
to fleep, upon which the poor creature went to take
a welcome repofe.
Indeed he was a very. comely handfome young fel-
low, extremely well made, with ftraight long lin-ibs,
not too large, tall and well fhaped, and, as near as
I could reckon, about twenty-fix years of age. His--
countenance had nothing in it fierce or furly, but.
rather a fort of majefty in his face; and yet, efpeci-
al!y when he fmiled, he .had all the fweethefs and
foftnefs of an European* His -hair was not curled-
like wool, as many of the blacks are, but long and
black, with the mo ft- beautiful yet carelefs trefles
fpread ing. over his fhoulders. He had a -Tery high
and large forehead, with a great vivacity and fpark-

as the Virginians, Brazilians, or other Americans,
but rather of a bright dun olive colour, .that had
fomething agreeable in it, though not very eafy to
give a. defcription of. His face was roundiand plump,
with a fmall ncfe, .very different from the flutnefs of
the negroes, a pretty fmall mouth, thin.-.lips, fine
teeth, very well-fet, and white as the" driven fuow,
In- a word, fuch handfome features, and exact fvm-
metry in every pai t, made me confider, that 1 had
faved the life of an Indian prince, no lefs graceful
and accomplifhed than the great Oroonoko, whole
memorable behaviour and unhappy contingencies of
life have charmed' the worldi boih to admiration of
his perfon, and'COtrpallion to his fuffcnngs.
E 6 But:
But let him be either prince or peafant, all my
Jaappinefs centered in this, that I had now got a good
fervant or companion, to whom, as he deferved, I
•«vas refolved to prove .a kind mafter and lafting
friend. He had not, I think, flept above an hour,
•When he awakened again, and while I was milking
xny goats hard by, out he runs from the cave to-
%vards me in my inclofuie, and laying himfelf down
on the ground in the loweft proftration, made all the
antic geftures imaginable, to exprefsbis thankfulnefs
to aie for being his deliverer. I confefs, though the
inanner of his behaviour, feemed to be ludicrous e-
iiough to occafion laughter, yet I was very much
rnoved at his affection, fo that my heart melted with-
jn me, fearing he might die away in excefs of joy,
3ike reprieved malefactors; efpecially as I was inca-
pable either to let him blood, or adminifter phific.
it were to be wifhed, that Chriftains would take ex-
iirnple by this Heathen, to have a lafting reinem-
ftrance of the benefits and deliverances they have re-
ceived', by the kind mediation and powerful interpo-
jition of their benefactors and deliverers: and it
ivould likewife be happy for mankind were there no
£>ccafion to blame many, who inftead of thankfully
Acknowledging favours and benefits, rather abufe
aod contemn thofe who have been the inftruments
to fave them from deftruction.
But leaving thefe juft reflections, I return to the
Abject that occafioned them: for my man, to con-
cIude the laft ceremony of obedience, laid down his
jiead again on the ground, clofe to my foot, and fet
^iiy other foot upon his head, as he had done
jyefore, making all the figns of fubjection, fervitude,
aOd fubmilBon imaginable, to let me underftand he
^ould ferve me as long as his life endured. As I
.itnderftood him in many things, I made him fenfible
i vras-very well pleafed with him; and in a little time
J began to fpeak to him, and learn him how to talk
,0 me again. la the firft place, 1 ma^ehim under-
ft and his name was to be Friday, becaufe it was upon
that day I faved his life: then I taught him to fay
IVlafter, which I made him fenfible was to be my
name. I likewife taught him to fay Yes and No,
and to know what they meant. I gave him fome
milk in-an earthen pot, making him view me while
I drank it before him, and foaked my bread in it; I
gave him a cake of bread, and caufed him foak it
likewife, to which he readily copfented, making
ligns of the greateft fatisfaction imaginable.
All that night did 1 keep him there; but no fooner
did the morning light appear, when I ordered him to
arife, and come along with me, with certain tokens
that I would give him fome cloaths like mine, at
which he feemed very glad, being (lark naked, with-
out the leaft covering whatever. As we pafled by
the place where the two men had been interred,' my
man pointed directly to their graves, fhewing me the
marks that he had made to find them again, giving
me to underftand by figns, that we fhould dig them
up, and devour them. At this I appeared extremely
dil'pleafed, exprtfled my utmoft abhorrence as-if I
would vomit at the apprehenfions of it, beckoning
with my hand to come away, which he did w ith the
greateft reverence and fubmiffion. After this I con-
ducted hhn to the top of the hill, to view if the reft
of the favages were yet remaining there; but when
I looked through my perfpective glafs, 1 could fee
no appearance of them, nor of their canoes; fb that
it was very evident they never minded their deceafed
corrpanions whom we had flain ; which if they had,
they would furely have fearched for, or left one
boat behind for them to follow, after they returned
from their purfuit.
Curiofity and a defire of fatisfaclion animating me
with courage to fee this fcene of barbarity, 1 took my
man Friday with me, putting a fword into his hand,
with the bow and arrows at his back, which I per-
ceived he could ufe very dexteroufly, cauiing him to
. carry
cany one gun for me, and I two for myfelf; and1
thus equipped againft all aitacks, away we marched
directly to the place of their bloody entertainment.
But when I came there, I was ftruck with the utmoft
horror at fo dreadful a fpcctacle, whilft Friday was
no way concerned about it, b:ing no doubt in his
turn one of thefe d-.-vourers. Here lay feveral hu-
man bones, there feveral pieces of mangled flefh,
tia.lt eaten, mangled and fcorched, whillt ftreams of
blood ran promi'cuoufly as waters from a fountain.
.As I was mufing on this dreadful fight, Friday took
all the pains he could by particular figns to make
rr>e underfhnd, that they had brought over four
prifoners to feaft upon, three of whom they had
eaten up, and that he was the" fourth, pointing to
Jiimfelf: that there having been a bloody battle be-
tween them and his great king, in the juft defence
of whom he was taken prifoner, with many oihers;
all of thefe were carried pffto different places, to be
tJevoured by their conquerors; and that it was his
iriisfortune to be brought hither by thefe wretches
for the fame purpofe.
After I was made fenfible of thefe things, I caufed
JTi-iday to gather thofe horrid remains, and lay them
together upon a heap, which-1 ordered to be fet. on
fire, and burnt them to afhes: rr-y man how.ever ffiil
retained the nature of a cannibal, having a hanker-
ing ftomach after fome of the flefh: but fuch an
f%treme abhorrence did I exprefs at the leaft appear-
ance of it, that he durft not but conceal it : for I
iiiade him very fenfible, that if he offered any fuch
thing, I would certainly fhoot him.
This being done, I carried my man with me to my
caftle.. and gave him a pair of linen drawers, which
i had taken out of the poor gunner's-their. before ''"'MO
yncmioned; and which, with a little alteration, fitted *jbe(
fit en very well: in the next place, I made him a jer<-
lcin of go^t fkin, fuch as my Ikill was able to ma-
fiage> and indeed I thought myfdf then a tolerable
good
good tailor. I gave him alfo a cap, which I made
of a hare's Ikin, very convenient an-1 fafhionable.
Thus being cioathed tolerably well, my man was no
Isfs proud of his habit, than I was in feeing him in
it. Indeed he went very awkwardly at firft, the
drawers being too heavy on his thighs, not ufed to
bear any weight, and the fleeves of the waiftcoat
galled his fhoulders, and the infide of his arms; but
by a little eafing where he complained they hurt
him, and by ufing himfelf to them, at length he
took to them very well.
My next concern was, where I fhoukl lodge him:
and that I might do well by him, and yet be perfect -
ly eafy myfelf, I erected a tent for him in the vacant
place between my two fortifications, in the infide of
the laft, and the oiufide of the firft : and as there was
an entrance or door into my cave, I made a formal
framed door-cafe, and a door to open on the infide;
I barred it up in the night time, taking in my lad-
ders tool-fo that was my man to prove treacherous,
there could be no way to come at me in the imide of
my innermoft wall, without making fo- much noife
in getting over, that it muft needs waken me; for
my firlt wall had now a complete roof over it of
long poles, fpreading over my tent, and leaning up
to the fide of the mountain, which was again laid
crofs with fmaller flicks inftead of laths, and thatch-
ed over a great thickntfs with the rice ftrtfw, which
was as ftrong as reeds; and at the hole of the place,
left, on purpofe to go in or out by the ladder, 1 had
placed a kind of a trap door, which, if it had been
attempted on the outfidc, would not have opened at
all, but have fallen down, and made a great uoife ^
and as to my weapons, every night I took them all
to my bed lide.
But there was no occafion for this precaution ; for
furely never naafter had a more.fincere, faithful, and
loving icrvant than Friday proved to me. Without
paffion, fullennefs, or defign, perfectly obliging and
engaging,
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
engaging, his affections were as much tied to me, as
thof'e of a child to his parents; and I might venture
to fay, he would have facrificed his life for the faving
mine, upon any occa'fion whatfoever. And indeed
the many teftimonies he gave me of this, fufficiently
convinced me that I had no occafion to ufe thefe pre-
cautions. And here I could not but reflect, with
great wonder, that however it has pleafed the Almigh-
ty; in his providence, and in the government of the
creation, to take from fo great a part of the world of
his creatures, the nobleft ufes to which their facul-
ties, arid the powers of their fouls are adapted; yet
that he has beftowed upon them the fame reafon, af-
fections, fentiments of kindnefs, and obligation, paf-
•fions of refentment, fincerity, fidelity, and all the
capacities of doing and receiving good that he has
given us; and that when he is gracioufly pleafed to
offer them occafions of exerung thefe, they are as
ready, nay, more ready, to apply them to the proper
•ufes for which they were befto'wed, than we often
are. Thefe thoughts would make me melancholy,
efpecially when 1 confidered how mean a ufe we
(nake of all thefe, even though we have thefe powers
enlightened by the Holy Spirit of God, and by the
Jcnowledge of his word, as an addition to our under'
Standing ; and why it has pleafed.the heavenly wifdom
to conceal the like faving knowledge from fo many
tnillions of fouls, who would certainly make a much
Better ufe of it than generally mankind do at this
time. Thefe reflections would fometimes lead me
fo far, as to invade the fovereignty of providence, and
as it were, arraign the juftice of fuch an arbitrary
^ifpofition ffi .things, that fhould obfeure that light
ftcm fome, and reveal it to others, and yet expect a
like duty f rom all. But I clofed it up, checking my
thoughts with this- conclufion; Jirit, That we were
lgnorant of that right and law by which thefe fhould
\)C condemned; but that as the Almighty was necef-
, and by the nature of his efience, infinitely juft
and
and holy; fo it could not be otherwife, but that if
thefe creatures were all deftined to abfence from
himfelf, it was on account of finning againft that
light, which, as the fcripture fays, was a law to
thcmfelves, and by Cuch iules as their confidences
would acknowledge to bejuft, though the firft foun-
datiou was not difcovered to us. And, fecondly,
That ftill as we were the clay in the hand of the
potter, no veffel could thus fay to him, Why haft
thou fafhioned me after this manner.
I had not been above two or three days returned to
my caftle, but my chief delign was, how I fhould
bring Friday off from his horrid way of feeding; and
to take from him that inhuman relifh he by nature
had been accuftomed to, 1 thought ic my duty to let
him tafte other flefh, which might the rather tempt
him to the fame abhorrence 1 lo often expreffed a-
gainft their accurfed way of living. Upon which one
morning I took him out with me, wHi an intention
to kill a kid out of the flock, and bring it home, aad
drefs it As I was going, I perceived a fhe-goat ly-
ing down in the fhade, and two-young kids ti ring
by her. Immediately I catched hold of my man Fri-
day, and bidding him ftand ftill and not ftir. 1 pre-
fented rny piece, ;md fhot one'of the kids. My poor
fervant, who had at a diftance perceived me killhis;
adverfary, and yet did nut know by what means, or
how it was done, ftood trembling and furprifed, and
looked fo amazed, that I thought he would have funk
into the earth. He did not fee the kid I aimed at, or
behold I had killed it, but ripped up his waiftcoat to
fee if he was net wounded, thinking my rtfoluiiorl
was to kill him; for coming to me, he fell on his
knees, earneftly pronouncing many things which I
did not unclerftand the meaning of; which at length
I-perceived was, that i would not take away his life.
Indeed I was much concerned to fee him in that
condition, where nature is upon the ftrvereft trial,
v\t'-r. the imnaediate hand of death is ready to put for
ever
A
ever a period this mortal life: and indeed fo much
compaffion had I to this creatm:e, that it was with
difficulty 1 refrained from tears But. however, as
another fort of countenance was neceffliry, and to
convince him that I would do him no harm, I took
J*im f'miling, by the hand, then laughed at him, and
pointing to the kid which I had flain, made iigns to
Jiim to fetch it, which accordingly he did. Is'o iefs
curious was he in viewing how the creature was kill-
ed, than he had been before in beholding the Indian;
which while he was admiring at, 1 charged my gun
again, and prefently perceived a great fowl like a
liawk, peiching upon a tree within light; and there-
fore to let. Friday underftand what 1 was going to do,
I called hi.n to me again, pointing at the fowl, which
I found to be a parrot. I made him underftand that
I would fhoot and kill that bird; accordingly 1 fired,
and b.id him look, when immediately he faw the
parrot fall down. Again he ftood like one amazed,
riO:vvithftanding all 1 had faid to him ; and the more
confounded he was, becaufe he did not perceive me
put anything into my gun. Undoubtedly a thing
fo utterly Orange, carrying death along with it, for
or near, either to man or beaft, muft certainly create
tlie greater aftonifhment to one who never had heard
fuch a uiing in his whole life: and really his a-
nt continued fo long, that had I allowed it,
would have proft rated himfelf before me and my
eun, with the greateft worfliip and adoration. As
for the gun in particular, he would not fo much at-
^iifter his fingers to touch it for feveral days. after;
t>ut would come and communicate his thoughts to
lt, and talk to it, as if the fenfek'fs piece had under-*
flood and anfwered him: all this I could perceive
l,im do, when he thought my. back w.is turned, the
intent of which, was, to defire it not to kill
of
as I afterwards came to underftand.
I never ftrove to prevent his admiration, nor hin-
him from thofe comical geftures he ufed on fuch
"
eecafions; but when his afionifLmetu was^a little o-
ver, I mule tokens to him to run and fetch the par-
rot that I had (hot ; .which he accordingly did, flay-
ing fome time longer than iifual, by reafon the bird,
not being quite dead, had fluttered fome vvay farther
from the place where fhe,fell. In the mean time, as
he was looking for her, i took the advantage of char-
ging my gun again, tharfoi might b.evready for any
other mark ihat offered ; but nothing more occurred
at that time. So 1 brought home the kid, and the
fame evening took-off the fkin, and divided the car*
cafe as well as 1 could P.irt of this fiefh I ftew.ed
and boiled, in a pot 1 had for this purpofe. And
then fpreading my table, I fat down, giving my man
fome of it to eat, who was wonderfully ple.afefj, and
feemed to like it very well; but what was moft fur-
priling to him was to fee me eat fait with it: upon
which he made me to underftand, that the fait was ve-
ry bad for me ; when putting a little into his mouth,
he feemed to naufeate it in luch a manner, as to fpit
and fputter at it, and then wafhed his mouth with
frefh water: but to fhew him how contrary his opU
nion was to mine, 1 put fome meat into my mouth
without fait, and feigned to fpit and fputter as much
for the want of it, as he had done at it: yet all this
proved of no fignificaticn to Friday; and it was a
long while before he could endure fait in his meat or
broth, and even then but a very fmall quantity.
Thus having fed him fufficiently with boiled meat
and broth at that time, the next day 1 was -refolved)
to feaft him with a roafted piece of the kid. And
having no fpit to faften it, nor jack-to turn it, I madp
ufe of that common artifice which many of the people
of JLngland have, that is, to fet two poles upon each.
Cde of the fire, and one crofs on the top, hanging the
meat thereon with a firing, and fo turning round con-
tinu.illy., roaft it in the fame manner as we read
bloody tyrants of old cruelly roafted the holy mar-
tyrs. This practice cauild great admiration in my

man Friday, being quite another way than that W
which the favages were accuftomed. But when he
came to tafte the fweetnefs and tendernefs of the
flefh, he exprefled his entire fatisfaftion above a
thoufand different ways. And as 1 could not but
underftand his meaning, you may be Cure I was as
wonderfully pleafed, especially when he made it al-
fo very plain to me, that he would never, while he
lived, eat man's flefh more.
It is now high time I fhould fet my fcrvant to
work; fo next day 1 put him to beat out feme com,
and fift it in the fame manner as I had done before.
And really the fellow was very quick and handy in
the excution of any thing I ordered him to go about,
I made him under/land that it was to make bread
for us to eat, and afterwards let him fee me bake it.
Jn fhort, he did every thing as I ordered him in a
little time as well as I could perform it myfelf.
But now confidering that I had two mouths to
feed inftea"d of one. it was neceffaiy that I muft pio-
vide more ground for my harveft and plant a larger
quantity of corn than I commonly ufcd to do -, upon
which I marked out a larger piece of land, fencing
it in, in the fame manner as I had done before; in
the execution of which I muft give Friday this good
word, that no man could work more hardy, or with
-better will than he did: and when I made him fen-
fible that it was for bread to ferve him as well as me,
lie rhen very paffionately made me underftand, that
tie thought I had much more labour on his account,
than I had for myfelf; and that no pains or dili-
gence fhould be wanting in him, if I would but di-
irect him in thofe works wherein he might proceed.
i muft certainly own, that this was the moft plea-
/ant year I ever had iri the ifland; for. after fome time
Friday began to talk pretty well, and underfhnd the
names of thofe things which 1 was wont to call for,
and the places where I ufed to fend him. So that my
1ong filent tongue, which had been ufelefs fo many
years,
•"•Steles
years, except in an exclamatory manner, either for
deliverance or bleffings, now began to be occupied in
teaching, and talking to my man Friday; for indeed
I had fuch a (ingular fatisfadtion in the fellow him-
felf, fo innocent did his fimple and unfeigned honefty
appear more and more to me every day, that I really
began entirely to love him; and for his part, I be-
lieve there was no love loft, and that his nature had
been more charmed with my exceeding kindnefs, and
his affections more placed upon me, than any other
object whatfoever among his own countrymen. I
once had a great mind to try if he had any hankering
inclination to go to his own country again: and by this
time having learned him Englifh fo well, that he could
give me tolerable anfwers to any qucftion which I
demanded, I a£ked him, whether that n.ition to which
be belonged, ever conquered in battle ? This queftion
made Friday tofmile, and to which he anfwered, Yes,
yes, -weal-waysfight the better; as much as to fay, they
always got the better in fight. Upon which we pro-
ceeded on the following difcourfe. You fay, faid I
that you always fight the better; why then, Friday,
how came you to be taken prifoner?
Friday. But for all that, my nation beat much..
Mailer. How, fay you, beat! if your nation beat
them, how came you to be taken?
Friday. They more many mans than my nation in
the place where me was, they take one; two three,
and me; my nation much overheat them in the yon-
der place where me no was, there my nation mans
teat one, two, three great toufand.
Mailer. Then why did not your men recover you
from the hands of your enemies?
Friday. \ hey run one, two, or three, and me;
they make all go in the canoo; my nation have no
canoo that time.
Mailer. 'fis very well, Friday; but what does
your nation do with the priioners they take? L'o they
carry them away and eat them as thefe have done?
Friday.
Friday. Yes, yes, my nation eat mans too, eat up
all.
Miifltr. To what place do they carry them to be
devoured.
Friday. Go to other nations where they think.
Ma/ler. Do they bring them hither?
Fii&iy. Yes, come over hither, come over other
place.
MtiJ}er. And have you been with them here, Fri-
day?
Friday Yes, me been here, (pointing to the rorth-
weft of the iiland, being the fide -when they ufed tt
land.)
Thus having got what account I could from my
than, I plainly underftood, that he had been as bad
as any of the reft of the cannibals, having been for-
merly among the favages who ufed to come on fhore
on the fartheft part of the ifland, upon the fame
bloody occaiions as he was brought hither for: and
fome time after I carried him to that place where he
pointed; and no fooner did he come there, but he
prefsntly knew the ground, fignifyiirl to me that he
was once there when they ate up twenty men, two
women, an J a young child ; but as he could not ex-
plain the number in Englifb, he did it 'by fo m^ny
ftones in a row, making a iign to me to count them.
This pafTkge I have the rather mentioned, becaufe •
it led to things more important and uleful for me to
know: for after 1 had this iutisfactory difcourfewith
him, my next queition was, how far it was from the
illand to the fhore, and whether the canoes were not
often loft in the ocean ? to which he anfwered, there
was no danger; that no canoes were ever loft; but
that after a little way out to the fea, there was a
frron(jj;current, and a wind always one way in the af-
ternoon. This I thought at firft to be no more than
the fets of the tide, going out or coming'in; but
I afterwards underftood it was occafioned by the great
draught and reflux of the mighty river Oroonoko,
in
s?a
in the mouth or gulf of which I imagintd my king-
dom lay ; and that the land which I perceived to the
W. and N. W. mull be the great ifland Trinidad, on
the north of the river. A thoufand queftions (if that
would fatisfy me) did I afk Friday about the nature
of the country, the fea, the coafts, the inhabitants,
and what nations were neareft them; to which que-
ftions the poor fellow declared all he knew, with the
greateft opennefs and utmoft fincerity. When I de-
manded of him the particular names of the various
nations of his fort of people, he could only anfwer
me in general, that they were called Carabe, Hence
it was 1 confidered that thefe muft be the Caribbees,
fo much taken notice of by our maps, to be on that
part of America, which reaches from the mouth of
the river Oroonoko to Guiana, and fo on to St. Mar-
tha. Then Friday proceeded to tell me, that up a
great way beyond the moon, as much as to lay be-
yond the fetting of the moon, which muft be welt
from their country, there dwelt white-bearded men,
fuch as I was, pointing to my whifkers, and that they
kill much mans. I was not ignorant with what bar-
barity the Spaniards treated thefe creatures; fo that
I pretently concluded it muft be them, whofe cruel-
ties had fpread throughout America, to be remem-
bered even to fucceeding generations.
Well, you may be fure, this knowledge which the
imperfect information of my man had led me to, was
very comfortable to me, and made me fo curious as
to afk him, how 1 might depart from this ifl.ind, and
get among thofe white men? He told me, Yes, ye s, I
might go in uuo canoes. In two canoes, thought I,
what dots my man mean? Surely he means one for
himfelf, and another for me; and if not, how muft
two canoes hold me without being joined, or one
part of my body being put in one, and another in the
other? And indeed it was a long while before I un-
dcrflood his meaning, which was, that it tr.uft be a
large boat, as big as two canoes, able to bear with
the
the waves,, and not'fo liable to be overwhelmed as
a fmall one muft be.
I believe there is no ftate of life but what may be
happy, if people would but endeavour for their part
to make it Ib. He is not the happieil man that has
the moft riches, but he that is content with what he
hath. Before I had my fervant, I thought myfelf mi-
ferable till I had him; and now that 1 enjoyed the
happy benefits of him, 1 ftlll complained, and begged
a deliverance from a place of retirement, eafe, and
plenty, where Providence had fufficiemly blefied me.
In a word, from this time I entertained fome hopes,
that one time or other I might find an opportunity
to make my efcape from this ifland,,and that this
poor favage might be a great furtherance thereto.
All the iime fince my man became fo intelligent as
to underrtand and (peak to me, I fpared no pains nor
diligence to inftruct him, according to my poor/hare
of knowledge, in the principles of religion, and the
adoration that he ought to pay to the True God. One
time, as I very well remember, 1 aiked him who made
him? At firft the innocent creature did not under-
ftand what I meant, but rather thought I aiked him
who was his father? Upon which I took another way
to make him fenflble, by demanding from him an an-
fwer to this queftion. Friday, faid I, who is it that
rnade the fea, this ground whereon we walk, and all
thefe hills and woods which we behold? And hene
indeed I did not mifs of my intention; for he told
me it was old Benamuckee (the god whom I fuppofed
the favages adored) who lived a great way beyond
all. But as for his attributes, poor Friday was an
tatter ftranger. He could defcribe nothing of this
great perfon; and all that he could fay was, that he
ivas very-old, much older than the fea and land, the
trioon, or the ftars. Friday, (faid I again), if this
great and old perfon has made all things in the world,
liow comes it to pafs, that all things, as you in par-
ticular, do qot adore and worfhip him? Upon this
looking
OK BOBLNSON CRt730E..
looking very grave, with 3 'perfect fweet look of in-
nocence, he replied, Mafter, ail things iay 0-to kiin,
by which it may reafonabdy be fuppoied he .mean*
iu'or.uiun. And where, faid I, do the people of
your country go when they.die? He anfwored, they
all go to Be&amuckee. What, and thdfe people tha(
are eaten up, do they go there ? iBenaHiuckee, faid he,
love 'em dearly r, me pray '-to Benamuckcc, In de canoe, ami
Benamiickee -wou'd live mt -when deyeat a me all up.
Such difconrfes as thefe had I with my man, and
fuch made roe. fenfible, th^rthe true God is woifhip-
ped, though. under imperfafl fimilitudes; and that
the falfe adoration which the Heathens give to their
imaginary deity, is as great an argument of the divine
eflence, as the moft learned Atheifts (falfly fo called)
can bring a^ainft «: for God will be glorified in his
works, let the denomination be what it will; and I
cannot be of that opinion which fome conceive, that'
God fhould decree men to be damned for want of a
right. notion of fiiih, in a place where the wifdotn
of the Almighty has not permitted it to be preached;
and therefore cannot but'conclude, that fince'obe'di-
ence is the beft facrifice, thefe poor creatures, acting
by that light and knowledge which they arc poflefled
with, may undoubtedly obtain a happy falvation,
though not that enjoyment with Chrift as his faints,
confeflbrs, and martyrs muft enjoy. i ' .!" '. )<• i
But laying thefe determinations afide, more fit for
divines than me to difcufs, I began to inttru<!t my
fcrvant in the faving knowledge of the true Deity, in
which the directions of God's Holy Spirit affifted me.
I lifted up my hands to heaven, and pointing thereto,
told him, that the great Maker of heaven and earth
Jived there: that as his infinite power fafhioaad this
w.orld out of a confufed chaos, and made it ifi that -
^beautiful frame which we behoW( fo he governs and
preferves it by his unbounded knowledge, fovereign
greatneis, and peculiar providence: that he was omni-
potent, could do every thing for'us, give-evqry thing
F to
-to us, and take every thing away from us: that he
v/as a rswarder and punither of good and evil aftions:
--that there. was nothing but what he knew, no thoughts
fo fecret but what he could bring to light; .and thus.
'by degrees I opened his eyes, and defcribed to him
the manner of the creation of'the world, the fituation.
.oi?..paradire, the tranfgreffion of our firft parents, the
•\*-ickedoefs of God's peculiar-people,. and the univer-
f-il-fins and abominations of the whole earth. When
the/'e things were implanted in his mind, I told him,
that as God's jufi ice was equal to his mercy, here-
Jblved to deftroy this world, till his Son Jefiis Chrift
lnterpofed in our behalf, and to procure our redemp-
-i ion, obtained leave of his heavenly father to come
down from heaven into the :world, where he took
Jiuman naiure upon him, inftructed us in our way to
ecernal life, and died as a Sacrifice for our fins : that
fie was now attended into heaven, mediating for our
pardon, delivering our petitions, and obtaining all
rttofe good benefits which we alk in his name, by
Jvumble and hearty prayers, all which were heard at
the throne of heaven. As very frequently I nfed to
inculcate things into his mind, Friday one day told
i-ue, that if our great God could hear us beyond the
^'yn, he rauft furely be a greater God than their Be-
fiamnckee, who lived but a little way off, and yet could
i,ot hear them till they afcended the greatmountains
w-herc he dwelt, to fpeak to him. What, faid 1, Fri-
?, did you go thither to fpeak to him too .' He an-
;d, no, they never went that were young men,'
but old men called their Oo-wakakee, meaning
tl,e Indian priefts, who went to fay 0, (fo he called
yaying their prayers), and they returned back, and -
told 'hem. rwhac Benamuchee faid. From hence I
c<?uld aot bu? abferve how happy we Chriftians are,
ivlio have God's immediate revelation for our cer- t
"rain guide; and that our faith is neither milled, nor
Our reafon iinpofed upon, by any fet of men, fuch.
as thefe Indian iinpoftors,' - . - : -
But
*•*,
But to clear up this palpable cheat to my man Fri-
tl ij, I told him, that the pretence of their ancient
men going up to the mountain to fay O to their god
Benamuikee was an impofture, -and that their bring-
ing back an anfwer was all a fham, if not worfe ; for
that if there was any fuch thing fpoken to them,
furely it muft proceed from an infernal fpirtt. An.d
here I thought it neceflary to enter into a long dif-
courfe with him, which I did after this manner.
Friday, (faid I), yon muft know that before this
world was made, there was an almighty power exift-
ing, by whofe power all things were made,. and whofe
majefty fhallhave no end. To be glorified and ado-
red by beings of a heavenly nature, he created angels
and arch-angels, that is, glorious fpirits refembling
himfelf, to encompafs his throne, eternally fingiug
forth his praife in the moft heavenly founds and di-
vine harmony. And among this heavenly choir Lu-
cifer bore a great fway, as bting then one of the pe-
culiar favourites of theie celeflial abodes; but he,
contrary to that duty he owed his heavenly fovereign,
with unbounded ingratutide to his divine Creator,
not only envied him that adoration which was-his
due, but thought to ufiirp that throne which he had
neither power to keep, nor title to pietcnd to> He
railed a diflenlion and civil war in heaven, and had
a number of angels to take his part. Unbounded fol-
ly! ftupendous pride! thus to hope for victory, and
afpire above his powerful Creator! The Deity, not
fearful of (uch an enemy, yet juftly provoked at this
rebellion, commiffions his archangel Michael to lead
forth the heavenly hoft, and give him battle; the
advantage of which was quickty perceived, by Satan's
being overthrown, and the prince of the air (for fo
the devil was calltd) with all his fallen angels, driven
headlong into a di:mal place, which is c^4led Hell.
The recital of ihis truth made my man give the
greateft attention, and he expreffed a great farisfac-
tion by his gellurcs, that God had fent the devil into
F a the
i4ie deep hole And ih'en I'defired him to give great
lieed to what I had further to- fay.
No (boner (proceeded 1) was God freed from, and
t-Iie heavens clear of this archtraitor, but the Father
fpcaks to the Son and Holy Spirit, who belonged to
Ji is elfence, and were equal to him in power and glory
dome let vs make man, (laid he) in our, own image, after
.our own likens fs, Gen. i. 26. to have dominion over
tlie creatures of the world which we have created.
^Lnd thefe he intended fliould. glorify him in heaven,
^recording to their obedience in this ftate of probation
on earth, which was, as it were, to be the fchool. to
train them up for thofe heavenly manfions. Now,
*>;itan feeing himfelf foiled, yet that God had notw-
leen the power from him as prince of the air, which
power Heaven defigned he fhould retain, whereblt
l-iis creatures might be tried; in revenge for the dif-
gi-ace he had received, he tempts Adam's wife Eve
t-o tafte of the tree of knowledge of good and evil,
ch God had forbidden. He appears to her in the
e °f a feqient, then a moft beautiful creature,
tells her, tliat it was no better than an impofi^
iion which God had put upon her and her hufband,
fiot to eat of that fair frnit which he had created;
t]-i.at the tafte thereof would make them immortal like
fyod himieif; and confequently as great and power-
ful as he. Upon which fhe hot only ate thereof her-
fzlf, but made her hufband eat alfo, which brought
t?1em both under the heavenly difpleafure,
Here Friday expreffed a great concern • Ab, pear
f)i fins'- (cried he), naughty -womans! naughty devil!
Cod n.t love de mans, make mans hke devil him-
, faid i, God ftill loved mankind; and tho'
ti%e devil tempted human nature fo far, he would not
^-uffer him to have an abfolnte power over them. I
l%ave told you before of his tender love to his people
till they, like Lucifer, difobeyed his commands, and
t>elled againft him; and even then, how JefusChrift
re
his
ibis only Son came to fave Sinners. But ftill every
man that lives in the world is under temptation anrf
•trial. The devil has yet a power, as prince of the
•air, to fuggeft evil cogitations into our minds, and
prompt us on to wicked actions, that he might glory
in our deftru&ion. Whatever evil thoughts we have
proceed from him : fo that God, in this our diftrefs,
expe&s we fhould apply purfelves to him by fervent
prayer for fpeedy redrefs. -He is not like Benimic-
-ket, to let none come near him but Goviakilu'e, btft
/ufi'ers the people as well as priefts to offer thein-
ftlves at his- feet, thereby to be delivered from the
power and temptation of the devil.
'But though at firft my man Friday expreffed fome
concern at the wickedoefe of Lucifer, I found it not
-fo eafy to imprint die right notions of him in his
mind, as it was about the divine eflence of God: for
•there nature affi-fted me in all my arguments, to fhew
.to him plainly the neceffity of a great firft caufe, and'
over-ruling governing power, of a fecret directing
^Providence, and. of the eqpity and re.ifonablenefs of
-paying adoration.to-out Creator; whereas there ap--
pcared nothing of all this in the notion of an evil
ipirit, of his firft beginning, his nature, and above
all, of his- inclination to evil afiions, and his power
to tempt us to the like. And indeed this unlearned
Indian, by the mere force of nature, puzzled me with
-ene particular queftion, more than ever I could have
expected.
I had, it feems., one day been talking to him of
the omnipotent power of God, and his infinite ab-
horrence of fin, infomuch that the fcriptures ftyled
him a confitmir.g firt to all the workers of iniquity ;.
and that it was in his power, whenever he pleafed,
to deftroy all the world in a moment, the greater
part of which are continually offending him.
When, with a ferious attention, he had liftened a
great while to what I fald, after I had been telling
him how the devil vas God's enemy in the hearts of
'F 3 . „. men,,
men, and ufed all his malice and fldll to defeat tht
good defines of providence, and deftroy the kingdom
of Chrift in the world, and fo forth: Very well> ma-
iler, (faid Friday) you fay God is fo ftrong, fo great,
is he not much ftrong, much mightier than the
rt nighty devil? To be fure, Friday, faid I, God is
-rnore wife, and ftronger than the ferpent: he is above
the devil, which makes us pray to him, that he would
tread down S.itan under our feet, enable us to refift
flis violent temptations, and quench his fiery darts.
jVhy then, aniVered Friday quickly, if Gad as you fay,
fr'is much ftrong, much might as the devil, why God M
&itl devil. mcke no mire tempt, no mare do -wickel?
You may be certain I was ftrangely furprifed at
this queftion of my man's; and though an old man,
J was but a young doctor, and confcquently very ill
qualified foracafuift, or a refolver of intricate doubts
in religion. And as it required fotne time for me to
ftudy for an anfwer, 1 pretended not to hear him,
- tior to afk him what he laid: but fo eaineft was he
fof an aul'wer, as not to forget his queftion, which he
repcated in the very fame broken words as above.
"VVhen I had recovered myfelf a little, Friday, laid \,

obtain pardon. At thefe words, obtain pardon,
friday mufed a great while - and at laft. looking me

And now I' found it neceflary to put an end to this
difcourfe between my man and me; for which pur-
pofe I rofe up haftily, and made as if 1 had fome oc-
cafion to go out, leading Friday for fomething that
was a good* way offi. I then fell on my knees, and
-befeeched God that hei would infpire me fo far as to
guide tliis poor favage in the knowledge of Chrift, to
anfwer his queftions more clearly, that his confcience
'might be convinced, his- eyes opened, and his foul
faved. When he-returned again, 1 entered into a
very long difceurfe with him, upon the fubjucT: of the
world's redemption by the Saviour of it, and the
doctrine of repentance-preached from heaven, toge-
ther with. an holy faith, in ourblefled Redeemer Jelus
Chrift: and then 1 proceeded to explain to him, .ac-
cording to my weak. capacity, the reafon why our Sa-
viour took not on. him the nature of angels, but ra-
ther the feed -of Abraham ; and how the fallen angels
had no benefit by that redemption; and, laftly, that:
he came only to the loft fheep of tjtie houfe of Ifrael,
and the like. God knows I had more fincerity than
knowledge in all the ways I took for- this poor /«-
dian's inftrudYion ; and I muft acknowledge, what I
believe every body that acts upon the fame principle
l find, that in laying heavenly truths open before.

refted otfrfelvts contenr, that God would accept our
dciiivs, and .accordin|«..to our faith have mercy on.us.
But wharwe wanted one way was made up in a-
nother. and that was uniirerfal peace in our little

You -may- well foppofe, that, by the frequent dif-
eour&s we had together^ .my man and I became mof
t
intimately acquainted, and that 'there was but very
little that I could faji b^t what Friday undei flood ',
and indeed he fpoke Very fluentiy, though ic was but

him underftand that wonderful myftery, as he con-
ceived, of gun powder and bullet, and taught him
Jiow to fhoot. 1 alfo prefented to him a knite, which
pleafed him exceedingly, making him a belt, with a
trog hanging thereto, like thofe in which we wear
hangers in England; and infttad of a hanger to put
in the frog, I gave him a hatchet, which was not only
a good, but even a better weapon upon many occafi-
ons. la a word, my mait thus accoutred, looked
•upon himfelf as great as Don Quixote when that ce-
lebrated champion went to combat the windmill.
I next gave him a very particular defcription of
the territories of p.urcpe, and ina particular manner
of Old England, the place of my nativity. I laid be-
fore him the manner of our worfhipping God, our
behaviour one to another, and how we trade in (hips
•to every part of the uni-verfe. 1 then told him my
iniisfortunes in being fhipwrecked, fhowing him as
near as I could the place. where the fhip lay, which
Jiad been gone long before: but I brought him to the
yuins of my boat, which before my whole ftrength
could not move, but now was almoft rotten, and
fallen to pieces. I obferved my man Friday to view
'is boat with an uncommon cnrioiity; which when
had done, he flood pondering a great while, and
d nothing. At laft, faid I, Friday, what makes

It was Tome time indeed before I cnderftood what

plainly found, that fuch another boat refembling mine

fibk that'liis'concern was about the boat's being
fimH togo fo long a voyage. Upon which 1 let
underftand I had a much bigger; and according-

lay, which I had made, when all the ftreggtiv 1 bad,
or art I cbuld ufe, failed me -in my attempt to gerit
into the water; but now it toaving lain in the fan

man told me, that fuch a boat would .do very well to

told him, that we would both go and make a boat
full as big, and more proportionable than that,
wherein he might fafely return to his own nation-.
Thefe words made Friday look fo very penlive,
that I thought he would have fallen at my feet. %It
was fometime before he could (peak a word, • which
made me afk him what was the matter with him?
He replied in a very foft and moving tone, Il'hat hit'

do great deal much good, you teach all de wild mans to be
gold tame mans; you learn dem to be feber, live good
life, to kncnv God, and pr&y God. Alas! poor Friday,
faid I, what can I do againii their priefts of Bena-

LIFE AND ADVENTURES
b.irbarian coaft, whom I defigned to join, as the only
means to further our efcape. To which intent my
man and I went to fearch for a proper tree to fell,
whereof we might make a large periagua or tanoe,
to undertake the voyage: and indeed we were not
long in finding one fit for our purpofe, there being
enough of wood, in the ifland to have built a fleet of
large velfels; but ihe thing we principally wanted
was, to gei one fo near the water, that we might
launch it after it was finifhed, and not commit fo
horrid a miftake as I had done once before. ,".•-.-'
Well, after a great fearch for what was be ft and
moft convenient, Friday at laft, whofe judgment in
iuch affairs was much Superior to mine,' pitches up-
on a kind of wood the moft fitting for it. To 'this
day I cannot tell the name of the tree, nor defcribe
it any other way, than only by faying,: that it is very
like what we call fuftic, or betwixt that and the Ni-
caragua wood, being niuch of the fame colotir and
fmell. But though my man exceeded me in the
knowledge of the moft proper tree, yet 1 fhewed him
a much better and cleaner way to make a canoe than
ever he knew before: for he was for burning the.
hollow or cavity of the tree, in order to make this.
boat; but I then told him how we might do it with
tools, learning him at the fame time how to ufe
them, which indeed he did very dexteroufly; fothat
in a month's labour we finifhed it, making it very
Jiandibme, by cutting theoutfide into the true fhape
of a boat. After this it took us a full fortnight be-
fore we could get her into the water, which we did,.
as it were, inch by inch, upon great rollers: but
when flse was in, fhe would have carried twenty
inen, with all the eafe imaginable.
As I was very well pleafed, you may be fure, at the
lauiMiiiing of this man of war of mine, I was no lefs
«mazed to behold with what dexterity my man would
ge her, turn her, and paddle her -along. Well,

-venture over -well, though great blow wiiid. But my
defign was yet farther, which he was infenfible of;
and that was to make a maft ami fail, and to provide
her with an anchor and cable. As to a maft, that
was no difficult thing at all to procure; fo I fixed
upon a ftraight young cedar tree, which I found near
the place, great plenty of it abounding in the ifland;
and fetting Friday to cut it down, I gave him parti-
cular directions how to fhape and order it; but as to
the fail, that I managed tnyfelf. I very well knew I
had fome old ones, or pieces or fails enough, which
had lain fix and twenty years by me ;- but not being
careful to preferve them, as thinking I fhould Lave
no occafion to ufe them any more, when I came to
look them over, I found them almoft all rotten, ex-
cept two; and with thefe I went to work, and after
a great deal of pains and awkward tedious ftiiching
for want of needles, at length I finished a three-cor-
nered ugly thing, like what we call in England a
fhoulder of-muiton fail, to go with a boom at bottom
and a little fmall fprit at the top, like thofe which
our longboats ufe, and which I very well knew how
to manage; efpecially fince it was like that which I
had in my patron's fifhing boat, when, with my bay
Xury, I made my efcape from the Barbarian (hore.
It was near two months, I think, before I com-
pleted this work, that is, the rigging, and fitting my
ma ft and fails; and indeed they were nicely done,
having made a fmall ftay, and a fail, or forefail to it,
io affift, if we fhould turn to the weftward; and,
which was ftill more, I fixed a rudder to the ftern of
her, to fteer with; and though I was but a very in-
different fhipwright, yet, as i was fenfible of the
great ufefulnefs and abfolute neceffity of a thing like
this, I applied myfelf to it with fuch a conftam ap-
plication, that at laft I accomplifhed my defign; but
what with the many dull contrivances 1 had about it,
and the failure of many things, it roft roe as much pains
in
in ordering as in making the boat. Befides, when all
this was done, I had my man to teach what belonged
•toils navigation: for though he very well underftood
how to paddle a canoe along, he was an uiter ftran-
.ger to a fail and a rudder, and was amazed when he
Taw me work the boat to and again in the fea, by
them, and how the fail gibbed and filled this way or
•that way, as rhe courfe we failed changed. After
"fbme time, aud a little ufe, 1 made all thefe things
very familiar to him, fo that he became an expert
'failor, except in relation to the compafs, and that I
could make him underftand but little of. But, as it
happened, there was feldom occafion for it, there
being but little cloudy weather, and-fcarce ever aity
'fog in thofe parts; the ftars were always vifibk in Wid
the night, and the fhore perfpicuous by day, except *• H
in the rainy feafon, which con'fin«d every one to his *8f
habitation. :S
Thus entered in the feven and twentieth year of £*o
iny reign, or captivity, which you plea'fe,- (the laft j'pot;
'three of which, bieiTed with the company of my maa. !*««
'Friday, -ought not fo be reckoned), 1 kept the anni-
verfary of my landing here, wirhihe feme thankful-
nefs to God, for his tender mercies, as I did before;
and certainly, as I had great caule for a thankful ac-
knowledgement for my deliverance at firft, I had
niuch greater now, for fuch fingular and additional
teftimonies of the care of Providence over me, hi all
.piy diftreffes both of body and mind, and the great
•Jiopes I had of being effectually and fpeedily deliyef-
«ed; for 1 had a ftrong impreffion upon my mind,
-that I (hould not be another year in this iflaml. But,
-Jiowever, I ftill eowtinued on with my hufbandry,
-digging, planting; and fencing, as ufua! i gathering
--srnd curing my giapes, and doing all other thing*
that-were neceflary.
; Aird now'the rainy feafon beginning to come on,
.obliged me to-keep the longer witliin doors; but be-
fpre this, I brought my new ve|icl into the creek,
whew.
where I had landed my rafts -from the £hip, and haul-
ing her up to the fhore, I ordered my man Friday to
dig a dock fufficient to hold her in, and deep enough
to give her water, wherein (he might float; and theni
when the tide was out, we made a ftroog dam crof*
the end of it, to keep out the. water; by. which means
flie lay dry, as to the tide from the fea; apd to keep
the rain from her, we thatched her over, as it were,
with. boughs of trees, like a houfe ; and fo we waited
for the months of November and December, in-
which I defigned to venture over the ocean.
No fooner did the feafonable weather begin to draw
near, but fo much was. I elevated with this hew de-
figned adventure, that I daily prepared for the voy-
age. The firft thing I thought on. was, to lay by a
certain quantity of provifions, as a fufficient ftore for
fuch an expedition, intending in a week or fortnight's
time to open the dock, and launch out the. boat for
thaf purpofe. But one morning as I was very bufy
upon fomething neccflary for this occafion, I called
Friday to me, and bid him go to the fea fhore, and,
fee if he could find a turtle or tortoife, a thing which
we commonly had once a-week, as much upon ac-
count of the eggs, as for the fake of the flefh. He
had not been long gone, but he came running back,
as though he was purfued for life, and as it were flew
over my outward wall, or fence, like one that felt not
the ground, or fteps he fet his feet on; and before t
had time to enquire the reafon of his precipitation,
he ctifs out, 0 dear inajier, 0 farro-w! forroiu! Bad!
0 bad! Why, what's the matter, Friday? faid I. 0
yonder, yonder•, faid he, tbtre be one, two, or three ca-
noes! two, three, tturely (thought I) there muft be
fix, by my man's way of reckoning ; but, on a ftricter
mquiry, 1 found there were but three. Well, Priday,
fiii! I, don't be terrified, I warrant you we will not
only defend ourfelves agatr.ft 'em, but kill the moft
of thefe cruel favages. But though I comforted him
in the beft manner I could, the poor creature trembled
fe
fo, that I fcarce knew what to do with him '. 0 ma-
Jler, faid he, they come Itok Friday, cut piues Friday,
eat a me up. ' Why, Friday, faid Ii they will eat me
up, as well as you, and my danger is as great as yours.
But fince it is fo, we muft reiolve to fight for our
lives. What fay you? can you fight, Friday? Yes,
faid he very faintly, mefbtott mi kill what 1 can, but
there come great many number. Thai's no matter, faid
I again, our guns will terrify thofe that we do not kill:
I am very willing to (land by you to the laft drop of
my blood; now tell me, if you will do the like by'
me, and obey my orders in whatfoever 1 command?
Friday then anfwered 0 mafter, me lofe life for you, me
die when you bid die. Thus concluding all queftions
concerning his fidelity, immediately I fetched him a
good dram of rum, (of which I had been a very good
huftnnd), and gave it him to comfort his heart.
After he had drank it, I ordered him to take the two
fowling pieces, 'which we always tarried, and load
them with large fwan (hot, as big as fmsill piftolbul-
lets ; then I took four muikets, and loaded them with
two flugs, and five fmall bullets each, charging my
two piftols each with a brace, I hung my great fword,
as cuftomary, naked to my fide, and gave Friday his
hatchet, as a moft excellent weapon for defence.
"Thus prepared, I thought as well of myfelf as any
knight errant that ever handled a fword andfpear. I
took my perfpective glafs, and went up to the fide of
the hill, to fee what I could difcover; and I perceived
very foon, by my glafs, that there were one and twen-
ty favages, three prisoners, and three canoes; and
that their chief concern feemed to be the triumphant
banquet upon the three poor human bodies, a th ng
which by {his time I had obferved was very common
ivith them. I alfo remarked, that they did not land
at that place from whence Friday made his efcape,
but nearer to the creek, where the fhore was low
and where a thick wood came very clofe to the fea.
My foul was then tilled with indignation and abhor-
rence
rente at fuch inhuman wretches, which put a period
to dll my former thoughts in their vindication; nei-'
ther would I give myfeU time to confider their right
of conqueft, as I had done before; but defcending
from the mountain, I came down to Friday, and told
him, I was refolved to go fpeedily to them and kill
them all; alking him again, in the fame breath•', if
he would ftand by me? When by this time being
recovered from his fright, and his fpirit much cheer-
ed with the dram I had given him, he was very
pleafant, yet ferioufly telling me, as he did before,
when I bid di'e', ht would die. ,..•'..-. '( - ••-
And now it was, having fixed my refolution in fo
ftrong a manner, that nothing could diveft my breaf
t
of its uncommon fury, I immediately divided the
loaded arms betwixt us. To my man Friday I gave
a piftol to ftick in his girdle, with three guns upon
his moulder, a weight too great, I confefs, to bear;
but what muft a poor king do, who had but one fol-'
dier in the world? But to (hew I made him bear no
more than what I would lay on myfelf, I (luck the
other piftol in my girdle, and other three guns upon
my fhoulders; nay fomething more, but that was
like iEfop's burden, a fmall bottle of rum, which was
foon lightened, to our exceeding refrefhment. Thus
we marched out, under a ponderous load of armour,
like two invincible champions, with a quamity of
powder and bullets to ftand our battle, and load a-
gain, when the pieces were difcharged. And now
my orders being to be obeyed, I charged Friday to
keep clofe behind me, and' not to ftlr, or -fhoot, or
attempt any thing till I commanded him; and, in
the interim, not to (peak fo much as one word.. It'
was in this order I fetched a compafs to the right
hand, of near a mile, as well to get over the creek,.
45 to attain the wood ; and by this 1 thought to come
within (hot of them before 1 could be difcerned; as
I found bjf my glafs would not be difficult to accom-
pliih.'''

LIFE AND ADVE-NTU-RES
But how fickle and wavering is- the mind'of-men,
even in our greateft fury and ilrpngeft inclination?
For while I was taking this march, my reioiution be-
gan to abate, not through fear of their numbers, who
were a parcel of naked unarmed wretches, but thole
reflections occurred to my thoughts: What power
was I comtniffioned with, or whi« qccafton or necef-
fityhad I logo andimbrwe ipy hands inhuman blood,
and murder people that had neither done nor intend-
ed to do me any wrqngi! They werp .innocent in par-
ticular as to me-; and.their barbarous cuftora was not
only their misfortune, but a figa that God had lefe-
them in the mof t immenfe ftnpidity ; but yet did not
warrant me to be a judge of their actipns, much Ids
an executioner-of his righteous judgments;. thatoa.
the contrary, whenever. he thought fit,.he would take..
vengeance on them himfelf,, and- punifh. them iniav
national way, according to their national crimes; but
this was nothing at all to me, who had no concern
with them. Indeed my man Friday might juftify
himfelf, becaufe they were his declared enemies, ofii
that very fame nation dial went to facrifice him be-
fore; and indeed it was lawful for him to altack
them, which I could not fay was fo with refpect to
U)C. So warmly did thefe things prefs upon my
thoughts all the w^y I went,, that I,only Felblved to
place myfelf fo as to behold their bloody emeruin-
ment, without falling upon them, except fomething
more than ordinary, by. Qpd's, fpecial direction,
flaould oblige me thereto. . iff. \ < '."•'•
Thus fixed in my refoluiion, I entered info the
thick wood, (my man Fiiday following :ne clofe be-
Iiind), when with all poffible warinefs and.filence I
marched till I came to the fkirt of it, on that fide
which was thcneareft to them; foronly oneend.oFthe
wood interpofpd between me and them. Upon which .

he could plainly perceive their actions. Accord-
ingly he did as I commanded him, and came back
with this melancholy ftory, that they were all about
their fire, eating the flefh of one of their prifoners;
and that another lay bound upon the (and, a little
diftam from them, whom they detigncd for their
next facrifice; and this, be told me, was not one
of their nation, but one of thofe very bearded men,
who were driven by a ftorm into their country,
•and of whom he had fo often talked to me about.
You may be fure, that, upon hearing this, my foul
was ready to fink within me; when afcending up
into a tree, I faw plainly, by my glals, a white man,
who lay upon the beach or the lea, with his hands
and feet tied with flags, or things refembling rufhes,
being covered with cloaths, and leemed to be an
European. From the tree, where I took this pro-
fpedt, I perceived another tree, and a thicket beyond
it, about fifty yards nearer to them, than where I
was; which, by taking a fmall circle round, I might
come at undifcovered, and then I fhould be within
half a (hot of thele devourers. And this confidera-
tion alone, to be more perfectly revenged upon them,
made me with hold my paffion, though 1 was en-
raged to the higheft degree imaginable; when go-
ing back about twenty paces, 1 got behind ibme
bulhes, which held all the way till I came to the
other tree; and then I afcended to a little riflng
ground, not above eighteen yards diflance, and there
I had a full view of thefe creatures, and 1 could per-
ceive all their adlions; - .,;
Such a fight drd then appear, as obliged me not
to lofc a moment's time. No lefs than nineteen of
thtfe dreadful wretches fat upon the ground, clofe
huddled together, expreffing all the delight imagi-
nable at fo barbarous an entertainment; and they
had juft fent other two to murder this poor unhap-
py Chriftian, and br-iitg him limb by limb to their
fire; for they were juft then going to untie the
'• - G bauds
hands from his feet, in order for death, as feittrs
.'ire knocked oft" the feet of malefactors before they
KHO to the place of execution. Hereupon, imme-
diately turning to my man, Now, Friday, faid I,
mind what I fay, fail in nothing, but do exactly as
you fee me do. All which he promifing he would
perform, I fet down one of my muikets, and the
fowling-piece upon the ground, and Friday did the
fame by his; and with the other mufket I took my
aim at the favages, bidding him do the like: Are
you ready? faid I. Yes, Mafter, faid he. Why then
fire at them, faid I; and that very moment I gave
iire likewife.
I only killed one, and wounded two; but my
man Friday, taking his aim much better than 1>
killed two, and wounded three. You may be fure
they were in a dreadful confternation, at fuch an
Tinexpe&ed difalier; and thofe who yet had efcaped
our penetrating (hot, immediately jumped upon their
feer, but were in fuch coufufion, that they knew
not which way to run or look, not knowing from
whence their 4eftruction came. We then threw
down our pieces, and took up others, giving a fe-
cond dreadful volley; but as they were loaded only
with fwan-fhot, or fmall piftol-bullets, we perceived
only two of them fall; though many were wound-
ed, who run yelling and fcreaming about like mad
creatures. Now, Friday, faid I, lay down your
piece, and ta!;e up the muflcet and follow me. He
did fo, with great courage, when (hewing ourfeives
to the favages, we gave a great (bout, and made
Jiretflyto the poor viaim, who would have been
facrificed, had not our firft fire obliged the butchers,
with three others, to jump into a canoe. By roy
arder Friday fired at them, at which (hot I thought
ie killed them all, by reafon of their falling to the
Bottom of the boat; however, he killed two, and
mortally wounded a third. In the mean ume I cut
;hc flags that tied the hands and feet of the poor

creature, and lifting him up, aiked him in the Par-
tiiguefe tongue, What he was? He anfwered me in
Latin, Chrijiianus; but fo very weak and faint, that
he could fcarce ftand or fpeak. Immediately I gave
him a dram, and a piece of bread to cherifh him,
and afked him what countryman he was? He faid,
Efpaniola, and then uttered all the thankfulnefs
imaginable for his deliverance. Signior, (faid I,
with as much Spanifb as I was mafter of), let us talk
afterwards, but fight now; here, take this fword
and piftol, and do what you can. And indeed he
did fo with fuch courage and intrepidity, that he cut
two of them to pieces in an inftant, the favages not
having the power to fly for their lives. I ordered
Friday to run for thofe pieces we had left at the
tree, which he brought me with great fwiftnefs,
and then 1 gave him my mulket, while 1 loaded the
reft. But now there happened a "fierce encounter
between the Spaniard and one of the favages, who
had made at him with one of their wooden fwords;
and though the former was as brave as could be ex-
pected, having twice wounded his enemy in the head;
yet, being fo weak and faint, the Indian had thrown
him upon the ground, and was wrefting my fword
out of his hand, which the Spaniard very wifely
quitting, dvew out his piftol, and fhot him through
the body before I could come near him, though I
was running to his affiftance. As to Friday, he pur-
fued the flying wretches with his hatchet, difpatch-
ing three, but the reft were too nimble for him. The
Spaniard taking one of the fowling pieces, wounded
two, who running into the wood, Friday purfued
and killed one; but the other, notwithftanding h:s
wounds, plunged himfelf into the fea, and fwam to
thole two who were left in the canoe, which, with
one wounded, were all that efcaped out of one and
twenty. The account is as follows.

The favages in the canoe worked very hard to
get out of our reach, and; Friday was as eager in
purfuing them; and indeed I was no lefs anxious
about their efcape, left, after the news had been
carried to their people, they fhould return in mul-
titudes, and deftroy us. So being refolved to pur-
fue them, I jumped into one of their canoes, and
bid Friday follow me; but no fooner was I in, than,
to my furprife, 1 found another poor creature, bound
hand and foot for the flaughter, juft as the Spaniard
had been, with very little life in him. Immedi-
ately I unbound him, and would have helped him
lip; but he could neither ftand nor fpeak, but
groaned fo piteoufly, as thinking he was only un-
bound in order to be flain. Hereupon I bid Friday
fpenk to him, and tell him of his deliverance; when
pulling out my bottle, I made the poor wretch drink
a dram, which, with the joyful news he had receiv-
ed, fo revived his heart, that he fat up in the boat.
• As foon as Friday began to hear him fpeak, and
look more fully in his face, it would have moved
£.17 one to tears to perceive his uncommon tranf-
ports of joy ; for be faffed, embraced. him, hug-
ged him, cried, laughed, hallooed, jumped about,
danced, fung, then cried again, wrung his hands,
beat his face and head, then fung and jumped about
again, like a • diffracted creature: fo that it was a
great while before I could make him fpeak to me,
or tell me what was the matter with him ; but

when he ciine to the liberty of his fpeech, at
he told me it was his father.
Here indeed I vvas infinitely moved to fee that du-
tiful and tender affection this poor iavage had to his,
aged parent. He would fit down by him in.the
boat, open his bread:, and hold his father's head
clqfe to his bofoin, half an hour together, to che-
rifh it; then he took his arms and ancles, which
yere flift'and numbed with binding, and chaffed and
rubbed them with hia> hands; by which means pej-
ceiving what the cafe was, I gave him fome rum,
which proved of great benefit to him.
While we were bufv in this action, the f.iva^cs
4 '.
had gotten almoll out of'fight; and happy k was,
we did not purfue them; for there arofe from the
north weft, which continued all night long, fucb.
a violent ftorm, that I could not fuppofe otherwife
but that they were all drowned. After this, I call-
ed Friday to me, and allied him, if he had given his
father any. bread? Hz (hook his head, and faid,
None, not one bit, me eat a. up all? fo I gave him a
cake of bread out of a little pouch I carried for this
«nd. I likewife gave him a dram for himfelf, and
two or three bunches of raifins for his father. Both
thefe he carried to him,. for he would make him
drink the dram to comfort him. ..
Away he then runs out of the boat as if he was be-
witched, with fuch an extraordinary fwiftnefs, that
he was out of fight as it wer* in an inftant; but
at his return I perceived him flacken' his pace, be-.
caufe he had fomething in his hand. And this I
found to be, as he approached nearer, ai> earthen
jug with fome water to his father, with two more
cakes of bread which he delivered into my hands.
Being very thirfly myfelf, I drank fome of the wa-
ter, of which when his father had drank fufficient-
Iy, it more revived his fpirits than all the rum I had
.given him,'.-. ,
1 then. called Friday to me, and ordered him to
63 carry
carry the Spaniard one of the cakes, and fome water,
who was repofing himfelf upon a green place unddr
the fhade of a tree, but fo weak, that though he
exerted himfelf, he could not ftand upon his feet.
Upon which I ordered Friday to rub and bathe his
ancles with rum, as he did his father's. But every
minute be was employed in this, he would caft a
wifhful eye towards the boat, where he left his fa-
ther fitting; who fuddenly difappearing, he flew
like lightning to him, and finding he only laid
Jiimfelf down to eafe hisf limbs, he returned back to
me prefently; and then 1 fpoke to the Spaniard to
let Friday help him, and lead him to the boat, in
order to be conveyed to my dwelling where 1 would
take care of him. Upon which, Friday took him
vipou his back, and fo carried him to the canoe,
•letting him clofe by his father; and prefently ftep-
ping out again, launched the boat off, and paddled
lt along the fhore fafter than I could walk, though
the wind blew-very hard too; and having brought
them fafe to the creek, away he runs to fetch the
other canoe; which he brought to the creek almoft
•as 'foon as I got to it by land, when wafting me
-over, he took our new guefts out of the boat;
-fcut fo weak were they, that I was forced to make
a kind of a hand-barrow, and when 1 came to my
caftle, not being willing to muke an entrance into
rny wall, we made them a handfome tent, covered
wi'th old faiis, and boughs of trees, making two good
l>cds of rice ftraw, with blankets to lie upon and
rover them. Thus, like an abfolute king, over
fubiects who owed their lives to me, I thought
myfelf very confiderable, efpecially as I had now
three religions in my kingdom, my man Friday be-
ing a ProtefUnt, hi's father a Pagan, and the Spa-
niard a Papift; but I gave hberty of confcience to
them all. .
To get provifions for my poor weak'fubjects.I
Ordered Friday to kill me a yearling goat; which
when
when he had done, I cut off the hinder quarters,
and chopping it into final] pieces, boiled and ftew-
ed it, puu'nig barley and rice into the broth. This
I carried into their tent, fet a table, dined with
them tnyfelf, and encouraged them. Friday was-
my interpreter to his father, and indeed to the Spa-
niard too, who fpoke the language of the iavages
pretty well. After dinner 1 ordered Friday to fetch
home all our arms from the field of battle, and the
next day to bury the dead bodies, which he did ac-
cordingly.
And now I made Friday enquire of his father whe-
ther he thought thofe favages had efcaped the late
ftorm in their canoe? and if fo, whether they would
not return with a power too great for us to refill?
He anfwered, that he thought it impoffible they
could outlive the ftorm l. or if they were driven
Southwardly, they would come to a land where they
would as certainly be devoured, as if they were
drowned in the fea. And fuppofe they had attained-
their own country, the ftrangenefs of their fatal and
bloody attack, would make them tell their people,
that the reft of then* were killed by thunder and
lightning, not by the hand of man, but by two
heavenly fpirits (meaning Friday and me) who were
fent from above to deftroy them. And this, he
faid, he knew, becaufe he heard them lay the lame
to one another. And indeed he was in the right on't;
for I have heard fince, that theie four men gave
out, that whoever went to that inchanted ifland,
would be deftroyed by fire from the gods.
No canoes appearing fome time after, as I ex-
pected, my apprchenfions ceafed: Inftead of which
my former thoughts of a voyage took place, efpe-
ciaily when Friday's father aflured me I fhould have
good ufage in his nation. As to the Spaniard, he told!
me that fixteen more of his countrymen, and Par-
tuguefe, who had been fhipwrecked, made their e-
fcage thiiher i that though they were in union with
G 4 the
the favages, yet they wece very miferable for want
of proviiions and other neceflaries. When I afked
liirri about the particulars of his voya^*, he an-
fwered, that their (hip was bound from Rio de h
Plata. to the Ha-iannah; that when the (hip was loft,
only five men peri/hed in the ocean ; the reft ha-
ving faved themfelves in the boat, were now landed
on the main continent. And what do they in-
tend to do there? faid I. He replied, they have
concerted meafures to efcape, by building a vefiel,
J?ut that they had neither tools nor proviiions, fo
i hat all their defigns came to nothing. Suppofing
(faid 1) I fhould make a propofal, and invite them
Jiere, would they not carry me prifoncr to New
Spain? He anfwered, no; for he knew them to
foe fuch honeft men, as would fcorn to act fuch in-
Jiuman bafenefs to their deliverer: That if 1 pleaf-
cd, he and the old favage would go over to them,
talk with them about it, and bring me an anfwer;
that they fhould all fwear fidelity to me as their lea-
tier, upon the holy facrament; and, for his part,
lae would not only do the fame, but (land by me to
thelaftdrop of his blood, fhould there be occa-
iion.
Thefe folemn aflurances made me refolve to grant
them relief, and to fend thefe two over for that
-purpofe : but when every thing was ready, the Spa-
ftiard raifed an objection, which carried a great deal
of weight in it: Tou kno-w, Sir, faid he, that ha-
ving been feme time with yau, I cannot but befenfibleof
your flock of rice and corn, fujjicicnt, perhaps, for us
^t pr-eftnt, but not far lh;m, Jhculd they come ova pre-
fgntly; much hft to vicluala vtjfel for an intended voy-
Jaze, Want might be as great an occafion for them to
ttifatree and rebel, as the children of ifrael did agamjt
god him/elf, -when they wanted bread in the wildernejs.
tind therefore my advice is to wait another barveji, and.
in. toe mean time cultivate and improve feme more land,
. .... viberct?

,whereby we may have plenty of provi/tons, in order tt
execute our defign, • . '•
This advice of- the Spaniard's I approved ex-
tremely; and fo fatisfied was I of his fidelity, that
I efteemed him ever after. And thus we all four
went to work upon fome more land, and againft
feed time we had gotten fo much cured and trim?
med up, fufficient to fow 22 bufhels of barley on,.
ancl 16 jars-of rice, which was in fhort all the feed
we had to fpare. As we were four in number, and
by this-time all in'good health, we feared not a hun-
dred Indians fhould they venture to attack us: and
while the corn was growing, I pitched upon fome
trees, fit to build ius a large vefiel, in cafe the Spa-
niards cams over; which being marked, I ordered
Fridiy and his father to cut them down, appointing
the Spaniard, who was now my privy coun£ellor,
to overfee and direct the work.. 1 likewife increaf*-
ed my flocks of goats, by fhooting the wild dams,
and bringing home their kids to my inclofurc';
nor did I negle'ct the grape-feafon but cured theiii.
as ufual, though I had fuch a quantity now, as
would have filled 80 barrels with raifins. And thus
ail. of us being employed^ they in working, and I ia
providing for them, till hafveft came, God Almigh-
ty blefled the increafe of it fo much, that front
twenty-two barrels of barley, we-threfhed out two •
hundred and twenty^ and the like quantity of rice,?
fufBeient to victual a fhip fit to carry me and all the-'
Spaniards to any part of America.
Thus the principal objection being anfwered by
a fufficient ftock of pro^ifiont I fent my two am--
badadors over to the main-land, with a regal autho--
rity to adminifter the oaths of allegiance and fi-
delity, and have an inftrument figned under their
hands, though I never afked whether they had pen,
ink, or paper; when giving each of them a mufkct,,

nough for eight days, they failed away with a fair
gale, on a day when the moon was at full.
Scarce a forinight had pafled over my head, but,
impatient for their return, I laid me down to fleep
one morning, when a ftrange accident happened,
which was u/hered in by my man's coming run-
ning to me, and calling aloud, Mafter, mnjier, they
are come, they are come. Upon which, not dream-
log of any danger, out I jumped from my bed, put
on my cloaths, and hurried through my little grove:
when looking towards the fea, 1 perceived a boat
about a league and a half diftant, ftanding in for
the fhore, with the wind fair. 1 beheld they did
not come from the fide where the land Iay on, but
from the fouthermoft end of the ifland: fo thefe
being none of the people we wanted,, I ordered Fri-
day to lie ftill, till fuch time as I came down from
the mountain, which with my ladder I now alcend-
ed, in order to difcover more fully what they were:
and now, with the help of my perfptctive glafs, I
plainly perceived an Englifh fhip, which I conclu-
ded it to be, by the fafhion of its long boat; and
which filled me with fudi uncommon tranfpons of
joy, that I cannot tell how to defcribe; and yet
fome fecret doubts hung about me, proceeding from
I know not what caufe, as though I had reafon to
be upon my guard. And indeed I would have no
man contemn the fecret hints and intimations of
danger, which very often are given, when he may
imagine there is no poffibility of its being real: for
had not I been warned by this filent admonition, I
had been in a worfe fituaiion than before, and per-
haps inevitably ruined.
Not long it was, before I perceived the boat to
approach the fhore, as though they looked for a
place where they might conveniently land; and at
laft they ran their boat on fhore upon the beach,
about half a mile's diftancc; which proved fo much
the happwr for me, fince had they cwne into th«

Wine of an
CTeek, they had landed juft at my door, and might
not only have forced me out of my caftle, but plun-
dered me of all 1 had in the world. Now I-was-
ftilly convinced they were all Englifhmen, three of
which were unarmed and bound; when immedi-
ately the lirft four or five leaped on (Lore, and took
thofe three out of the boat a< prifoners ; one of
whom I could perceive uftd the moft paffionate ge--
ftures of entreaty, affliction, and defpair, while the
others, in -a lefier degree, (hewed abundance of con--

Not knowing the meaning of this, I was very
much aftoniftved, and I beckoned to Friday, who was'
below, to afcend the mountain, and likewife view
this fight.- O mafter, fays he to me, you fee Eng-
IMh m.:ns cat prifiners as -well as Savage mans. And
do you think- they will eat them, Friday? faid i,

Friday, I am much more concerned left they mur-
tier them; but as for eating them up, that I am lure

And now I not only lamented my misfortune in' •
not having the Spaniard and favage with me, but-
alfo that I 'Could not come within fhot of them un^
perceived, (they having no fire arms among them),
and fave thefe three men whom I thought they wei u
going to kill with their fwords. But fome comfort
it was to me, that I perceived they were fet at li-
berty to ga were they pleafed, the rafcally feameu
feattering about as though they had a mind to fee
the place: and fo long did they negligently rambki
that the tide had ebbed fo low, as to leave the-bone
aground. Nor were the two men that were in her
more circumfpect: for having drunk a little ton
much liquor, they fell faft afleep; but one of them
waking before the other, and perceiving the boat
too faft aground for his ftrength to move it, -he hal-
looed out to the reft, who made all poffible expedi-
tion to come to him : but, as Providence ordered-
G 6 k,,
• it, all their force was ineffectual to launch her, when
I could hear them fpeak to one another, -why, Lt
her done,. Jack, can't yt, Jbe'll fioat next tide; by
which words I was fully convinced they were my
o«rn countrymen. All this while I lay very quier,
as being fully fenfible it could be no lefs than ten
liours before the boat would be afloat, and then it
would be fo dark, as that they could not eafily per-
ceive me, by which means I fhould be at more li-
berty to hear their talk, and obferve .all their mo-
tions: not but that I prepared for my defence ; yet
as I had now another fort of enemies to combat
with, I acled with more 'caution. I took two fu-
fees on my fhouIJers, and gave Friday three mulkets;
belldes, my formidable goat-lkin coat, and mon-
ftrous cap, made me look as fierce and terrible as
Jiercules of pid, efpecially when two piftols were
ftuck in my belt, ami my naked fword hanging by
any fide.
It was my defign at firft not to make any attempt
till it was dark, but it being ndw two o'clock, in
the very heat of the day, the failure were all ftrag-
• gling info the woods, and undoubtedly were lain
tlown to fleep. The three poor diflrefled creatures,
too anxious to- get any repofe, were, however,.
feated under the (hade of a- great tree, about a quar-
ter of a mile from me. Upon which, without any
tnore ado, I approached towards them, with my
inan following behind me, and, before i was perr
celved, I called aloud to them in Spaniib, What are
ye, Gentlemen?
At thefe words they ftarted up in great confu-
flon, when they beheld the ftrange figure I made;
they returned no anfwer, but feemed as if they would
fly from me; Gentlemen, (laid I in EngUJJi), don't te

ving but this fervant only : here are arms and ammnni-
tion: tell freely your condition, can -wefave you? The
ftory, faid he, is too long to relate, fince our
butchers are fo near: but, Sir, I was mafter of that
fhip, my men ifeve mutinied, and it is a favour they
have put my mate, this paflenger, and me, on fhore
without murdering us, though we expect nothing
but pet idiing here. Are lour enemies gone? faid I.
No, replied he, (pointing to a ihicket) there they
lie, while my heart trembles, left, having feen and
heard us, they fhould murder us all. Have. t-beli
fre-armi? faid I. They have but two pieces, iaid
he, one of which is left in the boat. He alfo told
me, there were two enormous villains among them,
that were the authors of this mutiny, who, if they
were killed or feized, might induce the reft to re-
turn to their obedience. Well, well, faid I, let u«
retire farther under the.covering .of the woods;. and
there it was I made thefe conditions with him,
I. That while they ftaid in the ifland, they fhould
aot pretend to any authority; but fhould entirely
conform to my orders, and return me the arms
which I fhould put into their hands.
II. That if the fhip was recovered, they fhould
afford Friday an.d my (elf .our, paflage gratis to Eng-
land. - •, „ - . •
When h£ had given me all the fotisfaction I could
defire, I gave;him and his two companions .'eath of
them a gun, with powder and ball fuiScient, iadvi*
fmg them to fire upon them a* they lay fkcping.
The capiaia modeftly fald, that h': w«s fojry. to kin
them; though, on the other hand, to let thefe vil-
lains
Iains efcape, who were the authors of his raiferf
might be the ruin of us all; but, faid he, do as you'
think fit: and fo accordingly I fired, killing one of:
the captain's ehiefeft enemies,- and wounding the
other, who eagerly called for affiftance; but the
captain, (who had referred his piece) coming up to
him, Sirrah, faid he, ^tis too late to call for ajjijlance,
you Jboul&rather cry to God to-pardon your vitlnny; and'
fo knocked him down with the ftock of his gun :-
three others were alfo ffightly woanded, who at my
approach Cried out for mercy. This the captain
granted, upon condition that they wolild-fwear-to be
true to him in recovering- the fhip,- which they fo-
Jemnly did: however, I obliged the captain to keep
them bound. After which If' fent Friday and the
captain's mate to fecure the boat, and bring away
the oars and fail; wheu at their return, three men .
coming back, and feeing their late diftreSsd captain,.
grow their conqueror, fubmitted to be bound alfo.
.And then it was, that having more liberty, I related:
the adventures of my- whole Ik'e, which he heard.
triih a ferious and wonderful attention. After this.
I carried him and his two companions into my little
fortified caftle, fhewed'them all- my. conveniences;.
and refrefhed them with fueh'-proviiions as I could
afford. When-this was over, we began toconfidcr"
tibout regaining the fhip :- be faid, that there were
twenty-fix hands on board, who knowing iheir lives-
\vcrc forfeited by 'the law* for cc n=piracy and iiiu-i
tiny, were fo very hardened, that it would be
dangerous • for- our fmall company to attack them.
This was a reafonable inference, indeed ^ but fome-
tbing we muft refolve on, and immediately put in •
execution: we. therefore heaved the boat upon the
beach fo. high that fhc could not fhoot off at high
%v«iter mark, and broke a hole in her not eafily to be
fiopped; fo that all the fignal* they gave for tlie
boat to come on board were in vain. This obliged
them
them to fend'another boat afhore, with ten meat
armed, whofe faces the captain plainly defcried, the
boatfwain being the chief officer; but he laid there
were three honeft lads among them, who were
forced into the xonfpiracy. Hereupon I gave him
frefh courage, (for I had perceived he was in con-
cern); in the mean while fecuring our prifoners,
except two, whom we took to. our afliftance, we
thought ourlelves able enough to adventure a battle.
When the falters landed, and beheld their boat in
that condition, they inpt only balooed, but, fired .for
their companions to hear, yet they received no an—
fwer, This ftriick them with horror. and amaze-
ment, thinking theic companions were murdered,
they made as if they would return to the fhip. I could'
perceive the captain's countenance change at this, tiilo
of a fudden three men were ordered to look after the
boat, while the, other feven leapt on fhore, in order
to fearch for their companions: and indeed they.
came to the brow of the hill, near my ancient caftle,.
from whence they could fee to a great diftance in
the woods, and there fhoming and hallooing till tired.
and w«ary, they at length feated .themfelves under a
fpreading tree. My opinion was* that nothing.
could be done till night, when I might ute fome
artifice to get them all out of the boat: but of a
fudden they ftarted up, and made to the fea-fide.;
hereupon I ordered Friday and the captain's mate to
go over the creek, and haloo as loud as they could,
and fo decoying them into the woods, come round
to me again. And this indeed had good effect; for
they followed the noife, till coming weftward to the
creek, they called for their boat to carry them over,
and taking one of the men out of her, left two to
look after her, having faftened her to the ftump of
a little tree on fhoae. Hereupon immediately the
captain and our party pafling the creek, out of their
fight, we furprifed them both, by the captain's knock-
ing down one, and ordering the other to furrender
upon.
i*.'
upon pain of death, and who, being the honefteft of
them all, fincerely ioined with us. By this time it
was pretty late; when the reft returning to their
boat, which they found aground in the creek the
tide out, and the men gone, they ran about wring-
Ing their hands, crying it was an inchanted ifland,.
and that they fhoutd be all murdered by fpirits or
devils. My inert would willingly have fallen upon-
them, but I would not agree to hazard any of our
party. But to be more certain, Friday and the
captain crawled upon their hands and feet as near
as poffible; and when the boatfwain approached in
fight, fa eager was the captain, that he fired, and
Jcilled him on the fpot: Friday wounded the next
rnan, and a third ran away. Hereupon I advanced

Hereupon Atkins implored the captain to intercede
for his life, and the reft begged that they might not;
be fent to England. This anfwersd our project for
feizing the fhip. For after fending Atkins, and two
of the worft, faft bound to the cave, and the reft
being committed to my bower, I lent the captain to
treat with them in the governor's name, offering
them pardon if they would affift in recovering the
fhip. Upon which they all promifed to ftand by him
till the laft drop of their blood; and whoever acted
treacheroufly, fhould be hanged in chains upon the
beach. They were all releafcd on thefe affurances;
and then the captain repaired the other boat, making
bis paflenger captain-of her, and gave him four men
well armed; while hiinfclf, his mate, and five
more, went in the other boat. By midnight they
came within call of the fhip, when the captain or-
dered Robinfon to hail her, and tell them that with
great difficulty they had found the men at laft. But
while they were dilcouriing, the captain, his mate,
and the reft entered, and knocked down the fecond
mate and carpenter, fecured thofe that were upon
the deck, by putting them under hatches, while the
other boat's crew entered and fecured the forccaftle;
they then broke into the round-houfe, where the
mate, after fame refiftance, fhot fhe pirate captain
through the head, upon which all the reft yielded
themfelves prifoners. And thus the fhip being re-
covered, the joyful fignal was fired, which I heard
with the greateft joy imaginable: nor was it long
before he brought the fhip to an anchor at the
creek's mouth, where coming to me unawares, There,
fays he, my deareil friend and deliverer, there is your
JLip, and vie are your fervantf; a comfort fo un-
fpeakable, as made me fwoon in his arms, while
with gratitude to heaven we were tenderly embracing
each other. ... .,'.,.
. ., Nothing
-
Nothing now remaining, but to confult what we
/hould do with the prifoners, whom he thought it
was not fafe to take on board. Hereupon, concert-
ing with the captain, I dcefled myfelf in one of his
iuits, and fending for them, told them, That AS I
was going to leave the ifland with all my people, if
they would tarry there, their lives fhould be fpared;
if not, they fhould be hanged at the firft: port they
came at. They agreed to ftay. Hereupon I told
them my whole ftory, charging them to be kind to
the Spaniards that were expected, gave them all my
arms, and informing them of every thing neceflary
for their fubfiftence, I and my man Friday went on
board. But the next morning two of the men came
fwimming to the fhip's fide, defiring the captain to
take them on board, though he hanged them after-
wards, complaining mightily how barbaroufly the
Others ufed them. Upon which I prevailed with the
captain to take them in, and being feverely whipt
and pickled, they proved more honeft for the future.
.And fo 1 bid farewell to this ifland, carrying along
with me my money, my parrot, umbrella, and goat-
ficin cap; fetting fail December 12, 1686, after
twenty-eight years, two months, and nineteen days
i-efidence, that fame day and month that I efcaped
from Salee, landing in England, June 11, 1787, affer
five and thirty years abfence from my own country,
ivhich rendered me altogether a' firanger there.
Here I found my firft captain's widow alive, wha
Jiad buried a-JVcond hufband, but in very mean cir-
c'umftinces,; and whom I made mighty eafy upon my
account."' '96on after I went down to Yorkfhire,
where all my family were expired, except two
fiilers, and as many of one of my brother's children.
I found ntr-prdvifoa had been made for me, they
concluding I bad been long fince dead; fo that I
was but iii a very fknder ftation. Indeed the cap-
tain did me a great kmdnefs, by his report to the-
aters, how I'had delivered their Ihip on the defo-
late.
late ifland, upon which they made me a prefent of
2«ol. Sterling. I next went to Lifbon, taking my
man Friday with me, and there arriving in April, I
met the Portuguefe captain who had taken me on
board on the African coaft; but being ancient, he
had left oft" the fea, and refigned all his bufinefs to
his fon, who followed the Brazil trade. So altered
both of us were, that we did not know each other at
firft, till I difcovered myfelf more fully to him. Af-
ter a few embraces, I began to enquire of my con-
cerns; and then the old gentleman told me, that it
was nine years fince he had been at Brazil, where my
partner was then living, but my truftees were both
dead ; that he believed I fhould have a good account
of the product of my plantation; that the imagi-
nation of my being loft had obliged my truftees to
give an eftiniate of my fhare to the procurator fifcal,
who, in cafe of my not returning, had given one third
to the king, and the reft to the monaftery of St.
Auguftine; but if I put in my claim, or any one for
me, it would be returned, except the yearly product,
which was given to the poor. 1 then defired him to
tell me what improvement he thought had been made
of my plantation, and whether he imagined it was
worth my while to look after it? He anfwered, he
did not know how much it was improved; but this
he was certain of, that my partner was grown vafHy
rich upon his half of it; and that he had been in-
formed, that the king had 200 moidores per annum
for his third part. He added, that the furvivors of
my truftees were perfons of an ingenuous character;
that my pariner could witnefs my title, my name be-
ing regiftered in the country, by which means I
fhould indifputably recover considerable fums of
money. But, anfwered I, how could my truftees
difpofe of myeffedts, when I made you only my heir?
This he faid was true; but there being no affidavit
made of mf death, he could hot act as my executor^
However, be had ordered his foit (then at Biazil) to
act by' procuration on ray account, and he had ta-
ken poficffion of my lugar-houie, having accounted
hirafelf for eight years with my partner and truftees
for the profits, of which he would give me a very
good account. /.
And indeed this he performed very faithfully, in
a few days, making himfelf indebted tome 470 moi-
dores of gold, over and above what had been loft at
feax after i had left the place. And then he re-
counted to me what misfortuneshe had gone through
which forced my money out of his hands, to buy
pirt in a new Ihip: tut, fays he, you Jlyall not -want)
take this, and -when my fon returns, every farthing/ball
t'e p.nid you. Upon vihich lie put into my hand a
purfe of 150 moidores in gold, as likewife the inftru-
rnent containing the title to the fhip which his foo
vras in, and which he offered as fecurity for the rc-
pwinder. But really when i faw fo much goodneis,
generofity, tendernefs, and real honefty, I had not
the heart to accept it; for fear he fhoald ftraiten
lumfelf, upon my account. ft ^ti.true, faid he, it
may be fo; but thsn the money is yours, not mini, and
you may have the greatt/l occafion for it. However,
J returned fifty of them back again, prpmifing that
1 would freely give him the other hundred when I
got my effects in my hands, and that I defigned to
go myielf for that purpofe. But he told me h«
could law: me that trouble, and fo cau.fed me to en-
ter my name, with a public notary, as likewife my
affidavit, wuh a procuration affixed to it; and this
lie ordered me to fend in a letter to one of his ac-
quaintance, a merchant in Brazil: and indeed no-
thing could be more faithfully and honourably ob-
ferved; for in feven months time I had a very faith-
ful account of a)l ray effects, /what fums of. money
vvere railed, what expended, and what remained tor
my uft: in a word, 1 found myfelf to beworthsooo/.

Ave Manas he had faid to the Virgin Mary for irir
prefervation, defiring me to accept kindly (ome pre-
ients he had fent me, which I found (hewed the
greateft generofity.
No (boner did the fhip arrive, but I rewarded my
faithful captain, by returning him the hundred moi-
dores; and not only forgiving him all he owed me,
I allowed him yearly a hundred more, and fifty to
his fon, during their lives. And now being refol-
ved to go to Englaud, I returned let'ters of thanks
to the prior of lit. Auguftine, and in particular to
my old partner, with veiy fuitable prefents. By the
captain's advice I was perfuaded to go by land to
Calais, and there ta-ke paffage for England; when,
a= it happened, I got a young Englifh gentleman, a
merchant's fon at Lifbon, to accompany me, toge-
ther with two Etiglifh, and two I'onuguefe gentle-
men ; fo that with a Portuguefe fervant, an Englifh
faitor, and my man Friday, there were nine of us
•in number.
Thus armed and equipped; we fet out, and came
to Madrid, wheit the fummer decaying we hafted to
Navarre; where we were informed, that there was
Scarcely any paffing, by reafon of the prodigious
quantity of fnow; fo that we were obliged to abide
near twenty d'ays at Pampeluna, and at laft to take
a guide to conduct ns fafe towards Tholoufe. And
now twelve other-gentlemen joining with us, toge-
ther with their fervams, we had a Very jolly compa-
ny. Away our guide led us by the frightful moun-
tains, and through fo many intricate mazes and.
windings, that we infenfibly paffed them, which, as
we travelled along, nfhered us into the profpecT: of
the fruitful and -charming provinces of Languedoc
and Gafcogne.- • •-
But now came btttwb'adventures, 'both tragical
and comical. Firft, our guide was encountered by
three
three wolves and a bear, who fet upon him and hre
borfe, and wounded him in three places: upon which
i»y man riding up to his affiitance, fliot one of them
ikad upon the fpot, which made the others retire to
the woods. But the pleafanteft adventure was, to
behold my man attack the bear. 'Tis fuch a crea-
ture, that if you" let him alone, he will never meddle
with you: and this my man very well knew, and fo
begging leave of me in broken Englifh, he told us,
be would make good laugh. Why, you filly fool, faid
J, he'll eat you up at a mouthful. Eatee me up, re-
plied he, by way of fcorn, me not only eatee him,
but make much good laugh. Upon which, pulling off
Ii'is boots, he claps on his pumps, and running after
the monftrous beaft, he called out, that he wanted
to difcourfe with him; and then throwing ftones on
purpofe to incenfe him, the beaft turns about in fury
and with prodigious ftrides Ihuffles after him. But
though he was not (wift enough to keep up pace
with Friday, who made up to us as it were for help,
yet being angry, You dog, faid I, immediately take
fiorfe, and let ui Jboot the creature. But he cried,
Dear ma/ier, no Jboot, me make you laugh much. And
fo he turned about making figns to follow, while the
bear ran after him, till coming to a great oak, he
afcended in a minute, leaving his gun at the bottom
of it. Nor did the bear make any difficulty of it,
but afcended like a cat, though his weight was very
great. You muft confider I was not a little amazed
at the folly of my man, as not perceiving any thing
to occafion our laughter, till fuch time as we rode
vp nearer, and beheld the beaft mounted upon the
oak, on the beginning of the fame branch, fo which
Friday clung at the farther end, where the beardurft
not come. Hereupon Friday cried out, Nowmifter,
me make much laugh, me make de bear dance, Upon
•ivhich he'fcll a-fhaking the bough, which made the
.creature look behind him, to fee how he could re-
treat. Then, as if the bear had underAood his fram-
.. .1. mering

mering Englifh; Why you r.o come farther, Mr. Bear?
faid he, pray, Mr. Bear, come farther: and then in-
deed we all burft into laughter, efpecially when we
perceived Friday drop like a fquirrel upon (he ground
leaving the beaft to make the bef t of his way down
the tree. And now thinking it the moft convenient
time to (hoot the creature, Friday cried out, 0 dear
ina/ier, no Jboot, me Jboot by and by; when taking
up the gun, Me no Jboot yet, faid he, me make once
more much laugh. And accordingly he was as good
as his word; for the creature defcending backwards
from the tree very leifurely, before he could lay one
foot on the ground, Friday fhothim through the ear,
ftone dead; and looking to fee whether we were
pleafcd, he burft out into a hearty laughter, faying,
So we kill de bear in my country; not -with the gunt
but with much long arrows. Thus ended our diver-
fion. to our great faiisfaction; efpecially in a place
where the terrible bowlings ftruck us with a conti-
nual terror. But the fnows now-growing very deep,
particularly on the mountains, the ravenous crea-
tures were obliged to feek for fuftenance in the vil-
lages, where couaing by furprife on ihe country-
people, they killed ieveral of them, beiides a great
number of their (heep and horfes.
Our guide told us, we had yet one more danger-
ous place to pals by; and if there were any more
wolves in the country, there we fhould find them.
This was a fmall plain, encompafied with woods, to
get through a long lane, to the village where we
were to lodge. When we entered the wood, the fun
was within half an hour of fetting; and a little after
it was fct, we came into the plain, which was not
above two furlongs over, and then we perceived five
great wolves crofs the road, without taking notice
of us, and fo fwift .is though they were purloin,i af-
ter their prey. Hereupon our guide believing there
were more comii • -^fired us to be upon ou,r
guard. Accordingly our eyes were very circurnfpect,
tin
till about half a league farther, we perceived a dead
"horfe/and near a dozen of wolves devouring its car-
cafe. My man Friday fain would have fired at them,
but I would not permit him; nor had we gone hatf
over the plain, but we heard dreadful howlings in a
wood on our left, when prefently we faw an hun-
dred come up againft u$, as though they had been
an experienced army. This obliged us to form our-
felves in the beft manner; and then I ordered that
every other man fhould fire, that thofe who did not,
'might be ready to give a fecond volley, fhould they
"kdvarice upon tfs ;' and then every man fhould mukc
'iife of his piftols. But there was no neceffity for
'this; for the enemy being terrified, flopped at the
noife' of the fire; four of them were (hot dead,'and
-federal others freing wounded, 'went bleeding away,
as we could very plainly difcover by the fnow.
And now remembering what had been often told
me, that fuch was the majefty of a man's voice, as
to ftrike terror even into the fierceft creatures, I or-
dered all our companions to holloo as loud as pofll-
"ble: and in this notion I was not altogether mifta-
ken; for they immediately turned about upon the
-firft halloo, and began to retire; upon which, or-
dering a fecond volley in their rear, they gallopped
into the woods with great precipitation.
Thus we had fome fmall time to load our pieces
again, and then made all the hafte we could on our
way: but we had not rode far, before we were
obliged to put our/elves in a pofture of defence as
ibefore, being alarmed with a very dreadfiil noife in
the fame Wood, on our left hand, the fame"way as we
were to pafs, only that it was at (ome diftance from
-us. By this time the darkfome clouds began to
-f'pread over the elements, and the night grew-
"ing very duiky, made it i'o much the more to oifr
-difadvantag> .; but ftill the noife increafing, we were
-fully aflured, that it Was the howling and yelling
-.of tiibfe ravenous creatures; when prefently three
troops
Nitr OB
«, «c,
troops of wolves, on our front, appeared to out
fight, as though a great number of th<:m had adeiigu
lo furround us and devour us in (pile of fate. But
as they did not fall upon us immediately, we pro-
ceeded on our journey in as fwift a manner as the
roads would permit our horfes, which was only a
large trot. It was in this manner we travelled, till
fuch time as we difcovered another wood, and had
the prolptcl: of its entrance through which we were
to p.ifs, at the fartheft fide of the plain. But furely
none can exprefs the terror we were in, when ap-
proaching the lane, we perceived a confuted number
of the fierceft wolves ftanding, and as it were guard-
ing its entrance. Nor were we long in this amaze-
ment, before another occafion of horror prefented
itfelf; for fuddenly we heard the report of a gun at
another opening into the wood, and looking that
way, out ran a horfe bridled and faddled, flying
wi.h the greateft fwiftnefs, and no lefs than iixieen
or feventeen wolves puriuing after him, in order to
devour the poor creature: and unqueftionably they
did fo, after they had run him down, not being able
to hold out that fwiftnefs with which he at firft efca-
ped them.
When we rode up to that entrance from whence
the horfe came forth, there lay the carcafes of an-
other horfe and two men, mangled and torn by thefc
devouring wolves: and undoubtedly one of thefe men
was the perfon who fired the gun which we had
heard, for the piece lay by him 5 but alas! moft of
the upper part of his body and his head were en-
tombed in the bowels of thefe ravenous creatures.
What courfe to take, whether to proceed or re-
treat, we could not tell ; but it was not long before
the wolves themfelves made us come to a reiolution:
for fuch numbers furrounded us, every one of whom
expected their prey, that, were our bodies to be di-
vided among them, there would not be half a mouth-
ful a piece. But happy, very happy it was for us*
H that
that but a little way from the entrance, there lay
iome very large timber trees, which I fuppofed had
bcren cut down and laid there for fale; amongft
which I drew my little troop, placing ourfelves in
a line behind one long tree, which ferved us for a
bread work, when detiring them to alight, we flood
in a triangle, or three fronts, incloiing our horfes
in the centre, the only place-where we could preferve
them.
Never cer'ainly was there a more furious charge
than what the wolves made upon us in this place;
and the fight of the horfes, which was the principal
prey they aimed at, provoked their hunger, and ad-
ded to their natural fiercenefs. They came onus with a
moft dreadful nofe, that made the woods ring again;
and beginning to mount the pieces of timber, I or-
dered every other man to fire as before directed:
and indeed fo well did they take their aim, that they
killed feveral of the wolves at the firft volley; but
(till we were obliged to keep a continual firing, by
reafon they came on like devils, pufhing one ano-
ther with the greateft fury. But our fecond volley
Ibmcthing abated iheir courage, when flopping a lit-
:Ie, we hoped they would have made the beft of
:heir way; however it did not prove fo, for others
uade a new attempt upon us: and though in four
irings we killed feventeen or eighteen of them, la-
ning twice as many, yet they feveral times fuccef-
Ively came on, as though they valued not their lives
"or the fake of their prey.
Unwilling was I to fpend our laft fhottoo fudden-
y-, and therefore called my other fervant, and giving
iim a horn of powder, bid him lay a large train
[uire along the timber, which he did, while Friday
iras charging my fufee and his own, with thcgreateft
|exterity. By this time the wolves coming up the
imber, I fet fire to the train, by fuapping a dif-
barged piftoi clofe on the powder. This fo fcorch-
(J and terrified them, that fome fell down, and

others jumped in among us ; but thefc we imme-
diately difpatched, when all the reft, frighted with
the Hght, which the darkfome night caufed to appear
more dreadful, began at length to retire; Upon
which, ordering our laft piftols to be fired at once,
giving at the fame time a great fhout, the wolves
were obliged to have recourfe to their fwiftnefs, and
turn .tail; and then we fallied put upon twenty
lame ones, cutting them in pieces with our fwords,
which obliged them to howl lamentably, to the ter-
ror of their fellows, who refigned to us the field as
victorious conquerors. And indeed I queftion whe-
ther Alexander king of Macedonia, in any of his
conqueits, had more occafion for triumph than we
had: for he was but attacked by numerous armies
of foldiers; whereas our little army was obliged to
combat a legipn of devils, as it w€re, vrorfe than the
cannibals, who the fame moment, had they flain us,
would have facriikd us, to fatisfy their voracious
appetites, i
Thus ended our bloody battle with the beafts, ha-
ving killed threefcore of them, and faved our lives
from their fury. We ftiil had a league farther to go,
when, arwe wenti- our ears were faluted with their
moft unwelcome howlings, and we expected every
moment another attack. But in an hour's-time we
arrived at the town where we were to lodge; and
here we found the place ftdtftly guarded, and all in
terrible confufion, as well they might, for fear of
the bears and wolves breaking into the village, in
order to prey upon their cattle and people. The
next morning we were obliged to take a new guide,
by reafon the other fell very bad of his wounds,
which he had received, as before mentioned. After
we had reached Thoulonfe, we came into a warm,
pleafant, and fruitful country, not infefted with
wolves, nor any fort of ravenous creatures: and
when we told our ftory there, they much blamed our
guide, for conducting us through the foreft at the
H 2 foot
foot of the mountains, in fuch a fevere feafon, when
the fnow obliged the wolves to ftek for fhdttr in the
«voods. When we informed them in what manner
we placed ourfelves, and thehorfet in the centre, they
exceedingly reprehended us, and told us, it was ail
hundred to one, but we had all been deilroyed; for
that it was the very light of the horfes, their fo much
defired prey, that made the wolves more ragingly
furious than they would have been, which was evi-
dent, by their being at other times really afraid of a
gun ) but then being exceeding hungry, and furious
aipon that account, thtir eagernefs to come at the
liorfes made them infenfible of their danger; and
that if we had not by a continual fire, and at laft
tiy the cunning ftratagem of the train of powder,
got the better of them, it had been great odds if
their number had not overpowered us, befide?, it was
a great mercy we alighted from our horfes, and
fought them with that courage and conduct, which
had we failed to do, every man of us, with our
t>eaits, had been devoured: and indeed this was no-
thing but truth; for never in my life was I fo fenfible
of danger, as when three hundred devils came roar-
ing upon us, to fhun whofe unwelcome company,
if I was fure to meet a ftorm every week, 1 would
yather go a thoufand leagues by fea.
1 think 1 have nothing uncommon in my paflage
through France to take notice of, fince other travel-
lers of greater learning and ingenuity, have given a
iTiore ampk account than my pen is able to fet forth.
prom Thoukmfe I travelled to Paris, from thence to
Calais, where I took fhipping, and landed at Dover
Jie i ath of January, in a very cold feafon.
Thus come to the end of my travels, I foon dif-
covered 'my new found eftate, and all the bills of
exchange 1 had brought were currently paid. The
good ancient widow, my only privy counfelIor,
thought no pains nor care too gieat to procure my
advantage; nor had
I ever occafion to blame her
fidelity,
^fidelity, which drew from me an ample reward. I
was for leaving my effects in her hands, intending
to fee ouc for Liftion, and fo to th^ Brazils; but as iu
the DefoLite I/land 1 had fome doubts about the Ro-
milh religion, fo I knew there was little encourage-
ment to fettle there unlefs I would apoftatize from the
orthodox faith, or live in continual fear of the in-
quitition. . 17pop this. account I refolved to fell my
plantation; and for that intent I wrote to my old
friend at Liibon, who returned me an anfwer to my
great faiisfa&ion; which was, that lie could fell it
to good account: however, if I thought it conveni-
ent to give him liberty to offer it in my name to the
two merchants, the furvivors of my truftees refidinij
at the Brazils, who confequently underftood its in-
trinfic value, having lived juft upon the fpot, and
who I was fenfible were very rich, and therefore
might be the more witling to purchafe it; he did
not in the leafl doubt, but that I fhould make fouir
or five thoufand pieces of eight more of it, than I
could do, if I diipofod of it in. any other manner
whatfoever. .. . , .v:.„«
You may be furc I could not bi*t a-grac with th:*-
kind and ingenuous propofal; and immediately L
Cent hint an order to offer it tp them, which he ac-
cordingly did: fo that, about eight months after, the
/hip being in that time returned, he gave me a fatif-
factory account, that they not only willingly accept-
ed the offer, but that they had alfo remitted 33,003
pieces of eight to a correfpondent of their own at
Liibon, in order to pay for the purchase.
Hereupon in return I figned the inftrument of fa-Ie
according to form, which they had fent from Lifbon,
and returned it again to my eld friend, he having
Cent me for my eftate, bills of three hundred twenty-
eight thoufand pieces. of eight, referving the payment
of one hundred moidores per annum,. which I had:-
allowed him during life, likewife fifty to his fon during

And thus having led my reader to the knowledge
of the firft part of my life, fo remarkable for the
many peculiar providences that attended it, floating
in-an ocean of uncertainty and tfifappointinent, of

ending happily; methkiks now that I am come to a
iafe and plcafant haven, it is time to caft out my an-
chor, and laying up my veffel, bid for a while adieu
to foreign adventures. I had no other concerns to
look after, but the care of my brother's two fons,
which, with ihe good widow's perfnafions, obliged
me to continue at home feven years. One of thefe
children I bred up a gentleman, and the other aa
experienced toiler, remarkable for his courage and
bravery. Balk.'es this, 1 married a virtuous young
gentlewoman, of a very good family, by whom I had
two fons and one daughter. But my dear and ten-
Jer wife leaving this earthly ftage, (as in the feeondt
part of my life you will frear)f which rent my fouhas
it were afunder,- my native country became weary
and tirefome to me : and my nephew happening to
c cmie from ihe fea, tempted me to venture another
voyage to the E.-ift Indies, which I did in the year

the wonderful and fuccefsful battles over the Indians,
who invaded, and thought to have conquered the

and br.ivery, having taken eleven men and five wo-

twenty young children on my little kingdom. Here 1
ftaid twenty days, left them fupplies of all necellary

TT7-HEN- we confider the puiffant force of na-
* * ture, and what mighty influence it has ma--
ny times over the temper of the min-d, it will be
no fuch great wonder to think, that my powerful
peafou fhould be overcome by a much ftronger in-
clination. My late acquired kingdom ran con-
tinually in. my thoughts all the day, and I dreamed
H 4 of
of it in the night; nay, I made it the continual fub-
jsct of my talk, tven to impertinence, when I was
awake. 1 had luch vapours in my head, that 1 ac-
tually fuppofed myfelf at my caftle; that 1 not only
perceived Friday's father, the old Spaniard, and
the wicked failors, but that I talked and difcourfed
with them about their manner of living; that I heard
thefe things related to me, which 1 found afterwards
to be but too true: and that I executed my judg-
tnents with the greateft feverity upon the offenders.
.And indeed, this anticipating all the pleafing joys of
iny life, fcarcely afforded me one pleafant hour: my
tlear and tender wife could not but take notice of it,
which drew thefe affecYionate fpeeches from her:
J\4y dear, faid fhe, Iain really pcrfuadtd that fame fe-
ffet impulfe from heaven occafions in you a determination
fg fee the ijiand again: nor am 1 lefs fenfihlt, but your
fieing engagfd ti me, and thefe dear children, is the only
f,',nderiiiice of your departure. I know, my dear, if I
•ii'it* in the grave, you -would not long continue at home t
prevent r.ot your bappintfs upon my account, -whofe only
^•ynifcrt centers in you. All that I can objecl if that
fycb on hazardous undertaking is no -way confident
-.uith a per fan cf your years; but if you an rejolved to
irQ, added fhe, weeping, only permit me to bear •lou
fOflipaiiy, and that is all that I defire.
'.Such endearing tendernefs, graced with the moft
i^nocenr, and yet moft powerful charms, brought
1ie infenfibly into my right underftanding; and when
I confidered all the tranfactions of my life and par-
icu'^'ly my new engagement; that I had now one
ftltd already born, and my wife big of another; and
i.at 1 had no occasion to feek for more riches, who
- 1 ready was blefled with fufficiency, with much
'lrogg!ing I altered my refolutions at laft, refolving
to app'y myfelf to fame bufinefs or other, which
ir)ight put a period to fuch wandering inclinations.
j.jereupon 1 bought a little farm in the county of
"""-' with a resolution to move thither: upon
this there was a pretty convenient houfe, furroundfcd
with land, very capable of improvement, which iuit-
ed my temper as to planting, managing and culti-
vating. Ntor was I long before I entered upon--my
new iettlemem, having bought ploughs, harrows,
cam, waggons, horfes, cows, and fh-eep; fo that!
now led the life Ot a country gentleman, and as.
happy in my retirement as the greateft monarch in
the world. And what made me think my happi-
nefs the greater,. was, that I was in that middle iiate
*f ltfey which my father had fo often recommended.,
much refembling the felicity of a rural retirement,.
which is elegantly defcribed by the poet in tads
lines:
r- a •' f s '--J " u '-i • '''
Frcr from all vitft, free from e<z«y .r ,- . ...,
ilge has no pain, and youth. HO. fnare. ,',
Bet, in the miclft of this my happinefs, I'was fud-
detily plunged into the greateft forrow that 1 could
poflibly endure: for, when !• leaft expected it, my
dear and tender wife was forced to fwbmirto the ir-
reiiilblc power »f death, leaving this- tranfitory life
for a better. It is impoffible for me to e&preis tli«
beauties of her mind, or the lovelinefs of her perfon 5
neither can-I too much-lament her lofs, which my
latf It breath fhall record: her influence was greater
ovtr ma, than the powers of my own reafoni the im-
portunities of friends, the inftrucbiofl*of a father, oc
the melting tears of a tender and difconfolate mo-
ther: in a. word, fhe was the fpirit of all my. affairs,
and the center of my enterprifes. But now, fince
the cruel hand of death had clofed my dear eft's eyes,.
I ieerned in my thoughts a ftrang^er to the world ; my
privy. counfellor being gone, f was-iike a &ip with-
aut a pilot, that could only run before the wind..
And when I looked around. rfie in this bufy world,.
one part labouring tor breSd, and the other fquander—
ing away iheireftates; this put me in mind how I had
in my liule kingdom, where both reafon audf
H 5 religion-
religion dictated to me, tha there was fomething
that certainly was the reaf'oo and end of life, which
was far fuperior to what could be hoped for on this
fide the grave. My country delights were now as
infipid and dull, as mulk or fcience to thofe who
have neither tafte nor ingenuity. In fhorf, refol-
ding to leave offhoufe-keeping, 1 left my farm, and
in a few.'months returned to London. .>i
But neither could that great city, fo famous for
its vaiiety of entertainment, afford me any agreeable
delight; a ftate of idlenefs 1 found to be the very
dregs of life, and moft hurtful 10 bcdy and loul. It
v as now the beginning of the year 1694, at which
time my nephew (who, as i before obferved, had
been brought up to the iea, and advanced to be cap-
tain of a fhip) was returned from a Ihort voyage
to Bilboa, the firft he had made in that ftation. He
comes to me one morning, telling me, that fome
merchants of his acquaintance had propofed to him
to go a voyage for them, to the Eaft Indies and Chi-
na, in the manner of private traders: and now, wi-
de, (aid he, 'f you'll accompany me thither, I'd engage
to lanti you upon your otdifland, to vifit thejlateof ywr
little kingdom.
Juit before he came in, my thoughts were fixed
to get a patent for its poffeffion, and then to fill it
with inhabitants. After I had paufed a little while,
and looked ftedfaftly on him, What devil, or ffirit,
faid I, ient yon with this unlucky errands' He ftarted
at firft; -but recovering himfelf, when he perceived
1 was not offended; Sir, replied he, what I have
propofed cannot, 1 hope be, ftyled unlucky, Cnce
certainly you muft be defirous to lee your little ter-
ritory, 'where you reigned with more content than
any of your brother- kings in the univerfe, nephew,
faid I, if you will leave me there, and call for me as
you come back, I care not if 1 give my confcnt:
but he anfwered, that the merchants would not al-
low their veffel, loaden with an infinite value, to re-
turn
again,
^ op as before
«of reafon io ii -
e| fa was, to ca
turn there again, which was a month's fail out of
the way : befides, Sir, faid he, if I fhould mifcarry,
was your requeft gran:ed, why then you would be
locked up as before. This indeed carried a great
deal of reafon in it; but we found out a remedy,
and that was, to carry a framed floop on board,
ready to be fet up in the ifhnd. by the affiftance of
fome carpenters, which we fhould carry with us,
that might be fitted in a few days- to go to fea. i
was not long in formingrmy refolution, which over-
fwayed my good friend the widow's perfuafions, and
the natural affe&ion I bore -to my young children. I-
ntade my will; and fettled my eftate in inch a man-
ner, that I was perfectly- fure that my poor infants:
would have julUce done them. The good widow
not only undertook to make provifion for my voy--
age, but alfo took-the charge of my domeftic affair?, -
and to provide.for-oiy-children's education; and in-"
<teed no moi her could take more care, or underftood'
that office- better; for which 1 lived to reward, ai;d
return her my hearty thanks.
The beginning of January 1694-5, my nephewl'
being ready to fail, I and Friday went on board in
the Downs on the 8th, having, betide that floop al-
ready mentioned, a very confiderable cargoe for n•'y
new colony. Firft, I had fome fcrvants, whom 1 pro-
pofed to leave there as inhabitants, 01 to work while-
I ftaid there, as they ftiould appear willing: there;
were two carpsnters, a-fmitb, and a very ingenious
fellow who was Jack of all trades; -for he was not ou--
ly a cooper by trade, but allo he was dexterous at
making wheels and hatid-mills to grind corn, likewife
a- good turner,. and a good pot-maker. - 1 alfo can i-
ed a taylor, who contented to ftay in-my plantation,'
and proved a.moft neceflkry fellow in the iflanu.
As to nay tar go, it coniifted of a fufficient ciuamity
of linen, and Englifh fluffs, for tloathing the Spa-
niards that'I expe&ed to find there; as likewiie
gloves, hat*, fhoes, ftock-ings; together with beds,
H 6 bedding.;
WROB
bedding, and houfchold fluff, efpecially kitchen oten-
lils, with pots, kettles, pewter, brafs, &c. alfo nails-
tools of all Ions, ftaples, hooks, hinges, and all o-
iher things nectflaiy; all which, 1 think, coft mea-
bout three hundred pounds. Nor was this all; for
I carried an hundred fpare arms, mufltets, and fu-
fees, befides fome piftols, a confiderable quantity of
feveral fons of fhot, two brafs cannon, beiides
fwords, cutlaiTes, and the iron part for forae pikes
and halbcrts. I made my nephew take with us two
fimll qu.mer-deck guns, more than he had occafion
for in his (hip, to leave behind, if there was a necef-
iiiv; that fo we might build a fort there, and man it
tigainft all oppofers whatfoever.
W( II, we put out to fea; and though I can't fay
this voyage was fo unprofperous as my others had
|teen, yet contrary winds drove us fo far northward,
that we were obiiged to put in at Galway in Ireland,
we lay windbound two and twenty days. Here
our provi(ions were very cheap, and we ad-
to our fhip's ftores, by taking in feveral live
io^s, two cows and calves, which I then refolved to
put on fliore in my illand, if our neceffities did not
cal\ for them. On the 5th of February we failed
Ireland, with a very fair .gale, which lafted for
days; and I think it was about the 20th of
t^e fame month, late in the evening, when the autc
inforrned us, that he faw a flalh of fire, and heard
^ gun fired; and when he was fpeaking, a boy came
jf,, and .old us, that the boatfwain had heard ano-
Upon which we all ran to the quarter-deck,
whence in a few moments we perceived a ter-
r fire at a diftiincc. We had immediately re-
c0urfe to our reckonings, in which we were all of o-
iiriion, that thei t could be no land that way, it ap-
pearing to" be at N N. W. Hereupon we con-
*^luded that foine (hip had uken fire at fea, and that
t coukl not be far off, by the report cf the guns
we had heard. We mads up directly to it,

and in half an hour's time, the wind being fair, we
could plainly perceive a great (hip on fire in the
middle of the fca. Touched with this unhappy
difafter, and confidering my former circumftances,
when ihe Portuguefe captain took me up, I imme-
diately ordered five guns to be fired, that the poor
creatures, not feeing us, it being dark, (though we
could perceive their flame), might be fenfible there
was deliverance at hand, and confequently might en-
deavour to fave themfelves in their boat. Nor was
it long before the (hip blew up in the air, and the
fire was extinguifhed in the ocean. But fuppofing
them all to be in their boats, we hung out our lan-
terns, and kept firing till eight o'clock in the morn-
ing; when, with our perfpe&ives, we beheld two
boats, full of people, making towards us, though
the tide was againft them; then fpreadmg out our
ancient, and hanging out a waft, as a fignal for them
to come on board, in half an hour's time, we came
up to them, and took them all in, there being no
lefs than fixty four men, women, and children. It
was a French merchant (hip of 300 tons, homeward
bound from Quebec in the river of Canada. The ma-
fter informed me how, by the negligence of the fteerf.
man, the fteerage was fet on fire; that, at his o«-
cry for -help, the fire was, as they thought, totally
extinguifhcd; but that fome fparks getting becween
the timber, and within the ceiling, it proceeded into
the hold, where there was no relifting it; that then
they got into their boats, as creatures in the laft
extremity, with what proviiion they had, together
with oars, fails, and a compafs, intending to go back
to Newfoundland, the wind blowing at t>. E. and by
E. though there were feveral chances againft them,
as ftorms to overfet and founder them, rains and colds
to benumb and perifh their limbs, and contrary winds
to keep them back and ftarve them: but, (aid he>
in this our great diftrefs, we heard the welcome re-
port of your guns, when, with unfpeakable joy, ta*
king

lie by till morning; but perceiving your light, we
fet our oars at work to keep our bo^t a head, the
fooner to attain your fhip> the happy ihftrument of
our deliverance.
Indeed no one can exprefe the joy of thefe poof-
creatures on this occafion: fear and grief are eafilf
fet foith; figlis and tears, with a few motions of"
the hands and head, are all the demonftrations of
thefe pafllons: but an exctfs of joy carries in it a'
thoufand extravagances ; efpecially, I think, amongft
the French, whole temper is allowed to be more vo-
latile, pafiion:ue, fprightly, and gay than that of o-
ther nations, fyome were weeping, tearing them--
fclves in the greateft agonies of forraw, and running
/lark mad about ihe fhip ; while the reft were (hmp«
ing wiih their feet, wringing their hands, finging,
laughing, (wooning away, vomiting, fainting, with a
few returning hearty thanks to the Almighty, and
eroffing themt'elves. I think, if I am not miftaken,
our furgeon was obliged to let thirty of them blood;
Jlut among the pafiengers, there were two-priefts,
the one an old, and the other a young man; but
at amazed me more, was, that the oldeft was i«
worft plight: for no fooner did he perceive him-
freed from danger, but he dropt down, as it were-
^-ithout life, and, to every one's appearance, quite

fwoon, and fo ran to help him up; but he modeftly
told me, he was returning his 'hanks to the Al-
mighty, defiiing me to leave him a few moments,
and that, next to his Creator, he would return me
thanks alfo. And indeed he' did fo, about three
minutes after, with great fei ioufnefs and affection,
while the tears flood in his eyes, which convinced
me of the gratitude of his foul. Nor did he Ids (hew
his piety and wifdom, in applying Limfeli 10 his
country people, and labouring to compofe them, by
the moft powerful reafons, arguments, and perfua-
fions. And when, indeed, thefe people had taken
their night's repofe, in fuch lodgings as our fhip
would allow, we found nothing but the beft of
manners, and the moil civil acknowledgements, for
which the French-are eminently remarkable. The
next day the captain, and one of the priefts, dcfircd
to fpeak with me, and my nephew, the commander.
They told us, that they had faved fome money, and
valuable things out of the ruined vefiel, which was
at our fervice; only that they dcfircd to be fet on
fliore fome where in our way. At the firft my ne-
phew was for accepting the money; but 1 (who
knew how hard my cafe would have been, had the
Portuguefe captain ferved me fo'i perfuaded him to
the contrary; and therefore told them, that as we
had done nothing but what we were obliged to do,
by nature and humanity, and what we ourlelves
might expect from others in fuch calamity; fo we
took them up to fave them, not to plunder them, or
leave them naked upon the land, to perifh for want
of lubfiftence, and therefore would not accept their
money: but as to landing them, that was a great
difficulty; for, being bound to the Eaft-Indies, it
was impoffible wilfully to change our vol age upon
their particular account, nor could my nephew (who
was under charter-party to purfue it by way of Brazil)

-anfwcr it to the freighters. All that we could do, was
to put ourfelves in fhe way of meeting feme ftiips
Jiomeward bound from the Weft Indies, that if pol-
fible they might get a paflage to France or England.
Indeed they were very hankful for our firft kind-
iie's; but were under great concern, efpecially the
p.ifftngers, at their being carried to the Eall Indiesv
"Xbey begged therefore I would keep on the banks
o f Newfoundland, where probably they might meet
ivi'h fome fhip or floop to carry them to Canada,
^vhence they came. As this was but a realbnable
g-equeft, I was inclined to grant it, fince it was no
tn-e;ich of charter-party, and that the laws of God
3nd nature obliged us to do what good we could to
O\if fellow creatures; and beiides, the danger we
^urfelves fhould be in for want of provifions: fo we
cOrifented to carry them to Newfoundland, if wind
ffftd weather would permit; if not, that we fhould
£»rrf them to Martinico in the Weft Indies. But as-
,f happened, in a week's time, we made the banks of
«,jevvfiiundland, where the French people hired a.
jjgi-k to carry them to France. But the young prieft
defirous to go to the Eaft Indies, I readily a-
to it, becaufe I liked his converfation, and

with, but the main courfe, and a kind of fquarc fail
upon a jury foremaft, becaofe they could not come
near the land, were endeavouring to (land for the
Canaries; nay, what was worfe, befiJes all their fa-
tigue, they weie almofl ftarved for want of provifi-
oii, having ate nothing for eleven days, all that they
had aboard was fugar, a barrel of frefh water, and
feven calks of rum. In this fhip were three paflen-
gers, a youth, his mother, and a maid fervant, who
were in a moft deplorable condition for want of food.
If I had not gone on board their fhip, the knowledge
of their mifery had been concealed from me, and they
would have inevitably periihed, though indeed their
fecond mate (who was captain, by reafon the true
captain was not on board when the hurricane hap-
pened) had before informed me that there were fuch
perfons on board, whom he fuppofed to be dead, be-
ing afraid to enquire after them, becaufe he had no-
thing to give them for relief. Hereupon we refolved
to let them have what we could fpare, ordering the
mate to bring fome of his men on board us, which
he did accordingly; as he and they looked like Ike-
letons, when meat was fet before them, I ordered
them to eat fparingly. But, however, they foon fell
fick ; which obliged the furgeon to mix fomething in
their broth, which was to be to them both food and
phyfic. When they were fed, we ordered our mate
to carry them a fack of bread, and four or five.
pieces of beef; but the furgeon charged them to fee.
it boiled, and to keep a guard on the cook room, to
prevent the men from eating it raw, and confequent-
ly killing themfelves with what was defigned for
their relief. But particularly I defired the mate to
fee what condition the poor paflengers were in, and
the furgeon gave him a pitcher of the fame broth.

the failors, (not fparing a fmall fufttnance) had ftar-
ved his mother. But hunger has no bounds, no
right, and confequentl'y is incapable of any compaf-
iion. When the furgeon told him, 'that our voyage
might put him in bad circumftances, and farther
from his friends; he anfwered, he did not care, fo
he was delivered from that terrible crew: that as the
captain (meaning me) had faved him from death, fo
he was fure he would do him no harm; and as for
the maid, when (he was reftore'd to her fenfes, fhe
would be no lefs thankful, iet us carry them where
we would. A«d indeed ihe furgeon fo reprefente'd
their caie to me, that I consented, and took ihemori

of fugar; but theyouth having a bill of lading, I
made the commander oblige himfelf to deliver a letter

OF ROB
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
afterwards. We were now in the latitude of Ij)
deg. 32 min. having as yet a tolerable good voyage,
But, puffing by feveral little incidents relating to
wind and svtather, I fhall relate what is moft re-
lnarkable concerning my little kingdom to which I
was then drawing near. 1 had great difficulty in
finding it; for as I came to, and went from it before,
on the fouth and eaft fide of the illand, as coming
from the Brazils; fo RoW approaching between the
plain and the ifland, not having any chart fur die
coaft, nor land-mark, it obliged us to go on fhore
feveral iflands on the mouth of the river Uroonokoi
but to no purpofe. This I perceived, that what I
thought was a continent before, was no fuch thing,
but a long ifland, or rather a ridge of finds. On
one of thefe iflands I found fome Spaniards, but they
belonged to the Ifie de Trinidad, who came hither
in a floop to make fait, and to try to find fome pearl
mufles. But at length I came fair on the fouth-lide
of my ifland, and then 1 prefently knew the counte-
nance of my little kingdom, fo we brought the (hip
fafe to an anchor, broadfide within the little creek,
where flood my ancient and venerable caftle.

then fell a dancing and capering as if he was mad,
and 1 had much ado to keep him from jumping into
the fea, to fwim afhore. Friday, faid I, what do you
think, fhall we go fee your father? At the men-
tioning his father's name, the poor affectionate crea-
ture fell a weeping: No, no, fays he, me fee hlmni

there f whicl\, though I could not perceive them with
my perfpecUve glafs, was true, by wbat the men
themfelves told me the next day.
When the hnglifh ancient was fpread, and three
guns fired as a fignal of friendfhip, we perceived a
Imoke rife from the creek; upon which I ordered
the boat out, taking Friday with me,, and hanging
out a white flag of truce, I went on fhore, accom-
panied alfo by the young friar, to whom I had re-
lated the hiftory of the firft part of my life: befides^
we had fixteen men well armed, in cafe we had met
with any oppofition.
After we had rowed diredUy into the creek, the
firft man I fixed my eye upon, was the Spaniard,
whofe life 1 had faved, and whofe face I perfectly
well knew. I ordered them all to ftay in the boat
for a while; but Friday perceiving his father at a
diftance, would have jumped into the fea, had they
not let the boat go. No fooner was he on fhore,
but he flew like a fwift arrow out of a bow, to em-
brace his aged father. Certainly it would melt a
man of the firmeft refolution, into the fofteft tears,
to fee with what uncommon tranfports of joy he fa-
luted him: he firft kifled him, then ftrokcd his face,
took him in his arms, laid him under a fhady tree,
fat down by him, then looked as earneft at him, as
one would do at a picture, for a quarter of an hour
together. After this, he would lie upon the ground,
ftroke his legs, and kifs them, then get up and flare
at .him, as though he was bewitched: but the next
day one could not forbear laughter to fee his behavi-
our, for he wo»ld walk feveral hours with his father
along the fhore, leading him by the hand, as though
he was a lady; while, every now and then he would
run to the boat, to get (bmething for him, as a
lump of fugar, dram, bifcuit, or fomething or other
that was good. His frolies ran in another channel
in the afternoon; for when he fet old Friday on the
ground, he would dance round him, making comi-
cal
1
cal poftures and gtftures: and all this while would • & me one by on<
be telling him one ftory or other of his travels and "''"
adventures.
It was on the loth of April, anno 1695. thatlfet 0-,llua t
my foot upon the ifland a fecond time. When my "^e time was f
faithful Spaniard, accompanied by one more, ap- ^'inirable to t
preached the boat, he little knew who I was, till I fee 1 rel^ .1.
difcovered myfelf to him: Seignior, faid I, in For- ^kingdom, ,s \ \
tuguefe, don't you know me ? he fpoke never a word, 'iiiili, ] mu'^ •
but giving his mufket to his attendant, extended his Sitlitinn fl"
arms, and faying fomething in Spaniih, that I did not
then underftand, he came forward, and embraced
me, faying, he was inexcufable, not to know his de-
liverer; who, like an angel lent from heaven, had „, laiu]
favtd his life. He then beckoned to the man to call k.^ ^ *°
Out his companions, alking me, if I would walk to ""td'unUr
rny own habitation, and take pofleffion, where I MialWi ^t^
Should find fome mean improvements: but indeed !ii*(».L. ll fa
they were extraordinary ones; for they had planted
fo many trees fo clofe together, that the place was
like a labyrinth, which none could find out, except
thcmfelves, who knew its intricate windings. I afk-
ed him the meaning' of all thefe fortifications; he
told me he would give me a large account of what
had palled fince my departure to this time and how 1 l(*:'s«0rt ;- "i
he had fubdued fome Englifh, who thought to be ^u*^ r>
their murderers, hoping I would not be dilpiealed, ^*hich I,?*^
fince neceffity compelled them to it. As I knew
they were wicked villains, fo I told him, that I was
riot only far from finding fault with it, but was ra- -'"Dm
tber heartily glad that they had fubdued them. tetn, a ^ v^A
"While we were thus talking, the ma$ whom he had I it^/ *«,:
ient returned, accompanied by eleven more, but in
fuch habits, that it was impoffible to tell what na-
tions they were of. He firit turned to me, and
pointing to them; Thefe, bir, faid he, are fome of
the gentlemen who owe their lives to your goodncfs; ^'fou''*
then turning to them, and pointing to me, be made ^notn'
them fenfible who I was: and then indeed they fa-
luted
luted me one by one; not as ordinary men, but as
though they had been ambafladors of noblemen, and
I a triumphant conqueror; for their behaviour not
only agreed with a manlike, majeftic gravity, but at
the fame time was fo obliging and courteous, as made
them admirable to the laft degree.
Before I relate the hiftory of the tranfailions of
my kingdom, as I had it from the Spaniard's own
mouth, 1 muft here infert what 1 omitted in my for-
mer relation. The matter is thus: Juft before we
weighed anchoi; to fet fail, there happened a quarrel
on board the fhip, which had like to have occdfioned
a fecond mutiny, till fuch time as the courageous cap-
tain, taking two of the moft refractory prifoners,
laid them in irons, threatening, as they were con-
cerned in the former diforders, to have them hang-
ed in England for running away with the fhip.
This frightened fome of the reft, as thinking the cap-
tain would ferve them in the fame manner, though
he feemed to give them good words for the prefent.
But the mate having intelligence of this, made me
acquainted with their fears: fo that, to make them
more eafy, and ourfelves more fafe from their con-
fpiracies, 1 was obliged to go down, and pafs my Ho-
nour's word for it, that, upon their good behaviour,
all that was paft fhould be pardoned; in teftimony -
of which I ordered the two men's irons to be taken
off, and themfelves forgiven. But as this had brought
us to an anchor that night, in which there was a calm
the two men that had been in irons, ftole each of
them a muiket, and fome other weapons, and taking
the (hip's pinnace, not yet hauled up, ran away to
their brother rogues. 1 he next morning we fent
the long-boat, with men to purfue them i but all in
vain; the inaie, in revenge, would have demolifhed
my little caitle, burnt its furniture, and tieftroyed
their plantations; but having no orders for it, he
did not put u in execution. And thus there were five
Engli(hmen in the ifland, which caufed great differ-
ences
OF R01
ences, as my faithful Spaniard gave me a perfect ac-
count of, in the following manner:
You cannot Sir, but remember the embafiy you
fent me about, and what a difappointment we met
With, by your abfence, at our return. Ihereisbut
little varifty in the relation of our voyage, being
bl .'lTed with calm weather, and a fmooth fea. Grtat
indeed was the joy of my countrymen, to fee me
alive, having adted as the principal man on board,
the captain of the (hipwrecked veffel dying before;
nor was their furprife kfs, as knowing I was taken
prifoner by the favages of another nation, theii
thought me long fince entombed in their monftrous
bowels. But when 1 fhewed them the arms, ammu-
nition, and provifions I had brought for them, they
looked upon me as a fecond Jofeph advanced in
Pharaoh's court, and immediately prepared to come
along with me. Indeed they were obliged to trelpafs
upon their friendly favages, by borrowing two of
their canoe?, under a pretext for fifhing: and they
came away the next morning, but without any pro-
vifions of their own, except a few roots, which
ferved them inftead of bread. After three weeks
abfence, we arrived at your habitation. Here we
met with three Englifh failors, who, I confefs, gave
us provifions, and that letter of directions you had
left for us, which informed us how to bring up tame
goats, plant corn, cure grapes, make pots; and in
fhort, every thing that was neceflary for our ufe;
as, in particular, 1 knew your method beft, fo taking
Friday's father to afllft me, we managed all the af-
fairs; nor were the reft of the Spaniards wanting in.
their kind offices, drcfiing food for the Englifhmen,
who did nothing but ramble and divert themfelvesm
the -woods, either fhooting parrots, or catching tortoi-
fes. But we had not been long afhore, before we were
informed of two more Englifhmen, unnaturally turn-
ed out of their common place of refidence by the
three others above mentioned: this made my Spa-
niard*
s and
me
'm to iaki
ft family; but a|
wfe poor fcH(
"wotiadoftry, i
•. and the
!?N natured 1
- nd
niards and me (whom they now looked upon as
their governor in your abfence) endeavour to per-
fuade them to iake them in, that we might be as
one family; but all our entreaties were in vain, fo
that the poor fellows, finding nothing to be done
without indufkry, pitched their tents on the north
fide of the ifland, a lictle inclining to the weft, for
fear of favages. Here they built two huts, one
to lodge, and the other to lay their ftores in; for
my good natured Spaniards giving them fome feeds,
they dug and planted as 1 had done, and began to
live prettily. But while they were thus comfortably
going on, the three unnatural brutes, their country-
men, in a mere bullying humour, infhhed them,
by faying, the governor (meaning you) had given
them pofleffion of the ifland, and d—mn 'em, they
fhould build no houfe« upon their ground, without
paying rent. The two honeft men (for fo let me
now diftinguifh them) thought their three country-
men only jefted, and one of them invited them in,
to fee their fine habitations; while the other face-
tioufly told them, that fince they built tenements,
with great improvements, they fhould, according to
the cuftom of landlords, grve them a longer leafe;
at the fame time defiring them to fetch a fcrivener
to draw the writings. One of the wretches fwear-
ing he fhould pay for the jeft, (hatches up a fire-
brand, and clapping it to the outfide of their hut,
•very fairly fet it on fire, which would foon have con-
fumed it, had not the honeft man thruft him away,
and trod it out with his feet. Hereupon the fellow
returns with a pole, with which he would have
ended his days, had not the poor man avoided the
blow; when fetching his mufket, he knocked down
the villain that began th^ quarrel. The other two
coming to afiaft their fellow, obliged the honeft man
to take his mufket alfo, and botn of them prefenting
their pieces, bid the villains ftand off; and if they
did not lay down their arms, death fhould decide the
I difpute
•
-difpute one way or other. This brought them to a
parity, .,„ which they agreed to take their wounded £'"'
•nan and be gone; but they were in the wrong that 2' J
they d.d not diiarm them when they had the power,
and then make their complaint to me and my Spa- ,^
niards for juftice, which might have prevented their L g;n
farther defigns again ft them. And indeed fo many ." T* .
trefpaffes did they afterwards commit, by treading , . s J
down their corn, fhooting their young kids and L '1D
goats, and plaguing them night and day, that i,mi
they refolved to come to my caftle, challenge all *"COndu(
the three, and decide their right b one lain bat- •Ttice'
D
ght by one plain bat-
-tic, while the ^.paniards Wood by to fee fair play.
One day ir happened, that two of my Spaniards (one JJ|D,ot
of whom uhdcrftood Englifh) being in the woods, ..I ,OWn
were met by one of the honeft men, who complain- '"i! i^0'
ed how barbarous their countrymen had. been in -^ , irl
.deftroying their corn, killing tht'ir milch-goat, and SsLr'1"
-three kids, which deprived them of their iubfiftencei k| Cm
that if we did not grant them relief, they muft be ik ^ett
inevitably ftarved: and fo they parted; but when LL nd
tny Spaniards came home at night, and fiipper being ;,. "eri 1
on the table, one of them began 10 reprehend the -'il0*"'
Jinglifhmen, but in a very mannerly way ; which they J' ree c?
relenting, replied, what bufmefs had their country- 'fc^^'6'
nien there without leave, when it was none of their 'i 1
ground? Why, faid my Spaniard, calmly, Ingt'efe, ^'^ ^
they mu ft not ftarve; but they replied. Let them (j /"^' (/
flarve and be d-mn'd, they fhould neither plant nor inI,'a^r'''
build, and d — mn them they fhould be their ftrvants, ,l -^.
and work for them, for the ifliuid was theirs, and ^ Dtir<:d ]
they would burn all the huts they fhould find in :n..t*0on<ie
the ifland. By this rule, faid rry Spaniard, fmiling, ;J ' 4e;
ive fhall be your fervants too. Aye, by G — d, and 1^ • ta
fo you fhall, replied the impudent rafcal. Upon di, 'a>i
which, ftarting upi Will. Atkins cries, Come1 Jack, '^v
iet's have t'other brufh with them; who dare to 'A- ^|
liuild in our dominions? Thus leaving us fomething L ,eircnei
Jb-eated with a juft paffion, away they trooped, every ^""'t bt
man ^n
man having a gun, piftol, and fword, muttering fome
threatening words, that we could then but imperfectly
underftand. That night they defigned to murder their
two companions, and flept till midnight in the bower,
thinking to fall upon them in their ileep: nor were
the honeft men lefs thoughtful concerning them;
for at this juncture they were coming to find them
out, but in a much fairer way. As foon as the
villains came to the huts, and found nobody there,
they concluded that I and my Spaniards had given
them notice, and therefore fwore to be revenged on
us. Then they demolifhed the poor mens habita-
tion; not by fire, as they attempted before, but
pulled down their houfes, limb from limb, not leav-
ing ftick nor ftone on ihe ground where they flood;
broke their houfehold fluff in pieces; tore up their
trees, (polled their inclofures, and, in fhort, quire
ruined them of every thing they had. Had thefe
people met together, no doubt but there would have
been a bloody battle; but Providence ordered it for
the better; for juft as the three were got thither,
the two were at our caftle i and when they left us,
the three came back again, but in a great ras*e,
fcoffingly telling us what they had done; when one
taking hold of a Spaniard's ha*t, twirls it-round, iay^
ing, Andym Seignior, Jack Spaniard, Jhull have the
fame fauce, if you don't mend your manners. My Spa-
niard, a grave, but courageous man, knocked him
down with one blow of his fift , at which another
villain fired his piitul, and narrowly milled his body,
but wounded him a little in the ear. Hereat tn-
raged, the Spaniard takes up the fellow's mulket
wftom he had knocked down, and wouid have Ihot
him, if i and the reft had not come out, and taken
•their arms from every one or them.
I hefe tnglifhrnen perceiving thty had made all of
us their enemies, began to cool; but notwiihftand-
ing their better words, the Spaniaids would not re-
turn them their arms again; telling them, they would
i i do
•do them no manner of harm, if they would live
peaceably ; but if ihey offered any injury to the plan,-
ration or caftle, they would fhoot them as they
would do ravenous beafts. This made them fo mad,
that they went away raging like furies of hell. They
were no fooner gone, but in came the two hontft
men, fired with the jultcft rage, if fuch can be, ha-
ving been ruined as aforefaid. And indeed it was
•very hard, that nineteen of us mould be bullied
by three villains continually. offending with impu-
nity. ..
It was a great while, Sir, before we could perfuade
the two Englifhmen from purfuing, and undoubtedly
killing them with their fire arms; but we promiled
them juftice fhould be done them, and in the mean
t-ime they fhould refide with us in our habitation.
Jn about five days after, thefe three vagrants, almoft
ilarved with hunger, drew near our grove, and per-
.ceiving me, the governor, and two others, walking
by the fide of the creek, they very fubmiffively de-
fired to be received into the family again. We
told them of.their great incivility to us, and of their
-unnatural barbarity to their countrymen; but yet
%ve would fee what .the reft agreed to, and in half
an hour's time would bring them word. After fome
^debate, we railed them .in, where their two coun-
trymen laid a heavy charge againft them, for not
.only ruining, but deigning to murder them, which
«hey could not deny. But here 1 was forced to
inrerpofe as a mediator, by obliging the two Englifh-
men not to hurt them, being naked and unarmed j
and that the other three fhould make them reftitu-
iion, by building their two huts, and fencing their
ground in the fame manner as. it was before. Well,
being in a miferable condition, they fubmitted to
tfcis at prefent, aud lived fome time regularly enough,
except as to the working part, which they did npt
care for; but the ^Spaniards woiild have difpenfed
wiih th;\t, had they continued eify and quiet. Their
arms
arms being given them again, they fcarce had thenv
a week, when they became as troublefome as ever;
but an accident happening foon after, obliged us to
lay afide "private refentments, and look to our com-
mon preservation.
On« night, Sir,. I went to bed, perfectly well in
heahh, and yet by no means could I compofe myfelf
to fleep: upon. which, being very uneafy, 1 got up,
and looked out; but it being dark, I could perceive
nothing but the trees around our caftle: 1 went to-
feed again, but it was all one, I could not fleep';
when one of my Spaniards heaiing me walk about>
aiked who it was up? I anfwered, It is I. When-
1 told him the occafiorr; Sir, fa id he, fucli thingiv
are not to be flighted; for certainly there is fome
tnifchief plotting near us. Where are the Englifh-
'men? faid I. He anfwered, in their hnts; for they
lay feparate front us, Sir, fince the laf t mutiny. Well,.
faid I, fome kind fpirit gives this- information fo'F-
'eiir advantage.. Come, let us go abroad, and.fee if
''any thing offers to juftify our fears-. Upon which £
'and fome of my Spaniards went up the mountain,
not by the ladder, but through the grove; and then
we were ftruck with a panic fear, on feeing a light,
as. though?4!'^ were a fire, at a very little difbtnce,.
"and heafmg th« voicd of feveral men. Hereupon we
retreated immediately, and railing the reft of our
forces, miide them fenfible of the impending dangler:
but, with all my authority,. I could not make them-
ftay where they were, fo earnef t were they to fee
how things wen:. Indeed die darknefs-of the night
gave them opportunity enough to view them (by
the light of their. fire) undifcovered. As they were
in different parries, and ftraggling over the fliorey
we were much afraid that they fhould find out our
habitations,. and deftroy pur flocks of goats;' to.
prevent which, we fent an Englilhman and two Spa-
.niards to drive the- goats into the valley where the
'cave lay; or, if there was occaiiori, into the cave.

relanon when' we heard an uncommon noife, and
peiceived that there was a horrid engagement be.
tween the two armies.
Such was the curioiity of our party, efpecially the
^ngln^men, that they would not lie clofe, though
OW Friday told them their fafety depended upon it;
•nnn Hiat it we had patience, we fhould behold the
favages kill one-another. However, they ufed fome
caunon, by going farther into the woods, and pla-
cing themlelves in a convenient place to behold the
b.ialc-. -nn
Never could there be a more -bloody engagement,

ci, according to -their way and manner of fighting.

put into a great confuraation on this account, left
they fhouUl'run into our grove, and conlequently
Viring us into the like danger. Hereupon we ro-
folved to kill the firft. that c,mie, to prevent diftove-
Ty , and that too with our fwords, and the butt end
f our "nifkets, for fear the report of our guns
be heard. .'»

And fo indeed, as we thought, it happened: for
three of the vanquifhed army crofting the .creek, rair
directly to the place, as to a thick wood for fhelter;
nor was it long before our fcout gave us notice of it ;.
as alfo, that the victors did not think fit to puifue
them. Upon this I would not fufter them to be
fliin, but h.id them furprifed and taken by our par-.
ty: and afterwards they proved very good fervants
to us, being ftout young creatures, and able to do a
great deal of work. The remainder of the conquer-
ed: favagesifted to their cacoes, and put out into the
ocean, while iive conqraerors ioined together, (hom-
ed by way of triumph: and about three in the after-
noon they alfo embarked for their own nation.
Thus we were freed at once from the favages and
our fears, not perceiving any of thefe creatures for'
fome confiderablc time after. We found two and
thirty men dead in the field of battle; fome were-
fliin with long arrows, which we found fticking in.
their bodies; and the reft were killed with great un-
weildy wooden fwords, which denoted their vaft
ftrength, and of which we found feventeen, befides-
bows and arrows: bat we could not find one wound--
ed creature among them alive ; for they either kill
their enemies quite, or carry thofe wounded away'
with them.
This terrible fight tamed the Englifhmen for fome
time, confidering how unfortunate they might have
been, had they fallen into their hands, who would not
only kill them as enemies, but alfo for food, as we
do cattle; and indeed fo much did this naufeate
tiieir (tomachs, that it not only made them very tick,
but more tractable to the common nectffiry bufi-
nefs of the whole fociety, planting, fowing, and
reaping, with the greateft figns of amiiy and fiisnd-
fhip: fo that now being all good friends, we began
to confider of circumftances in general; and the
firft thing we thought of, was, whether, as we per--
ceived the favages haunted that fide of the ifLmd,.

and uffiaent for both. But ye«, when weconfi-
ttl 'WC a!tered one part of our '-Solution;
vv inch was, to remove part of our cattle thither, and
plant only part of our corn there; fo that in cafe
one part was deftroyed, the other might be preferved.
Another resolution we took, which really had a great
deal of prudence in it; and that was, in not trufting
the three favages whom we had taken prifoners,
TVith any knowledge of the plantations which we
l,.id made in that valley, of what number of cattle we
Ji3d there, much \els of the cave, wherein were kept

viog a PIaf e for landing: and among thofe 1 had
planted, they had intermingled fo many fhort ones,
.Al\ ot which growing wonderfully faft and thick,. a
little
little dog fcarcely could find a paflage through them.
Nor was this fufficient, as we thought; for we did
the fame to all the ground, to the right and left hand
of us, even ro the top of the hill, without fo much
as leaving a paflage for ourfelves except by the lad-
der: which being taken down, nothing but what
had wings or witchcraft could pretend to come near
Tis. And indeed this was exceedingly well contri-
ved, efpecially to ferve that occafion, for which wer-
afterwards found it neceflary.
Thus we lived two years in a happy retirement,,
having all this time not one vifit from the favages.;
Indeed one morning we had an alarm, which put us
in fome amazement-; fora few of my Spaniards be-
.ing out very early, perceived no lets th'an twenty
canoesv as it were coming on fhore; upon which,.
returning home with great precipitation, they gave
us the alarm, which obliged us to keep at home all
that dayt and the next, going out only in the night-
time, to make our obfervations: but as good luck
would have it, they were upon another defign, and',
did not land that time upon the ifland.
But now there happened another quarrel between
the three wicked Englifhmen, and fome of my Spa-
;niards. The occafion was this: Une of them being
enraged at one of the favages^ whom he had taken
prifoner, for not being able to comprehend fome-
rthing which he was (hewing him, fnatehed-up a
hatchet in a great fury, not to correct, but to kill
him; yet miffing his head, gave him fuch a barba-
rous cut in the fhoulder, that he had like to have
fhtick offhis arm; at which one of my good-natured
.Spaniards iatorpofing. between. the Engli(hman -and:
favage, befe^ched the former not to murder the poor
creature; but this kindnefs had like to have coftv
. the Spaniard his life, for the Engliftiman ftruck at
him in the fame manner; which. he nimbly and wife--
ly avoiding, returned fuddenly upon him with liis •

»e'ry f.i'nly knocked the bmtifh creature down.
Hereupon another Englifhman, coming to his fel-
lows affiance, laid the good Spaniard on the earth;
when immediately two others coming to his relief,
were aitacked by th'e third Englifhman, armed with
an old cutlafs, who wounded them both. This up-
ro.tr foon reached our ears, when we rufhing out
"upon them, took the three Englifhmen prifbners:
nnd theft our next queftion was, what fhoiild bfe
done to fuch mutinous and impudent fellows, fo fir-
rious, defperate, and idle,, that they were mifchievous
ro the higheft degree, and confequently not fafe for
the fociety to let them live among them.
Now; Sir, as 1 was governor in your abfince, fo
J alfo'took the authority of a judge; and having
them brought before me, I told them, that if they
tad been of my country, I would have hanged every
mother's fon of them; but fince it was an Englifhraan
(meaning you, kind Si) to whom we were indebted
for our prefervation and deliverance. I would ingra-
titude ufe them with all poffible mildnefs; but at
the fame time leave them to the judgment of fire
Other two Englifhmen, who, I hoped. forgetting
tbeir refer/tments, would deal impartially by them.
Hereupon one of his countrymen flood up; Stirt

Why will you, Seignior Atkins, (fuid 1,/roiling), put

ty? But fo great a rage did my fcoffing, and yet
fevere jeft, put him into, that he was going to fly at
me, and undoubtedly had attempted to kill me if
he had been pofiefied of weapons, and had not been
prevented by three Spaniards. This unpirallelled
and vilianous carnage, made us ferioufiy confider
what was to be done. The two ILnglifhmen and the.
Spaniard, who had faved the poor Indian's life, migh-
tily petitioned me to hang one of them, .for an ex-
ample to the others, which fhould be him that had
twice attempted to commit murder with his hatchet,
it being at that time thought impoffible the poor
flave fhould recover. But they could never gain my
content to put him to death, for the reafons above
mentioned, lince it was an Englifhman (even .your-
felf) who was my deliverer: and as merciful coun-
fe!s are moft prevailing, when earnefHy preffed, fo I
got them to be of {he fame opinion as to clemency.
But to prevent thiir doing us any further mifchief,
we all agreed, that they fhould have no weapons, as -
.-fword, gun, powder, or fliot, but be expelled from
the fociety, to leave as they pleafed, by themfelves;
that neither the two Englifhmen, nor the reft of the
Spaniards, fhould have converfation with them upon
any account whatsoever: that they fhould be kept
from coming within a certain diftance of our caftle^
and if they dared to pffer-us any violence, Neither by
fpoiling,'burning, killing, orideitr.oying, any of the
corn, plantings, buildings, fences, or cattle belong- •'

as we would do beafts of prey, in whatsoever places

as hatchets, an axe, faw, and other things conve-,
nient to build them huts: all which were agreed to;
but before they took them in pofieffion, 1 obliged
them folemnly to fwear, never to attempt any thing
againft us or their countrymen for the future. Thus
difmiffing them from our fociety, they went away,
fulten and refractory, as though neither willing to
go nor itay r however, feeing no remedy, they took
what proviiion was given them, peopofing, to cbufe
a convenient place, where they might live by them-
/elves.
About five days after, they came to thofe limit*
nppointed, in order for moie victuals, and fent me
•word by one of my Spaniards, whom they called to,
where they had pitched their ;ents, and marked
themfelves out an habitation and plantation, at the
1J. E. and moft remote part of the ifland. And.
indeed there they built themfelves two very;band-
fome cott. ges, relembling our little caftle, being un-
der the h'de of a mountain, with fome trees already
growing on three iides of it; fo that piaming a few
,nore, it would have been obfcured from light, un-
Jefs particularly fought for. W'nen thefe huts were
finithed, we gave them fome dry goat ikms for bed-
ding and covering; and upon their giving us fuller
iiffurancts of their good behaviour tor thefuture,
vre gave them fome peafe, barley, and nee for low-
ing, and whatever tools we could ipare.
Six month did they live in this ft pirate condition,
in which they got their firft harveft in, the quaniity
of which was but fmall, becaufe they had planted
but little land: for indeed, all their plantations be-

it was a thing out of their element: and when they
.were obliged to make their boards and pots, &c.
.they could make little or nothing of it. But the rai-
ny (baton eoming on, put them into a greater perplex-
ity for want of a cave to keep their corn dry, and
prevent it from fpoiling : and fo much did this hum-
ble them, that they begged of my Spaniards to help
-them, to which the good natured men readily confent-
cd, and in four days (pace worked a great hole in
the fide of the hill for them, large enough for their
.purpofe, to lecure their cora and other things from
the rain, though not comparable to ours, which had
feveral additional apartments.
But a new whim poffefled thefe rogues about three
quarters of a year after, which had like to have ru-
ined us, and themfelves too: for, it feems being tired.
and weary of this fort of living, which made them
. work for themfelves, without hopes of changing their
condition, nothing would ferve them, but they would
. make a voyage to the continent, and try if they could
, feize upon fome of the favages, and bring them over
. as fl.av.es, to do their drudgery, while they lived at
. eale and pleafure.
Indeed the projeft was not fo prepofterous, if they
had not gone farther; but they neither did, nor pro-
pofed any thing, but what had milchief in the de-
. fign, or the event. One mornhpg thele three fellows
came down to the limited ftation, and humbly defi-
red to be.admitted to talk with us: which we readi-
. ly granted; they told us, in (hort, that being tir$d
of .their manner of living, and the labour of their
hands, in fuch employuaents, not being fufficient to
. procure the neceflaries of life, they only defired one
of the canoes we eame over in, with fome arms aild
, ammunition, for their defence, and they would lefk
their fortunes abroad, and never trouble us any more.
.To:be fure, wev,were glad enough to get rid of fu$h
wretched plagues; but yet honefty made us ingenu-

ed, that they neither could nor would work; and
confcqnently-, that they might as well be ftarved a-

neither had they any wives or children to cry afier

have the lefs occafion to be concerned, fince if they
are not Indians, they muft be friends; for I am lure
there is no Chriftian people upon earth, but what
will do us good rather than harm. But while we
were confidering of the event, trp came the three
Englifhmen, whofe voices we quickly knew, and fo
all our admiration of that nature ceafed at once. And
our wonder was fucceeded by another fort of inqui-
ry, which was, what could be the occafion of their re-
turning fo quickly to the ifland, when we little ex-
pected, and much lefs defired their'company ? Bat
as this was better to be related by themfelves, I or-
dered them to be brought in, when they gave me
the following relation of their voyage.
After two days fail, or fomething lefs, they reach-
ed land, were they found the people coming to give
them another fort of reception than what they ex-
pected or defired: for as. the favages -were armcii
with bows and arrows, they durft not venture on
fhore, but fleered northward, fix or feven hours, till
'they gained an opening, by which they plainly per-
ceived, that the land that appeared from this place,,
was not the main land, but an ifland. At their en-
trance into the opening of the fea, they difcovered
another ifland, on the right hand northward, and
feveral more lying to the weftward; but being re-
folved to go on Ihare fome where or other, they
put over to one of the weftern ifLinds- Here they
found the natives very courteous to them, giving'
them feveral roofs and dried fifh; nay, even their
women too were as willing to fupply them with what-
they could procure them' to eat, bringing it a-great
way to them upon their heads. Among thefe ho-
fpitabk Indians they continued fome days, inquiring
by ligns and tokens, what-nations lay around them;
and were informed, that th$re were feveral fierce
and terrible people lived every way, accuftomed to
eat mankind: but for. themfelves, they never ufed
fuch
. fucK diet, except thofe that were taken in battle, and
.of them they made a folemn feaft.
The Englilhmen inquired how- long: it was fince
they had a feaft of that kind? they anfwcred, about
.two raoons ago, pointing to-the moon, and then
to two fingers; that, at this-time, their king had two
.hundred priloiiers, which-were fattening up for the
...fiaughter. The .Lnglifhmen were mighty defirous
of feeing the prifoners, which the others miftaking,
thought that they wanted'fome of them for their own
food: upon which they beckoned to them, pointing
to the riling, and then to the fetting of the fu&;
meaning that by the iime that it appeared in the eaft
next morning, they would bring them fome : and
indeed they were as- good as their word; for by that
time they brought eleven men and five women, juft
as fo many cows and oxen are brought to lea-port
towns, to victual a (hip. But as brutifh as thefe
Englifhmen were, their fiomachs turned at the light.
"What to do in this cafe, they could not tell« to re-
fufe the prifoners, would have been the higheft af-
front offered to the favage gentry; and to dilpole of
them, they knew not in whar manner :. howeverthey
i-efolved to accept them, and fo gave them, in re-
turn, one of their hatchets, an old key, a knife
and fix or feven of their bullets: things which tho'
they were wholly ignorant of, yet feemed entirely
contented with; and dragging the poor wretches in-
to the boat, with their hands bound behind them,
'delivered them to the Knglilhm.en. . But this obliged
them to put off as fbon as they had thefe prefents,
Jelt the donors fhould have expected two or three of
.them to be killed, and to.be iavited to dinner the
next day: and fo taking leave, with ail poffible re-
T: and thanks though neither of them undeiftood
t the others faid, they failed away buck to the
ifland, and there fet eight of the prifoners at
liberty. In their voyage, they endeavoured to com-
fort, and have fome convedation with the poor cap-
tives;

trees ; but it was impoffible to make them feiifible
of any thing; and nothing they could fay, or give,
or do for them, could make them othei wife perfua-
ded, but that they were unbound only to be devour-
ed: if they gave them any food, they thought it was
only to fatten them for the Slaughter; or looked at
any one more particularly, the poor creature fup-
pofed itfelf to be the firft facrifice: and even when
we brought them to our ifland, and began to ufe
them with the greateft humanity and kindnefs; yet
they expected every day that their new mafters
would devour them.
And thus, Sir, did thefe three ftrange wanderers
conclude their unaccountable relation of their voy-
age, .which was both amazing and entertaining. Here-
upon I silked them, where their new .family was?
'I hey told me, they had put them into one of their
huts, and they came to beg fome victuals for them.
This, indeed, made us'all long to fee them; and fo
taking Friday's father with us, and leaving only two
at our caftle, we came down to behold thefe poor
creatures.
When we arrived at the hut, (tliey being bound'
again by the Knglilhmen, for fear of efcap'mg), .w$
found them ftark naked, expecting their fatal tra-
gedy: there were tbree lufty men, well fhaped, with
Straight and fair limbs, between thirty .and ifive and
thirty years old; and five women, two of them
might be from thirty to forty, two more not above
four and twenty; and the laft a comely tall maiden
of about feventeen. Indeed, all the women were
very agreeable, both in their proportion and features,
except that they were tawny, which their ncodcfc
behaviour and other graces made amends for, when
they afterwards came to be clothed.
'This naked appearance, together with their mifer-
able circumftances, was no very comfortable fight
to my Spaniards, who. for their parts, I may ven-
ture, Sir, without flattery, to fay, are men of the
bell
110
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
beft behaviour, calmeft tempers, and fweeteft na-
ture, that can poffibly be; for they immediately or-
dered Friday's father to fee if he knew any of them,
or if he underftood what they could fay. No (bon-
er did the old Indi in appear, but he looked at them
with great feiioufnefs; yet, as they were not of his
nation, they wore utter ftr.mgers to him, and none
could underftand his fpeech or figns, but one wo
man. This was enough to anfwer the defign,
which was to affure them they would not be killed,
being fallen into the hands of Chriitians, who ab-
horred fuch barbarity. When they were fully fatis-
fied of this, lhey exprefied their joy, by fuch
ftrange geftures, and uncommon tones, as it is not
poffible for me to defcribe. But the woman, their
interpreter was ordered next to inquire, whether
they were content to be fervants, and would work
for the. men, who had brought them hither to fave
their lives? Hereupon (being by this time unbound)
they fell a capering and dancing, one taking ihis
thing upon her fhoulders, and the other that, inti-
Hating, that they were willing to do any thing for
them. But now Sir, having women among us, and
<dreading'that it 'might occafion fome ftrife, if not
blood, I .ilkcd the three men what they would do,
arid how they intended to ufe thefe creature?, whe-
ther as fervants or women? One of them very peit-
ly and readily anfwered, they would ufe them a*
ti(>ih. Gentlemen, faid I, as you are your own ma-
ilers, I am not going to reflrain you from that; but,
-thethinks> for avoiding diff:n!ions among you, i
tvoukl only dtfire you to eng.fge, that none of you
\v\l\ take more than one for a woman or a wite : and
that having taken this one, none elfe fhou'd prefume
to touch her; for though we have not a prieftly au.
-thority to marry yon, yet it is but reafonable, that
•vvhoever thus takes a woman, fhould be obliged to
her, (ince nobody elfe has any thing to do
. her: and this indeed appeared-fo juft to all pre-
fent
tots
fent, that it was unanimou(ly agreed to. The En'
glifhmen then afked my Spaniards, whether they de-
figned to take any of them? but they all anfwered,
No; fome declaring they had already wives in Spain;
and others, that they cared not to join with infidels.
On the reverfe, the Englifhmen took each of them a
temporary wife, and fo fet up a new method of
living. As to Friday's father, the Spaniards, and
the three favage fervants we had taken in the late
battle, they all lived with me in our ancient caftle;
and indeed we fupplied the main part of the ifland
with food, as neceffity required. But the moft re-
markable part of the ftory is. how thefe Englifhmen
who had been fo much at variance, fhould agree a-
bout the choice of thefe women; yet they took a
way. good enough to prevent quarrelling among
themfclves. They fet the five women in one of
their huts, and going themfelves to the other, drew
lots which fhould have the firft choice. Now, he
that had the firft lot went to the hut, and fetched
out her he chofe; and it is remarkable, that he took
her that was the moft homely and eldeft of the num-
ber, which made the reft of the Englifhmen exceed-
ing merry; the Spaniards themfclves could not but
fmile at it: but, as it happened, the fellow had <he
beft thought, in chufing one fit for application and
bufinefs: and indeed (he proved the beft wife of all
the parcel.
But when the poor creatures perceived themfelves
•placed in a row, and fepar.ited one by one, they were
again feizcd with an unlpeakable terror, as now
tiiinking they were going to be flaih in e.iriieft: and
when the Englifhman came to take the firft, the reft
fet up a lamentable cry, clapt their arms around
her neck, and hanging about her, took their laft
farewell, as they thought, in (uch trembling ago-
nies, and affectionate embraces, as would have
Ibftened the hardeft heart in the world, and made
the dryeft eyes melt into tears; nor could they be
perfuaded,
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
perfuaded, but that they were going to die, 'till fuch
time as Friday's father made them fenfible that the
Englilhinen had chofen them for their wives, which
ended all their terror and concern upoa this occ.t-
fion.
Well, after this, .the Englifhmen went to work,
and being affifted by my good natured Spaniards, in
a few hours they creeled every one of them a new
but or tent, for their feparate lodging, fmce thofe
they had already were filled with tools, houfehold
fluff, and provifion. They all continued on the
north fhore of the ifUnd, but feparate as before;
the three wicked ones pitched farther off, and the
two honeft men nearer our caftle; fo that the ifl.md
feeined to be peopled in .three places, three towns
beginning to be built for. that purpofe. And here I
canuQt but remark, what is very common, that the
two honeft men, Iwd the .worft wives, (I mean as to
induftry, cleanlinefs, and ingenuity), while the
three reprobates enjoyed women quite of contrary
qualities.
.JJ.ut another obfervation I.made was, in fa.voiir of
the two honeft men, to fhew what difparity there is
between.a diligent application to bufinefs, on the
one hand,..and a, flothful, negligent, anil idle tem-
per, on the oither. .Both p.f them h,t.d the fame par-
cel of ground laid, out, .and corn, to .fow, fufficient
for them; but both did not make the fame improve-
ments, either in,,their .cultivation, or in their plant-
ing. The two honeft men, had a multitude of young
trees planted about their habitation, fo that when
you approached near them, nothing appeared but a
ivood, very pleafing and delightful. Every thing.
they did profpered.and flourHhed; their grapes plant-
ed in order, feemed as though managed in a vine-
7-a.rd, and.were infinitely preferable to,any of the o^
;hers. Nor were they wanting to find out a place
>f retreat, but dug a cave in the moft retired part
tf 4. thick wood, to fecure their wives and childreni

As to the reprobates, (though I muft own they
were much more civilized than before), inftead of Si
delightful wood furrounding their dwellings, we
found the words of King Soioman too truly verified:
/ -went by the vineyard of the Jlothful, and it was all
overgrown -with thorns. In many places their crop
was obfcured by weeds; the hedges having feveral
gaps in them, the wild goats had got in, and eateti
up the corn, and here and there was a dead bnfh,
to ftop in thofe gaps for the prefent, which was no
more .than fhuiting the ftable door after the fteed
was ftolen away. But as to their wives, they (as I
obferved before) were more diligent; and cleanly e-
nough, efpecially in their victuals, being inftructed
by one of the h'oneft men, who had been a cook's
mate on board A fhip: and very well it was fo; for
as he cooked himfelr, his companion and their fa-
milies lived as well as the idle hufbands, who did
nothing but loiter about, fetch turtles eggs, catch
fifh and birds, and do any thing but work, and lived
accordingly, while the diligent lived very hand-
fomely and plentifully, in the moft comfortable
manner.
And now, Sir, I come to lay before your eyes a
fcene quite different from any thing that ever happen-
ed to us before, and'perhaps ever b'efel you in all the
ume of your refi'dence on this Hland. 1 lh.aH inform

One morning, Sir, very early, there came five or
fix canoes of Indians on Ihore, i'ndifputably upon
their old c'uftom of devouring their prifoners. AH
that we had to do upon fuch an occalion, was to lie
concealed, that they, riot having any notice of in-

I looking abroad, and being inflamed with a c'urio-
fi'.y to fee what they had been doing, to our great
amazement, beheld three favages faft afleep on the
ground, who, either being gorged, could not awake
when the others went off, or having wandered too
far into the woods, did not come buck in time.
What to do with them at fit ft, we could not tell;
as for flaves, we had enough of them already; and as
to killing them, neither Chriftianity nor humanity
would fuffer us to fhed the blood of peribns who ne-
ver did us wrong. . We perceived they had no boat
left them to tranfport them to their own nation;
and that by letting thtm wander about, they migut
discover us, and inform the firft favages that fhould
happen to land upon ihe fame bloody occafion,
ivhich information might entirely ruin us; and there-
fore I CQunftlltd my Spaniards to fecure them, and
'et them about fome work or other, - till we could
yetter difpofe of them.
Hereupon we all went backhand making them a-
urake, took them prifoners. It is impoffible to ex-
,refs the horror they were in, efpecially when bound,
iS thinking they were going to be murdered and
aten, but we loon eafed them of iheir fear as to
Iidt point. We firft took' them to the bower, where
he chief of our country-work lay, as keeping goats,
rlant.ng corn, &c, and then carried them to-the two
.ngltlWo's habitation, to help them m their buli-
iefs: but happy ic was for us all, we did not carry
to our caftle, as by the fequel will appear.

turning in about four weeks time, and going off in
the fpace of two days. You may be certain, Sir,
this thouglit could not but terrify us exceedingly,
and make us juftly conclude, that this favage would
inform his countrymen of our abode in the ifhnd,
how few and weak we were in comparifon to their
numbers; and we expected it would not be long
before the Englifhmen would be attacked in their
habitauons: but the favages had not ieen thtir places
of fafety in the wood, nor our cal'tle, which it was
a great happinefs they did not know.
Nor were wt miftaken in our .thoughts upon .this
occafion; for about eight months after this, fix ca-
noes, with about ten men in each canoe, came fail-
ing by the north-fide of the ifland, which they wtrc
never accufto«itd to do before, and landed about an
hour after iun rife, n..ar a mile from the dwelling of
the two Engiifhrmn, who, it feems, had the good for-
tune to diicover them about a league off; fo ihat it
was an hour before they could attain the fhore, and
fome lo.iger ri »e befoie they could come at them.
And now being confirmed in this opinion, that they

and drove them all out, giving the goats liberty to

that they were wild ones; but the flave had given a

and ammunition, and made to the cave where they
had fent their wives, and fecurlng their flaves, feated
themfelves in a private place, from whence they
might behold all the actions of the favages. ftor
had they gone far, when afcending a rifing ground,
they could fee a liule army of Indians approach to
their beautiful dwelling, and, in a few moments
more, perceive the fame, and their furniture, to their
unfpeakable grief, burning in a confuming flame:
and when this was done, they fpread here and there
fearching every bufii and place for the people, of
whom it was very evident they had information.
Upon which the two Englifhmen, not thinking them-
felves fecure where they flood, retreated about half
a mile higher in the country, rightly concluding,
that the farther the favages ftrolled, there would be
kffer numbers together: upon which they next took
their ftand by the trunk of 'an old tree, very hollow
and large, whence they refolved to fee what would
offer; but they had not fiood long there before two
favages came running directly towards them, as
though having knowledge of their being there, who
feemed refolved to attack them; a little farther were
thres more, and five more behind them again, all
running the fame way. It cannot be ^imagined what
perplexity the poor men were in at this fight, think-
ing that if affiftance did not fpeedily come, their
cave in the wood would be difcovered, and conle-
quently all therein loft: fo they reiolved to refift
them there; and when overpowered, tt> afcend to

tages came on, one of them was the runaway, who
had caufed all the mifchief; fo they refblved he
ihould not efcape, if they both fired at once. But
however, though, they did not fire together, they were
rendy charged; when the firft that let fly, wa? too

images. But when all things were in profound fi-
lence, they came to the place where their companions
lay: and here not being fenfible that they were
liable to the fame fate, ftood over the wounded

Spaniards and Englifh urged the abfolute neceffity
there was of killing them, for our common prefer*
vation: but, Sir, the authority I bore as a .gover-
nor, over-ruled that piece of cruelty: and then I
ordered them to be fent pritoners to the old cave in
the valley, bound hands and feet, with two Spa-
niards to guard them. - .
So much encouraged were the Englifhmen at the
approach of the Spaniards, and fo great was their
fury againft the favages, tor deftroying their habi-
tations, that they had not patience to ftay any longer;
but taking five Spaniards along with them, armed
with four mufkets, a piftol, and a quarterftaff, away
>hey went in purfuit of their enemies. As they paffed
by the place where the favages were flain, it was ve-
ry eafy to be perceived that more of them had been
there, having attempted to carry off their dead bo-
dies, but found it impracticable. From a riling
•ground, our party had the mortification to fee the
Imoke that proceeded from the ruins ; when cocne-
ing farther in fight of the fhore, they plainly per-
ceived that the favages had embarked in their canoes
and were putting out to fea. This they were very
forry for, thereibeing no coming at them to'give
them a parting falute ; bur, however, they wereiglad

their three mifchievous countrymen, when they
heard it, (which was after all thefe difafters were o-
ver, they living remote eaftward}, very friendly fym-
pathifed with them, and worked for them feveral
days: fo that in a little time their habitation was re-
built, their neceffities fupplied, and themfelves re-
ftored to their former tranquillity.
Though the favages had nothing to boaft of in
this adventure, (feveral canoes being driven afhore,
followed by two drowned creatures, having un-
doubtedly met wirh a ftorm at fea, that very night
they departed), yet it was natural to befuppofed, that
ihofe whofe better fortune it was to attain their na-
tive fhore, would inflame their nation to another
ruinous attempt, with a greater force to carry all
before ihera. And indeed fo it happened ; for, a-
bout feven month after, our ifland was invaded with
a moft formidable navy, no lefs than eight and twen-
ty canoes full of favages, armed with wooden
fwords, monftrous clubs, bows and arrows, and
luch like inftruments of war, landing at the eaft fide
of the ifland.
You may well, Sir, imagine, what confternaiion
our men were in upon this account, and how fpeedy
They were to execute their refolution, having only
that night's time allowed them They knew, that
fince they could not withftand their enemies, con-
cealment was the only way to procure their fafety:
and therefore they took down the huts that were
built for the two Englifhmen, and drove their flock
of goats, together with their own at the bower, to the
Old cave in the valley, leaving as little appearance ot
inhabitants as poffible; and then. pofted themfelves,
with all their force, at the plantation of the two men.
As they expected, fo it happened; for early the next

J\s to our flaves, we gave three of them halberts,
and the other three long ftaves, wiih great iron
fpikes at the end of them, with hatchets by thcir
fides: we alfo had hatchets flicking in our girdles,
beiides the fire arms: nay, two of the women, in-
fpired with Amazonian fortitude, could not be c';if-
fuaded from fighting along with their deareft huf-
bands, and if they died, to die with them. Seeing
their iefolutfbn, we gave them hatchets likewife;
but what pleafed them.beft, were the bows and ar-
rows (which they dexteroufly knew how to lift) that
the Indians had left behind them, after tlieir memo-
rable tattle one againft another.
Over this army, which, though little, was of greait
intrepidity, I was conftirnted chief general and com-
mander; and knowing Wil\. dtkins, though exceed-
ing wicked, yet a man of invincible courage, I gave
bim the power of commanding under me: he and

for though the favages came on vvi;h the fiercencfs

men to give fire, fo great was their confternation. to

After I had, Sir, drawn up our liule army to-

was, would have had us attack the whole 'body df

By the brightnefs of the moon that night, we per-

piough obliged to conquer them by the law of arms:
t>ut our own Indian flaves put them out of their pain,
fry difpatching them with their hatchets. At lengih

fliot of them, I ordered two pieces to be fired with-
out ball, in order to alarm them, that we might
plainly know, whether they had the courage to ven-
ture another battle, or were utterly difpirired from
fuch an attempt, that fo we might accordingly ma-
nage them. And indeed the project took very well ;•
for no fooner did the favages hear the firft gun, and
perceive trafcflafh of the fecond, but they fudde'nly'
ftarted upon their feet, in the greateft confternati-
on; and when we approached towards them, ihey
ran yowling and fcreaming away up the hill into'
the country.
We could rather, at firft, have wifhed, that the'
weather had permitted them to have gone off to the

wounded, would not part from us all this while)
advifing us not to let ffip this advantage, but clapping.

capacity of ever returning to plague the ifland: /

which is, that theft. creatures, Iiving tike leajls in the

approved of, we fet fire to their boafs ; and though.1
they were fo wet that they would not burn entirely,
yet we made them incapable for fwimming in the'
feas. As foon as the Indians- perceived what vve
were doing, many of .them ran out of the woods, in'
fight of us, and kneeling down piteoufly cried out,
Oa, Oa, JVarafnakoa, intimating, I fuppofe, that If'
we would but fpare their canoes, they would never"
trouble us again.

- But all their complaints, fubmifllons, and entrea-
ues were in vain: for felfcprcfervation obliging us
to the contrary, we deftroyed every one of them that
had efcaped the fury of the ocean. When the In-
dians perceived this, they raifed a lamentably cry,
and ran into the woods, where they continued ran-
gmg about, making the woods ring wiUi their la-
mentauon. Here we fhould have con&lered, that
making thefe creatures thus defperate, we ought, at
the fame time, to have fet a fufficient guard upon
the plantations; for the favages, in their ranging
about, found out the bower, deftroyed the fences,
trod the corn down under their feet, and tore up
the vines and grapes. It is true we were always able
to fight thefe creatures; but as they were too fwift
for us, and very numerous, we durft not go out.
lingle, for fe.ir of them; though that too was need-
le.fs, they having no weapons, nor any materials to
make them; and indeed their extremity appeared in
a little time after.
Though the iavages, as already mentioned, had
deftroyed our bower, and all our corn, grapes, &c.
yet we had ftill left our ftock of cattle in the valley
by the cave, with fome little corn that grew there,
and the plantation of Will. Atkins and his com-
•panions, one of whom being killed by an arrow;
they were now reduced to two: it is remarkable,
that this was the fellow who cut the poor Indian with
Jiis hatchet, and had a delign to murder me and my
countrymen the Spaniards As our condition was
fo low, we came to the refolution. to drive the fava-
ges up to the farther pa/t of the ifland, where no In-
dians landed: to kill as many.of them as we could,
till we had reduced tjieir number; $nd then to give
the remainder feme corn to plant, and to teach them
Jiow to live by their daily labour. Accordingly we
purfued them with our guns,. at the hearing of
which they were fo terrified, that they would fall

of this; -which, if they will not agree to, every one of
them Jhall be Jlain.-
The poor creatures; thoroughly humbled, being
reduced to about thirty-fever>j joyfully accepted the
offer, and earneftly begged for food; hereupon we
fent twelve Spaniards and two Englifhmen, well arm-
ed, together with Old Friday, and three Indian flaves
who marched to the place where they were. 'I hs
flaves were loaded with a large quantity of bread,
and rice cakes, with three live goats: and the poor
Indians being ordered to fit down on the fide of the
hill, they ate the victuals very thankfully, and have
proved faithful to the laft, never trefpailing beyond'
their bounds, where at this day they quietly and''
happily remain, and where we now and then vliit:
them. They are confined to a neck of land about -
a mile. and a half broad, and three or four in length,
on the fotffh-eaft corner of the ifland, the fea being;
before, and lofty mountains behind them, free from
the appearance of canoes; and indeed'their country-
men have never made any-enquiry after them. We'
gave them twelve hatchets; and three or four knives;
have taught them to build huts, make wooden fpndes,.
plant corn, make bread, breed tame goats, and!
milk them, as likewife to make wicker-work, in-
which, 1 muft ingenuoufly confefs, they infimte-

the moil innocent and inoffenfive creatures that ever

wives to make them a nation.
Thus, kind Sir, have I given you, according to
tny'ability, an impartial account of the various tranl'-
actions that have happened in the ifland fince your
departure, to this day: and we have great reafon to-
acknowledge the kind providence of heaven in our
inerciful deliverance. When you infpect your little

your flocks increafed, and your fubje£ts augmented:
fo that from a defolate ifland, as this was before your
wonderful deliverance upon it, here is a vifible pro-
fpect of its becoming a populous and well governed
little kingdom, to your immortal fame and glory.

The
"Will. AtkJns, who was now become a very in--
duftrious and fober man, had made himfelf a tent of
bafkct-work round the outfide; the walls were work-
ed in as a baiket, in pannels or ftrong fquares of
thirty two in number, (landing about (even feet
high: in the middle was another, not above twen-
ty-two paces round, but much fir-anger built, being
of an o&ogonal form, and in the eight corners ftood
eight ftrong pofts, round the top of which he laid
fhong pieces, pinned with wooden pins, from which
he railed a pyramid for the roof, mighty pretty, t
affure you, and joined' very well together with iron*
fpikes, which he made himfelf; for he had made
him a forge, with a pair of wooden bellows and:
charcoal for his work, forming an anvil out of one.
of the iron••crows, to work upon, and in this manner
would he make himfelf hooks, ftaples, fpikes, bolts,.
and hinges. After he had pitched the roof of his.
innermoft tent, he made it ib firm between the raf-
ters with bafket-work, thatching that over again
with riee-ftraw, and over that a large leaf of a tree,.
that his hov.le was as dry as if it had been tiled or
fluid The outer circuit was covered vas a lean-to.
quite round this inner apartment, laying long raf--
t«rs from the thirty-two angles, to the top-pofts of
the inner houfe, about twenty feet diftam; Ib that-
there was a fpace like a' walk betwixt the outer
and inner wall, near twenty feet in breadth. The.
inner place he partitioned off with the fame wicker-
work, dividing it into fix neat apartments, every one
of which had a door, firft into the entry of the main
tent, and another into the fpace and walk that was
round it, not only convenient for retreat, but for
family necefiaries. Within the door of the outer
circle, there was a paffhge directly to the door of the
inner houfe; on either fide was a wicker partition,
and a door, by which you go firft into a large
room twenty two feet wide, and about thirty long,
and through that into another of a fxnaller length,

fb that in the outward circle were ten handfdme
rooms, fix of which were only to be come at through'
the apartments of the inner tent, ferving as retiring-
rooms to the refpective chambers of the inner circle,
and four large warehoufes, which went in through
one another, two on either hand of ihe paflage that
led through the outward door to the inner tent. In
fhort, nothing could be built more ingenioufly, kept
rnore neat, or have better conveniencies: and here
lived the three families, Will. Atkins, his compani-
on, their wives and children, and the widow of the
deceafed. As to religion, the men feldom taught
their wives the knowledge of God, any more than
che failors cuftom of f wearing by his name. The
greateft improvement their wives had, was, they
taught the.n to (peak Englifh, fo as to be underftood.
None of their children were then above fix years
old; they were all fruitful enough; and, I think,
tfoe cook's mate's wife was big of her fixth child.
When I enquired of the Spaniards about their cir-
cumfhmces while among. the favages, they told me,
that they abandoned themfelves to defpair, reckoning
themfelves a poor and miferable people, that had no
rneans put into their hands, and confequently muft
foon be ftarved to death. They owned, however,
th'it they were in the wrong to think fo, and for re-
fiiing the affiftance that reafon offered for their fup-
-iort, as well as future deliverance, confeffing that
irief was a moft infignitkant paffion, as it looked
tpon things as without remedy, and having no hope
good things to come i all. which verified this
proverb,
In troub'e to be troubled,
Is to.have ycur trouble doubled.
JvJor did his remarks. end here; for making obfeN-
,ati"ns upon my improvements, and on my condi-

of mind than thofe of any other country that he had
rhet wish; and that they and the Portuguefe were
the worft men in the world to ftruggle under mis-
fortunes. When chey landed among the favages,
they found but little provifion, except they would
turn cannibals, there being but a few roots and herbs,
with little fubftance in them, and of which the na-
tives gave them but very fparingly. Many were
the ways.they took to civilize and teach the favages,
but in vain: for they would not own them to be
their inftructors, whofe lives were owing to their
bounty. 1 heir extremities were very great, many
days being entirely without food, the favages there
being more indolent :tnd lefs devouring than thofe
who had better fupplies. When they went out to
battle, they. were obliged to affift thefe people, in
one of which my faithful Spaniard being taken, had
like to have been devoured. They had loft their am-
munition, which rendered their fire arms ufelefs;
nor could they ufe the bows and arrows that were
given them, fo that while the armies were at a di-
itancc, they had no chance, but when clofe, then
they could be of fervice with halberts and fharpened
flicks, put into the muzzles of their mufkets. They
made themfelves targets of wood, covered with the
fkins of wild beafts; and when one happened to be
knocked down, the reft of the company fought over
him, till he recovered: and then (landing. clofe in a
line, they would make their way through a thouiand
favages. At the return of their friend, who they
thought had been entombed in. the bowels of their
enemies, their joy was inconceivable. Nor were they
lefs furprifed at the fight of the loaves of bread I hud
fent them, things that they had not feen for liviral
years, at the fame .time croffing and bltffing it, a$
though it was manna fent from. heavei.: but wheQ
they knew the errand, and perceived the boat which
was to carry them to the perfon and place from
whence 1'ui.h relief. c^me, this iuuck taeni with i'uch
a fur-
a furprife of joy, as made fome of them faint away,
and others burfl out into tears.
This was the fummary account that I had from
them. F fhall now inform the reader what I next
did for them, and in what condition I left them. As
we were all of opinion that the favages would fcarce
trouble them any more, fo we had no apprehenfions
on that fcore. I told them I was come purely to
eftablifti, and not to remove them; and, upon that
;'•. c.ition, had not only brought them neceflaries for
convenience and defence, but aifo artificers, and o-
riier perfons, both for their neceflary employments,
and to add to their number. They were all to-
gether when I thus talked to thfm; and before I
delivered to them the ftorcs I had brought, 1 afked
them one by one, if they had entirely forgot their
firft animofities, would engage in the ftricteft friend-
fiiip, and (hake hands with one another? On this
"Will. Atluns, with abundance of good humour,
fst'id, they had had afflictions enough to make them all
^bber, and enemies enough to make them all friends:
as for himfelf, he would live and die among them,
owning that what the Spaniards had done to him,
Jiis own mad humour had made neceflary for them
to do. Nor had the Spaniards occafion to juftify
their proceeding to me; bur they told me, that fince
^Vill. Atkins had behaved himfelf fo valiantly io
/ight, and at other times fhewed fuch a regard to
the common imereft of them all, they had not only
forgotten all that was paft, but thought he ought as
touch to be f.rufted widi arms and ceceflaries as any
of them, which they teftified by making him next
in command to the governor: and they moft hear-
tily embraced the occ.ifion of giving me this folemn
dflTurance, that they would never feparate their in-
,ereft again as long as they lived.
After thefe kind declarations of friendfhip, we ap-

fliore for that purpofe, to affift in drafting our din-
ner. We brought from the fhip fix pieces of beef,
and four of pork, together with our punch bowl,
and materials to fill it; and in particular, I gave them
ten bottles of French claret, and ten of Englifh b«er,
which was very acceptable to them. The-Spaniard*
added to our feaft five whole kids, which being roaft-
ed, three of them were Cent as frefh pieat to the
failors on board, and the other two we ate ourfelves.
After our merry and innocent feaft was over, I be-
gan to ditlribute my cargoe among them. Firft, I
gave them linen fufficient to make every one of them
four fhirts, and at the Spaniard's requeft made them
up ftx. The thin Englifh fluffs I allotted to make
every one a light coat like a frock, agreeable to ths
climate, and left them fuch a quantity, as to make
more upon their decay; as alfo pumps, fhoes, hats,
and ftockings. It is not to be exprefied the pleafing
fetisfa&ion which fat upon the countenances of
thefe poor men, when they perceived what care I
took of them, as if I had been a common father
to them all; and they all engaged never to leava
the ifland, till I gave my confent for their depar-
ture. I then prefented to them the people I brought,
fo wit, the taylor, fmith, and the two carpenters;
but my Jack of all trades was the moft acceptable
prefent I could make thero. My taylor fell imme-
diately to work, and made every one of them a
fhirt; after which he learned the women how to
few and ftitch, thereby to become the more helpful
to their bufbands. Neither were the carpenters
lefs ufeful, taking in pieces their clumfy things,
inftcad of which they made convenient and hand-
fome tables, ftools, bedfteads, cupboards, lockers,
and fhelves. But when I carried them to fee Will.

fuch a piece of natural ingenuity before: I am

this has no need of us , you need, Sir, do nothing, but
give him tool...
I divided the tools amon£i them in this manner:
to every mun I gave a diggingrfpade, a fhovel and a
rake' as having no harrows or ploughs; and to eve*
ry fepar.ire place a pick-.ixe, a crow, a broad axe,
and a (aw, -with a ftore for a general fupply, fl>ould
any be broken or worn out. I left them alfo nails,
ftap!es, hinges, hammers,-chifiels, knives, fciffirs,
and all-forts of tools and iron work; and for the
life of the fmith, gave them three tons of unwrought
iron for a iupply: and as to arms and ammunition,
1 ftored them even to profufion, or at Icaft to equip
a fufficient.little army againft all oppofers whatfo-
ever.
The young man (whofe mother was unfortunately
ftarved to death), together with the maid, a pious
and well educated young woman, feeing things fo
well ordered on fhore (for I made them accompany
rne), and confidering they had no occafion to go fo
far a voyage as to the Eaft Indies, they both defired
of me, that I would leave them there, and enter
them among my fubjects. This I readily agreed to,
ordering them a plat of ground, on which were three
little houfes erected, environed with bafket-work,
pallifadoed like Atkins's, and adjoining to his planta-
tion. So contrived were their tents, that eac-h of
them had a room apart to lodge in, while the mid-
dle tent was not only their ftorehoufe, but their place
for eating and drinking. At this time the two
Englifhmen removed their habitation to their former
place.; fo that now the ifland was divided into three
colonits ; frjl, Thoie I have juft now mentioned i

.account, we did not differ in points of faith, not
decent in a part of the country, where the poor
Indians ought to be infh'ufted in the knowledge of
the

the true God, and his Son Jefus Chrift. To this
he replied, that converfation might eafily be fepara-
ted from difputes; that he would difcourfe with me
rather fes a gentleman, than a religious; but that
if we did enter upon religious argument*, upon my
defiring the fame, I would give him liberty to de-
fend his own principles. He further added,' that he
would do all that became him in his office, as a
prieft as well as a Chriftian, to procure the happi-
nefs of all that was in the fhip : that though he
could not pray with, h.e would pray for us, on all
occafions: and then he told me feveral extraordi-
nary events of his life, within a few years paft, but
particularly in this laft, which was the moft re-
markable: that in this voyage he had the misfor-
tune to be five times Ihipped and unfhipped: his firft
defign was to have gone to Martinico, for which ta-
king (hip at St. Malo, he was forced into Lilbon by
b.ul weather, the veffel running aground in the mouth
of the 1 agus; that from thence he went on board
a Poruiguefe (hip, bound to the Madeiras, whofema-
fter being but an indifferent mariner, and out of hi*
reckoning, they were drove to Fial, where felling
rheir commodity, whicb>was corn, they refolved to-
:ake in their loading at the ifle of May, and to fail
•o Newfoundland ; at the banks of which, meeting a
French fhip bound to Quebec, in the river of Canada,
ind from thence to Martinico; in this fhip he em-
>arked, the mafter of which dying at Quebec, that
?oyage was fufpended: and laftly, Ihipping himfdf
'or Fi ance, this laft (hip was deftroyed by fire, as be-
fore has been related*.
At this time we talked no further : but another
norning he comes to me, juft as I was going to vifit
he Englifhinen's colony and tells me, that as he
:new the profperity of the ifland was my principal
[efire, he had fomething to communicate agreeable

prifei are we not yet in the way of God's bleffingi after
all thefe fignal providences and deliverances, of which
you have had luch an ample relation? He replied, I
hope, Sir, you are in the way, and that your good
defign will profper: but Itiit there are fome among
you that are not equally right in their actions: and
remember, I befcech you, Sir, that dcban, by his
Crime, removed God's bleffing from the camp of
the children of Ifrael; that though fix and thirty-
were entirely innocent, yet they became the objects
of divine vengeance, and bore the weight of the
punifhment accordingly.
So fenfibly was 1 touched with this difcour/e, and
fo fatisfied with that ardent piety that inflamed his
foul, that I defired him to accompany me to the
Englishmen's plantations, which he was very glad
of, by reafon the»e were the fubjects of what he de-
figned to difcourfe with me about; and while we
walked on together, he began in the following man-
ner.
Sir, faid he, I muft confefs it 5s a great unhappi-
nefs that we difogree In feveral doctrinal^ articles of
religion; but fnrely both of us acknowledge this,
that there. is a God, wht> having given us fomc
fiated rules for our fervice and obedience, we ought
not willingly and knowingly to offend him, either
by neglecting what he has commanded, or by doing
what he has forbidden. This truth every Chriftian.
owns, that whenever any one prefumptuoufly fins
againft God's command, the Almighty then with-
draws his bleffing from him ; every good man there-
fore ought certainly to prevent fuch neglect of, or
fin againft God and his commands. I thanked the
young prieft for expreffing fo great a concern for us,
and defired him to explain the particulars of what he
bad obferved, that, according to the parable of
Acban, I might remove the accurfed thing from a-
mo»g us. Why then,-,Sir, .faid he, in the firft

place, you have four Englifhmen, who have taken
favage women to their wives, by whom they have
(ever.il children, though none of them are legally
married, as the law of God and man requires: they,
[ fay, Sir, are no lefs than adulterers,. and as they
[till live in adultery, are liable to the curfe of God.
I know, Sir, you nny object the want of a prieft, or
:lergyman of any kind; as, alfo, pen, ink, and
iaper, to write down a contract of marriage, and
iave it figned between them. But neither this, nor
vhat the Spanifh governor has told you of their
ihufing by confent, can be reckoned a marriage,
ior any more than an agreement to keep them from
[iiarrelHng among themfelves -, for, Sir, the effence
ir fae'rament of matrimony (fo he called it) nor only
onfifts in mutual confent, but in the legal obliga-
ion which compels them to own and acknowledge
ine another, to abftain from other perfons, the men
3 provide for their wives and children, and the wo-
ien to the fame and like conditions, mutatis mutandis
n their fide: wherea«, air, thefe men, upon their
wn plealure,' on any.' occafion, may.forfake ihole

bildren, fufter them utterly to perifh. Now, Sir, ad.

obligation now to put a period to it; -which if you ne-
gleti to do, the guilt will be entirely on you alone. fines
it is certainly in nobody1 * power but yours, to alter their
condition. I tnuft confefs, I was fo dull, that I
thought he meant 1 fhould part them, and knowing
that this would put the whole iflancl in confulion, I
told him I could not confent to it upon any account
whatfoever. Sir, faid he, in a great furprife, Ida
not mean thityoufhouldfepa.ra.te, but marry them, by <t
written cintraf-t, Jigned by both man and woman. and
by all the -witnejjcs prefent, which all the European
laws decree to be offufficient efficacy. Amazed with
fuch true piety and iincerity, and confidering the
validity of a written contract, i acknowledged all
that he faid to be very juft and kind; and that I
would difcourfe with the men about it; neither
could I fee what reafon they could have not to let
him marry them, whofe authority in that aflair is
owned to be as authentic, as if they were married
by any of our clergymen in England. -'
The next complaint he had to make to me, was
this, that though thefe tnglifh fubjects of mine had
Iived with thele women feven years, and though
they were of good underrtanding, and capable of in.
ftruction, having learned not only to fpeak, but to
read . Englifh, yet all (his while they had never
taught them any thing of the Chriftian religion, or -
the knowledge of God, much lels in what manner
he ought to be ferved. And is not this an unaccount-
able negletl? faid he warmly. Depend upon it, God
almighty-will call them to account for fuch contempt. And
though I am not of your religion, yet IJboitld be glad to
fee thefe people releafedfrom the devil's power, and be
faved by the principles of the Chriitian religion, the
knowledge of Cod, of a Redeemer, the refurreftion, and
«i a futw ejlate. But as it h not too late, if you pleafe
to give me leave to inilrucl them, I doubt not but I
Jhallfupply this great tJefecl, by bringing them into the
, , -u -.'-. great
OJROI
great Cirde of Chrtftianity, even -whilt you continue i*
the ifland.
I could hold no longer, but embracing him,
told him, with a thoufand thanks, I would grant
whatever he requefted, and defired him to proceed
in the third article, which he did in the following
manner.
Sir, faid he, it fhould be a maxim among all Chri-
ftians, That Chrijlian knowledge ought to be propagated
by allpojjible means, «nd on all occafions. Upon this
account our church fends miffionaries intoPerfia, In-
dia, and China, men who are willing to die for the
fake of God and the Chriltian faith, in order to
bring poor infidels into the way of falvation. Now,
Sir, as here is an opportunity to convert feven and
thirty poor fsvages, I wonder how yoil can pals by
fuch an occafion of doing good, which is really
worth the expenfe of a man's whole life.
I muft confefs I was fo confounded at this dif-

While he was thus fpeaking, I could difcover a
rapture in his face, by his colour going and coming?
at the fame time his eyes fparkled like fire, with all
the figns of the moft zealous transports. And when
I afkcd whether he was in earneft; Sir, faid he, it
was to preach to the Indians, I confemed to come a-
long with you; thefe infidels, even in this little
ifland, are infinitely of more worth than my poor
life: if fo that I fhould prove the happy inftrument
of Hiving thefe poor creatures fouls, 1 care not if I
never fee my native country again. One thing I
only beg of you more, is, that you would leave
Friday with me, to be my interpreter, without
whoie affiltance neither of us will underhand, each.

This requeft very fenfibly troubled me, Crft, upon
Friday's being bred a proteftant, and fecondly, for
the affection I bore to him for his fidelity; but im-
mediately the remembrance of Friday's father com-'
ing into my head, I recommended him to him as ha-
ving learned Jipanifh, which the prieft allb under*
ftood; and fo was thoroughly Satisfied with him.
When we came to the Englifhnien, after I had told
them what neceflary things 1 had done for them, I
talked to them or the fcandalous life they led, told
them what notice the ciergyman had taken of it, and
afked them if they were married men or bachelors?
They anfwercd. two of them were widowers, and
the other three fingl« men. But, faid I, with what
lonfcience can you call thefe. your wives, by whom
you have lo many children, and yet are not lawfully
tnarried? I'iiey all faid,. that they took them before
the governor as such, having no.body elfe to marry
them, which they thought as legal, as if they had
L " had

•had a parfon. No doubt, faid I, but in the eye of
God you are fo: but unlefs 1 am affured of your ho-
iieft intent, never to defert thefe poor creatures, I
can do nothing mo-e for you, neither can you ex-
pect God's bleffing while you live in fuch aii open
courfe of- adultery. Hereupon Will. Atkins. who
-fpoke for the reft, told me, That they believed their
wives the moft innocent and virtuous creatures in
the world; that they would never forfake them
while they had breath: and that if there was a cler-
gyman in the (hip, they would be married to them
with all their heart. I told you before, faid I, that
I have a minifter with me, who fhall marry you
to morrow morning, if you are willing; fo I would
hive you confult to-night, with the reft, about it.
1 told him, the clergyman was a Frenchman, and
knew not a word of Englifh. but that 1 would aft as
a clerk between them. And indeed .this bufinefsmet
with fuch f,teedy fuccefs, that they all told me, in a
few minutes after, that they were ready to be tor-
irully married as foon as I pleafed; with which in-
forming the prieft, he was exceedingly rejoiced.
Nothing now remained, but that the women
Ihould be made fenfible of the meaning of the thing;.
with which being well fatiofied, they with their nul-
bands attended at my apartment the next mormng:
there was my prieft, habited in a black veft, fome-
think like a caffock, with a fa(h round it, much re-
fembling a minifter, and-I was his interpreter But
the.ferioufnefs of his behaviour, and the fcruplesne
made of marrying the women, who werer not bapn-
zed, gave them an exceeding reverence for hi per
fon : nor indeed would he marry them at all, uU he
obtained my liberty to difcourfe both with th men
and women, and then he told them, Tha , m thft

JSr, of fociety, they had lived m open adultery,

time enough to make them profefs the name of

befides, he believed themfelves very indifferent Chri-
(Hans: and confe'quently had not difcourfed with
their wives upon that fubject; and that unlefs they
promifed him to do To, he could .not marry them,
as being exprefsly forbidden by the laws of God.
All this they heard attentively, and owned readily;

at us, -who never yet have praSlifed religion, but on the

I, cannot you tell your wife, fhe is in the wrong,
and that her gods are idols, which can neither hear,
fpeak, nor underftand; but that our God, who has
made, can deftroy all things; that he rewards the
good, and puniflus the wicked; and at laft will
bring us to judgment? cannot you tell her thefe
things? That's true, faid Atkins, but then fhe'll tell
me it is utterly falfe, fince I am not punifhed and
lent to the devil, who hath been fuch a wicked crea-
ture. Tnefe words I interpreted to the prieft: O!

Very good minifter to his fpoufe, and quality him to
preach on the mercy and long-fuffering of a merciful
Being, who defires not the death of a (inner, and
even defers damiiAiion to the laft judgment; this
will lead him to the doctrine of it, and will make
him an excellent preacher to his wife. I repeated
this to Atkins, who, being more than ordinarily af-
fected with it, replied, I know all this, Sir, and a
great dml more; but how can. 1 have the impudence
to talk thus to my wife, when my confcience wit"

he, what I mean; I mean it is too late.
When I told the prieft what he faid, the poor af-
fectionate man could not refrain from weeping ; but
recovering himfelf, pray, S.ir, faid he, njk him if he
is contented that it is too late; or is he cariCfrned, and

him repentance, if he has recourfe to the merit of his
pnjjion. Does he think he is ley and the poiuer of di*

found it true; for coming to the edge of the wood,
we perceived Atkins and his favage wife fitting under
the lhade of a bufh, in very earnef t difcourfe; he
pointed to the fun, to the quarters of the earth, to
liimfelf, to her, the wood, and the trees. Immediately
we could perceive him ftart upon his feet, fall down
upon his knees, aud lift up both his hands; at which

the tears ran down my clergyman's cheeks: but our
great misfortune was, we could not hear one word
that pa(Ted between them. Another time he would
embrace her, wiping the tears from her eyes, kiffing
her with the greateft tranfports, and then both kneel
down for fome minutes together. Such raptures of
joy did this occafion in my young prieft, that ha
could fcarcely contain himfelf: And a little after
this, we obferved by her motion, as frequently lift-
ing up her hands, and laying them on her breaft,
that fhe was mightily affected with his difccurfe, and
rfb (hey withdrew fiom our fight.
'Wrfen tye came back, we found them boili wair-

Such a furprhing account as this was, proved very •'

not talk to her himfelf. Sir, faid he, there is fome-
thing more to be done to this woman than to marry'
her : I mean, that fhe ought to be baptized. To •

Chrift, the falvation of finners, the nature gf faiili'
and redemption in and by hun, of the Holy Spirit, .
the refurreflion, la.ft judgment, and a future-ftate :'•

faying, that he had faid fomething to her of thefe
things, -but his inability to talk of them, made him
afraid left her knowledge of them fhotild rather
make her contemn religion, than be benefited by
it: but that if I would difcourfe with her, it would
be very evident, my labour would not be m vaift.
Accordingly I called her in, and placing myfelf as
interpreter between the religious prieft and the v.'0-
xnan, I entreated him toga on: but furely never was
fuch a fermon preached by any clergyman in thefe
latter days, with fo much zeal, knowledge and .fin-
ceruy; in fiiort, he brought the woman to embrace
the knowledge of Chrift, and of redemption by him,
with fo furpnfing a degree of underftanding, that
ihz made it her own requeft to be baptized.
He then performed his office in the lacramen: of
baptifm, firft by faying fome words over to himfelf
in Latin, and then afliing me to give her a name, as
being her godfather, and pouring a whole dim full
of water upon the woman's head, he faid, MARY,
I baptize thee in the name of the Father, and of the
Son, and of the Holy Ghoft; fo that none could
know of what religion he was. After this he pro-
nounced the benediction in Latin. Thus the woman
being made A Chriftian, he married her to Will. At-
kins, which being finifhed, he affectionately exhort-
ed him to lead a hoiy life for the future; that fince
the Almighty, by the convictions of his confcience,
had honoured him to be the inftrument of his wife's
converfion, he fhould not difhonour'the grace^of
God, that while the favage was converted, the in-
iftruroent fhould be caft away. Thus ended a cere-
inony, to me the moft pleafant and agreeable I ever
paSed in my life. -,
The affairs of the ifl ind being fettled, I was pre-
paring to go on board, whea the young man (whole
mother was ftarved) came to me, laying, that as he
underftood I had a clergyman with me, who had
married the En^lifhmen with favages, he had a

match to make betwee.n two Chriflians, which he
d^fired might be finifhed before I departed. Think--
ing that it was he himfelf that had courted his mo-
ther's maid, 1 perfuaded him not to do any thing
rafhly upon the account of his folitary circumftances;
that the maid was an unequal match for him both'
. in refpect-to fubftance and years; and that it was
very probable he would live to return to his own:
country, where he might have a far better choice.
At thefe words, fmiling, he interrupted me, thank-
ing me for my good advice ;.that as he had nothing to
beg of me, but a fmall fettlement, with a fervent or
two, or fom,e few neceflaries; fo he hoped I would
not be unmindful of him when I returned to Eng-
land, .but give his letters to his. friends; and that
when he was redeemed, the plantation and all its
improvements, however valuable, fhould be returned
to me again. But as for the marriage he propofed*
that h was not himfelf, but that it was between my.'
Jack of all trades, and the maid Sufan.
1 was indeed agreeably furprifcd at the mentioning;
this match, which feerned very fuitable, the pne be-
ing a very ingenious fellow, and the other .an ex-
cellent, dexterous, and fenfible houfewife, fit to be
governefs of the whole ifland: To we married them
the fame day; and as I was her father,' and gave
her away, fo I gave her a handfome portion, appoint-
ing her and her hufband a convesiem large fpace of
ground for their plantation. The fharing out of the
land I left to Will. Atkins, who really divided .it
very juftly, to every perfon's fatisfaction: they only
defired one general writing under my hand for the'
whole, which I caufed to be drawn up, figned, and
fealed to them; fetting out their bounds, and giving
them a right to the whole po'Ieffion of their relpec-
tive plantations, with their improvements, to them and
their heirs, referring ail the reft of the ifland as my
own property, and a certain rent for every particular ,'
plantation after eleven years. As to their laws and go,- -
L 6- -vernmenti ,
vernmem, I exhorted them to love one another: SflS
as to the Indians who lived in a nook by themftlves,
I allotted three or four of them plantations, and the
rcft^willingly chofe to become fervants to the other
families, by which means they were "employed in
tifeful labour, and fared much beiter than they did
before. Buildes, the favages being thus mixed with
the Chriftians, the work of their converfion might
t>t fet on foot by the latter, hi the clergyman's ab-
lence, to our equal fatisfaction. The young prieft?
however, was a little anxious, left the Chriftians
fhould not be willing to do their parts in inftruft-
ing thofe poor Indians: I therefore told him, we
ihould call them all together; fhat he fhould fpeak
to the Spaniards who were Papifts, and I to the
Jinglifh who were proteftants, and make them pro-
niile that they would never make any diftinction in
religion, but teach the general true knowledge of
God, and his Son Jefus.Chrift, in order to convert
the poor favages-: and this indeed they all promifed
us accordingly.
When I came to Will. Atkins's houfe, I found his
baptized wife, and the young woman newly marrkd
to rny Jack of all trades, were become great inti-
tnates, and difcourfing of religion together. 0 Sir,
ifays Will. Atkins, when God has finners to reconcile
to himfelf, he never wants an inftructor: I knew I
•vvas unworthy for fo good a work, and therefore
this young woman has been fent hither as it were
-from heaven, who is fufficient to convert a whole
Jfland of favages. The young woman blufhed, and
^as going to rife; but 1 deIired her to fit ftill, and
looped that God would blefs her in fo good a work:
ar>d then pulling out a bible, (which I brought on
•purpose in my pocket for him), Here, Atkins, faid I,
liere is an affiftant that perhaps you had not before.

then heard us, and now has fent it. 1 he woman
was furprifed, and thought really God had fent that
individual book fr6m heaven; but I turned to the
•young woman, and defired her to explain to the new
convert, that God may'properly be faid to anfwer
our petitions, when in the courfe of his providence
fuch particular things come to pafs as we petitioned
for. This the young woman did effectually ; but'
furely Will. Atkins's joy cannot be cxprefTed no man
being more thankful for any thing in the world, than
he was for his Bible, nor defired it from a better
principle.
After feveral religious difcourfes, I defired the
young woman to give ire an account of the anguifh
.fhe felt when fhe was ftarviug to death for hunger;
to which fhe readily confented, and began Jo th'e
following manner.
"Sir, "faid (he," all our victuals being gone,
after 1 had fafted one day, my ftomach was very
fickifh, and at the approach of night, J was iRcl'med.
to yawning, and fleepy. When I'flept upon the
couch three hours, I awaked a little refrefhed : three
hours after my ftomach being more and more fickifh,
I lay down again, but "could not fleep, being -Very
faint and ill. Thus I pafied the fecond day with a
ftrange variety, firft hungry, then lick again, wifh
retchings to vomit: that night I dreamed I was at
Barbadoes, buying plenty of provifions, and dined
heartily. But when I awaked, my fpirits were ex-
ceedingly funk to find myfelf in the extremity df
famine. There was but one glafs of wine, which
being mixed with fugar, I drank up; but for want
of fubftance 10 digeft upon, the fumes of it got into
my head, and made me fenfelefs for fome time. The
third day 1 was fci ravenous and furious, that I could
have eaten a little child if it had come in my way:

but leaving them in a flourifhing condition, with a .
promife to fend them further relief from Brazil, as
fheep, hogs, and cows, (being obliged to kill the lat-
ter at fea, having no hay to feed them), I went on
board the fhip again, the firft of May 1695, after
. having been twenty days among them: and next
morning, giving them a falute of five guns at parting,
we fet fail for the Brazils. The third day, towards
evening, there happening a calm, and the current
b;ing very ftrong, we were drove to the N. N. E. to-
wards the land. Some hours after we perceived the
fea covered as it were with fomething very black, not
eafily at fir ft to be di(covered : upon which our chief
mate afcentling the fhrouds a little way and taking a
view wi h a perfpective glafs, he cries out, an Army!
An army, you fool, faid I, what do you mean ? Nay,
Sir, faid he, don't be angry, I affure you it is not
only an army, but a fleet too; for I believe there
are a thoufand canoes paddling along, and making
with grea..t hafte towards us.
Indeed every one of us were furprifed at this rela-
tion; and my nephew the captain could not tell what
to think of it, but thought we fhould all be devoured.
Nor was I free from concern, when I confidered how
much we were becalmed, and what a ftrong current
fet towards the fhore: however, I encouraged him
not to be afraid, but bring the fhip to an anchor, as
foon as we were certain that we muft engage them.
Accordingly we did fo, and furled all our fails: as to
the favages, we feared nothing, but only that they
might fet the fhip on fire; to prevent which, I order-
ed them to get their boats out, and faften them, one
clofe by the head, and the other by the ftern, well
manned, with flceets and buckets to extinguifh the
flames, fhould it fo happen. The favages loon came
up wiih us, but there were not fo many as the mate
had faid ; for inftead of a thoufand canoes, there were

our people took up, fwimming for his lire, an hour
after. He was very fallen at firft, fo that he would
neither eat nor fpeak: but I took a way to cure him,
by ordering them to throw Uim into the fea,- which
they did, and then he came fwirhming back like a
cork, calling in his tongue, as I fuppofe, to favehim.
So we took him on board, but it was a long time be-
fore we could make him fpeak or underfhvnd Engliih;
yet when we had taught him, he told us, they were
going with their kings to fight a great battle: and
when we afked him, what made them come up to us;

be noted, that thofe natives, and thofe of Africa,
always add two #'s at the end of Englifh words, as
makee, takee, and the like, from which it is a very
difficult thing to make them break off.
Being now under fail, we took our laft farewell of
poor honeft Friday, and interred him with all poffible
decency and folemnity; putting him into a c. ffin«
and committing him to the deep, at the fame time
caufing eleven guns to be fired for him. Thus end*

At this place my truly honift and pious clergy-

fure you, it was with the greateft reluctancy I parted
from a perfon, whofe virtue and piety merited the
greateft efteem.
From the Brazils we made directly over the Atlantic
ocean to the Cape of Good Hope, having a tolerable
good voyage, fteering for the moft part S. E. We
were on a trading voyage, and had a fupercargo on
board, who was to direct all the fhip's motions after
fhe arrived at the Cape ; only being limited to a cer-
tain number of days, for ftay, by charter party, at
the feveral ports fhe was to go to. At the Cape we
only took in frelh water, and then failed for the
coaft of Coromandfcl: we were there informed, that a
French man of war. of 50 guns, and two large mer-
chant-fhips, were failed for the Indies, but we heard
no.more of them.
In our pillage we touched at the ifland of Mada-
gafcar, where, though the 'inhabitants are naturally
fierce an4 treacherous, and go conftantly armed with
bows a.nd lances, yet for fome time they treated us
civilly enough; and, in exchange for knives, fciflars,
and other ftiHes, they brought us eleven good fat bul-
locks, which we took p irtly for prefent f refii victuals,
and the remainder to fait for the (hip's ufe.

traded among us for fuch toys as we had, with fuch

when our men came plunging themfelves into the
water, with about four hundred of the iflandcrs at
their h.els. We took up ieven of the men, three of
them very much wounded, and one left behind killed,
while the enemy poured their arrows fo thick among
us, that we were forced to make a barricade, with
boards lying at the fide of the boat, tofhield us from
danger: and having got ready our fire arms, we re-
turned tbem a volley which wounded feveral of them,
-ias we could hear by their cries. In this condition

- one of the men taking the end of a tow line in his
hand, and keeping our boat between him and our
adverfaries, fwam on board us, and made faft our
line to the boat; upon this, ffipping our cables, they
towed us out of the reach of their arrows, and quick-
ly after, a broadfide was given them from the fhip,
^ which made a moft dreadful havock among them..
When we got on board, we examined into the occa-
fion of this fray; the men who fled informed us, that
an old woman, who fold milk within the poles, had
brought a young woman with her, who carried roots
or herbs, the fight of whom fo much tempted our
men, that they offered rudenefs to the maid, at which
the old woman fet up a great cry; ncr would the
failors part from the prize, but carried her among
the trees, while the olci woman went, and brought a
whole army down upon them. At the beginning of the
attack one of our men was killed with a lance, and the
fellow, who began the mifchitf, p iid dear enough for
his miftrels, though as yet we did not know what
had become of him; the reft luckily eicaped. The.

hours before midnight, at tae lame place where fhofe
Indians itood the nigiit before, and there we divided
our men into two bodies, uie b 'attwain commanding
one, and I another. It vv.is fo dark, that we could
fee nobody, neither did we hear my voice near us:
but by and by the boarhvain falling over a dead bo-
dy, we agreed to halt till ihe moon (houldiiie, which,
we knew would be in an hour afur. We perceived,
here no fewer than two and ihirty bodies, upon the
ground, whereof two were not quite dead. Satisfied;
witl*
with this difcovery, I was for going on board again)
but the boatfwain, and the reft told me, they would
make a vifit to the Indian town, where thofe dogs, fo
they called them, refided, afking me at the fame time
to go along with them; for they did not doubt, be-
fides getting a good booty, but they fhould find Tom
Jeffery there, for that was the unhappy man we mif-
fed. But I utterly refufed to go, and commanded
them back, being unwilling to hazard their lives, as
the fafety of the fhip wholly depended upon them.
Notwithllanding all i could Iay to them,. they allleft
me but one, and the fupercargo: fo we three return-
ed to the boat, where a boy was left, refolvingtoftay
till they returned. At parting 1 told them I fuppoled
rnoA of them would run the fame fate with Tom
Jeffery. To this they replied, Cove, loys, come along,
-we'll warrant we'll come off fafe enough: and fo away
they went, notwithftanding all my admonitions, ei-
ther concerning their own fafety, or the prefervation
of the fhip. Indeed they were gallantly armed, e-
very man having a mufket, bnyonet and a piftol, be-
iides cutlafles, hangers, pole-axes, and hand grana-
does. They came to a few Indian houles at firft,
which not being the town they expected, they went
farther, and finding a cow tied to a tree, they con-
cluded that fhe would be a fufficient guide, and fo it
proved; for after they untied her, (lie led them di-
rectly to the town, which confifted of about two hun-
dred houfes, feveral families living in fome of the huts
together. At their arrival, all being in a profound
deep, the failors agreed to divide themfelvts into
three bodies, and fet three parts of the town on
fire at once, to kill thofe that were efcaping, and
plunder the reft of the houfes. Thus defperately re-
folved, they went to work; but the firft party had
Oot gone far, before they called out to the reft, that
they had found Tom Jeffery; whereupon they all ran

had been concerned in the fray, two 01 three of them

houfe they fet on fire fir ft, and in a few minutes after
five or fix places more in the town appeared inflames.
The conflagration fpread like wild fire. their houfes
being all of wood, and covered with flags or rufous.
The poor affrighted inhabitants endeavoured to run
out to fave their lives, but they vrere diiven back in-
to the flames by the failors, and killed without mer-
cy. At the firft houfe abovemenuon. d. after the boat-
fwaiu had flain two wiih his pole-axe, he threw a
hand granado into the houfe, which burfting, made a
terrible havock, killing and wounding moft of them;
and their king and moft of his train, who were then
in that houfe, fell victims to their fury, every crea-
ture of them being either fmothered 01 burnt. All
this while they never fired a gun, left the people fhould
awaken fafter than they could overpower them. But
the fire awakened them faft enough, which obliged
our fellows to keep together in bodies. By this time
the whole town was in a flame, yet'their fury rather
increafed, calling out to one another to remember
Totn Jcffeiy. The terrible light of this conflagration
made me -very unealy, and roufed my nephew the
captain, and the reft of his men, who knew nothing
of the matter. When he perceived the dreadful imcke)
and heard the guns go off. he readily concluded his

if fuc.h can merit your clemency; and with that he
fhewed me the poor fellow, with his throat cut,
hanging upon the tree.
Indeed here was enough to fill their breads with
rage, which however I thought had gone too far,
agreeable to thefe words of Jacob to his fbns Simeon
ami Levi ; Cur Jed be their anger, for it tvasfierce ; and
their wrath, for it was cruel. But this fight made
my nephew and the reft as bad as they; nay, my
nephew declared, his concern was only for his menl;
as for the people, not a foul of them ought to live.
Upon this the feoatfwain and eight more directly
turned about, and went to finifh the intended tra-
gedy: which being out of my power to prevent, I
returned back both from the difmal fight, and the
piteous cries of thofe unfortunate creatures, who
were made victims to their fury. Indeed it was an
egregious piece of folly in me to return to the boat
with but one attendant; and I had very near paid
for it, having narrowly efcaped forty armed Indians,
who had been alarmed by the conflagration; blU
having pafled the place Where they flood, I got to

went on board, fending the pinnace b.ick again, to

as I afterwards found, was our men falling upon
thole -.oufes and perfons that ftofnl between them

.children, and killed only the men, to the number of
about lixteen or fevemeen. By the time they got to
,the fhore, the pinnace and the fhip's boat were rea-
.f)y to receive thtm, and they all got fafe on board,
not a man of them having received the leaft hurt,
except two, one of whom (trained his foot, and the
.Other burnt his hand a little; for they met with no
i-efiftance, the poor Indians being unprepared, a-
inazed, and confounded.
1 was extremely angry with every one of them,
but particularly with the captain, who, inftead of
Cooling the rage of the men, had prompted them on
to farther mifchief: nor could he make me any
other excufe but that as he was a man he could not
it)after his paffions, at the fight of one of his men
^b cruelly murdered. As for the reft, knowing they
^rere not under my command, they took no notice
of my anger; but rather boafted of their revenge.
According to all their accounts, they killed or de-
greyed about one hundred and fifty men, women,
i,r)d children, befides burning the town to afhes.
,Jfh'ey took their companion Tom Jeflery from the
tree, covered him with fome of the ruins, and fo left

feetn. to them juftifiable, yet I always openly con-
Jemned it, with the appellation of The majfacre of
jMadagaicar, For though they had flain this Jeflery,
yet certainly he was the firft aggreffor, by attempt-
fng ro violate the chaftity of a young innocent wo-
inan, who ventured down to them on the faith of
tlie public capitulation, which was fo trcarheroufly
broken.

'While we were under fail, the boatfwain would
often defend this bloody action, by faying, That the
Indians had broke the truce the night btfare, by fleeting
one cf cur men u- -hut iuil provocation: and -what if
the poor fello-w had taken a little liberty \viih the -wench,
h'e ought not to have been murdered in fa villanom *
manner: and that they had afted nothing but what tlx
divine laws commifjiaritd to be done to fuch Jiomkides.
However, I was in the fame mind as before, telling
them that they were murderers, and bid Kim depend
upon't, that God would blaft their voyage for luck
an unparallelled piece of barbarity.
When we came into the gulf of Perfia, five of our
men, who ventured on fhore, were either killed or
made fl.ives by the Arabians, the reft of them having
fcarce time to efcape to their boat. This made me
upbraid them afrefh with the juft retribution of hea-
ven for fuch actions: upon which the boatfwain ve-
ry warmly alked me, whether thofe men on whom
the tower of Siloauv fell, were greater finners than
the reft of the Galileans ? and befides, Sir, faid he,
none of thefe five poor men that are loft were with
us at the maffacre of Madagafcar, as you call it,
and therefore your reprehenlion is very unjuft, and
your application improper. Beiides, added he, you
are continually ufing the men very ill, upon this ac-
count, and being but a paflenger yourlelf, we are
not oblige d to bear it; nor can we tell what ill de-
figns you may have to bring us to judgment for it
in EngLind; and therefore if you do not leave this
diicourle, as alio not concern yourfelf with any of
our aflairs, I will leave the fhip, and not fail among
fuch dangerous company.
All this I heard very p.itiently; but it being often
repeated. I at length told him, the concern I hatl on
board was none of his bufinefs; that I was a confi-
derable owner in the fhip, and therefore had a right
to fpeak in common, and that I was no way 'ac-
countable to him, nor to any body elfe. As no
M « more
more pafled for fome time after, I thought all had
.been over. At this time we were in' the road of
.Bengal, where, going on fhore with the fupgrcargo,
one day, in ihe evening, as I was preparing to go
on board, one of the men came to me, and told me,
I needed not trouble myfelf to come to the boat, for
rbat the cockfwain and others had ordered him not
to carry me on board any more. This infolent mef-
fage much furprifed me; yet I gate him no anfwer
to it, but went directly and acquainted the fupercar-
go, entreating him to go on board, and, by acquaint-
ing r»e captain with it, prevent the mutiny which I
perceived would happen. But before I had fpoken
this. fhe matter was efftcted on board : for no loon-
^r was he gone off in the boat, but the boatfwain,
runner, carpenter, and all the inferior officers,
C3rne to the quarterdeck, defiring to fpeak with the
Cfiptain; and there the boatfwain made a long ha-
rangue, exclaiming againft me, as before mention-
e j; that if I had not gone afhore peaceably for mi
f)vvn diverfion, they by violence would have com-
pelled me for their fatisfa&ion; that as they had
Dipped with the captain, fo they would faithfully
ferve him; but if 1 did not quit the fhip, or the
captain oblige me to it, they would leave the flvp
inedlately; hereupon, turning his face about by
of fignal, they all cried out, ONE and ALL,
£ and ALL.
Vou may be fure, that though my nephew was a
in of great courage, yet he could not but be fur-
.,1-ifed at their fudden and unexpected behaviour:
-ind though he talked ftoutly to them, and after-
^ards expoftulaied with them, that in common
- u(lice to me, who was a confiderable owner in the
"ifiip, they could not turn me as it were, out of my
ov*rn houfe, which might bring their lives in danger,
Jliould they ever be taken in England: nay, though
he. invited the boatfwain on (hore to accommodate
^alters with ire, yet all this, I fry, fignificd nothing:

done: and fo he came to me, giving me an account
of-their refolution, how one and atl dcfigned to for-

was mightily concerned. I am glad to fee you, ne-

fum of mor.ey, and I will find my way to England,
as well as lean. Though this grieved my nephew
to the heart, yet there was no remedy but compli-
ance; in fhort, all my necefiaries were lent me, and-
fo this matter was over in- a few- hours..
I think I was now near. a thoufand leagues farther
off England by feai than at my little kingdom, ex.^;
cept this difference, that I might travel by hnd over
the Great Mogul's country-to Surat, from thence up-
to Baffbra, by fea up the Perfian gulf, then take the
way of the caravans over the Arabian defert to A-
leppo and Scanderoon, there take fhipping to Italy,
and fo travel by land into France, and from thence
crofs the fea to England..
My nephew- left me two perfons to attend me;
one of them. was his fervanr, and the other clerk
to the purfer, who engaged to be mine. I took lodg-
ings in an Englifh woman's houfe, where feveial
French, one Englifh, and two Italian merchants re-
•fukd.. The handfome entertiinment I met with
here, occafioned me to (lay nine months confidering
what courfe I fhould take. Some Englifh goods i
had with me of great v,ilue, befidts a thoufand pieces
of eight, and a letter of cndence for more, if there

One morning the Englifli merchant came to me, as

This propofal foon got my content, being very a-
greeable to my rambling genius, and the more fo,
fcecaufe I looked upon my countryman to be a very
£ncere peifon : it required fome time before we could
get a veffel to our mind, and failors to man it ac-
cordingly: at length we bought a Ihip, and got an
Jinglifh mate, boatfwairi, and gunner, a DutCB car-
penter, and three Portuguefe foremaft men; and,
for want of others, made fhift with Indian feamen.
-W"e firft failed to Achin, in the ifland of Sumatra,
.pod then to Siam, where we bartered our wares for
fame arrack and opium, the laft of which bore a

to Suffc.in, making a very great voyage; and,
cr eight months time, I returned to Bengal, verir
iv-ell fatisfied with this adventure, having not only
f.ot a fufficicm quantity of money, but an infight of-
,retting a great deal more.

Not long after my friend and I had made up our
accounts, to our entire fatisfaftion, there came in a-
Dutch coafter from Batavia, of about two hundred.
tons. The crew of this vefTel pretended themfelves
£b Gckly, that there were not hand- fufficient to
undertake a voyage; and the captain' having given
out that he hueiuU-d to go to Europe, public notice
was given th.it the (hip was to be fold. No fooner
did this come to our ears, but we bought the (hip,
paid the mafter, aml took poffeffion. We would a!ib
have very willingly entertained fome of the men;
but they, having received their fhare of booty, were
not to be found, being all together fled to Agra, the
great-city of theMogul's refidtnce; and from thence
were to travel to Surat, and fo by fea to the Perfian
gulf. And indeed they had. reafon to fly in this
manner: for the truth of it was, the pretended Cap-
tain was the gunner only, and not the commander j
that "having been en a trading.voyage, they were at-*
tacked on fhore by the Malayans, who killed three
men, and the captain; after whofe death the other
eleven men run away with the fhip to the bay of
Bengal, and left the mate and five men more on
fhore; but of this affair we fhall have occafion to
fpeak at more leng'h hereafter.
However they came by the ihip, we thought we
bought it honeftly; neither did we fufpect any thing
of the matter; when the man (hewed us a bill of
fak for the fhip (undoubtedly forged) to one Ema-
uuel Clofterfhoven, which name he went by. And fo,
without any more toilo, we picked up tome Dutch
and Eoglifh feamen, refolving for another voyage for

iprung a leak, which obliged us to put into the
river Cambodia, which lies northward of the gulf,
and.goes up to Siam.
One day as. 1 was on fhorc refrefhfng myfelf, there
comes to me an Englifhman, who was a gunner's

ivas called, who immediately ordered the anchor to

jet being afililed with a little land brctze, we ftood
out to fea, I then called my pariner into the cabin,
:ind related the ftory at hrge, v.'hich was confirmed,
«nd more amplified by the two men 1 had brought
on board. Scarce had we finifhed our difcourfe, up-
cn this head, but a failor came to the cabin door,
with a meffage from the captain, that we were
chafed by five floeps ful! of armed men. Very we!!,
f.iid I, it is plain now there is fomething in it. And
fo going upon deck, 1 told all the mea there was a
tkfign for feizing the fhip, and of executing us for
pirates; and aiked them, whether they would faith-
fully ftand by us, and by one another ? To which
they unanimoufly replied, that they fhould fight to
their laft drop of blood. I then aiked the captain,
which way he thought beft for us to manage the
battle? Sir, faid he, the only method is to keep themtff
with cur great fat as long as -we are atte, and then have
recourfe to cur fmall arms; and -when bath thrfeftilus,
then retire to chfe quarters, when perhaps the^ enemy,
wanting m.iterials, can n.ilberb'eikopen cur tulkkails,
r.or get in upon us, Mean time the gunner was or-
ikred to bring two guns to bear fore and aft out of
the fieerage, and fo load them with mufket hullets,
:-.nd fmall pieces of old iron'; and the deck being
cleared, we prepared for the engagement, ftill how-

with all the fail they could make, End we could per-
ceive the two foreraoft were Knglifh, which ouifailsd
the reft by two leagues, and which we found would
come up with us: hereupon we fired a gun without

put out a flag of truce, as a fignal for parley; but
finding them crouding after us, till they came with-
in (hot, we took in our whit«, and hanging out the
.red-fiag, immediately Cted at them with ball: we
then called to them with a fpeaking trumpet, bid-
ding them at- their peril keep <.;&".
But all this fignified nothing; for, depending up-
on the ftrength that followed them, they were vefb-
lutely bent for mifchief: hereupon I ordered them to'
bring the (hip. to, by which means, they lying upon .
our broad fide, we let fly at them at once, one of
viiom carried away the ftern of the hindermoft boat,
and obliged them not only to take down their fail,
but made them all run to the head of the boat, to
keep them from finking; and fo fhe lay by, having .
enough of it. In the mean time ve prepared to •
welcome the foremoft boat in the fame manner.
While we were doing this, one of the three hinder-

difabled, and took the men out of her. We agnhi

LIFE AND ADVENTURES
reft of their boats were approaching: according^
they did fo, and took. np three of them, one of
vhom was almoft paft.recovery; and then crouding
alt the f.iii we could, after our men came on board,
we ftood out farther to fea, fo that the other three.
boats gave over their chace, vvhentheycameupto
ibe firft two. Thus delivered from imminent dan-
ger, wo changed our courfe to the eaftward, quite
out of the courfe of all European fhips.
Being now at fea, and inclniring more particularly
of the two .fearuen, the meaning of all this, the
Dutchman, at once, .let us into the fecret. He tokl
us, that the fellow who fold us the (hip was an ar-
rant thief, who had run away with her; that the
••captain was treacherously murdered on. the coaft of
Malacca by ihe natives there, with three of his men;
that he,.the Dutchman, and four more, being obli-
ged to have recourfe to the woods for their fafcy,
at length efcaped by means of a Dutch (hip, in its
way to China, .which had fent their boat on. fbore
for frefh water. That, after this he went to iiatavia,
where two of.the fearaen belonging tothe.fhip (who-
had deferted the reft .in their travels) arrived, and
there gave an account that the. fellow who -ran away
with-the (hip had' fold her at. Bengal to a fet of pi-
rates, who went a cruifing, and had already taken
one Englifh and two Dutch fhips, richly laden.

have expected nothing. from them but immediate
death, conlidcring our accufers would have been our

partner's opinion; but when I had more ferioufly
confidered of ihie matter,. I told him we ran a greac
hazard in attempting to return, being on the wrong
fide of the ftrarts of Malacca, and that if, upon a-
larm given, we fhould be taken by the Dutch of Ba-
tavia, or blnglifh elfewhere, our running away would
be a fufikient evidence tt> condemn us. This danger
indeed itartled not only my partner, but likewife all
the (hip's company; <b we changed our former re-
lolmion, and rei'olved to go to the roaft of Tonquirv,
and fo to that of China, where puriuing our firit de-
fign as to trade, we might likewife have an oppor-
tunity to dilpofe of the fhip fome way or other, and
to return to Bengal in any country veflel we could
procure. This being agreed to, we fteered aw:./ N.
N. E. about ;o leagues off the ufual courfc to the
eaft, which put us to fome inconveniencies. As the
wind blew iteadily againft us, our voyage became
very tedious, and we began to be afraid of want of
proviiion; and what was llill worfe, we apprehended,
. that as thole Ihips, from whofe boats we had efcaped',
were bound to China, they might get before ITS, and
haw given frcfh information, which might create
another vigorous purfuit. Indeed I could not help be-
ing grieved, when I confidered that I, who had never
wronged or defrauded any perfon in my. life, was
now purfued like acommon thief; and, if taken,
to run the greateft. danger of being executed as
fuch; and, though innocent, I found myfelf under
the neceffity of flying for my lafeiy, and thereby e-
i'cape being brought ta fhame, of which 1 was even
more afraid than of death itfclf. It was eafy to re; il
my dejection in my countenance. My mind was ep-
prefled, like thote unhappy innocent perfons, who
being overpowered by blalphea-.ous and perjured evi-
dences, wickedly rdblved to take away their lives,
or riiia thtir reputation, have no other recourfc in
this world to eale their forrow, but iighs, prayers,
and tears. JVJy partner feeing mt'fo concerned, en-

couraged me as well as he could: -and -after dcfcri-
bing to me the fcveral ports of that coaft. he told me,
he would either put in on «he coift of Cochinchina,
or elfe iii the biy of Tonquin, from whence we might
go to Macao, a town once pofilffid by thePortuguefe,
and where ftill many European families rcfided.
To this place we fieered, and early next morning
.camtf in fight of the coaft; but thought it advifeable
to put into a fmall river, where we could, either
over land, or by the (hip's pinnace, know what vef-
fels were in any ports thereabouts. This happy ftep
proved our deliverance; for nrxt morning there
tame to the biy of Tonquin two Dutch (hips, and a-
third without any colours; and in the evening two
J.n-/!fh fhips fleered the f.ime courfe. The river
•where we were, was but fmall, and run but a few
leagues up the country northwaid: the country was-
vrild and barbarous, and the people thieves, having.
no correfpondence with any other nation, dealing
only in fifh, oil, and fuch profs commodities; and
.one barbarous cuflom they ftill retained is, that when:
any veffel was unhappily fhipwrecked upon their
coaft, they make the men pri£oners or flaves; fo
that now we might fairly fay we were furro-undtd by-
•enemies both by fea and land.
As the fhip had been leaky, we took the opportu-
nity, in this place, to fearch her, and to ftop up the
places which let in the water. We accordingly- .
lightened lier, and bringing our guns and other
yrioveable things to one fide, we efftyed to bring her
<Jown, that we might come at her bottom: but, up-
f)fi fecond confideration, we did not think it fafe to •
iet her lie on dry ground, neither indeed was the
place convenient for it. The inhabitants, not ufed
Jo fuxh a fight as to fee a fhip lie down on one fide,
ar>d Ueel in towards the fhore, not perceiving her
i, who were at work on her bottom, with ftages
boats on the off" fide, prefently imagined the fhip
.been caft away, and lay fall on the ground.

Agreeable to this fuppofition, they furrounded .us
with ten or twelve large boats, with a refolution,
undoubtedly, to plunder the fliip, and to carry away
thole they found alive for (lives to their king. But
when they perceived our men hard at work on the
Jhip's boitom and fide, wafhing, graving and flop-
ping her, it filled them all uich Inch furprifc, that
.they flood gazing ns though they were confounded,
hior could we imagine what their defign was; how-
ever, for fear of danger, we handed down arms and
ammunition to thofe at v;ork, in order to defend
themfelv.es; and indeed this precaution was abfo-
lutely neceflary; for in- a quarter of an hour after,
the natives, concluding it was really a fhipwreck,
and that we were faving our lives and goods, which
they thought belonged to them, came down upon
our men, as though it had been in a line of battle.
We lay at prefent but in a very unfit pofture to fight;
and before the ftages could be got down, or the men
in the boat come on board as they were ordered, the
Cochinchinefes were upon them, and two of their
boats boarding our longboat, they began to lay hold
of our men as prifoners. The firft they fcized was
a ftout Englifh failor, who never fired his mulket,
like a fool, as I imagined, but laid it down in the
boat; but he knew what he was doing; for by main
force he dragged the pagin out of the boat into ours
by the two ears, and knocked his brains out againft
the boat's gunnel: a Dutchman ihat was next him
(hatched up the mufket, and knocked down fiv«
more with the butt end of it: however, this was
doing very little'to their nun.ber; but a flrange un-
expected accident, which rather merits laughter than
any thing clfe, gave our men a complete victory o-
ver them.

and f'icli ftuff as the fhipwrights ufe: the carpenter's
man had a great iron laddie with which he ufed to
fupply the workmen with h'ot ftuff, and as two of
the enemies entered the boat where the fellow flood,
he faluted them with a full laddie of the hot boiling
liquor, which, the poor creatures being half naked,
made them roar out, and jump into the fea. Welli
done, Jack,. fays the carpenter, give them the other

and dipping it into the pitch pot, he and his man fo
plentifully flung it among them, as that none e-
fcaped being fcalded: upon which they all made the

frightful manner, that in all my adventures I never.
heard- the like. And indeed never was I better
pleafed with any conqueft than I was with this, there
being fo little bloodfhed, and having an averfion to .
killing fuch favage wretches, (more .than was ne-
ceflary), as knowing they came on errands, which
their laws and cuftoms made them think were juft:

pilot on board, who offered his fervice; we very
gladly accepted him, and fern the boat back again.
And now, having the old man on board, I talked to
him of going to Nanquin, the moft northward part
of the coal! of China. What will you do there?
f.iid he, fmiling. I told him we would fell our cargo,
and purchafe calicoes, raw and wrought (ilks, tea
he. and fo return the fame way back. O, faid he,
you had better put in at Macao, where you may buy
China wares as cheap as at Nanquin, and fell your
opium at a greater advance. But, faid I, we are
gentlemen as well as merchants, and defign to fee
the great city of Pekin, and the magnificent eOurt of
the monarch of China. Why then, faid he, you
fhould goto Ningpo, wherethere is a navigable river
that goes through the heart of that vaft empire, two
hundred and feventy leagues from the fea, which
crofles all the rivers, pafles couiiderable hills, by the
help of the fluices and gates, and goes even up to
the city of Pe.kin. You .may go to Nanquin, if you
pleafe, and travel to Pekin,^and there is a Dutch fhip
juft before bound that way. At the name of a Dutch
or £nglifh fhip, I was (truck with confufion; they
being as great a terror to me in this vr-flel, as an Al-
gerine man of war is to them in the Mediterranean.
The old man finding me troubled, Sir, laid hfe, I
hope the Dutch are not now at war with your nan-
on : No, faid 1, but God knows what liberty they.
may take. when ovit of the reach of the law Why,
fays he, what occafion is there for peaceable mer-
chants to fear '. For, believe QIC, they never meddle
with any but P I R A T Ji S.
At the mentioning of the word piratts, my conn,
lenance turned to that of fcarlet: nor was it poliible
for me to conceal it from the old pilot; who taking

we were faved by the means of two men: that the

running away with the fhip, I believed to be true }
but that we, who bought it, were turntd pirates,
was a mere fi&ion, to cover their cowardice and
foolifh behaviour when they attacked its, and the
blood of thofe men we killed in our own juft de-
fence, lay at their door, who feut to attack us by
furprife.
Sir, faid the old man amazed, you hive tnk:n the
right courfe tojieer to the north ; and, if I might advlfe
you, I would have you fell )our Jbip in China, and buy
tr build another in that country; and f I! procure p.ofle
t6 buy the one and fell the other. Weli, but, Seignior,-
faid I, if I fell the fhip in this manner, 1 may bring
fome innocent perfons into the fame danger as 1 have
gone through, perhaps worfe, even death itfelf, .where-
by I fliould be as guilty of their murder as.villanous
executioners. That feed not trouble you, fays the old,
man \ rilfinda-way to prevent that; far thefe command-
ers you talk of, I know very -well, and I will ir.form them
rightly of the matter, as you hive related, and I am £er.-
Juaded they "will not only believe me, but aSl u.ore cau-
tioitfly for the future. And willyou deliver one meflage
from me to them I Tes, faid he, if you will give it un>-
der lo.ar hand, that I may prove it is not of my o-wn fro.-
dugisn. Hereupon 1 wrote a large account of their
aitacking me in their longboat, the pretended reafon
and unjuft defign of it: that they had done what they
might be afhanicd of, and could not anfwer for at any
tribunal in Englatid. But this letter was writ in v.ain.
Providence prdered things anpther.way. We Ailed
directly for N.anciuin, and, in about thirteen days
'fai), came to an anchor at the fouth vvtfl point ot the
great gulph of that place, where_we learned that two
l)iuch fliips were gone the length before us, and "that
we flipuld ce.itainly fall into thtir.hands. We were
all at a great lofs in this exigency, and would very
£ladjy have been on fltorc almoft any where; but ou,c
our pilot told me, that if I would fail to the fbutS-
ward about two and forty leagues, there was a little
port called Qyinchange, where no European fhipse-
ver came, and where we might confiderwhat was fur-
ther to be done. Accordingly we weighed anchor
the next day, calling only twice on fhore by the way
to get frefh water. The country people very cour-
teoufly fold us roo^s, tea, rfce, fowls, and other pro-
vifions. After five days fail we came to the pirt, and
landed with unfpeiknble joy. We refolved to difpofe
of ourfelves and effc'dt- in any other way poffible, thin
enter on board that ill fated veflcl more; for no ftate
can be more miferable than a continued fear, which
is a life of death, a confounder of our underftand-
ings, that fets the imagination at work to form a
thoufand frightful things that may never happen.
And we fcarce fkpt one night, without dreaming of
halters, yard-arms, or gibbers; of fighting, being
taken, and being killed; nay, .fo violent were our
apprehenfions, that we would bruife our hands and
heads againft the fides of the cabin, as though afta-
•ally engaged. The ftory of the Dutch cruelty at
Amboyna often came into qur thoughts when aw.ikei
and, for my part, I thought my condition very hard,
that, after fo many difficulties'and fuch fignal deli-
verances, 1 fhauld be hanged in my old age, though
innocent of any crime that deferred fuch punilh-
ment; but then religion would feem to represent to
me, as though the voice of it had faid, Confider, <J

But now, thank kind Heaven, being afhore, our
old pilot procured us a lodging and a warehoufe for
our goods ; it was a little hut, with a large warehoufe
joining to it, all built with canes, and pailifadoed
round with large ones, to keep out pilfeiing thieves,
which are very numerous in that country. The ma-
giltrates allowed us a little guard during the night,
and we employed a centinel with a kind of halbert for
three pence a-day. The fair or mart, we found, had
been over for fome time; however, there remained
in the river four junks and two Japan fhips, the mer-
chants of the latter being on fhore. In the firft place
our old pilot brought us acquainted with the miffion-
ary Roman priefts, who were converting the people
to Chriftianity: two of them were referved, rigid,
and auftere, applying themfelves to the work they
came about with great earneftnefs; but the third,
wiio was a Frenchman, called father Simon, was of a
freer converfation, not teemingly foferious and grave
iet no worfe Chriftian than the other two, one of
whom was a Portuguefe, and Jhe other a Genoefe.
Father Simon, it feems, was appointed to go to Pekin,
the royal feat of the emperor of the Chinefe ; and he
only waited for another prieft, who was ordered from
Macao to accompany him. We never met together,
but he was prompting me to keep him company in
that journey: bir, faid he,' I will (hew you the glori-
ous things of this .mighty empire, and a city, the ci-
ty of Pekin, far exceeding London or Paris, put them
both together. One day in particular, being at din-
ner with him, I fhewed Jbme inclination to go; which
made him prefs the more upon me and my partner;
to gain our perfect content. i?«/, father Simon, fiiid
my partner, -what fatisfaFtion can you have in our com-
pany, whom you ejteem as hereties, and conjiquently i.b-
jeEli not worthy your regard? Oh! laid he, you may
be as good Catholies in time as thole I hope to con-
vert to our religion, dnd fo, faid 1, we Jb-dl have
yt.u£rsat.hing to ui ail the -wayt in/lead of flea/ing us
with
with a defcriftion vf the country. Sir, faid he, how-
ever our religion may be vilified by fome people, it
is very certain it neither divelh us of good manners
or Chriftian charity; and as we are gentlemen, as
fuch we may converfe together, without making one
another une.ify.
But we fhall leave him a while, to coniider ouf
fhip and the merchandife which we had todilpofeof.
There was but very little trade in the place where we
were; and I was once refolved to venture to fail to
the riv'er Kilam, and fo to the city of Nanquin: but
Providence ordered it otherwife, by our old pilot's
bringing a Japan merchant to us, to fee what goods
we hnd. He immediately bought our opium, for
which he gave us a very good price in gold by weight,
fome wedges of which were about ten or eleven oun-
ces. It came into my head, that perhaps he might
buy the fhip too; and I ordered his interpreter to
propofe it to him. He faid nothing then ; but fhrunk
up his fhoulders; yet in a few d,iys after he came
accompanied by a miffionary prieft, who was his in-
terpreter, with this propofal. That as be had bought
a. great quantity of sur goods, he had not money enough
to pur chafe oiirfbip; but if I pie a Jed, he -would hire her,
-with all my men, to go to Japan, andfiom thence -with
amther hading to the Philippine iflands, the freight of
both -which he would very -willingly pay U as before; ami
•at their return to Japan, -would buy the Jhif. Upon
this we afked the captain and his men, if they were
willing to go to Japan; to which they unanimoufly
agreed. While this was in agitation, the young
man my nephew Lzft to attend me, told me, That at
1 did not care to accept this profpecl of advantage, he
-would mmage it for me as I pleafed, and render me o
faithful account of Us fuccefs, which Jkould be -wholly
mine. Indeed I was very unwilling to part with him;
but conlidering it might be for the young man's good,
I dilcourfed my partner about it, who of his own ge-
nerolity gave him his (bare of the veflel, fo that^I

*duld do no otherwife than give him mine; but how-
ever we let him have but the property of half of if,
and referred a power, that when we met in England,
if he had obtained fuccefs he fhould account to us
for one half of the profits of the (hip's freight, and
the other fhould be his own. Thus having taken a
writing under his hand, away he failed to Japan,
where the merchant dealt very honeftly by him, got
him a licence to come on fhore, fent him loaded to
the Philippines with a Japanefe fupercargo, from
whence he came back again loaded with European
goods, cloves, and other fpiceries. By this voyage
he cleared a confiderable fum of money, which de-
termined him not to lell his fhip, but to trade on his
own account: fo he returned to the Manillas, where
getting acquaintance, he made his fhip free, was
hired by the governor privately to go to Acapulco
in America, on the Mexican coaft, with a.licence to
travel to the great city of Mexico. This traffic
turned out greatly to account, and nr.y friend find-
ing means to get to Jamaica, returned nine years af-
ter exceeding rich into England.
In parting with the fliip, it comes in courfe to
confider of thofe men who had faved our lives when
in the river of Cambodia: and though, by the way,
they were a couple of rogues, who thought to turn
pirates themfelves, yet we paid ihem what they had
before demanded, and gave each of them a I'm all
fum of money, making the Englilhman a gunner,
and the Dutchman a boatfwam, with which they
were very well contented.
We were now above 1000 leagues farther from
home, than when at Bengal. All the comfort we could
expect, was, that there being another fair to be ktpt
in-a month's time, we might not only purchak Ml
forts of that country's manufactures, bi:t vr-ry pofr Jy
find fotne Chinele junks, or veffcls from Tonqiii^, to
be fold. . which would carry us am1 our goods whore-
foever we pleated. Upon theie hopts, we refoived
to
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
«o continue; and to divert ourfelves, we took feveral
link lourneys in the country. About ten days after
we parted with our /hip, we travelled to lee the city
of N..n<.;:in. This city lies in latitude 30 deg. north
of the line; it is regularly built, and the ftrects are
exactly ftraight, and crofs one another, in direft
lines, which fets it out to the greateft advantage. At
our return, we found the prieft was come from Ma-
cao that was to accompany father Simon to Pekin.
That father earneftly foliated me to accompany him,
and I referred him to my partner. In fhort, we
both agreed, and prepared accordingly ; and we were
fo lucky as to have liberty to travel among the reti-
nue of one of their Mandarines, who is a principal
magiftrate, and much reverenced by the people.
We were five and twenty days travelling through
this miferable country, infinitely populous, but as
indifferently cultivated; and yet their pride is infi-
nitely greater than their poverty, infomuch that the
priefts ihemfelves derided them. As we paffed by the
houfe of one of their country-gentlemen, two leagues
off Nanquin, we had the honour, forfooth, to ride
with the Chinefe fquire about two miles. Never was
Don Quixote fo exactly imitated, never fuch a com-
pound of pomp and poverty feen before!
His habit, made of calico, was dirty, greafy, and
very proper for a Merry Andrew or Scaramouch, with
all its tawdry trappings, as hanging fleeves, taflels,
&c. though torn and rent in almoft every part: his
veil underneath it was Ho lefs dirty, but more greafy,
refembiing the mof t exquifite floven, or greafy but-
cher. His horle (worfe thanRofinante, or the famous
fteed of doughty Hudibra?) was a poor, ftarved, de-
crepit thing, that would not fell for thirty fhillings
in lingland : and yet this piece of worfhipful pomp
v/as attended with ten or twelve flaves, who guarded
the'ir mailer to his country-feat. We flopped at a
Iittle village for iefrefhment; and when we came bf
the country-feat of this great man, we found him fit-
ting

ling under a tree before his door, eating a mefs of
boiled rice, with a great piece of garlic in the mid-
dle, and a bag filled with green pepper by him, and
another plant like ginger, together with a piece of
lean mutton in it; this was his Worfhip's repaft:
but pray oblerve the ftate of the fool! two women
flaves brought him his food ; which being hid be-
fore him, two others appeared to perform their re-
fpe&ive offices; one fed him with a fpoon, while
ihe other fcraped off what fell upon his beard and
taffety veft, and gave it to a particular favourite to
eat. And thus we left the wretch pleafed with the
conceit of our admiring his magnificence, which ra-
ther merited our fcorn and deceftation.
At length we arrived at the great city of Pekin, ac-
companied by two fervants, and the old Portuguefe
pilot, whofe charges we bore, and who ferved us as
an interpreter by the way. We had fcarce been a week
at Pekin, but he comes laughing to us, Ah! Seignior
Inglife, faid he, me fbmething tell you make your heart
glad, but make me Jorry; for you hring me here 25 days
journey, and now you leave me go back a//>ne : and which
way (ball I make my port after, without de /hip, -wita-
tut de horfe, without pecune? fo he called money ifi
his broken Latin. He then informed me, that there
was a great caravan of Mufcovite and Polifh mer-
chants in the city, who were preparing to fet out for
Mufcovy by land within fix weeks; and that he was
certain we would take this opportunity, and confe-
quently that he muft go home by himfelf. Indeed this
news infinitely furprifed and ple-ifed me. Are you cer-
tain .of this? laid j. Yes, Sir, faid he, mefnreit's true*
And fo he told me, that having met <. * old acquaintance
efhis, an Armenian, in the Jlreet, who -was among
them, and who hid come from Aftracan, -with a dejlgn
to go to Tonquin, but for certain reafons having altered
bit refolution, he -was now refolvedtogo with the caravan,
and to return by the river Wolga to Aftracan. Well,
Seignior, faid I, don't be diicontented about your
N returning
returning alone; ami if by this means I can find a
pafiage to England, it will be your own fault if you
4-eturn to Macao at all. And fo confuting with my
partner what was belt to be done, he referred it to
mff as I pleaied, having our aflairs fo well -fettled at
Bengal, that if we coulJ convert the good voyage we
had made in China filks, wrought raw, he would be
iausfied to go to England, and fo return to Bengal in
the company's (hips. Thus refolved, we agreed, that
if our pilot would go with us, we would bear his
charges either to Mofcow or England; and to give
him in a prefent the fum of 170 pounds Sterling.
Hereupon, we called b\m in, and told him the caufe
of his complaint Ihould be removed, if he would ac-
company us with the caravan; and therefore we de-
lired to know his mind. At this he fhook his head,
Great long journey, faid he, me no pecune, carry me to
Mofcow, or keep me there. But we foon put him out
of tint concern, by making him fenfible of what we
woufd give him hers to lay out to the beft advan-
tage l and as for his charges, we would fet him fafe
-pn (liore, God willing, either in Mufcovy or Eng-
land, as he pleafed, at our own charge except the
.carriage of his goods. At this propofal he was like
3 man tranfported, telling us, he would go with us
all the world over; and we made preparations for
our journey ; bat it was near four months before all
lhe merchants were ready.
In the mean time, my pariner and the pilot went
<;xprefs to the port where we firft put in, to difpofe
ni what goods had been left there, while I accompa-
yied a Chinefe merchant, who was going to Nanquin,
iind there bong'- 2ippieces ofdamalk, with about 300
iiiore cf other tine iilks; and by the time my part-
fiec returned to Pekin, I had them all carried thither:
our cargo in filks amouoted to 45Oo/. Sterling, which,
together with tea, fine calicoes, nutmegs, and cloves,

loaden with provifions: the company now was very
great, making about 400 horfe, and above 120 men,
well armed and provided. We were of feveral na-
tions, among whom were five Scots merchants in-
habiting in Mofcow, and well experienced in trade.
We fct out from Fekin the beginning of February
our ftyle-; and in two days more, we pafted through
the gate of the great China wall, which was erected
as a fortification againft the Tartars, being 100 Eng-
lifh miles long. We then entered a country not near
fo populous, chiefly under the power of plundering
Tartars, feveral companies of whom we perceived
riding on poor ftarved horfesi contemptible as them-
felves, without order or difcipline. One time our
leader for the- day gave us leave to go a-hunting.
But what do you think we hunted? only a parcel of
fheep, which indeed exceeded any in the world for
wildnefs and fwiftnefs; but while we were purfuing
this game, it was our chance to meet with about for-
ty Tartars, who no fooner perceived us, but one of
them blew a horn, at the found of which there foon
appeared a troop of forty or fifty more, at about a
mile's diftance. Hereupon one of the Scots mer-
chants (who knew their ways) ordered us to advance
towards them, and attack them immediately. As we
advanced, they let fly a volley of arrows, which hap-
pily fell a little fhort of us: this made us halt a lit-
tle, to return the compliment with bullets ; and then
being led up by the bold Scot, we fired our piftols
in their faces, and drew out our fwords; but there
was no occafion; for they flew like timorous fheep,
and only three of them remained, beckoning to the
reft to come back. But our brave commander gal-
lops up to them by himielf, fhot one dead, knocks
another off his horfe, while the third ran away:
and thus ended our battle with the Tartars.
We travelled a month more through the emperor of
China's dominions; and at length coming to one of
their towns about * day and a half's journey from the
N 2 city
eirjr of N.ium, I wanted to buy a camel. The perfofl
J ipokc to would have brought me one, but, like a
fool, I muft go along with him, about two miles
from the vilUge. My old pilot and I walked on foot,
forfooth, for lome variety, when coming to the place
.where the camels were kept as in a paik guarded by
Chinefe foldiers, we there agreed and bought one,
tvhich the Chinefe man that came with me led along
the road. But we had not gone far, before we were
attacked by five Tartars, mounted on horfeback, two
<if whom leieed the man, took the camel from him,
find rode away, while the other three approached us,
.the firft of whom fuddenly feized me as 1 was drawing
tny fword, the fecond knocked me down; but my
o\6 trufty Portuguefe, taking a piftol out of his pocket,
^vhich i knew nothing of, and coming up to thefel-
iow that ftruck me, he with one hand pulled him off
£iis horfe, and then ihot him dead upon the (pot; then
taking his fcymitar, he ftruck at the man that ftopt
tis, but miffing him, cut off one of his horfe's ears,
the pain of which made him throw his rider to the
ground. The poor Chinefe, who had led the camel,
feeing the Tartar down, runs to him, and feizing up-
£,11 his pole-axe, wrenched it from his hands, and
tnocked his brains out. But there was another Tar-
tar to deal with, who feeming neither inclined to fight
ttor to fly and my old man having begun to charge his
piftol, the very fight of it ftruck fuch a terror into the
Wretch, that away he fcoured, leaving my old pilot,
--3ther my champion and defender an abfoluteviitor.
By this. time being awakened from my trance, I
fcegan to open my eyes, wondering where I was, ha-
ving quite forgot all that paffed; but my fenfes re-
turning, qnd feeling a great pain in my head, and
reeing the blood was running over my cloaths, I in-
^antly jumped upon my feet, and grafped.my fword
la my hand, with a refolution to take revenge; but
po enemies now remained, except the dead Tartar,

me recovered, whom he thought flain, ran towards
me, and embraced me with the greater} tendernefs,
at the fame time examining into my wound, which
was far from being mortal ; when we returned to the-
•village, the man demanded payment for his carnd,
which I refuting, we brought the caufe before a Chi-
nefe judge, who acted with great impartiality: hat-
ing heard both (ides, he aflced the Chinefe man that-
went with me, whofe fervant he was? Sir, laid he,
I am nobody's, but went with the ftranger, at his re-
queft: why then, faid ihe judge, you were the-
granger's fervant for the time, and the camel beimj
delivered to his fervant, it is the fame as though dt-
livened to himfdf, and accordingly he muft p-iy fo-
rt. Indeed the cafe was fo fairly ftated, that i had.
nothing to object to it;. fo having paid for that I
was robbed of, I fent for another, but did not go my-
felf to fetch it, as I had enough of that fport before.
The city of Naum is a frontier of the Chinefe emr
p-ire, fo fortifiedi as fome will tell you, that millions
of Tartars cannot batter down their walls; by which
certainly one might think one of our cannons would.
do more execution tRan all their legions.
When we were within a day's march of that city,
we had information that the. governor had fent mef-
fengers to every part of the road, to inform the tra-
vellers and caravans to halt, till a guard was fent to
protect them from the numerous bodies of Tartars
that lately appeared about the city. This news puts us
into great confirmation; but obeying the orders we.
ftopt, and two days after, there cams two hundred
foldiers from a garrifon of the Chinefe, and three
hundred more from Nnum: thus guarded both in
the front-and rear, with our own men on the flanks,
we boldly- advanced, thinking we were able to combat
with ten thoufand Mogul Tartars, if they appeared.
Early next morning, in our march from a little
well-fituated town called Changu, after having palTed-
a river, and entered upon a ddert of about 15 or 16
N i. miles.
iniles over, we foon beheld, by a cloud of duft that
•was rai/ed, that the enemy was approaching. This
rnuch difpirited the Chinele. My old pilot took no-
tice of it, and called out, Seignior Inglife, thofe fel-
lows muit be encouraged, or they will ruin us all:
and I am-afraid, if the Tartars attack us, they will
all run away. Why,-. Seignior, faid I, what fhall
'be done in this cafe? Done, fays he, why, let fifty
of our men advance, and Hank them on each wing.
I know the fellows will fight well enough in com-
pany. We accordingly took his advice, "and march-
ed rifty to the right wing, and the fame number to
the left, and with the reft made a line of referve,
leaving the la ft two hundred men to guard the ca-
iiiels, or to affift us as occadon required.
Thus prepared a party of the enemy came for-
•vvnrd, viewing our pofture, and traverfing the ground
the front of our. line. Hereupon we ordered the
wings to move on, and gave them a falute with
fliot; which accordingly was done. This put
^ fiop to their proceedings; for immediately wheel-
ing off to their left, they all marched away, and we
f.Avr no more of them. They had undoubtedly gi-
vgn an account to their companions of what recep-
ti0n they might expect, which made them fo eafily
e over their eiuerprife.
"When we came to the city'of Naum, we return-
fj ''ie governor hearty thanks, and difperfed a
l>uiidr.ed crowns among the foldiers that guarded
tis. We relied there one day, and then proceeded
oiu- travels, paffiug leveral great rivers and de-
S; and on the i3th of April, we came to the
tiers of Mulcovy, the firft town of which was
l led Argun.

for above a. thouiaucT miles, is inhabited by the molt
ignorant and barbarous ltag'*ns.
We advanced from the river Arguna by moderate
journeys, and found convenient garrifons on the
road,. filled with Chriftian foldiers, for the fecurity
of commerce, and for the convenient lodging of tra-
vellers; but the inhabitants of the country were mere
Pagans, worfhipping the fun, moon, and ftars. Wo
particularly observed this idolatry near the river Ar-
-guna^.-ata city inhabited by Tartars and Rullians,.
called Nerifmkey. Being curious to fee their way of;
living, while the caravan continued to reft them--
felves in that city, I went to one of their villages,
where there-was to be one of their folemn iacrifices
There 1 beheld, upon the flump of an old tree, art
idol of wood, more ugly than the reprefentation of
the devil himfelf: its head refembled no living crea-
ture; its ears were as big and as high as goat's horns,
a crooked nofe, four-cornered mouth, and horrible
teeth; it was cloathed in fheeps fkins, had a great-
Tartar boonet, with two horns growing through it,
and was ejgtu foot high, without feet, legs, or pro--
portion. Before this idol there lay 16 or 17 peo-
ple, who brought their offerings, and were making-
their prayers, while at a diftance flood three men,.
and one bullock, as victims to this ugly monfter.
Such ftupendous facrilege as this, in robbing the
true God of his honour, filled me with the gretuelt
aftoniihment and reflection; which foon turning to
rage and furyv I rode up to the image, and cut in/
pieces-the bonnet that was upon his head with my
fword, fo that it hung down by one of the horns,
while one of my. men that was with me, pulled at it
by his (heep's ikin garment. Immediately an hide-
ous howling and outcry ran through the village, and-
two or three hundred people coming about our ears^-
we were obliged to fly for.it.
But 1 had not docu with the monfter; for the ca-
i: • N. 4 'ravan.
ravnn being to reft three nights in the town, I toH
the bcots merchant what I had leen, and that I wa«
refolded to take four or five men well armed with
me, in order to deftroy ihe idol, and ihew the peo-
ple how little reafon thtir had to truft in a god. who
could not fave himfelf. At firft he laughed at me,
reprefentmg the danger of it, and when it was de-
firoyed, what time had we to preach to them better
things, whole zeal and ignorance was in the higheft
degree, and both unparallelled? that if I fhould be
taken by them, I fhould be ferved as a poor ruffian,
who contemned their wodhip; that is, to be ftrip-
ped naked, and tied to the top of the idol, there fhot
at with arrows till my body was full of them, and
then burnt as a facri.'ke to the monfter: but, Sir,
/aid he, fince your zeal carries you fo far, rather
than you fhould be alone, I will accompany you, and
bring a ftout fellow equal to yourfelf, if you will, to
affift you in this defign : and accordingly he brought
one Captain Richardibn, who hearing the ftory, rea-
<1ily confented; but my pariner declined it, being
Altogether out of his way: and fo we three, and my
irian-fervant, refolved to execute this exploit about
iuidnight; but upon fecond thoughts we deferred it
fO the next night, by reafon that the caravan being
to go from thence next morning, we fhould be out
of the governor's power, The beiter to effectuate
tpy defign, I procured a Tartar's fheep Ikin robe, a
£yt>nnet, with bo-v and arrowjf, and every one of us
got the like habits. The firft night we fpent in
fixing combuftible matter with aqua-vits, gun-
powder, &c. having ?. good quantity of tar in a liitle
pot : next night we came up to the idol about eleven
o'clock, the moon being up. We found none
tTt1arding it; but we perceived a light in the houfe,
e we had feen'the -prkfts before. One of our
was for firing the hut, another for killing the
. snd a third for making them prifoners, while
was deftroyed. We agreed to the latter;

that we brought them all away prifoners to fhcif-'
•wooden god. There-we 'fell to work-with him,
daubing him all over with tar mixed with tallow and
brimftone, flopping his eyes, ears, and month, full
of gunpowder, with a great piece of wild fire in his
btonnet, and environed it with dry forage. All this
being done, we uuloofed and ungagged the prifoners, -
and fet the idol on' Ere, which the gunposvder blow-
ing up, the lhape of it was deformed, rent, and-
fplit, which the forage utterly confumed; for we"

flame. And thus we came away nndifcovered, m.
the morning appearing as bufy among our fellow-
travellers, as nobody could have fufpected any othsr, •
but that we had been in our beds all night.
Next morning we fet out, and had got but a fmall'
diftance from the city, when there came a multitude
of'the people of the country to the gates of the city, •
demanding fatisfacYion of the Ruffian governor for
inful'ing their priefts, and burning their great Chum
ChiThawgu, who dvtlt in the fun, and that no'
mortal would violate his image, but Come Chriitkm
mifcreams; and being already no lefs than'thirty •
thoufand .ftrong, they denounced war againft hita
and all his Chriflians.
The goTernor aflured them he was ignorant of
the matter, and that none of his garrifon had been
abroad; that-indeed-fheie was a caravan thai went
«way that morning, aftd that he would fend after
them to inquire into it; and whoever were the of-
fenders, fhould be. delivered into their hnnds. This
fatisfkd them for. the prelent, but the governor fent
to inform us, that if ?.ny of us had done it, we fhoivld
N 5 m.ikc-
make all the hafte away poffible, while he kept them
ln play as long as he couJd. Upon this wemarched
tvvo days and two nights, flopping but very little,
till at taft we arrived at a village called Plothus, and
i-iaftened to Jarawena, another of the Czar's colonies.
n 'he third day, having entered the defert, and
the lake called 'Shaks-Ofer, we beheld a nu-
body of horfe on the other fide of it to the
who fuppofed we had pafled on that fide of
lake; but having either found their miftake, or
certainly informed of the way we took, they
came upon us towards the dufk of the evening, juft
ns we had pitched our camp between two little but
very thick woods, with a little river running before
our front, and fome felled trees with which we had
Covered our rear; a- precaution we always took, and
h we had juft finifhed, when the enemy came
They did not fall on us immediately, but fent
meffengers, demanding the men who had in-
/ulted their priefts, and burn their god Cham Chi-
fh.ningn, that they might be burnt with fire - that
lf this was complied with", they would peaceably de-
part; but if not, they would dcftroy one and all of
Ti5. Our men ftared at one another on receipt of
tliis meflage; but Nobody was the word, as indeed
f^o'oodi knew it, but he who did it. Upon which
-the leader of the earavan returned for anfwer, That
ilicy were peaceable merchants, who meddled with
e of their priefts and gods; and therefore defired
m not to difturb us, and put '•'us to the neceffity
defending ourfelves. But fo far was this from fa-
tisfying them, that the next morning, coming to
owr r'Snt. tney Iet ^y a volley of arrows among us,
^Jvich happily did not hurt any, becaufe we fheltered
oiiiTelves behind our baggage. We expected how-
evCT fo come to a clofer engagement; but were hap-
pily Caved by a cunmng fellow, a Coflack, who ob-
iiniHg leave of the leader to go out, mounts bis
et rides dire&ly from our rear, and taking a cir-

fent .exprefs, and tells them a formal ftory, that the
wretches who had burnt the Cham Gbi-Tbaungu,
were gone to Siheilka, with a re(olution to burn the
god Shal-Ifar, belonging to the Tonguefe?. Uporv
which, believing this cunning Tartar, who was fer-
vant to our Mufcovites, away they drove to Siheilka,.
•and in lefs than three minutes were out of our fight,,
nor did we ever hear of them more.
When we came to the city of Jarawena, we reft-
cd five days, and then entered into a frightful deferf,,
which held us twenty three days march, infefted
with feveral ftnall companies of robbers, or Mogul-
Tartars, who never had the courage to attack us.
After we had pafied over this defert, we found fe-
veral garrifons to defend ihe caravans from the vio-
lence of the Tartars. In particular the governor
of Adinfkoy offered us a guard of fifty men to the
next ftation, if we apprehended any danger. The
people here retained the fame paganifm and barba-
rity, only they w-ere not fa dangerous^ being con-
quered by the Mufcovites. The cloathing, both of
men and women, is of the (kins of beafts( living. un-
der the ground in vaults and caves, which have a.
communication with one another. They have idols
almoft in every family; beiidesi they adore the fun'
and ftars, w-ater and fnow; and the leaft uncommon
thing that happens in the elements, .alarms tlvem as
much as thunder and lightning does the unbelieving
Jews.
Nothing remarkable occurred in our march through •'
this country. When we had got through the defert
after two days farther travel, we came to Janezoy, a.
Mufcovite city, on the great river fo called, which,
we were told, parted Europe from Afia. The inhabi-
tants here were very little belter, though intermixed^
with the Mufco.vites; but the wonder will ceuie,
when I inform my reader of what was obferved to
me, that. the Czar rather coiwcru .the Tartars with-
v N fa. foldicrs-
foidicrs than clergymen, and is more proud to make
them faithful fubje&s, than good Chriitians.
From this city to the river Oby we travelled over a
plcafant, fruitful, but very uncultivated country, for
want of good management and people, and thofe
few are moftly Pagans. This is the place where the
JVlufcovite criminals are banilhed to, if they are not
put to death. The next city we came to, was the
capital city of Siberia, called Tobollki, when, having
been almoft feven months on our journey, and win-
ter drawing on apace, my partner and I confuhed a-
bout our particular aflairs, in what manner we fiiould
clifpofe of ourfelves. We had been told of fledg«
and rein deer to carry us over the fnow in the winter
feafpn, the fnow being frozen fo hard, that the
fledges can run upon the furface without any danger
of going down. As I was bound to England, I now
behoved either to go with the caravan to Jeroflaw,
from thence weft to Narva, and the gulf of Finland,
and fo by land or fea to Denmark; or elfe I muft
leave the caravan at a little town on the Dwina, and
go to Archangel, where I was certain of (hipping ei-
ther to England, Holland, or Hamburgh. One night
1 happened to get into the company of an illuftrious
but banifhed prince, whofe company and viitues

luxury; if I JJxuld cfcapefrom this place, thofe pemi-
cious feeds may again revive, to my Lifting difquietudi;,
therefore tet me remain in a blejjed confinement, far I am

O be 'not my friend and tempter too! Struck
with furprife, I flood fiknt a while, nor was
in lefs dilorder: by which perceiving he wanted
to give vent to his mind, I defired him to conildcr
of it, and fo withdrew. But about two hours after,
b« came to my apartment: Dtar fritnd, faid he,

this jntisfaclion in parting, that you leave me An honefl

pleafed to accept this prejent offMes.
In return for his compliment, I fent my (ervant
next morning to hls Lordfhip, with a fmall prefenr
of tea, two pieces of China damafk, and four little
wedges of gold : but he only accepted the tea, one
piece ef damaik, and a piece of gold, for the curiofity
of the Japan (Vamp that was upon it. Not long
after, he fent for me, and told me, That what he
had refufed himfelf, he hoped upon his account I
would grant to another, whom he fhould name t Irr
fhort, it was his only fon, who was about 200 miles
diftance from him, on the other fide of the Oby,
whom he faid he would fend for, if I gave my con-
fent. This I foon complied with: upon which he
fent his fcrvadts next day for his fon, who rerurned
in twenty days time, bring1.ig feven horfes loaded
with valuable furs. At night the young lord was
conducted incognito into our apartment where his-
father prefented him to me. We then concerted the
beft ways for travelling, and after having bought a'
confiderable quantity of fables, black fox-fkins fine
ermines, &f. (which I fold at Archangel at a good
price), we fet out from this city the beginning of
June, making a fmall caravan, being about thirty-
two horfes and camels, of which I reprefemed the
head. My young lord had with him a very faithful
Siberian fervant, well acquainted with the roads: we
fhunned the principal towns and cities, as Tumen,
Soli-Kamofkoi, and feveral Others, by reafon of their
ftri£lnefs in examining travellers, left any of the ba-
nifhed perfons of diftinclion fhould efcape. Having
pafl"ed the river Kama, we came to a city on the Eu-
ropean fide, called Soloy Kamofkoi, where we found
the people moftly Pagans as before. We then pafled
a defert of about two hundred miles over; but in
other places/ it is near feven hundred, In paffing

LIFE AND ADVENTURES
this wild place, we were befet by a troop of men on-
horfeback, and about five and forty men armed wiih.
bows and arrows. At firft they looked earneftly on
us, and then placed themfelves in our way. We
were above fixteen men, and drew up a little line
before our camels. My young lord fent out his Si-
berian fervant to know who they were; but when
lie approached them, he neither knew a word they
'faid, nor would they admit him to come near them
at his peril, but prepared to fkoot him.. At his re-
turn he told us, he believed them to be Calmuck Tar-
tars, and that he thought there were more of them
upon the defert. This was but a fmall comfort te-
ns; yet feeing a little grove about a quarter pf a
rnile's diftance, we moved to it, by the old Portu.-
guefe pilot's advice, without meeting with any oppo-
£tion. Here we found a marfhy piece of ground,
and a fpring of wafer running into a little brook OR
one fide, which joined ••ino'.her like it a little farther
off, and thefe two formed the head of the river called
"VVritfka. As foon as we arrived, we went to work,
cutting down great arms off the trees, and laying
them hanging (not quite off) from one tree to an-
other. In this fituation we waited the motions of
the enemy, without perceiving any advancement they
piade towards us. About two hours before night,
V>eing joined by fome others, in all about fourkore
Jiorle, among whom we fancied were fome women,
they came upon us with great fury. We fired with-
0ut ball, calling to them in the Ruffian tongue to
their bufinefs; but they, either not know-
r feeming not to underftand us, came di-
y to the wood -fide, not confidering that we
fo fortified, as that they could not break in.
old pilot the Portuguefe proved both our captain
engineer, and defired us not to fire, till they
within piftol fhot; and when he gave the
of command, then to take the fureft.aim: but

them, wounded feveral, as alfo th^ir horfes, having
every one of us loaded our pieces with two or three
bullets at leaft. So much were they furprifed at our
undauntednefs, that they retired about a hundred
roods from us. In the mean while, we loaded our
pieces again, and fallying out, fecured four or five
of their horfes, whole riders we found were killed,
and perceived them to be tartars. About an hour
after, they made another attempt, to fee where they
might break in; but rinding us ready to receive
them, they retired.
All that night we wrought hard, in ftrengthening
our fituation, and barricading the entrances into the
woods; but when day-light came.. we had a very un-
welcome difcovery; for the enemy being encouraged
by their affiftance, had fet up eleven or twelve tents
in form of a camp, about three quarters of a mile
from us. I muft confefs, I was never more con-
cerned in my life, giving myfelf and all that I had
over for loft, And my partner declared, that as the
lofs of his goods would be his ruin, before they
fhould be taken from him, he would fight to the
laft drop of his blood. As we could not pretend to
force our way, we had recourfe to a ftratagem; we
kindled a large fire, which burnt all night; and no
fooner was it dark, but we purfued our journey to-
wards the pole, or north ftar, and travelling all night,
by fix o'clock in the morning we came to a Kufiian
village, called Kertza, and from thence came to a
large town named Ozonoys, where we heard that fe-
veral troops of Calmuck Tartars had been abroad
upon the defert, but that we were paft all danger.
In five days after we came to Veufliina, upon the river
"Witzedga; from thence we came to Lawrenikoy, on
the third of July, where providing ourfelves with
two luggage boats, and a convenient bark, we em-
barked the feventh, and arrived at Archangel the
eighteenth, after a year, five months, and three days
x journey
iourney, including the eight months and odd days at
iobolfki. We came from Archangel the twentieth
or Auguft in the fame year, and arrived at Ham-
burgh the thirtieth of September. Here my pariner

Ot China and Siberia; when dividing our effefls,

we had fuftaincd, and charges we had been at.
Here the young Lord took his leave of me, in order
to go to the court.of Vienna, not only to leek pro-
tection but to correfpond with his father's friends.
After we had ftaid four months in Hamburgh, I
went from thence over land to the Hague, where
embarking in the packet, 1 arrived .in London the
tenth of January 1705, after ten years-and nine-
mouths abfence from England.

more modtil opinion of ourielves: it tells us, how
neceflary the affiftance of divine grace is unto us,
when lite itfelf becomes a burden, and death even
defirable: but when the greateft opprcffion comes
upon us, we muft have recourfe to patience, begging
of God to give us that virtue; and the more com-
peted we are under any trouble, the more commen-
dable is our wifdom, and the larger will be our re-
compenfe. Let the provocation be what it will,
whether from a good-natured and confcientious, or
a wicked, perverle, and vexatious man; all this we
fhould take as from the over-ruling hand of God,
as a punifliment for our fins. Many times injured
innocence may be abufed by falfe oaths, or the
power of wicked, jealous, or malicious men; but
we often find it, like the palm, rife the higher, the'
more it is depreffed; while the juftice of God is e-
minemly remarkable in punifhing thofe one way or
other, who dcfire to endeavour to procure the down-
fal of an innocent man: nor does God fail com-
forting an afflicted perfon, who with tears and
prayers folicits the throne of Heaven for deliverance
and protection. David fays, That his feul -was fuft
6f trouble, and his life drc-ui near unto the grave. But
certainly David's afflictions made him eminently re-
markable, as particularly when purfued by King
Saul, and hunted as a partridge over the mountains.
But one thing which fUnds by innocence, is the
Ic-.e of God; for were we to iuffer difgrace, nay,
an ignominious death itfelf, what comblation does
our innocence procure at our latelt conflict, our laft
moments I- .

diftinguifhing character. Some add lies to lies, till
it not only comes to be improbable, but even im-
poffible too: others lie for gain, to deceive, delude,
and betray: and a third lie for fport, or for fun.
T'hf re are other liars, who are perfonal and mali-
cious; who foment differences, and carry tales from
one houle to another, in order to gratify their own
envious tempers, without any regard or revence to

Chap. V. Cfthfprtfentilate of religion in tire
I doubt, indeed, there is much more devotion than
religion in the world, more adoration than fupplica-
tion, and more hypocrify than fincerity : and it is ve-
ry melancholy to conlider, what numbers of people
there are furnifhed with the powers of reafbn and
gifts of nature, and yet abandoned to the groflell ig-
norance and depravity. But it would be uncharita-
ble for us to imagine (as fome Papifts abounding wiih
too much ill nature, the only fcandal to religion, do)
that they will certainly be in the ftate of damnation
after this life; for how can we think it confiftent
with the mercy and goodnefs of an infinite Being, to
damn thofe creatures, when he hat not furnifhed
them with the light of his gofpel? or how can fuch
proud,
proud, conceited, and cruel bigots prefcribe rules to
the jufticc and mercy of God?
We are told by forne people, that the great image
which King Nebuchadnezzar fet up to be adored by
his people, held the reprefentation of the fun in its

But to wave ihis difcourfe of Heathens, how many

I am forry to make any reflection upon Chriftians:
but indeed in Italy the Roman Religion feems the
moft cruel and mercenary upon earth: and a very
judicious perfon, who travelled through Italy from
Turkey, tells us, "That there is only the face and
"outward pomp. of religion there; that the church
"protects murderers and aflaffins, and then delivers
"the civil ma'g'iftrates oveFtcTSatan for doing juf-
"tice; interdicts whole kingdoms, and fhuts up the

In Mufcovy their churches are built of wood, and
indeed they have but wooden priefts, though of the
Greek church: they pray as much to St Nicholas,
as papifts do to the virgin Mary, for protection in
all their difficulties or afflictions. 2 . •
- As to Lutherans, they only differ from the Ro-
mans in .believing confubftantiation, inilead of tran-
fubftantiation ; but, like them, they are much pleaf-'
ed with the external gallantry and pomp, more than
.the true and real practice of it. ...i / t
In.France I found a world of priefts, the ftreets
every where crouded with them, and the churches
full of women ; but furely never was a nation fo full
of blind guides, fo ignorant of religion, and even as
void of morals, as thofe people who confefs their
fins to them. .... . •
Does it not feem ftrange, that while all men own
the Divine Being, there fhould be fo many different
opinions as to the manner of paying him obedience
in the Chriftian church ? I know not what reafon
to affign for this, except it be their different capaci-
ties and faculties.
And indeed, upon this account, we have perceived
in all Chriftian countries what mortal feuds have
been about religion; what wars and bloodfhed have
inolefted Europe, till the general pacification of the
German troubles at the treaty of Weftphalia ;.and'
fince thofe iimes, what perfecution in the fame coun-
try among the churches of the Lutherans: and
fliould 1 take a profpect at home, what unhappy di-
vifions are between Chriftians in this kingdom, a-
bout Epifcopacy and Prcfbytery, the church of Eng-
land men and the diiVentcrs; oppofing one another
like St. Paul and St. Peter, even to the face; that is,
they carry on the difpute to the utmoft extremity.
It might be a queftion, why there are fuch differen-
-.•; - ces
en In religious points, and why thefe breaches fhould
be more hot and irreconcileable? All the anfwer I
can give to this, is, that we inquire more concerning
the truth of religion, than any ether nation in the
vrarld; and the anxious concern we have about it,
makes us jealous of every opinion, and tenacious of
our own: and this ii not becaufe we are more fu-
rious and rafh than other people; but the truth is,
we arc more concerned about them; and being fen-
fible that the fcripture is the great rule of faith, the
ftandard for life and doctrine, we have recourfe to
it ourfelves, without fnbmiuing to any pretended in-
fallible judge upon earth.
There h another queftion, pertinent to the former,
and that is, What remedy can we apply to this mala-
dy? And to this I muft negatively anfwer, Not to be
Icfs religious, that vve may differ the lefs. This is
ftriking at the very root of all religious differences;
for certainly, were they to be carried on with a peace-
able fpirit, willing to be informed, our variety of o-
pinions would not have the name of differences i
nor fhould we fcparate in communion of cluriiy,
though we did not agree in feveral articles of religion.
Nor is there a lefs ufeful queftion to ftart, namely,
"Where will our unhappy religious differences end .'
To which, 1 hope, J may anfwer, In rL'aven; there
{ill unchriftuin and unhrotherly differences will find a
period; there we fhall embrace maiiy a finncr, that
here we think it a difhonour to converfe with; and

of our fold; that thofewe have excommunicated, have
been taken into that fuperior communion: and in a
word, that thofe contradicting notions .iad principle*,

•as mens certain convictions of truth are not equal to
one another, or to the weight or fignificancy of fuch

be expected on this fide of time, on this fide of the
grave.
Before I conclude this chapter, I fhall beg leave to
difcourfe a little of the wonderful excellency of ne-
gative religion and negative virtue The latter fets
out. like the Pharifee, with, God, I thank thee ; it is
a piece of religious pageantry, the hypocrite's hope;
and, in a word, it is pofitive vice: for it is either a
maik to deceive others, or a mift to deceive ourfelves,
A man that is clothed with negatives, thus argues ; I
am not fuch a drunkard as nay landlord, fuch a thief
as rny tenant, fuch a fwearer as my neighbour : nei-
ther am I a cheat, an athieft, a rakrfh fellow, or a
highwayman: no ! I live a fober, regular, retired
life : I am a good man, I go to church, God I thank
thee. Now, though a man boaiVs of his virtue in
contradiction to the vices mentioned, yet a perfon
had better have them altogether, than the man him-
felf; for he is fo full of himfelf fo perfuaded that he
is good and religious enough already, that he has no
thoughts of any thing, except it be to pull off his hat
to God almighty now and then, and thank him, that
he has no occafion for him; and has the vanity to
think that his neighbours mud imagine well of him
too.
The negative man, though he is no drunkard, is
yet intoxicated with the pride of his oWB worth: a
good neighbour $nd peace-maker in other families,
buta tyrant in his own; appears in church for a fhow,
but never falls upon his knees in his cloiet; does aH
his alms before men to be feen of them; eager in the

Let us fur a while enter into the private and retired of_^
part of his converfation: What notions has he of his
, iiip'.Mt hours, and of the progrefs of time to the great
Centre and gulf of lift-, eternity? does he know howto
p^it a right v-alue on time, or efteem it the life blood
tff his foul, as it really is, and act in all the moments ae meanr, to

Revealed religion gives us a light into the care and
concern of his providence, by the climate's being made
habitable, the creatures fubje&ed and made nouriih-
ing, and all vegetative life made medicinal; and all
this for the fake of man, who is made viceroy to the
King of the earth The (hort deicription I fhall give
of providence is this: That it is that operation of the
power, of the wifdom, juftice, and goodnefs of God,
by which he influences, governs, and diredb, not on-
ly the means,' but the events of all things, which
concerns us in this fublunary world ; the fovereign-
iy of which we ought always to reverence, obey its
motions. obfeive its dictates, and Men to its voice.

the virgin Mary, and to the itpoflles; others have
been warned in a dream, &s King Abimelech, the

fclf was pleafdd to warn, men what fervices- to .per-

God in a dream- to go to Lgypt; and fo were the
wife men warned 'inva dream to -depart into their
own country another way, to avoid the fury of .He-
rod. I am not like thole who think dreams are the
mere dofmgs of a delirious head, or the relies of a
day's perplexities or pleafures ; bye, on the contrary,
.1 inuft,beg }eave to fay, I never met with any capitat
mifchief in my life but I had foine notice of it by cv
dream; and had I not been a' thoughtlefs unbeliev-
ing creature, I might have taktn many a warning,
and avoided many of the evils I afterwards fell into-,
merely by a total neglect of thufe dreams.'
. I was. once prefent at a difpute between a layman
04 . and
nnd a clergyman, upon the fubject of dreams. The neditrpnt «,K
firft thought no regard fhould be given unto them; goodL I, •
i-hat their communication from the invifible to the ° •-' 1S a'
viiiblc world was a mere chimera; without any folid t],it 'WC TV*
foundation. For, i, faid he, if dreams were from bln.'n,r ,
the agency of any prefciem being, the motives wonld '^ - an«
lie more drrfct, and die difcoveries more plain; and fpir;| ?l?0'
not by allegories and emblematic fancies, exprcffing ina'd 'C
things imperfect and obfcure. 2. Since, with the -.—<- ,reain' v
notice of evil, there was not a power given to avoid
it, it is not likely to proceed from a fpirit, but mere-
ly fortuitous. 3. That the inconftancy of fuch no-
tices, in cafes equally important, proves they did not
proceed from any fuch agent. 4. That as our moft
cliftinct dreams had nothing in them of any fignifi- Ofi
c-.iny, it would be irrational and vain to think that a fv
they came from heaven. And, 5. That as men ,its
\v-eve not always thus warned or fupplied with no- I fa\t
tices of good or evil, fo all men are not alike fnp- anc
*}lied with them; and what reafon could we give, fuc
^vhy one man or one woman ihould not have the j }^0
{ame hints as another? tra
To all this the clergyman gave anfwer; I. That the
9s to the fignification of dreams, and the objections Of
.igainft them as being dark and douhtfvil, they are t|,e
^tiprcffed generally by hieroglypbical reprefentations,
.fifiiiles, allulions, and figurative emblematic ways,
l,y which means, for want of interpretation, the
tliing was not underitood, and confequently the evil
t fhunned. 2. That we charge God foolifhly, to
that he has given the notice of evil without the
.„ wer to avoid it; for if any one had not power to
*'void the evil, it was no notice to him; and it was
-gv-anf of giving due heed to that notice, that men
^rft negle£ted themfelves, and then charged the
fudge of all the earth with injuftice. 3. '1 hat we
not to find fault with the inconftancy of thefe
s, but rather with our weak underftandings,
pretending drepms were not to be regarded, and
negligent
negligent when the voice really fpoke to us.for our-
good. It is a miftake to fay, dreams have no import
ar all ; we might with more reafon have faid, none
-that we could perceive the reafon of, owing to our
blin'Inefs .and fupine negligence, too fecure at one
time, and too much alarmed at another; fo that the
fpirit, which we might be faid to be converfing with
in a dream, was conftamly and equally kind and
careful; but our powers are not always in the fame
ftace of action, not equally attentive to, or retentive
of the hims that were given. And, 5, to anfwer
-the laft queftion, why people are not equally fup-
plied? i his Ieemed to be no queftion •, for Provi-
dence itfelf might have fome (hare in the direction
of it, and then that providence might be limited by
a fuperior direction: That as to the converfe of fpi-
rits, he could not call it a ftated converfe; fuch a
thing there was, but why there was fo much of it,
and no more, was none of his bufinefs, and that no
fuch difcovery had ever yet been made to mankind.
Nor were we -to imagine lefs of waking dreams,
trances, vifioris, noifes, hints, impulfes, an'd all
the waking teftimotites of an invifible world, and
of the communication that there is between us and
•them, which commonly entertains us with our eyes
open.
One time my fancy foared on high, to fee what
difcoveriss I could make in thofe clearer regions. I
found that fuch immenfe 'bodies as the fun, ftsrs
planets, and moon in the great circle of the lower
heav.en, are far from being found in the ftudy of nature
on the furface of the earth. Here I faw many things
that we can entertain little or no notion of in a ftate
of common life, and the emptinefs of our notion,
that the planets are habitable worlds, that is, created
like ours for the fubfiftence and exiftence of man and
beaft, and the prefervation of the vegetative and fen-
fitive life: no, no; this is, I aflure you, a world of
fpirits; for here I faw a clear demouftration of Satan .
being the prince of the power of the air, keeping his
court or camp, with. innumerable angels to attend
him; but his power is not fo great as we imagine,
he can tempt us to the crime, but cannot force us to
Co naiif it: Human um eft peccare. Nei.her has the
devil power to force the world into a rebellion a-
giinft heaven, Chough .his-.legions are employod a-

god, who inukc the He.nheP>.either worthip him in

to the limitations of the devil's power, you mull un-
derftand, th^t as there \ are numbers of evil fpirits
employed in mifchief, fo there arc numbers of good
angeis fent from the higher and blefffd abodes to
difconcert and oppofe their meafures; and this every
Chriftian, 1 .hope, believes, when he prays to God,
the Father of fpirits, tagi,ve his angels charge over
him while he, flumberethiind fleepeth. For if by
thefe preventing powers tjie devil was not reftrained,

run in her mind, that the houfe would be burnt, that
fhe could not go to deep; but communicating her
apprchenfions to another in the family, they were
both in iu'ch a fright, that they applied themfelves
to fearch from the top of the houfe to the bottom,
and to fee every fire and candle iafe out, fo that, as
they all laid, it was impoffible any thing could hap-
pen in the houfe, and they lent to the neighbours on

but had fhe obeyed the hint which prefTed upon her
ftnmgcly not to go to bed, fhe had done much
better; for the fire was actually kindled at that very
time, though not broken out. About an hour after
the whole family was in bed, the houle juft over
the way, directly oppofite, was all in flames, and the
wind, which was very high, blowing the flame upon
the houfe this gentlewoman lived in, fo filled it with
fmoke and fire, in a fevv moments, the ftrcet being

maa
in the city of Dublin in Ireland, who dreamed
a. very uncommon dream, That a gentleman had
killed his wife, a relation of his, by ftabbing her in
fevera! places: the fright of this awaked him, but
-Ending it a dream, he compofed ' hnnfelf again to
fleep, when he dreamed a fecond time the fame
dream. This made him a little uneafy; but think-
ing it proceeded from the impreffion made on his
fimd by the former, he went to fleep again, and
dreamed the fame dream a third time alfo. So
troubled was he at this, that he arofe, and knocked
»t his mother's chamber, told his concern, and
}«'« apprehenfions that all were not right at his re-
Jation's houfe. Dear (on, fays the good old gentle-
v'otnan, do not rnind thefe foolifh dreams: and I
•very much wonder, that you, being a | erfon. in holy
iprdeYs, ihould have regard to fuch illufions. Upon
t'i is he went to bed again, fell afleep, and dreamed
& fourth time as before. And then indeed he put
£tn his night-gown, and went to Smithfield, the .place
^nrhere his relation dwelt. Here it was, alas! he
perceived his dream too fadly fulfilled, by feeing his
^-elation, the young lady, big with child, who was

rrirfuers, too good a death for one who deferred the
gibbet; and the lady was univerfally lamented by
all tender and religious people. And this tragical
relation I have mentioned upon the account of that
impulfe or dream that the clergyman had at the fa-
tal time of the bloody action.
It might beexpected I (liould'enter upon the fub-
ject of apparitions, find difcourfe concerting the rea-
lity of them i and whether they can revifit the place
of their former exigence, and refume'thofe faculties
of fpeech and fliape PS they had when living; but,
as thele are very doubtful matters, 1 lhall only make
a few obfervatkms upon them.
I once heard of a man that would allow the rea-
lity of apparitions, but laid it all upon the devil,
thinking that the fouls of men departed, or good
men, did never appear. To this very man fome-
thing did appear; he faid, he faw the fhape of an
ancient man pafs by him in the dulk, who, holding
up his hand in a threatening pofture, cried out, O .
wicked man. repent^ repeat. Terrified with this ap-
parition, he confulted fcveral friends, who advifed
him to take the advice. But, after all, it was not
an apparition, but a grave and-pious gentleman, who
rnet him by mere accident, and had been fenfible of
his v\-ickcdnefs; and who never undeceived him, left
it fhould hinder his reformation. Were we always
willing to make good ufe of Satan's real appearances,
J know not but it would go a great way to b'mifh
him from the vifible world; for I am very pofitive,
he would feldom vilit us, if he thought his coming
ivould do us any good: but fo abfolutely is he at the
command of heaven, that he mult go, even to do
the work he abhors.
Some people make a very ill ufe of the general
notion, ihat there are no apparitions nor fpiriis at
nil: which is worfe than thufe wh» f.mcy they fee
-them upon every occafion: for thofe c.irry their
notions farther, even to annihilate the devil, and be-
lieve
 
-
lieve nothing about him, neither of one kind or ci-
ther: 'the next ftep they come to, is to conclude,
There is no God and fo atheiftn iakes its rife in the
fame (ink, with a careleilhefs about futurity. But
there is no occafion to enter upon an argument to
prove the being of the Almighty, or to illuftrate
his power by words, who has fo many undeniable
teftimonies in the breafts of every rational being, to
prove his exiftence: and we have lufficient proofs,
enough to convince us of the great fuperintendency
of divine providence in the aiinuteft affairs of this
world; the manifeft exiftence of the invilible world;
the reality of fpirits, and intelligence between us and
them. What I have iaid, J hope will not miflead
any perfon, or be a means whereby they may delude
themfelves; for 1 have fpoken of thefe things wiih
the utmoft ferioulntls of mind, and with a fincere

of the world.
