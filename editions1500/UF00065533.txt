Cons, gather round me, little ones,
And hearken unto me,

And you shall hear a tale about
A lad that went to sea--

About a. lad that ran away,
Oh, many years ago,

And left his home and parents dear----
Young Robinson Crusoe!

Now when this lad grew up a man,

. It (tame about one day,

That he was cast upon a. rock--
An island far away.

And there to shield him from the storm,
And keep him safe and sound,

He built a. house, and thatch'd it o'er,
And fenced it round and round.

Far off upon a sandy bank
His ship lay all a. wreck;

And oft-times when the sea. was low
He got upon the deck.

For many things he there had found
That he could bring ashore,

Upon the raft that he had made,
And carry to his store.

Two kittens and a faithful dog,
With powder, guns, and shot,
Three cheeses and a chest of tools,

'Moug other things he got

And now he bravely went to work, I
Made tables, chairs, and stools,
And shelves around his little home,

On which to lay his tools.

 

He set a cross up on the beach,
Lest time should go astray,

And with his knife he cut a notch,
To mark each passing day.

He caught and tamed a. little kid,
That trotted at his heels;

And with his dog and cats at home,
it shared his daily meals.
Yet sometimes he grew very sad, A parrot, that some years before
And then he sat him down He artfully had caught,

Upon the shore, and thought his God Would hop upon his thumb, and shriek
Looked on him with a frown. The lessons it was taught.

And he would gaze upon the sea, lAnd so, to keep it snug, he made
Across the billows wild; A cage to put it in:

And wring his hands and cry aloud, And he made a big umbrella, too,
And weep like any child. And all his clothes of skin.

He thought upon his father's words--:1 wot he was the strangest sight
His mother's prayers: and tears; That ever you might see; -

Howtheywouldgrieveforhim,theirson, In jacket, breeches, cap, and shoes,
Away so many years! A hairy man looked he.

Then he would fall upon his knees, 'With big umbrella o'er his head,

And clasp his hands in prayer, I

His sword hung at his side,
And ask his God, with many tears, 'His gun and axe upon his back,

His wicked life to spare. : Ho rambled far and wide.

At times, with gun upon his back, New on the island herds of goals
He roamed the island round, Were running Wild and free;
Where melons, grapes,and sugar-canes, But when he tried to catch the things,

Away they all would flee.

 

All growing wild he found.
And, so to get them in his power,

He dug pits in the ground;

At length he longed when days were fine,
Upon the waves to float;

And there one morn at break of day, So with his tools he went to work,

A goat and kids he found.

The goat he let away again,
For it was fierce and strong;
The little kids he tied with strings,
And took with him along.

And then from running wild again,
His little [lock to keep,

A piece of ground he fenced around,
Where they might feed and sleep.

His crops of barley and of rice,
Now rich and ripe had grown;
For seeds he found upon the wreck,

He long ago had sown.

The corn he pounded into meal,
And made it into bread;

The rice he baked in little cakes,
At times to eat instead.

 

And made a little boat.

He set a mast and sail before,
A rudder, too, behind;

And with his dog and gun on board,
He sped before the wind.

One summer morning as he walked
Abroad, with gun in hand,

He stood aghast as he beheld
A footprint in the sandl

Though many years had passed away,
Since to that loner place

He came, yet he had never caught
A sight of human face.

He tliought'of dreadful savages,
All naked, wild, and black;

And paused at every step he took,
To look in terror back.
He dreamt about them in the night,

And thought of them by day,

But ere his enemies had time
A hand on him to lay,

He scarce would stir, lest they by chance He turned and bounded like a. roe,

Should come across his way.

At last one day he climbed a hill,
Where 0ft he used to lie,

And took with him his telescope,
To see what he could spy.

And looking off towards the shore,
A sight he did behold,

That set his very hair on end,
And made his blood run cold.

A band of painted savages,
He saw to his dismay,

All dancing round a fire, on which
A human body lay.

He saw them kill a helpless man, ~
And one was standing by,

All in an agony of fear,
For he, too, was to die.

Away--away--away.

Across a, stream he swam with speed,
Close followed by his foes;

But he i'vas saved by our good friend
The man in hairy clothes!

A young and comely man he was,
So timid and so shy,

With tawny skin and hair of jet,
And mild and beaming eye.

And oft he paused and looked around,
And knelt as if in fear;

But Crusoe made him signs to come,
And sofily he drew near.

Then Crusoe named him Friday there,
And ever called him so,

Because upon that very day
He saved him from the foe.
And Friday quickly learned to work,
For ready hand had he;

And helped, in time, to build a boat
And launch it in the sea.

His master taught him many things, -
Of God he told him, too,

Who made the sun and moon and stars,

And watches all we do.

A touching sight it was to see,
Poor Friday kneel to pray--
To hear him cry to God for help,

In his poor broken way.

Where'er he was, in house or field,
He ever was the same ;'

Obeyed his master with a smile,
And feared his Maker's name.

One morning Friday came in haste,
In' trembling and in awe,
And told his master three canoes

Upon the beach he saw.

Then Crusoe bade him bring the guns,
And prime without delay;
And soon they beat the savages,

And drove them all away.

gIn one canoe upon the sands,
Half (lead and strongly bound,
All ready for to kill and eat,

3 A poor old man they found.

iWhen Friday saw his face, he paused,

i Another look to take, ' [wepL
Then laughed and cried,and sobbed and

As if his heart would break.

l
fiHe clasped the old man round the neck,

' And kissed him o'er and o'er;
And leapt and danced with very joy,

To see that face once more.

He gave him food, he brought him drink,
He cut his bonds in twain;

 

, The dear old father that he loved,

i Nor thought to see again.
Poor Friday, though his skin was black, Once more on board an English ship,

His heart was warm and kind----
My little ones, a lesson this,
For all to bear in mind.

Now eight and twenty weary years,
Had Crusoe been ashore,

Upon his island, night and day,
Nor thought to leave it more.

Then oh, what joy was his to see
.One mom a spreading sail

Come dancing o'er the waters blue,
Before the swelling gale.

He watched with Friday from a hill,
Though distant many a mile,
Until he saw a boat put off
And row towards the isle. '

And now at last, histrials o'er,
With grateful heart he trod .

And bowed in thanks to God.

His faithful Friday went with him;
His Friday, true and kind,

Who loved him more than all on earth,
He could not leave behind.

His big umbrella, too, he took,
His hairy cap as well;

And parrot with its noisy tongue,
Of other days to tell.

And then with heavy heart he turned,
To bid his home adieu;

And soon, as onward sped the ship,
It faded from his view. . '

' And when old England's shore he saw,

Oh, he shed many tears;
For he had been away in all
Full five and thirty years.

THE END.CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.BABES IN THE WOOD.

Now ponder well, you parents dear, '
These words which I now write;
A doleful story you shall hear,
In time brought forth to light.

A gentleman of good account
In Norfolk dwelt of late,

Whose wealth and riches did surmount
Most men of his estate.

 

Sore sick he was, and like to die,
No help his life could save;

His wife by him as sick did lie,
And both were near the grave.

No love between these two was lost:
Each to the Other kind,

In love they lived, in love they died, '
And left two babes behind.

The one a fine and pretty boy,
Not passing three years old;

The other a girl, more young than he,
And made in Beauty's mould.
The father left his little son,
As plainly doth appear,

When he to perfect age should come,
Three hundred pounds a-year

And to his little daughter Jane,
Two hundred pounds in gold,
To be paid down on marriage-day,
Which could not be controlled:

But if the children chanced to die,
Ere they to age should come,

Their uncle should possess their wealth:
For so the will did run. '

"Now, brother," said the dying man,
"Look to my children dear;

,Be good unto my boy and girl,
No friends else have they here:

"To God and you I do commend
My children night and day;

But little time we yet shall have
Within this world to stay.

"You must be father and mother both.
And uncle all in one;

God knows what will become of them,
,When we are dead and gone."

Then next did speak their mother dear--
"O brother kind," quoth she,

"You are the'man must bring my babes
To joy or misery:
"If you do keep them carefully,
Then God will you reward;

But if you otherwise should deal,
God will your deeds regard."

With lips as cold as any stone,
They kiss'd the children small:

"God bless you both, you pretty lambs!"
With that their tears did fall.

These words then their brother spoke,
The parents sad to cheer:

"The keeping of your little babes,
Sweet sister, do not fear:

"God never prosper me nor mine,
Nor aught else that I have,

If I do wrong your children dear,
When you are in the grave."

The parents being dead and gone,
The children home he takes, -
And brings them both unto his house
Where much of them he makes.

He had not kept these pretty babes
A twelvemonth and a day,

When, for their wealth, he did devise
To make them both away.

He bargained with two ruffians bold,
Who were of savage mood,

That they should take the children twain,
And slay them in a wood.
He told his wife an artful tale;
He would the children send,

To be brought up in fair London,
With one that was his friend.

Away then went the pretty babes,
Rejoicing at that tide,

For gaily both of them did feel,
They should on cock--horsevride.

They prate and prattle pleasantly,
'While riding on the way,

To those their wicked uncle hired,
These lovely babes to slay:

So that the pretty speech they had,
Made the ruffians' hearts relent;
And they that took the deed to do,

Full sorely did repent.

Yet one of them, more hard of heart
Did vow to do his charge, ..

Because the wretch that hired him
had paid him very large.

The other would not agree thereto,
So here they fell at strife;

With one another they did fight,
About the children's life:

And he that was of milder mood
Did slay the other there,

Within an unfrequentecl wood;
The babes did quake for fearl
He took the children by the hand,
When tears stood'in their eye,

And bade them straightway follow him,
And look they did not cry:

And two long miles he led them thus,
While they for bread complain:

"Stay here," quoth he, "I'll bring ye bread,
When I do come again."

These pretty babes, with hand in hand,
Went wandering up and down;

But never more they saw the man
Approaching from the town:

Their pretty lips with'black-berries
Were all besmear'd and dyed,

And when they saw the darksome night,
They sat them down and cried.

Thus wander'd these two pretty Clears,
Till death did end their grief;

In one another's arms they died,
Poor babes, past all relief :

No burial these innocents
Of any man receives,

But robin red--breast lovingly
Did cover them with leaves.

And now the heavy wrath of God
Upon their uncle fell;

. For fearful fiends did haunt his house,

His conscience felt a hell:Ex:
His barns were fired, his goods consumed,
His lands were barren made,

His cattle died within the field,
And nothing with him stayed.

And in a voyage to Portugal
Two of his sons did die;

And, to conclude, himself was brought
Unto much misery:

He pawn'd and mortgaged all his land,
Ere seven years came about;

And then at length this wicked act
Did by this means come out:

The fellow that did take in hand
These children for to kill,

Was for a robbery judged to die,
As was God's blessed will:

And did confess the very truth,
The which is here express'd;

Their uncle died While he for debt
Did long in prison rest.

All you that be executors,
And overseers eke,

Of children that be fatherless,
And infants mild and meek,

Take you example by this tale,
And yield to each his right,
Lest God with such like misery

Your wicked deeds requite.HARE AND TORTOISE'.THE

HARE AND THE TORTOIbEi _

(NE W VERSION.)

._ 7..--

 

N a fine summer afternoon the animals on
Farmer Jesper's farm met in a shady lane

for a friendly gossip. There were Captain the
cart-horse, and Crummy the cow; a motherly-
sow who had left her litter fast asleep, and who
was familiarly addressed as Tiggy; Cockalorum
Wakemup, who dated his letters from " The Barn
Door;" Pintoe, a gander; Bubbleyjock, the tur-
key, and a dozen or more of the female relatives
of the three gallants last named. Opinions on
farm matters were freely exchanged. Captain
and Crummy signified that so far as they were
concerned things went on pleasantly enough;
but Tiggy declared that the stuff put into her
trough was shamefully thin, considering the size
of her family; and the poultry complained that
the new maid was stingy with the barley Bub-2 7718 flare and the 7brloz'se.

_ bleyjock vowed that if Bob Jcspcr did not leave
off pelting him when he came from school he
would make his ugly red calves smart (Bubbley-
jock said "ugly" because his own calves were
mere drumsticks); and Cockalorum Wakemup,
perched on the top rail of a five-barred gate,
was just thrilling his friends with a "creepy" story
of how a fox prowlcd about the fowl-house for
several hours on the previous night, when who
should come up but Tibby, a,pert young cox-
comb of a hare, well known in those parts.

"Hullol you fellows, what's your diminutive
diversion ?" said Tibby, as he bounded into the
middle of the group. (Tibby, like other conceit-
ed people, was noted for using fine words.)

"Oh," replied Captain, "we're just having a
quiet chat after dinner, Tib. What's your little
game?"

" Well, look' here; I'm ready to run any of
you for anything you like to namefi'

"There he is again," cried several, impati-
ently. "Run, run, run; nothing but 'run' when-
ever you see him." "As though," added Crummy,3 The Hare and the Tortoise.

"1t was something veryg rand to spend ones life
in eating, sleeping, and running.

"What do you know about it, you 'cross old
thing? (This to Crummy, who was old enough
to be his grandmother.) Well, if you are not
game, I am;" and laughing heartily at his own
little joke, he was turning away, when a sleepy
voice was heard from out the grass:

"Stop a bit, Tib; if nobody else will race
you, I will, for two miles."

" Who's that?" the company cried in a breath;
and they answered themselves as they exclaimed
in great amazement, "Why, it's little Tortums!"
And sure enough it was Tortums. Now Tor-
tums, I must tell you, was a tortoise, whose quiet,
modest behavior had made him a general favor-
ite, and who, hearing the clatter of voices, had
crawled down from the farm- house unperceived,
to learn what was going on

Need I say that his friends, who were quite
taken aback by this extraordinary piece of self
assertion on the part of Tortums, entreated him
not to expose himself to certain defeat? Tibby
laughed until his sides ached; and so, for the
matter of that, did Cockalorum Wakemup, who
was a bit of a friend of his: but Tortums was
not to be put off.

"If nobody else will race him, I will, that's
all;" and he winked at Tiggy, as much as to say,
"I know my man."

So they agreed that, just for the fun of the
thing, Tortums should race Tibby. 'I'he challen-
ger at first stood upon his dignity, and declared
the whole thing to be too absurd to be thought
of for a moment, but the company threatened to
cut him if he backed out; So off they ran to the
. turnpike road, in high glee at the prospect of
sport. I '

When Tortums had come up, Captain drew a
line across the road with his hoof, and required
Tibby and Tortums to too it.

" Are you ready P" cried Captain.

" All right," replied the competitors.

" Very well, then:

'Bell, horses; bell, heises; what time of day?
One o'clock, two o'clock, three and away!"
Off galloped Tibby, and was instantly lost to
sight round a bend in the road, whilst little Tor-
tums started at a brisk crawl under a volley of
good-natured banter from his friends, who re-
garded the race as the best joke of the season.

When Tibby had reached the first milestone
he slackened his pace, and said to himself,
"Pheugh! it's melting hot this afternoon. It will
be an hoor' at least before that little idiot reaches
here, so I'll lie down in the grass and have a rest."
He lay down---he dozed---he fell fast asleep!

Meanwhile, Tortums stuck to his work brave-
ly, accompanied by his friends, and within an hour
had nearly reached the first milestone, when Cap-
tain, who, being fatigued with walking so slowly,
had stepped out to the front to stretch his legs,
came running back with the momentous news
that he had spied Tib fast asleep at the side of
the road. The truth flashed across the minds of
those present that after all little Tortums might
.win, and they agreed to pass the unconscious
,r'bragg cart on tiptoe and in perfect silence. The
_ plan answered admirably, though Tiggys awk--T I16 flare and flu; Ybrz'oz'se. 6

wardness in doing her best to carry out the tip-
toe plan nearly led to a burst of laughter.

On, and on, and on plodded little Sobersides,
His friends were in momentary expectation of
seeing Tibby flash past them; but he came not,
and just as twilight was setting in, Tortums
reached the goal.

" Three cheers for Tortums," cried the excite-
able Cockalorum, "and take the time from me."

"Hip, hip, hurrah!" shouted the company.
and at that moment Tibby was seen coming up
the road at a mad gallop. But it was too late.
, He had lost the race!

" And now, clears, for the moral," I said, as I
first told the story at my own fireside.

"Oh, never mind the moral. papa; we know
all about that," interjected Frank, my eldest; and
it being the first duty of papas in this enlight-
ened age to do as they are bid, 1 left the story
to point its own moral. Fortunately it lies upon
the surface.WORLD-WIDE FABLES.

THE LION AND THE MOUSE.

 

A SLEEPING Lion lay beneath an
oak; '
Over his buck and head some small
Mice played,
Tickled by them, at last the monarch
'woke,--
The Mice ran on, at his fierce roar
afraid.
But one poor little Mousey, as she ran,
He caught in his great paw: half dead
she lay;
Then, as he (lid not kill her, she began
For her poor life the mighty boost to
pray.
"Spare me, King Lion! I am weak and
small;
But if you kindly let me run away,
I may be able, should a chance befall,
To serve you also on some future day."
The Lion grimly smiled. " You helpl"
said he,
"0 foolish Mouse! But [ will set you
free."

The months rolled on; the llunters' toils
were set;
In the wild finest, 'neath the greenwood
tree,

 

The mighty Lion struggles in their net;
All! who will now the sylvan monarch
flee ?
He hears aMouse's voice: "0 noble friend,
, I come to do my little best for thee.
I fain my tiny help to you would lend,
And pay you for my life with--liberty."
She gnawed the thick ropes with her
small sharp teeth
For hours and hours--thmnghout the
livelong day;
While, smiling half disdainfully, beneath
The hateful toils the captive Lion lay.
And thread by thread the rope is severed
quite,
The net is loose, the pris'ner out again !
And Mousey's little heart beat with de-
light
As all they bounded o'er the grassy
plain.

" Ah!" said the Lion (by experience taught)
When, safe, they paused beneath a tree
to rest, '
"The least can help the greatest. Much
is wrought
By humble friends, who ofttimes prove
the best."
 

NOE on a time (so rims the fable)
A Country Mouse right hospitable

Received a Town Mouse at his board,
Just as a farmer might :1 lord.

A frugal Mouse upon the whole,

Yet loved his friend and had a soul.

He brought him bacon (nothing lean),
Pudding that might have pleased-a. dean,
Cheese such as men in Sufl'olk make,
But wished it Stilton for his sake;

Yet, to his guest though no way sparing,
He ate himself the rind and poring.
Our courtier source could touch a hit,
But showed his breeding and his wit:
He did his best to seem to out,

And cried, "1 row, you're mighty neat:
But, In! my friend, this savage scene!

I pray you come and live with men.
Consider, mice, like men, must die,
Both small and great--brim you and I
Then spend your life in joy and sport.
This doctrine, friend, I learned at Court."

The veriest hermit in the nation

Mav yield, Heaven knows! to strong
temptation.

Away they went through thick and thin,

To a. tall house in Lincoln's Inn.

Now, let it in a word be said,
The moon was up. the men ubed,
The napkins white, the carpet red;
The guests withdmwn, hull left. the treat,
And down the Mice sat lete-d--(ee.
Our com-tier walks from dish to dish,
Tastes for his friend of fowl and fish.
"That jelly's rich, this Malmsey's heal-
ine.
Pray dip your whiskers and your tail in."
Was over such a happy swnin?
lIe studs and swills, and stuffs again.
" I'm quite ashamed! 'tis mighty rude
To eat so much, but ull's so goodl
I have a thousand thanks to give.
My lord alone knows how to live."
No sooner said than from the hall
Rush chaplain, butler, dogs, and all.
"A rat! a rutl clap to the doorl"
The out comes bounding on the floor.
Oh for the hem of Homer's micel

MAN who lived in days of old,
~ And once hull store of lands and
gold,

Found himself poorer day by day,
And saw his riches melt away,
Nor knew the cause. With gloomy {1100,
To a wise man he told his case,
And asked advice. The wise man smiled,
. And answered in an accent mild,

" Take this locked casket, worthy friend;

Obey me, and your griefs will end.

Carry the box at early dawn

Into your kitchen; o'er your lawn,

stable,

For one whole year. Then you'll be able
To turn the key and find the churn:
Which must rediess your present harm."
With thanks the supplinnt went away,
Resolved most strictly to obey.

Next morn he rose at early-dawn,
And took his box across the lawn
And through the gmunds. Alzlsl alas!

No careful gairlener mowed the grass,

The weeds were choking up the llow'm,

And brizus and nettles filled the bow'rs.
Into the kitchen he carries it:

And while the blazing chimney mam

The lazy cook unconscious snares;

The wine is running from the cask,--

No gloom supplies their daily needs.

__.____

DIY sons, you think I leave you poor,
But somewhere on this piece of
ground,
(Which I bequeath you) well concealed.
A buried treasure may be found.
Seek it with industry and care."
Thus to his mns the old man said,
Guve them his blessing and farewell,
And calmly joined the happy dead.

The sons obeyed: early and late
They dug the hard and barren soil,
Which soon became a fertile spot,
And well repaid their anxious toil;
For as each portion was explored,
By digging long and digging deep,
They sowed it with the golden seedr
And harvests soon were fit to reap.

But when the last bxu'e spot was (lug,
And nothing found, the eldest son
Spoke thus; "I understand our sire;
Brothers, behold the treasure wonl
We've found it in the well-tilled earth,
That bears this golden waving grain,
And in the lesson we have learnt
That honest toil brings certain gain."

THE
FOX AND THE STORK'

 

MERRY Fox one day invited
A neighb'ring Stork with him to
dine;
The long-billed bird was much delighted.
And came, in Paris fashions fine.
But when the two sat down to table,
A shallow dish of soup was set,
From whence the poor Stork was not
able

The very tiniest drop to get;
And while he vainly tried a taste to sup,
Lo! mocking Reynold licked the nice
soup up!

Soon Mrs. Sgk invites friend Reynold
To come and share a little treat.
He goes. A vase, long-necked and slen-
der,
Is sol, from which the two must eat.
Poor Roynard cannot reach a. morsel,
And vainly tries his nose to poke
Within the shallow op'ning,--finding
No great wit in the present joke!

"I see," he thought, "jests at our friends'
expense
Are rather proofs of folly than of sense."THE LARK AND HER YOUNG ONES

--.._

R Y children," said a Mother-Lark,
" The harvest-lime is drawing near.
While I am gone to seek your food,
Take heed to all you chance to hear;
For ere the farmer cuts his wheat,
We all must seek another home.
Still, I would linger in the last:
'Tis sad iiom this sweet spot to roam."

That morning from their cosy nest
The wee birds heard the farmer say,

" Johnnie, my son. the wheat is ripe.
"l'would do to cut this very (lay.

Friends and acquaintance all let know
That we require a helping hand

To reap the wealth of golden airs
Waving in sunshine o'er the land.

When home the Mother-Lark returned,
The nestlings told her what they'd
heard:
" Dear mother, we must go," they chirped.
" Nay, there's no hurry," said the bird,
" We well may stay a day or two;
Wait till you hear a little more."
Next day the farmer came again,
And talked to Johnnie as before.

" Our friends have not arrived," he said;
"Johnnie, to our relations send,

And beg your uncles and their sons
Help in our harvest-field to lend."

 

" The farmer's for his cousins sent!"
The hiwls exelaim; "0 mother dear,

Pray save us from the cruel scythe!
We must not longer linger here!"

" No hurry," said the wise old Lark;

"We have as yet no cause to fear;
But watch and listen carefully.

And let me know what next you hear."
All the next day the nestlings saw

The farmer standing by the gate:
Till the red sun set in the west

They saw him vainly watch and wait.

Then cried he, in a lusty voice,

"We'll wait no longer now, my son;
We'll cut the wheat with our own hands
To-mormw morn, and get it done."

The nestlings told the mother-bird,
When on the nest slrc sank at eve,
What they had heard. "Ah, now," she

said,
" The time has come oru- home to leave.

"Friends and acquaintances, I know,
Are apt to fail in time of need;
Relations often will delay;
But self-done tasks are done indeed.
I've learned by watching birds and men,
Wherever I have built a nest,
That. they who wait upon themselve-
Arc served the first and served the best."THE OLD MAN AND HIS ASS.

_4_

AN old man and his son one day

To the next town were on their way.
The boy was seated on the ass,

When some rude men who chanced to pass
Cried, "What a shame that led should ride,
And his old father wnlk beside!"

The old man fain would please the town;
He bids his son at once get down,

And mounts himself; but by-and-bye

He hears an old ch, passing by,

Say, "Really, it is much too bad

To tire, by walking, such a 1nd,

While P. strong man rides lazy on."

No sooner is the speaker gone

Than the old man, to please once more.
Bids his son mount and ride befoie.

But soon some other voices cry,

" Look at these riders coming by!

Two men upon a. poor tired fwd--J

Such cruelty l--Alasl alssl

Shuroly it better fits you two

To hear the ass than it bear you!"

The old man bids his son descend,

Lest they should these new folks offend,
And lifting up the struggling ass,

Tries with it o'er a bridge to pass.

The donkey--not used to such ways--
Struggles and kicks, and loudly brays.
The people to the river run,

Laughing aloud, to see the fun;

But soon the donkey over gm,

And felling where the river flows,

ls home away by the swift stream,

And never more will it be seen.

Thus all the foolish old man gains

Is to be loser for his pains,

And (trying to please every one)

Finds he has failed when all is done.6% 5w
