DANIEL DEFOE.

 

    
  
 

wEl-'OE, the author of Robinson Crusoe. would be ea-
;\ titled to a prominent place in the history of our litera-
l! lure even had he never given to the world that truly
" admirable production ; and yet we may reasonably
question whether the name of Defoe would not long
ago have sunk into oblivion, or at least have been known.
. like those of most of his contemporaries, only to the
- curious student, were it not attached to a work whose popularity
5 has been rarely cqualled--ncver,pcrhnps. excelled. Even as it is,
the reputation due to the writer has been nearly altogether absorbed
' in that of his hero, and in the all-engrossing interest of his adven-
tures. Thousands who have read Robinson Crusoe with delight.
and derived from it a satisfaction in no wise diminished by re

crusal, have never bestowed a thought on its author, or, Indeed,
regarded it in the light of a literary performance. While its fascination
has been universally felt, the genius that conceived it. the talent that er-
fected it, have been generall overlooked, merely because it is so {til 0!
nature and reality as to ex ibit no invention or exertion on the part of
the author, inasmuch as he appears simply to have recorded what actually
happened and consequently on! to have committed to paper lain matter
effect. without study or embe lishment. We wonder at an are struck
with admiration by the powers of Shakespeare or Cervantes; with regard
to Defoe we experiereo no similar feelings; it is not the skill of the artist
that enchants us, but the perfect naturnlucss of the picture, which is such
thatwc mistake it fora mirror: so that every reader persuades himself
that he could write as well, perhaps better. were he but furnished with the
materials for an equally interesting narrative.

There are many circumstances in Defoe's own history that would rec-
ommend it to the notice of the biographer. independently of his claims as
the author of Robinson ; among which are the variety and extraordinary
number of his literary performances, amounting to no fewer than two hun-
dred and nine different publications ; and the no less singular fact that the
masterpiece of his genius was not onlv his first <<say In that species of
composition, but was not produced till he was for advanced in years. he
having then arrived at a period of life when the generality of authors close
their literary career, and when the powers of imagination either lose much
of their vigor, or become altogether torpid. Nor will our surprise at De-
foe's industry, and the almost unprecedented fertility of his pen, be at allxiv IIOGRAPHICAL BKITCK 0"

diminished by considering that he was not a recluse stndent or professed
scholar, but was engaged in trade and various other speculations. In one
respect. however, his mercantile occupations contributed to lay. the foun-
dation to his excellence as a novel writer. since there can be little doubt
that it is to his actual cx rrience of the sea, and his acquaintance with
other countries. we are indc ted for that truth and spirit which animate the
more interesting parts of Robinson Crusoe; while' the manly good sense.
niuul'eclcd earnestness. and fund of nalive intell:goncc. have placed him fur
nlmvc those who presume to undervalue his lib-rar acquirements.

According to the. latest and most copious of all 's biograph' rs. Daniel
Defoe was born in 1661, two years earlier than the generally assigned date
of his birth. His father was a butcher in the pnrish of St. Giles. Cripple-

ate. and appears to have been a citizen in easy circumstances, although
his trade woe one that confers no articular lustre on a pedigree. It is usual
to effect some degree of astouiy ment when we wad of men whose after
fume pix-suntan striking contrast to the humilit of their origin; yet we
must recollect that it is not ancestry and splen id descent. but education
and circumstances which form the man; and in this respect the middling
classes possess a decided advantage over those either below or above them :
for if the fomn-r are precluded from cultivating their talents and abilities,
the latter generallv consider themselves exempt from the necessity of doing
so. and accordingiy content themselves with cultivatiu mere external ac-
complishments. in preference to exercising their manta encrgi. s. Those,
on the contrary. who are plan. d in the middle station, while they are. not
d barred from the means of application. fee] that stimulus to exertion
which arises from the desire of ac uiring fortune or foam. The history of
such men as Ximencs. Wolsey, Al wroni. and Na ilcon. may, indeed. Just-
ly excite uur wonder; when, too. we behold un ettered genius emergin ,
in spite of evcrv obstacle. from the obscurity to which it seemed condemne ,
as in a Fen-gusson. a Duval. a Burns. and an Opie. we may lie permiitcd to
express our astonishment; but as regards his origin. the hifitury of Defoe is
that of thousands who have afterward raised tlicmsclws into comparative
elevation by the display) of their powers. The solicitudc, therefore, so
gem-rally displayed by iogrsihers. on similar occasions. to trace some
consanguinity wit a more dignified branch of their families. for those whose
native obscurity Sevrus to demand some apology. betrays a rather mistaken

ulicy. However this may be, it is certain that it is quite as honorable for
)efoe to have acorn/loci from a butcher as it would have been to have do-
scmdcd from the Con neror himself.

(inc undoubted an very great advantage, for which Defoe was indebted
to his parents. Who Wrro Nonconfurmvsts. was an education superior to
what" was than usual for persons in thrir station to bestow upon their
children ; and they Were careful also to implant in his youthful mind that
regard for n-ligion. and that strict moral integrity. Which afterward dis-
played themseh'i-s not only in his writings. but his conduct thmnuh life.
And thus rect;tudc of principle he most unequivocally evinced when his
misfortunes put it so severely to the proof. At about the age of fourteen.
he was placed under the tuition of the Rev. Charles Morton. of Newington
Green. who was afterward vice-president of Harvard College, New England;
and from various incidental remarks in his own works. it appem that
young Defoe now eaten-d upon an extensive course of studies. and made
considerable proficienev in languaues. mathematics. philosophv. hiatorv.
and theology : although the natuml liveliness of his disposition nhfitted him
for that severe application which is necessary to form a profound scholarin
any'ono of those pursuits.

was the intention of his parents that he should embrace the clerical
profession. which their religious feelings. and probshly a very pardonghlg
unbition. induced them to select for him; yet. notwithstanding his regard
for the Sak'l'l'll other. he was unmllim,r to embrace it himself: or events. at
least, diverted his talents into another channel. The political and religious
:xcitements of that period wure contagious for one of Defoe's temper: ho
sssumed the character of the patriot as soon as he cast off that ol'the Loy,
and espoused the side if the popular party with all the nrdor of youth;
nor was it,long before he had opportunities of distinguishing himself. He
was a warm advocate for the liill of Exclusion. passed by the Commons to
prevent the saeerssion ot' the Duke of York to the throne; and regarded
with ahhorrcneu that spirit of despotism which sentenced Sydney and so
many others to the seaii'uld. At the are of twenty-one he commenced
author, which employment he continuu for nearly half a century. and
that. too. almost unintwrnptedly. notwithstanding his various speculations of
a dilfi rent nature. it cannot be. expected that in a skclcli of this nature we
should attempt to give anything like a connected account of Dcfne's various
literary performances, they being too nunu-ruus and multifarious for us to
advert to them separately, even if we conceived th -t by so doing We should
greatly interest the readers of this--the most. distinguished ofthem all.
But the truth is. the majority ofthem are of that class which it is rather
the province of till:llillllna'rJlllIl'r than the critic to deserilw. We may,
however. here mention the first production of his pen. which. under the
singular tile of " Speculum irrape- vowuurum." was a reply to a publica-
tion of l'ogi-r L'Estrnnge's, a noted party writer of that day. In this work
Defoe indulged in rather intempcrate language. and while vindicating the
dissenters. reflected in too hostiie and in -riiuiante a manner it ion tho
established clergy 'l'iiEs was succeeded by a " Treatise against the urlis."
occasioned by the war between them and the iiiipcrinl.sts; and was penned
by Defoe for the purpose of showing his countrymen that. it' it was the in-
ten-st of Protestantism not to inert-use the influence of a Catholic poorer. it
was infinitely more so to oppose Mohammedan one ; which. however dc-
l)l|i('3l)lc it might appear to politicians. was almost too obvious n truism to
lie cuiitlucl to any merit for Its sag-<<city. It is the. fate of political publica-
tions quickly to fall into oblivion after the events which call them lilrth have
passed away; the reputation derived from them is as transitory n: the
events themselves. or if the fame of the writer Occasionaily descends to pos-
terity. it is more than can be affirmed of his writings.

Shortly after this. Defoe proved that he was as ready to support the doc-
triues he advocated by the. sword as by the pen. He necontingl ' joined
the standard of the Duke of Monmouth, when the latter landed in lingland
with a view of expelling n Catholic prince from the throne. and seatin
himself upon it as the defender of Protestantism. The issue of that ad-
venture. and the subsequent fate of tho unfortunate. if not perfl-ctly inno-
cent, Monmouth are well known. Happier than the leader of the enter-

risc. it was Defoe's better luck to escape. He returned to the unetropo-
is in safctv: and. abandoning politics and warfare. was content for a

while to turn his attention to the more humble but less stormy pursuits of
trade.

He now became a limit-r, or rather a hose-factor. that. is, a kind of agent
between the. mnuufiteturer and retailer: and. according to Mr. Chalmers.
he continued to carry on this concern from 1685') to 1695. It was about
two years after he had thus established himself. that he was admitted it
liverymsn of London. on the 26th of January. 1687--'8. Business. however.
did not so entirely absorb his attention but that. he found time to engage in
the various controv es that agitated the public mini. and which were
occasioned by the arbitrary measures of James, who, feeling himself scout.'8" IIOORAPKICAL BKI'I'CH of

trieve his finances fit his win. The country being then engaged in an
expensive war with France, )cfoc proposud a scheme to assist the govern.
incnt in raising 'deg ho ways and means ;" and Sun": lime afterward he re-
ceived the appointment of accountant to the commissioners of the class
duty; but it proved onlya temporary one. as the duty was repealed in
August, 1699. Probahlv it was also about the same period that he became
Secretary to tho tile-ivorhs at'l'ilbnry. in which concern he embarked some
money, and was again a sufferer. His " Essay on Projects," published in
Janunrv. 1696--7. shows him to have been. if not a very successful speculutor
himself} at least a very ingenious and fertile deviser of theoretical plans,
most of which muat he allovred to have the welfare of sm-iety in view -. nor
inure they been without influence in leading to many improvements of later
times; among; those which have been n'uctically adopted. we may men-
tion his scheme for Frienlly Societies an: Saving Banks. Were any testi-
mony required in favor of this work, it \vunl-l be sufficient to quote that of
the celebrated Franklin. wlncunfesses that the impressions he received
from it gave a strong bias to his own pursuits.

If not invariably employed in the active defenceof public morals, Defoe's
pen was too honest to betray th.-ir interests on any occasion: it was not
always that his topics called for. or even almilted. any direct inculealions
of virtue, lint whenever they di-l. h: displayed his earnestness in its behalf.
Ills publication entitled "The Poor Mum's Plea" is u very keen piece of

upper classes ot's veil-ty. in which he urges them to discountennnce hy thrir

mon decency. that. whatever infamy there may have been in either toler-
ating or in attempting to defend such a system of lcwdness, there could be
no great. triumph in exposing that which did not even attempt to conceal
itself.

We have now to notice our author in a somewhat different charm-{era

of the nmuncr--since both that and all Defoe'u other attempts of the hind

po- 1.. and not. even a decent versilier. Yet could gratitude and enthusiastic
devotion to his prince have suppiicd the inspiration which the muses de-

Iraqis which he published at this intervul. we must. pass by. nnd conic
dxt'c-vl'ly to an event that obtained for our author a rather nnenviable speczei
oz' disjunction. The reign of Anne commenced with much violence and
with cabals between the respective church parties. leading to controversies
that rather fanned than alloyed the public ferment. On such an occaston,
it was not to be expected that Defoe would remain passive; assuming the
furious tone of the high-churchmen of the day against the dissenters. he
published a small pamphlet. which was in reality a satire upon the writings
which that party had issued from the press ; but the irony was so fine. and
the imitation so exact. that while it was supposed by them to utter the
real sentiments of the writer, it was also interpreted by those whom it
was intended to serve as coming from a violent enemy. The "Shnrtmt

merely because they have been so repeatedly handled by later writers. that
both the wit and argunnnt deployed in them have 10:1. their freshness.
This circumstance, however, <<low: not detract from Defoc's intrinsic merit,
or from the praise due. to him as an originator ; on the contrary, he, in this
respect, only shares the fate common to all those who open a new path in
literature or art, inviting imitators whose number oppress, if they do not
overwhelm them ; thatdkloc has not since been surpas. ed in this species
of writing is far more than we can venture to assert; yet it should be
recollect-d that it is the first navigator of the Atlantic, not those who cross
it in a modern steamboat, who claims the homage of our admiration.

Those who are unacquninted with Defoe the essayist, as well as Defoe
the novelist, will not be able to appreciate the extent of our author's
powers, and the variety of his information. But Wl' have nlread ' dwelt
upon the "Review" at greater length than is consistent with the irevity
we must perforce observe: it is time, therefore, to proceed with our nar-
mtive. Mr. Harley. afterward earl of Oxford, happened, hya change in
the ministry, to come into power, after Defoe had been about two years
in confinement, and being able to appreciate his abilities--perhaps anxious
to secure them in his own support, he represented his case to the neon,
who generously sent a sum of money to his wife and family, and not icr to
discharge his line and prison expenses. Imun-uli-ztily upon his liberation,
Defoe retired to Bury St. Edmunds. It was the that. he wrote his mas-
terly treatise, entitled "Giving Aims no Charity," in which he displays
great practical knowledge, with enlarged and sound views on the causes of
povert'. and on tho e:nplo_\'nn-ntol' the poor. In the intervals of these
and ol er occupations. for it should be observed that he. had been sent in
170-3 by Harley on a secret mi<<inn to the. continent, the express object of
which has not tranSpirvd--he found leisure to unploy his pen on other
subjects, and anticipating his future character of a romance write-mire
familial the "true narrmive" of Mrs. Venl's apparition, which was pre-
fixed ton translation of Drelincourt on Death. The supposed stranger from
the other world is made to recommend that performance; and. as such
azipnuaiurnl testimony was irre 'ble, the whole impression, which had
helium: lain on the, booksellcr's Filt'l\9.\, was quickly sold. and was succeeded
by many others. the work having since paswd through forty different edi-
tions. 'l'liia strntngem certainly dot-s honor to Defoe s ingenuity and pene-
trntinn; yet whether it be entirelyjustilinhle, considering the tendency of
the deception, may be doubted.

Leaving for a while the account of his literary csrecr.wc must now
briellr notice a rerv im )ortnnt national subject, namely, the Union with
Seotlimd, in which, .besii es warmly advocating the measure with his pen,
Defoe was personally employed. At the recommendation of Barley and
Lord Godolphin. by whom he had been recommended to the queen, he
was son": on a mission to Edinburgh, in which city he arrived in October,
1706. Hum, i1; should seem, he was chiefly employed in making calcula-
tions relating to trade and taxes. for the information of the committees of
parliament; he also occupied himself in collecting those documents relative
to the Union which he afterward published. Besides this, he proposed
several plans for encouraging the manufactures, and for promoting the
tmde. wealth. and maritime resources of Scotland. After an absence of
about sixteen months, he returned to England in 1708, when his services

ward, his patron Hurley was disunssed from office. through the persevering
intrigues ol' the duehesa of Mnlhorongh. whom he had supplanted in the
queen's favor. an event that. suddenly overclouded Defoc's political pros?
poet. Without cman'ot'nisiug his pnneiples, hchver. he espoused the in--
ten-st of the "leave mg ministry; but although Godolpltin treated him
with consideration. he suffered ll!!! pension to full into arrears. perhaps in
consequence of Defoe'a long absence in Scotland. whither-he was again
despntehcd n few months niterwnrd. upon some secret business. In thc
following year. thJL). Defoe published a work which, to use the words of an
eminent living critic. "plneis him among the soundest historians of the
day ;" and which, according to the testimony of another. would hnve
handed down his name to posterity. even hud he not immortalized himself
In" Rohituon Crusoe. This was his " History of the Union," which is as
interessing for the minute descriptions it gin-s of the nctors and incidents
in thnt import-int. ment. as for the documents it furnishes.

Still enguged in politics, Defoe's continued and severe attacks against
the Tories and high-church party so exasperated them. that they uttempted
to suppress his writings. not even threatened him with prosecutions ; their
animositv. however. did not. procure for him, from those whose. cause he
defended. u degree of favor and support. at all commensurate with his lung
and nble services. He had also to contend with fresh pecuniary losses in
some eoncL-ru in whirl: he was engaged (lTl'i) with Mr. Wood. n mercet of
Coleshtll in Wurwiekdiire, nnd With the personal nhuse with which his
churucter wns assailed by writers who reflected upon him as being it knuv-

question Were nl'n directly opposite tendency. The queen once more he-
stowed n free pardon on him. and the malice of his numerous enemies was
defeated. From this time he employed his pen only oeeusiounily on politi-
cal subjects. By the accession of George J. to the throne. Defoe gained
nothing. nlthough his writings had strenuously plended the cause of the
House of llanowr during the late reign; nnd although he had superior
claims upon public gratitude for the zeal with which. during nearly thirty
)'cnrs. he had not only advocated religious and political independence. but
endeavored to cull nttention to subjects of pnrmnouut importance to tho
nationul prosperity. That this neglect should. in spite of all his philoso-
phy, have occmioued him considerable mortifiention. is not much to be
wondered at; and to the. effect it. had upon his health was attributed nn

After so serious a blow to his constitution. and n1: his advanced period 0|

least remit his exertions. Yet it was subsequently to this apparently
cloudy epoch of his career thnt the brightest and most. durable of his lite

by on equal degree of vigor and rnciness of intellect: when. however, such

recruit the mental energies. Defoe at least may be quoted as an extraor-

happens that an author's expectations are surpassed by the success of his

Astonishing as was the success of Dcfoc's romance, it did not deter the
envious from nttcmptiiig to disparage it. The materials, it was said. were
eitiicr furnished by, or surreptitiously obtained from. Alexander Selkirk, s
mariner who had resided for four years in the desert islnml of J unn Fernan-
dvz, and returned to England in 'l'ill. Very pi'uluihly, his storyJ'hich
then excited considerable interust and attention, did suggest. to Defoe the
idea of writing' his romance; but nll the details and incidents are entirely
his own. Most certainly Dcfue had obtained no papers or written docu'
ments from Selkirk. as the latter had none to communicate. So far, how-

that it was composed by that nobleman during his imprisonment in the
Tower, in 1715, on s charge of high treason; and they have urged that the
whole tone of the work, especially of Iliat part toward the conclusion
where an account is given of the exiled nobles of Mnscovy, is what would
naturally be suggested by the solitude of a prison. Yet as for as internal

Robinson's Family, etc--Bin Elopement from hi: Parent:

 

{S WAS horn in the year 1632, in the city of York, of a. good
Q. family, though not of that country, my father being a for-
V E eigner of Bremen, named Krcutznuer, who settled first at

Hull. He got a. good estate by merchandise, and leaving ofi'
his trade, lived afterward at York; from whence ho had married
my mother. whose relations were named Robinson, a very good family
in that country, and after whom I was so called, that is to say, Rob-
inson Kreutznaer; but by the usual corruption of words in England,
we are now called, nay, we call ourselves, and write our name, Crusoe ;
and so my companions always called me.

I had two elder brothers. one of whom was lieutenant colonel, to
on English Regiment of foot in Flanders, formerly commanded by
the famous Colonel Lockhort, and was killed at the battle near Duu-
kirk against the Spaniards. What became of my second brother, I
never knew, any more than my father and mother did know who: was
become of me.

Being the third son of the family, and not bred to any trade, my
Lend began to be filled very early with rambling thoughts. My
father, who was very aged, had given me a competent share of learn-
ing, us far as house education and a country free school generally go,
and designed me for the law: but I would he satiatim'l with nothing
but going to sea; and my inclination) to this led me so strongly against
the will, nay, the commands of my father, and against all the outrea-
tiou and persuasions of my mother and other friends, that there seemed26 ADVENTURB or

to be something fatal in that propension of nature, tend ng directly to
the life of misery which was to bcfell me.

My father, a wise and grave man, gave me serious and excellent
counsel against what he foresaw was my design. He called me one
morning into his chamber, where he was confined by the gout, and
expontulated very warmly with me upon this subject ; he asked me
what: reasons, more than a mere wandering inclination, I had for
aaving his house, and my native country, where 1 might be well in-
troduced, and had a prospect. of raising .my fortune, by application
and industry, with a life of ease and pleasure. lle told me it was
men of desperate fortunes, on one hand, or of superior fortunes, on
the other, who went abroad upon adventures, aspiring to rise by on-
terprise, and make themselves famous in undertakings of a nature out
of the common road; that. these things were all either too far above
me, or too far below me; that mine was the middle state, or what
might be called the upper station of low life. which he had found, by
long experience, was the best state in the world, the most suited to
human happiness ; not exposed to the miseries and hardships, the
labor and sufferings, of the mechanic part of mankind, and not em-
barrassed with the pride, luxury, ambition, and emy of the upper pa:-
of mankind; he told me, I might judge of the happiness of this state
by one thing, viz., that this was the state of life which all other people
envied,- that. kings have frequently lament-ed the miserable conse-
quences of being born to great things, and wished they had been
placed in the middle of two extremes, between the mean and the great;
that the wise man gave his testimony to this as the just standard of
true felicity, when he prayed to have " neither poverty nor riches."

lle bade me observe it, and I should always find, that the calamities
of life were shared among the upper and lower part of mankind ; but.
that the middle station had the fewest disasters, and was not exposed
to so many viciSsitudes as the higher or lower part of mankind : nay,
they were not subjected to so many distempers and unouinesses, either
of body or mind, as these were, who, by vicious living, luxury, and
extravaganciea, on the one hand, or by hard labor, want of necessa-
ries, and mean and insufficient. diet, on the :thcrhand, bring distem
pet's upon themselves by the natural. consequences of their way of
living; that the middle station of life was calculated for all kinds of
virtues, and all kinds of enjoyments ; that peace and plenty were the
handmaids of a middle fortune; that temperance, moderation, quiet-
ness, health, society, all agreeable diversions and all desirable pleas-
ures, were the blessings attending the middle station of life: that thl:x

way men went silently and smoothly through the world, nnd cement.
ably out of it, not embarrassed with the inbors of the hands or of the
bend, not sold to the life of slavery {or daily bread, or harassed with
perplexed circumstances, which rob-the soul of peace, end the body
of rest; not enraged with the passion of envy, or secret burning lust
of mnhition for great things; but, in easy circumstances, sliding gently
through the world, and sensibly tasting the sweets of living, without
the bitter; feellug that they are happy, and learning, by every day's
experience, to know it more sensibly.

After this he pressed me earnestly, and in the most afi'octione'e
manner, not to play the young man, nor to precipitate myself into
miseries which nature and the station of life 'l was born in, seemed to
have provided against; thutl was under no necessity of seeking my
bread ; that he would do well-for me, and endeavor to enter me fairly
into the station of life which he had been just recommending to me ,
end that if I was not very easy and happy in the world, it must be
my more PSth or fault that must hinder it; and that he should have
nothing to answer for, having thus dischnrged his duty in warning
me against measures which he knew would be to my hurt; in a. word,
that, us he would do very kind things for me if I would stay and settle
nt home, as he directed; so he would not have so much hood in my
misfortunes as to give me any encouragement to go away; and to close
ell, he told me I had my elder brother for an example, to whom he
had used the some earnest persuasiona to keep him from going into
the Low Country wars; but could not prevail, his young desires
prompting him to run into the army, where he was killed; and though,
he said. he would not cease to pray for me, yet he would venture to
say to me, that if I did take this foolish stop, God would not bless me,
and I would have leisure, hereafter, to reflect upon having neglected
his counsel, when there might be none to assist in my recovery.

I observed in the last pnrt of his discourse, which was truly pro-
phetic, though, I suppose, my father did not know it to be so himself;
I say I observed the tears run down his Face very plentifully, mpeciully
when he spoke of my brother who was killed; and that, when he
spoke of my having leisure to repent, and none to assist mo, he was
so moved that he broke 03' the discourse, and told me his heart we:
so full, he could say no more to me.

1 was sincerely nfi'ected with this discourse, as, indeed, who could
be otherwise? and I resolved not to think of going abroad any more,
but to settle at home, accordingto my father's uesire. But, also! a
few days were it all of; and, in short, to prevent any of my father's18 nomrnnss or

further importunities, in a few weeks after, I resolved to run quite
away from him. However, [did not not so hastily neither, as my
first heat of resolution prompted, but I took my mother, at a. time
when I thought her a little pleasanter than ordinary, and told her that
my thoughts were so entirely bent upon seeing the world that I should
never settle to anything with resolution enough to go through with it,
and my father had better give me his consent than force me to go
without it; that I was now eighteen years old, which was too late to
go apprentice to in trade, or clerk to an attorney; thatI was sure, if I
did, I should never servo out my time, and I should certainly run
away from my master before my time was out, and go to sea; and if
she would speak to my father to let me make but one yoyage almond,
if I came home again, and did not like it, I would go no more, and I
Would promise by a double diligence, to recover the time I had lost.

This put my mother into a great passion; she told me she knew it
Would be to no purpose to speak to my father upon any such a sub-
ject; that he know too well what was my interest to give his consent
to anything so much to my hurt, and that she wondered how I could
think of any such thing, after the discourse I had had with my father,
and such kind and tender expressions as she know my father had used
to me ; and that, in short, if I would ruin myself, there was no help
for me; but l might. depend I should never have their consent to it;
that, for her part. she would not have so much hand in my destruc-
tion, and I should never have it to say that my mother was willing
when my father was not.

Though my mother refused to move it to my father, yet I heard
afterward, that she reported all the discourse to him ; and that my
father, after showing great concern at it, said to her, with a. sigh,
" That boy might be happy if he would stay at home, but if he goes
nbroud he will he the most miserable wretch that ever was born ; I
can give no cement to it."

It was not till almost a year after this that I broke loose, though
in the meantime I continued obstinately deaf to all proposals of set-
tling to business, and frequently oxpoxtulating with my father and
mother about their being so positively determined against what they
knew my inclinations prompted me to. But, being one day at Hull,
whither I went casually, and without any purpose of making an
elopement at that time, and one of my companions then going to
London by sea in his hither-'3 ship, and prompting me to go with them
by the common allurement of seafaring men, viz, that it should cost
me nothing for my passage, I consulted neither father nor mothernomsox enema. 29

any more, nor so much as sent them word of it, but left them to hear
of it as they might; without asking God's blessing, or my father'n
without any consideration of circumstances or consequences, and in
an ill hour, God knows.

.7: N the lat of September, 1651, I went on board it ship bound
\ for London. Never any young mlveuturer's misfortunes,I
1 . believe, began younger, or continued longer than mine.
The ship haul no sooner got out of the lIumher than tho
wind begun to blow, and the waves to rise in a most frightful man-
ner; and, as I had never been at sea before,I was most inexpressibly
sick in body and terrified in mind. I began now seriously to reflect
upon what I had done, and how justly I was overtaken by the judg-
ment of Heaven, for wickedly leaving my father's house. All the
good counsels of my parents, my father's tears, and my mother's en-
treatiesg came new fresh into my mind, and my conscience, which
was not yet come to the pitch of hardness to which it has been since,
rcproachcd me with the contemyt of advice and the abandonment of
duty.

All this while the storm increased, and the sea, which I had never
been upon before, went very high, though nothing like \vhnt I have
seen many times since; no, nor what I saw a few days after; but,
such as it was, enough to affect me then, who was but a. young sailor,
and had never known nnythingof the matter. I expected every wave
would have swallowed us up, and at every time the ship fell down,
as I thought, into the trough or hollow of the sea, we should never
rise more; and, in this agony of mind, I made many vows and refio
lutious, that if it would please God to spare my life this voyage, if
ever I got my foot once on dry land, I would go directly home to my
father, and never set it into a ship again while I lived; that I would
take his advice, and never run myself into such miseries as these any
more. Now I saw plainly the goodness of his observations about the
middle station of life; how easy, how comfortable he had lived all
his days, and never had been exposed to tempests at sea or troubles

on shore, and I resolved that I would, like a true repenting prodigal,
go home to my father.
These wise and sober thoughts continued during the storm, and.
indeed. some time after; but. the next day, as the wind was abated.
and the seat calmer, I began to he a little inured to it. However, I
was very grave that day, being also a. little seasick still--hut toward
night the weather cleared up, the wind was quite over, and a charm-
ing lino evening, followed; the sun went down perfectly clear, and
rose so the next morning, and having little or no wind and n. slnooth
sea, the sun shining upon it, the sight was, on I thought, the most do
lightl'ul that I ever snw.

I had slept well in the night, and was now no more seasick but
very cheerful, looking with wonder upon the son that was so rough
and terrible the day before, and could he so calm and pleasant in a
little time after.

And now, lost my good resolution should continue, my companion,
who lmd indeed enticed me a\\':ty,enmc to me and said, " Well, Bob,"

and we'll forget all that. D'ye see what charming weather 'tis now i"

To make short this sad port of my story, we went the way of all sail-
on ; the punch was made, und I was made drunk with it; and in that
one night's wickedness I drowned all my repentance, all my reflections
upon my past conduct,ond all my resolutions for the future. In a word_

forgot the vows and promises I had made in my distress. I found,
indeed, some intervals of reflection, and serious thoughts did, us it
were, endeavor to return again sometimes; but I shook them at}, and
reused myself from them as it were from a distemper, and applying
myself to drink and company, soon mustered the return of these fits,
for so I called them, and had, in fire or six days, got as complete a
victory over conscience M only young sinner that resolved not to be

deliverance, the next was to be such a one as the worst and most
hardened wretch among us would confess both the danger and the
mercy of.

The sixth day of our being at sea we came into Yarmouth Roads
the wind having been QOutrary, and the weather calm, we-had made
but little way since the storm. llerc we were obliged to come to an
anchor, and here we lay, the wind continuing contrary, viz., st south-
west, for seven or eight days, during which time e'great many ship.
from Newcastle came into the same reads as the common harbor
where the ships might wait for a. wind for the river Thames. We
had not, however, rid here so long but we should have tided up the
river, but that the wind blew too fresh, and after we had lain four '
or five days, blew very hard. However, the roads being reckoned as
good as a barber, the anchorage good, and our ground tackle very
strong, our men were unconcerned, and not in the least apprehensive
of danger, but spent the time in rest and mirth, after the manner of
the see. But the eighth day, in the morning, the wind- increased, and
We had all hands at work to strike our topinasts, and make every-
thing snug and close, that the ship might ride as easy as possible.
By noon the sea went very high indeed, and our ship rode forecastle
in, shipped several seas, and we thought, once or twice, our anchor
harleomc home, upon which our master ordered out the sheet-anchor,
so that we rode with two anchors ahead, and the cables veered nut to
the better and

By this time it blew a. terrible storm, indeed ; and now I began to
see terror and :llmtz-zement in the faces of even the seamen themselves.
The master was vigilant in the business of preserving the ship; but, as
he went in and out of his cabin by me, I could hear him softly say to
himself several times, " Lord, be merciful to us! we shall be all lest;
we shall be all undone !" and the like. During these first hurries I was
stupid, lying still in my cabin, which was in the} steerage, and cannot
describe my temper. I could ill reassumc the first penitence, which I
had so trampled upon, . ml hardened myself against ;. I thought that
the bitterness of death had been past, and that this would have been
nothing too, like the first; but when the master himself came by me,
as I said just new, and said we should all be lost, I was dreadfully
frightened. I got up out of my cabin, and looked out; but such a dis
mal sight I never saw; the son went mountains high, and broke upon
us every three or four minutes. When I could look ebony! could see
nothing but distress around us; two ships, that rid- near us, We ibund

had cut their manta by the board, being deep]: laden; and our mel-
cried out that a ship, which rid about a mile ahead of us, was found
cred. Two more ships being driven from their anchors, were run ou'
of the roads to sea, at all adventures, and that with not a mast standing

two or three of them drove, and came close to us, running away, with
only their spritsails out, before the wind. Toward evening, the mate
and hoatswain of our ship bagged the master to let them cut away the
fliromast, which he was very loath to do; hut the hoatswain protesting
to him that if he did not, the ship would founder, he consented; and
when they had cut away the forcmast, tho maimnmt stood so loose, and
shook the ship so lunch, that they were obliged to out it away also, and
make a clear deck.

Any one may judge what a condition I must he in at all this, who
was but a young sailor, and who had been in such a fright het'nre at
but it little. lint it'l can express, at this distance, the thoughts I had
about me at that time, I was in tenfold more horror of mind upon at:-
couut of my former convictions, and the having: returned from them to
the resolutions I had wickedly taken at first, than I was at death itself;
and these, added to the terror of the storm, nut me into such a condi-
tion, that I can hy no words descrihe it; hat the Worst was not mum)
yet; the storm continued with such fury, that the seamen Ill-.5! \'fllves
acknowledged they had never known a w "'30. "'0 had a good rihip,
but she was deep laden, and so swfiliOWt'tl in the sea, that the st-am'cn
every now and then cried out she would founder. It was my advan-
tage, in one reaper-t, that I did not know what they meant hyfonn-ler
till I inquired. However, the storm was so violent, that I saw what is
not often seen, the master, the hoatswain, and some others more sensible
than the rest, at their prayers, and expecting every moment the ship
would go to the hottom. In the middle of the night, and under all the
rest of our distresses, one of the men, that had been down on purpose
to see, cried out, we had sprung a leak; another said there was four
feet. water in the hold. Then all hands were called to the pump. A!
that. very word my heart, as I thought, died within me, and I fell back-
ward upon the side of my bed, where lsat in the cabin. llowever, the
men roused me, and told me that I, who was able to do nothing home,
was as well able to pump as another: at which I stirred up and went
to the pump, and worked very heartily. While this was doing, the
master seeing some light colliers, who, not aide to ride out the storm,
were obliged to slip and run away to sea, and would not come near us,
ordered us to fire a gun, as a signal of distress. I, who knew nothing
what that meant, was so surprised, that I thought the ship had broke.
or some dreadful thing had happened. In a word, I was so surprisec
that I fell down in a swoon. As this was a time when everybody had
his own life to think of, no one minded me,or wh.-.t was become of me
but another man stepped up to the pump, and thrust me aside with his
foot, let me lie, thinking 1 had been dead ; and it was a great while
I); l'ore I came to myself.

We worked on ; hat the water increasing in the hold, it was appa-
rmt that. the ship would founder; and though the storm began to abate
n litllr, yet it was not possible she could swim till we might run into n
port,eo the master continued firing guns for help; and a. light ship,
who had rid it out just ahead of us, ventured a. boat. out to help us. It
was with the utmost hazard that the boat came near us, but it. was im-
possible for us to get on board, or for the boat. to lie near the ship's
side 3 till at last the men rowing very heartily, and venturing their
lives to save ours, our men cast them a rope over the stern, with u buoy
to it, and then veered it out a great length, which tlxey,al'ter great labor
and hazard, took hold of, and we hauled them close under our stern,
and got all into their heat. It was to no purpose for them or us, after
we were in the boat, to think of reaching their own ship; so all agreed
to let her drive, and only to pull her toward shore as much as we
could: and our master promised them. that if the boat was stared upon
shore, he would make it good to their master; no partly rowing and
partly driving, our boat went away to the northward, sloping toward
the shore almost as far as Winterton--Ness.

"'0 were not much more than a quarter of an hour out of our ship
when we saw her sink, and then I understood, for the first time, what
was meant by a ship's foundering in the sea. I must acknowledge, I
had hardly eyes to look up when the seamen told me she was sinking,
for from thattnoment they rather put me into the boat than that I might
he said to go in. My heart was, as it were, dead within me, partly with
fright, partly with horror of mind, and the thoughts of what was yet
heliire me.

While we were in this condition, the men yet laboring at the car to
bring the boat near the shore, we could see (when, our boat mounting
the waresz, we were able to see the shore) a great many people running
along the strand, to assist us when we should come near; but we mode
slow way toward the shore, nor were we able to reach it, till, being
past the lighthouse at Winterton, the shore falls oll' to the westward,
toward Cromer, and so the land broke off a little the violence of the
wind. llere we got in, and though not without much dilficulty,got nl.'

unfortunate men. we were used with great humanity, as well by 1.1::
urtgialz'atns of the town, who assigned us good quarters, . s ':y the 1-1"-
Llcular morvlnnts and owners of ships ; and had money girrn us suffi-
cient to carry us either to London or back to Hull, us we saw fit.

Had I now had the sense to have gone back to Hall, and have gone
home I had been happy; and my father, an emblem of our blessed
Sari-"1135 parable, had even killed the famed ealf for me; for, hearing
the Filip I went in was east away in Yarmouth Roads, it was a great
while before he had any assurance that I was not drowned.

But my ill fate pushed me on with an ohstinacy that nothing could
resist; and though I had several times loud calls from my reason,
and my more composed judgment to go home, yet I had no power to
do it. I know not. what to call this, nor will Iurge that it is a
secret, overruling decree, that hurries us on to be the instruments oi
our own destruction, even though it he heliu'e 11s, and that we rush
upon it with our eyes open. Certainly, nothing but some suoh decreed
unavoidable misery attending, and which it was impossible for me
to eneann, could have pushed me forward against the calm reasonings
and pormasions of my most retired thoughts, and against two such
visihle instructions as I had met with in my first attempt.

My comrade, who had helped to harden me before, and who was
the master's son, was now less forward than I. The first time he spoke
to me after we were at Yarmont'n, which was not till two or three
' for no. 11019. sepamt-rd in the town to sexeral quarters; I say,
the first. time he nan me, itap peared his tone u an altered and. looking
very melancholy and .'shahin'gr his head, he asked me how I did; tell-
ing: his father who I was, and how I had come this voyage. only for a
trial. in order to go farther ahroad. His father: turning to me, with
a grave and concerned tone: " Young man," says he. " you had never
ought to go to sea any more; you ought to take this for a plain and
visil-le token, that you are not to he a seafaring man." " Why, sir,"
said I, " wiil you go to sea no more i" "That. is another case," said
he; "it :.._v calling, and therefore my duty; but as you made
this voyage for a trial, you see what. a taste Heaven has given you oi
what- you are to expect. if you persist. Perhaps this has all befitllcn
us an your account, like Jonah in the ship of Tarshish. Pray," con-
tinues he, - what are you. and on what account did you go to sea?"
l'pon that I told him some of my story ; at the end of which he burst
out with n. strange kind of passion. "What had I done," said he
"that such an unhappy wretch should have come into my Nhip'l ]
would not set my foot in the some ship with the. again for a then.
sand pounds." This indeed was, as I said, an excursion of his spirits.
which were yet agitated by the sense of his loss, and was farther than
he could have authority to go. However, he afterward talked very
gravely to me ; exhorted me to go back to my father, and not tempt
Providence to my ruin ; told me, I might see a visible hand of Heaven
against me ; "and, young man," said he, "depend upon it, if you do
not go back, wherever you go, you will meet with nothing _hut dis~
asters and disappointments, till your father's words are fulfilled upon
you."

We parted soon after, for I made him little answer, and I saw him
no more: which way he went, I know not: as for me, having some
money in my pocket, I travelled to London by land ; and there, as well
as on the road, had many struggles with myself what course of life I
should take, and whether Ishould go home or go to set . As to going
home, shame opposed the best motions that offered to my thoughts ;
and it immediately occurred to me, how I should he laughed at among
the neighbors, and should be ashamed to see, not my father and
mother only, but even overyhody else. From whence I have often
since observed how incongruous and irrational the common temper of
mankind is, especially of youth, to that reason which ought to guide
them in such cases, viz., that they are not ashamed to sin, and yet are
ashamed to repent ; not ashamed of the action, for which they ought
justly to be esteemed fools; but are ashamed of the returning, which
only can make them he esteemed wise men.

In this state of life, however, I remained some time, uncertain
what measures to take, and what course of life to lead. An irresist-
ible reluctance continued to going home; and as I stayed awhile, the
remembrance of the distress I had been in wore otl', and as that
abated, the little motion I had in my desires to a return were off with
it, till at last I quite laid aside the thoughts of it, and looked out for
a voyage. That evil influence which carried me first away from my
father's house. that hurried me into the wild and indigested nation of
raising my fortune, and that impressed those conceits so forcibly upon
me, as to make me deaf to all good advice, and to the entreaties, and
even the commands of my father; I say, the name influenee, whatever
it was, presented the most unfortunate of all enterprises to my view ;
and I went on board a vessel bound to the coast of Africa; or, as our
sailors vulgarly call it, a voyage to Guinea.

It was my great misfortune, that in all these adventures I did not
ship myself as a. sailor; whereby, though I might indeed have worked
I little harder than ordinary, yet, at that tme, I had learned the duty86 Anvnm'cnss or

and ofiice of a foremost-man, and in time mighthave qualified myself for
a mate or lieutenant, if not a. master; but as it was always my fate to
choose for the worse, so I did here; for having money in my pocket,
and good clothes upon my back, I would always go on board in the
habit of a gentleman: and so I neither had any business in the ship,
nor learned to do any. It was my lot, first of all, to fall into pretty
good company in London; which does not always happen to such
loose and misguided young follows as I then was; the devil, genernlly,
not omitting to lay some snare for them very early. But it was not
so with me: I first full acquainted with the master of a ship, who had
been on the coast of Guinea, and who, having had very good success
there, was resolved to go again. I10, taking a fancy to my conversa-
tion, which was not at all disagreeable at that time, and hearing me
say I had a mind to see the world, told me, that in would go the voy-
age with him, I should he utno expense; lshould be his messmate and
his companion: and if] could carry anything with me,I should have
all the advantage of it that the trade would admit; and, perhaps, I
might meet with some encouragement. I embraced the offer, and
entering into a strict. friendship with this eaptnin,who was an honest
and plain-dealing man, I went the voyage with him, and carried a
small adventure with me; which, by the disinterested honesty of my
friend the capt:\in,1 increased very considerably; for I carried about
forty pounds of such toys and triflcs as the captain directed me to
buy. This forty pounds I had mustered together by the assistance
of some of my relations whom I corresponded with; and who, I
believe, got my father, or, at least my mother, to contribute so much
ms that to my first adventure. This was the only voyage which I may
say was successful in all my adventures, and which I owe to the in-
tegrity and honesty of my friend the captain; under whom I also got
a competent linen-dodge of madmmatics and the rules of navigation,
learned how to keep an account ofthe ship's course, take anobservution,
and, in short, to Understand some things that were nccdl'ul to he un-
derstood liy a sailor: for, as he took delight to instruct. me, I took
delight to learn; and, in a word. this voyage made me both a sailor
and a merchant. For I brought home lire pounds nine ounces of
gold-flush for my adventure. which yielded me in London, at my
return, almost three hundred pounds, and this filled me with these
aspiring thoughts which have since so completed my ruin. Yet even
in this voyage I had my misfortunes, too; particularly that I was
continually sick, being thrown into a violent calcnture by the execs.

Robinson's Captivity at Saline--Escape with Jim--Arrival at the Emails.

W'AS new set up for a. Guinea trader; and my friend, to my
V great misfortune, dying soon afier his arrival, I resolved to go
3? the same voyage again; and l embarked in the same vessel
2' with one who was his mate in the former voyage, and had now
got me command of the ship. This was the unhappiest voyage that
ever man made ; for though I did not carry quite a hundred pounds
of my new-gained wealth, so that. I had two hundred pounds left, and
which I lodged with my friend's widow, who was very just to me, yet
I fell into terrible misfortunes in this voyage : and the first was this,
Viz. : our ship, making her course toward the Canary Islands, or
rather between these islands and the African shore, was surprised, in
the gray of the morning, by a Turkish rover, of Sallec, who gave chase
to us with all the sail she could make. We crowded also as much
canvas as our yards would spread, or our masts carry, to get clear;
but finding the pirate gained upon us, and would certainly come up
with us in a few hours, we prepared to fight, our ship having twelve
guns and the rover eighteen. About three in the afternoon he came
up with us; and bringing to, by mistake, just athwart our quarter, in-
stead of athwart our stern, as he intended. we brought eight of our
guns to hear on that side, and poured in a. broadside upon him, which
made him sheer off again, after returning our lire, and pouring in also
his small shot from near two hundred men which he had on board.
However, we had not a man touched, all our men keeping close. 118
prepared to attack us again, and we to defend ourselves; but laying
us on board the next time upon our quarter, he entered sixty men upon
our decks, who immediately fell to cutting and hacking the sails and
rigging. We plied them with small shot, half-pikes, powdcrvchests,
nail such like, and cleared our deck of them twice. However, to cut
short this melancholy part of our story, our ship being disabled, and
three of our men killed and eight wounded, we were ohliged to yield,
an-l were carried all prisoners into Sallee, a port belonging to the
Moors.

The usage I had there was not so dreadful as at first I apprehended;
nor was I carried up the country to the emperor's court, as the rest
of our men were. but was kept by the captain of the rover as his proper
prize, and made his slave, being young and nimble, and fit for his busi-38 novexrm .s or

ness. At this surprising change of my circumstances,from a merchant
to a miserable slave, l was perfectly overwhelmed; and now looked
back upon my father's prophetic discourse. to me, that. I should be
miserable, and have none to reliere me: which I thought was now so
effectually brought to pass, that it could not be worse: that now the
hand ofllean-n had overtaken me, and I was undone,without-redemp--
tion. But, alas! this was but a taste of the misery I was to go through,
as will appear in the Sequel of this story.

As my new patron, or master, had taken me home to his house. so I

'as in hopes ho wouhl take me with him when he went to sea again,
believing that it would, some time or other, be. his fate to be taken by
a Spanish or Portuguese man-of-war, and that then I should he set at
liberty. But this hope of mine was soon taken away, for when he
went to sea, he left me. on shore to look after his little garden, and do
the common drudgery of slaves about. his house ; and when he came
home again from his cruise, he ordered 111C to lie in the cabin, to look
after the ship.

Here I meditated nothing but my encape, and what method I might
take. to effect it, hot found no way that had the least probability in it.
Nothing presented to make. the supposition of it rational; for I had
nobody to communicate it to that would emhark with me; no follow
slave, no Englishman, Irishman, or Seoteluuan, there but myself; so
that for two years, though I often pleased myself with tho imagina-
tion, yet I never had the least encouraging prospect of putting it in
praetwo.

After about two years, an odd circumstance presented itself, which
put the old thought of making some attempt for my liberty again in
my head. My patron lying at home longer than usual, without fitting
out his ship, which, as I heard, was for want of money, he used con-
stantly, once or twice a week, sometimes oftener, if the weather was
fair. to take the ship's pinnacle, and go out into the road a fishing;
and as he always took me. and a young Moreseo with him to row the
boat, we made him very merry, and I proved very dexteroua in catch-
ing fish, insomuoh that sometimes he would send me with n. Moor, one
of his kinstnemnnd the youth, the Moresco,as they called him, to catch
a dish of fish for him.

It happened one. time, that going a fishing in a stark calm morning,
a fog rose so thick. that though we were not half a league from the
shore, we lost sight ( fit; and rowing, we knew not whither, or which
way, we labored all day, and all the next night, and when the morn-
ing came, we found we had pulled off to sea, instead of pulling in for30313803 080503. 39

the shore, and that we were at least two leagues from the shore: how-
ever, we got. well in again, though with a. great deal of labor, and
some danger, for the wind began to blow pretty fresh in the morning;
hut particularly we were all very hungry.

int our patron, warned by this disaster, resolved to take more care
of himself for the future; and having lying by him the longhoat of our
English fllllp he had taken, he resolved he would not go a fishing any
more without a compass and some provision; so he ordered the car-
penter of the ship, who was an English slave, to build 11 little state-
room or eahin in the middle of the longboat, like that of a barge, with
a place to stand behind it, to steer and haul home the main sheet, and
room hefore for a hand or two to stand and work the sails. She sailed
with what we call a shoulder-011nmttou sail, and the boom jibbed over
the top of the ealxin, which lay very snug and low, and had in it room
for him to lie, with a slave or two, and a tahlo to eat on, with some
small lockers to put in some bottles of such liquor as he thought fit to
drink, and particularly his bread, rice, and coffee.

We went frequently out with this hoat a fishing, and as I was most
dexterous to catch fish for him, he never went without me. It hap-
pened that he had appointed to go out in this hoot, either for pleasure
or for fish, with two or three Moore of some distinction in that place,
and for whom he had provided extraordinarily, and had therefore sent
on hoard the heat, overnight,a larger store of provisions than ordinary,
and had ordered me to get ready three fumes, with powder and shot,
which were on hoard his ship, for that they designed some sport of
fowling as well an fishing.

I got all things ready as he directed, and waited the next morning
with the boat washed clean, her ensign and pendants out, and every-
thing to accommodate his guests: when, hy--and-hy, my patron came
on hoard alone, and told me his guests had put off going, upon some
husiness that fell out, and ordered me with a man and boy, as usual,
to go out with the boat, and catch them some fish, for that his friends
were to sup at his house; and commanded, that as soon as I had got
some fish, I should bring it home to his house : all which I prepared
to do.

This moment my former notions of deliverance darted into my
thoughts, for now I found I was like to have a little ship at my com-
mand; and my master being gone, I prepared to furnish myself, not
for a fishing business, hut for a voyage : though I knew not, neither did

I so much na'eonsider, whither I should steer ; for anywhere, to get
out of that place, was my way.40 Anvn'rzinas or

battles stand, which it was evident, by the make, were taken out of
some English prism, and I conveyed them into the heat while the Moor
was on shut-e, an: if they had been there hetero for uur master. I eon-
\'nyed also a great lump of beeswax into the boat, which weighed about
half a hundred weight, with a. parcel of twine or thread, a hatchet, a
saw, and a hammer, all which were of great use to us afterward, es-
peeially the wax, tn make candles. Anuther trick I tried upon him,
which he innocently came into also: his name was Islnnael,whom
they call )luley, or .'dnley I so I called to him _; " Moley," said I, " our

shot? it may he we may kill some aleamies (lewls like our curlews)

" Yes," says he, "I will bring some. 5" and accordingly he brought .5
great leather pom-h, which held about a pnuvd and a half of powder
or rather mere, and another of shot, that had five or six pounds, with
some bullets, and put all into the heat: at the same time I linmd some
powder of my master's in the great cahin, with which I filled one of
the large bottles in the case, which was almost empty. pouring what
was in it into another; and thus furnished with everything needfnl, wo
sailed out of the port to fish. The castle, which is at the entrance of
the port, knew who we were, and tank no notice of us; and we were
not abnve a mile out of the port, helin'e we hauled in our sail, and set
us down to fish. The wind blew from N. V. I1, which was contrary to
my desire ; for had it hlnwn southerly, I had heen sure to have made
the mast of Spain, and at last reached the. hay of Cadiz: but my reso.
lutions were, hlow which way it would, I would be gone from the her-
rid place where I wzu, and leave the rest tn fate.

ately, for he swam like a cork, and called to me, begged to be taken
in, and told me he would go all the world over with me. He swam
50 st'mng after the boat, that he would h-tve reached me ver)
quickly, tl'ere: being but little wind; upon which I stepped into the
eahin and fetched one of the fowling pieces 3. I presented it at him, and
told him I hzul done him no hurt, and if he would he quiet, I would
do him none. "lint," said I, " you swim well enough to reach the
shore, and the sea. is calm; make the best of your way to shore, and 1
will do you no harm; but if you come near the hunt, X will shoot you
through the head ; for I am resolved to have my liberty." So he
turned himself about, and sx'um for the shore : and I make no doubt
but he reached it with ease, For he was an excellent uwinuner.

1 could have been content to have taken this Moor with me, and
have drowned the boy, but there was no venturing to trust him. When
he was gone, l turned to the, hey, whom they ealied Xury, and said to
him, " Nut-y, if you will he faithful to me I will make you a great
man; hut if you will not stroke your face to he true to me" (that is,
swear lay Nahum-at and his father's he:u't'l),"l newt throw you into the
sea. too." 'l'll': hoy smiled in my face, and spoke so innocently, that I
couhl not mistru<t him; nnd mvore to be faithful to me, and go all
over the world h me.

While ] was in View of the. Mom- that was swimming, I stood out di-
rectly to sea with the lm:tt,rnther stretrhing to wimlward, that they might
think we gone toward the strait's mouth (as, indeed, any one, that had
been in their wits, must have been supposed to do) ; for who would have
supposed we were railing on to the southward, to the truly Barbarian
Coast, where whole nations of negroeu were sure to surround 113 with
their menus, and destroy us; where we could never once go on shore
but we should he devoured by savage beasts, or more merciless sava-
ges of human kind?

But as soon as it grew dusk in the evening, I changed my course,
and steered directly south and by east, bending my course a little to-
ward the cast, that I might keep in with the shore; and having nfnir
fresh gale of wind, and a smooth quiet sea, I made such sail that, I
helieve hy the next day, at three o'clock in the afternoon, whenI
made the land, I could not he 10.1% than one hundred and fifty miles
south of Sallee, quite beyond the Emperor of Moroceo'a dominions, or
indeed, of any other king thereabout, for we saw no people.

Yet such was the fright I had taken at the Moors, and the dreadful
Ipprehensiens I had of falling into their hands, that I would not stop
or go on shore, or come w an anchor, the wind continuing fair, till .I42 mvsx'runns 0!

had sailed in that manner five days; and then the wind shifing to the
southward, I concluded also that if any of our vessels were in chose
of me, they also would now give over; so I ventured to make the
coast and came-to an anchor in the mouth of a little river; Iknew
not: what or where, neither what latitude, what country, what nation.
or what river. I neither sow nor desired to see any people; the prin-
cipal thing I wanted was fresh water. We came into this .cveek in
the evening, resolving to swim on shore as soon as it was dark, and
discover the country ; but us soon as it was quite dark, we heard such
dreadful noises of the barking, roaring and howling of wild creatures,
of we knew not whztt kinds, that the poor boy was rendy to die with
fear, and begged of me not to go on shore till day. " "fell, Xury,"
szLid I, "then I will not; but it may be, we may see men by dny, who
will be As bad to us as those lions." " Then we may give them the
shoot-gun," says Xur ', laughing; "make them run away." Such
English Xury spoke by conversing among us slaves. However-,1 was
glad to see the boy so cheerful, and I gave him n drum out of our.
patron's case of bottles to cheer him up. After all Xury's advice was
good and I took it. We dropped our little anchor, and lay still all
night. I say still, for we slept none, for in two or three hours we
saw vest creatures (we knew not what to cull them), of many sorts,
come down to the searshore, and run into the water, wallowing and
washing themselves, for the pleasure of cooling themselves ; end they
made such hideous howlings and yellings, that I never, indeed, heard
the like.

Xury was dreadfully frightened, and, indeed. so was I too ; but we
were both more frightened when we heard one of these mighty crea-
tnres swimming toward our boat; we could not see him, but we
might hear him by his blowing to he a monstrous, huge, and furious
beast. Xury said it was a. lion, and it might be so for ought I know;
but poor Xury cried to me to weigh the anchor and row away. " No,"
says I, " Kory, we can slip our cable with a. buoy to it, and go ofi'to
sen; they cannot follow us far." I had no sooner snid so but I per
oeived the creature, whatever it was, within two ours' length, which
something surprised me ; however, I immediately stepped to the cabin
door, nnd taking up my gun, fired at him; upon which he immedi-
utely turned about, and swam to the shore again.

But it was impossible to describe the horrible noises and hideous
cries and howlings that were raised, as well upon the edge of the
shore as higher within the country, upon the noise or report of the
gun: e thing, I believe, these creatures had never heard before. ThisROBINSON cannon. 43

convinced me there was no going on shore for us in the night upon
that coast; and how to venture on shore in the day, was another
question too; for to have fallen into the hands of any of the savages,
had been as bud as to have fallen into the paws of lions and tigers,-
ot least we were equally npprehensivo of the danger of it.

Be that no it would, we were obliged to go on shore somewhere or
other for water, for we had not a pint left in the boot; when and
where to get it was the point. any said, if I would let him go on
shore with one of the jars, he would find if there was any water, and
bring some to me. I asked. him why he would go; why I should not
go, and he stay in the boot? The boy answered with so much ofi'ec-
tiun that he made me love him ever after. Says he, "If wild mans
come they eat me, you go away." " Well, Xury," said I, " we will
both go, and if the wild mans come we will kill them; they shall cat
neither of us." So I gar-o Xury a piece of rusk bread to eat, and n
dram out of our patron's ease of bottles, which I mentioned before,
and we hauled in the boat as near the shore as we thought proper.
and so waded to shore, carrying nothing but our arms and two jar:
for water.

I did- not care to go out of sight of the boat, fearing the coming of
canoes with savages down the river, but the boy, seeing a low place
about a mile up the country, rambled to it, and hy-and-by I saw him
come running toward me. I thought he was pursued by some savage,
or frightenod by some wild beast, and I therefore ran forward to help
him, but when I come nearer to him I saw something hanging over
his shoulders, which won it creature that he had shot, like o hare, but
d'fl'erent in color, and longer legs; however, we were very glad of it,
end it was very good meat. But tho great joy that poor Xury came
with, wa--s to tell me he had found good water, and seen no wild mans.
But we found, afterward, that we need not take such points for water,
for a little higher up the creel: where we were, we found the water
fresh when the tide was out, which flowed but a little. way up; so we
filled our jars, and having a fire, feasted on the here we had killed,
and prepared to go on our way, having seen no footsteps of any hu-
man creature in that part of the country.

AsI had been one voyage to this coast before, I knew very well.
that the islands of the Canaries, and the Cape de Vcrd islands also,
lay not for from the coast; but on I had no instruments to take an
observation, to find what latitude we were in, and did not exactly
kMW, or at least remember what latitude they were in, I knew not
where to look for them, or when to stand of to sea toward them,44 ADVESTL'RES 0?

otherwise I might now have easily found some of these islands; but
my hope was, that if I stood along this coast till I came to the part
where the English traded, I should find some of their vessels upon
their usual design of trade, that would relieve and take us in.

By the best of my calculation, the place where I now was, must he
that country which, lying between the Emperor of Morocco's domin-
ions and the Negroes, lies waste and uninhabited, except by wild
beasts, the N egroea having abandoned it and gone farther south, for
fear of the Moors, and the Moors not. thinking it worth inhabiting, by
reason of its barrenucsa; and, indeed, both forsahing it because of the
prodigious numbers of tigers, lions, leopards, and other furious crea-
tures which hat-her there, so that the Moors use it for their hunting
only--where they go like an army, two or three thousand men at a
time--and, indeed, for near a hundred miles together upon this coast,
we saw nothing ho: a waste, uninhahitml country", by (lay, and heard
nothing but howlings and rearing of wild hens liy night.

Once or twice, in the daytime, I thought l saw the Pine of Tene-
riffe, being the top of the mountain 'l'eneriii'e, in the Canaries, and
had a great mind to venture out, in hope of reaching,' thither, but hav-
ing tried twice, I was forced in again by contrary winds, the pea also
going too high for my little vessel, an I resolved to pursue my first
design, and keep along the shore.

Several times I was obliged to land for fresh water, after we had
left this plane, and once in particular, being early in the morning, we
came to an anchor under a little point ofland, which was pretty high,
and the tide beginning to {low we lay still, to go farther in. Xury,
whose eyes were more about him than it seems mine were, cull: softly
to me, and tells me that we had best. go further of? the shore; " for,
says he, "look! yonder lies a. dreadful monster on the side of that
hilloek, fast asleep." I looked where he pointed, and saw a dreadful
monster. indeed, for it was a terrible great lion, that. lay on the side
of the shore, under the shade ofo piece of the hlll, that hung, as it
were, over him.

" Xury," says I, " you shall go on shore and kill him." Xury looked
frightened, and said, "Me kill! he eat me at one month ;" one month-
ful, he meant. However, I said no more to the boy, but bade him he
still, and I took our biggest gun, which was almost musket bore, and
loaded it with a. good charge of powder and with two (slugs, and laid
it down; then I loaded another gun with two bullets, and a third, for
we had three pieces, I loaded with fire smaller bullets. I took the
best aim I could with the first piece to have shot him in the head,nonnzsox cncson. 45

but he lay so, with his leg raised a little above his nose, that the
slugs hit his leg about; the knee, and hroko the bone; he started up,
growling at. first, but finding his leg broke fell down again, and then
got up on three legs and gave the most hideous roar that ever I heard.
I was a little surprised that I had not hit him on the head ; however,
I tool: up the second piece immediately, and though he began to move
off, tired again and shot him in the head, and had the pleasure to see
him drop and make but. little noise, hat lie struggling for life. Then
Xury took heart, and would have me let. him go on shore. "Well,
go," said I. So the boy jumped into the water, and taking a little
gun in one hand, swam to shore with the other hand, and. coming
close to the creature, put the muzzle of the piece to his ear, and shot
him in the head again, which despatehcd him quite.

This was game, indeed, to us, hot it was no food, and I was very
sorry to lose three charges of powder and shot upon a creature that
was good for nothing to us. However, Kory said he would hate some
of him, m he menus on hoard and milird me to giro him the hatchet.
" For what, Kory 2" said I. " Me out oi his head," held he. How-
ever, Xury could not cut. of? his head, but. he cut oil a fi-ctend brought
it with him, and it was a monstrous great one. l hethonght myaelf,
however, that. perlups the skin of him might, one way or other, he of
some value to or, and I resolved to take off his skin, ifI eoold. So
Xury and I went to work with him= hut XIII-y was much the better
workman at it, for I knew very ill how to do it. Indeed, it took its
both up the whole day; but at last we got ufi' the hide of him, and
spreading it. on the top of our cabin, the sun effectually dried it in
two (layn' time, and it afterward served me to lie upon.

After this stop we made on to the southward continually, for ten or
twelve days, living very sparingly on our provisions, \\ hich began to
abate very much, and going no ofterer in to the shore than we were
ohiiged to for fresh water. My design in this was to make the river
Gambia, or Senegal; that is to any, any where about the Cape do
Verd, where I was in hopes to meet; with some European ship ; and
ifI (lid not, I knew not what course I had to take, but to seek for the
island>> or perish among the Negroes. 'I knew that all the ships from
Europe, which soiled either to the coast of Guinea or to Brazil, or to
the East Indies, made this cape or those islands; and, in a word, I
put the whole of my fortune upon this single point, either that I must
meet with some ship or must perish.

When I had pursued this resolution about. ten days longer, as I
have said, I began to see that the land was inhabited ; and in two or
three places, as we sailed by, we saw people stand upon the shore to
look at us; we could also perceive they were quite black, and star-k
naked. I was once inclined to have gone on ashore to them, but
Xury was my better counsellor, and said to me, " No go, no go."
However, I hauled in nearer the shore, that. I might-talk to them,
and I found they ran along the shore by me a good way. I observed
they had no weapons in their hands, except one, who had a long,
slender stick, which Xury said was a lance, and that they would
throw them a great way with good aim ; so I kept at a distance, but
talked to them by signs, as \rcil as I could, and particularly made
signs for something to eat. They beckoned to me to clap my boat,
and they would fetch me some meat. Upon this I lowered the top
ofmy sail and lay by, and two of them run up into the country, and
in less than half an hour came back, and brought with them two
pieces of dry flesh and some rnrtt, such as the produce of their coun-
try, but we neither knew what the one or the other was: however,
we were willing to accept it. But how-to come at it was our next
dispute, for I was not for renturing on chore to them, and they new
as much of raid of us ; hut they took u. safe way for us all, for they
brought it to the shore and laid it dmrn, and went and stood a great,
way oll' till we fetched it on heard, and then came close to us again.
"'0 made signs of tlnmks to them, for we had nothing to make them
amends ; but an opportunity otl'ered that very instant to oblige them
wonderfully; for while we were iying hy the shore, came two mighty
creatures, one pursuing the other (as we took it) with great fury, from
the mountains toward the sea ; whether it was the male pursuing the
female, or whether they were in sport or in rage, we could not tell,
any more than we could tell whether it was usual or strange; but I
believe it was the latter, because, in the first place, those ravenous
creatures seldom appear but in the night, and in the second place, we
found the people terribly frightened, especially the women. The man
that had the lance, or dart, did not fly from them, but the rest did;
however, as the two creatures ran directly into the water, they did
not seem to offer to fidl upon any of the Negroes, hut plunged them--
selves into the sea, and swam about, as if they had come for their di'
rersion. At last, one of them begun to come nearer our boat than I at
first expected : but I lay ready for him, for I loaded my gun with all
possible expedition. and bade Xury lond both the others. As soon as
he came fairly within my reach, I fired, and shot him directly in the
head; immediately he sunk down into the water, but rose instantly,
and plunged up and down, as if he was struggling for life, and so indeed
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
  

he was. He immediately made to the shore ; but between the wound,
which was his mortal hurt, and the strangling of the water, he died
just before he reached the shore.

It is impossible to express the astonishment of these poor creatures,
at the noise and fire of my gun; some of them were even ready to die
for fear, and fell down as (lead with the very terror; but when they
saw the creature dead, and sunk in the water, and that I made signs to
them to come to the shore, they took heart: and came to the shore, and
began to search for the creature. I found him by his blood staining
the water; and by the help of a rope, which I slung round him and
gave the Negroes to haul, they dragged him on shore, and found that.
it was a most: curious leopard, spotted, and line to an admirable de-
gree _; and the Negroes held up their hands with admiration, to think
what it was I had killed him with.

The other creature, frightened with the flash of tire and the noise of
the gun, swam on shore, and ran up directly to the mountains from
whence they came; nor could I, at that distance, know what it. was.
V I found quickly the Negroes were for eating the flesh of this creature,
': 5 so I was willing to have them take it as a favor from me 3 which, when
I made signs to them that they might take him, they were very thunk-
ful for. Immediately they fell to work with him; and though they
had no knife, yet with a. sharpened piece of wood they took of? his skin
as readily, and much more readily, than we could have done with a.
knife. They offered me some of the flesh, which I declined, melting as
if I would give it them, but made signs for the skin, which they gare
me very freely, and brought me a great. deal more of their provisions,
which, though I did not understand,yetI accepted. I then made signs
to them for some water, and held out one of my jars to them, turning
it bottom upward, to show that it was empty and that I wanted to
' have it filled. They called immediately to some of their friends, and
_ there came two women and brought a great vessel made of earth, and
hurnt,as I suppose. in the sun ; this they set down to me, as before, and
' I sent Xury on shore with my jars, and filled them all three. The wo-
men were as stark naked as the men.

I was now furnished with roots and corn, such as it was, and water;
., and leaving my friendly Negroes, I made forward for about eleven days
more, without ofi'ering to go near the shore, till I saw the land run out
, a great length into the sea, at the distance of four or five leagues before

1, me ; and the sea. being very calm, I kept a large ofiing, to make this
point. At length, doubling the point, at about two leagues from the
land, I saw plainly land on the other side, to seaward; then I conclud-
2221. as it was most certain 122210.021, that this was the Cape do Yard, and

performance, to a tittle: for he ordered the seamen, that
f \y none should offer to touch anything 1 had: then he took
w everything into his own possession, and gave me back an
exact inventory of them, thatl might have them, even so much as
my three earthen jars.

As to my beat, it was a very good one ; and that he saw, and told
me he would buy it of me for the ship's use; and asked me what I
would have for it? I told him, he had been so generous to me in
everything, that I could not ofi'er to make any price of the boat, but
left it entirely to him: upon which, he told me he would give me A
note ofhand to pay me eighty pieces of eight for it at Brazil; and
i when it come there, if any one offered to give more, he would
make it up. Ile offered me also sixty pieces of eight more for my
boy any, which I was loath to take; not that I was not willing to
let the captain have him, but I was very loath to sell the poor boy's
liberty, who had assisted me so faithfully in procuring my own.
lIowevsr, when I let him know my reason, he owned it to he just,
and ofl'ered me this medium, that he would give the boy an oblige!
lion to set him free in ten years, if he turned Christian ; upon this,
and any saying he was willing to go with him, I let the captain
have him.

We had a very good voyage to the Brazils, and arrived in the Bay
de 'l'rodos los Santos, or All Snintn' Bay, in about twenty-two days
after. And now I was once more delivered from the trust. miserable
of all conditions of life; and what to do next with myself, I was new
to consider.

3 g S he was charitable in this proposal, so he was just in 'tho50 4mm: or

The generous treatment the captain gave me, I can never enough
rem-abet: he would take nothing of me for my passage, gave me
twenty ducats for the leopard's skin, and forty for the lion's skin,
which I had in my boat, and caused everything I had in the ship to
he punctually delivered to me; and what I was willing to sell, he
bought of me; such as the ease of bottles. two of my guns, and a
niece of the lump of beeswax--for I had made candles of the rest;
I: a word, I made about two hundred and twenty pieces of eight. of
all my cargo; and with this stock, I went on shore in the Brazils.

I had not been long here, before I was reeonnnemlcd to the house
ofa. good honest. man, like himself, who had an ingenio as they call
it (that is, a plantation and a sugar-house). I lived with him some
time, and acquainted myself, by that means, with the manner of
planting and of making sugar; and seeing how well the planters
lived: and how they get- rich snnlclenly,l resolved it I could get a
license to settle there, I would turn planter among them ; endeavor-
ing in the meantime, to find out some way to get. my money, which I
had left. in London, remitted to me. To this purpose, getting a kind
of letter of naturalization, I purchased as much land that was un-
cured as my money would reach, and formed a plan for my planta-
tion and settlement; such a one as might be suitable to the stock
which I proposed to myself to receive from England.

Iliad a neighbor, a Portuguese of Lisbon, but horn of English
parents, whose name was "'ells, and in much such circumstances as
l was. I call him my neighbor, because his plantation lay next to
mine, and we went on very sociably together. My stock was but
low, as well as his; and we rather planted for food than anything
else, for about two years. However, we began to increase, and our
land began to come in order; so that the third year we planted some
tobacco, and made each of us a. large piece of ground ready for
planting canes in the year to come; but- we both wanted help; and
now I found more than before, I had done wrong in parting with my
boy Xury.

But, alas! for me to do wrong, that never did right, was no great
wonder. I had no remedy, but to go on ; I had got. into an employ
ment quite remote to my genius, and directly contrary to the life I
delighted in. and for which I forsook my father's house, and broke
through all I. is good advice. Nay, I was coming into the very mid
ole station, 3.' upper degree of low life, which my father advised me
to before; and which, if I resolved to go on with, I might as well
have stayed at home, and never have fatigued myself in the world, a;n :y-A

I had done; and I often used to say to myself,I could hurt done this
as well in England, among my friends, as to have. gone the thousand
miles off to do it among st umgers and savages m u wildernessmtnl at
such a. distance as never to hear from any part of the world that had
the least knowledge of me.

In this manner I used to look upon my condition with the utmost
regret. I had nobody to converse with, but now and then this neigh-
bor ; no work to be done, but by the labor of my hnnds , and I used
to say, I lived just like a man cast away upon some desolate island,
that had nobody there but l'll'WElf. But how just. has it been! and
how should all men reflect, that when they compare their present
conditions with others that are worse, lIcurcn may Ollligt: them to
make the exchange, and be convinced of their former felicity by their
experience. I say, how just has it been, that the truly solitary life
I reflected on, in an island of more desolation, should be my lot. who
had so often unjustly compared it with the life which I then led, in
which: had I continued, I had, in all probability, heou exceedingly
prosperous and rich!

I was, in some degree, settled in my measures for carrying on the
plantation, before my kind friend, the captain of the ship that took
me up at son, went back; for the ship remained there, in providing
his hiding, and preparing for his voyage, nenr three months; when
telling him what little stock I had left. behind me in London, he gave
me this friendly and sincere advice: " Senhor Jingles," says he (for
so he always called me), " if you will give me letters, and :7. procure-
tion here in form to me, with orders to the person who has your
money in London, to send your efi'ects to Lisbon, to such persons as
Ishall direct, and in such goods as are proper for this eountry,I
will bring you the produce of them, God willing, at my return; but
since human ntl'nirs are all subject to changes and disaster: I would
have you give orders but for one hundred pounds sterling, which you
say is half your stock, and let the hazard be run for the fiP't, so that
if it come safe, you may order the rest the some way ; and, if it mis-
carry, you may have the other half to have recourse to for your sup-
ply." This was so wholesome advice, and looked so friendly, that
I could not but be convinced that it. was the best- course I could tnha;
so I accordingly prepared letters to the gent-lewoman with whom I
left my money, and u. procurution to the Portuguese captain, as he
desired me.

I wrote the English enptniu's widow it full account of all my ad-
ventures: my slavery escape, and how I had met with the l'ortu|52 wvmcm or

gut-:9 captain at sea, the humanity of his behavior: and what cumii

eeneilly described the middle station of life to be full of ; but other
things attended me, and I was still to be the wilful agent of all my
own miseries; and. particularly, to increase my fault, and double the
reflections upon myself, which in my future eort'owsl should have
leisure to make, all these miscarriages \verc procured by my apparent
obstinate adhering to my foolish inclination of wandering about, and
pursuing that inclination in contradictior t-. the clearest. vieus of
doing myself good in a fair and plain pursuit of these pros-tweets, and
those measures of life, which nature and Providence concurred to pre
sent me with, and to make my duty.

An I had once done thus in breaking away from my parents, so I
could not be content now. but. I must go and leave the happy view I
had of being a rich and thriving man in m_v new plantation, only to
pursue a rash and immodeva'm desire of rising faster than the nature
of the thing: admitted; and thus least myself down again into the
deepest gulf of human misery ihat ever man fell into, or perhaps
could be consistent with life. ani a. state of health in the world.

To come then, by just degrees to the particulars of thia part of my
story. You may suppose, that having nmv lir-ul almost. four years in
the Brazils, and beginning to llll'iYO and prosper very well upon my
plantation, I had not only learned thelanguagc. but had contracted an
m-rptaintance and friendship among my ii-llow-plantcrs, as well as

 

among the merchants of St Salvador, which was our pert ; and that,
in my discourses among tr-rn, I had frequently given them an account
of my two voyages to tl - :onst ol'Guinca, the manner of trading with
the negroes there, and E ow easy it. was to purchase on the coast for
tritles--such as heads, toys, knives, scissors, hatchets, hits of glass,
and the like-not only gold-dust, (Vininea grains, elephants' teeth, &c.,
hut negroes, for the service of the Brazils, in great. numbers.

The); listcnrd always very attentively to my discourses on these
lu-adx, but especially to that part which related to the buying negroes,
\\'i.l'.'ll was a trade at that- timc not only not far entered into: but, as
far a: it was. had been carried on by the usrz'cnlos, or permisiion of
the king of Spain and Portugal, and engrossed from the public; so
that few negroes were bought7 and. those excessively dear.

It happened, being in company \ i'Lh Some merchants and planters'
of my acquaintance, and talking of those things vary earnestly, three
at them came to me the next morning, and told me they had been
:-.:t'sing very much upon what I had discoursed with them of the lant.
"int and they came to make a secret proposal to me; and, after
on;:r.'n.r.g me to secrecy. they told me that they had a mind to fit out
I ship to go to Guinea; that they had all plantations its well as Land
were Ntraitened for nothing so much an servants; that it was a trade
that. could not be carried on, because they could not publicly sell the
negroos nlmn they came home, so they desired to make but one
voyage, to bring the negroes on shore privately, and divide them
among their own plantations; and, in a word, the question was
whether I would go their supercargo in the ship, to manage the trad-
ing part upon the coast of Guinea; and they oll'erL-d me that 1 should
have an equal share of the negroes, without providing any part of the
stock.

This was a fair proposal, it must he confessed, had it. been made to
any one that had not a settlement and plantation of his own to look
after, which was in a fair way of coming to be very considerable, and
with a good stock upon it. But l..~ me, that was thus entered and
extablished. and had nothing to do but go on as I begun for three or
four years more, and to have sent for the other hundred pounds from
England; and who, in that time and with that little addition, could
scarce have failed of being worth three or four thousand pounds
sterling, and that increasing too; for me to think of such a voyage

as the. must preposterous thing that ever man, in such circumstau
Les. could be guilty of.

But I, that was born to be my own destroyer, could no more resist
the oflhr, than I could restrain my first rambling designs, when my
father's good counsel was lost upon me. in a word, I told them I
would go with all my heart, if they would undertake to look after my
plantation in my absence, and would dispose of it to such as I should
direct if I miscarried. This they all engaged to do, and entered
into writings or covenants to do so; and I made a formal will. dis'
posing of my plantations and etl'oets in case of my death ; making the
captain of the ship that saved my life, as before, my universal heirI
but obliging hin. to dispose of my effects as I had directed in my
will zone halfofthe produce being to himself, and the other to be ship.
ped to England. In short, I took all possible caution to preserve my
afi'ects and to keep up my plantation; had I used half as much pro
deuce to have looked into my own interest, and have made a jndg
meat of what I ought to have done, and not to have done, I had cer-
tainly never gone away from so prosperous an undertaking, leaving
all YllO probable views of a thriving circumstance, and gone a voyage
to sea. nth-ruled with all its common hazards. to say not-hing of :h.
reasons I had to expect particular iiiisfi)rt\tnos to myself.

But I was hurried on, and obeyed blindly the dictates of my fan."
rather than my reason ; and, accordingly, the ship being fitted on;
and the cargo furnished, and all things done as by agreement by my
partners in the voyage, I went on board in an evil hour again, the
first of September, 1659, being; the same day eight years that I went
from my parents at I lull, in order to act the rebel to their authority
and the fool to my own interest.

Our ship was about one hundred and twenty was burden, carried
six guns and fourteen men, besides the master, his boy and myself ; we
had on board no large cargo of goods except of such toys as were fit
for our trade with the negroes, such an beads, bits of glass, shells, and
odd trifles, especially looking-glasses, knives, scissors, hatehets, and the
like.

The very same day I went on board we set sail, standing away to
the northward upon our mu) coast, with design to stretch over for
the African coast. When they came about ten or twelve degrees of
northern latitude, which, it seems, was the manner of their course in
those days, we had very good weather, only excessively hot all the
way upon our own coast, till we came to the height of Cape St. Au-
gustino: from whence, keeping further 011' at sea, we lost sight of
land, and steered an if we were bound for the isle Fernando de Nora
onhn, llOliilng our 'tua-t N. E. by N., and leaving those isles on the
east. In this course we passed the Line in about twelve days' time,
and were, by our last observation, in seven degrees twenty-two min~
ntes northern latitude, when s violent tornado, or hurricane, took as
quite out ofour knowledge: it began from the southeast, came about
to the northwest, and then settled it the northeast; from whence it
blew in such a terrible manner, that for twelve days together we
could do nothing but drive, and, scudding away before it, let it carry
us \x'lzithcrsoever late and the fury of the winds directed; and during
these twelve d:\_\'s,l need not say that I expected every day to be
swallowed up, nor, indeed, did any in the ship expect to save their lives.

In this distress. we had, besides the terror of the storm, one of our
men died of the ealeuture, and one man and a boy washed overboard.
About the twelfth day, the weather abatiug a little, the master made
an observation as well as he could, and found that ho was in about
eleven degrees north latitude, but that he was twenty-two degrees of
longitude difl'ercnco west from Cape St. Augustine ; so that he found
he was get upon the coast of Guiana, or the north part of Brazil, be-
y md the river Amazon, toward that of the river Oronoco, commonly
called the Great River; and began to consult with me what course he
should take. for the ship was leaky and very much disabled, and he
was for. r; ing directly back to the coast of BrazilI6 mmrrt rats or

I was positively against, that, and looking over the charts of the
rcncoastu of.\merica with him, we concluded there was no inhabited
country for us to have recourse to, till we came within the circle 0!
the Carrilme islands, and therefore resolved to stand :uva - for lint-ha>>
does; which, by keeping all to sea. to avoid the indrat't of the hay oi
gulf of Mexico, we might- easily perform, as we hoped, in about. fifteen
days' sail, whereas we could not possibly make our voyage to the
coast of Africa without. some assistance, both to our ship and our
selves.

With this derign, we changed our coarse, and steered away N. \V.
by \V. in order to reach some of our English islands, where I hoped for
relief: but our voyage was otherwise determined; for heing in the

 

latitude of twelve degrees, eighteen minutes, a second storm came
upon us', which carried us away with the same impetueaity westward,
and drove us so out of the very way of all human commerce, that
had all our lives been saved, M to the sea, we were rather in danger
of being devoured by savages than ever returning to our own coun-
try.

In this distress, the wind still blowing very hard, one efnlzr men,
early in the morning. cried out, " Land l" and we had no runner run
out ofthe eahin to look out, in hopes of seeing \vltcrealmuts in the
world we were, than the ship struck upon a sand, and in a moment,
her motion being so stopped, the s. 'a brake over her in such a man
nor, that we expected we should all have perished innnodiatcly; and
we were immediately driven into our close quarters, to shelter us from
the very foam and spray of the sea.

It is not. easy for any one who has not: been in the like condition to
describe or conceive the consternation of men in such circumstances
we knew nothing where we were, or upon what. land it. was we were
driven, whether an island or the main: whether inhabited or not in
habitcd , and as the rage of the wind was still great.: though rather
less than at. first, we could not so much as hope to have the ship held
many minutes without breaking in pieces, unless the wind, by a kind
of miracle, should immediately turn about. In a word, we sat. look-
ing upon one another, and expecting death every moment, and every
man acting accordingly, as preparing for another world; for there
was little or nothing more for us to do in this: that which was our
present comfort, and all the comfort: we had, was, that, contrary to
our expectation, the ship did not break yet, and that. the toaster said

fully high upon the shore, and might well be called den wild zce, as
the Dutch call the sea in a storm.

And now our case was very dismal, indeed ; for we all saw plainly
that the sea went so high, that>> the boat could not live, and that we
should he inevitably drowned. As to making sail, we had none; nor,
if we had, could we have done anything with it; so we worked at the
ear (mvard the .land, though with heavy hearts, like men going to
execution; for we all know that when the boat came nearer to the
shore. >he would be dashed in a thousand pieces by the breach of the
sea. However, we committed our souls to God in the most earnest
manner; and the wind driving us toward the shore, we hastened our

body, and had it returned again immediately, I must have been stran-
gled in the water; but I recovered a little before the return of the
waves, and seeing I should again be covered with the water, I re.
solved to hold fast by a piece of the rock, and so to hold my breath,
if possible, till the wave went back. Now, as the waves were not so
high as the first, being nearer land, I held my hold till the wave abs.
ted and then fetched another run, which brought me so near the
there that the next wave, though it went over me, yet did not so swal-
low me up as to carry me away, and the next run I took I got to the
main land, where, to my great comfort, I clamhered up the clifi's of
the shore and sat me down upon the grass, free from danger, and quite
out of the reach of the water.

I was now landed. and safe on shore, and began to look up and
thank God that my life was saved, in a case wherein there was, some
minutes before, scarcely any room to hope. I believe it is impossible
to express, to the life, what the ecstasies and transports of the soul
are, when it is so saved, as I may say, out of the grave; and I did
not now wonder at the custom, viz., that when n malefaetor, who has
the halter about his neck, is tied up, and just going to be turned 03',
and has a reprieve brought to him, I say I do not wonder that they
bring a surgeon with it, to let him blood that very moment they tell

him of it, that the surprise may not drive the animal spirits from the
heart and overwhelm him.

" For sudden joys, like griefn, confound at first."

I walked about on the shore, lifting up my hands, and my whole
being, as I may say, wrapped up in the contemplation of my deliver-
ance, making a thousand gestures and motions which I cannot de-
scribe; reflecting upon my comrades that were drowned, and that
there should not be one soul saved but myself--for, as for them, I
never saw them afterward, or any sign of them, except three of their
hats, one cap, and two shoes that were not fellows.

I cast my eyes to the stranded vessel, when the breach and froth
o? the sen being so big I could hardly see it, it lay so for ofi', and con
siaiered--Lord! how was it possible I could get on shore!

After I had solaced my mind with the comfortable part of my con.
dition, I began to look around me to see what kind of a place I was
in, and what was next to be done, and I soon found my comforts
abate, and that, in a word, I had a dreadful deliverance; for I was
wet, had no clothes to shift me, nor anything either to eat or drink
to comfort me; neither did I see any prospect before me but that o!60 Am'munls or

perishing with hunger or being devoured by wild beasts; and that
which was particularly afflicting to me was, that I had no weapon
either to hunt and kill any creature for my sustenance, or to defend
myself against any other creature that might desire to kill me for
theirs. In a word, I had nothing about me but a. knife, a tobacco
pipe, and a little tobacco in a box. This was all my provision ; and
this threw me into such terrible agonies of mind, that, for a while, 1
tin about like a madman. Night coming upon me, I began, with a
heavy heart, to consider what would be my lot if there were any :aren
one beasts in that country, seeing at night they always come abroad
for their prey.

All the remedy that offered to my thoughts, at that time, was to get
up into a thick, bushy tree, like a lir, but thorny, which grew near
me, and where I resolved to sit all night, and consider the next day
what death I should die, for as yet I saw no prospect of life. 1
walxed about a. fnrlnng from the shore to see ifI could find any fresh
water to drink, which I did to my great joy; and having drank, and
put a little tobacco into my mouth to prevent hunger, I went to the
tree, and getting up into it, endeavored to place myself so that if 1
should fall asleep I might not fall' and having cut me a. short stick,
like u. truncheon, for my defence, I took up my lodging; and, having
been excessively fatigued, I fell fast. asleep, and slept as comfort-ably
as I believe few could have done in my condition, and found myself

the most refreshed with it that I think I ever was on Such an oecw
siou.

ship was lifted of in the night from the sand Wile" elle
lay. by the swelling of the tide. and was driven almost as far as the
rock which I at first mentioned, where I had been so bruised by the
wave dashing me against it. This beingJ within about a mile from

the shore where I was, and the ship seeming to stand upright ~zili. l

wished myself on board, that at least I might save some nemmry
things for my use.
When I came down from my apartment in the tree I looked about
me again, and the first thing I found was the heat, which lay, as the
wind and sea had tossed her up upon the land. about two miles on my
right- hand. I walked as far as I could upon the shore to have got to
her, but foundaneck or inlet of water between me and the boat, which
was about half a mile broad, so I came back for the present, being
more intent upon getting at the ship, where I hoped to find something
for to; present subsistence.

A little after noon I found the sen very calm. and the tide ebbell so
far out, that I could come within a quarter of a mile of the ship ; and
here I found a fresh renewing of my grief, for I saw, evidently, that
if we had kept on board we had been all safe; that is to any, we had
all got safe on shore, andI had not been so miserable M to he left
entirely destitute of all comfort and company, as I now was. This
forced tears from my eyes again, but as there was little relief in this,
I resolved, if possible, to get to the ship; so I pulled ofi my clothes,
for the weather was hot to extremity, and took the water ; but when
I came to the ship, my diliiuulty was still greater to know how to get
on board, for as she lay aground, and high out of the water, there was
nothing within my reach to lay hold of. I swam round her twice,
and the second time I spied a small piece of rope, which I wondered
I did not see at first, hang down by the forechains, so low as that with
great difficulty I got hold of it, and by the help of that rope got into
the forecastle of the ship. Here 1 found the ship was bulged, and had
a great deal cf water in her hold, but that she lay so on the side of a
bank of hard sand, or rather earth, that her stern lay lifted up upon
the bank, and her head low, almost to the water ; by this means all
her quarter was free, and all that was in that part was dry ; for, you
may he sure, my first work was to search. and to see what was spoiled
and what was free; and first, I found that all the ship's provisions
were dry and untouched by the water, and being very well disposed
to eat, I went to the bread-room and filled my pockets with biscuit,
and ate it as I went shout. other things, for I had no time to lose. I
also {bend some rum in the great cabin: of which I took a large dram,
and which I had indeed need enough of, to spirit me for what was be
fore me. Now I wanted nothing but a boat to furnish myself with
many things which I foresaw would be very necessary to me.

It was in vain to sit still and wish for what was not to be had, and
this extremity roused my application ; we had several spare yards,
and two or three large spars of wood, and a spare topmost or two in
the ship; I resolved to fall to work with these, and flung as many62 Aavaxrnzst; or

overboard as I could manage for their weight, tying every one with a
rope, that they might not drive away. When this was done, I went
down to the ship's side, and pulling them to me, I tied four of them
fast together at both ends, as well as I could. in the form of a. raft,
and lajing two or three short pieces of plank upon them, crosswise, I
found 1 could talk upon it. very well, but that it was not able to bear
any great weight. the pieces being, too light; so I went to work, and
with the -'n!'[wxitt'i"r' saw I cut a spare topmast into three lengths,
and added them u- my raft, with a great deal .'f labor and pains. 13!.
the hope of. Furnishing; myself with necessaries encouraged. me to go
beyond what- ! should have been able to do an another occasion.

My raft was now strong enough to bear any reasonable weight.
My next. care was what to load it with. and .".ow to preserve what I
laid upon it from the surf of the sea; but I. was not long considering
this. I first laid all the planks or boards upon it that. Iconld get,
and having considered well what I most. wanted, I got. three of the
seamou's chests, which I hal broken open and emptied, and lowered
them down upon my raft; these I filled with provisions, viz.: bread,
rice, three Dutch cheeses, five pieces of dried goat's flesh (which we
lived much upon), and a little remainder of European corn, which
had been laid by for some fowls which we had brought to sea. with
us, but the fowls were killed. There had been some barley and
"heat together, but, to my great disappointment, I found afterward
that the rats had eaten or spoiled it all. As for liquors, I found sev-
eral cases of bottles belonging to our skipper. in which were some
cordial waters; and, in all, about five or six gallons of rack. These
.i stowed by then-selves, them being in need to put. them into the
cheats, nor any room for them. While I was doing this, I found the
tide began to (low: though very calm; and I had the mortification to
see my coat, shirt. and waistcoat, which I had left on shore, upon the
send, swim away; as for my brooches, which were only linen, and
open-knead, I 3" am on board in them and my stockings. However,
this put me upon rummaging for clothes, of which I found enough,
but took no more than I wanted for present use, for I had other things
which my eye was more upon: as, first, tools to work with on shore:
and it was after long searching that] found the carpenter's chest,
which was indeed a very useful prize to me, and much more valuable
than a ship-hiding of gold would have been at that time. I got it
down to my mft, even whole as it was, without losing time to look
into it, for I know, in general, what it contained.

My next care was for some ammunition and arms. There were two

- "rovm'hwxafih... _ .
very good {curling-pieces in the great cabin, and two pistols; these I
secured first, with some ponder-horns and a small bag of shot, and
two old rusty swords. I knew there were three barrels of powder in
the ship, but knew not where our gunner had stowed them; but- with
much search I found them, two of them dry and good, the third had
of: 311 water. Those two I got to my raft, with the arms. And now
I thought myself pretty well freighted, and began to think howl
should get to shore with them, having neither sail, oar, nor rudder;
and the least onpful of wind would have overset all my navigation.

I had three cueourngomenta: lot, A smooth calm sea; 2dly, The
tide rising and setting in to the shore; 3dly, What little wind there
was blew me. toward the loud. And thus, having found two or three
broken oars belonging to the boat, and besides the tools which were
in the chest, I found two saws, an axe, and n. hammer; and with this
enrgol put to sea. For a. mile, or thereahouts. my raft went very
Well, only that I found it drive a little distant from the place where
I had landed before; by which I perceived that there was some in-
draft of the water, and consequently I hoped to find some creek or
river there, which I might make use of us a port to get to land with
my cargo.

As I imagined Bu it was; there appeared before me it little opening
of the lnnd, and I found at strong current of the tide set into it; so I
guided my raft, as well as I could, to get into the middle of the stream.
But here I had like to have euli'ered n second shipwreck, which, if I
hall, I think it verilyr would have broken my heart; for, knowing
nothing of the coast, my raft ran aground at one end of it upon a.
shoal, and not being uground ut- the other end, it wanted but a little
that all my cargo had slipped 01? toward that end that was afloat,
and so fallen into the water. I did my utmost by setting my back
against the chests, to keep them in their places, but could not thrust
oil" the raft with all my strength; neither (lnrst I stir from the pos-
ture I was in, but holding up the chests with all my might, I stood in
that manner near half an hour, in which time the rising of the water
l:ronght me a little more upon a level ; and a little after, the water
still -ising_, my raft floated again, and I thrust her off, with the car I
had. into the channel, and then driving up higher, I at length found
myself in the mouth of a. little river, with land on both sides, and a
strong current or tide running up. I looked on both sides for a proper
place to get to shore, for I was not willing to be driven too high up
the-river; hoping, in time, to see some ship at sea, and therefore :9
aolved to place myself at near the coast as I could
At. length I spied a little core on the right shore of the creek, k
which, with great pain and diflieulty,l guided my raft, and at last
got so near, as that reaching ground with my oar, I could thrust. he)
directly in : but here I had like to have dipped all my cargo into the
8011 again; for that shore lying pretty steep, that is to say, sloping,
there was no place to land but where one end of my float, if it ran on
shore, would lie "0 high, and the other sink lower, as before, that it
would endanger my cargo again. All that I could do was to wait till
the tide was at the highest, keeping the raft with my oar like an an-
chor to hold the side of it fast to the shore, near a lint piece of ground
which I expected the water would flow over; and so it did. As soon
as I found water enough, for my ral't drew ahout a foot. of water, I
"must her upon that flat. piece of ground, and there fastened or moored
her, by : i. in; my two broken oars into the ground, one on one side,
near m 31.1, and one on the other side, near the other end: and thus
Ilny till the water nlbed away, and left my raft and all my cargo
safe en shore.

 

 

 

My next work was to View the country, and seek a proper place for
my habitation, and where to stow my goods, to secure them from
whatever might happen. \Vhero I was I yet know not--whether on
the. continent, 1:- on an island--whether inhabited, or not inhabited--
whethcr in danger ofwild beasts, 'rr not. There was a hill, not above
a mile from me, which rose up very steep and high, and which seemed
to overtop some other hills. which lay as in a ridge from it, north-
ward. Itonk out one of the tbwling-pieces and one ofthe pistols.
and a horn of powder, and, thus armed, I travelled for discovery up to
the top of that hill: where, after I had, with great labor and difficulty,
got up to the top. I saw my fate, to my great affliction, viz.: that I
was on an island, envirnned every way with the sea, no land to be
seen, except. some roclls. whh;h luv :1. great way off, and two small is.
lands, less than this, which lay-about. three leagues to the west.

1 found also that. the island I was in was barren, and, as I saw good
reason to believe. uninhabited, except by wild beasts, of whom, how-
eve '. I saw none; yet I saw abundance of fowls, but knew not their
kit. in: neither, when I killed them, could I tell what was lit for food,
and what not. At my coming back, I shot at a great bird, which I
saw sitting upon a tree, on the side ofa great wood. I helim'e it was
the first gun that had been fired there since the creation of the world.
I had no sooner fired, but from all parts of the wood there arose an
innumerable number of fowls, of many sorts, making a. confuseu
screaming, and crying, every one according to his usual note but not
one of them of any kind that I know. As for the creature I killed, .1
took it to Le a kind of a hawk, its color and beak resembling it, but it
had no talons or claws more than eonnnon. Its flesh was earl-ion: and
{it for nothing.

Contented with this discovery, I camehaelc to my raft, and fell to
work to bring my cargo on shore. vhich took meup the rest of the
:lay ; what to do with myself at night l knew not; nor indeed where to
rest, for I was afraid to lie down on the ground, not knowing but sonic
wild beast- might devour me --- though. as ] afterward found, there
was really no need for those fear... However7 in! well as I could, I
barricadoed myself round with chest. and ho: rds that I had brought
on shore, and made a kind of but fer that night's lodging. Asl'or
fund: I yet saw not which way to supply myself, except that I had
seen two or three creatures, like hares, rm. out of the wood there I
shot the fowl.

I new hogan to consider that I might yet get a great many things
out of the side which would he useful to me, and particularly some
of the rigging and sails, and such other things as might come to land,
and I resolve-.1 to make another voyage on heard the vessel, if pus-Si
ble. And as I knew that the first storm that blew must neceSSarily
break her all in pieces, I resolved to set all other things apart, till I
got everything out of the ship that I could get. Then I called a
council, that is to say, in my thoughts, whether I should take back
the raft. but. this appeared impracticable, so I resolved to go as be-
fore, when the tide was down ; and I did so, only that l stripped be
fore I went into my hat, having nothing on hut a chequered shirt; a
pair of linen drawers, and a pair of pumps on my feet.

I got on board the ship as before, and prefer-ed a second raft; and
having had cxl'nerienee of the first, I neither made this J0 unwieldy,
nor loaded it so hard, but yet I Lrought away several things very use-
'1'}. to inc--as, first, in the earl enter-ls. stores, I f-iunvi twu or three hugs
r! :I'Alli and spikes, a great screw-jack, a dozen or two of hatehnts,
and. al-t-ve all, that most useful thing called a grindstnue. All these
'2 secured together with several things belonging to the gunner, par-
iionlariy two or three iron crews, and two barrel; of musket bullets,
tvren nn.~.kets, and another fiivi'liuig-},ziece, v'itii some small quantity 0!
rmrdor more, a large bag full of small shot, and a great roll ofsheeh
lead: [an this last was so heavy, I could not hoist it up to get it over
the shin's side. Besides these things, I took all the men's clothes that
l cm'd t'-n-l. and a spare hire-topsail, a hammock, and some bedding,
and with this I loaded my eccend raft, and brought them all safe on
shore, to my very great comfort.66 .u'w ism-cans or

I was under some apprehensions lest, during my absence from the
land, my provisions might be devoured on shore ; but when I came
back, I found no sign of any visitor, only there sat a creature like a
wild cat upon one of the c"ests, which, when I came toward it, ran
away a little distance, and then stood still. She sat very composed
and unconcerned, and looked full in my face, as if she had a mind to
be acquainted with me. I presented my gun to her, but, as she did
not understand it, she was perfectly unconcerned at it, nor did she
ofi'cr to em may, upon which I tossed her a hit of biscuit, though, by
the way, I was not very free of it, for my store was not great; how
ever, I spared her a hit, I say, and she went to it, smelled of it, and
ate it, and looked (as pleased) for more; but I thanked hor,and could
spare no more, so she marched )fi'

Having got my second carg- on shore--though I was thin to open
the barrels of powder, and bring them by parcels, for they were too
heavy, being large casks--I went to work to make me a little tent,
with the sail, and some poles, which I cut for that purpose, and into
this tent I brought everything that I knew would spoil either with
rain or sun ; and I piled all the empty chests and casks up in a circle
round the tent, to fortify it from any sudden attempt either from man
or beast.

When I had done this, I blocked up the door of the tent with some
boards within, and an empty chest set up on end without, and, spread-
ing one of the beds upon the ground, laying my two pistolsjust at
my head, and my gun at length by me,I went- to bed for the first
time, and slept very quietly all night, for I was very weary and
heavy: for the night hefure I had slept little, and had labored very
hard all day, as well to fetch all those things from the ship as to get
them on shore,

I had the biggest magazine ot'all kinds now that ever was laid up,
I believe, for one man : butI was not. satisfied still, for while the ship
sat upright in that posture, I thought I ought to get everything out
of her that I could--so every day, at low water, I went on board, and
brought away something: or other; but particularly the third time I
went, I brought away as much of the rigging as I could, as also all
the small ropes and rope-twine I could get, with a. piece of spare
canvas, which was to mend the sails upon occasion, and the barrel 0!
wet gunpowder. In a word, I brought away all the sails first unit
last, only that I was fain to cut them in pieces, and bring as much at
a time as I could, for they were no more useful to be sails, but u
more canvas only
But that which comforted me still more was, that, last of all, after
I had made five or six such voyages as these, and though I had noth
ing more to expect from the ship that was worth my meddling with,
I say, after all this, I found a great hogshead of bread, and three
large runlets of rum or spirits, and a box of sugar, and a barrel of fine
flour; this was surprising to me, because I had given over expecting
any more provisions, except what was spoiled by the water. I soon
emptied the hogshcad of that bread, and wrapped it up, parcel by
parcel, in pieces of the sails, which I cut out--and, in a word, I got
all this safe on shore also.

The next. day I made another voyage, and now having plundered
the ship of what was portable and fit to hand out, I began with the
cables, and cutting the great cable into pieces such as I could move,
I got two cables and a hawsnu on shore, with all the iron work I
could get, and having cut down the spritsail-yard, and the mizen-
yard, and everything I could, to make '5 large raft, I loaded it with

1 all those heavy goods and came away: but my good luck began now
5 to leave me, for this raft was so unwieldy, and so orerladen, that after
' Iwas entered the little cove, where I had landed the rest of my
goods, not being able to guide it so handily as I did the other, it
orcrset, and threw me and all my cargo into the water; as for my-
self, it was no great harm, for I was near the shore; but- as to my
cargo, it was a great part of it lost, especially the iron, which I ex-
pected would have been (f great use to me ; however, when the tide
was out, I got- most of the pieces of cable ashore, and some of the
iron, though with infinite labor, for I was fain to dip for it into tho
water, a. work which fatigued me very much. After this I went
every day on board, and brought away what I could get.

I had now been thirteen days ashore, and. had been eleven times on
board the ship; in which time I had brought away all that one pair
of hands could well be supposed capable to bring; though I verily
believe, had the calm weather held, I should have brought away the
whole ship, piece by pause, but preparing the twelfth time, to go on
' hearth] found the wind began to use. However, at low watcr,I
went :1. board; and though I thought I had rummaged the cabin so
effectually as that. nothing could be found, yet I discovered a locker
.rith drawers in it, in one of which I found two or three razors, and
one pair of large scissors, with some ten or a ("son of good knives
' and forks; in another I found about thirty-six pounds in money,

, some European coin, some Brazil, some pieces of eight, some gold.
and some silver.
I smiled to myself at the sight- of this money. " 0 drug I" I e)

a piece of canvas. I hegan to think of making another 111t't _: but while
I was preparing this, I found the sky overcast, and the wind began
to rise, and in aquarter of an hour it blew a fresh gale from the
shore. It presently occurred tn me, that it was in vain to pretend to
make a. raft with the wind off shore; and that. it. was my hasinoss to
be gone before the tide or flood hogan. or otherwise I might not. he
able to reach the >hm-e at all. Accordingly ] let. myself down into
the water, and swam across the channel which lay between the ship
and the sands, and even that witn (iiilieulty enough, partly with th'e
weifvht of the things I had about me, and partly the rouu-hness of the

hut 1 was gut home to my little tent>>, where I lay, with all my
wealth almut me very secure. It. lnlew very hard all that night,
and in the morning, when I looked out, beheld no more ship \'as to
be seen! I was a little snrprised,hnt- recovered myself with this
smis'actnry relhirtiun. \' that I had lost no time, or abated no
diligence. to get czerytl'ing out of her, that. would be useful to me,
1-.nd that, indeed, there was little left: in 181' that l was able to bring
away, if 1 had more time.

I now gave over an\_' more thoughts nfthe ship. or of a.
ofher, ewepl'. "h: it might driie on shore from her "ice It; .
direm pieces of her nftcruard did; but thise things were of small
use to me.

My thoughts were now wholly employed ahout securing mysdl
against either savages, if any should appear, or wild hcasts. il' anv
were in the island; ..nd I had many thoughts of the nu-thod how I"
do this, and what. kind of dwelling to malec-t whether I should make
:1 care in the earth. or a tent upon the earth _. and, in sh rl.l resolved
on huth: the manner and deserip'cn of which, it may not he in;-
proper to give an account of.

[ snuu found the placel was in was not for my settlement, par
tieularly hoeause it. was upon a. low, moorish ground, near the sea.
and] heliered it would nut 'se wholesome; and more particularly
because there was no fresh mater near it: so I resolved to find
more healthy and more convenient Spot of ground.

 

 

 

 

'hiuf out
is nulcml'
I consulted several things In my situation, which I found would be
porter for me: first, air and fresh water, 1 just now mentioned-
secondly, shelter from the heat of the sun; thirdly, security from
hummus creatures, whether men or bcnsto; fourthly, :x \'l0\\' to the
ma, that. if God sent any ship in sight, I might. not. lose any ad-
vantnge for my deliverance, of which I was not, willing to banish all
my expectation yet.

in search of n place proper for this, I found a little plain on the
side of a rising hill, whose front toward this little plain was as steep
on a ln.:se-rillo, so that nothing could come down upon me from the top.
On the .xidc of this rock, there was a hollow place, worn a little way
in, like the entrance or door of a care; but there ms not. really any
care, or way into the rook at all.

On the dot of the green. just before this hollow place I resolved to
pitch my tent. This plain was not.- nbore a. hundred yards broad,
and about mine as long. and l:|_\-' like :1 green before my door: nnd,
M the find of it, descended irregularly every way down into the low
ground by the sea-side. It. was on the N. N. \V. side of the hill; so
that it was sheltered from the heat. every day; till it- caxne to a \V.
and by S. sun, or thereabouts, which, in those countries, is near the
selling. '

Before I sot up my lent,I drew a ll".lt'-circle l-cl'ore the hollow
place, which took in about ten yards in its scmi-di:nnetcr from the
rock, and. twenty yards in its diameter, from its beginning and
ending.

In this half-circle I pitched two rows of strong stakes, driving
thmn into the ground till they stood very firm like piles, the biggest
end being out of the ground, about live feet and :1 half; and sharpened
on the top. The two rows did not stand above six inches from one
another.

Then I took the pieces of cable which I out in the ship, and laid
them in rows, one upon another, within the circle, between these two
rows of stakes. up to the top, placing other snakes in the inside, lean
Eng against them, about: two feel: and a hall' high, like a. spur to a
port; and this fence was no strong that- neither man nor beast could
get into it. or over it. This cost me a. great deal of time and labor,
especially to cut- the piles in the woods, bring them to the place, and
drive them into the earth.

The. entrance into this place I made to be not by a door but by a
short ladder to go over the top; which ladder, when I was in, I lifted
thought, from all the world, and consequently slept secure in the
night, which otherwise I could not have done : though, as it appeared
afterward, there was no need of till this caution against the enemies
that I apprehended danger from.

tude--Ccnzoiatery Reflections.

NTO this fence, or fortress, with infinite labor, I carried all
my riches, nil my p10\i.~ions, nnanunition, and stores of
which you have the account above; and I made a large tent,
which, to preserve me from the ruins, that in one part of the
year are very Violent there, 1 mode double, via, one smaller tent.
within, and one larger tent above it, and covered the uppermost with
a large tarpaulin, which l had saved among the sails.

And now I lay no more for a while. in the bed which I had brought
on shore, hut in a hammock, which was indeed a. very good one, and
belonged to the note of the ship.

Into this tent I lu'uught all my prm'isions and everything thatwould
spoil hy the wet, and having thus enclosed all my goods I made up
the entrance, which till now I had left open, and so passed and re-
passed, as I said, by a short ladder.

When I had done this, I began to work my way into the rock, and
bringing all the earth and stones thatl dug down out through my
tent, I laid them up within my fence in the nature of a terrace, so
that it raised the ground within about afoot and a half, and LhusI
made me a. cave just behind my tent, which served me like a collar to
my house. It cost me much labor and many days before all these
things were brought to perfection, and therefin'e I must go back to
some other things which took up some of my thoughts. At the same
time it happened, after I haul laid my scheme for the setting up my
tent, and making the care, that a storm of rain falling from a thick,
dark cloud, a sudden flash of lightning happened, and after that 3
great clap of thunder, as is naturally the effect of it. I was not m
much surprised with the lightning as I was with a thought, which
darted into my mind as swifl as the lightning itself--0, my powder!
My very heart sank within me when I thought that, at one blast, all
my powder might be destroyed! On which, not my defence only, but
the providing me food, as I thought, entirely depended. I was nothing
near so anxious about my own danger, though, had the powder taken
tire, I should never have known what had hurt me.

Such impression did this make upon me, that after the storm was
over I laid aside all my works, my building and fortifying, and ap-
plied myself to make bags and boxes, to separate the powder, and to
keep it a little and a little in aparcel, in hope that whatever might
come it might not all take fire at once, and to keep it so apart that it
should not be possible to make one part fire anothcr. I finished this
work in about a fort-night, and I think my powder, which in all was
about two hundred and forty pounds weight,was divided into not less
than a hundred parcels. As to the barrel that had been wet, I did
not apprehend any danger from that, so I placed it in my new cave,
which in my fancyl called my kitchen, and the restI hid up and
down in holes among the rocks, so that no wet might come to it,
marking very carefully where I laid it.

In the interval of time while this was doing, I went out at least
once every day with my gun, as well to divert myself as to see if I
could kill anything fit for food, and as near as I could, to acquaint
myself with what the island produced. The first time I went out, I
presently discovered that there were goats upon the island, which
wasn great satisfaction to me; but then it was attended with this
Ellsfill'tllno to me, viz., that they were so shy, so subtle, and so swift
of foot, that it was the most difiicult thing in the world to come at
them; but I was not discouraged at this, not doubting but I might
now and then shoot one, as it soon happened, for after I had found
: their haunts a. little, I laid wait in this manner for them 2 I observed,
if they saw me in the valleys, though they were upon the rocks they
would run away as in a terrible fright ; but if they were feeding in
the valleys, and I was upon the rocks, they took no notice of me, from
whence 1 concluded that, by the position of their optics, their sight
was so directed downward that they did not readily see objects that
were above them, so afterward I took this method--I always climbed
the rocks first, to get above them, and then had frequently a fair
.marh. The first shot I made among these creatures I killed a she
goat, which had a little kid by her, which she gave suck to, which
grieved me heartily; but when the old one fell the kid stood stock
' till by her till I came and took her up 3 and not only so, but when I
carried the old one with me, upon my shoulders, the kid followed me

uitc to my enclosure ; upon which I laid down the dam and took the
' ' in my arms and carried it over my pale, in hopes to have bred it
up tame, but it would not out, so I was forced to kill it and out it my-

Having now fixed my habitation. I found in absolutely necessary to
provide a place to make a. fire in, and fuel to burn ; and what] did
for that, as also how I enlarged :.y cave and what conveniences I
made, I shall give a. full account of in its proper place, but I must
first give some linle account of myself, and of my thoughts about. liv-
ing, which it may well be supposed were not few.

I had a dis ial prospect of my condition, for as I was not cost away

rhould I have done without a gun, without ammunition, without any
tools to make anything, or to work with, without clothes, bedding, a

sufficient quantity, and was in a fair way to provide myself in such a
manner as to live without my gun when my ammunition was spent, so
that I had a tolerable View of subsisting, without any want, as long as
I lived; for] censidcred, from the beginning, how I would provide

Upon the whole, here was an unbounded testimony. that there WI!
ecarce any condition in the world so miserable, but there was seine.
thing negative, or something positive, to be thankful for in it; and
let this sta as a direction, from the experience of the most miserable
of all conditions in this world, that we may always find in it something
to comfort ourselves from, and to set, in the description of good and
evil, on the credit side of the account.

Having now brought my mind a little to relish my coalition, and
given over looking out to sea, to see ifl could Spy a ship; I any given
over these things, I began to apply myself to accommodate my way
of living, and to make things as easy to me as I could.

I have already described my habitation, which was a tent under the
ends: of a rook, surrounded with a strong pale of posts and cable-s;
but I might now rather call ita wall, for I raised a kind of wall against
it of turl's, about two feet thick on the outside; and after some time
(I think it was a year and a half) I raised rafters from it, leaning to
the rock, and thatched or eon-red it with booghs of trees, and so-rlt
things as 1 could get, to keep out the rain; which I found, at some
times of the year, very violent.

I havu already observed how I brought all my goudsiuto l.l.is pale,
and into the cave which I had made behind me. lint l must observe,
too, that at. first this was a confused heap of goods, which, as they lay
in no order, so they took up all my place; I had no romn to turn my-
self; so I se.-myse1f to enlarge my cave and work further into the
earth For it was a loose sandy rock which yielded easily to the labor
I bestowed on it; and when I found I was pretty safe as to the beasts

  

of prey, I worked sidewise, to the right hand, into the rock, and tlien'

turning to the right again, wevked quite out. and made me a door to
come out in the outside of my pale or tiir.-ilie:..ion.

This gave me not only egress and regress, as it were, a hack way
to my tent, and to my s'orehome, but gave me room to stow my
goods.

And now I began to up;.ly myself to make such necessary things
In I found I most wanted, particularly a chair and a table, for with.
out these I was not. able to enjoy the few comforts I had in the world;
I could not write, or cat, 0': do several things with so much pleasure,
without a table, so I went to work. And here I must needs observe,
that as reason is the substance and original of the mathematics, so by
stating and squaring everything by reason, and by making the most
rational judgment of things, every man may be, in time, master of
every mechanic art. I had never handled a tool in my life ; and yet

atnostxsos 0813503. 77

in time, by labor, application, and contriranoe, I found at last that I
wanted nothing but I could have made, especially if I had had tools.
However, I made abundance of things, even without tools: and some
with no more to"s than an adze and a hatchet, which perhaps were
never made that way before, and that with infinite labor. For ex-
ample, if I wanted a board, I had no other way but to cut down a
tree, set it on an edge before me, and hew it flat on either side with
my use, till I had brought it to be as thin as a plank, and then dub it
smooth with my adxo. It is true, by this method I could make but
one board of a. whole tree, but this I had no remedy for but patience,
any more than I had for a prodigious deal of time and labor which it
took me up to make a plank or board; but my time or labor was
little worth, and so it was as well employed one way as another.

However, I made me a table and a chair, as I observed above, in
the firstplaee. and this I did out of the short pieces of boards that I
brought- In. my raft from the ship. But when Iwrought out some
noards. as above, I made large shelves, of the breadth of a foot and a
half, one over another, all alohar one side of my cave, to lay all my
tools, nails, and iron work on--and, in a word, to separate everything
at large in their glnces, thutI might easily came at them. I knocked
pieces into the wall of the rock to hang my guns, and all things that
would hang up, so that had my cave been seen, it looked like a gen-
eral magazine of all necessary things ; and I had everything so ready
at my hand, that it was a great pleasure to me to see all my goods in
such order, and especially to find my stock of all necessaries so
great.

And new it was thatI began to keep a. journal of every day's em
ployment; for, indeed, at first, I was in too much hurry, and not only
as to labor, but in much discomposuro of mind--and my journal
would, too, have been full of many dull things; for example, I must
have said thus--" Sept. 30th. After I had got to shore, and had es
caped drowning, instead of being thankful to God for my deliverance,
having first vomited, with a. great quantity of salt water which was
gotten into my stomach, and recovering myself a little, I ran about
the shore, wringing my hands, and beating my head and face, exclaim-
ing at my misery, and crying out I was undone--undcne! till, tired and
faint, l was forced to lie down on the ground to repose, but durst not
sleep, for fear of being devoured."

Some days after this, and after I had been on board the ship, and
got all that I could out of her, I could not forbesr getting up to the
top of a little mountain, and looking out to sea, in hopes of seeing I
Ihip: then fancy that, at a vast distance, I spied a sail, please myself
with the hnpes nt'it, and, after looking steadily. till I was alums:
blind. lose it quite, and sit down and weep like a. child, and thus in
crease my mim'r)' hy my fully.

But, hating gum-n ever these things in some. measure. and having
settled my hnuwhnld stull' and habitation, made me a table and a
chair, and all as handsmne stuil' abuut Inc as I could, I began to keep
my jnurnal, ml" which I shall here give you the copy (thuugh in it will
he tuhl all these. particulars over again) an long as it lasted; for hav-
ing no mum ink, l was forced to leave it ofl'.

All the Nat of tit-1'. day l spent. in afilicting myscll'nt the dismal
circumstances I was hmught to, \'iz.: I had neither fund, house,
clnthes, weapon, nnr place to fly to; and, in despair of any relief,

October 1. la the morning I saw, to my great surprise, the ship had
fimrted with the high tide, and was driven on shore again much
nearer the ialaml; which, as it was sumo cutnfort on one hand for
seeing her sit upright. and nut. hrnken in pieces, I hoped, if the "ind

of her fur my relief), so, on the other hand, it renewed my grief at
the [UKK' nt' my emm'mlns, who, l inmgined' if we had all stayed on

have been all drowned, as they were; and that, had the men been
saved. we might- perhaps have built us a boat, out of the ruins of theROBINSON CBUSOE. 79

ship, to have carried us to some other part of the world. I spent
great part of this day in perplexing myself on these things; but, at
lex.gth, seeing the ship almost dry, I went upon the send as near as I
could, and then swam on board. This day also it continued raining,
though with no wind at all.

From the lsl of October (u llxc 2411;. All these days entirely spent
in many several voyages to get. all I could out of the ship, which I
brought on shore every tide of flood, upon rafts. Much ruin also in
them: dag-s, though with some intervals of fair weather, but it seems
this was the rainy season.

()1:I. 2t). 1 over-set my raft, and all the goods I had got upon it ; but
being in shoal water, and the things being chiefly heavy, I recovered
many of them when the tide was out.

011. '25. it. rained all night and all day, with some gusts of wind,
during which time the ship broke in pieces (the wind blowing a little
harder than before) and was no more to be seen, except the wreck of
her, and that only at low water. I spent this day in covering; and se-
curing the goods which I haul saved, that the rain might not spoil
them.

0:1. 26. I walked about the shore almost all day, to find out aplaee
to lix my hahimtion, greatly ceneerned to secure myself from any
attack in the ni'rhl,(~.ither from wild beasts or men. Toward nightI
fixed upon a proper place, under a rock, and marked out a semicircle
for my encampment, which I resolved to strengthen with a work,
well, or liirtiljeatioa, made of double piles lined within with cables.
and without. with turf.

From the 26th to the 30th, I worked very hard in carrying all my
gondx' to my new habitation, though some part of the time it rained
exceedingly hard.

The dist, in the morning, I went out into the island with my gun to
seek for some food, and discover the country, when I killed it she-gout
and her kid followed me home, which I afterward killed also, because
ll. would nut feed.

.-\'ut,'cmhcr l. I set up my tent: under a. rock, and lay there for the
first night, making it as large as I could, with stakes driven into swing
my hammock upon.

Nnu. '3. I set up all my chests and boardsmnd the pieces of timber
which made my rafts, and with them formed a fence round me, a. little
within the place I had marked out for my fortification.

Nor. 3. I went out with my gun and killed two fowls like ducks,

which were very good food. In the afternoon I went to work to make
me a tnhle80 wvrxrcnss on

Nov. 4. This morning I began to order my times of work, of going
out with my gun, time )f sleep, and time of diversion, viz.: every
morning I walked out with my gun for two or three hours. if it did
not rain; then employed myself to work till about eleven o'clock;
then ate what I had to lire on; and from twelve to two I lay down to
sleep, the weather being excessive hot; and then, in the evening, to
wark again. The working part of this day and the next was wholly
employed in making my table, for I was yet but a very sorry work-
man, though time and necessity made me a complete natural mechanic
soon after, as I believe they would any one chic.

Nov. 5. This day went abroad with my gun and dog and killed a
wild eat; her skin pretty soft, but her flesh good for nothing. OI
every treatnre that I killed I took off the skins and preserved them.
Coming haul: by the xeashore I saw many sorts of sea fowl, which I
did not understand, but was surprised and almost frightened with two
or three seals, which, while I was gazing at them (not well knowing
what tiny were), got into the sea and escaped me for that time.

Nov. 6. After my morning' walk I went to work with my table
again and finished it, though not to my liking; nor was it long before
I learned to mend it.

Nov. 7. Now it began to he settled fair weather. The 7th, 8th,
9th, 10th, and part of the 12th (for the 11th was Sunday, according to
my reckoning), I took wholly up to make me a chair, and with numb
ado brought it to a tolerable shape: but never to please me, and even
in the making I pulled it to pieces several times.

Nora. I soon neglected my keeping Sundays, for, omitting my
marl: for them on my post, I forgot which was which.

Not-.13. This day it rained, which refreshed me exceedingly---
cooled the earth--but it was accompanied with terrible thunder and
lightning, which frightened mo dreadfully, for fear of my powder. As
soon as it was over I resolved to separate my stock of powder into as
many little parcels as possible, that it might not be in danger.

Nov. H, 15, 16. These three days I spent in making little square
chests or boxes, which might hold about a pound, or two pounds at most,
of powder ; and so, putting the powder in, I stowed it in places :u secure
and as remote from one another as possible. On one of these days i
killed a large bird that was good to eat, but I knew not what to call it.

Nov. 17. This day I began to dig behind my tent, into the rock, 1'.
make room for my further convenience.

Nora. Three things I wanted exceedingly for this work, viz., I
pielmxe, n. shovel,and a wheelbarrow or basket, so 1 desisted frcm m1
work, and began to consider how to supply these wants, and make me
some tools. As for a piekaxe I made use of the iron crows, which
were proper enough, though heavy, but the next thing was 11 thovel
or spade; this was so almolutely necessary that, indeed, I :ouul do
nothing effectually without it, but what kind of one to make I know
not.

Nov. 18. The next day, in searching the woods, I found It tree of
that wood, or like it, whi:h in the Brmils they call the iron tree, from
its exceeding hardness ; of this, with grout labor, and almost spoiling
my one. 1 cut a piece, and brought it home too, with difficulty enough,
for it was exceeding heavy. The excessive hardness of the wood, and
my having no other way, made me u long while upon this machine, for
I worked it effectually. by little and little, into the form ofo shovel or
spade, the handle exactly shuped like ours in England, only that the
broad part, having no iron shod upon it at bottom, it would not last
me so long; however, it served well enough for the uses which I had
occasion to put it to, but never was a shovel, I believe, made alter that
fiishion. or so long in making.

I was still deficient, for I wanted a basket or a wheelbarrow. A
basket l could not make by any moons, having no such things as twigs
that would bend to make wicker ware--at least none yet found out---
and as the wheelbarrow, I fancied I could make all but the wheel, but
that I had no notion of, neither did I know how to get about it ; be-
sides, I had no possible way to make iron gudgeous for the spindle or
axis of the wheel to run in, so I gnve it over; and, for carrying away
the earth which I dug out of the cave, I made me a thing like a bed.
which the lnlmrers carry mortar in for the brick-layers. This was not
so difficult for me as the making the shovel; and yet this and the
shovel, and the attempt which I made in vain to make u wheelbarrow,
look me up no less than four days; I mean always excepting my mom-
;ng walk with my gun, which I seldom omitted and very seldom failed,
also, bringing home something fit to eat

Nov. '23. My other work having new stood still, because of my
making these tools, when they were finished I went on, and working
every day, as my strength and time allowed, I spent eighteen days on-
tirely in widening and deepening my cove, that it might hold my
goods eonimodiously.

N om. During all this time I worked to make this room or can
spacious enough to accommodate me as a warehouse or magazine, a
kitchen, a dining-room, end a cellar. As for a lodging, I kept the
tent, except that sometimes in the wet season of the year it ruined a

4-
hard that I could not keep myself dry, which caused me afterward t:
can 1-" H" my place within my pale with long poles. and in the form oi
lulftl'rs, leaning against the rock, and load them with flags and large
learns of trees, like a thatch.

Dc mber 10. I began now to think my cove or vault finished, "'le '
on a sudden (it seems I had made it too large) a great quantity of on ll
fell down From the topnnd on One side, so much that in rlmrt it fright>>
ened me, and not without reason, too, for if I had been under ili
should nc\'e1 have wanted a grove-digger. Upon this disaster I had
it great deal of work to do over again, for I had the loose earth to
carry out, and, which was of more importance, I had the ceiling to
prop up, so that I might be sure no more would come down.

Drc. ll. This day I wont. to work with it accordingly, and got two
shores or posts pitched upright to the top, with two pieces of board
across m or each post; this I finished the next day, and setting more
posts up with hoards, in about a week more I had the roof secured;
and the posts standing in rows. served me for partitions to part oii' In:
Inst-ac.

Drc. 17. From this day to the 301h I placed shelves, and knock-ed
up nails on the posts, to hang everything up that could be hung up
and now i began to be in some order within doors.

Dec. 2". I carried everything into the cave, and began to furm.'-h
my house, and set up some pieces of hoards, like a dresser, to order
my \'icluala upon : but hoards begtn to he very scarce with mo; nls",
I made me another table.

Dec. '15. Rain all day.

Dec. '20. No rain, and the earth much cooler than before, and plea-
Billlhfl'.

Doc. 2?. Killed a young goat; and lamed another, so that I
catched it, and led it home in a string; when I had it home, I b0und,
and splintered up its leg, which was broke.

N. ll. I took such care of it that it lived; and the leg grew well.
and as strong as ever; but, by nursing it so long, it grew tan", am
fed upuu the little green at my near, and would not go away. Tim
was the first time thnt I entertained a thought of" breeding up some
tame creatures, that 1 might have food when my powder and shot was
all spent.

Doc. 2". 29, 30, 31. Great heats, and no breeze: so that there was
no stirring abroad, except in the evening, for food; this time I spent
'in putting all my things in order within door:
January 1. Very hot still; but I went abroad early and lots
with my gun, and lay still in the middle of the day. This evening
going farther into the volleys which lay toward the centre of the
island, I found there was plenty of gents, though exceeding shy, and
hard to come at ; however, I resolved to try if I could not bring my
dog to hunt them down. Accordingly, the next day, I went out with
.ny dog, und set him upon the goats ; but I was mistaken, for they
all faced about on the dog; and he knew his danger too well, for he
would not come near them.

.Ian. 3, Ibegan my fence or wall; which, being still jealous of
my being attacked by somebody, I resolved to make very thick and
strong.

N. B. This wall being described before, I purposely omit what
was said in the journal; it is sutiieient- to observe that I was no less
time than from the 3d of J ununry to the 14th of April, working,
finishing, and perfecting this wall ; though it was no more than about
twenty-five yards in length, being a half circle, from one place in the
rock to another plnce,nbout twelve yards from it, the door of the
cave being in the centre, behind it.

All this time I worked very hard; the ruins hindering me many
days, nay, sometimes weeks together; but I thought I should never
be perfectly secure till this wall was finished; und it is source credi-
hle what inexpressiblo labor everything was done with, especially the
bringing of piles out of the woods, and driving them into the ground;
for I made them much bigger than I needed to have done.

When this wall was finished, and the outside double fenced, with a.
turf wall raised up close to it, I persuaded myself that if any people
were to come on shore there they would not perceive anything like a.
hnbitzttion; and it was very well 1 did so, as may be observed here-
after, upon a very remarkable occasion.

During this time, I made my rounds in the woods for game every
day, when the rain permitted me, and mode frequent discoveries, in
these walks, of something or other to my advantage; particularly, I
found it kind of wild pigeons, who build, not as wood-pigeons, in a
use, but rather as house-pigeons, in the holes of the rocks 3 and, tak
mg some young ones, I endeavored to bring them up tame, and did
no; but when they grew older, they flew all away ; which, perhaps,
was, at first, for want of feeding them, for I had nothing to give them:
however, I frequently found their nests, and got their young ones
which were very good meat. And now, in the management of my
household affairs, I found myself wanting in many things, which I
thought at firstit was impossible for me to make; as indeed, as ti.
some of them, it was: for instance, I could never make a. cawk to ho
hooped. I had a small runlet or two, as I observed before; but I
could never arrive at the capacity of making one by them7 though I
spent many weeks about it. I could neither put in the heads, nor
join the stares so true to one another as to make them hold 'ater ' so 1
gave that also over. In the nextplace, I was at a great. loss for a
candle; no that as soon as it was dark, which was generally by Bern
o'clock, I was obliged to go to bed. I remember the lump of boa-
mix with which 1 made candles in my African adventure, but I had
none of that now the only remedy I had was that when l killed a
goat, I :Iavod the fallow; and with a little dish made of clay, which I
linked in the sun, to which l added a wick of some oakum, I made me
a lamp; and this gave me light, though not a clear steady light. like
it candle. In Ihe middle of all my labors, it happened that in run:-
nmging my things: I linnul a little bag; which7 as I hinted before_
had been filled with corn. for the feeding of poultry; not for this
voyage. but. before, nx' I suppose, when the ship came from Lishor

such use). l shook (.hc husk.>>- ol'eorn out of it, on one side of my forti-

great rain just. new mentioned, thatl
g no notice of anything. and not so much
as remembering that 1 had thrown anything there: when, about. a
month after, I saw Hume few stalks of sonwthing green. shooting out
of the ground, which I fanuiezl might be some plant I ilull not seen :
but I was surprised. and perfectly tutonished, when, after a little
longer time. I saw about ten or twelve ears come out! which were
perfect green barley, of the same kind as our European, nay, us our
English bar

it is impossible to express the astonishment and confusion of my

  

 

thoughts on this oevasinn. I had hitherto acted upon no religious
[inundation at all: indeed, I had very few notions of religion in my
heal, nor had entertained any sense of any things that had befallen
me, otherwise than us chance, or, as we lightly say, what pleases God:
without so mush us inquiring into the end of Providence in these
things, or hit order in governing events in the world. But after I
raw barley grew there, in a. climate which I knew was not proper le
corn, and especially as I knew- not how it eome there, it startled mo
strangely ; and I began to suggest, that God had miraculomly caused
[hie grain to grow without any help of seed sown, and that. it was st
directed purely for my sustenance, on that wild miserable place.

This touched my heart a little, and brought. tears out of my eyes;
Mid I began to bless myself that such a prodigy of nature should
happen upon my account: and this was the more strange to me, be<<
cause I saw near it. still, all along by the side of the rock, some other
straggling stalkg which proved to be stalks of rice, and which I
know, because I had seen it grow in Africa, when I was ashore,
there.

I not only thought these the pure productions of Providence for
my cup;>ort.but not doubting that there was more in the place, I went
over all that part of the island where I had been before, searching
in every corner, and under every rock, for more of it; but I could
not find any. At last it occurred to my thoughts, that I had shook
out a bag of ehieken's-nneat in that place, and then the wonder began
to cease 3 and I must confess, my religious thankfulnm to God's
providence began to abate too, upon the discovering of all this was
nothing but what was common ; though I ought to have been as
thankful for so strange and unforeseen n providence, asif it had been
miraculous; for it was really the work of Providence, as to me, that
should order or appoint that ten or twelve grains of corn should re-
main unspoiled, when the rats had destroyed all the rest, as if it had
been dropped from heaven; as also, that I should throw it out in
that particular place, where, it being in the shade of a high rock, it
sprang up innnediatoly; whereas, if I had thrown it anywhere else
at that time, it would have box-n burned up and destroyed.

l carefully saved the ears of this corn, you may be sure, in their
sswon, which. was about the end of June; and, laying up every corn,
I resolved to sow them all again, hoping, in time, to have some
quantity sufiicimt to supply me with bread. But it was not till the
fourth year that I could allow myself the least grain of corn to eat,
am] even then but sparingly, as I shall show afterward in its order;
for I lost. all that l sowed the first season, by not observing the
prnplar time ; as l sowed just before the dry season, so that it never
came up at all, at least Tot as it would have done; of which in its
plane.

Besides this barley, there were, as above, twenty or thirty stalks of
rice, which] preserved with the same care, and whose use was of the
suns lied, w to tno same purpose, via: to make me bread, or rat-her86 am'nx'mm-zs or

fund: for I found ways to cook it without baking, though I did that
also for some time. But to return to my journal. '

I worked excessively hard these three or four months, to get my
wall done; and the Nth of April I closed it up. contriving to get illto
it, not by a door, but. over the wall, by a ladder, that there might be
no sign on the outside of my habitation.

April 16. I finished the ladder; so I went up with the ladder to the
top, and then pulled it after me, and let it down in the inside; this
"as a complete enclosure to me, for within I had room enough, and
nothing could come at me from without, unless it could first mount my
wall.

The very next day after this wall was finished, I had almost all my
labor overthrown at once, and myself killed ; the case was thus :--As I
was quy in the inside of it behind my tent,just at the entrance int)
my care, I was terribly frightened with the most dreadful surprising
thing indeed; for, all on a sudden, I found the earth come crumbling
down from the roof of my cave, and from the edge ofthe hill over my
head, and two of the posts 1 had set up in the cave cracked in a
frightful manner. I was heartilyr scared, but thought nothing of wl.at
really was the cause, only thinking that the top of my care was full-
ing in, us some of it had done before; and lot fear I should be buried
in it, I ran forward to my ladder, and not thinking myself safe there
neither, I got over my wall for fear of the pieces of the hill which I
expected might roll down upon me. I had no sooner stepped down
upon the firm ground, thanl plainly saw it was a terrible earthquake;
for the ground I stood on shook three times at about eight minutes'
distance, with three such shocks as would have overturned the
strongest building that could be supposed to have stood on the earth;
and u. great piece of the top of a rock, which stood about half a. mile
from me, next the sea, fell down with such a terrible noise as I never
heard in all my life. I perceived also that the very sea was put int-o
aviolcnt motion by it; and I believe the shocks were stronger nude:
the water than on the island.

1 was so much amazed with the thing itself (having never felt the
like, our disooursed with any one that hard) that I was like one dead
or stupified ; and the motion of the earth made my stomach nick, like
one that was tossed at sea; but the noise of the falling of the rock
awaited me, as it were; and rousing me from the stupified condition I
mm. in, filled me with horror, and I thought of nothing but the bill
falling upon my tent and my household goods, and buryingan it
once this sunk my very soul within me a second time.
After the third shock was over, and I felt no more for some time, I
began to take courage ; yet I had not heart enough to go over my wall
Ignin, for {rear of being buried alive, but sat still upon the ground
greatly east. down, and disconsolate, not knowing ,what to do. All
this while I had not the least serious religious thought; nothing but
the common Lord, have mercy upon me! and when it was over, that
went. away too.

While I sat thus, I found the air overcast, and grow cloudy, as if it
u ould rain; and soon after the wind rose by a little and little, so that
in loss than half an hour, it blew a most dreadful hurricane; the so)
was, all on nsudden, covered with foam and froth ; the shore was cov-
ered With a breach of the water ; the trees were torn up by the roots
and a terrible storm it was. This held about three hourr. and then
began to abate; and in two hours more it was quite calm. and began
to rain very hard. All this while I sat. upon the ground, Very much
terrilicd and dejected; when, on a sudden, it came into my thoughts
that these winds and rain being the consequence of the earthquake
the earthquake itself was spent and over, and I might venture into my
"we again. With this thought my spirits began to revive, and the
min also helping to persuade me,I went in and sat. down in my tent;
but the rain was so violent, that my tent was ready to be beaten down
with it; and I was forced to ,get into my cave, though very much
afraid and uneasy, for fear it should fall on my head. This violent
rain forced me to a new work, viz.: to cut a hole through my new
fortification, like a sink, to let the water go out, which would else
have drowned my cave. After I had been in my cave for some time,
and found no more shocks of the earthquake follow. I legan to be
more composed. And now, to support my spirits, which indeed
wanted it very much, I went to my little store, and took a small cup
:1" rum; which, however, I did then, and always, very sparingly,
knowing I could have no more when that was gone. It continued
raining all that night and great part of the next day, so that I could
not stir abroad: but my mind being more composed, I began to think
of what I had best do--concluding. that if the island was subject to
then: earthquakes, there Would he no living for me in u cave, but I
must consider of building me some little but in an open place, which
I might surround with a wall, as I had done here, and so make my-
self secure from wild beasts or men; for if I stayed where I "113,1
should certainly, one time or other, be buried alive.

With these thoughts, I resolved to remove my tent from the place
where it now stood, being just under the hanging precipice of the
hill, and which. if it should be shaken again, would certainly fell upon
my tent. Ispent the two next. (hiya, being the 19th und 20111 of April,
in coutriving where nml how to remove my habitation. The fear of
heing swallowed olive nifected me no, that 1 never slept in quiet; and
yet the r. 4 ix rmion of lying nhrozul, without any fence, was nlmnst
equal In t: ; but still, when I looked about, and saw how everything
was 14:: in order, how pleasantly I was concealed, and how safe from
danger, it made me very loath to remove. In the meantime, itoo-
curred to me that it would require a rust deal of time for me to do
thi' and that i must be contented to run the risk where I was, till I
had formed a convenient camp, and scoured it no nsto remove it.
\Vith thin conclusion I composed myself for n time, and resolved that
I would go to Work with all speed to build me a wall with piles and
cables, &c., in a circle as before, and net up my tent in itwhon it Will
finished; but that I would venture to stay where I was till it mu
ready. and lit to remove to. This was the 2lst.

(f [pm \,AY 1. In the morning, looking toward the seaside, the tidt'
'3 i I being low, I saw something lie on the shore bigger than
ordinary, and it looked like a euslt; when I came to it, I
lhund n small barrel, and two or three pieces of the wreck of the
ship, which had been driven on there by the late hurricnne; and
looking toward the wreck itself, I thought it seemed to lie higher
out of the water than it need to do. I examined the barrel that was
driven on shore, and soon found it was a barrel of gunpowder; but
it had taken water, and the powder was caked as hard as a stone;
however, I rolled it. further on the shore for the present, and went on
upon the sands, as near as I could to the wreck of the ship to look
for more.

When I come down to the ship. I found it strangely removed. The
foreeastle, which lay helhre buried in the sand, was heaved up at
least six feet; and the stern (which was broke to pieces and ported
from the rest, by the force of the sea, soon after I had left runnnnging
of her) was tossed us it were, up, and cost on one side; and the sand
was thrown no high on that aide next her stern. that I could now walk
quite up to her when the tide was out; whereas there was a great
piece of water before, so that I could not come within a quarter of 3
mile of the wreck without swimming. I wot; surprised with this at
first, but soon concluded it must. be done by the earthquake; and as
by this violence the ship was more hrnken open than formerly, so
many things came daily on shore, which the son had loosened, and
which the winds and water rolled by degrees to the land.

This wholly divert-ed my thOughts from the design of removing my
habitation ; and I husied myself mightily, that day especially, in
searching whether I could make any way into the ship; but I found
nothing was to he expected of that kind, for all the inside ofthe ship
was choked up with sand. However, as I had learned not. to despair
of anything, I resolved to pull everything to pieces that I could cut
of the ship, concluding that everything I could get from her would
he of some use or other to me.

May 3. I began with my saw, and cut a piece of a beam through,

and when 1 had set it through, I cleared away the Bond as well an I90 mwmumcs or

ohligod to give over for that time.

May 4. I went 3 fishing. but caught out one fish that I durst cot

May 5. Worked on the wreck: out another hcnm usunder, nnd
brought three grout iil' planks ufi' from the ducks, which I tied togeth-
er, and mznh- swim on shore when the tide of flood came on.

May 6. Worked on the wreck: gut mvernl iron holtu out of her,
and other pieces of iron work: worked very hnrd, :llltl came home
very much tired, and hud thoughts of giving it. own.

May T. "'eut to the wreck again, hut not. with an intent. to work;
but [bowl the weight of the wreck hnd hroku itself down, the beams
Irving cut: thnt several pieces of the ship smmml to lie loose; and
the inside of the hold lay so open that I could see into it; but nlmoat
full of water and send.

May :4. Went to the wreck, and curried an iron crow, tn wrench
up the. deck, which lay now quite clear of the wutcr nnd sund. I
u'runciicd up two planks, and brought ( .cm on shore also with the

May 10:014. Wont every day to the wreck, and got. :1. great

I could not make any blow to drive the hatchet.

May 16. It had blown hard in the night, and the wreck appeared
more hrokcn by the force of the water; but I stayed so long in the
Woods, to gut pigeons for food, that the tide prevented my going to
the wreck that day.

J'Jay 17. I saw some pieces of the wreck blown on shore, at a
great distance, two miles off me, but resolved to see what they were.

and found it was a piece of the head. but too heavy for me to bring
sway.

hat day. bul- pieccs of timber, and a hogshead which had some Brazil

pork in it; but the salt water and the sand had Npmlltd it. I contin-
ued this work ever)- day to the 15th of June, except the time neeean
sary to gut food ; which I always appointed, during this part of my
Employment, to be when the tide is up. that I might be ready when
it was ebhetl out; and by this tune I had gotten timber, and plank
and iron work enough to have built- a good heat. If I had known how,
and I also got, at several times, and in several places, near one huu.
dred weight of sheet lead.

Jun: lti. Going down to the seaside, I found a large tortoise or
I turtle. This was the first I had seen; which. it means, was only my
minl'ortune, not any defect of the place or scarcity , for had l happened
to he on the other side of the island I might have had hundreds of
. them every day, as I found afterward ; but perhaps had paid dear
enough for them.

Jam 17. l spent in cooking the turtle. I found in her three score
eggs; and her flesh was to me, at that time, the most savory and
pleasant that] ever tasted in my life: having had no flesh, but of
goats and l'owls, nlnm'. I landed in this horrid place.

June 13. Rained all that day, and I stayed within. I thought, at
- at this time, the rain felt cold, and l was somewhat chilly; which I
- knew was not unusual in that latitude.

June 19. Very ill and shivering, as if the weather had been cold.

June 27. The agun again on Violent that-I lay n-hed all day, and
neither ate not drank I was ready to perish for thirst; hut so weak,
I had not strength to stand up, or to get myself any water to drink.
l'rayed to God again, but was light-headed: and when I was Iu't, .
was an ignorant that I knew not what to any: .'nly lay and cried
" Lord, look upon me! Lord, pity me'. Lord, have mercy upon me 1" }
suppose I did nothing elm for two or three hours: till the lit Wearing
off, I fell atleep. and aid not wake till far in the night. When!
awoke, I found myself much refreshed, but weak, and exceeding
thirsty; however, as I had no water in my whole habitation,l was
forced to lie till morning, and wont. to eleep again. In this second
sleepI had this terrible dream: I thought. thatI was sitting on the
ground, on the outside of my wall, where I eat when the storm blew
after the earthquake. and that I saw a man descend from a great
black cloud, in a bright flame of tire, and light upon the ground; he
was all over as bright as a flnme, so that I could but just hear to look
toward him: his countenance was inexpressibly dreadful, llllpl)SS:C/ll)l0
for words to describe; when he stepped upon the ground with his
feet, I thought the earth trembled, just. as it had done before in the
earthquake; and all the air looked, to my apprehension, as if it had
been filled with Ila-dies of fire. He had no sooner landed upon the
earth, lnut he moved forward toward me, with a long spear or weapon
in his hand, to kill me; and when he came to a rising ground, at
some distance, he spoke to me: or I heard a wire so terrible that it i!
impossible to express the terror of it; all that I can say I nnderstoot'
was this: " Seeing all these things have not brought thee to repentance
now thou shalt die _;'7 at which words, I thought he lifted up the spear
that was in his hand, to ltill me.

No one that shall ever read this neeount5 will expect that I Rhonld
be able to describe the horrors of my soul at thin terrible vision : I
mean, that even while it was a dream, I even dreamed of those hor-
rors: nor is it any more possible to describe the impression that re-
mained upon my mind when I awaited, and found it wag but a dream.

I had, alas! no divine knowledge; what I had received by the
good instruction of my father was then worn hat, by an uninterrupted
series, for eight years,of seafaring wickedness, and a constant conver-
sation with none but. such as were. like. tnyscif, wicked and profane to
the last degree. I do not remember that I had, in all that time, one
thought. that so much as tended either to looking upward toward God
or inward toward a reflection upon my own ways ; but a certain Btu
pidity of soul, without desire of good, or consciousness of evil, had on
tirrly overwhelmed me; and l was all that the most hardened, on
thinking, wicked creature among our common sailors, can he sup-
posed to he; not having the lemat sense, either of the fear of God, in
danger, or of thankfulness to him, in deliverancea.

In the relating what is already a part of my story, this will be the
mom easily believed, when I shall add,that through all the variety ol
miseries that had to this day hefallen me, I never had so much as one
tnought of its being the hand of God, or that it. was a just punislnnent
for my sin; either my rebellious behavior against my father, or my
present wine, which were great; or even as punishment for the gen-
eral course of my wicked life. When I was on the denpernte expedi-
tion on the desert shores of Africa, l never had so much as one

{nought of what would become of me: or one wish to God to direct
me, whither I should go, or t(. KOOP me from the danger which ap-
parently surrounded Inc, as well from voracious creatures us cruel
savages; hut I was quite thoughtless ofa God or a Providence; acted
like a mere hrute, from the principles of nature, and by the dictates
of common sense only; and indeed hardly that. When : was de-
livered and taken up at sea by the Portuguese captain, well used, and
dealt with justly, and honorably, as well as charitahly, I had not the
least thankfulness in my thoughts. When, again, I was shipwrecked;
mined, and in danger of drowning, on this island, I was far from re-
morse, or looking on it as a judgment; [only said to myself often,
that I was an unfortunate dog, and born to be always miserable.

I t is true, when I first got on shore here, and found all my ship's
crew drowned, and myself spared, I was surprised with a kind of ec-
stacy, and some transports of soul, which, had the grace of God as-
sisted, might have come up to true thankfulness ; but it ended where
it hogan. in a more common flight of joy; or, asl may say, being glad
i was alive, without the least reflection upon the distinguished good-
ness of the hand which had preserved me, and had singled me out to
be preserved when all the rest were destroyed, or any inquiry why
Providence had been thus merciful to me; just the some common
sort of joy which seamen generally have, after they are got safe
ashore from a shipwreck; which they drown all in the next bowl 0!
punch. and forget ainiost as soon as it is orer--and all the rest- of my
life was like it. Even when I was, afterward, on due consideration,
made sensible of my condition--how l was cast on this dreadful
place, out of the reach of human kind, mu: of all hope of relief, or
prospect of redemption--ms soon as I saw but a prospect of living, and
timtl should not starve nnd perish for hunger, all the sense of my
affliction wore oll', nnd I began to he very easy, applied myself to the
works prover for my pvescrvutinn and supply, and was far ezough
from being afilieted at my condition, as ujndgnu'nt from Heaven, or
as the hand Jt' God ngniust me; these were thoughts which very
seldom entered into my head.

The growing up of the earn, as is hinted in my Journal,ha'1, at
first, some little influence upon me, and hogan to afi'vct me wi:h
seriousness, as long as I thought it lmtl something miraculous in it;
but as soon as thnt part of the thought was remove-J, all the illllll'cfl'
nion which was raised from it. wore oil' also, as I have noted already.
Even the eartirlnzlke, though nothing cmllll he more terrible in ts
nature, or more immediately directing to the invisible I'owcr, whit-h
alone directs such lhings, yet no sooner was the. fright. over. hut the
impression it made went oil' also. I had no more sense of God or his
judgments, much less of the present alliictiun of my circulnatances
being from his hand, than ifl had been in the most prosperous con-
dition of life. lint now, when ] liegztn to be sick, and a leisure View
of the miseries of death came to place itself before me; when my
spirits began to sink under the burden of a strong distemper, nut] na-
ture \'as exhausted wi:h the violence of the fever; conscience, that
had slept so long, begun to awake; nnd I reproachod myself with my
past life. in which I had so evidently, by uncommon wickedness, pro.
voiced the justice of God to lay me under uncommon strokes, and to
deal with me in so vindictive a manner. These reflections oppressed
me for the second or third day of my distemper; and, in the \'ioicnce
as well of the fever us of the dreadful reproachcs of my conscience.
extorted from me some words like praying to God; though I cannot
any itiwns n prayer attended either with desires or with hopes; it
was rather the voice of more fright and distress. My thoughts were
confused; the convictions great upon my mind: and the horror or
dying in such a nuncrnhlo condition, raised 'apors in my head will:
the mere apprehension; nnd, in these hurries of my soul, I knew not
what my tangue might express; but it was rather cxclnmntion, such
as, " Lord, what a. miserable creature em I ! "I should be sick, I
shall certainly die for want of help; and what will become of me i '
Then the tears hurst out of my eyes, and 1 could say no more for a
good while. In this interval, the good ndrice of my father come, to
my mind, and presently his predictim, which I mentioned at the be-
ginning of this story, vie: that if I did take this foolish step, 003
<<Mud not bless me; an! I should have leisure hereafter to reflect
upon hnviu g neglected his counsel, when there might be none to assist
in my recovery. " Now," said I= aloud, " my dear futhcr's words are
come to pass; God's justice has overtaken me, and I have nano 52
help or hear me. I rejected the voice of Providence, which had mu-
eifully put me in a. station of life wherein I might have been happy
and easy; but I would neither see it myself, nor learn from my pu-
rcnts to know the blessing of it. I left them to mourn over my folly,
and now I mu left to mourn under the consequences oi'it; I refused
their help and assistance, who would have pushed me in the world.
and would have made everything easy to me; and now I have diflh
cultics to struggle with, too great for even nature itself to summit;
and no assistance, no comfort, no nd\'ic-:." 'l'hcn I cried out, " Lord,
be my help, for I am in great dishess." This was the first prayer, il
1 may so call it, thatI had inudo for .nony years. But I return to my

journal.

~---- UNE 28. IInving been somewhat refreshed with the sleep I
' 9 had had, and the {it being entirely 011', I got up, and though
> i the fright nnd terror of my dream was very great, yet I con-
sidered that the fit of the nguc would return again the next
day, and now was my time to get something to refresh and support
myself when I should be ill. The first thing I did was to fill it largo
aquxtre case bottle with water, and set it upon my table, in reach of
my bread, and to take 05' the chill or ngueish disposition of the wuter,
I put about a. quarter of a. pint of rum into it, and mixed thorn to-
gether. Then I got me n piece of the goat's flesh, and broiled it on
the coals, but could out very little. I walked about but was very
weak, and withnl very sad and heavy-hearted in the sense of my mise-
r'tble condition, dreading the return of my distemper the next day.
At night I made my supper of three of the turtle's eggs, which I
roasted in the ashes and etc, as we call it, in the shell ; and this was
the first bit of meat I had ever asked God's blessing to, as I could re-
member, in my whole life. After I had eaten Itricd to walk, but
found myself so weak that I could hardly carry the gun (for I never
went out without that), so I went but a little way and sat down uptn
the ground, hiking out upon the sea which was just before me, and
very calm and smooth. As I sat here, some such thoughts as these
occurred to me: What is this earth and sea, of which I have seen so
much ? thnee is it produced? And what am I, and all the other
creatures, wild and tame. human and brutal ? Whenco are we?
Surely we are all made by some secret power, who formed the earth
and sea, the air and sky; and who is that? Then it followed most
naturally, it. is God that has made all. Well, but then, it came on, if
God has made all these things, he guides and governs them all and all
things that concern them; for the power that could make all things
Ltust certainly have power to guide and direct them; if so, nothing
can happen in the great circuit of his works, either without his know-
ledge or aplmit-tment.

And ifnoth'ng happens "ithaut his knowledge, he knows that I am
here, and am in this dreadful condition; and it" nothing happens witho
out his appointment, he has appointed all this to befall me. Nothing
occurred to my thought to contradict any of these conclusions, and
therefiire it rested upon me with the greatest force that it must needs
be that God had appointed all this to befall me; that I was brought
to this miserable circumstance by his direction, he having the sole
power, not of me only, but of everything that happens in the world.
Immediately it fiillowed: "Why has God done this to me ? What have
I done to he thus used 1-" My conscience presently checked me in that
inquiry, as if I had blasphomed, and methought it spoke to me like a
voice: "Wt-etch! dost than ask what thou hast done ? Look back upon
a dreadful, misspent life, and ask thyself what thou hast not done?
Ask why is it thou wort not long ago destroyed? Why wort thou
not drowned in Yarmouth Roads; killed in the fight when the ship
was taken by the Sallce man-of-war; devoured by the wild beasts on
the coast of Africa; or drowned here, when all the crew perished but
thyself? Dost thu ask what thou hast done '3" l was struck dumb
with these reflections, as one astonished, and had not a word to say--
no, not to answer to myself--and rising up, pensive and sad, walked
back to my retreat, and went over my wall as if I had been going to
bed; but my thou glits were sadly disturbed, and I had no inclination
to sleep. so I sat down in the chair and lighted my lamp, for it began
to be dark. Now, as the apprehension of the return of my distemper
terrified me very much, it occurred to my thought that the Brazilians
take no physio but their tobacco for almost all distemper-9, and I had
a. piece of a rollof tobacco in one of the chests, which was quite cured,
and some, also, that was green, and not quite cured.Ionmsos CRUSOI. 97

I went, directed by Heaven, no doubt, for in this chestI found a
cure for both soul and body. I opened the chest and found what I
looked for, viz., the tobacco; and as the few books I had saved lay
there too, I took out one of the bibles which I mentioned before, and
which, to this time,[ had not found leisure or so much as inclination
to look into. I say [took it out, and brought both that and the tobacco
with me to the table. What use to make of the tobacco I knew not,
Is to my distemper. nor whether it was good for it or not, but I tried
several experiments with it, as if I was resolved it should hit one way
or other. I first took a piece of tho leaf and chewed it in my month,
which indeed, at first, almost stupiticd my brain, the tobacco being
green and strong, and such as I had not been much used to. Then I
took some and steeped it an hour or two in some rum, and resolved to
take a dose of it when I lay down; and lastly, I burnt some upon a
pan of coals, and held my nose close over the smoke of it as long as I
could bear it, as well for the heat as almost for sufi'oeation. In the
interval of this operation I took up the bible and began to read, but
my head was too much disturbed by the tobacco to bear reading, at
least at that time; only, having opened the hook casually, the first
words that occurred to mo were these: "Call on me in the day (f
trouble and I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me." These
words were very apt to my case, and made some impression upon my
thoughts at the time of reading them, though not so much as they did
afterward; for, as for being delivered, the word had no sound, as I may
say, to me; the thing was so remote, so impossible in my apprehen-
sion of things, that, as the children of Israel said, when they were
promised flesh to eat, " Can God spread a table in the wilderness?"
so I began to say, " Can even God himself deliver me from this
place 1" And as it was not for many years that any hopes appeared,
this prevailed very often upon my thoughts; but, however. the words
made a great impression upon me, and I mused upon them very often.
It now grew late, and the tobacco had, as I said, dozed my head so
much that I inclined to sleep, so I left my lamp burning in the cave,
Icst I should want anything in the night, and went to bed; but, be-
fore I lay down, I did what I never had done in all my life, I knecled
down and prayed to God to fulfil the promise to me. After my bro-
ken and imperfect prayer was over, I drank the rum in which I had
steeped the tobacco, which was so strong and rank of the tobacco that
indeed I could scarce get it down ; immediately upon this I went to
bed. I found, presently, the rum flew up into my head violently, but
I fell into a sound sleep and waked no more till, by the sun, it must

5
necessarily be near three o'clock in the afternoon the next day ; any
to this hour, I am partly of opinion that I slept all the next day and
night, and till almost- threo the day after; for, otherwise, I know not
how I should lose it day out of my reckoning in the days of the week,
as it appeared, some years after, I had done; for, if I had lost it by
crossing and roe--crossing the line, I should have lost more than one
day; but certainly I lost a day in my account, and never know which
way. Be that, however, one way or the other, when I awaited I found
myself exceedingly refreshed, and my spirits lively and cheerful.
When I got up I was stronger than I was the day before, and
my stomach better, for I was hungry; and, in short, I had no tit
the next day, but continued much altered for the better. This was
the 20th.

The 30th was my well day, of course; and I went abroad with
my gun, but did not. care to travel too far. I killed a sea-fowl or
two, something like a brand goose, and brought them home, but
was not very forward to eat them; so I ate some more of the
turtle's eggs, which were very good. This evening I renewed the
medicine, which I had supposed did me good the day before, via, the
tobacco steeped in rum ; only I did not take so much as before, nor
did I chew any of the leaf; or hold my head over the smoke ; how-
ever, 1 was not- so well the next day, which was the lst of July, as
I hoped I should have been; for I had a little of the cold tit, but
it was not much.

July 2. I renewed the medicine all the three ways; and dosed
myself with it as at first, and doubled the quantity which I drank.

July 3. I missed the fit for good and all, though I dial not recover
my full strength for some weeks after. While I was thus gathering
strength, my thoughts run exceedingly upon this Seripture,"l will
deliver thee ;" and the impossibility of my deliverance lay much upon
my mind, in bar of my over expecting it: but as I was discouraging
myself with such thoughts. it occurred to my mind that I pared so
much upon my deliverance from the main affliction, that I disregarded
the deliverance I had received; and I was, as it were, made to ask
myself such questions as those, vi7.., llave I not been delivered, and
wonderfully, too, from sickness; from the meet distressed condition
that could he and that was so frightful to me 'I and what. notice havn
I taken of it? llave I done my part! God has delivered me, hut. I
have not glorified him; that is to say, I have not owned and been
thankful for that us a deliverance : and how can I expect a greater
deliverance? This touched my heart very much ; and immediately I
knelt down, and gave God thanks aloud for my recovery from my
sickness.

July 4. In the morning I took the Bible: and beginning at the
New Testament, I began seriously to read it ,' and imposed upon my-
self to read awhile every morning and every night; not binding mysell
to the number of chapters, but as long as my thought: should engage
me. It was not long after I set seriously to this work, that I found
my heart more deeply and sincerely affected with the wickedness of
my past life. The impression of my dream revived: and the words,
" All these things have not brought thee to repentance," ran seriously
in my thoughts. 1 was earnestly begging of God to give me repeat-
ance, when it happened providentially, the very same day, that, read
ing the Scripture-,1 came to these words, "110 is exalted a Prince
and a. Saviour, to giro repentance and to give remimiou." I threw
down the book; and with my heart as well as my hands lifted up to
heaven, in a. kind of eestaey oi'joyJ cried out aloud," Jesus, thou Set
of David! Jesus, thou exalted Prince and Saviour! give me repentw
ance l" This was the first time in all my life I could say, in the true
sense of the words, that. I prayed; for new I prayed with a sense of
my condition, and with a true scripture view of hope, founded on the
encouragement of the word of God; and from this time I may say, I
began to have hope that God would hear me.

New I began to construe the words mentioned above, "Call on
me, and I will deliver thee," in a different sense from what I had
ever done before; for then I had no notion of anything being called
delivcramc, but my being delivered from the captivity I was in; for
though I was at large in the place, yet the island was certainly a
prison to me. and that in the worst sense in the world. But now I
learned to take it in another sense ; now I looked back upon my past
life with such horror, and my sins appeared so dreadful, that my
soul sought nothing of God but deliverance from the load of guilt
that bore down all my comfort. As for my solitary life, it was
nothing; I did not so much as pray to he delivered from it, or think
of it ; it was all of no consideration, in comparison with this. And I
add this part here, to hint to whoever shall read it, that whenever
they come to a true sense of things, they will find deliverance from
sin a much greater blessing than deliverance from amictien.

My condition began now to be, though not less miserable as to my
way ofliving, yet much easier to my mind ; and my thoughts being
directed, by constantly reading the Scripture and praying to God, to
things of a higher nature, I had a great deal of comfort with";
which, till now, I know nothing of; also, as my health and strength
returned, I bestirred me to furnish myself with everything that I
Wanted, and make my way of living as regular as I could.

From the 4th of July to the Nth, I was chiefly employed in walk-
ing about with my gun in my hand, a little and a little at a time, an
a man that was gathering up his strength after a. fit of sickness; for
it is hardly to be imagined how low I was, and to what weakness I
was reduced. The application which I made use of was perfectly
new. and perhaps what. had never cured an aguc before: neither can
I recommend it to any one to practise, by this experiment; and
though it did carry all the fit. yet it rather contributed to weaken
me; (or I had frequent convulsions in my nerves and limbs for some
time. I learned from it. also this, in particular; that being abroad in
the rainy season was the most- pernicious thing to my health that
could be, especially in those rains which came attended with storms
and hurricanes ofwind; for as the rain which came in the dry season
was almost. always accompanied with such storms, so I found that this
rain was much more dangerous than the rain which fell in September
and October.

I had now been in this unhappy island above ten months. All
possibility of deliverance from this condition seemed to be entirely
taken from me : and I firmly believed that no human shape had ever
set foot upon that place. Ilaving secured my habitat-ion,as I thought,
fully to my mind, I had a great desire to make u more perfect. dis-
covery of the island, and to see what other productions I might find
which I yet knew nothing of.

It was on the 15th of July that I began to take a more particular
survey of the island itself. I went up the creek first, where, as I
hinted, I brought. my rafts on shore. I found after I came about two
miles up, that the tide did not {low any higher; and that it was no more
than a little brook of running water, very fresh and good; but this
being the dry season, there was hardly any water in some parts of it;
at. least, not any stream. 0n the banks of this brook I found many
pleasant savannahs or meadows, plain, smooth, and covered with
grass; and on the rising parts of them, next to the higher grounds
(where the water, as it might be supposed. never overflow-ed). I found a
great deal of tobacco, green, and growing to a very great :tnd strong
stalk: and there were divers other plants, which I had no knowledge
of, or understanding about and that might, perhaps, have virtues of
their own, which I could not find out. I searched for the cassava
root, which the Indians in all that climate, make their bread of; but
I could find none. Isaw large plants of aloee, but did not understand
them. I saw several sugar-canes, but wild ; and, for want of cultiva-
tion, imperfect. I contented myself with these discoveries for this
time ; and came back, musing with myself what course I might take
to know the virtue and goodness of any of the fruits or plants which
1 should discover; but could bring it to no conclusion; for, in short,
1 made so little observation while I was in the Brazils, that I knew
ittle of the plants in the field; at least, very little that might serve
me to any purpose now in my distress.

The next day, the 16th, I went up the same way again; and after
going something further than I had gone the (lay before, I found the
brook and the savannahs begin to cease, and the country became more
woody than before. In this part I found difl'orent fruits; and partic-
ularly I found melons upon the ground in great abundance, and grapes
upon the trees; the vines, indeed, had spread over the trees, and the
clusters of grapes were now just in their prime, very ripe and rich.
This was a surprising discovery, and I was exceedingly glad of them;
but I was warned by my experience to eat sparingly of them; remem-
bering, that when I was ashore in Barbary, the eating of grapes killed
several of our Englishmen, who were slaves there, by throwing them
into fluxes and fevers. I found, however, an excellent use for these
grapes; and that was to cure or dry them in the sun, and keep them
as dried grapes or raisins are kept 3 which I thought would be (as in-
deed they were) as wholesome and as agreeable to eat, when no grapes
were to he had.

I spent all that evening there, and went- not back to my habitat-ion:
which, by the way-mars the first night, 1131 might say, I had lain from
home. At night, I took my first contrivnnce, and got up into a tree,
where i slept well ; and the next morning proceeded on my discovery,
travelling near four miles 1181 mightjudge by the length of the val-
ley ; keeping still due north, with a ridge of hills on the south and
north sides of me. At the end of this march I came to an opening,
where the country seemed to descend to the west; and a little spring
of fresh water, which issued out of the side of the hill by me, ran
the other way, that is due east; and the country appeared so fresh,
so green, so flourishing, everything being in a constant verdure, or
flourish of spring, that it looked like a planted garden. I descended
a little on the side of that delicious vale, surveying it with a. secret
kind of pleasure (though mixed with other afflicting thoughts), to think
that this was all my own ; that I was king and lord of all this country
indefeasioly, and had a right of possession; and, if I could come,102 wvexrenu or

it, I might have it in inheritance as completely as any lord of a man-
or in England. I saw here abundance of cocoa trees,and orange and
lemon. and eitron trees, but all wild, and very few bearing any fruit;
at least not then. However, the green limes that lgathered were not
July pleasant to eat. but very wholesome; andl mixed their juice
afterward with water, which made it very wholesome, and very cool
and refreshing. I found now I had business enough, to gather and
carry lnnne; and I resolved to lay up a store, as well of grales ns
limes and lemons, to furnish myself for the wet season, which I knew
was approaching. In order to this,l gathered a great heap of grapes
in one place, a lesser heap in another plaee; and a great parcel of
limes and lemons in another place; and taking a few of each with
me, I travelled homewarll ; and resolved to come again, and bring a
bag or saek, or what I could make, to carry the rest home. Accor-
dingly, having spent three days in this journey, I came home (so I
must now call my tent and my care); but bel'orel got thither, the
grapes were spoiled: the richness of the fruits, and the weight of the
juice, having broken and bruised them, they were good for little or
nothing: as to the limes, they were good, but [could bring only a
few.

The next day being the 10th, I went back, having made me twc
small bags to bring home my harvest; but I was surprised, when
coming to my heap of grapes, "'Ilittll were so rich and fine when I
gathered them, I found them all spread about, trod to pieces, and
drngged about, some here, some there, and abundance eaten and de-
voured. By this l concluded there were some wild creatures there
abouts which had done this, but what they were I knew not. How-
ever, as I found there was no laying them up in heaps, and no carry-
ing them away in a sack; but that one way they would be destroyed,
and the other way they would be crushed with their own weight; I
took another course: I then gathered a large quantity of the grapes
and hung them upon the out-branches ot' the trees, that they might
oure and dry in the sun ; and as for tho limes and lemons, I carried
us many back as I could well stand under.

When I came home from this journey, I contemplated with great
pleasure the fruitful-nose of that. valley, and the pleasantness of the
situation; the security from storms on that side; the water and the
wood : and concluded that I had pitched upon a place to fix my abode
in, which was by far the. worst part of the country. Upon the whole,
I began to consider of removing my habitation, and to look out for a
place equally safe as where I was now situate; if possible in that
pleasant fruitful part of the island<<Fizatmwweawebimw r.-

   

 

nonxxsox causes. 103

This thought ran long in my hood; and I was exceeding fond of it
for some time, the pleasantness of the place tempting me; but when
I came to n. nearer view of it, I considered that I was now by the sea-
side, where it was at lcust possible that something might happen to
my advantage, and by the same ill-fate that brought me hither,might
bring some other unhappy wretchcs to the same place; and though it
was scarce probable that any such thing should ever happen, yet to
enclose myself among tho hills and woods in the centre of the island,
was to nuticipnte my bonduge, and to render such an aflitir not only
improbable but impossible; and that therefore Ionght not by any
menus to remove. llowever, I was so enamored of this place, that I
spent much of my time there for the whole remaining part of the
month of J uly ; and though, upon second thoughts, I resolved, on
above stated, not to remove, yet I built me it little kind of n bower,
and surrounded it at n. distance with a strong fence, being a double
hedge, as high as I could tench, well staked, and filled between with
brushn'ood. Here I lay very secure sometimes two or three night!
together; alwuys going over it with a ladder, as before; so that I
fancied now I had my country and my seucoust house. This work
took me up till the beginning of August.

I lutd but newly finished my fence, and began to enjoy my labor,
when the ruins came on, und made me stick close to my first habitan
tiou ; for though I had made a tent like the other, with a piece of sail,
and spread it very well, yet I had not the shelter of n hill to keep me
from storms, nor a cure behind me to retreat into when the rains
were extrmlrdinnry.

About the beginning of August, as I said, I had finished my bower,
and began to enjoy myself The 3d of August, I found the grapes I
had hung up were perfectly dried, and indeed were excellent good
raisins of the sun ; so I began to tuke them down from the trees, and
it was very happy thut I did so, as the ruins which followed would
have spoiled them, and I should have lost the best part of my winter
food ; for I had above two hundred large bunches of them. No soon-
er lmd I taken them all down, and carried most of them home to my
care, but it began to rain; and from hence, which was the 14th of
August, it mined, more or less, every day till the middle of October;
and sometimes so violently that I could not stir out of my cave fol
several days.

In this season I was much surprised with the increase of my family
I had been concerned for the loss of one of my cats, who ran away
from me, or, as I thought, had been dead, and I heard no morecf he:
till, to my astonishment, she came home with three kittens. This we!
the more strange to me, because. about the end of August, though I
had killed a wild cat. as I called it, with my gun, yet I thought it
Was quite a diii'erent kind from our European cats; yet the young
cats were the same kind of house-breed as the old one, and both of
my cats being females, I thought it very strange. But from them three
I afterward came to he so poStered with cats that I was forced to
kill them like vermin. or wild beasts, and to drive them from my
house as much as powihle.

From the ch of August to the 26th, incessant rain, no that I could
not stir, and mu now very careful not to be much wet. In this cum
fiucmeut I hogan to he straitencd for food, but venturing out twice, 7
one day killed a goat, and the last. (lay, which was the 24th, found a
very large. tortoise, which was a rent to me. My food was now regn.
lated thus: 1 ate a bunch of raisins for my breakfast, n piece of the
goat's flesh or of the turtle, hroilcd, for my dinner (for, to my great
misfortune, I had no vessel to boil or stew anything). and two or three
of tho turtle's eggs for my supper.

During this confinement in my cover from the rain, I worked daily
two or three hours at enlarging my care, and hy degrees worked it
on toward one side, till I came to the outside of the hill. and made a
door, or way out. which came beyond my fence, or wall, and so I
came in and out this way. But I was not perfectly (any at lying so
open, for, as I had managed myself before, I was in a perfect enclo-
sure, whereas now I thought I lay exposed; and yet I could not per-
ceive that there was any living thing to fear, the biggest creature
that I had as yet seen upon the island hoing a goat.

September 30. I was now come to the unhappy anniversary of my
landing: I cast up the notches of my post, and found I had been on
shore three hundred and sixty-five days. I kept this day as u solemn
fast, setting it apart for religious exercise, prostrating myself on the
ground with the most serious humiliation, confessing my sins to God.
acknowledging his righteous judgments upon me, and praying to him
to have mercy on me, through Jesus Christ; and, having not tasted
the least refreshment for twelve hours, even till the going down of
the sun, 1 then ate a biscuit and a bunch of grapes and went to lied,
finishing the day as I began it. I had all this time observed .10 Sub-
bath day, for as at first I had no sense of religion upon my mimi, I
had, after some time, omitted to distinguish the weeks, by making a
longer notch than ordinary for the Sabbath day, and so did not really
know what any of the days were 3 but now, having cost up the day:
Is above, I found I had been there a year, so I divided it into weeks.
and set apart every seventh day for a Sabbath; though I found, at
the end of my account, I had lost 9. day or two in my reckoning. A
little after this, my ink beginning to fail me, I contented myself to
use it more sparingly, and to write down only the most remarkable
events of my life. without continuing a daily memorandum of other

'I'he rainy seasoa and the dry sensou begun now to appear regular
to me, and I learned to divide them, so as to provide for them accord-
ingly ; but I bought all my experience before I had it, and what I am
going to relate was ene of the most discouraging experiments that 1
had made at all.

I have mentioned that I had saved a few ears of barley and rice,
which I had so surprisingly found sprung up, as I thought, of them-
selves. I believe there were about thirty stalks of rice, and about
twenty of barley, and new I thenght it a proper time to sow it after
the rains, the sun being in its southern position, going from me ; ae-
Cordingly,I dug a. piece of ground as well as I could with my wooden
spade, and dividing it into two parts, I sowed my grain ; but as I was
sowing, it casuall' occurred to my thoughts that I would not new it
all at first, because. I did not know when was the proper time for it ;
so I sowed about two thirds of the seed, leaving about a. handful of
each ; and it was a great comfort for me, afterward, that I did so, for
not one grain of what I sowed this t'me came to anything, for the dry
moath following, and the earth having thus had no rain after the seed
was sown, it had no moisture to assist its growth, and never came up
at all till the wet season had come again, and then it grew as if it had
been but newly sown. Finding my first seed did not grow, which I
easily imagined was from the drought, I sought for a moister piece of
ground to make another trial in ; and I dug up a piece of ground
near my new bower, and sowed the rest of my seed in February, a
little before the vernal equinox. This, having the rainy menths of
March and April to water it, sprung up very pleasantly, and yielded
a very good crop; but, having only a part of the seed left, and not
daring to sow all that I had, I got but a small quantity at last, my
whole crop not amounting to above half a peek of each kind. But
by this experiment I was made master of my business, and knew
exactly when was the proper time to sow, and that I might expect
two seed times and two harvests every year.

While this corn was growing I made a little discovery, which was
of use to me afterward As soon as the rains were over, an! the we:

The rainy season held sometimes longer and sometimes shorter, u
the winds happened to blow ; but. this was the general observation I
made. After l had found, by experience, the ill consequences of
being abroad in the rain. I took care to furnish myself with provil
loss before hand, that I might not be obliged to go out; and I set
within doors as much as possible during the wet months. This time
I found much employment, and very suitable also to tho time; for I
found great occasion for many things which I had no way to furnish
myself with but by hard labor and constant application ; particularly,
I tried many ways to make myself a basket; but all the twigs I
could get for the purpose proved so brittle that they would do
nothing. It proved an excellent advantage to me now, that when I
was a boy, I used to take great delight in standing at a basket;
maker's in the town where my father lived, to see them make their
wicker-ware; and being, as boys usually are, very officious to help,
and a great observer of the manner how they worked those things,
and sometimes lending a hand, I had by these means full knowledge
of the methods of it, so that I wanted nothing but the materials;
when it came into my mind, that the twigs of that tree from whence
I cut my stakes that grew, might possibly be as tough as the sallows,
willows, and osicrs, in England; and I resolved to try. Accordingly,
the next day I went to my country-house, as I called it, and cutting
some of the smaller twigs, I found them to my purpose as much as I
could desire; whereupon 1 came the next time prepared with a
hatchet to cut down :1. quantity, which I soon found, for there was
plenty of them. Those I set up to dry within my circle or hedge;
and when they were {it for use, I carried them to my cave ; and here,
during the next season, I employed myself in making, as well as I
could, several baskets; both to carry earth, or to carry or lay up any-
thing as I had occasion for. Though I did not finish them very hand-
somely, yet I made them sufficiently serviceable for my purpose ; and
thus, afterward, I took care never to be without them: and as my
wicker-ware decayed, I made more; especially strong deep baskets,
to place my corn in, instead of socks, when I should come to have
any quantity of it.

liaving mastered this difiuulty, and employed a world of time
about it, I bestirrod myself to see, if possible, how to supply two other
wants. I had no vessel to hold anything that was liquid, except two
I'm-lets, which were almost full of rum ; and some glass bottles some
of the common size, and others (which were case bottles) square, for
the holding of waters, spirits, the. I had not so much as a pot to boil
anything, except a great kettle which I saved out of the ship, which
was too big for such use as I desired it, via: to make broth, and stew
a bit of meet by itself. The second thing I would fuin have had was
a tobacco pipe; but it was impossible for me to make one ; howevefi108 anvmom or

I found a contrivnnce for that too at last. I employed myself in
planting my second row of stakes or piles, and also in this wicker-
working all the summer or dry season; when another business took
me up more time than it could he imagined I could spare

and a great- hunch of raisins in my pouch, for my store, I began my
journey. Wheul had passed the vale where my bower stood, as

name very familiarly. But the accident that followed, though it be
a trifle, will be very diverting in its place.

I was exceedingly amused with this journey. I found in the low
grounds hares. as I thought them to he, and foxes; but they diti'ered
greatly from all the other kinds I had met with; nor could I ratisl' y
myseit' to eat them, though I killed several. But I had no need to he
renturous, for I had no want of food, and of that which was very
good too, especially with three sorts, riz.: goats, pigeons, and lut'lic,
or tortoise. With these, added to my grapes, Leadeuhall-marlt'et
could not have furnished a table better than I, in proportion to the
company; and though my case was deplorable enough, yet I had
great cause for thankfulness; as I was not driven to any extremities
for food, but had rather plenty, even to daintics.

I never travelled on this journey above two miles outright in a day,
or theroahout ; but I took so many turns and returns to see what dis-
coveries I could make, that I came weary enough to the place where
I resolved to sit down for the night; and then I either reposed myself
in a tree, or surrounded myself with a row of stakes, set upright in
the ground, either from one tree to another, or so as no wild creature
could come at me without waking me.

As soon as I came to the seashore, Iwas surprised to see thatI had
taken up my lot on the worst side of the island ; for here indeed the
shore was covered with innumerable turtles; whereas, on the other
side, I had found hut three in a year and a half. Here was also an
infinite numher of fowls of many kinds; some of which I had seen,
and some of which I had not- seen before, and many of them very
good meat; but such as I knew not the names of, except those called
penguins.

I could hare shot as mnnyas I pleased, but was very sparing of my
powder and shot; and therefore had more mind to kill a she-goat, if I
could, which I could better feed on. But, though there were many
goats here, more than on my side of the island, yet it was with much
more (liliieulty that I could come near them; the country being flat
and even, and they saw me much sooner than when I was upon a
hill.

I confess this side of the country was much pleasanter than mine;
yet I had not the least inclination to remove; for as I was fixed in
my habitation, it became natural to me, and I seemed all the while I
was hereto be as it were upon a journey, and from home. How-
ever, I travelled along the seashore toward the east, I suppose about
twelve miles 5 and then setting up a great pole upon the than for a110 ADVEN l'L'Rl-ZS or

easily keep so much of the island in my View, that I could not miss

taken; for being come about two or three miles,I found myself
descended into a very large valley. but so surrounded with hills, and
those hills covered with wood, that I could not see which was my
way by any direction but that of the sun, nor even then, unless I
knew very well the position of the sun at that time of the day. And
it happened to my farther misfortune, that the weather proved hazy
for three or four days while I was in this valley ; and not being able
to see the sun. I wandered about very uncomfortable, and at last was
obliged to find out the seaside. look for my post, and come back the

,\ 1 N this journey, my dog surprised a young kid, and seized upon
@ it: and running to take hold of it, I caught it, and saved
1 i it alive from the (log. I had a great mind to bring it home

if I could; for I had often been musing whether it might not
be possible to get a kid or two, and so raise a breed of tame goats
which might supply mo when my powder and shot would be all spent.
I made a collar for this little creature, with a string which I had
made of some rope-yarn, which I always carried about me ; I led him
along, though with some difficulty, till I came to my bower, and there
I enclosed him and left him ; for I was very impatient to be at home,
from whence I had been absent above a month.

I cannot express what a satisfaction it was to me to come into my
old hutch, and lie down in my hammock bed. This little wandering
journey, without a settled place of abode, had been so unpleasant to
me. that my own home, as I called it to myself, was a perfect settle-
ment to me, compared to that; and it rendered everything about menonisson csuson. 111

so comfortable, that I resolved I would never go a great way from it
again, while it should be my lot to stay on the island.

I rcposcd myself here a week, to rest and regalo mysrlf after my
long journey; during which, most of the time was taken up in the
weight-y nfi'air of making a cage for my Poll, who now began to be
more domestic, and to be mighty well acquainted with me. Then I
began to think of the poor kid which I had penned within my little
circle, and resolved to fetch it home, or give it some food ; accordingly
I wont, :md found it where I left it (for indeed it could not get out),
but was almost starved for want of food. I went and cut boughs of

recs, and branches of such shrubs as I could find, and threw it over,

and having fed it, I tied it as I did before, to lead it away; but it
was 2:0 tame with being hung: , that I had no need to have tied it, for
it followed me like a dog; and as I continually fed it, the creature
became so loving, so gentle, and so fond, that it was from that time
one of my domestics also, and would never leave me afterward.

The rainy season of the autumnal equinox was now come, and I
kept the 30th of September in the same solemn manner as before,
being the anniversary of my landing on the island; having now been
there two years, and no more prospect of being delivered than the
first day I came there. I spent the whole day in humble and thank-
ful acknowledgments for the many wonderful mercies which my
solitary condition was attended with, and without which it might
have been infinitely more miserable. I gave humble and hearty
thanks to God for having been pleased to discover to me, that it was
possible I might be moro happy oven in this solitary condition, than
I should have been in the enjoyment of society, and in all the
pleasures of the world; that he could fully make up to me the de-
ficiencies of my solitary state, and the want of human society, by his
presence, and the communication of his grace to my soul: support-
ing, comforting, and encouraging me to depend upon his providence
here, and to hope for his eternal presence hereafter.

It was now that I began sensibly to feel how much more happy
the life I now led was, with all its miserable circumstances, than the
wicked, cursed, abominable life I led all the past part of my days.
And now I changed both my sorrows and my joys; my very desires
altered, my affections changed their gusts, and my delights were
perfectly new from what they were at my first coming, or indeed for
the two years past. Before, as I walked about, either on my hunting,
or for viewing the country, the anguish of my soul at my condition
would break out upon me on a sudden, and my very heart would
die within me, to think of the woods, the mnuntains, the deserts I mu

ROBINSON ("SUEDE AND HIS FAMILY.
Icoonnt of my works this year as the first, yet in general it may be
observed that I was very seldom idle; but having regularly divided
my time, according to the several daily omployments that were before
me, such as, first, my duty to God, and the reading of the Scriptures,
which I constantly set apart some time for thrice every day ; second-
v, going abroad with my gun for food, which generally took me up
three hours every morning. when it did not rain; thirdly, ordering,
curing. preserving, and cooking what I had killod or catchcd for my
supply. These took up great part of the day; also, it is to be con-
sidered that in the middle of the day, when the sun was in the zenith,
the violence of the heat was too great to stir out, so that about four
hours in the evening was all the time I could be supposed to work in,
with this exception, that sometimes I changed my hours of hunting
and working, and went to work in the morning and abroad with my
gun in the afternoon.

To this short time allowed for labor I desire may be added the ex-
ceeding laboriousness of my work, the many hours which, for want of
tools. want of help, and want of skill, everything I did took up out of
my time; for example, I was full two-and--fiirty days making me a
board for a long shelf, which I wanted in my cave, whereas two saw-
yers, with their tools and a saw-pit, would have out six of them out
of the same tree in half a day.

My case was this : it was a large tree that was to be cut down, be-
cause my board was to boa broad one. This tree I was three dayl
cutting down, and two more in cutting off the bonghs and reducing it
to a log, or piece of timber. With inexpressihlc hacking and hewing
I reduced both the sides of it into chips till it was light- enough to
more; then I turned it, and made one side of it smooth and flat as a
board, from end to end; then, turning that side downward, cut the
other side till I brought the plank to be about three inches thick, and
smooth on both sides. Any one may judge the labor of my hands in
such a piece of work, but labor and patience carried me through that
and many other things ; I only observe this, in particular, to show the
reason why so much of my time went away with so little work, viz.,
that what might be a little to be done with help and tools, was a vast
.uhor,nnd required a prodigious time to do alone, and by hand. Not-
withstanding this, with patience and labor I went through many
things, and, indeed, everything that my circumstances made necss~
sary for me to do, as will appear by what follows.

I was now in the months of November and December, expecting
my crop of barley and rice. The ground I had mauured or dug up
for them was not great, for, as I observed, my seed of each was not
uhove the quantity of half a peek, having lost one whole crop by sow
ing in the dry season ; but now my crop promised very well, when on
a sudden I found 1 was in danger of losing it. all again by enemies of
several sorts, which it was scarce possible to keep from it; as, first,
the goats, and wild creatures which I called hares, who, tasting the
sweetness of the blade, lay in it night. and day as soon as it came up
and ate it so close that it could get. no time to shoot up into stalk.

I saw no remedy for this but by making an enclosure about it with
a hedge, which I did, with a great deal of toil, and the more because
it required speed. However: as my aral'le land was hut small, suited
to my crop, I got it- tolerably well fenced in :tlmttt three weeks' time;
and, shooting some of the creatures in the daytime, I set my dog to
guard it in the night, tying him up to a stake at the gate, where he
Would stand and bark all night. long, so in a little time the enemies
forsook the place, and the corn grew very strong and well, and began
to ripen apace.

luc as the Least: ruined me before. while my corn was in the blade,
so the birds were as likely to ruin me now, when it was in the ear,
for going along by the place to see how it thruvo, I saw my little crop
surrounded with fowls, I know not of how many sorts, who stood, as
it were, watching till I should be gone. I immediately let fly among
them (for I always had my gun with me.) : I had no sooner shot but
there rose up a little cloud of fuwls, which I had not seen at all, from
among the corn itself.

This touched me sensihly, for I fiwesaw that in a few days they
would devour all my hopes, that I should he starred, and never be
aide to raise a crop at all, and what to do I could not tell ; however,
I resolved not to lose my corn, if possible, though I should watch it.
night and day. In the first place, I went among it to see what. dam-
age was already done, and [hand they had spoiled a good deal of it,
but that, as it was yet too green for them, the loss was not so great
but that the remainder was likely to be a good crop, if it could be
saved.

I stayed by it to load my gun. and than coming away, I could easily
see the thieves sitting urnn all the trees about me, as if they only
waited till I was gone away. and the event proved it to be so, for as I
walked off, as if gone, I was no sooner out of their sight than they
dropped down, one by one, into he corn again. I was so provoked
thaLI could not have patience to stay till more came on, knowing
that every grain they ate now was, as it might be said, a peck loaf tn
me in the consequence, so coming up to the hedge I fired again and
killed three of them. This was what I wished for, so I took them up
and served them as we serve notorious thieves in England, Vik, hanged
them in chains, for terror to others. It is impossible to imagine that
this should have such an efii-ct as it had, for the t'owls not only never
came to the corn, but, in short, they forsook all that part of the island,
and ] could never see a bird near the place as long as my scarecrow:
hung there. This I was very glad of, you may he sure, and about the
latter end of December, which was our second harvest of the year, I
reaped my com.

I mix sadly put to it for a scythe or sickle to cut it down, and all I
could do was to make one as well as I could out of on." if the broad-
sworda or cullas Is, which I saved among the arms out of the ship.
However, as my first crop was but small, I had no great difficulty to
cut it down; in short, I reaped it my way, for I cut oil' nothing but
the ears, and carried it away in a great basket which I had made, and
so ruldwd it out with my hands; and at the end of all my harvesting,
1 finind that out of my half peek of seed 1 had near tn'o bushels of
rice, and above- two Inns-lads and a hall' of barley; that is to say, by
my gm 5. for I had no measure.

However, this was great encouragement to me, and l foresaw that,
in time, it would please God to supply me with bread; and yet, here
I was perplexed again, for .l neither knew how to grind nor make meal
ofmy corn, or indeed how to clean it and part it; nor, if made into
meal, how to make hread of it; and if ho v to make it. yet I knew not
how to bake it. These things being added to my desire of having a
good quantity for store, and to secure a constant supply,l resolved
not to taste any of this crop, but to preserve it all for seed against the
next season, and, in the meantime, to employ all my study and hours
of working to accomplish this great work of providing myself with
corn and bread.

It might be truly' said, now I worked for my bread. It is a little
wonderful, and what I believe few people have thought much upon,
viz, the strange multitude of little things necessary in the providing,
producing, curing, dressing, making, and finishing this one article of
bread. I, that was reduced to a more state of nature, found this to
my daily discouragement, and was made more sensible of it every
hour, even after I had got the first handful of seed-com, which, as]
have said, came up unexpectedly, nnd indeed to a surprise.

First, I had no plough to turn up the earth; no spade or shovel tc
dig it; well, this I conquered by making a. wooden spade, as I ob-
served before; but this did my work in but a wooden manner: and
though it cost me a. great. many days. to make it, yet, for want; of iron,
'3. not only wore out- sooner, but made my work the harder, and per.
l'ormed it much worse. However, this I bore with, and was content
to work it out, with patience, and bear with the hadness of the per-
l'ormance. When the corn was sown, I had no harrow, but was
forced to go over it myself, and drag a. great heavy how of a tree ore:
it, to scratch it, as it may be called, rather than rake or harrow it
\\ hen it was growing and grown, I have observed already how many
things I wanted to fence it, secure it, mow or 1'0in it, cure and carry
it home, thrash, part it from the chat}, and save it; then I wanted a
mill to grind it, ~sieves to dresx it, yeast and salt to make it into bread,
and an oven to bake it--nnd yet all these things I did without, as
shall be observed; and the corn was an inestiniable comfort and ad-
vantage to me; all this, as I said, made everything laborious and
tedious to me, but that there was no help for, neither was my time
so much loss to me, hecausc, as I had divided it, a certain part of it
was every day appointed to these works; and as Iresolved to use
none of the corn for bread till I had a greater quantity by me, I had
the next six months to apply myself wholly, by labor and invention,
to furnish myself with utensils proper for the performing all the
operations necessary for making corn lit for my use.

_L UT new I was to prepare more land, for I had seed enough
{5% to sow ahove an acre of ground. Before I did this, I had
PS4 " a week's work at least, to make me a spade ; which, when

w it was done, was but a sorry one, indeed, and very heavy,
and required double Iahor to work with it; however, I went through
Unit. and :50ch my seed in two large flat pieces of ground, as near
my house as I could find them to my mind, and fenced them in with
a good hedge, the stakes of which were all cut ofl'thnt wood whinh I
had set before, and knew it would grow; so that, in one year's time, I
knew I should have a quick or living hedge, that would want but
little repair. This work took me up full three months, because a
great part of the time was in the wet season, when I could not gononmsox extract. 111

abroad. Within doors, that is, when it rained, and I eculd not go out,
I found employment on the following occasions: always observing
that while I was at work, 1 diverted myself with talking to my pur-
rot. and teaching him to speak; and I quickly taught him to know
his own name, and at last- to speak it out pretty loud, Poll; which
was the first word I ever heard spoken in the island by any mouth
but my own. This, tlierehire, was not my work, but an assistant to
my work; for now, as I saith] bad a. great employment upon my
hands, as follows: I had long studied, by some means or other, to
make myself some eurtben vessels, which indeed I wanted much, but
knew not where to come at them ; however, considering the bent of
the climate, I did not doubt but i" could lind out any clay, I might
butch up some such pot as might, being dried in the sun, be hard and
strong enough to bear handling. and to hold anything that was dry,
and required to be kept so ; and us this was necessary in the prey>>
ring corn, meal, &e., which was the thing I was upon, I resolved to
make some as large as I could, and tit only to stand like jars, to bold
"but should be put into them.

It would make the reader pity me. or rather laugh at. me, to tell
how nwkvvard ways I took to raise this pastil ; what odd, misshapen,
ugly things I made; how many of them fell in, and how many fell
out, the clay not being stiil' enough to bear its own weight; how
many cracked by the over violent heat of the sun, being set out too
hastily, and. how many fell in pieces with only removing, as well be-
fore as after they were dried; and, in a word, how. after having la-
bored hard to find the clay, to digit, to temper it, to bring it. home,
and work it, I could not make above two large earthen ugly things
(I cannot call them jars) in about two months' labor.

However, as the sun baked these two very dry and hard, I lifted
them very gently up, and set them down again in two great wicker
baskets, which I had made on purpose for them, that they might not
break ; and as between the pot uud the basket there was a little room
to spare, I stuffed it full of the rice and barley straw ; and these two
pots being to stand always dry,I thought would hold my dry corn,
and perhaps the meal, when the corn was bruised.

Though I miscarried so much in my design for large pots, yet i
made scv ral snmller things with better success; such as little round
pots, flat dishes, and pipltins, and anything my hand turned to 5 and
the heat of the sun baked them very hard.

But all this would not answer my end, which was to get an earthen
pot to hold liquids, and bear the fire, which none of these could do
It happened some time after, making a pretty large tire for cooking
my meat, when I went to put it. out after I had done with it, I found
a broken piece of one of my earthenware vessels in the fire, burnt as
hard as a stone, and red as a tile. I was agreeably surprised to see
it; and said to myself, that certainly they might. be made to burn
whole, if they would burn broken.

This set me to study how to order my fire, so as to make it barn
some pots. I had no notion ofa kiln, such as the putters burn in, (r
ofglazing them with lead: though I had some lead to do it with; but
I placed three large pipkins and two or three puts in a pile, one upon
another, and placed my firewood all around it, with a great heap of
embers under them. I plied the tire with fresh final round the out-
side, and upon the top, till I saw the pots in the inside ret but quite
through, and observed that they did not. crack at all; when I saw
theta clear red, I let them stand in that heat about. fire or six hours,
till I found one of them (though it did not crack) did melt or run; for
the sand which was mixed with the clay melted by the violence of the
heat, and would have run into glass, if I had gone on; so I slakt-d
my fire gradually, till the pots began to abate of the red color; and
watching them all night, that I might not let the fine abate too fast,
in the morning I had three very good, I will not say handsome. pip-
leB, and two other earthen puts, as hard burnt as could he desired;
and one ot'them perfectly glazed with the running of the sand.

After this experiment, I need not say that-I wanted no sort, of earth
enware for my use ; but I must needs say, as to the shapes of them,
they were very indifi'erent, as any one may suppose, as I had no way
of making them but as the children make dirt pics, or as a woman
would make pics that never learned to raise paste. No joy at a thing
of so mean a nature was ever equal to mine, when I found I had mane
an earthen pot that. would hear the tire; and I had hardly patience
to stay till they were cold, before I set one on the tire again, with
same water in it, to boil me some meat, which it did admirably well;
and with a piece of a kid] made some very good broth; though l
Wanted oatmeal, and several other ingredients requisite to make it so
good as I would have had it been.

My next concern was to get a stone mortar to stamp or beat some
corn in it; for as to the mill, there was no thought of arriving to that
perfection of art with one pair of hands. To supply this want I was
at a great loss; for, of all trades in the world,I was perfectly unqual-
ified for a stone cutter as for any whatever: neither had 1 any tool!
to go about. it with. I spent many a day to find out a great stone big
enough to cut hollow, and make it fit for a mortar; but could find
none at all, except what was in the solid rock, and which I had no
way to dig or cut out; nor indeed, were the reeks in the island of wt?
fieient hardness, as they were all of a. sandy crumbling stone, which
would neither bear the weight of a heavy pestle, nor would break the
corn without filling it with sand; so, after a great deal of time lost in
searching for a stone, I gave it over, and resolved to look out a great
block of hard wood, which I found, indeed, much easier; and getting
one as big as I had strength to st.ir,l rounded it, and formed it on
the outside with my one and hatchet; and then, with the help of the
fire, and infinite labor, made a hollow place in it, as the Indians in
Brazil make their canoes. After this, I made a great heavy pestle, or
heater. of the wood, called iron-wood ; and this I prepared and laid
by against 1 had my next crop of corn, when I proposed to myself to
grind, or rather pound, my corn into meal, to make my bread.

My next difliculty was to makes. sieve, or search, to dress my meal,
and to part it from the bran and the husk, without which I did not
see it possible I could have any bread. This was a most difiicult
thing, even but to think on ; for I had notliinglikc the necessary thing
to make it; I mean fine thin canvas or stuff. to search the meal
through. Here I was at a full stop for many months ; nor did I really
know what to do; linen I had none left, but what was more rags; I
had goat's hair, but neither knew how to weave it not spin it; and
, A had I known how, here were no tools to work with; all the remedy I
"- found for this was, at last reoolleeting I had, among the scamen's

clothes, which were saved out of the ship, some neckeloths ofealico or

muslin; with some pieces of those I made three small sieves, proper

enough for the work; and thus I made shift for some years; how I

did afterward, I shall show in its place.

The baking part was the next thing to be considered, and how I
* should make bread when I came to have corn; for, first, I had no
yeast : as to that part, there was no supplying the want, so I did not
concern myself much about it; but for an even I was indeed puzzled.
At length I found out an expedient for that also ; which was this; I
made some earthen vessels, very broad, but no: deep, that is to saw,
about two feet diameter, and not above nine inches deep; tlicsol
burned in the fire, as I had done the other, and laid them by; and
when I wanted to bake, I made a great fire upon my hearth, which I
had pared with some square tiles of my own making and burning
also; but I should not call them square. When the firewood was
burned into embers, or live coals, I drew them forward upon the
hearth, so as to cover it. all over, and there let them lie till the hearth
was Very hut; then swet'ping away all the embers, I set. dmrn my
Inati or loaves, and covering thuni with the earthen put, drew the
embers all around the outside nf the pot, to keep in and add to the
heat; and thus, as "'0" as in the hest men in the wnrld, I halted my
barley Indies, and became, in a little time, a. good pastry-cook into the
bargain; for I made myself several Cilkl's and tinddings (if the rice:

nut without some more: wishes thatI was onshore thrrc;
flinging, that seeing the main land, and in inhabited country,I might
find some wuy or other to convey myself farther, and perhaps at Iul
find some means of escape.
But all this while I made no allowance for the dangers of such a
condition, and that I might fall into the hands of savages, and per.
haps such as I might have reason to think far worse than the lions
and tigers of Africa; that if I once came into their power, I should
run a hazard of more than a thousand to one of being killed, and per-
haps of being eaten; for I had heard that the people of the Carrillo.
an coast were cannibals, or man-eaters; and 1 know, hy the latitude,
that I could not be far 011' from that shore _; then Sttpl'tosing they were
not eannilxals, yet that they might kill me, as they had many Europe-
ans who had fallen into their hands, even when they have been ten or
twenty together; much more I, who \vaahnt (mo, and couidtnake little
or no defence: all these things, I my, which I ought to have consid-
ered well of, and did east up in my thoughts afterward, tool; up none
of my al'nprchensions at. first; yet my head ran mightily upon the
thought of getting over to the shore.

Now I wislu-d for my boy Xury, and the long-heat with the shoul-
der-oilinuttun sail, with which 1 sailed alzove a thousand miles on the
coast of Africa; hut thix was in vain ; tllt'u I thought- I would go and
look at our ship's boat. which, as I have said, was ldown up upon the
shore a great way, in the storm, when we were first east, away. She
lay nearly where the did at, first, but notquite; having turned, lay t':.c
force of the waves and the winds, almost ltottmn upward, against a
high ridge of beach); rough sand; but no water about her, as before.
If I had had hands to have refitted her, and to have launched her into
the water, the boat. would have done very well, and Intight have
gone back into the Brnzils with her easily enough; but. I might have
foreseen that I could no more turn her and set her upright. upon her
bottom. than I could remove the island : however, I went to the woods
and cut levers and rollers, and brought them to the heat. resolving to
"1" what I 00"" d0: suggesting to myself, that if I could but turn
her down. and repair the damage she had received, she would Le a
very good heat, and I might venture to sea in her.

I Spat-ed no pains, indeed. in this piece of fruitless toil, and spent,
I think, three Ut' four weeks about it: at last, finding it itnpnssihln to
heave her up with my little strength, I fell to digging away the sand,
to undermine her, and so as to make her fall down, setting pieces of
wood to thrust. and guide her right in the fall. lot when I had
done this,I was unable to stir her up again, or to get under her,
much less to move her forward toward the water; so I was forced
to give it over: and yet, though I gave over the hope of the boat. my
desire to venture over the main increased, rather than diminished, as
the means for it seemed impossible.
At length I hogan to think whether it was not: possible to make
myself a canoe, or periagua, such as the natives of these climates
make, even without. tools, or, as I might say, without; hands, of the
trunk of a great tree. This I not only thought possible, hut. easy, and
pleased myself extremely with the idea of making it, and with my
having much more convenience for it than any of the Negroes or
Indians; but. not. at all considering the particular inconveniences
which I lay under more than the Indians did, \i.'.., the want of hands
to move it: into the water when it was made, a dillieulty much harder
for me to surmount than all the eons 'Iueuc s of want of tools could
he to them: for what. could it all a ail me, if, after I had chosen my
tree, and with much trouble. cut it. down, and might lie alnle with my
tools to how and duh tlte outside into the proper shape ofa boat, and
burn or out the inside to make it hollow, so as to make a heat of it--
if, after all this, I must leave it just. where I found it, and was not
able to launch it into the water?

One would imagine, if I had the least reflection upon my uind of
my circumstances while I was making this hoagl should have im-
mediatcly thought; how I was to get. it into the sea: hut my thoughts
were so intent upon my voyage in it, that I never once considered
how I should get it, off lhe land; and it was really. in its own nature,
more easy for me to guide it over flirty-live miles of sea, than the
fortydive fathoms of land, where it lay, to set. it afloat in the water.

I went to work upon this boat the most. like a fool that ever man
did, who had any of his senses awake. I pleased myself with the
design, without determining whether I was ahle to undertake in; not.
but that the dillit'ulty of launching my boat. came often in my head;
but. I put a stop to my own inquiries into it, luy this foolish answer;
" Let. us first make it ; I warrant I will find some way or other to get
it along when it is done."

This was a most. preposterous method; but the eagerness of my
fancy prevailed, and to work I went. I felled a cedar tree, and I
question much whether Solomon ever had such a one for the building
of the Temple at Jerusalem; it, was live feet. ten inches diameter at
the lower part next. the stump, and four feet eleven inches diameter
at the end of twenty-two feet, where it lessened and then parted into
branches. It. was not without infinite labor that I felled this tree: I
was twenty (lays hacking and hewing at the bottom. and {inn-teen
more getting the branches and limbs, and the vast spreading head of
it, cut efl': after this. it cost me a month to shape is and dub it to a
proportion, and to something like the bottom of a boat, that. it mightnonrxsos CRUSOB. 123

swim upright as it ought to do. It cost me near three months more
to clear the inside, and work it not so as to make an exact boat of it:
this I did, indeed, without. fire, by more mallet and chisel, and by
the dint of hard labor, till I had brought it to be a. very hamhonre
pcriagua, and big enough to have carried six-and-twenty men, and
consequently big enough to have carried inc and all my cargo.

When I had gone through this work, I was extremely delighted
with it. The boat was really much bigger than ever I saw a canoe
or a pcriagua that was made of one tree, in my life. Many a weary
stroke it had cost, you may he sure ; and there remained nothing but
to get it. into the water; which, had I accomplished, I make no
question but 1 should have begun the llltldlltls't voyage, and the most
unlikely to he performed, that ever was undertaken.

But all my devices to get it into the water failed me; though they
cost me inexprcssible labor too. It lay about one hundred yards
from the. water, and not more; but the first. inConvenicnce was, it was
up hill toward the creek. Well, to talze away this discouragement,
Ire-solved to dig into the. sat face of the earth, and so make a (le-
elivity; this I began, and it cost me a prodigious deal of pains (but
who grudge pains that have their deliverance in flow '2) When this
was worked through, and this difficulty managed, it was still much
the same, for I could no more stir the canoe than I could the other
heat. Then I measured the distance of ground, and resolved to eat
a dock, or canal, to bring the water up to the canoe, seeing I could
not bring the canoe down to the water. "'0", I began this work;
and when I began to enter upon, and calculate how deep it was to be
dug, how broad, how the stuli' was to be thrown out, I found by
the number of hands I had, having none but my own, that it must
have been ten or twelve years before I could have gone through
with it; for the shore lay so high, that at the upper end it must have
been at least twenty feet deep; this attempt, though with great re-
luetancy, I was at length obliged to give over also.

This grieved me heartily; and now I saw, though too late, the
folly of beginning a work before we count the COt-t, and before we
judge rightly of 'our own strength to go through with it.

In the middle of this work. I finished my fourth year in this place,
and kept: my anniversary with the same devotion, and with as much
comfort as before; for, by a constant study and serious ariplication
to the word of God, and by the assistance of his grace, I gained a
different knowledge frOm what I had before; I entertained different
notions of things; I looked upon the world as a thing remote, which
I had nothing to do with, no expectation from, and, indeed. no desire;
about; in n. word, I had nothing:' to do with it, nor was ever likely to
have; I thought it looked us we may perhaps look upon it hereafter,
viz., as a. place I had lived in, but was come out of it; end well
might I say, as Father Abraham to Divex, "Between me and thee is
n great gulf fixed."

In the first place, I was here removed from all the wickedness of
the world; I had neither the lust of the flush, the lust of the eye, nor
the pride of life. I had nothing to covet, for I had all that I was
now capable of enjoying; I was lord of the whole manor; or il'I
pleased, I might call myself king or emperor over the whole country
which I had possession of; there were no rivals; I had no competitor,
none to diy'pnto sovereignty or command with me: I might have
raised ship--loadings of corn, but I had no use for it: w I let n5 little
grow as I thought enough for my occusiou. I had tortoise or turtle
enough. but new and then one was as much as I could put to any
use. I had timber enough to have built- a iloct of ships; and I had
graperx enough to have made wine, or to hme cured into raisins, to
have loaded thn'. lleet when it hnd been built.

Butoll I could make usoof was all that was valuable; Ihnd enough
to 0.1: and supply my wnnts,nnd wlmt was the rest. to Inc? I" killed
more flesh than I could cut the dog mus't ens. it, or vermin; ifI sowed
more com than I could eat, it must be spoiled; the trees that I cut
down were lying to rot on the ground ; I could make no use of them
than for fuel, and that I had no other occasion for but to dress my
food.

In a. word, the nature and experience of things dicta.th to me, upon
just reflection, that all the good things of this world ore of no further
good to us than for our use, and that whatever we may help up to
give othern, we enjoy only as much as we can use, and no more. The
most coretons gripiug miscr in the world would hurt: been cured of
the vice of covetonsness, if he hnd harm in my case, for I po. .md in-
finitely more tlun I knew what to do with. I had no room for de--
sire, except it was for things which I had not, and they were compar-
atively b'" "m": though indeed of great use to me. I lmel, as I
Milled before, 3 parcel of moon: :1: well gold on silver, about thirty-
SIX pounds 55"""2. Alas! there the nnxtm snrrv, "wives stufi' lay 2 I
hzld no manner of business for it, and I often thought. within myself
that I would have given A handful ofit I'm- a gross of tnhacr-o pipes,
or for a hand-mill to grind my corn: nay, I would have given it all
for n sixpenny worth of turnip and carrot seed from England, or for
nhnndful of peas and beans and a bottle of ink. As it was, I had
not the least advantage by it, or benefit from it, but there it lay in a.
drawer, and grew mouldy with the (lamp of the cave in the wet sen-
sons; and il'I had had the drawer full of diamonds, it had been the
some case; they would have been of no manner of value to me, be-
cause of no use.

I hztd now brought my state of life to be much more comfortable in]
itself than it was at first, and much easier to my mind '\S well 118 to
m) body I frequently sat down to meat nith thankfulness, nnd ad-
mired the hand of God's providence, which hztd thus spread my table
in the wilderness, I learned to look more upon the bright side oftny
condition, and less upon the dark side, and to consider what I enjoyed
rather than what I wanted ; und this gave me, sometimes, such secret
comforts that I eztnnot express them, and which I Luke notice of here,
to put these discontented people in mind of it who cannot enjoy com-
fortably what- God has given them, because they see nnd covet some.
thing thztt he has not given them. All our diseontentsnhout what we
want appeared to me to spring from the want of thankfulness for what
we have.

Another reflection was of grant use to me. and doubtless would be
so to any one that should full into such distress as mine was; and thin
\\'ns,to compare my present condition with what I at first expected it
would he, nay, with what it would certainly have been, if the good
providence of God bud not wonderfully ordered the ship to be cost up
near the shore, where I not only could come at her, but could bring
what I got out of her to the shore, for my relief and comfort : without
which, I wanted for tools to work, weapons for defence, and gunpow-
der and shot for getting my food.

I spent whole hours, I may say whole days, in representing to my-
self, in the most lively colors, how I must have noted if I had got
nothing out of the ship. I could not have so much as got any food,
except fish and turtles, and that, as it was long before I found any of
them, I must have perished; that I should have lived, if I had not
perished, like a mere savage; that if I had killed a goat or n fowl, by
any eontrivance,l lutd no way to flay or open it, or part the flesh from
the shin nnd the bowels, or to cut it up, but must gnaw it with my
teeth and pull it with my claws, like a beast.

These reflections made me very sensible of the goodness of Provi-
dence to me, and very thankful for my present condition, with all its
hardships and misfortunes. And this part, also, I cannot but racem-
mend to the reflection of those who are apt, in their misery,te say,
"1:; any affliction like mine 2" Let. them consider how much worse
the cams of some people. are, and their case might have been,if Provi-
dcnre had thought lit.

I had another reflection, which assisted me also to comfort my mind
with hopes, and this was, comparing my present condition with what
I had deserved. and had, therefore, reason to expect from the hand of
Providence. I had lived a dreadful life, perfectly destitute of "10
knowledge and fear of (ind. I had been well instructed by my father
and mother: neither had they heen wanting to me in their endeavors
to infuse. an early religious awe of God into my mind, a sense. of my
duty, and what. the. ualu 'o and end army being required ol'tue. lint,
alaza! fallingr early into the. seafaring life, whit-hot" all lives is the most.
destitute. <<.l' the f-ar of (ind, though hix terrors are. always before
them: I say, falling early into the seafaring life, and into seatitring
company, all that liztlo sense. of religion "'lllt'll I had entertained was
laughed out of we lay my tncssmates, hy a hardened despising ol' dan-
gers, and the down of death, which grew habitual to me ; lay my long
ahsence from all manner of opportunities to converse with anything
but what, was She myself, or to hea' anything that. waa good, or lend-
ing toward it.

So void was I (if everything that was good, or ofthe least sense. of
what. I was, or was to he, that in the greatest delirc 'auers I enjoyed
(such as my escape from Saline, my lacing taken up hy the Portuguese
master of a ship. my icing planted to well in the lirazils, my receiv-
ing the cargo from England, and the. like), I never had once the words
"thank ('md I" So much as on my mind or in my mouth; nor in the
greatest distress had I so mnca as a thought to pray to hint, or so
much as to say " Lord, have mercy upon me l" No, nor to mention
the name of (ind, unless it was to swear hy and hlasphetne it.

I had terrihln reflections upon my mind for many tnonthsma I have
already observed, on account of my wicked and hardened life past,
and wheal looked about me and considered what particular provi-
dences had attended me since my coming into this place, and how
God had dealt>> lmunti.'ully with lac--had not only puninhed me less
than my iniquity had deserved, hut. had so plentifully provided for
me; this gave me great hopes that my repentance was accepted, and
that God had yet llK'l't'll'S in store for me.

\ 'itlt these, reEh-rtic us I worked my mind up, not only to a resigna.
tion to the will of God in the present disposition of my eiretunstaneen,
but even to a sincere lltankl'ulncas for my condition, and that I, who
was yet. a living man, ought not to complain, seeing I had not the due
punishment of my site ; that I enjoyed so many mercies which I had
no reason to have expected in that place, that I ought never more to
repino at my condition, but to rejoice, and to give daily thanks for
that drily bread which nothing but u. crowd of wonders could have
brought; that I ought to consider I had been fed by a miracle, even
as great. its that of feeding Elijah by ravens; nay, by u long series 0!
mimclcs, and that I could hardly have named it place in the unin-
huhitalrlc part of the world where I could have been cost more to my
advantage: n place where, as I had no society, which was my nfllio--
tinn on one hand. so I found no ravenous beasts, no furious wolves or
ti get-s to threater my life ; no venomous or poisonous creatures, which
I might feed on to my hurt; no ravages to murder ttnd devour me. In
a word, as my life was a life of sorrow one way, so it was B life of
mercy another, and I wanted nothing to make it a life of comfort but
to make myself sensible of (iod'u goodness to me, and care over me in
this condition _: and after I did make u. just improvement of these
things I "cut away, and was no more Had.

I had now been here so long that many things which I brought on
shore for my help were either quite gone or very much wasted, and
near spent.

M y ink, as I obhcrved, had been gone for some time, all but a very
little, which I ckcd out with water, a. little and a little, till it was so
pale it scarce left any appearance of black upon the paper. As long
as it lasted 1 made use of it to minute down the days of the month on
which any remarkable thing happened to me; and, first, by casting
up times past, I remember that there was a strange concurrence of
days in the various provident-cu which hefell me. and which, if I had
been superstitiously inclined to observe days as fatal or fortunate, I
might have had reason to have looked upon with a great deal of eu-
riosity.

First, I had observed that the some day that I broke away from my
father and my friends, and ran away to Hell, in order to go to sea, the
same day afterward I was taken by the Sullee man-of-war and made a
:lare; the same day of the year that I escaped out of the wreck of
ihe ship in Yarmouth Roads, that same day, years afterward, I made
my escape from Sallee in the boat; and the same day of the your I was
born on, viz., the 30th of September, that same day I had my life so
miraculously saved, twenty-six years after, when I was cast on shore
in this island--so that my wicked life and my solitary life began both
on one day.

The next thing to my ink being wasted, was that of my bread, I
mean the his :uit which I brought out of the ship; this I had hue
bonded to the lust degree, allowing myself but one cake ot'brend a
day for above a. year; and yctI was quite without bread for near a
your before I got any corn of my own; and great rcnson I had to be
thankful that 1 had any at all, the getting it being, as has been 8.]
ready observed, next to miraculous.

My clothes, too, begun, to decay mightily , as to linen, I had none
for it great while, except some checkered shirts which I found in too
chests of the other seamen, and which I carefully preserved, because
many times I could hear no clothes on hot a shirt; and it wus a very
great help to me that 1 had. among all the men's clot-hes of the ship,
almost three dozen of shirts. There were also, indeed, several thick
watchcoats of the seomeu's which were left, but they were too hot to
wear; and though it is true that. the weather was so violently hot
that there was no need of clothes, yet I could not go quite naked--no,
though I had been inclined to it, which I was not, nor could I abide
the thought ofit, though I was all nlooc. The reason why 1 could
not go quite naked was. I could not. hear the heat of the sun so well
when quite naked as with some clothes on; uny, the very heut fre-
quently blistered my skin; whereas, with (t shirt on, the air itself
made some motion, nnd whistling under the shirt. was two-fold cooler
than without it. No more could I ever bring myself to go out in line
heat of the sun without a cap or hut; the heat ot'the sun hunting
with such violence as it does in thnt- place, would give me the head-
ache presently, by darting so directly upon my head, without a. cup or
a hat on, so that I could not hear it; whereas, if] put on my hot, it
would presently go away.

Upon these views, I began to consider about putting the few rags
I had, which I called clothes, into some order. I had worn out all
the wnisteonts I had, uud my business was now to try ifI could not
make jackets out of the great watohconts that I had by me, and with
adult other materials us I hnd ; so I set to work a tniloring, or rnther,
indeedr u bombing, for I made most piteous work of it. However I
made shift to make two or three new woistcouts, which I hoped would
serve me a great while; as for brooches, or drawers] made but a
very sorry shift indeed, till afterward.

I have mentioned that I saved the skins of all the creatures that I
killed. I mean four-flioted ones; and I had hung them up, stretched
out with sticks, in the sun, by which moons some of them were so dry
and hard that they were fit for little, but others I found very useful
The first thing I made of these was It greet cap for my head, with the
hair on the outside, to shoot of the rain ; and this I performed so well1
that after this I made me a suit of clothes wholly of the skins, that it
to any, n waistcoat, and brooches, open at the knees, and both loose,
for they were rather wanting to keep me cool than warm. I must
not- omit to acknowledge that they were wretchedly made; for "'1
was a bad carpenter, l wns n. worse tailor. However, they were such
ur- I made very good shift with ; and when I was abroad, if it hap-
(-ened to rain, the hair of my waistcoat and cap being uppermost,l
was kept very dry.

After this,l spent a great deal of time and pains to make me an
unbrelln; I was indeed in great want of one, and had a great mind
to make one; I had seen them made in tho Brazils, where they were
very useful in the great heats which are there; and I felt the heat
every jot as great here, and greater too, being nearer the equinox;
besides. as I was obliged to be much abroad, it was a most useful
thing to me, as well for the rains as the boots. I took a world of
pains at it, and was 11 great while heforeI could make anything likely
to hold; nay, after I thought I had hit- the way, I spoiled two or three
before I made one to my mind; but at last made one that answered
indifl'crcntly well ; the main difficulty I found was to make it to let
down : I could make it spread, but if it did not let down too, and draw
in, it was not portable for inc any way but just over my head, which
would not do. However, at last, as I said, l made one to answer, and
covered it with skins, the hair upward, so that it cast off the rain
like a pent-house, and kept oll' the sun so effectually, that I could
walk out in the hottest of the weather with greater advantage than I
could before in the coolest ; and when I had no need of it, could close
it and carry it under my arm.

Thus I lived mighty comfortably, my mind being entirely composed
by resigning to the will of God, and throwing myself wholly upon the
disposal of his providence. This made my life better than sociable;
for when I began to regret the want of conversation, I would ask my.
self, whether thus conversing mutually with my own thoughts, and,"
I hope I may say, with even God himself, by ejaculations, was not
letter than the utmost enjoyment of human society in the world!

wide, und four feet deep. I brought it into the creek, almost half a
mile. As for the first, which was so vastly hig, an I made it without
considering beforehand, as] ought to do, how I should be able to
Ianurh it, so, never being :ible lu bring it into the water, or bring; the
water to it, I was obliged to let it lie where it \\'as,:|zA a memorandum
to touch mo to be wiser the next time _: indeed, the next time, though
I could not got a tree proper for it, and was in :1. plucc where i could
not get the water to it at any less distance than, as I have said, near
hull'a mile. yet as I saw it was practicable at last, I never gave it
over: and though I was near two years almut. it, yet I never grudgcd
my labor, in hopes of having a boat to go 08' to sea at last.

However, though my little periagua was finished, yet the size ofit
was not at all answerable to the design which I had in view when I
made the first; 1 mean of venturing over to the (cra'nfirma, where it
was above forty miles hroad; accordingly, the smallness of my boat
assisted to put an end to that design, and now I thought no more of
it. As l had a bout. my next. design was to make a cruise round the
island; for as I had been on the other side in one place, crossing, as
l have. already desoribed it, over the land, so the discoveries I made
in that liltlcjourncy made me very eager to see other parts of the
coast: and now I had a boat, I thought of not-hing but sailing round
the island.

For this purpose, that I might do everything with discretion and
consideration, I fitted up 9. little must in my boat1 and made a sail to
it. out of some of the pieces of the ship's sails which lay in store, and
of which I had a. great stock by me. Having fitted my mast and sail
and tried the boat,I found she would sail very well; then I made
little lockers, or boxes. at each end of my boat, to put provisions, ne-
cessaries, ammunition, &c., into, to be kept dry, either from rain or
the spray of the sea. ; and a little long hollow place I cut in the inside
of the boat, where I could lay my gun, making a flap to hang down
over it, to keep it dry.

I fixed my umbrella also in a step at the stern, like a mast, to stand
over my head, and keep the heat of the sun of me, like an awning;
and thus every now and then took a little voyage upon the see, but
never went far out, nor for from the little creek. Atlast, being eager
to view the circumference of my little kingdom, I resolved upon my
cruise; and accordingly, I victunlcd my ship for the voyage, putting
in two dozen of loaves (cakes I should rather call them) of barley
bread, on earthen pot full of parched rice (3 food I ate a great deal
of), a little bottle of rum, half a goat, and powder and shot for kill-
ing more, and two large watcheoats, of those which, as I mentioned
before, I had saved out of the seamen's chests ; these I took, one to
lie upon, and the other to cover me in the night.

lt was the sixth of November, in the sixth year of my reign, or my
captivity, which you please, that I set out on this voyage, and I found
it much longer than I expected; for though the island itself was not
very large, yet when I came to the east side of it, I found a. great
ledge of rocks lie about two leagues into the see, some above water.
some under it; and beyond that a shoal of sand, lying dry, half a
league more, so that I was obliged to go a great way out to sea to
double the point

When first I discovered them, I was going to give over my enterprise,
and come back again, not knowing how far it might oblige me to put
out to sea, and above all, doubting how I should get back again; so
I came to an anchor; for. I had made me a kind of anchor with a
piece of a broken grappling which I got out of the ship.

Having secured my boat, I took my gun and went on shore, climb-
ing up on a hill, which seemed to overlook that point where I saw the
full extent of it, and resolved to venture.

In my viewing the sea. from that hill where I stood, I perceived a
strong, and, indeed. a most furious current, which ran to the east, and
even came close to the point; and I took the more notice of it, be-
cause I saw there might be some danger that, when I came into it, I
might be carried out to sea by the strength of it, and not be able to
make the island again; and, indeed, had I not get first upon this hilL132 "wen-ones or

I believe it would have been so; for there was the some current on
the other side the island, only that it set oil at a further distance, and
I saw there was a strong eddy under the shore ; so I had nothing to
do but get out of the first current, and I should presently be in an
eddy.

I lay here, however, two days because the wind blowing pretty
Il'Cell at E. S. E.,and that being just. contrary to the said current, made

great breach of the sea upon the point; so that it was not. safe for
me to keep too close to the shore, fur the breach, nor to go too far 011',
because of the stream.

The third day, in the morning, the wind having abated over night,
the sea \\ as calm, and I ventured; but I am a. warning-piece again to
all rash and ignorant pilots; for no sooner was I come to the point,
when I was not even my luaat's length from the shorc,hut I found my-
self in a great depth of water, and a current like the sluice of a mill;
I' carried my boat along with it with such violence, that. all I could
do could not keep her so much as on the edge of it: but I found it
hurried mo further and further out from the eddy, which was on my
left hand. There was no wind stirring to help me, and all I could do
with my paddles signified nothing; and now I began to give myself
orcrl'or lost; for as the current was on hoth sides of the island,I
knew in a few leagues' distance they must- join again, and then I was
irreeoverably gone; nor did I see any possihility of avoiding it; so
that I had no prospect- luefnre me hut of porishingmot by the sea, for
that. was calm enough. hut (:f shining For hunger. I had, indeed,
found a tortoise on the blame, as lxig, alnurt. as I could lift, and had toss
ed it into the boat; and I had a great jar of fresh water,that in to say,
one of my earthen pots; hut what was all this to being driven into
the vast ocean, where, to he sure. there was no shore, no main land or
island, for a thousand leagues at. least?

And now I saw how easy it was for the providence of God to make
even the most miserable condition of mankind worse. Now I looked
hack upon my desolate, solitary ialand as the most pleasant place in
the World : and all the happiness my heart could wish for was to be
there again. I Stretched out my hands to it, with eager wishes: "O
ll"111|_\l'tl('SflI'Il" said I, "I shall never see thee more. 0 miserable
"mature! whither am I going!" Then I reproaehcd myself with my
unthankful temper, and how I had repiued at my solitary condition;
and now what wouldl give to be on shore there again! This we
never see the true state of Our condition till it is illustrated to us by
its contraries. nor know how to value what we enjoy,but by the want
cf it. It is scarce possible to imagine the consternation! was new in.
being driven from my beloved island (for so it appeared to me now to
be) into the wide ocean, almost two leagues, and in the utmost despair
of ever recovering it again. However, I worked hard, till indeed my
strength was almost exhausted, and kept my boat as much to the
northward, that is, toward the side of the current which the eddy
lay on, as possibly I could; when about noon, as the sun passed the
meridian, I thought I felt a little breeze of wind in my face, springing
up from S S. E. This cheered my heart alittle, and especially when
in about half an hour more, it blew a pretty gentle gale. By this
time I got a frightful distance from the island, and had the least
cloudy or hazy weather intervened, I had been undone another way
too; for I had no compass on hoard, and should never have known
how to have steered toward the island, if I had but once 10st sight
of it ; but the weather continuing clear, I applied myself to get up
my mast again, and spread my sail, standing away to the north as
much as possible, to get out of the current.

Just as I had set my mast and sail, and the boat began to stretch
away, I saw, even by the clearness of the water some alteration of
the current was near ; for where the current was so strong, the water
was foul; but perceiving the water clear, I found the current abate ;
and presently I found to the east, at about half a mile, a breach of
the sea upon some rocks; these rocks, I found, caused the current to
part again, and as the main stress of it ran away more southerly,
leaving the rocks to the northeast, so the other returned by the repulse
of the rocks, and made a strong eddy, which ran back again to the
northwest, with a. very sharp stream.

They who know what it is to have arepriet'e brought to them upon
the ladder, or to be rescued from thieves just going to murder them,
or who have been in such-like extremities, may guess what my pres-
ent surprise of joy was, and how gladly I put my boat into the stream
of this eddy; and the wind also freshening, how gladly I spread my
sail to it, running cheerfully before the wind, and with a strong tide
or eddy under foot.

This eddy carried me about a league in my way back again, di
rectly toward the island, but about two leagues more to the north
ward than the current which carried me away at first; so that when
I came near the island, I found myself open to the northern shore of
it, that is to say, the other end of the island, opposite to that which
I went out from.

When I had made something more than a league of way, by the184 ADVENTL' ans 0)

help of this current or eddy, I found it was spent, and served me no
further. However, 1 found that being bet" een two great currents,
viz, that on the south side, which had hurried me away, and that on
the north, which lay about a league on the other side: I sa ,between
these two, in the wake of the island, I found the water at. least still
and running no way; and having still a breeze of wind fair to me, I
kept on steering directly for the island, though not making Such fresh
Way as I did before.

About four oielock in the evening, being then within a league of
tho islnnl, I found the point of the rocks which occasioned this disas-
ter stretching out, as is described before, to the southward, and cast-
iug 05' the current more southerly, had, of course, made another eddy
to the north; and this I found very strong. but not directly setting
the way my course lay, which was due west, but almost full north.
llowever, having a fresh gale, I stretched across this eddy, slanting
northwest; and, in about an hour, came within about a mile of the
shore, where, it being smooth, I soon got to land.

When I was on shore, I fell on my knees, and gave God thanks for
my deliverance, resolving to lay aside all thoughts of my deliverance
by my boat; and refreshing myself with such things as I had, I
brought my boat close to the shore, in a little core that I had spied
under some trees, and laid me down to sleep, being quite spent with
the labor and fatigue of the voyage.

I was now at a great loss which way to get home with my boat: I
had run so much hazard, and knew too much of the case, to think of
attempting it by the way I went out; and what might be at the other
side (I mean the west side) I knew not, nor had I any mind to run any
more ventures; so I only resolved in the morning to make my way
westward along the shore. and see .if there was no creek wherel
might lay up my frigate in safety, so as to have her again, if I wanted
her. In about. three miles, or thereahout, coasting the shore, I came
to a very good inlet or hay, about a mile over, which narrowed till it
came to a very little rivulet or brook, where I found a. very con-
venient harbor for my boat, and where she lay as if she had been in a
little dock made on purpose for her. Here I put- in, and having
stowed my hoat very safe, I went on shore, to look about me, and see
where I was.

I soon found I had but a little passed by the place where I had
been before when I travelled on foot to that shore ; so taking nothing
out ofmy boat but my gun and umbrella, for it was exceeding hot, I
began my march. The way was comfortable enough after such I
voyage as I had been upon. and I reached my old bower in the even-
ing, where 1 found everything standing as I had left it; for I always
kept it in good order, being, as I said before, my country house.

I got over the fence, and laid me down in the shade to, rest my
limbs, for I was very weary, and fell asleep ; but judge you, if you can
that read my story, what a surprise I must be in, when I was awaked
out of my sleep by a. voice, calling me by my name several times:
" Robin, Robin, Robin Crusoe--poor Robin Crusoe! Where are you.
Robin Crusoe l--where are you 2 Where have you been I"

l was so dead asleep at first, being fatigued with rowing, or pad-
dling, as it is called, the first port of the day, and with walking the
latter part, that I did not wake thoroughly; but dozing between
Ileeping and waking, thought I dreamed that somebody spoke to me;
but. as the voice continued to repeat "Robin Crusoe, Robin Crusoe,"
at last I began to awake more perfectly, and was at first dreadfully
frightened, and started up in the utmost consternation ; but no sooner
were my eyes open. but I saw my I'oll sitting on the top of the hedge,
and immediately knew that it was he that spoke to me; for just in
such lie-moaning language I had used to talk to him, and teach him;
and he had learned it so perfectly, that he would sit upon my finger
and lay his bill close to my face, and cry, " Poor Robin Crusoe,
where are you 3--where have you been! Ilow come you here I" and
such things as I had taught him.

However, even though I knew it was a parrot, and that indeed it
could be nobody else= it was a good while before I could compose my-
self. First,l was amazed how the creature got thither; and then how
he should just keep about the place, and nowhere else ; but as I was
well satisfied it could be nobody but honest- Poll, I got. over it; and,
holding out my hand, and calling him by his name, Poll, the sociable
creature came to me, and sat upon my thumb, as he used to do, and
continued talking to me " Poor Robin Crusoe !" and how did I come
here? and where had I been i just as if he had been overjoyed to see
me again ; and so I carried him home along with me.

I now had enough of rambling to sea. for some time, and had enough
to do for many days to sit still, and to reflect upon the danger I had
been in. I would have been very glad to bare had my boat again on
my side of the island; but I knew not how it was practicable to get
it about. As to the east side of the island, which I had gone round,
I know well enough there was no venturing that way; my very
heart would shrink, and my very blood run chill, but to think of it;
and as to the other side of the island, I did not know how it might be
there; but supposing the current ran with the same force against. the
shore at the east as it passed by it on the other, 1 might run the some
risk of being driven down the stream, and curried by the island, as I
had been before of being carried awny from it. 3 so, with these
thoughts,I contented myself to be without any boat, though it had
been the product of so many months' labor to make it, end of so many
more to get it. into the sen.

In this government. of my temper I remained near a. your, lived a
very sednte, retired life, no you may well suppose ; and my thoughts
being very much composed, no to my condition, and fully comforted
in resigning myself to zize dispositions of Providence,l thought. I
lived really hnppily in all things except that of society.

I improved myself in this time in all the mechanic exercises which
my necessities put me upon applying myself to; and I believe I
could upon occasion, have made a very good carpenter, especially
considering how few tools I had.

Besides this, I arrived at. an unexpected perfection in '.ny earthen-
ware, and contrived well enough to make them with a. wheel, which
I found infinitely easier and bet-tor ; because I made things round nnd
shnpenhle, which before were filthy things imiecd to look upon. But
I think I wusnever more rain of my own performance, or more joyful
for anything I found out, than for my being able to mnko ll tobac'co'
pipe; and though it was a very ugly clumsy thing when it Wits done,
nod only burned red, like other earthenware, yet- ns it was hard and
firm, and would draw the smoke, I was exceedingly comfort-ed with
it, for 1 had been always used to smoke ; and there were pipes in the
ship, but I forgot them at first, not thinking that there was tobacco in
the island: and afterward, when I searched the ship again, I could
not come at any pipes at all.

In my wicker were also I improved much, and made abundance of
necessary baskets, as well as my invention showed me ; though not
very handsome, yet they were such as were very handy and con-
venient for my laying things up in, or fetching things home. For ex-
ample, ifl killed it gout abroad, I could hang it. up in a. tree, flay it,
dress it, and cut it in pieces, and bring it home in a basket; and like
by n. turtle: I could cut it up, take out the eggs, and a. piece or two
of the flesh, which was enough for me, and bring them home in a
basket, and leave the rest behind me. Also large deep baskets for
the receivers of my corn, which I always rubbed out assoon us it was
dry,snd cured, and kept it in great baskets.

Ibegan now to perceive my powder abated considerably; this wasmmox cnunoz. 13'!

I wont which it was impossible for me to supply, and I began sari
ously to consider what I must do when I should have no more pow
tier-that, is to say, how I should do to kill any goals. I had, as i!
observed, in the third year of my being here, kept a young kid, and
bred her up tame, and I was in hopes of getting it lie-gout; but)
could Lothy any means bring it to pose, till my kid grow an old goat;
uud as I could never find it in my heart to kill her, she died at lost
of more ago.

. BIN G now in the eleventh year of my residence, and as I
have said, my ammunition growing low, I set myself to
study some art to trap and stun-e the goats, to see whether
I could not catch some of them alive ; and partieulnrly,.l
wanted It she-goat great with young. Fox-this pnrposcfl made snore!
to hnmpor them ; and I do believe they were more than once taken in
them: hut my tuoklo was not good, for I had no wire, and I nlwnya
found them broken, and my hail: devoured. At length I resolved to
try it pitfall: so I dug several large pits in the earth, in places where
I had observed the gontu used to food, and over those pits I placed
hurdles, of my own making. too,with a great weight upon them; and
several times I put ears of barley and dry rice, without setting the
trup ; lllld I oould easily perceive that the goats had gone in and eaten
up the corn, for I could see the marks of their feet. At length I set
three traps in one night, and going the next morning, I found them
all standing, and yet the hair. eaten and gone. This was very dio-
cournging: however, I altered my traps ; and, not to trouble you
with particulars. going one morning to see my traps, I found in one
of them a large old he-gont, and in one of the others three kids, a
male and two females.

As to the old one,I know not what to do with him; he was so
fierce, l dumt not go into the pit to him ; that is to any, to go about
to bring him away alive, which was what I wanted. I could have
killed him, but that was not my business, nor would it answer my
and ; so I even let him out, and he run away, as if he had been
[lightened out of his wits. But I had forgot then, whntl hod lent-nee
afterward, that hunger will tame a. lion. If I had let him stay there
three or four days without food, and then have carried him some water
to drink, and then a. little corn, he would have been as tnme as one
of the kids ; for they are a mighty sagacious. tractable creature
where they are well used. llowercr, for the present I let him go,
knowing no better at that time: then I went to the three kids, and
taking them one by one, I tied them with strings together, and with
some dillieulty brought them all home.

It was a good while before they would feed: l'ut throwing them
some sweet corn, it tempted them, and they began to be tame. And
nowI found that if I expected to supply myself with goat's flesh,
when I had no powder or shot loft, breeding some up tame was my
only way; when, perhaps, I might have them about my house like a
flock of sheep. But then it occurred to me, that. I must keep the
tame from the wild, or else they would always run wild when they
grew up; and the only way for this was, to have some enclosed piece
of ground, well fenced, either with hedge or pale, to keep them in so
ofl'cctuully, that those within might not break out, or those without
break in.

This was a. great undertaking for one pair of hands; yet as I saw
there was an absolute necessity for doing it, my first work was to find
out a proper piece of ground, where there was likely to he herbage
for them to eat, water for them to drink, and cover to keep them from
the sun.

Those who understand such enclosures will think 1 had very little
contrivauee, whenI pitched upon a place very proper for all these
(being it plain open piece of meadow land or sarnnnah, as our people
call it in the western colonies), which had two or three little rills
of fresh water in it, and at one end was very woody; I say, they will
smile at my forecast, when I shall tell them, I began my enclosing
this piece of ground in such a manner, that my hedge or pale must
have been at least two miles about. Nor was the madness of it so
great as to the compass, for if it was ten miles about, I was likely to
have time enough to do it in; but I did not consider that my goats
would he as wild in so much compass as if they had had the whole
island, and I should have so much room to chase them in, that I
should never catch them.

Mv hedge was begun and carried on. I believe about fifty yards.
when this thought occurred to me: so I presently stopped short, and,
for the first bcginn'mg, I resolved to enclose a piece of about one
hundred and fifty yards in length, and one hundred yards in breadth
which, as it would maintain as many as I should have in any reason
able time, so, as my stock increased, I could add more ground to my
enclosure.

This was acting with some prudence, and I went to work with
courage. l was about three months hedging in the first piece; and,
till I had done it, 1 tethered the three kids in the best part ol'it, and used
them to feed as near me as possible, to make them familiar; and very
often l would go and carry them some ears of barley, or a handful
of rice, and feed them out of my hand; so that after my enclosure
was finished, and 1 let them loose, they would follow me up and
down, bloating after me for a handful of com.

This answered my end; and in about a year and a half I had a
flock of about twelve goats, kids and all; and in two years more, I
had tlxmo-and-fin-ty, besides several that I took and killed for my
food. After that l enclosed five several pieces of ground to feed
them in, with little pens to drive them in, to take them as I wanted,
and gates out of one piece of ground into another.

But this was not all; for new I not only had goat's flesh to feed on
when I pleased, but milk too; a thing which, indeed, in the begin.
ning, 1 did not so much us think of, and which, when it came into my
thoughts, was really an agreeable surprise; for now I set up my
dairy, and had sometimes a gallon or two of milk in a day. And as
Nature, who gives supplies of food to every creature, dictates even
naturally how to make use of it, so I, that had never milked a cow,
much less a goat, or seen butter or cheese made, only when I was a
boy, after a great many essays and miscarriages, made me both but-
ter and cheese at last, and also salt (though I found it partly made to
my hand by the heat of the sun upon some of the rocks of the sea),
and never wanted it afterward. llow mercifully can our Creator
treat his creatures, even in those conditions in which they seemed to
be overwhelmed in destruction! Ilow can he sweeten the hitterc-st
providences, and give us cause to praise him for dungeons and
prisons! What. a table was here spread for me in a wilderness
where I saw nothing, at first, but to perish for hunger!

It would have made a stoic smile to have seen me and my little
family sit down to dinner. There was my majesty, the prince and
lord of the whole island; I had the lives of all of my subjects at my
absolute command; I could hang, draw, girc liberty, and take it
away: and no rebels among all my subjects.

Then to see how like a king l dined, too, all alone, attended by my
servants: Poll, as if he had been my favorite, was the only person
permitted to talk to me. My dog, who was now grown very old and
crazy, and had found no species to multiply his kind upon, sat always
at my right hand; and two cats, one on one side of the table, and
one on the other, expecting now and then a, hit from my hand, as a
mark of special favor.

But these were not the two cats which I brought on share at first.
for they were both of them dead, and had been interred near my
habitation by my own hand: hot one of them having multiplied by
I know not what kind of creature, these were two which I preserved
tame, whereas the rest ran wild in the woods, and became indeed
troublesome to me at last; for they would often come into my house,
and plunder me, too, till at last I was obliged to shoot them, and did
kill agreat many; at length they left me. With this attendance,
and in this plentiful manner, I lived. Neither Could I be said to
want anything but society; and of that, some time after this, I was
likely to have too much.

I was something impatient, as l have observed, to have the use of
my boat, though very loath to run any more hazards; and, therefore,
sometimes I sat contriving ways to get her about the island, and at
other times I sat- inyself down contented enough without her. But- 1
had a strange uneasiness in my mind to go down to the point of the
island, where, as I have said, in my last ramhle, I went up the hill to
see how the shore lay, and how the current set, that 1 might see what
I had to do; this inclination increased upon me every day, and at
length I resolved to travel thither by land, following the edge of the
shore. I did so; but had any one in England been to meet such a
man as I was, it must either have frightened him or raised a. great
deal of laughter; and, as I frequently stood still to look at myself, I
could not but smile at the notion of my travelling through Yorkshire
with such an equipngo, and in such a dress. Be pleased to take a
sketch of my figure, as follows:

I had a great high shapeless cap, made of a goat's skin, with r. flap
hanging down behind, as well to keep the sun from me as to shoot
the rain off from running into my neck, nothing being so hurtful in
these climates as the rain upon the flesh, under the clothes.

I had 1). short jacket of goat's skin, the skirts coming down to about
the middle of the thighs, and a pair of open-kneed breaches of the
same. The brooches were made of the skin of an old he-goat, whose
hair hung down such a length on either side, that, like pantaloons, it
reached to the middle of my legs. Stockings and shoes I had none,
but had made me a pair of somethings, I scarce know what to call

.nous-son cncsoz. Ml

them, like bushins, to flap over my legs and lace on either side, likc
spattcrdashes, but of a must barbarous shape, as indeed were all the
rest of my clothes.

I had on a broad belt of goat's skin, dried, which I drew together
with two thongs of the same, instead of buckles; and in a kind of frog
on either side of this, instead ofn sword and dagger, hung a little saw
and hatchet, one on one side and one on the other. Iliad another
belt, not so broad, and fastened in the same manner, which hung over
my shoulder; and at the end of it, under my left arm, hung two
pouches. both made of goat's skin, too, in one of which hang my new
der.in the other my shot. At my back I carried my basket, and on my
shoulder my gun, and over my head a great clumsy goat's skin mn-
hrella, but which, after all, was the most necessary thing I had about
me, next to my gun. As for my face, the color of it was really not so
uiillattc,x-like as one might expect from a man not at all careful ofit,
and living within nine or ten degrees of the equinox. My heardl
had once suil'orcd to grow till it was about a quarter of a yard long,
but as I had both scissors and razors sufficient, I had cut it pretty
short, except what grew on my upper lip, which I had trimmed into
a large lutil'nf Malmmctan whiskers, such as I had seen worn by some
Turks at Snllee, for the Moors did not wear such, though the Turks
did. Of these mustaches or whiskers, I will not say they were long
enough to hang my hat upon them, but they were of a lcncth and
shape monstrous enough, and such as in England would have passed
for frightful.

But all this is by-tho-by ; for, as to my figure, I had so few to ob--
serve me that it was of no manner of consequence, so I say no more
to that part. In this kind of figure I went my new journey, and was
out five or six days. I travelled first along the seashore directly to
the place where I first brought my boat to an anchor, to get upon the
rOeks, and having no boat now to take care of I went over the land,
a nearer way, to the same height that I was upon before, when, look.
ing forward to the point of the rocks which lay out, and which I was
obliged to double with my boat, as is said ahove, I was surprised to
see the sea all smooth and quiet--no rippling, no motion, no current,
any more than in any other places. I was at a strange loss to under-
stand this: and resolved to spend some time in observing it, to see if
nothing from the sets of the tide had occasioned it; but I was pres-
ently convinced how it was, viz., that the tide of ebb setting from the
west, and joining with the current of waters from some great river on
the shore, must be the occasion of this current, and that according
as the wind blew more forcibly from the west or from the north, this
current came nearer or went further from the shore; for, waiting
thcrenhout till evening, I went up the rock again, and then the tide
of ebb being made, I plainly saw the current again as before, only
that. it ran farther ofl', being near half a league from the shore;
whereas, in my case, it set. close upon the shore, and hurried m9 and
my canoe along with it, which at another time it woul! nit have
done.

This observation convinced me- that I had nothing to 10 but to ob-
serve the ebbing and the flowing of the tide, and I might very easily
bring my boat about the island again; but, when l begun to think of
putting it in practice, I had such a. terror upon my spirits at the re-
membrance of the danger 1 had been in, that I could not think of it
again with any patience, but, on the contrary, I took up another reso--
lution, which was more safe though more laborious, and this was that
I would build or rather make me another periagun or canoe, and so
have one for one side of the island and one for the other.

You are to understand that now I had, as I may call it, two planta-
tions in the island; one, my little. fortification, or tent with the wall
about it, under the rock, with the cave behind me, which, by this time
I had enlarged into rmeml apartments or caves, one within another
One of these, which was the driest. and largest, and had a door out be-
yond my wall or lint-tifieution, that is to say, beyond where my wall
joined to the rock, was all filled up with large earthen pots, of which
I have given an account, and with fourteen or fifteen great baskets,
which would hold live or six bushels each, where I laid up my store
of provision, especially my corn, some in the car, cut 011' short from
the straw, and the other rubbed out. with my hand.

As for my wall, made, as before. with long stakes or piles, those
piles grew all like trees, and were by this time grown so big, and
spread so very much, that there was not. the least appearance, to any
one's view, of any habitat-ion behind them.

Near this dwelling of mine, but. a little further within the land, and
upon lower ground, lay my two pieces of corn land, which I kept duly
cultivated and sowed, and which duly yielded me their harvest in its
season; and, whenever I had occasion for more corn,I had more land
adjoining as fit as that~

Besides this I had my country seat and I had now a tolerable plan-
tation there also; for, first, I had my little bower. as I called it, which
I kept. in repair--that is to say, I kept the hedge which encircled it
in constantly fitted up to its usual height, the ladder standing alwayl
in the inside. I kept the trees, which at first were no more than my
stakes, but were now grown very firm and tall, always cut, so that
' they might spread, and grow thick and wild, and make the more
agreeable shade, which they did eil'ectunlly, to my mind. In the
middle of this I had my tent always standing, being a piece of sail
spread over poles set up for that purpose, and which never wanted
any repair or renewing, and under this I had made me a squab or
couch with the skins of the creatures I had killed, and with other soft
things, and a blanket laid on them, such as belonged to our sea be 1-
ding, which I had saved, and a great watclmoat, to cover me; and
here, whenever I had occasion to be absent from my chief seat, I tool:
up my country habitation.

Adjoining to this I had my enclosures for my cattle, that is to say,
my goats; and as I had taken an inconceivable deal of pains to fence
and enclose this ground, I was so anxious to see it kept entire, lest the
goats should break through, thatI never left off, till, with infinite
labor, I had stuck the outside of the hedge so full of small stakes and
so near to one another, that it was rather a pale than a hedge, and
there was scarce room to put a hand through between them; which
afterward, when those stakes grew, as they all did the next rainy
season, made the enclosure strong like a wall--indeed, stronger than
any wall.

This will testify for me that I was not idle, and that I spared no
pains to bring to pass whatever appeared necessary for my comfort-
able support ; for I considered the keeping up a breed of tame crea-
ture-s thus at my hand would be a living magazine of flesh, milk, but-
ter, and cheese, for me as long as I lived in the place, if it were to be
forty years; and that keeping them in my reach depended entirely
upon my perfecting my enclosures to such a degree, that I might be
sure of keeping them together; which, by this method, indeed, I so
effectually secured, that when these little stakes began to grow, I had
planted them so very thick, that I was forced to pull some of them up
again.

In this place also I had my grapes growing, which I principally de-
pended on for my winter store of raisins, and which I never failed to
preserve very carefully, as the best and most agreeable dainty of my
whole diet; and, indeed, they were not only agreeable,but medicinal,
wholesome, nourishing, and refreshing to the last degree.

As this was also about half way between my other habitation and the
place where I laid up my boat, I generally stayed and lay here in
my way thither - for I used frequently to visit my boat, and I kept all
things about or belonging to her in very good order; sometimes 1
went out in her to divert myself, but no more hazardous voyages
Would I go, not scarce ever above a. stone's cast or two from the
shore, I was so apprehensive of heing hurried out of my knowledge
again by the currents or winds, or any other accident. But now I
come to a new scene of my life.

Unexpected Alarm and Cause for Apprehension--Ho {artille- hin Abode.

   

T happened one day, about noon, going toward my boat, I
. _/ Was exceedingly surprised with the print of a man's imde
{4 foot on the slmrt', which was very plain to be seen in the
JR sand. I stood like one thunder-struck, or as if I hnd seen an
apparition; I listened, I looked round me, but I could hear nothing,
nor see anything; I went up to a. rising ground, to look further; I
went up the ahere and down the shore, but it was all one; I could
one no other impression but. that one. Iwent to it. again to see it
there were any more, and to observe if it might. not be my fancy ; but
there was no room for that, for there was exactly the print of a foot,
toes. heel, nnd every part of a foot: how came it thither,I knew not,
nor could I in the least imagine; but, after innumerable fluttering
thoughts, like a man perfectly confused and out of myself. I came
home to my fortification, not feeling, as We say, the ground I went on,
but terrified to the last degree--looking behind me at. every two or
three steps, mistaking every bush and tree, and funcying every stump
at a distance to be u man. Nor is it possihle to describe how many
various shapes my afi'righted imagination represented things to me in,
how many wild ideas were found every moment in my fancy, and
what. strange unaccountable whims came into my thoughts by the '11. .

When I came to my castle (for so I thinkI called it ever after this)
I fled into it. like one pursued ; whither I went over by the ladder, as
first contrived, or went. in at the hole in the rock, which I had called
a door, I cannot. rememher--no, nor could I remember the next morn
ing; for never frightened hare fled to cover, or fox to earth, with
more terror of mind than I to this retreat.

I slept none thnt night; the farther I was from the occasion ofmy
fright, the greater my apprehensions were; which is something con!
trary to the nature of such things, and especially to the usual prac-
tice of all creatures in fear; but I was so embarrassed with my own
frightful ideas of the thing, that! formed nothing but dismal imagin-
ations to myself, even though I was now a great way 011' it. Some-
times I fancied it must he the Devil, and reason joined in with me
upon this supposition; for how should any other thing in human
shape come into the place? Where was the vessel that brought
them! What marks were there of any other footsteps? And how
was it possible amen should come there? But then to think that
Satan should take human shape upon him in such a. place, where
there could he no manner of occasion for it, but to leave the print of
his foot behind him, and that even for no purpose: too, for he could
not he sure I should see it--this was an amusement the other way.
I considered that the Devil might have found out. abundance of other
ways to have terrified me than this of a single print of a foot ; that as
I lived quite on the other side of the island, he would never have
been so simple as to leave a mark in a place where it was ten thou-
sand to one whether I should ever see it or not, and in the sand too,
which the first surge of the sea, upon 0. high wind, would have de-
faced entirely; all this seemed inconsistent with the thing itself, and
with all the notions we usually entertain of the subtlety of the Devil.

Abundance of such things as these assisted to argue me out of
all apprehensions of its being the Devil; and I presently concluded,
then, that it must be some more dangerous creature, viz. : that it must
be some of the suvares of the main land over against me, who had
wandered out to sea in their canoes, and, either driven by the currents
or by contrary winds,hnd made the island, and had been on shore, but
were gone away again to see; being as loath, perhaps, to have stayed
in this desolate island as I would have been to have had them.

While these reflections were rolling upon my mind, I was very
thankful in my thoughts that I was so happy as not to be thereahouts
at that time, or that they did not see my boat, by which they would
have concluded that some. inhabitants had been in the place, and per-
haps have searched farther for me; then terrible thoughts racked my
imagination about their having found my boat; and that there were
people here; and that if so, I should certainly have them come again
in greater numbers, and devour me; that if it shouid happen so that
they should not find me, yet they would find my enclosure, destroy all
my corn, and carry away all my flock of tame goats, and I should
perish at last for mere want.

7
Thus my fear banished all my religious hope, all that former eon
fideuce in God, which was founded upon such wonderful experion to
as l had had of his goodness, as if he that had fed me by miracl-
hithorto could not preserve, by his power, the provision which he
had made for me by his goodness. I reproachcd myself with my
laziness, that would not sow any more corn one year than would just
serve me till the next season, as if no accident would intervene to
prevent my enjoying the crop that was upon the ground; and this I
thought was so just a reproof, that I resolved for the future to have
two or three years' corn beforehand, so that, whatever might come, I
might not perish for want of bread.

How strange a. checkerwork of Providence is the life of man! and
by what secret difl'erent springs are the affections hurried about. as
dili'erent circumstances present! Today we love what to-morrow we
hate ; to-day we seek what to-morrow we shun; to-day we desire
what to--morrow we fear, nay, even tremble at the apprehensions of;
this was exemplified in me, at this time, in the most lively manner
imaginable; for I, whose only efiliction was that I seemed banished
from human society, that I was alone, circumscribed by the boundless
ocean, out 03' from mankind, and condemned to what- I called silent
life; that I was as one whom Heaven thought not worthy to be num-
bered among the living, or to appear among the restof his creatures,
that to ha- a seen one of my own species would have seemed to me 9
raising me from death to life, and the greatest blessing that ll'caver:
itself, next to the supreme blessing of salvation, could hestow ; I say
that I should now tremble at the very apprehensions of seeing a man,
and was ready to sink into the ground at but the shadow or silent up
penrnnce of a man's having set his foot in the island.

Such is the uneven state of human life: and it afforded me a great
many curious speculations afterward, when I had a little recovered
my first surprise. I considered that this was the station of life the
infinitely wise and good providence of God had determined for me;
that as I could not foresee what the ends of divine wisdom might be
in all this, so I was not tc dispute his sovereignty, who, as I was his
creature, had an undoubted right, by creation, to govern and dispose
of me absolutely as he thought fit ; and who, us] was a creature that
had offended him, had likewise a judicial right to condemn me to
what punishment he thought fit; and that it was my part to submit to
hear his indignation, because I had sinned against him. 1 then re-
flected, that as God, who was not only righteous, but omnipotcnt, he. .
thought fit thus to punish and atliict me. sohc was able to deliver my
licenses cancer. 14;

that, if he did not think fit to do so, it was my unquestionable duty to
resign myself absolutely and entirely to his will; and on the other
hand, it was my duty also to hope in him, pray to him, and quietly to
attend the dictates and directions of his daily providence.

These thoughts took me up many hours, days, nay, I may say, weeks
and mouths; and one particular effect of my cogitntions on this con.-
sion I cannot omit. One morning, early, lying in my bed, and filled
with thoughts about my danger from appearances of savages, I found
it dis :mnposed me very much _: upon which these words of the Scrip-
ture came into my thoughts: "Call upon me in the day of trouble,
and I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me." Upon this, rising
cheerfully out of my bed, my heart was not only comforted, but I was
guided and encouraged to pray earnestly to God for deliverance
when I had done praying, I took up my Bible and opening it to
read, the first Words that presented to me were, " Wait on the Lord,
and be of good cheer, and he shall strengthen thy heart; wait, I say,
on the Lord." It is impossible to express the comfort this gave me.
In answer, I thankfully laid down the hook, and was no more sad, at
least on that occasion.

In the middle of these cogitations, apprehensions, and reflections, it
came into my thoughts one day, that all this might he a. mere chimera
of my own, and that this foot might be the print of my own feet, when
I came on shore from my boat; this cheered me up a little, too, and I
.'egan to persuade myself it was all a delusion ; that it was not-hing
else but my own foot; and why might I not come that way from the
boat, as well as I was going that way to the heat? Again, I consid-
ered also, that I could by no means tell, for certain, where I had trod,

' and where I had not; and that if, at last, this was only the print of
my own foot, I had played the part of those fools, who try to make
stories of spectres and apparitione, and then are frightened at them
more than anybody.

Now I began to take courage, and to peep abroad again, for I had
not stirred out of my castle for three days and nights, so that I began
to starve for provisions; for I had little or nothing within doors but
some barley cakes and water; then I knew that my goats wanted to
be milked too, which usually was my evening diversion ; and the pom
creatures were in great pain and inconvenience {or want of it; and,
indeed, it almost spoiled some of them, and almost dried up thcit
milk. Encouraging myself, therefore, with the belief that this was
nothing but the print ol' one of my own flat, and that Imight be
truly said to start at my own shadow, I began to go abroad again
and went to my country house to milk my flock , ant- to see with what
fear I went forward, how often I looked behind me, how I was ready,
e.a.y now and then, to lay down my basket and run for my life, it
would have made any one think I was haunted with an evil conscience,
3. that I had been lately most terribly frightened; and so, indeed, I
in}. However, as I went down than two or three days: and having
<<Len n'thing,I began to be a little holder. and to think there was
really nothing in it but my own imagination; hutI could not per
anode myself fully of this till I should go down to the shore again,
:nd see this print of a. foot, and measure it by my own, and see if
there was any similitude or fitness, that. I might he assured it wasmy
ow: foot; tut when I came to the place, first, it appeared evidently
to me, that \\ hen '. laid up my heat, I could not possibly be (It shore
anywhere thereahout: secondly, when I came to measure the mark
euth my own foot, I found my foot not so large by a great deal. Both
these things filled my head with new imaginations, and gave me the
vapors again to the highest degree, so that I shook with cold like one
i" an ngue; and I went home again, filled wilh the belief that some
man or men had been on shore there; or in short, that the island was
inhabited, and I might he surprised before 1 was nwaro_ and what
Course to take for my security I knew not.

Uh, what ridiculous resolutions men take when possessed with fear!
It deprives them of the use of those means which reason ofl'ers for
their relief. The first thing I j.) "l osed to myself was, to throw down
my enclosures, and turn all my tame cattle wild into the woods, lest-
the enemy Should find them, and then frequent the island :11 prospect
of the same or the lil-e hooty; then to the simple thing of digging
up my two cornnelm. last they yhould find such a. grain there, and
still he prompted to frequent the island; then to demolish my bower
and tent, that they might not see any vestiges of hahitation. and
be prompted to 1. ml: further, in order to find out the persons :nhab-
iting.

These were the suhj-ze't Ali me first night's cogitations after I was
come home again, while (la-a ap;.tehensions which hat so .rer: an my
mind were. fresh upon me, and my head was full of vapors, as above
'l'hus fear of danger is ten thousand times more terrifying than fian-
gcr itself when apparent to the eyes; and we find the burden of anx-
iety greater, by much, than the evil which we are anxious about and
which was worse than all thigl had not that relief in this trouble
from the resignation I used to practise, that I hoped to have. I
looked, I thought, like Saul, who complained not only that the Phi
listincs were upon him, but that God had forsaken him; for I did not
now take due ways to compose my mind, by crying to God in my dis-
tress, and resting upon his providence, as I had done before, for my
defence and deliverance; which, if I had done, I had at least been
more cheerfully supported under this new surprise, and perhaps car-
ried through it with more resolution.

This confusion of my thoughts kept me awake all night; but in
the morning I fell asleep; and having, by the amusement of my
mind, been, as it were, tired, and my spirits exhausted, I slept very
soundly, and waked much better composed than I had ever been be-
fore. And now I began to think sedately; and upon the utmost de-
bate with myself, I concluded that this island, which wasso exceeding
pleasant, fruitful, and no farther lrom the main land than as I had
seen, was not so entirely abandoned as I might imagine ; that although
there were no stated inhabitants who lived on the spot, yet that there
might sometimes come boats 011' from the shore, who either with de-
sign, or perhaps never but when they were driven by cross winds,
might come to this place: that I had lived here fifteen years now,
and had not met with the least shadow or figure of any people yet ;
and that if at any time they should be driven here, it was probable
they went away again as soon as ever they could, seeing they had
never thought lit to flxhcrc upon any occasion ; that the most I could
suggest any danger from, was from any casual accidental landing of
straggling people from the main, who, as it was likely, if they were
driven hither, were here against their wills, so they made no stay
here, but went cl? again with all possible speed ; seldom staying one
night on shore, lest they should not have the help of the tides and
daylight back again; and that, therefore, I had nothing to do but to
consider of some safe retreat, in case I should see any savages land
upon the spot.

New I began sorely to repent that I had dug my care so large as
to bring a door through again, which door, as I said, came out be-
yond where my fortifications joined to the rock : upon maturely con-
sidering this, therefore, I resolved to drew me a second fortification,
in the same manner of a semicircle, at a distance from my wall, just
where I had plant-ed a double row of trees about twelve years before,
of whieh I made mention. These trees having been planted so thick
before. they wanted but few piles to be driven between them, that
they might be thicker and stronger, and my well would he soon
finished; so that I had now a double wall: and my outer wall was
thickened with pieces of timber, old cables, and everything I could
think of, to make it strong, having in it seven little holes, about as
big as I might put my arm out ate In the inside of this, I thickened
my wall to about ten feet thick, with continually bringing earth out
of my cave, and laying it at the foot of the wall, and walking upon
': ; and through the Seven holes I contrived to plant the muskcts, of
which I took notice that I had got seven on shore out of the chip:
these I planted like my cannon, and fitted them into frames, that held
them like a carriage, so that I could fire all the seven guns in two
ullntttcu' time. This wall I was many a weary month in finishing,
and yet never thought, myself safe till it was done.

"'hen this was done, I stuck all the ground without my wall, for a
great. length every way, as full with stakes, or sticks, of the osier-likc
wood, which 1 found so apt to grow, as they could well stand ; inso-
ntneh, that] believe I might not in near twenty thousand ofthcm,
leaving a pretty large space between them and my wall, that I might
have room to see an enemy, and they might have no shelter from the
young trees, if they attempted to approach my outer wall.

Thus, in two years' timc,l had a thick grove; and in five or six
years' time I had a wood before my (ln'elling, growing 50 monstrous
thick and strong, that it was indeed perfectly impassable; and no
men, of what kind Hoover, would ever imagine that there was any-
thing beyond it, much less a habitation. As for the way which I
proposed to myself to go in and out (for 1 left no avenue), it was by
setting two ladders, one to it part of the rock which was low, and
then broke in, and left room to place another ladder upon that; so
that when the two ladders were taken down, no man living could
come down to me without doing himself mischief; and if they had
come down, they were still on the outside of my outer wall.

Thus I took all the measures human prudence could suggest fox-my
own preservation; and it will he seen, at length, that they were not
altogether without just reason. though I foresaw nothing at that time
more than my mere fear suggested to me.

While this was doing. I was not altogether careless of my other
chairs: for I had a great concern upon me for my little herd of
goals; they were not only a ready supply to me on every occasion,
and began to he sufiicient for me, without the expense of powder and
shot, but also without the fatigue of hunting after the wild ones: and
I was loath to lose the advantages of them, and to have them all to
nurse up over again.

For this purpose, after long consideration, I could think of but
two ways to preserve them: one was, to find another convenient place
to dig a cave under ground, and to drive them into it every night;
and the other was, to enclose two or three little bits of land, remote
from one another, and as much concealed as I could, where I might
keep about halt'a dozen young goats in each place; so that if any
disaster happened to the flock in general, I might be able to raise
them again with little trouble and time ; and this, though it would
require a great deal of time and labOr, I thought was tie most ra<
tional design.

Accordingly, I spent some time to find out the most retired parts
of the island ; and I pitched upon one, which was as private, indeed,
as my heart could wish for : it was a little damp piece of ground, in the
middle of the hollow and thick woods, where, as I observed, I almost
lost myself case before, endeavoring to come back that way from the
eastern part of the island. Here I found a clear piece of land, near
three acres. so surrounded with woods, that it was almost an en-
closure hy nature; at least, it did not want near so much labor to
make it so as the other pieces of ground I had worked so hard at

Matter (tightmt.

K IMMEDIATELY went to work with this piece of ground
Q and in less than a month a time I had so fenced it round, that
" :1 my flock, or herd, call it which you please, who were not so
jig nild now as at first they might he supposed to be, were well
enough secured in it; so, without any further delay, I removed ten
young she-goats and two lie-goats to this piece ; and when they were
there, I continued to perfect the fence. till I had made it as secure as
dxc other, which, however, I did at more leisure, and it took me up
more time by a great deal. All this labor I was at the expense of
put :ly from my apprehensions on the account of the print of a man's
foot which I had seen; for, as yet, 1 never saw any human creature
come near the island; and I had now lived two years under this uneasi-
ness, which, indeed, made my life much less comfortable than it was
before, as may be well imagined by any who knows what it is to live
in the constant snare of the fear of man. And this I must observe,
with grief; too, that the diseomposme of my mind had too great in
preesions also upon the religious part of my thoughts ; for the drum?
and terror of tailing into the hands of savages and cannibal>> lay so
upon my spirits, that l seldom found myself in a. duo temper for up.
pliention to my Maker, at least, not with the sedate calmness and
resignation of soul which I was wont to do. 1 rather prayed to God
as under great afllietion and pressure of mind, surrounde! with
danger, and in expectation every night of being murdered and de-
voured before morning; and I must testify from my experiene 3, that
a temper of peace, thankfulncw, love and nfl'eet-ion, is much the more
proper frame for prayer than that of terror and discotnnosure; and
that under the dread of mischief impending, a man is or more tit for
a comforting performance of the duty of praying to God, than he is
for a repentance on a sick bed; for these dis~ otnposures ali'ect the
mind, as the others do the body ; and the discotnposuro of the mind
must necessarily be as great a disability as that of the body, and
much greater: praying to God being properly on not of the mind,
not of the body.

But to go on: After I had thus secured one part of my little living
stock, I went about. the whole island searching for another private
place to make another deposit, when, wandering more to the west
point of the island titan I had ever done yet, and looking out to sea, I
thought I saw a boat upon the sea, at a great distance. I had found
a perspective glaas or two in one of the seatnen's chests, which 1
saved out of our ship, but I had it not about me, and this was so re-
mote that] could not- tell what to make of it; though I looked at it
till my eyes were not able to hold to look any longer; whether it was
a boat or not I do not know, but as I descended from the hill 1 could
see no more of it, so I gave it over, only I resolved to go no tune out
without a perspective glass in my pocket. When I was come down
the hill to the end of the island, where, indeed, I had never been be-
fore, I was presently convinced that the seeing the print of a man's
foot was not such a strange thing in the island asl imagined; and,
but that it was a special providence that I was cast upon the side of
the island where the savages never came, I should easily have known
that nothing was more frequent than for the canoes from the main,
when they happened to he a little too far out to sea, to shoot over to
that side of the island for harbor; liltewitso7 as they often met and
fought in their canoes, the victors, having taken any prisonera, w: nld
luring them over to this shore, where, according to their dreadful cus-
tom, being eannibnls, they would kill and eat them--of which here
after.
When I was come down the hill to the shore, as I said abcre, being
he southwest point of the island, I was perfectly confounded and
amazed, nor is it possible for me to espress 'hc horror of my mind at
seeing the shore spread with skulls, hands, feet, and other bones of
ammo bodies; and, particularly, I observed a place where there had
been a fire made, and a circle dug in the earth, like a cockpit, \vhere
Isupposed the savage wretches had sat down to their inhuman feast-
ir gs upon the bodies of their fellow-creatures.

l was so astonished at the sight of these things that I entertained
no notion of any danger ' ) myself from it for a long while; all my
apprehensions were buried in the thought of such a pitch of inhuman,
hellish brutality. and the horror )f the degeneracy of human nature,
which, tnc ugh I had heard of it often, yet I never had so near a view
of before; it. short, I turned away my face from the horrid spectacle,
my stornnci grow sick, and I was just at the point of fainting, when
nature discharged the disorder from my stomach, and having vomited
with uncommon violence 1 was a little relieved, but could not bear to
stay in the place amoment, so I got me up the hill again with all
the speed I could, and walked on toward my own habitation.

Who). I came aliule out of that part of the island I stood still
awhile, us amazed, and then recovering myself, I looked up with the
utmost afi'ection of my soul, run), with a flood of tears in my eyes, gave
God thanks, that had cast my that lot in a part of the world where l
was distinguished from such dreadful creatures as these, and that
though I had esteemed my present condition very miserable, had yet
given me so many comforts in it, that I haul still more to give tluuiks
I .r than to complain of; and this, above all. that I had, even in this
miserable condition, been comforted with the knowledge of himself,
and the hope of his blessing, which was a felicity more than sulfi-
oicntly equivalent to all the misery which I had suffered or could
suffer.

In this frame of thankfulnesr I went home to my castle, and began
to be much easier now, as to the safety of my circumstances, than
over 1 was before, for I observed that these wretches never came to
this island in search of what they could get, perhaps not seeking, not
wanting, or nct expecting anything here, and having often, no doubt,
been up .n the covered woody part of it without finding anything to
their purpose. I knew I had been here now almost eighteen years,
and never saw the least footstep of human creature there before, and
I might be eighteen years more as entirely concealed as I was now, if
I did not discover myself to them, which 1 had no manner of occasion

7.
to do. itheing my only business to keep myself entirely concealed
where l was, unless I found a better sort of creatures than caunihnis
to make myself known to. Yet 1 entertained such an abhorrenm of
the savage wretches that I have been speaking of, and ot' the "'I'cll 'n-
:xl, inhuman custom of their devouring and eating one another up,
"hat I continued pensive and sad, and kept close within my own cirein
Cur almOst two years after this. \Vht'n I say my own eircle,I mean
y it my three plantations, vim, my castle, my country seat, whiuh I
died my bower, and my enclosure in the woods; nor did I look after
his for any other use than as an enclosure for my goats; for the
u'ersiun which nature gave me to these hellish wretehos was such,
-.hat I was as fearful of seeing thom as of seeing the devil himself. I
iid not so much as go to look after my boat all this time, but begin
rather to think of making me another, for 1 could not think of ever
making any more attempts to bring the other boat rouua the island
to me, lest I should meet nith some of these creatures at sea, in
which, if I had happened to have fallen into their hands,I knew what
would have been my lot.

Time. however, and the satisfiI-ction I had that. l was in no danger
)f being discovered by these people, hogan to wear o3 my uneasiness
nbout them, and I began to live just in the same composed manner as
before only with this difi'orenco, that. I used more caution and kept
my eyes more about me than I did befiu'e, lost I should happen to be
seen by any of thrm: and. particularly, I was more cautious of tiring
my gun. INF any of them being on the island should happen to hen:
it. It Wm. therefore, a very good providence to me that] had fur-
nished myself with a tame breed of goats, and that. I had no need to
hunt any more about the woods, or shoot at them; and if I did eaten
any tux-re of them after this, it. was by traps and snares, as I had done
before. so that. for two years after this, I believe, I never fired my gun
ofl'. though I never went out without it; and, which was more, as I
had saved three pistols out. of the ship. I always carried them out with
me. or at least. two of them, sticking them in my gont'eskin belt. I
a so forhished up one of the great. entlesses that I had out of the ship.
and made me a hell. to hang it on. also, so that I was now a most- for
midahle follow to look at when I went. abroad, if you add to the for
mer description of myself the particular of two pistols, and a great
broadsw rd hanging at my side in a belt, but without it stabbard.

Things going on thus. as l hare said, for some time, I seem ad, or-
cepting these cautions, to be reduced to my former calm. sedate way
of living. All these things tenda'.' to show me, more and more. how
lar my condition was from being miserable, compared to some others,
nay, to many other particulars of life which it might have pleased
God to have made my lot. It put me upon reflecting how little re-
pining there would be among mankind at any condition of life, if
people WOLid rather compare their condition with those that were
worse, in order to be thankful, than to be always comparing them
with those which are better, to assist their murmurings and com-
plainings.

As in my present condition there were not really many things
which I wanted, so indeed, I thought that the frights I had been in
about these savage wretches. and the concern I had been in for my
own preservation, had taken 03 the edge of my invention for my own
conveniences; and I had dropped a good design, which I had once
bent my thoughts too much upon, and that was, to try if I could not
make some of my barley into malt, and then try to brew myself some
beer. This was really a whirrsieal thought, and I reproved myself
often for the simplicity of it ; for l presently saw there would he the
want of several things necessary to the making my beer, that it
would be impossible for me to supply; as, first, easks to preserve it
in, which was a thing that, as I had observed already. I could never
compass; no, though I spent not only many days, but weeks, nay
months, in attempting it, but to no purpose. In the next place, I had
no hops to make it keep, no yeast to make it work, no copper or
kettle to make it boil ; and yet with all these things wanting, I verily
believe, had not the frights and terrors l was in about the savages
intervened, 1 had undertaken it, and perhaps brought it to pass too,
for I seldom gave anything over without nocomplishiugit, when once
I had it in my head to begin it But my invention ran now quite
another way; for, night and day, I could think of nothing but how I
might destroy some f these monsters in their cruel, bloody enter-
tainment, and, if possible, save the victim they should bring hitherto
destroy. It would take up a larger volume than this whole work is
intended to be, to set down all the eontrivanees I hatched, or rather
brooded upon, in my thoughts, for the destroying these creatures, or
at least frightening them so as to prevent their coming hither any
more ; but all this was abortive; nothing could be possible to take
efi'ect, unless I was to be there to do it myself; and what could one
man do among them, when perhaps there might be twenty or thirty
of them together, with their darts, or their bows and arrows, with
which they could shoot as true to a mark as I could with mv gun?

Sometimes Ithought of digging a hole under the place where they

After I had thus laid the scheme of my design, and, In my uuugin
Ition, put it in practice, I continually made my tour every morning
up to the top ofthe hill, which was treat my castle, as l Called it
about three miles or more, to see if! could observe any boats upon
tho 1"", coming near the island, or standing over toward it; but 3
began to tire of this hard duty, after 1 had, for two or three month,
constantly kept. my watch, but came always back without any dia-
emery : there having not, in all that time, been the least appearance,
not only on and near the shore, but- on the whole ocean, so far as my
eyes or glames could reach every way.

As long as I kept my daily tour to the hill to look out, so long
also I kept up the vigor oftuy design, and my spirits seemed to be all
the while in It suitable form for no outrageous nu cxceution an the
killing twenty or thirty naked savages, for an otl'ence which 1 had not
at all entered into a discussion of in my thoughts, any further than
my pamionu were at first tired by the horror 1 conceived at the un-
natural custom of the people of that country, who, it seems, had been
suflt'red hy Providence, in his \rise disposition ot the world, to have
no other guide than that of their own uhominahle and \'itiated pas-
sions; and, consequently, were left, and perhaps had been so for
some ages, to act. hitch horrid things, and receive such dreadful cus-
toms, as nothing but nature, entirely abandoned by Heaven, and ac-
tuated by some hellish degeneracy, Could have run them into. But
now, when, as l have said, 1 began to he \\ eat-y of the fruitless excur-
Iiou, which I had made so long and so far every morning in train, so
my opinion of the action itself I began to alter; and began. with
cooler and calmer thoughts, to consider what I wan~ going to engage
in: what authority or call 1 had to pretend to hejmige and execu
tioner upon these men as criminals, whom lleaven had thought tit, fol
so many ages, to suti'er. unpunished, to go on, and to l-e, as it were,
lne exceutioners of his judgments one upon another. How (hr these
people were offenders against me, and what right had I to engage in
the quarrel of that blood which they shed promiseuonmly one upon
another, I debated thin very often with mysell, thus: " How do I know
what (iod himsell'judges in this particular case? It is certain these
net-sons do not commit this as a crime _; it is. not against their own
eon.~ciemre~i reprovingY or their light reproaehiug them: they do not
know it to be an oil'cnce. and then commit in defiance ot'divine justice,
as we do in almost all the aims we commit. They think it no more
I crime to kill a captive taken in war, than we do to kill an ox; nor
k cat human ticsh, than we do to eat mutton."

When I considered this a little, it followed necessarily that I w"158 Anvnn'rt'nns or

ncrtainly in the wrong in it; that these people were not murderer!
in the scnse that i had before condemned them in my thoughts. any
uure than those Christians were murderers who often put to death
the prisoners taken in battle; or more frequently, upon many occa-
sions put whole troops of men to the sword, without giving quarter.
though they threw down their arms and submitted. In the next
place, it occurred to me, that although the usage they gave one
another was thus brutish and inhuman, yet it was really nothing to
me ; these people had done me no injury; that if they attempted me,
orI saw it necessary, for my immediate preservation, to fall upon
them, something might be said for it, but that. I was yet out of their
power, and they really had no knowledge of mo, and consequently no
design upon me; and therefore it could not be just for me to fall
upon them; that this would justify the conduct of the Spaniards in
all lheir barhat'itics practised in America, where they destroyed mill-
ions of these people ; who, however they were idolaters and barba-
rians, and had several bloody and barbarous rites in their customs,
such as sacrificing human bodies to their idols, were yet, as to the
Spaniards, very innocent people ; and that the rooting them out of
the country is spoken of with the utmost abhorrenee and dctestation
by even the Spaniards themselves at this time, andby all other
Christian nations in Europe, as a mere butchcry, a bloody and unnat-
ural piece of cruelty, unjustifiable either to God or man, and for
which the very name of a Spaniard is reckoned to he frightful and
terrible to all people ofhnmanity or of Christian compassion--as if
the kingdom of Spain were particularly eminent for the produce of a
race of men who were without principles oftcndcrness, or the common
huu'cls of pity to the miserable, which is reckoned to be a mark of
generous temper in the mind.

These considerations really put me to a pause, and to a kind of a full
stop; and I began, by little and little, to be off my design, and to con.
elude I had taken w rong measures in my resolutions to attack the sar-
ages; and thatit "as not my business. to meddle with them, unless
the 3: first attacked me; and that it was my business, if possible, to pr:-
rent; but, that if I were discovered and attacked by them, I knew my
duty. On the other hand. I argued with myself, that this really was
the way not to deliver myself, hut entirely to ruin and destroy myself ,
for unless I was sure to kill every one that, not only, should be on
shore at that time, but that should ever come 'on share afterward, if
but one of them escaped to tell their country-people what had hop.
pane-i, they would come over again, by thousands torevengo the death
of their fellows, and I should only bring upon myself a certain do
struction. which, at present, I had no occasion for. Upon the whole,
I concluded that neither in principle nor in policy I ought, one way
or other, to concern thyself in this afi'air; that my business was, by
all possible means, to conceal myself from them, and not leave the
least signal to them to guess by that that there were any living crea-
tures upon the island, I mean of human shape. Religion joined in
with this prudential rmsolution, and I was convinced now, many ways,
that l was perfectly out of my duty when I was laying all my bloody
schemes for the destruction of innocent creatures, I mean innocent as
to me. As to the crimes they were guilty of toward one another, I
had nothing to do with them ; they were national, and I ought to leave
them to the justice of God, who is the governor of nations, and knows
how, by national punishments, to make u just retribution for national
ofi'enccs. and to bring public judgments upon those who client! in a
public manner, by such ways as best please him. This appeared so
clear to inc now, that nothing was a greater satisfaction to me than
that I had been sufl'cred to do nthing which I now saw so much reason
to believe would have been no less 11. sin than that of wilful murder,
if i had committed it ; and I gave most- humble thanks, on my knees,
to God, that had thus delivered me from blood-guiltiness : beseeehing
him to grant me the protection of his providence, that I might not
fall into the hands of barbarians, or that I might not lay my hands
upon them. unless I had a more clear call from Heaven to do it, in
defence of my own life.

Robinson discover- 3 Gave which men him on anon-eat against the Savages.

A" N this disposition I continued for near a year after this; and
{5;} so for was I from desiring an occasion for falling upon these
. wretcht-s, that' in all that time 1 tan er once a em, up the hill to
M see whether there were any of them in sight, or to know
whether any of them had been on shore there or not, that I might, not
be tempted to renew any of my contrivances against them, or be pro-
voked. by any advantage which might present itself, to fall upon
them; only this I did, I went and removed my boat, which I had 0..
tho other side of my island, and carried it down to the east end (f the
whole island, whom I ran it into a little cove, whieh I found under
some high rocks, and where I knew, by reason of the currents. the
savages thirst not, at least would not, come with their hoatsmpon any

all those I removed. that there. might. not he the least shadow of any
diseovery. or any appearance of any boat. or of any human habitation
upon the island. Besides this, I kept myself. as I said, more retired.

employment, viz., to milk my she-goats. :tud manage my little ilot-k in

quite out of danger; tin- eertain it is, that these savage. people. who

 

sometimes haunted this island, ne't er came with any thoughts of find-
ing 't'w'thin}: here. and consequently never wandered off from the
coast: and I doubt. not hut they might have. been several times on
shore after my apprehensions of them had made me eautious. as well

m- ion to give some remarkable instances in the remaindei of his
solitary rnsidcnec in this dismal place.

lhelicra the readcr of this will not think it- strange if T confess
that those :1ll"i('lll'SS, those constant dangers I lived in. and the con-
corn that. was upon mo, put an end to all invention, and to all the con-
trivanccs that I had laid for my future accommodations and conveni-
r'ncr's. I had the care of my safoty more now upon my hands than
that of mr fund. I cared not. to drive a nail, or chop it stick of wood
now, for tear-tho noise I might make should he hoard: much long
would I fire a gun. for the same reason : and, above all, I was intol.
erahly uneasy at. making any fire. lost the smoke. which is \'isihle at a

great distance in the day, should betray me. For this reason I re-162 Lox-1mm or

moved that part. of my business which required fire, such as burning
of pots and pipes, &c., into my new apartment in the woods 3 where,
after I had been some time, I found to my unspeakable consolation, a
more natural cave in the earth, which went. in a vast way, and where,
I dare say, no savage, had he been at the mouth of it, would be so
hardy as to venture in; nor, indeed, would anyman else, but one
who, like me, wanted nothing so much as a safe retreat.

The mouth ofthis hollow was at the bottom ofa great rock, where1
by mere. accident (I would say. if I did not see abundant reason to
ascribe all such thinga now to Providence), I was cutting down some
think branches of trees, to make charcoal--and, before I go on, I
mlwt observe the reason of my making this charcoal, which was this:
I was afraid of making a smoke about. my habitation, as I said be-
fore, and yet I could not live there without baking my bread, cook-
ing my meat, &e., no I contrived to lmrn some wood here, as I had
seen done in England, under turf, till it became ehark or dry coal, and
then putting the fire out.I I preserved the coal to carry home, and
perform the other services for which fire was wanting, without dan-
ger of smoke. But this is hy-thc-hy. While. I was cutting down some
wood here, I perceived that behind a very thick branch of low brush-
wood, or underwood, there was a kind of hollow place ; I was curious
to look in it, and getting with difiieulty into the mouth of it, I found
it was pretty large, that is to say, suflicient for me to stand upright in
it, and perhaps another with me: but I must. confess to you that I
made more haste out than I did in, when, looking further into the
place, which was perfectly dark, I saw two broad ahining eyes of
so no creature, whether devil or man I knew not. which twinkled like
two stars, the. dim light from the cave's mouth shining directly in and
making the reflection. However, after some pause I recovered my-
self: and began to call myself a thousand fools, and to think that he
that "as afraid to ace the. devil was not fit to live twenty years in an
island all alone, and that I might well think there was nothing in this
wire that was more frightful than myself. Upon this. plucking up
my courage, I took up a firehrand and in I rushed again, with slick
flaming in my hand ; I had not gone three steps in but. I was almost
as much frightened as I was before, for I heard a very loud sigh, like
that of a man in some pain, and it was followed by a broken noise, a:
of words half expressed. mad then a deep sigh again. I stepped back,
and was indeed struck with such a surprise that it put me into a cold
sweat, and if I had had ahat on my head, I will not answer for it
that my hair might. not. have lift-ed it 08'. But still plucking up myROBINIIM anneal. 163

o,irits as well as I could, and encouraging myself a little with con-
siJcring that the power and presence of God were everywhere, and
were ahio to protect me ; upon this I stopped forward again, and by
the light of the fircbrand, holding it up it little over my head, I saw
lying on the ground a most monstrous. frightful, old lie-goat, just ma-
king his will, as we say, and gasping for life. and dying, indeed, of
more old age. I stirred him a little, to set: if I could get him out,
and he tsmyed to get up but was not able to raise himself, nndl
lllollgm. with myself he might even lie there. for if he had frightened
me, so In: would certainly fright any of the savages, if any of them
should he so hardy as to come in there while he had life in him.

1 was now recovered from my surprise, and began to look round
me, when I found the care was but very small, that is to say, it might
he nhout twelve feet over, but in no manner of shape, neither round
nor square, no hands having ever- been employed In making it but
those of mere nature. I ohm-trod. also, that f-hcre was a place at the
further side of it that went in further. but it. was so low that it re-
quired me to creep upon my handa and knees. to go into it, and
whither it went I knew not. so. having no candle, I gave it over 1hr
that time, but resolved to come again the next- dny, provided with
candles and a tinder-Lox. which I had made of the lock of one of the
muskets, with Home wild-fire in the. pan

Aeeordiugly, the next day I came provided with six large candle!
('fmy own making (for I made very good candles now of goat's tal-
lcw, but was hard set for handle-wick, using sometimes rags or rope-
yarn. and sometimes the dried rind of!>> wood like nettles), and going
inm :hiu low place I was obliged to creep upon all fours, as I have
said, almost ten yarda, whiuh, by the way, I thought was a venture
l'oid enough, considering that I knew not how far it might go, nor
what was beyond it. When I got through the strait I found the roof
ruse higher up, I believe near twenty feet, but never was such a glo-
rious sight seen in the island, I dare say, as it was, to look round the
sides and roofot' this vault oreave; the wall reflected a hundred thou
an. d lights to me from my two candles. What it was in the rock,
whether diamonds or any other precious stones, or gold, which I
lather supp..sed it to he, I knew net. The place I was in was a most
dollglllflll entity (.1 grotto of its kind as could he expected, though
perfectly dark ; the floor was dry and level, and had a sort of a small
loner gravel upon it, so that there was no nauseous or venomous crea-
ture in In. nt't'll, neither was there any damp or wet on the sides or
roof; the only difficulty in it was the entrance, which, however. as it164 mvsmnm or

was a place of security, and such a retreat as I wanted, I thought
that was a convenience, so that I was really rejoiced at the discovery,
and resolved, without any delay, to bring some of those things which
I was most anxious about to this place: particularly, I resolved to
bring hither my magazine of powder and all my spare arms, viz., two
lim'ling-pieces (for 1 had three in all) and three muskets, for of them
I had eight in all ; so I kept at my castle only five, which stood ready
mounted, like pieces ot'connuu, on my outmost fence, and were ready,
also, to take out upon any expedition. Upon this occasion of remov-
ing my ammunition I happened to open the barrel of powder which I
took up out of the sea, and which had been wet, and 1 found the
water had penetrated about three or four inches into the powder on
every side, which caking and growing hard, had preserved the inside
like u. kernel in the shell, so that I had near sixty pounds of very good
powder in the centre of the cask. This wasa very agreeable dis
covery to me at that. time, so I carried all away thither, newr keep-
ing above two or three pounds of powder with me in my castle, for
fear of n. surprise of any kind; I also carried thither all the leadl
had left, for bullets.

lfaucied myself now like one of the ancient giants, which were
said to live in caves and holes in the. rocks, where none could come at
them, for I persuaded myself, while I was here, that if five hundred
savages were to hunt me they could never find me out, or if they did,
they would not venture to attack me here. The old goat whom!
found expiring died in the mouth of the cave the next day after]
made this discovery, and I found it much easier to dig a great hole
there, and throw him in and cover him with earth, than to drag him
out, so I interred him there to prevent offence to my nose.

I was now in the twemy-third your of my residence in this island,
and was so naturalized in the place, and the manner of living. that
could I have but enjoyed tho, certainty that no savages would come
to the place. to disturb Inc, I could have been content to have capito-
lated for spending the rest- of my time there. even to the last moment,
till 1 had laid me down and died. like the old goat in the cave. I had
also arrived to some little diversions and amusements, which made
the time pass a great deal more pleasantly with me than it did In:-
fore; us, first. I had taught my l'oll, as noted before, to speak. and he
did it so finniliarly. and talked so articulately and plain. that it was
very pleasant. to me, for I believe no bird ever spoke plaiuer. and he
lived with me no less than six-and-twenty years; how long he might
have lived afterward I know not, though I know they have auction
in the Brazils that they live a hundred years. My dog wns a very
pleasant and loving companion to me for no less than sixteen year-
of my time, and then died efmere old age. As to my cats. they mul-
tinlied, as I have observed, to that degree that I was obliged to shoot
uremi of them at first, to keep them from devouring mo and ail I
had; but at length, when the two old onesl brought with me were
gene, and after some time continually driving them from me, and let-
ting them have no prowsien with me, they all run wild into the woods,
an apt two or that: fm'orites, which I kept tome, and whose young,
when they had any, 1 alwayn drowned--and these were a part of my
fi'uuuly. Besides thesr. I always kept two or three household kids
at: ut me, wllcm l taught to feed out of my hund; and I had two more
put-lots, which tulked pretty well. and would all call "Robin Cru-
soe; but none like my first; nor, indeed, did 1 take the pains with
any of them that I had done with him. I hurl, also, scvcrnl lame sen-
fowls, whose names I knew not, that I caught upon the shore, and
out their "lugs; and the little stakes which I had planted before my
castle wall hoiug now grown up to a good thick grove, these {owls nll
lived among these low trees and bred there, which was very agree-
able to me, so that as I azud above, I began to he very well contented
with the life I led, it'I could have been secured From the dread of the
savages. But it was otherwise directed; and it, may not be amiss for
all people who shall meet with my story, to make this just observa-
tion from it, viz, " How frequently, in the course of our lives, the evil
which in itself we seek most to shun, and which, when we are fallen
into. is the most dreadful to us, is oftentimes the very means or door
of our deliverance, hy which alone we can be raised again from the
nllliction we are fallen into." 1 could give many examples of this in
the com so of my unaccountable life. but in nothing was it more par-
ticularly remarkable than in the circumstances of my last years oi
solitary residence on this island
ehnpter mutate.

Another Visit of the Savages--Robinson use: than: Dinning--Puccini the
Wreck of a Vessel.

. Twas now the month of December, as I said nbove,in my
twenty-third year; and this being the southern solstice (for
winter I cannot call it). was the particular time of my harvest,
and required my being pretty much abroad in the fields;
when going out pretty early in the morning, even before it wan
thorough daylight, I was snrprixed with seeing a light of some fire
upon the shore, at a distance from me of nlnout two miles, toward
the end of the island where I had ohservod some savages had been,
as before; and not on tho other side, but, to my great amietion, it
was on my side of the island.

I was indeed terrihly surprised at. the sight, and stopped short
within my grove, not daring to go out, lest I might he surprised ; and
yet I had no more peace within, from the apprehensions I had that
if these savages, in rambling over the island, should find my corn
standing or out. or any of my works and improvements, they would
immediately conclude that there were people in the place. and would
then never give over till they had found me out. In this extremity
I went hack directly to my castle. pulled up the ladder after me, and
made all things without look as wild and natural in: I could.

ThenI prepared myself within, putting myflelf in a posture of
defence: I loaded all my cannon, as I called them. that is to say, my
muskets, which were mounted upon my new fortification, and all my
pistols, and resolved to defend myself to the last gasp ; not forgetting
seriously to commend myself to the divine protection. and earnestly
to pray to God to deliver me out of the hands of the barharinno. 1
continued in this posture about two hours: and hogan to he mighty
impatient for intelligence ahroad, for I had no spies to send out
Afler sitting awhile longer, and musing what I should do in this,
I was not ahle to hear sitting in ignorance any longer; so setting up
my ladder to the side of the hill, where there was a flat plaze, as I
observed before, and then pulling the ladder up after me. I set it up
Igain, and mounted to the top of the hill; and pulling out my
perspective glass, which I had taken on purpose. I laid me down flat
on my belly on the ground, and began to look for the Place. I
presently found there was no less than nine naked savages, sitting
round I Imal'. fire they had made, not to warm them, ftr they had no
need of that, the weather being extremely hot, but, as I supposed, to
dress some of their barbarous diet of human flesh, which they had
brought with them, whether alive or dead 1 could not teli.

They had two canoes with them, which they had hauled up upon
the shore; and as it was then the tide of ebb, they seemed to me to
wait for the return of the flood to go away again. It was not easy to
imagine what confusion this sight put me into, especially seeing them
come on my side of the island, and so near me, too; but when 1 con-
sidered their coming must be always with the current of the ebb,[
began, afterward, to be more sedate in my mind, being satisfied that
Imight go abroad with safety all the time of the tide of flood, if
they were not on shore before ; and having made this observation, I
went. abroad about my harvest work with the more composure.

As I expected, so it proved; for as soon as the tide made to the
westward, I saw them all take boat, and row (or paddle, as we call
it) away. I should have observed, that for an hour or more before
they went off, they went a dancing; and I could easily discern their
postures and gestures by my glass. I could not perceive, by my
nicest observation, but that they were stark naked, and had not the
least covering upon them; but whether they were men or women I
c0uld not distinguish.

As soon as I saw them shipped and gone, 1 took two guns upon my
shoulders, and two pistols in my girdle, and my great- sword by my
side, without a scabbard, and with all the speed I was able to make,
went away to the hill where I had discovered the first appearance of
all; and as soon as I got thither, which was not in less than two
hours (for I could not go apace, being so laden with arms as I was),
I perceived there had been three canoes more of savages at that
place; and looking out farther, I saw they were all at sea together,
making over for the main. This was a dreadful sight to me, cspo.
cially as, going down to the shore,I could see the marks of horror,
which the dismal work they had been about had left behind it, viz,
the blood, the bones, and part of the flesh, of human bodies, eaten
and devoured by those wretches with merriment and sport. I was so
filled with indignation at the sight, that I now began to premeditato
the destruction of the next thatI saw there, let them be whom or how
many soever. It seemed evident to me that the visits which they
made thus to this island were not very frequent, for it was above fif-
teen months before any more of them came on shore there again; that
is to say, I neither saw them nor any footsteps or signals of them. in
all that time; for, as to the rainy masons, then they are sure not to
come abroad, at least not so far; yet all this while I lived uncom-
fortably, by reason of the constant apprehensions of their coming
upon me by surprise: from whence I observe, that the expectation of
evil is more bitter than the sufl'ering, especially if there is no room
to shake off that expectation, or those apprehensions.

During all this time I was in the murdering humor, and took up
most of my hours, which should have been better employed, in con-
triving how to circumvent and fall upon them, the very next time I
should see them; especially if they should be divided, as they were
the last time, into two parties: nor did I consider at all, that if I
killed one party, snppose ten or 9. dozen, I was still the next day, or
week, or month, to kill another, and so another, even ad infinilum, till
Ishould be at length no less a murderer than they were in being
man-eaters, and perhaps much more so. I spent my days now in
great perplexity and anxiety of mind, expecting that I should, one
day or other, fall into the hands of these merciless creatures; and if
I did, at any time venture abroad, it was not without looking around
me with the greatest care and caution imaginable. And now I found
to my great comfort, how happy it was that I provided for a tame
flock or herd of goats: for I durst not, upon any account, fire my
gun, especially near that side of the island, where they usually come,
lest I should alarm the savages; and if they had {led from me now, I
was sure to have them come again, with perhaps two or three hun-
dred canoes with them, in a few days, and then 1 know what to expect
Ilowever, I wore out a year and three months more before I ever saw
any more of the savages, and then I found them again, as I shallsoen
observe. It is true, they might have been there once or twice, but
either they made no stay, or at least I did not see them: but in the
month of May, as near as I could calculate, and in my four-and-
twentieth year, I had a very strange encounter with them; of which
in its place.

The perturbation of my mind, during this fifteen or sixteen months'
,rnterml, was very great ; I slept unquiet. dreamed always frightful
dreams, and often started out of my sleep in the night: in the day,
great troubles overwhelmed my mind; and in the night I dreamed
often of killing the savages, and of the reasons why I might justify
the doing of in But to waive all this for a while. It was in the
middle of May, on the sixteenth day,l think, as well as my poor
wooden calendar would reckon, for I marked ell upon the post still

occasion of it, but as l was reading in the Bible, and taken up with
very serious thoughts about my present condition, I was surprised
nth the noise of a gun, usl thought. fired at sea. This was, to be
sew, a surprise quite of n dili'erent nature from any 1 had met. with
before; for the notions this not into my thoughts were quite of
lnother kind. I started up in the greatest haste imaginable, and, in
a triee. clapped my ladder to the middle place of the rock, and pulled
it after me; and mounting it the second time, got to the top of the
hill the very moment that a flash ol tire bid me listen for a second
gun, which accordingly, in about halfa minute, I heard; and, by the
nuu'l, knew it was from that part of the sea where I was driven down
the torrent in my bout. 1 immediately considered that this must be
somo :.-hip in distress, and that they had some comrade, or some other
ship in company, and fired these guns for signals of distress, and
to obtain help. l had the presence of mind, at that minute, to
think that though 1 could not help them, it might be they might help
me: no I brought. together all the dry wood I could get at hand, and
making a good handsome pile,l set it on fire upon the hill. The
wood was dry, and blamed freely; and though the wind blew very
hard, yet it burnt fairly out: so that I was certain, if there was any
each thing as a ship, they must needs see it; and no doubt they did ;
for us soon as over my tire blazed up I heard another gun, and after
that several cthers, all from the same quarter. I plied my tire all
night long, till daybreak; and when it was broad day, and the air
cleared up, I saw something at a great distance at sea, full east of
the island, whether a sail or a hull I could not distinguish, no. not
with my glass; the distance was so great, and the weather still some-
thing hazy also; at least it was so out at sea.

I looked frequently at it all that day, and soon perceived that it did
not move; so I presently concluded that it was a ship at anchor; and
being eager= you may be sure, to be satisfied, I took my gun in my
hand, and you toward the south side of the island, to the reeks where
I had formerly been carried away with the current; and getting up
there, the weather by this time being perfectly clear, I could plainly
me, to my great serrow, the wreck of a ship, cast away in the night
upon those concealed rocks which I found when I was out in my boat;
and which rocks, as thcy checked the violence of the streamnm
made a kind of counter-stream, or eddy, were the occasion of my rc-
covering fool!) the most desperate, hopeless condition that ever Md110 some": or ,

been in, in all mylife. Thus, what is one man's safety is another
man's destruction ; for it seems these men, whoever they were, being
out of their knowledge, and the racks being wholly under water, had
been driven upon them in the night, the wind blowing hard at E. N.

not, they must,ns I thought, have endeavored to have saved them.
selves on shore by the help of their boats; but their firing ofi' guns
for help, especially when they saw, as I imagined my fire, tilled me
with many thoughts. First, I imagined that upon seeing my light,
they might have put themselves into their boat, and endeavored to
make the shore; but that the sea going very high, they might have
been cast away; other times I imagined that they might have lost
their boat before, as might be the case many ways--as particularly,
by the breaking of the sea upon their ship, which many times obliges
men to stave, or take in pieces, their heat, and sometimes to throw it
overboard with their own hands; other times I imagined they had
some other ship or ships in company. who, upon the signals of distress
they had made, had taken them up and carried them off; other times
I fancied they were all gone ofi' to sea in their boat, and being hur.
ried away by the current that I had been turmerly in, were carried
out into the great ocean, where there was nothing but misery and
perishing; and that, perhaps, they might Ivy this time be starving
and in a condition to think of eating one another.

As all these were but conjectures at best, so, in the conditiun I was
in, I could do no more than look on upon the misery of the poor men,
and pity them; which had still the good efi'ect on my side, that it
gave me more and more cause to give thanks to God, who had so
happily and comfortably provided for me in my desolate condition;
and that of two ship's companies who were new cast away upon this
part of the world, not one life should be spared but mine, l learned
here again to observe, that it is very rare that the providence of God
casts us into any condition of life so low, or any misery so great, but
we may see something or other to be thankful fur, and may see others
in worse circumstances than our own. Such certainly was the case
of these men, of whom I could not so much as see room to suppose,
any of them were saved; nothing could make it rational so much as
to wish or expect that they did not all perish there, except the possi
bility only of their being taken up by another ship in company; and
this was but mere possibility, indeed, for I saw not the least sign or
apearaneo of such thing. I cannot explain, by any possible energy.

Es Visits the Wreck and Obtains many stores from it --Aga.in thinks of
Quitting the Blend--Has e Remarkable Dream.

(@ HERE are some secret moving springs in the affections,
' which, when they are set a going by some object in view,
@ or, though not in View, yet rendered present to the mind by

the power of imagination, that motion carries out the soul,
by its impetuosity, to such violent, eager einbmcings of the object,
that the absence-of it is insupportehle. Such were these enrnest
wishings that but one man had been saved. I believe I repented the
words: " 0 that it had been but one!" a thousand times; and my de-
sires were so moved by it, that when I spoke the words my hands
would clinch together, and my fingers would press the pnllns of my
hands so, that if l had any soft thing in my hand it would have
crushed it involuntarily; and the teeth in my head would strike to-
gether, and set against one another so strong, that for some time I
could not part them again. Let the naturalists explnin these things.
and the reason and manner of them; all that I can say to them is, to
describe the fact. which was even surprising to me, when i found it,
though I knew not from whence it proceeded; it was doubtless the
effect of ardent wishes, and of strong ideas formed in my mind. rcali
sing the comfort which the conversation of one of my fellow.
Christians would have been to me. But it was not to be; either fleir
fate or mine, or both, forhndo it: for, till the last year of my being
on this island, I never know whether any were saved out of that ship
or no; and had only the affliction, some days after, to see the corpse
of a drowned boy come on shore at the end of the island which was
next the shipwreck. He had no clothes on buts seemeu's waistcnnt,
e pair of open-heed linen drawers, sud e. blue linen shirt, but nothing172 mvrsrum or

to direct me so much an to guess what nation he was of; he had
nothing in his pockets but two pieces-of-cight and a. tobacco-pipe;
the lust was to me of ten times mere value than the first.

It win; new calm, and 1 had a grent mind to venture out in my hunt:
to the wreck, not doubting but I might find something on hoard that
might be useful to me ; but that did not altogether press me so much,
as tho powihility thnt there might be yet some living creature on
board, whose life I might not only sure, but might, by saving that
life, comfort my own to the loot degree. And this thought clung so
to my heart, that I could not be quiet night or dny,hut I must venture
out in my boot on board this wreck; and committing the rest to God's
pft)\'itl('llt'l',l thought the impression was so strong upon my mind
that it could not. be resisted, lhut it. must come from some invisible
direction, nnd lhnt 1 should he wanting to myself ifl did not go.

Under the power of this impression, I hastened hock to my castle,
prepared everything for my vuynge, took a quantity ul'hreud, a great
not of fresh wnter, u compuss to steer hy, u bottle of rum (for I had
still a grout dual of tllut loft), ond n basket of raisins; and thus load-
ing myself with everything ueccssury, I went dowu to my boat, got
the water out of her. put her nliout, londed all my 'orgo in her, and
then went home again for more. My second rovgo was :1 great hug
of rice. the umbrella to set. over my head for n shade, another large
pot of fresh water, uud about. two dozen of my small loaves, or barley-
cakes, more than before. with u hottle of goat's mill: and n. t-hecsc;
all which, with grout labor and sweat, I curried to my hunt; and
prnying to God to direct my voyugc. I put out: und rowing, or pud-
dling, the. cnnou nlong the shore, came at lust to the ntnmst point of
the ishtnd on the northeast side. And now I was to launch out into
the ocean. and either to venture or not to venture. I looked on the
rapid currents which run constnntly on both sides of the island of. n (lis-
tnneu. and which were very terrible to me, from the remembrance of
the. hazard l hnd hecn in before, nud my heart hogan to fail me: for
I firrcsuw that ifl was driven into either of those currents, I should
be earricd It great Why out to sea. and }.t'.l'll:\|t!SS out. ofmy rem-h, or
night ot'tho island again : and that. then. as my lmnt. was hit smnll, if
[my little gain of wind should rise, 1 should he inevital-ly lost.

'l'heso thoughts so oppressed my mind. that l hogan to give over my
filttt'rltl'iflt': and having hnuled my lmut into a little creel: on the
shore, I stepped out. and sat. me down upon it rising hit of ground,
very pensive and anxious. between four and desire. about my voyage ;
when, as I was musing, I could perceive that the tide was turned, and
the flood came on; upon which my going wns impracticable for so
many hours. Upon this, presently, it occurred to me that I should
go up to the highest piece of ground I could find, and observe, if I
could, how the sets of the tide, or current-s, lay when the flood come
in, that I mightjudgo whether, if I was driven one way out, I might
not expect to be driven another way home, with the some repidness
of the currents. This thought was no sooner in my head then I cast
my eye upon at little hill, which sufficiently overlooked the sen both
ways, and from whence I had a. clear view of the currents, or sets of
the tide, and which way I was to guide myself in my return. Here
I found, that us the current of the ebb set out close by the south point
of the islnud, so the current of the flood set in close by the shore of the
north side; and that I bod nothing to do but to keep to the north side
of the island in my return, and I should do well enough.

Encouraged with this observation, I resolved, the next morning, to
set out with the first of the tide; and reposing myself for the night in
my canoe, under the great wntcheont I mentioned, I launched out. I
first mode :1. little out to sen, full north, till I began to feel the benefit
of the current.= which set eastward, and which carried me at a great
rate, and yet did not so hurry me as the current on the south side
hnd done before, so as to take from me all government of the boat ; but
having a. strong stecrngc with my paddle, I went at 8. great rate di-
rectly for the wreck, and in less than two hours I came up to it. It
was a dismal sight to 1001: at; the ship, which, by its building, was
Spanish, stuck fast, jammed in between two rocks; all the stern and
quarter of her were beaten to pieces with, the sea; and as her fore-
castle, which stuck in the rocks, had run on with great violence, her
mainmnst and foremost were brought by the board, that is to say,
broken short off; but her bowsprit was sound, nnd the head and bow
appenred firm. When I came close to her, adog appeared upon her,
who, seeing me coming, yelped and cried; and as soon as I called
l:i1n,jnmch into the sea to come to me. I took him into the boat,
but found him almost dend with hunger and thirst. I gave him a.
Carl-{c of my bread, and he devoured it like a. ravenous wolf that had
been starving n fortnight in the snow. I then gave the poor creature
some fresh wnter, with which, if I would have let him, he would have
burst himself. After this, I went on board ; but the first sight I met
with was two men drowned in the cook room, or forecastle of the
ship, with their arms that about one another. I concluded, as indeed
probable, that when the ship struck, it being in a. storm, the see
broke so high, and so continually over her, that the men were not
able to bear it, and were strangled with the constant rushing in oft-he
water, as ranch as if they had been under water. bemoan the dog,
there was nothing left in the ship that had life; nor any goods, that I
could ace, but what were spoiled by the water. There were some
cask: of liquor, whether wine or brandy I know not, which lay lower
in the hold, and which, the water being ebhcd out, I could see; but
they were too big to meddle with. I saw several chests, which I
believed belonged to some of the seamen ; and I got; two of them into
the boat, without examining what was in them. Had the stern of the
chip been fixed, and tho forepart broken off. I am persuaded I might
have made a good voyage; for by what I found in these two rhcsls, I
had room to suppose the ship had a great deal of wealth on board;
and, i" may guess from the course she elect-ed, she must have been
bound from lluenos Ayres, or the Ilio de la Plata, in the south part
of America, beyond the Brazils, to the Ilavana, in the Gulf of Mex-
ico, and so perhaps to Spain. She had, no doubt, a great treasure in
her, but of no use, at that time, to anybody ; and what became of her

crew, 1 then knew not.
Ifound, lwaidt's these chests, a little cask full of liquor, of nhout

twenty gallons, which I got into my boat with much difficulty. There
were several muskete in the calain, and a great yowdor-horn, with
about four pounds of powder in it; as fox-the muskets,l had no occa-
sion for them, so I left them, but took the yowdcr-horn. I took atirc.
shovel and tongs, which I wanted extremely ; as also two little brass
kettles, a copper pot to make chocolate and a gridiron : and with this
cargo, and the dog, I came away, the tide beginning to make. home
again ; and the Same evening. about an hour within night, I reached
the island again, weary and fatigued to the last degree. I reposed
that night in the boat; and in the morning I resolved to harbor what
I had got. in my new cave, and not carry it home to my castle. After
refreshing myself, I got all my cargo on shore, and began to examine
the particulars. The cask of liquor I found to ho a kind of rum, but
not such as we had at the Brnzils, and in aword, not at all good; but
when I came to open the chests, I found several things of great use to
me ; {or exmnyle, l found in one a fine case of bottles, of an extraor-
dinary kind, and filled with cordial waters, fine and very good ; the
bottles held about three pints each, and were tipped with silver. I
found two pots of very good succades or sweettncatn, so fastened also
on the top, that the unit water had not hurt them ; and two more of
the same which the water had spoiled. I found some very good shirts,
which were very welcome to me 5 and about a dozen and a half ofManson chosen. '17:;

'whito linen hendkorchiefe and colored neekcloths; the former were
also very welcome, being exceeding refreshing to wipe my fees in a
hot day. Besides this, when I came to the till in the chest, I fouud
three great bags of pieces-o'f-eight, which held about eleven hundred
pieces in all; and in one of them, wrapped up in a paper. six doub-
loons of gold and some small bars or wedges of gold; I suppose they
might all weigh near a. pound. In the other chests were some clothes,
but of little value; but by the circumstances, it must have belonged
to the gunncr's mate; though there was no powder in it, except two
pounds of line glazed powder, in three small flasks, kept, I suppose
for charging their fooling-pieces on occasion. Upon the whole, I got
very little by this voyage that was of any use to me ; for, as to the
money, I had no manner of occasion for it ; it was to me as the dirt
under my feet; and I would have given it all for three or four pair
of English shoes and stockings, which were things I greatly wanted,
but had none on my feet for many years. I had, indeed, got two pairs
of shoes now, which I took of? the feet of the two drowned men whom
I saw in the wreck, and 1 found two pairs more in one of the chests,
which were very welcome to me ; but they were not like Our English
shoes, either for ease or service, being rather what we coll pumps
than shoes. I found in this seamnn's chest about fifty pieces-oileight
in rials, but no gold; I suppose this belonged to a poorer man than
the other, which seemed to belong to some olheer. life". however, I
logged this money home to my cove, nnd laid it up as I had done that
before which I brought from our own ship ; but it was a great pity,
as l said, that the other part of this ship had not come to my share;
for I our satisfied I might have loaded my canoe several times over
with money; and thought I, "If i ever escape to England, it might
lie here snfe enough till I may come again to fetch it."

Having now brought all my things on shore, and secured them, I
went back to my booth and rowed or pnddled her along the shore, to
her old harbor, where I laid her up, and mode the best of my way to
my old habitation, where I found everything safe and quiet. I begin
now to repose myself, live after my old fashion, and take care of my
family all'oirs; end for awhile,I lived easy enough, only that I was
more vigilant than I used to he. looked out oftener, and did not go
abroad so much ; end if, at any time. I did stir with any freedom, it
was always to the east part of the island, 'where I was pretty well
satisfied the savages never come, and where I could go without so
many precautions. and such 1: load ol'arms and ammunition as I alway'l
'esrried with me if I went the other way. I lived in this condition

, 1r
near two years more; but my unlucky head, that was always to let
me know it was born to make my body miserable, was all these two
years filled with projects and designs, how: if it were possible, I might
get away from this island; for, sometimes. I was for making another
voyage to the wreck, though my reason told me that there was nothing
left there worth the hazard of my voyage ; sometimes, for a ramble
one way, sometimes another; and I believe verily, if I had had the
boat that I went to Sallee in, I should have ventured to sea, bound
anywhere, I know not whither. I have been, in all my circumstances,
a memento to those who are touched with the general plague of man-
kind, whence, for aughtl know, one half of their miseries flow; I
mean that of not being satisfied with the station wherein God and no>>
tare hath placed them; for, not to look back upon my primitive con-
dition, and the excellent advice of my father, the opposition to which
was, as I may call it, my original sin, my subsequent mistakes of the
some kind had been the means of my coming into this miserable con.
dition; for had that Providence, which had so l-nppily seated me at
the Branils as a planter, blessed me with confhu-Ii desires, and I could
have been contented to have gone on gradually, I might have been,
by this time, I mean in the time of my being in this island, one of the
most considerable planters in the Ill-nails; nay, I mu persuaded. that
by the improvements I had made in that little time, 1 lite-.l there,
and the increase I should probably have made if I remained. I might
have been worth a hundred thousand moidores. And what business
had I to leave a settled fortune, n. well-stocked plantation, improving
and increasing, to turn eupercnrgo to Guinea, to fetch negroes, when
patience and time would have so increased our stock at home, that we
could have bought them at our own door from those whose business
it was to fetch them ; and though it had cost us something more, yet
the difl'crcnce of that price was by no means worth saving at so great
a hazard I But as this is usually the fate of young heads, so reflec-
tion upon the folly of it is as commonly the exercise of more years,
or of the dear-bought experience of time ; so it was with me now;
and yet so deep had the mistake taken root in my temper, that I could
not satisfy myself in my station, but was continually poring upon the
means.- aud possibility of my escape from this place. and that I may,
with the greater pleasure to the reader, bring, on the remaining part
of my story, it may not be improper to give some account of my first
conceptions on the subject of this foolish scheme for my escape, and
how, and upon what foundation. I acted.

to the wreck, my frigate laid up and secured under water, as usual, and
my condition restored to what it was before; I had more wealth, indeed,
than I had before, but was not at all the richer; for I had no more use
for it than the Indians of Peru had before the Spaniards came there.

It was one of the nights in the rainy season, in March, the four-
and-twentieth year of my first setting foot in this island of solitude, I
was lying in my bed, or hammock, awake; very well in health, had
no pain or distemper, no uneasiness of body, nor any uneasiness of mind,
more than ordinary, but could by no means close my eyes, that is, so as
to sleep; no, not a. wink all night long, otherwise than asfollows: It is
impossible to set down the innumerable crowd of thoughts that whirl.
cd through that great thoroughfare of the brain, the memory. in this
night's time; I ran over the whole history of my life in miniature,
or by ahridgment, as I may call it, to my coming to this island, and
also that part of my life since I came to this island. In my reflections
upon the state of my case since I came on'shore on this island, I was
comparing the happy posture of my afi'airs in the first yenrsof my
habitation here, compared to the life of anxiety, fear, and care, which
I had lived in, ever since I laid seen the print of a foot in the sand;
not that I did not believe the savages had frequented the island even
all the while, and might have been several hundreds of them at times
on shore there ; but I had never known it, and was incapable of any
apprehensions about it ; my satisfaction was perfect, though my den.
ger was the same, and I was as happy in not knowing my danger, as
if I had never really been exposed to it. This furnished my thoughts
with many very profitable reflections, and particularly this one: How
infinitely good that Providence is, which has provided, in its govern-
ment of mankind, such narrow bounds to his sight and knowledge of
things; and though he walks in the midst of so many thousand dan-
gers, the sight of which, if discovered to him would distract his mind
and sink his spirits, he is kept serene and calm, by having the events
of things hid from his eyes, and knowing nothing of the dangers
which surround him.

After these thoughts had for some time entertained me, I came to
reflect seriously upon the real danger I had been in for so many years
in this very island, and how I had walked about in the greatest secu-
rity, and with all possible tranquillity, even when perhaps nothing
but the brow of a hill, a greet tree, or the casual approach of night,
had been between me and the worst kind of destruction, viz., that of
falling into the hands of cannibals and savages, who would have seized
on me with the same View as I would on a goat or a turtle, and have

thought it no more it crime to kill and devour me than I did a pigeon
or a uurlew. I would unjustly slander myself if I should my I was
not sincerely thankful to my Great l'resorver. to whose singular pro-
loctimn l acknowledged, with great humility, all those unknown de-
liverauoes Were due, and without which I must inevitably have fallen
into their merciless hands.

When those thoughts were over, my head was for some time taken
up in condduring the nature of these wretched creatures (1 menu the
Garage>>). and how it came to pm in the world that the wise Governor
ol'all things should giro up any of his creatures to such inhumanity,
nay. to something so nmeh below oven brutality itself. as to devour
its own kind ; but as this ended in some (at that time) fruitless specu-
lations. it occurred to me to inquire what part of the world these
wretehm lived in; how for oil' the coast wns whence they coine;
who: they ventured over so far from home for; what kind of bouts
they had: nnd why I might not order myxelfnnd my business so that
I might be as aldu to go over thither as they were to come to me?

I never so much on troubled myself to consider what I should do
with myself when I went thither, what. would become of me if I fell
into the hands of the savages. or how I should escape From them if
they :ttrar.ked me: no, nor so much as how it was possible for me to
reach the coa~t, and not be attached by some or other of them. with-
out :my possibility of delivering myself; and if I rhould not fall into
their hands, what I should do for prorisionsmr whither I should bend
my roux-so. None of these thoughts, I say. so much on mine in my
way, hut. my mind was wholly lut'nt upon the notion of my passing
or-'r in my butt to the main land. I looked upon me present eon-
dit'nu as the most miseraldo that could possibly be; that I was not
able to throw myself into anything but death that could he called
worse: and ifl reached the shore of the main, I might perhaps meet
with relief. or I might. coast along, as I did on the African shore. till
I came to some inhabited country, and where I might find some relief;

once. I was ngitoted wholly by these thoughts; all my calm of mind,
in my resignation to Providence, nnd waiting the issue in the dispo-
sitions of Heaven, seemed to be suspended, and I had, as it were, no
power to turn my thoughts to anything but to the project of a voyage
to the main, which come upon me with such force, and such on im-
petuosity of desire, that it was not to be resisted.

When this had agitated my thoughts for two hours or more, with
Such violence that it set my very blood into n ferment, and my pulse
beat as if I had been in a fever, merely with the extraordinary fervor
of my mind about it, nature, as if I had been fatigued and exhnusted
with the very thought of it, threw me into a. sound sleep. One would
have thought I should have dreamed of it, but I did not, nor of any-
thing relating to it, but I dreamed that as lwos going out in the
morning, as usual, from my castle, I saw upon the shore two canoes,
and eleven savages coming to land, and that they brought with them
another savage, whom they were going to kill, in order to eat him,
when, on a sudden, the snvege that they were going to kill jumped
owny and run for his life; and I thought, in my sleep, that he came
running into my little thick grove before my fortification to hide
himself, and that I. seeing him nlone, and not perceiving that the
others sought him in thnt way, showed myself to him, and smiling
upon him encouraged him ; that he kneeled down to me, seeming to"
pray me to assist him; upon which I showed him my ladder, made
him go up, and carried him into my cave, and he became my servant;
and thnt, nssoon as I had got this man, I said to myself, "Now I may
certainly venture to the mniu land, for this fellow will serve me as 8'
pilot, end will tell me what to do, and whither to go for provisions,
and whither not to go, for four of being devoured--what places to
venture. in, end whnt to shun." I waked with this thought, and was
under such inexpressible impressions of joy at the prospect of my
escape. in my dream, that the disnppointmeut which I felt upon com;
ing to myself, and finding that it was no more than a dream, were
equally extravagant the other way, and threw me into u. very great
dejection of spirits.

Upon this, however, I made this conclusion: that my only way to
go about to attempt an escape was, if possible, to get a. savage into
my possession-Land, if possible, it should be one of their prisoners,
whom they had condemned to be eaten, and should bring hither to
kill. But these thoughts still were attended with this difficulty, thnt
it was impossible to efi'ect this without attacking a. whole carsvnn of
them and killing them all; end this was not only a very desperate180 museums or

BOUTnyear and a half after I entertained these notions

(and by long nursing had, as it were, resolved them all into

nothing, for want of an occasion to put them into execu-

tion), I was surprised one morning early, with seeing no
less than live canoes all on shore together on my side the island, and
the people who belonged to them all landed,land out of my sight.
Tho number of them broke all my measures; for seeing so many, and
knowing that they ol ways cums four or six, or soiiietiuns more, in a
boat, I could not tell what to think of it, or how to take any measures,
to attack twenty or thirty men single-handed; so I lay still in my
castle, perplexed and discomforted ; however, I put myself into all
the some postures for an attack that I had formerly provided. and was
just ready for action, if anything had presented. Having waited a
good while, listening to hear if they made any noise, at length, being
wry impatient, I set my guns at the foot of my ladder, and clambercd
up to the top of the hill, by my two stages. as usual; standing so,
however, that my head (lid not appear above the bill. so that they
could not perceive me by any means. Here I observed, by the help
of my perspective glass, that they were no less than thirty in num-
ber; that they had a fire kindled, and that they had meat dressed.
Ilow they had cooked it I knew not, or what it was; but they were all
dancing, in! know not how many barbarous gestures and figures,
their own way, round the fire.

While I was thus looking on them, I perceived by my perspective,
two miserable wretches dragged from the boats, where it. seems they
were laid by. and were now brought out for the slaughter. I per-
ceived one of them immediately fall, being knocked down, I suppose,
with a club or wooden sword, {hr that was their way, and two or three
others were at work immediately, cutting him open for their cookery,
\rhilo the other victim was left standing by himself, till they should
be ready for him. In that very moment, this poor \vrctch, seeing
himself a little at liberty, and unbound, nature inspired him with hopes
of life, and he started away from them, and ran with incredible swift-
ness along the sands, directly toward me, I mean toward that part of
the coast where my habitation was. I was dreadfully frightened, I182 - MWPA'H'RES or

must acknowledge, when l perceit ed him run my way, and especially
when, us I thought, I saw him pursued. by the whole body : and now
I expected that part of my dream was coming to pass, and that he
would cerutinly take shelter in my grove; but I could not depend,
by any means, upon my dream for the rest of it, viz., that the other
savages would not pursue him thither, and find him there. However,
I kept my station, and my spirits began to rec-ovenwhen I found that
there was not above three men that followed him; and still more
was I encouraged when I found that he outstripped them exceedingly
in running, and gained ground of them, so that if he could but hold
it for half an hour, 1 saw easily he would fairly get away from them
all.

There was between them and my cnatle the creek, which 1 men.
tioned often in the first part of my story, where I landed my cargoes
out of the ship; and this I saw plainly he must necessarily swim
over, or the poor wretch would be taken there; but when the savages
escaping came thither, he made nothing of it, though the tide was
then up; but plunging in, swam through in about thirty strokes, or
therenhouts, landed, and run on with exceeding strength and swift-
ness. When the three persons came to the creek, I found that two of
them could swim, but the third could not, and that, standing on the
other side, he looked at the others, but went no farther, and soon after
went softly back again ; which, as it happened, was very well for him
in the end. I observed, that the two who swam were yet more than
twice as long swimming over the creek as the follow that was fled
from them. It come now very warmly upon my thoughts. and indeed
irresistibly, that now was the time to get me a servant, nnd perhaps
companion or assistant, and that I was called plainly by Providence
to save this poor creature's life. I immediately ran down the ladders
with all possible expedition, fetched my two guns, for they were both
at the foot of the ladders, no I observed nhorc, and getting up again.
with the some haeto, to the top of the hill, I crossed toward the sea,-
und having a very short cut, and all down hill, placed myself in the
way between the pursuere and the pursued, hallooiug aloud to him
that fled, who, looking back. was at first, perhaps, as much frightened
at me As at them; but I beckoned with my hand to him to come bank;
and, in the meantime, I slowly udranced toward the two that fol-
lowed : then rushing at once upon the foremost, I knocked him down
with the stock of my piece. I was loath to fire, because I would not
hum the rest hear; though, at that distance, it would not have been
ensily heard, and being out of sight of the smoke, too, they would notaosrxsos (2313303. 183

have easily known what to make of it.' Having knocked this fellow
down, the other who pursued him stopped, as if he had been fright-
ened, and I advanced apnce toward him: but as I came nearer, I
perceived presently he had a bow and arrow, and was fitting it to
shoot. at me ; so I was then necessitated to shoot at him first, which I
did, and killed him at the first shot. The poor savage who tied but
had stopped, though he saw both his enemies fallen and killed, as he
thought, yet was so frightened with the fire and noise of my piece,
that he stood stock still, and neither went forward nor went back.
ward, though he seemed rather inclined still to fly than to come on.
I hallooed again to him, and made signs to come forward, which be
easily understood, and came a little way; then stopped again, and
then a little farther. and Stopped again ; and I could then perceive
that he stood trembling, as if he had been taken prisoner, and had just
been to be killed. as his two enemies were. I beckoned to him again
to come to me, and gave him all the signs of encouragement that I.
could think of; and he came nearer and nearer, kneeling down every
ten or twelve steps, in token of acknowledgment for saving his life.
I smiled at him, and looked pleasantly, and beckoned to him to come
still nearer; at length he came close to inc; and then he kneeled
down again, kissed the ground, and laid his head upon the ground,
and taking me by the foot, set my foot upon his head : this, it seems,
was in token of swearing to be my slave for ever. I took him up,
and made much of him, and encouraged him all I could. But there
was more work to do yet; for I perceived the savage whom I knocked
down was not killed but stunned with the blow, and began to come
to himself; so I pointed to him, and showed him the savage, that he
was not dead: upon this he spoke some Words to me, and though I
could not understand them, yet I thought they were pleasant to hear;
for they were the first sound of a. man's voice that I had heard, my
awn excepted, for above twenty-five years. But. there was no time
{or such reflections now; the savage who was knocked down ro-
covcred himself so far as to sit up upon the ground, and I perceived
that my savage began to be afraid; but when I saw that, I presented
my' other piece at the man, as if I would shoot him: upon this my
savage, for so I called him new, made a. motfon' to me to lend him
my sword which hung naked in a bolt by my side, which I did. He
no sooner had it, but he runs to his enemy, and, at one blow, cut of
his head so cleverly, no executioner in Germany could have done it
sooner or better; which I thought very strange for one who, I had
reason to believe, never saw a sword in his life before, except their

. awn-pi.
own wooden swords: however, it seems, as I learned afterward. they
make their Wooden swords ao sharp,so heavy, and the wood is so
hard, that they will cut 011' heads even with them. ay, and arms. and
that at one blow, too. When he had done this, he comes laughing to
me, in sign of triumph, and brought. me the sword again, and with
abundance of gestures, which I did not understand, laid it down, with
the head of the savage that he had killed,just before me. But that
which art-fished him most was to know how I killed the other Indian
10 far ou'. so pointing to him. he made signs to me to let him go to
aim ; so I bade him go, as well as I could. When he came to him, he
stood like one amazed, looking at him, turning him lirst on one side,
than on the other, looking at the wound the bullet had made, which it
recmn, was jnzst in his breast where it had made a hole, and no great
quantity of blood had followed, but he had bled inwardly, for he was
quite dead. lle took up his bow and arrows, and came back; so I
turned to go away, and beckoned him to follow mo, making signs to
him 1. at more might come after them. Upon this he made signs to
me that he should bury them with sand, that they might not be seen by
the rest, if they followed; and so I made signs to him again to do no.
He fell to work; and, in an instant, he had scraped a hole in the sand
with hie hands, big enough to bury the first in, and then dragged him
into it, and covered him; and did so by the other also: I believe he
had buried them both in a. quarter of an hour. Then calling him
away, I carried him not to my castle, but quite away, to my cave, on
the farther part of the island; so I did not let my dream come :0
pass in that part, viz, that he came into my grove for shelter. Her-5

water, which I found he was indeed in great distress for, by his run-
ning; and baring refreshed him, l made signs for him to go and lie
down to sleep, showing him a place where I had laid some rice straw
and a blanket upon it, which _I used to sleep upon myself sometimes
so the poor creature lay down, and went to sleep.

lie was it comely, handsome fellow, perfectly well made, with
bit-night, strong limbs, not too large, tall, and well shaped, and as I
reckon, about twenty-six years of age. He had a very good counte-
nance, not a furce and surly aspect, but seemed to have something
very nnnly in his face ; and yet he had all the sweetness and softness
of a European in his countenance, too, especially when he smiled.
llis l-oir was lrng and black, not curled like wool, his forehead very
high and large, and a great vivacity and sparkling sharpness in his
eyes. The color of his skin was not quite black but very ta" ny, and
yet not an ugly yellow, nauseous tawny, as the Brazilians and Vii-
gininns, and other natives of America. are, but of a bright kind of a
dun oliie color, that had in it something very agreeable, though not
very easy to describe. His face was round and plump, his nose small,
not tint, like the negrocs; a very good mouth, thin lips, and his tins
teeth well set, and as white as ivory.

After he had slumbered rather than slept about half an hour he
awoke again, and came out of the cave is me, for I had been milking
my goats, which I had in the enclosure just by. When he espied me
he came running to me, laying himself down upon the ground,with all
the possible signs of an huruhie, thankful disposition, making a great

the ground, close to my foot, and sets my foot upon llin head. as he
had done before. and after this made all the signs to me of subjection,
servitude, and submission, imaginable, to let me know he would serve
me as long as he lived. I understood him in many thingsmnd let
him know I was very well pleased with him. In a little time I be-
gan to speak to him, and teach him to speak to me; and, first, I let
him know his name should be Finns! . which was the day I saved his
life; I called him so for the memory of the time. I likewise taught
him to say " .'lnster;" and then let him know that was to be my
name; I likewise taught him to say " yes" and "no," and to know
the meaning of them. I gave him some milk in an earthen pot, and
let him see me drink it beiixrc him and sop my bread in it : and gave
him a cake of bread to do the like, which he quickly comylicd with,
and made signs that it wur very good fr r him I kept there with him
all that night, but as soon as it was day l beckoned to him to some
with me, and let him know that I Would give him some clothes, at
which he seemed very glad, for he was stark naked. As we went by
the place where he had buried the two men, he pointed exactly to the
place, and showed me the marks that he had made to find them again,
making signs to me that we should dig them up again and eat them.
At this I appeared very angry. expressed my abhorrence of it, made
as if 1 would vomit at the thought of it and bee-honed with. my hand
to him to come away, which he did inunediately, with great submis-
sion. I then led him up to the top of the hill, to see if his enemiu
were gone, and pulling out my glass I looked, and saw plainly the
place where they had been, but no appearance of them or their ea-
noes= so that it was plain that the y were gone, and had left their two
comrades behind them, without any search after them.

But i was not content with this discovery ; but having now more186 tum-rum e!

courage, and consequently more 'euriosityJ took my man 3 ridny with
me, giving him the "Von! in his bend, with the bow and arrows at
his back, which I found he could use very dexterously, milking him
carry one gun for me, and I two for myself, and away we marched to
the place where these creatures lmd been, for I had a mind now to
get some fuller intelligence of them. When I came to the place my
very blood run chill in my veins, and my heart sunk within me at the
horror of the spectacle; indeed it was a. dreadful sight--M least it
was so to me, though Friday made nothing of it. The place was
covered with human bones, the groun l dyed with their blood, and
great pieces of flesh left here and there half eaten, mangled, and
scorched, and, in short, all the tokens of the triumphant feast they
had been making there, after a victory over their enemies. I saw
three skulls, the hands, and the bones of three or four legs and feet,
and abundance of other parts of the bodies ; and Friday, by his signs,
made me understand that they brought over four prisoners to feast
upon, that three of them were eaten up, end that he, pointing to him-
self, was the fourth; that there had been it great battle between them
and their next king, whose subjects it seems he had been one of, and
they had taken a. great number of prisoners, nil of which were carried
to several places by those who had taken them in the fight, in order to
feast upon them, as was done here by these wretchcs upon those they
brought hither.

I caused Friday to gather up all the skulls. bones, flesh, and what-
ever remained, and lay them together in s beep, and make a. great
fire upon it, and burn them all to ashes. I found Friday had still a
hankering stomach after some of the flesh, md was still a cannibal in
his nature; but I discovered so much ubhorrcncc at the very thought
of it, and at the least appearance of it, that he durst not discover it--
fur I had, by some means, let him know that I would kill him if he
ofl'cred it.

When he lied done this we came back to our castle, and there I fell
to work for my man Friday; and, first of all, I gave him a pair of
linen drawers, which I had out of the poor gunner's chest I men-
tioned which I found in the wreck, and which, with a. little ultcrw
tion, fitted him very well, and then I made him a jerkin of goat's
skin. as well as my skill would allow (for I was now grown a toler-
able good tailor), and I gave nun a cap, which I made of nure's skin,
very convenient, and fashionable enough; and thus 31-! was clothed
for the present tolerably well, and was mighty well pleased to see
himself almost as well clothed as his master. It is true, he wentmemos canon. 18'?

awkwardly in those clothes at first; wearing the drawers was very
awkward to him, and the sleeves of the waistcoat galled his shoul-
ders and the inside of his arms, but after a little easing them where
he complained they hurt him, and using himself to them, he took to
them at length very well. i

The next day, after I came home to my hutch with him, I began to
consider where I should lodge him; and that I might do well for him,
and yet be perfectly easy myself; made a little tent for him in the
vacant place between my two fortifications, in the inside of the last
and in the outside of the first. As there was a door or entrance there
into my cave, I made a formal framed doorcase, and a door to it of
boards, and set it up in the passage, 9. little within the entrance; and
causing the door to open in the inside, I barred it up in the night,
taking in my ladders too ; so that Friday could no way come at me in
the inside of my innermost wall, without making so much noise in
getting over, that it must needs \vaken me ; for my first wall had now a
complete roof over it of long poles, covering all my tent, and leaning
up to the side of the hill ; which was again laid across with smaller
sticks, instead of lathe, and than thatched over a great thickness with
the rice straw, which was strong, like reeds; and at the hole or place
which was left to go in or out by the ladder, I had placed a kind of
trap door, which if it had been attempted on the outside, would not
have opened at all, but would have fallen down, and made a great
noise ; as to weapons, I took them all into my side every night. But
I needed none of all this precaution; for never man had a more faith-
ful, loving, sincere servant than Friday was to me ; without passions,
sullenness, or designs, perfectly obliged and engaged--his very afi'ec-
tions were tied to me, like those of a child to a father; and, I dare
say, he would have sacrificed his life for the saving of mine upon any
occasion whatsoever; the many testimonies he gave me of this put it
out of doubt, and soon convinced me that I needed to use no precau.
tions. as to my safety on his account.

This frequently gave me occasion to observe, and that with wonder,
that heu'ever it had pleased God, in his providence, and in the govern-
ment. of the works of his hands, to take from so great a part of the
world of his creatures the best uses to which their faculties and the
powers of their souls are adapted, yet that he has bestowed upon them
the same powers, the same reason, the same affections, the same sen-
timents of kindness and obligation, the same passions and rescntmcnts
of wrongs, the same sense of gratitude, sincerity, fidelity, and all the
capacities of doing good, and receiving good, that he has given tons;188 avenue: or

and that when he pleases to offer them occasions of exerting these
they are as ready, nay, more ready, to apply them to the right uses
for which they were bestowed, than we are. This made me very
melancholy sometimes, in reflecting, as the several occasions present~
ed, how mean a use we make of all these, even though we have these
rowers enlightened by the great lamp of instruction, the Spirit of
God. and by the knowledge of his word added to our understanding ;
and why it has pleased God to hide the like saving knowledge from
so many millions of souls, who, if I might judge by this poor savage,
would make at much hotter use of it than we did. From hence, I
sometimes wasled too for, to invade the sovereignty of Providence;
and as it were urraign the justice of so arbitrary n disposition of
things, that should hide that light. from some and reveal it to others,
and ye: expect a. like duty from hoth ; but I shut it up, and checked
my thoughts with this conclusion : first, that we did not. know by
what light and law these should be condemned ; hut that us God was
necessarily, and hy the nature of his being. infinitely holy and just,so
it could not. he, but, if these creatures were all sentenced to absence
from himself, it was on account of sinning against that light, which,
as the Scripture says: was a law to themselves, and hy such rules as
their consciences would acknowledge to he just, though the linundntion
was not discovered to us ; nnd, secondly, that still, as we all are the
clay in the hand of the potter, no vessel could say to him, " "'hy hunt
then formed me thus 1"

But to return to my new companion :--I was greatly delighted with
him, and made it. my business to teach him everything that was prep~
er to make him useful, handy, and helpful; but especially to make
him speak, and understand me when I spoke; and lie was the aptcst
scholar that ever was; nnd particularly was so merry, so constantly
diligent, and so pleased when he could but understand me, or make
mo ulltln .xl him, that it was very pleasant to me to talk to him.

Idea "Christianity.

I-'TER I had been two or three days returned to my castle, -

thought that in order to bring Friday 03' from his horrid

way of feeding, and from tho relish of a cnnnibnl's stomach,

I ought. to let him taste other flesh; so I took him out with
me one morning to the woods. I went, indeed, intending to kill nkid
out of my own flock, and bring it home and dress it, but as I was going,
I saw a she goat lying down in the shade, and two young kids sitting
by her. I catchcd hold of I" riday--" Hold," said I ; " stand still ;"
and made signs to him not to stir; immediately I presented my piece,
shot, and killed one of the kids. The poor creature, who had, eta
distance, indeed, seen me kill the savage. his enemy, but did not know
nor could imagine how it was done, was sensibly surprised, trembled
and shook, and looked so amazed, that I thought he would have sunk
down. He did not see the kid I shot at, or perceive I had killed it,
but ripped up his waistcoat to feel whether he was not wounilt'tl, and
as I found presently, thought I was resolved to kill him _: {hr he came
and kneeled down to me, and embraced my knees, said a great many
things I did not understand ; but I could easily see the meaning was,
to pray me not to kill him.

I soon found a way to convince him that I would do him no harm ;
and taking him up by the hand, laughed at him, and pointing to the
kid which I had killed, beckoned to him to run and fetch it,which he did ;
and while he was wondering, tuidloo'xiug to see how the creature was
killed, I loaded my gun again. By-nnd-by, I saw a great fowl, like a
hawk, sitting upon n. tree, within shot; so, to let Friday understand a lit-
tle what I would do, I called to him again, pointed at the fowl, which
was indeed :1 1.-arrot, though I thought it had been a howl: ; I say, point.

shoot and kill that bird; accordingly, I fired, and bode him look, and
immediately he saw the parrot full. lie stood like one frightened
again, notwithstanding all i had said to him : and I found he was the
more amazed, because he did not see me put anything into the gun,
but thought that there must be some wonderful fund of death and de-
struction in that thing, able to kill man, beast or bird, or anything190 Abutment: on

could not wear 03' for u long time : and Ihelieve, if I would have let
him, he would havo worshipped me and my gun. As for the gun itself,
he would not so much as touch it for :evcral days after; but he would
speak to it, and talk to it, as if it had answered him, when he was by
himself; which, as I afterward learned of him, was to desire it. not to
kill him. "fell, after his astonishment. was a little over atthia, Ipoint-

a good distance from the place where she fell : however he found her,
took her up, and brought her to me, and as I had perceived hisignor-

and not to let him see me do it, that I might he ready for any other
mark that might, present; but nothing more oflbred at that time; no I
brought home the kid, and the same evening I took the slain oil; and
cut it off as well as 1 could ; and having u. put. lit for that purpose, I
boiled or stewed some of the flesh, and made some very good broth.
After I had begun to eat some, I gave some to my man, who seemed
very glad of it, and liked it very well : hut that which was strangest
to him, was to see me out. salt with it. He made II Sign tome that the
salt was not good to eat: and putting a little into his mouth, he seem-
ed to nauseato it, and would spit and sputter at it, washing his nioluh
with fresh water after it; on the other hand, I took some meat. into
my mouth without salt. and I pretended to spit and sputter for want of
salt, as fast as he had done at. the volt ; but it would not do ; he would
never care for salt with his meat or in his broth; at least not for a
great while, and then but very little.

Ilaving thus fed him with broiled meat and broth, I was resolved
to feast him the next day with roasting a piece of the kid ; this I did,
by hanging it before the fire on a string, as I had seen many people
do in England, setting two poles up, one on each side of the fire, and
one across on the top, and tying the string to tho cross-stick, letting
the meat turn continually. This, Friday admired very much ; hut
when he came to taste the flesh, he took so many ways to tell me how
well he liked it, that I could not understand him; and at last. he told
me, as well as he could, he would never eat man's flesh any more,
which I was very glad to hear.

The next day I set him to work beating some com out, and sitting
it in the manner I used to do, an I observed before ; and he soon un-
derstood how to do it. as well as I, especially after he had seen what
the meaning of it was, and that it was to make bread of it ; for after
that I let him see me make my bread, and bake it too; and in a little
time Friday was able to do all the work for me, as well asI could do
it myself.

I began now to consider, that having two mouths to feed instead of
one, I must provide more ground for my harvest, and plant a larger
quantity of corn than I used to do; so I marked out a larger piece of
land, and began the fence in the same manner as before, in which
Friday worked not only very willingly and very hard, but did it very
cheerfully; and I told him what it was for ; that it was for corn to
make more bread, because he was now with me, and that I might have
enough for him and myself too. He appeared very sensible of that
part, and let me know that he thought I had much more labor upon
me on his account than I had for myself; and that he would work the
harder for me, if I would tell him what to do.

This was the pleasantest year of all the life I led in this place.
Friday began to talk pretty well, and understand the names of almost
everything I had occasion to call for, and of every place I had to
send him to, and talked a great deal to me; so that, in short, l now
began to have some use for my tongue again, which, indeed, I had
very little occasion for before, that is to say, about speech. Besides
the pleasure of talking to him, I had a singular satisfaction in the
fellow himself; his simple, unfoigned honesty appeared to me more
and more every day, and I began really to love the creature; and, on
his side, I believe he loved me more than it was possible for him ever
to love anything before.

I had a mind once to try if he had any hankering inclination to his
own country again; and having taught him English so well that he could
answer me almost any question, I asked him whether the nation that
he belonged to, never conquered in battle 1 At which he smiled, and
said, " Yes, yes, we always fight the better :" that is, he meant, al-
ways get the better in fight; and so we began the following dis-
course :--

Master. You always fight the better? how came you to be taken
prisoner, then, Friday 1

Friday. My nation heat much, for all that.

Illasler. flow heat? If your nation beat them, how came you to be.
taken ?

Friday. They more many than my nation in the place where mo.
was ; they take. one, two, three, and me; my nation overheat them in
the yonder place, where nae no was; there my nation take one, two,
great thousand.
Master. But why did not your side recover you from the hand: of
your enemies, then I .

Friday. They run one, two, three, and me, and make go in the
canoe; my nation have no canoe that time.

Master. Well, Friday, and what does your nation do with the men
they take '! Do they carry them away and eat. them as these did?

Friday. Yes, my nation cat mnns too ; eat all up.

lilaslcr. Where do they carry them 2

Friday. Go to other place, where they think.

Mask-r. Do they come hither?

Friday. Yes, yes, they come hither; some other else place.

Mash-r. Have you been here with them ?

Friday. Yes, 1 have been here; (points to the N. W. side of the
island, which, it seems, was their side.)

By this I understood that my man Friday had formerly been
among the savages who used to Come on shore on the farther part. of
the island, on the same man-eating occasions he was now brought for;
and some time after, when I took the courage to carry him to t nit
side, being the same I formerly mentioned, he presently knew the
place, and toid me he was there once when they eat up twenty men,
two women, and one child; he could not tell twenty in English. hut
he numbered them, by laying so many stones in a row, and pointing
to me to toll them over.

I have told this passage. heeanse it introduces what follows; that
after I had this discourse with him. I asked him how far it was from
our island to the shore, and whether the canoes were not often lost.
[Io tnld me there was no danger, no canoes ever lost; but that, after
a little way out. to sea, there was a current. and wind, always one way
in the morning. the other in the afternoon. This I understood to be
no more than the sets of the tide, as going out or coming in; but I
afterward understood it was occasioned by the great- draft and reflux
of the mighty river Oroonohn, in the mouth or gulfof which river, as
I found afterward, our island lay; and that this land which I per-
ceived to the W. and N. ll'. was the great island of Trinidad, on the

fnorth point of the mouth ofthe river. I asked Friday a thousand
questions about. the country, the inhabitants, the sea, the coast, and
what nations were near; he told me all he knew, with the greatest
openness imaginable. I asked him the names of the several nations
of his sort of penplo,hut get- no other name than Curihs; from whence
he understood, that these were the Carrihees, which our maps place
on the part. of America which reaches from the mouth of the river
Oroonoko to Guiana, and onward to St. Martha. He told me that
up a great way beyond the moon, that was, beyond the setting of the
moon, which must be west from their country, there dwelt white
bearded men, like me, and pointed to my great whiskers, which I
mentioned before; and that they had killed much mans, that was his
word; by all which I understood, he meant the Spaniards. whose
cruelties in America had been spread over the whole country, and
were remembered by all the nations, from father to Ken.

I inquired if he could tell me how I might go from this island and
get among these white men ; he told me, " Yes, yes, you may go in
two canoe." I could not understand what he meant, or make him
describe to me what he meant by two canoe; till, at last, with great
difiiculty, I found he meant it must he in a large boat, as big as two
canoes. This part of Friday's discourse began to relish with me very
well ; and from this time I entertained some hopes that, one time or
other, I might find an opportunity to make my escape from this place,
and that this poor savage might be a means to help me.

Scheme prevented by the Arrival of a Party of Savages.

FTER Friday and I became more intimately acquainted, and

that he could understand almost all I said to him, and speak

pretty fluently, though in broken English, to me, I acquaint-

ed him with my own history, or at least so much of it. as re-

lated to my coming to this place, how I had lired here, and how long.

I let him into the mystery, for such it was to him, of gunpowder and

bullet, and taught him how to shoot. I gave him a knife, which he

was wonderfully delighted with, and I made him a belt with a frog

hanging to it, such as in England we wear hangers in ; and in the

frog, instead of a hanger I gave him a hatchet, which was not only as

good a weapon, in some cases, but much more useful upon other oo-
casions

I described to him the country of Europe, particularly England,

which I came from; how we lived, how we worshipped God, how we

behaved to one another, and how we traded in ships to all parts of

the world. I gave him an account of the wreck which I had been on

9
board of, and showed him, as near ns I could, the place where she
lay, but she was all beaten in pieces before and gone. I showed him
the ruins of our boat, which we lost when we escaped, and which I
could not stir with my whole strength then, but was now fallen almost
all to pieces. Upon seeing this boat Friday stood musing a great
while and said nothing. I asked him what it was he studied upon?
At last, Hays he, " Me see such bout like come to place at my nation."
1 did not understand him n good while, hut at last, when I had ex-
amined farther into it, I understood by him that u. hunt, such as that
had been, came on shore upon the country where he lived ; that is, as
he explained it, was driven thither by stress of weather. I presently
imagined that some European ship must have been cast away upon
their coast, and the heat might get loose :md drive ashore, hut was so
dull that I never once thought of men making their escape from a
wreck thither, much less whcueo they might come, so I only inquired
after a description of the boat.

Friday described the hunt to me well enough, but. brought me het-
ter to understand him when he added, with some warmth, " We save
the white mans from drown." Then I presently asked him if there
were any white mans, as he called them, in the heat. "Yes." he
said, "the hoot full of white mans." I asked him " llow many '3'" lie
told upon his fingers seventeen. I uskeal him then, "What Lee-nine of
them 1" He told me " They live; they dwell at my nation "

This put new thoughts into my head, for l presently imagined that
these might he the men belonging to the ship that was cast away in
the sight ofmy island, as I now called it, and who, after the ship was
struck on the rock, and they saw her inevitably lost, had saved thcm~
selves in their hunt, and were lauded upon that wild shore among the
savages. Upon this 1 inquired of him more critically what was he-
eome of them. He assured me they rtill lived there; that they had
been there about four years; that the-save res let them alone, and
gave them vietuals to live on. I asked him how it new to pass they
did not kill them and eat them. lle said. "' No, they make hrother
with them ;'-' that is, as I understood him, a. truce ; and then he add-
ed, "They no eat mans hut when the war light." That is to say, they
never eat any men but such as come to fight with them, and are taken
in battle.

It was after this some considerable time, that, heiug upon the top
of the hill, at the east side of the island, whence, as I have said I had,
in a clear day, discovered the main, or continent of America, Friday,
the weather being very serene, looks very earnestly toward the main
land, and, in a kind of surprise, falls a jumping and dancing, and calls
out to me, for I was at some distance from him. I asked him "hut.

try: there my nation !" I observed an extraordinary sense of pleasure
nppcnrcd in his face, and his eyes sparkled, and his countenance dis-
covercdn. strange eagerness, as if he hadn. mind to be in his own
country again. This observation of mine put a. grant mony thoughts
into me, which made me at first not so easy about my new mam, Fri-
day, as I was before; and I made no doubt but that if F ridny could
get back to his own notion again, he would not only forget all his re-
ligion but all his obligation to me, and would be {hr-word enough to
give his countrymen an account of me, and come back. perhaps, with
a hundred or two of them, and make it feast upon me, nt uhich he
might be its merry us he used to be with those of his enemies, when
they were taken in war. But I wronged the poor honest creature
very much, for which I was very sorry afterward. However, to; my
jealousy increased, and held me some weeks, I was it little more cir-
cumspect, and not so fnmiliur and kind to him as before ; in "hieh I
was certainly in the wrong, too, the honest gmtefixl creature having
no thought about it but what consisted with the best principles, both
as a. religious Christian and as n. grateful friend, as appeared after-
ward to my full satisfaction.

While my jealousy of him lasted, you may be sure I was every day
pumping him, to see if he would discover nny of the new thoughts
which I suspected were in him, but I found everything he said was
so hone>t and so innocent, that I could find nothing to nourish my
suspicion, and in rpite of all my uneasiness, he made me at lost on-
tirely his own again; nor did he, in the least, perceive that I was
uneasy, and therefore I could not suspect him of deceit.

One day, walking up the some hill, but the wenthcr being hazy at
see, so that we could not see the continent, I called to him and said,
" Friday, do not you wish yourself in your own country, your own my
tion ?" " Yes," he said, " I be much 0 glad to be at my own notion."
" "'hat would you do there 2" said I. 'i Would you turn wild again, out
men's flesh again, and be a. savage, as you were before 1'" He looked full
of coucern,nnd shaking his liend,sai(l, " Nome; Friday tell them to live
good, tell them to pray God, tell them to eat corn bread, cattle flesh,
milk ; no out man again." " Why, then," said I to him, f' they will kill
you." He looked grave at that, und then said, " No, no, they no kill
me, they willing lore learn." He meant by this they would be will-
ing to learn. He added, "They learned much of the bearded mansI90 ammo or

that came in the boat." Then I asked him "if he would go back to
them." He smiled at that, and told me he could not swim so far.
I told him I would make a canoe for him. He told me he would go
it'I would go with him. "I go 7" says I; " why, they will eat mo,
in come there." "No, no," says he; "me make them no eat you;
me make them much love you." He meant he would tell them how
I had killed his enemies and saved his life. and so he would make
them love me. Then he told me, as well as he could, how kind they
were to seventeen white men, or bearded menI as he called thou], who
came ashore there in distress.

From this time I confess I had a. mind to venture over and see if I
could possibly join with those bearded men, who,I made no doubt,
were Spaniards and Portuguese, not doubting hut it'l could we might
[ind some method to escape thence, being upon the Continent, and in a
good company together, better than I could from an island forty miles
03' the shore, and alone. without, help. So, after some days, I took
Friday to work again, by way of discourse, and told him I would give
him a boat to go back to his own nation, and accordingly I carried
him to my frigate, which lay on the other side of the island, and hav-
ing cleared it of water (for I always kept it sunk in water) I brought
it out, showed it him, and we both went into it. I found he wast)
most dexterous fellow at managing> it, and would make it go almost as
swift again as I could. So, when he was in, I said to him, " Well,
now, Friday, shall we go to your nation 1" He looked very dull at
my saying so; which, it seems, was because he thought the heat too
small to go so far; I then told him I had a bigger; so the next day
I went to the place where the first heat lay which I had made, but
which I could not get into the water. He said that was big enough;
but. then, as I had taken no cure of it, and it had lain two or IIII'JS-
ttnd-tvventy years there, the sun had split and dried it that it was in a
manner rotten. Friday told me such a heat would do very well, and
" would carry tnueh enough vittle, drink, bread," that was his way
of talking.

Upon the whole, I was by this time so fixed upon my design of
going over with him to the continent, that I told him we would go
and make one no big as that, and he should go home in it. He an-
swered not one word, but looked very gram and sad. I asked him
what was the matter with him. He asked me again, "Why you
angry mad with Friday 2 \l'hat me done I" I asked him what he
meant. I told him I was not angry with him at all. " No angry I"
says he, repeating the word: several times. " Why send Friday home
away to my nation !" "Why," says I, Friday, " did you not say yes
wished you were there 1" "Yes, yes," says he, " wish be both there,
no wish Friday there, no master there." In a word, he would not
think of going there without me. "I go there, Friday I" says I;
"what shall I do there 2" He returned very quick upon me at this:
" You do great deal much good," says he; " you teach wild mans be
good, sober tame mans; you tell them know God. pray God, and live
new life." "Alas! Friday," says I, "thou knowost not what thou
sayest; Iam but an ignorant man myself." "Yes, yes." says he,
" you teachee me good, you teaches them good." " No, no, Friday,"
says I, "you shall go without me, leave me here to live by myself, as
I did before." He looked confused again at that word, and running
to one of the hatchots which he used to wetir, he takes it up hastily,
and gives it to me. " What must I do with this 3" says I to hint.
"You take kill Friday," says he. " What must I kill you for i" said
I again. Ile returns very quick: " What you send Friday away for!
Take kill Friday, no send Friday away." This he spoke so earnestly,
that I saw tears stand in his eyes: in a word, I so plainly discovered
the utmost afi'eetion in him to me, and a firm resolutiOn in him, that I
told him then, and often after, that I would never send him away
from me, if he was willing to stay with me.

Upon the whole, as I found, by all discourse, a settled afi'ection to
me, and that nothing should part him from me, so I found all the
foundation of his desire to go to his own country was laid in his
ardent affection to the people, and his hopes of my doing them good;
a thing, which as I had no notion of myself, so I had not the least
thought, or intention, or desire of undertaking. But still I found a
strong inclination to my attempting an escape, as above, founded on
the supposition gathered from the discourse, viz., that there were
seventeen bearded men there ; and, therefore, without any more delay,
I wont to work with Friday, to find out a great tree proper to fell,

nd make a large periagua or canoe, to undertake the voyage.
There were trees enough in the island to have built a little fleet, not
of peringuas, or canoes, but even of good largo vessels; but the main
thing] looked at was, to get one so near the water that we might
launch it when it was made, to avoid the mistake I committed at
first. At lust, Friday pitched upon a tree; for I found he knew much
better than I what kind of wood was fittest for it ; nor can I tell, to
this day, what wood to call the tree we cut down, except that it was
very like the tree we call fustic, or between that and the Nicaragua
wood, for it was much of the same color and smell. Friday was for
burning the hollow or cavity of this tree out, to make it for a bong
but I showed him how to cut it with tools; which, after I had showed
him how to use, he did very handily : and in about a month's hard
labor, we finished it, and made it very handsome; especially when,
with our axes, which I showed him how 'to handle, we cut and bowed
the outside into the true shape of a boat. After this, however, it coat
us near a tin-(night's time to get her along, as it were inch hy inch,
upon greatrullcrs, into the water, but when she was in, she would
hare carried twenty men with great ease.

When she was in the water, and though she was so big, it amazed
me to see with what dexterity and how swift my man Friday would
manage her, turn her, and paddle her along. So I asked him if he
would, and if we might, venture orer in her. "Yes," he said ; " we
venture over in her very well, though great blew wind." llowerer,
I had a further design, that he knew nothing of, and that was to make
a mast and a sail, and to fit. her with an anchor and cable. As to u
must, that was easy enough to get: so I pitched upon a straight young
cedar tree, which I found near the place, and which there were a
great plenty of in the island, and I act Friday to work to cut it down,
and gave him directions how to shape and order it. But as to the
soil, that was my particular care. I knew I bad old sails. or rather
pieces of old sails enough, but as I had had them now six-and-twenty
years by me, and not been very careful to preserve them, not imagin.
ing that I should ever have this kind of use for them, I did not doubt
but that they were all rotten, and, indeed, most of them were so.
Ilnwcver,I found two pieces which appeared pretty good, and with
these I went to work, and with a great deal of pains and awkward
stitching, you may be sure, for want of needles, I at length made a
three-cornered ugly thing, like what we call in England a shoulder-
of-mutton sail, to go with a boom at bottom, and a little short sprit at
the top, such as usually our ship's long-boats sail with, and such as I
best. knew how to manage; as it was such a one I had to the boat in
which I made my escape from Barbary, as related in the first part of
my story.

I was near two months performing this last work, ri7.., rigging and
fitting my mast and sails, for I finished them very complete, making
a small stay, and a sail or foresail to it, to assist, if we should turn to
windward; nnd,whieh was more than all. I fixed a rudder to the stern
of her to steer with. I was but- a bungling shipwright, yet as I knew
the usefulness and even necessity of such a thing, I applied myself
with so much pains to dc it that at last I brought it to pass; though
considering the many dull contrivanees I had for it that failed, Ithink
it cost me almost as much labor as making the boat.

After all this was done, I had my man Friday to teach as to what
belonged to the navigation of my boat, for though he knew very well
how to paddle a cnnoe, he knew nothing what belonged to a sail and
a rudder, and was the most amazed when he saw me work the boat
to and again in the sea by the rudder, and how the sail jibed, and
filled this way or that way, as the course we sailed changed; I say,
when he saw this, he stood like one astonished and amazed. However,
with a little use, I made all these things familiar to him, and he be-
came an expert sailor, except that, as to the compass, I could make
him understand very little of that. On the other hand, as there was
very little cloudy weather, and seldom or never any fogs in those parts,
there mm the loss occasion for a compass, seeing the stars were
always to be seen by night, and the shore by day, except in the rainy
seasons, and then nobody cared to stir abroad, either by land or sea.

I was now entered on the seven-nud-twentieth year of my captivity
in this place, though the three last years that I had this creature with
me ought rather to he left out of the account, my habitation being
quite of another kind than in nll the rest of the time. I kept the anni-
versary of my landing here with the some thankfulnesn to God for
his mercies, as at first; and if I had such cause of acknowledgment
at first, I had much more so now, having such additional testimonies
of the care of providence over me, and the great hopes I had of being
effectually and speedily delivered; for I had an invincible imprCSo
sion upon my thoughts that my deliverance was at hand and that I
should not be another year in this place. I went on, however, with
my husbandry, digging, planting, and fencing, as usual. I gathered
and cured my grapes, and did every necessary thing as before.

The rainy season was, in the meantime, upon me, when I kept more
within doors than at other times. We had stowed our own vessel as
secure as we could, bringing her up into the creek, where, as I said,
in the beginning, I landed my rafts from the ship ; and hauling her
up to the shore, at higlnwnter mark. I made my man Friday dig a
little dock, just big enough to hold her, and just deep enough to give
her water enough to float in; and then, when the tide was out, we
made a strong dam acrom the end of it. to keep the water out; and
so she lay dry, as to the tide. from the sea; and to keep the rain off,
We laid a. great many boughs of trees, so thick, that she was as well
thatched as a house; and thus we waited for the months of Norm
her and December, in which I designed to make my adventure.
When the settled season began to come in, as the thought of my
design returned with the fair weather, I was preparing daily for the
voyage, and the first thing I did was to lay Ly a certain quantity of
yn'orisiona, being the stores for our voyage; and intended, in a Week
or fortnight's time, to open the dock, and launch out our boat. I was
busy one morning upon something of this kind, when I called to Fri-
day, and hid him go to the seashore, and see if he could find a turtle,
or tortoise, a thing which we generaliy got once a. week, for the sake
of the eggs as well as the flesh. Friday had not, been long gone
when he came running hack, and flew over my outer wall, or fence,
like one that felt. not the ground, or the steps he set his feet. on ; and
before I had time to speak to him, he cries out to me, " 0 master 5 0
master! 0 sorrow! 0 had I" " What's the matter, Friday T' says I.
" Oh, yonder there," says he, " one, two, three, canoe _: ouc,two, three I"
By this way of speaking, I concluded there were six; hut. on inquiry,
I found it was hut three. " \Vell, Friday." says I, " do not he fright.
ened l" So I heartened him up as well as I cmdl; however, I saw the
poor fellow was most terribly seared ; for nothing ran in his head hat
that. they were co no to look for him, and would cut. him in pieces,
and eat. him; and the poor fellow trembled so, that Iscarue knew
what to do with him. I comforted him as well as I could, and told
him I was in as mueh danger as he, and that they would eat. me as
well as him. But, says I, " Friday, we must remlvo to fight, them.
Can you fight, Friday ?" " Me shoot," says he ; " butthero come many
great number." " No matter for that," said I, again; " our guns will
{right them that. we do not kill." So I asked him whether, if I resol-
ved to defend him he would defend me, and stand hy me; and dojust
asI hid him. He said, "Me die, when you hid die, master." So I
went and fetched a good dram of rum and gave him; for I had heen
so good a husband of my rum, that I had a. great deal left. When he
drank it, I made him take the two fouling-pieces, which we always
carried, and loaded them with large swan shot, as big as small yistol-
bullets; then I took four muskets, and loaded them with two slugs
and five small bullets each ; and my two ].istolsl loaded with a brace
of bullets each; I hang my great sword, as usual, naked lvy my
side; and gave Friday his hatchet. When I had thus prepared my-
self, I took my perspective glass, and went up to the aide of the hill,
to see what I could discover ; and I found quickly, by my glass, that.
there were one-and-twenty savages, three prisoners, and three canoes,
and that their whole business seemed to he the triumphant banquet
upon these three human bodies; a barbarous feast, indeed! but noth-
ing more then, 331 had observed, was usual with them. I observed,
also, that they were landed, not where they had done when Friday
made his escape, but. nearer to my creek: where the shore wns lowI
and where n thick wood cume ulmost close down to the sen. '1' his,
with the nlnhorreuee of the inhuman errand these wretches came about,
tilled me with such indignation, that I come down again to Friday,
and told him I was resolved to go down to them and kill them all;
and nsked him if he would stand by me. He had now get over his
fright, and his spirits being :1 little raised with the drum 1 had given
him, he was very cheerful, and told me, as before, he would " die when
I bid die."

In this fit of fury, I took and divided the arms which I had charged,
an hetero, between us ; I gave Friday one pistol to stick in his girdle,
and three guns upon his shoulder; nnd I took one pistol, and the
other three guns myself; and in this posture we marched not. I took
a small bottle of rum in my pocket, and gave Friday a large bag
with more powder and bullets; and as to orders, I charged him to
keep close behind me, and not to stir or shoot, or do anything, till I
bid hint ; und in the meantime, not to speak a. word. In this posture,
I fetched a compass to my right hand of near a. mile, us well to get
over the creek as to get into the wood, so that I might come within
shot of them before I should he discovered, which I hud seen by my
glass, it was easy to do.

While Iwos melting this march, my former thoughts returning, I
begun to nbnte my resolution; I do not mean that I entertained any
fear of their number 3 for, as they were naked, unarmed \vretches. it
was ce:toin I was superior to them; my, though I had been alone.
But it occurred to my thoughts, what cull, what occasion, much less
what necessity I was in, to go and dip my hands in blood, to attack
people who had neither done nor intended me any wrong; .who, as
tome, were innocent, and whose barbarous customs were their own
disaster; being in them, a token indeed of God's having left them.

end to such inhuman courses, but did not cull me to take upon me to
be e judge of their actions, much less on executioner of his justice;
that whenever he thought fit, he would take the cause into his own
hands, and, by national vengeance, punish them, as u people, for no.-
tieual crimes; but that, in the meantime, it was none of my business;
that it was true, Friday might justify it, because he was a. declared
enemy, end in a. state of war with those very particular people, and it
was luwt'ul for him to attack them; but I could not say the some with

respect to myself. These things were so warmly pressed upon my
thoughts oil the way as I went, that. I resolred I would go and place
myself near them, that. I might observe their barbarous feast, end that
1 would out. then as God should direct; but that unless nomething
oti'ered that was more it cull to me than yet I knew of, I would tu.l.
tneddle with them.

With this resolutionI entered the wood; and, with all possible
wuriness and hilCllCC, Friday ftdlowed close at my heels, 1 marehed
till I came to the skirt of the wood, on the side which was next to
them, only that one corner of the wood, lay between me and them.
Here l called softly to Friday, and showing him a great tree, which
was just at. the corner of the wood, I hndu him go to the tree. and
bring me word if he could see there plainly what they were doing.

IIAD now not o moment to lose, for nineteen of the dreadful
wretehos set upon the ground, all closely huddled together
and had just sent the other two to butcher the poor Christian,
and bring him, perlmps limb by limb, to their lire ; end they
were steeping down to untie the bands at his feet. I turned to Fri-
day--"Now, Friday," said I, " do as I bid thee." Friday said he
would. " Then, Friday," says I, 'i do exactly as you see me do ; fail
in nothing." Sol set down one of the mnskets and the fowliug-pieee
upon the ground, and Friday did the like by his _: and with my other
musket I took my aim at the savages, bidding him to do the like;
then asking him if he wns ready, he said " Yes." " Then fire at
them," said I _: and the some moment 1 tired also.

Friday took his aim so much better than I, that on the side that he
shot, he killed two of them, and wounded three more; and on my
side, I killed one, and wounded two. They were, you may be sure,
in a dreadful consternation; and all of them who were not hurt
jumped upon their feet, but did not immediately know which way to
run, or which way to look, for they knew not from whence their de-
strnotion came. Friday kept his eyes close upon me, that, as I had
bid him, he might observe whnt I did ; so, as soon as the first shot
was made, I threw down the piece, and took up the fowling-piece,
and Friday did the like; he saw me cock and present; he did the
same again. "' Are you ready, Friday?" said I. " Yes," says he.
" Let fly, then," says I, "in the name of God !'~' And with that, I
fired again among the amazed wretches, and so did Friday; and as
our pieces were now loaded with what I coll swan-shot, or small pis-
tol bullets, we found only two drop, but so many \\ ere wounded, th'tt
they ran about yelling and screaming like mod creatures, all bloody
and most miserably wounded, whereof three more fell quickly afier,
though not quite dead.

"New, Friday," says I, laying down the discharged pieces, and
taking up the musket which was yet loaded, " follow me," which he
did, with a great deal of courage; upon which I rushed out of the
wood, and showed myself. and Friday close at my foot. As soon as I
perceived they saw me, I shouted as loud as I could, and bade Friday
do so too; and running as fast as I could, which, by the way, was
not very fast, being loaded with arms as I was, I made directly
toward the poor victim, who was, as I said, lying upon the bench, or
shore, between the place they sat and the sea. The two hoteliers,
who were just going to work with him, had left him at the snrprire
of our first fire, and fled at a terrible fright. to the sea-side, and
jumped into a canoe, and three more of the rcstnmdo the snmc'wny.
I turned to Friday, and hado him step forward, and fire at them; he
understood me immediately, and running nhont forty yards, to he
nearer them, he shot. at theta, and I thought he had killed them all,
for I new them all full of tl heap into the heat, though I saw two of
them up again quickly; however, he killed two of them. and wounded
the third, so that. he lay down in the bottom of the boat as if he had
been dead. .

While my man Friday fired at. them, I pulled out. my knife, and cut
the flags that hound the poor victim; and loosing his hands and feet,
I lifted him up, and asked him in the Portuguese tongue, what- he
was. He answered in Latin, "Christimuzsz" hut was so weak and
faint that he could scarce Hand or speak. I took my hottle out ofmy
pocket, r.nd gave it him, making signs that he should drink, which he
did; and l gore him a piece of bread, which he me. Then I aahed
him what countryman he was; and he mid, Eepngniole ; and heing a

hurt they received, no the other two fell with the fright.

I kept my piece intmv hand still without tiring, heing willing to
keep my charge readnyecause I had given the Spaniard my pistol
and sword; so I called to Friday, and bade him run up to the tree

A."
from whence we first fired, and fetch the arms which lay there
that had been discharged, which he did with great swil'tness; and
then giving him my musket, I sat down myself to load all the rest
again. and bade them come to me when they wanted. While I was
loading these pieces, there happened a fierce engagement between the
Spaniard and one of the savages, who made at him with one of their
great wooden swords, the same-like weapon that was to have killed
him before, if I had not prevented it. The Spaniard, who was us hold
and bravo as could be imagined, though weak, had fought this Indian
3 good while, and had cut him two good wounds on his head ; but the
savage being a stout, lusty fellow, closing in with him, had thrown
him down, being faint, and was wringing my sword out of his hand;
when the Spaniard, though under-most, wisely quitting the sword,
drew the pistol from his girdle, shot. the savage through the body,
and killed him upon the spot, before I, who was running to help him,
could come near him.

Friday being now left to his liberty, pursued the flying wretches,
with no weapon in his hand but his hatchet; and with that he dis-
patched those three, who, as I said before, were wounded at first, and
fallen, and all the rest he could come up with; and the Spaniard
coming to me for a gun, I gave him one of the fowling pieces, with
which he pursued two of the savages, and wounded them both ; but,
as he was not able to run, they both got from him into the wood.~
where Friday pursued them. and killed one of them, but the other
was too nimble for him; and though he was wounded, yet he plunged
himself into the sea, and swam, with all his might, off to those two
who were left in the canoe, which three in the canoe, with one
wounded, that we knew not whether he died or on, were all that es-
caped our hands of ouo-and-twenty. The account of the whole is as
follows: three killed at our first shot from the tree; two killed at the
next shot; two killed by Friday in the boat: two killed by Friday of
those at first wounded; one killed by Friday in the wood; three
killed by the Spaniard; four killed, being found dropped here and
there of their wounds, or killed by Friday in his chase of them; four
escaped in the boat, whereof one wounded, if not dead. Twenty-one
in all.

Those that were in the canoe worked hard to get out of gunshot,
and though Friday made two or three shots at them I did not find
that he hit any of them. Friday would fain hard had me take one of
thoir canoes and pursue them; and, indeed, I was very anxious about
their escape, lest, carrying the news home to their pPQple, they should

come back, perhaps with two or three hundred of the canoes, and do.
vour us by more multitude, so I consented to pursue them by sea, and
running to one of the canoes I jumped in, end bndo Friday follow me,
but when l was in the canoe I was surprised to find another poor
creature lio there, hound hand and foot. as the Spaniard was, for the
slaughter, and almost dead with fear, not knowing what was the mat-
ter, for he had not been able to look over the side of the boat; he was
tied so hard neck and heels, and had been tied so long, that he had
really but little life in him.

I immediately cut the twisted flogs or rushes which they hnd bound
him with, and would have helped him up, but he could not stand or
speak, but groxmed most piteously, believing. it seems still, that he
wns only unbound in order to be killed. \Vhen Friday came to him
I bode him speak to him and tell him of his deliverance, and pulling
out my bottle, made him give the poor wretch a drum ; which, with
the news of his being delivered, revived him, and he sat up in the
hoot. But when Fridny come to hear him speak, and look in his face,
it would have moved any one into tours to have seen how l-'ridoy
kissed him, embraced him, hugged him, cried, laughed, hnllooed,
jumped about, danced, sung, then cried :tgnin, wrung his handu, beat
his own time and head, and then sung and jumped about again. like a
distracted creature. It was It good while before I could mnke him
speak tome or tell me wlmt was the matter, but when he come a
little to himself he told me that it was his father.

It is not easy for me to express how it moved me to see what
ecstasy and filinl affection lmd worked in this poor snvogo at the sight
of his father, and on his being delivered from death; nor, indeed, can
I describe half the extrm-ngunces of his ufl'ection after this, for He
went into the bent and out of the bout it great many times. When he
went into him he would sit down by him, open his breast, andhold
his father's head close to his bosom for many minutes together, to
nourish it; then he took his arms and nnkles, which were numbed
ond stifi' with the binding, and chufed and rubbed them with his
hands, and l, perceiving what the case was, gave him some rum out
of my bottle to ruh them with, which did them it great deal of good.

This nfl'nir put an end to our pursuit of the canoe with the other
savages, who were got now almost out of sight; end it was happy for
us that we did not, for it blew so hard, within two hours after, and
before they could he got a quarter of their way, and continued blow-
ing so hnrd nll night, and that from the northwest, which was against

them, that l could not suppose their boot could live, or that they ever
reached their own coast.
But, to return to Friday; he was so busy about his father that I
could not find in my heart to take him off for some time, but after I
thought he could leave him a little I called him to me, and he came
jumping and laughing, and pleased to the highest extreme; then I
asked him if he had given his father any bread. He shook his head
and said, " None; ugly dog out all up self." I then gave him a cake
of bread out of a. little pouch I carried on purpose : I also gave him
a dram for himself. but he would not taste it, but carried it to his
father. I had in my pocket two or three bunches of raisins, so I gave
him n handful of them for his father. He had no sooner given his
father these raisins but I saw him come out of the boat and run away,
as if he had been hewitehcd, he ran at such arnte, for he was the
swiitest follow on his feet that ever I saw. I say, he ran at such a
rate that he was out of sight, as it were, in an instant, and though I_
called, and hallooed out, too, after him, it was all one way, away he
went ; and, in a quarter of an hour I saw him come back again,
though not so fast as he went, and as he came nearer I found his pace
slacker, because he had something in his hand. "Then he came up
to me I found he had been quite home for an earthen jug or pet, to
bring his father some fresh water, and that he had two more cakes or
loaves of bread ; the bread he gave me, but the water he carried to
his father; however, as I was very thirsty, too, I took a little sup of
it. The water revived his father more than all the rum or spirits I
had given him, for he was just fainting with thirst.

When his father had drunk I called to him to know if there was
any water left; he said " Yes," and I bade him give it to the poor
Spaniard, who was in as much want of it as his father; and I sent
one of the cakes that Friday brought to the Spaniard, too, who was
indeed very weak, and was reposing himself upon a green place under
the shade of a tree, and whose limbs were also very stiti', and very
much swelled with the rude bandage he had been tied with. When
I saw that, upon Friday's coming to him with the water, he sat up
and drunk, and tool: the bread and hogan to eat, I went to him and
gave him a handful of raisins. He looked up in my face with all the
tokens of gratitude and thankfulness that could appear in any coun-
tenance. but was so weak. notwithstanding he had so exerted himself
in the fight, that he could not stand upon his feet; he tried to do it
two or three times. but was really not able. his ankles were so swelled
and so painful to him, so I bade him sit still, and caused Friday to rub
his ankles and bathe them with rum, as he had done his father's.

I observed the poor affectionate creature, every two minutes, on
perhaps less, all the while he was here, turn his head about to see if
his father was in the some place and posture us he lelt him tilting;
and at last he found he was not to be men, ut which he started up,
and without Rpcttlilllg 0. word, new with that swifmcas to him that one
could scarce perceive his feet to touch the ground as he went; but
when he come, he only found he had laid himself down to case his
lim'u, so Friday came back to me presently; and then 1 spoke to the
Simuhn'd to let Friday help him up if he could, and lead him to the
btlJt' and then he should curry him to our dwelling, where I would
take eztro of him; but 1" riduy, a lnuty, strong fellow, took the Spou-
izu-d quite upon his book, and carried him away to the boat, and set
him down softly upon the aide or guunt'l of the canoe, with his feet
in the inside of it, and then lifting him quite in, he set. himself close
to his father, and presently stepping out again launched the hoot off,
and paddled it nlong the shore faster thun I could walk, though the
wind blew pretty hnrd, too: so he brought them both safe into our
creek, and leaving them in the boat, run away to fetch the other
canoe. As he passed me I spoke to him, and usde him whither he
went. lle told me, "Go fetch more bout. ;" so away he went like the
wind, for sure never mun or horse run like him, and he had the other
canoe in the creek almost as soon as I got to it by lnud ; so he wnftcd
me over, and then went to help our new guests out ot'the boat, which
he did, but they were neither of them able to walk, so that poor l'ri-
day knew not what to do.

To remedy this I wont to work in my thoughts, nnd calling to Fri-
dny to bid them sit down on tho hank while he came to me, I soon
made a kind of u hand-barrow to lay them on, and Friday and 1 cut--
ried them both up together upon it, Letwcon us. But when we {rot
them to the outside of our wall or fortificntion, we were at a worse
loss than before, for it was impossible to get them 0\'er,aud I was re-
solved not to break itdown. So I set to work again, and Friday and
I, in about two huura' time, made It very handsome tent, covered with
old sails, and above that with houghs of trees, being in the apnce
without our oetwurd fence, and hetweon thnt and the grove of young
\voml which I had planted ; nnd here we made them two beds of such
things as I had. \'iz., of good rice straw, with blankets laid upon it to
lie on, and another to cover them, on each bed.

My island wns now peopled, and Ithought myself rich in subjects;
and it unis :v. merry reflection, which I frequently made. how like it
king I l:1t)l{t'\l. First of all, the whole country was my own more
property, so that I had an undoubted right of dominion. Secondly,
my people were perfectly subjected; I was absolutely lord and Law-
giver; they all owed their lives to me, nnd were ready to lay down
their lives, if there had been occasion for it, for me. Is was remark-
able, too, I had but three subjects, and they were of three difi'erent
religions; my man Friday was 0. Protestant; hie father was a Pagan
and it cannilntl, and the Spaninrd was at I'apist ; l:owevcr,l allowed
liberty of conscience throughout my doniinions. But this is hy the
way.

As soon as I had secured my two weak rescued prisoners, and given
them shelter, and a place to rest them upon, I began to think of
making some provision for them; and the first thing I did, I ordered
F ridny to take it yearling gout, betwixt. n kid and a goat, out of my
particnlur flock, to be killed; when I cut off the binder quarter, and
chopping it into small pieces,~ I set Friday to work to boiling and
stevring. and made them a very good (lle'll, I assure you, of flesh and
broth, having put some barley and rice also into the broth ; and no I
cooked it without doors, forI made no fire within my inner wall, so I
carried it nil into the new tent, and having set a table there for them,
I sat down, and ate my dinner nlso with them, and, as well as I
could, cheered them, and encouraged them. Friday was my inter-
preter, etilzclzlfllly to his father, and, indeed, to the Spaniard, too; for
the Spaniard spoke the language of tho outages pretty well,

Afler we had dined, or rather snppcd,l ordered Friday to take one
of the cnnoes, and go tenth our muskets and other firearms, which, for
want of time, we had left upon the place of battle; end, the next day,
I ordered him to go and bury the dead lsodies of the savages, which
lay open to the sun, and would presently he ofl'ensirc. I also order.
ed him to bury the horrid remains of their ban-barons feast, which
I knew were pretty much, and which I could not think of doing my-
self; nay, I could not hear to ace them, if I went that way ; all which
he punctually performed, and efl'aced the very appearance of the
savages living there; so that when I went again, I could scarce know
where it was, otherwise than by the corner of the wood pointing to
the place.

I then began to enter into a little conversation with my two new
subjects; and, first, I set Friday to inquire of his titthcr what he
thought of the escape of the savages in that canoe, and whether we
might expect a return of them, with a power too great for us to re-
sist. His first opinion was, that the savages in the boat could never
live out the storm which blew that night they went off, but must of
necessity be drowned, or driven south to those other shores, where
they were as sure to be devoured on they were to be drowned, if they
were cast away ; but, as to what they would do, if they came safe on
shore, he said he knew not ; but it. was his opinion, that they were so
dreadfully frightened with the manner of their being attacked, the
noise, and the tire, that he believed they would tell the people they
were all killed by thunder and lightning, not hy the hand of man ;
and that the two which appeared, viz., Friday and I, were two heav-
enly spirits, or furies, come down to destroy them, and not men with
weapons. This, he said, he knew ; because he heard them all cry out
so, in their language one to another; for it was impossible for them
to conceive that. a man could dart fire, and speak thunder, and kill at
a distance, without lifting up the hzunl, as was done now; and this old
savage was in the right; for, as I understood since, by other handn,
the savage: never attempted to go over to the island afterward, they
were so terrified with the accounts given Ly those. four men (for, it
seems, they did escape the sea), that they holieved whoever went to
that enchanted island would he destroyed by fire from the gods. This,
however, I lmew not; and therefore was under continual apprehen-
sions for a good while, and kept always upon my guard, with all my
army; for, as there were new four of us, I would have ventured upon
a hundred of them, fairly in the open field, at any time.

In a little time, however, no more canoes appearing, the four of
their coming wore 011'; and I began to take my former thoughts of a.
voyage to the main into consideration; being likewise assured, hy
Friday's father, that I might depend upon good usage from their
nation, on his account, it'I would go. But my thoughts were a little
suspended when I had a serious discourse with the Spaniard, and.
when I understood that there were sixteen more of his countryman
and Portuguese, who, having hecn cast away, and made their escape to
that. side, lived there at peace, indeed, with the savages, but were very
in r: put to it for necessaries, and indeed for life. I asked him all the
particulars of their voyage, and found they were a Spanish ship,
hound from the Rio de la Plata, to the Havana, being directed to leave
their loading there, which was chiefly hides and silver. and to bring
hack what European goods they could meet with there ; that they had
five Portuguese seamen on board, whom they took out of another
wreck; that fire of their own men were drowned, when first the ship
was lost. and that these escaped through infinite dangers and hazards,
and arrived, almost. starred, on the cnnnihal coast, where they ex~
peoted to have been devoured every moment. He told me they had
some arms with them, but they were perfectly useless, for that theymamas CRUSOI. 211

had neither powder nor hall, the washing of the non having spoiled
all their powder, but a little, which they used at their firstlnnding, to
provide themselves some food.

I asked him what he thought would become of them there, and if
they had formed no design ot'makiug any escape. He said they had
many consultations about it, but that having neither vessel, nor tools
to build one, nor prmisions cfany kind, their councils always ended
in tears and despair. I asked him how he thought they would re-
ceive a proposal from me, which might tend toward an escape; and
whether, it they were all here, it might not he done. I told him with
freedom, I feared mostly their treachery and ill usage of me, if I put
my life in their hands, for that gratitude was no inherent virtue in the
nature of man, nor did men always square their dealings hy the ohli--
gations they had received, so much as they did by the advantages they
expected. I told him it would he very hard that I should he the in-
szrumeut of their deliverance, and that they should afterward make
me their prisoner in New Spain, where an Englishman was certain to
he made a sacrifice, what necessity, or what accident scorer brought
him thither; and that I had rather he delivered up to savages, and he
devoured alive, than fall into the merciless claws of the priests, and
he carried into the Inquisition. I added, that otherwise I was per-
suaded, if they were all here, we might, with so many hands, build
a hark large enough to carry us all away, either to the Brazils,
southward, or to the islands, or Elianish coast, northward ; hut that if,
in requital, they should, when I had put weapons into their hands,
carry me by force among their own peoplml mighthe ill used for my
kindness to them, and make my case worse than it was hefore.

He answered with a great deal of candor and ingenuousucss, that
their condition was so miserable, and they were so scusihlo of it, that
he helievod they would ahhor the thought of using any man unkiudly
that should contribute to their deliverance; and that, if I pleased, he
would go to them with the old man, and discourse with them about
it, an-l return again, and hring me their answer; that he would make
conditions with them upon their solemn oath, that they should he ab-
solutely under my leading, as their commander and captain: and that
they should swear upon the holy sacraments and gospel, to he true to
me, and go to such Christian country as I should agree to, and no
other, and to he directed wholly and absolutely hy my orders, till
they were landed safely in such country as I intended; and that he
would bring a contract from them, under their hands, for that pur-
pose. Then he told me he would first swear to me himself, that he
would never stir from me as long as he lived, till I gave him orders.
and that he would take my side to the last drop of his blood, it' thero
should happen the least breach of faith among his countrymen. He
told me they were all very civil, honest men, and they were under the
greatest. distress imaginable, having neither weapons, nor clothes, nor
any food, but at the mercy and discretion of the savages; out of all
hopes of ever returning to their own country; and that he was sure,
if I would undertake their relief, they would live and die by me.

Upon these assurances, I resolved to venture to relieve them if pos-
sible, and to send the old savage and thin Spaniard over to them to
treat. But when we got all things in readiness to go, the {paniard
himself, started an objection, which had so much prudence in it, on
one hand, and so much sincerity, on the other hand, that I could not
he very well satisfied in it; and, hy his advice, put off the deliverance
of his comrades for at least half a year. The case was thus : lle had
been with us now about a month, during which time, I had let. him see
in what manner I had provided, with the assistance of Providence, for
my support; and he saw evidently what stock of corn and rice I had
laid up; which, though it was more than sufficient for myself, yet it
was not sufficient, without good husbandry, for my family, now it, was
increased to four; but much less would it. he sumcient if his country-
men, who were, as he said, sixteen, still alive, should come over ; and
least of all would it be sufficient to virtual our vessel, it' we should
build one. for a voyage to any of the Christian colonies of America ;
so he told me he thought it would he more advisable to let him and
the other two dig and cultivate more land, as much as I could spare
seed to sow, and that we should wait another harvest, that we should
have a supply of corn for his countrymen, when they should eoine;
for want might be a temptation to them to disagree, or not. to think
themselves delivered, otherwise than out of one difficulty into another.
"You know," says he, "' the children of Israel, though they rejoiced
first for lacing delivered out of Egypt, yet rebelled even against God
himself, that. delivered them, when they came to want bread in the
wilderness."

Ilia caution was so seasonahle, and his voice so good, that I could
not but he very well pleased with his proposal, as well as I was satis-
fied with his fidelity ; so we fell to digging, all four of us, as well as
the wooden tools permitted ; and in about a month's time, by the end
of which it was seed-time, we had got. as much land cured and trim-
med up as we sowed two-and-twenty bushels of barley on, and sixteen
jars of rice ; which was, in short, all the seed we had to spare ; nor,man m <

indeed, did we leave ourselves barley sufficient for our food, for the
six months that we had to expect our crop; that is to soy, reckoning
from the time we set. our seed aside for sowing ; for it is not to be
supposed itis six months in the ground in that country.

Having new society enough, and our number being suliicient to put
us out of the fear of the savages if they had come, unless their num
her had been very great, we went freely all over the island, whenever
we found occasion mud as here we had our escape or deliverance upon '
our thoughts it was impossible, at. least for me, to have the means of
it out of mine. For this purpose, I marked out several trees which I
thought tit for our work, and I set Friday and his father to cutting
them down; and then I caused the Spaniard, to whom I imported
my thought on that uii'uir, to oversee and direct their work. Ishowed
them with what indefatigable puius I had hewcd a large tree into sin-
gle planks, and caused them to do the like, till they had made about
a dozen large planks of good ouk, near two feet. broad, thirty-five feet
long, and from two inches to four inches thick; \vhut prodigious labor
it. took up, any one may imagine.

At the some time, I contrived to increase my little flock of tame
goats us much as I could; and for this purpose, I made Friday and
the Spaniard go out one day, and myself with Friday the next day
(for we took our turns), and by this means we got. about twenty young
kida to breed up with the rest: for whenever we shot the dam, we
saved the kids, and added them to our fioc". But, above all, the sea.-
son for curing the grapes coming on, I caused such a prodigious
quantity to be hung up in the sun, that, I believe, had we been at
Alieant, where the raisins of the sun are cured, we could have filled
sixty or eighty barrels; and these, with our bread, was n great part
of our food, and was it very good living, too, I assure you, for it. is
exceedingly nourishing.

It was now harvest. and our crop in good order ;it was not the most
plentiful increase I had seen in the island, but however. it wus enough to
answer our end; for from twenty-two bushels of barley we brought in
and thrashed out nhove two hundred and twenty bushels, and the like
proportion of the rive; which was: store enough for out-food to the nest
harvest, though all the sixteen Spaniards had been on shore with me ; or
ifwo had been ready fora. voyage, it would very plentifiilly have victimi-
led our ship to have carried us to any part. ofthe world, that is to say
any port. of America. \'i'hen we had thus housed and secured our mag-
azine of corn,we f ell to Work to make more wickeru'are, viz.,groat baskets
in which we kept it ; and the Spaniard was very handy and dexterous
at this part, and oflan blamed me that I did not make some thing- for
defence of this kind of work; but I saw no need of it.

And now, Inning a full supply of food for all the guests I expected
I gave the Spaniard leave to go over to the main, to see what he could
do with those he had left behind him there. I gave him a strict
charge not to bring any man with him who would not first swear in
the presence of himself and the old savage, that he would no way in-
jure, light with, or attack the person he ehonld find in the island, who
was so kind as to send for them in order to their deliverance; but
that they would stand by him, and defend him against all such at-
tempt-s, and wherever they went, would be entirely under and subject-
ed to his command ; and that this should he put in writing, and signed
with their hands. llow they were to have done this, whonl knew
they had neither pen nor ink, was a question which we never naked.
Under these inxtrnctinna, the Spaniard and the old savage, the father
of Friday, went away in one of the canoes which they might be said
to come in, or rather were hrought in, when they came as prisoners to
he devoured by tho savages. I gave each of them a musket, with a
fireloek on it, and about, eight charges of powder and ball, charging
them to he rery good husbands 01' both, and not to use either of them
but. upon urgent. occasions.

This was a cheerful work, being the first measures used by me, in
View of my deliverance. for now twenty-seven years and some days.
1 gave them provisions of bread, and of dried grapes, suilieient for
thenn-elves for many days, aml sutlieicnt for all the Spaniards for
about eight days' time; and wishing them a good voyage, I saw them
go: agreeing with them about. a signal that they should hang out at
their return, by which X should know them again, when they came
hack, at a dist.am~e,ln-t'ore they came on shore. They went away with
a fair gale, on the day that. the moon was full, liy my account in the
month of October: but as for an exact reclwning.r of days after 1 had
once lost it, 1 could never recover it again: nor had I kept even the
munher of years so punctually as to he sure I was right ; though, as
it proved, when l afterward examined my account, I found I had
kept a true reckoning of years.

It. was no less than eight days I had waited for them, when a
strange and unforeseen accident intervened, of which the like has
not perhaps been heard of in history. I was fast asleep in my hutch,
one morning, when my man Friday came running in to me, and called
aloud, " Master, master, they are come, they are come!" I jumped
up, and, regardless of danger, I went out as soot. as I could get myacumen canon. 21:>>

clothes on. through my little grove, which by the way, was by this
time grown to be a very thick wood; I say, regardless of dnzger,l
went without my arms, which it was not my custom to do; but I was
surprised, when turning my eyes to the sea, I presently saw a heat
about a league and a half distant, standing in for the shore, with a
shoulder-of-mutton soil, as they call it, and the wind blowing pretty
fair to bring them in ; also I observed presently, that they did not
come from that side which the shore lay on, but from the southern-
most end of the island. Upon this, I called Friday in, and bade him lie
close, for these were not the people we looked for, and that we might
not know yet whether they were friends or enemies. In the next
place, I went in to fetch my perspective glass, to see what I could
make of them; and having taken the ladder out, I climbed to the
top of the bill, as I used to do when I was apprehensive of anything.
and to take my view the plaincr without being discovered. I had
scarce set my foot upon the hill, when my eye plainly discovered a
ship lying at anchor, at about two leagues and a half distance from
me, S. S. E., but not above a league and a half from the shore. By
my observation, it appeared plainly to be an English ship, and the
bent appeared to be an English long-boat.

I cannot express the confusion I was in ; though the joy of seeing
a ship, and one that I had reason to believe was manned by my own
countrymen, and, consequently, friends, was such as I cannot de-
scribe: but yet I had some secret doubts hang about nae--I cannot
tell from whence they came, bidding me to keep upon my guard. In
the first place it occurred to me to consider what business an English
ship could have in that part of the world, since it was not the way to
or from any part of the world where the English had any traffic ; and
Iknew there had been no storms to drive them in there, as in dis-
tress; aod that if they were really English, it was most probable
that they were here upon no good design; and that I had better con
tinue as I was, than fall into the hands of thieves and murderers.

Let no man despise the secret hints and notices of danger, which
sometimes are given him when he may think there is no possibility of
its being real. That such hints and notices are given us, I believe
few that have made any observation of things can deny; that they
are certain discoveries of an invisible world, and aconverse of spirits,
we camiot doubt; and if the tendency of them seems to be to warn us
of danger, why should we not suppose they are from some friendly agent
(whether supreme or inferior and subordinate, is r at the question"
and that they are given for our good.218 WWII" or

and looked like men in despair. 'l'his pntine in mind ot the first

of being devoured by wild beasts. As I knew nothing that night of
the supply I was to receive by the providential driving of the ship
nearer the land by the storms and tide, by which I have since been
no long nourished and supported; so these three poor desolate
men know nothing how certain of deliverance and supply they were,
how near it was to them, and how effectually and really they were in
a condition of safety, at the same time that they thought. themselres '
lost, and their case desperate. So little do we see brforo us in the

grunt Maker of the world. that he does not leave his creatures so ab-
solutely destitute, but that, in the worst circumstances, they have
always something to be thankful for, and nomctimcs are nearer their

on shore; and partly while they rambled about to see what
kind of a place they were in, they had carelessly stayed till
the tide was spent, and the water was ebbed considerably
away, leaving their boat aground. They had left two men in the
boat, who, as I found afterward, having drunk a little too much
brandy. fell asleep ; however, one of them waking a little sooner than
the other, and finding the boat too fast aground for him to stir it,
hallooed out to the rest, who were straggling about: upon which
they all soon came to the boat; but it was past all their strength to
launch her, the boat being very heavy, and the shore on that side be-
ing a unit cozy and, almost like n. quickeond. In this condition, like

otl' from the boat, " Why, let her alone, Jack, can't you? she'll float

what countrymen they were. All this while] kept myself very close,
not once daring to stir out of my castle, any further than to my place

how well it was fortified. I knew it was no less than ten hours be-

and I might he more at liberty to see their motions, and to hear their
discourse, if they hnd nny. In the me:\ntime,l fitted myself up for
u battle, as before, though with more caution, knowing I had to do
with another kind of an enemy than I had at first. I ordered I-'ridny
also, whom I had made an excellent marksman with his gun, to loud
himself with arms. I took myself two fowlingApieees, and] gave
him three muskets. My figure, indeed, was very fierce; I had my
formidable goat's skin coat on. with the great cup I have mentioned,
a naked sword by my side, two pistols in my belt, and at. gun upon
each shoulder.

I; " if God had sent an angel to relieve you he would have come hot:

"Our case," said he, sir, "is too low; to tell you while our murderers
are so near us. but in short, sir, I was commander of that ship, my
men have mutinicd against me _; they have been hardly prevailed on
not to murder me, mid at last have set me on shore in this desolate
place, with these two men with mc--one my mate, the other a ras--
scnger--where we expected to perish, believing the place to be unin-
habited, and know not yet what to think of it." "Where are these
hrutcs, your enemies i" said I ; " do you know where they are gone '1"
" There they lie, sir," said he, pointing toothicket of trees ; "my heart
trembles for fear they have seen us and heard you speak ; if they have,
they will certainly murder us all." " llave they any firearms?" said
1. He answered they had only two pieces, one of which they left in
the boat. "Well, then," said I, " leave the rest to me; I see they are
all asleep; it is on easy thing to kill them all, but shall we rather
take them prisoners i" Ile told me there were two desperate villains
among them, that it was scarce safe to show any mercy to, but if they
were secured, he believed all the rest would return to their duty." I
asked him which they were. He told me he could not at that dis-
tance distinguish them, but he would obey my orders in anything I
Would direct. '5 Well," says I, " let us retreat out of their View or
hearing, lest they awake, and we will resolve further." So they wil-
lingly went back with me till the woods covered us from them.

"Look you, sir," said I, '.'.if I venture upon your deliverance are
you willing to make two conditions with me i" IIe_anticipated my
proposals by telling me that both he and the ship, if recovered. should
be {wholly directed and commanded by me in everything; and, if the
ship wasnot recovered, he would live and die with me in what part
93' the world mover I would send him, and the two other men said
the same. "Well," says I, "my conditions are but two: first, that
while you stay in this island with me you will not pretend to any
auth wit y here, and if 1 put arms into your hands, you Will, upon all
occasions, give them up to me, and do no prejudice to me ermine
upon this island. and, in the meantime, he gmerncd by my orders;
secondly, that if the ship is, or may be recovered, you will carry me

He gave me all the assurances that the invention or faith of man
could devise that. he would comply with these most reasonable de-
mands, and, besides, would owe his life to me, and acknowledge it
Upon all occasions on long as he lived. "Well, then," said I, " here
are three mnskets for you, with powder and ball ; tell me next what:
you think proper to Le done." He showed the all the testimonies of
his gratitude that he was able, hut ofi'ercd to be wholly guided by
me. I told him I thought 'it was hard venturing any thing, but the
best method I could think of was to fire upon them at once, as they
lay, and if any were not. killed at the first volley, and (.ll'erod to sub-
mit. we might save them, and so put it. wholly upon God's providence
to direct the shot. lie said, very modestly, that he was loath to kill
them, it" he could help it, but that those two were int-tu'iigihle villains,
and had been the authors of all the mutiny in the thip, and if they
escaped we should he undone still, for they would go on hoard and
bring the. whole ship's company, and destroy us ail. " Well, then,"
says I, "necessity legitimate>>! my advice, for it is the only nay to
save our lives." llowever, seeing him still cautious of shedding
blood, I told him they should go themselves and manage as they
found convenient. '

In the middle of this discourse we heard some of them awake: and
soon after we saw two of them on their feet. I asked him if either
of them were the heads of the mutiny. He said " No." " WM], (1103:"
said I, " you may let them escape, and Previdenbe seems to have
awakened them on purpose to save themselves. va -" says i, "if the
rest escape you, it is your fault." Animated with this. he tool: the
musket I had given him in his hand. and a. pistol in his luelt, and Lia
two comrades with him,\vith each n piece in his hand. The two men
who were with him going first, ma-le some noise. at which one of the
seamen who was awake turned about, and seeing them coming, cried
out to the rest, but it was too late, then. for the moment he cried out
they fired--I menu the two men--the captain wisely reserving his
own piece. They had so well aimed their shots at the men they
knew, that one of them was killed on the spot and the other very
much wounded. but, not being dead, he started upon his feet and
called eagerly for help to the others, but the captain stopping to him,
told him it was too late to cry for help, he should call upon God to
forgive his rillany, and with that word knocked him down with tho
stouk of his musket, so that he never spoke more. There were three
more in the company, and one of them was also slightly wounded.
By this time I was came, and when they saw their danger, and that it
was in vain to resist, they begged for mercy. The captain told them
he would spare their lives if they would give him any assurance of
their abhorrence of the treachery they had been guilty of, and would
swear to be faithful to him in recovering the ship, and afterward in
carrying her back to Jamaica, whence they came. They gave him all
the protestations of their sincerity that could he desired, and he was
willing to believe them, and spare their lives; which I was not against.
only that I obliged him to keep them bound hand and foot while they
were on the island.

While this was doing, I sent Friday with the captain's mate to the
boat, with orders to secure her, and bring away the oars and soils,
which they did ; and hy-nnd-hy three straggling men, that were (hap-
pily for them) parted from the rest, came back upon hearing the guns
fired, and seeing the captain, who before was their prisoner, now their
conqueror, they submitth to be bound also; and so our victory was
complete.

It nowremainod that the captain and I should inquire into one
nnolher's circumstances; I began first, and told him my whole history,
which he heard with an attention even to amazement; and particu-
larly at the wonderful manner of my being furnished with provisions
and ammunition; and, indeed, as my story is a whole collection of
wonders, it affected him deeply. But when he reflected from thence
upon himself, and how I seemed to have been preserved there on
purpose to save his life, the tears ran down his face, and he could not
speak a word more. After this communication was at an end, I car-
ried him and his two men into my apartment, leading them in just
where I came out, \'iz.: at the top of the house, where] refreshed
them with such provisions as I had, and showed them all the contri-
' vanees I had made, during my long, long inhabiting that place.

All I showed them, all I said to them, was perfectly amazing; but,
above all, the captain admired my fortification, and how perfectly I
had concealed my retreat with a grove of trees, which, having now
been planted near twenty years. and the trees growing much faster
then in England, was become a. little wood, and so thick, that it was
impassable in any part of it, but at that one side where I had reserved
my little winding pmwago into it. I told him this was my castle and
my residence, hut thatl had a seat in the country,as most princes
have, whither I could retreat upon occasion, and I would show him
that, too, another time; but at present our business was to consider
how to recover the ship. Ilo agreed with me as to that: buttold me
he was perfectly at a less what measures to take, for that there were
still six-aml-twonty hands on hoard, who having entered into a cursed
conspiracy, l-y which they had forfeited their lives to the law, would
be hardened in it now by desperation, and would carry it on, knowing
that, if they were suhdued, they would he brought to the gallows, as

number as we. were.

I mused for some time upon what he had said, and found it was a
very rational conclusion, and that, therefore, something was to he re-
solved on speedily, as well to draw the men on board into some snare
for their surprise. as to prevent their hurtling upon us, and destroying
us. Upon this, it presently occurred to me, that in a little while the
ship's erew, wondering what was heroine of their comrades, and of
the boat, would certainly come on shore in their other boat to look
for them ; and that. then, perhaps, they might come armed, :uid he too
strong for us: this he allowed to be rational. Upon this. I told him
the first thing we had to do was to stave the heat, which lay upon the
beach, so that they might not. carry her off; and talk ng everything
out of her, leave her so far useless as not to be lit. to swim ; accord-
ingly we went on board, took the arms which were left on hoard put
of her, and whatever else we timnd there, which were a hutlle of
brandy, and another of rum, a few biscuit-cakes, a horn of powder,
and a great lump of sugar in a piece of canvass (the sugar was live or
six pounds) ; all which was very welcome to me especially the brandy
and sugar, of which I had had none left for many years.

When we had 'arried all these things on shore (the oars, mast, sail
and rudder of the heat were carried away before, as alum e), "e
knocked a. great. hole in her hottom, that if they had come strung
enough to master as, yet they could not. carry off the heat. Indeed it
was not much in my thoughts that. we could he ahle to recover the
ship: hut. my view was, that if they went away without a luoat, I did
not much question to make her fit again to carry us to the Leeward
Islands and call upon our friends the Spaniards in my way; for I
had them still in my thoughts.
While we were thus preparing our designs, end had first, by main
strength, heeved the bout upon the bench so high, that the tide would
not flout her off at high-water mark, and besides, had broke a hole in
her bottom too big to be quickly stopped, and were set down musing
what we should do, we heard the ship fire a gun, and saw her make e
waft with her ensign as a signal for the boat to come on board; but
no hunt stirred; and they fired several times, making other signals
for the boot. At last, when all their signals and firing proved fruit-
less, and they found the boat did not stir, we saw them, by the help
of my glasses, hoist another boat out, and row toward the shore; and
we found, as they approached, that there were no less than ten men
in her, and that they had fire-arms with them.

As the ship luy almost two leagues from the shore, we had a full
View of them as they come, and it plain eight even of their faces; be-
cause the tide having set them a little to the east of the other host,
they rowed up under shore, to come to the same plnce where the
other had londcd, and where the hunt lay; by this means, I say, we
had a full view of them, and the captain knew the persons and char-
aeters of all the men in the boat, of whom he said, there were three
very honest fellows, who, he one sure, were led into this conspiracy
by the rest, being overpowered and frightened; but that as for the
hoatswein, who it seems, was the chief oilicer among them, and all
the rest, they were us outrageous as any of the ship's crew, and were
no doubt made desperate in their new enterprise ; and terribly appre-
hensive he was that they would be too powerful for us. I smiled at
him, and told him that men in our circumstances were past the opera-
tion of fear; that seeing almost every condition that could he was
better than that which we were supposed to he in, we ought to expect
that the consequence, whether death or life, would be sure to be a
deliverance. [asked him what he thought of the circumstances of
my life, and whether a deliverance were not worth venturing for.
" And where, sir," said I, " is your belief of my being preserved hero
on purpose to save your life, which elevated you a little while ago
For my port," said I, " there seems to me but one thing amiss in all
the prospect of it." " What is that Z" says he. " W by," says I, " it
is, thnt as you say there are three or four honest follows among them,
which should be spared, hnd they been all of the wicked pan )f the
crew, I should have thought God's providence had singled th in out
to deliver them into your hands ; for, depend upon it, every man that
somos ashore is our own, and shall die or live as he behaves to us."
As I spoke this with raised voice and cheerful countenance, I found
L greatly encouraged him; so we set vigorously to our business.
We had. upon the first appearance of the boat's coming from the
ship. connidered of separating our prieonere: and we had. indeed, so
cured them edectually. Two of them. of whom the captain was lesu
nsxnred than ordinary, i sent with Friday, and one of the three de-
livered men, to my care, where they were remote enough. and out of
danger 01 being heard or diecorered, or of finding their way out ofthe
woods if they could have delivered themselves; here they left them
lmnnd, but gave them provisions; and promised them if they com
tinned there quietly, to give them their liberty in a day or two; but
that if they attempted their escape, they should he put to death with-
out mercy. 'l'hey promieed faithfully to hear their confinement with
patience, and were very thankful that they had such good usage as to
have provisions and light left them; for Friday gave them candles
(such as we made ourselves) for their comfort: and they did not know
but that he aloud sentinel over them at the entrance.

The other prisoners had hotter usage; two of them were kept
pinioned; indeed, because the captain was not free to trust them _: hut
the other two were taken into my service, upon the capL-tin'u recom-
mendation, and upon their solemnly engaging to live and die with us;
use with them and the three honest men we were seven men well
armed; and I made no douht we should he ahle to deal well enough
with the ten that were coming, considering that the captain had said
that there were three or four honest men among them also. 1% soon
as they got to the place where their other heat lay, they ran their
boat into the beach, and came on shore, hauling the boat up after
them, whichI was glad to see; for I was afraid they would rather
have left the heat at an anchor, some distance from the shore, with
some hands in her to guard her, and so we should not henalile to
seize the boat. Being on shore, the first thing they did, they ran all
to their other heat; and it was easy to see they were under a great
surprise to find her stripped. as above, of all that. was in her, and a
great hole in her bottom. After they had mused a while upon this,
they not up two or three great shouts, hallooing with all their might
to try if they could make their companionn hear; but all was to no
purpose; then they came all close in a ring, and tired a volley of
their small arms, which, indeed, we heard, and the echoes made the
woods ring; hut. it was all one : those in the cave we were sure could
not hear; and those in our keeping, though they heard it well enough,
yetduret give no answer to them. They were so astonished at. the
lurprise of this. that, as they told afterward. they resolved to go uh
a: board again to their nhip, and let them know that the men we...
Ill murdered. and the long-heat staved ; accordingly, they immo-
lliately launched their boat again, and got all of them on board.

The captain was terribly amazed and even confounded at this,
believing they would go on board the ship again, and set sail, giving
their comrades over for lost, and so he should still lose the ship
which he was in hopes we should have recovered; out he was quickly
as much frightened the. other way.

They had not been long put 06' with the boat, but we perceived
them all coming on shore again; but this with this new measure in
their conduct, which it seems they consulted together upon, rim: to
leave three men in the heat, and the rest to go on shore, and go up
into the country to look for their fellows. This was a. great disap-
pointment to us, for now we were at a less what to do; as our seizing
these seven men on shore would be no advantage to us, if we let the
boat escape ; because they would then row away to the ship, and then
he rest of them would he sure to weigh and set sail, and so our re-
:overing the ship would be lost. However, we had no remedy but to
wait and see what the issue of things might present. The seven men
came on shore, and the three who remained in the boat put her of to
a good distance from the shore, and came to an anchor to wait for
them; so that it was impossihlo for us to come at them in the heat.
Those that came on shore kept close together, marching toward the
top of the little hill under which my habitation lay ; and we could
see them plainly, though they could not perceive us. We could have
been very glad they would have come nearer to us. so that we might
have fired at them, or that they would have gone farther ofi', that we
might have come abroad. But when they were come to the brow of
the hill, where they could see a great way into the valleys and woods,
which lay toward the northeast part, and where the island lay lowex a,
they shouted and hallooed till they were weary; and not caring, it
seems, to venture for from the shore, nor for from one another, they
out down together under a tree, to consider of it. Had they thought
lit to have gone to sleep there, as the other part of them had done,
they had done the job for u; but they were too full of apprehensions
of danger to venture to go to sleep, though they could not tell what
the danger was they had to fear neither.

The captain made a very just proposal to me upon this consultation
of theirs, viz.: that perhaps they would all fire a volley again, to en-
deavor to make their fellows hear, and that we should all sally upon
them, just at the juncture, when their pieces were all discharged, and
they would certainly yield, and we ehould have them without blood

near e..-;n__v,h to come up In them before they could load their piecee
again; but this etent, did not happen; and no lay still a long while,
very irrusnlutn what. euurau to take. At length I told them that
there would be nothing done, in my opinion, till night; and then, if
they did not return to the boat, perhaps we might find a way tn get

They were just going into the heat when Friday and the mate hal-

shore westward, toward the voice they heard, when they were prea-
ently stepped by the creek, where the water being up, they could

asindeedl expected. "'lten they had set themselveu over, I ult-
eerved that the hunt living gone a pond way into the creek, and, as it
were. in a havhnr within the land. they took one of the three men out
of her, tn go alung with them, and left only two in the boat. having
fautened her to the stump of a little tree. on the share. This was
what I wiehed for: and innnediately leaving Friday and the captain's
mate to their business, 1 took the rest with me, and crossing the crook
out of their sight, we surprised the two men before they were aware;
one of them lying on the shore, and the other being in the boat. The
follow on the shore was between sleeping and waking, and going to
start up; the captain, who won foremost, ran in upon him, and
knoeked him down, and then called out to him in the boat to yield, or
he was a dead man. There needed very few arguments to persuade
a single man to yield, when he saw five men upon him, and his coni-
rnde knocked down ; besides, this was, it seems, one of the three who
were not so hearty in the mutiny as the rest of the crew, and there-
fore was easily persuaded, not only to yield. but afterward to join
very sincerely with us. In the meantime, Friday and the captain's
mate so well managed their business with the rest, that they drew
them, by hallooing and answering, from one hill to another, and from
one wood to another, till they not only heartily tired them, but left
them where they were very sure they could not reach back to the
boat before it was dark; and, indeed. they were heartily tired them-
selves also, by the time they came back to us.

We had nothing new to do but to watch for them in the dark, and
to fell upon them no as to make sure Work with them. It was seve-
ral hours after Friday came back to me before they came back to
their boat, and we could hear the foremost of them, long before they
cmne quite up, calling to those behind to come along, and could also
hear them answer and complain how lame and tired they were, and
not able to come any faster, which was very welcome news to us. At
length they came up to the boat. but it is impossible to express their
confusion when they found the boat fast aground in the creek, the
tide ebbed out, and their two men gone. We could hear them call to
one another in a most lamentable manner, telling one another they
were get into an enchanted island; that either there were inhabitants
in it, and they should all be murdered, or else there were devils and
spirits in it, and they should be all carried away and devoured.
They halleoed again. and called their two comrades by their names a
great many times, but no answer. After some time we could see
them, by the little light there was, run about wringing their hands,
like men in despair, and that sometimes they would go and sit down
in the boat' to rest themselves, then come ashore again, and walk
about again, and so the same thing over again. My men would fain
have had me give them leave to fell upon them at once in the dark,
but I was willing to take them at some advantage, so as to spare
them, and to kill as few of them as I could; and especially I was
unwilling to hazard the killing any of our men, knowing the others228 ADVI'a-'c'l'vufil or

were very well armed. I resolved to wait, to see if they did not sep-
arate, and therefore, to make nut-o of them,l drew my tunlauacatto
nearer, and ordered Friday and the captain to creep upon their hands
and tent as elow to the ground as they could, that. they might not bu
disumernd, and get as near them as they could possibly lat-fore they
otl'erod to tire.

They had not. been long in that posture when the boatswnin, who
was the principal ringleader of the mutiny, and had now shown him-
self the most dejected and dispirited of all the rest, eantc walking to-
ward them, with two more of the crew: the captain was re eager at
having this pt'ith'ipttl rogue m nun-h in his power, that he eould hardly

PON this Will Atkins cried out, " For God's sake, captain,

as had us I." "'hieh, by the way, was not true, neither,

for it seems this Will Atkins was the first man that laid
hunt on the captain when they first mutinied, and used him barba-
rously, in tying his hands and giving him injurious language. How'-
erer, the captain told him he must lay down his arms at discretion,
and trust to the governor's mercy; by which he meant me, for they
all called me governor. In a word, they all laid down their arms and
begged their lives, and I sent the man that had parloyed with them,
and two more, who hound them all; and then my great army of fifty
men, which, particularly with those three, were in all hot eight. came
up and seized upon them and upon their boat, only that I kept my-
self and one more out of sight for reasons of state.

Our next work was to repair the hoot, and think of seizing tho
ship : and M for the captain, now he had leisure to pnrh-y with them,
he expostulnted with them upon the villany of their practices with
him, and at length upon the further wickedness of their design, and
how certainly it must bring them to misery and distress in the end.
and perhaps to the gallows. They all appeared very penitont, and
begged hard for their lives. As for that, he told them they were none
of his prisoners, but the commander's of the island: that they thought
they had set him on short) on o. barren, uninhahited island. hut it had
pleased God no to direct them that it was inhahited. and that the goro
ernor was an Englishman; that ho mig' t. hang them all there, if he
please-l, hut as he had given them all quarter, he supposed he would
send them to England, to be dealt with there as just-ice required. ex-
cept Atkinu, whom he was commanded by the governor to advise to
lilt'plll'u for death, for that- ho would he. hanged in the morning.

'l'hongh all this was but a fiction of his own. yet it had its desired
chi-ct: Atkins fell upon his knees. to hog the captain to intoreede
with the governor for his life. and all the rest hegged of him, for
God's sake. that they might not he sent to England.

It now occurred to me that the time of our deliverance who come,
and that it. would he a most easy thing to bring these fellows in to he
hearty in getting possession of the ship, so I retired in the dark from280 ADvnsrt'nm or

them, that they might not see what kind of a. governor they had, and
called the captain to me; when I called, as at. a good distance, one
of the men "as ordered to speak again, and say to the captain, " Cap-
tain, the commander calls for you," and presently the eaptnin rm
plied, " 'l'ell his excelleney I am just a-coming." This more perfectly
assured them, and they all believed that the commander was just lny,
with his fifty men. Upon the captain's coming to me, I told him my
project for seizing the ship, which he liked \vonderfiilly well, and re-
solved to put it in execution the next morning; but, in order to oxe-
eute it with more heart, and to he sure ot'sueeesu, I told him we must
divide the prisoners, and that he should go and take Atkins, and two
more of the worst of them, and bend them pinioued to the cave where
the others lay. Thin was committed to Friday and the two men who
came on shore. with the captain. They conveyed them to the cave as
to a prison ; and it was, indeed. a dismal place, especially to men in
their condition. The others I ordered to my bower, as I called it, of
of which I have given a. full description, and as it was fenced in, and
they pinioued, the place was secure enough, considering they were
upon their behavior.

To these in the morning I aent the captain, who was to enter into a
parley with them; in a. word, to try theta, and tell me whether he
thought they might be trusted or no to go on board and surprise the
ship. Ile talked to them of the injury done him, of the condition they
were brought to, and that though the governor had given them
quarter for their lives as to the present action, yet that if they were
sent to England, they would all lie hanged in chains, to he sure; but
that ifthey would ioin in so just an attempt as to recover the ship, he
would have the governor' a engagement for their par.den

Any one may guess how readily such a. proposal would be accepted
by men in their condition , they fell down on their knees to the cap-
tain, and promised with the deepest imprccatious, that they would be
faithful to him to the last. drop, and that they should owe their lives
to him, and would go with him all over the world; and that they
would own him as a father as long as they lived. " Well," says the
captain, " I must go and tell the governor what you say, and 500 what
I can do to luring him to consent to it." So he brought me an ac-
count of the temper he found them in, and that he verily believed
they Would he faithful. However, that we might be very secure, I
told him we should go hat-k again and choose out those five, and tell
them. that they might see he did not want men, that he would take
out those five to ho hil Assistants, and that the governor would keep
c'.

the other two, and the three that were sent prisoners to the castle
(my cave) as hostages for the fidelity of those five; and that if they
proved unfaithful in the execution, the tire hostages should be hanged
in chains alive on the shore. This looked severe, and convinced
them that the governor was in earnest: however. they had no way
left them but to accept it; and it was now the business of the
prisoners, as much as of the captain, to persuade the other five to do
their duty.

Our strength was now thus ordered for the expedition; first, the
captain, his mate, and passenger; second,the two prisoners of the
find. gang, to whom, having their character from the captain, I had
given their liberty, and trusted them with anus: third, the other two
that I had kept till now in my bower pinioned, but, on the captain's
motion, had now released ; fourth, these five released at. last; so
that they were twelve in all, besides five we kept prisoners in the
cave for hostages.

I asked the captain if he was willing to venture with these hands
on board the ship: but as for me and my man Friday, I did not think
it was proper for us to stir, having seven men left behind; and it was
employment enough for us to keep them asunder, and supply them
with victuals. As to the five in the cave,I resolved to keep them
fast, but Friday went in twice a day to them, to supply them with
necessaries; and I made the other two carry provisions to a certain
distance, where Friday was to take it.

When I showed myself to the two hostages, it was with the cap-
tnin, who told them I was the person the governor had ordered to
look after them; and that it was the governor's pleasure that they
'should not stir anywhere but by my direction; that if they did,
they would be fetched into the castle, and he laid in irons: so that as we.
never suffered them to see me as a governor,I now appeared as
another person, and spoke of the governor, the garrison, the castle,
and the like, upon all occasions.

The captain now had no dilliculty before him, but to furnish his-
two boats, stop the breach in one. and man them. He made his pam-
songor captain of one, with four of the men ; and himself, his mate,
and five more, went in the other; and they contrived their business
very well, for they came up to the ship about midnight. As soon as
they came within call of the ship, he made Robinson hail them, and
tell them they had brought off the men and the boat, hot that it was.
a long timehefore they had found them, and the like, holding them
in a chat till they came to the ship's side; when the captain and the;
mate entering first. with their arms, immediately knocked down the
newond n nt-x and carpenter with the butt and of their mmdaetu, being
very l'tllll'itlilj seconded ly their men ; they secured all the rest that
were upon the main and quarter decks, and began to fasten the
hatches. to keep them down that were helow; when the other heat
and their men entering at the fore-chains, secured the forecastle of
the ship, and the scuttle which went down into the cook-room, mak-
ing three men they found there prisoners. When this was done, and
all Rafe upon deck, the captain ordered the mate with three men, to
break into the round-house, where the new robot captain lay, who
having taken the alarm, had got. up, and with two men and a boy had
got firearms into their hands ; and when the mate, with a crow, split
open the door, the new captain and his men fired hnldly among
them, and Wounded the mate with a musket hall, which broke his
arm, and wounded two more of the men, but killed nobody. The
mate calling for help, rushed, however, into the round-house, wounded
nu he was, and with his pistol rhot the new captain through the head,
the bullet. entering at. his mouth, and came out again Ivohind one of
hi3 ears, no that he never xpoke a word more: upon which the rest
yielded, and the zahip was taken ell'cetunlly, without any more lives
lost.

As soon as the ship was thus necured, the captain ordered seven
guns to he tired, which was the signal agreed upon with me to give
me notice of his suereus, which you may he sure I was very glad to
hear, having- not watt-hing upon the shore for it till near two o'clock
in the morning. Having thus heard the. signals [lainly,l laid me
down _: and it liming heeu a day of fatigue to me, I slept very sound,
till I was something surprised at. the noise of a gun ; and presently
starting up. I heard a man eall me hy the name of "Governor,
Governor," and presently I knew the captain's voice; when climhiug
up to the top of the hill, there he stood, and pointing: to the ship. he
embraced me in his arms. " My dear friend and dclivcrer." says he,

reek; and the tide being up, the captain had brought. the pinuace in

mud; but ".8 he bud taken me in his arms, I hold foot by him, or I
should have fallen to the ground. lle perceived the surprise, and
immediately pulls it bottle out. of his pocket, and gave me a. dram of
cordial. which he had brought on purtnme for me. Afterl had drank
it, I out down upon the ground; and though it: brought me to myself,
yet. it was a good while hcforo I could speak it word to him. All
this time the poor man was in as great on eestacy as I, only not under
any surprise, us 1 was; and he said u thousand kind and tender llxingl
tome, to compose and bring me to myself: hut with was the flood of
joy in my breast, that it put all my spirits into confusion: ut laet it
broke out into tours; and in a little while after I recovered my
sl-eech. I then took my turn, and embraced him us my deliverer,n.ud
we rejoiced together. I told him I looked upon him as a man sent
from Heaven to deliver me, and that the whole transaction seemed to
be a chain of "'0"de ; that such things as these were the testimonies
we had of a secret. hand of Providence governing the world, and an
cridcnce that the eye of an infinite power could search into the re-
moteht toruer of the world, and send help to the miseruhle whenever
he pleased. I fin-gut nrt to lift up my heart in thankfully-s: to
Heaven: and what heart could fol-hear to Llesn him. who had not only
in a miraculous manner provided for me in such a wilderness, and in
such a desolate condition, but from whom erery deliverance must
always he acknowledged to proceed ?

\Vhea he had Ltlkcd a while, the. captain told me he had brought
me some little refreshment, such as the ship afforded, r nvl such M the
wrote-hes, that had been so long his masters, had not plundered him
of. Ul-on this he called aloud to the loat, end bade his men luring
the things ashore that. were for the governor ; and, indeed, it. was a
present as if I had heeu one that was not to he carried away with
them, hut us il' I had been to dwell upon the island still. Finzt, he
had lit-ought me a. case of bottles full nt' excellent cordial waters, six
large hottles of Madeim wine (the bottles held two quarts each). two
pounds of excellent good tobacco, twelve good pieces, of the ship's
heel", and vi: pieces of pork. with a hag of peas, and about a hundred
weight of biscuit ; he also brought me u box of sugar, a box of flour,
a bag full of lemons, and two bottles of lime juice, and uhuudauce of
other things. But, hesides these, and what wax u thousand times
more u ef'ul to me, he brought me xix new clean shirts, six rery good
neekcloths, two pair of gloves, one pair of shoes, a. hat, and one pair'234 mvmum Or

of stockings, with a very good suit of clothes of his own, which had
been worn but very little; in a word, he clothed me from head to
(not. It was a very kind and agreeable present, as any one may im-
agine. to one in my circumstances; but never was anything in the
world, of that kind, so unpleasant, awkward, and uneasy, as it was to
me to wear such clothes at first.

After these ceremonies were past, and after all his good things
were brought- into my little apartment, we began to consult what
was to he done with the prisoners we had ; for it. was worth consider-
ing whether we. might venture to take them away with us or no,
especially two of them, whom we knew to be incorrigible and refute-
tory to the last degree; and the captain said he knew they were such
rogues, that there was no ohliging them; and if he did carry them
away, it must he in irons, as malefactors, to be delivered over to jus-
(ice at the first linglish colony he could come at; and I found that the
captain himself was very anxious nhout it. Upon this I told him,
that if he desired it, I would undertake to bring the two men he spoke
of to make it their own request that. he should leave them upon the
island. " I should he very glad of that," says the captain, "with all
my heart." " Well," 2:: 'x l, " I will send for them up, and talk with
them for you." So I caused Friday and the two hostages, for they
were now discharged, their com radcs hax ing perihrmcd their promise ;
I say, I caused them to go to the. care, and bring up the five men pin-
ioned, as they were, to tho howcr, and keep them there till I came.
A ftcr some time I came thither drcsecd in my new habit; and now I
was called governor again. Being all met, and the captain with me,
I caused the men to be brought before me, and I told them I had got
afull accountof their \'illannus hehavior to the captain. and how
they had run away with the whip, and were preparing to commit fur-
ther rovhheries, hut that- I'roridcm-c had enamored them in their own
ways, and that they were fallen into the pit which they had dog for
others. Ilet them know thathy my direction the ship had heen
seized; that she lay now in the road; and they might see, hy-and-hy,
that their new captain had received the reward of his villany, and
that. they would see him hanging at the yard-arm ; that as to them, I
wanted to know what they had to say why I should not. execute them
ns pirates, taken in the fact, nshy my commission they could not doubt
but I had authority so to do.

One of them answered in the. name of the rest, that they had noth--
ing to say but this, that when they were taken the captain promised
them their lives, and they humbly implored my mercy. But I told
them I knew not what mercy to show them: for, as for myself, I had
resolved to quit the island with all my men, and had taken passage
with the captain to go for England; and as for the captain he could
not carry them to England other than as prisoners, in irons, to he tried
for mutiny, and running away with the ship; the consequence of
which, they must needs know, would he the gallows; so that I could
not tell what was host for them, unless they had a mind to take their
fate in the island ; if they desired that, as I had liberty to leave the
island, I had some inclination to give them their lives, if they thought
they could shift on shore. They seemed vcry thankful for it, and
said they would much rather venture to stay there than to be carried
to England to he hanged; so I left it on that issue.

However, the captain seemed to make some difficulty of it, as if he
durst not- lcm'e them there. Upon this I seemed a. little angry with
the captain, and told him that they were my prisoners, not his; and
seeing that I had offered them so much favor, I would be as good as
my word ; and that if he did not think fit to consent to it, I would set
them at liberty, as I found them: and if he did not like it, he might
take them again if he could catch them. Upon this they appeared
very thankful, and I accordingly set them at liberty, and bade them
retire to the woods from whence they came, and I would leave them
some tire-arms, some ammunition, and some directions how they should
live very well, if they thought fat. Upon thisI prepared to go on
board the ship; but told the captain 1 would stay that night to pre-
pare my things, and desired him to go on hoard, in the meantime, and
keep all right in the ship, and send the host on shore next day for
me; ordering him, at all events. to cause the now captain, who was
killed. to be hanged at the yard-arm, that these men might see him.

When the captain was gone, I sent for the men up to me, to my
apu-t-mcnt, and entered seriously into discourse with them on their
circumstances I told them I thought they had made a right choice;
that it' the captain had carried them away, they would certainly be
hanged. I showed them the new captain hanging at the yard-arm of
the. ship. and told them they had nothing less to expect.

When they had all declared their willingness; to stay, I then told
them I would let them into the story of my living there, and put. them
into the way of making it easy to them: accordingly,1 gave them
the whole history of the place, and of my coming to it; showed them
my tin-tificntions, the way I made my bread, planted my corn, cured
my grapes ; and, in a word, all that was necessary to make them easy.
I told them the story also of the seventeen Spaniards that were to be
expected, for whom I left a letter, and made them promise to treat
lltt'm in eonunou witlt themselves. Here it. may be noted, that the
captain hat ink on board, who was greatly surprised that I new:- hit
upon a way of making ink of charcoal and water, or of something
Clet', as I had done things much more ditlicult.

1 left them my lire-anus, \'l'l. ,five munketn, three fowling-pieecn, and
three nwurdn. 1 had above a barrel and ti half of powder left. ; for
after the first year or two l used hut little and wasted none. I gave
them a description of the way I managed the geatn, and direetion to
milk and fatten them, and to make butter and eheem; in a word, I
gave them every part of my own story, and told them I should pre-
vail with the captain to leave them two barrels of gunpowder more,
and some garden-seeds, \\'lllt'll I told them I would have heen very
glad of: also I giro them the bag of peas which the captain brought
mo to out, and hide them be sure to now and increase them.

Having done all this, l left theta the next day, and went on board
the ship. We prepared immediately to sail, hut. did not weigh that
night. The next morning, early, two ttl'the five. men t'atne swimming
to the. slfip'a side, and making a most lamentable complaint of the
other three, hegged to ho talten into tho rhip. for God's sake, for they
should be murdered, and begged the captain to take them on luonrd,
though he hanged themimmediately. l'pon thin the captain pretend.
ed to have no power without, me: but after Htllttt'. tlillieulty, ttnd after
their solemn promises of amendment, they were taken on hoard, and
were some. time. after soundly whipped and pickled ; ufterwliieh they
proved very honest and quiet fellows.

Some. time. after this. the heat was ordered on shore, the tide lreing
up, with the things promised to the men ; to which the captain, nttuy
inter-erosion, caused their chertn and clothes to in added, \\'lll\'ll they
took, and were very thankful for. l also encouraged them. if: telling
them, that if it lay in my power to send any vessel to take them in.
I would not. litrget them.

When 1 tunic learn of this island, I carried on board, for reliqnes,
- uni-skin rap l had made, my tnnhrella and one of my par-
rots: at~o I forgot not. to take the. tnotteyl fm-tut-rly mentioned,\t'lxirh
had laid liy me so long useless, that it was grown rusty or tarninhed,
and could hardl_\f pass for silver. till it had been a little Tllltllt'd and
handled: as also the money l found in the wreck ofthe. Spanish ship.
And thus I left the island. the 10th of Deeemher. as i found by the
ship's account. in the year MSG, after I had heeu upon it eight-and-
twenty years, two months, and nineteen days; being delivered from
this second captivity the same day of the month that I first made my
escape in the long-bout, from among the Moors of Sallec. In this
vessel. after a long voyage, I arrived in England the llth of June, in
the your 1687, having been thirty-five years absent.

"i \'{ in trust with, was alive, but had had great misfortunes in
the world; was become a. widow the second time, and very low in the
world. I made her very easy as to what. she owed me, Insuring her
I would give her no trouble; but on the eonlrary, in gratitude for
former euro and faithfulness to me, I relimcd her as my little Mock
would alibi-d; which, at that. time, would indeed allow me to do but
little for her; hot. I assured her I would never fin'got her fimner
kindness to me; nor did I forget her when I had sullicieut to help
her, as shall Le ohserved in its proper place. I went down nllerward
imo Yorkshire; but. my father and mother were dead, and all the
finnily oxtim-t, except. that 1 found two sisters, and two of the chil-
dren of one of my brothers; and as I had been long ago given over
for dead, there had been no provision made for me; no that, in a.
word, I found nothing to relieve or llSSlrt me; and that the little
money I had would not do nmrh for me as to setlling in the world.

I met with one piece of gratitude, indeed, which I did not expect,
and this was, that the master of the ship whom i had so loll pily de-
livered, and lay the same moans saved the ship and cargo, having
given a. very handsome account to the owners of the manner how I
had saved the lives of the men and th( ship, they invited me to meet
them. and some other morehants concerned. and all together made me
a very handsome complinmut upon the subject, and a present of almost
two huz. lz'I-<<l pounds sterling.

But. after making several reflections upon the circumstances of my
life, and how little way this would go toward settling me in the world,

(HQ IlBt' Iconic to England. I was it perfect stranger to nll238 amen-rum or

I resolved to go to Lisbon, and see if I might. not come by some infor-
mation of the state of my plantation in the Brazils, and of what. was
become of my partner, who, 1 had reason to suppose, had some years
past given me over for dead. With this view I took shipping for
Lisbon, where I arrived in April foliowing; my man Friday accom-
panying me very honestly in all these ramblings, and proving a most
faithful servant upon all occasions. When I came to Lisbon, I found
out, by inquiry, and to my particular satisfaction, my old friend the
captain of the ship who first took me up at sea <<(1' the shore of Africa.
He was now grown old, and had left oti' going to sea, having put his
son, who was far from a young man, into his ehip, and who still used
the Brazil trade. The old man did not. know me, and, indeed, I hardly
knew him; but I soon brought him to my remembrance, when I told
him who I was.

After some passionate expressions of the old acquaintance between
us, I inquired, you may be sure, after my plantation and my partner.
The old man told me he had not been in the Brazils for ahuut nine
years, but that he could awn-e me that when he came away my part-
ner was li\ing. but the trustees whom I had joined with him to take
cognizance of my part, were both dead : that, however, he believed I
would have a very good account of the improvement of the planta-
tion, for that. upon the general belief of my being cast away and
drowned. my trustees had given in the account of the produce of my
part of the plantation to the procurator-fiacal, who had appropriated
it, in easel never came to claim it, one third to the king and two
thirds to the monastery of St. Augustine. to be expended for the
benefit of the peer, and for the conversion of the Indians to the Catho-
lic faith; but that if I appeared, or any one for me, to claim the in-
heritance, it would be restored, only that the improvement: or annual
production, being distributed to charitable uses: could not be restored;
but he assured me that the Howard of the king's revenue from lands,
and the proviedore, or steward of the monastery, had taken great care
all along that. the incumbent. that in to say. my partner, gave every
year a Faithful account of the produce. of which they had duly rc-
ccived my moiety. I asked him if he knew to what height of im-
provement he had brought the plantation, and whether he thought it
might be worth looking after, or whether, on my going thither, I
should meet with any obstruction to my possessing my just right to
the moiety. He told me he could not tell exactly to what degree the
plantation was improved, but this he knew, that my partner was
grown exceeding rich upon the enjoying his part of it, and that, to.
the best of his remembrance, he had heard that the king's third of
my part, which was, it seems, granted away to some other monastery
or religious house, amounted to above two hundred moidores a year ;
that, as to my being restored to a quiet possession of it, there was no
question to be made of that, my partner being alive to witness my
title, and my name being also enrolled in the register of the country.
Also, he told me that the survivors of my two trustees were very fair,
honest people, and very wealthy, and he believedI would not only
have their assistance for putting me in possession, but would find a
very considerable sum of money in their hands for my account, being
the produce of the farm while their fathers held the trust, and before
it was given up, as above, which, as he remembered, was for about
twelve years.

I showed myself a little concerned and uneasy at this account, and
inquired of the old captain how it came to pass that the trustees
should thus dispose of my efi'ects when he knew that I had made my
will, and had made him, the Portuguese captain, my universal
heir, &c.

He told me that was true, but that as there was no proof of my
being dead, he could not act as executor until some certain account
should come of my death; and, besides, he was not willing to iutcr~
meddle with a thing so remote; thatit was true he had registered my
will, and put in his claim, and could he have given any account of my
being dead or alive, he would have acted by procuration, and taken
possession of the ingonio (so they called the sugar-house). and have
given his son, who was now at the Brazils, orders to do it. " But,"
says the old man, "I have one piece of news to tell you, which, per-
haps, may not be so acceptable to you as the rest, and that is, believ-
ing you were lost, and all the world believing so, also, your partner
mid trustees did offer to account with me, in your name. for six or
eight of the first ycsrs' profits, which I received. There being at
that time great disbursements for increasing the works, building on
ingenio, and buying slaves, it. did not amount to near so much as
afterward it produced; however," says the old man, " I shall give
you a true account of what I have received in all, and how I have
disposed of it."

After a few days' further conference with this ancient friend, he
brought me an account of the first six years' income of plantation,
signed by my partner and the merchant trustees, being always de~
livered in the goods, viz., tobacco in roll, and sugar in chests, beside-
rum, molasses, &c., which is the consequence of a sugar work' and I210 when-mar: or

creased, hut. an :tliut't', the dirthuraementa lining large, the rum at lirh'l;

sugar, and fifteen dauhlo rolls of tolmeco, which were lost, in his .ship,
he having been nhipwrotkcd coming home to Liahon, nhout. eleven
years after my leaving the place. The good man then began to complain
of Lia misfortunes, and how he had been obliged to make use ol' my
money to newer hia lossca, and buy hint a. share in u. new ship.
" However, my old friend," says he, " you shall not want- a supply in
your net-easily, and, an mum as my son returns, you shall he fully

hardly refrain from tears while he spoke ; in 51.011, 1 took one hun-

I wanted the money, l found he was honest enough to pay me, and if

 

1 did not, hut came in reel-in! what he gave me reason to expeet,1

When this was past, the. old man asked me ifhc should put me into
a method to make my claim to my plantation. I told him I thought
to go (nor to it myself. 110. said l might do so if I pleased ; hat that:
if I did not. there were ways enough to Ft'clll't', my right, and im-
mediately to appropriate the profits to my urc: and as there were
ships in the river of Lisbon just; ready to go away to Brazil, he undo
me enter my name in a public register, with hie aflidavit, aifirming,
upon oath, that l was alive, and that l was the some person v he took
up the land for the planting the said plantation at firut. This being
regularly atthtcd by a notary, and a procuratioa nfiixcd. he directed
me to <<end it, with a letter of his writing, to a. merchant of his ac-
quaintance at the place ; and then proposed my staying with him till
an account came of the return.

Never was anything more honorable than the proceedings upon
this procuralion; for in less than M'.\'ell months I received a large
packet from the survivors of my trustees. the merchants, for whose
account. 1 went to seat, in which were the following particular letters
and papers enclosed :

First. There was the account current of the produce of my.farm
or plantationt from the year when their fathers had balanced with my
old Portugal captain, being for six years: the balance appeared to be
one thousand one hundred and seventy-four moidores in my favor.

Secondly. There was the account of four years more, while they
kept the effects in their hand>>, before the government claimed the ad
ministration, as being the efl'ects of a person not to be found. which
they called civil death; and the balance of this, the value of the
plantation increasing, amounted to nineteen thousand four hundred
and forty-six crusadoes, being about three thousand two hundred and
forty tnoideres.

'l'hirdly. There was the prior of Augustine's account, who had re-
ceived the profits for above fourteen years; but not being able to ac-
count, for what was disposed of by the hospital, very honestly dc-
clarcd ho had eight handled and seventy-two moidores not distributed,
which he acknowledged to my account: as to the king's part, that
refunded nothing.

There was a letter of my partner's, congratulating me very
affectionately upon my being alive, giving me an account how the
estate was improved, and what it produced a year; with a particular
of the number of squares or acres that it contained, how planted,
how many slaves there were open it, and making two-and-twenty
crosses for blessings. told he had said so many Ate Marius to thank
the blessed Virgin that I was alive; inviting me very passionately to
come over and take possession of my own ; and, in the meantime, to
give him orders to whom he should deliver my effects, if I did not
come myself; concluding with a hearty tender of his friendship, and
that of his family; and sent. me, as a present, seven fine leopard!
Iltius, which he had, it seems, received from Africa, by some 0M

11
ship that. ho had sent thither, and who, it seems, had made a better
voyage than I. He sent. mo also five chests of excellent sweetmcats,
and u. hundred pieces of geld uncoined, not quite so large as moidorca.
By the sauna flect, my two merchant trustees shipped me one thousand
two hundred cheats ol'sugnr, eight. hundred rolls of tobacco, and the
l'L'h'i: of the whole account in gold.

I might well say now, indeed, that; the latter and of Job was better
than the beginninv. It. is impossible to express the flutterings of my
very heart, when l fimnd all my wealth about me: for as the Brazil
ships come all in fleets, the same ships which brought my letters
hrunght. my goods: and the effects were safe in the river heforo the
letters came to my hand. In a word, I turned pale and grew sick;
and had not the aid man run and fetched me a rut-dial, I believe the
sudden surprise of joy had uversrt nature, and I had died upon tho
spat:

a general release or discharge {mm the fear hundred and seventy
muidcres. which he had acknowledged he owed mo. in the fullest, and
Sirim'st- manner pnssilde. After whirh I caused a pmeuratinn to ho

the end, lining a grant of one hundred muidnres a year to him during
his life, out of the effects. and fifty moidores a your to his son after
him, for his life: and thus I requited my old man.
I was now to consider which way to steer my course next, and
what to do with the estate that. Providence had thus put into my
hands; and, indeed, I had more. care upon my head now than I had
in my silent state of life in the island, where I wanted nothing but
what I had, and had nothing hut. what. I wanted; whereas I had now
a great charge upon me, and my hosinese was how to secure it. I
had never a care now to hide my money in, or a place where it
might. lie without a. lock or key, till it grew mouldy and tarnished,
before anybody would meddle with it; on the contrary, I knew not
where to put- it, or whom to trust with it. My old patron, the cap-
tain, indeed, was honest, and that was the only refuge I had. In the
next. placeE my interest in the Brazils seemed to summon mo thither;
but, now I eould not. tell how to think of going thither till I had
settled my aflhirs, and left my effects in some safe hands hehind me.
At iirst I thought, of my old friend the widow, who I knew was
honest, and would he just to me _: I-ut. then the was in years, and but
pom, and, for aught I knew, might he in debt: so that, in a word, I
had no way hot: to go back to England myself, and take my olibcts
with me.

It. was some months, however: hefore I resolved upon this: and
thereh-ro, its I rewarded the old captain fully, and to his satisfaction,

widow: whose hashand had Leon my first benefitetor, and she, while

thing I did, 1 got. a merchant in Li<hon to write his correspondent in
London, not. only to pay a hill, but. to go find her out, and carry her

hundred pounds each, they being, though not in want, yet not in
very good circumstmrees; one having heen married and left a widow ;

be. But: among all my relations or acquaintances, I could not yet

dint I might go away to the lirazils, and leave things safe behind me 3
and this greatly perplexed me.

I had once a. mind to have gone to the. Brazils, and have settled
myselt'there; for I was, as it. were, naturalized to the plat-e: but I
had some little sample in my mind ahout religion, which insensihly
drew me back. However, it was not religion which kept me. from
going there for the present; and as I had made no scruple of being
openly of the. religion of the country nll the while lwns among them,

llnL no I have mid, this wns not the mnin thing that. kept. me from
going to the Bnuila, hut. thnt really] did not. know with whom to
leave my effects behind me; so I resolved, nt. last, to go to I'lnglnnd
with it.,where, if I arrived, I concluded I should make some. ne-
qunintunee, or find sumo relations thnt. would he l'nilht'nl to me; and,
noeordingly, I prepared to go to England with nll m_v wealth.

lII order to prepare thingu for my going home. I first, tlm Brazil
flevt. being just going nwny, resolved to gins nnswern suitnlulo to the
just. nnd l'nithl'ul necounh ofthings I had from tlnmre', and, first, to

in inn-rousing the stock of the works; giving~ him instructions for his
future gorernon-nt. of my part, norm-ding to tho powers I lmd left
with my old pntron, to whom I desired him to send whnlen'r became
(luv to me, till he should hear from me. more particularly: nssuring
him that. it. was my intention not, only to room to him, hot- to settle

of lxlnek harm. and some Flanders lure of good mine.

lluriog thus settled my ntl'nirs. sold my enrgo. and turned all my
elli'rts into good hills ofexrlnmgo. my next difficulty was, whivh way
to go to l-ln quell enough to the son. and yet.
I had a, strange nrersiun to go to l-Inglund l-y son at [hot time; nod
though 1 could giro no reason for it, yet the dillii-ulty int-roused upon
me so mnrh, llfllt though i hnd once shipped my linggnge, in order to
go, yet I altered my mind, and that not. once, but. two or three Limes.

'r'nnd: l hnd heen :u'ei.
It is true, I had been very unfortunate by sea, and this might. be
some of the reasons ; but let no man slight the strong impulses of his
own thoughts in cnses of such moment; two of the ships which I had
singled out to go in, I mean more particularly singled out than any
other, having put my things on board one of them, and in the other
to have agreed with the captain ; I say, two of these shipn miscarried,
viz. : one was taken by the Algerines, and the other was cast away on
he Start, near Tot-hay, and all the people drowned, except. three; so
that in either of those vesselsl had been made miserable.

Having been thus harassed in my thoughts, my old pilot, to whom
I communicated everything, pressed me earnestly not to go by sea,
but either to go by land to the ('uroyne (Cornnna), and cross over the
Bay of Biscay to Rochelle, from whence it was but an easy and safe
journey by land to Paris, and so to Calais and Dover; or to go up
to Madrid, and so all the way by land through France. In a word, I
was so prepossessed against my going by sea at all, except from
Calais to Dover, that I resolved to travel all the way by land; which,
as l was not in haste, and did not value the charge, was by much the
pleasanter way; and to make it more so, my old (-aptain brought an
English gentleman, the son ofn. merchant in Lisbon, who was willing
to travel with me; after which we picked up two more English mers
chants also, and two young Portuguese gentlemen, the last going to
Paris only; so that in all there were six of us, and live servants; the
two merchants and the two Portuguese contenting themselves with
one servant between two, to save the charge; and us for me, I got-nu
English sailor to travel with me in: a servant, besides my man Friday,
who was too much a stranger to be capable of supplying the place of
a. servant on the road.

In this manner I set out from Lisbon; and our company being
very well mounted and armed, we made It little troop, whereof, they
did me the honor to call me contain, as well because I was the oldest
man, as because I had two servants, and, indeed, was the original of
the whole journey.

As I have troubled you with none of my sea journals, so I shall
trouble you now with none of my land journal 5 but 'some adventure!
that happened to us in this tedious and difficult journey I must not omit.

When we came to Madrid, we, being all of us strangers to Spain,
were willing to stay some time to see the court of Spain, .and to
see what was worth observing; but it being the latter part of the
summer, we hastened away, and set out. from Madrid about the mid-
dle of October; but when we came to the edge of Navarre, we were

something before us, and not just in sight, out rushed three
monstrous wolves, and after them It hour, out of a. hollow 'uy'

. ' adjoining to in thick wood; two of the wolves made at the guide
and lied he been far before us, he would have been devoured before
we could have helped him : one of them fastened upon his horse, and the
other attacked the man with that violence, that he had not time or
presence of mind enough to drew his pistol, but. hallooed and cried
out to me most lustily. My man Friday being next. to me, I bade him
ride up, and see what was the matter. As soon as Friday came in
sight of the man, he hIIllooed out as loud as the other,' 0 name: ! 0
master! ' but like a bold fellow, rode direttly up to the poor man,
and with his pistol shot the wolf, that attacked him, in the head.

It was happy for the poor man that it was my man Friday ; for he
having been used to Mich creatures in his country, he had no fear rc-
Hpecting them, but went close up to him and shot him, as above;
whereas any other of us would have fired at a. greater distance, and
have perhaps either missed the wolf, or endangered shooting the man.

But it was enough to have terriiicd a holder man than I ; and, in-
deed, it alarmed all our coIIIpany, when with the Iioi., If Friday's
pistol, we heard (III both sides the most dismal howling of wolves;
and the noisc, redouhled hy the echo of the IIIoIIIIt'IIiIIs, appeared to
us as if there had lunch a prodigil as number of them; and perhaps,
there was not such a few as that xe had no cause of appI'I-lIoIn-tions;
however, as Friduv had killed this wolf, the other that had fastened
upon the loose It ft. in. mcdiatcly, and Led, without doing him any
damage, lzaI lug happily fastened upon his head, where the Losses of
the lnidlo had stuck in his teeth But the man was most hurt; for
the raging IIIcatIIre had hit him twice, once in the arm, and the other
time a little alIuIe his knee: and though he had made some defence,
he was just. as it II (Ire tumbling down lny the disoider of his louse
when Friday came up and shot the wolf.

It is easy to suppose that at the noise of Friday's pistol we all

mended our pace. and rode up as fast as the way, which was Very
difficult, would give us leave, to see what was the matter. As soon as
we came clear of the trees, which blinded us before, we saw clearly
what had been the case, and how Friday had disengaged the poor
guide. though we did not presently discern what kind of creature it
was he had killed.

But never was a fight managed so hardily, and in such a surprising
manner, as that which followed,hetween Friday and the bear, which
gave us all, though at first we were surprised and afraid of him, the
greatest diversion imaginable. As the bear is a heavy, clumsy crea-
ture, and does not gallop as the wolf does, who is swift and light, so
he has two particular qualities, which generally are the rule of his
actions: first, as to men, who are not his proper prey (he does not
usually attempt them, except they first attack him, unless he he ex-
cessively hungry, which it is probable might now he the case, the
ground being covercd with snow). if you do not meddle with him. he
will not meddle with you; but then you must take care to be very
civil to him, nnd give him the road, for he is 5 very nice gentlemnn;
he will not go a step out of his way for sprinee; nay, it' you are
really afraid, your best way is to look another wuy, and keep going
on; for sometimes if you stop, and stand still, and look steadfastly at
him, he takes it for an affront; but if you throw or toss anything at
him, and it hits him, though it were but a. bit of stiek as big as your
finger, he thinks himself abused, nod sets all other business aside to
pursue his revenge, and will have satisfaction in point of honor; this
is his first quality: the next is, if he be once nfi'ronted, he will never
leave you, night or day, till he has his revenge, but follows at 11 good
round rate, till he overtakes you.

My man Friday hnd delivered our guide, and when we came up to
him, he was helping him off his horse, for the man was both hurt and
frightened, when, on a. sudden, we espiod the bear come out of the
Wood, and a vast, monstrous one it was, the biggest, by far, that ever
I saw. We were all a little surprised when we saw him; but when
Friday saw him, it was easy to see joy and courage in the fellow's
countenance; "O, 0, 0!" says Friday, three times, pointing to him;
" 0h muster! you give me to leave, me shakes to hand with him ; me
mukec you good laugh."

I was surprised to see the fellow so well pleased. " Yon foo ," says
I, "he will eat you up." "Eutee me Up ! erase me up E" says Friday,
twice over again ; "me some him up; me makes you good laugh;
you all stay here, me show you good laugh." 80 down he sits, and
gets 06' his boots in a. moment, and puts on a pair of pumps (as we
call the tint shoes they wear, sud which he had in his pocket), gives
my other servant his horse, and with his gun away he flew, swift like
the wind.

The hear was walkingsoftly on, and ofi'ered to meddle with nobody,
till Friday coming pretty near, cells to him, as if the bear could un.
derstand him, " Hark ye, hum-k ye," says Friday, "'me spenkee with
you." We thllowed at a. distance ; for now being come dowu on the
Gascony side of the mountains, we were entered a vast great forest,
where the country was plain and pretty open, though it had many
trees in it scattered here and there. Friday, who had, as we say, the
heels of the bear, come up with him quickly, and takes up a great
stone and throws it at him, and hit him just on the head, but did him
no more harm than if he had thrown it against a. wall ; but it answer-
ed Friday's end, for the rogue was so void of fear that he did it purely
to mnke the hour follow him, and show us " some laugh," as he called it>>
As soon as the bear felt the blow, and saw him, he turns about, and

11*
comes after him, taking devilish long strides and shuttling on at a
strange rate, such as would have put it horse to II middling gallop;
away runs l'riduy, and tukes his course as it' he ran towmd us tor
help ; so we all resolved to tire at once upon the bear, and deliver my
Imtn,' though I was angry at. him, heartily, for bringing the hear
back upon us, when he was going about his own business another
way; and especially 1 was angry that ho had turned the bear upon
us, and then run away : and 1 called out, " You dog, is this your ina-
king us laugh ? Come away, and take your horse, that we may shod
the creature." lle heard me, and cried out, " Nu shoot, no shoot;
stand still, and you get much laugh ," and us the nimble creature ran
two feet for the beat-'s one, he turned on n. sudden, on one side of us,
and seeing it great. oak tree, lit for his purpose, he beckoned to us to
follow ; and doubling his pace, he gets nimbly up the tree, laying his
gun down on the groumlmt about lire or six yards from the bottom of
the tree. The hour soon came to the tree, and we followed at a dis-
tance ; the first thing he did, he stopped at the gun, smelt of it, but
let it lie, and up he scrambles into the tree, climbing like a cat, though
so inomtrons heavy. I was amazed at the folly, usl thought it, of my
man, and could not. for my life, see anything to laugh at yet, till see-
ing the hour get up the tree, we all rode near to him.

When we came to the tree. there was Friday got out to the small
end of a large branch, and the bear got about hail' way to him. As
soon as the heat got out. to that part where the limb of the tree was
weaker, "Hit!" says he to us, "now you see me teaehce the bear
dance." So he fails a jumping and shaking the hough, at which the
boar hogan to tottor, but stood still and began to look behind him, to
see how he should get hook: then, indeed, we did laugh heat-lily.
But Friday lnnl not done with him by a. great deal; when seeing him
stand still. he calls out to him again, as if he had supposed the bear
rould speak English. " What, you come no further 1 Pray you come
farther." So he left jumping and shaking the tree: and the bear,
just us if he understood what he said, did come a little farther: then
he tell a jumping again. and the hour stopped again. We thought
now was a good time to luau-k him on the head, and called to Friday
to stand still and we would shoot the hear, but he cried out earnestly,
"0 pray ! 0 pray! no shoot, me shoot by and then 1" he would have
said by-and-luy. Iloweror. to shorten the story. Friday danced so
much, and the hour stood so tit'hlish, that we had laughing enough,
but still could not imagine what the fellow would do. for first we
thought he depended upon shaking the hear of; and we found the
best wes too Cunning for that, too, for he would not go out far enough
to be thrown down. but clings fnst with his great broad claws and
feet, so that we could not imagine what would he the end of it, and
what the jest would be at lust. But Friday puts us out of doubt
quickly, for seeing the beer cling fast to the heugh, and that he would
not be persuaded to come any farther, "Well, well," says Friday,
" you no come further, we go; you no come to me, me come to you ;"
and upon this he goes out to the smaller end of the hough, where it
would bend with his weight, and gently lets himself down by it, sli--
ding down the bough till he came near enough to jump down on his
feet, and away he runs to his gun, takes it up, and stands still. " Well,"
said I to him, " Friday, what will you do now? Why don't you shoot
him i" " No shoot," says Friday, " no yet; me no shoot now, me no
kill; me stay, give you one more luughf' indeed, so he did, as you
will see presently, for when the bear saw his enemy gone, he comes
back from the hongh where he stood, but did it mighty cautiously
looking behind him every step, and coming backward till he got into
the body of the tree, then, with the same hinder-end foremost, he came
down the tree, grasping it with his claws, and moving one feet at a
time, very leisurely. At this junetore, and just before he could set
his hind-foot on the ground, Friday stepped up close to him, clapped
the muzzle of his piece in his ear, nod shot him dead. Then the
rogue turned about to see if we did not laugh; and when he saw we
were pleased, by our looks, he falls alanghing himself very loud.
"So we kill hear in my country," says Friday. "' So you kill them 2"
says I, " why, you have no guns." "No," says he, " no gun, but shoot
great much long arrow." This was a good diversion to us; but we
were still in a wild place, and our guide very much hurt, and what to
do we hardly knew. The howling of wolves run much in my head;
and, indeed, except the noise 1 once heard on the shore of Africa, of
which I have said something already, I never heard anything that
filled me with so much horror.

These things, and the approach of night, called us off, or else, as
Friday would have had us. we should cul'minly have taken the skin
of this monstrous creature oil', which was worth saving; but we had
near three leagues to go, and our guide hastened us, so we left him,
and went forward on our journey.

The ground was still covered with snow, though not so deep and
dangerous as on the mountains. and the ravenous creatures, as we
heard afterward, were come down into the forest and plain country,
pressed by hunger, to seek for food, and had done a great deel of mil-
chiefin the villages, where they surprised the country people, killed
a great many of their sheep and horses, and some people, too. We
had one dangerous place to pass, of which our guide told us, if there
were more wolves in the country we should find them there; and this
was a. small plain, surrounded with woods on every side, and u long
narrow defile or lane, which we were to pass to get. through the
wand, and then we should come to the village where we were to lodge.
it was within a hall'nu hour of sunset when we entered the first wood,
and a little after sunset when we came into the plain. We met. with
nothing in the first wood, except that, in it little plain within the
wood, which was not above two furlongs over, we saw five great
wolves cross the road, fail speed, one after another, as if they had
been in chase of some prey, and had it in View; they took no notice
of IN, and were gone out. of sight. in a. few moments. Upon this our
guide, who, hy-the-way, was but u faint-hearted fellow, bid us keep
in a ready posture, for he believed there were more wolves a. coming.
"'0 kept our arms ready, and our eyes about us, but. we saw no more
wolves till we came through that Wood, which was near half a league,
and entered the ldain. As soon as we came into the plain we had
occasion enough to look about us; the first object we met, with was it
dead horse, that is to say, a poor horse w lneh the wolves had killed, and
at least a dozen of them at. work, we could not say eating of him, but
picking of his hones, rather, for they had eaten up all the tlesh before.
We did not think lit to disturb them at their feast, neither did they
take much notice of us. Friday would have let fly at them, but!
would not sulfur him, by any means. for 1 (hand we were like to have
more business upon our hands than we Wore aware of. We were not
gone halfevvr the plain when we hogan to hear the wolves howl in
the wood on our left. in a frightful manner, and presently after we
saw about a. hundred coming on directly toward us. all in a body, and
most of them in a line, as regularly as an army, drawn up by an ex-
perienced oiliror. I scarce knew in what manner to receive them,
but found [0 draw ourselves in a close line was the only way, so we
fornwd in a moment; hut, that we might not have too much interval.
I ordered that only every other man should tire, and that the other;
who had not fired. should stand ready to give them a second volley
immediately, if they continued to advance upon us; and then, that
those who had fired at first should not pretend to lead their fuaecs
again. hut stand ready every one with a pistol, for we were all armed-
with It fusee and a pair of pistols each man: so we were, lly this
method, able to lire six volleys, half of us at>>. time. However, at
present, we had no necessity, for upon firing the first volley the em
my mode a full stop, being terrified as well with the noise as with the
fire; four of them, being shot in the head, dropped; several other:
were wounded, and went bleeding 08', as we could see by the snow.
1 found they stopped, but did not immediately retreat; whereupom
remembering that I had been told that the fiercest creatures were tor-
ritied at the voice of a man, I caused all the company to hulloo as
loud as we could; and i found the notion not altogether mistnken, for
upon our shout they began to retire and turn about. 1 then ordered
a second volley to be fired in their rear, which put them to the gal-
lop, and away they went to the woods. This gave us leisure to charge
our pieces again, and that we might lose no time, we kept going;
but we hxtd but little more than loaded our fusees, and put- ourselves
in readiness, when we heard :- terrible noise in the sumo wood, on-
onr left, only that it was further onward, the some way we were
to go.

The night was coming on, and the light began to be dusky, which
made it worse on our side ; but the noise increasing, we could easily
perceive that it was the howling and yelling of those hellish creatures ;
and on n. sudden we perceived two or three troops of wolves, one on
our left, one behind us, and one in our front, so that we seemed to be
surrounded with them; however, as they did not full upon us, we kept
our way forward, as fast as we could make our horses go, which, the
way being very rough, was only a good hard trot. In this manner
we came in View of the entrnnce of the wood, through which we were
to pass, at the farther side of theplain; but we were greatly surprised,
when, coming nearer the lane or pass, we saw a confused number of
wolves standing just at the entrance. On a sudden, at {another open
ing of a wood, We heard the noise ofa gun, and looking that way out
rushed tt horse, with a saddle and bridle on him. flying like the wind,
and sixteen or seventeen Wolves ofter him, full speed; indeed, the
horse had the heels of them, but as we supposed that he could not
hold it that rate, we doubted not but they would get up with him at
net ; no question but they did.

lint here we had a most horrible sight; for riding up to the en.
trance where the horse come out, we found the cnrcnsses of another
horse and two men, devoured by the ravenous creatures; and one or
the men was no doubt the same whom we heard fire the gun, for
there lay it gun just by him fired at? ; but as to the man, his head and
the upper part of his body were eaten up. This filled us with horror
and we knew not what course to take; but the creatures resolved u.
soon, for they gathered about us presently, in hopes of prey ; and !
verily believe there were three hundred of them. It happened very
much to our advantage, that at the entrance into the wood,butl
little way from it, there luy some large timber trees, which had been
cut down the summer before, and I supposed lay there for carriage.
I drew my little troop in among those trees, and placing ourselves in
5 line behind one long tree, l advised them all to slight, and keeping
that tree belore no for o. hrenstwork, to stand iu a triangle or three
{route enclosing our horses in the centre. We did so and it. was well
we did ; for never wax u more furious charge than the creatures
made upon us in this place. They came on with n growling kind of
noise, and mounted the piece of timber, which, as I said, was our
breastwork, us if they were only rushing upon their prey; and this
fury of theirs, it seems, was principally occasioned by their seeing
our horses behind us. I ordered our men to lire as before, every other
man ; and they took their niuis so sure, that they killed several of the
wolves ut the first volley; but there was a necessity to keep e co.
tinual firing, for they came on like devils, those behind pushing on
those before.

When we had fired a. second volley of our fuses, we thought they
stopped a little, and I hoped they would have gone 03'; but it was
out n moment, for others came forward again; so we fired two vol-
leys of our pistols ; and I believe in these four firings we killed seven-
teen or eighteen of them, and lumed twice as many, yet they came on
again. I was loath to spend our shot too hastily; sol called my
servant, not my mun Friday, for he was better employed, for, with
the greatest. dexterity imaginable, he had charged rny fnsce and his
own while we were engaged; but as I said 1 called my other man,
and giving him a horn of powder, I bade him lay a train all along the
piece of timber, and let it be a large train. He did so; and had but
just time to get away, when the Wolves come up to it, and some got
upon it, when I. snapping an uncharged pistol close to the powder
sot it on fire; those that were upon the timber were scorched with it
and six or seven of them foil or rather jumped in among us, with the
1? rec and fright of the. fire; we dispatched those in an instant, and the
rest were so frightened with the light, which the night, for it was
now very dark, made more terrible, that they drew back a little:
upon which I ordered our last pistols to be fired off in one volley, and
after that we gave a shout; upon this the wolves turned tail, and we
sallicd immediately upon near twenty lame ones, that we found strug-
gling on the ground, and fell a cutting them with our swords, which
snswered our expectation ; for the crying and howling they made was
better understood by their follows; so that they all tied and left us.

We lmd,first and last, killed about three score of them; and had it
been daylight, we had killed many more. The field of battle being
thus cleared, we made forward again, for we had still near a league
to go. We heard the ravenous creatures howl and yell in the woods
as we went, several times, and sometimes we fancied we saw some at
them, but the snow dazzling our eyes, we were not certain; in about
In hour more we came to the town where we were to lodge, which
we found in a terrible fright, and all in arms; for, it seems, the night
before, the wolves and some beers had broke into the village, and put
them in such terror, that they were obliged to keep guard night and
day, but especially in the night, to preserve their cattle, and, indeed
their people.

The next morning our guide was so ill, and his limbs swelled so
much with the rankling of his two Wounds, that he could go no
farther; so we were obliged to take a new guide here, and go to
Toulouse, where we found a warm climate, a fruitful, pleasant
country, and no snow, no wolves, nor anything like them ; but when
we told our story nt- 'l'oulousc, they told us it was nothing but what
was ordinary in the great forest at the foot of the mountains, espe-
cially when the snow lay on the ground; but they inquired much
what kind of a guide we had got, who would venture to bring us that
way in such it severe season ; and told us it was surprising we were
not all devoured. When we told them how we placed ourselves, and
the horses in the middle, they blamed us exceedingly, and told us it
was fifty to one but we had been all destroyed 5 for it was the sight of
the horses which made the wolves so furious, seeing their prey; and
that, at other times, they are really afraid of a gun; but being ex-
cessive hungry, and raging on that account, the eagerness to come at
the horses had made them senseless of danger; and that if we had
not, by the continued fire, and at last by the stratngcm of the train of
powder, mastered them, it had been great odds but that we had heen
torn to pieces ; that. whereas, had we been content to have sat still on
horseback, and fired as horsemen, they would not have taken the
horses so much for their own, when men were on their backs, as
otherwise ; and withal they told us, that, at last, if we had stood alto-
gether. and left our horses, they would have been so eager to have
devoured them, that we might have come of? safe, especially having
our tire-arms in our hands, and being so many in number. For my
part, I was never so sensible of danger in my life; for seeing above
three hundred devils conm roaring and open-mouthed to devour us,
nod having nothing to sht'llor us, or wheat. to, I gave ntyM'll' ovor
for loxt; and, as it "11.1.1 laniuvt: 1 shall never care to cross those

'l though l was suro to nicct with n. storm once a work.

My principal guide and privy counnvllor was my good ancient

N'vurity of my ('lli'l'l.$1 and, indeed, l was very happy from the be-
ginning, and now to the end, in the unspottcd integrity of this good
gt'nllt'wunmn.

I now resolved to dispose of my plantar ion in tho. Brnzils. if] could
find means. For this pnrposo, I wrote to my old frit'nd at: Lishon,
who having olli-rrd it. to the. two movvhants, tho Survivors of my
trustocs, who li\'t'll in the lirazils, lht'y accepted the offer, and re-
mittud thirty-thrvo thousand pieces of right to a correspondent of
tin'it-s :tt l.i.~imn. to pay for it. llaving rigncd tho. instrumt'nt of sale.
and it'nl' it to my old friend. he routittt'd nte hills of exchange for
thirty-two thousand night lutndrod pit-tars of eight for the estate, ro-
aorviug tln- pzn'mt'nl of a hundred moidoros 0 year to himself during
his life. and fifty moidurcs afterward to his son for life, which I had
promist-d them.

Though I had sold my estate in the Brnzils. yet I could not hoop
the country out of my hand : nor could I resist the strong inclination
lhad to 5m: my island. My true friend, the widow, earnestly dis-
Sll:\tlt'll m0 from it. and so far prevailed with mo. that for almost sown
years, she prt'vontod my running abroad: during which time I took
my two nophows. the children of one of my hrothcrs. into my aim:
tln'. oldest. hat ing sonwthing of his own. I hrt'd up as a gr'nth'nn'n,
and gave him a settlement of some addition to his t'statt', aftt'r my
dccenso. The other I put out to a captain of a ship; and after five
years, finding him a sensible, bold, enterprising young fellow, I put
him intoa good ship. and sent him to sea: and this young fellow
afterward drew me in, old as l was, to further :ulventures myrelf.

In the meantime, Iin part settled myself here; for, first. of all, I
married, and that not either to my disadvantage or dissatisfitction,
and had three children, two sons and one daughter; but my wife
dying, and my nephew coming home with good success from a voyage
to Spain, my inclination to go abroad and his inrportunity prevailed,
and engaged me to go in his ship as a private trader to the East
Indies: this was in the year 160 I.

But these things, with some very surprising incidents in some new
adventures of my own, for ten years more, l shall give a further ac-
count of.

That homely proverb used on so many occasions in England, viz.,
"That. what. is bred in the bone will not go out of the flesh," was
never more verified than in the story of my life. Any one would
think that, after five years' atllietion, and a variety of unhappy cir-
cumstances; which few men, it any, ever went through hel'ore, and
after near seven years of peace and enjoyment in the fullness of all
things, grown old, and when, if ever, it. might be allowed me to have
had experience of every state of middle life, and to know which was
most adapted to make a man completely happy ; I say, after all this,
any one would have thought that. the native propensity to rambling,
which I gave an account of in my first setting out in the world to
have been so predominant in my thoughts, should he worn out, the
volatile part. be fully evacuated, or at least condensed, and I might,
at sixty-one years of age, have been a little inclined to stay at home
and have done venturing life and fortune any more.

Nay, further, the common motive of foreign adventures was taken
away in me; for I had no fortune to make; I had nothing to seek:
if I had gained ten thousand pounds,I had been no richer; for I had
already sufficient for me, and for those I had to leave it to: and that
1 had was visihly increasing; for having no great- family, I could not
spend the income of whntl had, unless I would set up for an ex-
pensive way of living, such as a great family, servants, equipage,
gayety, and the like, which were things I had no notion ot',or inclina.
tion to: so that l had nothing indeed to do but. to sit still, and fully
enjoy what I had got, and see it increase daily upon my hands. Yet
all these. things had no efi'ect- upon me, or at least not enough to resist
the strong inclination l had to go abroad again. which hung about
me like a chronicle distemper. In particular, the desire of seeing my
new plantation in the island, and the colony I left there, no in my
head continually. I dreamed of it 1111 night, and my imagination run
upon it 111] day; it. was uppermost in all my thoughts: and my fancy
workod so stoodily 111111 strongly upon it, that. I talked of it. in my
11111111: in short. nothing could remove it out of my mind: it oven
11roko so 1'i11l-1ntly into 1111 my discourses, that. it. made my conversa-
tion 11111151111111, 1111' I could talk of nothing ohm: 1111 my discourse run
into it, even to importinoucc,' and I 111111! it myself.

related to me lay the first Spaniard and Friday's father, that it. was
lurpnsing: they told me how they berberously attempted to murder
.11 the Spaniards, and that they set fire to the provisions they had laid
up, on purpose to distress and starve them; things that I had never
heard of, and that indeed were never all of them true in fact; but it
was so warm in my imagination, and so realized to me, that, to the
hour I saw them, I could not be persuaded but that it was, or would
be true: also how I resented it, when the Spaniards complained to me ,
Ind how I brought them to justice, tried them before me, and ordered
them all three to be hanged. What there was really in this shall be
seen in its place: for however I come to form such things in my
dream, and what secret converse of spirits injected it, yet there was,
I say, much of it true. I own that this dream had nothing in it liter-
ally and specifically true ; but the general part was so true, the base,
villanous behavior of these three hardened rogues was such, and had
been so much worue than all I can describe, that the dream had too
much oimilitude of the fact; and as I would afterward have punished
them severely, so, if 1 had hanged them all, I had been much in the
right, and even should have been justified by the laws both of God
and man. But to return to my story. In this kind of temper I lived
some years; 1 had no enjoyment of my life, no plerwunt hours, no
agreeable diversion, but what had something or other of this in it; so
that my wife, who saw my mind wholly bent upon it, told me very se
riously One. night, that she believed there was some secret powerful im-
pulse of Providence upon me, which had determined me to go thither
again; and that she found nothing hindered my going, but my being
engaged to a wife and children. She told me, that it was true she
could not think of parting with me; but no she was assured, that if
she was dead it would he the first thing I would do, So, as it seemed
to her that the thing was determined above, she would not be the
only obstruction ; for, ifl thought lit, and resolved to go Here
she found me very intent upon her words, and that I looked very
earnestly at. her, so that it. a little disordered her, and she stopped. I
asked her why she did not go on, and say out what- she was going to
say. But I perceived that her heart was too full, and some tears
stood in her eyes. " Speak out, my dear," said I; " are you willing I
should go 2" "No," says she, very affectionately, "I am far from
milling: but if you are resolved to go," says she, "and rather than I
would be the only hinderance,I will go with you: for though I think
it e nnst preposterous thing for one of your years, and in your eon
ditiou, yet if it must be," said she, again weeping," I would not leave
you; for if it be of Heaven, you must do it ; there is no resisting it
and if Heaven make it your duty to go, he will also make it mine tl
go with you, or otherwise dispose of me, that I may not obstruct it."

This alfactionate behavior of my wife's brought me a little out of
the vapors, and I began to consider what] WM doing; I corrected
my wandering funny, and I began to argue with myself sedately, what
business l had, after three-score yearn, and after such a life of tedious
sufferings and disasters. and closed in so happy and easy a manner--l
say, what. business had I to rush into new hazards, and put mytull'
upon adventures tit only for youth and poverty to run into?

With these thoughts I considered my new engagements; that 1 had
a Wife, one child born, and my wife then great with child ofnnothor;
that I had all the world could give me, and had no need to seek hazard
for gain ; that I was declining in years, and ought to think rather of
leaving what I had gained, than of seeking to increase it; that as
to what my wife had said of its being an impulse of Heaven, and that
it should be my duty to go, _l had no notion of that; so, after many
of these cogitations, I struggled with the power of my imagination.
reasoned myself out of it, no] believe people may always do in like
cases if they will: and in a word, I conquered it; composed myself
with snob arguments as occurred to my thoughts, and which my pres-
ent condition furnished me pleutifully with; and particularly, as the
most ell'ectnal method, 1 resolved to divert myself with other things,
and to engage in mine business that might efl'eehmlly tie me up from
any more excursions of this kind ; for I found that- thiug return upon
me chiefly when l was idle, and had nothing to do, nor anything of
moment immediately before me. To this purpose I bought a little
farm in the county of Redford, and resolved to remove myself thither.
I had a little convenient house upon it : and the land about- it, 1 found
was capable of great improvement : and it was many ways suited to
my inclination, which delighted in cultivating, managing, planting,
and improving of land; and particularly, being an inland county, I
was removed from conversing among sailors, and things relating to
remote parts of the world.

ln a word. I went down to my form, settled my family, bought mo
ploughx, barrows, a cart. wagon, horses, cows, and sheeoand setting
seriously to work, became in one half year, a more. country gentle-
man : my thoughts were entirely taken up in managing my servants,
cultivating the ground, enclosing, planting. &e.: and i lived, as I
thought, the most agreeable life that. nature was capable of directing,
or that a man always bred to misfortunes was capable of retreating to.

l farmed upon my own land ; 1 bed no rent. to pay, was limited by
no articles; I could pull up or cut down as I pleased what I planted
was for myself, and what 1 improved was for my family ; and having
thus left oil the thoughts of murdering, I had not the least discoln'
fort in any part of life as to this world. Now I thought, indeed, that
I enjoyed the middle state of life which my fatherm earnestly recom-
mended to me, and lived a kind of heavenly lit'e, something like what
a doleribed by the poet. upon the subject of a country life----

" --l'rl-e from vices, {rec from core.
Age luau no pain, and youth no snare."

But. in the middle of all this felicity, one blow from unseen Provi-
dence unhinged me at once; and not. only made a breach upon me
inevitable and incurable, but drove me, by its consequences, intoa
deep relapse of the wandering disposition, which, an I may say, being
born in my very blood, soon rccurercd its hold of me, and, like the
returns ol' a violent distemper, came on with an irresistible force upon
me. This blow was the loss of my wife. it is not my business here
to write an elegy upon my wife, give u. character of her particular
virtues, and make my court to the sex by the flattery of a funeral
sermon. She was, in a few words, the stay of all my affairs, the cen-
tre of all my enterprises, the engine that, by her prudence. reduced
me to that happy compass] was in, from the moat extravagant and
ruinous project that fluttered in my head, as above, and did more to
guide my rambling genius than a mother's tears, a father's instruc-
tions, a friend's counsel, or my own reasoning powers, could do. I
was happy in listening to her tears, and in being moved by her en
treaties; and to the last degree desolate and dislocated in the world
by the loss of her.

When she was gone, the world looked awkwardly round me. I
was as much a stranger in it, in my thoughts, as l was in the llrazils,
when 1 first went on shore there; and as much alone, except as to the
assistance of servants, as I was in my island. I knew neither what
to think nor what to do. I saw the world busy around Inc ; one part
laboring for bread, another unandering iu vile excesses or empty
pleasures, equally miserable, because the end they proposed still fled
from them: for the men of pleasure every day aurfcited of their vice,
and heaped up work for sorrow and repentance; and the men of
labor spent their strength in daily struggling; for bread to maintain
the vital strength they labored with; so living in a daily circulation
on sorrow, living but to Work, and working butto live, as if daily bread
were the only end of a wearisome life, and e \vearisome life the only
occasion of daily bread.262 Amen-rears or

This put me in mind of the life I lived in my kingdom, the island;
where I suffered no more corn to grow because I did not- want it, and
bred no more goats, because 1 had no more use for them ; where the
money lay in the drawer till it grew muddy, and had scarce the favor
to be looked upon in twenty years.

All these things, had I improved them as I ought to have done, and
as reason and religion had dictated to me, would have taught me to
search farther than human enjoyments for a foil felicity; and that
there was something which certainly was the reason and end of life,
superior to all these things, and \\ hich was either to he possessed, or
at least hoped for, on this side the grate.

But my sage counsellor was gone; I was like a ship without a pilot,
that could only run aforc the wind: my thoughts ran all away again
into the old afi'air; my head was quite turned with the whimsies of
foreign adventures; and all the pleasant innocent amusements of my
form, my garden, my cattle, and my family, which before entirely
possessed me, were nothing to me, had no relish, and were like music
to one that has no car. or food to one that has no taste; in a word, I
resolved to heave ofi' housekcel'aing, let- my farm, and return to Lon-
don; and in a few months after I did so.

"'hen I came to London,l was still as uneasy as I was before; I
had no relirh for the place, no employment in it, nothing to do but to
saunter about like an idle person, ct" whom it may he said he is per-
fectly useless in God's creation, and it is not. one farthing's matter to
the rest of its kind whether he be (lead or alive. This also was the
thing which. of all other circumstances of life, was the most my arm--
sion, who had been all my days used to an active life; and I would
often say to myself: a state of idleness is the very drags of life; and
indeed, I thought- I was much more suitably employed when I was
twentyvsix days making me a deal-hoard.

It was now the beginning of the year 1693, when my nephew, whom=
as l have observed before, I had brought up to the sea,an(l had made
him commander of a ship, was come home from a short voyage to
Billion7 being the first he had made. He came to me, and told me
that some merchants. of his acquaintance, had been proposing to him
to go a voyage for them to the East Indies and to China, as private
traders. " And now, uncle," says he, " if you will go to sea with mo,
I will engage to land you upon your old habitation in the island; for
we are to touch at the "mails."

Nothing can be It greater demonstration of a future state, and of
the existence of an invisible world, than the concurrence of second
causes with the ideas of things which we form in our minds, perfectly
reserved, and not communicated to any in the world.

My nephew knew nothing how far my distemper of wandering was
returned upon me, and I knew nothing of what he had in his thoughts
to say, when the very morning before he came to me, I had,in ugreat
deal of confusion of thought, and revolving every part of my circum-
stances in my mind, come to this resolution, viz., that I would go to
Lisbon, and consult with my old semcuptain ; and so, if it was rational
and practicable, I would go and see the island again, and see what
was become of my people there. I had pleased myself with the
thoughts of peupling the place, and carrying inhabitants from hence,
getting a patent for the possession, and I knew not what; whenin the
middle of all this, in comes my nephew, us I have said with his pro-
ject of carrying me thither in his way to the East Indies.

I paused uwhilo at his words, and, looking steadily at him, " What
devil," said I, " sent you on this unlucky errand '1" My nephew stored,
as if he had been frightened, at first; but perceiving that I was not so
much displeased with the proposal, he recovered himself. " I hope
it may not he an unlucky proposal, sir," says he; "1 dare say you
would be pleased to see your new colony there, where you once
reigned with more felicity than most of your brother monarchs in the
world."

In a. word, the scheme hit so exactly with my temper, that is to
say, the prepossession I was under, and of which 1 have said so much,
that I toll him, in a few words, if he agreed with the merchants, I
would go with him; but I told him I would not promise to go any
further than my own island. "Why, sir," says he, "you don't want
to he left there again, I hope." "VV'hy," said I, "can you not take
me up on your return i" Ile told me it would not be possible to do
so ; that the merchants would never allow him to come that way with
a laden ship of such value, it being a. month's sail out of his way, and
might be three or four. Besides, sir, if I should misoarry," said he,
" and not return at all, then you would be just reduced to the con-
dition you were in before."

This was very rational, but we both found outaremedy for it,
which was to carry a framed sloop on board the ship, which being
taken in pieces and shipped on board the ship, might, by the help of
some carpenters whom we agreed to carry with us, be set up again in
the island, and finished, fit to go to sea, in a few days.

I was not long resolving, for indeed the importunities of my nephew,
joined so efi'ectually with my inclination that nothing could oppose
me ; on the other hand, my wife being dead, I had nobody concerning
themselves so much lur me as to persuade me to one way or the other,
except my ancient good friend the widow, who earnestly struggled
with me to consider my years, my easy circumstances, and the need-
less hazards of 0 long voyage--and, above all, my young children.
But it was all to no purpose; I had an irresistible desire to the voy-
age, and I told her I thought there was something so uncommon in
the impression I had upon my mind for the voyage, that it would be
a kind of resisting Providence if] should attempt to stay at home;
after which she ceased hcr expostnlations, and joined with me, not
only in making provision for my voyage, but also in settling my
{Eunily affairs for my absence, and providing for the education of my
children.

In order to this I made my will, and settled the estate I had in
such a manner for my children, and placed in such hands that- I was
perfectly easy, and satisfied they would have justice done them, what-
e\cr might hefall me; and for their education, I left it wholly to the
w idow, with nsullirient maintenance to herseil'fiir her care; all which
she. richly deserved, for no mother could have taken more care in
thoir education, or understood it hotter; and as she lived till I came
home, I also lived to thank her for it.

My uni-how was ready to sail about the beginning of January,
16H-- .i. and I. with my mun Friday, went on hoard in the Downs the
9th; having, hos-ides that sloop which I mentioned ahove, u very eon-
sidoraldo cargo of all kinds of necessary things for my colony ; which,
il' I did not Iind it in good condition, I resolved to leave so.

First, I carried with me some servants, whom I proposed to place
there as inlmhitants, or at least to set on work there, upon my own
account, while I stayed, and either to leave them there or carry them
forward. as they would appear willing; particularly, I carried two
carpenters, a smith, and a very handy, ingenious fellow, who was a
cooper by trade, and was also a general mechanic, for he was dexter-
oua :1: making wheels. and hand-mills to grindcorn--was agood turn-
er and a good pot-maker: he also made anything that was proper

itn make of earth. or of wood: in a word, we called him our Jaekmf--
all-trades. With those I carried a tailor, who had offered himself to
go a passenger to the East. Indies with my nephew, hut afterward
consented to stay on our new plantation, and proved amost necessary
handy follow as could he desired, in many other businesses besides

that of his Irad9; for, as I observed formerly, necessity arms as for
all employments.
My cargo, as near as I can recollect, for I had not kept account of
the particulars, consisted of n. sutlicient quantity of linen, and some
English thin stutl's, for clothing the Spaniards that I expected to find
there, and enough of them, as by my calculation, might comfortably
supply them for seven years. If I remember right, the materials I'
carried for clothing them, with gloves. huts, shoes, stockings, and all
such things as they could want for wearing, amounted to about two
hundred pounds--including some beds, bedding, and household stnfi',
particularly kitchen utensils, with pots, kettles, pewter, brass, &c.,
and near a hundred pounds more. in iron-work, nails. tools of deg"cry
kind, staples, hooks, hinges, and every necessary thing I could
think of.

I carried, also, a hundred spnrc arms, muskets, and fusees, besides
some pistols, u. considerable quantity of shot, of all sizes, three or four
tons of lead, and two pieces of brass cunnon ; and, because I knew not
what time and what extremities I was providing for, I carried a. hun-
dred barrels of powder, besides swords, cutlasses, and the iron part
of some pikes and hnlbcrds, so that, in short, we had a large magn--
zine of oil sorts of stores; and I made my nephew carry two small
quarter-deck guns more than he wanted for his ship, to leave behind
if there was occasion, that when we come there we might build a.
fort, and man it against all sorts of enemies; and, indeed, I at first
thought there would he need enough for all, and much more, if we
hoped to maintain our possession of the island, as shall be seen in the
course of this story.

I had not such bad luck in this voyage as I had been used to meet
with, and, therefore, shall have the less occasion to interrupt the
render, who, perhaps, may be impatient to hear how matters went
with my colony ; yet some old accidents, cross winds, and bad
weather, happened on this first setting out, which made the voyage
longer than I expected at first; and I, who had never made but one
voyage, via, my first voyage to Guinea, in which I might be said to
come buck again, as the voyage was at first designed, began to think
the same ill fate attended me, and that I was born to be never
contented with being on shore, and yet to be always unfortunate at
sea.

Contrary winds first put us to the northward, and we were obliged
to put in at Galway, in Ireland, where we lay wind--hound two-and-
twenty days - but we had this satisfaction with the disaster, that pro-
visions were here exceeding cheap, and in the utmost plenty; so that
while we lay here we never touched the ship's stores, but rather-

ndded to them. Here, also, I took in several live hogs, and two cows
with their calves, which I resolved. if I had a good passege,to put on
shore in my island; but we found occasion to dispose otherwile of
them.

Q E set out on the 5th of Februnry from Ireland, and had a
very fair gale of wind for some duyu. As I remember, it
1% might be about the 20th of February, in the evening late,
when the mate, having the watch, come into the round-
heuse, and told us he snw a flush of fire, and heard a gun fired ; and
while he was telling us of it, a boy came in and told us the bentswuin
heard another. This unule us all run out upon the quarter-deck,
where, for it while, we heard nothing, but in a few minutes we saw a
very great light and found that there was some very terrible fire at. a
distance. Immediately we had recourse to our reckonings, in which
we all ngrccd that there could he no land that way in which the fire
showed itself, no, not for five hundred leagues, for it appeared at W.
N. \V. Upon this we concluded it muet be some ship on fire at sea;
and us, by our hearing the noise of guns just hcfere, we concluded it
could not be for oli', we stood directly townrd it, nnd were presently
satisfied we should discover it. hecuuso, the farther we sailed, the
greater the light appeared, though, the weather being hazy, we could
not perceive anything but the light forn while. In nheut half an
hour's sailing. the wind being fair for us, though not. much of it, and
the weather clearing up it little, we could plainly discern that. it was
a great ship on fire, in the middle of the sea.

I one most sensibly touched with this disnslcr, though not at all
acquainted with the persons engaged in it; I presently recolleeted my
former circumstances, and in whnt condition I was in, when taken up
l-y the Portuguese captain; and how much more deplorable the circum-
stances of the poor creatures belonging to thnt ship must be, if they
hnd no other ship in company with them. Upon this, I immedintcl y
ordered thnt five guns should be fired. one soon after another, that. if
possible, we might give notice to them that there was help for thoni
at hand, and that they might endeavor to save themselves in their
host; for though we. could ace the flames of the ship,yet they. it
being night, could loo nothing of In.
We lny by for some time upon this, only driving as the burning ship
drove, waiting for daylight ; when, on'a sudden, to our great terror,
though we lmd reason to expect it, the ship blew up in the air; and
immediately, that is to any, in a. few minutes, all the fire was out, that
is to say, the rest of the ship sunk. This was terrible, and indeed on
nfllicting sight, for the sake of the poor men ; who, I concluded, must
he either all destroyed in the ship, or he in the utmost distress in their
bent, in the middle of the ocean; which, at present, by reason it was
dnrk, I could not see. However, to direct them as well as I could, I
caused lights to he hung "out in all parts of the ship where we could,
end which we had lanterns for, and kept firing guns all the night
long; letting them know, by this, that there wns n. ship not. for oil'.

At about eight o'clock in the morning we discovered the ship's
boots by aid ofour perspective glasses; found there were two of them,
both throngrd with people, and deep in the water. "'0 perceived
they rowed, the wind being against them; that they saw our ship, and
did their utmost to let us we them.

We immediately spread our ancicnt. to let them know we saw them,
and hung at waft out, as a signal for them to come on board; and
then mndc more sail, standing directly to them. In little more than
hnlt'nn hour we came up Willi them; and, in n. word, took them all
in, being no less than sixty-four men, women, and children; for there
were a. great many passengers.

Upon the whole, we found it wns n. French merchant ship of three
hundred tons, hmne-bound from Quebec, in the river of Canada. The
master gave us it long account of the distress of his ship ; how the fire
began in tho steeregc, by the negligence of the steersmnn; but on
his crying out fur help, was. as everybody thought, entirely put out;
but they soon found that some sparks of the first fire had gotten into
some part of the ship so difficult to come at, that they could not
efi'cctunlly quench it; and afterward getting in between the timbers,
and within the ceiling of the ship, it proceeded intothe hold, and
mastered all the skill and all the application they were able to
exert.

They lmd no more to do then, but to get into their boots, which, to
their great comfort, were pretty large; heing their long-bent, and
their great shnlIOp, besides a small skiff, which was of no great ser-
vice to them, other than to get smne fresh water and provisions into
her, after they had secured their lives from the fire. They had, in-
deed. small hope of their lives by getting into these boats, at that
distance from any land; only,.as they said well, that they were e54268 Lorna-cans or

coped from the fire, and a possibility that some ship might happen to
be at sea, and might take them in. They had sails, oats, and it com-
pm ,: and wore preparing to make the best of their way back to
Newfoumlland, the wind blowing pretty fair, for it blew an easy gale
at S. l'}. by E. They had us much provision and water, as, with
sparing it, so as to be next door to starving, might. support them about
twelve days; in which, if they had no bad weather, and no contrary
winds. the captain said he hoped he might get to the Banks of New-
foundland, and might perhaps take some fish, to sustain them till they
might go on shore. But- thcrc were so many chances ngainstthem in
all these cases, such as storms, to overs-ct and founder them; rains
and cold, to bennmh and perish their limbs; contrary winds, to keep
them out and starve them ; that it must have been next to miraculous
if they had escaped.

la the midst of their consternation, every one being hopeless and
ready to despair, the captain, with tears in his eyes, told me they
were on a sudden surprised with thejoy of hearing a. gunfire, and
after that four more; these were the five guns which I caused to be
fired at. lirst seeing the light This revived their hearts, and gave them
the notice, which, as above, I desired it should, viz., that there was a.
ship at hand for their help. lt was upon the hearing ul'these guns
that. they took down their masts and sails; the sound coming from the
windward, they resolved to lie by till morning. Some time after this,
hearing no more guns, they fired three. muskets, one a considerable
while alter another; but these, tlie wind being contrary, we never
heard.

Some. time after that again, they were still more agreeably sur-
prised with seeing our lights, and hearing the guns which, as l have
said, I caused to he fired all the rest. of the night; this set'them to
work with their ours, to keep their boats ahead. at least, that we
might the. sooner come up with them ; and, at last, to their inexpres~
sible joy, they timnd we saw them.

It is impossible for me to express the several gestures, the. strange
eestaeics, the. variety of postures, whirl: these. poor delivered people
run into, to express the joy of their souls at so unexpected n deliver-
ance. Grief and fear are easily described: sighs, tears. groans, 21:41
WT." few motions of the head and hands, make. up the sum (:fits
variety: but. an excess of joy, a surprise of'joy, has a thousand ex-
travaganees in it : there were some in tears: some raging: and tearing
themselves, as if they had been in the greatest nannies nfsnrrnw: some
stark raving, and downrignt lunatic ; some ran about the ship stamping
with their feet, others wringing their hands; eome were dancing, some
singing, some laughing, more crying; many quite dumb, not able to
speak a word ; ozhcrs sick and vomiting ; several swoouing, and
ready to faint; and a few were crossing themselves, and giving God
thanks.

I would not wrong them neither; there might be many that were
thankful afterward, but the passion was too strong for them at first.
and they were not able to master it ; they were thrown into eestacies,
and a kind of frenzy ; and it was but a very few that were composed
and serious in their joy.

Perhaps, also, the case may have some addition to it from the par.
ticular circumstance of that nation they belonged to; I mean the
French, whose temper is allowed to be more volatile, more passionate,
and more sprightly, and their spirits more fluid, than in other nations.
I am not philosopher enough to determine the cause; but nothing I
had ever seen before came up to it. The eestacies poor Friday, my
trusty savage, was in, when he found his father in the hunt, came the
the nearest to it, and the surprise ofthe nnmter and his two compan-
ions, whom I delivered from the villains that set them on shore in
the island. came a little way toward it ; but nothing was to compare
to this, either that l saw in Friday, or anywhere else in my life.

It is further observable, that these extruvnganees did not show
themselves, in that different manner I have mentioned, in dill'erent
persons only ; but all the variety would appear, in a short sueccSSion
of moments, in one and the same person. A man that we saw this
minute dumb, and as it were stupid and confounded, would the next
minute be dancing and hallooing like on antic; and the next moment
be touring his hair or pulling his clothes to pieces, and stamping them
under his feet like a madman; in a. few moments after that, we
would have him all in tears, then sick, swooning, and, had not imme-
diate help been had. he would in a few moments have been dead; and
thus it. was, not with one or two, or ten or twenty, but with the
greatest part of them ; and if I remember right, our surgeon was ob-
liged to let blood of about thirty of them.

There were two priests among them,one an old- men,and the other
a young man ; and that which was strangest was, the oldest man was
the worst. As soon as he set his foot on board our ship, and saw
himself safe, he dropped down stone dead, to all appearance ; not the
least sign of life could be perceived in him: our surgeon immediately
applied proper remedies to recover him, and was the only man in the
Ihip that believed he was not dead. At length he opened a vein in
his am, having first charm! and rubbed the part, so as to warm it u
much as possible : upon this blood, which only dropped at first,
flowing frculy, in three minutes after the man opened his eyes; and a
quarter of mi hour after that he hpoko, grew better, and in a littlo
time quite well. After the blood was stopped, he walked about; told
us he was perfectly we"; took it dram of cordial which the surgeon
gave h m, and was what wo called come to himself. About a quarter
of an hour after this, they came running into the cabin to the surgeon:
who was hlvrding a l"n'.m:h\vmn:\n that. had fainted, and told him the
priest was gone stark mad. It, seems he had begun to revolve the
chango of his eirctunstanccs in llismind, and again this put him into
an ecstauy ot'juy; his spirits whirlvd about faster than the vessels
could convoy them: the lnlood grow hot and feverish, and the man was,
as lit for lit-dlzuu as any creature that over was in it: the euro
goon Would not hlcod him again in that condition, but gave him
something to doze and put him to slot-p, which, after some time,
operated upon him, and he awoke next morning perfectly composed
and well.

The younger priest behaved with great command of his passions
and was really an cxamplo of a serious, \\ ell-governed mind : at. his
first. coming on hoard the ship, he throw himst'lt' tint on his face,
prostrnting himself in thanltt'nlnoss for his delin'rancv, in which I un-
liappily and Ilnsoasonahly distnrhod him, really thinking he had been
in a. swoon, hut he spoke calmly, thanked mu,told me was giving God
thanks for his dolivorance; begged me to leave him a tow moments,
and that, next to his Maker, he would give me thanks also.

I was heartily sorry that I disturhod him,and not. only left him, but
kept others from interrupting him also. lle continued in that posture
nhout three minutosmr little more, after] left. him ; then came to me,
as he had said he would, and with a. great. dual of soriousncfis and
ntl'cction, but with tears in his eyes, thanked me, that had. undor God,
giron him. and so many misornhlo crcatun's, their lives. I told him I
had no room to move him to thank God for it, rather than me, for I
had seen that ho had done that already; hot, I added, thnt. it was
nothing hut what reason and humanity dictated to all men; and that
we had as much roason aa ho to give thanks to God. who had blessed
us so far. as to make us the instruments of his mercy to so many of
his creatures.

After this, the young priest nppliod himself to his country folks;
labored to compose thvm: yorsuaded, entroatrd, argued, reasoned with
them; and did his utmost to keep them within the exercise of their
reason; Ind with some he had success, though others were for a time
out of all government of themselves.

I cannot help committing this to writing, as perhaps it may he use-
ful to those inn) whose hands it may fall, for the guiding themselves
in all the extravagances of their passions 5 for if an excess of joy can
carry men out to such a length beyond the reach of their reason, what
will not the extravaganccs ot'ouger, rage, undo provoked mind, carry
us to ? And, Indeed, here I saw reason for keeping an exceeding
watch over our passions of every kind, as well those of joy and
satisfaction as those of sorrow and anger.

We were something disordered, by these extravagances among our
new guests, for the first day ; but when they had been retired, lodg-
ings provided for them, as well as our ship would allow, and they had
slept heartily--an must of them did, being fatigued and frightened--
they were quite another sort of people the next day.

Nothing of good manners, or civil acknowledgment-s for the kind-
ness shown them, was wanting; the French, it is known, are naturally
apt enought to exceed that way. The captain and one of the priests,
came to me the next day, and desired to speak with me and my
nephew: the connnauder began to consult with us what should be
done with them ; and first, they told us that we had saved their lives,
so all they had was little enough for it return to us for that kindness
received. The captain said they had saved some money, and some
things of value, in their boats, catched hastily out of the flames, and
if we would accept it, they were ordered to make an odor of it all to
us : they only desired to he set on shore somewhere in our way, where,
if possible, they might get a passage to France. My nephew was for
accepting their money at first word, and to consider what to do with
them afterward; but I overruled him in that part, for I knew what
it was to be set on shore in a strange country ; and if the Portuguese
captain that took me up at sea had served me so, and took all I had
for my deliverance, I must have starved, or have been as much a slave
at the Brazils us I had been at Barbary, the more being sold to a
Mohammedan excepted ; and perhaps a Portuguese is not a much het-
termaster than a Turk, if not, in some cases, much worse.

I therefore told the French captain that we had taken them up in
their distress, it was true, but thatit was our duty to do so, as we were
fellow-creatures; and we would desire to be so delivered, if we were
in the like, or any other extremity; that we had done nothing for
them but what we believed they would have done for us, if we had
been in their case, and they in ours 5 but that we took them up to
save them, not to plunder them; and it. would ho a most hnrlmrnua

' N. E. and S. l'}. along time, we missed ser eral opportunities
of bending them to France ; for we met several ships bound
to luurope, whereof two were French, from St. Christopher's; hut
they had been no long heating up against the wind, they durst take in
no passengers, for fear of wanting provisions for the voyage, as well
for themselves as for those they should take in; so we were obliged
to go on. It \1 as about a week after this that we made the Banks' of

were in an indifferent case for good artists to bring the ship home.
They had been already nine weeks at sea, and had met with another

could not lie tied. the wind, but were cndeuvoriog to stand away to!
tho (Innaries.

But that which was worst of all was, that they were almost starved
for want of provisions, heuides the futignes they had undergone; their
bread and llesh were quite gone; they had not one ounce left in the
ship, and had none for eleven days. The only relief they had was
timir water was not all rpent, and they had ahont. half a harrel of
flour left: they had sugar enough ; some sueeades or sweettneats,
they had at first, but they were devoured; and they had seven cash
of rum.

There were a. youth and his mother, and a timid-servant on board,
who were going passengers, and thinking the ship was ready to sail,
unhoppily came on board the evtning ht'lhre the hurricane hogan;
and having no provisions of their own left, they were in a more. de-
plorable condition than the rest; for the seamen heing reduced to such
an extreme neeessity themselves, had no compassion, we may he sure,
for the poor passengers; and they were, indeed, in a condition, that
their misery in very hard to describe.

I had perhaps not known this part, if my curiosity had not led me
(the. weather being fair, and the wind ahated) to go on heard the ship.
The second mate. who, upon this occasion. commanded the ship, had
been on hoard our ship, and he told me, indeed, they had three pas-
sengers in the great cal-in, that were in a deplorable. condition. "Nay ,"
says he. "I helium they are de:xd.fi-rl have heard nothing of them for
above two days: and I was afraid to inquire after them," said he,
" for I had nothing to relieve them with."

We innnmliatuly applied ourselves to give them what relief we could
rpare; and, indeed, I had so for overruled things with my nephew,
that I would have vietnnllrd them. though we had gone away to Vir-
ginia. or any other part of the coast of America to have supplied
ourselves ; hut there was no necessity for that.

But. now they were. in a new danger: for they were. afraid of eating
too much. even of that. little we gave them. The meteor commander
brought six men with him in his boat ; but these men wretches look-
ed like skeletons, and were so weak, that they could hardly sit to their
ears. The mete himself was very ill, and half starved; for he do-
clared he had reserved nothing from the men, and went share and.
share alike with them in every bit they etc.

I cautioned him to eat sparingly, but set meet before him immedi-
diately ; and he had not eaten three mouthfuls before he began to be
sick, and out of order; so he stopped awhile, and our surgeon mixed
him up something with some broth, which he said would be to him
both food and physio ; and after he had taken it he grew better. In
the meantime, I forgot not the men ; I ordered victuals to be given
them; and the poor creatures rather devoured than ate it ; they were
so exceedingly hungry, that they were in a kind ravenous, and had no
command of themselves; and two of them ate with so much greedi-
nose, that they were in danger of their lives the next morning.

The sight of these people's distress was very moving to me, and
brought to mind what I had a terrible prospect of at my first coming
on shore in my island, where I had never the least mouthful of food,
or any prospect of procuring any; besides the hourly apprehensions
I had of being made the food of other creatures. But all the while
the mate was thus relating to me the miserable condition of the ship's
company, I could not put out of my thought the story he had told me
of the three poor creatures in the great cabin, viz., the mother, her
son, and the maid--servant, whom he had heard nothing of for two or
three days, and whom he seemed to confess, they had wholly neglect-
ed, their own extremities being so great; by which I understood that
they had really given them no food at all, and that therefore they

must he perished, and be all lying dead, perhaps, on the floor or deck
of the cabin.

As I therefore kept the mate, whom we then called captain, on
board with his men, to refresh them, so I also forgot not the starving
crew that were left on board, but ordered my own boat to go on
board the ship, and with my mate and twelve men, to carry them a
sack of bread, and four or five pieces of beef to boil. Our surgeon
charged the men to cause the meat to be boiled while they stayed,
and to keep guard in the cook-room, to prevent the men taking it to
eat raw, or taking it out. of the pot before it was well boiled. and then
to give every man but u. very little at a time ; and by this caution he
preserved the men, who would otherwise have killed themselves with
that very food that was given them on purpose to sure their lives.

At the some time I ordered the mate to go into the great cabin,
and see what condition the poor passengers were in, and if they were
alive, to comfort them and giro them what refreshment was proper;
and the surgeon gave him u. largo pitcher, with some of the prepared
hroth which he had given the mute that was on board, und which he
did not question would restore them gradually.

l was not satisfied with this; but, as I said above, inning a. great
mind to ace the scene of misery which I Lnew the hilly ilncll' would
present. in.) with, in a more lively manner than 1 could have it by re-
port, I took thu captain of the ship, as we now called him, with me,
and went myself, a little after, in their boat.

1 found the poor men on hoard almost in a. tumult to get the \'ictuttls
out of the boiler before it was ready; but my mate observed his or-
(lers. ttnd kept a. good guard at the cook-room door; and the man he
placed there, after Hung all poa'sihle persuaaion to lnwc patience, kept
them otl' luy forte. However, he caused some biscuit cakes to he dip-
ped iu the pot7 uud wftened with the liquor of the meat, which they
called ln-ewiaY and gave them every one some to stay their btlnilafills,
und told them it was for their own safety that ho wan obliged to giro
them but it little at n time. 'But it "as ull in rain; nnd had 1 not
come on hoard, and their own commander und oiliL-ers with me, and
with good words, and some threats, else, of giving them no more.7 l
bt'llt'.\0 they \\'tv'.ld hzu'o lfl'ttlicll into the cook-room by force, and
torn the meat rut. of the furnace; for words are, indeodmt'rery small
force to n ln'm'ry belly. However we pzu-ilied them, and fed them
gradually .Ilnl cztulintlaly for the first, and the next time gave them
liiui't',lt1|\t at. lst't we. iilltul their lu'llii-s, and the men did well enough.

But. the misery of the poor passengers in the bin was of another
nature, and far beyond the rest; for, en the thip's company had so

 

little for thenm'lws, it "as but too true that they had at. first kept
them very low, and at last, totally neglm'trd tln-in ; so that for >ix or
seven days it might be said they had really no food at all, uml for
several days helm-e. very little. The poor mother, who, we the men
reported, was a woman of sense and good breeding, lnld spared all
rle ruultl so :itl'ei-tionntely {or her NIH. that nt. lent she entirely bllllk
llutlt'l' it: and when the mate of our ship went in, she ant upon the
floor or deck, with her back up against the sides, between two chairs,
whirl: were. llb'ltl'tl fast. and her head sunk lnetwccn her shoulders,
like a. corpse, though not quite dead. My mate said all he could to
retire and encourage her, and with a spoon put some broth into her
mouth. She opened her lips, and lifted up one hand, but could not
speak, yet she understood what he said, and made signs to him, inti.
mating that it was too late for her, but pointed to her child, as ii'she
would have said they should take care of him. However, the mate,
who was exceedingly moved with the sight, endeavored to get some
of the broth into her mouth, and, as he said, get two or three spoon-
fuls down, though I question whether he could he sure of it or not;
but it was too late, all she died the same night.

The ~vouth, who was preserved at the price of his most affectionate
mother's life, was not so far gone, yet he lay in a cabin-bed, as one
stretched out, with hardly any life left in him. He had a piece of an
old glove in his mouth, having eaten up all the rest of it; however,
being young, and having more strength than his mother, the mate got
something down his throat, and he began scnsihly to revive; though,
by giving him, some time after, but two or three spoonfuls extraordi-
nary, he was very sick, and brought it up again.

But the "next care was the poor maid ; she lay all along upon the
deck, hard by her mistrem, and just like one that had fallen down
with an apoplexy. and struggled for life. Her limbs were distorted;
one of her hands was clasped round the frame of a chair. and she
griped it so hard that we could not easily make her let it go; her
other arm lay over her head, and her feet lay both together. set fast
against the frame of the cabin table; in short, she lay just like one
in the agonies of death, and yet she was alive, too.

The poor creature was not only starred with hunger, and terrified
with the thoughts of death, but, as the men told us afterward, was
broken-hearted for her mistress, whom she saw dying for two or three
days before, and whom she loved most tenderly.

"'0 knew not what to do with this poor girl, for when our surgeon,
who was a man of very great knowledge and experience, had, with
great application, recovered her as to life, he had her upon his hands
as to her senses, for she was little less than distracted for a consider-
able time after, as shall appear presently.

"'hocver shall read these niemorandums, must be desired to con-
sider that visits at see. are not like a journey into the country, where
rometimm people stay a week or a fortnight at it place : our husiness
was to relieve this distressed ship's crew, but not lie by for them, and
though they were willing to steer the same course with us for some
days, yet we could carry no soil, to keep pace with the ship that had
no masts; however, as their captain begged of us to help him to set
up a maiutopmast, and a kind of topmost to his jury foremost, we did,
as it were, lie by him for three or four days, and then, baring given
him five barrels of beef, a barrel of pork. two hogsheada of biscuit,
and a proportion of peas, flour, and what other things we could spore,-
and taking three cocks of sugar, some rum, and some pieces of eight
from them, for satisfaction, we left them; taking on board with us,
at their own earnest request, the youth and the maid, und all their
goods.

The young lad was about seventeen years of age; a. pretty, well
bred, modest. and seuaihle youth, greatly dejected with the '088 of his
mother, and, as it seems, had lost his father but a few months before,
at Barhadoes; he begged of the surgeon to speak to me to take him
uut of the ship, for he said the cruel fellows had murdered his mother.
And, indeed, so they had; that is to say, putatively, for they might
have spared u smull sustenance to the poor helpless Widow, that
might- have preserved her life, though it had been hutjust enough to
keep her alive. But hunger knows no friend, no relation, no justice,
no right, and therefore is romorselos., and capable of no compassion.

The surgeon told him how far we were going, and that it would
carry him uwny from all his friends7 and put him, perhaps, in us bud
circumstances almost. as those we found him in--that is to say, starv-
ing in the world. He said it mattered not whither he went, if he was
delivered from the terrible crew thut he was umong; that the captain
(hy which he meant me. for he could know nothing of my nephew)
had saved his life, and he was sure, would not hurt him; and us for
the maid, he was sure, if she came to herself, she would he very thank-
ful for it, let us curry them where we would. The surgeon repre-
sented the case so ufi'oetionotely tome that 1 yielded, and we took
them hoth on heard, with ull their goods, except eleven hogaheuds of
sugar, which could not he removed or come at; end, as the youth had
it hill of lading for them. I made his commander sign a. writing. obli-
ging hiumclt' to go, as soon us he came to Bristol, to one Mr. Rogers,
n merchant- there, to whom the youth said he was related, and to de-
liver a letter which I wrote to him, and ull the goods he had belong-
ing to the deceased widow; which, I suppose, was not done, for I
could never learn that the nhip came to Brirtul, hut was, as it is most
prolmhle, lost at sea; being in so disabled n condition, and so for
from uny land. that l mu of opinion the first storm she met with after-
ward she might- founder in the sea; for she was leaky, and had (lam-
ugo in her hold, when we met with her.

I was now in the latitude of nineteen degrees thirty-two minutes,
and had hitherto a tolerable voyage as to weather, though, at first,
the winds had been contrary. I shall trouble nobody with the little
inridents of wind, weather. currents. &c., on the rest of our voyage;
but to shorten my story, for the sake of what is to follow, shall ob-
serve, that I came to my old habitation, the island, on the 10th of
April, 1695. It was with no small dillieulty that I found the place;
for as I came to it, and went from it, before, on the south and east
side of the island, as conning from the Bruzils, so now, coming in be-
tween the main and the island, and having no chart for the coast, nor
any landurarhl did not know it when I saw it, or know whether I
saw it or not.

We heat about a great while, and went on shore on several islands
in the mouth of the great river Oronooko, but none for my purpose ;
only this I learned by my coasting the shore, that I was under one
great mistake before, rim: that the continent which I thought I saw
from the island I lived in, was really not continent, but a long island,
or rather a ridge of islands, reaching from one to the other side of the
extended mouth of that great river; and that the savages who came
to my island were not properly those which we call Caribbees, but
islanders, and other barbarians of the same kind, who inhuLited some-
thing nearer to our side than the rest.

In short, I visited several of these islands to no purpose; some I

found were inhabited, and some were not: on one of them I found-

some Spaniards, and thought they had lived there: but speaking
with them, found they had a sloop lay in a small creek hard by, and
came thither to make salt and to catch some pearl muscles, if they
could; but that. they belonged to the Isle do Trinidad, which lay
farther north, in the latitude of ten and eleven degrees.

Thus coasting from one island to another, sometimes with the ship,
sometimes with the F rcuclnnen's shallop, which we had found a con-
venient boat, and therefore kept her with their very good will, at
length I came fair on the south side of my island, and presently
knew the very countenance of the place; so I brought the ship safe
to an anchor, broadside with the little creek where my old habitation
was.
61mph: Ming-Em".

110an and Friday so Ashore--The latter meets with his Father --Am-t
of what panel]. on the Island after kobinson'a quitting It.

S soon as I saw the place, I called for Friday, and asked
him if he knew where he was; he looked about a little, and
presently clapping his handn, eried: "0 yes, 0 there, 0
yrs, 0 there," pointing to our old habitation, and fell dancing
and rapt-ring like a mad fellow; and] had much ado to keep him
from jumping into the sea, to swim ashore to the place.

" Well, Friday," says I, " do you think we shall find anybody here
or no? and do you think we shall see your father l" The fellow
stood mute an a stock a good while, but when I named his father, the
poor atl'eclionate creature looked dejected, and I could see the tears
run down his face very plentifully. " What is the matter, Friday i"
says I ; " are you troubled because you may see your father?" " No,
no." says he, shaking his head, " no see him more; no, never more
see him again." " Why so," said I, " Friday? how do you know
that i" " 0 no, 0 no," says Friday; " he long: ago die, long ago; he
much old man." "Well, well," says I, "Friday. you don't know;
but shall we see any one else, then I" The follow, it seems, had
better eyes than I, and he points to the hill just above my old house;

 

and though we lay halt'a league off. he cries out, " We see, we see--
yea. yes, we. see much man there, and there, and there." I looked,
but I saw nobody, no, not with a perspective glass, which was. I sup-
pose, because 1 could not, hit the place; for the fellow was right, as
I found upon inquiry the next day ; and there were five or six men
there altogether, who stood to look at the ship, not knowing what to
think of ll'i.

As won as Friday told us he saw people,I caused the English
mtrt'cul to he spread, and tired three guns, to give them notice we
were l't iends: and in aleout halfo quarter ofan hour after, we perceived
a smoke arise Train the side of the creek; so I immediately ordered
the boat out. taking Friday with me: and hanging out a white flag,
or a flag of trace, 1 went. directly on shore, taking with me the young
friar I mentioned, to whom I told the story ofmy living there, and
the manner of it, and every particular both ofmyself and those I left
there; and who was, on that account, extremely desirous t.) go with
Inc. We had besides about sixteen men well armed, if we had found
any new guests there which we did not know of; but we had no need
of weapons.

As we went ashore upon the tide flood, near high water, we rowed
directly into the creek; and the first man I fixed my eye upon was
the Spaniard whose life I had saved, and whom I knew l-y his face
perfectly well; as to his habit, I shall describe it afterward. I
ordered nobody to go on shore at first but myself: but there was no
keeping Friday in the hunt, for the affectionate creature had spied his
father at a distance, a good way of the Spaniards,where indeed I saw
nothing of him; and if they had not iet him go ashore, he would hare
jumped into the see. He was no sooner on shore. but he flew away
to his father, like an arrow out of a bow. It would have made any
man shed tears, in spite of the firmest resoluiion, to have seen the
first transports of this poor fellow's joy when he came to his father;
how he embraced him, kissed him, stroked his face, took him up in
his arms, set him down upon a tree, and lay down by him ; and then
stood and looked at him, as any one wouhl look at a strange picture,
for a quarter of an hour together; then lay down on the ground, and
stroked his legs, and kissed them, and then got up again, and stared
at him; one would have thought the fellow bewitehcd. But it would
have made it dog laugh the next day to see how his passion ran out
another way; in the morning he walked along the shore, to and again.
with his father several hours, always leading him by the hand, as if
he had been a lady; and every now and then he would come to the
boat to fetch something or other for him, either a lump of sugar, a
dram, n biscuit-coke, or something or other that was good. In the
afternoon his frolics ran another way ; for then he would set the old
man down upon the ground and dance about him, and make a thousand
antic postures and gestures; and all the while he did this, he would
be talking to him, and telling him one story or other of his travels,
and what had happened to him ahrond, to divert him. In short, it
the same filial affection was to be found in Christians to their parents
in our part of the world, one would be tempted to say, there would
hardly have been any need of the fifth commandment.

hit this is a digression; I return to my landing. It would be
needless to take notice of all the ceremonies and eivilitics that the
Spaniards received me with. The first Spaniard, who, as I said,l knew
very well, was he whose life I had saved: he came toward the boat,
attended by one more, carrying a flag of truce also ; and he not only
did not know me at first, but he had no thoughts, no notion of it:
being me that was come, till I spoke to him. "Senhor," said Lil
Portuguese, " do you not know me '1" At which he spoke not a word,
but giving his musket to the man that was with him, threw his arm!
abroad, saying something in Spanish that I did not perfectly hear,
came forward and cmlu'uced me; telling me he was inexcusable not
to know that. face again, that ho had once seen as of an angel from
heaven sent to save his life; he said abundance of very handsome
things. as a woll-hrod Spaniard always knows how; and then beckon-
ing to the person that attended him, hade him go and call cut his
cmnrudes. Ilo then asked me ifl would walk to my old habitation.
where he would give me possession of my own house again, and where
l should see they had made but mean improvements; sol walked
along with him; hut, alas! I could no more find the place again than
il'l had never been there; for they had planted so many trees, and
placed them in such a posture, so thick and close to one another, and
in ten yours" time they were grown so big, that, in short, the place
was inaccessible, except hy such windings and blind ways as they
themselves only, who made them, could find.

I asked them what Ill". them upon all these fortifications: he told
me l would say there was great need of it, when they had given me
an account how they passed their time since their arriving in the
island, especially after they had the misfortune to findl was gone.
He told me he could not but have some satisfaction in my good fortune,
when he heard that I was gone in a good ship, and to my satisfaction;
and that he had oftentimes a strong persuasion that. one time or other,
he should see me again : but nothing that ever llt'fcll him in his life,
he said, was so surprising and afflicting to him at first, as the disap-
pointment he was under when he came back to the island and found
I Was not there.

As to the three barbarians (so he called them) that were left he-
hiud. and of whom. he said, he had a long story to tell me, the Span.
iards all thought thmnselves much better among the savages, only
that their number was so small: "and," says he, "had they been
strong enough, we had been long ago in purgatory ;" and with that
he crossed himself on the breast. " But, sir," says he, " I hope you
w ill not he displeased when I shall tell you how, forced by necessity,
We were obliged, for our own preservation, to disarm them, and make
them our suhjects, who would not be content with living moderately
our masters, but would he our murderers." I answered I was heartily
afraid of it when I left them there, and nothing troubled me at my
parting from the island but that they were not come back, that I might
have put them in possession of everything first, and left the others in
a state of subjection, as they deserved ; but if they had reduced them
to it, l mu very glad, and should be very for from finding any fault
with it: for I knew they were a parcel of refractory, ungoverned vil-
lains, and were fit for any manner of misehief.

While I was thus saying this, the man came whom he had sent
back, and with him eleven men more. . In the dress they were in, it
was impossible to guess what, notion they were of; but he made all clear
both to them and me. First he turned to me, mad pointing to them,
said, " These, sir, are some of the gentlemen who owe their lives to
you ;" and then turning to them, and pointing to me, he let them know
who I was; upon which they all cmno up, one by one, not us if they
had been sailors and ordinary fellows, and the like, but really as if
they had been ambassadors or noblcmen, and I u monarch or great
Conqueror: their behavior was to the. lust degree obliging and courte-
ous, and yet mixed with n. manly, majestic gravity, which very well
become thorn ; and, in short, they had so much more manners than I,
that I scarce knew how to receive their civilities, much less how to
return them in kind.

The hixlory of their coming to, and conduct in. the island, after my
going uxvny, is so very remnrknble, and has so many incidents, which
the former part of my relation will help to understand, and which
will, in most of the pnrticulurs, refer to the account I have already
given, that I cnnnot hut commit them, with great delight, to the read-
ing of those that come after me.

I shall no longer trouble the story with n relation in the first per.
son, which will put. me to the expense. of ten thousand said 1's, and
Suit] he's, and he told 2712's, and 1 (01d him's, and the like; but I shall
collect the facts historically, as nexu- ns I can gather them out of my
memory, from what they related to me, and from what I met with in
conversing with them and with the place.

In order to do this succinctly, and as intelligihly as I can, I must
go back to the circumstances in which I left the island and in which
the persons were of whom I am to speak. And first. it is necessary
to repent, that I had sent away Friday's father and the Spaniard (the
two wlmse lives I had rescued from the ravages) in n large canoe, to
the main, as I then thought it, to fetch over the Spaniards com-
panions thot he left behind him, in order to save them from the like
calamity that he had been in, and in order to snccor them for the
present; and that. if possible, we might together find some way for
our deliverance afterward.
When I sent them away, I had no visible appearance of, or the least.
room to hope for, my own delireraneo, any more than I had twenty
years heft-re. ; much less had 1 any foreknowledge of what afterward
happened, I mean, of an English ship coming on shore there to fetrh
me oil". and it could not hut. he a. rery great. xurprise to them, when
they eame. hat-k, not only to lind that l was gone, luut to find three
stra gers left. on the spot, possessed of all that 1 had left behind me,
which would otherwise. hare. heeu their own.

The first thing, howcrer, that I inquired into, that. l might begin
where l leli. oil', was of their own part: and I desired he would giro
tne a lmrtirular account of his royage hark to his countrymen with
the boat, when l sent him to fetch them orer. He told me. there was
little rarier in that part, for nothing remarkahlo happened to them
on the way, having had \'ery ealm weather and a smooth sea. As
for his countrymen, " it could not he doubted." he. saith *" hat. that they
were or't'l'jo_\jt~d to see. l'

 

a." (it srems he wasthe. prineipal man among
them, the captain of the \esn'l they had been rhipwrerked in haring
been dead N'lllt' time); " they were,'

 

he said, " the more surprised to
bee. him, l-eeause. they knew that, he was fallen into the hands of the
sarages, who, they were satisfied, would dewur him, as they did all
the rr>t of their prisoners; that. wl en he told them the. Mory ot' his
delireraneu, and in \\ hat manner he was furnished for earl-ring them
away. it was like. a dream to them, and their astoni>lunent," he said,
" was somewhat. like. that. of Joseph's brethren, when he told them
who he was, and told them the story of his exaltation in l'haraoh's
court: hut when he bin-wed them the arms, the 1am der, the hall, and
prorisinns, that. he ltl'tlllglli them for their journey or royage, they
wt re. restored to themseltes, took a just share of the. joy of their de-
lireranee, and innm-diately prepared to eome. a\ra_\r with him."

Their first. business was to get. eanues: and in this they were ohli-
ged not. to stir-k so much upon the honest part of it, hut to trespass
upon their friendly sarages, and to borrow two large. canoes, or peri-
nguas, on pretenee ot'going out ta-fishingmr for pleasure. In these. they
eame away the next morning. It seems they wanted no time. to get
themselres ready : for they had no haggape, neither eluthes nor DIT-
Visions, nor anything: in the world but what they had on them, and n
few roots to eat, of whieh they used to Iualte their hrend.

They were all three. weeks ahsentq and in that. time. unluekily for
them. I had the oeensiun offered for my escape. as I mentioned in my
other part. and to get oil' from the. iiilnnd. lenring three of the most:
impudcut, hardened, nngovorned, dimgreeuble villains behind me, that
any man could desire to meet with; to the poor Spaniards great
grief and disappointment you may he sure.

The only just. thing the rogues did was, that. when the Spaniards
came ashore, they gave my letter to them, and gave them provisions
and other relief, as i had ordered them to do; also they gave them
the long laper of directions which i had left. with them, wnluining
the particular methods which I took for managing every part of my
life there ; the way how I halted my bread, bred up my tame goats,
and planted my corn; how I cured my grapes, made my pots, and, in
n. word, everything 1 did; all this being written down, they gave to
the Spaniards (two of them understood English well enough); nor
did they refuse to aecmnmodate the Spaniards with anything else, for
theyngreed very well fin- snme lime. They gave them an equal ad-
mixuion into the house, or care, and they began to live very roeiahly;
and the llt'tttl Spaniard, who had seen pretty much of my methods,
and Friday's father together, managed all their affairs: hut as for
the Englislnm-n, they did nothing but ramhle about. the island, shoot
parrots. and cateh tortoises; and when they came home at night, the
.'paniards provided their tsuppers for them.

The Spaniards would have been aatixliod with this, had the others
hut let them alone; which however, they could not find in their hearts
to do long, but like the dog in the manger, they would not. cut them-
selves, neither would they let. the others eat. The dim-renew, never-
theless, were at first but trivial, but. such as are not. worth relating,
but at. last it broke out. into an open war; and it hogan with all the
rudeness and insoleuce that. can be imagined, without reason, without
provocation, contrary to nature, and, indeed to common sense; and
though it is true, the first relation of it came from the Spaniards
tin-insolves, whom I may call the ueeuscrs, yet whenl came to exam-
ine the fiellows, they could not. deny a word of it.

But before i come to the particulars of this part, I must supply a
defect in my former relation: and this was, i forgot to set down,
among the rest, that just us we were weighing the lumber to bet sail,
'thore happened a little quarrel on heard of our ship, which I was
once afraid would have turned to a second mutiny ; nor was it up--
pensed till the captain, rousing up his courage. and taking us" all to
his assistance. parted them hy force, and making two of the must re-
fractory fellows prisoners, he laid them in irons; and as they had
been active in the former disorders, and let fall some ugly, dangerous
words, the second time he threatened to carry them in irons to Eng-
land and have them hanged there for mutiny, and running away with
the ship. This, it seems, though the captain did not intend to do it,
frightened twine other men in the ship; and some of them had put it
into the heads of the rest that the captain only gave them good words
for the, present till they should come to some English 1'0". and that
then they should be all put into jail, and tried for their lives. The
mate got intelligence of this. and acquainted us with it; upon which
it was desired that 1, who still passed for it great man among them,
should go down with the mate. and satisfy the men, and tell them that:
they might be assured, if they behaved well the. rest. of the voyage,
all they had done. for the. time. past. should he pardoned. So i went,
and after p: using my honor's word to them. they appeared easy, and
the more so when I caused the two men that. \\ ere in irons to he re.

 

leased and tin-given.

But this mutiny had hrought us to an nnelsor for that night; the
wind also falling calm next nmrning. we. found that our two men who
had been laid in irons, had stole each of them a musket, and some
other weapolnl (what. powder and shot. they had we knew not).. .-.d
had taken the ship's pinnaee, whit-h was not. yet. hauled up. and run
away with her to their companions in toguery on shore. As soon as
we found this, I ordered the. longdiout on shore, with twelve men and
the mate, and away they went to seelt the. rogues: but they could nei-
ther lind them or any ol'the rest, for they all tled into the woods when
they saw the. lmat eoming on shore. The mate was (Illt'l' resolved. in

"'hen the Spaniards ealue first on shore, the lunsiness hogan to go

brutes to have taken in their two countrymen again, that. as they said,
they might he all one family: but they would not hear of i' ' so the
two poor fellows lived lay themselves ; and finding nothing hz- .t:antry
and applieation would make themlire enmfm'tahly. they pitched their
tents on the north shore ol'the island. hut a little more to the wesmo he
out of danger of the savages, who always landed on the east parts of
the island.
Here they built them two huts, one to lodge in, and the other to lay
up their magazines and stores in; and the Spaniards having given
them some corn, for seed, and especially some of the peas which 1 had
left them, they dug, planted, and enclosed-after the pattern I had set
for them all, and began to live pretty well. Their first crop of corn
was on the ground; and though it was but 0. little bit of land which
they had dug up at first, havinghad but u. littletime, yet it was enough to
relieve them, and find them with bread and other eatubles; and one
of the fellows, being the cook's mate of the ship, was very ready at
making soup, puddings, and such other preparations as tho rice and
the milk, and such little flesh as they got, furnished him to do.

tiers.

HEY were going on in this little thriving posture, when the
three unnatural rogues, their own countrymen too, in more
humor, and to insult them, came and bullied them, and told
them the island was theirs ; that the governor, moaning me,
had given them the possession of it, and nobody else had any right
to it; and that they should build no houses upon their ground, unless
they would pay rent for them.

The two men, thinking they were jcsting at first, asked them to
come in and sit down, and see what fine houses they were that they
had built, and to tell them what rent they demanded; and one of
them merrily said, "If they were the ground-landlords, he hoped, if
they built tenements upon their land, and made improvements, they
would, according to the custom of landlords, grant along lease :7' and
desired they would get a. Scrivener to draw the writings. One of the
three cursing and raging, told them they should see they Were not in
jest : and going to a. little place at at distance, where the honest men
h'nd made a fire to dress their victuals, he takes a firebrnnd, and claps
it to the outside of their hut, and very fairly set it on fire; and it
would have been burned all down in a few minutes, if one of the two
had not run to the fellow, thrust him away, and trod the fire out with
his feet, and that not without some difficulty too.
The fellow was in such a rage at. the honest man's thrusting him
away, that he returned upon him with n. pole he had in his hand, and
had not the. man avoided the. blow very nimhly, and run into the hut,
he, had ended his days at once. His eomrade, seeing the danger they
were hoth in, ran in after him, and immediately they came both out
with their musketa, and the man that. was first struck at with the pole
knocked the fellow down that had begun the quarrel with the stock of
his musket, and that before the other two could come to help him; and
then xeeing the rest come at. them. they stood together, and presenting
the other ends oftheir pieces to them, hade them stand off.

The others had firearms with them, too ; hut one of the two honest
men, holder than his comrade, and made desperate hy his danger, told
thezu. it~ they oiTered to move hand or foot, they were dead men, and
holdhv romxuanded them to lay down their nrxua. They did not, in-
deed. hr}- down their a.rtns,hut seeing him so resolute it l:rnugl|L them
to a parley. and they eonsented to hke their wounded man with them
and l-egone: and, indeed, it seems the fellow was wounded sufficiently
with the, hlow. llmvever, they were mueh in the wrong, since they
had the. :nlvautage, that they did not. disarm them offer-malty, as they
might have done. and have gone immediately to the Spaniards and
given them an aeemmt. how the. rogues had treated them, for the three
villains studied nothing hut revenge, and every day gave them some
intimation that. they did so.

int not. to erowd this part. with an account of the lesser part of the
roguerit's, sueh as treading down their eorn,shooting: three young
kids and a she-goat, which the, poor men had got. to hreed up tame
for their store. and, in a. word, plaguing them might- and day in this
manner: it threed the. two men to Nlt'll a desperation, that they re-
solved to light them all three. the first time they had a fair opportu-
nity. in order to this they resolved to go to the, castle, as the_vealled
it (that was my old dwelling). where the. three rogues and the Spa".
iards all lived together at that time, intending to have a fair hattle,
and the Spaniards should stand hy to see. fair play: so they got up
in the morning. hefore day. and came to the place, and called the
Englishmen hy their names, telling a Spaniard that answered that
lthey wanted to speak with them.

It happened that the day hefiu-e two of the Spaniards, having heen
in the woods. had seen one. of the two Englishmen. whom for distinc.
tion i called the honest men. and he. had made a. sad complaint to
the Spaniards of the harharuus usage they had met- with from their
three eountrymen, and how they had ruined their plantation, and dtvt

Itrnyed their corn that they had lalmrcd so hard to bring forward,
and killed the )nilch goat. and their three kids, \iliich was all they had
provided for their suatenanee. and that if he and his friends, meaning
the Spaniards, did not. as>i>t them again, they should he starred.

" Why," Nl_\'S the Spaniard, very calmly, "Senlmr Inglc'le, they must.
not starve." The Englhhinan replh-d, like u rough-hcwn tarpauling,
" they might starve and he d----d: they should not plant. nor lulild

Spaniard. Another of the hrntes returned, " Ito? d--n them, they
should he servants, and work for them." " But how can you expect:
that. of them ?" pays the Spaniard : " they are not. bought. with your
money: you have no right. to make them servants." The English-
man answered. "The island was theirs i the governor had given it to
them, and no man had anything: to do there but tlwinM-lrts :" and with
that. swore hy his Maker that they would go and hurn all their new

the S! nizml. "'hy the same rule, we must he your serya:1t>.tno."
" Ay. ' says the hold dog, "and so you shall, ton, hulin-e we have done
with you" (mixing two or three (t--d dun nie's in the proper inter-
1'als of his speech); the Spaniard only smiled at. that, and made him
no answer. However, this little discourse had heated them, and,
starting up, one says to the other--l think it was he they called Will
Atkins--" Come. Jag-1:. let's go and have t'other hrnsh with "em; we'll
demolish their castle, I'll warrant you ; they shall plant. no Colony in
our dominions."

Upon this they all went tronping away, with every man a gun, r.
pistol, and a sword. and muttered some insolent things among them-
selves of what they would do to the Spaniards, too. when (tlll'ltlt'lll.
nity ofi'ered; but the Fpaniardx, it seems, did not so perfectly under-
utand them as to know all the particulars. only that, in general, they
threatened them hard for whim:r the two Englishman's part.

13
Whither they went, or how they bestowed their time that evening,
the Spaniards said they did not. know; but it seems they wandered
about the country part of the. night, and then lying down in the ylaco
which I need to call my bower, they were weary and orerslept them-
selves. The case was this: they had resolved to stay till midnight
and M) take the poor men when they were ueleep, and, us they ne-
knowledged afterward, intended to Nut fire to their hats while they
were in them, and either lmrn them there. or murder theta as they
exnne out. An nndiee seldom sleeps very sound, it was very strange
they should not- have heeu kept awake.

However. as the two men had also a design upon them, as I have
said, though a much fairer one tlmn that: of burning and murdering,
it hammnod, and \'t'l'_\' luckily for them all, that they were up and
gone nhrond before the ldomly-mimled rogues came to their hats.

When they 'anm there and found the men gone, Atkins, who, it:
t9eeuw,was the thrwardest man. called out to his comradeT " Ila! Jack,

the two men were, at thisjuncttn-e. gone to find them out, and had
rest 'm-d to fight them wherever they had been. though they were l at
tm' to three 1 so that, had they met, there certainly would have l=-:-'n
blendshml among them; for they were all very etout, resolute fel-
laws, to giro them their due.

But l'rm-idem'e took more care to keep them Mander than they
thomse'nes could do to meet. for as it' they had dogged one another,
when the three wezo gone thither, the two were here ; and, afterward,
when the two went back to find them, the three were come to the old
habitation again. We shall see their (litibretlt conduct presently.
\Vhen the three came hack like furious creatures, flushed with the
rage which the work they had hcen about, had put them into, they
came up to the Spaniards and told them what they had done, by way
of sent? and bravado ; and one of them, stepping up to one of the
Spaniards, no it' they had been a couple of boys at play, takes hold of
his hot as it was upon his head, and giving it n. twirl ahoot, flooring
in his face, says to him, "' And you, Senhor Jack Spaniard, shall have
the same name, if you do not mend your manners." The Spaniard,
who, though a quiet, ciril man, was as hrave a man as could he, and
withal a strong, well-made man, looked at him for a good while, and
then, having no weapon in his hand, Hopped gravely up to him, and
with one Llow of his fist. knocked him down, as: an ox is felled with a
pole-axe _: at which one of the rogues, as insolent as the first, tired his
pistol at the Saaninrd immediately. Ila missed his body, indeed, for
the bullets went. through his hair, but one of them touched the tip of
his car, and he hled pretty much. The Mood made the Spaniard he-
liere he was more hart. than he really was, and that put. him into
some heat. for before he acted all in a perfect calm; but now resolv-
ing to g>> through wirh his work, he stooped, and took the fellow'e
musket: whom he had knocked down, and was just. going to shoot the
man who had fired at him, when the rest of the Spaniards, being in
the care, came out, and calling to him not to shoot, they htcppcd in,
secured the ollu'r two, and took their arms from them.

When they were thus disarmed, and found they had made all the
Spaniards their onrmies, as well as their own countrymen, they began
to cool, and, giving the Spaniards hotter words, would have their
arms again: hot the Spaniards, considering the feud that. was between
them and the other two Englishmen, and that it would he the best
method :hry could take to keep them from kiiling one another, told
them they would do them no harm, and if they would live peaceably,
they would he very willing to assist and associate with them as they
did before: hat that they could not think of giving them their arnm
again, while they appeared so resolved to do mischief with them to
their own countrymen, and had even threatened them all to make
them their servants.

The rogues were now no more eapahlc to hear reason than to act
with reason; hnt being refused their arms, they went raring away
and raging like madmen. threatening what they would do. though
they had no firearms. But: the Spaniards, despising their threaten-
lag, told them they should take euro how they ofl'ored any injury to
their plantation or cattle, for if they did, they would shoot them as
they noald raveuotm beasts, wherever they found them; and it'they
fell into their hands alive, they hilt'llltl certainly ho hanged. How-
then this was fa'. from cooling them, hut away they went, raping and
ewearing like t'urics of hell. An soon as they were gone. the two men
came hack. in passion and rage enough also, though of another kind;
for having been at their plantation, and finding it all demolished and
destroyed, an above, it will easily be supposed that they had pmvoea-
lion enough. They could Bearers have. room to tell their tale, the
Spaniards were. so eager t) tell theirs; and it was strange enough to
find that three men should thus hully nineteen, and receive no pun-
ishment at all.

The, Spaniards, indeed, despised them. and especially having thus
disarmed them,nn\de. light of their threatenings; but the two English-
men resolved to have their remedy against them, uh: t, pains suevcr it
cost to find them out. lint. the Spaniards interposed here. too, and
told them. that as they had disarmed them, they could not consent
that they (the. Inn) should pnnue them nilh firearms and perhaps
kill them. " But," said the grave. Spaniard, who was their governor,
" we. will endeavor to make. them do you justice, ifyou will leave it to
us: for there. is no douht hat. that they will eonm to us again. when
their passion is over, heing not able to subsist without our as~istanee :
we promise. you to make no peace. with them, without. having a full
satisf-Irlion for you : and upon this (audition we hope you will
promise to use no violence with them, other than in your own do-
fem-e. 'Ihe two Englishmen yielded to this very awkwardly, and
with great. reluetancc; hut the. Spaniards protested that they did it
only to keep them from bloodshed. and to make all easy at last. " For,"
said they. "we. are not so many of us; here is room enough for us
all, and it is a great pity we should not be all good friends. At;
length they did eonseut. and Waited for the issue of the thing, living
for some days with the Spaniards; for their own habitation was de-
Slrnyflti.

In about five days' time the three vagrants, tired with wandering,
and almost starved \vith hunger. havng ehiefly lived on turtles' eggs
all that while. came haek to the. grove: and finding my Spaniard,
who, as l have. said. was the governor, and two more "hit him \valk-
ing hy the side of the creek, they came. up in a very suhmissi e,
hmnhle manner. and Legged to he. received again into the family.
The Spaniards used them civilly, hut told them they acted so un.memos CMJSOE. 293

naturally by their own countrymen, and so very grossly by them (the
Spaniards), that they could not come to any conclusion without con-
sulting the two Englishmen and the rest; but, however, they would
go to them, and discourse about it, and they should know in half an
hour. It may be guessed that they were very hard put toit; for, it
seems, as they were to wait this half hour for an answer, they begged
they would send them out. some bread in the meantime, which they
did; asending, at the same time, a large piece of goat's flesh, and a
hoiled parrot, which they ate very heartily, for they were hungry
enough.

After half an hour's consultation, they were called in, and a long
dehutc ensued; their two countrymen charging them with the ruin of
all their labor, and a design to murder them; all \Vhlt'h they owned
before, and therefore could not deny now. Upon tho whole, the
Spaniards noted the moderator hetween them; and as they had ob-
liged the two Englishmen not to hurt the three while they were naked
and unarmed, so now they obliged the three to go and rebuild their
fellown' two huts, one to he of the same, and the other of larger di-
mensions, than they were before ; to flame their ground again where
they had pulled up their fonecu,plant trees in the room of those
pulled up, dig up the land again for planting com where they had
spoiled it, and, in a. word, to restore everything to the same state as
the r found it, as near as they could; for entirely it could not he, the
season for the corn, and the growth of the trees and hedges, not being
possible to he recovered.

Well, they snhmitted to all this; and as they had plenty of pro-
visions given them all the while, they grew very orderly, and the
whole society began to live pleasantly and agreeably together again ;
Only, that these three fellows could never be persuaded to worl:,I
mean for themselves, except now and then It little, just as they
pleased; however, the Spaniards told them plainly, that if they
would but live socinhly and friendly together, and study the good of
the whole plantation, they would be content to work for them, and
let them walk about and he as idle as they pleased; and thus having
lived pretty well together for about a month or two, the Spaniards
gave them arms again, and gave them liberty to go abroad with them
as before. '

it was not ahove aweek after they had these arms, and went abroad,
but. tho'ungrateful creatures hogan to he as insolent and troublesome
as before: hut, however, on accident happened presently upon this,
which endangered the safety of them all; and they were obliged to294 Abvu'rcat-zs or

lay by all private reacntmcnts, and look to the preservation of their
lives.

It. happened one night, that. the Spanish governor, as I call him,
that is to say, the Spaniard whose life I had saved, who was now the
captain, or leader, or governor of the rest, found himself very uneasy
in the night, and could by no means get. any sleep; he was perfectly
well in body, as he told me the story, only found his thoughts tumult-
uous; his mind ran upon nien fighting and killing ofone another,
but he was hroad awake, and could not by an)r means get any sleep;
in short, he lay a great while; but growing more and more uneasy,
he resolved to rise. As they lay, heing so many of thexn,i:pon goats'
skins laid thick upon such couches; and pads as they ha 1 made for them-
selves, and notin hammocks and ship lmds, as I did, who was but one,
so they had little to do, when they were willing to rise, but to get. up
Upon their feet, and perhaps put. on a coat, such as it. was, and their
pumps, and they were ready for going; any way that. their thoughts
guided them. ieing thus not on, he looked out; but, being dark, he
could F('('. little or nothing: and, besides, the trees which I had
planted, as in my former amount. is described, and which were now
grown tall. intercoptml his sight, so that he could only look up,
and see that it was a clear starlight. night. and hearing no noise,
he returned and laid him down again ; but. it. was all one: he
could not sleep, nor could he t'omposo himself to anything like
rest; hut. his thoughts were to the last: degree uneasy, and he knew
not. "hat.

and coming in, another of them wake-l, and calli: _ auod who it. was
that was up. The governor told him how it. had been with him.
" Say you so I" says the other Spaniard; "such things are not to be
slighted, I assure you; there is certainly some mischief working near
us;" and presently he asked him, "Where are the Englishmen i"
" They are all in their huts' says he, "safe enough." It seems tho
Spaniards had kept poasession of the main apartment, and had made
a place for the three Englishmen, who, since their last mutiny, were
always quartered Ly thcnmelves, and could not come at the rest.
"Well." says the Spaniard, "there is something in it, I am per-
suaded. from my own experience. I am satisfied our spirits cm-
lmdied have n converse with, and receive intelligence from, the spirits
unemhodied and inhabiting the inrisihlo world; and this friendly
notice is given for our advantage, if we knew how to make use of it.
Come," says he, "let. us go and look abroad; and if we find nothing

Having made some noise with rising and walking about, fining out
at all in it to justify the trouble, I'll tell you a story to the purpose.
that shall convince you of the justice of my proposing it."

In a word, they went out, to go on the top of the hill where I used
to go; but they being strong, and a good company. not alone, as
I mm, used none of my cautions, to go up by the ladder, and pulling
it up after them, to go up a second stage to the top, but were going
round through the grove. unconcerned and unwary, when they were
surprised with seeing a light as of fire, a. wry little way 011' from
them, and hearing the voices of men, not one or two, but of a great
number.

In all the discoveries I had made of the savages landing on the
island, it was my constant care to prevent them making the least dis-
cm cry of [here being any inhabitant upon the place; and when by
any occasion they come to know it, they felt. it so cll'eclually, that they
that got away were scarce able to give any account of it ; for we dis-
appeared as soon as possible ; nor did ever any that had seen me,
escape to tell any one else, except it was the three savages in our last
encounter, \vhojmnped into the boat; of whom I mentioned. I was
afraid they should go home and bring more help. Whether it was
the consequence of lhe escape of those men that so great a number
came now together, or whether they came ignorant-1y, and hy acci-
dent, on their usual bloody errand, the Spaniards could not, it- seems:
understand: but \vhatcter it was, it had been their business either to
have concealed themselves, or not to have seen them at all, much less
to have let the savages have seen that there were any inhabitants in
the place; or to have fallen upon them so cfl'cctually, as that not a.
man ofthem should have escaped, which could only have been by
getting in between them and their boats; hot this presence of mind
was wanting to them, which was the ruin of their tranquillity for a
great while.

We need not doubt but that the governor and the man with him,
Surprised with this sight, ran back immediately, and raised their fol-
lows, giving them an account of the imminent danger they were all in,
and they again as readily took the alarm; but it was impossible to
persuade them to stay close within, where they were, but they must
all run out to see how things stood.

While it was dark, indeed. they were well enough, and they had
opportunity enough for some hours, to view them by the light of three
fires they had made at a distance from one another; what they were
doing they knew not, and what to do themselves they knew not. For,
first, the enemy were too many 3 and, secondly, they did not keep296 anvnxrt'nt-zs or

together, hut. were divided into several parties, and were on shore in
several plat-es.

'l'he Spaniards were in no small consternation at this sight; and
when they found that the fellows ran straggling all over the shore,
they made no donht hut first or last, some of them would chop in upon
their hahitation, or upon some. other place where they would see the
token of inhabitants ; and they were in great. perplexity also for fear
ot' t-lteir tloek of goats, which would have been little less than starv-
ing thenr. if they should have been destroyed I so the first thing they
resolved upon was to despatrh three men away hefore it. was light,
two Spaniards and one Englishman, to drive all the goats away to
the great valley where the care was, and, it' need were, to drive
them into the eavo itself. Could the)' have seen the savages all
together in one hotly, and at a distance from their canoes, they re-
solved, ifthere hall lueen a hundred el' them, to have attacked them;
hut that mold not lie ohtained : for they were some. oftheut two miles
oil' from the other: and, as it. appeared afterward, were of two (lif-
ferent- nations.

After having: mused a great- while on the course they should take,
and heating their hrains in eonsideriug their present eireutnstauues,
they resolved, at last, while it wm still dark: to send the old savage,

1r

     

lay'a father, out aw a Sp)". to learn, if possihle, something concern-
ing them: as! what. they came for, what they intended to do, attd the
like. The old man readily undertook it; and stripping hitnsell' quite
ages were, away he went. After he had
been gone. an hour or two, he hringa word that he, had lll'l'll among

 

naked, as most of the sat

them undiscovered: that. he found they were. two parties. and of two
several nations, who had war with one another. and had a great hat.-
tle in their own country; and that. hoth sides having had several
prisoners taken in the fight, the)r were, ivy mere ehanee, landed all on
the same lslttml, for the devouring their prisoners and making merry,
but their coming so by chance to the same plaee had spoiled all their
mirth; that they were in a great rage at one another, and were. so
near. that he helieved they would light. again as soon as daylight
hegan to appear: hut he did not perceive that they had any notion of
anyhndy lneing on the island but themselves. He had hardly made
an end oftelling his story, when they could perceive, hy the unusual
noise they made, that. the two little armies were engaged in a bloody
fight.

Friday's father used all the arguments he could to persuade our
people to lie close, and not to be seen: he told them their safety con.
aisted in it, and that they had nothing to do but he still, and the
savages would kill one another to their hnnds, nnd then the rest
would go away; and it was so to a tittle. But it was impossible to
prevail, especially upon the Englishmen; their curiosity "as so im-
pnrtuno upon their prudentials, that they must run out and see the
lnuetio: however, they used some caution, too, \'iz., they did not go
rpuuly, just by their own dwelling, but went further into the woods,
mu! placed themselves to advantage, where they might securely see
them manage the fight, and, us they thought, not be seen by them;
hut it seems the savages did see them, as we shall find hereafter.

The battle was very fierce; and, if I might believe the Englishmen,
one of them said he could perceive that some of them were men of
great hrnvery, of invincible spirits, nnd of great policy in guiding the
fight. The battle, they said, held two hours before they could guess
which party would he beaten; hut then, that party which was nearest
our people's habitation begun to appear weakest, nod, after some
time more, some of them begun to fly ; and this put our men again
into a great consternation, lest any one of those that fled should run
into the grove before their dweliing for shelter, nnd thereby involun-
tarily discover the place; nnd that, by consequence, the pursuers
would do the like in search of them. Upon this they resolved that
they would stand nrmed within the wall, and whoever came into the
grm 0, they resolved to sully out over the wall and hill them ; no that,
if possible, not one should return to give an account ofit they ordered
ulm that it should be done with their swords, or by knocking them
down with the stocks of their muskets, but not by shooting them, for
{our ot'raising an nlurm by the noise.

As they expected, it fell out; three of the rented army fled for life,
and crossing the creek, ran directly into the place, not in the lent-t
knowing whither they went, but running as into a thick wood for
shelter. The scout they kept to look abroad gave. notice of this
within, with this nddition, to our men's great sutisfiielion, "2., that
the conquerors had not pursued them. or seen which way they were
gone: upon this the Spnninrd governor, n man ofhumnnity, would
not suffer them to kill the three fugitives, but sending three men out
by the tap nfthe hill,ordered them to go round, enmeiu lmhind them,
and xnrprise. and tnlte them prisoners; which was done. The residue
of the conquered people fled to their canoes, and got off to sea; the
victors retired, mode no pursuit, or very little, but drawing themselves
into n. body together, gave two screaming shouts, which they sup-
posed was by way of triumph, and no the fight ended ; and the same

13'
dny, about three o'clock in the afternoon, they also marched to their
canoes. And thus the Sfmniards had their island nguin free to them-
selves, their fright "as over, and they saw no savages in several years
after.

After they were all gone, the Spaniards came. out nftheir den, and
viz-wing the field of battle, they found nhunt uvu-zunl-thirty men dead
on the spat; some were killed with great lung m-ruwe, some of wlaieh
were faund stinking in their lmdies; hut most of them were killed
with great wooden swords. sixteen or seventeen of which they found
on the field of hattle, and as many hows, with a great. many arrows,

usage and affectionate nrguings; hut as they gave them their food
every day, so they gave them their work too, and kept them fully
employed in drudgery enough ; but they failed in thin by it, that; they
never had to assist them, and tight. for them, as I had my man Friday,
who "mi as true to me as the very flex]: upon my bones.

But to come to the family part. Being all now good friends, for
common danger, as I said above, had effectually reconciled them, they
began to consider their general t-ireinnnlanccs; and the first thing
that came under their comideration, was, whether, seeing the savages
particularly haunted that side of the island, and that there were more
rmnoto and retired parts of it equally adapted to their way of living,
and manifestly to their advantage, they should not. rather move their
habitation, and plant: in some more proper place for their safety, and
e:<1:eei:tlly for the security of their cattle and corn.

l'pon this, after 1011;:' delutte, it was concluded that they would not
remove their habitation , because that, some time or other, they
thought they might. hear from their governoragain, meaning me; and
it' I should send any one to Feel; tin-m, I should he sure to direct.
them to that, side; where, if they hlltllliti find the place demolished,
they would conclude the savages had killed uu all, and we were
{mine : end so our supply would go too. lot as to their corn and
cutie, the: agreed to remove them into the valley where my care
wan, where the land was as proper for hoth, and where, indeed, there
war: laud enough ; however, upon second thoughts, they altered one
part oftheir resolution too, and resolved only to remove part oftheir
cattle thither, and plant. part of their corn there; and so ifone part
was dchtroyed. the other might he saved. And one part ot'prudenco
they "50", which it was very well they did, \'i;:., that they never
touted those three savages, which they had prisoners, with knowing
anything of the plantation they had made in that \'altt'y, or of any
cattle. they had there, nun-h less of the care there. which they kept. in
(who nfnm~rs>ity, as a safe retreat; and Ihilhe. they carried also the
two lzarrels of powder which I had mnt them at my coming away.

lnt however they resolved not; to change. their habitation, yet. they
agreed, that as I had carefully covered it first \z'ilh a wall or fortifica-
tion, and then with a gram of trees, so seeing their safety consisted
entirely in heing concealed, of which they were new fully convinced,
they set to work to cover and conceal the place yet more effectually
than before. For this purpose, as I planted trees, or rather thrust in
stakes, which in time all grew up to be trees, for some good distance
before tho ontrnnco into my apartments, they went on in the same
)nunnt'r, nnd tilled up the rest. of that whole uliacn ut'gruund, from the

And now they had another broil with the three Englishmen, one
of whom, a. tnoal- turbulent fellow, Lcing in at ruge ltt om: of the three
slaves which I mentioned they had taken, he use the fellow had not
done something which he hid him do, and reamed a little untract-the
in his showing him, drew a hatchet. out of a frog-belt, in wharh he
wore it by his .~idc, and fell upon the poor mruge, hot to correct. him

 

but to kill him. One of tho Epttniards, who was by! seeing him giro
the follow it barbarous cut with the hatchet, which he aimed at his
head hut. struck into his shoulders, so that he thought he had cut the
poor creature's arm oil", ran to him, and entreating him not to murder
the poor then, placed himself hetween him and the savage to prevent
the mist- l'. The fellow being euro-'t'd the more at. this, struck M
the Spaniard with his hateht-t, and swore he would serve him as he
intended to serve the savage: which, the Spaniard pert- firing. avoided
the blow, and with u. shovel whirrh he had in his hand (for they were
nll working in the field about their corn-Lind) knocked the brute down.
Another of the Englishmen running at the same time to help his cum-

   

rade. knocked the Spaniard down ; and then two Spaniards more came
in to help their man, and "third Englishman fell in upon them. They

had liUllt' of them any firearms, or any other weapons but hutcheis and

them both. This fray net. the whole family in an uproar, and more
help coming in, they took llll'. three l'iuglirhutt'u prisoners. The next
question was what should he done with them. They had linen NI often
luminous, and were so very furiourt. so \ery desperate, and so idle
withal, they knew not what course to take with them, for they were
mischievous to the highest. degree, and 'nltmd not what hurt they did
to u'-v man; so that, in short, it was not safe to live with thenL

The. Spaniard who v: s governor told them, in so many words, that
it't'iey htul heen of his country. he would have hanged them; for all
luv- and all governors were. to preserve society, and those who were

ment of the other two 'l-luglishmen, who were their countrymen.

One of the two honest Englishmen stood up. and said they desired
it might. not be left to them, " For." says he, "i am sure we ought to
aentenee them to the gallows" And with that he gives an eremiut
how Will Atkins, one of the three, had proposed to hare all the five

Englishmen join together and murder all the Spaniards when they
were in their sleep.

When the Spanish governor heard this, he calls to Will Atkins,
" llow, Scnhor Atkins, would you murder us all i What have you to
say to that?" The hardened villain was so far from denying it that
he said l"it. was true, and, G-d d-n him, they would do it- still,
hello-e they had done with them." " Well, hut Senhur Atkins." says
the. Spaniard, " what have we done, to you, that you would kill us?
And what would you get hy killing us? And what must we do to
prevent your killing us? Must we kill you, or you kill us? Why
will you put us to tho neceSsity of this, Scnhm- Atkins?" says the
Spaniard, very calmly, and smiling. Seuhor Atkins was in such a
rage at the Spaniard's making a jest of it, that, had he. not hcen held
hy three men. and withal had no weapon near him, it was thought he
would have attempted to have killed the Spaniard in the middle ofnll
the company. This hair-brain carriage ohlignd them to consider se-
riously what was to he done. The two Englishmen. and the Spaniard
who saved the. poor savage, were of the opinion that they should hang
one of the three for an example to the rest, and that particularly it
should he he that had twice attempted to commit murder with his
hatchet; and, indeed, there was some reason to l-elievc he had done
it. for the poor savage was in such a miserable condition with the
wound he had received, that it was thought he could not, live. But
the governor Spaniard still said no; it wasI an Englishman that had
saved all their lives and he would never com-eat to put an English-
man to death, though he had murdered halt'of them; " Nay," he said,
" it'ho had linen killed himself by an Englislnnan, and had time left
to speak, it should he that they should pardon him i"

This was so positively insisted on by the governor Spaniard, that
there. was no gainsayiug it, and as merciful counsels are. most apt to
prevail when they are. so earnestly pressed, so they all came into it;
hot. when it was to he considered what should he done. to keep them
from doing the mi'<ehief they designed, for all agreed, governor and
all, that. means were. to he used for preserving the society from dan-
ger. After a long debate it was agreed, first, that they should ho dis-
nz'mcd, and not permitted to have either gun, powder, shot, sword, or
any weapon, and should he turned out of tho society. and left to live
where they would, and how they would, hy themselves : but that none
of the rest. either Spaniards or English, sln Ill-.1 converse with them,
speak with them,or have anything to do with them ; that they should
be forbid to come within a certain distance of the place where thenonxxsox 031.2802. 808

rest dwelt; and, if they ofi'ercd to commit any disorder, so as to spoil,
Lure, kill, or destroy any of the corn, plantings, buildings, fences, or
cattle, belonging to tho moiety, they should die without mercy, and
they should shoot them wherever they could find them.

The governor, a man of great humanity, musing upon the sentence,
considered a little upon it, and turning to the two honest Englishmen
said, " lIold! you murt reflect that it will be long ere they can rniro
corn and cattle of their own, and they must not starve; we must,
therefore, allow them provisions." So he caused to be nddcd, "that
they should have a proportion: of corn given them to lost them eight
months, and for seed to sow, by which they might ho supposed to
raise some of their own; that they should have six mileh goats, four
lie-goats. and six kids given them, as well for present suheistence as
for u. store; and that they should have tools given them for their
work in the fields, such as six hutchets, on udze. a saw, nnd the like;
but they should hare none of these tools or Pl'O'i'iaiUIlS, unless they
would swear solemnly that they would not hurt or injure any of the
Spaniards with them: or of their fellow Englishmen.

Thus they dismissed them the society, and turned them out to shift
for lhenmelves. They went away sullen and rot'metory, as neither
content to go nwny nor to stay; but us there was no remedy, they
went, pretending to go and choose it place where they would settle
themselves; and some provisions were given them, lint no weapons.

About four or live dnys nfter, they cume again for some vietuals,
und gave the governor un uceount uhere they had pitched their tents,
and marked thenmelvcs out n habitation nnd plantation ; and it was a.
very convenient place, indeed, on the remotest. part of the island, N.

llore they 'huilt themselves t-wn handsome huts, and contrived them,
in a manner, l kc my first huhitntion, being close under the side oftt
hill, having some trees growing already on three sides of it, so that
lny planting othenx it woull he very ensily covered from the right,
nnlers narrowly searched for. They desired some dried goat's skins,
for beds and covering, which were given them; and upon giving their
words that they would not disturb the rest, or injure any of their plan-
tntions, they gave them hate-hots, and what other tools they could
spore; some pens. barley. and rice, for sowing; and, in n word, any-
thing they wanted except arms and ammunition.

They lived in this separate condition about six months, and had got304 mvssrcars or

in their first hut-vest, though the quantity was but small, the parcel o!
lund they had pluntcd being hot- little; for, indeed, having all their
plantation to form, they had a grcut deal of work upon their hands;
and when they came to [nuke boards and putt-J, and such thinga, they
were quite out of their element, and could ntuko nothing of it; and
\\ hen the rainy season more on. for want. of a euro in the earth, they
could not keep their grain Ilry,und it was in great danger ofspoiling;
and this humbled them much; so they came and hugged tho Spun-
im'tlu to help them, whit-h they very rendily did; and in four duyo
worked a great hole in the side of the hill for them, hip; enough to
secure their corn and other things from the. ruin; but it wnu hut. I

About three quarters of a year after this separation, a new frolic
took these rogues, which, together with the former villany they hud
committed, brought. mischief enough upon them, and had very near
been the ruin of the whole colony. The three new associates began,

" . UT I leave observing, and return to the story. The three
'/"\ . . . .
-' fellows came down to the Spaniards one morning, and m
- '7' very humhle terms desired to he admitted to speak with
' ' them; the Spaniards very readily heard what they had to
say, which was this: That they were tired of living in the manner
they did ; and that. they were not handy enough to make the nevus>>).-
ries they wanted, and that having no help, they found they should he
starred; but if the Spaniards would give them leave to take one oi
the canoes which they came over in, and give them arms and ammu-
nition proportioned to their defence, they would go over to the main
and seek their fortunes. and no deliver them from the trouble of sup-
plying them with any other provisions.

The Spaniards were glad enough to get rid of them, but very hon-
ostly ropi-eseuted to them the certain destruction they were running
into; told them they had nufi'ered such hardships upon that very rput
that they could, without any spirit of prophesy, tell them they would
he starred, or murdered, and bade them consider of it.

The men replied andaciously, they should be starved if they stayed
here, for they could not work, and would not work, and they could
but. he starred abroad : and if they \- ere nmrdered, there was an end
of them; they had no wives or children to cry after them : and, in short,
insisted importunately upon their demand; declaring they would go.
whether they gave them any arms or no.

The Spaniards told them. with great kindness, that 'if' they were
resolved to go, they should not go like naked men, and he in no can-
(lifinn to defend themselves; and that though they could ill spare their
firearms, having not enough for themselves, yet, they would let them
have nro nmskets, a pistol and a cutlass, and each man a hatchet,
\\ hiuh they thought was sufficient for them. In a word. they accepted
the odor ; and having halted them bread enough to serve them a month
and given them as much goat's flerh as they could eat while it we:
meet, and a great basket of dried grapes. and a put of fresh water,
and a young kid alive, they boldly set out in the canoe for a voyage
"er the sea, where it was at least forty miles broad.

The boat indeed, was it large one, and would very well have carried

an,
fifteen or twenty men, and therefore was rather too big for them to
manage ; but no they had a fair breeze, and flood tide with them, they
did well emmgh. They had made a mast of a long pole, and a rail
of four largo goat'n skins, dried, which they had eewod or laced to
gather. and away they went merrily enough; the Spaniards cull-ad
after them linen ridge; and no man ever thought of seeing them
buy more.

The Spaniards were. often saying to one another, and to the two
honest Englialnnon who remained behind. how quietly and comfort-
Ithly tin-y hnd Iiu-d, now them: three turbulent. follows were gone; as

" llow do you mean, you cannot tell who ? They are the savage>>, to

with urine." " Nay, then," says the Spaniard, " why are you eon-
corned 1 If they are not savages, they must he friends; for there in

While they were debating thus, ennu- tho three Englishmen, and
standing without the wood, which was new planted. hallooed to tlmtn;
tin-y presently knew their voices, and so all the wonder ot'that. kind
ceased. lint now the admiration was turned upon another question,
Vii", what could he the matter, and what made them come back
again T

It was not long before they brought the men in, and inquiring
vhere they had been, and what they had been doing, they gave them
| full account. of their voyage in a few words, viz., That they reached
the land in two days, or something less; but finding the petjlo
alarmed at their coming. and preparing with bows and arrows to
fight them. they durst not go on shore, hut sailed on to the northward
six or seven hours, till they came to a great opening, by which they
perceived that the land they saw from our island was not the main,
but an island upon entering that opening of the see, they 33'
another island on the right head, north, and several more west; and
being resolved to land somewhere, they put. orer to one of the islands
which lay west. and went boldly on shore ; that they found the
looplo very courteous and friendly to them; and that they gave them
several roots and some dried fish, nnd nppearcd very sociable; and
the women as well as the men were very forward to nupply them with
anything they could get for them to eat, tuid brought it to them a
great way upon their heads.

They continued here four days ; and inquired, as well as they could
oflhem, hy signs, what nations were this way, and that way; and
were told of several fierce and terrible people that lircd almost every
way. who,a.~1 they made known hy signs to them, used to eat men;
but as for thenmelren, they said they never ate men or women, except
only such as they look in the wars; and then, they owned, they made
:1 great feaeet, and ate their prisoners.

The Englishmen inquired when they had a. feast ofthnt kind; and
they told them about two months ago, pointing to the moon; and to
two lingers: and that their great hing had two hundred prisoners
now, which he had taken in his war, and they were feeding them to
make them fat for the next feast. The Englishmen seemed mighty
desirous; of seeing those prisoners; but the others mistaking them,
thought they were deairons to have some of them to carry away for
their own eating; so they heckened to them, pointing to the setting
ofthe sun, and then to the rising; which was to signify that the next
morning at sun-ri.~iug they would lvring atnue for theta; and. accord.
ingly, the next morning, they hrought down fire women, and eleven
men, and gave them to the Englishmen, to carry with them on their
voyage, just us we wotthl bring so many cows and oxen down to a
Seaport town to vietual a ship.

Au hrutish and harharous 1L9 these fellows were at home, their
stountehs turned at this sight, and they did not. know what to do. To
refuse the prisoners would have heon the highest afi'ront. to the savage
gentry that could he offered them, and what to do with them they
how not. However, after some debate they resolved to accept of
them: and. in return, they gave the savages that hrought them one of
their hatehets. an old key, a knife, and six or seven oftheir hullct-'B;
which. though they did not understand their use, they seemed par~
tieularly pleased with; and then tying the poor creaturea' hands he.
hind them, they dragged the prisoners in the hoot. for our men.

The Englishmen were obliged to come away as soon as they had
them, or else they that gave them this noble present would certainly
have expected that they should have gone to work with them, have
killed two or three of them the next morning, and perhnps have in-
vited the donors to dinner. But having taken their leave, with
all the respect nod thanks that could well' punt between people,
where, on either side. they understood not: one word they could any,
they put off with their bent, and come hack toward the first islnnd ;
where= when they arrived, they set eight of their prisoners at liberty,
there being too many of them for their occasion.

in their voyage, they endeavored to have some communication with
their prisoners; but it was impossible to make them nndemtund
anything; nothing they could say to them, or give them, or do for
them, but was limited upon as going to murder them. They first of
all unbound them ; but the poor creatures screamed nt that, especially
the women, no if they luul jmt felt. the knife nt their throats ; for they
immediately (-oneluded they were, unbound on purpose. to be killed.
If they glue them nnything to eat, it was the. some thing; they then
concluded it was for fear they should sink in flesh, and so not be fut
enough to kill, If they looked at. one ofthetu more particularly. the
party presently concluded it was to see whether he or she. was fattest,
and liner-t to kill first; nuy, nl'ler they lmd brought them quite over,
and begun to use them kindly, und treat them well, still they expected
erery dny to make a dinner or summi- for their new nnn'ters.

When the three wander-ere had given this t!mun-turntable history or
journal of their roynge, the Spnniurd ltrktrtl them where their new
family was; and being told that they had brought them onshore, nnd
put them into one of their huts, and were come up to beg some
Tiettmls for them, they (the Spuninrdr) and the other two Englishmen,
that iJ to say, the whole colony, resolved to go ull down to the place
mul see them: and (lid so, and Friday's father with them.

When they came into the hut, there they sat nll bound; for when
they lnnl brought them on shore. they hound their hands, that they
might not take the boat and make their escape; there, I say, they
out. all of them stark naked. Firut, there were three men, lusty,
romoly fellows, well-nhnped, straight and fair limbs, about thirty to
thirty-tire yearn ofogc 3 and five women, whereof two might he from
thirty to forty : two more not nhore four or five'mul-twenty _: and the
fifth, :\ tnll comely maiden, about sixteen or seventeen. The women
were well-throred, agreeable persons, hoth in slmpo and features,
only tawny: mul two of them, had they been perfect white, Would
have passed for very handsome women, even in London itself, having
plenum: agreeable countenancu, and of a very modest behavior:
especially when they came afterward to be clothed and dressed, as
they called it, though that dress was very indill'erent, it must. be con-
fcssed ; of which hereafter.

The sight, you may be sure, was something uncouth to our
Spaniards, who were, to give them it just character, men of the best
behavior, of the most. calm, sedate tempers, and perfect. good humor,
that. ever 1 met with; and, in particular, of the most modest, as will
presently appear; I say the sight was very uncouth, to ace three
naked men and tire naked women, all together bound, and in the
most miserable circmnstnnces that human nature could be supposed to
be, via: to be expecting every moment. to be dragged out, and have
their brains knocked out, and then to be eaten up like a calf that is
killed for a dainty.

The first thing they did was to cause the old Indian, F riday's father,
to go in and see, first, it' he. know any of them, and than if he under.
stood any of their speech. As soon as the old man came in he looked
seriously at them, but knew none. of them, neither could any of them
understand u. word he said, or a sign he could make, except. one of
the women. llowcver,this was enough to answer theend,whieh was
to satisfy them that the men into whose hands they were fallen were
Christians; that they abhor-red eating men or women, and that they
might be sure they would not he killed. As soon as they were assured
of this, they discovered ouch n. joy, and by such awkward gestures,
several ways, on is hard to describe, for it seems they were of several
nations.

The woman who was their interpreter was hid, in the next place,
to Mk them if they were Willing to he servants, and to work for the
men who had brought, them away, to save their lives. At which they
all fella dancing, and presently one full to taking up this, and an-
other that, anything that. lay next, to carry on their shoulders, to iuti-
mate that they were willing to work.

The governor, who found that the having women among them would
presently be attended with some inconveniencgaad might occasion
some strife, and perhaps blood, asked the three men what they in-
tended to do with these women, and how they intended' to use them--
whether as servants or as women ? One of the Englishmen answered
very boldly and readily, that " they would use them as both." To
which the governor said, "I am not going to restrain you from it ,-
you are your own masters as to that; but this l think is'hnt just, for-
avoiding disorders and quarrels among: you, and I desire it. of you for
that reason only, viz.: that. you will all engage that if any of you take310 wrearnans or

any of these women as a woman or wife, that he shall take but one,
and that having taken one, none clue shall touch her; for, though we
cannot. marry any one of you, yet it is but reasonable that whiie you
stay here. the woman any of you taken should be maintained by the
man who takes her, and should he his wife; I mean," says he, "while
he continues here, and that none else shall have anything to do with
113:." All this appeared so just, that every one agreed to it. without
any dillicnlty.

Then the Englishmen asked the Spanlards if they designed to take
any of thenl, but every one of them answered no: some of then) mid.
they had wives in Spain; and the others did not like women that were
not Christians, and all togothcr declared that. tho",r would not touch
one of them; 'Vhit'h was an instance ol'mch virtue as I have not met
with in all my travels. ()n the other hand, to he rhort, the lire Eng-
lishmen took them every one a wi'i- tlmt. is to Nt)', a temporary wife,

them should not pitch upon the some woman, especially roving two

outwixlorcd hotter than any of thom, that it was application and l uri-
ness they wore to expect assistance in as much as in anything (-136,
and she. proved the ert wife of all the parcel.

"'hen the. poor woman raw themselves set in a row tlms,ar.d fetch-
ed out one luv one. the terrors of their condition returned upon them
again, and they lirtnlv believed they were now going to he devoured.
Accordingly, when the English saiior ear-to in and fetched out one of
them, the rest set up a most lamentable cry, and hung about her, and
took their leave of her with such agonies and atl'eetion us would have
grieved the hardest heart in the world; nor was it possible for the
Englislnucn to satisfy them that they were not to he immediately
murdered, till they fetched the old man, Friday's father, who inunc-
tliately let them know that the live men who had fetched them out
One hy one, had chosen them for their wives.

When they had done, and the fright the women were in was a little
over, the men went to work, and the Spaniards came and helped them,
and in a few hours they had built them every one A new hut or tent for
their lodging apart, for those they had already were crowded with
their tools, household stufl', and provisions. The three wicked ones
had pitched farthest oil", and the two honest ones nearer, but both on
the north shore of the island, so that they continued separated, as he-
fore; and thus my island was peopled in three places, and, 9.3 I might
say, three towns were begun to he built.

And here it is very well worth observing, that, as it often happens
in the world (what the wise ends of God's provident-e are, in such a
disposition of things, I cannot say), the two honest fellows had the
two worst wives; and the three reprohates, that wore scarce worth
hanging, that were fit for nothing, and neither seemed born to do
themselves good nor any one else, had three clever, diligent. careful,
and ingenious wires. Not that the first two were bad wives, as to
their temper and humor, for all the five were most wiliing, quiet, push
sire, and sulnjeotcd creatures, rather like slaves than wives; but my
meaningr is, they were not alike capable, ingenious, or industrious, or
alike cleanly and neat.

Another ohscrvalion I must, make, to the honor of a diligent appli-
cation, on one hand, and to the disgrace of a slulliful, negligent, idle
temper on the other, that when I came to the place, and viewed the
several improvements, plantings, and management of the several little
Colonies, the two men had so far outgone the three that there was no
comparison. They had, indeed, hath of them, us much ground laid
out for corn as they wanted, and the reason was because, according to
my role, nature dictated that it was to no purpose to sow more corn
than they wanted; hut the difi'ereuee of the cultivation, of the plant-
ing, of the fences, and, indeed, of everything else, was easy to Le seen
at first view.

The two men had innumerable young trees planted about their huts
so that when you came to the place nothing was to be seen hut wood,
and though they had twice had their plantation demolished, once by81 2 Avvaa'rutms or

well and comfortably; and the slothful lived hard and heggarly; and
no, I heliete, generally speaking, it in all over the world.

But now I come to a scene difi'erent from all that had happened
before. either to them or to me; and the original of the story was
this: Early one morning, there came on shore five or six canoes of
Indiana or savages, eall theta which you please. and there is no room
to dnuht they came upon the old errand of feeding upon their slaves ;
but that. part. was now so familiar to the Spaniards, and to our men,
too, that. they did not. concern themselves almut it, as I did ; lrut
having haen made uensihlc lry their experience, that their only busi-
ness was to lie concealed, and that if they were not seen by any of
the savage; they would go nll' again quietly, when their business
was done, having. as yet, not. the least notion of there being any in-
habitants in tho island : I say, hating heenniado sonsihle oflhis, they
had nothing to do but give notice to all the three plantations to ltccp
within doors, and not to show themselves. only placing a scout in a
proper place, to give notice when the heats went. to sea. again.

This was, \vithoutdnuht, very right : hut a disaster Bpoilcd all these
measures. and made it known among the ravages that there were in-
habitants there; which was, in the end, the desolation of almost the
whole colony. After the canoes with tho savages were gone oil': the
Spaniards peeped abroad again ; and some of theta had the curiosity
to got.) the place where they had been, to see what they had been
doing. llere, to their great surprise, they finmd three savages left
behind, and lying fast asleep upon the ground. It was supposed they
had either been so gorged with their inhuman feast, that, like beasts,
they were fallen asleep, and would not stir when the others went, or
they had wandered into the woods, and did not come buck in time to
be taken in.

The Spaniards were greatly surprised at this sight, and perfectly at
a loss what to do. The Spanish governor, as it happened, was with
them, find his advice was asked. hut he professed he knew not what
to do. As for slaves, they had enough already; and as to killing
them, they were none of them inclined to that: the Spanish governor
told me. they could not think of shedding innocent blood: for as to
them, the poor creatures had done them no wrong, invaded none of
their property, and they thought they had no just quarrel against
them, to take away their lives. And here I must, in justice to these
Spaniarda observe, that let the accounts of Spanish cruelty in Mexico
Ind Peru be what they will, I never met with seventeen men of any

14
nation whatsoever. in any foreign country, who were so universally
modest, temperate, virtuous, so very goetl-humorcd and so courteous7
us these Spaniards; and M to cruelty, they had nothing of it in their
very nature' no inhumanity, no hnrharity, no outrageous pensions;
and yet all of them men of great courage and spirit. The temper
and calmness had appeared in their hearing the insufferable usage of
the three Englishmen; and their justice and humanity appeared now
in the ease of the savages, an above. After some consultation, they
resolved upon this: that they would lie still a while longer, till, if
pousihle, them three men might be gone. But then the governor
Spaniard rtn-ollet'ted, that the three savages had no heat; and if they
wore left to rum about. the island, they would certainly discover that:
there wore inhahitant". in it; and so they should be undone that. way.
1thth this they went. haul: again, and there lay the fellows fast asleep
still, and so they remlvrd to \t'aken them, and take them prisoners;
and they did N). The poor fellows were strangely frightened when
they were seized upon and hound; and afraid, like the women, that
they should he murdered and eaten: for it. seems those people thi::k
all the world dues us they do, eating men's flesh : hut they were soon
made easy as to that, and away they carried them.

It \'an very happy for them that they did not carry them home
to their castle--l mean to my paint-e under the lull ; hut they
carried them first to the bower, where was the chief of their main
try work, such an the keeping the goats, he planting the corn, tie;
and afterward they 'ztrried them to the habitation of the two lin-
glislnnen.

llere they were not to wark. though it was not much they had for
them to do: and whether it was lny :n-glige tee in guarding them, or
that. thoy thought. the fellow." could not mend themselves, I know not,
but one of tla run away, and taking to the woods, they could never
hear ot'hinl any more.

They had good rezuzon to lmliero he got home again soon after,
in Fume other hoats or t'anoefi of savages who came on shore three or
four weeks afterward: and who. carrying on their revels as usual,
went off in two days' time. This thought. terrified them exceedingly;
for they man-lulled. and that not without good cause indeed, that if
this frilmv came home safe among: his comrades, he would certainly

 

give them an account that there were people in the island, and also ht-w
few and weal: they were; for this savage. a: l ohservt-d hefore. had
never been told, and it was very happy he had not, how many there
were, or where they lived _: nor had he ever seen or heard the fire of
any of their guns, much less had they shown him any of their other
retired places; such as the cave in the valley, or the new retreat
which the two Eugliehmen had made. and the like.

The first testimony theyhad that this fellow had given intelligence
of them was, that, about. two months after this, six canoes of savages,
with about seven. eight, or ten men in u. canoe, came rowing along
the north side of the island, where they never used to come before,
and landed, about an hour after sunrise, at it convenient place, about
a mile from the habitation of the two Englishmen, where this escaped
man had been kept. As the Spaniard governor said, had they been
all there, the damage would not. have been so much, for not a man of
them would have escaped: but the case ditl'cred now Very much, for
two men to fifty was too much odds. The two men had the ha! piness
to discover them about a. league off, so that it was above an hour he-
fore they landed; and as the
some time before they could come at. them. Now, having great
reason to believe that they were l:-ctrayed, the first thing they did
was tn hind the the slaves which were left, and caused two ol the
three men whom they had brought. with the women (who, it- eeems,
proved \ery faithful to llwm). to lead them, with their two wives, and
whatever they could carry away with them, to their retired plat-ea in
the woods, which I have spoken of ahore, and there to hind the two
fellows hand and foot, till they heard further.

in the next- plaee, seeing the savages were all come on shore, and

 

y landed a mile from their hats, it was

that they had beat their course directly that way, they opened the
fences where the milk goats were kept, and drove them all out; leav-
ing their goats to tat-r ,ggle in the woods, whither they pleased, thatthe
savages might think they were all bred wild; but the rogue who came
with them was too cunning for that, and gave them an account of it
all, for they went. directly to the place.

When the two poor frightened men had secured their wims and
goods, they sent the other slave they had of the three tree came with
the women, and who was at theirplaoe by accident, away to the Span-
iards with all speed, to give them the alarm and desire speedy help;
and, in the meantime, they took their arms and what ammunition they
had, and retreated toward the place in the wood where their wires
were sent; keeping at a distance, yet so that they might see, if possi-
ble, which way the savages took.

They had not gone far, but that from n. rising ground they could see
the little army of their enemies come on directly to their habitation,
Ind, in a moment more, could see all their huts and household stutf
flaming up together, to their grout grief and mortifleation; for they
hutl at very great less to them, irretriernhle, nt lethal. t'ur Ntluu time.
They kept. their stntiun fur it while, till they fuund the Navngt'n like
wild beasts, spread themselves nll ever the plaice, ruunnnging every
way nnd every place they could think ut', in aeurch of prey ; nut] in
particular for the people, of whom, new, it plainly appeared they had
intelligence.

though all the savages that were loaded, which was near fifty, were
to attack them.

llaving resolved upon this, they next considered whether they should
fire at the first two, or wait for the three, and so take the middle party,
by which the two and the fire that followed would be separated; at
length they resolved to let the first two pass by, unless they should spy
them in the tree, and cmne to attack them. The first two savages
confirmed them also in this resolution, by turning a little from them
toward another part of the wood ; but the three, and the fire after
them, came forward directly to the tree, as if they had known the
l-Inglishmeu were there. Seeing them come so straight toward them,
they resolved to take them in a line as they came; and as they re-
solved to fire but one at a time, perhaps the first shot might hit them
all three ; for which purpose, the man who was to fire put three or
four small bulletn into his piece; and having a fair loophole, as it
were, from a broken hole in the tree, he took a sure aim, without be-
ing seen, waiting till they were within about thirty yards of the tree,
so that he could not miss.

While they were thus waiting, and the savages came on, they plainly
saw that one of the three was the runaway savage that had escaped
from them; and they both knew him distinctly, and resolved that, if
possible, he should not escape, though they should both fire; so the
other stood ready with his piece, that if he did not drop at the first
shot, he should be sure to bore a second. But the first was too good
a marksman to miss his aim ; for as the savages kept near one another,
a little behind, in a line, he fired, and hit two of them directly; the
foremost was killed outright, being shot-in the head; the second, which
was the runaway lndian, was shot. through the body. and fell but was
not quite dead; and the third had It little scratch on the shoulder,
perhaps by the same hall that went through the body of the second ;
and being dreadfully frightened, though not so much hurt, sat down
upon the ground, screaming and yelling in a hideous manner.

The fire that were behind, more frightened with the noise than sen-
sible of danger. stood still at first:' for the woods made the sound a
tlmusand times bigger than it really was, the echoes rattling from one
ride to another, and the fowls rising from all parts. screaming, and erery
sort making a different noise. according to their kind : just as it was
when I fired the first gun that perhaps was ever shot off in the island.

llowerer, all being silent again, and they not knowing what the
matter was cams on unconcerned, till they came to the place where
their companions lay, in s condition miserable enough 3 and here the
poor ignorant. creatures, not sensible that. they were within reach of
the same mischief, stood all of n huddle over the wounded man, talk-
ing. and, m4 may be unliposed, inquiring of him how he came to be
hurt ; nnd who, it is very rational to believe, told them that a flash of
fire first. and immediately utter that thunder from their gods, hnd lilll-
ed those two and wounded him; tliie, i any, is rational; for nothing
is more certain than that, its they saw no man near them, an they had
never heard u. gun in all their lives; nor my much as heard of a gun;
neither knew they nnything of killing and wounding at a distance
with tire and bullets ; if they had, one might rem-onably believe they
would not have stood an unconcerned in riewing the fate of their fel-
lows, without some. appehensions of their own.

Our two men, though as they confessed to me, it grieved them to be
obliged to kill so many poor creatures, who, at. the name time, had no
notion oftheir danger ; yet; liming them all thus in their power, and
the first Inning loaded his piece again, resohed to let lly both to>>
gether among them: and singling out. by agreement, which to aim at,
they shot together. and killed, or very much wounded. four of them;
the fifth, frightened even to death, though not hurt. fell with the rest:
so that our men, seeing them all fall together, thought they had killed
them all.

The heliefthat the savages were all killednnade our two men enmo
boldly out from the tree before they had charged their guns, which
was a wrong step; and they were under some surprise when they
came to the plum: and found no less than four of them alive. and of
them two very little hurt; and one not at all; this obliged them to
titll ulmtt them with the stocks of their mindsets; and first they made

them cross over a. valley toword the sen, quite the eontrory way from
that which led to their retreat, which they were afraid of : nod being
satisfied of that, they went back to the tree where they left their
prisoner, who, tu! they supposed, want delivered by his comrades, for
he won gone, and the two pieces of rope-yarn, with which they had
hound him, hty just at the foot of the tree.

They were now in us grout concern m4 before, not knowing what.
course to take, or how ncur the. enemy might be, or in wlntt numbers;
so they resolved to go away to the place where their wives were, to
see if nll was well there, and to nntke them easy, who were in fright
enough, to be euro; for though the snvoges \vcte their own country-
fnlk, yet they were most terribly nt'ruid of them, and pcrhnps the
tnoro for the knowledge they lntd ofthem.

When they came there, they found the savages had been in the
anl, and very near thut place, but had not found it; for it was in-
deed inucremihlc, hy the trees standing so thick, air before, unless the
pursuit: seeking it bud been directed by those that knew it, which
these did not; they found, tlieruiiwe, everything very safe, only the
women in n terrible fright. While they were here, they had the
comfort to have seven of the Spaniards come to their assistance ; the
other ten, with their scrrnnts. and old Friday. I moon Fridny's father,
were gone in n hotly to defend their bower, and the corn and cattle
that were kept there, in cue the savages should have roved over to
that side of the country ; but they (lid not spread so for. "'ith the
seven Spaniards come one of the three unvagex, who, as I anid, were
their prisoners formerly: and with them also came the savage whom
the l-Inglislnnen had left hound hand and {not at the tree; for it seems
they came thnt way saw the slaughter of the seven men, and unbound
the eighth, and brought him along with them ; where, however, they
were obliged to bind him "gain, as they had the two others who were
left when the third run away.

The prisoners now begun to be it hnrthon to them ; and they were
so afraid of their escaping, that they were once resolving to kill them
all. believing they were under an absolute necessity to do so for their
own preservation. However, the Spaniard governor would not con-
sent to it; but ordered. for the present, that they should be sent out
of the way. to my old cave in the valley, and he kept there, with two
Spaniards to guard them, and give them food for their subsistence,
which was done; and they were bound there hand and foot for that
night.

When the Spaniards came, the two Englishmen were so encouraged.
that they could not satisfy themselves to stay any longer there ; but

taking tire of tho Spanim'de and themselvetl, with four munkotn and a

pistol among them, and two stout. quarter-stares, away they went. in

quest of the nitrogen. And first they came to the tree where the men

lay that had been killed; but it was easy to one that name more of thei
lounges had hccn there, {or they had attempted to carry their dead

they had stood and seen their eznnp destroyed, and where they had

the mortification ntill to see some of the smoke; but neither could

they here see any of the sat-ages. They then resolved, though with

all posxihlo caution, to go forward, toward tlteir ruined plantation;

but. a little hel'ore they canto hither, coming in night of the seanhore,

they saw plainly the savages all t'tnhat'ked again in their canoes, in

order to he 3! mo. They seemed Hurry, at. first. that there was no way

to come at them, to give them a parting How ; hut, nyon the whole,

they were very well satisfied to ho rid ot'tht'tn.

The poor Englislnnen being new twice ruined, and all their im-
provements destroyed, the rent all agreed to come and help them to
relutiltl, and to assist. them with needle] supplies. Their three coon
trymen, who were not yet. noted [or having the least. inclination to do
any good, yet. as soon as they heard of it. (for they, living remote
ea<twartl,know nothing of the matter till all was over). came and
ofl'ored their help and muistanee, and did very friendly work for
aereral days, to restore their habitation, and make necessaries for
them. And thus, in a little time, they were set upon their legs
agnin.

Ahout two days after this, they had the farther satisfaction of sec-
ing three of the snvages' canoes come driving on shore, and, at aotne
distance from them, two drowned men ; by which they had reason to
believe that they had met with a storm at sea. which had orersct
some ofthem : for it had hlown very hard the night after they went off.

However, as some might miscarry, no. on the other hand, enough of
them escaped to inform the rest, as Well of what they had done. as of
what. happened to them, and to whet them on to another enterprise of
the same nature; which they, it seems. resolved to attempt. with
etttfieient force to carry all before them : for except what the first. man
had told them of inhahitnnts, they could say little ot'it ot'their own
knowledge. for they never snw one man ; and the fellow being
killed that. had afitmed it, they land no other witness to confirm it to
them.
It was five or six months after this, before they heard any more of
the savages, in which time our men were in hopes they either forget
their former bad luck, or had given over hopes of better: when, on a
sudden, they were invaded with a most formidable fleet of no less than
cight-nud-twenty canoes, full of savages, armed with bows and arrows,
great clubs, wooden swords, and such-like engines of war ; and they
brought such numbers with them, that, in short, it put all our people
Into the utmost consternation. .

As they came on shore in the evening, and at the easternmost side
of the island, our men had that night to consult and consider what to
do; and, in the first place, knowing that their being entirely con-
cealed was their only safety before, and would be much more so now,
while the number of their enemies was so great, they therefore re-
solved, first of all, to take down the huts which were built for the two
Englishmen, and drive away their goats to the old cave; because they
supposed the savages would go directly thither, as soon as it. was day,
to play the old game over again, though they did not new land within
two leagues of it. In the next place, they drove away all the flocks
of goats they had at the old bower, as I called it, which belonged to
the Spaniards: and, in hhort, left as little appearance of inhabitants
anywhere as was possible 5 and the next morning early they posted
themselves, with all their force, at; the plantation of the two men, to
wait for their coming. As they guessed, so it happened; these new
invaders leaving their canoes at the east end of the island, came
ranging along the shore, directly toward the place. to the number of
two hundred and fifty, as near as our men could judge. Our army
was but small, indeed _; but that which was worse, they had not arms
for all their on mhcr neither. The whole account, it seems, stood
thus: first, as to men, seventeen Spaniards. five Englishmen, old
Friday, or Friday's father, the three slaves taken with the women,
who proved very faithful, and three other slaves, who lived with the
Spaniards. To arm these, they had eleven mnskets, five pistols, three
fading-pieces, five musket: or fowling-pieces which were taken by
me from the mutinoas seamen whom I reduced, two swords, and three
old hnlherds.

To their slaves they did not give either musket or fuseo, but they
had every one a hnlberd, or a long staff, like a quarter--stair, with a
great spike of iron fastened into each end of it, and by his side a
hatchet; also. every one of our men had a hatchet. Two of the my
men could not be prevailed upon, but they would come into the fight,
and they had bows and arrows, which the Spaniards had taken from

14'322 newsman or

the savage! when the first action happened, which I have spoken at
where the Indiana fought with one another, and the women had hat-
chots, too.

The Spaniard governor, whom I described so often, commanded the
whole, and Will Atkins, who, though a dreadful fellow for wicked-
eduess, was a most daring, bold fellow, commanded under him. The
savages came forward like lions, and our men, which was the worst
of their fate, had no advantage in their situation; only that Will At-
kins, who now proved a most useful fellow, with six men, was planted
just behind a small thicket of hushes, as an advance guard, wit-h
orders to let the first of them pass hr, and then fire into the middle
of them, and as soon as he had fired, to make his retreat as nimhle
as he could round a part of the wood, and so come in behind
the Spaniards, where they stood, having a thicket of trees before
them.

When the savages came on, they ran straggling about every way in
heaps, out of all manner of order, and Will Atkins lot about fifty of
them pass by him. then, seeing the rest come in a very thick strong,
he orders three of his men to tire, having loaded their muskets with
six or seven bullets apiece, about as big as large pistol bullets. How
many they killed or wounded they knew not, hut the consternation
and surprise were inoxpressihle among the mvages: they were fright--
ened to the last degree to hear such a dreadful noise, and see their
men killed and others hurt, but see nohody that did it: when, in the
middle of their fright, Will Atkins and his other three let fly again
among the thickest of them. and in less than a minute, the first three
being loaded again, gave them a. third volley.

llatl \l'ill Atkins and his men retired immediately, as soon as they
had fired, ax they were ordered to do,or had the rest- of the hotly lrccn
at hand. to have poured in their shot continually, the savages would
have been cil'oc-ually routed, for the terror that was among them came
principally from this. vi7... that they were killed by the gods with
thunder and lightning, and could see nohody that hurt them: hut
Will Atklm. staying to load again, discovered the cheat: some of the
savages who were at a distance spying tlmm. came upon them he-
hind: and. though Atkins and his men fired at them,' also, two or
three times. and killed nhore twenty, retiring as fast on they could,
yet they wounded Atkins himself and killed one ofhis fellow English-
men with their arrows, as they did afterward one Spaniard, and one
of the Indian slaves who came with the women. This slave was a.
most gallant fellow, and fought most desperately, killing fire of them20312;sz cnoson. 823

with his own hand, having no weapon but one of the armed stares and
a hatchet.

Our men being thus hard laid at, Atkins wounded, and two other
men killed, retreated to a rising ground in the wood ; and the Span-
iards, after firing three volleys upon them, retreated also; for their
number was so great. and they were so desperate, that though above
fifty of them were killed, and more than us many Wounded, yet they
came on in the teeth of our men, fearless of danger, and shot their
arrows like a cloud; and it was observed that their wounded men,
who were not quite disabled, were made outrageous by their wounds,
and fought like madmen.

When our men retreated, they left the Spaniard and the English-
man that were killed behind them ; and the savages, when they came
up to them, killed them over again in a wretched manner. breaking
their arms, legs, and heads, with their clubs and wooden swords, like
true savages, but finding our men were gone they did not seem to
pursue them, but drew themselves up in a ring, which is, it seems,
their custom, and shouted twice, in token of their victory, after which
they had the mortifieation to see several of their wounded men fall,
dying with the more loss of blood.

The Spaniard governor having drawn his little body up together
upon n. rising ground, Atkins, though he was wounded, would have
had them march, and charge again all together at once; but the
Spaniard replied, "Sonhor Atkins, you see how their wounded men
fight ; let them all alone till morning: all the wounded men will be
still and sore with their wounds, and faint with the loss of blood, and
so we shall have the fewer to engage." This advice was good, but
Will Atkins replied merrily, "That is true, senhor, and so shall I, too,
and that is the reason I would go on while I am worm." "ll'cll,
Sonhor Atkins," says the Spaniard, " you have behaved gallantly and
dune your part; we will fight for you. if you cannot come on, hut I
think it best to stay till morning ;" so they waited.

But as it was a clear moonlight night, and they found the savages
in great disorder about their dead and wounded men. and a great noise
and hurry among them where they lay, they afterward resolved to
fall upon them in the night; especially if they could come to give
them but one volley before they were discovered, which they had a
fair opportunity to do: for one of the Englishmen, in whose quarter
it was where the fight began, led them round between the woods and
the seaside, westward, and then turning short south, they eamese near
where the thickest of them lay, that, before they were seen or heard,8 2 t anvaxrcnne or

eight of them fired in among them, and did dreadful execution upon
them. ln half a minute more eight others fired after them, pouring in
their small shot in such quuntity that abundance were killed and
Wounded, and all this while they were not able to see who hurt them:
or which wuy to fly.

The Spaniardn charged ngoio with the utmost expedition, and then
divided themselves in three hodies, and resolved to full in among

hem all together. They had in each hody eight permnr: that is to
any. tWentyvtwn, and two women, who, hy the way, fought despe-
rately. 'i'hey divided the firearms equally in each yarty, end so the
hulherds and stores. They would have had the women kept hack,
hut- they said they were resolved to die with their hushands. "av-
ing thus t'ornwd their little army, they nmrehed out from among the
trees, and come up to the teeth of the enemy, shouting and lntllooing
as loud mt they could. The savages stood all together, but were in
the utmost confusion, hearing the noise of our men shouting from
three quarters together: they would have fought if they had seen us,
for us soon as we came near enough to be seen, some arrows were
shot, and poor old Friday was wounded, though not dangerously ; but.
our men gave them no time, but, I'tlllllilig up to them, tired among
them three ways, and then fell in with the hutt-endu of their rnusketa,
their swords, nrmod stoves, and hatehets, and laid about them so well
that, in A word, they set up a (liunol nereaming and howling, flying to
save their lives which way merur they euuld.

Our men were tired with the execution, and killed or mortally;
wounded in two tights ahout one hundred nnd elgltv of them; the

to; and as we did not trouhle ourselves much to pornue them, they
got altogether to the seaside where they landed, and where their en.

terrihle storm of wind that evening from the see, so that it was im-
possihle for them to go oll'; nay, the storm continuing all night. when
the tide came up, their eanoes were. most of them driven by the surge
of the sea so high upon the shore, that it required infinite toil to get
them 03'; and some of them were even dashed to pieces against. the
beach, or against one another.

Our men, though glad of their victory, yet get little rest that night
but having refreshed themselves as well us they could, they resolve
to march to that part of the island, where the savages had tied. and
we what posture they were in. This neeesaarily led them over thenontxsoa crimson. 3 I

place where the tight had been, and where they found several of t to
poor creatures not quite dead, and yet past recovering lifc ; a sight
disagreeable enough to generous minds ; for a truly great man, though
obliged by the law of battle to destroy his enemy, takes no delight in
his misery. However, there was no need to give any orders in this
case , for their own savages, who were their scrvunts,dispntehcd these
poor creatures with their hatchcts.

At length thcy came in view of the place where the mo 5 misern.
blc remains of the savagcs' army lay, where there appear d about a
hundred still; their posture was generally sitting upon I w ground,
with their knees up toward their mouth, and the head I at between
the two hands, leaning down upon the knees.

When our men came within two musket-shots of tht n, the Span-
iard governor ordered two niusliots to be fired \t'ithuutl All, to alarm
them; this he did, that by their countenance he might ',-now what to
expect, viz, whether they were still in heartto fight, or more so heart-
il y beaten as to be dispiritcd and discouraged, and so he might man-
age accordingly. This stratagem took; for as soon as the savages
heard the first gun and saw the flash of the second they started up
upon their feet in the greatest consternation imagit .ble ; and as our
men advanced swiftly toward them, they all ran so coming and yell-
ing mmy, with a kind of howling noise, which on. men did not no.
dcrstand, and had never heard before ; and thus flip-j ran up the hills

into the country.
At first our men had much rather the weather had been calm. and

they had all gone away to sea ; but they did not then consider that
this might probably have been the occasion of their coming again in
such multitudes as not to be resisted, or, at least, to come so many,
and so often, as would quite desolate the island and starve them. Will
Atkins, therefore, who, notwithstanding his wound, kept always with
thmn, proved the best counsellor in this case; his advice was, to take
the advantage that Aim-Jed, and clap in between them and their boats,
and so deprive them of the capacity of ever returning any more to
plague the island.

'l'lwy consulted long about this; and some were against it, for fear
of making the wretchcs fly to the woods and live there, desperate,
and so they should have them to hunt like wild beasts, be afraid to
stir out about their business, and have their plantation continually
rifled, all their tame goats destroyed, and, in short, be reduced to a
life of continual distress.

Will Atkins told them they had better have to do with a. hundred
men than a hundred nations; that as they must destroy their boats.
so they must destroy the men, or be all of them destroyed themselves.
In a word, he showed them the necessity of it so plainly, that they
all came into it; so they went to work immediately with the hunts,
and getting some dry wood together from a dead tree, they tried to
set some of them on fire, but they were so wet they would not burn;
however, the lire so horned the upper part, that it soon made them
unfit for swimming in the sea as bouts. "'hen the lndians saw what
they were about, home of them came running out of the woods, and
coming as near as they could to our men. kneeled down and cried,
"0a, 0.1, \Vnramokoa," and some other Words of their language,
which none of the others understood anything of; but as they made
pitiful gestures and strange noiw'es, it was easy to understand they
Legged to luut'. their hoats spared, and they would hngnne, and never
come there again. But our men were now satisfied that they had
no way to prewrve the-.melves, or to save their colony, hut eli'ectu-
ally to prevent nny of these people from ever going home again; de-
pending upon this, that if even so much us one of them got back into
their country to tell the story, the colony was undone; so that letting
them know that. they rhould not have any mercy, they fell to work
with their canoes, and destroyed them every one that the storm had
not destroyed before ; at the sightof which the savageurnised a hideous
cry in the woods, which our people heard plain enough, after which
they run about the inland like distracted men ; so that, in a word. our
men did not really know at first what to do with them. Nor did the
Spaniards. with oil their prudence, consider, that while they made
those people thus desperate. they ought to have kept :1. good guard at
the some time upon their plantations; for though it is true, they had
driven awny their cattle, and the Indiana did not find out their main
retreat, l mean my old castle at the hill, nor the cave in the valley,
yet they found out my plantation at the howrr, and pulled it all to
Inieees, and all the timers and planting about it: trod all the corn on.
dnv foot, tore up the vines and grapes, being just then almost ripe,
and did our men an inestimahle damage, though to themselves not one
fitrthing's worth of service.

Though our men were able to fight them upon all occasions, yet
they were in no condition to pursue them, or hunt them up and down;
for as they were too nimhle of foot for our men. when they found
them single. so our men durst not go abroad single for fear of being
surrounded with their uumhers. The best was, they had no weapons;
for though they had hows, they had no arrows left, nor any materials
to make any, nor had they any edge tool or weapon among them.303131sz 036503. 827

The extremity and distress they were reduced to was great, and in-
deed. deplorable ; but at the some time, our men were illou brought to
very bad circumstances by them ; for though their retreats were pre-
served, yet their provision was destroyed, and their ham cef. spoiled
and what to do, or which way to turn themselves, they Luew not.
The only refuge they had now was, the stock of cattle they had in the
valley by the cave, and some little corn which grew there, and the
plantation of the three Englishmen, Will Atkins and his unnrndcs
who were now reduced to two; one of them being killed by an ar-
row, which struck him on the side of his head, just under the temples,
so that he never spoke more; and it was very remarkable, that this
was the same barbarous follow that cut the poor savage slave with
his hatchet, and who afterward intended to have murdered the
Spaniards.

I looked upon their case to have been worse at this time than mine
was at any time, after I first discovered the grains of barley and rice,
and got into the manner of planting and raising my corn, and my
tame cattle ; for now they had, as I may say, a hundred wolves upon
the island, which would devour everything they could come at, yet
could be hardly come at. themselves. .

When they saw what their circumstances were, the first thing they
concluded was, that they would, if possible, drive them up to the far-
ther part of the island, southwest, that if any more savages came on
shore they might not find one another: then they would daily hunt
and harass them, and kill us many of them as they could come at,
till they had reduced their number; and if they could at last tame
them, and bring them to anything, they would give them corn, and
teach them how to plant, and live upon their daily labor.

In order to do this,they so followed them and so terrified them with
their guns, that in a few days, if any of them fired a gun at an Indian,
if he did not hit him yet he would fall down for fear. and so dreadfully
tightened they were. that they kept out of sight farther and farther,
till at last, our men following them and almost every day killing or
wounding some of them, they kept up in the woods or hollow places
so much that it reduced them to the utmost. misery for want of food ;
and many were afterward found dead in the woods, without any hurt,
absolutely starved to death,

When our men thund this it made their hearts relent, and pity
moved them, especially the Spanish governor, who was the most gen-
tlemanliko, generous-minded man that I ever met with in my life,
and he proposed, if possible, to take one of them alive, and bring him328 onttx'rvmzs or

to understand what they tnenot, no for us to be able to not no inter-
preter, nnd go utuong them, and see if they might- he brought to some
conditions thut might he depended upon, to move their lives and do us
no harm.

It was some while lit-fore any of them could be taken ; hut. being
wool: nod hnlt' starved, one of them was nt 1.th Hurprieed and mode It
prisoner. He was eullen at first, and would neither ent not drink,
hut finding himboll' kindly used, und \'ictuula given him, and no vio-
lence offered him, he nt lust grew trnetnhlo and came to himself.
They brought old Friday to him, who tulked often with him, and told
him how kind the others would he to them oil; that they would not
only suve their lives, but would give them purl. of the blond to live
in, provided they would give satisfaction that they would keep in
their own hounds, and not come beyond it to injure or prejudice
others, and that they should have corn given them to plant and make
it grow for their hvend, and some hrend giver. them for their present
subsistence; nod old l-'ridny bode the fellow go nnd tnllt with the rest
efhis countrymen, nnd nee whet they said to it, ensuring them that if
they did not agree innnodiutely they should be ull destroyed.

The poor \vretehcs, thoroughly humbled, and reduced in number to
about thirty-seven, clmed with the proposnl nt the first idler, nod heg-
ged to have some food given them; upon which, twelve Sponiurdsond
two Englishmen. well united, with three iodine slaves and old Fri-
dny,murchcd to the place where they were. The three Indian eleven
carried them n large quantity of bread, some rice boiled up to coke:
and dried in the sun, and three live goutn; nnd they were ordered to
go to the side of n hill, where they mt, down, nte their provisions very
thankfully, and were the most faithful fellows to their words that
could he thought of, for. except when they come to beg victunle and
directions, they never come out of their hounds ; and there they lived
when I came to the island. and i went to see them.

They lmd taught them both to plant corn, mnlte breed, breed tame
gents, and milk them: they wnnted nothing hut wives, And they soon
would have been a nation. They were confined to nneck of land,
surrounded with high rocks behind them, nnd lying plain toward the
see before them, on the muthenst earner of the ielnnd. They had loud
enough, and it was very good nnd fruitful, about. a mile and a half
brood and three or four miles in length.

Our men taught them to make wooden spades, such as I made for
myself, and gave tunong them twelve hetehete and three or four
knives; and there they lived, the most subjected, innocent creeturee.
that ever were heard of.
After this the colony enjoyed s perfect tranquillity with respect to
the savages, till I cums t0 re-visit them, which was about two years
after ; not but that, now and then, some canoes of savages came on
shore for their triumphnl, unnatural feasts; but, as they were of sevo~
ral nations. and perhaps had never heard of those that came before,
or the reason of it, they did not make any search or inquiry after
their countrymen ; and if they had, it would have been very hard to
have found them out.

Thus, 1 think I have given a full account of all that happened to
them till my return, at least, that was worth notice. The Indians
or savages were wonderfully civilized by them, and they frequently
went among them, but forbade, on pain of death, any one of the In-
dians coming to them, because they would not have their settlement
betrayed again. One thing was very remarkable, viz., that they
taught the savages to make wicker-work, or baskets, but they soon
outdid their masters, for they made abundance of most ingenious
things in wicker-work, particularly all sorts of baskets, sieves, bird
cages, cupboards, etc, as also chairs to sit on. stools, beds, couches
and abundance of other things, being very ingenious at such work,
when they were once put in the way of it.

My coming was a particular relief to these people, because we fur-
nished them with knives, scissors, spades, shovels, piekaxes, and all
things of that kind which they could want. With the help of those
tools they were so very handy, that they come at last to build up
their huts or houses very handsomely, raddling or working it up like
basket-work, all the way round, which was a very extraordinary piece
of ingenuity, and looked very odd, but was an encoding good fence
as well against heat as against all sorts of vermin; and our men
were so taken with it that they got the wild savages to come and do
the like for them, so that when I came to see the two Englishmcn'l
colonies, they looked, at a distance, as if they all lived like bees in
a. hive. As for Will Atkins, who was now become a very industri-
Ous, useful, and sober fellow, he had made himself such a. tent of
basket-work, as, I believe, was never seen; it was one hundred and
twenty paces round on the outside, as I measured by my steps; the
walls were as close worked as a basket, in panels or squares of thirty-
twn in number, and very strong, standing about seven feet high: in
the middle was another, not above twenty-two paces round, but built
stronger, being octagon in its form, and in the eight earners stood
eight very strong posts, round the top of which he laid strong pieces,
twinned together with wooden pins, from which he raised a pyramid
for a roof of eight rafters, very hnndsonm, I assure you, and joined
together very well, though he haul no nails and only it t'uw iron spikes,
which hn nnnln hinm'lt', too, out. of the old irun that I left thurt'. : and,

. Such a piece of basket-work, I belioro, was never seen in tho
world, nor a house or tent so neatly contrived, much less so built. In
thin great bee-hive lived the three families. that in to say, Will Atkins
and his companion ; the third was killed, but his wife remained, with
three children, for she wen, it seems, hig with child when he died; and
the other two were not at all backward to give the widow her full
ehare of everything, I mean an to their corn, milk, grapen, &c., and
when they killed a kid, or found a turtle on the there; N) that they
all lived well enough; though it was true they were not soindustrieus
es the other two, as has been observed already.

One thing, however, cannot be omitted, viz, that, as for religion, I
do not know that there was anything of that. kind among them ; they
often, indeed, put. one another in mind that there was a God, by the
very mnumon method of seamen, vi'l.., swearing by his nnmc' nor
wrrc their poor ignorant savage wives much better for having been
married to Christians, as we must call them : for as they knew very
little oftiud themeelven. so they were utterly incapable of entering
into any discourne with their wives about a God, or to talk anything
to them concerning religion.

Tile utmost of all the im} rovement which I can my the wives had
made from them was, that they had taught them to speak English
pretty well; and most of their childtcn, which were near twenty in
all. were taught to speak English too, from their first, learning to
speak, though they et. first t-pvke it in a very hrolteu manner, like
their mothers. 'l'hcre wan none of these children elmve rix years
old when l t-ame thither, for it was not much above seven years that
they had fetvhcd these five savage ladies over; but they had all been
pretty fruitful, for they had all children, more or loss; I think the
cook's mate's wife was hip; of her sixth child ; and the mothers were
all a good sort of well-governed, qcict, laborious women, modest and
decent, helpful to one another, mighty cheer-vent nnd Fuhject to their
masters (l cannot call them husband>>), and wanted nothing hut. to be
well instructed in the Christian religion, and to he legally married;
both which were happily hrought about afterward by my means, or;
at least, in consequence of my coming among them.

_' AYXNG thus given an account of the colony in general, and
' . pretty much ol'my runagntu English] must say something
of the Spaniards, who were the main hotly of the family, and
in whom story there are some incidents also remarkable

 

enough.

i had a great many discourses with them ahout their circumstances
when they were among the savages. They told me readily that they
had no instances to gin) of their application or ingenuity in that
country ; that they were a poor. minerahll', dejected handful ofpeoplo;
that ifmeans had been put into their hands. yet they had so ahnn-
dolled thenmolves to dexpair, and so sunk under the weight of their
minfortunez, that they thought of nothing hut starring. One of them,
a grave and nonsilnle man, told me ho wax convinced they were in tho
wrong ; that it was not the part. of wise men to give tht'nmxlvcs up to
their misery, hut always to take hold of the helps whit-h reason
altered, as well for lll't'flt'lth support as for future lll'll\'('l'llllt'l: , he told
me that grit-f was the most. N'uueh-nn insignificant [\tlt-NiOII in the
world. for that it regarded only things past, which were generally
impossible to ho reealled, or to he. rmuedied, but had no \'iewaof
things to come, and had no share in anything that looked like deliver-
nnee. hut rather added tn the afilirtiun than proposed a remedy : and
upon this he repeated a Spanish proverb, which though i cannot re-
peatjust tlm same words that he spoke it in. yet I remember 1 undo
it into an English proverb of my own, thus:

In tmnh'e to he troubled,
It to have your troublu doubled.

He ran on then in remarks upon all the little improvement: I had
made in my solitude ; my unwearied application. as he called it; and
how I had made a condition whirh in its circumstances was at first
much worse than theirs, a tlnnmunl times more happy than theirs
was, even now when they were all together. He told me that it was
remarkahlo that Englishmen had a greater presence of mind, in their
distress, than any people that ever he met with ; that their unhappy
nation and the Portuguese were the worst men in the world to
struggle with misfortunes; for that. their first step in dangers, after
the counuou efl'orts were over, was to despair, lie down under it, and
die, without rousing their thoughts up to proper remedies for escape.

I told him their case and mine ditl'ered exceedingly ; that they were
cast upon the shore without necessaries, without supply of food, or
present sustenance till they could provide it; that it was true, I had
this disadvantage and discomfort, that l was alone ; but then the sup-
plies i had providentially thrown into my hands, by the unexpected
driving of the ship on shore, was such a help as would have en-
couraged any creature in the world to have applied himself as I had
done. "Senhor." says the Spaniard, " had we poor Spaniards been
in your case, we should never have got half these things out of the
ship, as you did; nay," says he, " we should never hare found
means to have got a raft to carry them, or to have got the raft on
shore without heat. or sail ; and how much less should we have done
ifauy of us had been alone i" Well, i desired hnn to abate his cum-
pliment, and go on with the history of their coming on shore, where
they landed. He told me they unhappily landed at a place where
there were people without provisions; whereas, had they the common
sense to have put off to sea again, and gone to another island a little
further, they had found provisions, though without. people; there
being an island that way, as they had heen told, where there were
provisions, though no people; that is to say, that the Spaniards of
Trinidad had frequently been there, and had filled the island with
goats and hogs at several times, where they had bred in such multi-
tude>>, and where turtle and seafowls were in such plenty. that they
could have been in no want of flesh, though they had found no hrced;
whereas, here, they were only sustained with a few roots and herbs,
which they understood not, and which had no suhstance in them, and
which the inhabitants gave them sparingly enough _: and who could
treat them no better, unless they would turn cannibals, and eat men's
flesh, which was the great dainty of their country.

They gave me an account how many ways they strove to cit'iiiLO
the savages they were with, and to teach them rational customs in
the ordinary way of living, hut in rain; and how they retorted it
upon them, as unjust, that they, who come there for assistance and
support, should attempt to set up for instructors of those that. gave
them food; intimating. it seems, that none should set up for the iu-
struetors of others, but those who could live without them.

They gave me dismal accounts of the extremities they were driven
to ; how sometimes they were many days without any food at all, the
island they were upon being inhabited by a sort of savages that, li\ ed
morn indolent, and for that. reason were less supplied with the neees-
saries of life. than they had reason to helium others were in the same
partnf the World; and yet they l'ound that. these savages were les.
ravenous and \orueious than those who had better mpplies of food
Also they added, they could not but bee \\ ith what. deinotmtrntiotm of
wisdom and gotulm-rs the gnu-mint; prmidenee of (ind directs the
events ot~ things in the world: "hieh. they said, nppeared in their
eireutnstauees; for if. pressed by the hardships they were. under. and
harrenness ol' the. eunntry where. they were, they had searched after
tt better to live. in, they had then been out of the way of the relief
that. happened to them hy in) means.

They then gave me an neeonnt how the. savages whom they lived
among expected them to go out. "ill! thent intn their wars; and, it
was true, that as they had firearms with them, had tln y nnt had the
disaster to lose their ammunitinn, they should l;:l\ e been net-\'ieeahlo
not only to their friends' l.ut. have made. themseltes terril-le lnnth to
friends and enemies: hut. being without. powder and shut, and yet in
a condition that they eonl-l not in reason deny to go out with lb 'ir
landlords to their wars, to when they tame into the. field of battle,
they were in a worse enndition than the. savages themselxes: for they
had neither hows nor arrows, nor enuld they use these. the savages
gave. them : so they enuld do nothing but stand still, and he unnuded
with arruws. till they extine up to the teeth nl'tlzeir enemy: and then,
indeed. the. three balberds they had were. of use to them; and they
would often drive a whole littlo army belirre them with those. lialberds,
and sharpened stir-ks put into the nmzzles of their inusltets: but that,
for all this, they \\ ere. sometimes Mtrrounded with multitudes, and in
great danger from their nrrnws. till at. last. they found the way to
make themselves large. targets of wood. whieh they envered with skins
of wild heasts'. whose names they knew not, n.2d thuse eorered them
from the arrows of the saw-gen: yet, notwithstamling these, they were
sometimes in great danger: and liH' of them were. (men kllfit'l-it'tl down
together with the. eluba ol' the savages. "llit'll was the time when nun
of them was taken prisoner, that is to say, the Spaniard whom I had
relieved: that- at. first they thought he had lneen killed; but. when
they afterward heard he was taken prisnner, they were. under the
greatest; grief inntginahle. and would willingly have all ventured
their lives to have rescued him.

They told me that when they were so knocked down, the rest of
their company rescued them, and stood over them fighting till they
were come to themselves, all hot him who they thought. had been
dead; and then they made their way with their halberds and pieces,
standing clone together in a line, through a body of ahove n thousand
savages, beating down all that came in their way, get the victory over
their enemies, hut to their great sorrow, hecaurse it was with the his>>;
of their friend, whom the other party, finding him alive, carried off,
with some others, as I gave an account before.

They descrihed most. atl'cctionatt-ly how they were surprised with
joy at the return of their friend and companion in misery, who, they
thought, lliltl heen devoured by wild hea>ts of the worst hind= vi7.., hy
wild men; and yet how more and more they were surprised with the
account. he gme them of his errand, and that there was a. Chri>tian in
any place near, iztllt'll more one that was tilde, and had hmnanity
enough, to nontrihnte to their deliverance.

They deserilmd how they were astonished at the sight of the relief
I sent them, and at the appearance t-l'loaves of bread, things they
had not- M-en since their running to that. miserable place: how often
they crossed it and him-axed it as bread rent from Heaven; and what a.
reviving cordial itwas to their spirits to taste it, as also the other
things I had sent. for their rnpply; and, after all, they would have
told me something of the joy they were in at the sight. of a. heat and
pilotu, to carry them away to the person and plaec from whence all
these new eomfnrte come, hut it was impossible to express it hy words,
for their excessive joy naturally driving them to unbecoming ex-
travaganees, they Izod no way to deserihe them, but hy telling me
they bordered upon lunacy. having no way to give vent to their pas-
sions suitahle to the sense that was upon them; that in some it
worked one way, and in some another; and that FOI'HO of them,
tln-ongh a surprise ofjoy, would burst. into team-x, others he stark mad,
and others immediately faint. This discourse extremely affected me,
and called to my mind Friday's eestacy when he met his father, and
the poor people's eestucy when I took them up at sea after their ship
was on fire; the joy of the mate of the ship when he timed himself
delivered in the plat-e. where he expected to perish; and my own joy,
when, after twenty-eight years' captivity. I found a. good ship ready
to carry me to my own country. All these things made me more
sensihle of the relation of these poor men, and more afi'eeted with it.

Having thus given a view of the state of things an I found them. I
must: relate the heads of what I (lid for these people, and the condi-
tion in which I left them. It was their opinion, and mine, too, that1

they would be troubled no more with the savages, or, if they were,
they would be able to cut them 01?, if they were twice as nnmy an be-
fore; so they had no concern about that. Then I entered into a
serious discourse with the Spaniard, whom I call governor, alout
their stay in the island; for as I was not Come to carry any of them
off, so it would not be just to carry oll' some and leave others, who,
perhaps, would be unwilling to stay if their strength was diminished.
0n the other hand. I told them I came to establish them there, not to
remove them: and then I let them know that I had brought with me
relief of sundry kinda for them : that. I had boon at a great charge to
supply theta with all things necessary. as well for their convenience
as their defence; and that I had such and such particular persons
with me, as well to increase and recruit their munbcr, as by the par-
ticular necessary cmployments which they were bred to, being artifi-
cers, to :L'sainl, them in those things in which at present they were in
Want.

They were altogether when I talked thus to them; and before I de-
lirered to them the stores I had brought, I asked tin-m, one by one,
if they had entirely tin'got and buried the first animmities that had
been among them, and would shake hands with one another, and
engage in a strict friendship and union of interest, that so there might
be no more misunderstandinga and jealousit-s.

Will Atkins, with abundance of frankness and good humor, said
they had met with afflict-ion enough to make them all sober, and one.
mics enough to make them all friends; that, for his part, he would
live and die with them: and was so far from designing anything
against the Spaniards, that he owned they had done nothing to him
but what his own mad humor made necessary, and what he would
have done, and perhaps worse, in their case; and that he would ask
them pardon, if I desired it, for the foolish and hrutish things he had
done to them, and was very willing and desirous of living in term-
of entire friendship and union with them, and would do anything
that lay in his power to convince them of it: and as for going to
England, he cared not if he did not. go thither these twenty years.

The Spaniards said they had, indeed, at first. disarined and excluded
'Will Atkins and his two canntrynu-n for their ill conduct, as they had
let me know, and they appealed to me for the necessity they were
under to do so, hut. that Will Atkins had behaved himself so bravely
in the great fight they had with the savages, and on several occasions
since, and had showed himself so faithful to, and concerned for, the
general interest of them all, that they had forgotten all that was past,
and thought he merited as much to be trusted with arms and supplied
with necessaries as any of them ; and they had testified their satisfac-
tion in him by committing the command to him, next to the governor
himself; and am they had eutirc confidence in him, and all his coon-
trymen, so they acknowledged they had merited that confidence i-y
all the methods that honest men could merit to be valued and trusted,
and they most heartily embraced the occasion of giving me this assu-
rnnce, that they would never have any interest separate from one an-
other.

L'pon these frank and open declarations of friendship, we appointed
the next day to dine all together, and, indeed, we made a splendid
feast. I caused tlzo ship's cook and his mate to come on shore and
dress our dinner, and the old cook's mute we had on shore assisted.
We brought on shore six pieces of good hoof, and four pieces of pork
out of the ship's provision, with our punch-howl, and materials to fill
it; and, in particular, 1 gave them ten bottles of French claret, and
ten bottles of English beer--things that neither the Spaniards nor the
English luul tustcd for many years, and which, it may be supposed,
they were very glad of. The Spaniards added to our feast five whole
kids, which the cooks roasted ; and three of them were sent, covered
up close, on heard the ship to the seamen, that they might feast on.
fresh meat from on shore, us we did with their salt meat from on
hoard. '

After this feast, at which we were very innocently merry, I brought
out my cargo of goods. ""herein that there might he no dispute
about dividing, I showed them that there was a. sufficiency for them
all. desiring that they might all take an equal quantity of the goods
that were for Wearing, that is to say. equal when made up: as, first,
I distributed linen sufficient to make every one of them four shirts,
and, at the Spaniard's request, afterward made them up to six. These
were exceedingly comfortable to them, having heen what, as I may
say, they had long since forgot the use of, or what it was to wear
them. I allotted the English thin stufi's, which I mentioned hefore,
to make every one a light coat like a frock, which I judged fittest for
the heat of the season, cool and loose. and ordered that whenever they
decayed they should make more, as they thought fit. The like for
pumps, shoes, stockings, hats, etc.

I cannot express what pleasure, what satisfaction, sat upon the
countenances of all these poor men, when they saw the careI had
taken of them, and how well I had furnished them. They told me I
was n father to them, and that, having such a correspondent u I we!
in so remote a part of the world, it would make them forget that they
were left in a desolate place ; and they all voluntarily engaged to me
not to leave the place without my consent.

Then I presented to them the people I had brought with me, par-
ticularly the tailor, the Bmith, and the two carpenters, all of them
most noeewtry people; but, above all. my general artitieer, than
whom they could not name anything that was more useful to them.
And the tailor, to show his concern for them, went to work imme~
diately, and, with my leave, made them every one a shirt, the first
thing he did; and, which was still more, he taught the women not
only how to new and stitch, and use the needle, but made them assist
to make the shirts for their husbands and for all the rest.

As to the carpenters, I scarce need mention how useful they
were, for they limit to pieces all my clumsy, nnhandy things, and
made them clever, convenient tahles. stools, liedsteads, cupboa. ds,
lockers, shelves, and everything they wanted of that kind. But, to
let them see how nature made artificcrs, at. first I carried the t'tlt'llt'll-
101' to see "'ill Atkins's basket-house, as I called it, and they hoth
owned they never saw an instance of such natural ingenuity before,
nor anything so regular and so handily built, at least of its kind ; and
one of them, when he saw it, after musing ageod while, turning
uhout. to me. "I am sure," says he, "that man has no need of us; ~vou
need do nothing hut give him tools.

Then I brought them out. all my store of tools, and gave every man
a digging spade, a shovel, and a rake, for we had no harran or
plougha, and to every separate place a pickaxe, a crow, a hrondaxo,
and a saw: always appointing that as often as any were broken or
worn out, they should he sum'ilied, without grudging, out ofthe gene-
ral stores that I left behind. Nails, staples, hinges, hammers, chi-sols,
knives, Scissors. and all sorts of iron-work, they had without tale, as
they required : for no man would take more than he wanted, and he
must he a fut'l that would wnato or spoil them on any net-omit what-
ever: and, for the use of the smith, 1 left two tons of uuwrough: iron
for a Supply.

My magazine of'ymvder and firms which I brought them was such,
own to profusion, that they could not but rejoice at. them; for now
they could march as I used to do, with a musket upon each shoulder,
if there was occasion, and were able to fight a thousand savages, if
they had but some little advantages of situation, which, also, they
could not miss. ifthey had occasion.

I carried on shore with me the young man whose mother was
Itarved to death, and the maid, also. She was a sober, well educa-
ted, religious young woman, and behaved so inoll'ensively that every
One gave her a good word. She had, indeed, an unhappy life with us,
there being no woman in the ship but. herself, but bhe bore it with
patience. After a while, seeing things so Well ordered, and in [:0 fine
a way of thriving upon my island, and considering that they had nei-
ther business nor acquaintance in the East. Indies, or reason for taking
so long a voyage; I say, considering all this, both of them came to
me, and desired I would give them leave to remain on the island, and
he entered among my family, as they called it. I agreed to this
readily; and they had a little plot of ground allotted to them, where
they had three teats or houses set up, surrounded with a basket-work,
palisadoed like Atlziue's, adjoining to his Idantatiun. Their tents were
contrived N) that they had each of them a room apart to lodge in, and
a middle tent, like a great store-house, to lay their goods in, and to
eat and drink in. And now he other two Englishmen removed their
habitation to the some ldacc; and so the island was divided into three
colonies, and no more, via, the Spaniards, with old Friday and the
first servants, at my old hahitation under the hill--which was, in a
word, the capital city--and where they had so enlarged and extended
their works, as well under as on the outside of the hill, that they lived
though perfectly concealed: yet full at large. Kever was there such
a little city in a wood, and so hid, in any part of the world; for I
verily believe a thousand men might- liave ranged the ialanda month,
and, if they had not known there was such a thing, and looked on
purpose for it, they would not have found it; for the trees steed so
thick and so close, and grew so fast woven one into another, that
nothing but cutting them down first could discover the place, except the
only two narrow entrances where they went in and out. couldhe found,
which was not very easy. One of them was close down at the water's
edge, on the side of the creek, and it was afterward about two hun-
dred yards to the place ; and the other was up a ladder at twice, as I
have already formally descril-ed it. And they had, also,a large wood
thick planted on the top of the hill, containing above an acre, which
grew ounce, and concealed the place from all discovery there, with
only one narrow place between two trees, not easily to he discovered,
to enter on that side.

he other colony was that of "'il'. Atkins, where there were four
families of Englishmen, I mean those I had leflt there, with their wives
and children: three savages that were slams; the widow and the
children of the Englishman that. was killed ; the young man and the
maid ; and, by the way, we made a wife of her before we went away.
There wnaalso the two carpenters and thc tailor, whom I brought
with me for them; also the smith, who was a. very necessary man to
them, especially as a gunsmith, to take care of their arms; and my
other man, whom I called Juck-of-ull-trades, who was, in himself, as
good almost. as twenty men; for he was not only a very ingenious
fellow, but a very merry fellow ; and before I went away we nuu'ried
him to the honest maid that came with the youth in the ship I men-
tioned before.

And now 1 spool: of marrying, it brings me naturally to say some-
thing of the French eeclesiastie that I had brought with me out of
the ship's crew whom I took up at ten. It is true this man was a
Roman, and perhaps it may give oli'eneo to some hereafter, if I leave
anything extraordinary upon record of a man whom, before I began:
I must (to set him out in just colon>>) )'eprt'fl'xfl in terms very much to
his disadvantage, in the account of Pro!>> iii-st, that ho was a
Papist ; normally, a l'opish priort; and thirdly. a. French l'opish priest,
Bat justice demands of me to give him a due character; and I must
say, he was a grave, sober, pious, and most religious person; exact in
his life, exiensne in his charity, and exemplary in almost everything
he did. What then can any one. say against being very sensible of
the value of suvh a man, notwithrtamling his profession? though it.
may be my opinion, perhaps, as well as the opinion of others who shall
read this, that he was mistaken.

The first hour that I began to converse with him utter-he had agreed
to go with me to the East Indies, 1 found reason to delight. exceed-
ingly in his conversation ; and he first began with me about religion,
in the most, obliging manner imaginable. "Sir," said be, "you have not,
only under God" (and at that he crossed his breast) "saved mylife, but
you hav' admitted me to go this voyage in year ship, and by your
obliging civility have taken me. into your family, giving me an oppor-
tunity of free conversation. Now, r, you see by my habit what my
profession is. and I guess. by your nation. what yours is; i may think
it is my duly. and doubtless it is so. to use my utmost endeavors on ail
occasions, to bring all the souls l can to the km'nvledge ol' the truth,
and to omhaaee the Catholic doctrine: but as I am here under your
permission. and in your family,l nm bound. in justice to your kind-
ness. as wall as in decency and gnod manners, to be. under your por-
ornment: and, therefore] shall not, without your leave, enter into
any debate on the points of religion in which we may not agree, fur
ther than you shall give me leave.
I told him his carriage was so modest, that I could not but no-
knowlcdgo it ; that it was true, we were such people as they called her-
etics, but that he was not the first Catholic I had converscd with with-
out falling into inconveniences, or carrying the questions to any
height in debate ; that he should not find himself the worse used for
being of a different opinion from us; and if we did not converse with'
out any dislike on either side, it should be his fault, not ours.

lie replied, that he thought all our conversation might be easily
separated from disputes; that it was not his business to cap principles
with every man he conversed with 5 and that be rather desired me to
converse with him as a. gentleman than as a rcligionist ; and that,
il' I would give him leave, at any time, to discourse upon religious
subjects, he would readily comply with it, and that he did not doubt
but I would allow him to defend his own opinions as well as he could;
but that, without my leave, he would not break in upon me with any
such thing. He told me farther, that he would not cease to do all
that became him, in his office as a priest as well as aprivate Christian,
to procure the good of the ship, and the safety of all that was in her,
and though, perhaps, we would notjein with him,and he could not pray
with us, he hoped he might pray for us, which he would do upon all
occasions. In this manner we conversed; and, as he was of the most
obligiug gentleman-like behavior, so he was, if I may be allowed to
any so, a man of good sense, and, as I helieve, of great learning.

He gave me a most diverting account of his life, and of the many
extraordinary events of it; of many adventures which had befallcn
him in the few years that he had been abroad in the world; and par-
ticularly this was very remarkable, viz., that in the voyage he was
now engaged in, he had the misfortune to be five times shipped and
unshippcd, and never to go to the place whither any of the ships he
was in were at first designed. That his first intent was to have gone
to Martinieo, and that he went on board a ship bound thither at St.
Male; but being forced into Lisbon, by bad weather, the ship rcCeived
some damage by running aground in the mouth of the river Togas,
and was obliged to unload her cargo there; but finding a Portuguese
ship there hound to the Madeirns, and ready to sail, and supposing he
should easily meet with a vessel there, bound to Martinico, he went
on heard, in order to sail to the Madeiras: but the master of the Por-
tuguese ship, being hut an indifi'erent mariner, had been out of his
reckoning. and they droro to Fayal ; where= however, he happened to
find a very good market for his cargo, which was corn, and therefore
resolved not to go to the Madeiras, butto load salt at the isle of May,
and to go away to Newfoundland. 110 had no remedy in this cxi.
genre hut to go with the ship, and had a. pretty good "game as fat- as
the banks (N) they call the place where they catch the 1351.); where,
nwuting with a l'rvmh ship bound from France to Quebec, in the ink or
of Canada, and from thence to Martinico, to carry provisions, he
thought he slmnld have an opportunity to cutnlvletc his first (It-sign;

C/V- farthest part. of the island ; I say, he came to int', and told
lttt'. with a wry grave cultutunam'o: that he. had fur two or thrm days
desirvd an opportunity t-l' some discourse with mo, whirh= he hoped,
would not he displt'asing to me, hccansv, he thought, it might in some
nwasuro corroslmnd with my gonoral design, which was the prosper-
ity of my new colony, and, perhaps, might put it, at. least. more than
he thought, it. was, in the way of (iou's bh-ssing.

I looked alittlo surprised at. tho. last pan ofhis discourse, and turn-
ing 0. Univ short. "How, sir." said I, " can it he raid that. we are not
in the way ni' God's hit-ssing. after such \'isihlo nssistancos and won-
derful dolivet'anve's as we have seen hora, and of which I have given
you alarge account?" "If you had pleased, sir," said he, with a
world of modesty, and yet with grout. readiness, " to have heard me,
you would have found no room to be displeased, much less to think
so hard of me, that I should suggest that you have not had wonderful
assistanccs and deliverances ; and I hope, on your behalf, that you are
in the way of God's blessing, as your design is exceedingly good, and
will prosper ; but, sir, though it were more so than is even possible to
you, yet there may be some among you that are not equally right in
their actions; and you know, that in the story of the children of Is-
rael, one Achan in the camp removed God's blessing from them, and
turned his hand so against them, that six~and~thirty of them, though
not concerned in the crime, were the objects of Divine vengeance, and
bore the weight of that punishment." .

I was sensibly touched with his discourse, and told him his in-
ference was no just, and the whole design seemed so sincere, and was
really so religious in its own nature, that I was very sorry I had in-
terrupted him, and begged him to go on ; and in the meantime, he-
canse it seemed that what we had both to say might take up some time,
I told him 1 w: 5' going to the I-Inglishmen-'s plantations, and asked him
to go with me, and we might discourse of it by the way. He told me
he would the more willingly wait. on me thither, because there partly
the thing was arted which he desired to speak to me about; So we
walked on, and I pressed him to be free and plain with me in what
he had to say.

" Why then, sir," said he, "be pleased to give me leave to lay
down a few prepositions, as the foundation to what I have to say, that
we may not diti'er in the general principles, though we may he of
some differing opinions in the practice of particulars. First, sir,
though we differ in some of the doctrinal articles of religion, and it is
very unhappy it is so,especially in the case before us, as I shall show
afterward, yet there are some general principles in which we both
agree, viz; that there is a God; and that this God having given us
some stated general rules for our service and obedience, we ought not
willingly and knowingly to offend him, either by neglecting to do
what he has commanded. or lay doing what he has expressly for-
bidden; and let our difl'erent religions be what they.r will, this general
principle is read ly owned by all, t .nt the blessing of God does not
ordinarily follow presumptuous shining against his command; and
every good Christian will be afi'eetionately concerned to prevent any
that are under his care living in <<total neglect of God and his com-
mands. It is not your men being Protestants, whatever my opinion
may be of such, that discharges me from being concerned for their souls.
and from endeavoring, if it lies before me, that they should live in u

o844 ammonia or

little distance from enmity with their Maker as possible, especially, if
you give me leave to meddle so for in your circuit."

l Could not yet imagine what he aimed at, and told him I granted
all he had said, and thanked him that he would so far concern himself
for us ; and hugged he would explain the particulars of what he had
observed, that, like J onhua, to take his own parable, I might put away
the aeeursed thing from us.

"Why then, sir," says he, "I will talto the liherty you give me;
nnd there are three things, which, il~ 1 not right, must atand in the
way of God'a blessing upon your endeavors here, and which 1 ehould
rejoice, for your sake, and their own, to see removed; and, sir,I
promiao myselfthnt you will fully agree with me in them all, as soon
as I name them; especially because 1 shail convince you that every
one of them may, with great. ease, and very much to your Salish

be remedied. First, air," says he. " you have here four l'lny,

who have fetched women from among the savages, and have taken
them as their wives, and have had manyehildren by them all. and yet
are not- married to tlzvm after any stated legal manner, as the lmvsof
God and man require; and therefore are yet, in the sense ol'lmtlnno
less than l'ornicators, il'not living in adultery. To this, air, 1 ltnow
you will object that there was no clergyman or priest. ofany kind, or
of any profession, to perform the ceremony ; nor any pen and llzlt, or
paper, to write down a contract of montage. and have it signed he-
tween them: and I know, also, sir, what the Spaniard governor has
told you, l moan,of the agreem'nt that he obliged them to make
wht-n they took those women, viz. : that they should choose them out
by consent, and keep separately to them, which, by the way, is
nothing of a marriage, no ngremnent with the Women, as wives. but
only an agreement among themselves, to keep them from quarreiling.

Int. sir, the essence of the sacrament of matrimony (so he called it,
being a Roman) consists not only in the mutual consent ofthe parties
to take one another as man and wife, but in the formal and legal obli-
gation that there is in the contract, to compel the man and woman,
at all times to own and acknowledge each other ; obliging the man to ah.
stztiu from all other women, to engage in no other contract while
these subsist, and, on all occasions, as ability allows, to provide
honestly for them and their children: and to oblige the women to the
some, or like conditions, mttlalis mutandis, on their side. Now, sir,"
says he, " these men may, when they [item-e, or when occasion pre-
Ients, abandon these women, disown their children, leave them to
perish, and take other women, and marry them while these or.-,.-{,:=_-,~:ts-v:~::.ul.--

living ;" and here he added, with some warmth, "how, sir, is God
honored in this unlawful liberty? and how rhall a blessing succeed
your endeavors in this place, however good in themselves, and how-
ever sincere in your design, while these men, who at present are your
subjects, under your absolute government and dominion, are allowed
by you to livein open adultery 'I"

I confess] was struck with the thing itself, but much more with the
convincing arguments he supported it with ; for it was certainly true,
that though they had no clergyman upon the spot, yet a formal con-
tract on both sides, made before witnesses and confirmed by any
token which they had all agreed to be bound by, though it had been
but breaking a stick between them, engaging the men to own these
wmnen for their wives upon all occasions, and never to abandon them
or their children, and the women to the some with their husbands,
had been an effectual lawful marriage in the sight of God ; and it was
a great neglect that it was not done. But I thought to have got 012
my young priest by telling him that all that part was done when I
was not here; and they had lived so many years with thorn now, that
if it was adultery, it was part remedy; they could do nothing in it
llO'V.

" Sir," says he, " asking your pardon for such freedom, you are
right in this, that, it being done in your absence, you could not he
charged with that part of the crime; but, I beseech yon, flatter not
yourself that you} are not therefore under an obligation to do your
utmost now to put an end to it. How can you think but that. let the
time past lie on whom it will, all the guilt, for the future, will lie en-
tirely upon you? because it is certainly in your power now to put an
end to it, and in nobody's power but yours."

I was so dull still, that I did not take him right; but I imagined
that, by putting an end to it, he meant that I should part them, and
not. to suffer them to live together any longer; and I said to him I
could not do that, by any means, for that it would put the whole
island into confusion. He seemed surprised that I should so far mis-
take him. " No, sir," says he, " I do not. mean that you should now
separate them, but legally and effectually marry them now 3. and as,
sir, my way of marrying them may not be easy to reconcile them to,
though it will be effectual by your own laws. so your way may be as
well before God, and as valid among men : I mean, by a written con-
tract signed by both man and woman, and by all witnesses present,
which all the laws of Europe would decree to be valid.

I was amazed to use so much true piety, and so much sincerity of

I could hold no longer; I took him in my arms, and embraced him
\I'llll an exceua of passion. " How far," said 1 to him, " have I been
trum understanding the most essential part. of a. Christian? via, to
love the interest of the Christian church, and the good of other men's
souls: I scarce have known what belongs to the being of a Christian."
' 0, air, do not say so," replied he; " this thing is not your fault."
Y= No," said I ; " but why did I never lay it to heart as well as you i"
"It is not too late yet," said he; "be not too forward to condemn
yourself." "But what can be done now 7" said I; "you see I am
going away." "Will you give me leave to talk with these poor men
about. it t" " Yes, with all my heart," said I z " and will oblige them
to give heed to what. ycu say, too." " As to that," said he, " we must
leave them to the mercy of Christ; but it is your business to assist
thmn, encourage them, and instruct them; and if you give me leave,
and God his blessing, I do not doubt but the peer ignorant souls shall
he brought home to the great circle of Christianity, if not into the
particular faith we all embrace, and that even while you stay here."
Upon this I said, "I shall not only give you leave, but give you a
thousand thanks for it." \Vhat followed on thin account I shall men-
(ion also again in its place.

I new pressed him for the third article in which we were to blame.
'-' Why, really," says he, " it is of the same nature; and I will proceed,
asking your leave, with the same I'nlainness us before ; it is uhout your
poor savages, who are, as I may say, your conquered subjects. It is
a maxim, sir, that is, or ought to he, received among all Christians,
ot' what. church or pretended church soever, viz., The Christian knowlo
edge ought to be propagated by all possible means, and upon all pos--
sible occasions. It is onthis principle that our church sends mis-
sionaries into Persia, India, China; and that. our clergy, even of the
superior sort, willingly engage in the most hazardous voyages, and
most dangerous residence among murderers and barbarians, to teach
them the knowledge of the true God, and to bring them over to em.
brace the Christian faith. New, sir, you have such an opportunity
here to have six or seven and thirty poor savages brought over from
idolatry to the knowledge of God, their Maker and Redeemer, that I
wonder how )ou can past; such an occasion of doing good, which is
really worth the expense of a man's whole life."

I was now struck dumb, indeed, and had not one word to any. I
had here a. spirit of true Christian zeal for God and religion before
me. let his particular principles he of what, kind soever: as for me, I
had not so much as entertained a thought of this in my heart before.
and I believe I should not have thought of it; for I looked upon
these savages as slaves, and people whom, had we any work for them
to do, we would have used as such, or would have been glad to have
transported them to any other part of the world: for our business
was to get rid of them; and we would all have been satisfied if they
had been sent to any country, so they had never seen their own. But
to the ease :--I say, I was confounded at his discourse, and knew not
what answer to make him.

110 looked earnestly at me, seeing me in some disorder--" Sir,' says
he, " I shall be very aorry if what I have said given you any ofl'ence."
" No, no," said I, "I am oil'ended with nobody but- inyselt'; but I am
perfectly confimndod, not only to think that I should never take any
notice of this bofiire, but with reflecting what notice I am able to take
of it now. You know, sir," said I, " what circumstances I am in ; I
ma bound to the East Indies in a ship freighted by merchants, and to
whom it would be an insufl'erable piece of injustice to detain their
ship here, the. men lying all this while at victunls and wages on the
owners' account. It is trne,I agreed to be allowed twelve days here,
and if 1 slay more, I must pay three pounds sterling per dicm
(lemma-age; nor can l stay upon demurrage above eight days more,
and I have been here thirteen already 2 so that I am perfectly unable
to engage in this work, unless I would sailor myself to he left behind
here again; in nbieh case, if this single bbip should misearry in any
p' -t of her voyage. l rhonld be just in the szune condition that l was
left in here, at first, and from whit-h I have been so wonderfully (le-
livered." He owned the case was very hard upon me. as to my
voyage; but laid it home upon my ('omiriemre, whether the blessing
of eating thirtymcven souls was not worth venturing all I had in the
world for. I was not so sensible of that. as be was. I returned upon
him thus: " Why, sir, it is a valuable thing, indeed, to be an instru-
ment in God's hand to convert thirty-seven beathena to the knowledge
of Christ; bur. as you are an ecclesiastie. and are given over to the
work, so that it seems so naturally to fall into the way of your l'm'
fro-ion. how is it then that you do not rather ofi'er yourself to under-
take it, than press me to do it?"

['pon this he faced about just before me, as he walked along, and
putting me to a full stop, made me a very low how. "I most heartily
thank God, and you sir," said he, " for giving me so evident a call to
so blessed a work; and if you think yourself discharged from it,
and desire me to undertake it, I will most readily do it, and think its.
happy reward for all the hazards and difficulties of such abroken
disappointed voyage MI have met with, that I am dropped at last
into so glorious a work."

1diseovered a kind of rapture in his face while he spoke this to
me; his eye sparkled like fire, his face glowed, and his color came and
went, us if he had been falling into tits; in a word, he was fired with
the joy of being embarked in such a work. I paused a considerable
while before I could tell whut to my to him; for 1 was really sur-
prised to tind a man 'of such sincerity and zeal, and carried out in his
zeal beyond the ordinary rate of men, not of his profession only, but
even of any profession whatsoever. But after I had considered it
awhile, I asked him seriously if he was in earnest, and that he would
venture, on the single consideration of an attempt on those poor peo-
ple, to be locked up in an implanted island for perhaps his life, and
at. last might not know whether he should be able to do them good
or not.

He turned short upon me, and asked me what I called a venture.
" Pray, sir," said he, " what do you think I consented to go in your
ship to the East Indies for Y" " Nay," said I, " thatl know not unless
it was to preach to the Indians." " Douhtlcss it was," said he ; " and
do you think, if I can convert these thirty-seven men to the faith of
J esus Christ, it is not worth my time, though I should never be fetched
oil' the island again 2 Nay, is it not infinitely of more worth to sure
so many souls than my life is, or the life of twenty more of the same
profession 2 Yes, sir," says he, " I would give Christ and the hlessed
Virgin thanks all my days, if I could he made the least. happy instru-
ment of saving the souls of those poor men, though I were never to
set my foot ofi' this island, or see my native country any more.
But. since you will honor me with putting me into this work. for which
I will pray for you all the days of my life, I have one humble peti-
tion to you besides." " What. is that 7" said I. " "'hy," says he,
" it is, that you will leave your man Friday with me, to he my inter.
{motor to them, and to assist me; for without some help I cannot
Speak to them, or they to me."

I was sensibly touched at his requesting Friday, because I could not
think of parting with him, and that for many reasons: he had been
the c-nnpaninu of my travels; he was not only faithful to me, Lut
sincerely afl'ectionate to the last degree; and Ihad resolved to do
something considerable for him if he outlived me, as it was probable
he would. Then I knew, that. as I had bred Friday up to he a Protes-
tant, it would quite confound him to bring him to embrace another
profession; and he would never, while his eyes were open, believe350 AD\'l-2NT!'I:IPSS or

that his old master was a. herctie, and would be damned; and this
might. in the. end, ruin the poor t'cllow's principles, and so turn him
haul; again to his first idolntry. However, a. sudden thought, relieved
me. in this strait, and it; wax this: I told him, " I could not. say that I
was willing to part with Friday on any account whatever, though :5
work that, to him, was of more value than his life, ought to he of
much more value than the keeping or parting of u, servant. But, on
the other hand, I was persuaded that- h'ridny would hy no menus agree
to part with me; nndI could not. three. him to it without his con-
sent, without. manit'erl. injustiee; lueenu>e I had promised I would
never put. him away, and he had promised und engaged. to me that. he
would never leave. me unlesa I put him away."

lle seemed very mueh eoneerned at it, for he had no rational access
to these poor people, seeing he did not. understand one, word of their
language, nor they one word of his. 'l'o rumme this dillieulty, I told
him " Friday's father had learned Spanish, which 1 found he also un-
(lt'rsttmtl' and he should serve him as an interpreter." So he was
much better satisfied, and nothing could persuade him hut he would
stay and endeavor to convertthem; but Providence gore another very
happy turn to all this.

I come. hack now totho first. part of his olvjeetions. When we came
to the Englishmen, I sent for them altogether, and after some tit-count
given them of what. 1 had done for them, viz... what necessary thingal
had provided for them, and how they were distributed, \vhieh they
were sensil-le of, and very thankful for, I began to talk to them of
the very sennthilnus life they led: and gave them a full account. ofthe
"mine the clergyuinu had taken of it>>: and arguing how unchristian
and irreligious at life it was, I tirrt asked them if they were nmrricd
men or luaehelovs ? They soon explained their condition to me, and
showed that. two of them were widowers, and the other three were
single, men or bachelors. l fished them with what Conscience they
could take these. women. and lie with them as the}r had done, "all
them their wives. and have so many children hy them, and not be
lawfully mrrried to them ?

They all gave. me the. answer I expected, riz., that there was nobody
to marry them : that they agreed. before the, governor, to keep them
us their wives, and to maintain them and own them as their wives
and they thought, as things stand with then), they were as legally
ad been married bye. person, and with all the
formalities in the world.

I told them thnt no doubt the}' were married in the sight of God,

 

married as if they
and were hound in conscience to keep them as their wires; but. that
the laws of men being otherwise, they might desert the poor women
and children hereafter; and that their wives being poor desolate
women, fricndlcss and moneyless, would have no way to help them-
selves. I thereiiiru told them that: unless I was assured of their hon-
est intent, Leould do nothing for them, but would take care that what
I did should be for the women and children williout them; and that,
unless they would give me some ureuranccs that: they would marry
the women, I could not think it was convenient they should continue
together amnau and wife; for it was hoth scandalous to men and
<<flinibire to God, who they could not think would bless them if they
went on thus.

All this went on as I expected ; and they told me, especially Will
Atkins, who now seemed to speak for the rest, that they loved their
wives as Well as if they had been born in their own native country,
and would not leave them upon any account. whatever; and they did
Vt't'ily believe that. their wives were as virtuous and as modest, and
did, to the utmost of their skill, as much for them and for their chil-
dren, as any women could posaildy do; and they would not part with
them (In any account; and \l'ill Atlting for his own particular added,
that if any man would take him away, and offer to carry him home
to England, and make him captain (if the best man-uf-war in the navy,
he would not- go with him, if he might not carry his wife and children
wi:h him; and if there was a clergyman in the ship, he would he
married to her now, with all his heart.

This wasjust as] would have it; the priest was not witn me at
that. moment, hut was not far nii'; so, to try him further, I told him I
htzd a clergyman with me, and. if he was sincere, I would have him
married next morning, and lrade him comider at" it, and talk with the
rest. He said. as for himself, he nced not consider of it at all, for he
was very ready to do it. and was glad I had a minister with me, and
he believed they Would be all willing also. I then told him that my
friend, the minister, was a Frenchman, and could not speak English,
Lat-I would act as the clerk between them. He never so much as
mkcd me whether he was a I'apist or Protestant, which was, indeed,
what I was afraid of; so we parted ; I went back to my clergyman,
and Will Atkins went in to talk with his companions. I desired the
French gentleman not. to say anything to them till the business was
tlmrnughly ripe : and I told him what answer the men had given me.

Before I went from their quarter they all came to me, and told me
they had been considering what I had said; that they were glad to
hear I had a clergyman in my company, and they were very willing
to give me the satisfaction I desired. and to be formally married as
50on as l pleased; for they were far from desiring to part. with their
wives, and that they meant nothing but what was very honest. when
they chose them. So 1 appointed them to meet me the next morn-
i..g, and in the meantime they should let their wives know the mean-
ing of the marriage law, and that it was not only to prevent any
scandal, but ab-zo to oblige them that they should not forsake them,
whatever might happen.

The women were easily made sensible of the meaning of the thing
and were very well satisfied with it, as indeed they had reason to be ;
so they failed not to attend all together at my apartment, next morn.
ing, where I brought out my clergyman, and though he had not on a
minister's gown. after the manner of England, or the habit of a priest,
after the manner of France, yet having a black vest something like a
cuasot-k, with a sash round it, he did not look very unlike a minister;
and, as for his language, I was his interpreter. But the seriousness
of his behavior to them, and the sernplcs he made of marrying the
women, because they were not baptized and professed Christians,
gave them an exceeding reverence for his person, and there was no
need, after that, to inquire whether he was a. clergyman or not. In-
decd. l was afraid his seruples would have been carried so far as that
he would not have married them at all; any, notwithstanding all I
was able to say to him, he resisted me, though modestly yet very
steadily, and at last refused absolutely to marry them, unless he had
first talked with the men and the women, too, and though I at first
was a little backward to it, yet at last I agreed to it with a good will,
perceiving the sincerity of his design.

When he came to them, he let them know that I had acquainted
him with their circumstances, and with the present design; that he
was very willing to perform that part of his function, and marry
them, as I had desired. but that before he could do it he must take
the liberty to talk with them. He told them that, in the sight of all
indiilhrent men, and in the sense of the laws of society, they had lived
all this while in open fornication, and that it was true that nothing
but the consenting to marry. or effectually separating them from one
another, could now put an end to it; but there was a diificulty in it,
too, with respect to the laws of Christian matrimOny, which he was
not fully satisfied about, vi7... that of marrying one that is a professed
Christian to a savage. an idolater, and a heathen, one that is not hap-
tized; and yet that he did not see that there was time left to endeavor
to perruado the women to be baptized, or to profess the name of
Christ, whom they had, he doubted, heard nothing of, and without
which they could not be baptized. Ile told them he doubted they
were but indifi'erent Christians themselvca; that they had but little
knowledge of God or of his ways, and therefore he could not expect
that they had said much to their wives on that head yet ; but that,
unless they would promise him to use their endeavors with their wives
to persuade them to become Christians, and would, as well as they
could, instruct them in the knowledge and belief of God that made
them, and to worship Jesus Christ that redeemed them, he could not
marry them, for he would have no hand in joining Christians with sav-
ages, nor was it consistent with the principles of the Christian re-
ligion, and was indeed expressly forbidden in God's law.

They heard all this very attentively. and I delivered it very faith-
fully to them from his mouth, as near his own words as I could, only
sometimes adding something of my own, to convince them how just it
was, and how I was of his mind ; and I always very faithfully distin-
guished between what I said from myself and what were the clergy-
man's wards. They told me it was very true what the gentleman
said ; that they were very indifferent Christians themselves, and that
they had never talked to their wives about religion. " Lord, sir,"
says W ill Atkins, " how should we teach them religion? why, we
know nothing ourselves; and, besides, sir," said he, "should we tall:
to them of God, and Jesus Christ, and heaven, and hell. it would
make them laugh at us, and ask us. what we believe ourselves. And
if we should tell thcm that we believe all the things we speak of to
them, such as of good people goii g to heaven, and wicked people to
the devil, they would ask us where we intend to go ourselves, that be_
lievo all this, and are such wicked fellows, as we indeed are. Why,
sir, 'tis enough to give them it surfeit of religion at first hearing; folks
must have some religion themselves before they pretend to teach other
people." "Will Atkins," said I to him, "though I um afraid that
what you say has too much truth in it, yet can you not tell your wife
that she is in the wrong; that there is a God, and a. religion better
than her own; that her gods are idols; that they can neither hear
nor speak _: that there is a great Being that made all things, and that
can destroy all that he hm; made ; that he rewards the good and pun-
ishes the bad, and that we are to be judged by him at last for all we
do here ? You are not so ignorant but even nature itself will teach
you that all this is true; and I am satisfied you know it all to be true,
Ind believe it yourself." " That is true, sir," said Atkins, " but with
what face can I say anything to my wife of all this, when she will
tell me immediately it cannot be true i" ': Not true!" said I; "what
do you mean by that?" "Why, sir," said he, "she will tell me it
cannot he true that this God 1 shall tell her of can he just, or can
puni>h or reward, since I am not. punished and sent to the devil, that
have been such a vieked creature as she knows I have been, even to
her and to everybody else ; and that: I nhould be sufi'ered to live, that
have been always acting so contrary to what. I must tell her is gOod,
and to what I ought to have done." " Why, truly, Atkins," said I, " I
am afraid thou weakest too much truth ," and with that I informed
the clergyman of what Atkins had said, for he was impatient to know.
"031," Stil'l the. Ill'llfbt, " tell him there is one thing will make him the
beret minister in the world to his wife, and that is repentance, for none
teach relzentazzee like true penitents. lle rants nothing but to re-
pent, and tlzen he will he. so much the hotter qualified to instruct his
nills; he will then he al-le to tell her that, there is not only a God,
and that he is thejnst rewarder of good and evil, hat that ho is a mer-
ciful lining, and with inlinite goodness and lung--suffering, fer-hears to
pnnix'h those that Gill-ad; waiting; to lie gracious, and willing not the
death of a sinnnr,l.sut rather that he should return and live; and often-
times he sutl'ers wicked men to go a lung time, and even reserves
damnation to the general day' of retrilnninn; that. it. is a clear evi-
dence of God, and of a future state, that righteous men receive not;
their reward, or wicked men their punishment, till they come into an-
other World; and this will lead hint to teach his wife the doctrine of
the resurrection and of the last: judgment. Let. him hut repent
ior himself, he will he an excellent preacher cf repentance to his
with."

I repeated all this to Atkins, who looked very serious all the while,
and who, we could easily perceive, was more than ordinarily affected
with it; when, being eager, and hardly suffering me to make an end:
"I know all this, manter," says he. " and a great deal more; but I
lure not. the itnpudence to tall: thus to my wife, when God and my
Conscience know, and my wife. will he an undeniable evidence against
me, that I have lived as if I lzad never heard of a God, or a future
state. or anything about. it; and to talk of my repenting, alas!" (and
with that. he fetched a deep sigh, and I eould see that the tears stood
in his eyes) "'tis past all that. with me." " Past it, Atkins '1'" said I;
"what dost thou mean by that?" "I know well enough what I
mean," says he; "I mean 'tis too late, and that. is too true.

I told the clergyman, word for word, what he said: the poor zeal-
ous priest--I must call him so, for, be his opinion what it. will, he had
certainly a most singular afi'ection for the <<nod of other men's souls,
and it would be hard to think he had not the like for his own--I say,
this ufi'eetionate man could not refrain from tears; hut, recovering
himself, mid to me, " Ask him hot one question: is he easy that it is
too late; or is he troubled, and wishes it were not so i" I put the
question fairly to Atkins ; and he answered with a, great deal of pas-
sion, "How could any man he easy in a. condition that mast certainly
end in eternal destruction? that he was far from being easy; but
th: f, on the contrary, he believed he would, one time or other, ruin
hi: 1'" " What do you mean by that i" said I. "Why,"y he said, " he
believed he should one time or other out his throat, to put an end to
the terror of ii."

The clergyman shook his head with great concern in his face, when
I told him all this; but turning quick to me upon it, says, " If that be
his case, we may assure him it is not too late ; Christ will give him
repentance. But pray, says he, " explain this to him: that as no
man is saved but by Christ, and the merit of his passion procuring
divine mercy for him. how can it too late for any man to receive
mercy? Does he think he is able to sin beyond his power or reach
of divine mercy? Pray tell him, there may he a time when pro-
voked mercy will no longer strive, and when God inav refuse to hour,
but that it is never too late for men to ark mercy; and we, that are

 

Christ's servants, are eonnnanded to preach mercy at all times, in the
name of Jesus Christ, to all these that: sincerely repcnt: so that it is
nemr too late to repent."

I told Atkins all this, and he heard me with great earnestness; hat
it seemed as if he turned 01? the discourse to the rest, for he said to
me, he would go and have some talk with his wife; so he went out
awhile, and we talked to the rest. I perceived they were all stupidly
ignorant as to matters of religion, as much as I was when l went
rambling away from my father; and yet there were none of them
backward to hear what had been said; and all of them scrit"
promised that they would talk with their wives ahoutit, and do
endeavors to persuade them to turn Christians.

The cl yman smiled upon me when I reported what answer they
gave, hut laid nothing a good while: but at. last, shaking his head,
" We Ihat are Christ's servants," says he, " can go no farther than to
exhort and instruct; and when men comply, submit to the teproof,
and promise what: we ask, 'tis all we can do; we are hound to accept
their good words _; but, believe me, sir," said he, " whatever you may
have known of the life of that man you call Will Atkins, I believe he
is the only sincere convert among them: I take that man to he a true
penitent: I will not despair of the rest; hut that man is apparently
struck with the Sense of his past life, and I doubt not, when he comes
to talk of religion to his wife, he will talk himself effectually into it:
for attempting to teach others is sometimes the best way of teaching
ourselves I know a man, who, having nothing but a summary no-
tion of religion himself, and heing wicked and profligate to the last.
degree in his life, made a thorough reformation in himselfhy laboring
to convert a Jew. If that poor Atkins begins but once to talk
seriously of Jesus Christ. to his wife, my life for it, he talks himself
into a thorough convert, makes himself a penitent; and who knows
what may follow?"

l'pon this discourse, however, and their promising, as above, to en-
deavor to persuade their wives to emhraee Christianity, he married
the other two couple; but Will Atkins and his wife were not yet Come
in. After this, my clergyman waiting awhile, was curious to know
where Atkins was gone: and turning to me, said, "I entreat- you, sir,
let- ns walk out. of your lahyrinth here, and look ; I dare say we shall
find this poor man somewhere or other talking seriously to his wife,
and teaching her alrrady something of religion." I hogan to be of
the same mind; so we went out together, and I carried him a way
which none know hut myself. and where the trees were so very thick
that it was not easy to see through the thicket of leaves, and far
harder to see in than to see out; when coming to the edge of the
wood, 1 saw Atkins and his tawny wife sitting under the shade of a
hash, very eager in discourse; I stopped short- till my clergyman
name up to me, and then hating showed him where they were, we
stood and looked very steadily at them a good while. I've ohserred
him very earnest with her, pointing up to the sun, and to every quarter
of the heavens, and then down to the earth, then out to the sea, then
to himself, then to her, to the woods, to the trees. " New," says the
clergyman. ' you see my words are made good, the man preaches to
her : mark him now, he is telling her that our God has made him and
her. and the heavens, the earth, the sea, the woods, the trees, &c."
"l heliero he is," said I. Immediately we percr-ired Will Atkins
start upon his feet, fall down on his knees, and lift up both his hands.
We supposed he said something, but we could not hear him; it was
too far for that. lle did not continue kneeling half a minute, but
comes and sits down by his wife, and talks to her again: we per-
ceived then the woman very attentive, but whether she said anything
to him, we could not tell. White the poor fellow was upon his knees,
I could see the tears runs plentit'ully down my clergyman'a cheeks,
and I could hardly forbear myself; hut it woo a great amiction to us
hoth that we were not near enough to hear anything that passed he-
tween them. life", however, we could come no nearer, for fear of
disturbing them; so we resolved to see aux end to this piece of still
conversation, and it spoke loud enough to us without the help of voice.
He sat down again, as I have said, close lay her, and ta lied again
earnestly to her, and two or three times we could see him embrace
her most passionately; another time we saw him take out his haml-
kerehicf and wipe her eyes, and then kiss her again, with a kind of
tramport very unusual; and after several of these things, we saw him
on a sudden jump up again, and lend her his hand to help her up,
when innnediutely leading her by the hand a step or two, they both
kneeled down together, and continued so about two minutes.

My friend could hear it no longer, hut cries out aloud, " St Paul!
St. Paul! lnehold he prayeth." I was afraid Atkins would hear him,
therefore I untreated him to withhold himself awhile, that we might
see an end of the scene, which to me, I must confess, was the most
affeeting that I ever saw in my life. 'r'ell, lac strove with himself for
awhile, hut was in such ruptures to think that the poor heathen
wonnm was become a Christian, that he was not able to contain him-
self; he wept several titties, then throwing up his hands and crossing
his breast, said over several things ejaculatory, and by way of giving
God thanks for so miraculous a testimony of the success of our en-
deavors; some he spoke softly, and I could not well hear others ;
some in Latin, Some in French; then two or three times the tears
would interrupt him, that he could not, speak at all; hot I begged
that he would contain himself, and let us more narrowly and fully ob-
serve what was before us, which he did for a lime, the scene not being
near ended yet; for after the poor man and his wife were risen again
from their knees, we observed he stood talking still eagerly to her,
and we observed her motion, that she was greatly affected with what
he said. l-y her frequently lifting up her hands, laying her hands to
her breast, and such other postures asrxprcss the greatest seriousness
and attention: this continued about half a quarter of an hour, and
then they walked away ; so we could see no more of them in that
situation. I took this interval to talk with my clergyman; and first,
I was glad to see the particulars we had both been witnesses to, that,
though I was hard enough of belief in such cases, yet that I began to
think it was all very sincere here, both in the man and his wife, how!858 mvmcuns 01:-

over ignorant. they might both be, and I hoped such a beginning
would yet have a more happy end. " And who knows," said I, ' but
these two may in time, by instruction and example, work upon some
of the others i" "Seine of them 11" said he, turning quick upon me ;
" ay, upon all of them: depend upon it, if those two savages, for he
has been but little better, as you relate it, thould embrace Jesus
Christ, they will never loan: it. till they work upon all the rest; for
true religion is naturally communicative, and he that is once made a.
Christian will never leave a pagan behind him, it'l.o can help it." I
owned it was a most Christian principie to think so, and o. testimony
of true zeal, as well as a generous heart, in him. " lint, my friend,"
said I, " will you give me leave to start one tiiliiculty here? I
cannot tell how to ohjeec to the least thing; tlgitlllst that :tfli'clionalo
coucern which you show for the turning the lumt' people from their
paganism to the Christian religion: but how docs this comfort you
while these people are, in your account, out of the pale of the
Catholic church, without which you believe there is no salvation? so
that you cstcent those hot heretics, and for other reasons as eli't-ctually
lost as the pagans themselves '2'"

To this ta: ansv.'t-rctl, with alannlance of candor, thus : " Sir, I am a
Catholic ot' the Roman church. and a priest of the order ot't't. lit-ac-
dict... am] I ctnhrace all the principles of the Roman faith; int y t, if
you will believe me, and that. I do not speak in cuntplimcnt to you, or
in respect to my circumstances and your civilitics 3 I say, nevertheless,
I do not look upon you who call yourselves rcl'ormed, without some
charity: l dare not say (though I know it is our opinion in general)
that you cannot be saved; 1 will lay no means limit the mercy of
Christ so far as to think that he cannot. receive you into the Losotn of
his church, in a manner to us nnmrecivahle; unl 1 hope you have the
same charity for us: I pray daily for your being all restored to
Christ's church, by whatsoever nit-thud He, who is allvwist', is pleased
to direct. In the meantime, sure you will ailow it. consists with me,
as a Roman. to distinguish fur hctwcen a Protestant and a pagan; l-e-
tween one tlut calls on Jesus Christ, though in a way which I do not
think is according to the true faith, and a savage or a barbarian, that
knows no God, no Christ, no Redeemer; and if you are not, within the
pale of the Catholic church, we hope you are nearer being restored to
it than those who know nothing of God or of his church; and I re-
joice, therefme, when I see this poor man, who, you say, has been a
profiigate, and almost a murderer, kneel down and pray to Jesus
Christ, as we suppose he did, though not fully enlightened; believing
that God, from whom every such work proceeds, will sensibly touch
his heart, and bring him to the further knowledge of that truth in his
own time; and if God shall influence this poor man to convert and
instruct the ignorant savage, his wife, I can never believe that he shall
be cast away himself. And have I not reason, then, to rejoice, the
nearer any are brought to the knowledge of Christ, though they may
not be brought quite home into the bosom of the Catholic church just
at the time when I may desire it, leaving it to the goodness of Christ
to perfect his work in his own time, and in his own way 2 Certainly,
I would rejoice if all the savages in America were brought, like this
poor woman, to pray to God, though they were all to he Protestants
at first, rather than they should evmtiuue pagans or heathens; firmly
believing, that he that had bestowed the first light to them would
further illuminate them with a beam of his heavenly grace, and bring
them into the pale of his church, when he should see good.

Atkins relates his Conversation with his Wire -- The Latter Baptized b7 the
Priest--Account cf the Starving State of them on Board the mrcutd "53:1
--Bobinson's Dipnrtnro from the Island.

"'AS astonished at the sincerity and temper of this pious
papist, as much as I was oppressed by the power of his rea-
- Boning, and it presently occurred to my thoughts, that if such
@JW a temper was universal, we might all be Catholic Christians,
whatever church or particular profession we joined in; that a Spirit
of charity would soon work on all up into right principles; and as he
thought that the like charity would make us all Catholics, so I told
him I believed had all the members of his church the like moderation,
' they would soon all be Protestants. And there we let": that part ; for
we never disputed at all.
However, I talked to him another way, and taking him by the hand,
" My friend," says I, " I wish all the clergy of the Romish church
ware blast with such moderation, and had an equal share of your
, charity, I am entirely ofyonr opinion; but I must tell you, that if
7 you should preach such doctrine in Spain or Italy, they would put
you into the Inquisition." "It may be so," said he; "I know not
what they would do in Spain or Italy; but I will not any they would
he tho Letter Christians {or that severity; for I tun sure there is no
heresy in nimunding with charity."

As Will Atkins end his wife were gone, our business there was
over, so we went back our own way ; and when we come back, we
found them waiting to be called in; observing this, I asked my clergy-
man if we should discover to him that we had seen him under the
bun-h or not ; and it was his opinion we should not, but lhnt we should
toll: to him first, and hear what he would my to us; so we called him
in alone, nobody being in the place but ourselves, And I began with
him thus:

" Will Atkins," said I, " prithee whet education had you? What
was your {other 2-"

W. A. A better mun than ever I shall be, sir; my {other was I.
clergyman.

ll. t'. What education did he give you 2

W. A. Ile would have taught me well, sir; hot I despised nll edu-
cation, instrurtiuu, or correction, like a boost as l was.

ll. C. It in true, Solomon says, he that despises repl'ooi' is bruliuh.

W. A. .-\_-:, sir, I was hrutish, indeed, for l murdered my father;
for God's snhe, .'ir, tell: no more about thut ; sir, I murdered my poor
father.

l'n. llnl :\ murderer!

Here the priest muted (for I interpreted every word as he spoke)
end looked lmle ; it aeenis he believed thnt Will had really killed his
father.

R. C. No. no, sir, ldo not understand him 50; Will Atkins, explain
yourself; you did not kill your father, did you, with your own
hands 3

W. A. No. sir, I did not cut his throat; but I cut the thread of all
his comforts, and shortened his days ; I broke his heart by the most
ungrateful, unnatural return, for the most tender and uii'ectionnte
treatment that {other ever gave, or child could receive.

11. C. Well, l did not ask you about your father, to extort this con-
fession; I pray God give you repentance for it, and forgive thnt and
all your other sins : but I asked you because I see that though you
have not much learning, yet you are not so ignorant as some are in
things that are goml _: that you have known more of religion, It great
deal. than you have practised.

W. A. Though you, sir, did not extort the confession that I make

heel: upon our lives, the sins against our indulgent parents are cer-
tainly the first that touch us; the wounds they make lie deepest, and
the weight they leave will lie heavicat upon the mind of all the sins
We can commit.

ll. C. You talk too feelingly and sensibly for me, Atkins: I cannot
hear it.

W. A. You hear it, master; I dare say you know nothing of it.

11.0. Yes, Atkins; every shore, every hill, nay, I may sziycrery
tree of this island. is witness to the anguish of my soul for my ingrati-
tude and had usage of a good, tender father; a father much like yours,
by your description. And I murdered my father as well as you. Will
Atkins, but I think, for nll that, my repentance is short of yours, too,
by a great deal.

I \\ uuld h: we said more, it I could have restrained my pensions;
but I thought this pour man' s repent: mee was so much sincmcr than
mine, that I was going to leave of? the discourse and retire, for I was
surprised it: what he had said, und thought that instead of my going
nhout to teach and instruct him. this man was made a teacher and in-
structor to me, in a most surprising and unexpected manner.

I laid all this before the young clergyman, who was greatly affected
with it, and said to me, " Did I not say, sir, that when this man was
convea- ed he would preach to us all? I tell you, sir, if this one man
be made a. true penitent. there will he no need of me; he will make
Christians of all in the island." But having a little composed myself,
I renewed my discourse with \Vill Atkins. " But, "'ill," said I, " how
comes the sense of this matter to touch you just now i"

W. A. Sir, you have set me about :1. work that has struck a dart
through my very soul; I have been talking about God and religion
to my wife, in order, as you directed me, to make a Christian of her
and she has preached such a sermon to me as I shall never forget
while I live.

R. C. No, no, it is not your wife has preached to yon,hut when you
were moving religious arguments to her, conscience has flung them
back upon you.

"1'. A. Ay, sir, with such force on is not to be resisted.

It. C. Pray, Will, let us know what passed between you and your
wife, for I know something of it already.

W A Sir it is impossible to giro you :1qu account of it; I am
too full to hold it and yet have no tongue to express it; but let hm."
have said what she will, and though I cannot give you an account of
it, this I can tell you, I have resolved to amend and reform my no.3

16
R. C. But tell us some of it; lzow did you begin, Will i for thil has
been an extraordinary case, that is uertain. She has preached a. ser-
mon, indcul, italic has wrought this upon you.

"X A. Why, I first. told her the nature of our laws about marriage.
and what the reasons were that men and women were obliged to enter
into such compacts as it; was nether in the power of one nor other to
lureak; that, otherwise, order and justice could not he maintained,
and men would run from their wines, and abandon their children,
mix cunt'usezlly with one another, and neither families he kept entire,
nor inheritanees he settled by legal descent.

R. C. You talk like a civilian, "'ill. Could you make her under-
stand what you meant. by inheritance. and families? They know no
such things unong; the. vex', hut marry any how, without. regard
to relation, mnsanguinity: or fiunily--lwother and sister, nay, asl
have been told, emu the father and the daughter, and the son and the
mother.

 

\V. A. I believe, sir, you are misiniiirmed, and my wife insures mo
of the contrary, and that they abhor it : perhaps, for any farther rela-
tions, they may not. be so exact as we are ; but,i~he tells me, they never
touch one another in the near relationship you speak of.

R. C. Well, what did she say to what. you told her ?

\V. A. She said she liked it very well, and it was much better than
in her country.

R. 0. But did you tell her what. marriage was?

"7. A Ay, ny _: there began our dialogue. I asked her ifshe would
he married to me our way. She asked me what. way that was. I
told her marriage was appointed by God; and here we had a strange
talk together, indeed, as ever man and wife had, l believe.

N. B. This dialogue between "'ill Atkins and his wife I tool: down
in writing, just- after he. had told it me, which was as lirllun-s :

"'lnt. Appointed hy (lod ! "'hy, have you a. God in your country i

"I A. Yes, my dear, God is in every country.

"'iriz. No your God in my country; my country have the great
old Bcnamuckee God.

\V. A. Child, I am very unfit to show you who God is. God is in
heaven, and made the heaven and the earth, the sea, and all that in
them is.

W'u's. N0 make!) do earth; no you God. makce all earth ; no makee
my country.

- Will Atkins laughed a little at he: expression of God not making

humans.
Win-1. No laugh; why laugh me ? This nothing to laugh.

He was justly reprorcd by his wife, for she was more serious than
he at first.

\V. A. That's true, indeed ; I will not laugh any more, my dear.

Wit-'12. Why you say you God makee all 2

"I A. Yes, child, our God made the whole world, and you and me,
and all things; for he is the only true God, and there is no God but
him: he lives forever in heaven.

WIFE. Why you no tell me long ago 1

WV. .\. That's true, indeed; but I have been a wicked wreteh, and
have not only finrgotten to acquaint- thee with anything before, but
have. liven] without. God in the world myself.

"'n'n. "113:! have you a great Gm! in your country, you no know
him ? Go say 0 to him? No do good thing for him ? That no
poSsihle.

\l'. .~\. It is true; though, for all that, we live as if there was no
Gml in heaven, or that. he had no Imwer on earth.

Win-z. But why God let you do no i Why he no makee you good
live i

W. A. It is all our own fault.

Wire. But. you sr - me he is great, much great>>, have much great
power, can makee kill when he will, why he no makeo kill when you
no serve him. no say 0 to him, no he good mans?

\l'. ;\. That is true, he might strike me dead; and I ought to ex-
pert it, for I have heen a wicked wreteh, that is true; hutGud is incr-
cif'ul. and alum not deal with us as we deserve.

Wu'c. lint. then you do not tell Gotl thankee for that, too ?

WV. A. Nu, indeed, I have not thanked God for his mercy any more
than I have feared God for his power.

\l'irn. Then you God no God : me no think believe he be such one,
great much power, strong; no makee kill you, though you make him
so much angry.

W. A. What, will my wicked life hinder you from believing in
GIN]? \tht a dreadful creature am I! and what a sad truth it is,
that the horrid lives of Christians hinder the conversion of heathens!

"'IFE. llow me think you have great much God up there (she points,
up to heaven) and yet no do well, no do good thing? Can he tell ? Sure
he no tell what you do?

W. .-\. Yes. yes, he knows and sees all things: he hears us'speek,
lees what we do. knows what we think, though we do not speak.

Wire. What! he no hear you curse, swear, speak do great damn?
W. A. Yes. yes, hears it all.

~Wire. Where he then the much great power strong?

W. A. He is merciful, that is all we can say for it; and this proves
him to he the true God: he is God and not men, and therefore we are
no: consumed.

II.-.ro Will Atkins told us he was struck with horror, to think how
he could tell his wife so clearly that God seen, and hours and knows
the secret thoughts of the heart, and all that we do, and yet that ho
had due-l to do all tho vile things he had done.

Win-z. Merciful ! What you call that?

W. A. He is our father and maker. and he pitics and spares us.

\Vu'i-L So then he never malice hill, never angry when you do wick-
ed: then he no good himself, or no great. alnle.

'W. A. Yes. yes, my dear, he is infinitely good and infinitely grout,
and able to punish too; and sometimes to show his justice and ven-
geance, he lets lly his anger to destroy sinners and make examples;
many are out (ii? in their sins.

Wire. But no makce kill you yet; then he tell you, may be, that
he no iuahee you kill ; so you mukec do liar-gain with him, you (10
bad thing, he no be angry at ~rou when he he angry at other mans.

\V. A. No, indeed; my sins are all presumptions upon his good-
moss; and he Would be infinitely just- if he destroyed me, as he has
done other men. .

\VIFE. Well: and yet no kill, no makee you (lead; what you say to
him for that? You no tell him thunkee for all that too I

W. A. I am an unthankful, ungrateful dog. that is true.

Wire. Why he no makee you much good better ? You say he makeo
you.

W. A. He made me as he made all the world,- it is I have de-
formed myself and abused his goodness, and made myself or. abomin-
able wretch.

"'1"; I wish you makeo God know me; I no makee him angry, I
no (lo hid wicked thing.

Here Will Atkins said his heart sunk within him, to hear a poor un-
tanght creature desire to be taught to know God, and he such awicked
wretcli th ti. he (-ould not say one word to her about God, but u hat
the reproach of his own carriage would make most irrational to her
to believe: nay, that. already she had told him that she could not he-
have in God, because he, that was so winked, wu: not destroyed.

iv. A. My dear. you mean, you wish I could teach you to know
(:ni, not ('md to know you; for he knows you already, and every
thoughtin your heart.
WIFE. Why, then he know what I any to you now; he know me
wish to know him ; how shall me know who mnkoe moi

W. A. Your creature, he must teach thee, I cannot teach thee; I
will pray to him to teach thee to know him, and forgive me, that am
unworthy to teach thee.

The poor fellow was in such an agony at her desiring him to make
her know God, and her wishing to know him, that he said he fell
down on hi3 knees before her: and prayed to God to enlighten her
mind with the saving knowledge of Jesus Christ, to pardon hie sine,
and accept of his being the unworthy instrument of instructing her
in the principles of religion; after which he sat down by her again,
and their dialogue went on. This was the time when we saw him
kneel down, and hold up his hands.

"'11-'12. "'hat you put down the knee for? \Vhat you hold up the
hand for? "'hat you say 3 Who you speak to i What is all that?

"7. A. My dear, I how my knees in token of my submission to him
that made me; I said O to him, in you call it; and as your old men
do to their idol Renamuckee; that is, I prayed to him.

W'u-'E. 'Whut you say 0 to him for?

\V'. A. I prayed to him to Open your eyes, and your understanding,
that you may know him, and he accepted by him.

WIFE. Can he do that too?

"1'. A. Yes, he can ; he can do all things.

WIFE. But now he hear what you say i

W'. A. Yes; he has hid us pray to him, and promised to hear us.

Wire. Bid you pray ? When he bid you 1 How he bid you!
what, you hear him speak 1

W. A. No, we do not hear him speak; but he has revealed him-
self many ways to us.

Here he was at a great loss to make her understand that God has
revealed himself to us by his word, and what his word was; but at
last he told it her thus:

W. A. God has spoken to some good men in former days, even
from heaven, hy plain words 5 and God has inspired good men by his
Spirit; and they have written all his laws down in a book.

Win. Me no understand that, where is my book?

W. A. Alas! my poor creature, I have not this hook; but I hope
I shall one time or other get it for you, and help you to read it.

Here he embraced her with great afi'eetion ; but with incxpreesible
grief that he had not the Bible.

Wire. But how you makee me know that God teeehee them to
write that book?
W. A. By the same rule that we know him to be God.

WIFE. "'hat rule! what way do you know him i

W. A. Because he teaches and commands nothing but what in
good, righteous, and holy, and tends to make us perfectly good. as
well us perfectly happy ; and because he forbids and commands us to
avoid all that. is wicked, that is evil in itself, or evil in its con-
sequence.

Wire. That me would understand, that me fain see; if he tenchee
all good thing, he makee all good thing, he give all thing, he hear
me when 1 any 0 to him, as you do just now; he makeo me good, if
I wish to be good, he xpare me, no makee kill me when I no be
good: all this you say he do, yet he be great God: me take, think,
believe him to be great God; me say 0 to him with you, my dear.

Here the poor man could forhear no longer, but raised her up,
made her knot-l by him, and he prayed to God aloud to instruct. her
in the knowledge of himself, by his Spirit; and that by some good
providence, if poseihlt', she might NIllIO time or other come to have I
Bible, that she might read the word of God, and be taught by it to
know him. This was the time that no saw him lift her up in); the
hand, and saw him kneel down by her, as above.

They had several other discourses, it seemfl, after this too long to
be set down here ; and particularly she made him promise, that since
he confessed his own life had been a wicked, abominable course of
provoeations against God, that he would reform it, and not make God
angry any more; lest he should make him dead, as he called it, and
then she would he left alone, and never be taught to know this God
better: and lest he should be miserable, as he told her wicked men
would be after death.

This was a strange account, and very affecting to us both, but par.
ticularly to the young clergyman; he was indeed wonderfully sur.
prised with it, but under the greatest affliction imaginable that he
could not talk to her, that he could not speak English, to make her
understand him ; and as she spoke but very broken English, he could
not understand her; however, he turned himself to me, and told me
that he believed that. there must he more to do with this woman than
to marry her. I did not understand him at first, but at length he
explained himself, vi7..,that she ought to be baptized. I agreed with
him in that part readily, and was for going about it presently. " No,
no 5 hold, sir," said he; "though I would have her be baptized by all
means, yet I must observe that Will Atkins, her husband, has indeed
brought her, in a. wonderful manner, to be willing to embrace a re-
ligious life, and has given her just ideas of the being of a God; of
his power, justice, and mercy; yet I desire to know of him, if he has
said anything to her of Jesus Christ, and of the salvation of sinners;
of the nature of faith in him, and redemption by him; of the Holy
Spirit: the resurrection, the lust judgment, and a future state."

I called Will Atkins again, and asked him; but the poor fellow
fcil immediately into tears. and told us he had said something to her
of all these things, but that he was himself so wicked a creature, and.
his conscience so reproached him with his horrid ungodly life, that
he trembled at the apprehensions that her knoulcdge of him should
lessen the attention she should give to those things, and make her
rather contemn religion than receive it; but he was assured, he said,
that her mind was so disposed to receive due impressions of all those
things, and that if I would but discourse with her, she would make
it appear to my satisfaction that my labor would not be lost upon
her.

Accordingly, I called her in, and placing myself as interpreter be-
tween my religious priest and the Woman, I entrcated him to begin
with her; but sure such a. sermon was never preached by a. pol ish
priest in those latter ages of the world ; and. as I told him, I thought
he had all the zeal, all the knowledge. all the sincerity of a. Christian,
without the error of a. Roman Catholic ; and I took him to be such a
clergyman as the Roman Bishops were, before the Church of Rome
assumed spiritual sovereignty over the consciences of men. In a word,
he brought the poor woman to embrace the knowledge of Christ, and
ofredcznption by him, not with wonder and astonishment only, as she
did the first notions of a. God, but with joy and faith ; with an ufl'ection,
and a. surprising degree of understanding. scarce to be imagined, much
less to be expressed ; and, at her own request, she was baptized.

When he was preparing to baptize her, I untreated him that he
would perform that office with some caution, that the man might not
perceive he was of the Roman Church, if possible, because of other ill
consequences which might attend a difference nmong us in that very
religion "'11th "'0 Were instructing the other in. He told me that as
he had no consecrated chapel, nor proper things for the ofliee. I should
see he would do it in a manner that I should not know by it that he
was a. Roman Catholic himself, if l had not known it before; and so
he did; for saying only some words over to himself in Latin. which I
could not understand: he poured a whole dishful of water upon the
woman's head, pronouncing in French very loud "Mary" (which we!
the nuns her hushuid desired me to give her, for I was her godfather)868 mvzer'RI-zs or

"I baptize thee in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the
Holy Ghost 2" so that none could know anything by it what religion
he was of. He gave the benediction afterward in Latin, but either
"'ill Atkins did not know butit was French, or also did not take notice
of it at that time.

As soon as this was over. we married them ; and after the marriage
was over, he turned to Will Atkins, and in a very afi'eetionato manner
exhorted him, not only to persevere in that good disposition he was
in, but to support the convictions that were upon him by a resolution
to reform his life; told him it was in rain to say he had repented if
he did not forsake his crimes; represented to him how God had
honored him with being the instrument of bringing his wife to the
knowledge of the Christian religion, and that he rhould be careful he
did not dishonor the grace of God _; and that if he did, he would see
the heathen a better Christian than himself; the savage converted,
and the instrnnwnt thrown away. He said agreat mar-y good things
to them both; and then recommending them to God's goodness, gzaro
them the benediction ngainJ repeating everything to them in linglith ;
and thus ended the ceremony. I think it was the most pleasant and
agreeable day to me that I ever passed in my whole life.

But my clergyman had not done yet; his thoughts hung continu.
ally upon the conversion of tho thirty-seven savages, and fain he
would have stayed upon the island to have undertaken it; but I eon-
t'ineed him,first, that his undertaking was impractieahlo in itself;
and, secondly, that perhaps I would put it. into a way of being done
in his absence to his satisfaction ; of which by-and-hy.

Having thus brought the affairs of the island to a narrow compass,
I was preparing to go on board the ship, when the young man I had
taken out of the famished ship's company came to me, and told me he
understood I had :1. clergyman with me. and that 1 had caused the
Englishman to he married to the savages; that he had a mateh,tuo,
which he desired might be finished before I went, between two
Christians, which he erped would not he disagreeable to me.

I knew this must be the young woman who was his mother's
servant, for there was no other Christian woman on the island; so I
began to persuade him not to do anything of that kind rashly, or he-
eause he found himself in this tmlitar;r circumstance. I represented
to him that he had some considerahle substance in the world. and
good friends, as I understood by himself, and the maid also ; that the
maid was not only poor, and a servant, but. wan unequal to him, she
being six or seventy-and-twenty years old, and he not being seventeen
or eighteen; that he might very probably, with my assistance, make
I: remove from this wilderness, and come into his own country again ;
and that then it would he a. thousand to one hut he would repent his
clmice, and the dislike of that circumstance might be disadvantageous
ta) lmlll. Iwns going to say more, but he interrupt-ed me, smiling,
and told me, with n great deal of modesty, thatImistouk in my
guesses; that he had nothing of that kind in his thoughts; and that
he was very glad to hear that I had an intent of putting them in a
way to see their own country again ; and nothing should have put him
"you staying there, but that the voyage I was going was so exceed-
ingly long and hazardous, and would carry him quite out of the
reach of all his friends ; and that he had nothing to desire of me, but
that I would settle him in some little property in the island where he
wzis.give him a. servant or two, and some few necessaries, and he
would settle himself here like a planter, waiting the good time when:
if ever I returned to England, Iwould redeem them; and hoped I
would not he unmindful of him when I came to England; that he
would give me some letters to his friends in London, and let them
know how good I had been to him, and in what part of the world,
and what circumstances I had left him in ,' and he promised me that
whenever I redeemed him, the plantation and all improvements he
had made upon it, let the value be what it would, should be wholly
nllllfl

Ilis discourse was very prettily delivered, considering his youth,
and was the more agreeable to me because he told me pesitively the
match was not for himself. I gave him all possible assurances that if
I lived to come safe to England, I would deliver his letters, and do his
business ell'ectually ; and that he might depend I should never forget
the circumstances I had left him in; but still I was impatient to know
who was the person to he married; upon which he told me it wasmy
Jack-of-all-trades and his maid Susan. I was most agreeably sur-
prised when he named the match ; for indeed I thought it very suit--
able. The character of that man I have given already: and as for
the. maid, <<he was a very honest, modest, sober, and religious young
woman ; had a. very good share of sense, was agreeable enough in
her person, spoke very handsomely, and to the purpose, always with
decency and good manners, and neither too backward to speak, when
requisite, nor impeninently forward, when it was not her business;
very handy and housewifely, and an excellent manager; fit, indeed, to
have been governess to the whole island, and she knew very well how
to behave in every respect.

16'3 7 ) Abv smears os-

Thc match being proposed in this manner, we married them the
same day ; and as l was father at. the altar, as I may say, and gave
her away, so I gave her a portion; for I appointed her and her
husband a handsome large space of greund for their plantation; and,
indeed. this match, and the proposal the young gentlemen made to
give him a small property in the islani put me upon parcelling it out.
among them, that they might not quarrel afterward about their
situation.

This sharing out the land to them I left to Will Atkins, who was
now grown a sober, grave, managing fellow, perfectly reformed, ex-
ceedingly pious and religious, and as far as 1 may be allowed to
speak positively in such a case, I verily believe he is a true penitent.
lle divided things so justly, and so much to every one's satisfaction,
that they only desired one general writing under my hand for the
whole, \vhieh I caused to be drawn up, and signed and sealed to them,
setting out the bounds and situatiun 05 every man's plantatitm, and
testifying that I gave them therehy severally a. right to the whole
pus 'iuu and inheritance of the respective plantations or farms, with
their improvements, to them and their heirs, reserving all the rest of
the island as my own property, and a certain rent for every particular
plantatiun after eleven years. if l, or any one frmn me, ur in my
name, came to demand it, prndneing an attested copy of the same
\vriting.

As tn the government and laws among them,l told them I was not
capable nl giving them better rules than they were able in give them-

 

selves: nnl_v I made them promise me to live in hue and good neigh-
burhuud \vith nae another; and so i prepared to leave them.

One tlzi: g I must not omit, and that is, that being no" settled in a
kind of commonwealth among themselves, and having much business
in hand. it was but odd to have seven-:md-thirtv Indians live in u.
nook of the island. indt'pendmut, and, indeed, unmnplnyed; for, ex-
cepting the. providing themselves with food, which they had difficulty
cur-ugh tu do sometimes, they had no manner of business or property
to manage. 1 proposed. therefore, to the governor Spaniard. that he
nhnuld g" to them. with Friday's father, and prnposc to them to re-
move. and either plant for themselves, or take them into their several
families as servants, to be maintained fur their labor, but without be-
in}: actual slaves: furl would not admit. them to make them slaves
by farce, hv any means: because thev had their liberty given them
by capitulntion, as it were articles of surrender, which they ought not
to break.
They most willingly embraced the proposal, and came all very
cheerfully along with him: so we allotted them land, and plantations,
which three or four accepted of, but all the rest chose to be em-
ployed as servants in the several families we had settled; and thus
my colony was in a manner settled, as follows: The Spaniards pos-
sessed my original habitation, which was the capital city, and ex-
tended their plantations all along the side of the brook, which made
the creek that I have so often described. as far as my bower ; and as
they increased their culture, it went alwuy eastward The English
lived in the northeast part, where Will Atkins and his comrades be-
gun. and came on southward and southwest, toward the back part of
the Spaniards; and every plantation had a great addition of land to
take in, if they found occasion, so that. they need not jostle one
another for want of room. All the east end of the island was left
uninhabited, that if any of the savages should come on shore there
only for their usual customary b:trl.>>arities, they might come and
go; if they disturbed nobody, nobody would disturb them ; and.
no doubt but they were often ashore, and went away again, for I
never heard that the planters were ever attacked or disturbed any
1!"er.

it now came into my thoughts that I had hinted to my friend, the
clergyman, that the work of converting the savages might. perhaps be
so: on foot in his absence to his satisfaction, and told him that now
I thought it was put in a fair way; for the savages being thus di.
\'iiled among the Christians, if they would but every one of them do
their part with those which came under their hands, I hoped it. might
have a very good elicet.

He agreed presently in that, if they did their part. "But how,"
says he, "shall we obtain that of them i" I told him we would call
them all together, and leave it in charge with them, or to go to them,
one by one. which he thought- beet; so we divided it, he to Speak to
the Spaniards, who were all papists, and I to the English, who were
all Protestants; and we recommended it earnestly to them, and made
them promise that they would never make any distinction of papiet
or Protestant in their exhorting the savages to turn Christians, but
teach them the general knowledge of the true God, and of their Sa-
vior Jesus Christ; and they likewise promised us that they would

ligion.

When I came to Will Atkins'a house (I may call it no, for such I
house, or Inch a piece of basket-work, I believe, was not landing in
the world again), there I found the young woman I have mentioned
nimx e, and Will Atkinu'u wife, were become intimates ; and this pru-
dent, religious young woman had perfected the work Will Atkins had
begun ; and though it was not above four days after what I lime re-
Ian-(l, yet the new-baptized savage wonmu was made such n Christinn
".s l have seldom heard of in all my observation: or conversntion in
the world.

It come next into my mind, in the morning before I went to them,
that, among all the needful things I had to leave with them,l had
not left them it Bible, in which I showed myself less considering for
them than my good friend the \vidow was for me, when she sent me
the cargo of n. hundred pounds from Lisbon, where she packed up
three Bibles and a prayer-hook. Ilowever, the good woman's churity
had a greater extent than ever she imugined, for they were reserved
for the comfort and instruction of those thnunodo much better use
ofthcm than I hurl done.

I took one of the Bibles in my pocket, and when I come to Will
Atkias's tent, or house, and found the young woman and Atkins'a
thytizcd wife had been diseoursiog of religion together, for Will At-
ltins told me it with a. great deal of joy, I asked ifthoy were together
now. and he said yes; so I went into the house, and he with me, and
we found them together Very earnest in discourse. "O sir," says
Will .It'nius, "when God has sinners to reconcile to himself, and
olives to bring home, he never wants a. messenger; my wife has got
a new instructor: I ltuew I was as un\\'m-th_\r us I was iiimpnlnle of
that work ; that young woman has lut'eu sent hither from heaven: she
is enough to convert. a "hole island of savages." The young woman
blushed, and rose up to go nway. but I (lesired her to sit still ; I told
her she had a. good work upon her hands, and I hoped God would
bless her in it.

We talked a little, and Idixl not perceive they had any hook among
thmn, though I did not ask: lmtI put my hand into my pocket, and
pulled out my Bible. "lIcre," says I to Atkins, "I have brought
yov an assistant that perhaps you had not before." The man was .ro
confiuuuled thnt he was not able to speak for some time: but recover-
ing himself, he takes it with both his hands, and turning to his wife,
"Here, my dear," says he, "did I not tell you our God, though he
lives above, could hear what we said I Here": the hook I prayed for
when you and I kneelod down under the bush; now God hm; heard
us, and sent it." "'hen he had said so, the man fell into such trans-
ports of passionate joy, that between the joy of having it, and giving
God thanks for it, the tears ran down his face like a child that was
crying.

The woman was surprised, and was like to have run into a mistake
that none of us were aware of, for she firmly believed God lnnl rent
the hook upon her husband's petition. It is true, that providentinlly
it mu; so, and might be tuhcn so in o consequent sense ; Lutl believe
it Would have been no difficult mutter, at that time, to have per-
suaded the poor woman to have believed that an express messenger
come from heaven on purpose to bring that individual hook; but it
was too serious n matter to suffer any delusion to take pluce; so I
turned to the young woman, and told her we did not desire to im-
pose upon the new convert, in her first and more ignorant understand-
ing of things, and begged her to explain to her that God may he very
properly said to answer our petitions when, in the course of his
providence, such things are in a particular manner brought to puss us
we petitioned for; but we did not expect returns from heaven in n
miraculous tund particular manner, and it is our mercy that it is
not so.

This the young women did afterwards effectually, so that there was,
I assure you, no pricstcrnft used here; nnd I should have thought it
one of the most unjustifiable frauds in the world to have had it so.
But the surprise ofjoy upon Will Atkins is really not to he expressed;
and there, we may he sure, \vns no delusion. Sure no man was ever
more thankful in the world for anything of its kind than he was for
the Bible; nor, I believe, never any mun was glad ofn Bihle from a
better principle: and though he had been n most profligate creature,
headstrong, furious, and desperately wicked, yet this man is a stand-
in; rule '0 us all for the well instructing children, viz. : that parents
should never give over to teach and instruct, nor ever despair of the
S'lm'nlss of their endeavors, lot the children be ever so refractory, or to
nppnn-nncc, insensihlo of instruction ; for if ever God, in his provi-
d um. touches the conscienCe of such, the force of their education
return-i upon them, and the early instruction of parents is not lost,
though it may have been mnnv yenrdlnid asleep, hutfiome time or other,
the? may find the benefit of it. Thus it was with this poor man;
however ignorant he was of religion and Christian knowledge, he
fouul he had some to do with now more ignorant than himself, and
that. the least. part of the instruction of his good father that now came
to his mind was of use to him.

Among the rest it. occurred to him, he said, how his father used to
insist so much on the inexpressihle value of the Bible, the privilege874 [tow-mums or

and blessing of it to nations, families, and persons 3 but he never en-
tertained the least notion of the worth of it till now, when being to
talk to heathens, savages, and barbarians, he wanted the help of the
written oracle for his assistance.

The young woman was glad of it also for the present occasion,
thuugh she had one. and so had the youth, on board our ship, among
their goods, which were not yet brought on shore. And now having said
5:) many things of this young woman, I cannot omit telling one story
more of her and myself, which has something in it very informing and
remarkable.

I have related to what extremity the poor young woman was re-
dueed, how her mistress was starved to death, and (lied on heard that
unhappy ship we met at ace. and how the whole ship's company was
reduced to the last extremity. The gontlewoman and her son, and
this maid. were first hardly used, as to proriaions, and at last totally
neglected and starved ; that is to any, brought to the lust extremity of
hunger. One day, being discoursing with her on the cxtremiticsthcy
enfi'ered, I asked her if he she could descrihe, hy what she had felt,
what it was to starve, and lmw it appeared? She told me she believed
she could, and she told her tale very distinctly, thu:I :

"' First, sir." said she, " we had for some days fared exceeding hard,
and suffered very great hunger; but at last we were wholly without
feed of any kind, except sugar, and a little wine and water. The
first, day, after I had received no food at all, I found myself, toward
evening. first empty and sick at the stomach, and nearer night much
inclined to yawning and sleep. I laid down on n couch in the great
cabin to sleep, and slept about three hours, and awaked a little rc-
frcshed, having taken a glass of wine when I lay down; after being
alxout three hours awake, it being about five o'clock in the mnrning,I
found myself empty, and my stomach sickish, and lay down again, but
could not sleep at all, being very faint and ill; and thua I continued
all the second day, with a strange variety, first hungry, then sick
again. with retchings to remit. The second night, living ohliged to go
to bed again without any food, more than n draught of fresh water,
and being asleep, I dreamed I was at Barbadoes, and that the market
was mightily stocked with provisions; that I bought some for my
mixtres-u, and went and dined very heartily. I thought my stomach
was as full after this as it would have been after a good dinner but
when I awaited. I was cxeeediuglysunk in my spirits to find myself in
the extremity of famine. The last glass of wine we had I drank, and
put sugar in it, because of its having some spirit to supply noun-inh-
ment ; but there being no substance in the stomach for the digesting
ofice to work upon, I found the only efi'ect of tho wine was, to raise
disagreeable fumes from the stomach into the head; and] lay, as
they told me, stupid and senseless, ns ono drunk, for some time. The
third dav, in the morning. after a night of strange, confused, and in-
consistelil. dreams, and rather dozing than sleeping, I awaked raven-
ous and furious with hunger; and I question, had not my understand-
ing returned and conquered it, whether, if I had been a mother, and
had had a little child with me, its life would have been safe or not.
This lasted about three hours; during which time I was twice raging
mad as any creature in Bedlam, as my young master told me, and as
he can now inform you.

'-' In one of these fits of lunacy or distraction l fell down, and struck
my face against the corner of a pallet bed, in which my mistress lay:
and, with the hlow, the blood gushed out of my nose; and the cabin-
boy bringing no a little basiml sat down and bled into it a great
deal; and as the blood came from me, I came to myself, and the
violence of the flame or fever I was in abated, and so did the raven-
ous part of the hunger. Then I grcw sick, and rctehed to vomit, but
could not, for I had nothing in my stomach to bring up. AftcrI had
Lled some time, I swooned, and they all helievcd I was dead; but I
came to myself soon after. and then had a most dreadful pain in my
stomach, not to be described. not like the colic, but a gnawing, eager
pain for food; and toward the night it went 03', with a kind ofcarnest
.wishing or longing for food, something like, as I suppose, the longing
of a woman with child. I took another draught of water with sugar
in it ; but my stomach loathed the sugar, and brought it all up again ;
then 1 took a draught of water without sugar, and all staid with me ;
and I. laid me down upon the bed, praying me most heartily that it
would please God to take me away: and composing my mind in
hopes of it, I slumbercd awhile, and then waking, thought mysel
(lying, being light with vapors from an empty stomach; I rel-em-
n:endod my soul then to God, and earnestly wished that somebody
would throw me into the sea.

" All this while my mistress lay by me, just, as I thought. expiring,
but here it with much more patience than I _: gave the last bit ofhroad
she had left to her child, my young master. who would not have taken
it, hut she ohliged him to eat it; and I believed it saved his life.

" Toward the morning I slept again: and when I awoke, I fell into
a violent passion of crying. and after that had a second fit of violent
hunger; Igot up ravenous, and in a most dreadful condition,- had
my mistress been dead, as much m: I loved her, I am certain I should
have eaten a piece of her flush with much relish, and no unconcerned
as ever I did eat the flesh of any creature appointed for food; and
once or twice 1 was going to bite my own arm ,: at lmtl saw the basin
in which mm the blood I had bled at my nose the day Leforc ; Iran
to it, and swallowod it with such haste, and such a greedy nppetite, as
if I wondered nobody had taken it before, and afraid it should be
taken from me now. After it was down, though the thoughts of it
tilled me with horror, yet it. checked the [it of hunger, and I took
another draught of water, and was composed and refreshed for some
hours after. This was the fourth day ; and thus I held it till toward
night: when, within the compass of three hours, I had all the several
circumstances over again, one after another, \'iz'..: sick,sleepy, eagerly
hungry, pain in the stomach, then ravenous again, then sick, then lu-
natic, then crying, then ravenous again, and so every quarter of an
hour; and my strength wasted exceedingly ; at night I laid me down,
having no comfort but in the hope that I should die before morn-
ing.

" All this night I had no sleep ; but the hunger was now turned into
a disease; and I had a terrible colic and griping, by wind, instead
of food, having found its way into the bowels; and in this condition I
lay till morning, when I was surprised with the cries and lamenta-
tions of my young master, who called out to me that his mother was
dead : I lifted myself up a. little, for I had not strength to rise, but
found she was not dead, though she was able to give very little signs
of life.

"I had then such convulsions in my stomach, for want of some
sustenance, that I cunmt describe; with such frequent throes and
pangs of appetite, that nothing but the tortures of death can imi-
tnte; and in this condition I was when I heard the seamen above
cry out, ' A sail! a sail!' halloo and jump about as if they were dis-
tracted.

'- I was not able to get at? from the bed, and my mistress much less;
and my young master was so sick, that I thought he had been ex-
piring ; so we could not open the cabin door, or get any account
what it was that occasioned such confusion; nor had we any com
versation with the ship's company for two days, they having told us
that they had not a mouthful of anything to eat in the ship; and this
they told us afterward, they thought we had been dead. It was this
dreadful condition we were in when you were sent to save our lives;
and how you found us, sir, you know as well as I, and better too."
This was her own relation, and is such n distinct account of starving
to death, as I confess, I never met with, and was exceeding entertain-
in; to me. I am the rather apt to believe it to be a true account. be.
cause the youth gave me on account of a. good part of it; though, I
must on n, not so distinct end so feeling its the maid: and the rather.
lOJnuS'.) it seems his mother fed him at the price of her own life ;
lot the poor maid, though her constitution being stronger than that
of her mistress, who was in years, and a weakly woman, too, she
might struggle harder with it : I my, the poor maid might be sup-
posed to feel the extremity something sooner than her mistress, who
might. he allowed to keep the last bit something longer than she
parted with any to relieve the unit]. No question, as the case is here
related, if our ship, or some other, had not prot'idcntinlly met them, a
few days more would have ended all their lives, unless they had pre-
vented it by eating one another _: and that even, as their case stood,
would have served them but a little while, they being five hundred
leagues from on y land, or any possibility of relief, other than in the
miraculous manner it ha; peued ; but this is by the way: I return to
my disposition of things among the people.

And, first. it is to be observed here, that for many reasons I did not
think fit to let them know anything of the sloop I had framed, and
which I thought of setting up among them; for I found, at least at
my first coming, such seeds of diviiions among them, that I saw
plainly had I set up the sloop, and left it among them, they would,
Upon every light disgust, have separated, and gone away from one
another, or perhaps have turned pirates, and so made the island a den
of thieves, instead of a. plantation of sober and religious people, as I
intended it; nor did I leave the two pieces of brass cannon that. I
had on hoard, or the two quarter-deck guns that my nephew took ex-
traordinary, for the same reason: I thought it was enough to qualify
them for a. defensive war against any that should inmde them, but
not to set them up for an oil'ensivo war, or to go abroad to attack
others; which, in the end, would only bring ruin and destruction
upon them: I reserved the sloop, therefore, and the guns for their
service another way, as I shall observe in its place.

Having now done with the island, I left them all in good circum-
stances, and in a flourishing condition, and went on board my ship
again on the 6th of May, having been about twenty-five days among
them; and on they were all resolved to stay upon the island till I
came to remove them, I promised to send them farther relief from the
Brnzils, if I could possibly find on opportunity: and, particularly, I
promised to send them some cattle, such as sheep, hogs, and cows; as
to the two cows and calves which I had brought from England, we

had been obliged, l-y the length of our voyage, to kill them at sea,
for want of hay to feed them.

Encounter with Savages at Sea--Friday's Death--Robinson finds his former
Partner in the Brads-Sails for the East Indies.

@UE next day, giving them a salute of five guns at parting
(1r 3 we set sail. and arrived at. the hay of All Saints, in the Bra-
6'59 ails, in about twenty-two days, meeting nothing remarkable
(.2 in the lxaxsage but this : that about. tinee days after we had
aaiietl, being heealmed, and the current setting strong to the E. N. E.
running, as it were, into a. buy or golf on the land side, we were
driven something out of our course, and once or twice our men cried
out, " Land to the eastwm-df' but whether it was the continent or
'slnnds we could not, tell by any means. But. the third day, toward
evening, the sea smooth, and the weather calm, we saw the sea, no it
ware, covered toward the land with something very black ; not being
able to discover what it was, till after some time, our chief mote, going
up to the main-shrouds a little w: y, and looking at them with a.
perspective, cried out it was an army. I could not. imagine what he
meant by an army, and thwarted him a little hastily. "Nay, sir,"
ays he, "don't be angry, for 'tis an army, and a fleet, too; for I he.
liere there are a. thousand canoes, and you may see them paddle
along. for they are coming toward us apnea."

I was a little surprised then, indeed, and so was my nephew the
captain ; for he had heard such terrible stories of them in the island,
and having never been in those seas before, that he could not tell
what. to think of it, but said, two or three times, we should all be de-
voured. I must confess, considering we were becalmcd, and the cur-
rent set. strong toward the shore, I liked it the worse; however, I
bntle them not to be afraid, hut bring the ship to an anchor 88 soon as
we came so near to know that we must engage them.

The weather continued calm, and they came on space toward us;
IO I gave order to come to an anchor, and furl all our sails: as for
the savages, I told them they had nothing to fear but fire, and there-
fore they should get their boats out, and fasten them, one close by
the head, and the other by the stern, and man them both well, and
wait the issue in that posture: this I did, that the men in the boats
might be ready with sheets and buckets to put out any fire these
savages would endeavor to fix to the outside of the ship.

In this posture we lay for them, and in a little while they came up
with us; but never was such a horrid sight seen by Christians:
though my more was much mistaken in his calculation of their num-
ber, yet when they came up we reckoned about a hundred and
twenty-six; some of them had sixteen or seventeen men in them,
some more, and the least six or seven.

When they came nearer to us, they seemed to be struck with won-
der and astonishment. as at a sight which doubtless they had never
seen before; nor could they at first, as we afterward understood,
know what to make of us. They came boldly up, however, very near
to us, and seemed to go about to row round us; but we called to our
men in the boats not to let them come too near them. This very order
brought us to an engagement with them,without our designing it, for
five or six of the largo canoes came so near our long boat that our
men beckoned with their hands to keep them back, which they under-
stood very well, and went back= but at their retreat about fifty arrows
came on board us from those boats, and one of our men in the long-
boat was very much Wounded. However, I called to them not to tire
by any means; but we hmded dowu some deal boards into the boat,
and the carpenter presently set up a kind of fence, like waste boards,
to cover them from the arrows of the savages, if they should shoot
again.

About half an hour afterward they all came up in a body astern of
us, and so near as that we could easily discern what they were, though
we could not tell their design ; and I easily found they were some of
my old friends, the same sort of savages that I had been used to en-
gage with, and in a short time more they rowed a littie farther out to
Sea. till they came directly broadside with us, and then rowed down
straight upon us, till they came so near that they could hear us speak.
Upon this I ordered all my men to keep close, lest they should shoot
any more arrows, and made all our guns ready : but being so near as
to be within hearing, I made Friday go out upon the deck, and call
out aloud to them in his language to know what they meant, which
accordingly he did. 'Whother they understood him or not that I knew
not, but as soon as he had called to them, six of them, who were in
the foremost or nighest heat to us, turned their canoes from us, and
steeping down, showed us their naked haeksides; just as if, in En.
gilxii, saving your presence, they hid us kiss ----. Whether this was
a defiance or challenge we knew not, or whether it was done in
mere contempt, or as a signal to the rest; Lut immediately Friday
cried out they were going to shoot; and, unhappily for him, peer fel-
low, they let fly about three hundred of their arrows, and, to my in-
expressihle grief, killed poor Friday, no other man being in their
sight. The poor fellow was shot with no less than three arrows,
and about three more feil very near him, such unlucky marksmeu
they were.

1 was so .::raged at the loss of my old trusty servant and compan-
ion, that I immediately ordered live guns to be loaded with small shot
and four with great, and gave them such a broadside as they had never
heard in their lives before, to be sure. They were n it ahove half a
cable length of when we fired, and our gunners took their aim so well
that three or four of their canoes were uverset, as we had reason to
believe, by one shot only.

The ill manners of turning up their bare hacksides to He gave us no
great oti'enec; neither (lid 1 know for certain whether that which
would pass for the greatest contempt among us, might he understood
So by them or not; therefore, in return, I had only resolved to have
fir 'd four or the guns at them, with powder only, which I knew would
frighten them sufficiently; but when they shot at us directly, with all
the fury they were capable of, and especially as they had killed my
poor Friday, whom I so entirely loved and valued. and who, indeed,
80 Well deserved it, I thought myself not only justifiable before God
and man, but Would have been very glad ifI could have oversct every
canoe there, and drowned every one of them.

I can neither tell how many we killed, nor how many we wounded
at this broadside, but sure such a fright and hurry never was seen
among such a multitude ; there were thirteen or iburteen of their ea-
nnes split and overset in all, and the men all set a swinnning; the
rest. frightened out of their wits, scoured away as fast as they could,
taking hot little care to save those whose boats were split or spoiled
with our shot. so I suppose that many of them were lost, and our men
took up one poor fellow, swimming for his life, above an hour after
they were all gone.

The small shot from our cannon must needs ltil and wound a great
many ; hat. in short, we never knew anything how it went with them,
for they fled so fast that in three hours, or thereabouts, we could not
see above three or {our straggling canoes, nor did we ever see the rest
anymore, for ahreem of wind springing up the Gonzo evening, we
weighed, and set sail for the Brazils.

We had a prisoner, indeed, but the creature was so sullen that he
would neither eat nor speak, and we all fancied he would starve him-
self to death, but. I took a way to cure him, for I made them take hi .1
and turn him out into the long-boat, and make him believe they would
toss him into the sea again, and so leave him where they found him,
if he would not speak; not would that do, but they really did throw
him into the sea, and came away from him; and then he followed
them, for he swam like a cork, and called to them in his tongue,
though they knew not a word of what he said. However, at last they
took him in again, and then he began to he more tractable; nor did I
ever design they should drown him.

"'e were now under sail ugain,hut I was the most disconsolate
creature alive for want, of my man Friday, and would have been very
glad to have gone back to the island, to have taken one of the rest
from there for my occasion; but it could not he, so we went on. "'0
had one prisoner, as I have said, and it was along time before we
could make him understand anything, but. in time, our men taught
him some English, and he began to hea little tract-able. Afterward,
we inquired what country he came from; but could make nothing of
what he said, for his speech was so odd (all gutturals), and he rpoko
in the threat in such a hollow, odd manner, that we could never form a
word after him, and we were all of opinion that. they might Speak
that language as well if they were gagged as otherwise ; nor could we
perceive that they had any occasion either for teeth, tongue, lips, or
palate, hut. {cu-med their words just as a hunting horn forms a tune,
with on open throat. He told us, however, some time after, when we
had taught him to speak a little English, that they were going with
their kings to fight a great battle. When he said kings, we asked him
how many kings ? He said there were five nation (we roahl not make
him understand the plural s), and that they all joined to go against
two nation. We akked him what. made them come up to us? lie
said, "To makec to great: wonder look." Here it is to he ohserred
that all those natives, as also those of Africa, when they learn En-
glish, always add two c's at the end of the words where we use one,
and they place the accent upon them, as main-e, tnkce, and the like,
and we could not break them ot'it; nay, I could hardly make Friday
leave it off, though at. last he did.

And, now I name the poor fellow once more, I must take my last
leave of him. Poor, honest Friday! We buried him with all the do.
ceney and solemuity possible, by putting him into a coffin and throw-
ing him into the sea, and l eaueetl them to tire elmen guns for him;
and so ended the. life. of the most grateful, faithful, honest; and most
all]: 'tiunato servant that ever luau had.

We went now away with a fair wind for Brazil, and in about twelve
days' time we tnu..lo land, in the latitude of five degrees south of the
line, heing the not'thcastermost land of ail that part of America. "'e

clothes and tools for his planting; work, which he said he understood,
having been an old planter at Maryland, and almceancer into the
bargain. I encouraged the fellow, by granting all he desired; and,
as an addition, I gave him the savage whom we had taken prisoner of
war to he his slave, and ordered the governor Spaniard to give him
his share of everything he wanted with the rest.

When we came to lit this man out, my old partner told me there
was a certain very honest fellow, :1 Brazil planter of bin acquaintance,
who had fallen into the displeasure of tho church. "I know not what
the matter is with him," says he, "' hat on my conscience, I think he
is a heretic in his heart, and he has liven obliged to conceal himself
for fear ol'lhe Inquisition: that he would he very glad of such an
opportunity to make his escape, with his wife and two daughters : and
if I would let them go to my inland, and allot them a plantation, he
would give them a small rtoek to hegin with ; for the officers of the
Inquisition had seized all his effects and estate, and he had nothing
left but a little household stud, and two slaves; and," adds he,
" though I hate his principles, yet. I would not have him fall into
their hands, for he will be assuredly lmrncd alive if he does."

I granted this presently, and joined my Englishman with them;
and we concealed the man, and his wife and daughters, on board our
rhip, till the sloop put out to go to sea; and then, having put. all
their goods on board some time before, we put them on board the
sloop after she was got out of the hay.

Our seamen were mightily pleased with this new partner; and their
flocks, indeed, were much alike rich in tools, in preparations, and a
farm: but nothing to begin with, except as above; however, they
carried over with them, which was worth all the rest, some materials
for planting sngareanes, with some plants of canes, which he, I mean
the Portugal man, understood very well.

Among the rest of the supplies sent to my tenants in the island, I
lent. them by the sloop three milch cows and live calves, about twenty.
two hogs among them, three sows big with pig, two mares, and a
atom-horse. For my Spaniards, according to my promise, I engaged

their long stay there; that Will Atkins was dead; that live of the
Spaniards were come away; and though they had not been much
molested hy the savages, yet they had some skirmishes with them;
and that they begged of him to write to me to think of the promise I
had made to fetch them away, that they might see their country again
before they died.

7 But I was gone a wild goose chase, indeed, and they that will have
any more of me. must be content to follow me into it new variety of
follies, hardships, and wild adventures, wherein the justice of Provi-
dence may be duly observed ; and we may see how easily Heaven can
gorge us with our own desires, make the strongest of our wishes be
our nfllietinn, and punish us most severely with those very things
which we think it would be our utmost happiness to be allowed in.
Whether I had business or no business, away I went. It is no time
now to enlarge upon the reason or ahsurdity of my own conduct. but
to come to the history: I was embarked for the voyage, and the voy-
age I went.

1 shall only add a word or two concerning my honest popish cler-
gyman; for, let their opinion of us, and all other heretics in general,
as they call us, be as unchnritahlo as it may, I verily believe this man
was very sincere, and wished the good of all men; yet I believe he
""3 "Po" the reserve in many of his expressions, to prevent giving
me 030MB, for l scarce heard him once call on the blessed Virgin, or
mention St. Jagn or his guardian angel, though so common with the
rest of them. However. I any, I had not the least doubt- of his sin-
cerity. and pious intentions on his own part, and I am firmly of Opin-
ion, if the rest of the popish missionaries were like him, they would
Strive to visit even the poor Tartars. and anlanders. where they had
nothing to give them, as well as covet to flock to India, Persia, Chins>>,

iv.
etc., the most wealthy of the heathen countries, for if they expected to
bring no gains to their church by it, it may well be admired how they
came to admit the Chinese Confucius into the calendar of the Chris-
tian saints. But this, hy-the-hy.

A ship being ready to sail for Lisbon, my pious priest asked my
leave to go thither, being still, as he observed, bound never to finish
any voyage he began. .llow happy had it been for me if 1 had gone
with him; but it was too late new. All things Il'eaven appoints for
the best: had I gene with him, I had never had so many things to be
thankful for, and the reader had never heard of the second part of
the travels and adaentures of Robinson Crusoe, so I must here leave
exclaiming at myself, and go On with my voyage.

From the Brazils we made directly over the Atlantic Sea to the
Cape of Good Hope, and had a tolerable good voyage, our course
generally southeast; now and then a storm, and some contrary winds,
but my disasters at son. were at an end; my future rubs and cross
events were to befall me on shore, that it might appear the land was
as well prepared to he our scourge as the sea.

Our ship was en a trading voyage, and had a supercargo on board,
who was to direct all her motions after she arrived at the Cape, only
being limited to a certain number of days for stay, by charter-party,
at the several ports she was to go. This was none of my businesa
neither did I meddle with it ; my nephew, the captain, and the

supercargo, adjusting all those things between them as they thOught
fit.

E stayed at the Cape no longer than was needful to take
in fresh water, but made the best of our way for the coast
of Ceremandel. We were, indeed, informed that a French
man-of-war of fifty guns, and two large merchant ships,

were gone for the Indies; and as I knew we were at war with France,

I had some apprehensions of them, but they went their own way, and

we heard no more of them.
I shall not pester the reader with a tedious description of places,
journals of our voyages, variations of the compass, latitudes, trade-
winds, etc., it is enough to name the ports and places which we
touched at, and what occurred to us upon our passing from one to
nnothcr. "'e touched first at the island of Madagascar, where, though
the people are fierce and treacherous, nnd very well armed with
lztuccs and bows, which they use with inconceivable dexterity, yet
we fared very well with them a while; they treated us very civilly,
and, for some trifles which we gave them, such as knives, scissors, ctc.,
they brought us eleven good fut bollocks ofn. middling size, which we
took in, partly for fresh provisions for our present spending, and the
rest to salt for the ship's use. ~

We were obliged to stay here some time after we had furnished
ourselves with provisions; and I, who was always too curious to look
into every nook of the world wherever I came, was for going on shore
as often as I could. It was on the east side of the island that we
went on shore one evening; and the people, who. by-the-way, are
very numerous, came thronging about us, and stood gazing at us at a
distance ; but, as we had traded freely with them, and had been kindly
used, we thought ourselves in no danger, but when we saw the peo-
ple, we out three boughs out. of a tree and stuck them up at n distance
from us, which, it seems, is a. mark in that Country, not only of truce
and friendship. but when it. is acceptor], the other side sets up three
poles or boughs, which is asignal that they accept the truce, too;
but then this ion known condition of the truce, that you are not to
puss beyond their three poles toward them, nor they to come past
your three poles or boughs toward you ; so that you are perfectly se-
cure within the three poles, and all the space between your poles and
theirs is nllowed like u market for free converse, traffic, and com-
merce. "When you go there you must not carry your weapons with
you. and if they come into that space, they stick up their javelins and
lzmccs all at the first poles. and come on unarmed; but if any violence
is offered them, and the truce. thereby broken. away they run to the
poles and lay hold of their weapons. and the truce is at an end.

It happened one evening. when we went on shore, that a greater
number of the people came down than usual, but- all very friendly
and civil : and they brought several kinds of provisions, for which we
satisfied them with such toys as we had; their women, also, brought:
us mill: and roots, and several things very acceptable to us, and all
was quiet. and we made us a little tent or but of some boughs of trees
and lay on shore all night.
I know not what was the occasion, but I was not; so well satisfied
to lie on shore as the rest, and the bout riding at an anchor about a
stone's cast from the land, with two men in her to take care of her, I
made one of them come on shore, and getting some hougha of trees to
cover as, also, in the boat, I spread the sail on the bottom of the heat
and lay under the cover of the branches of the trees all night in the
boat.

About two o'clock in the morning we heard one of our men make a
terrible noise on the shore, calling out, for God's sake, to bring the
boat in, and come and help them, for they were all like to he mur-
dered; at the same time I heard the file of fire muskets, which was
the number of the guns they had, and that three times over; for, it
seems the natives here were not so easily frightened with guns as the
savages were in America, where I had to do with them. All
this while I know not. what was the matter, but rousing immedi-
ately from sleep with the noise, I caused the boat to be thrust in
and resolved, with three fusces we had on board, to land and assist
our men. I

We got- t-hc hoot soon to the shore, but our men were in too much
haste; for being come to the shore, they plunged into the water, to
get to the boat with all the expedition they could, being pursued by
between three and four hundred men. Our men were hot nine in all,
and Only five of them had {usees with them; the rest had pistols and
swords, indeed, but they were of small use to them.

We took up seven of our men, and with difficulty enough too, three
of them being very ill wounded ; and that \\ hieh was still worse was, that
while. we stood in the boat to take our men in, we. were in as much
danger as they were in on shore; for they poured their arrows in
upon us so thick, that we were glad to barricade the side of the boat
up with the benches, and two or three loose hoards, which, to our
great satisfiiction, we had by more aeridcnt in the heat. And yet
had it been daylight, they are, it seems, such exact marksmen, that.
if they could have seen but the. least part of us, they would have been
sure of us. We had, by the lightof the moon, :1 little sight of them,
as they stood polting us from the shore with darts and arrows; and
hating got ready our tire-arms. we gave them a volley, that we could
hear, by the cries of some of them, had wounded several; however,
they stood thus in battle array on the shore till break of day, which,
we Suppose was that they might see the better to take their aim at
us.

In this condition we lay, and could not tell how to weigh our
anchor or set up our sail, because we must needs stand up in the boat,
and they were sure to hit as as we were to hit a bird on a tree with
small shot. We made signals of distress to the ship, which, though
she rode a league OE, yet my nephew, the capwin, hearing our tiring,
and by glasses perceiving the posture we lay in, and that we fired
toward the shore, pretty well understood us 3 and weighing anchor
with all speed, he stood as near the shore as he durst with the Ship,
and then sent another boat, with ten hands in her to assist us ; but we
called to them not. to come too near, telling them what condition we
were in ; however they stood in near to us, and one of the men taking
the end of a tow-line in his hand, and keeping one boat between him
and the enemy, so that they could not perfectly see him, swam on
hoard us, and made fast the line to the boat 3 upon which we slipped
out a little cable, and leaving our anchor behind, they towed us out
of the reach of the arrows ; we all the while lying close behind the
barricade we had made.

As seen as we were got from between the ship and the shore, that
we could lay her side to the shore, who run along just by them, and
poured inn broadside among them loaded with pieces of iron and
lead, small bullets, and such stuff, besides, the great shot, which made
a terrible havoc among them.

When we were got on board and out of danger, we had time to ex-

mine into the occasion of this fray; and, indeed, our tsupcrcargo, who
had heen often in those parts, put me upon it; for he said he was
sure the inhabitants would not have touched us after we had made a
truce, if we had not done something to provoke them to it. At length
it came out that an old woman who had come to sell us some milk,
had brought it within our poles, and a young woman with her, who
also brought some roots or herbs; and while the old woman (whether
she was mother to the young woman or no they could not tell) was
selling us the milk. one of our men oll'ered some rudeness to the
wench that. was with her, at which the old women made a great
noise; however; the seamen would not quit his prize, but carried her
out of the old woman's sight among the trees, it being almost dark;
the old woman went away without her, and, as we may suppose, made
an outcry among the people she came from, who, upon notice, raised
this great army upon us in three or four hours ; and itwas great odds
but we had all been destroyed.

One of our men was killed with a lance thrown at him just at the
beginning of the attack, as he sallied out of the tent they had made ;
the test. came off free, all but the fellow who was the occasion of all
the mischief, who paid dear enough for his black tmstresg for we
could not hear what became of him a great while. We lay upon the
shore two days after, though the wind presented, and made signals
for him, and made our boat nail up shove and down shore several
leagues, hut in vain, no we were obliged to give him over; and if
he alone had suffered for it, the loss had been less.

I could not satisfy myself, however, without venturing on shore
once more, to try ii'I could learn anything of him or them: it
was the third night after the action that I had a great mind to
learn, if] could by any means. what mischief we had done, itnd
how the game stood on the lndian'a side. I was careful to do it
in the dark, lest we should be attacked again; but I ought, indeed,
to have been sure that the men I went with had been under my com-
mand, before I engaged in a thing to hazardous and mischievous, an
I met brought into by it without design.

"'0 took twenty as stout fellows with us In any in the ship, besides
the nupcn-argo and myself, and we landed two hours before midnight,
at the same place where the ludians stood drawn up in the evening
before; I landed here, because my design, as I have said, was chiefly
to see if they had quittcd the field, and if they had left. any marks be.
hind them of the mischief we had done them; and I thought if we
could surprise one or two of them, perhaps we might get our man
again, by way ofexehange.

We landed without any noise, and divided our men into two bodies,
whereof the hoatswain commanded one, and I the other. "'e neither
saw nor hoard anybody stir when we landed; and we marched up,
one hody at a distauice front the other, to the place; but at first could
no nothing. it being very dark; till by-anddiy our hoalswnin, who
led the first party, stumbled and fell over a dead body. This made
them halt awhile; for knowing by the circumstances that they were
at the place where the Indians had stood, they waited for my coming
up there. We concluded to halt till the moon hogan to rise, which
we knew would he in less than an hour, when we could easily discern
the havoc we had made among them. We told thirty-two bodies upon
the ground, whereof two were not quite dead; some had an arm, and
some a leg shot off, and one his hand ; those that were wounded, we
suppose, they had carried away.

When we had made, as I thought, a full discovery of all we could
come to the knowledge of, I was resolved for going on board but the
boatswain and his party sent me word that they were "solved to
make a visit to the Indian town, where these dogs, as they called
them, dwelt, and asked me to go along with them; and if they could
find them, as they still fancied they should, they did not doubt of
getting a good booty; and it might be they might find Tom Jeli'ry
there ; that was the man's name we had lost.

Had they sent. to ask my leave to go, I knew well enough .whot
answer to have given them ; for I should have commanded them
instantly on board, knowing it was not at huzurd tit for us to run, who
had a ship, and ship-lending in our charge, and a. voyage to make
which depended very much upon the lives of the men; but as they
sent me word they were resolved to go, and only asked me and my
company to go along with them, I positively refused it, and rose up,
for l was sitting on the ground, in order to go to the hoot. One or
two of the men began to importune me to go; and when I refused,
began to grumble, and any they were not under my command, and
would go. " Come. Jock," says one of the men: " will you go with
me? 1'" go for one." Jack said he would--and then another--and,
in a word. they all left me but one, whom I persuaded to stay, and a.
boy left in the boat. 50 the supereurgo and I with the third man,
went back to the bout, where we told them we should stay for them,
and take care to take in us many of them as should he left ; for I told
them it was a. mad thing they were going about, and supposed most
of them would run the fute of Tom Jeffry.

They told me. like seamen, they would warrant it they would come
off again, and they would take care, d'e. ; so away they went. I en-
trented them to consider the ship and the voyage, that their lives
were not their own, and that they were intrusted with the voyage in
some measure; that if they miscarried, the ship might be lost for
want of their help, and that they could not answer for it to God or
man. But I might as well have talked to the mninmzist of the ship;
they were mud upon their journey, only they gave me good words,
and begged I would not be angry , that they did not doubt hut they
would be back again in about an hour at farthest; for the Indian
town, they said, was not nlmre half a mile 011', though they found it
above two miles before they got to it.

Well, they all went away; and though the attempt was desperate,
and such as none but madman would have gone shout, yet to give
them their due, they went about it as wnrily as boldly: they were
gallantly nrmed, for they hnd every man a fusee or musket, u. bnyonet,
and a pistol; some of them had brood eutlesses. some of them had
hangers, and the hostswnin and two more had pole axes; besides all
which they had among them thirteen hand-grenade": bolder fellows,392 un'ux'rcaes or '

and better provided, never went about any wicked work in the
world.

When they went out, their chief desire was plunder, and they were
in mighty hopes of finding gold there; but a circumstance, which
Lone of them were aware of, Set. them on tire with revenge, and made
dexils of them all. When they came to the few Indian houses which
they thought had been the town, which was not above half a mile ofl',
they were under a great disappointment, for there were not above
twelve or thirteen houses; and where the town was, or how big, they
knew not. They consulted, then-titre, what to do, and were some time
before they could resolve ; for if they fell upon these, they must cut
all their throats, and it was ten to one but some ot'them might. escape,
it being in the night, though the moon was up: and if one escaped,
he would run and raise all the town, so they should have a whole
army upon them: agaix , on the other hand. if they went away and
left those untouched, for the people were all asleep, they could not
tell which way to look for the town: however, the last. was the best
advice ; so they reSolved to leave them, and look for the town as well
as they could. They went on a little way, and limnd a cow tied to a
tree ; this, they presently concluded, would he a good guide to them ;
for, they said, the cow certainly belonged to the town before them, or
the town behind them ; and if they untied her, they should see which
way she went; if she went. back. they had nothing to say to her ; hut,
if she went. forward, they would follow her: so they cut the cord,
which was made of twisted flags, and the cow went on before them,
directly to the town ; which, as they reported, Consistcd of above two
hundred houses or huts, and in some of these they found several
families living together.

Here they found all in silence, as profoundly secure as sleep could
make them; and, first, they called another Council, to consider what
they had to do; and, in a Word, they resolved to divide themselves
into three bodies, and so set three houses on fire in three parts of the
term ; and as the men came out, to seize them and bind them (if any
resisted, they need not he asked what to do then), and so to search
the rest of the houses for plunder : but. they resolved to march silently
first through the town, and see what dimensions it was of, and if they
might venture upon it or no.

They did so, and desperately resolved that they would venture
upon them : but while they were animating one another to the work,
three of them who were a little before the rest, called out aloud to
them, and told them that they had found Tom Jeffry: they all ran
up to the place, where they found the poor fellow hanging up united
by one mun, and his throat cut. There wns on Indian house just by
the tree, where they found sixteen or seventeen of the principal
Indians, who had been concerned in the fray with us before, and two
or three of them wounded with our shot; and our men found they
were awake, and talking one to another in that house, but knew not
their number.

The sight of their poor mangled comrade so enraged them, as be-
fore. thnt they swore to one another they would he revenged, and that
not on Indian that came into their hands should have any quarter;
and to work they went immediately. and yet not so nmdl y as might. be
expected from the rage and fury they were in. Their tirst care was
to get something that would soon take fire, but, after a. little scorch,
they found that would be to no purpose ; for most of the houses
were low, and thatched with flags and rushes, of which the country is
full: so they presently made some wild-fire, as we call it, by. wetting
at little powder in the palm of their hands; and in a quarter of an
hour they set the town on fire in four or five places, and particularly
that house where the lndians were not gone to bed.

As soon as the fire began to blaze, the poor frightened creatures
begun to rush out to sure their lives, but met with their fate in
the attempt; and especially at the door, where they drove them back,
the hontswttin himself killing one or two with his pole-axe ; the house
being large, and many in it, he did not care to go in, but called for a.
hand-grenade, and threw it among them, which at first frightened
them, but. when it burst, made such havoc among them, thnt they
cried out in a. hideous manner. In short, most of the Indians who
wore in the open port of the house were killed or hurt with the gran-
mlo, except two or three who pressed to the door, which the boatswnin
and two more kept, with their hoyonets on the mumles of their pieces,
and dcspntched all that came in their way: but. there was another
apartment in the house, where the prince or king. or whatever he
was, and several others were; and these were kept in till the house,
which was by this time all a light dome, fell in upon them, and they
were smothered together.

All this while they fired not It gun, because they would not. woken
the people first-er than they could master them ; but. the tire began to
woken them fast enough, and our fellows were glad to keep at little
together in bodies; for the tire grew so raging, all the houses being
made of light combustible stuff, that they could hardly hear the street
between them; and their business was to follow the fire, for the sum

execution; as fast as the fire either forced the people out of these
houses which were burning, or frightened them out of others, our
people were ready at their doors to kneel: them on the head, still
calling and hallooing one to another to remember Tom Jeffry.

While this was doing, I must confess I was very uneasy, and
eSpecially when I saw the flames of the town, which, it being night,
seemed to be just by me. My nephew, the captain, t- he was roused
by his men, seeing such a. fire, was very uneasy, not knowing what
the matter was, or what danger I was in, especially hearing the guns,
too, for by this time they began to use their firearms; a thousand
thoughts oppressed his mind concerning me, and the supercargo, what
would become of us; and, at last, though he could ill spare any more
men, yet not knowing what exigence we might be in, he takes another
heat, and with thirteen men and himself comes on shore to me.

He was surprised to see me and the supercargo in the boat, with no
more than two men; and though he was glad that we were well, yet
he was in the same impatience with us to know what was doing; for
the noise continued, and the flame increased; in short, it was next to
an impossibility for any man in the world to restrain their curiosity
to know what had happened, or their concern for the safety of the
men: in a word, the captain told me he would go and help his men,
lot what would come. I argued with him, as I did before with the
men, the safety of the ship, the danger of the voyage, the interest of
the owners and merchants, &c., and told him I and the two men
would go, and only see if we could at a distance learn what was like
to he the event, and come back and tell him. It was all one to talk
to my nephew, as it was to talk to the rest before; he would go, he
said; and he Only wished he had left but ten men in the ship; for he
could not think of having his men lost for want of help; he had rath-
er lose the ship, the voyage, and his life and all; and away he went.

I was no more able to stay behind now than I was to persuade
them not to go: so, in short, the captain ordered two men to row back
the pinnace, and fetch twelve men more, leaving the long-boat at an
anchor; and that when they came back, six men should keep the two
boats, and six more come after us: so that he left Only sixteen men
in the ship; for the whole ship's company consisted of sixty-five men,
whereof; two were lost in the late quarrel which brought this mischief
On.

Being now on the march, you may he sure we felt little of the
ground we trod on: and being guided by the fire, we kept no path,
but went directly to the place of the flame. If the noise of the gene
was surprising to us before, the cries of the poor people. were now
quite of another nature, and filled us with horror. I must confess I
was never at the sacking a city, or at the taking a town by storm. I
had heard of Oliver Cromwell taking Drogheda, in Ireland, and kill-
ing man, woman, and child; and I had read of Count Tilly sacking
the city of Magdeburg, and cutting the threats of twenty-two thou-
sand of all sexes; but I never had an idea of the thing itself before,
nor is it possible to describe it, or the horror that was upon our
minds at hearing it. However, we went on, and at length came to
the town, though there was no entering the streets of it for the fire.
The first object we met with was the ruins of a hut or house, or rath-
er the ashes of it, for the house was consumed; and just before it,
plain enough to he seen by the light of the fire, lay four men and
tin-co women killed, and, as we thought, one or two more lay in the
heap nmong the fire ; in short, there were such instances of rage al-
together barbarous, and of u. fury something beyond what was human,
and we thought it impossible our men could be guilty of it; or if
they were the authors of it, we thought they ought to be every one of
them put to the worst of deaths. But this was not all: we saw the
fire increased forward, and the cry went on just as the fire went on ;
so that we were in the utmost confusion. We advanced a little way
farther, and, behold, to our astonishment, three naked women, and
crying in the most- dreadi'ul manner, came flying as if they had wings,
and after them sixteen or seventeen men, natives, in the same terror
and consternation, with three of our English butchers in the rear;
who, when they could not overtake them, fired in among them, and
one that was killed by their shot, fell down in our sight. When the
rest saw us, believing us to be their enemies= and that we would mur.
der them as well as those that pursued them, they set up a. most
dreadful shriek, especially the women, and two of thcm fell down, as
if already dead with the fright.

My very soul shrunk within me,nnd my blood ran chill in my
veins, when I saw this; and I believe, had the three English sailors
that pursued them come on, I had made our men kill them all: how-
ever, we took some ways to let the poor flying creatures know that
we would not hurt them; and immediately they came up to us, and
kneeling down with their hands lifted up, made piteous lamentation
to us to save them, which we let them know we would; whereupon
they crept all together in a huddle close behind us for protection. I
left my men drawn up together, and charging them to hurt nobody,
but if possible, to get at some of our people, and see what devil it was896 norm-wan: or

possessed them, and who: they intended to do, nod to commend them
off: nssuring them that if they stayed till daylight, they would have
a hundred thousand men about their can: I say I left them, and went
among those flying people, taking only two of our men with me : mid
there was indeed n pitoouu spectacle among them; home of them had
their feet terrihly burned, with trampling nnd running through the
tire, others their hands burned; one of the women had fallen down in
the tire, and was very much horned before she could get out again;
and two or three of the men had cuts in their hacks nud thighs, from
our men pursuing; and another won shot through tho body, and died
while I was there.

l would fnin have learned what the occasion of all this was. but I
rmtld not understand one word they snid ; though, hy signs, I perceiv-
ed some of them know not what was the occasion themsclres. I won
so terrified in my thoughts, at. this outrageous attempt. that. I could
not. stay there, but went back to my own men, and resolved to go
int-i the middle. of the town, through tho fire, or whatever might he
in the way, and put on end to it, cost what it would : necordingly, as
I came hark to my men, l told them my resolution and commended
them to follow me '. when at the very moment came four of our men,
with the lmntswain nt their head, roving over heaps of lunlies they
had hilled= all covered with blood and dust, no if they wnnted more
people to illib'fitlt'i'fi, when our men hullom-d to them as loud as they
could halloo; and with much Kiln one of them made them 11031350
that. they knew who we were, and enzno up to us.

As soon on tho hoatswaiu saw 11:. he set up a halloo like .1 shout of
triumph, for having, on he thought, more help come: and without
wailingr to hear me. " Captain," says he. " nohlo captain! I nm glad
you are come. _: we. are not half done yet : \'illonons hell-hound dogs!
l'il kill us many of them on poor Tom has h.tirn upon his head: we
lure nrm'n to :pore. none of them; we'll root out the very notion of
them from the. earth ;" and thus he ran on, out. of breath, too, with
Iu'ilfl'), and Would not give us leave to speak a word.

At hen, raising my voice, that I might silence him it little, " Durha-
rons dog!" said I, "what are you doing? I won't have one crenture
tmn-hed more, upon pain of deathLl charge you, upon your life, to
stop your hands. and stand still here, or you nro a dead man this min-
me." " Why, sir," says he, " do you know what you do, or what they
have done? If you want a reason for what wehnre done, come hith-
erf' and with that he showed me the poor fellow hanging, with hie
throat cut.
I confess I was urged then myself, and at another time would have
been tin-ward enough ; but I thought they had carried their rage too
farmland remembered Jacob's words to his sons, Simeon and Levi---
" Cursed be their eager, for it was fierce; and their Math, for it was
cruel." But I had now a new task upon my hands; for when the
men I carried with me saw the sight as I had done,I had as much to
do to restrain them an I should lune done with the others, nay, my
nephew himself fell in with them, and told me, in their hearing, that
he was only concerned for fear of the men being overpowered, and
as for the people, he thought not one of them ought to live, for they
had all glutted themselves with the murder of the poor man. and
that they ought to he used like murderers. Upon these words. away
ran eight of my men, with tho Loatswnin and his crew, to complete
their bloody work ; and I, seeing it quite out of my power to restrain
them, came away pensive and sad ; for I could not hear the sight,
much less the horrible noise and cries of the poor wretches that fell
into their hands.

I got nobody to come back with me but the supereargo and two
men, and with these walked hack to the boat. It was a very great
piece of folly in me, I must confess, to Venture back as it were alone;
f :r as it began now to he almost day, and the alarm had run over the
country, there stood about forty men, armed with lanees and bows, at
the little place where the twelve or thirteen houses stood mentioned
before; but by accident I missed the place, and came directly to the
seaside; and by the time I got to the seaside it was broad day. lm-
mediately I took the pinnaee and went on board, and sent her back to
assist the men in what might happen.

I observed about the time that I came to the boat's side. that the
fire was pretty well out, and the noise abated; but in about half an
boar after I got on board I heard a volley of our men's firearms, and
saw a great smoke; this, as I understood nfierward, was our men fall.
in: Upon the men who, as I said, stood at the few houses on the way,
of whom they killed sixteen or seventeen, and set all the houses on
fire. hut did not meddle with the women or children.

By the time the men got to the shore again with the pinnaee, our
me" began *0 flppedr. They came dropping in, not in two bodies as
they "'01". but straggling here and there, in such a. manner that 3
small force of resolute men might hare cut them all off. But the
dread of them was upon the whole country; and the men were sur-
prised, and so frightened, that I believe a hundred of them would
have fled at the sight of but fire of our men; nor in all this terrible898 AM'Ex'rt'Lm or

action was there nmtm that made any considerable defence: they were
so nurprised with the terror of the tire and the sudden attack of our
men in lhu dark, that they knew not which way to turn themselves ;
for if they find one way, they were met. by one party; if back again,
ly another ; so that. they were everywhere knocked down : nor did
any of our men receive the least hurt, except one that sprained his
foot, and another that had one ofhis hands burned.

I was \t-ry angry \\ith my nephew, the captain, and indeed with
all the men. in my mind, hat. with him in particular, as well for his
tit-ting so out of his duty, as commander of the ship and having the
charge of the \oyago upon him, as in his prompting, rather than
cooling, the rage of his hlind men, in so Llnmly and cruel an enter-
prise. My nephew answered me \'e' ' respectfully, l-ut told me lhnt
when he sm' the. hotly of the poor scamaa whom they had murdered
in so cruel and harharous a manner, he was not. master of himself,
neither could he. govern hiq [-:ts.~i(:u; he owned he should not have
(lone so, as ho was commander of the ship: hut tut he was a man, and.
nature. mored him, he could not hear it. As for the rest I f the men,
they were not. snhjuet to me at all, and they knew it well enough; so
they took no notice of my dislike.

The next day we set mil, so we never heard any more of it. Our
men (lill'tu'ed in tho ucenuntof the number they had killed; hut ac-
cording to the. host of their accounts, put all together, they killed or
destroyed nluout one hundred and fifty peolde, men, women, and
children. and loft not a house standing in the. town. As for the poor
fellow Tom J ell'ry, us he was quite dead (for his throat was so cut
that. his head was liztlt'ofl'), it, would (in no service to bring him away,
so they only took him down from the tree, where he was hanging by
one hand.

However just our men thought this action, I was again-t them in it,
and I always after that. time told them God would blast the voyage,
for I looked upon all the blood they shed that night. to he murder in
them ; for though it is true that they had killed Toni Jeffry, yet Jcfi'ry
was the aggressor, had broken the truce. and had violated or de-
hmwhed a young woman of theirs, who came down to them innocently,
and on the. faith of the. public capitulntinn.

Tlm hoatswain defended this quarrel when we were afterward on
board. He said it was true we had seemed to break the truce, but
really had not: and that. the war was hegun the night. before by the
natives themselves. who had shot at us, and killed one of our men
without any just provocation; no that an we were in n capacity to
fight them now, we might also be in a capacity to do ourselves justice
upon them in an extraordinary manner; that though the poor man
h.ul taken a little liberty with the wcneh, he ought not. to have been
murdered, and that in such a \villanous manner; and that they did
nothing but what was just, and what the laws of God allowed to he
done to murderers. .

Ono would think this should have been enough to have warned us
against going on shore among henthens and barbarians; but- it is im-
pnesiHn to make mnnkind wise but at their own expense, and their
experience seems to he always of most use to them when it is dearest
bought.

We were new bound to the gulf of Persia, and from thence to the
coast of Cormnandel, only to touch at Surat; but the chief of the
supercargo's design lay at the bay of Bengal, where, if he missed his
business outward bound, he was to go up to China, and return to the
coast as he came home.

The first disaster that befell us was in the gulf of Persia, where
five of our men venturing on shore on the Arabian side of the gulf,
were surrounded by the Arabians, and either all killed or carried
away into slavery; the rest of the boat's crew were not able to rescue
them, and had but just time to get off their boat. I began to upbraid
them with thojust retribution of Iieavou in this case; but the boat.
swain Very warmly told me, he thought I went further in my censure:
than I could show any warrant for in Scripture, and referred to Luke
xiii. 4, where our Sarior intimates that those men on whom the tower
of Siloam fell were not sinners above all the Galileens. But that
which put me to silence in the case was, that not one of those tire
men who were now lost were of those who went on shore to the mae-
saere of Madagascar, so I always called it, though our men could not
bear to hear the word mmmcre with any patience.

But my frequent preaching to them on this subject had worse con.
sequences than I expected; and the boatswain, who had been the
head of the attempt, came up boldly to me one time, and told me he
found that I brought that afi'uir continually upon the stage; that I
made unjust reflections upon it, and had used the men very ill on that
account, and himself in particular; that I was but a passenger, and
had no command 'in the ship, or concern in the voyage, they were not
ohligcd to bear it: that they did not know but I might here some ill
design in my head. and perhaps to call them to an account for it when
they came to England: and that, therefore, unless I would resolve to
have done with it, and also not to concern myself any further with400 Apvtcrrrtnm or

him, or any of his affairs, he would leave the ship; for he did not
think it was safe to sail with me. among them.

I heard him patiently enough till he had done, and then told him,
that I confess I had all along opposed the massacre of Madagascar,
and that I had, on all occasions, spoken my mind freely ahont. it,
though not more upon him than any of the rest; that. as to having no
C-nmtmnd in the ship, that was true: nor did 1 exercise any au-
thority, only took the liherty of speaking my mind in things whieh
pnhlirly concerned us all: and what. emu-era I had in the \oyage was
none ofhix lmsiness: that l was a. eonsideruhle owner in the. ship;
in that elaim, I had eoneeivedl had a right- to speak even farther
than I had done, and would not he aeeountal-le to him or anyone
else; and hegan to ho a little warm with him. lle made hot little
reply to me at that. time, and I thought. tho atl'air had lwen over. "'0
were at this time in the road at Bengal; and being willing to see tho
plaee, l went on shore with the snpereargo in the ship'n hunt to divert
myself: and toward evening was preparing to go on hoard, when one
of the men mum to me, and told me he would not have me trouhle
myself to come down to the boat, for they had orders not to carry me
on board any more. Any one may guess what a surprise I was in
at so insolent. a message ; and I asked the man who hado him deliver
that message to me? He told me the eoekswaiu. I said no more to
the fellow, hut. hade him let them know he had delivered his message,
and that I had given him no answer to it.

I immediately went and fouml out. the. snpercargo, and told him the
story : adding. whieh I presently ftwesuw, that there would be a mu-
tiny in the ship : and entreated him to go immediately on board the
ship in an Indian heat, and acquaint the captain of it. But I might
have spared this intelligence, for hefore I had spoken to him on shore
the matter was effected on hoard. The boatswain. the gunner, the
carpenter, and all the inferior officers as soon as lwaa gone off in the
hunt, came up. and desired to speak with the captain; and there the
lmatswain, making a long harangno. and repeatingr all he had said to
me, told the. captain in a few \\ ords. that I "as now gone peaceahly
on shore, they were loath to use any violence with me, which, ifI had
not gone on :hore. they would otherwise have done, to oblige me to
have gone ; they therefiu'e thought fit to tell him. that as they shipped
themselves to serve in the ship, under his command, they would per-
form it well and faithfully: hut if I would not quit the ship, or the
captain oblige me. to quit it. they would all leave the ship, and sail
no further with him ; and at that word all, he turned his face toward
the moinmast, which was, it seems, tho signal agreed on between them,
a; which all the seamen, being got together there, cried out, " 0n:
and all .' one and all I"

My nephew, the captain, was a man of spirit, and of great. presence
of mind; and though he was surprised, you may he sure, at the thing,
vet he told them calmly that he would consider of the matter; but
iii-at. he could do nothing in it till he had spoken to mo about it. lie
used some arguments with them to thaw the unreasonablcncuo and in-
justieo of the thin>>; hut it was all in vain; they swore and shook
hands round hefnro his facr, that they would all go on shore, unless
he would engage to them not to sulfer me to comeany more on board
the ship.

This was a hard nrtielo upon him, who knew his obligation to me,
and did not know how I might take it; no he hogan to talk smartly
to them; told them that I was a very considcrnhfe owner of the ship,
and that, in justice, he could not put me out ofmy own house; that
this was the next door to serving me as the famous pirate Kidd had
done, who made a mutiny in the ship, set the captain on t-lItH e on on
uninhabited inland, and ran away with the ship; thatlet them go into
what ship they would, if ever they came to England again it would
cost. them very dear; that the ship was mine, and that he could not
put me out ol'it; and that he would rather lose the ship and the
voyage too than disohligo me so much; so they might do as they
pleased; however, he would go on shore and talk with me, and in-
vited the hoatswain to go with him, and perhaps they might ac-
commodate the matter with me. But they all rejected the proposal,
and said they would have nothing to do with me any more; and if I
came on hoard, they would all go on shore. " Well," said the cap--
tain, " ifyou are all of this mind, let me go on shore and talk with
him." So away he came to me with this account, a littlo after the
message had heon brought to me from the cockawain.

I was very glad to see my nephew, I must confess; for l was not
without apprehensions that they would confine him by violence, set
sail, and run away with the ship ; and then I had been stripped naked
in a remote country, having nothing to help myself; in shortyl had
horn in a worse case than when I was alone in the island. But they
had not come to that length, it moon. to my satisfaction; and when
my nephew told me what they had said to hini, and how they had
sworn and rhool: hands that they would, one and all, leave the ship if
I was sufi'ered to come on board, I told him he should not he concerned
at it at all, for I would stay on shore; I only desired he would take
care and send me all my nocesmrv things on shore, and leave me o
autlit-ient sum of money, and 1 would find my way to England tut well
as I Could.

This was a heavy piece of news to my nephew, but there was no
way to help it hut to comply ; so, in short, he went- on board the ship
again, and satisfied the men that his uncle had yielded to their im-
portanity. and had sent for his goods from on board the ship; so that
the. matter was mer in a few hours, the men returned to their duty,
and 1 Logan to consider what course 1 should steer.

WAS now alone in the most rvmoto part of the world, as I
think i may call it. for I was. near three thousand leagues by
sea farther (d? from England than I was at my island ; only,
it is true, I might travel here. ivy land over the great. Mogul's
Country to Surat, might go from them-n to Bassura ln_\' sra. up the
gulf of Persia, and take, the way (21' the caravans, over the. Desert of
Arahia, to Aleppo and Sounder-non; from thence by sea again to

 

Italy, and so overland into Frame: and this put. together might- at
lea>t he a full diameter of the. glolw. or more.

I had another way before me. whit-h was to wait for some English
ships, which were Coming to Bengal from Achiu, on the. island of
Sumatra. and got. passage on hoard them for England. But as I came
hither without any concern with the English East. India Cmnpany, so
it would lxt'. difficult to go from hence. without, their license, unlers
with great. favor of the captains of the ships, or the Company's factors,
and to lmth I was an utter stranger.

Horn 1 had the mortifieation to see the ship set sail without me; a
treatment 1 think a man in my circunnstzuu-os scarce ever met with,
except. when pirates running away with the ship, and netting those
who would not agree with their rillany on shore. Indeed, this was
next door to it, both ways; however, my nephew left me two servants.
or rather one companion and one servant; the first was clerk to the
punter, whom he engaged to go with me, and the other was his own
gen-nut. l tool; me also a good lodging in the house of an English-
woinan, where several. merchants lodged, some French, two Italians,
()1' "they Jews. and one Engliahmun; here I was handsomely enough
entertained; and that I might not he said. to run rzmlily upon :u-y-
thing, I stayed here above nine months considering what course to
ta .2, and how to manage myself. I had some English goods with me
of value, and a eolmiderahle sum of money ; my nephew furnishing mo
wnh a thousand pieces of eight. and a letter of credit for more, if

I had occasion, that I might not he straitened, whatever might

  

happen.

I quickly disposed of my goods to advantage, and, as I originally
intended, I bought here some very good diamonds, which, (fall other
things, Were the most. proper for me, in my present circumstances;
bUL':\\lSSt? I could always carry my whole estate about me.

After a long stay here, and many proposals made for my return to
England, none failing out to my mind, the, Engli>h merchant who
lodged with me, and whom I had Contracted an intimate acquaintance
with, came to me one morning. "Countryumu," says he, " I have a
project. to communicate to you, which, as it suits with my thoughts,
may, for might I know, suit with yours also, when you shall have
thoroughly considered it. Here we are ported, you by accident, and

the world but men ; why should we he of that numhor i"

I liked this proposal very well, and the more because it seemed to
he expressed with so much good will, and in so friendly a. manner. I
will not say hot- that I might, by my loose. nnhingcd circumstances,
he the: litt--r to embrace a proposal for trade, or. indeed, anything
elm: "11021315, otherwise, trade was none of my element. However,
I might, perhaps, say with some truth, that if trade was not my ele-
ment rounding was, and no proposal for Hoping any part of the world
which I had never seen before could possibly come amiss to me.
It wai, however, some time hefore we could get a ship to our minds,
. ::d n hen we had got a vessel, it was not easy to get English sailors;
that is to say, 50 many as were neeetxsary to govern the \oyage,
and manage the sailors which we should pick up there. After
HHIIO time we got a mate, a hoatswnin, and a gunner, l'iuglhh; a
Dutch earpenter, and three foremasttnen. With these we found we
could do n ell enough, having Indian seamen, such as they were, to
make up.

There are so many t'avellors who have wrote the history of their
Voyages and travels this way. that it would he very little diversion
to anylmdy to give a long aeeount of the places we went to, and the
people. wl.o inhahit there: these things l leave to others, and refer
the reader to those journals and travels of Englishmen, of which
many 1 lind are puldished and more promised every day : it is enough
for me. to tell you that we made this voyage to Aehin, in the island
(thmnatra, atnl from theme to Siam, where we exchanged some of
our wares for opium and mine arraeli; the first a eouttuodity which
hears a great priee among the. ('hinese. and which. at. that- time, was
mueh wanted ther". In a word, we went up to Snskan, made a very
gz-xat voyage. were. eight months out: and returned to Bengal ; and I
vas very well satisfied with my adventure. I ohserve that. our people
in England often admire how oflicers which the Company send into
India, and the men-hunts which generally stay there. get such very
great estates as they do, and sometimes come home worth rixty or
seventy llHNlntllltl pounds at a time; hut it is no wonder, o ' at hast
we. shall see so much farther into it, when we consider the innumera-
hle. ports and places where they have a free eonuneree. that it will be
none: and much less will it. he so when we consider that. at those
plaees and ports where the English ships come. there is sueh great
and eonstant demands for the growth of all other countries, that. there
i~' a certain vent for the returns; as well as a market abroad for the
goods earried out.

In short, we made a. very good voyage, and I got so much money
ivy my first adventure, and such an insight into the method of getting
more. that had I been twenty years younger. I should have been
tempted to have stayed here. and sought no further for limiting any
fortune: but what- was all this to a man upward of threescore, that
was rich enough, and came nhvoad more. in ohedieneo to a. restless
desire of seeing the world than a ooveteos desire of gaining hy it?
And, indeed. I think it is with great justice I now call it a restless
desire, for it was so. When I was at home, I was restless to go
.broad; and when I was abroad,I was restless to be at home. I
my, what was this gain to me? I was rich enough already, nor had
Ianr uneasy desires about. getting more money; and therefore the
prolit of the voyage to me wars of no gr -at. force for the prompting
me. forward to further undertakings; hence I thought. that by this
voyage 1 had made no progress at all, hecanso I was come Lack, as I
might tall it, to the place from whence I came, as to home: "hereas
my eye, which, like that which Solomon xpeaks of, was never ratislitrd
with seeing, was still desirous of wandering and seeing more. I was
come into a part of the world which I never was in befilre, and that
part, in particular, which 1 had heard much of, and was resolved
to see as much of it as I could; and then I thought I might say I
had seen all the world that was worth seeing.

lut my felhmutraveller and I had different notions : I do not name
this to insist on my own. for I acknowledge his \'as the most just, and
hunt suited to the. end of a. merchant's life; who, when he is abroad
upon adventures, it is his wisdom to stick to that, as the best thing
for ltim, which he is like to get the mmt money hy. My new friend
kept himself to the nature of the thing, and would have been content
to have gone like a. carrier's horse, alwavs to the same inn, backward
and forward, provided he could, as he eallcd it, find his account in it.
On the other hand, mine was the notion of a mad ratnltliug boy, that
never cares to see a thing twice over. But this was not all; I had a.
kind of impatience upon me to he nearer home, and yet the most
unsettled resolution imaginahle which way to go. In the interval of
these consultations, my friend, who was always upon the search for
business, proposed another voyage to me among the Spice l>htnds,
nod to hring home a loading of cloves from the )Ianillas, or there-
ahouts; places, indeed, where. the Dutch trade, hut islands helonging
partly to the Spaniards; though we went not so far, hot to some
other, where they have not the whole power, as they have at Btttnria,
Ceylon, d'c.

We. were not long in preparing for this voyage; the chief difficulty
was in luringing me to come into it: however, at last, nothing Olrt'.
offering. and finding that really stirring ahout and trading, the profit
being so great, and, as I may say. certain, had more pleasure in it,
and had more satisfaction to my mind than sitting still, which, to me
especially, was the unhappiest part. of my lit'e,l resolved on this
voyage, too, whieh we made very suceewt'ullr. touching; at Borneo,
and several islands whose names I do not rememher, and came home
in about five months. We sold our spice, which was chiefly clove:
and same nutmegs, to the Persian merchants, who carried them away
to the golf; and making near five of one, we really got a great deal
of money.

My friend, when we made. up this aecount, smiled at me. " "'ell,
now," said he, with a sort. of agreeable imnlt upon my indolent.
temper, " is not this better than walking ahont here, like. a man of noth-
ing to do, and spending our time in staring at the nonsense and iguty
raneeof the pagans 7" 'deg Why. truly," says I. "my friend, I think
it is, and I hegin to he a emu-(rt to the principles of inerelumdising;
but I must tell you," said l, " hy the way. you do not. know what. I
tun doing; for if I mire conquer my l::|eltw:l.i'din':ss, and embark
heartily, as old as l mu, l shall harass you up and down the world
till I tire. you; for I shall pursue it so eagerly, I shall never let. you
lie still."

But, to be short- with my speculations. a little while after this there
cone in a Dutch ship from Iiatauia: she was a coat-tor, not. 3 Eu-
ropean trader, ofalaont. two hundred tons burden; the men, as they
pretended, having been so sickly, that the captain had not; hands
enough to go to sea. with, he lay by at Bengal; and having, it- seems,
got money enough, or lueing willing, for other reasons, to go for lIu.
repe, he. gave. public notice he Would sell his ship. This came to my
ears het'ore. my new partner heard of it, and I had a great, mind to buy
it: so I went to him, and told him of it. Ile Ctmhitlt'l't'tl awhile. for
he. was no rash man neither; ivlli. musing some time, he replied, "She
isa little. too big: hut, however, we will have her." Accordingly,
we bought the ship, and agreeing with the matter, we paid for her
and took possession. When we had done so, we resolved to entertain
the men, if we could, to join them with those we had, for the pursuing
our businew ; but on a sudden, they inning received, not their wages,
but their share of the money as we. afterward learned. not one of
them was to he found; we inquired mueh alnout. them, and at. length
were told that they were all gone together lry land to Agra, the great
city of the Mogul's residence, and from thence to travel to Surat, and
go by sea to the gulf of Persia.

Nothing had so much troubled me a good while as that. I should
miss the opportunity of going: with them : for such a rmnhle, I thought,
and in such company as would both have guarded and diverted me,
wenld have suited mightily with my great design ; and I should have
both seen the world and gone homcward too: but I was much better
satisfied a few days after. when I came to know what sort of fellows
they were 3 for, in short, their history was, that this man they called
captain, was the gunner only, not the commander; that they had been
a trading voyage, in which they had been attacked on shore l:_\' some
ofthc Malays, who had killed the captain and three of his men; and
that after the captain was killed, these men, eleven in number, had
resolved to run away with the ship, which they did, and brought her
to Bengal, leaving the mate and five men more on shore, of whom
hereafter.

Well, let them get the ship how they would. we came honestly ivy
her, as we thought, though we did not, I confess, examine into things
so exactly as we ought; for we never inquired anything of the seamen,
who would certainly have faltered in their account, contradicted one
another, and perhals contradicted themselves; or one how or other
we should have had reason to have suspected them; but the man
showed us a hill of sale for the ship, to one Emanuel Clostershoven,
or some such name, for I suppose it was all a. forgery, and called him-
self by that name, and we could not contradict him; and withal,
having no suspicion ot'the thing, we went. through with our bargain.

We picked up some more English sailors here after this, and some
Dutch; and now we resolved for a second voyage to the southeast
for cloves, &c.; that is to say, among the Philippine and Molucea
isles; and, in short, not to till up this part. ofmy story with tritles,
when what is to come is so remarkable, I spent from first to last, six
years in this country, trading from port to port, haekward and for--
ward, and with very good success, and was now in the last year with
my new partner, going in the ship above mentioned, on a voyage to
China, but designing first to Siam. to buy rice.

In this voyage, being by contrary winds obliged to beat up and
down a great. while in the straits of Malacca, and among the islands,
we were no sooner got clear of those difficult seas than we found our
ship had sprung a leak, and we were not able, by all our industry, to
find out where it was. This forced us to make some port; and my
partner. who knew the country better than I did, directed the captain
to put into the river of Cambodia; for I had made the English mate,
one Mr. Thompson, captain, not being willing to take the charge of
the ship upon myself. This river lies on the north side of the great
boy or golf which goes up to Siam. While We were here, and going
often on shore for refreshment, there comes to me one day an English-
man, and he was. it seems, a gnuner's mute on hoard an Fllglifih
East India ship which rode in the same river, at or near the city 0'
Cambodia; what brought him hither we knew not; but he Comes to
m9,and speaking English, "Sir," says he, " you are ash-anger to me,
and I to you, but I have something to tell you that very nearly con.

I lookod steadfastly at. him a good whilo, and thought at; first I had
known him, hot I did not; "If it very nearly concurns me," said
I, " and not yourself, what moves you to tell it to inc ?" "I am

"but I have a Dutch seamen here with me, and I believe I could
persuade him to tellyou the rest; but there is scarce time for it:
but the short of the story is this, the first part of which, I suppose,
you know well enough, viz.: that you were with this ship at Sumatra,
that there your captain was murdered by the Malays, with three of
his men ; and that you or some of those that were on board with you,
ran away with the ship, and are since turned pirates. This is the sum
of the story, and you will all be seized as pirates, I can assure you,
and executed with very little ceremony; for you know merchant-ships
show but little law to piraten, if they get them into their powur."
" Now you speak plain Englirh," said I, "and I thank you; and
though I know nothing that. we have done like what you talk of, for
I am sure we came honestly and fairly by the ship, yet seeing such
a work is doing, as you say, and that you seem to mean honestly, I
will be upon my guard." "Nay, sir," says he, " do not talk about
being upon your guard ; the best defence is, to be out of the danger;
if you have any regard for your life, and the lives of all your men,
put to sea. without fail, at high water ; and as you have a whole tide

for they will Come away at high water. and as they have twenty
miles to conns, you will get near two hours of them by the difi'erencc

Only boats and not ships, they will not venture to follow you far out
to sea, especially if it blows." " \l'ell," said I. " you have been very
kind in this; what shall I do for you to make you amends'." " Sir,"-
I says he, " you may not- be willing to make me any amends, because
you may not be convinced of the truth ofit; I will make an odor to
I you ; I have nineteen months' pay due to me on board the ship "Hag

Ieousented to this readily, and went immediately on board, and
0 two men with me. As soon as I came to the ship's side, my part-

"but all hands to work, and weigh without losing a minute." He
was surprised, but, however, he called tho captain, and he immediately
ordered the anchor to he got. up: and though the tide was not quite
down, yet a little huid breeze blowing, we stood out to next. Then I
called him into the cabin, and told him the story ; and we called in
the men, end they told us the rest of it : but as it took up a great deal
of timo before we had done, a seaman comes to the cabin door, and
called out. to us that. the cnptuin hudo him tell us we were chased.
" Chased l" says I ; " by what 2'" "By lire sleeps, or honts," says the
fellow, '- full of men." " Very well," said I ; " then it is apparent
there is something in it." In the next place I ordered all the men to
he called up, nnd told them there was a design to seize the ship. and
take us for pirales, and asked them if they would stand by us, and
by one another: the men answered cheerfully, one and all, that; they
would live and die with on. Then I asked the captain whnt way he
thought best for us to manage a fight with them ; for resist them I
was resolved we would, and that to the last drop. He said readily
that the way was to keep them 011' with our great idiot as long am we
could, and theii fire at them with our small arms, to keep them from
boarding us; but when neither of these would do any longer, we
should retire to our close quarters; perhaps they had not materials
to lireak open our hulk-heads, or get in upon us.

The. gunner had. in tho meantime, orders to hring two guns tolreur
fore and oft, out oflho steoruge, to rh-ar the deck, and load them with
musket bullets and emall pieces of old iron, nod what come next to
hands ; and thus we made ready for fight: but all this while we kept
out to sea. with wind enough. and could see the hunts at a distance,
being five largo long-boats, following us with all the sail they could
make.

Two of those honts (which by our glasses we could see were En-
glish) outsnilod the rest, were near two leagues ahead of them, and
gained upon us cousidoruhly, so that we Found they would come up
with us: upon which we fired a gun without hull, to intimate that
they elmnld bring to ; end we put- out n. flag of truce, us a signal for
paz-ley ; but they came crowding after us, till they came within shot,
when we tool: in our white flag. they having made no answer to it,
nnd hung out a red flag, nnd fired at them with shot. Notwithstand-
ing this, they came on till they werenenr enough to call to them with
n speaking-trumpet. which we had on board; so we culled to them,
and bade them lzeep oil', at their peril.

It was all one ; they crowded after us, and endeavored to come
under our stern, so as to board as on our quarter; upon which, seeing
they were resolute for mischief, and depended upon the strength that
followed them, I ordered to bring the ship to, so that they lay upon
our broadside; when immediately we fired fire guns at them, one of
which had been levelled so true as to carry away the stern of the
hindermost boat, and bringing them to the necessity of taking down
their sail. and running all to the head of the boot to keep her from
sinking ; so ehe lay by, and had enough ofit; but seeing the foremost
boat crowd on after us, we made ready to fire at her in particular.
"While this was doing, one of the three boats, that was behind, being
forwarder than the other two, made up to the boat which we had
disabled, to relieve her, and we could see her take out the men; we
called again to the foremost beat, and otl'ered o. truce, to parley again,
and to know what her business was with us ; but had no answer.only
she crowded close under our stern. Upon this our gunner, who was
a very (lexterous fellow, ran out his two chase guns, and fired again
at her, buttho shot missing. the men in the boat shouted, waved their
caps, and came on; but the gunner, getting quickly ready again, fired
among them a second time, one shot of whieh, though it missed the
bout itself, yet fell in among the men, and we could easily see had
done It great deal ofmixchief among them; but we took no notice of
that, wore the ship again, and brought our quarter to bear upon
them. and firing three guns more, we found the boat we>>: almost split
' i.>> pzt- imllar, her rudder and a piece other stern was shot
_ ; so they handed her sail immediately, and were in great.
disorder. But to complete their miafizrtune, our gunner let fly two
guns at them again: where he hit them we could not tell, but we
found the boat was sinking, and some of the men already in the water:
upon this I immediately manned out our pinnaee, which we had kept
close by our side, with orders to pick up some of the men, if they
could, and s". e them from drowning, and immediately come on board
the ship with them, because we saw the rest of the boats began to
come up. Our men in the pinnace followed their orders, and took up
three men, one of whom was just drowning, and it was a good while
before we could recover him. As soon as they were on board, we
crowded all the sail we could make, and stood farther out to sea; and
we found that when the other three boats came up to the first, they
gave (H'l'l' their ehane.

Being then delivered from n danger, which, though 1 know not the
reason of it, yet menu-d to be much greater than I apprehended, I
resolved that we should change our course, and not. let. any one know
whither we were going; so we stood out to sea eastward, quite
out of the course of all European ships, whether they were hound
to China or anywhere else within the commerce of the European
nations.

When we were at sea, we began to consult. with the two seammn
and inquire what the meaning of all this should he ; and the Dutchman
let us into the secret. at Once, telling us that the fellow that sold as the
ship, as we said. was no more than a thief that had run away with
her. Then he told us how the captain, whose name, tun, he told us,
though I do not rememlrer it now, was treacherously murdered by
the natives on the coast of Malacca, with three of his men; and that
be. this Dutchman, and four more, get into the woods, where they
wandered almut a great while, till at length he, in particular, in a
miraculous nmuuer. made his esc-t 10, end swam off to a Dutch ship,
which, sailing near the shore in its way from China, had sent their
boat on shore for fresh water; that. he durst not come to that part of
the shore where the heat was, hut made. shift in the night to take the
water farther MT, and swimming a great while, at last the ship's boat
took him up.

He then told us that he went to Batavia, where two of the seamen
belonging to the ship arrived, having deserted the rest in their travels,

 

and gave an aceuunt that the. fellow who had run away with the ship
sold her at. Bengal to a set of pirates, which were gone a cruising in
her ; am! that they had already taken an English ship and two Dutch
ships very richly laden.

This latter part was found to concern us directly, though we knew
it to be false; yet as InyparI-ner said veryjustly. if we had fallen into
their hands, and they had had such a rreptvssessimi against us before-
hand. it had been in rain as to have defended ourselves, or to hope
for any good quarter at their hands : and especially considering that.
our aceusers had been our judges, and that we could have expected
nothing from them but what rage would have dictated, and an un-
governed passion have executed : and therefore it was his opinion we
should go directly hack to Bengal, from whence we came, without
putting in at any port. "diatom-r ; because there we could give. a good
account- of ourselves. could prove where. we were when the ship put
in, of whom we bought her, and the like: and which was more than
all the rest. if we were put upon the necessity of tringing it before
the proper judges, we should he sure to have some justice, and not he
hanged first and judged afterwunl.

I was some time of my partner's opinion; but after a little more30313108 cnuson. 413

serious thinking, I told him I thought it was a very great hazard for
us to attempt returning to Bengal, for that we were on the wrong side
of the Straits of Malacca, and that if the alarm was given, we should
he sure to he waylaid on every side, as well by the Dutch of Buta-
via as the English elsewhere ; that if we should he taken, as it were,
running away. we should even condemn ourselves, and there would
mmt no more evidence to destroy us. I also asked the English sail-
or's opinion, who said he was of my mind, and that we should eer
thinly he taken. This danger a little startled my partner, and all
the ship's company. and we immediately resolved to go away to the
coast of Tonquiu, and so on to the count of China; and pursuing the
first design as to trade, find some way or other to dispose of the ship,
and come back in some of the vessels of the country, such as we could
get. This was approved ofas the best method for our security; and
accordingly we steered away N. N. ill, kcepingaliout fifty leagues 03
from the usual course to the eastward. This, however, put. us to
some inconvenience; for, first, the winds, when we came to that dis-
tance from the shore, seemed to he more steadily against. us, blowing
almost trade, as we call it, from the E. and II. N. I"..,so that we were a
long while upon our voyage, and we were but ill provided with vic-
tuals for so long a run ; and, which was still worse, there was some
danger that those English and Dutch ships, whore heats pursued us,
whereof some were hound that way, might he got in before us, and if
not some other ship bound to China might have information of us
from them, and pursue us with the same vigor.

I must. confess, I was now very uneasy, and thought myself, includ.
ing the last escape from the longhoats, to have been in the most dan-
gerous condition that ever I was through my past life; for whatever
ill circumstances I had been in, I was never pursued for a thief be-
fore; nor had I ever done anything that merited the name of dishon-
est or fraudulent, much less thieviah; I had chiefly been my own
enemy, or, as I may rightly say, I had been nobody's enemy but my
own; but now I was embarrassed in the worst condition imaginable;
lot though I was perfectly innocent, I was in no candition to make
that innocence appear ; and if I had been taken, it had been under a
supposed guilt of the worst kind. This made me very anxious to make
an exeape, though which way to do it I knew not, or what port or
place we could go to. My partner seeing me thus dejected, though
he was the most concerned at first, hogan to encourage me, and de-
scribing to me the several ports of that coast, told me he would put in
' on the coast of Cochin China, or the bay of Ionquin, intending to go
afterward to Macaom town once in possession of the Portuguese, and
where still a great many European families resided; and particularly
the missionary priests usually went thither, in order to their going
forward to China.

llither, then, we resolved to go; and accordingly, though after a
tedious and irregular course, and very much at 'aitcned for provisions,
we came within eight of the coast very early in the morning ; and
upon reflection on the past circumstances we were in, and the danger
if we had not escaped, we resolved to put into a small river, which,
however, had depth enough of water for us, and to see if we could,
either overland or hy the ship's pinnace, come to know what ships
were in any port theroahouts. This happy step was, indeed, our (le-
live 'anee ; for though we did not immediately see any European ships
in the ha}~ of 'l'onqnin, yet. the next morning there came into the buy
two Dutch ships; and the third, without any colors spread out. hut
which we helievcd to he. a Dutchman, passed hy at about two leagues'
distance, steering for tho coast of China ; and in the afternoon went
by two English ships steering the same course; and thus we thought
we saw ourselves lit-set with enemies hotlt one. way and the. other.
The. place we. were in was wild and hat-barons; the people thieves,
even hy occupation or yrofession; and though, it. is true. we. had not
min-h to seek of them. and, except getting a few provisions, cared not
how little we had to do with them, yet it was with much tlifiieulty
that we. kt'lit ourselves from heing insulted hy them, several ways.
"'0 wore in 11 small river ofthis country, within a few leagues of its
utmost limits northward; and by our hoat we coasted northeast, to
the point. ofland which opens the great. bay of Tonquin: and it was
in this heating up along the shore. that we discovered we were sur-
rounded with enemies. The people we were among were the most
harharous of all the inhahitants ot' the coast. having no correspondence
with any other nation, and dealing only in fish and oil, and such gross
commodities: and it may he particularly seen that they are the most
hat-barons of any of the inhabitants. Among other customs, they
have this one, viz., that: if any vessel has the mistin'tune to he ship-
wrecked upou their coast, they presently make the men all prisoners
or slaves ; and it was not long hethre we found a piece of their kind-
ness this way. on the occasion following :

I have observed ahove, that our ship sprung aleak at son, and that
we could not find it. out; and it. happened that, as] have said, it. was
stopped unexpectedly in the happy minute of our being to be seized
by the Dutch and English ships in the bay of Siam; yet on we did
not find the ship so perfectly tight and sound as we desired, we re-
solved, while we were at this place, to hty her on shore, and take out
what heavy things we hnd on board, and clean her bottom; and, if
possible, to (ind out where the leaks were. Accordingly, having light-
ened the ship, and brought all our guns and other movenhles to one
side, we tried to bring her down, that we might come at her bottom;
but, on second thoughts, We did not. care to lay he): on dry ground,
neither could we find it proper place for it.

The inhabitants, who had never been acquainted with such a sight,
came wandering down the shore to look at us; nnd seeing the ship
lie down on one side in such it manner, and hocling in toward the
shore, and not seeing our men, who were at work on her bottom with
stages, and with their boats, on tho otllside, they presently concluded
that the ship was cast. nwny, and lay so fast on the ground. On this
supposition, they all come about. us in two or three hours" time, with
ten or twcho largo boats, having some of then: eight, some ten men
in n boat, intending, no doubt, to have come on board and plundered
the ship; and if they had found us there, to have carried us own}.- for
slaves to their king, or whatever they call him, for we knew nothing
of their governor.

When they came up to the ship and hogan to row round her, they
discovered us all hard at work on the outside of the ship's bottom and
side, washing, and grm'ing, and stopping, as every seafaring mnn
knou's how. They stood for 9. while gazing at us, and we who were
a little surprised, could not imagine what their design was; liutlJcing
willing to he sure, we took this Opportunity to get some of us into the
ship, and others to hand down nuns and ammunition to those who
\roro at work to defend themselves with, if there should be occasion;
and it was no more than need; for in less than n. quarter of an hour's
consultation. they agreed, it seems, tlnit the ship was rcallya wreck;
and that we were all at work cndezworing to save her, or to sure our
lives by the help of our hunts: and when we handed our arms into
the boats, they concluded, by that motion, that we were endeavoring
to save some of our goods; upon this they took it for granted we all
belonged to them, and away they come directly upon our men, as if
it had been in a line of bottle.

Our men, seeing so many of them, began to be frightened, for we
iay but in an' ill posture to fight, and cried out to us to know what
they should do. I immediately celled to the men that worked upon
the stages, to slip them dovm, and get up the side into the ship; and
bade those in the boat to row round, and some on board; and those
few of us who were on board worked with all the strength and hands
we had, to hring the ship to rights; hut, howmer, neither the men
upon the stages nor those in the. hoats could do as they were ordered,
before the Cor-hit: Chinese were upon them; and two of their heats
l-oarded our longhoat, and began to lay hold on the men as their
prisoners.

The first man they laid hold on was an English seamen, a stout,
strong fellow, who, having a musket. in his hand, never otlbrcd to fire
it, hut laid it, down in the hunt, like a fool, as l thought; but he un-
derstood his business hotter than I eonld teach him, tor he grappled
the pagan, and dragged him by main force outofthcir boat into ours,
where taking him lny the ears. he heat his head so against. the l-ont's
gunnel, that the fellow died in his hands: and. in the meantime, n
Dutehman, who stood next, took up the musket,and with the hntt-end
of it so laid ahout him, that. he knoeked down tive of them who at-
tempted to enter the boat. But. this was doing little toward resisting
thirty or forty men, who, fiaarless, heeausa ignorant. of their danger,
hogan to throw themselves into the longhoat, where we lltlll hut five
men in all to defend it. ; hut the following accident, which deserved
our laughter. gave our men a eotnplute rietory.

thir carpenter lining prepared to grave the outside ofthc ship. as
well us to pay the seams where he had enlked her to stop the leaks,
had got two lcettlcsjnst let, down into the heat, one tilled with hoiling
pitrh, and the other with rosin, tall-1w, and oil, and such stuff as tho
shipwrights use for that work ; and the man that attended the car-
penter had a great. iron ladle in his hand, with which he supplied the
men that were at, work with the hot slntl'; two of the enemy's men
entered the hunt just where this fellow stood, heing in the firresheels;
he immediately saluted them with a ladleful of the stall, hoiling hot,
which so burned and scolded them, heing hall" naked. that they roared
out like bulls, and enraged with the tire, leaped hoth into the sea.
The earpenter saw it, and cried out, "Well done, Jack! give them
some more of it ;" and stepping forward himself, takes one of the mops,
and dipping it in the pituirpot, he and his man threw it among them
so plentifully, that, in short, of all the men in the three heats there.
was not. one that escaped heing scalded and horned with it, in a most-
t'rightt'ul. pitiful manner, and made such a howling and crying, that 1
never heard a worse noise; for it is worth observing, that though
pain naturally makes all people cry out, yet every nation has a par-
ticular way of exclamation. and makes noises as difi'erent from one
"other as their speech. I cannot give the noise those creatures made
a. better name than howling, nor a name more proper to the tone of
it; for I never heard anything more like the noim of the wolves,
which, as I have said, I heard howl in the forest on the frontiers of
Lnnguedoc.

I was ucverhetter pleased with a victory in my life; not only as it
was a perfect surprise to me, and that our danger was innninent he-
fore, but as we got this victory without any bloodshed, except of that
man the fellow killed with his naked hands, and which I was very
much concerned at, for I was sick of killing such poor savage wretches,
(Hen though it was in my own defence, knowing they came on errands
which they thought just, and knew no better ; and that though it may

ness in nature), yet I thought it was a and life, when we must he al-

and, indeed, I think so still, and I would even now suffer a great deal
rather than I would take away the life even of the worst person in-
juring me; and I believe all considering people who know the value
of life would he of my opinion, if they entered seriously into the con-
sideration of it.

But to return to my story. All the while this was doing, my part-
ner and I, who managed the rest of the men on hoard, had with great
I! 'xtt-rity hrought the ship almost to rights, and having got the guns
into their places again, the gunner called to me to bid our boat get out
the way, for he would let fly among them. I called hack again to
him, and hid him not offer to fire, for the carpenter would do the work
without him; but bid him heat another pitch-kettle, which our cook,
who was on board, took care of; but the enemy was so terrified with
what they had met with in their first atmok, that they would not come
on again; and some of them who were farthest otl', seeing the ship
swim, as it were, upright, began, as we suppose, to see their mistake,
and give over the enterprise, finding it wzunotaa they expected. Thus
we got clear of this merry fight, and having got some rice, and some
roots and bread, with about sixteen hogs, on board, two days before,
we resolved to stay here no longer, but go forward, whatever came of
it; for we made no doubt but we should be surrounded the next day
with rogues enough, perhaps more than our pitch-kettle would dispose
of for us. We therefore got all our things on board the mime evening,
and the next morning were ready to sail; in the meantime, lying at
anchor at some distance from the shore, we were not so much con-
cerned, being new in a fighting posture, as well as in a sailing posture,
if any enemy had presented. The next day, having finished our work

within heard. and finding our ship was perfectly heeled of all he!
leaks, we set, sail. We would have gone into the buy of Tonquin, for
we wanted to inform ourselves of what, was to be known concerning
the Dutch ships that. had been there; but wedurst not stand in there
because we had seen several ships go in, us we supposed, but n. little
before; so we kept, on N. E. townrd the island of Formosa, as much
nfmid of being seen by n. Dutch or English merchant ship, as :1 Dutch
or English merchant. ship in the Mediterranean is of an Algerine
Inun-of-wur.

When we were thus got to sea, we kept on N. E. ns ifwe would go
to the Manillus or the I'billipiue islands, and this we did that we might
not. full into the way of any of the European ships; end then we
steered north, till we came to the latitude of 23 deg. 30 nniu.,by which
means we made the island Formosa directly, where we came to an
mwhnr, in order to get water, and fresh provisions, which the people
there. who were very courteous end civil in their manners, supplied
us with willingly, and dealt very fairly and punetnnlly with us in all
their ngreements and bargains, which is what we did not. find among
other people, und may be owing to the reumitm of Christianity which
was ont'e planted here by a Dutch missionary of Protestants, and is a.
testimony ot'whzit. l have often observed, via. : that. the Christian re-
lie'iou ulwziys civilizes the people and reforms theirnnumers, where it
is roeeired. whether it works saving efi'eets upon them or no.

From thence we sailed still north, keeping the coast- of China nt on
equal distance. till we knew we were beyond ull the ports of China
where our l-lnropean ships usually come; being resolved, ifpossiblo,
Lot to fall inl. ~ any of their hands, especially in this country; where,
as our circumstances were, we could not fail of being entirely
ruined.

Being now come to the latitude of thirty degrees, we resolved
to put into the first: trading port- we should come :it; flllll standing in
f:r the shore. n. bout came ofi'lwo leagues to us. with an old Portuguese
1 ilot on board, who knowing us to be :1. European ship. czuue to offer
his service. which, indeed, we were glad of, and took him on board:
upon which, without asking us whither we would go, be dismissed the
bout. he come in, and sent it back.

I thought it was new so min-h in our ('hnice to make the old man
curry us whither he. would, that] began to talk to him about entry-
iug us to the guIt'ef Xanquin, which is the most northern part of the
coast of China. The old mun said he knew the gulf of Nunquin very
well, but. smiling, asked us what. we would do there. I told him w.
would sell our cargo and purchnsc China. wares, calicoes, raw silks,
tea, wrought silks, &e., and so would return by the same course we
come. He told us our best port had been to put in at Mncuo, where
we could not have failed of a market for our opium to our satisfac-
Iinn,nud might for our money have purchased all sorts of China good!
as cheap as we could at Nunquin.

Not being nblc to put the old man out of his talk, of which he was
very opinionated or conceited, I told him we were gentlemen as well.
as merchants, and that we had a mind to go and see the great city of
Peking, and the famous court of the monarch of China. " Why, then,"
says the old man, " you should go to Ningpo, where, by the rivet-which
runs into the see there, you may go up within five leagues of the
great cnnnl. This canal is n. navigable stream, which goes through
the heart ofthat vast empire of China, crosses all the rivers, passes
some considerable hills by the help of sluices and gates, and goes up
to the city of Peking, being in length near two hundred and seventy
leagues."

" Well," said I, " Senhor Portuguese, but that is not our business
now; the grezltqucstinn is, if you can carry us up totho city ofNanquin,
from whence we czm travel to Peking afterward '1" He said he could
do so very well, and that there wus :1 great Dutch ship gone up that
way just. before. This gave me n. litllc shock, for a Dutch ship was
now our terror, and we had much ruther have met the devil, nt least
it'hc had not come in too frightful a figure; and we depended upon
it that a. Dutch ship would be our destruction, for we were in no con-
dition to fight them; till the ships they trade with into those parts be-
ing of great hurdcn, and of much greater force than we were.

The old man found me :1. little confused, and under some concern,
when he named n Dutch ship ; and said to me, " Sir, you need he un-
der no apprehensions of the Dutch; I suppose they are not now at
war with your nntion I" " No," said I, " that's true; but I know not
what liberties men may take when they are out of the reach of the
lows of their own country." " Why," says he, " you are no pirates;
what need you fear? They will not. meddle with peaceable iner-
chants, sure."

If I had any blood in my body that did not fly up into my face at
that word, it was hindered by some stop in the vessels appointed by
nature to circulate it, for it put me into the greatest disorder and con.
fusion imaginable; nor was it possible for me to conceal it so, but
the old men easily perceived it.

" Sir," says he, "I find you are in some disorder in your thought!
at my talk ; pray be pleased to go which way you think it, and, de-
pend upon it, I'll do you all the service I can." " Why, sunhur,"
fluid 1, " it is true I out a little. unsettled in my resolution: at this time,

they pronurod them to do it." " "'hv. then," said I. "they deserve

"they do deserve. it: and they will certainly have it, it' they light

them hack to hack, and set them a. diving, it is no more than they
deserve."

I knew I had my old man fast on board, and that he could do no
harm, so that I turned short upon him : " Well now, senhor," said I,
" this is the very reason why I would have you carry us up to Nau-
quiu, and not put back to Macao, or to any other part of the country
where the English or Dutch ships come ; for he it known to you,seuv
hor, those captains of the English and Dutch ships are a parcel of
rash, proud, innolent fellows, that neither know what Lelongs tojus-
tlce, nor how to behave themselves as the laws of 0 ad and nature direct 5
but being: proud of their offices, and not understanding Ihcir power, they
would act the murderers to punish robbers; would take upon them
to insult men fulvsely accused, and determine them guilty without due
inquiry ; and perhaps I may live to bring some of Ihem to account
for it, when they may be taught how justice is to he executed ; and
that no man ought to he treated as a crinunal till Home evidence may
he had ol'the crime, and that he in the man.

"'ith this I told him that this was the very ship they attacked, and
gave him it full account. of the skirmish we had with their boats, and
how fooli>hly and cowardly they behaved. I told him all the story
(:E'our buying the ship, and how the Dutchman scrred us. I told him
the reasons I had to helievo the story of killing the master of the Ma-
layans was true, as also the running away with the ship; but it was
all a fiction of their own to suggest that the men had turned pirates,
and they ought. to have been sure it was so before they ventured to
attack us hy surprise, and oblige us to resist them ; adding, that they
would have the blood of those men, whom we killed there in just. de-
{mu-c, to answer for.

The old man was amazed at this relation, and told us we were very
much in the right. to go away to the north; and that if he might ad-
vise us, it should he to sell the ship in China, which we might very
well do, and buy or build another in the country; '- and. said he,

where I could find a ship for my turn, or get any customer to huy
this. He replied, I should meet with customers enough for the ship
at Nanquin, and that. a Chinese junk would serve me very well to (:0
hack again ; and that he would procure me people both to buy one
and sell the other. " Well, but, senhor," said I, " as you any they4'32 .\D\'E.\TLTRF.8 or

know the ship so well, I may, perhaps, if I follow your measures, be
instrumental to bring smite honest, innocent men into a terrible broil,
and perhaps to he murdered in cold blood; for wherever they find
the ship, they will prove the guilt, upon the men, by proving that this
was the ship, and so innocent men may probably be overpowered and
murdered." "Why," says the old man, " I'll find out 11 way to pre-
vent that also ; for as I know all those commanders you speak of very

them to rights in the thing, and let. them know that they have been
so much in tho wrong: that though the people who were on hoard at.

turned pirates: and that, in particular, those were not the men that
Ill'ht "out oli' with the ship, hat innocently bought. her for the trade;
and l :un persuaded they will so far helium n.e,as at least. to act
more cautiously for the time to come.

While these thingfi were passing hetween us. by way of discourse,
we went forward directly for Nanquin, and in about thirteen days'
bail came to an anchor at, the southwest point of the great. gulf of
Kanquin; where, by the way. I came. by accident to understand that
two Ihllrh :<<hips were gone the length before me, and that I should
certainly fall into their hands. I consulted my partner again in this
exigeney, and he was as much at a loss as I was, and would very
gladly have been safe on shore ulnmstany where; however, I was not
in such perplexity neither, but I asked the old pilot if there was no
creek or hurl-or whirl] I might put into and pursue my husinens with
tho (,'hinose. privately, and he in no danger of the enemy. He told
me, ill would sail to the southward about forty-two leagues, there
was a little port called (Quinehang, where the fathers of the mission
usually landed from Macao, on their progress to teach the Christian
religion to the Chinese, and where no European ships erer put in; and
ifI thought to put in there, I might consider what further course to
take when I was on shore. Ilo confessed, he said, it was not a place
for merchants, except that. at some certain times they had a kind of a
fair there, when the merchants from Japan came over thither to buy
the Chinese merchandizes.

We. all agreed to go back to this place ; the name of the port, as he
called it. I may perhaps spell wrong, for I do not particularly re-
nmmher it. having lnstthis, together with the names of many other:
places set down in a little pocket-hook, which was spoiled by the
water hy an aceident: but this I remember. that the Chinese or
Japanese merchants we corresponded with called it by a difl'erent
name from that which our Portuguese pilot gore it, and pronounced
it as above, Quinelmng.

As we were unanimous in our resolution to go to this place, we
weighed the next day. having only gone twice on there where we
ware to get fresh water ; on both whit-h occasions the people of the
country were rery civil to us, and brought us abundance of things to
sell to "3,1 mean of provisions, plants, roots, tea, rice, and some fowls,
but nothing; without money.

We came to the other port (the wind being contrary) not till fire
days, but it was very much to our satisfaction; and I was joyful, and
1 may any thankful, when I set my foot on shore. resolving, and my
partner, tau, that if it was possible to dispose of ourselves and eti'ccta
any other way, though not every way to our satisfaction, we would
never set one foot on board that unhappy vessel more; and, indeed, I
must acknowledge, that of all the circumstances of life that crer I had
any experience of, nothing makes mnnltind so completely miserable an
that of being in constant fear. "'0" done the Scripture say: "The
fear of man brings a. enare;" it is a life of death, and the mind in so
entirely oppressed by it, that it. is capable of no relief.

Nor did it fail ofits usual operations upon the fancy, by heighten-
ing every danger, representing the English and Dutch captains to be
men incapable of hearing reason, or of distinguishing between honest
man and rogues; or between a story calculated fort-ur own turn, made
out of nothing, on purpose to deceive, and n true genuine account of
our whole voyage, progress, and design; for we might many ways
have convinced any reasonable creature that we were not pirates; the
goods we had on board, the course we steered, our frankly showing
ourselves, and entering into such nnrl such ports; and ereu our Tory
manner, the force we had. the number of men, the few nrme, little
nnunuuititm. short provisions ; all these would have served to convince
our men that we were no pirates. The opium and other goods we had
on board wonid make it appear the ship had been at Bongo]. The
Dutchmen, who. it was said. had the names of all the men that were
in the ehip, might easily see that we were a mixture of English, For--
tuguese, and Indiana. and but two Dutchmen on board. These, and
nun}; other particular circumstances, might hero made it evident to
the understanding ofnny commander. whose hands we might fall into,
that we were no pirates. But fear, that blind, useless passion, worked
3"")th way. and throw us into the vapors; it bewildered our under-
Etuud'nrfi. and set the imagination at work to form 11 thousand terrible
things that perhaps might never happen. We first suppoeed, us in-' 424 tomorrows or

deed every body else had related to as, that the seamen on board the
English and Dutch chips, but especially the Dutch, were so enraged
at the name of a pirate, and especially at Our heating off their boats
and escaping, that they would not give themselves leave to inquire
n hether we were pirates or no : hut would execute on oil-hand, as we
call it, without giving no any room for a defence. We reflected that
there really was so much apparent evidence before them, that they
would scarce inquire after any more; as, first, that. the ship was cer-
tainly the HUMP, and that some of the seamen among them knew her,
and had been on hoard her; and, secondly. that when we had intelli-
gence at the river of Cambodia that they were coming down to ex-
amine us, we fought their boats and lled ; so tltat we made no doubt
but they were as fully satisfied of our being pirates, as we were. satis-
fied oftlte contrary; and, (181 often said, I know not hut I should
have lteen apt. to have taken those circumstances for evidence, if the
tables were turned. and my case was theirs; and have made no scruple
of cutting all the crew to pieces. without believing, or perhaps con-
sidering, what they might have to offer in their defen

But let that be. how it will, them were our apprehensions; and
both my partner and I scarce slept a night without dreaming of
haltera and yartLarms, that is to say, gihlmts'; of lighting, and heiug
taken; of killing, and being killed; and one nightI was in such a
fury in my dream, faneying the Dutchmen had boarded us. and I was
knocking one of their seamen down, that I struck my doubled fist.
against the side of the cahin I lay in, with such a force. as wounded
my hand grievonsly, hroke my knuckles, and cut and bruised the flesh,
so that it awaited me out of my sleep.

Another apprehemion I had was, the cruel usage we might meet
with from them if we fell into their hands: then the story of Amboyna
came into my head, and how the Dutch might perhaps torture us, as
they did our ectmtrytuea there, and make some of our men, by ex-

retnity of torture, confess those crimes they never were guilty of, or

own themselves and all of us to be pirates, and so they would put us
to death with a formal appearance of justice ; and that they might be
tempted to do this for the. gain of our ship and cargo, which was: worth
four or five thousand pounds, pttt altogether.

These things tormented me and my partner too, night and day; nor
t! id we consider that the captains ofrzhips have no authority to not thus ;
and if we had surrendered prisoners to them, they could not answer
the destroying: us, or torturing us. hut would be accountable for it
when they came to their own country; this, I say, gave me no satis-
faction ; for if they were to not thus with us, what advantage would
it he to us that. they should he called to an account for it? or if we
were first to be murdered, what satisfaction would it he to us to have
them punished when they came home?

I cannot refrain taking notice here what reflections I now had upon
the vast variety of my particular circumstances; how hard I thought
it. was, that I, who had spent forty years in a life of continual (titli-
culties, and was at last come, as it were, to the port or haven which
all men drive at, vi7.., to have rest and plenty, should be a volunteer
in new sorrows hy my own unhappy choice; and that I, who had
escaped so many dangers in my youth, should now come to be hanged.
in my old age. and in so remote a place, for a. crime which I was not
in the least inclined to, much less guilty of.

After these thoughts, something of religion would come in ; and I
would be considering that this heeuwd to me to he a disposition of
immediate Providence, and I ought, to look upon it and submit to it
as such; that although I was innocent as to menJ was far from
being innocent. as to my Maker; and I ought to look in and examine
what. other crimes in my life were most obvious to me, and for which
I'rmidenco mightjustly inflict this punishment on a rctrihution; and
that I ought to nulnnit to this,just as I would to a shipwreck," it had
pleased God to have brought such a disaster upon me.

In its turn, natural courage would sometimes takes its place, and
then I would he talking myself up to vigorous resolutions; that I
would not be taken to he liarharously used by a parcel of merciless
wrctches in cold blood; that it were much hotter to have fallen into
the hands of the savages, though I was sure they would feast upon
me when they had taken me. than those who would perhaps glut their
raga upon me by inhuman tortures and liarbaritics; that. in the case
of the savages I always resolved to die fighting to the last gasp, and
why should I not do so now,seeing_ it was much more dreadful,to me,
at least, to think of falling into these men's hands, than ever it was to
think ofhcing eaten by men? for the savages, give them their due,
would not eat: a man till he was killed and dead, but that these men
had many arts beyond the cruelty of death. Whenever these thoughts
prevailed, I was sure to put myselfintn a kind of fever with the agi-
tation of a supposed fight: mvhlood would lmil. and my eyes sparkle,
as ifI was engagedmnd I always resolved to take no quarter at their
hand-'1: hut, even at last, if I could resist no longer. I would Mow up

the ship and all that was in her, and leave them but little booty to
boast of.
The greater weight the anxieties and pcrplexities of these things
were to our thoughts while we were at: sea, the greater was our antis-
fiuztion when we saw ourselves on allure; and my partner told me he
dreamed he hard it. very hem'y loud upon his buck, which he was to
curry up tL hill, and tound that he was not nhle to bltllld longer under
it: hut that the Portuguese pilot eutno tttzd took it off his hack, and
the hill disappeared the ground before him uppenring all smooth and
plain : tunl truly it. was :0; the)' were all like men who haul a loud
token otl' their books. For my part, I heal a. weight taken off from
my heart that it was not nhle any hunger t i hear; and. no I said chore,
no resolved to go no more to sea. in that thin. When we came on
shore. the old pilot, who was now our friend, got us :I. lodging and a
warehouse for our goods, which, l-y the we}, nun much the btllut'; it
"as a little house, or hut, with n ittt'gt'r house adjoining to it, nil built

The fair. or mart, usually kept in this flare, had been over some

they had bought in China, and were not gone aw ny, having some

though, I must confess, the CUIH't'rt-illll, as they cull it, of the Chinese
to Christianity is so for from the true tenrcrsiou required to bring
heathen people to the faith of Christ, that it seems to amount to little
more than letting them know the name of Christ, and say some prayers
to the Virgin Mary and her Son, in a tongue which they understand
not, and to cross themselves, and the like; yet it must. he confessed

times death itself, with the most violent tortures, for the take of this
work.

tut to return to my story. This French priest, Father Simon, was
nppointctl, it rcems, hy order of the chief of the Mist-ion, to go up to
Peking, the royal seat of the Chinese emperor, and waited only for
another priest, who was ordered to come to him from Macao, to go
along with him ; and we scarce ever met together but he won inviting
me. to go that journey; telling me how he would show me all the
glorious things (21' that mighty empire, and, among the rest, the greatest
city in the "orltl; a city, said he, that your London and our Paris
put. together, cannot he equal to. This wan the city of Peking, which,
I cont't-sn, is very great, and infinitely full of people: but as I looked
on [lane things nilh different. eyes from other men, so I shall give my
opinion of them in a. few \rortls, when I come in course ofn:y travels
to speak more particularly ofthem.

But, first, I come to my friar or missionary. Dining with him one
day, and Leing very merry together, I showed some little inclination
to go with Jim ; and he pressed me and my partner very hard, and
with a. great many persuaeions, to consent. """hy, Father Simon,"
says my partner, "rhould you desire our company rso much? you
know we are heretics, and you do not love us, nor cannot kI-ep us
cI-nzpany with any pleasure." "0,": says he, " you may perhaps he
good Catholics in time; my business here is to convert heathens, and
who knows hat I may convert: you, too 7" " Very well, Father, said
I. '~ no you will preach to us all the way i" "I will not- he troulnlo.
51.1220 to you," says he; " our religion does not divest us ol'good man-
ners : besides, we are here like countrymen ; and so we are, compared
to the place we are in ; and if you are Iluguenota, and I a Catholic,
vi:- may all he Christiana at last; at least, we are all gentlemen, and
we may converse so. without heing uneasy to one another." I liked
this part ofhis discourse very well, and it hogan to put me in mind of
my prient I had left in the Brazils; but this Father Simon did not
come up to his character by a great deal: for though Father Simon
had no appearance of a criminal levity in him neither, yet he had not
that fund of Christian zeal, strict piety, and sincere affection to
religion, that my other good ecclesiastie had.

But to leave him a little, though he never left us, nor soliciting us
to go with him, we had something else before us at first, for we had
all thia while our ship and our merchandise to dispose of, and we
hogan to he very doubtful what we should do, for we were new in a
place of very little hnsiness; and once I was about to venture to mil
for the river of Kilam, and the city of Nanquin: but Providence
sccmed now more \'isihly, as l thtmght, than ever, to eoneeru itself in
our affairs; and I was encouraged, from this very time, to think I
should one way or other get out of this entangled circumstance, and
he hrought home to my own country again, though I had not the least
\'it'"' of the manner. Providence, 1 say, hegnn here to clear up our
way a little; and the first thing that oll'ered was, that our old Portu-
guese pilot hrought a Japan merchant to us, who inquired what goods
we had: and. in the. first place. he l-ought. all our opinnmtnd gave us
a very good price for it. pa} ing on in gold hy weight, some in small
pieces of their own coin. a:.d some in Hnall wedges, of nhout ten or
eleven ounces each. "'hile we were dealing with him for our opium,
it came. into my head that he might perhaps deal for the. ship. too, and
I ordered the interpreter to ptopmo it to him: he shrugged up his
shoulders at, it, when it was first proposed to him ; hut in a few days
after he. came to me, wilh one of the missionary priests for his in-
terpreter, and told me had a proposal to make tome, which was this:
he had bought a great quantity of goods of us, when he. had no thoughts
of proposals made to him of haying the. ship ; and that, therefore, he
had not money enough to pay for the. ship : hot that if I would let
the. same. men who \\ ere in the ship navigate her. he would hire the
ship to go to Japan: and Would send them from thence to the Philip-
pine i~lands with another loading, which he. would pay the freight of
hcfore they went to Japan, and that at their return he would buy the
ship. I legan to listen to his proposal, and so eager did my head
still run upon ramhling, that. I could not but hcgin to entertain a
notion of going myself with him, and so to sail from the Philippine
islands away to the South Seas: accordingly I asked the Japanese
merchant if he would not- hire. us to the Philippine islzu-ds, and dis-
charge us there. He said no; he could not do that. for then he could
not have the return of his cargo : hut he would discharge. us in Japan,
at the ship's return. Well, still I was for taking him at. that prepo-
sal, and going myself: hut my partner, wiser than myself. persuaded
me from it, representing the dangers, as well of the sees as of the

scan. .4.
Japanese, who are a false, cruel, and treacherous people; likewise
those of the Spaniards at. the Philippines, more false, cruel, and
treachcrc us than they.

llut to bring this long turn of our nfl'airs to a conclusion 2 the first
thing we had to do was, to Consult with the captain of the ship, and
with his men, and know if they were willing to go to Japan: and
while I was doing this, the young man whom my nephew had left
with me as my companion for my travels came to me, and told me
that he thought that voyage promised very fair, and that there was a
great prospect oi advantage, and he would he very glad if I under-
took it; but that it I would not, and would give him leave, he \vonld
go as a. merchant, or how 1 pleased to order him; that if ever he
came to England, and I was there and alive, ho would render me a
faithful account of his success, which would he as much mine as I
pleased. I was really loath to part with him; but comidcring the
prospect. of advantage, which war. really comiderablc, and that he
was a young to low as likely to do "'l'll in it as any I knew, I inclined
to let him go; but I told him 1 uould consult my partner, and give
him an answer the next day. My partner and I dist-nursed about it,
and my partner made a most generous otl'or. " You know it lllL": been
an unlucky ship," said he, " and we both resolved not to go to sea in
it again: if your steward" ( so he called my man) "will venture the
voyage. I will leave my share of the vesrcl to him, and let him make
the bent of it: and if we live to meet in England, and he meets with
success abroad, he shall account for one half of the profits of the
chip's freight to us: the other shall be his own."

If my partner, who was no way concerned with my young man,
made him such an ofl'er. I could no less than ofi'cv him the same; and
all the ship's company being willing to go with him, we made over
half the ship to him in property, and tool: a writing from him, oh-
ligiag him to account for the other; and away he went to Japan.
The Japan merchant proved a very punctual, honest man to hun;
protected him at Japan, and got him a license to come on shore. which
the Europeans in general have not lately obtained: paid him his
freight very punctually; sent him to the Philippines, loaded with
Japan and China wares, and a supercargo of their own, who, traffick-
~ing with the Spaniard. brought back European goods again, and a
great quantity of cloves and other spices; and there he was not only
paid his freight very well. and at a. very good price, but not being
willing to sell the ship than. the merchant furnished him with goods
on hi>> own Account; and with some money, and some spices of his own,
which he hrought with him, he went; back to the Manillas to the
Spaniards, where he sold his cargo very well. Here, having got 0.
good acquaintance at. .'lanilla, he got, his ship made a free ship; and
the gnvernnr nt' )lanilla hired him to go to Aeapulen in America, on
the coast of Mexico, and gave him a license to haul there, and to
travel to Mexien, and to pass in any Spanish ship tn Europe with all
his men. He made the "gage tn Acapulco very happily, and there
he sold his ship; and having there also nhtainetl allowance to travel
hy lantl to I'nrtn Ilclln, he tinnnl means, some how or other, to get to
Jamaica, with all his treasure: and ahont. eight. years after, 'ame to
England exeeetlingly rit'h,ef which I shall take. nizticu in its Place; in
the nusantime, I return to our particular ailitirs.

Being new to part. with the ship and ship's company, .. came he-
fnre ns, ot'eonrse, to consider what. rt'eeml 01:50 We. should give to the
two men that: gave us snt'll timely I'.('lll'(3 ot' the nlosign against us in

less: :nnl thert'hn'e, as I had promised to lo grateful tn them, first;
ordered the mnney tn l-e. latitl them which they said was due to them
on lmarul their respective thilzs : ever and ahove that; I gave eat-h of
them a small sum nfmnney in gnhl, which t-nntentetl theta very well;
then I mazln tho linglhlnnan gunner in the ship, the gunner heingr
new nnule seeninl mate and parser; the. Dutchman I made Loatswnin;
so they were both very well pleased, and proved very serviecahle,
being hoth :thle :4 'amen, mil very stunt. fellows.

"'0 new new on shore in ('hina : il' I thought myself hanishetl and

destitute of all manner ot'prnspect- of return i All we had for icwas
this, that in about four months' time there was to he another fair at

sorts of the manufactures of the country, and withal might possihly
find some Chinese junks or vessels from Tnnquin, that would he to he
Bold, and would carry us and our goods whither we pleased. This I
liked very well, and resolved to wait ; besides, M our particular per-
sons were not. obnoxious, so if any English or Dutch ellips came thither,
perhaps we might. have an opportunity to loud our goods, and get a.
passage to some other place in lndia, nearer home. Upon these hopes
we resolved to continue here ; but, to divert ourselves, we took two
or three journeys into the country. First, we went ten tiaya' journey,
to the city of Nauquin, e. city well worth seeing, indeed; they say it.
has a. million of people in it; it is regularly built, the streets all ex-
actly straight, and cross one another in direct lines, which gives the
figure of it great. advantage. But when I come to con-hare the
miserable people of these countries with ours, their faltr is, their
manner of living, their government, their wealth, and their glory,
as some call it, I must. confess that. I scarcely think it, worth my
while to mention them here. It is very observable, that we
wonder at the grandeur, the riches, the pomp, the ceremonies, the
government, the. untnnthctores, the commerce, and conduct of these
people; not. that it is to he wondered at, or, indeed, in the least to he
regarded, hut. heeauao, having a true notion of the harharity of those
etmntrien, the rudeness and the ignorance that prevails there, we do
not expect to find any well thing sofar off. Otherwise, what are their
buildings to the palaces and ro_val buildings of Europe? "'hat their
trade to the universal cmnmeree of England, llolland, France, and
Spain? What are their cities to ours, for wealth, strength, gaiety of
apparel. rich furniture, and infinite variety? What are their ports,
supplied with a few junks and harks. to our navigation, our tnm'elutut
fleets, our large and powerful navies ? Our city of London has more
trade than half their mighty empire; one English, Dutch, or French
man-of-war ofeivhtyguns, would he able to fight almost all the shipping
belonging to China; but the greatness oftheir wealth, their trade, the
power of their government, and the strength of their armies, may he a
little surprising to us; because, as I have said, considering them as a.
harbaroua nation of pagans, little better than savages, we did not. ex-
peet such things among them. And thiH, indeed, is the advantage,
with which all their greatness and power is represented to us; other-
wise, it. is in itself nothing at all: for what. I have said oftln-ir t-hips
may he said oftheir armies and troops; all the forces oftheir empire,
though they were to bring two millions of men into the field together,
Would be able to do nothing but ruin the country, and starve them-
selves, if the)' were to befiiege a strong town in Flanders, or to fight It
disciplined army. One good line of German euirassiere, er of French
cavalry, might withstand all the horse of China; a million of their
foot could not stand before one embattled body of our infantry. posted
so as not to be surrounded, though they were not to be one to twenty
in number; nay, I do not. boast ifl say that thirty thousand German
or English foot, and ten thousand horse, well managed, could defeat.
all the forces of C hiun. And so of our fortified towns, and of the art
of our engineers in mounting and defending towns; there is not a
fortified town in China could hold out one month againstthe batteries
and attacks of an European army; and, at the same time, all the
armies of China could never take melt a town as Dunkirk, provided it
was not starved--no, not. in a ten years' siege. They have fire-arms,
it is true, but. they are awkward and uncertain in their going oil"; and
their powder has but little strength. Their armies are badly discip.
lined, and wants-kill to attack, or temper to retreat; and therefore, I
hunt confess, it seemed strange to me, when I came home, and heard
our people say such fine things of the power, glory, magnificence, and
trade ofthe Chinese; because, as far as I saw, the.)r appeared to he a
contemptible herd or crowd ofignorm-t Sut'tlltl slaves, subjected to a
government qualified only to rule such a people; and were not its
distance inetmceivahly great from M useovy, and the Muscovitetmpirr,
in a manner. as rude, impotent, and ill governed as they, the Czar of
Museuvy might with ease drive them all out of their country, and
conquer them in one campaign ; and had the ('zar (who in now a grow-
ing; prim-e.) fallen this way, instead of attacking the warlike Swedes,
and equally improved himself in the art of war, as they say he has
done : and if none of the powers of Europe had envied or interrupted
him, he might by this time have been emperor of China, instead of
being beaten by the king of Sweden at Narva, when the latter Was not
One. to six in number. As their strength and their grandeur, so their
navigation, commerce, and husbandry, are very imperfect, compared to
the same things in Europe; also in their knowledge, their learning,
and in their skill in the sciences, they are either very awkward or
detective, though they have globes and spheres, and a smattering of
the. mathematics, and think they know more than all the world he-
sides; but they know little of the motions of the heavenly bodies ; and
so grossly and absurdly ignorant are their common people. that when
lthe sun in eclipsed, they think a great dragon has assaulted it, and is
going to run away with it; and they fall clattering with all the drums
and kettles in the country, to, fright the monster away, just: as we do
to hire a swarm of bees.

As this is the only excursion of the kind which I have made in all
the accounts I have given of my travels, I shall make no more such;
it is none of my business, nor any part of my design; but to give an
account of my own adventures through a life of inimitable wanderings,
and a long variety ofchanges, which, perhaps, few that come after me
will have heard the like of ; I shall, therefore, say very little of all
the mighty places, desert countries, and numerous people 1 have yet
to pass through, more than relates to my own story, and which my
concern among them will make necessary.

<<I "'AS now, as near as I can compute, in the heart of China,

' , about thirty degrees north of the line, for we were returned
. from Nanquin: I had, indeed, a. mind to see the city of Pc-
Q) king, which 1 had heard so much of, and Father Simon in)-
pm-tuncd me daily to do it. At length, his time of going away being
set, and the other missionary who was to go with him being arrived
from Macao, it was necesmry that we should resolve either to go or
not; so I referred it wholly to my partner, and left it wholly to his
choice, who at length resolved it in the affirmative; and we prepared
for our journey. We set. out with very good advantage, as to finding
the way. for "e got leave to travel in the retinue of one of their Man-
darius, a kind of viceroy or principal magistrate in the province where
they reside, and who take great state upon them, traveling with great
attendance, and with great homage from the people, who are some-
times greatly impoverished by them, luring obliged to furnish pro-
visions for them and all their attendants in their journeys. That
which I particularly observed, as to our traveling with his baggage,
was this, that though we received anmcient provisions both for our-
selves and our horses from the country, as belonging to the Mandarin,
yet we were ohliged to pay for everything we had after the market
price of the country. and the Mandarin's steward collected it duly
from us ; so that our traveling in the retinue of the Mandarin, though
it was a very great kindness to us, was not such a mighty favor in him,
but was 11 great advantage to him, considering there were about thirty
other people traveled in the pawn manner beside us, under the pro.o

t 4 anvnmumcs or

tection of his rotlnuo ; for tho country furnished all the provisions for
nothing to him, and yet ho tool; our money for them.

We were. twenty-live days traveling to Poking, through a. country
infinitoly populous, hat I think hadly cultivated; tho husbandry, the
economy. and the way of living miserable, though they lnmnt so muuh
of tho induatry of tho peoplo ; 1 my misoraldt', it' compared with their
own, but not so to lhesu poor \vt'vtches, who know no other. 'l'ho

love to keep multitudes of pervanta ut' slaves, width is to the last de-
gree ridiculous, as well as tho contempt of all the world but them-
selves.

I must confess, I traveled more pleasantly afterward in the deserts
and wilderuosscs of Grand 'l'artary than hero '. and yet the. roads here
are well paved and won kept, and very convenient fur travellers; l-ut
nothing was morn awkward to ma than to see Such a haughty, im--

upon these occasions, to t-'ec the beggar-sly pride of these. people. For

stopped at a village about an hour to refresh us. when we. came lny 111deg
country seat of this great man, we saw him in a little placo hetero 115'
door eating his ropast. It; was a kind (If a garden, but: he was very
easy to be seen; and we were given to understand that. the more we
looked at. hint the better he would he pleased. He sat under a. tree,
something like a palmetto, which ctlimtunlly shaded hint over the
head, and on the south side; but, under the tree was also placed a
large umla-clla, which made that. part look well enough. He sat
loiling back in a great, elhow-elntir, luring a heavy, corpulent. man,
and had his moat brought ltim by two women alarms; he had two
more, one of which fed the Squire with n. rpoun, and the other held the
dish with one hand, and scraped otl'wluu, he let. fall upon his worship's

thought. it. holow him to employ his own hands in any oi'those fanzi-

with the clunmy fingers oftlwir servants.

I took this! time to think what pains men's pride put them to, and
how troublesome a haughty temper, thus ill manage-d, must. he. to a
man of common noose ; and leaving the poor wretch to please himseltI
with our looking at him, as it'we admired his pomp, though we really
pitied and eontcmncd him, we pursued our journey; only Father
Simon had the curiosity to May to inform himself what daihties the
country justice had to feed on in all his state, which he had the honor
to taste of, and which was, i think, a mess of boiled rice, with a. great
piece of garlic in it, and a little hag filled with green pepper, and
another plant. whieli they have there, something like our ginger, hut:
smelling like musk. andtastinglike nmstard; all this was put together,
and a small piece of lean mutton hoilcd in it, and this was his wor-
sltip's rcpast: four or live servants more attended at a distance, who,
we supposed, were to eat. of the mono after their master.

As for our Mandarin with whom we travelled, he was respected as
a king, surrounded always with his gentlemen, and attended in all his
appearances with such pomp, that ] saw little ofhim but at. a distant-.12 ;
but. this I ohsened, that there was not a hon-2e in his relinue hat that;
our carrier's pack-horses in England seemed to me to look much
hotter; though it was hard to judge rightly, for they were so covered
with equipagc. mantles, trappings. &c., that we could scarce see any-
thing but their feet and their head.< as they went: along.

1 was now light-hearted, and all my trnuhle and pcrplexity that I
have given an account of being over, I had no anxious thought almut
me, which made this journey the pleasaoter to me; nor had I any
ill accident attended me. only in passing or fouling a small river my
hone full, and made me free of the country, as they call it, that is to436 anvr-zx'rem-zs or

any, threw me in ; the place was not deep, but it wetted me allover. I
mention it. because. I upoilrd my pocket-hook, wherein I had settlown
the names of several people and places which I had occasion to re-
nzemlu-r, and which, not taking tlzzo care of: the leaves rotted, and the
Words w re never after to he read, to my great loss as to the names
of some places I touched at in this journey.

At length we arrived at Peking; I had nobody with me but the
youth whom my nephew the captain had given me to attend me as a
servant, anti who proved very trusty and diligent; and my partner
had nohody with him but one servant, "ho Was a ltinsman. As for
the Portuguese pilot, he being desiroua to see the court, we here his
charges for his company, and to Use him as an interpreter, for he un-
derstood the language of the country, and spoke good French, and a
little English; and, indeed, this old man was a numt nacl'ul haplement
to us everywhere ; for we had not heea above a week at l'elzing, when
he came laughing, " Ah, Senlxor Inglere," says he, " I have tzomething
to tell you will null-to your heart glad I" " My heart glad 1" says I,
" what van that he? 1 don't know anything in this country can either
give me joy or grief, to any great degree." " Yes, yes," aaitl the old
man, in lu-ohen English, " make you glad, mo terry." " Why," said
I, " will it make you sorry i" " lie "use," said he, " you have brought
me here twentydire days" journey, and will leave me to go hack
alone, and "'lllt'll way shall I get to my port afterward without a
ship, without a horse, without pat-mu: .7" So he called money, lwing
his broken Latin, of which he had abundance to make merry with.
In short, he told us there was a great caravan of Museovite and Po-
lish merehants in the city, preparing to set out on their journey by
land to Museovy, within four or five weeks, and he was sure we would
take the opportunity to go with them, and leave him behind to go
back alone.

Icont'esa I was greatly surprised with this good news, and had
scaree power to speak to him for some time; but at last I turned to
him, " How do you know this '1" said I. " Are you sure it is true T'
" Yes," says he; "I met this morning in the street an old acquain-
tance of mine, an Armenian, who is among them ; he came last from
Astracan, and was designing to go to Tonquin, where I formerly
know him, hut has altered his mind, and is now resolved to go with
the caravan to Moscow, and so down the river Wolga to Astracan."
"\Vell. Realtor," says I, " do not. he unmmy about heing left to go
back alone: if this he a method for my return to England. it shall be
your fault if you go back to Macao at all." We then went to con-
sult together what was to he done, and I asked my partner what he
thought oftho pilot's news, and whether it would suit with his af-
fairs ! He told me he would do just. as I would; for he had settled
all his afi'airs so well at. Bengal, and left. his efi'ects in such good
hands, that as we had made a good voyage here, it'ho could vent it in
('hina silks, wrought and raw, such as might be worth the carriage,
he would be content to go to England, and then make his voyage
back to Bengal by the Company's nhipx.

llaving resolved upon this, we agreed that if our Portuguese pilot.
would go with us, we would hear his charges to Mencow, or to Eng-
land, it' he pleased; nor, indeed, were we to be esteemed over gener-
ous in that neither, if we had not rewarded him farther. the service
he had done us being really worth more than that; for he had not
Only been a pilot. to us at sea, but he had been like a broker to "H on
shore ; and his procuring for us the Japan merchant. was some hun-
dreds of pounds in our pockets. So we consulted together about it,
and being willing to gratify him, which was hut doing him justice,
and very willing also to have him with us beSidea, for he was a most
necessary man on all occasions, we agreed to give him a. quantity of
coined gold, which, as I compute it, came to about one hundred and
seventy-live rounds Net-ling, between us, and to hear all his charges,
both for himself and horse, ext-opt only a horse to carry his goods.
Ilaving settled this between ourselves, we called him to let him know
what we had resolved. I told him he had complained of our being
to let him go hawk alone, and I was now to tell him we were resolved
he should not go back at all; that as we had resolved to go to Eu-
rope with the caravan, we resolved also he should go with us; and
that we calle 1 him to know his mind. He shook his head, and said,
it was a hug journey, and he had no pccune to carry him thither, or
to subsist himself when he came there. We told him we believed it
was so, and therefi-re we had resolved to do something for him that.
should let him see how sensible we were of the service he had done
us, and also how agreeable he was to us; and then I told him what
we had resolved to give here, which he might lay out as we would
do our own ; and that. no for his charger, if he would go with us we
would set him safe on shore (life and casualties excepted), either in
)loseovy or England, which we could at our own charge. except only
the carriage of his goods. He received the propotal like a man
transported. and told us he would go with us over the whole world:
and so we all prepared for our journey. However, as it was with us,
so it was with the other merchants : they had many things to do, and
.instead of being ready in five weeks, it was four months and some
days before all things were got together.
It was the beginning of February, our style, when we set out from
Peking. My partner and the old pilot had gone express hack to the
port, where we had first put. in, to dispose of some goods which we had
left there; and l, with a. Chinese inorehnnt whom I had some knowl-
edge of at Nnntptin, and who came to l'eking on his own nti'airu, went
to Nanquin, where I bought ninety pieees of line dannwks, with about.
two hundred pieces of other very tine silks of several sorts, some
mixed with gold: and had all these brought to Peking against my
partner's return; besides this, we bought. a very large quantity of
raw silk, and some. other goods, our cargo amounting, in these goods
only, to about. three thousand lire hundred pounds Htttl'llll"; whieh,
together with t ':\, and some line audience, and three atmels' loads of
luitnn-gs and cloves, loaded in all eighteen 'amcls for our share, be-
sides those we. rode upon: which, with two or three spare horses,
and two horses loaded with provisions, made us, in abort, twenty-six
tunnels and horses in our retinue.

The company was very rreat. and, as near as I can remember,
made between three and four hundred horse. and upwards of one
hundred and twenty men, very well armed, and provided for all
events; for us the Eastern care. 'ann are snbjeet to be attacked by the
Arabs, so are. these. by the 'l'artars; but. they are not altogether so
dangerous as the Arabs, nor so barbarous, when they prevail.

The. company consisted of people of several net-innit: but. there were
above rixty (:fthetn merehants or inhabitants of Moscow, though of
them some were. Livonians; and to our particular eatisfitetion, lire
ot'tliem were Scots, who appeared also to be men of great experience
in business, and of Very good substance.

"'lten we. had traveled one. day's journey, the guides, who we. 0 fire
in number, called all the gentlemen and merchants', that is to say. all
the passengers except the serranm, to a great council us they called
it. At. this council every one deposited n. certain quantity or money,
to a. common stock, for the neeessary expense oi'bnying fi-rageon the
way, where it; was not otherwise to be had, and for satisfiing the
guides, getting horses. and the like; and here they constituted the
journey, as they salled it, \'i7.., they named .aptains and officers to
draw us all up, and give the word of command, in case ot' an attack,
and giro every ntze their turn ol'comn-nnd:'nur was this forming us
into order any more than what we found needfnl upon the way, no
shall be observed.

The road all on this side. of the country is very populous, and is
full of putters and earth-makers, that; is to say, people that temper
the earth for the China--ware; and as I was coming along, our Portu-
gal pilot, who had always somethin g or other to any to make us merry-
c:nne ancering to me, and told me he would. show me the greatest
rarity in all the country, nod that I nhould have this to say of China,
after all the ill humored thingn I had said of it. that I had neon one
thing which was not to be seen in all the world beside. I was very
inuportunate to know what it was: at last he told. me it was a gentle-
man's house luuilt with China-ware. "Well," says I, "are not the
materials of their buildings the product of their own country, and no
it it all China-ware, in it not l"-----" No, no," says he; " I mean it is I
house all made of China-ware, much as you call it, in England, or, as
it is called in our country. porcelain." " Well," any>> I, "such a
thing may he; how big in it'.' Can we carry it in a hex upon a
camel ? If we can, we will buy it." " Upon a camel I" says the old
pilot, holding up both his hnnds; "why there is a family of thirty
people lives in it."

I was then curious, indeed, to see it; and when I came to it, it was
nothing but this: it was a timber house, or u house built, as they call
it in England, with lath and planter; but all this plastering wan really
China-ware. that in to my, it was plastered with the earth that makes
China-ware. The outside, which the sun shone hot upon, wan glazed,
and looked very well, perlieetly white, and painted with blue figures,
no the large China--ware in England is painted, and hnrd an if it had
been horned. As to the inside, all the valln instead ofwainscot,were
lined with hardened and painted tiles, like the little square tilt-.3 we
call galley-film in England, all made of the finext China, and the
figures exceedingly fine, indeed, with extraordinary variety of colors,
mixed with gold; many tiles making but one figure, but joined so
artificially, the mortar lieiug made of [he name earth, that it won very
hard to see where the tiles met. The "001's of the rooms were of the
same composition. and an hard as the earthen floors we have in use in
several parts of England; as hard on stone, and smooth, but not
burned and painted, except some smaller rooms, like closets, which
were all us it were paved with the same file: the ceiling, and all the
plastering work in the whole house, were of the same earth; and,
after nll, the roof was covered with tiles of the same, but of a deep
shining black. This was n. China. warehouse, indeed, truly and liter-
ally to he called so ; and had I not been upon a journeyJ could have
stayed HOIIIO days to see and examine the particulars cfit. They told
me there were fountains and fiahponds in the garden, nil paved on the
bottom and sides with the some; and fine statues setup in rows on the
walks, entirely formed. of the porcelain earth, and burned whole.
A3 min is One of the singularities of China, so they may be allowed
to excel in it; but I am very sure they excel in their accounts of it;
for they told me such incredible things of their perfm'nntnee in
crockery-ware. for such it is, that I care not to relate, as knowing it
could not be true. They told me, in particular, of one workman that
made a ship with all its tackle, and masts and sails, in earthen-ware.
big enough to carry fifty men. If they had told me he launched it,
and made a voyage to Japan in it, I might have said something to it,
indeed ; but as it was. I knew the whole of the story. which was, in
short, asking pardon for the word, that the fellow lied: so I smiled,
and said nothing to it.

This odd sight kept me two hours behind the caravan, for which the
leader of it for the day fined me about the value of three shillings;
and told me, if it had been three days' journey without the wall, as
it was three days' within, he must have lined me four times as much,
and made me ask pardon the next council day: I promised to be more
orderly; and, indeed, I found afterward the orders made for keeping
all together were absolutely necessary for our common safety.

In two days more we passed the great China wall, made for a for-
tification against the 'l'artars: and a very great work it is, going over
hills and mountains in a needless track, where the rocks are impassa-
ble, and the preeipices such as no enemy could possibly enter. or
indeed climb up, or where, if they did, no wall could hinder them.
They tell us its length is near a thousand English miles, but that the
country is five hundred in a straight measured line, which the wall
bounds, without measuring the windings and turnings it takes ; it is
about four fathoms high, and as many thick in some places.

I stood still an hour, or thereabout, without trespassing our orders
(for so long the caravan was in passing the gate), to look at it on
every side, near and far off, I mean that was within my view : and the
guide. of our caravan, who had been extolling it for the Wonder of the
World, was mighty eager to hear my opinion of it. I told him it was
a most excellent thing to keep out the Tartars; which he happened
not to understand as I meant it, and so it took for a compliment; but
the old pilot laughed: "O, Senor Inglese." says he, '- you speak in
colors." " In Colors i" said I; "what do you mean by that?" " Why
you speak what looks white this way, and black that way _: gay one
way and dull another. You tell him it is a good wall to keep out
Tartan-s ; you tell me by that it is good for nothing but to keep out
Tat-tars. I understand you, Senor luglise; I understand you; but
Senor Chinese understood you his own way." " Well," says 1, "son-
her, do you think it would stand out an army of our country people,
with a good train of artillery, or our engineers, with two companies
of miners ? Would not they batter it down in ten days, that an army
might. enter in battalia; or blow it up in the air, foundation and all,
that there should be no sign of it left i" " Ay, my," says he, "I know
tint." The Chinese wanted mightily to know what I said, and I gave
hr... leave to tell him a few daysafter, for we were then almost out of
their country, and he was to leave us in a little time after this ; but
when he knew what I said. he was dumb all the rest of the way, and
we heard no more of his fine story of the Chinese power and greatness
While he stayed

After we passed this mighty nothing, called a wall, something like
the I'iets' wall, so famous in Northumberland, built by the Romans,
we began to find the country thinly inhabited, and the people rather
confined to live in fortified towns and cities, as being subject to the
inroads and dcpredations of the 'l'artars, who rob in great armies, and
therefore are not to be resisted by the naked inhabitants of an open
country. And here I began to find the necessity of keeping together
in a caravan as we traveled, for we saw several troops of Tartars
roving about; but when I came to see them distinctly,l wondered
more that the Chinese empire should be conquered by such cont-empt-
ihle fellows; for they are a. mere horde of wild fellows, keeping no
order, and understanding no discipline or manner of light. Their
horses are poor lean creatures, taught nothing, and fit for nothing;
and this we found the first day we saw them, which was after we
entered the wilder part of the country. Our leader for the day gave
leave for about sixteen of us to go a hunting, as they call it, and what
was this but hunting of sheep _; however, it may be called hunting too,
for the creatures are the wildest and swiftest of foot that ever I saw
of their kind : only they will not run a great way, and you are sure
of sport when you begin the chase, for they appear generally thirty
or fort-y in a flock, and, like true sheep, keep together when they fly.

In pursuit of this odd sort of game, it was our hap to meet with
about forty Torture; whether they were hunting mutton as we were,
or whether they looked for another kind of prey, we know not; but
as soon as they saw us, one of them blew a kind of a horn very loud,
but with a barbarous sound that] had never heard before, and, by the
WW, never care to hear again: we all supposed this was to call their
friends about them, and so it was; for in less than ten minutes a troop
of forty or fifty more appeared at about a mile distance; but our
work was over first, as it happened.

19'
One of the Scots merchants of Moscow happened to be among us,
and as soon as he heard the horn he told us that we had nothing to do
but to eharge them immediately, without lossoftime; and drawing
as up in a line, he asked if we were resolved. "'e told him we were
ready to follow him; so he rode directly toward them. They stood
gazing at us like a more crowd, drawn up in no order nor showing
the. face. of any order at all ; but as noon as they saw us advance they
let tly their arrows. whleh, however, missed on very happily : it. seems
they mistook not their aim, but their distance; for their arrows all
fell a little short of us, but with so true on aim, that had we been
about twenty yards nearer, we must have had several men wounded,

ifuot killed.

lnnnediately we halted, and though it was at a great distance, we
tired. and sent them leadon bullets for wooden arrows, fidlowing our
shot full gallop, to fall in among them sword in hand, for so our bold

Lehaved with such vigor and bravery on this occasion, and yet with
such eool courage, too, that I never Haw any man it aetiou litter for
eonnnand. As soon as we came up to them, we tired our pistols in
their fares, and then draw; but they (led in the greatest confusion
intauinalde. The only stand any of them made was on our right,
where three of them stood, and, by signs, ealled the rest to come. back
to them. having a kind of seintitar in their hands, and their bows
banging to their backs. Our brave. commander, without asking any
lmdy to f--llow him. gallops up close to them, and with his fusco
knot-ks one of them off his horse, killed the seeond with his pistol,
and the third ran away: and thus ended our fight; but we had this
misfortune attending it. that all our mutton we had in elnme got away.
We had not a man killed or hurt; but as for the Tartar-s, there were
about tive of them killed; how many were wounded we knew not;
but this we. knew, that the other party was so frightened with the
noise. ofonr gene, that they made off, and never made any attempt
"In"! US.

We. were all this while in the Chinese dominions, and therefore the
'l'artars were not so hold as afterward: but in about five days we
entered a vast great, wild desert. which held no three days and
nights' march; and we were obliged to carry our water with no in
great leathern bottles. and to encamp all night, just as I have heard
they do in the desert of Arabia.

I asked our guides whose dominion this "as in; and they told me
this was a. kind of border, that might be called no man's land,
being a part of Great Karnkathay, or Grand Tartary ; but, however,
it was all reckoned as belonging to China,but, that there was no cure
taken here to preserve it from the inroads of thieves, and therefore it
was reckoned the worst desert in the whole march, though we were
to go over some much larger.

In passing this wilderness, which was at first very frightful to me,
we saw, two or three times, little parties of the Tartare, but they
seemed to he upon their own nflairs, and to have no design upon us;
and so, like the man who met the devil, if they had nothing to say to
us, we had nothing to any to them; we let them go. Once, however,
a party of them came so near as to stand and gaze at us ; whether it
was to consider if they should attack no or not, we knew not; but
n hen we were passed at Htmlc distance by them, we made a rear guard
of forty men, and stood ready for thmn, letting,r the caravan pass half
2'. mile or thereahouts before us: hut after awhile they marched
of: only we found they saluted us with live arrows at their parting,
0:20 of which wounded a. horse, no that it disabled him, and we left
Lin), poor creature, in great need ofn. good farricr: they might shoot
more arrowv, which might fall short of us, but we saw no more arrows
or 'l'nrtam that time.

We travelled near a month after this, the ways not being so good
11'! at first. though still in the dominiom of the emperor of China, but
lay for the most part in villages, some of which were fortified, ho-
eanm of the incursions of the Tartar>>. When we were come to one
oftlzcsc towns (it was nletmt. two days und a half journey heforo we
were come to the city of Nauru), I wanted to buy a camel, of which
there are plenty to he sold all the way upon that road, and horses
also, such as they are, heeauae so many caravans coming that way,
they are often wanted. The person that I spoke to to get. me a.
camel, would have gone and fetched one for me; but I. like a fool,
must he oflicious, and go myself along with him: the place was about
two miles out of the vill: go, where it. seems they kept the camels and
horses feeding under a guard.

I walked it I n foot, with my old pilot and a Chinese, being very
desirous ofn. little variety. When we came to the place, it was a low
marshy ground, walled round with a stone wall, piled up dry. with-
outmortur or earth among it, like n. park, with a. little guard of
Chinese soldiers at the door. Having bought a camel, and agreed for
the price, I came away, and the Chinese man that went with me let!
the camel. when on a sudden came up five Torture on horseback;
two of them seized the fellow and took the camel from him, while the
other three stepped up to me and my old pilot, seeing as. as it were,
unarmed, forl had no weapon about me but my sword, which could but
ill defend me against three horsemen. The first that came up stopped
short upon my drawing my sword, for they are errant cowards; but
a second coming upon my left, gave me a blow on the head, which I
never felt till afterward, and wondered, when I came to myhelf, what
was the matter, and where l was, for he laid mo tint on the ground;
but my never-failing old pilot, the Portuguese. (so Providence, un-
leoked for, directs deliveraueeu from dangers which to us are unfore-
seen), had a pistol in his pocket, which I knew nothing of, nor the
Tau-tars either; if they had, I suppose they would not have attacked
us; but cowards are always boldest when there is no danger. The
old man seeing me down, with a hold heart stepped up to the fellow
that had struck me. and laying hold of his arm with one hand, and
pulling him down by main force a little toward him with the other,
shot him in the head, and laid him dead upon the spot. He then im-
mediately stepped up to him who had stopped on, as I said, and be-
fore he could come forward again, made a blow at him with e. scinti-
tor, which he always wore, but missing the man, cut hie horse in the
side of his head, out one of the cars off by the root, and a great slice
down by the side of his face. The poor heast. enraged with the
Wound. was no more to be governed by his rider, though the fellow
eat well enough, too, but away he tlew, and carried him quite out of
the pilot's reach and at So .lO distance. rising upon his hind legs, he
threw down the Tartar. and fell upon hint.

In this interval, the poor Chinese come in v. ho had lost the camel,
but he had no weapon; however. seeing the 'l'nrtar down, and his
horse fallen upon him, away he runs to him, and seizing upon an
ugly ill~favored weapon he had luy his side, something like a pole-
axe, but not apt-le-axe either. he wrcnehed it from him, and made
shift to knock hie 'l'artarinn brains out with it. But my old man had
the third Tartar to deal with htill; and seeing he did not fly, as he ex-
pected, nor come on to fight him, as he apprehended, hut stand stock-
still. the old man stood still, too, and fell to work with his tackle, to
charge his pistol again; but as soon as the 'l'artnr saw the pistol,
away he scoured, and left my pilot, my champion I called him after-
ward. a complete victory.

By this time I was a little recovered; for] thought when I first
began to wake. that I had heen in a sweet sleep; hut, as I said above,
I wondered where I was, how I came upon the ground, and what was
the matter. But a few moments after, as sense returned, I felt pain,
though I did not know where; so I clapped my hand to my hesd,and
took it nwuy bloody ; then I felt my head who; and then, in a mo.
ment, memory returned, and everything was present to me again. I
jumped upon my feet insutntly, and got hold of my SWUld, but no
enemies in view; I found it Tartar lie dead. and his horse standing
\cry quietly by him ; and, looking further, I saw my champion and
deliverer. who had been to see what the Chinese had done, coming
hack with his hunger in his hnnd; the old man, seeing me on my feet,
came running to me, and embraced me with a. great deal ofjuy,heing
afraid before that 1 had been killed ; and sreing me bloody, would see
how I was hurt; but it. won not much, only what we call 1!. broken
head ; neither did I often nrd find any great inconvenience from the
blow. for it was well again in two or three days.

We made no great gain, however, hy this victory, for we lost a
camel and gained a horse ; but that which was :emnrknhle, when we
come back to the village. the man demanded to be paid for the camel;
I disputed it, and it was brought to nhearing before the Chincw judge
oflhe place. To give him his due, he noted with a great deal of
prudence nnd impartiality ; and having heard both sides, he gravely
asked the Chinese man that went with me to buy the camel, whose
servnnt he was? "I an: no servant," says he, "but went with the
stranger." " At whose request i" said the justice. "At the stranger's
request," says he. "Why. then," rays thojnstiee, "you were the
stranger's servant for the time; and the camel being delivered to his
servant, it was delivered to him, and he must pay for it.

I confess the thing was so clear, that I had not a word to say; but,
admiring to see such just reasoning upon the consequence, and an
accurate stating of the case, I paid willingly for the camel. and sent
fiu' another ; but you may observe, I did not go to fetch it myselfnny
more, for I had had enough of that.

The city of Naum is a frontier of the Chinese empire: they call it
flirtifiod, and. so it is, as fortifications go there; for this I will venture
to affirm, that all the Torture in Katruknthny, which, i believe, are
some millions, could not hatter down the walls with their bows and
arrows: but to call it strong, if it were nttmcked with cannon, would
he to make those who understand it laugh at you.

We wanted. as I have said, above two days' journey of this city,
when messengers were sent express to every part of the road to tell
all travellers and caravans to halt till they had a guard sent. for them ;
for that an unusual body of Tax-tars, making ten thousand in all, had
sppeered in the way, about thirty miles beyond the city.
This was very had new to travellers; however, it was carefully
done of the governor, and we were very glad to hour we should lune
a. guard. Accordingly, two days after, we had two hundred soldiers
sent us from a garrison of the Chinese, on our left, and three hundred
more from the city of Name, and with these we advanced holdly; the
three hundred Sultllt'rs from Nauru marched in our front, the two
hundred in our rear: and our men on each side ofour camels, with our
baggage, and the whole caravan in the centre : in this order, and well
prepared for luattle, we thought ourselves a match for the whole ten
thousand )lognl 'l'artars, if they had appeared ; but the next duy,nhcn
they did appear, it was quite another thing.

it was early in the morning, when, marching from a welLsituated
little town. called ('hangm we had a. river to pass, which we were ob-
liged to ferry; and had the 'l'artars had any intelligent-e, then had
heon the tin-e to have att'wked as, when the uneven being over, the
rear guard was hehind : hut. they did not appear there. About three
hours after, when we were entered upon a desert of almnt sixteen
miles over, hehold, lvy a cloud of dust. they raised, we saw an enemy
was at hand; and they were at hand, indeed, for they came on upon
the spur.

The Chinese, our guard on the front, who had talked so big the (lay
hefm-e, hogan to stagger; and the soldiers frequently looked behind
them, which is a certain sign in a soldier that he is just ready to run
away. My old pilot was of my mind: and, heing near me, called
out, "Senhor high-so," says he, " those fellows must he encouraged,
or they will rain as all j, for if the 'l'artars come on, they will never
stand it." " I am of your mind," said I ; " but what. must he done i"
" Done !" said he, "let fifty of our men advance, and flank them on

aeh wing, and encourage them; and they will fight like brave fel-
lows in hrave company ; but, without, this, they will every man turn
his hack. Immediately I rode up to oar leader. and told him, who
was exactly ofour mind; and accordingly fifty of us marched to the
right. wing. and fifty to the left, and the rest made a line of rescue;
and so we innrehed, leaving the last. two hundred men to make a body
hy themselves, and to guard the camels; only that, if need were, they
should send a. hundred men to assist the last fifty.

In a word, the Tar-tars came on, and an innumerable company they
were; how many we could not. tell, but ten thousand, we thought, was
the least: a party if them came on first and viewed our posture, tra-
versing the ground in the front of our line: and, as we found them
within gun-shot, our leader ordered the two wings to advance swiftly,
and give them a salvo On each wing with their shot, which was done,-
but Lacy went oil, and I suppose hack, to give an account of the re-
ception they were likely to meet with 5 and, indeed, that salute ehyyed
their stomachs, for they immediately halted, stood awhile to consider
of it, and wheeling off to the left, they gave over their design, and
said no more to us for that time; which was very ngreealule to our
circumstances, which were but very indiil'ereut for a battle with such
a number.

Two days after we came to tho city of Nana, or Nauru ; we thanked
the governor for his care of us. and collected to the valuoof a hundred
crown, or thereahouts, which he gave to the soldiers sent to guard on;
and here we rented one day. This is a garrison, indeed, and there
were nine hundred soldiers kept there ; hat the reason of it. was, that
formerly the .'luscorite frontiers lay nearer to them than they now do,
the )lllscovitea having abandoned that part of the country, which lies
from this city west for ahout two hundred miles, as desolate and unlit;
for use; and more especially heng so very remote, and so dillieult. to
send lroopa thither for itstlcl'enec ; for we had yet above two thousand
mil-H to Museovy,properly so called.

After this we passed several great rivers, and two dreadful deserts;
one of which we were sixtecndayn passing over: and which, as I said,
was to he called no man's land : and on the 13th of April, we came to
the frontiers of the Muscovite dominions. I think the first town, or
fortress, whichever it may he called, that helonged to the Czar of
Masonry, was callezl Argonn, being on the west side of the river Ar-
guna.

1 could not hot discover an infinite satisfaction that. I was so soon
arrived in. as I called it, a Christian country, or, at least, in a com try
governed by Christians; for though the Museovites do, in my opinion,
hut just. dederve the name of ('hrhtiana yet. such they pretend to be
and are very devout in their way. It would certainly occur to any
man who travels the world as l have done, and who had any power
of reflection, what a Messing it is to he hrought. into the world where
the name of God and Redeemer is known, adored and worshipped;
and not where the people, given up hy Heaven to strong delusions,
worship the devil, and prostrate themselves to stocks and stones ;
worship monsters, elements, horridehaped animals, and statutes or
images ofmonstern. Not a town or city we passed through but had
their pagoda, their idols, and their temples, and ignorant people wor-
Fhiphtg cren the works of their own hands. Now, we came where, at
least, a face of the Christian worship appeared ; where the knee was
bowed to Jesus; and whether ignorantly or not, 5.et the Christian re-
ligiun was owned, and the name of the true God was called upon and
adored, audit made my soul rejoice to see it. I saluted the brave
Scots merchant I mentioucd above with my first acknowledgment of
this; and taking him by the hand, I said to him, "Blessed be God,
we are once again among Christians." He smiled, and answered,
"' Do not rejoice too soon, countryman ; these Muswrites are but an
Odd sort of Christians; and but for the name of it, you may see very
little of the substance for some months farther of our journey."
" Well," says I, " but still it is better than paganism and worshiping
ofderils." """hy, I will tell you," says he, "except the Runsian
soldier in the garrisons, and a few of the inhabitants of the cities upon
the road, all the rest ot'this country, for above a thousand miles farther,
is inhabited by the worst and most ignorant of pagans ; and so, indeed,
we found it.

B were now launched into the greatest piece of solid earth,
if I understand anything of the surface of the globe, that:
is to be found in any part of the world; we had, at least,
twelve thousand miles to the sea, eastward 5 two thousand
to the bottom of the Baltic sea, westward; and above three thousand,
irwe left that sea and went on west to the British and French chan-
nels; we had full five thousand miles to the Indian or Persian sea,
south; and about eight hundred to the Frozen sea, north. Nay, if
Sullle people maybe believed, there might be no sea, northeast, till we
came round the poles, and consequently into the northwest, and so had
a continent of land into America, the Lord knows where; thoughI
could give some reasons why I believed that to be a. mistake.

As we entered into the Museovite dominions a good while before we
came to any 0 nsiderablo towns, we had nothing to observe there but
this: first, that all the rivers run to the east, as I understood by theROBINSON 0812803. 449

chm-ta, which some in our caravan had with them, it was plain all
those rivers ran into the great river Yamour, or Amour ; which river,
in: the natural course of it, must run into the East, sea, or Chinese
deem. The story they tell us, that, the month of this river is choked
up with hulrushes of a. monstrous growth. \'iz.: three feet about, and
twenty or thirty feet, high, I must he allowed to say, I believe nothing
1 "fit; hut, as its navigation is of no use, hceause there is no trade that
way, the thrtars, to whom it. alone belongs, dealing in nothing but
cattle, so nohody, that ererI heard of, has been curious enough either
to go down to the month ofit in boats, or come up to the mouth of it
in ships, as fa ~ as I can find ; hot this is certain, that this river run-
ning east, in the latitude of about fifty 'degrees, carries a vast con-
course of rivers along with it, and finds an ocean to empty itself in
that latitude; so we are sure of sea. there.

Some leagues to the north of this river there are several consider-
nhlc rivers, whme streams run as due in rth as the Ynmoor runs cast,
and these are all found to join their wamrs with the great- river Tartar-
us, named so from the northernmat nations of the lingul Tat-tars;
who, as the Chinese say, Were the first Tat-tars in the world ; and
who, as our geographers allege, are the Gog and Hugo; mentioned in
sacred story. These rivers running all northward. as well as all the
other rivers I am yet to speak of, make it evident that the northern
ocean hounds the had also on that aide ; so :hstt. it does not seem TSP
t-ional in the least to think that the land can extend itself to join with
America on that side, or that there is not a communication hetWeen
the northern and eastern ocean ; hut- ( f this I shall say no more; it
was my observation at that time, and therefore I take not-ice of it in
this place.

We new advanced from the river Arguna by easy and moderate
journeys, and were very visibly ohiiged to the care the Czar of Mas-
cox'y has taken to have cities and towns built in as many places as it
is possilale to place them, where his soldiers hoop garrison, something
like the stationary soldiers placed by the Romans in the remotest
mmntrys eftheir empire; some of which that I had read of were
l-laconl in Britain, for the security of commerce, and for the lodging
travelers and thus it was here; for wherever we came, though at
thete towns and stations the garrisons and governors were Russian
and professed Christians, yet the inhabitants were mere pagans: sac-
rificing to idols, and worshiping the sun, moon, and stars, "T "n "'0
hast ofhearen; and not only so, but were, of all the heathen: and
pagans that ever I met with, the most barbarous, except only that they
did not eat men's flesh, as our savages of America did.
Some instances of this we met within the country hot-ween Argon>>,
where we. enter the Mnsmritc tlmninions, and a city of 'l'au'tars an d
Russians together, called Net-tzittskoi, in which is a continued desert

This scare. Et'nw was not up at the outer side of the filing! ; and

l coufi'ss. I was more unwed at their stupidity and hrutish worship
ofa hnhgnhlin than ever l was at. anything in my life: to see God's
most glorious and host. creature. to whom he had granted so many
advantages, even by creation allure tho rest of the Works of his
hands, vested with. a reasonable soul, and that soul adorned with
faculties and capacities adopted both to honor his Maker, and be
honored by himl sunk and degenerated to a degree so very stupid
ms to prortmto itrelf to u frightful nothing, n. more imaginary ob-
ject, drew-ed up by themselves, and made terrible to themselves hy
their own emxtrivanee, adorned only with eloots and rugs; and that
this should he the ell'eet of mere ignorance, wrought up into hellish
devotion by the devil himself; who, envying to his Maker the homage
nnd :uloration of his creatures, had deluded them into sueh sordid and
hrutish things on one would think should shoe}: nature itself!

lint what hignitied all the untoni>lnuent and reflection of thoughts;
thus it wax, and I saw it before my eyes, and there wan no room to
wonder at it, or think it. impossible; nll my admiration turned to
rage. and I rode up to the image or monster, call it. what you will,
and with my sword made a tatroke at the hounet that won on its: head,
and cut it. in two: and one of our men that was with me tool; hold of
the sheep-skin that, covered it, and pulled at it; when, hehold, amoat
hideous outcry nod howling ran through the. village, and two or three
hundred people eanm ahout my euro, so that I won glad to scour for
it, for we now some had howe and arrows; but, I resolved from that
moment to visit them again.

Our caravan rented three nights at. the town, which was nhout four
miles oil; in order to provide mono. horses which they wanted, Heveral
of the horses having heen lamed and jaded with the haduesn of the
way. and longmaroh over the la>t desert; so we had some leisure
here. to put my design in execution. I eonnnunieated my design to
the Sootn merchant of Mon-row, of \\ hum emu-age I had an ..ei:~nt les-
timony; I told him what. I had heel). and with whatindignation Iliad
since thought that human nature eould he so degenerate; l told him,
ifl could get. hut. four or live men well armed, to go with me, I was
resolved to go and destroy that vile, ahrueinahle idol, and let them
We that, it had no power to help itself: and consequently eould not
he :m ohjeet of worship, or to he prayed to, much 1055 help them that
offered merifieefi to it.

[lo laughed at rum--says he, " Your zeal may he good, but what
do you propose to yourself by it 2'" " Propose!" said I; " to vindi-
eate the. honor of God, which is insulted by this devil-worship." " But
how will it vindicate, the honor of God," said he, "while the penplo
will not he ahio to lanow what you mean hy it, unless ~vou could
speak to them and tell them so ? And then they will fight you, and
heat you too, I'll assure you; for they are desperate fellows, and
that. especially in defense of their idolatry." "Can we not," said I,
u do it in the night, and then leave them the reasons and the causes in
writing in their own language 't" "' Writing?" said he; " why there
is not a. man in live nations of them that, knows anything of a letter,
or how to read a word any way." " Wrotuhod ignorance !"' said 1 to
him; " however, 1 have a great. mind to do it; perhaps nature. may
draw inferences from it to them, to let them see how luutish they are'
to worship sueh horrid things." " Look you, sir," said he, " if your
real prompts you to it. so warmly, you must do it; hut, in the next
plat-e, i would have you eonsidor. these wild nations of people are
subjected hy foree. to the Czar ol' Museovy's dominion, aml you do

Nertzinsltoi, and demaiid satislhetiou; and if ho cannot. give them
satisfaetiou, it is ten to one hot they revolt: and it. will occasion a
new war with all the. 'l'artars in tho eouatry."

'i'his, l eoufess, put new thoughts into my head for awhile, hat I
harped upon the. same. string still: and all that. day l was uneasy to
put my projeet in exeeutinu. Towards the. evening: the. Seots mer-
ehant met me. by aeeident in our walk about the. town. and de>iretl to

speak with mo ; " l lielieVe."

so id he, " l have put. you otl' your good
design: l luuo been a little. eoneernetl about it sineo: for l ahhor
idolatry as tnueh as you e:m do." "'l'ruly," said I, " you have put it

my tlzouyhts; and l helieve. I shall do it. hol'ore I quit this plaee,
though i were to he delivered up to them for satisl'atttitm." "No
no," said he: " God forbid they should deliver you up to sueh a crew
of monsters! They shall not do that. neither: that Would he mur-
dering; you indeed." "Why." said 1: "how would they use me?"
" l'se. you l" said he: " I'll tell you how they served a poor lossiau
who atl'routed them in their \vorship, just as you did, and uhom they
took prisoner, after they had lamed him with an arrow, that. he could
not run away: they took him and stripped him stark-mtked, and set
him upon tho top of tho itlolqnonster. and stood all round him, and
shot as many arrows into him as would stick over his whole. holy;
and then they hnrnt him, and all the. arrows stiekiog in him, Mia
sat-i-itiee to tho idol." " And was this the same idol ?" said I. "Yes,"
said he, " the. very 'ame." " Well." said I, '- I will tell you a. story,"
so [ related the story of our men at Madagascar. and how they hurnt
and sauked tho village there, and killed man, woman, and child, for
their murdering one. of our men. just as it. is related before; and I
added. that I thought: we ought. to do so to this village.

110 listened very attentively to the story; but when I talked of
'loing no to thnt village, snid he, " you mistake very much: it. was
not Lois village, it "'st nlnmst u hundred miles iium this place; hut
it was the some idol, for they carry him niiout- in lu'tuzt'Shiun nll ore):
the emu-dry." " Well," mid l, " then that. idol ought to be punished
for it; nnd it shall," said 1, " if l "H: this night. out."

In it word, tinding mo rcwlutc, he liked the design, and told me I
should not go alone, but he wunht go with me. but he would 5%" first

However, upon second thoughts, wo were \nlling to delay it till the
next night, because, the cnmvun heing to not forward in the morning,
we supposed tho governor could not. pretend to give them nny notin-
fnution upon us when we were ontot' his power. The Scots merchant,
n24 steady in his rosolut-ion for tho enterprise, its hold in executing,
brought nm a 'l'nrtnr'n roho or gown ofblieep-skinu,nm1 n honnnt,
with u how nnd :u-rmrlg and had provided the mum! for himself and
his countryman, that the people, if they saw on, should not determine
who we were.

All the first night we spent in mixing up some. comhnstihlo matter
with uquu \'itau. gunpowder, nnd such other nutleriuls us we eould yet;
and, huving it good quantity of tar in it little not, nhout an hour :d'tcr
night we set out upon our expedition.

We come. to the place nhont eleven o'eloek at night, and found that
the people hznl not the lemt jealousy of danger attending their idol.
The night was cloudy; yet the moon gore ua light enough In one that.
tho idol stood just in tho some poxturn nnd place that it did hefuro.
[The people, seemed to he all (it. their rest; only, that in tho grent hot,
or tent, us we culled it, when: we Fllw the three priests \rhom "'0
mistook for butchers, we saw at light; and going up close. to the door,
we heard people talking as if there were five or six of them; we
wucludod, therefore, that if we net wildfire to the idol, these men
would come out immediately, and run up to the place to rescue it
from the destruction that we intended for it; and what to do with
them we knew not. Once we thought ofearrying it away and setting
fire to it at a distance, hut when we came. to handle it, we found it too
bulky for our carriage; so we were at a lost! again. The second
Scotsman was for setting fire to the tent. or hut, and knocking the
creatures that were there on the head, when they came out; but. I
Could not join with that; I was against, killing them, if it. were pos-
sible to avoid it " Well, then," says the Scots merchant, "I will tell
you what we will do: we will try to make. thent prisoners, tie their
hands, and make them stand and EN! their idol destroyed."

As it happened, we had twine t.r paeh'titt'eatl enough about us,
which we used to tie. our iii-clocks altogether with : so we resolved to
attack these people first, and with as little noise as we could. The
first thing we did we knocked at. the door, when. one of the priests
coming to it, we immediately seized upon him, stopped his mouth, and
tied his hands hehind him. and led him to the idol, where we gagged
him that he. might not make a noise. tied his feet also together, and
left. him on the ground.

Two of us then waited at the door, expecting that. another thltl
emne out, to set'. what the. matter was: hut we waited so long till the
third man came hack to us: and then nobody Coming out, we knocked
again gently, and immediately out came two more, and we served
them just in the same manner, hut were ohliged to go all with them,
and lay them down by the idol some distance from one another;
when. going hack. we. found two more were come out to the door, and
a third stood hehind them within the door. We seized the two, and
immediately tied them, when the third stepping hack, and crying out,
my Scots merchant went in after him, taking out a emnposition we
had made, that would only smoke and stink, he set fire to it and threw
it in among them; hy that time the other Scotsman and my man,
t:tkin;,,r charge of the two men already hound, nnd tied together also
by the arm, led them away to the idol, and left them there to see if
i-ltrlt' idol would relieve them, making haste hack to us.

When the force we had thrown in had filled the hut with so much
snmkc that they were almost sufi'oeated, we then threw a small leather
hag of another kind which flamed like a candle, and following; it in,
we found there were but four people, and, as we supposed, had been
about some of their diabolical sacrifices. They appeared, in short,
frightened to death, at. least so as to sit trembling and stupid, and not
able to speak neither, for the smoke.
In a word, we took them, bound them as we had done the others,
and all without any noise. I should have said we brought them out
of the house, or but, first; for indeed we were not able to hear the
smoke any more than they were. When we had done this, we can ltd
them altogether to the idol: when we came there we fell to work
with him; and first we dauhed him all over, and his robes also, with
tor, and such other atufi' as we had, which was tallow mixed with
brimstone : then we stopped his eyes and ours and mouth full of gun-
powder; then we wrapped up a. great piece of wildfire in his bonnet;
and then sticking all the coinlmstiblos we had brought with as n! on
him, we looked about. to see if we could find anything else to help to
burn him; when my Scotsman remembered that. by the. tent, or but,
where the men were, there lay a heap of dry forage, whether straw
or rushes I do not remember; away ho and the other Scotsman ran
and fetched their arms full of that. When we had done this, we took
all our prisoners, and brought them, having untied their feet and un-
gagged their mouths, and made them stand up, and set them before
their monstroue idol. and then set fire to the whole.

We stayed by it a quarter of an hour, or thereaboum, till the pow-
der in the eyes, and mouth, and ears,ot' the idol blew up, and, as we
could perceive, had split and defin-tned the shape of it; and, in a
word, till we saw it burned into a more. block or lng of wood : and
setting dry forage to it, we found it would he soon quite consumed ;
so we began to think of going away ; but. the. Scotsman said, " X0,W8
must not go, for these poor deluded \vretoltes will all throw thenmclves
into the fire, and burn themselves with the idol." So we resoh ed to
stay till the forage was burnt down too, and then came away and left
them.

After the font was performed, we appeared in the morning among
our fellow travellers, exceedingly busy in getting ready for our
jwrney; nor could any man suggest that we had been anywhere but
in our beds, at! travelers might be supposed tube, to fit themselves for
the fatiguea of the day's journey.

But the affair did not end no. The next day came a great number
of the country people to the town gates, and in a most outrageous
manner demanded satisfaction of the Russian governor for tho
insulting their priests, and burning their Chain Chi-Thnungu. The
people of Nertzinslroi were at first in a great consternation, for
they said the Tat-tars were already no less than thirty thousand
strong. The Russian governor sent out messages to appease them
and gave them all the good words inmginable; assuring them that456 ADVI'ZN runes or

he. knew nothing of it, and that there had not a soul in his garrison
been aln-oad, so that it could not he from auyhmly there; l-ut if
they could let him know who did it: they should he exemplariiy llllllr

misereaut: and they therefore resolved to denounce. war against
him and all the Russians, who, they said, \vere miscreants and
Christians.

The governor, still patient, and unuilliug to make a hr 'aeh, or to
hare any t':ltlHt' of war alleged to he given lny him, the ('1'.:ll' having
Strivlly charged "11'!" to treat the. t't'lztlllt'l't'tl country with gentleness
and t'ii'iiity,g:ave them still all the. good words he could. At last.
he told them there was a caravan gone toward lluraia that. morning,
and perhaps it was some of then: who had done. this injury: and that
it" they would he satisfied with, he. "'(Illltl send after them to inquire
into it. This seemed to tlltltt'utt'. them a little: and aet-ortlingly the
governor sent after us, and gave us a 1-artieuhtr :u-eonnt how the
thing was; intimating wi:hal, that if any in ear -ara\'aa had done

it or no. we. should make all lnwte forward that. was l-c-ssilnlte: and
that in the meantime, he. would keep them in play as long as he.

away west, as we did, hut. had supposml we would have taken that

in two days more they disappeared again ; for they, believing we were
Itill before them, pushed on till they came to the river Udda, a \'el'!
great river when it pnsscx further north, but when we came to it we
found it narrow and t'urdublc.

Tho third day, they hztzl either found their mistake, or had intelli-
gence of us, and came pouring in on us towurd the dunk of the even.
iug. We had, to our great untistLetion, jurt pitched upon it place for
our camp, which was very convenient for the night; for :15 we were
upon .1 desert, though hut at the beginning of it, that was above tivo
hundred miles over, we had no town to lodge :tt, nod, indeed, ex-
pected none hut. the i-ity ol' Jnrnwouzl, which we Imd yet two (lnys'
nlfll't7lt to. The desert, however, had Hilltlt'. fn-w woods in it on thix
side, and little rivers, which run all into the grentrinar lfddzi; it mm
in a. narrow strait, hotwetm little hut very thick woods, tlmt we
pitched our little camp for that night, expecting to he attacked be-
fore morning.

Nobody knew but our-Rclvcs what we were pursued for; hut an it
was usual for the Mogul Turtm's to go nlmut in troops in that desert,
lo the cururunu ulwnys fortify themselves every night against. them,
as uguinst rohhers: it was therofliro no new thing to he pursued.

But we had this night, of all the nights of our trzn-cls, a most :ul.
vnntatgnous enmp ; for we lay ll('l\\'('l!l| two woods, with a little riru-

to make our front as strong no we could, hy plncing our packfi, With
our camels and horses, nll in n line on the inside of the river, and
felling HOIHO trees in our reur.

In this posture we onezimped for the night; hut the enemy was
upon us lit-fore we had finialmd our situation. They did not come on
unlike thieves, as we expected. but sent three men. ,ngeru to us to
demand the men to he delivered up to them that had nhuscd their
prientfi, and burned their god Chum Chi-'l'hzumgu with fire, that they
might burn them with fire; and upon this, they said, they would go

all. Our Juen looked very hlnnk at this message, and began to stare
at one another, to see who looked with the most guilt in their the 2-1 ;

Some. time after this we saw them more it little to our right, and
('Xlll't'lt'tl them on the. rear; when at running fellow, u ('ussnek et'

more of them, nor whether they went, to Siheilkn or no. So we pnrsetl
away safely on to .lamwena. where there wm a garrison of Museu-
Vites, and there we. rested five. days. the. caravan being exeet-ulingly
fatigued with the last. day's hard nmrch, and with want of rest in the
night.

From this city we had a. frightful desert, which held un twenty-three
<<lays' nun-ch. We furnished ourselves with some tents hero, for the
better accommodating ourselves in the night; and the lender of the
caravan procured sixteen carriages, or wagons of the country, for car-
rying our water and provisions; and these carriages were. our defense
every night, round our little camp ; so that had the. Tm-tnrs appeared:
unless they had been very numerous indeed, they would not have been
able to hurt us.
We may well be summed to \vuut rent nguin nt'ter this long jour-
ney, for in thin desert we neither new home: nor tree, nod warm it

desert, and had travelled two dayn, we come to Junczuy, n )qucovita
city or station on the great river J anezay (Yeuisey), which, they told
us there, parted Europe from Asia.

Hero I observed ignorance and paganism still pre 'ailcd, except in
the Museovite garrisone; all the country between the river Oil)" and
the river Janezay is as entirely pagan, and the people as barbarous,
as the remotest of the Tartar-s; nay, as any nation, for aught 1 know,
in Asia or America. I also found, which I observed to the Muscovite
governors whom I had an opportunity to converse with, that the poor
pagans are not much winer,or nearer Christianity, for being under the
Museovite government; which they acknowledged was true enough:
but that, as they said, was none of their business; that if the czar ex.
peeted to convert his Siberian, Tonguese, or Tartar subjects, it bhould
be done by sending clergymen among them, not soldiers: and they
added, with more sincerity than 1 espected, that they found it was not
so much the Concern of their monarch to make the people Christians
as it was to make them subjects.

From this river to the great river Ohy, we crossed a wild unculti-
'ated country, barren of people and good management; otherwise it
is in itself a most pleasant, fruitful, and agreeable country. What, in-
habitants we found in it are all pagans, except such as are sent among
them from Russia; for this is the country, I mean on both sides the
river Ohy, whither the Museovite criminals that are not put to death
are banished, :md from whence it is next to impossible they should ever
come away.

I have nothing to say of my particular afl'airs till I came to To-
bola-hi, the capital city of Siberia, where I continued some time on the
following,' occasion.

We had now been almost: seven months on our journey, and winter
began to come on apacc ; whereupon my partner and I called a Coun-
cil about our particular affairs, in which we found it proper, as we
were bound for England, and not for Moscow, to consider how to dis-
pose of ourselves. They told us of sledges and reindeer to carry us
over the snow in the winter time ; and indeed, they have such things
that it would be incredible to relate the particulars of by which means
the Russians travel more in the winter than they can in summer, as
in these sledges they are able to run night and day. The snow being
frozen, is one universal covering to nature, by which the hills, vales,
rivers and lakes are all smooth and hard as a stone, and they run upon
the surface, without any regard to what is underneath.

But I had no occasion to push at a winter journey of this kind; I
was bound to England, not to Moscow, and my route lay two ways:
either I must go on as the caravan went, till I came to Jareslavr, and
then go till west for Nnrva and the Gulf of Finland,and no to Dantzic,
where I might. possibly sell my Chiuu. cargo to good advantage; or]
"lust leave the caravan at. a. little town on the Dwina, whence 1 had
lmt six days iiy water to Archangel, and thence might he sure
ol'hhipping either to England, llolland, or llamhurgh.

Now, to go any of these journeys in the winter would have been
preposterous: for as to Dantzic, the Billie would have been frozen
or, and l could not get. passage: and to go by land in those countries
was far less safe than among the .'logul Tax-tars; likewise, to go to
A reliangel in October, all the ships would he gone from thence, and
even the merchants who dwell there in summer retire south to Moscow
in the winter, when the ships are gone, so that. l could have nothing
but extremity of cold to encounter, with a scarcity of la'orisit ml, and
must lie in an empty town all the winter ; so that, upon the whole, I
thought it much my hotter way to let the caravan go, and make pro-
vision to winter where l was, at 'l'oholaki, in Siheria, in the latitude of
nhout sixty degrees, where l was sure of three things to wear out a
cold winter with, \'i7.., plenty of provisium, sun-h an the country atlord-
ed, a warm houve, with fuel enough, and exeellt-nt company.

I was now in a. quite ditherent elimatri from my beloved island,
where I never felt cold. except when I had my ague; on the contrary,
I had much to do to hear any clothes on my hack, and never made
any fire hut without doors, which was necessary for dressing my
food, &e. Now I made me three good rests, with large when or gown
over them, to hang down to the feet, and button close to the wrists;
and all these lined with furs, to make them sufficiently warm.

As to a warm liousr', I must confess I greatly disliked our way in
England, ot'nmlting tires in every room in the house in open ehimneyfi,
which, when the tire was out, always kept the air in the room (cold
as the climate; hut taking an apartment in a good house in the town,
I ordered a. chimney to he huilt like a furnace, in the center of six
several rooms, like a store ; the funnel to carry the mnokc went. up one
way, the door to come at the fire went in another, and all the rooms
were heat equally warm, but no fire seen, just. as they heat the hog-
lllhfi in England. By this means, we had always the same climate
in all the roan-.5, and an equal heat was I'tl'K'BCTVCd; and how cold
800?" it. was without, it was always warm within; and yet. we saw
no fire, nor were ever iueommoded with smoke.

The most. wonderful thing of all was, that it should be possible to
meet with good company here, in a country so barbarous as that. of
the most northerly parts of Europe, near the frozen ocean, within but
a very few degrees of Nora ZenIl-la. But this being the country
whore the state criminals of Must-my, as I observed before, are all
banished, this city was foil of IIolIlchen, gontlmncn, soldiers, and
courtiers of Mascot-y. Ilcre was the famous l'rincc Gall tzcn, the
old general liohostiski, and several other porsOna of note, IIIIII some

He spoke this with so much warmth in his temper, so much earnestr
ness and motion of his spirits, then it was oxidant: it. was the true sense
of his soul ; there was no room to doubt his sincerity. I told him I

I had given him an account; but that I thought he was not only a
monarch, hot a great conqueror; for that he that has got a \ietory

self, whose reason entirely governs his will, is certainly greater than
he that conquers a city. " But, my lord," said i, " thall I take tl.o
liberty to ask you a question?" " With all my heart," says he. " If
the door of your liberty was opened," enid l, " would you not take
hold of it to deliver you from this exile ?" " Ilold," said he, "your
question is subtle, and requires some serious, just distinctions, to give
it a sincere answer; and I will give it you from the hottmu of my
heart. Nothing that I ltuow of in this world, would move me to de-
liver myself from this state of banishment, except those lWO: first,
the enjoyment of my relations; and, secondly, 9. little warmer climate;
hot I protest to you that to go back to the pomp of the court, the
glory, the power, the hurry of a minister of state; the wealth, the
gaiety, and the pleasures of a eourtier; if my master should send
me word this moment that he restores to me all he banished me from,
I protest, if I knew myselt'at all, I would not leave this wilderness,
these deserts, and these frozen lakes, for the palace at Moscow."
" But, my lord," said I, "perhaps you not only are l.ani.~hed from
the pleasures of the court, and from the power, authority, and wealth
you enjoyed hefore, hut you may be absent too from some of the Con-
t'enienees of life ; your estate, perhaps, confiscated, and your effects
plundered ; and the supplies left you here may not be suitable to the
ordinary demands of life." " Ah," says he, " that. is as you suppose
me. to he :1 lord, or a prince, &e.: no, indeed, I a ; hut you are new
to consider me only as a man, a human creature, not at all distin-
grnished from another _: and so I can suffer no want, unless I should
he visited with sickness and distempers. However. to put the ques-
tion out of dispute, you see our manner; we are, in this place, five
persons of rank; we live perfectly retired, as suited to a state of han-
islnnent : we have something rescued from the shipwreck of our for.
tunes, which keeps us from the mere necessity of hunting for food;
hat the poor soldiers, who are here without that help, live in as much
I lenty as we, who go into the woods and catch sables and times: the
laboring of a month will maintain them a year; and, as the way of
living is not expensive, so it is not. hard to get suihcieut to ourselves.
So that objection is out of doors."

I have not room to give a full account of the most agreeable con-
versation I had with this truly great man ,' in all which he showed that
his mind was so inspired with a superior knowledge of things, so
supported by religion, as well as by a vast share of wisdom, that his
contempt of the world was really as much as he had expressed, and
that he was always the same to the last, as will appear in the story I
am going; to tell.

I had been here eight months, and a dark, dreadful winter i thought
it; the cold so intense that I could not so much as look abroad with-
out being wrapped in furs, and a mask of fur hefore my face, or ra-
ther a hood, with only a hole for breath, and two for sight: the little
daylight we had was, as we reckoned, for three months, not above
five hours a day, and six at most; only that snow lying on the ground
continually, and the weather clear. it was never quite dark. Our
horses were kept, or rather starved, underground, and as for our ser-
vants, whom we hired here to it ok after ourselves and horses, we
had. every now and then. their fingers and tees to thaw and take care
of, lest they should mortify and fall off.

It is true, within doors we were warm, the houses being close, the
walls think, the lights small, and the glass all double. Our food was
chiefly the flesh of deer, dried and cured in the season; bread good
enough, but baked as biscuits; dried fish of several aorta, and some
flesh of mutton and of the bufihloes, which is pretty good meat. All
the stores of provisions for the winter- are laid up in summer, and
well cured: our drink was water, mixed with aqua-vitae inrtead of
brandy; and for a treat, mead instead of wine, which, however, they
have excellent- good. The hunters, who venture almond all weathers,
frequently brought us in line venimn, and rometimen hear's flesh, but
we did not much care for the last. "'0 bad a good flock of tea, with
which we treated oar friends, as abovs, and we lived very cheerfully
and wellI all things considered.

It was now March, the days grown considerably longer, and the
"Talker alt least tolerable _: so the other travellers l:e;:an to prepare
sledge: to carry them over the snow. and to get things ready to be
going: but my measures being fixed, as I have said, for Archangel,
and not for Mmcovy or the Baltic. I made no motion; knowing very
well that the ships from the south do not. set out. for that part of the
World till May or June, and that if I was there hy the. beginning of
August. it would he as soon as any ships would he ready to go away;
and therefore I made no haste to be gone, as others did: in a word, I

It seems, every year they go thence to Museovy for trade. viz., to
carry furs, and buy necessaries, which they bring back with them to

that, since I had made such a generous offer to nun, he asked me if I

him, on the other side the Uhy; but that, if I consented, he would
send for him.

I made no limitation, hut, told him Iwould do it. Imade some
ceremony in letting him understand that it. was wholly on his account;
and that: seeing I could not. prevail on him, I would show my respect:
to him hy my concern for his Mm; hut. these things are too tedious to
repeat here. He sent. away the next day for his son; and in about
twenty days he came hack with the messenger, t-ringing six or seven
horsen loaded with very rich furs, and which, in the whole, amounted
to a very great value. Ilia scrvzmtshrought the horses into the town,
but. left the young lord at a distance lill night, when he came incog.
nito into our apartment. and his father presented him to me, and, in
short, we ('nnct'rtt-d the manner of our travelling, and everything
proper for the journey.

l had hought a eonsidernhlc quantity of Fables, lalack fox shine, lino
ermines, and Mich other turn as are very rich, in that city, in exchange
for some of the goods 1 had hrought from China: in particular for
the cloves and nutmegs, of which 1 sold the greatest. part here, and
the rest afterward at Archangel, for a much hatter price than I could
have. got, at. London; and my partner, who was sensible of the profit,
and whose business more particularly than mine was merchandise,
was mightily pleased with our stay, on account of the trailic we made
here.

It was the beginning of June when I left this: remote plaee. a city,
| ! vliove. little heard of in the world; and, indeed, it i-: so far out of
the road of commerce, that I know not how it. should he much talked
c-t'. We were now reduced to a very small caravan, having only
thirty-two horses and camels in all, and all of them passed for mine,
though my new guest was proprietor of eleven of them: it was most
natural also that. I should take more servants with me than I had lic~
form and the young lord passed for my steward F what great man I
passed for myself I know not, neither did it concern me to inquire.470 ADVEXTL'lH-'fi or

we had to say for it was, that we thought we had no troops of 'l'urttu's

so sensible of. that he would not allow us to lie kin-oud when we came
to several cities on the way, hut lay n'orontl himself, with his servant'
in the woods, nnd met. us always at. the appointed places.

We were just. entered Europe, having passed the river Kama,
which in these ports is the houndury between Europe and Asia, and
the first city on the European side was mailed Soloy Kamskoi, which
is as much as to say, the grant eitv on the river Kunm; nnd here we
thought to see some evident alteration in the people; hut we were
1:.iatuken: for as we had a. rust desert to pass, which is nem- seven
hundred miles long in some places, but. not uhovo two hundred miles
over where we passed it, so, till we came past that horrible place, we
fl und very little difference between that country and the Mogul Ter-
tm-y: the people are mostly pngtms. end little hotter than the snrages
ot' .\llt(ll'l\'a ; their houses and towns full of idols, and their way of liv-
i': wholly barbarous, except in the cities, as :thore, and the villages
near them, when they are Christians, as they cull themselves, of the
Creek church; but have their religion mingled with so many relics
of supersti ion, that: it is scarce to be known in some places from more
sorcery and witchcraft.

In passing this forest I thought, indeed, we must (after all our den-
gers were. to our imagination escaped, as before) have been plundered
nnr'. rnhhcd, and perhaps murdered by n. treep of thieves; of what
country they were I nm yet at a loss to know. but they were ell on
horseback, curried bows and arrows, and were at first about forty-firs
in number; they come on near to us as to he within two musket. shots,
and asking no questions surrounded us with their horses, and looked
very earnestly upon us twice, at. length they plaeed themselves just in
our way ; upon which we drew up in a. little line before our muacls,
being not above sixteen men in all; and being drawn up thin-,we
haired, and soot. out the Siberian servant who attended his lord, to me
who they were: his master was the more willing to let him go, he-
eanse ho was not a. little npprehonsiw that they were a Siberian troop
sent out after him. ll'ho men came up near them with a flag of truce,
and called to them, but. though he spoke several of their 1 argon-50$,
or di.xlocts of languages rather, he could not understand a Word they
said ; however, after some signs to him not to come nearer to them, at
his peril, the follow eamo hack no wi>er than he went; only that hy
their dress, he said, he believed them to be some Tartan) cf Kalmnek,
or ofthe t'irenssian hordes, and that. them must he more of them upon
the great desert. tl:t'-ugh he had heter heard that any of them were
seen so far north laofore.

Ahout. an hour after, they again made a motion to attack us, and
rode round our little wood to see where they wig-ht hrenk in; hut
finding us nlway< ready to face them, they went ofi' again, and we re-
solved not. to stir for that night.

Thin was small comfort to us; however. we had no remedy; there
was on our left hand, at ohout a quarter of a mile distance, a little
grove, and very near the road ; 1 immediately resolved we should
advance to those trees, and fortify ourselves as well as we could there;
for, first, l considered that the trees would in a. great. measure cover
us from their arrows, and, in the next place, they could not come to
charge us in a hody; it was, indeed, my old Portuguese pilot who
I) opened it. and who had this cxeelleney attending him, that he was
a rays roadiest and most apt to direct and encou go us in cases of
the must danger. We advanced immediately, with what. rpm-d we
could. and gained that little wood; the Tartnrs, or thieves, for We
knew not what to call them, keeping their stand, and nut attempting
to hinder us. When we came thither, we fimnd to our great satisfie-
ti-m that if. was a swampy piece of ground. and on the one side a very
great spring of water, which running out in a little hrook wxw. a little
farther. joined by another of the like size; mid was, in short, the
source of a considerable river, called afterward the Wirtska: the
from Which grew about this spri g were not nhove two hundred. hut.
very large, and stood quite think. so that as soon as we not in we saw

ourselves perfectly safe from the enemy, unless they attacked us on
foot.
While we stayed here waiting the motion of the enemy some hours,
widiout perceiving they mad} any movement, our Portuguese, with
some help, cut i'evcrul arms <<I trees half 03', and laid tit 'ai hanging
across from one tree to another, and in a manner fenced us in. About
l'.'.'u hours before night they came down directly upon us, and though
v.. had not pet'ecit'cd it. we {Mind they had been joined by some more
("2' the same, no that they were near finxrscore horse; whereof, how.
(aw-r, we fancied some were women. They came on till they were
within half-shot (.four ltttle wood, when we fired one musket without
tall, and called to them in the Russian tongue to know what. they
wanted, and hade them keep off; hut they came on with a double fury
up to the wood hltlt', tzot imagining we were so harricnrled that they
could not easily hrealt in. Our old pilot was our captain as well as
Our engineer, and desired us not to fire upon them till they came
within pistol-shot, that we might he sure to kill ; and that when we
did tire, we should i e Her to take good aim; we hade him give the
void of emmannd, which he dt-lnyed it) long, that there were some
of them within two piheu' length of us when we let fly. \l'e aimed
so true that we killed fourteen of them, and wounded several others,
as also several of their horses; for we had all of us loaded our pieces
with two or three hullets at least.

They were terribly surprised with our fire, and retreated immedi-
ately nhont, one hundred rods from us, in which time we loaded our
pieces again, and neeing them keep that distance, we nailied out, and
catehed four or the of their horses, whose riders we supposed were
killed ; and coming up to their dead, we judged they were Tartan,
but knew not how they came to make an excursion ofsueh an unusual
length.

We slept little, you may he sure, hnt spent the most part of the
night- in strengthening our situation, and harrieading the entrances
into the wood, and keeping a strict watch. We waited for daylight,
and when it came, it gave us a wry unwelcome discovery, indeed; for
the enemy, who we thonghtwere discouraged with the reception they
met with. were now greatly increased, had set up eleven or twelve
huts orients, as if they were resolved to hesiege us; and this little
camp they had pitched upon the open plain, about three quarters of
a ltlllu from us. "'0 were, indeed, surprised at this discovery; and
now, I confess, i gave myself over for lost, and all that I had; the
loss of my effects did not lie so near me, though very considerable,
as the thoughts of falling into the hands of Filt'll luarhm-ians at the latter
and of my journey, after so many difficulties and hazards as Ihad
gone through, and even in sight of our port, where we expected safety
and deliverance. As to my partner, he was raging, and declared that
to lose his goods would be his ruin, and that he would rather die than
he starved; and he was for fighting to the last drop.

The young lord, as gallant as ever flesh showed itself, was for fight-
ing to the last also; and my old pilot was of the opinion that we
were able to resist them all in the situation we were then in, and thus
we spent the day in debates of what we should do ; but towards
evening we found that the number of our enemies still increased, and
we did not know that by the morning they might be a. still greater
number; so I began to inquire of those people we had brought from
Toholski, if there were no private ways by which we might avoid them
in the night, and perhaps retreat to some town, or get help to guard
as over the desert. The Siberian, who was servant to the young lord,
told us if we designed to avoid them, and not fight, he would engage to
carry us off in the night, to away that went north, towards the river
Petr-on, by which he made no question but we might get away, and
the Tartars never the wiser; but, he sail, his lord had told him he
would not retreat, but would rather choose to fight. I told him he
mistook his lord; for that he was too wise a man to love fight-
ing for the sake of it, and that I knew his lord was brave enough by
what he had shown already; but that his lord knew better than to
desire seventeen or eighteen men to tight five hundred unless an un-
avoidable necessity forced them to it; and that, if he thought it pos--
sible for us to escape in the night, we had nothing else to do but to
attempt it. He answered, if his lmdship gave him such orders he
would lose his life if he did not perform it ;. we soon brought his
lord to give that order, though privately, and we immediately pre-
pared for the putting it in practice.

And, first, as soon as it began to be dark, we kindled a fire in our
little camp, which we kept burning, and prepared so as to make it
hum all night, that [he Tax-tars might conclude we were Htill there;
lmt as soon as it was dark, and we could see the stars (for our guide
would not stir beflxre), having all our horses and camels ready loaded,
we followed our new guide, who I soon found steered himself by the
north star.

A fter we had travelled two hours very hard, it began to be lighter
still; not that it was quite dark all night, but the moon hemn to
rise, so that, in short, it was rather lighter than we wished it to he ;
but by six o'clock the next morning we were got above thirty miles,

having almost spoiled our horses. Here we found a Russian village,474 11111111111111.1111 or
